"So overall would I recommend it ? Of course ! If you see that the price is the same as a Budweiser or a Molson or a Coors as a Labatt 50 , take the Labatt 50 with no doubt or no fear. This is a nice refreshing testing beer, with that personal taste. I took one and I was surprised that I took a second one."

"O - Disappointing since I can recall this beer being much more heavily hopped many years ago. I wouldn't turn one down, but I don't see myself buying this again as there are better choices in this class for the same money."

"Seems like another standard light drink."

"O - More of an adjunct, lots of bready malts and quite sweet. Easy drinking but not something I would grab for unless no other options were available. A simple minded brew indeed."

"Overall – I was quite surprised by the brew. While not a flavor powerhouse it was much smoother then I would have expected and was quite easy drinking and enjoyable."

"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, faint nose, more lager tones than ale. In the taste, a bit sweet, and still lager like, not so much ale like. A small bite and a lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dryness of a standard lager. More a lager that ale, however fresh nonetheless."

"As far as macro beers go this may be the best I've ever had - and that is saying a lot, because I've had plenty. This is a C+ pale ale and not a standout at all when compared within that beer style, but taken as a macro I'm hard-pressed to come up with something more palatable... a B+ grade seems far more fair in that context but I'm not much of a curve grader. I sometimes see this on-tap at bars with minimal selection, and it will probably be my default option at these places in the future."
"Overall – I was actually surprised at how decent this beer was. Growing up it seemed like this beer was the lunch line for a lot of beer jokes. For the style it's actually pretty drinkable and has a decent taste. You could do far worse."
"Probably 30 years since may last ""fitty"". Not sure if it was the nostalgia or the ale but I enjoyed it on tap at the Sheraton Toronto. Wish it were more available as an option when compelled to drink a mass produced product or chlorinated tap water."
"Overall, a surprise macro that works well in dire situations, when theres no other choice at shows."
"This doesn't completely suck, especially for a rather warm summer day and looking for a thirst quencher."
"Thos brew pours out as a clear yellow color with a fizzy whit sheaf that last only a few seconds. The smell of the beer almost has a pilsner aroma going on in it. There is some grassy notes and some hops on the nose. The taste was kinda hoppy and earthy. The mouthfeel is light and a little bitey. Overall not really that much of an impressive brew really. Wouldn't need to have this one again."
"I think this beer is definitely an above average macrobrew. It's cheap, has no really bad qualities and is drinkable. I might keep this around the house."
"Pours a golden yellow colour with thin white head. Some mild lacing on the glass. I can smell a hint of hops with bready malts. No off flavours, just some mild bitterness pretty much. This used to be one of my favourites before I knew of craft beer. It has more flavour than a typical macro lager."
"One of my favorite beers when I lived in London, ON. This is refreshing and crisp, but overall mediocre. Still, if I wouldn't turn it down on tap for sentimentality."
"Another ale from the big boys that blurs the line between lager and ale (Kim Mitchell should look into this!). I drank most of this before being distracted by watching an (entertaining) amateur play, so it turned out to be sufficient for the lull, but now onto something more modern and appropriate for the venue - oh, right, Big Rock."
"355ml can from The Beer Store, purchased with my 'empty return' money. Pours a very clear yellow with one finger of white foam and sheets of lacing on the lager glass. Smell and taste are light adjunct grains, yeast, corn, mild metallic twang, fruity and floral hop extract, grassy sweetness, water, pale and possibly pilsner malts, crisp and subtle spiciness to end. Some funky off aromas develop while drinking but remain at tolerable levels. Mouth feel is crisp, clean, thinner than medium, nice snappy bite, grainy drying finish. Much more flavour and character than your typical macro beer, but still pretty plain and tasteless compared to most craft offerings. When fresh and at its best, 50 is a bright, serviceable fall-back that outshines its mainstream counterparts. However, unless you're in a dingy bar, there's no reason to buy this over superior micro options."
"I tried this beer on May 22, 2009 at 'Hoops Bar and Grill (Bremner Blvd)' in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a translucent gold colour with a minimal white head, and a high amount of effervescence. The aroma was grainy malt and a surprising amount of hops. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour was similar to the aroma with grainy malt and a surprising hoppish flavour. Definitely better than I expected for something that probably can be classed as 'swill'"
"$4.99 a six pack of 11.5 ounce brown bottles."
"D: To put it bluntly, you could get bombed on this stuff. A little more alcohol combined with a taste that encourages mass consumption of a not too filling beer at a reasonable price (i paid $22.00 for a case), this beer is a great party beer to drink all night long"
"Mouthfeel was light and crisp and a bit dry with a higher than average amount of carbonation. A very drinkable beer."
"Overall my impressions are that this is an average offering from Labatt, not bad, but nothing worth raving over."
"Drinkability - I grew up on Labatt's 50 and find that it is one of my ""go to"" beers. Although it is imported, I consider it a glorified domestic, ranking higher than the macro's of the U.S. The taste is consistently very good, and has yet to let me down!"
"Drinkability - I had to rate this a 5 since there have been many, many nights of plenty with this beer. I've enjoyed it for years and years and it's always a great standby with great taste, refreshment and character. La cinquante, c'est.. la cinquante!"
"Good beer for watching hockey, football, reading a good book, or spending time with friends. When I serve it at home to company the reaction is usually something along the lines of ""50!! I have not had one of those for awhile""."
"It's not craft beer, but it's still not bad. Worth a try."
"Poured a medium and very lightly hazy golden-yellow color wtih a smaller sized white head. Aromas of some citric lemons, grainy, and some grassiness. Tastes of grains and some malty sweetness. Thinner body. Another one that isn't anything too special but 'drinkable'."
"Not a bad beer and the can is pretty neat written in french."
"This is real nice offering from Labatt. But in my opinion only 2nd to Blue. (I have a soft spot for that beer). Anyway, pours out a really golden yellow color, looks like pee. Smell is good, smells very fresh, malt up front, with a citrusy smell in the back. This has a really smooth and crisp taste, malt up front, just like the smell and a crisp hot bitterness at the finish. Very full mouthfeel, very satisfying. This is a great beer to pound all night, something you can relax with, when cold it is easy to drink alot of this. This is labatt's answer to Molson's Export, and I think this is much much better, but unfortunately it is harder to find at bars. I highly recommend this one!"
"Nothing impressive here - a totally average ale. That said - this is far better than Labatt's Blue. Not assertive in any regard, there is a faint hop bitterness with a slightly watery malt backbone. A beer that would pair well with pizza or a burger and is easy to drink. Nothing really wrong here, but nothing outstanding either."
"Pours a three-fingered white head that quickly fades to a thin layer leaving some lace. Crystal clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light bodied. No nose. Flavor is slightly sweet but balanced with hops, clean finish. Inoffensive golden. $1.75 for a 340ml bottle from Barb's Beer Emporium Concord, NH."
"An American Style Pale Ale from Canada that drinks more like a pilsner. Pours a pale gold like dry straw. No lacing at all. An aroma like Budweiser only not so sour. Surprisingly easy to drink. Starts a little sweet on the palate but finishes bitter. Down the middle. A little hops, a little malt. Lightly carbonated. Ok mouthfeel but very little body. For a big, big brewery this is a pretty decent brew. Wouldn't turn my nose up at it if offered, but wouldn't request it either."
"Now this isn't a bad beer, but there's little resemblance to a typical APA. It's more of what I'd call a macro ale, as it reminds me a great deal of a macro lager. The taste is slight and sweet and the carbonation is a bit sharp. The flavor isn't bad when you pick it apart - husky grain and white bread with a sweet green apple note. There's even a hint of hops for balance, but this is closer to a blonde ale, than anything else I can think of in the ale category. On par with Genesee Cream Ale."
"mouthfeel is crisp, light, drinkable - one of the best labatt choices i've had"
"This ale is quite refreshing and quaffable; great for a summer day I would suspect. Not too bad at $4.99 a sixer at my local beer place. one could do much worse. (see my review on Molson Ex,haha.)"
"poured out a clear golden brown with a decent head. definite malt and hops in the nose and taste. slight citrus taste. not remarkable but pairs well with food.Excellent for drinking in the summer with a relatively clean taste with a slight hop aftertaste. Can enjoy several over an evening."
"---"
"D-Pretty drinkable for $9.99 a case,good quaffer and fairly refreshing."
"Beats any macro pale lager."
"First off appearance is much like most of the other macro lagers out there pale straw colored golden hue with a bright white head retention is actually decent and carbonation doesn't seem over done with fizziness. Oh yeah and lacing is actually there evenly with each sip fine even and intricate on my chalice. Aroma contains an actual mild citrus and herbal toned hop profile with a minimal amount of cereal sweetness and mild perfume like accents. Flavor wise some residual honey like sweetness after the crisp light malt grain and adjuncts clear. Mineral water with a trace of citric and herbal hop kick just peaking through in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied carbonation does tickle the back of the throat but overall quite unremarkable. Drinkability is mediocre this is definitely a macro brew, that I can do without."
"All in all, the drinkabilitty was good without sacrificing body. This is much preferable to most macro lagers and should be recognized."
"D- Ehhh, I'll pass... but I'd drink this over Blue... John Labatt Classic is still the best out of the bunch though."
"Had this sitting in the fridge and just needed a beer. Pours a bright flourescent, pale yellow color with plenty of sudsy white head. Smell is somewhat skunky with grainy corn type aroma. Taste is sweet with the malt of plenty of a grain taste. Mouth feel is crisp and refreshing. Good style on a hot summer day, so I guess I drank this at the wrong time."
"And yea, whats up with the 11.5 oz bottles?? shame on you."
"So if you're looking to put back a 12-pack and not too concerned about flavor, this might not be your worst choice."
"D - This is an okay APA. Probably one of Labatt's best brews, but it really lacks in hop character."
""
"Overall a decent and easy drinking ale."
"D-Really doesn't exhibit many outstanding qualities. Kind of a basic run of the mill golden ale...certainly not at all similar to the good APA's I've had....I'd never buy it again but if given one I'd have no problem putting it down."
"Smooth drinkability aid this beer and its appeal to go with food."
"12oz brown bottle - this one labeled Labatt 50 (my last one was Labatt Canadian Ale). Pours clear straw yellow with a thin film of offwhite head. Smells somewhat malty, with adjuncts and DMS playing roles in the aroma as well. Tastes like biscuit malt with a small amount of American hops and adjunct flavor as well. Pretty drinkable, and more tasty than most macro-beers. Having said that, there are definitely better examples of the style with a lower price tag. Good for what it is though, and better than Labatt Blue."
"I don't like how my Labatt 50 comes in 11.5 ounce bottles. The Canucks are robbing me of a half an ounce of beer per bottle. In this situation I don't really mind. The beer's pretty mediocre. It's pale gold with a white head that goes away quickly. I smell a musty hop-like odor that I wouldn't say is a very good. It's not too horrible but not a great smell. Tastes like a typical macrobrew that's trying to sell something as being special. I don't know what ingredients I'm tasting here. Corn, rice, some stinky hops? The beer's OK. I don't think I'll buy it again but if someone wants to give me one for free I'll take it."
"Pours a medium golden color with a head that never seems to rise much. Aroma is somewhat fruity and some malt shines through. I've always heard good things about this beer but it never was widely available in this area until now. Taste is somewhat bitter and malty with some chewiness. Better than I expected. A second sip confirms it. The only thing I don't like is the aftertaste but other than that, this isn't a bad choice for something made by Labatts."
"Drank it right from the bottle at a barbeque on a 95 degree day. I was not expecting much. Expected a BMC. I was suprised. This beer had a nice light character, with a slight malt flavor. Easy to drink. Even though there were a few beers available that I have not sampled. I went back for a second Canadian Ale. I would add this to my list of beers worthy of a six pack purchase."
"Being that Labatt is, more available than the others, when I get a craving and I'm not in Ballantines area...that is a long stretch for an average beer. Better than Labatts Blue I guess."
"DA: could not finish."
"D- Easy to drink, but just like every other basic blond beer. Had it with pizza, which was a good match."
"pours golden with a bit of head, much like any other macro. Smells sweet, but i get a sensation of hops which i find pleasant. Taste more or less like the smell, with a hint of hops rarely found in a macro. Mouthfeel is nice, not overpowering, but not to watery. The highlight of this beer is most certainly drinkablity. You could easily find yourself drinking one to many, and i have yet to find something that ""flows"" like a 50"
"I still haven't had what I would consider a good beer from Labatt. Canadian Ale might the best so far because it's actually drinkable in a 'gotta be cold' kind of way. Too bad it isn't as widely available south of the 49th parallel as is Labatt Blue. Not that it matters to me. I don't care if I ever drink either one of them again."
"Labatt Canadian Ale is, indeed, an ale. It was launched as ""Labatt 50"" in 1950, and was Canadas best-selling beer until 1979! It pours a deep golden color, and raises a finger-thick head of creamy white froth. The head retention is slightly better than average, and it leaves some nice lace about the glass. The nose is mainly malty, basic and sweetish, and there's a light touch of fruity yeastiness. It's medium bodied and gently crisp across the palate. The flavor offers a very well balanced combination of gently sweet malt, a mild yeasty fruitiness, and some leafy and mildly grassy hops. It's still a basic golden ale, but there's more to it than most golden lagers offer. It finishes dry with a drop of sweet maltiness that fades quickly, leaving behind a refreshing bitterness and some dull, lingering hops. An interesting and refreshing golden ale!"
"50 pours a light golden color with a white sticky head. Smell is slightly grainy and malty. Taste is sweet malt with a hint of hops. At $8 a 12 pack, you really can't beat it for the price. Labatt Canadian is definitely one of the best macros around, my favorite for sure."
"Poured in nonic glass achieving a surprising 2 finger head that collapsed but held its own down the glass, sticking/lacing. Straw colored with med. to high carbonation. Smell is slightly fruity. Flavor is grainy up front with medium bitterness, then slight fruit takes over and finishing with good hop bite. I get a little adjunct flavor near the end but not bad as some macro lagers/ales. Mouthfeel is average but good for a lighter ale. Seems to be a throw back that to me is very refreshing and satisfying. Pretty easy on the wallet, bought in the Detroit metro area for about $9.50 a 12 pack...."
"The mouthfeel is decent, and the drinkability is also. I really dont get overly tired of this beer, and we've been doing the tango for a few months now."
"It is a paele gold. With a head that is about 2 inches and disapears quickly. It smell is pretty malty and not very present. Tatse of somr amlt and with very distnict bitternes. It was very pleasent compared to other LaBatt brews Ive tried. Carbonation is pretty present when in teh mouth and kinda of hides some of the taste. Overall a very drinkable beer that can be enjoyed but obviosully needs improvement."
"I will never order this one again. Not drinkable at all considering aroma is a large part of my taste in beer. The only reason I ordered this in the first place was out of curiosity and I'm trying to finish up my world tour at a local pub."
"Pours crystal clear pale gold. A one and a half finger head of dense bubbles shows decent retention and some spotty lacing. Aromas of pale malt and mild noble hops. Sweet munich and spicy pilsener malts make up a decent malt flavor, but the taste is still mild. Classic semi-dry german hops in the aftertaste are barely noticed in an otherwise clean finish. What it lacks in flavor, it makes up for with an excellent balance. Medium/low carbonation with a light body that combines with crisp malt profile for a smooth mouthfeel and good drinkability."
"Drinkability: Well, not bad for the style. Rather refreshing. But taking cost into account, there are many beers of comparable quality that are easier on the wallet. Nothing special."
"Like most macros, this one doesn't have much flavor upfront, but it does have a nice dry finish. However, its too bland for a session beer."
"This review is based on numerous bottled samples: This stuff is quite enjoyable. It's not as clean or smooth as Labatt Blue or the better Molsons, but it's more flavorful. Reminds me of the way my father's beer tasted in the 60's and 70's before just about all those old brands got watered down. The taste really settles in and makes sense if you happen to be smoking a cigarette at the time as well; not surprising given this was released to market in 1950, the latter part of the dear old Swing era. By no means the best available in today's beer market if you have the oof and can afford to sling it around a bit, but hard to beat at $18.50 a case (retail) in Worcester if you have to watch the decimals. That makes it a bit pricier than the standard US macros, but it's pronouncedly better than those, as well as a surprising number of more expensive brands (such as Corona, usually about $21 a case). A pleasant throwback, perfectly preserved after 55 years, and shrewdly priced to boot."
"Drinkability: Underated. This brand exists since several decades and it used to be trendy long years ago. So, drink it in a nightclub will be you looking funny, but it is still a hidden gem in the current world of canadian macros."
"Decided to give this one a shot because of a $1.00 price tag for a single. I guess I got my moneys worth. Pours a clear golden color with mild bubbles. Medium thin white head and minimal lacing. The aroma is vaguely sweet with nothing really distinguishing itself. Light-bodied with a pretty bland flavor of mild hops and sweet corn. Luckily nothing offensive in there. The finish is crisp, dry and pretty much flavorless aside from the faintest hops bitterness. All said, it's a Labatt by any other name."
"poured a straw yellow, not much head or retention, smell was almost non- existant, very little taste as well, lightly hopped, corn husk flavor, mouthfeel is thin and watery very carbonated, drinkability, is average at best, would make a nice lawnmower beer."
"I tried this beer again after a couple of years and more experience. Honestly, I did not think it was so bad. A mildly hoppy and malty beer with high carbonation. A more rounded out maltiness and drier than Labatt Blue. A simple golden ale that is thirst quenching and non-offensive to the average beer drinker (which is mostly not a good thing). Recommended if your other option is a BMC or other Labatt product."
"Bottle: Poured a golden color ale with almost no head. Aroma is very weak, almost non-existent. Taste is a mix between some sweet malt and light bitterness. Better then most crap that Labatt produce but this is still macro beer without taste. Im not even sure this one should qualify as American Pale Ale."
"The best of the American Labatt's that you can get in my opinion. Medium to high carbonation, light bubbly head that is short lived. Golden yellow color that is typical of well made beers. This beer has more flavor that regular Labatt's and would be more to the liking of those who prefer a more complex beer. Flavors of malt and hops were most present. Overall, I see this beer as far over looked and highly underated. Worth a try if you have never had it."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a clean crisp scent that boasts of grainy pale malts, lager yeast, and some hops. The taste is decent also. It has a basic pale malt flavor along with a dry lager yeast finish. It goes down easy and finishes clean. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It has an above average makeup, but it goes down quick and easy."
"Pours an unpromising translucent pale golden color, I've seen pilseners a deeper shade of gold than this. The head's pretty adequate, but the overall carbonation left is low and a few bubble streamers. Bready, grainy malts and a flickering of floral hops, but not much in either department, aroma-wise, corn is present in the aroma, too. Overall taste is rather subdued, white-bready and thin on the malt, and thin on the hops. Slightly crisp, but that's one of its only assets."
"Pours out a clear straw yellow with a light bright white head. Nice and smooth with a halfway decent malt profile. Crisp hop balance. Very light and drinkable. A macro ale if there ever was one, but a macro ale done right. Easy to drink and tastes good enough to enjoy. A good backup beer if only american and canadian macros are available at the beer store."
"Clear gold colour with a bright white head, which stuck around for a couple minutes and left light lacing on the glass. Very light aroma with some malt and a light hop character. Bitterness served as a base for the (light) flavour, and it carried through to the dry finish. Some malt sweetness at the beginning that didn't last long. Light bodied and fairly smooth. Not a bad thirst quencher."
"Labatt is as popular around here as snow. It's everywhere. But I don't come across the Canadian Ale too often. It's very pale amber colour with little head, if any at all is it's weakest point. Other than that. it's not a bad beer. A bit of a plain taste, but there are hints of earthy hops. As smooth as an ale can get."
"Drinkability: Doesn't do much for me. In fact, I just assumed it was a pale lager and not a pale ale. It was an average lager, but makes for a wretched Pale Ale."
"At $8.99 a 12-pack I'll pass as there is far better to come from a can a cheaper at that."
"Is it ale or lager...I dunno but it's great if you like belching."
"A Canadian ale that is brewed like a lager leaving very little distinctive character. The beer looks like a typical Canandian lager in the glass, pale gold color with a wispy head. The aroma is corn sweetness and very faint fruit notes. The taste is clean, corn sweetness, and faded yeast flavors. Not distinctive at all. As are most Canadian beers, this is a very clean drinkable beer, but not much different than any of the other macros from Canada."
"This is quite drinkable, although the only remarkable quality about it is that it doesn't taste too bad. Compared with other macro-ales, this is a step above. Compared to some real ales, this is nothing. All in all, a decent Labatt offering."
"If they say this is ""Canadian Ale", I guess this is it... eh? Tannish Gold in color with a rapidly dissipating head that lingers thin on the top and leaves a trail of wispy lace. Damp corncob, malt and alcohol aroma. Thin malt doughy body. Medium sharp-edged hops. Dry, with little in way of balancing sweetness. The alcohol is not hidden in the flavor. Drinkable."
"well...this one pours out pretty blonde and golden, as it should....thin head, but leaves a little lace for looks. slight pale malt aroma....some slight floral hops. pretty thin in the taste department...slight malts...i don't detect any obnoxious adjuncts really. light mouthfeel for an ale. pretty smooth and easy drinking. finishes a slight bit sweet. the best way to describe this is an ""ale light"". would make a great crossover brew for lager drinkers tip-toeing into ale territory. or a good session ale where one could pound down copious amounts. otherwise it's a pretty weak ""ale"". rates high for drinkability."
"Straw light golden color with bright white head that receeds faster than the hairline of your uncle alan. Taste is dry and lacks any real punch of flavor. Heavy initial carbonation tickles tongue initially but fizzles down to moderate bubbling. Rather boring beer, yet might make a good hot weather summer session beer (for some reason I don't think they have summers hot enough to enjoy this beer in Canada though). For some reason I remeber it being much better. Its just dry and slightly veggie tasting...please give me something else. Its a shame but I don't know which is better this or blue."
"One of the blandest ales I have ever tasted, though I can't be too harsh. This isn't a good beer, but it's not bad either. At best, below average. As usual, I drank this straight from the bottle. Smelled like a weak ale. Mildly hoppy and breadlike? Sort of like a bakery. Tasted like wet, whole wheat bread. My first bottle was a little skunky, but the rest so far are fine. Mild bitter finish, which adds to it's low drinkability rating. It's not too bitter, it's more that it just isn't a pleasant beer. Bought it in a Labatt Holiday mixer pack. Otherwise, wouldn't have bought it at all."
"This is a pretty brew but lacking in personality.....nice golden hue with thick crown when it first makes its appearance....then quickly disapates to a nice glass ring with medium lace.....aroma is passable....then.....body is thin, taste is even but weak, disapointing"
"I would like to try this beer's malt paired with Balantine's hops."
"Not a bad beer, all in all. I did not consider this an ale, but a beer of some sort. It has some grain to its taste, and just a hint of hops. This is proably as good as it gets from Labatt's."
"Crystal clear straw in hue topped by a thin, but sparse lace leaving head.  Sulfur hits the nose upfront, and is ensued by light cooked veggies and grain husk... this smells like a run of the mill megaswill.  It's relatively bland all around in flavor-- non - descript grainy flavors abound, but thankfully generic hop bitterness manages what would be overbearing flaked corn sweetness.  Hop flavor is virtually non - existant.  The finish is of yellow corn (where's my butter?) and a hint of bready grain.  Although Labett Canadian Ale isn't a bad brew, the high percentage of adjuncts compromise the malt profile.  This is reminescent of Genesee Cream Ale, but less clean.  My first and last."
"That sums this beer up, along with Ex:  the cream of the crop among ""sale priced"" cases."
"But if you don't want to invest the cash in a superior brew, and are just looking to tie one on without much thought...here's one for you."
"Labatt Canadian Ale (Labatt 50 in Canada) is a decent, thirst quenching ale.  Labatt ""Green"" (due to the label color) is very prevelent in stores here in the Detroit area.  Somewhat fruity with a higher bitterness than Blue, this is a nice, light ale and something of a ""training wheel"" beer to get macro-drinkers to jump into ales."
"I was on a Labatt 50 kick for a while many moons ago. It was a welcome change of pace. After another recent tasting, it's still a decent beer. We snuck it into many a show at the local midnight movie theater, you remember the ones, Pink Floyd laser show, The Who - The Kids Are Alright, anybody with me here?"
"I like this ale.  Nice and refreshing.  A notch below Molson Export."
"Notes: The Ballantine XXX Ale of Canada? Not too bad if you're looking for a quick beer to suck down and quench your thirst."
