There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, musty, skunk, wheat, and grain. The flavor was of sweet malt, grain, wheat, earth, and metallic. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was an average brew. Unfortunately nothing on this one really stood out for me for this style. It seemed to be a pretty average example of the style with the earthy and wheat flavors going on. I really wish it could have had a just a little more going on to make my palate jump up and down with joy. They do good beers, but this isn’t one of my favorites.","thagr81us","Dec 09, 2012"

And this is as good as it gets in the middle-tier price range. Blows the doors off all the other blah Southern session ales, comes only in a can, has a lot of flavor, and won't have you on the floor if you happen to burn through a bunch. NOLA can be a little hit or miss, but the Blonde really works.","ZethOfTheNorth","Sep 19, 2012"

It pours a lightly hazy gold topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises wheat, light coriander, lemon peel, and a sort of Brett-like funk that seems rather out of place here. The taste brings in more of the same, with a light pinch of black pepper and a bit more lemon zest than before. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda grainy feel. Overall, a more-than-ordinary brew, one I'm glad to have tried for the sake of it, but nothing I'd ever really look to have again.","TMoney2591","Dec 30, 2011"
