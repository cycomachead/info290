It is, after all, a blonde ale. The hops hit you up front, but it goes down smooth with a little aftertaste from the hops. It's actually a pretty refreshing autumn beer, a good way to transition from the crisp summer ones into the typically darker, warmer beers of the fall.","TheRealBigC","Jul 31, 2012"

Some nice lacing down the glass as well. Aromas of grapefruit, floral, orange, apricot, light caramel, bread, and a bit of wheat. Some nice aromas with decent strength. Taste of nice grapefruit, pine, floral, orange, bread, light pine, spices, and wheat. Good amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, spiciness, bread, and light caramel for a bit on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy mouthfeel that drinks smoothly. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Overall a nice and drinkable blonde ale. Quite enjoyable and definitely a nice option for a session. It is nicely balanced in flavors and not anything extreme that would make it unpalatable after a few glasses.","superspak","Jan 09, 2012"

The head was about a finger which disappeared some what quickly, while the color was a gold color and quite clear. The flavor was dominated by the hops with a bit of the malt showing up in the aftertaste. The feel was of a medium body.

The head is thick, pure white, pillowy and leaves a beautiful lacing. Aroma is very present with lots of hop. Hop flavor comes on strong at the start and lasts all the way through. The underlying malts are subtle and stay that way – the Hoptober is not too sweet as many types of ale are. There is a bit of bitter in the aftertaste. All in all, this is just what ale should be if you like complex hops winning over malt sweetness.","iSip","Oct 10, 2011"
3.65,-3.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"You get two fingers of pure white foam, loose and delicate, heavily dimpled surface with islands of larger bubbles, lots of stickiness leaves serious lacing residue behind. The liquid is not cloudy but it’s not crystal clear either, golden yellow with a vague hint of orange, random super-tiny bubbles float within. The nose first hits you with pepper, green grasses and grains as well as white grapefruit to lemon zest, slightly warmer there’s richer apricot, peach fruit and flower accents, ends with an earthy, metallic ring, aggressively jabs you. Medium to full-bodied, given its generally creamy mouth texture it is surprising how bitter it can seem at times, the hops are green and verging on mean. The pepper, saline, quinine and just plain poor dirt at once lends it punch and dries things out some. The white citrus adds more scrubbing sensations. Hidden off to the side are the peach, apricot, pear fruit as well as floral dew. It’s on the aggressive side, that creaminess really saves it from becoming overbearing. Could put down a couple in a row but that’s it.","farrago","Oct 09, 2011"

As the beer goes down, the sticky white lacing clings to the glass beautifully. It smells like crisp sweet apples and bold golden wheat. The mouth-feel is light and carbonated, highly drinkable. You can taste sweet caramel apples and citrus hops here. At first you wonder if it really is an Autumn beer, but half-way through, you realize this beer is brilliant. It IS an Autumn beer, it's just presented in a different way. It's crisp, light, warm, brilliant. It's not an Oktoberfest, but it is meant for October. Highly recommended.","JuicesFlowing","Oct 01, 2011"

4.27,12.4,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Up front there is a nice clean feel that tastes almost sweet, like there's a twinge of tangerine almost. Bold and bitter hops take over the back of the palate. Piney hops are the main feature, but they are almost matched with a nice smacking of caramel malts that come close to balancing this one. Certainly a hop-forward beer, but there is that balancing factor in the malt bill. Every now and then, a sip will just remind me of tangerine as well, adding a layer onto the complexity. The carbonation level is right on for the style at medium-high, but despite that, there is a wateriness to the feel that is just a smidge out of place. Otherwise, it finishes crisp and dry, fitting for a beer featuring the month of October in its name. Very good beer, and definitely worth the 3.99 price tag. I will almost certainly be picking this one up again.","chodinheaven","Sep 29, 2011"

There is some graininess and grassiness to its aroma, which leans towards the citrusy hops of Sierra Nevada. There is a bit of carbonation bite to its taste, but beyond that, there is soft subtle malt sweetness. Perhaps the word soft comes to mind because the texture of this beer, especially the initial foamy layers, reminds me of nothing less than soft lips of a sensual kiss. In this sense, this may be the sexiest beer I know. The beer is worth experiencing for that reason alone. A blonde?

There's just a slight chill haze, and no rising carbonation bubbles. The scent is pretty nice and consists mostly of a variety of hops, ranging from floral to citrus and just a bit of bitter. The taste starts off with a pale malt start, toasty, pretty spicy, I guess very spicy for the style. Nice floral undercurrents, some wheat grains, I think some rye as well. The malt profile is getting fairly complex the more I let this one run around my mouth. Some lemon zest and some grassy notes as well. The hops finish bitter.

The taste is similarly simple, with the aforementioned lemon being wrapped in a soft blanket of mild pine and grapefruit rind. It's exceedingly light, and the flavors don't even try to linger on the tongue. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp finish.

Very hop forward, an amazing combination of grassy and tropical fruit notes. Some sweet mint in the background. A touch of sugary malt sweetness. Taste is similar to the smell. Tropical fruits up front, some malty sweet notes, and grassy bitterness in the finish. Not a perfect balance but it tastes great, a wonderful display of hops without being overly bitter. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and slightly sticky. Could have a cleaner finish. Drinkability is great. Not overly bitter, not overly sweet, not too high abv. The only downside to this is the hops has faded significantly since the first 6 pack I bought.

But not too hoppy, or too anything for that matter. In it are hints of dry citrus and fairly medium hops, with a decent amount of carbonation that adds an initial sharpness to the beer. As with many beers from New Belgium this beer tastes of good ingredients and modest aims. For what it is, and more importantly what it costs (Folly 12-Pack for 18.99reg, 13.99sale at your local Albertson's) Hoptober is pretty darn good.","msmezher","Sep 14, 2010"

Aroma is a strong hit of citrusy and slightly spicy/catty ""C" hops (centennial, cascades, etc.) some sweet grainy/honey-like/biscuits in the background. Flavor is quite surprising. With all the hop aroma, the mouth expects puckering IPA-like bitterness. Not here, it is hop flavor and enough alpha acids to balance the sweet specialty malts, rye and oats. It tastes almost like a dessert wine with the crisp sticky sweetness that fades fast to a bittersweet balance. Mouthfeel is on the heavy side for the style and strangely satisfying.

The taste is mildly bitter to start Repeats of the earthen grass, but no citrus. The malts add a dry toasted gristy taste and mouthfeel. Pretty good balance for a hoppy blonde ale.

Light, crisp flavor from the ""C" hops give some citrus notes, also some spice and grassy notes as well. Slight sweetness at first but finishes bitter and clean. New Belgium packed a lot of hop flavor in this beer. Light body with lively carbonation without being harsh. One nitpick I have with this beer is the unnecessarly high ABV. Is it because it is a Fall seasonal? If it could be at 4.5% ABV or lower I could drink these all day.

4.3,13.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A damn tasty beer New Belgium has crafted here. Although it's called ""Hoptober", the grain bill is the highlight for me, as the rye and oats meld perfectly to form a sublime, earthy smoothness to the body. Suggestions of wet hay and raw oatmeal, before a spicy kick from the rye hits mid-palate. Hops take charge of the finish, adding a great, bitter balance with notes of citrus flesh and green mint. Mouthfeel is a bit aggressive for the style, but that's not too much of an issue for me. Although this won't be the most in-your-face brew that New Belgium has to offer--far from it--but the flavor of Hoptober is both original and superbly well-balanced.

Aromas were pleasant floral hops coupled with freshly squeezed citrus - mainly lemon with a hint of orange. Tastes were complex and very well balanced, consisting of biscuity malt - slightly bready, fresh crisp hop providing some lemon and grapefruit zest and some herbal qualities. Slight caramel mixed in with a peppery finish from the rye. Bitterness is present, but plays so well with the other flavors. Mouth-feel is light-to-medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and ever so mildly oily allowing the hop resins to cover the palate. Nice golden ale background with an awesome hop bite. The hop and malt medley is greatly balanced providing remarkable drinkability - this was much better than I anticipated. I also like the way the hop flavor is so pronounced without the huge bitterness - nice change of pace. This is the reason I love American craft brewers - they can take a classic style and completely change the way it is brewed, add different ingredients and come up with something that actually is reminiscent of an Oktoberfest Märzen with a definite American flare.

The beer pours with clear golden color and foamy white head with aromas of citrus. Flavors of grapefruit very prevalent throughout the palate with a slight hint orange.

3.8,0,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Edit: The more I have this beer the more impressed I am by the appearance and hop aroma/taste. It is pretty tasty beer when you need some hops that aren't too over the top.","dpodratsky3","Aug 20, 2009"
3.97,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured from the bottle a nice, hazy orange color. With ""golden ale"" on the label, I wasn't expecting bold flavors, but the smell is pretty dominantly of floral hops. The blend of hops, which produces a solid grapefruit note, is even more upfront in the taste. Medium in body, with a crisp finish, I found Hoptober pretty light and refreshing. Not what I expected from a beer labeled as a golden ale or from an autumn release, but I enjoyed it.","Riccymon","Aug 19, 2009"
