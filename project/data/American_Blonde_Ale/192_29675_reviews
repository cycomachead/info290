"Flavor is so minimal, essentially water with some beer in it. I guess I get the point"

"Skinny dip pours a bronze color with a nice small but lacing head.  There is a mellow but still noticeable spice note.  The taste is crisp and spicy, hints of pepper.  Great feel, and nice strong flavors.  Overall its a stronger spicier blonde ale."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 11/30/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of grapefruit, lemon zest, lime, orange peel, toast, biscuit, light caramel, herbal, grass, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus hops, spice, and bready malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, lime, orange peel, toast, biscuit, light caramel, herbal, grass, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Light earthy/peppery bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon/orange zest, lime, toast, biscuit, light caramel, herbal, grass, and light pepper on the finish for a short bit. Good balance and robustness of citrus hops, spice, and bready malt flavors; with a nice crisp hop/malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Flavors are definitely on the light side, but it does not feel watery. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly dry mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish as expected of 4.2%. Overall this is a nice and pleasant blonde ale. Well balanced citrus hop, spice, and bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall - A fair summer blonde... about the only thing it did was make me wonder why they ever retired Somersault as their summer seasonal. Now THAT was a fantastic blonde!"
"O: A fairly smooth, easy to drink beer that has a unique twist. Not many beers immediately bring to mind pepper flavors but it was a welcome change. Decent hops, lacking much malt substance to my dismay, but easy to drink so it's okay. Solid B+."

"Skinny Dip is the absolute worst beer I've ever had. It tastes like cigarettes. I am at a loss as to how this beer has a score of 78 (at the time of this review). I made the severe mistake of buying a 12-beer New Belgium sampler pack that included this beer. I haven't liked a single New Belgium beer that I've ever tried."

"OVERALL: this beer is simple and inoffensive, if you served to a wide range of guests no one would complain but, there are better more exciting beers to be had, I enjoyed this beer but will probably not buy it again."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, biscuits. Taste is of caramel malts, hops are present, some biscuits, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a fine choice on a hot summer night."

"T: Better than a macro light beer, but only by a slim margin. It sits in limbo between styles for me: If I want water I'll have water, if I want beer I'll drink something bigger."

"Overall - A decent tasting beer but for a light watery summer beer, these flavors don't really go with it. More of a light autumn beer IMO."

"Overall- A decent beer but nothing memorable. It would work on a hot summer day."
""
"Light amber with a head that last and some decent lacing.. the smell is bready, copper toasted malt.. the taste is a biscuit toasted malt with a slight carmal.. but cut with a little bit of water.. its like all the flavors are muted.. mouthfeel is light.. this beer is nice for summer.. kinda bland but maintains enough flavor to be decent."
"Clear golden color with nice lines of carbonation. Aroma is weak, slightly astringent and did not entice me to drink. The taste was okay, but overall quite mild, with a slight malty presence and a hint of bittering hops. After taste is crisp, but also acidic and not ideal in my book. It goes down fine, but the mouthfeel is light and watery. Overall, drinkable and fine, but not that impressive of a blonde ale, a style already not on my favorites list."

"Pours a clear golden amber with a thin white head. Aromas of toasted bread. Taste begins with some toasted bread, then some toffee, and finishes with some leafy, grassy hops. Mouthfeel is good. Overall a pretty good, lower alcohol beer. Would be nice after mowing the lawn."

"Skinny Dip pours a golden yellow with a thick white head that drops quickly from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is citrusy with a bit of grain. The flavor is light and pleasant with a similar twang to it that Fat Tire does (the malt bill?). Finishes a bit dry. Nice."

" Overall it was a little bitter to be a real sessionable ale, and is honestly a bit forgettable. Nothing really standing up and greabbing you about this one. A decent pale ale that doesnt really stand out in the crowd."
"D) An easy drinker. I'd have another one."
"D: Although the beer isn't bad, I will be unlikely to purchase again in near future."
"Drinkability is very good. I would not say its spectacular, but it is better than most microbrews - its on the verge of macro level."
"This is a great easy drinking beer for those that are not hop-driven. It's a light amber color with a 1 finger white head. The taste is that of malt, light citrus, and even lighter hops. It's a summer seasonal product, so I relieved the local liquor store of their remaining 3 cases in early fall."
"D- Refreshing and easy to drink."
"Skinny Dip Ale is crisp and light or medium bodied. Its a decent choice on a hot 90 degree summer day. Thanks to Rob for New Belgium variety pack."
"Pours a slightly-hazed yellow color with a light white head and not much lacing. The nose brings some really faint citrus notes. Other than that, there's just some light grain. The taste is the same with some very mild sweetness and a bit of citrus. Light body. Drinks fine, but really is nothing to even say about this other than that it is quite plain."
"This clear golden ale is New Belgium's summer seasonal, and it's among the brewery's lighter offerings. The flavor is mild and malty, with a slight hoppy character and a hint of citrus. Oddly, I place this one curiously between a traditional lager and a pale ale. It's certainly tasty, and unique. Like most of New Belgium's employee-(and Earth-) friendly brews, this one's quite satisfying."
"Light and has a great taste, very chuggable. I was really impressed with this beer, at first I was skeptical but it turned out delicious."
"I see some high marks for this beer. Wonder if I got a glass from a bad keg. But nothing terrible...just bland. Tastes like a beer but with lots of extra water."
"Drinkability: It is made to be drinkable on a warm day: low in alcohol, soft in taste, as rich in colour as a setting summer sun."
"although as a lower calorie and low abv beer, it does have a lot of flavour and body and mouthfeel going for it, so i'm in a bit of a conundrum as how to rate it. my feeling is that it looks great, smells good, tastes ok, has a nice mouthfeel but drinks hard. weird."
"D: This is a great summer beer. Nicely balanced and drinkable, this will definitely quench thirst after a long, hot day. While nothing spectacular, this is a solid beer with a good amount of flavor and refreshment. Cheers!"
"D- A very nice drinkable and sessionable beer. Certainly an interesting take on the summer seasonal. I must compliment NB in that I was very worried that the advertised lime flavor would be too central to this beer, but it was constructed in a way that was well balanced and enjoyable. Could certainly use some tweaking, but it's pretty good and refreshing both in theory and practice."
"D - Pretty well rounded offering. The flavours are nicely balanced, and there's nothing to complain about."
"An interesting offering - the mild, but weird citrus, matched with the biscuity malt, makes for one crisp beverage, to use New Belgium's lingo. However, it gets a little watery towards the end, making this easy to drink, but also easy to forget."
"Passed to me at a BBQ. Pours an interesting amber with a decent head that doesn't last. Smells lightly of hops, but with a different citrus beneath it. The taste has the same interesting undertone, and when I read the label kaffir lime leaf is mentioned... There we go. Crisp and finishes nicely. An enjoyable brew to quaff poolside in the summer."
"Transparent copper brew with a solid off-white head and rings of lace. Malt backbone is subdued in the taste to give way for an assertive, pine hop. There is also an off flavor here that I can't quite put my finger on (garlic maybe?) Anyways, its not too pleasant. Light to medium-bodied and drying on the tongue. Overall, pretty average beer. Won't be buying it any time soon."
"Drinks well. Another good beer to possibly wean BMC drinkers to better beers. A solid, if unspectacular offering from a solid brewery."
"I don't think anybody goes into a beer like this expecting something mindblowing, however, if you're looking for a summer refresher that is easy sipping...well this is your beer."
"The label also says it is full-bodied. I didn't think a 4% abv beer could be full-bodied... and I still don't. It could pass for medium. Again though, just like the smell foretold, the taste and mouthfeel are not strong but not bad. A surprising amount of bitterness and overall kick. Lots of flavor. One of the best beers I've had at under 5%! Definitely recommended for a summer session."
"So, of course a beer that lacks definitive flavor is going to take it's lumps from me. But I think this is decent for what it set out to be - a light summer beer that will keep you in skinny-dipping shape."
"Taste, a little spring floral feel, minor twang of carbonation and lemon. A good, marginal palate cleanser between heavier styles. Easy to drink, but what really are you paying for with this beer?"
"At the Flying Saucer in Memphis, TN. Into a pint glass, it poured a clear golden hue with a thin white, collapsing quickly but leaving good lacing. Modest carbonation. Smelled of apple, pear, slight menthol, and earthiness. The taste was a little more pronounced; apple/pear dissolving to some woody leaves, and then finishing on a grassy/minty note. A rather odd flavor mix, and rather thin too. Easy texture to drink, but not an easy flavor to appeciate."
"The flavors and aromas are mild and not terribly complex, and the malt is a bit full, but this is a fine, if unspectacular summer brew. And perhaps the first ""blonde"" that I've really enjoyed enough to not avoid revisiting."
"Overall, a good beer. I'm a big fan of New Belgium and this is the first time I have had anything other than Fat Tire and 1554. This is certainly a lighter beer, makes sense that it's their summer ale. Overall drinkability - very good. I could certainly have a few of these on a hot summer day. It's not too hoppy, and it's crisp with a full mouth feel."
"Drinks: passably. Not a bad summer drink, but also one that will probably not find it's way into my fridge again unless my roommate decides to pick up another pack."
"New Belgium Skinny Dip is a decent beer for the summer season. I've had a few summer beers lately and I would say this beer is comparable to Honey Moon or Sam Adams Summer Ale. Skinny Dip has the typical citrus flavor that the other summer beers have. It is pretty easy to drink too. I would drink this beer again."
"Overall I'd call this one very average. It is what it is, which is a light, refreshing summer beer. Still, you can easily get similar, but better beers."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"Highly drinkable, a good sessionable beer to drink a lot of on a warm day. Pretty good beer all in all."
"Very light and bubbly in the mouth this is a good solid beer for a hot summer day, but not something I'll be seeking out too often - just not enough going on to interest me all that much."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. I hadn't heard good things about this beer, but I don't know what those people were talking about. I found it very enjoyable, would definitely get this again."
"Drinkability: This beer was much better than I expected. This is also the most complex ""refresher"" beer I have had as far as flavor. A great beer to have around because it tastes good, or just to have to refresh yourself."
"Skinny Dip has a light straw color and a fairly subdued head that quickly vanishes. The usual New Belgium biscuity malt is present, but it is not near as prevalent as in most of their brews. The taste is citrusy and light. I found the carbonation to be a little low and the mouthfeel a little thin. It's a fine beer to relax with in the sun, but really not complex enough or tasty enough for me to want another. I think it is outclassed by many other summer seasonals."
"12 ounce bottle, best before September 12, 2010. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a clear golden/amber color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention is average with a good amount of lacing. There's a nice unique citrusy aroma in this brew, I guess it's the kaffir lime leaf (as stated on the label) that I smell. There's also some sweet malt and hops noticable, too. For the most part the taste is the same as the aroma, but there's the addition of some bready malt flavor in this beer. There's also a slight bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's crisp with good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's nice and enjoyable. I liked this brew, it was a pleasant surprise. I'll have to buy some more the next time I see it since it's not available in Ohio."
"wont have any trouble finishing of the second bottle that is left."
"D - You know, it's an ok beer but it just doesn't do it for me. Drinkability is fair for what it is, but it's not an offering from New Belgium I'd go to often, if ever again."
"M/D: light bodied no drying effect and decent drinkability not NB's best but good"
"Poured an almost clear golden color with a sea foam-like head that is minimal. Smell is EXTREMELY close to the smell of Fat Tire... New Belgium tends to have that same malty smell/taste with some of their beers. Strong sweet malt smell (typical New Belgium smell, excluding Lips of Faith). No hops whatsoever. Taste is a little watered down...tastes more watery than Fat Tire, but at the same time it is a bit better tasting to me. This beer is a great summer beer and with a name like ""Skinny Dip", it has to be. Mouthfeel isn't too impressive, but I could drink a sixer of this to myself EASILY."
"D - easy to drink, good with backyard food fare."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle (best before 9/12/10) into a Sam Adams perfect pint. Pours a clear light copper color with a white fluffy head that dissipates into a thin layer but leaves some lacing, also has good carbonation. Has a very light malt aroma. Very light sweet malt with some breadiness in the end and a clean yeast flavor. Light to medium bodied with moderate hop bitterness. Easy to drink on a warm summer night."
"Drinkability No thanks."
"Notes: I found Skinny Dip to be similar to New Belgium's polarizing flagship beer, Fat Tire. One could easily mistake Skinny Dip for Fat Tire if they weren't paying attention. That's not a problem since I'm in the camp that says Fat Tire is a decent beer. In fact, Skinny Dip might be a slightly better beer overall because it contains the positive attributes of Fat Tire while having a higher drinkability."
"Grainy with cereal notes and a light bittersweet hop edge. The hops are light but tastefully mixed in. The malt is well mixed as well and this is just a humble, clean and easy drinking summer beer."
"Tasty seasonal and a nice take on a blonde ale but nothing to write home about."
"D - This would be a great summer brew if the flavor was kicked up more, very easy drinking but needs more flavor."
"(D)- For a session brew, its good. Putting away a 6pk would be a piece of cake, but would I want to is another question. Fits the style well though in its defense."
"I drank this on tap into a pint glass...The beer pours a light clearish brown with a light white head, no head or lacing worth mentioning...The aroma is nothing, a little skunky hops...The taste is horribly boring, no taste which is worsened by a horrible feel that is so light it makes it totally undrinkable. This beer is horrible."
"Drinkability: Reasonably refreshing, with a nicely crisp carbonation and low amount of alcohol to keep things quaffable, though, sadly, I'm not particularly keen on the mix of flavors here."
"All in all a great summer beer for outdoor activities like softball, BBQ's or working in the yard. One of my favorites from new belgium and certainly the best light beer I've ever had."
"D: Not the worst thing I've ever had, but incredibly forgettable and uninteresting."
"D- I don't know about this one. I like the lighter crisp tastes and smell, I don't like the off balance lime side. I'm totally on the fence about this one."
"As far as mouthfeel & drinkability, I think they're OK for a light beer. It drinks like seltzer, but it kind of boring to drink more than one."
"Poured into a pint glass, golden amber color, white head that dissipates to a thin white sheen. Good lacing. The smell is a little citrusy. Taste is grassy and bready, but not heavy. There's a hint of lime. Good carbonation, easy going and an overall great summer beer."
"D: yes"
"a great session beer for a sunny day, good to bring to that bbq where you dont want to offend the uninitiated."
"D - Really a quite compelling take on a light summer brew. I drank this several times over the summer, and it goes down very easily and is very refreshing. Just enough flavor to be interesting, but so light. Great for an afternoon at the pool, or after mowing the lawn. Definitely not a favorite choice, but well executed for the ""skinny dip"" session beer they intended to create."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: I like my brew with intense flavor and this brew was ok as is does give a small kick of hops at the end. Could see myself drinking this beer on a hot summer day with some chips and salsa."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - For such a lite beer, New Belgium manages to pull in big flavor & quality, which was very impressive to me. This is a highly sessionable brew that appeals to the masses, it doesn't fill you up, and has enough complexity to leave you wanting more. I really enjoyed it, I would have appreciated more bite in the feel, but it's ok. Very well priced, id pick up a 6pack to try, very balanced beer. Cheers!"
"Overall: Another pretty solid offering from New Belgium. I wouldn't run out to buy it again soon but I would drink it again if I had more."
"It's pretty average, and the burnt taste on the palate is very unwelcomed."
"Anyway its odd but drinkable in hot weather..recommends it be served at 3 degrees C on the label"
"Only a few bottles left at the store, hadn't gotten around to trying so picked one up. Poured into a glass, clear amber, adequate head. Citrus and malt aromas, very nice. Taste is refreshing, more citrus and malt, not a lot of hops, finishes dry. Not a big beer, but that's not what they're trying to do with this."
"d- not really my style, but i can appreciate it. to me, this is very similar to a fat tire but without all the sweetness. i would prefer this over a tire, anyways. pretty refreshing."
"D - Easy to drink, easy to share."
"Good for converting Corona and Bud Lime fans of the light beers with a bit o' citrus. I wouldn't mind a one of these after yardwork in the hot sun. Not the first thing I'd reach for--not bad, but not quite a blond ale, either."
"So not a bad beer, but not particularly exciting by any means. Appearance is very clean looking pale orange color with almost no head or lacing. Smell and taste are pretty bland, slight citrus- mild hops and probably prima pils malt. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. Drinkability is on par for the style."
"D: very drinkable and refreshing. Not as hoppy as I was expecting, in a good way. Seems like a milder version of NB's Mighty Arrow. I'd pick up a six of this any summer day!"
"The mouth is crisp and well-carbonated. Flavor is nice and balanced with sweet malts at the forefront, and it finishes with just a touch of bitterness. This is very unoffensive and pretty good. This would be a great 'crossover' brew for the BMC drinker."
"mid to light body. enough carbonation. nice beer. will check it out again next year."
"D- Drinkable, but not my style...a decent offering for the ""lawn mower"" beers...on a hot summer day. Clean and basic, nothing to out of the ordinary on this one, wouldn't stand out in a crowd like some blondes..."
"Bought this to throw back today while I have pork shoulder out on the smoker.Poured into a nonic a fuller golden color than I expected I have to admit,I large fluffy white head atop.Very light aromas mainly some light toast and caramel,the cascades talked about on the bottle are pretty non existent.Mouthfeel isnt bad for such a lighter beer not quite full but it isnt watery either,flavors seem to lack any oomph,some toast and light caramel/ biscuit-like sweetness with a shot of herb in the finish.It is what it is and its pretty good for what it is."
"Still yet another attempt to find a great summer beer, with this being one of the best this year. The beer pours into a deep amber with a one finger head that last longer than most summer beers I have had. It has a very slight citrus smell and even less of a citrus taste. It has a mild flavor with just a slight sharpness on the tongue. This was one of the highlights of my summer beer quest."
"D: Wow. Lets send a sixer of these 100 feet deep to chill and haul them up and have them on the lake in the summer sun."
"This is from a new belgium mixed pack and overall NB gets a meh."
"This beer pours a nice clear copper color with a 1 finger of rocky, creamy off white head. Ringlets of lacing coat the glass. Nose is of grains, adjuncts, and a touch of caramel malts. Taste is very grainy, some pale malts, with some spicy hops in the finish. Medium body, medium carbonation, clean crisp feel. It's not a phenomenal beer, but one you could sit with for an evening."
"Very clear and sparkling. Very little residual head. Smell was standard New Belgium smell. Of which I love, but nothing extraordinary. Slight citrus smell. Taste was very good, very good indeed. Very light and crisp. Refreshing all the way down. No off flavors or bittering as you would expect Very good. Did I type that already. Mouthfeel was average. Not quite as New Belgium as the other New Belgiums. Very easy to drink and drink again."
"Tasting reveals much like the nose a strong earthy, malty flavor followed quickly by biscuit and finishing with hops and a small bit of lime. A refreshing beer, but I guess I just want a bit more malt followed up with a bit more hops. Is crisp and refreshing, and very good for a light beer alternative. Would make a great summer drinker."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with strong carbonation."
"This poured clear, dark gold with some off-white head. It smelled almost identical to Fat Tire, with roasted barley, faint copper hops, and bready yeast. It tasted similar to Fat Tire also, with dominant barley malt followed by some copper hops and bready yeast. Although this one had a hint of lime, and the barley wasn't as roasty or rich. It was slightly thick with a fair amount of carbonation, and a mild aftertaste. Overall this was more of a summer amber ale than a blonde ale, with too much in common with Fat Tire. That includes the generally boring character of the other beer, making this one also rather bland and forgettable. I suppose this one is at least a decent summary variation of the classic, but I'd honestly prefer neither."
"Looks better than it tastes. Toasted oats flavor with a dry finish. Chewy mouthfeel. Hops are there, but muted to say the least. Strong corn flavor. Not anything special here and I think this is the second time I have tried it out and not been impressed. This one will be my last. Better luck next time."
"The body was medium-light and smooth. The beer was very drinkable, but why would you? If you're buying beer at some out of the place, this would be better than going macro, but otherwise avoid."
"i'm not a huge blonde ale fan and am also disappointed at the number of mainstream beers this ""well regarded"" brewery comes out with. this beer is just not worth getting except for the bottle that reminds one of their better offerings. Mediocre color, smell and taste. I wouldn't bother."
"Drinkability is good if u consider you could down several of these no problem, the problem is why would u really want to."
"This was a pretty good beer in my opinion. Pours a nice orangish color with not much of a foam head and not much for lacing either. I'm normally a fan of more extreme beers but this is a nice light tasting and refreshing brew. Seems like a good beer to go sit outside by the pool with which is exactly where I plan to go next."
"This is a watered down Fat Tire (which is pretty watered down to begin with). Not bad, but New Belgium does much better."
"Nice easy drinking beer. If I was to compare it to my favorite light beer....Sam Adams Light this would win hands down."
"The sweet malt ultimately wins out in the flavor; and this is a very nice/easy drinking beer. Great for summer outings where you may be having multiple beverages. Not to mention, who doesn't love an American Blonde?"
"not the best, nor the worst. very sweet and very middle of the road."
"D - This is quite a nice and refreshing blonde ale. I'm glad I was able to try it on a modestly warm day. I don't think I'd enjoy it too much in the winter though - but blonde ales are summer lawnmowing beers and this fits the bill."
"It's easy to be hard on this beer but it's really pretty good when you consider it's a light summer beer. Nothing to knock anyone's socks off but certainly good enough for a barbeque."
"Pours a nice amber hue with a fluffy white head. Smell is faint hops and faint malt and faint spices. Taste is very crisp and sweet and a tad sticky hoppy citrusy piney. Mouthfeel is even a little creamy which is nice for a style this light because it adds to the experience. Drinkability is just fine."
"Its lagerish in its crispness and tart finish, but doesn't really deliver anything special whatsoever. Don't care for this one really at all."
"Notes: This isn't bad but it's not great either. Would make a good session beer because it is good enough to enjoy but very easy going down."
"Good seasonal and I might reach for it if it's there during a picnic or cookout."
"The mouthfeel is very nice. I don't agree with the bottle because it reads that the skinny dip is a full-bodied beer. I'd put it thin to medium at best. The finish is quite nice with a beefy carbonation making it a little dry and acidic. Almost soda like. Clean and refreshing, a real treat on a hot day."
"D: Super easy to quaff down. Low ABV makes this a really nice session beer. Will see this in my fridge more often."
"A thirst quenching beer, nice on a hot summer day."
"I hadn't tried anything New Belgium before, so I bought one of everything they had at the Food City in Pigeon Forge when I was there on vacation. I didn't know how I would like it given the description, but I gave it a shot. The beer is advertised as a summer beer and it did not disappoint. The pour was great, a bright reddish gold with a fluffy white head that stuck around til the end. There wasn't much aroma from the beer, just a generally malty beeriness, but the kaffir lime made its presence known when I picked up the glass up to my mouth. I couldn't really identify any single element that made me like this beer so much, but I like the balance of the malt, hops, citrus, and the carbonation. The beer had good complexity, with the hop bitterness first, then the fullness of the malt, and finishing with the fruit. I liked it all, in my opinion much better than the rest of the brewer's offerings (i.e. Fat Tire). The beer was smooth and light but also very satisfying. I would buy again if it were ever available to me again!"
"Pours a clear, copper/golden color. One inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of strong earthy malt and slight hop. Fits the style of an American Blonde Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong earthy malt, slight sweet malt, and slight hop. Overall, too earthy in flavor for my taste."
"Particularly for a light, ""blonde"" ale, this beverage is undrinkable. You would NEVER want two in a row. For a summery brew trying to associate itself with frivolous fun (read: getting naked), that is ridiculous. From start to finish, I feel like this beer's a phony imposter. I'd consider having another one only to confirm that it sucks."
"M/D: Fuller body than expected, very creamy. Very drinkable. Overall, nothing special, but a very accessible beer and entirely refreshing for a summer day."
" I don't get anything resembling the cascade and kaffir lime scented brew the label promised. I understand this one is trying to come in with low calories and carbs, but that is no excuse for underhopping."
"The flavor is much the same as the kaffir lime leaves are a bit too overpowering, especially with the already citric nature of cascade hops. It is pretty thirst quenching and easy to drink. Malts do very little in the flavor, might be nice with a bit more caramely sweetness and body. Overall, it is a decent summertime beer, and worth a try to see if the citrusy flavors work for you."
"12oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a crisp amber with a thin diminishing head that lasts as barely a thin layer and leaves very slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is is loads of citrus hops and lime, almost reminiscent of lime kool-aid. The taste is a nice subtle blend of sweet malts, sweet fruit and citrus hops. The beer is very light, crisp, well carbonated and very sessionable. This one makes for a great summer beer."
"Drinkable on a tolerably warm day."
"D - Quite drinkable, only it's got some flavors I'm not particularly fond of. When ice cold, this could be a great, flavorful alternative to a lot of the production lagers out there. I'm not much for the taste, but it's inoffensive enough for anyone to enjoy."
"The drink is light-bodied with lively carbonation and a very easy drinker. A nice hot weather beer I'd like to see in cans!"
"Not the worst, but definitely not impressed. Won't buy again. Try other folks' summer brews and save yourself some cash."
"Sweet and grainy to start with, then a bit of chewy yeast. The hops are there, sure, but not really adding much. This one has a bit of a wierd aftertaste. The dry finish is refreshing like a summer brew should be, but its just a bit too powdery. It'll replace a macro light beer easily enough...but doesn't do justice beyond that."
"i have yet to find an american blonde ale that i enjoyed and i doubt i ever will"
"Not the best beer I have ever had. New Belgium makes better and there are certainly better examples of the style out there. Cant say I would get this one again."
"Drinkability: This beer is too yucky to drink very many."
"Almost water thin in texture with a tint of metal in the aftertaste. Some fruit on a palate of light malts and a tiny hint of hops. Somewhat over carbonated but still refreshing. Drinkable but nothing special."
"Mouthfeel is light but not overly so. An easy drinker. Will I buy it again? No."
"Pours a light orange color with a nice two-finger head on it, retention is decent and there's some lacing. The smell is nothing special for the style, some citrus and caramel malt. The taste is about the same, not bad but not amazing. Mouthfeel is fairly standard, well carbonated and light bodied. Overall it's a good summer beer that you can sit and enjoy and focus less on the beer and more on some activity."
"D: Light, refreshing ale. Definitely a beer for a hot summer day outside. Pretty good for a summer seasonal, but that is the only time I would probably drink it - outside in the summertime."
"Not a bad summer beer that is very easy to drink. There certainly is room for improvement here."
"Pours a very light golden red color, clear, can see the carbonation bubbles. Big foamy white head, medium sized bubbles, somewhat lasting, good lacing. Malty aroma, later aroma of hops, citrus. malts, some hops, slightly bitter, slightly acidic aftertaste, slightly nutty, fizzy. Light tasting, but not much flavor."
"Pours a clear golden color with a white head that quickly thins. The smell is typical, but there is something about it that makes me do a double take. Can't put my finger on it, it makes me curious. Not a very impressive taste, just average. Malts and grains and the faintest hop bitterness. Good carbonation and a thin body lead to a good mouthfeel and a fairly drinkable beer."
"This is more of a Belgian Lite. Clear gold pour with a frothy white head. Funky aroma of earthy malt and bitter hops, mixed with lime and oranges. Yeast, wheat, and weak hops with a pleasant and clean citrus end. Refreshing, but not spectacular. Its a blonde, after all"
"M/D - This is definitely a beer that could be consumed over and over. Its a light drinking beer and very easy to drink. Nothing to exciting, but a good session brew on a hot summer day."
"This American style Blonde Ale was actually a Light Ale in disguise and out of a bottle it poured a nice amber orange color. The head was white, fluffy and two fingers thick leaving nice lacing as it went down. A great looking light ale! The aroma was also pleasant, citrus hops and the earthy malt one fins in most New Belgium beers. The flavors were a little odd, a distinctly lime dominated at first with grainy malt and some tangy yeast behind that. Hints of lemon from the hops later appeared. The body was very light and the carbonation high (as per usual with Light beers). This one impressed me, for the style I have to put it up with Sam Adams as one of the best Light beers being made."
"I really enjoyed this beer after having a few. At first I was not too sure about the Skinny Dip but after the weekend of New Belgiumism I decided this one was a pretty decent selection. Should be made into the full year round brew but unfortunately it is only a summer brew. too bad so sad. I believe this one has a lot of hope it does have quite a bit of potential not being to light but not having a bitter feel."
"D- Light beer makes for water-like drinkability"
"This beer has a nice 2 ½ fingers of frothy off white head with an orange tint. The body is a copper color with some great lace. It has a strong citrus like aroma. The taste is very seasoned and malty. A little more bitter than malty though. The mouthfeel is almost medium bodied but not much. I thought this was a great beer."
"Skinny dip is a very refreshing summer beer. It has a very clear amber apperance and its aroma is very citrusy and sweet. It has a slight nutty flavor that comes through with the sweetness of the malts and finishes with the suttleness of the cascade hops and lime flavors. This is an easy drinking beer, great for after some hot yard work."
"D - Very drinkable and refreshing. Good for a pretty light beer."
"Pours a deep golden color. Has a strong malty aroma. Has a good balance of maltiness and bitterness up front followed by some citrusy earthy undertones on the end. Is lighter than it appears and taste. Drinkability is good, however it was maltier than I first expected for a summer brew. I have to say that I am partial on the review since I got a whole 1/2 barrel keg for...uh, FREE!!! At first I thought this kind of tasted like a ""Fat Tire Light"" if there was such a thing. After drinking it for a few days I thought that it would be labeled as an APA...I was suprised that it is a Blonde!"
"This beer pours a clear bronze color. The head is an inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of caramel malt and not much else. It isn't bad, but it is not very interesting. The taste is like the aroma. It is pleasant and all, but there is nothing there is make me want to take another sip. The mouthfeel is slightly lighter than medium bodied, and had nice carbonation. Overall, this beer is another let down from New Belgium. I will not be drinking this again."
"D. NOthing special here i found having acouple i was over it"
"This was the last bottle on the store shelf in late Sept. but happily the summer flavours were still intact. This is a mid gold beer with a huge head. The nose is slight citrus and more malt than hops. The beer is smooth and fairly malty ( age maybe?) but very drinkable and the citrus comes off on the finish. Decent patio beer that has a good malt backbone."
"Drinkability is extremely nice in this one. It keeps you coming back for more, as it's got just enough bitter hops and sweetness from the grain for a balanced attack of delight."
"Easy drinker and surprisingly complex for style. Nice with summer foods (like my salad)."
"Skinny Dip is a well made summer beer. It'd crisp, fairly light, quaffable and refreshing. A good beer from a great brewery. Porch beer defined."
"A pretty decent beer."
"That pint was gone before I knew it. Funny, the bartender wanted me to taste a sip before allowing me to take possession of the pint, as the bar was awash in a sea of macro taps. I guess their patrons aren't used to drinking a beer as adventurous as this one (to the non BA palate, that is)."
"D: I feel like i'm being kind of harsh on this as it certainly isn't the worst choice, but the astringency, overpowering new belgium flavor/smell, and lack of citrus from good old hops has me thinking about what beer i'll drink next."
"D - Very drinkable and refreshing- Perfect summer beer. I could easily drink several of these in one night. Not a ton of flavor, but it's simple with some nice sweatness. A great light beer. I don't know how much these cost, but I assume it's around $7.50 a six- a reasonable price for a great drinking light beer. Solid Brew with a gorgous appearence."
"Drinkability: All summer ales are easy to drink. I'd rather drink a different one though."
"Light bodied, it is hoppier than expected, fruity, but still reasonably well balanced by some honey and nut notes. Easy to put down, but not exactly special. Still well crafted."
"Drinkability is moderate. This beer has decent flavor and is quite sessionable. Just boring."
"Big frothy white head on top this amber colored brew. Lots of lacing left on the glass as it's consumed. Wait a minute...is this a lower gravity Fat Tire? The more I drank of it, the more I thought so. The taste is dominant of toasted grain with bits of caramel and a finish of hop leaf. It's refreshing, it's simple, it's low in alcohol, and decent for what it is. Just don't expect any impressive flavors."
"M: very nice smooth mouthfeel with a nice aftertaste. this one sticks with you but isn't heavy. possibly the best blonde I've ever had."
"I would not recommend this beer."
"This is a suprisingly smooth, light beer. When I see a darker beer, I typically assume that it will be relatively thick/full compared to the lighter beers. They say to never judge a book by its cover; I would say that this best describes what to expect with this brew. I was shocked when I looked up the nutritional information for this beer at the New Belgium website - it only has ~114 calories! Considering that it's not a light beer, this just makes a great beer even more excellent."
"This pours an orangy amber with a thick, fluffy, persistent head. Aroma is strong and malty with a hint of soy. Flavor is malty with just a hint of hops and an undertone of soybeans, not complex but pleasing. Texture is smooth and just a little bit watery."
"D - Very nice and goes great on a hot summer day."
"D- A very refreshing brew. The lime isn't overpowering to the point of hurting my throat as that of blue moon's seasonal, rising moon. The lime plus the very faint citrus taste were great and at 4.2% abv this is a great session beer. I could imagine BMC drinkers liking this, well maybe(there could be too much flavor for them)."
"The taste is pretty bitter, lots of the earthy, woodsy qualities I found in the nose transfer into the flavor. Overall, the feeling I get from this beer is fresh and crisp. This has served me well as a session beer, and I think I'll have a few more sixers of these by the time summer's over."
"Tasted on 6/1/08."
"Going with the local draft brew I found this to be a golden tan colored brew with a nice white head. Light notes of caramel malts and a touch of hops greet me upon first smell. the taste is light caramel malts, modest spicy / grassy hops with a hint of citric in the way background. Overall it quaffed easily and was nicely refreshing as I ended a long day of travel."
"Very sessionable with good flavor for a ""light beer."" Enjoyed a few pints on a nice summer evening, and the ladies seemed to find it very appealing."
"Clear amber. Slight frothy white head. Bubbly collar leaves some sparse patches of lace. Pretty nice whiff of the essence of beer, grains and bready maltiness. This beer's got some character for a golden ale. Nice malty base with some herbal hoppiness and even some slight yeast character. Good tasting Golden. Medium bodied and carbonated moderately. Good summer drinker."
"D: A micro for the macro drinker. That's all I could think about when I was consuming this. A very safe bet for someone looking to get their feet wet with microbrews."
"D: I will not be drinking this beer again as it just wasn't my bag. I have to say I've been disappointed by most New Begium brews I've had thus far."
"This isn't a beer I'll be loading up on, but if I'm in the mood for a light beer during the summer, I would definitely grab this again."
"I am not crazy about the Skinny Dip, but it's not a bad beer. I wouldn't turn my nose up at it at a party or out on the town if I saw it on tap. Nice refreshing ale - although it's not exactly what I would call a ""blonde ale," in color or in delivery. But what do I know. Worth a try, if you're making your way through Texas craft beers."
"Poured from the bottle into a tasting glass. The appearance is light amber in color with with light creamy head. The nose is very biscuity, with a nice balance of maltiness and the cascade hopes. The taste is initially malt sweetness and toasty, with a hint of citrus and hops. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, and slightly slippery. I think this is a wonderful summer session beer."
"D - I would probably not buy this again but those at the party I went to helped me finish my 6 pack. It was well received by others who mostly drink BMC beers. If you are looking for a good intro into the craft beer world, I guess this would be the ticket."
"D - This is a perfect example of what a summertime session beer should be good taste with a low abv thats easy to drink all day in the sun"
"This is my least favorite beer from New Belgium. At the same time, it probably gives them the best margin of profit. It is a pale yellow wit a tan head. The nose is of grainy malts and light hops. The flavor is light for a blond. Light feel leads to an overall light beer. I'd probably go for something cheaper if I was in th emood for this style."
"Skinny Dip is a exceptional session brew that is not only refreshing, but is perfect for those looking for the 'figure-friendly' alternative to those light or ultra beers this summer. If anyone cares, Skinny Dip is only 114 calories per 12oz serving."
"Poured a clear amber color with a moderate white head that disipates rather quickly but still leaves some traces of lace. The aroma is bready with just a suggestion of citrus. The taste is light bready malt with a trace of caramel and citrus. Slightly dry from the start, with a nicely dry citrus finish. Smooth and easy to take in quantity. I can think of other good blondes to spend my money on."
"I do enjoy more body to my brew, but when you're on the beach, hanging out at a backyard BBQ, or out mowing the yard in the haze of July, this is an excellent companion to have."
"Light color, but not too light. It seems to hit the mark for style. The smell had a decent hop aroma which I did not expect, from tasting this beer last year (maybe I forgot). The nutty malt flavor is reminiscent of Fat Tire and works well for the beer. This is a great Spring, Summer, Fall or Winter beer."
"12 oz bottle pours a clear amber body with two centimetersof offwhite head. Some spiderweb lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is muted. Citrusy hops and some toasted caramel. No lime leaf noted. A bit thin in the mouth. Taste has a subtle hop bitterness with grainy pale malts. Lackluster overall, perhaps a good crossover beer and one that would be a pleasant summer thirst quencher."
"I honestly did not mean to buy this beer today, early today, I pulled one out of a Mothership Wit 6-pack and tonight .... bam .... A beer that I had no intention of buying. That being said, I am very glad I revisited it. ALL my notes from this brew say how much I don't like it.. but sitting here trying to be objective, this is a damn good lite beer. Perfect for sitting in the sun or mowing the lawn, or simply wanting a beer with real flavor and not wanting to get hammered."
"A mild nose with not much to it, you get a somewhat thick and staying mouthful of slight bitterness with just a touch of citrus brew. It's a seasonal released in spring and it is September as I am drinking it, so who knows how that would affect the taste (it says it is good before December 6th). Overall I can't say I would look forward to it next year. That slight edge of bitter and the overall citrus edge to it isn't for me and it lacks the right punch to be considered anything but just being ""somewhat good""."
"Clear, orange in color. Average size white head. Some lacing. Citrus hops in the aroma. Light and refreshing beer. It is indeed a great summer brew. However, it is too light for my naste. Little hoppy bitterness produces nice mouthfeel. I will gladly enjoy this beer on a hot summer day. Perfect ""light"" beer."
"D- Overall I was not impressed with this beer at all; it is not on the top of my list from New Belgium Brewing. The only thing that I can say that sums up this beer for me is that I only drank half of it, and would not chooses it again."
"Pours a clear amberish, almost a rusty water color. The head is about two and a half fingers of creamy white head with good retention a leaves lots of lacing. Aroma has the typical New Belgium yeast smell to it along with some lime. Not a very strong aroma. Taste is sort of grainy along with more lime and a faint touch of toasted malt. Very bitter and not a lot of malt to balance it out. Mouthfeel is thin and fizzy with a dry finish. The dryness and bitterness definitely bring the drinkability down. Not one I would really care to purchase again. Kind of like watered down Fat Tire with lime juice."
"D: Very high. A great beer for a hot summer day."
"A 50/50 mix of this with my other non-blonde ale (blue frog blonde ale) and you might be getting close to the actual style..."
"A lighter ale, the New Belgium Skinny Dip is a good choice when looking for a beer that has a sweeter taste, with a slight bite in the aftertaste. served from a bottle, the beer produces a medium head that I would say has a medium thickness that lasts more than a few moments. the color is a clear light amber-orange, and the lightness is reflected in the taste. like other ales, the smell is more bitter than the taste, but both are exceptional. The beer is very smooth and carbonation goes unnoticed while drinking, unlike lite incarnations of many beers. this is a very drinkable beer, not one that makes you not want to stop, but it is very good and pleasant nonetheless. Altogether, Skinny Dip is a very enjoyable, light summer beer."
"party. It's too bad winter's on the way."
"As much of this stuff as I have consumed this summer, I thought I had allready reviewed the brew. Anyhow, pours a rich light amber color with a nice cream colored head. First impressions speak of toasty biscuit, some light hop and a citrus finish on the lemon-lime side. Fairly well carbonated and refreshing as a summer seasonal should be. I have found it very satisfying after mowing the yard, catching some fish, bar-b-queing and finally this fall, downing a few birds afield. Serve this one icy cold. mmm. And word has it - same carbs and calories as some of the rediculous offerings of the big three. A great light choice..."
"D- This beer has a big biscuit malt flavor which grows a bit mundane after a few sips but the hops, although soft, have a nice depth and this is really the best use of kefir lime leaves I have tasted. They offer a nice compliment to the hops without being overbearing or buried."
"Drinkability: This beer is highly drinkable despite being unbalanced in taste. The beer is very refreshing and paired nicely with the spicy pad thai that I had. Its citrus notes are very plesant and are not overpowering and only a mild alcohol sting comes through as the beer warms."
"Okay, but thin. I suppose it does have more to offer than a typical light or macro brew, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"This is fine drinking beer for friends--nothing extreme, nothing special either."
"Medium bodied, very refreshing the kaffir lime leaves seem to lend a interesting bay leaf/ citrus note. Reminds me of fat tire with a bit more chutzpah."
"Thanks, brewjones"
"Bought a six pack for 7.99 at a local grocer. Liked fat tire so thought I'd give it a try. Appearance is similar to fat tire wit the dark amber and medium buble carbonation that stays for a long time on the edge of the glass. Hints of citrus with hops make a bouquet not unlike the Fat Tire cousin but the taste is not as impressive as Fat Tire. Easily drinkable and smooth with appropriate carbonation. Guess this is for people who want Fat Tire light- had I known this, I'd have purchased the original Fat Tire since it is all around a better beer for the value."
"A nice summer offering, not great but certainly worth a try."
"Decent summer and seemed to be selling well everywhere"
"Overall, I enjoyed it a lot and recommend it."
"Surprisingly, the hops aren't the first thing I noticed in the flavor. The pale malt is front and center, lightly sweet with a creamy mouth. The cascade kicks in lightly for balance but this beer is far less crisp than I was expecting and finishes very clean. More sweet in the finish than dry."
"7 g carbs"
"I tried this on tap at the Burger Bar in the Mandalay Bay resort in Las Vegas. It was described to me as a summer wheat beer, but really it seemed to be just a light and easy to drink ale. The beer was pale straw color and crystal clear, with a lightly hopped aroma. The taste was basically neutral, maybe a touch of citrus character from the hops (or from the lime that's added during production [fermentation?] according to the website). Extremely easy on the palate and probably a very good barbeque beer."
"A nice summer sipping beer on a cool day. Works well with a light salad. Added lime is an interesting touch in the style. Worth a try for something with a different approach to the style."
"Overall a good beer to drink. Very refreshing in a 2-3 beer setting."
"After reading other reviews and checking newbelgium.com I see this is a light beer - lower alcohol, less calories, low carbs. Even higher marks for a tastey, not watered down lighter beer - ""a full-bodied, figure friendly beer that's designed for the summer dress code."""
"Pours to a half-inch white head and gold color. Aroma is sweet, malty and a bit bready with typical ""Fat Tire"" esters. Flavor is much like Fat Tire with the distinctive yeast signature and grainy malt backbone with a hop character that is more like a pilsner. Finishes clean and refreshing. A pretty good beer to have if you don't mind the nod to it's darker sister beer."
"This New Belgium offering pours a crystal clear amber liquid, atop of which floats a spotty fluffy head. Lots of carbonation trails. Smell is malty bread. Some hoppy lime elements. Taste is essentially Fat Tire with a bit more hops and the afore mentioned hint of lime. Fairly bland. Mouthfeel is crisp and somewhat refreshing. Drinkability is fair, I'm just not a fan of this brew."
"D: Very light and smooth - a good summer beer, I may buy again, I don't know for sure, just slightly above average for me."
"D- Easy to drink [especially on a hot summer night]. I can see having 6 or more of these on hand for the summer. Except you can't get this stuff in MASSACHUSETTS..."
"I wish the kaffir lime was a little more pronounced, but I enjoyed this a great deal, and will keep a six in my fridge at all times this summer to flip some light beer drinkers... ""same calories and carbs as bud light!"""
"Drinkability: Great. This is as close to Bud Light as I ever want to get! Really refreshing and smooth."
" Pours an orangish amber color topped by a pinky finger's worth of creamy white head. Aroma of lightly sweet malt, apricot sweetness, and a touch of citrusy aromatic hops. Palate is well-balanced between light malt and lightly citrusy hops, but there's not all that much there. Finish is dry and a little chalky. This definitely goes down easy on a hot summer night, but it leaves a bit to be desired."
"Decent thickness to the mouthfeel although the watery taste can't help but make the mouthfeel seem almost thin. I don't really get this beer. It doesn't taste bad but it just doesn't taste like much. I hope this isn't a sign that New Belgium is setting the bar lower as it expands across the Mississippi."
"While this beer is light and easy to drink it's a little too light for me even for the summer. If America started drinking this instead of Miller or Bud Lite/Light, I would be the happiest guy in the world, but at $10 a six pack I need a little more substance."
"Had this on tap in Colorado so it was very fresh. Poured into a pint glass with a great fluffy head. Taste had just a hint of citrus with some good hop bitterness coming through as well. It was very refeshing and drinkable. I enjoyed this beer and its worth a try."
"Drink cold and fast for best results."
"Pours clear light copper with orange and gold tones. Large and foamy barely-off-white head; quickly dies down to chunky bubbles with medium lacing. Aroma is of shortbread and buttery malts, distant floral hops and a noticeable doughy yeast element. Mouthfeel is light-bodied and crisp. Flavor is sour, crisp, and pleasing: bready malts backed by sourdough and wheat notes; a notable strain of citrus (lime) in back. Some pleasant earthiness and hop spice along with buttery malts round out the finish. Aftertaste is crisp and mildly sour."
"Overall, easy to drink. Quite refreshing and tasty on a hot Texas summer night. Good flavor for a ""light"" beer. Not terribly complex, but it isn't supposed to be."
"Overall decent effort but not spectacular. I'd drink it again no problem."
"12 oz bottle. This beer is a solid golden color with a finger of cream colored head that falls to a light coat over top. A healthy carbonation is streaming up through the very clear beer. The aroma is grainy, biscuity, and slightly lime citrusy. This has a very aggressive edge from the malt component that I just don't find appealing; this is an edge I associate with biscuit malt. The flavor starts with an aggressive husky grain and biscuity character with a zesty lime citrus character. I find the flavor to be a bit watered down after the initial kick. Mouthfeel is light with a moderate carbonation. This one is very easy to drink. It is light and refreshing. I'm not a huge fan of the flavor profile of the beer, but I think they are hitting what they want with it."
"While somewhat refreshing on it's own, as a beer this isn't so great. The lime and other citrus becomes very monotonous, and seems to drown out any other flavors that may be present."
"While I enjoyed this beer,it was not very exciting or unique. Very well made, but I was looking for more punch."
"Poured a crisp golden color with an inviting white head. Clean and mild aromas of grain and malt. This beer is light, yet packs a good amount of flavor considering. Besides the light malt character and touch of hops, there is also a spicy lime flavor that is very refreshing. Another solid brew fron New Belgium. Extremely thirst-quenching and drinkable."
"The beer has a great golden color to it. A slightly intense hop smell (which I love). The head seems to linger for a short time while retaining a thin lace. The taste in very rich, but not too overwealming. This beer is not very thick and not very filling, making it a very drinkable and overall great tasting beer."
"Cheers."
"Scoring based on light ESB"
"Golden amber color, and a nice head. Pillowy lacing lingers on top, and sticks pleasingly to sides of the glass. The smell suggests nothing beyond the fact that this is beer. The taste is a nice refresing splash of summery goodness. It must be the yeast at NB that lends the ""Fat Tire Light"" quality, as the biscuit vibe is here as well, but more subtle. The kaffir lime makes an appearance in the later stages of the taste. Mouthfeel is not exciting in any way, but crisp and refreshing. Not a particularly interesting beer, but a profoundly refreshing one, and that's what they were going for. Nice job!"
"D- Not a bad beer, but seemed kinda one dimensional in taste. They claim there should be quite a bit of Cascade hop character in this but I don't see it."
"Not a great beer, but drinkable and appropriate in many settings. Think of this as Fat Tire Light."
"Pours an orange amber color with a white head on top that fades into a moderate lace. Nose is citrusy hops and biscuity malt. Taste is bright and crisp with sweet caramel and bready malts along with citrusy hops and a hint of lime. A refreshing brew that would be nice on a hot day."
"Pours an amber color without much of a head, low carbonation. Nose is lightly fruited. Beer is refrshingly plain but enjoyable especially considering the low-calorie aspect and the tastes of this beer grouping. Taste of ripe apples. Wouldn't mind having a sixer of this in the summer, but if I am to go light, I'd still choose Sam Adams. Thanks to jhammerly for the bottle."
"This is a gentley bittered beer with mild acidic qualities in robust body of light grain flavor. There is a slight twang in the finish. This is extremely refreshing. The carbonation is lively and the mouthfeel is light. I get a slight citrusy sting."
"thanks to bditty187."
"This was brought to me with a big, rocky, bone-white head. The color was a deep gold with great clarity. The nose had a slightly sweet fruitiness to it. The mouthfeel was medium with a lightly malty aspect in the mouth. The finish was slightly dry and almost peppery. I found it to be very refreshing on a Nebraska evening in July."
"excellent summer beer that is far more interesting than most in its style."
"Drinkability: A sessionable beer on a summer day."
"Refreshing! I could definitely go for a few of these in summer - at almost any event - and probably during any other part of the year for that matter."
"Thanks to gbontrag for the bottle. Very clear pale orange body with light foam. Not a whole lot going on. The tastes are very subtle. Soft malts at the start, followed by a touch of bitterness. The finish is a bit harsh, with hints of corn syrup. It eventually softens again and leaves behind a nice grapefruit aftertaste. The mouthfeel is incredibly light. Airy with lots of carbonation. Highly drinkable. Light and refreshing, nothing too complex going on. I think this would go over well for people who are looking for a light beer that doesnt bring on nausea. Overall, a decent light microbew."
"Looks pretty good when poured. It's a clear amber color, with ok lacing. The nose is a little metallic, with cascade hops and not much else. The taste is like cornflakes, but not in a good way. Just very macro-tasting, and the mouthfeel is also macro-ey and thin. The drinkability is ok I guess, because there is nothing offensive about this beer. It just doesn't have much ""oomph."""
"Beer pours a golden orange color with a decent head. Nose is pretty non-descript malt with perhaps a slight hint of a sweet fruit. Taste is malty, slightly sweet, with a light hop finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thin with no special qualities. Drinkability is OK. This makes for a good social cocktail hour beer as one would get full before they would get 'faced with this brew."
"For an ale, this beer tastes very similar to a lager. This beer isnt exactly bursting with flavor either. Good to try, but not recommended. Nevertheless, a decent beer for a hot summer day."
"Pours a dirty blonde, more amber with hints of of sunshine. Decent bubbling and sparse, thin lacing. decent head and film The aroma was a little mettalic with some hints of bright, sweet ,malts. The first taste was preety bad. But I eventually warmed up to the battery end flavor with some very stale malts and musty hops."
"Nothing exceptional with this American Blonde Ale from NBB. When poured, it was a clear medium golden in color with a average amount of foam and very little lace. The smell of hops was very evident, in fact over powering. The taste was of cascade hops with a touch of spices with a hint of fruit. Not really that well balanced with all of the ingredients. The hops over powering taste masked the other flavors!"
"Smell and taste-- very nice. Not as exciting as the waitress' recommendation of it, but still a pleasant experience. Some nice citrus flavor that seemed to come and go. Light hops flavor, some bitter hints that seem to come and go amidst a bit of watery-ness, from what the description tells is Kaffir Lime Leaf. The beer went down smoothly, and far too quickly in the nice evening air."
"However, this can play in it's favor as a great summer session beer. The light body and mild malt and hop profile really lend this to be a refreshing beer on a hot august afternoon."
"Overall: Obviously set up to drink in the Summer, for sure, and it works well. A six-pack is a little expensive on the West Coast, but I would have no problems romping with the Skinny Dip Sextuplets should the price be right."
"I'll be the first to admit that I'm a bit of a New Belgium fanboy, but thats what happens when your first beer ever is a New Belgium Abby. This beer pours a dark orange, something I find quite pretty, and it had a nice creamy head. You can definatly smell lots of hopps and a slight sweetness. This beer has a slight tartness and a definate spicyness to it, though that could just be the nearly excessive carbonation, and its rounded out with a slight citrusy flavor. It has a bit of a watery mouthfeel, but that seems to add to the character of the beer. This is definatly a refreshing beer, one that you would drink after a long and hot day. I'm seriously considering taking a 6 pack (or two) down a river for some late season tubing. Overall, its enjoyable, but not one of New Belgium's best."
"Served to me in a pint glass. Has the color of brass with a moderate head that laces all the way down. Smell is mostly of hops and some lime. Nothing too special. Taste is of a solid malt backbone with hops and the kaffir lime. I don't get as much hop flavor as I do get the balancing bitterness, but the lime takes care of the finishing flavor. Somehow there's too much of that New Belgium house toast flavor. Mouthfeel is a bit watery. Decent overall."
"drinkability: well at 4.2 it's very, very light. My only knock would be that it's too carbinated. It slows you down, yet I think that it is a great aspect of this beer so I wouldn't change it. A damn fine beer, I would say is more of a light pale ale than a blonde, as it is really more hop than malt based. A good crowd pleaser no doubt. I can't believe I waited 'til the end of of summer for this one."
"After the forced slowdown, I grilled some Indian style chicken marinated in a tomato sauce. Served over rice and spiced with garam marsala, garlic, red chili, and coriander, the dish packed a not-so-subtle punch. This beer went perfectly with dinner. Apparently, the juxtaposition of countries worked well with my Americanized Indian dish and Belgianized American Blonde ale. Unlike most sweet or spicy dishes that usually compete with beer, especially hoppy beers, the sweet-spicy tomato sauce was brought to life by the juicy orange Skinny Dip which contributed its own aromatic spices. The hops in the beer were low enough profile-wise to allow the taffy malts to emerge without being too sweet. I'd definitely drink this again."
"This is one excellent Light Beer, and reminds me of Fat Tire. A Fat Tire with a splash of lime=Skinny Dip. This is a solid drinker, and living proof that light beers can be tasty."
"Overall Impression: A fairly complex, lighter beer. A good summer sipper with some Belgian overtones. Im glad to see they tweaked the Loft in a good direction."
"Worth a try."
"Skinny Dip may not be great beer, but it is great light beer. Although I can think of a few tweaks here and there, if I had to drink low calorie, low carbohydrate beer for the rest of my life (the stuff of nightmares, I know), then I'd begin, and probably end, with Skinny Dip."
"D: Easy to drink, a solid summer refresher. Not a ""wow"" beer, but after a hot day this does the trick."
"Amber orange in color, off white head dies quickly to a film, but lasts as such for the entire beer. Not like a dark roast of course, but a nice malty aroma, musty cascade hops almost like a German or Czech pils. The taste is quite sweet, with slightly toasted malt, accented nicely with the kafir lime leaf to give it a good zesty flavor and mouthfeel. They really used hops well in this too, fresh and a bit floral, but a bit musty and resinous. Nice crisp mouthfeel. Far from the dankest beer, but I feel like this one is put together very well. Simple beer all in all, but with just enough flavor to make it standout from other summer session beers."
"I will be looking for a six pack soon!"
"All around a great beer to quench a thirst with some simple but good flavors that don't overwhelm, in a good way."
"The"
"Very drinkable. With low alcohol content and good taste I think this would make an excellent session beer. This has to be one of the most flavoful beers with only 110 calories."
"Overall - nothing great, but more good than bad. Good enough to cool down with on a hot day - and an added crisp feeling."
"This is an American BLOND ALE  its not suppose to be an ass-kicker!"
"Drinkability- Very easy to drink. Very refreshing. Could drink a few of these easily."
"D - Very drinkable."
"Pours an orange copper with a white fizzy head that settles nicely into the session. The smell is of malts and a nice hint of citrus fruit with caramel glazed grain. The taste is light, hints of hops in the forefront that settle upon delicate but satisfying citrus flavors. This light bodied blonde went well at the beach on a gorgeous day, I think this beer speaks volumes for where light beer can go, at 110 calories and with a taste, this should serve as a solid stepping stone for light beers in the future."
"Drinkability: I waivered on this one going from average to good, and back to average again. This was not one I wanted a second pint of, but one I would have again. Definitely different from other blondes on the market."
"Poured a light golden brown with lots of head that quickly diminished. Very light hints of lime and malt in the smell. The mouthfeel and taste reminded me of a dressed up club soda with a slight hint of lime. This beer is drinkable, and would be great as a thirst quencher on a hot day. Otherwise, I found it relatively unremarkable."
"To give it a slightly larger market, I'd up the body a tad and tone back the flavoring and aroma hops. Hmm. Heck, I might even think it was pretty good, then!"
"D - Drinkable. A nice little brew from NB, would definitely recommend."
"Nice mouthfeel, goes down easy. VERY drinkable, especially on a warm and sunny Texas afternoon. I'd recommend with any type of backyard feasting, especially chicken or fajitas. If this truly is a ""lite""beer, it's the best I've ever had."
"Would I have another? No thanks, I don't find much here that really pleases me. For a beer of such low alcohol level it doesn't go down all that easily."
"Picked up a few New Belgium brews when I was in Omaha. This one would be a good beer to introduce to macrobrew drinkers. A few new flavors (for macro drinkers) but nothing outstanding. Very light and easy to drink, but there's just not a lot of flavor to this beer."
"Well, this is not the beer I tasted the first time. This one is pleasant, drinkable, and a nice choice for a summer afternoon."
"D: I hate grainy finishes, I really do. I wasn't a fan."
"The body is light and prickly with carbonation. The hops bitterness is just about right for such a brew. Drinkability is good. Very easy to put down several due to the low alcohol, but eventually I will seek out bolder flavors and fuller body (even during the summer)."
"Drinkability: Excellent. Whether having one slowly or one after the other it goes down easily, it doesn't leave any aftertaste or grow tiresome quickly. It's a pleasant taste/weight for your mouth all night."
"Extremely drinkable, I have quaffed many pints in a row at Crescent Moon. This is a really solid NBB beer. It is will be a stable in the summer. It is simply lovely. On an unrelated note, I love the artwork on the label. These notes were taken will imbibing at Crescent Moon in Omaha; it is worth checking out."
"A session brew to be sure. I won't be begging Colorado dwellers to be shipping this to me by the case but I wouldn't turn it down and would like to see this (and other New Belgium brews) nearby."
"This is a pretty beer, a lovely clear strawberry blonde with a nice head and okay lacing. Nose is malty. Biscuits soaked in malts. Tastes reminds me a bit of Pork Slap in the biscuity cookieness. Yeah, a slightly bitter butter cookie. Makes sense to me. Toasty, caramely. Cookie! Mouthfeel starts wet and chewy and finishes dry, leaving you seemingly more parched than before you sipped, making you want more! Very drinkable, not heavy. My one, lonely bottle from Colorado went too quickly. Who wants to send more to me in NYC?"
"Stands true the New Belgium style of very different brews.An intellectual beer that keeps you guessing."
"Easy enough to drink, but boring as hell. Decent for a lawnmower beer."
"Clear copper with two fingers worth of white head that quickly disappears leaving only a ring. Light biscuity malts mix with lemon-lime hints in the aroma. The taste is almost as light as the scent. Malts and citrus blend well but leave a slightly sour aftertaste that I could do without. Thin body with light carbonation. Glad I tried it but think I may pass on this one from now on."
"D - The drinkability is good. Nothing bad here, just not my thing."
"This beer isn't overwhelmingly impressive, it isn't awe-inspiringly complex, and it's not even something I would necessarily recommend to beer afficianados. What it is is one of several examples of why the likes of Corona (which costs only slightly less by the 6-pack from what I've seen) should be yanked off the shelves. If you're looking for a light, smooth, refreshing, easy-to-drink beer that you can pour back several of during a lounge out in the sun or a barbeque, this is a definite winner. And you don't even have to throw a freaking lime wedge into it - the taste is already there."
"Drinkability: A very refreshing summer thirst quencher. Low alcohol content makes this easily sessioable as well. With temps in the 90's now its great to see light summer beer like this out. A great early kick off for Memorial Day weekend. I'm glad I still have a few more of these left, and I will probably purchase again before summer is over."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Beer is a medium transparent amber with a decent enough head and surprisingly sticky, spotted lacing. Smell is malty with an odd funk that I don't have the words to describe. It's almost like a belgian yeast that missed the target. Taste lightly malted, lightly hopped, and lightly felt. There just isn't much going on here. I almost feel that the hops are a deterent here. The malts seem OK (not great), but the hops keep them from showing themselves. Mouthfeel is watery as hell and under-carbonated. Not good at all. Drinkability, hmm, I'm not sure where to go on this one. It isn't a very good beer, but it is a very drinkable beer, in the same way that water is drinkable. I'm just going to sit the fenceline on this one and call it average."
"12 oz bottle, ""expires"" in Sept. '06. Pours deep yellow with a hint of amber, very clear and the head is huge. Smells like earthy, sorta dirty hops, with a slight sulphur whisp. Taste is quite dry, with a prominent bitterness but not a lot of hop taste. The malts are a little crisp and bready, much more of a nut overtone than I would expect from a blonde ale (but entirely to be expected from a New Belgium beer). Not my favorite beer ever, but its sales pitch is that it's a light beer, and in that context, it's pretty damn tasty."
"Carbonation is relatively low which lends additional lushness to the mouthfeel, and makes it quite thirst-quenching. This is easily sessionable, but a little less sweetness, and some more hop would make said session more interesting. A fine lawnmower beer for me, and well worth the $6 a six pack or so that NBB have been charging for this. I like the beer a lot more than the name. Best Before 22 Sept. 06."
"Pretty light body, not overly carbonated. It's light, goes down easy, but for me it's just not that compelling."
"Mouthfeel is light and easy to drink. Refreshing, but not too very interesting."
"The beer emigrates from the 12-ounce brown bottle a luminous gold, the head large and frothy, the color a brilliant white, as it fades away, and the residual lace forms a thin coating upon the glass. Nose is fresh and crisp, sweet with malt, very light musty aroma, and a tiny touch of hops, Start is benign in its sweetness, the grain profile standard and the top light to moderate in feel. Finish is prickly in its acidity, the hops modest in their spiciness, desert bone dry aftertaste, a decent refreshing beer."
"drinkability: Drinkable, certainly, but I paid $7+ for a sixer of this. At that price, there's better out there."
"I enjoy trying seasonal brews and when I found New Belgium's summer brew I got a little excited. It's got a nice amber color to it with a nice frothy white head that gives it a refreshing appeal. However, once taking a nose I felt that it was lacking a bit in the aroma dept. The taste is pretty good. Good citrus/malt balance which was expected from this brewer. I think it would be better with a little more carbonation. As for drinkability, I will at least finish the six-pack, but I've had better summer seasonals. Overall a fairly decent summer refreshment."
"The body is light and I carbonation is limited. The beer has a good flavor presence as there wasnt much of a watery taste, but there is a lot going on that clash with each other. Overall Ill keep my overalls on."
"Poured a nice coppery color from a 12 oz bottle. Good head with good lacing. Some carbonation. Hard smell for me to nail down but I like it - can definitely smell the lime. Very good mouthfeel and great taste. Goes down very smooth and while maybe not quite a session beer, I can drink several at a sitting. Another great effort from New Belgium. (4, HR, T, Y)"
"Drinkability is excellent. This would make a perfect hot summer Saturday session beer. Go get some today!"
"Bottom line: This is an interesting and refreshing session brew from New Belgium that is certainly worth trying."
"If this is a light beer, it's the best one out there. Surprising it's not more aggressively marketed. It's a mediumly hoppy ale with a twist of lime, and while that may make BAs shudder by bringing back memories of Corona, it seems to work here. The aroma is hoppy and citric, and while the flavor doesn't grab, the finish is admirable. There's some puffy, cratered lace after the pour, and the hops and lime flavors recede after a few sips. But the nose makes the beer. The mouthfeel is a bit watery, doesn't give the tongue much to hang on to, but drinkability is quite high. I'd recommend this beer, and I'd suggest letting it get a fraction warmer than the 45 degrees New Belgium prescribes."
"Best light beer I've ever had, hands down."
"This is a drinkable beer, but its a little lighter than I prefer. From the label its the New Belgium stab at the light beer market, which is fine, but Im not much of a buyer in that market. I probably will not buy Skinny Dip again, unless Im looking to provide a light offering for some one else to drink. It might be a good cross-over beer for the BMC Lite crowd. I guess craft beers can be light too?"
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass custom longneck bottle, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"This beer pored from the bottle a medium copper color, very clear, topped by a great fluffy white head. The head does indeed leave a lace on the glass as it recedes. The nose has touches of the kaffir lime leaves and a slight citrus touch from the hops. The malt follows lightly with a bit of caramel. The taste has more hop than I expected. You can really taste the mild grapefruit from the hop addition. The kaffir lime is a touch more subtle than I expected from the nose. The caramel from the malt blends nicely and gives this almost a candy corn flavor. The mouth feel is light and well carbonated. This is yet another nice summer beer."
"Notes: Avoid. I'm 0-2 from this brewer....will keep trying...of course."
"Had this one served to me on tap at Old Chicago in Omaha. Not the best place for reviewing beer but I was bored. It poured with a large billowing head even from the bartender who always seems to pour a flat beer. The smell is light, some easy breathing grains mixed with lemon zest and some other citrus notes. The taste is off of what I had expected for a belgian pale. Very grainy, very smooth. A nice flavor but not what I expected at all. The mouthfeel is a bit watery with adequate carbonation but not matching the ginormous head. Overall a nice offering. Try it if you can."
"To sum this up with one word... WOW!!! If this is Skinny Dipping, Im going to try to get as much pool time as I can."
"Good quffer, great yardwork vice session brew. A little too limey/grassy& light in alcohol to be session ale for me"
"This beer was disappointing. If I didnt know better I might say that it was watered down."
"I can't drink 2 of these....all water and no substance."
"The flavor does not improve as the beers warms. It's probably best consumed at the usual frigid lager temperature. I don't believe this one lives up to NB's standards set with Blue Paddle, Fat Tire, 1554, and their Belgians."
"This is an extremely drinkable beer, but mostly because it's so unoffensive. Would be a decent ""summer beer after hard labor", but not something I'd drink on a regular basis."
"I think that overall, I was a little disappointed with this beer. But having that said, I think that it is exactly what they were probably shooting for: a light, mildly spicy, summer beer. Good for a change, but I wont come knocking very often."
"Drinkability- Tastes like any other macro. Passing up this if I ever see it again. Damn close to a drain pour."
"Golden amber in color with a slight white head. Flowery in smell with a slight peach scent. A hint of hops. Cool and crisp in taste. Very smooth seems to be the summary of taste. Not my favorite style but tastes good for a lighter beer and very drinkable. My wife simply loves this beer. She says she could drink way too many on a nice summer day outside. I much prefer Sunshine Wheat."
"Drinkability  Its a tough style to do right and isnt any better than that boring Porch Swing beer that they put out."
"Apparently the replacement for Loft, with some slight reworkings of the recipe; this beer has a little nuttier malt character than the Loft, along with a woody, resinous hoppy aroma that I don't recall in Loft, and perhaps slightly different hop flavor. Otherwise, the delightful kaffir character (citrusy yet exotic) is still present. Wheat flavor seems reduced. Very good and refreshing beer. I never get tired of it."
"It is very smooth and drinkable with only a 4.2% ABV. I think it is a great summer brew."
"D: OK, but it's just not an enjoyable enough brew to merit more than one try."
"Color is a pale amber with a moderate level of carbonation. Head is small and off-white. The aroma has a strong citris smell, a combo of hops and the kaffir lime. The initial taste is a combo of floral and citrissy hop flavors. A bready, slightly grainy body has a flavor similar to a lighter version of Fat Tire. A touch of lime is noted towards the finish. Skinny Dip is thrist-quinching and has a nice ease of drinkability. Pretty good entry for the summer craft beer market."
"Quite drinkable for a New Belgium beer. Dry tasting and not overly malty as most beers they make are. I could see buying this again or ordering while traveling."
"Had the first three beers from the tap. It took about 5 minutes for each glass I ordered due to excessive foam which lingered quite a while after the pour. Since the tap was just hooked up, the beer was room temp, which didn't hurt anything; almost seemed like I was drinking a cask ale. Overall a very good and refreshing summer brew, although I don't understand the comparisons to Loft. Loft had a hoppier bite whereas this more subdued and malt-accentuated. Finishes dry and thinner than the initial heavy head would have implied. Very enjoyable; easy to drink and nothing short on flavor."
"I was hoping this would be a go to beer for after mowing the lawn. I think I'll have to just pass."
"This beer works when it is warm, but feels rather thin when it's 40F and raining."
"Kinda fizzy. A crisp feel, balanced between bitterness and citrus. Leaves clean, easy drinking."
"This is a new offering from New Belgium replacing Loft Beer, although it is quite similar. Decent head of white foam, fair retention. The color is ultimately clear and a medium gold. Smell is light, with an aroma of piney hops. The taste is very clean, with more hop flavor and a bit of tangy spice in the finish. The bready malt flavor is fairly weak. Hop bitterness is moderate. Fairly light in body, it has a strong zesty carbonation that pierces the front of the tongue. Very crisp and clean overall, unfortunately reminding me more of light macros than any Belgian Pale Ale I've tried. It's drinkable, but nothing too exciting..."
"Clear amber colored brew with a moderate white head that disipates rather quicklybut still leaves some traces of lace. The aroma is bready with just a suggestion of citrus. The taste is light bready malt with a trace of caramel and citrus. Slightly dry from the start, with a nicely dry citrus finish. Smooth and easy to take in quantity. Should be a good hot weather option."
"Overall impression: First of all, I'm not huge on the marketing behind this, but I suppose New Belgium wants a piece of the light beer market. This definitely seems a bit different than I remember Loft, but it has been at least a year since I've tried that one. All in all this is a very drinkable summer session beer, and I'm sure I will enjoy more than my fair share over the coming months."
"Edit: After following up with the folks at New Belgium, they claim it's a totally different beer than FT (different malts, hops, adjuncts). But perhaps it's their yeast that gives it the trademark flavor. I still stand by the FT lite beer."
