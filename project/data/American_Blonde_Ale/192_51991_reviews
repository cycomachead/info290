"O - a great treat after a day of golfing in the searing desert heat, i would call this more of a Pale than a blonde ale"

"This beer was sort of misleading. I was expecting something strong and outlandishly hoppy. While the hops definitely hit my nose, the taste is actually pretty tame. It is, after all, a blonde ale. The hops hit you up front, but it goes down smooth with a little aftertaste from the hops. It's actually a pretty refreshing autumn beer, a good way to transition from the crisp summer ones into the typically darker, warmer beers of the fall."

"This is a blonde ale? Well, if they say so, sure. Heavy malt nose is followed by a prickly hop spicyness. Citrus and pine dominate for the most part. This is a nice drinker. Definitely a fall ""blonde ale", if there is such a thing. I can appreciate it."

"So... This is a good beer. I don't know why this bottle was giving me hints of coconut. I don't know what's wrong with me. Go get some if you can find it. Sadly this was the last sixer in town, so I don't get more. If you too notice a strange coconuttiness to it, maybe I'm not crazy. But don't expect it."

"Poured into a Black Raven imperial pint Pours a light to medium orange yellow amber, thin fine head the slowly dissipates to a ring, lots of lacing. Light aroma of sweet malt and hops. Taste follows aroma, sweet bready malt, light orange and lemon citrus hops. Light to medium bodied with light carbonation. Finishes with a mild hop bite on the back of the tongue. Subdued, but pleasant. Nicely hopped for a blonde ale."

"A very good session beer and it manages to avoid that biscuit tone that alot of NB beers get. Rye and oats play nice with each other here. Very satisfied with this bottle."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best by Nov 20, 2011. Pours hazy golden straw color with a nice 2 finger dense white head with great retention that reduces to a cap. Some nice lacing down the glass as well. Aromas of grapefruit, floral, orange, apricot, light caramel, bread, and a bit of wheat. Some nice aromas with decent strength. Taste of nice grapefruit, pine, floral, orange, bread, light pine, spices, and wheat. Good amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, spiciness, bread, and light caramel for a bit on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy mouthfeel that drinks smoothly. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Overall a nice and drinkable blonde ale. Quite enjoyable and definitely a nice option for a session. It is nicely balanced in flavors and not anything extreme that would make it unpalatable after a few glasses."

"Overall a beer with a lot of different hops working very well together so not to overpower each other, or the rest of the flavors in this well rounded brew."

"Oily and dry. Earthy and bitter. Almost chalky with citrus, resin, and floral flavors. Smooth and hoppy throughout but with a sudden sweetness toward the end and the finish has a dry bite. Not a bad beer overall. Big hop profile and a lingering hoppy flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"MO-Overall an okay beer. It' seems like a pale ale to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) Overall a good brew. The hops overpower the Blonde characteristics but I guess that is why it's call ""Hoptober""."
""
""
""
"Overall- A little too hoppy for my tastes. Not a bad beer but I probably will not try it again."
""
"Mouthfeel: medium-light body, sparkly carbonation, crisp texture"

"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a deep golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops, some citrus notes. Taste is a good balance of hops and malts, some citrus, a touch of sweetnesss. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - New Belgium's Hoptober was a tasty blonde ale. It's a unique take on a fall seasonal and it's a beer I'll keep an eye open for next Fall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As a golden ale it bring more flavor than normal, which is good. Not my favorite style but definitely worth trying."
""
"Overall, this is basically a (good) standard American Pale ale. I'm not sure why New Belgium chose this style as their Autumn seasonal, but it's good. Just more of a spring or summer thing for me."
""
""
""
""
"O - Very enjoyable and drinkable beer. Hop flavor and smell were both complex and gave good character. The bitterness was low and balanced by the malt which will appeal to a wide audience (reminiscent of their signature, Fat Tire)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- A light and refreshing little beer with some solid flavors and creates a good pairing with a tri-tip & pasilla pepper sandwhich, really cut the heat and refreshed at the same time. Alone, I probably wouldn't have this beer but with that meal yes."

"O- A very enjoyable beer. My only beef is that the name suggests to some (my wife) that it is an oktoberfest. No problem as it's still a great beer, just not an oktoberfest."
""
""
""
""
"As is the case with most of New Belgium's line of ""regular"" beers, Hoptober can appeal to a wide variety of personal tastes. This is something to keep in mind for future falls."
"O - A pretty good blond ale, but not something I would come back to."
"O - very nice twist on a golden ale... Recommend highly"
"O-Highly versatile ale that I think might be enjoyable year 'round. This is worth your time and money."
"The mouthfeel was medium to light in body with a prickly, fine carbonation. I couldn't resist the name but this one is surprisingly good."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce custom brown glass long neck bottle, served in a Samuel Adams Boston Lager ""sensory"" glass."
"Overall this is a very drinkable beer. I kind of wish this was New Belgium's summer seasonal instead of the fall."
"Taste is a smooth hoppy and malt balance. Citrusy test, floral hoppy bitterness with dry biscuity malt. And a softness and creaminess that make drinking this beer a pleasure. Medium carbonation. Has a smooth bitter finish that upholds all the flavors about this beer. A bit different then most ""Autumn seasonals"" but a welcome change that it is."
"I compliment this beer on its unique timbre, but I personally am not as big a fan of hops or spicy beer. I recognize the quality of the beer and recommend it to anyone who does prefer the spicy genre of beer. This beer has much better drink ability compared to other hop-beers such as arrogant bastard."
"As a hophead and a guy that isn't too big on oktoberfest beers in general, this is my oktoberfest beer of choice. It's immensely drinkable, yet still carries great flavor all the way through."
"Overall a really great brew and full of flavor. There is a lot going on with this...straw notes, slight belgian yeast, hops, and pear aftertaste. I would almost prefer a bit more hops, but overall this is a great brew. Another good one from New Belgian."
"poured a clear gold with a half finger white head, scent is unimpressive, similar to a golden ale with a minimal hop addition, doesn't strike my fancy. I like the flavor, but wanted a little more from the hops. There was some malty sweetness that balanced it out overall."
"O - The type of hops used for the dry hopping were not listed, but they showed off very nicely on the nose...unfortunately dry hopping only helps the nose...there could have been some citrus flavors to round out all of the grainy flavors"
"Overall, I really liked this beer outside of its appearance. The appearance made me not expect much, then, boom, great beer. I'll have this again for sure."
" Body is light and crisp, very refreshing, but holds the flavor well. This is a fairly strong beer for a blonde ale, but the alcohol is well-integrated. Not the most exciting offering around, but it's a solid brew."
"Atmosphere is pretty good here. Golden hue, nice foamy head, and plenty of lacing. Nose is baked bread malt accentuated with a light hop, and a touch of lemon. Flavor is bitter, and a little hoppy. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"Trying the New Belgium Hoptober which is one of my favorites this time of year. The appearance is a pale clear yellow....the head is very thin and white. The beer laces nicely down the glass. The smell is good...it contains light hop with some citrus. The taste is good...contains citrus and subtle pine supported by some floral tones. The mouthfeel is decent...medium to light body with good carbonation. Overall a very good beer and highly recommend above all the marzen bs that is out now."
"WoW!! This has to be one of my favorite beers I have had to date. Though I am still acolyte I have been into craft beers for a while now. This beer is perfectly balanced it is so smooth you cant even tell its there. It has a perky hint of citrus hops. This beers is overall exceptional I love it. I wish it was around all year, but that would take away from it being so special!"
"This beer has a nice backbone of malt supporting a strong hoppiness. The taste was complex and hoppy but with a malty finish. An interesting fall beer that came as part of a new holland seasonal 12 pack."
"This beer is really nice. It's got a great price and is a great beer for it's affordability."
"Overall I really didn't like the personality. It was really hoppy and nice overall but didn't have much to differentiate it."
"O: good beer overall, I would have this again. Nice that it's easy to get a delicious seasonal brew."
"Overall pretty decent, I enjoy most brews by New Belgium, while not my all time favorite always a reasonably priced and clean drinking ale."
"Overall- For what I think would be a hop forward beer, it is incredibly balanced. It is a finely crafted beer, but they made it so balanced, it fails to be impressive in any aspect."
"D - very nice. Simple, balanced well and very drinkable. I'm very surprised by this one and I'd have it again."
"O=Easy drinking beer, almost more reminiscent of a hopped up APA though"
"Another beer that starts strong but loses ground. The smells are simply fantastic - if I have another bottle, I may just let it sit and inhale the fumes rather than actually drinking it. The flavors don't blend well, leaving it unbalanced and hard to enjoy."
"Pours a golden with a big off-white head. Smells of tropical fruit and some light grain. Taste is initially some malt sweetness, followed by a big hop middle and finish. Citrus flavors, though primarily pine flavors dominate. Mouthfeel is a touch light. Overall very good. Tastes more like a pale ale than a golden ale to me with it's pronounced hop flavor."
"Good beer, nice sixpack material."
"O: This beer is clean and refreshing, I can't help but feel it would make for a proper summer seasonal, not that there's anything wrong with that. I'm perfectly happy drinking it now, and it's a pleasant departure from the more typical fall seasonals."
"O - I enjoyed this beer although I was expecting something more hoppy based on its name, its a great seasonal and is different then the other fall varieties which makes it stand alone in my opinion"
"Overall, this is a perfectly drinkable beer, great out of a pitcher at trivia Tuesday."
"O: a solid brew, i wouldnt quite qualify it as something i would like to have as a harvest brew, a bit too light and hoppy, otherwise it is a good brew, bit strong on the carbonation but otherwise nicely done"
"O: I really enjoyed this beer. The flavors complemented each other perfectly and the beer was easy to drink. Hoptober's aromas, flavors, and slightly higher than average ABV make it a perfect beer for the autumn season."
"O: light simple, not plain by any means."
"Pours a slightly hazy light yellow with a 1 inch puffy white head that settles to a thin cap. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus fruit, citrus zest, and some herbal/floral hops. Taste is of malt and rye (slightly spicy), citrus zest, and a variety of herbal and floral hop flavors. Almost zero bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good blonde ale that packs a nice hop punch in the aroma and taste."
"An unexciting, though well crafted American blonde. The name is somewhat misleading however, as this is not a very hoppy beer."
"Another tasty ale from the New Belgium Brewery! Good job guys!"
"I opened the bottle up and pour into a glass. I took a big nose full of citrus and flowery aroma from the hops. The head was about a finger which disappeared some what quickly, while the color was a gold color and quite clear. The flavor was dominated by the hops with a bit of the malt showing up in the aftertaste. The feel was of a medium body. I like IPA's and hoppy beer and this appeals to me much like Redhook's Longhammer."
"Overall: Definitely better (and fruitier!) than expected, especially for style. Easy drinking and would make for an excellent session beer."
"New Belgium Hoptober: Great name and a great beer! The Hoptober pours with a clear deep golden color and light carbonation. The head is thick, pure white, pillowy and leaves a beautiful lacing. Aroma is very present with lots of hop. Hop flavor comes on strong at the start and lasts all the way through. The underlying malts are subtle and stay that way – the Hoptober is not too sweet as many types of ale are. There is a bit of bitter in the aftertaste. All in all, this is just what ale should be if you like complex hops winning over malt sweetness."
"You get two fingers of pure white foam, loose and delicate, heavily dimpled surface with islands of larger bubbles, lots of stickiness leaves serious lacing residue behind. The liquid is not cloudy but it’s not crystal clear either, golden yellow with a vague hint of orange, random super-tiny bubbles float within. The nose first hits you with pepper, green grasses and grains as well as white grapefruit to lemon zest, slightly warmer there’s richer apricot, peach fruit and flower accents, ends with an earthy, metallic ring, aggressively jabs you. Medium to full-bodied, given its generally creamy mouth texture it is surprising how bitter it can seem at times, the hops are green and verging on mean. The pepper, saline, quinine and just plain poor dirt at once lends it punch and dries things out some. The white citrus adds more scrubbing sensations. Hidden off to the side are the peach, apricot, pear fruit as well as floral dew. It’s on the aggressive side, that creaminess really saves it from becoming overbearing. Could put down a couple in a row but that’s it."
"O - Hops are the main feature here, but the sweet malt puts up a fight. Hoptober is a good hoppy ale."
"O: Very easy drinking and refreshing, like to battle between the sweet and the bitter. Something I would drink again."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a golden blond color. The beer poured a nice white fluff head and I had high hopes. However the beer had a terrible sour smell. I mean it flat out stunk. Taste was not like that but the smell ruined it. The beer had a yeasty taste. I will not buy again."
"Overall: surprise. I've only had Fat Tire and I guess used to a malty beer from NB, this was a very nice surprise. Easy drinker and would be an excellent introduction beer to a beginner craft beer drinker."
"Hoptober pours a bright, clear golden color with a pillowy white head that laces nicely. The aroma has faint notes of grains and grasses, perhaps a touch of alcohol. The taste has those grain and grass notes in a much stronger (better, I think) way. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and clean with a crisp finish and pleasant aftertaste. Overall this beer is a good one - try one if you find it."
"Cheers!"
"This was easy drinking, with pleasant flavors. Nicely blended, would be a good session beer. Also one of the more flavorful blonde ales I've had."
"I am not a big NB fan, but this one is quite impressive. It is flavorful and refreshing, but not in your face at all. It's the perfect marriage of flavor and drinkability. Not at all what I expected from this style. Give this one a shot!"
"Overall this was a very unique beer if you ask me. The golden maltiness was on the heavier side but the hops were also equally present and added a great balance of flavor. Would definitely be best enjoyed during the early fall months, as opposed to the colder/later ones, especially while it is still fresh."
"This beer was a cross between an IPA and a Belgian Blonde or Saison. Not exactly what you would expect in a fall offering, but an interesting way to mesh a hoppy IPA characteristic with a blonde ale. This was very nice!"
" Not my ideal fall beer... Would have liked them to made a hoppy brown ale.."
"turns out hoptober isnt very octobery at all. the tap had autumnal colors and fall leaves all over it, i thought this beer would do much more justice to the season. poured a watery yellow into a pint glass, nice lacey head. aromas of hops are robust and somehow also seemingly delicate. mouthfeel is light, this beer doesnt have much of a body to speak of. taste is good, not as unique as other new belgium beers, but its a nice pint. i enjoyed it with a burrito, but i find it not too fall. might be better as a spring seasonal, light and growing kind of, like spring itself. it worked out well enough though, given that october 1st here in denver was sunnny and 80 degrees."
"3.98 (B+)"
"When poured into a New Belgium globe glass, the appearance is wonderful: frothy white head, beautiful apple cider golden hue with constant bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. As the beer goes down, the sticky white lacing clings to the glass beautifully. It smells like crisp sweet apples and bold golden wheat. The mouth-feel is light and carbonated, highly drinkable. You can taste sweet caramel apples and citrus hops here. At first you wonder if it really is an Autumn beer, but half-way through, you realize this beer is brilliant. It IS an Autumn beer, it's just presented in a different way. It's crisp, light, warm, brilliant. It's not an Oktoberfest, but it is meant for October. Highly recommended."
"Clear pale gold with two fingers of white fluffy head and very good fine lacing. Aroma is bit of cracker. Taste is malty slightly sweet with a fair amount of bitter piney hops. Mouthfeel is decent with slightly high carbonation. The finish is medium dry and bitter. Alcohol was fairly prominent."
"Up front there is a nice clean feel that tastes almost sweet, like there's a twinge of tangerine almost. Bold and bitter hops take over the back of the palate. Piney hops are the main feature, but they are almost matched with a nice smacking of caramel malts that come close to balancing this one. Certainly a hop-forward beer, but there is that balancing factor in the malt bill. Every now and then, a sip will just remind me of tangerine as well, adding a layer onto the complexity. The carbonation level is right on for the style at medium-high, but despite that, there is a wateriness to the feel that is just a smidge out of place. Otherwise, it finishes crisp and dry, fitting for a beer featuring the month of October in its name. Very good beer, and definitely worth the 3.99 price tag. I will almost certainly be picking this one up again."
"I've had this more than once and it goes well with steamed crabs. Welcome to Maryland."
"Overall-More of the same from New Belgium, simple but good beers for a reasonable price, and thats what you're getting here."
"Overall: A drinkable beer that is relatively simple."
"O - This is my new favorite beer from NB. Better than Ranger IMHO. Recommended."
"Easy to drink. Not boring yet not extremely complex. Not a disappointment, I'll be looking forward to next year's batch."
"While it is named Hoptoberfest, I would brand it as a pleasant Summer quaff - not much else, though. A nice beer; not a great one."
"Overall pretty nice, a nice light end of summer / early fall style beer with nice hops, light on the malts but they're there, a nice American twist on a nice fall style beer, and I'm happy how they kept the hops from going overboard."
"I really wush this were not a seaonal. Hear me New Belgiam? Please make this a permanent entry in your repertoire."
"O - Overall it's a decent, drinkable golden ale. Good but not great, not memorable."
"An interesting beer, refreshing and clean with some different flavors, but i think it worked overall."
"I think this is my new favorite from New Belgium. It's a bit subtle but hits some great notes with the moderate hops and creaminess. Highly recommended."
"Overall it's pretty Meh. Pretty boring. Started off ok and got more and more mehhhh as it went on. Won't get this again."
"Taste...here it isn't as one dimensional as the aroma suggests, there is a mild malty undertone to it that goes well with the hops. Nothing overpowering from either the malt or hop profile. Crisp mouthfeel, light bodied. Overall a good beer."
"Regardless, I'd take opportunity to give this a try as it's well-assembled, but it's not even close to the best Autumn seasonals."
"Overall, an impressive offering."
"This is one of the best beers I have ever had from New Belgium and if you find are contemplating trying this, dont hesistate and do it."
"mouthfeel - medium to heavy body for the style. medium carbonation for the style."
"O-Not the worst in the world, but I don't like it"
"Over-hopped? perhaps. Wonderful malt and crisp bitter finish - YEP."
"O- this one took a little getting used to. I would recommend that if you are not used to a hoppy style beer such as this work your way up to it with a few other beers first. But if you want to really wake up your taste buds I would say go straight to this one. It's a keeper."
"Overall: A damn good beer, one of my favorite and regular seasonals; a great cascade taste and very refreshing. A scrumptious beer."
"A fairly orginal take on the blonde ale with a nice selection of hops that actually take a backseat in the finish to the creamy mouthfeel that the grain bill adds to the beer. Totally drinakable and very different than the malty Fat Tire or the hoppy Mighty Arrow APA. Not the malty autumn gold of most fall seasonals and not a OK fest lager either this is a cool addition to the Fall season"
"Six packs on sale for $7.99 at Targets in Atlanta."
"O: This is a solid ale. Very easy drinking and very simple to handle. this is not nearly as flavorful as I had expected but a good ale nonetheless."
"On draught poured into a shaker pint glass. There’s about a finger’s worth of head that takes its time to die down. Nice mellow aroma with some piney notes. Pours golden and clear. Is this a fall quaffer or a seasonal sipper? Light body, pleasing balance but dialed down to light music levels. There’s a maltiness to this that’s neither chewy nor overpowering. An enjoyable beer for falling leaves and cooler weather."
"D- Sits very light. Definitely an all day drinker."
"O-This was designed to be a simple, easy drinking light beer and it works on that level. I would prefer a more assertive hop profile, but other than that, no complaints. I could see working through a 6 pack on a hot day, maybe while manning the barbecue."
"O) Purchased in error by a family member thinking it was an Oktoberfest, but what a pleasant surprise. This is a really good beer. I would certainly recommend this one."
"M - Surprising medium-to-full body (no doubt bolstered by the flaked oats they use in this recipe). Carbonation is a little strong but not overpowering. Very drinkable beer and great for the cool autumn weather. I actually had my first taste of this at a bonfire--coincidental considering the label design."
"Excellent beer, excellent fall beer. Great overall."
"This is a perfectly transparent golden ale with billowing pillows of foam and multiple tracings of lacings left behind as the foam recedes. There is some graininess and grassiness to its aroma, which leans towards the citrusy hops of Sierra Nevada. There is a bit of carbonation bite to its taste, but beyond that, there is soft subtle malt sweetness. Perhaps the word soft comes to mind because the texture of this beer, especially the initial foamy layers, reminds me of nothing less than soft lips of a sensual kiss. In this sense, this may be the sexiest beer I know. The beer is worth experiencing for that reason alone. A blonde? Maybe more like a pale ale, but I'm sure some will think of blondes when they spend time sipping this delightful ale."
"Hey New Belgium Brewing welcome to VA.... What took you so long.."
"A really nice early fall drink to help wash down a good spicy spaghetti dinner. I could see this also working well with grilled seafood."
"O: Excellent blonde ale. I will try to pick up a few six packs"
"I had big expectations for this after the smell, but it disappointed me a bit. I’d probably give it the old college try again, though."
"Overall: A very solid wheat ale from New Belgium. Nice balance of fruity sweetness with some mild bitterness."
"D-Incredibly easy drinking for those last few hot days of the year; not an in your face beer by any means, but still a solid beer."
"O - A good solid beer."
"Overall a nice beer. Definitely a nice change of pace from the marzen/pumpkin soaked fall market."
"Considering the hop aromas and flavors, the bitterness is muted, allowing the different malts to come through."
"Pours a semi-cloudy gold w/ decent head and no lace on top of a nice mix of earthy hops and dry malt. Medium-bodied and chewey, it's real smooth w/ a wheat twang as well as having a piney, resinouse hop feel. Balanced brew as a touch of of chewey, doughy malt give off some fullness and dryness as a little bit of sugary sweetness. Throw in the touch of citrus and tart fruits and while a tad simplistic this is a very tastey beer that I enjoyed sipping on."
"Overall this is a great and very drinkable beer."
"Notes: It's quality but I'm not crazy about it by far… Logically this can be part of the massive launch of NB brews in the region. Price/quality ratio is remarkable and in that context this could do very well. Having said that… If only for that nose, I'd take this over their pervasive Fat Tyre any day."
"O- I like this NB fall release. Not a huge Marzen fan, although I do enjoy them now and again, so a non-marzen fall seasonal is a nice alternative."
"The only downside is that even the best beers don't taste good when they aren't fresh. New Belgium is mainly successfull on their purity (and safety) of flavor and freshness."
"O - This is a great transition into the fall browns, and marzens from the summer IPA's. It has a strong hop aroma and taste but is well balanced with the four malts that are used. I find it hard not to like anything from New Belgium and this one is right near the top as well."
"Overall it's not bad stuff at all, but may not make the headlines. It's plenty drinkable though."
"Overall: Never thought I would rate a blonde so highly; this one re-defines the style, however"
"D: This may not be a traditional fall style, or a hype-conducive beer, but it is very good. As a hoppy blonde ale, this works really well."
"Overall Impression- Like my blondes, I like them easy and approachable. And this one is and you will think so to! Grab one of these seasonals while you can! Definintely recommend on tap, and will be reviewing a bottle shortly."
"This is a fascinating beer. Pours a clear golden body with white head with decent retention. The aromas are fascinating: lots of tropical and assorted fruits like pineapple, mango, kiwi, even some strawberries come through quite prominently, with floral notes and a lime-like zestiness in the background. The hops are more prominent in the flavor, which has a well-balanced hop to malt ratio. Fruit, grain and honey flavors are equal to the assertive hops. This is easily the best blonde ale I've ever tried. Brilliant stuff."
"O: This is another solid offering from New Belgium and well suited to the cool fall evenings that are quickly approaching. I enjoyed the way it started out crisp and then grew in body as it warmed. The hop bitterness was also very well balanced with the final citrus taste and aftertaste. A very well put together and interesting beer."
"New Belgium does it again!"
"Pours a light golden yellow w/ a good two finger off white head that quickly disappears. Little carbonation and decent lacing. Super clear, and very easy to see right through. Smell is of hops, malt, spice, grass, grain. Very distinct nose to this beer. Not particularly balanced, but a nice smelling brew for the style. Hops, lemon, fruit, and some malt really come through in the taste. Definitely a different taste profile from the nose. Almost IPA-like. I expected a little more malt in the flavor. Mouthfeel is fairly full w/ a spicy bite from the hops carrying into the aftertaste. Overall, this beer drinks more like an IPA to me. I enjoyed it, and the price was right. Recommended, but I probably won't seek this one out again. Cheers."
"A refreshing balanced beer, perfect for the Libra scales of 'Hoptober' (heh, heh?)"
"Pours crystal clear and golden. Good carbonation, thick, white, sparkly (almost soapy-looking) foam. Plenty of lacing. Crisp, clean hoppy aroma. Grapefruit, some pine resin. Some caramel malt in the background. Flavor is light and hoppy - more grapfruit with a nice planty, floral bent. Caramel/toffee sweetness. The mouthfeel is very delicate and silky. The beer explodes into a light, carbonated foam in your mouth. A great well-balanced, light beer, although it seems to be missing some of the boldness that I look for in autumnal offerings and that is promised on the label."
"O - this isn't the best beer I've ever had, and it's definitely not the worst. Going down really nicely on this hot-ass day."
"Even at 6% ABV, this beer feels very drinkable, much like an oktoberfest is drinkable. The bottle says that this is a medium-bodied beer and I don't agree with that."
"O: This beer does not get enough respect -- it is a very good APA with plethora of hops and malt aromas and flavors. I am really impressed with this beer. Will I spend the money to buy this over a now $12.49/6-pack FW Union Jack -- probably not as I think UJ is one of the best IPAs around. But Hoptober is a sneaky good IPA that I would love as an everyday beer for its balance, body, and fresh hops and malt flavors."
"O: Pleasant and drinkable. 3.5"
"Overall (4): Somewhere between a blond and an IPA, this is a very drinkable beer. Very light overall but with some great fruit flavors. This is better than I recall when I last tried it in 2009 and I will probably pick up some more."
"I was at first expecting a more 'Oktoberfest' style brew, but even this being dubbed a golden ale, I found the style departed from the usual drinkable and balanced New Belgium recipe. Perhaps the 2011 batch had a little extra something that added more sweetness and less acidity. Though it does seem to be a commercially appealing style. But it reminds me waaay to much of Blue Moon...."
"Delightful, light, and quite tasty, Hoptober's a winner any way you look at it."
"Overall a nice little hoppy ale with that New Belgium tweak. Very pleasant and clean, and not overpowering in any way."
"The mouthfeel definitely has a little added body and creaminess from the oats, which I really like. The carbonation is moderate. Overall it was a very flavorful and delicious beer. The hoppiness was very bright and fresh which made it very drinkable overall. really liked the mouthfeel as well. Excellent beer for the style as well."
"M: medium-light body and definitely creamy. A little heavier than I would expect from a blonde, but it works for fall style."
"O - One of my favorite go to beers for this time of year. Great refreshing taste which I crave around April - July...always anticipated this coming back this year....Very NICE! Glad I could find this so quickly this time!! CHEERS! would be nice if New Belgium made this a year round brew!"
"A refreshing beer, not quite what I was expecting, but I enjoyed it."
"O- I tend to like my fall beers with more malt and warm flavors and more body. I think my score is eschewed a little lower because this is not your typical fall beer, nor should I think it be. Hard for me to rate to style when i'm thinking it should be a different style than it is. Was really in the mood for something fitting, but this is much more crisp and summer-y."
"O: I was impressed here. The taste is solid, goes down easily. More of a summer than a fall seasonal though."
"Hoptober Golden Ale is a clear, golden colored brew with a big, bubbly white head. Lots of lacing sticks to the glass. There's just a slight chill haze, and no rising carbonation bubbles. The scent is pretty nice and consists mostly of a variety of hops, ranging from floral to citrus and just a bit of bitter. The taste starts off with a pale malt start, toasty, pretty spicy, I guess very spicy for the style. Nice floral undercurrents, some wheat grains, I think some rye as well. The malt profile is getting fairly complex the more I let this one run around my mouth. Some lemon zest and some grassy notes as well. The hops finish bitter. Medium bodied with a dry finish."
"Good seasonal brew from NB. I grew up on (and outgrew) Fat Tire, and love to check in on one of my homestate OG's. I grabbed a sixer and will probably wait until next year to grab another."
"D very easy to drink, eatery refreshing sweetness, light citrus hops with a bit of bitterness in finish, thirst quenching"
"O: I think the other reviews on BA are totally in line with my experience overall. Good, but not great. Someone would have to twist my arm to order this one in a bar...."
"Beer is light in body with a grainy finish but not offputting. It is an interesting and decent beer, I drank the whole bomber of it out of my awesomeness tulip and I'd have more. It is mildly hoppy even on the midpalate, minimal yeast contribution."
"Overall pretty enjoyable, and highly drinkable as well."
"Overall, this is a good beer. It's an interesting Fall seasonal in that it is pretty light in color and light in body. However the balanced flavors provide a refreshing beer that is perfect for the warmth of late Summer and early Fall days."
"D: Drinkability is in the moderate range. It is quite easy to drink, though I don't quaff the ones above 5% like I used to. Personal preference."
"Overall, this is one hell of a session beer. Well-balanced, subtle flavors come together very well."
"D: definitely more ""extreme"" considering the style, but well welcomed."
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer. I would have liked the finish to be a bit more dramatic, but the taste was very nice and easy to drink. I would have another."
"Pretty good for a blonde. A nice summer brew that could serve well as an introduction to craft."
"O: New Belgium never fails to hit me with a good beer. None are Exceptional but all are worth buying and drinking. Great go-to brewery. This is a super drinkable beer."
"Unfortunately, taste does't quite follow nose. Lemony bitter hops, maybe some honey. Much lighter flavor than I was expecting. Medium carbonation, has a bite to it though. I found this one to be pretty drinkable, but not a beer I'd seek out."
"O - Ive seen this one before but never picked it up. I'm glad I did this time around. I should have known better. New Belgium is pretty solid when it comes down to it."
"Tasty and refreshing."
"Dr: Not very drinkable on account of the limited quality. Decently priced as part of a variety pack, but still not worth a go for any serious beer fanatic. (or advocate, as it were...)"
"O: Good beer. Easy to drink. Reminds me of fresh Bitter American. Very sessionable."
" this beer pours a nice golden straw color with slight lacey head. The smell is almost ipa-ish with sweet accents. The taste is a sweet hoppy citrus. I like the balance of piney citrus and sweet maltiness. New belgium makes some quality beers."
"A hint of butterscotch at the very finish. A very good beer that was a nice surprise from an excellent brewery."
"Another random gift bottle from my brother. Sometimes family can pay off, amiright? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear golden straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose is a very simple and straightforward blast (okay, blast is a strong word...more like a light breeze) of lemon zest. I'm gettin' nuthin' else in my 'strils, baby. The taste is similarly simple, with the aforementioned lemon being wrapped in a soft blanket of mild pine and grapefruit rind. It's exceedingly light, and the flavors don't even try to linger on the tongue. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, an okay beer at best, something akin to a lemon-flavored macro (that was originally handled decently well, admittedly)."
"Pours a golden color with a one finger white head and decent lacing. The aroma is of citrus hops and floral hops. The aroma for a blond is great. The taste has a sweet malt backbone and then a nice ctirus hop bite along with a piney hop bite. The taste is crisp and refreshing. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall for a blond this is a very solid beer. One of the best blondes I have ever had."
"O- Great smooth nice summery beer although its a fall seasonal."
"I would drink this beer any day, even if it were an APA. Solid brew all-around."
"This beer really showcases its floral, fruity hops and has enough malt sweetness to keep it almost perfectly balanced. It's easy to drink yet slightly complex, but more than anything, the flavor is just fantastic. If only there was some of the oily-ness of Pliney, this would be to the next level. I look forward to this one every year."
"all in all, impressive. On tap, this is a completely different beast than I remember from the bottle... delicious!"
"D - Easy to drink and smooth floral flavor gives it a well balanced attack in your taste buds; would be a fantastic beer for food pairings"
"IF SEE IT, TRY IT, BUT NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"Overall - Solid Hoppy Ale. Biggest thing is lacking some back end taste."
"D: Another nice one from New Belgium. Very easy to drink, nice flavor, good price, and easy to find when in season. The low ABV allows one to drink several of these no problem."
"After enjoying several IPAs in this last month, this beer holds it's own with tons of subtle hop flavor and refreshing sweetness."
"D- Very drinkable and refreshing"
" D- This beer has some nice light dry fresh malt flavors with a good pungent hop flavor that is a bit stronger than the malt. There are some nice clean lager qualities and it is very easy to drink but also has some good character."
"i suppose autumn would be the logical choice for an ale of this sort to be released as a seasonal. it feels like i'm drinking an ale of the earth...spicy and satisfying. would pair well with a pile of leaves and a bonfire."
"This is a light golden, hay colored yellow with a thin white head. There is a decent hoppy scent, which I expected based on the name. The hops came through with the taste, along with some floral notes and a hint of citrus. Not my favorite, but pretty decent."
"The beer pours a very clear golden color with a white head. The aroma is wheat, light lemons and some grain notes. The aroma is a little bit lacking overall. The flavor is more prominent. I get some lemon and orange citrus notes, as well as some wheat and some grassy hops. The overall bitterness level is low, but it is nicely done. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D/O- I found this one to be extremely drinkable. Wouldn't mind making an afternoon of this one next fall if given the opportunity."
"Good carbonation and light body, highly drinkable."
"I bought this because 12 packs were on sale for $8 which is a hell of a deal for this beer. Definitely look forward to more next fall."
"D- This is a solid fall session for me. It breaks up the monotony of Oktoberfest for me and gives me something different than the usual enamel removers I love so much. Thank you New Belgium."
"Drinkability is good, a tasty beer that is subtly complex, sessionable but satisfying."
"Brings memories of the Pale Ales we have tasted in West Flanders; hoppy, earthy, sweet golden beauties. By far one of the more interesting fall seasonals to be had."
"Excellent fall beer, would have again."
"Drinkability: I didn't pay much attention to the name. What my brain registered was ""Oktoberfest", and not ""HOPtober"" So this mildly hoppy animal was totally unexpected, but much appreciated. Nicely balanced and a refreshing finish."
"O - I really enjoyed this beer, it is unlike any other fall seasonal that I have had. It is light and crisp with very nice citrusy flavors. I wouldn't necessarily have this on a colder fall day, but it is pleasant when the weather is still warmish."
"My favorite New Belgium brew by far. They do everything right with this one. Great appearance; a tempting golden bubbly brew, aroma is mixed from the various hop usage, but the balanced taste is where it's all at... balance of light to medium malt with light to medium hoppiness is very impressive. You get great doses of both malt and hop flavor yet feel the beer is light to medium in body, meaning you feel up for drinking the entire six pack (or twelve pack, which I buy every fall!)"
"TRY IT!"
"D This is an OK beer, but not my favorite NBB beer. 3  "
"Notes: A little surprising for me, given the style and the brewery, I wasn't expecting a whole lot. Fortunately I got an enjoyable, refreshing beer. It isn't going to blow anyone away, but is going to be a simple beer I could drink a couple of and enjoy. Would be a really nice introduction beer with its nice balance (especially for introducing to hops), and it would be nice for non-intro reasons too."
"D- meh, i found this beer to be bland and boring. something i dont think id try again. this is a rare let down from new belgium. oh well, maybe next time."
"D - Very easy to drink."
"i could DRINK THIS BEER ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT for the rest of my life!"
"D. Good beer overall, not over the top hoppy. Can drink a few of these in a row."
"M/D - light bodied, crisp carbonation with a slightly bitter finish, the flavor is nice and it would be easy to drink alot of this."
"D- I'll have another."
"Fairly drinkable, but satisfying enough to enjoy just one."
"One of the best I've had of this style. Love the hop profile and the malt is actually what makes this a winner. The burps taste like leafy green hops. Top of the line."
"This is a well done blonde, I really enjoyed the hop level and found it quite drinkable."
"Relatively light, not overpowering with nice hops as well. Not a hop bomb, just a nice ale. Similar to pale ale in the mouth, with bitter finish, finish leaves me wanting just a bit more, but a solid beer for regular drinking."
"Definitely one of the better examples of the style that I've encountered thus far. Big and hoppy, but still light and easy to drink. A very nice bridge, or lead-in, to the coming winter and its warming requirements, beer or otherwise."
"Pours a rich golden yellow color and a thick cloud-like eggshell-colored head. The aroma is dominated by pine and earth hop characteristics, with maybe a little lemon creeping in as well. The flavor is likewise primarily driven by a dull, earthy hop character up front with a bit of peppery spice, all balanced by a comparatively subtle nutty sweetness. Finely carbonated, this one is easy to drink but not special in that regard, although it is noted that it tastes lighter than I would have expected for 6% alcohol. Overall, it is a solid, hop-forward golden ale."
"D - suited for the major hopsters, i enjoyed this beer but if you don;t like bitter beer this may not be for you."
"D: Nice beer. Didn't knock my socks off and feels a bit heavy for numerous helpings, but I didn't regret the purchase."
"The best bottles of this I've had approach Gumballhead. It's not quite there, but it's easier for me to get and I know it will be fresh. An easy beer for me to pick up annually, if it continues to be like this."
"Overall: The taste really skyrockets this into a notable state for me. One of my favorite New Belgiums ever. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good, semi-dark ale."
"D- Wasn't expecting a whole lot from the beer. Actually enjoyed the couple that I had. I'm more inclined to try some of their other seasonal beers now too."
"I really don't know a ton about the style but this is a home run."
"Well carbonated. Pleasant."
"The taste definitely grows on you. You can taste more flavors as you drink."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer & would drink my fair share of it, were it available to me. Well done, New Belgium, well done. This is an easily quaffable ale with layers of complexity aplenty in both the aroma & taste."
"Drinkability -- Overall, pretty good. Crisp, nice hop profile, the malt choices were interesting, albeit a little scattered. Wasn't thrilled, but I still enjoyed it a good deal."
"Nothing too special, but an alright beer that tries to cross an Oktoberfest with a hoppier lighter Ale."
"D- This is definitely a solid NB seasonal thats simplicity is what makes it great."
"Drinkability: This is a crisp, fairly bitter beer, but the hops don't have as much taste or complexity as I would have hoped. At least it doesn't have that damn biscuity Fat Tire taste that most of their American-style beers do."
" ~ For a blonde ale this has some nice character. This is a greeat session brew if you don't let the heavy carbonation get to ya. I could session this brew once a week. Give it a try."
"D: easy to down this by the six pack."
"Felt like a fall seasonal, had surprisingly few options, and settled on this. Pours a bright gold with a just slightly off white head. Head is creamy and recedes slowly leaving some thick lacing. The nose on this is incredibly potent. Lost of biscuity malts up front with some nice faint hop aromas to compliment. Unfortunately after the nose the taste is a bit subtle and kind of a let down but seems appropriate for the style. Malty up front with noble hops in the finish. Some nice sweet honey notes as well. Mouthfeel is a little disappointing, kind of thin and watery. Overall a solid,very drinkable beer. Not really sure why this is a fall seasonal thought, doesn't feel very fall like (beermail me if there is something obvious I'm missing that makes this a fall brew)."
"Quite drinkable. Paired great with chicken wings!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied, crisp and refreshing, and not overly carbonated which is a nice plus. Nice drinkable beer that actually has some flavor."
"Light yellow to gold color with half inch frothy head. Medium floral aroma, taste had an assertive hoppy bitterness up front that smooth out and left with a mildly bitter finish. Body was light to medium and was very drinkable. An excellent ale for early fall and very refreshing here in the warm South. Wish it was released in the summer but it is a nice alternative to the traditional fest beers."
"Drinks: I like what New Belgium has been doing with hops lately, but I'm not sure this one fits with the fall seasonal theme. It also seems to me a little over-hopped for an American blonde. Still, it's not bad."
"D: Another mediocre brew from a mediocre brewery. Fairly average except maybe appearance. Would be good with food or at a barbeque."
"I have to say I'm impressed with this. Of the New Belgium I've had this may be the best. Very good fall beer."
"I poured this beer into an oktoberfest mug, it pours a nice Orange golden color with the slightest lacing if a white head. The nose is nice and hoppy with exceptionally balanced sweet manliness. This is an exceptional oktober offering. Really well balanced with out being overly Mary like most oktober offerings. I wish this beer was on tap for more oktoberfest events, it is a great offering."
"D: I feel that this does not stand a chance for a autumn brew, too light and lacking up front flavors. While it goes down easy and if need be, I could drink plenty of this brew, there are many other offering that I would choose. Oh why New Belgium this style for a fall seasonal?"
"Poured from bottle into New Belgium Tulip. Color is golden with a fizzy white head and some nice lacing, but kind of ho hum. Smell is nothing i expected for a golden ale. Very hop forward, an amazing combination of grassy and tropical fruit notes. Some sweet mint in the background. A touch of sugary malt sweetness. Taste is similar to the smell. Tropical fruits up front, some malty sweet notes, and grassy bitterness in the finish. Not a perfect balance but it tastes great, a wonderful display of hops without being overly bitter. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and slightly sticky. Could have a cleaner finish. Drinkability is great. Not overly bitter, not overly sweet, not too high abv. The only downside to this is the hops has faded significantly since the first 6 pack I bought. Still a great beer, one of the best New Belgium has ever offered and by far the best blonde ale ive ever had."
"This is an interesting autumn seasonal. While most of them are either oktoberfest or pumpkin ales, this one ends up being one of the most hoppy beers in the NB line-up. It's not a bad beer, but people have to be in the mood for something resembling an IPA to enjoy it."
"We can't get New Belgium in Pennsylvania and that is a shame. Thanks to Simon for bringing the beer over for tasting at the after Big Pour 4 hangout, oh yeah and his cousin for bringing it up from SC. ( Yes, i stashed a couple so i could do a review proper )"
"Aftertaste is so smooth and drying...very, very nice."
"D: Highly drinkable, apv is not enough to make this something that couldn't be enjoyed over multiple pints with good company and a nice cigar."
"Drinkability isn't the greatest due to the huge fruity flavor this has. Also, it doesn't finish as crisp as I'd like, but on the whole, a very decent beer."
"D: After seeing what direction New Belgium took Ranger IPA in, this beer seems to be cut from similar cloth. The overall sensory theme appears the same, but here the sensory volume is dialed back. This is a solid and versatile summer pale ale, not to mention a fine counterpoint to Fat Tire."
"drinkability: good"
"NB actually did a good job on pretty much every aspect of this beer except the labeling. Fire the guy who decided this was a golden ale and that it should be released in the fall."
"This beer is very tasty, I expected a marzen this is more of a pale ale."
"After a rough day of disappointment after disappointment, this hit the spot. I don't believe my judgment is askew because of that, but what if it is? Good beer can make a bad day good again (and then bad again if you let yourself get all fuckered up)...anyway, this is pure simplicity without any ho-hum elements. I like."
"O: Solid offering from New Belgium, best one I've had to date outside of bomber offerings."
"A well-balanced American Blonde seasonal with lots of interesting interplay between hops and malts. Find it while it's still on tap."
"D-need to buy a sixer of this"
"D: This is a very drinkable beer. This could be a year round brew, or at the very least, available during summer and fall."
"Pours a transparent golden color with a one finger white head. Smell is of citrus hops with a little malt in there too. Taste is pretty complex, some pine citrus and grassy hops, there are some malts in there too, grainy taste. Finish is tasty, not too bitter. Mouthfeel is light, with good carbonation. Overall its a refreshing beer, very tasty. I love marzen/octoberfest brews, but this was a nice break in the trend. Very good, definitely a beer I will seek out again next fall."
"D- This beer was a ok at best. Nothing that I would really want to spend my money on. The lack of alcohol taste in the beer made it super drinkable. Although, this beer might just be a little old so I'll try it again from a place that I know keeps their beer rotated."
"D: let's just say I won't be having this again. It's way too fruity and flowery, especially for a Fall seasonal. Try Spring boys!"
"M/D: NB has surprised me again. This isn't a one dimensional beer due to the genius selection of hops used. Even though there's 'hop' in the name, this doesn't kill your palate with bitterness. Hoptober would be a great addition to their year round lineup."
"Appearance is a cloudy light blonde with a 1/4"" head with minimal lacing. Light hop aroma with toasty biscuit malt. Carbonation is ideal for the style and the first taste is citrus with a hint of peppery spice. Finishes with a moderate lingering bitterness. Drinkability was less than expected but would be able to have two or three in a row at the most. It has been a year since I first had it on draft and is pretty much as I remember it. A solid beer that I would happily drink on a cool fall day."
"This is a very good blond. Nice color, nice aroma , and nice flavor. More of a warm weather beer than what you expect for the fall but good to sit back with and watch a game. Best of the New Belgiums, in my opinion. Drinking from the bottle and poured it in a glass. Skimpy on the hops but overall a nice and smooth palate. I have to put this up as one of my favorite; however I am patial to blonds."
"Beautifully balanced and drinkable beer; normally, I'd see this as a fantastic summer beer, but the unorthodox release time does nothing t take away from what it is, which is a tasty, light-bodied beer that goes great with a huge variety of food."
"D: This is a solid beer however not what I was expecting. I was thinking hoppy Octoberfest and I feel this is more like a lighter APA. I should have known this since the beer is an ale and not a lager. This is a nice fruity ale and at 6% and 40IBU will not not kill you to drink a few."
"D: A solid beer, but nothing like a traditional Oktoberfest. Clearly an ale with the fruitiness and has a definite American influence. A crowd pleaser for a fall party."
"If you are looking for a traditional Oktoberfest, this beer is not for you. This Blonde Ale is great for the warmer Falls of Texas which is surprising considering it is brewed in Colorado. If you are looking to break away from the Oktoberfest glut in Sept and Oct, this is the beer for you."
"While many other breweries are rolling out their marzens, New Belgium clings to the final shreds of summer with this bright, hoppy blonde ale."
"D: New Belgium's beers are sort of hit or miss for me and blonde ales are not really my favorite, but this was quite enjoyable. I'd happily have this one again."
"I like this better than last year's Fall seasonal from New Belgium. Purchased in a Folly Pack (probably the most solid 12 pack you'll find at a grocery store) and poured into a 12oz mug. Hoptober is as advertised, hoppy. But not too hoppy, or too anything for that matter. In it are hints of dry citrus and fairly medium hops, with a decent amount of carbonation that adds an initial sharpness to the beer. As with many beers from New Belgium this beer tastes of good ingredients and modest aims. For what it is, and more importantly what it costs (Folly 12-Pack for 18.99reg, 13.99sale at your local Albertson's) Hoptober is pretty darn good."
"This is a nice change for Oktoberfest and autumn. While this is not very complex, it is extremely drinkable and refreshing. It fits the bill for a ""fest"" ale."
"It's not a bad beer to drink, but the flavors are pretty stout and like I said, I didn't feel they went very well together. It has great lacing, however."
"D: This is a nice beer overall. It's fairly light and goes down easily. I'll be revisiting this when it comes back around next year."
"Picked up as part of a mixed six pack last week on a whim. Poured a light golden color with a huge white head that poured over the sides. Light hoppy aroma, with similar hops on the palate, along with a little sweet malt. Decent, but ultimately forgettable."
"this is a great seasonal offering, especially if the prospect of a moderately-hopped complex golden ale sounds up your alley!"
"Drinkability - This was a very easy to drink, refreshing, crisp but round and full bodied beer. Certainly interesting and worth a try."
"2010 bottle. Pours a clear golden color. Very bubbly with a large white, frothy head. Smells of a lot of hops and some wheat. I'm digging the scent on it. Very subtle yet intriguing. Taste is initially a sweet, malty flavor with some definite rye notes. Then you get the hop flavors. Not very bitter, but hoppy at the same time. At the end you get some caramel and some very delightful fruitiness. The mouthfeel is very crisp and refreshing. A perfect beer for a warm summer night. The drinkability is VERY HIGH."
"D: Easy to drink, surprised its at 6%. Would go great with a volleyball game. Don't drink blonde ales much, but probably my favorite in awhile of the style."
"Medium bodied, soft finish, starts big and brash, ends smooth and quiet."
"The mouthfeel is to me the best part of this, bearing down on the tongue with ample hops and effervescence that stand up nicely. Overall, a very good hopped-up golden ale that is a nice change of pace from the normal Marzen and Fall lineup--which I also love. Good stuff."
"This is my ideal hot/mild weather beer. The bear looks amazing in a glass, its golden and clear with a good thick long lasting head. The aroma is a nice bouquet of hop, grassy and citrus. The taste, to quote The Lonely Island ""Jizzed in my pants"". Yeah its really that good, starts with wonderful blend of hop and stays all the way through. Good balance of malt and bitter. A wonderful vessel for hop flavor."
"I think this should be their summer release and their autumn/oktoberfest should be something a little darker but hey thats just me..."
"It will transition you from a great summer, into the perfect uncertainty that those late summer months will bring."
"The hop profile is very similar to Mighty Arrow. The rye and wheat does something for the texture here that makes it a pretty good golden."
"Very good. Easy drinking. One of the better beer from New Belgium."
"Go try this one out, but don't wait for the calendar to tell you when it is time...go now."
"This just earned a spot on my favorite list. Superb!"
"cheers!"
"Pours clear with a thin lacy head. Nice fresh hoppy smell. Slight hoppy taste reminds me more of a pale ale. Creamy mouthfeel and nice and light and crisp. Sometimes it is nice to drink a beer that will not make you feel full and bloated. This is a great beer if you are looking to sit back and relax with a group of friends."
"Despite my scores I really like this beer. Another one that reaches a little beyond the style, but I really like the taste of this one. Not too bland like many a golden ale I have tried."
"Poured into pint glass. Almost yellow in color with creamy white head, great retention and lacing. Smell is great with some citrusy hops, pineapple, and sweet malt. Taste is about the same. A sweeter malt taste at first then a definite citrus kick, really has a pineapple taste i swear with a little orange. Hops are definitely there as well and add a nice balance to the initial sweetness. Mouthfeel was light and slightly oily thanks to the hops, very smooth though. Overall a great beer and quite honestly perhaps my favorite from New Belgium yet."
"d 4-4.5 not that i would go to lengths to seek it out, but hoptober is very drinkable in the right situation."
"Great golden ale overall! This is one of the better beers I've had from New Belgium recently."
"The brew is a little hoppy at first and then the nice sweetness of cereal grains kicks in and finishes quite clean to leave the palate satisfied."
"D: A strong summer beer, nice flavor-wise with a killer aroma. For a blonde ale, it kicks tail."
"Clean finish. Good for late summer, sitting on the porch."
"Drink is very high for this one, a very nice fall beer."
"D: this light-bodied beer seems more appropriate for the summertime, but is damned tasty and refreshing any time of the year."
"Mouthfeel is medium-light with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"D - Very drinkable, although in my humble opinion rather unexciting. I certainly don't mind drinking it, but I don't plan on running out to get more any time soon."
"Tasty beer, I would buy more if it were available to me."
"overall a really, really well done beer and a new favorite from new belgium for sure."
"D- Not great. Despite gorgeous looks and wonderful and complex smells, the tastes are lost in a smoldering collapsed pile. I hate to slam a local favorite so bad, but I don't like the taste of this."
"I liked it, good drinkability. Just a really nice blend."
"D- Surprisingly high. I have never enjoyed a blond ale before this one, and I am pretty high on this one. Nice beer."
"New Belgium has done it again, a hoppy fall season ale. For those that don't like the fall season offerings, this one New Belgium is friggin good! Really crisp, almost like a lager. Sweet and balanced with great cleansing hoppy and slight lemony aftertaste. A great beer on a hot Indian Summer evening. Even BMC drinkers mayb enjoy this libation."
"Pours to a 1-inch white head that falls to about 3/8-inch layer with ample lacing. Brilliantly filtered golden color. Smells like an IPA. Aroma is a strong hit of citrusy and slightly spicy/catty ""C" hops (centennial, cascades, etc.) some sweet grainy/honey-like/biscuits in the background. Flavor is quite surprising. With all the hop aroma, the mouth expects puckering IPA-like bitterness. Not here, it is hop flavor and enough alpha acids to balance the sweet specialty malts, rye and oats. It tastes almost like a dessert wine with the crisp sticky sweetness that fades fast to a bittersweet balance. Mouthfeel is on the heavy side for the style and strangely satisfying. Easy to drink and enjoy year-round, IMO. Why make this seasonal? it could be a great crossover to hoppy pale ales and IPAs for Fat Tire and Newcastle Brown drinkers."
"After a hard day at work this beer beats most. After a generous pour down the middle a wonderful white head was produced. The aroma of centennial hops filled my nose. It was a wonderful way to finish off the work day. The color was a deep gold and crystal clear. After my first taste I really was able to feel how refreshing this beer truly is, and I enjoyed ever sip. Not your normal fall seasonal, due to the lack of heavy sweet notes, but none the less one of the better seasonal beer I have had."
"Pours a clear golden with a delicate white head that leaves nice lacing. The aroma has some piney and minty hops upfront, along with some biscuit, honey, esters and alcohol...pleasing though lacking complexity. The flavor also has juicy hop notes initially (piney, citrusy, minty), along with biscuit, caramel and honey, fruity esters, minerals, and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is smooth and light, and drinkability is very good. This is easily the best blonde ale I've had, but really should be considered a pale ale or IPA and against stiffer competition it wouldn't fare so well."
"A substantial brew and something you have to try before the great dirt nap that awaits us all."
"New Belgium Brewing Company--Hoptober Golden Ale--Fall Seasonal--A bonfire of citrus notes, fruity cheers and a bold, hoppy finale. 2010 12 oz. Bottle. 6.00% ABV. 40 IBU's. (3.5 / 5.0) Golden Ale--IPA. Lacy thin white head. Clear thin bright yellow gold color. Floral rich citrus hop front. Thin dry sweet light mild fruit semi spicy wheat rye oat pale malt crisp Golden Ale body. Mild flavor infused with hops. Clean dry mild hop citrus end. A touch weak. Sampled 8/1/2010. 6-Pack $7.49."
"D: If not for the medium body, I could drink this beer all day! It's a bit strong and heavy to be a true session beer, but I would gladly split a 6-pack with a friend."
"D: This golden ale is enjoyable for its crisp refreshing quality. The balance tips in favor of hops throughout the drinking of this brew, and the pine from those hops makes this beer definitely fall-appropriate. I enjoyed drinking it, and will drink it again as the fall season approaches and my desire for a mild pine flavor and excellent crisp mouth feel grows with the season change. Good stuff."
"Seem on the strong, bitter side for a blond ale but tasty."
"D - One of the better NB beers that I see around the hops definitely add some life to this beer making it fairly good to me worth a try sometime"
"i'd agree with the earlier reviewer that this one is more of a pale than a blonde."
"Medium body, with a moderate-to-high carbonation bite. Somewhat creamy. Crisp, smooth, and refreshing. An enjoyable brew certainly, but not sure it really fits in teh American Blonde category...seems more like a different take on an American Pale."
"This is a nice, solid beer. I like that New Belgium has started to release a few more hop focused beers. This isn't nearly as good as fresh Mighty Arrow, but it definitely satisfies my inner need for hops."
"12 oz. bottle served in a pint glass. Pours a completely clear golden color with a orange-reddish hue, good frothy off-white head, good lacing. Aroma is sweet caramel malts, pine, resin, and citrus. Flavor is sweet malts, bread, citrus, spicy and resin hops. Mouthfeel is light, fairly active carbonation, and a moderately bitter finish. Good lawnmower beer, well balanced, tasty."
"D: Quenching enough for an (Indian) summer day, robust enough wash down tailgate food, and complex enough for sitting, sipping and thinking. It has a lot going on, yet it all works super well together for a refreshing and enjoyable brew."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0911-SeanH"
"I guess it was my loss that I never bought it all the times I saw it."
"Beer poured golden with a two finger head that is leaving rings of lacing behind. Nose is wonderful, full of floral hops even halfway through. Taste is hop forward, citrus to start, balanced with a good malt backbone, finishing peppery. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and fairly smooth. Drinkability is good. This is a nice well balanced beer with some different characteristics that make it quite good!"
"This is a big brew yet elegant. Finish is short grapefruit with undertones of pine. This could easily be a ""go to"" daily beer."
"Golden/yellow clear body with a white head. The aroma is bready and earthy with notes of honey. Lot going on in the flavor dept. Earthy rye and caramel malt is balanced with spicy, floral, peppery, citrusy hops. The long malt and hop bills provide a balanced and layered flavor. I wish this was around all year, I really enjoyed this beer!"
"Hoptober Golden Ale is the real deal and is a fantastic addition to the brewery's seasonal lineup. Along with Mighty Arrow Pale Ale, this is my new favorite New Belgium brew."
"Not as sweet as most New Belgium's offerings, a pleasant surprise."
"Quite easy drinking, a bit light on the mouthfeel, but notba bad beer at all."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability rate higher, because it doesn't fade, nor does it get tiresome."
"Flavors of hops upfront, mix of citrus and floral, notes of honey and cinnamon. Some grapefruit rind in the finish. Piney notes linger. Full mouthfeel, tingly carbonation, a bit dry, good beer."
"Bottle from TheOtherDave. Poured cleaqr copper color with an average off-white frothy head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate earthy hop and malt aroma. Medium body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Medium earthy bitter flavor with a medium bitter finish of moderate duration. Good drinkable brew."
"i am a fan of all oktoberferst style or spin offs so i had to try this one. It pour smooth golden into my glass and had a great malt smell with hop notes following right after. It is good with food or by itself. Just one more great beer put out by the awesome New Belgium brewing co."
"Poured from the bottle to a nice golden color with a thin white head that lingered well and left okay lacing. Hoppy floral nose with a hint of malt, carried over smoothly into the taste. Mouthfeel of this medium bodied beer was slightly bittersweet, with a slight tingle. rounded to a nice, long, smooth finish. The best I've had from New Belgium."
"D: A very good beer and a good alternative to the typical American adjunct. Lightly malted, a little sweet, and bursting with hop flavor without any hop bitterness."
"About as easy as they come to drink, with a small carbonation which has a bit of a sting on the end."
"Hoptober is my sleeper hit of the season; a deliciously subtle and complex session brew that resists easy pigeon-holing and absolutely is memorable. Give this one a few more years and it very well be THE go-to Autumn brew for many more folks than just myself. This is one of the top beers I've tried in 2009. Please go buy some Hoptober."
"Good drinkability, goes down smooth and refreshingly."
"This was nice. A Blonde Ale infused with a hearty amount of dank and earthy hop character, this reminded me a lot of a wet hop beer at times. Good drinkibility on this as well. A fine fall seasonal from New Belgium."
"The beer pours a brilliant golden color with a clingy, moderate white head. The aroma is highly hoppy-citrus and floral. The flavor is highly hoppy as well, citrusy with a bit of sweet, doughy malt in the background. The hop bitterness is medium-high; this combined with a slightly dry finish yields a hop forward beer. The carbonation and body are medium. Overall a well brewed beer, nothing out of this world but certainly tasty."
"Medium bodied, smooth and very drinkable, a really nice fall beer but I could do this year round with no problem."
"Nice foamy head topping two fingers an sticky lacing. Just exceptional bubbling, hundreds of tiny columns of bubbles rising to the top of this foamy brew. The color is a golden hay with light copper hues mixed in. Medium hoppy nose, adding light citrus and heavy earthen grass aromas to a dry pilsner malt smell. The taste is mildly bitter to start Repeats of the earthen grass, but no citrus. The malts add a dry toasted gristy taste and mouthfeel. Pretty good balance for a hoppy blonde ale. Good tasting beer, but the hoppiness makes this beer falls a little short for drinkability on my scale. Still very good overall."
"Overall, a very nice beer from NB. Well worth a try. Or two."
"Drinkability is great this brew is so easy drinking nothing special really but my taste buds keep yelling more please. Usually this time of year have quit a few Oktoberfests but tried this one and have been buying more for some reason. Just a good easy drinking beer."
"D - A good early fall beer, it's crisp and refreshing qualities blended with it's medium-body and bouquet of hops makes it a drinking winner! A fantastic beer to cool off with after a brisk afternoon of raking leaves."
"D: Very easy to drink. Smooth and nicely balanced. Moderate ABV makes it very sessionable."
"Overall a more impressive offering than I expected. A great session beer. I just don't know how it works as an autumn seasonal."
"I get the spiciness of the rye, crisp wheat and creamy oats, but it almost seems like it is too much for a blonde ale to handle, especially with the multitude of hops assaulting the palate at the same time. Bitterness is high and hop flavor is very grassy and hay-like. After the delicious aroma, I feel like the taste has let me down a bit. Just too much going on in this beer for me to find it overly enjoyable, although I applaud NB for trying something like this."
"D: Very tasty and not too overbearing or thick. Definitely a delicious session beer."
"Not bad at all.. I liked the spring seasonal a little better but there's nothing wrong with this one at all..."
"D - excellent session seasonal from NB."
"Taste was lightly hoppy, apples and grains. Very crisp and clean. Easy drinking, but a bit on the plain side."
"Generally not a huge fan of New Belgium beers but this one is pretty good."
"It's fine to drink one or more, but there are many better choices - just save a good IPA from the summer and enjoy it during the fall if you're looking for hoppy. Not sure why they felt the need to position this as a fall seasonal, as it's clearly out of season."
"it's not a bad beer if you like this style. i found it to be sweet like apple juice for some reason. good balance of hops and malt, but i found it to be rather plain. i have nothing against it, but i probably wouldn't purchase again."
"Pours a golden, mostly clear with moderate white head which mostly diminishes. Good lacing throughout. Floral, pine and citrus aromas dominate the nose. Well-balanced with good crisp, slightly bitter finish. Malt presence is overpowered by the hops. A very good offering from NB - one of their best and have enjoyed several of these this fall - CHEERS!"
"D- I really enjoyed this beer. It sort of reminds me of Sierra Nevada Summerfest, with a creamier body. Seems like a nice transition to fall beer."
"Some light ales just don't have much going on... this one does. Nice work NB."
"This crisp golden ale lives up to it's name in the aroma department, with a moderate malt character in support. Pours out with a moderate well-lasting head and demonstrates a brilliant clarity. Flavor is medium bitter with mild malt flavors with a bit of toasty dryness. Bittering is slightly sharp and lingers well on the palate. A real back of the throat sensation."
"It's a pretty amber color with a decent amount of hops in the aroma. The taste is hoppy bit it isn't overpowering. It's actually pleasant to have despite the apparent lack of malt presence."
"Overall, a good but not great beer. The aroma had me excited but it feel apart in the taste. Pick one direction or the other and I think it would be a winner. Mix it and it misses for me. Rotation: avail here. The 3 in my mixed 12 pack are enough for me unless I got a tap opportunity."
"I am pleasantly surprised by this beer. I usually do not go for beers that are this lightly colored, but it really is quite refreshing, and would serve as a solid session beer on a crisp autumn day of football. Very nice."
"Pours a nice light yellow/semi-gold color with nice head and a bit of nice lacing. Nice scent, clean and fairly crisp with a nice sweetness and a faint bitter hop aroma. Nice taste, clean and clear with a nice mixture of hops and malts, although nothing really stuck out; balanced but not strong. Goes down quite well, nice and smooth. Would be a much better summer beer, I think, than a fall brew."
"D- It's new to me, and I like it. Clean and simple with hops taking the lead role."
"D: Good. I might order another. I won't buy it again this year, but maybe next year."
"Yep, it's golden alright. Light carbonation, small white head that faded into a ring but is leaving some average lacing on the glass. Nice floral, hoppy aroma, hints of honey and light malty sweetness. Flavor is pretty well balanced between semi-sweet malts and lightly bitter hops. Light bready malts and lighty citric/herbal hops. Very easy drinking, nothing particularly outstanding, but it's a good golden ale to be sure. This would be a great session beer if the ABV were dropped by about 1.5%"
"Drinkability - Not a bad brew. crisp and dry. Would be good to pair with food (Orange Chicken?) or to drink on a really hot day, but nothing exciting here."
"D: A drinkable beer, though it doesn't exactly stand out. Blonde Ales are rarely standouts."
"Clear gold color with a small white head and a decent lace. Smells of floral hops with some malt. Taste is mostly floral hops with bit of a malt backbone. Light bodied, decent carbonation, but overall, nothing very exciting. I won't be buying this again."
"D - A drinkable offering, but just a bit boring in my opinion. Muted aroma and flavor - less hop zing than I expected. Another decent offering from New Belgium that falls short of great for me."
"Drinkability- This is a nice easy drinking brew that I really enjoyed. The rye is in perfect balance with the rest of the beer and adds that little something extra. A nice brew that I'm glad I decided to try."
"Drinkability is superb. Huge flavors, light body, and decent carbonation makes this a very good session brew that I will come to enjoy all through the fall. Good job New Belgium"
"overall better than most golden ales."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - This was a floral delight, it's bold & intense and I really enjoyed it. I drank about 2 before I got a little tired of all that floral pine taste/smell, it became a little one noted I guess. I do think it needed a bit of balance with some malt sweetness as well, pretty good on a cold evening though so I wouldn't pass this one up. Cheers!"
"Herbal hops mingle with bready malt sweetness in the aroma. Hops are fairly dominant, with clean bitterness and green, leafy flavors. Malt base is light, but bread-like and substantial. The malt flavors, while subtle, are most interesting. Almost lager-like in its clean mouthfeel and lack of esters, Hoptober is a nice blend of bright American hops and a German-esque malt profile. This beer hints at Oktoberfests, while keeping hop heads happy. I liked it much more than I expected, and it is certainly my favorite New Belgium brew to date."
"D - GIMME MOAR. This is absolutely my favorite of New Belgium's offerings. I took care of a 6-er over the last two days because it was so good."
"D - Extremely refreshing! Great."
"I thought it was pretty tasty. Not what I expected, but was actually a good surprise."
"It's drinkable, but would be better in the summer. Good lawn mower beer. It's over hopped and under malted in my opinion. I doubt I'll buy this again."
"After a half a pint, the beer tastes better than ever. The opening of each sip is smooth biscuity sweetness. Then the tag team of hops and carbonation bring the beer back into balncce before the hops charge on alone and leave with your mouth prepped for the next round."
"Verdict: It's always nice to see New Belgium playing on the hoppier side of the spectrum, and Hoptober ends up being a tasty, easily drinkable, and cheerful little beer."
"All in all, if you like hops, you'll love this one."
"This is like no blonde ale I have ever had before. Pours a clear yellow, slightly darker than macro color, with a large white head that had excellant retention. Heavy spotty lacing is left on the glass. A lot of hops in the aroma with the customary New Belgium malt bill lingering in the background. Light, crisp flavor from the ""C" hops give some citrus notes, also some spice and grassy notes as well. Slight sweetness at first but finishes bitter and clean. New Belgium packed a lot of hop flavor in this beer. Light body with lively carbonation without being harsh. One nitpick I have with this beer is the unnecessarly high ABV. Is it because it is a Fall seasonal? If it could be at 4.5% ABV or lower I could drink these all day. This has been my favorite New Belgium beer to date, and it is a Blonde Ale!"
"So far so good on the New Belgiums as far as I am concerned. A good solid brew."
"Darn near dangerous drinkability. The flavors are unique and will not leave you bored. The taste isn't overbearing and nicely refreshing. I would pair this with a healthy plate of pasta and chicken with a white sauce."
"I am quite disappointed because NB is one of my favorite breweries--especially for the Belgian styles. I was hoping for something really flavorful and delicious. I wasn't sure what to expect. I had it in my mind that it might be a little bit like Duvel--which is delicious. But, unfortunately, this beer misses the mark. Sorry, NB! I'll still buy plenty of Abbey, Trippel, and 1554, but I won't be picking up this one again."
"Poured a golden color with a creamy head that left nice lacing on the glass. The color made me think this was not going to pack the flavor it did. It had a nice citrus flavor with the hop bite being present, but not overwhelming. Very balanced and easy to drink. You could have several of these and enjoy each one."
"Pours a pale copper with a thin beige head. Nose has floral hops over candy malts and spices. Taste is also on the hoppy side for a Marzen, but still has some nice malt characteristics. Body is a bit light, but well carbonated. I like the addition of extra hops to the style, but would also like to see a stronger base beer."
"A good beer on a cool fall evening, maybe paired with a chili dog watching the world series."
"Otherwise...pleasantly surprised with the contrast this beer poses to other fall seasonals."
"D - This is a very unique beer, somewhere between an APA and IPA, with a little too much strength - alcohol and hops - for a blonde ale in my opinion. It's quite wonderful when you're in the mood for hops, and quite sessionable to a certain degree."
"D - I enjoyed this one, though it's hoppier than any other blonde ale that I remember drinking. I'd probably call it a pale ale, but whatever it is, I liked it. The flavor is clean and fresh, and I could easily drink a few."
"Pale yellow ,clear, with a larrgish frothy white head. Nice fresh hop aromas from this one smells at least way above 40 IBUs! Flavour has a strong lemony hop combination..plenty citrus but not too bitter, slightly fruity, Malts underneath. Lot of peppery goodness in the end after taste. Also slightly salty adding to the drinkability. I liked the palate on this it is light but not really highly carbonated. Very drinkable , good Golden Ale."
"Overall a decent beer and a nice celebration of hops and their varied characteristics. Nicely drinkable, the dry finish leaves one reaching for more."
"Simple, tasty, and satisfying."
"Overall impression: Definitely a drinkable offering, I tried this on draft and wasn't impressed - but I'm really enjoying the six pack, so maybe it was my taste buds or the lines or something."
"D: A good beer overall. I would drink this any day.. It is a nice between beer, something for when I want hops, but not as much as a pale ale or IPA. Good balance, and a pretty good gateway beer."
"Its a little thinner than I would like, but easily drinkable. A nice change of pace from sweeter, maltier fall seasonals."
"D: It was good, but I would have liked it better without the hops."
"Clear golden with a creamy eggshell head of different sized bubbles that lasts awhile and leaves fine lacing on the glass. The nose is fresh with piney hop and caramel malt. Nice mild hop forward flavors are balanced with toasty malt. The oats impart a smooth mouthfeel on this one. An easy drinker, I dig it."
"Creamy and easy to drink, hoptober is a beer's beer. It has perfect amounts of ingredients and is very well balanced. An absolute pleasure to drink and one that goes down smooth and finishes strong."
"Not bad at all. I can see the appeal for this beer. It just does not do a lot for me. This really is worth a try though."
"d- much better than i thought it would be, definately sessionable, i'm glad i got this included as an extra in a trade, solid beer overall."
"Paired well with chips and bean dip around 6pm on a fall day : )"
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a clear golden color. There was a small white head on it that dropped off rather quickly, but left a bit of lacing. The aroma is rather decent. There is a lot going on in this one. Some citrus and pine hop notes up front. Also some grassiness and malts in the background. A mild hop bite to the taste. Medium bodied. Some malts and earthiness to the taste also. Pretty easy drinking. Not bad at all!"
"Overall: I love 1554 from NB...this one is up there. Very drinkable and something I would buy to impress my friends. Cheers!"
"I found this quite drinkable. A very good brew for when the temperatures drop"
"Had hopes that this might actually be a well hopped offering from NB for once. You would think calling it ""Hoptober"" that it might actually have a hop kick to it but it didn't. Would not recommend to anyone."
"This is nice beer. A good change of pace from Oktoberfests and Harvest Ales. I'm impressed. Probably will pick up some more before it leaves for the year. With Mighty Arrow and this, they have two seasonals I'd probably get every time around. I wouldn't have put it at around 6%. Wears it well."
"Pours a clear, golden color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, earthy malt, and sweet malt, and some citrus. Fits the style of an American Blonde Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops (not too strong or bitter), earthy malt, sweet malt, citrus (fruit-loops), and some more hops in the finish. Overall, good bodied, smooth, inviting, well-blended blonde ale."
"Hoptober Golden Ale was pale golden in color with good clarity. It had a thick white head with decent retention and lacing. The aroma was nice with plenty of malt and hops. The taste was more hops than malt, lightly bitter with a dry hoppy finish. It was medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was good. Overall this is a good beer that I will be buying more of."
"Pour leaves a couple inches of foam, lace is good. Color is a little bit darker than smell suggests. Hints of citrus, touch of floral. Very, very hoppy taste. Extremely creamy mouthfeel. Definitely agree this is more like an APA. Pretty powerful for a New Belgium. One of the better seasonal efforts by NB."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a crisp pale yellow with a slightly frothy off-white head. Aroma is a mild blend of sweet malts and citrus hops. The taste is a nice subtle blend of citrus hops and pale malts with a nice subtle lingering sweetness. The beer is on the light side of medium with decent carbonation. This is certainly an interesting beer, one that would also be good in summer."
"A damn tasty beer New Belgium has crafted here. Although it's called ""Hoptober", the grain bill is the highlight for me, as the rye and oats meld perfectly to form a sublime, earthy smoothness to the body. Suggestions of wet hay and raw oatmeal, before a spicy kick from the rye hits mid-palate. Hops take charge of the finish, adding a great, bitter balance with notes of citrus flesh and green mint. Mouthfeel is a bit aggressive for the style, but that's not too much of an issue for me. Although this won't be the most in-your-face brew that New Belgium has to offer--far from it--but the flavor of Hoptober is both original and superbly well-balanced. An easy choice and easier drinking...seek this one out if you can!"
"Taste:"
"Not very good."
"Overall a decent lawnmower beer."
"Taste is similar to the smell, light bodies and floral with a slight bitterness up front but smooths out in the end to leave you with a light malt and a slight yeasty taste. Really a very refreshing beer especially for the season. Drinks very easy and I could see myself drinking quite a few in one sitting. Great for a cool fall afternoon."
"Drinkability: Pleasant, tasty blonde, golden, whatever you want to call it that goes down fairly easy. It's one I could drink down in substantial quantities and would love to pair with food of some kind."
"I really liked this one, it's one of the more unique beers I've had in a while. Just very refreshing. It's totally satisfying in all aspects you have your malts, hops, and just that overall beer craving - plus it's from the great folks at New Belgium. What else could you ask for?"
"Another good beer from NB - they continue to crank out nice beers at an economical price."
"pours a perfect golden color with a very fresh head and nice lacing the smell is malts and spice and hops a little citrus..taste is the same it has a smooth malty start followed by a crisp hop/citrus flavor ..its quite tasty very drinkable...to me its like a hopped up wheat ..this brew would be great all summer instead of the fall its a very solid beer and its the 1st one from new belgium that does not have the proprietary yeast taste ..i like all of NB brews but have not found one that is over the top.. again this is a great blonde/pils/lager/pale?..and is recommended"
"Not your typical fall release, but I really did enjoy the overall flavors of this beer. Light bodied, and quite crisp. On one hand I am glad that New Belgium isn't necessarily following industry trends by releasing an Oktoberfest, but on the other hand, I feel like this beer could get more enjoyment during the warm summer months. A good beer overall, however."
"12 ounce bottle poured into pint glass. Pours dark gold with a tinge of amber and a frothy off-white head. Aroma is citrus and hop resin with some sweetish malt. Flavor is just really solid. Complex hop profile includes citrus, apple, and just enough resinous character to temper the sweetness. Solid pale/caramel malt influence as well. Really excellent balance, super easy to drink. I'm pretty impressed with this one."
"update 09/2011 super peachy flavor"
"D: a nicely hopped brew and a nice diversion from the usual autumn brews. I still have yet to find my niche with New Belgium. This is a decent brew and easy to put a few down the hatch"
"As I drank more the more I noticed the creamy,lush mouthfeel the oats imparted so I gave the mouthfeel a higher score."
"Drinkability- Thinking more of a lighter APA rather than a Blonde Ale, but still drinkable and better than average."
"Flavorful and quite easy to drink. Smells stronger than it tastes, basically what we have here is a hoppy pale ale. Tasty beer I can recommend."
"Overall, a solid NBB brew. Pretty hoppy for a golden ale. I really like the hop flavors and think this would rate as a solid well balanced pale ale."
"Thanks dpodratsky!"
"This is now one of my more favorite Oktoberfest brews, although it has Magic Hat's to compete against."
"Surely not what I was expecting yet an interesting beer that seems a bit homeless in the style department. Or perhaps more appropriately it has many homes in that regard."
" I expected more of an oktoberfest style martzen, overlooking the golden ale part. It didn't dissapoint though. The wife and I tore though a 12pack of this in just two days, so yeah. It's good stuff."
"Very easy to drink this one overall, for the hopheads this one will be right up your ally everyone else I say give it a shot and let it warm up a little before you judge it"
"12oz bottle served in a shaker pint. Pours a brilliant pale gold with a bit more than a finger of white head. Nice citrus hop aroma, but not overpowering. Also some bready malt in the aroma. Light to medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Not as much going on in the flavor. Some spicy flavors in the finish. Restrained hop bitterness. Nice and drinkable."
"Appearance is a golden yellow with a thin head, but fair lace. Smell has a big aroma of hops, malt and citrus. Taste has a very nice balance of malt and hop bringing out the citrus, but not overdoing it with the bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium that has a slickness with just the right amount of carbonation to go down smooth. Considering the hops involved, it was a rather clean finish that made it very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: very smooth drinking beer. i would drink it again."
"D - Great session beer. Doesn't live up to the name IMHO. This is a good BBQ beer that might help BMC people get into craft. I wouldn't turn this one down, but I won't seek it out again. The best thing about this beer was the smell."
"Drinks really easy, nothing too exciting here, but a decent session ale, none the less"
"A hoppy golden ale to be enjoyed in the fall"
"12oz. Poured a golden yellow with a fluffy white head that held good retention and left sticky lacing all the way down the glass. Aromas were pleasant floral hops coupled with freshly squeezed citrus - mainly lemon with a hint of orange. Tastes were complex and very well balanced, consisting of biscuity malt - slightly bready, fresh crisp hop providing some lemon and grapefruit zest and some herbal qualities. Slight caramel mixed in with a peppery finish from the rye. Bitterness is present, but plays so well with the other flavors. Mouth-feel is light-to-medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and ever so mildly oily allowing the hop resins to cover the palate. Nice golden ale background with an awesome hop bite. The hop and malt medley is greatly balanced providing remarkable drinkability - this was much better than I anticipated. I also like the way the hop flavor is so pronounced without the huge bitterness - nice change of pace. This is the reason I love American craft brewers - they can take a classic style and completely change the way it is brewed, add different ingredients and come up with something that actually is reminiscent of an Oktoberfest Märzen with a definite American flare. Great idea and a fantastic outcome!"
"Bought a single bottle of this stuff. Pours a golden clear color. Smells hoppy with citrus. Tastes pretty good hits you with some hops off the bat then ends on some citrus and malts making it easy to drink. Mouth feel is pretty light all and all pretty drinkable. In the end it is a pretty good brew, Not sure if I would buy any more though."
"Maybe I was fooled when I bought this thinking it was a Marzen- but it doesn't matter, its a good solid beer."
"Pours a bright golden color with a good 1/2inch foam on the top. The smell somewhat funky as to what was expected. Aroma isn't that strong and really doesn't stick out. Maybe it's me. Bottle says it's a 5 hop 4 malt cornucopia of the earth and I get it but this doesn't really bring anything to the front. I keep getting an almost Belgian funk on the inhale before the sip but then comes a mixture of hops and malts. Sometimes it is a bit sweet others bitter. I am gonna have to try this one again."
"Once again another new seasonal beer from New Belgium. This Hoptober (not to be confused for an Oktoberfest style) will be released as their fall seasonal. This Golden Ale is comprised of five hops (Centennial, Cascade, Sterling, Willamette, and Glacier) and four malts, in which the pale and wheat malts are mashed together with rye and oats. The beer pours with clear golden color and foamy white head with aromas of citrus. Flavors of grapefruit very prevalent throughout the palate with a slight hint orange. The finish is crisp and dry but is short lived. Overall this new seasonal from New Belgium was okay, but really it reminded me of a water downed IPA."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is slightly carbonated with some astringency. The body of the beer is medium light. This is actually a really good blonde ale. I am very surprised. I will enjoy the other Hoptober's from the brewery."
"D: This is another solid and drinkable beer from New Belgium. This isn't quite a session beer and perhaps is too hoppy for what I want in the Fall, but this is a good beer that goes down quite well."
"D-Deterred slighly by a balance too much towards the bitterness, which defied my expectations and hindered its drinkability compared to typical Oktoberfest brews. Still, I enjoyed this beer."
"D-Nice creative golden ale that is a joy to drink. Only 40 IBU but it smells and tastes very hop forward."
"D - Simply put, this is the best ""American Blonde Ale"" that I've ever had. A great hop presence with a sweet caramel taste that all blonde ales have."
"This reminds me of Sierra Nevada's Summerfest Ale. Anyways, nose is nice and hoppy with citrus flavors coming through. There's mostly hops in the flavor, though its not pale ale like. It's very refreshing. Malt is very light, but plays a role in complimenting the citrus hoppiness with sweetness. A good unfilling beer if you've got a hop craving."
"Overall- The name lead me to think it was going to be a oktoberfest one off. It is not. Neither do I think this fits an American Blonde."
"M/D: Light bodied, relatively smooth, a bit prickly at times and slightly slick. Drinkability is good. Overall, a solid, surprising beer."
"This is sort of like the barley malt of a very hoppy wheat beer. This is the hoppiest American Blonde I've tasted, and it's one of those beers where you can really only taste the hops. If you're into that then this is perfect. A departure from you're typical Blonde Ale, and an enjoyable one. This could probably also be classified as an American Pale Ale, but whatever it is, recommended."
"Mouth: Dominated by hops, all the way. Very piney now that it's in the mouth. I mean, I don't get it. I was excited by the label because the October part of it makes me think malts, and of course the hops part hops. But there is absolutely no balance. I'm looking for an over-hopped German style beer. Now I just get an over-hopped seltzer. Not so much going on here. Not my favorite New Belgium beer. Mouth feel is somewhat flabby."
"Drinkability - Quite so. I can't wait to have a couple of these on a sunny, cooler Autumn day. I am extremely glad I picked this up today. I was about to put it back (seeing as I have way to much other stuff I need to finish off at home) but threw caution to the wind. I will probably have a couple with fondue tonight after trying my Oro De Calabaza!"
"drinkability is great i only wish this was not just a seasonal release"
"For those who don't really like a lot of hops, at least give this one a chance through roughly a third of a bottle or glass and then make a decision. Can't wait to have this one on tap."
"An enjoyable and solid Blonde ale from New Belgium."
"Overall this beer smells great but the taste doesn't follow through as much as I'd hoped. Still, it's worth a shot."
"Notes - An interesting, hopped up take on a blonde ale. In retrospect, I'm surprised this hasn't been done before. It seems like a warm weather beer to me, but here in Texas October can still be fairly hot, so it's all good."
"D: Very drinkable beer. Could def sit down with a six pack and not feel too full. Very nice."
"d- overall a very good beer. one of new belgium's better beers. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will likely enjoy it again soon."
"I could drink a ton of these"
"The oats are the ringer for me, and they add they inimitatable glossy beefy slickness in the feel. Yet this still drinks with abandon with its sparkling carbonation. This shows a fantastic amount of complexity on its smallish frame, as each of its components takes its turn in the spotlight. It's sometimes difficult to slow the gulps down in order to savor and parse it."
"Overall, a very solid bier that does not disappoint on any level. Do yourself a favor and pick up a few of these. Prosit!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and somewhat smooth with good carbonation."
"Drinkability: A respectable hoppy blonde ale. I've had better and I've had worse. All in all a decent seasonal offering."
"This is a very refreshing beer that's incredibly easy to drink. I could only find this as a six pack and I'm certainly looking forward to the remaining bottles."
"Drinkability is moderate. The ABV is relatively low and well incorporated making for a nearly sessionable beer. The flavor profile is fairly interesting and pleasing as well which brings me back to the glass every now and again. Overall not a bad beer."
"Overall, a very pleasant surprise from a brewery that I don't have high expectations for. I'm sure this beer will be near you soon, I think you'll be as happy with it as I am."
"D: A geat seasonal beer for sitting on the porch watching the harvest moon rise. Two or three of this beer at a setting would be plenty. I would be this beer again. Toured the brewery in August and would recommend the tour, very interactive and casual."
"Just a fun side note, but did anybody else notice the guy on the label to the far right? Kind of funny."
"On the palate this comes across beautifully crisp with lovely citrus from the hops, a pleasant malt background, herbal qualities again, and has a bit of dryness/crispness that you might normally appreciate in other styles such as a bohemian pils. This is one of the most clean, refreshing, and drinkable ales I've sampled in a long time. Amazing result from New Belgium."
"A very tasty blonde; super silky mouthfeel and excellent hopping converge in New Belgium's Hoptober Golden Ale. I would love to get a number for the IBUs on this one. Also, I would love to see this on draught, it may lose something coming from the bottle; nonetheless, a perfect beer for the end of summer and start of autumn."
"D - A good brew. A winner for New Belgium. I enjoyed this almost as much as mighty arrow."
"Overall/Drinkability: Highly drinkable. Scarily drinkable, in fact. I'm kicking myself for buying only a single instead of a sixer. I could drink this all day, all summer and fall -- this would, in fact, be perfect on a crisp, warm autumn day. I see this one working perfectly with any number of foods, from smoked (or unsmoked) craft cheeses, to seafood, to Mexican dishes, to fish, omelettes....I had mine with a yesterday-picked fresh mountain green apple, and it was divine."
"Pours a nice clear amber golden with a decent white head. Aroma is richly hoppy and just slightly fruity. Flavor is seriously hoppy but not too bitter and has both malty and fruity hints. Texture is fizzy and leaves a nice hoppy finish that is only slightly bitter."
"D: Very drinkable, not sure why this is fall seasonal as I feel that this is an awesome summer sipper. Quality new brew from New Belgium."
"Poured into a pint glass, this presents a very light golden beer with a small white head. The aroma is hugely hoppy though. I could smell it across the table after I poured it, very citrus, grassy hops. Well-balanced flavor, not nearly as bitter as I expected. Plenty of citrus hop flavor, but bitterness is quite moderate. There's not much else here--malt is kept to a minimum with just a tad of graininess, though the rye adds a very subtle spicy, peppery edge (I noticed it but couldn't place the taste until I read the label. Quite drinkable offering from NB."
"Appearance is very light and highly carbonated; true to it's Golden Ale naming. The nose is sweet with a clear presence of Belgian yeast and just a hint of floral hops. Taste is semi-sweet and moderately hoppy. Slightly dry finish with a fairly complex mouthfeel, a little suprisingly considering the appearance. Highly drinkable and very unique for a fall seasonal!"
"Overall I really enjoyed this brew. It does seem to be more of a spring/summer type beer rather than a fall seasonal, but no matter what time of year it's a pretty decent offering from the folks at New Belgium."
"Overall Impression - A fairly solid beer. Just enough hop aroma and flavor to please the palate, but very underwhelming. This would be very refreshing on a hot Summer day. Worth a try, but I probably won't but again."
"A lemon hop burst comes in first followed by a bite of floral hops. There is a taste of pine and maybe even a bit of the booze comes through. Not nearly as balanced as I hoped, it also feels a little thin. The hops flavor could use a sweeter balance throughout. The texture of this reminds me of a BMC. Overall, eh."
"A hoppy Belgian blonde ale is the best name for this one I think. Instead of having pale malt characteristics, this has the fruity Belgian blonde ale characteristics. Notes of ripe peaches are prevalent, as is a smoother, rounder mouthfeel as compared to West Coast Pale Ales. The hop character is present on the nose, as well as the palette, but is much less assertive. It tends to be a backdrop instead of the main event here. An easy drinking ale that has a beautiful rich, sweet, and smooth character, while still being refreshing."
"Still don't know what to make of this beer other than I like it... definitely in my mind this a blending of at least a few different styles.. that said, I would have bought this many times to have something interesting and very drinkable in the Boise heat... the fact that it's out now in very late summer will probably limit my drinking, but as long as it's on the shelf, I'll almost certainly make sure to have some in the fridge... good beer for sure."
"The mouth is crisp and clean. Plenty of carbonation on this one. The taste is interesting. Pretty citrusy and hoppy. This is like a tamed down IPA. This is not bad. It's not your typical ""October"" beer, but it's good. Refreshing and tasty."
"Nice looking pour with a pale golden color, and a lively fizzy body fueling a two finger thick head. The smell was floral hoppy, with some tropical fruit showing through as well. The taste was fruity and hoppy with watermelon and apricot apparent. The body felt a bit thin and finished fizzy and metallic. Nice to drink, but not really memorable."
"This beer had plenty going on for a self-described Golden Ale, with some APA-like characteristics. The most enjoyable example of this style I have had in awhile. Not sure a different name isn't in order, as this is more of a summer beer in my opinion. But it definitely exceeded my expectations."
"Drinkability? It's easy enough to put this bottle away. A tasty brew that may be a little too aggressive for the style but it works alright for me."
"Edit: The more I have this beer the more impressed I am by the appearance and hop aroma/taste. It is pretty tasty beer when you need some hops that aren't too over the top."
"Poured from the bottle a nice, hazy orange color. With ""golden ale"" on the label, I wasn't expecting bold flavors, but the smell is pretty dominantly of floral hops. The blend of hops, which produces a solid grapefruit note, is even more upfront in the taste. Medium in body, with a crisp finish, I found Hoptober pretty light and refreshing. Not what I expected from a beer labeled as a golden ale or from an autumn release, but I enjoyed it."
