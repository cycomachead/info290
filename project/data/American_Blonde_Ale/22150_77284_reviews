review_text
"Considering this a brett-ed saison brewed with corn and rice. Pours a cloudy straw color, billowing soapy whit head, settles slowly to a half inch; sheet of thick lace down the glass. Smell: floral, hay, lemony and spicy, moderate amount of barnyard bouquet, hint of dough I'm the back. Taste: lemon, pineapple note, grainy...breakfast cereal, sugar cookie note, into a dry finish highlighting a big spicy and somewhat rindy hopping. This drinks light and refreshing, but the carbonation is really dialed in well to provide heft and lasting power at lower grav. Really well done...the brett adds a lot to all aspects of the beer vs Classique."

"O: Sort of an odd beer between the brett and the Saaz, but ultimately quite enjoyable and preferable to ""clean"" blonde ales."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours moderately hazy golden straw color with a 2 finger dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of tart lemon zest, pear, apple, cracker, bread, hay, straw, grass, herbal, clove, black pepper, musty funk, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lightly tart lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, clove, black pepper, hay, straw, grass, herbal, musty funk, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Light earthy tartness and moderate yeast/hop spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lightly tart lemon zest, pear, apple, cracker, bread, clove, black pepper, hay, straw, grass, herbal, musty funk, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a great crisp malt/yeast/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a very nice saison style. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"this is the best thing I've had from stillwater in ages, its just fantastic beer, perfect for summer, and a nice alternative to a berliner weisse, but does many of the same things. made with corn and rice, clever grain bill to go with the wheat in here. hazy and blonde, extremely creamy, and leaving gorgeous ring lacing as i sip it down, and the head never settles at all, staying a few inches high and super airy in the glass. a nose of subtle brett, a couple of strains were used in this, along with a saison yeast strain that i taste a lot more than i smell. the taste is awesome, appreciable grain character to this, starchy just a little from the rice i assume, and really full bodied. the corn may contribute to some mid palate sweetness, but trio of yeasts clean up any and all residual sugar in the very dry finish. this is the more elegant and refined side of brett fermentation, not heavy on the funk at all, just a little more tart and interesting than a normal farmhouse strain, but it brings the best out of the unique grain bill. tasty and original beer here, low in alcohol and very effervescent, which makes it a bottle i wish i have five or six of to drink in a session instead of just sharing one. stillwater needs to keep going in this direction, its fabulous beer. love the full feel to it, the drinkability, and the yeast complexion. top tier offering here at a fair price."

"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, crystal clear, honey-yellow coloring with a ton of carbonation throughout and a tall, foamy, frothy, bright white head. Aromas of toasted grains, floral highlights, buttered bread, cut grass, and subtle hints of honey and cracker. Flavors are grassy up front, with hints of evergreen and honey, on a cracker backbone. Effervesced and light body, with a roasted and toasted character towards the end of the palate. The aftertaste is more of the toasty and grainy characteristics, with hints of sweetness. The finish is frothy and effervesced, with a lingering grassy and tangy sweet character. Different take on the style, and definitely refreshing on a hot day."

"Slightly funky but light bodied and much easier to drink than anticipated.  Dry and earthy with subtle wood and sulfur along with funky bugs and light fruit notes. Decent dry brett presence with a touch of sulfuric funk followed by grainy adjuncts as well as some apple and pear sweetness.  "

"o - decent beer but a little boring and overly carbonated."
""
""
""
""
"Overall the brew feels incredibly unbalanced and too out of kilter on the funky sense. This isn't for me, this feels like it went for broke and burned everything in it's path to get there."
""
"O: This beer feels true to the claim of being styled in prohibition times given its cloudy unfiltered, almost milky appearance. Its sour wild taste and smell is raw and upfront. Worth given it a try should you find it in your area."

"Pours a cloudy amber color. 2/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and great lacing. Smells of grapes, hops, yeast, hint of floral, hint of grass, and a hint of sweet malt. Fits the style of an American Blonde Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and thick, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight alcohol, grapes, slight grass, hint of yeast, slight floral, and a hint of sweet malt. Overall, good appearance, decent aroma, feel, and blend."
"This one grew on me, despite the cow shit."
"Pours the lightest hazy blonde hue I've ever seen borderlining urine colour with a fluffy three finger head and clingy lacing everywhere,the smell is sweaty socks,funk,citrus and lemon sherbet,the mouthfeel is lightbodied and well carbonated with tastes of lemon sherbet,mandarins,the slightest touch of funk and i mean slight just enough to make itself known and finished with a thirst quenching herbal fruity dryness and overall not bad and nice for when you want a tasty thirst quenching beer without too much going on it cheers."

"A tasty enough pale wild ale, I don't quite grok the insistence on placing this in the Blonde Ale classification, even if said category, as a whole, is loosey-goosey at best. So a few niggling points off for that. And did pre-WWII beers in America really rely on wild yeast and bacteria for their fermentation? Maybe I've got some further reading up to do."
"Overall: Intriguing and probably a bit better fresh, this is still a nice example of what Brett can do to the American Blonde style to make it interesting and appealing"
""
"Overall a great looking beer that may have been just a touch to funky for me. Would definitely like to try again and reassess the flavor profile."
"I like this beer. It is incredibly easy drinking and has some wonderful sour characteristics. It isn't exactly what I would reach for if I was in the mood for an adjunct lager (which is rare), but it is what I would grab if I wanted a fancier lawnmower beer. It is recommended."
"O: This would make for a really easy to drink beer for someone that is just getting into sour beers because the brett is not overdone. I really liked how the brewer used a little sourness to make a beer brewed with adjunct malts that doesn't taste bland. It's extremely drinkable given its low alcohol content."

"I was really excited to pop this beer open, because I honestly had no idea what to expect from it. Stillwater Premium pours out a pale golden yellow color with a large white head. The aroma, at first, smells like an adjunct lager with maybe a touch more bright citrus. As either the beer warms or I get closer into the glass, more subtle aromas come out. The musty aspects from the Brett start to take over, as well as a bit of spicy/earthy hops. The taste is, again, really interesting. It has the clean, crisp, and citrusy lager taste there, but it's subverted by a heavy amount of very musty funkiness that cuts right through the lager base like a knife. The Brett funkiness has a fun time interacting with the citrus and hops in the beer. I don't know how to really describe the feeling of the funk hitting in this beer - it almost feels like the mouthfeel gets thicker when the funk comes rolling through, even though it obviously doesn't. It's probably due to a strong dryness from the Brett that fights against the crisp, bright, and light lager base. Premium might not be a beer that completely succeeds on all levels, but it's interesting enough that I can't help but recommend it."

"O: Took a chance on this weird beer and was absolutely rewarded. I'm really starting to get hooked on what Stillwater is doing, looking forward to the next time I come across them. 4.5"
"D: a pretty unique brew. highly quaffable as the Brett dries things out. I would enjoy this in a smaller serving vessel as it would make for some solid session beer."
"Overall, disappointing. It just tastes like the brett was added to a tasteless beer. Meh."
"Half finger head wit excellent lacing in a cloudy banana yellow body. Aroma of clove, Belgian yeast, garbage and lemon. Flavor has a lot of corriander and clove with Belgian yeast funk and light lemon custard sweetness. Moderate carbonation and light to medium body. Lots of Belgian yeast and funk character. Drinkable but comes across very simpe. Not overly dry."
"O: though this is my first one by Stillwater, I would say I'm mostly pleased, but would fault myself for having this one this time of year because I think this one would probably show its aspects better in the warmer months of the year. I'll be looking for it next summer. Though, I will say its nice to see this in Maine."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice crisp finish with good Brett character throughout. Well balanced."
"D - Really interesting. The funky notes play perfectly with the earthy European hops and make for an odd but endearing little beer."
"Overall (4.0): To be honest, I have mixed feelings about this beer. I get what Brian’s going for, and I think that he probably did an excellent job in creating that beer, but it’s not quite what I was hoping for and is definitely not for everybody. Admittedly, I’m a bit picky when it comes to brett funk: I like the musty, dank, and fruity characters, but get a little sensitive when the spicy, phenolic side of brett becomes more prominent. In this beer, the latter is definitely the case. But, it looks, smells, and feels fantastic, overall—it's just the prominence and balance of different brett notes that I'm somewhat at odds with. My understanding is that Brian wanted to create a very clean, very drinkable brett beer, and using brett in primary with the malt base he did, he did exactly that."

"This is a light bodied brew with a modest to effervescent level of carbonation that is lightly prickly on the tongue. It is interestingly enjoyable at times but it does have some distractions that make the brew fall apart a bit as the experience continues. The blend of saison character and tropical hints was brilliant, the sulfur and oily lemon - not so much."

"Bottle signed by the brewer! Batch #1! Served from bottle into a Duck-Rabbit nonic. Poured a slightly hazy pale golden yellow with three finger pure white fluffy head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, banana, fruit, spices, earthy funk, and horseblanket. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, spices, earth, and massive funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The brett going on in this one definitely took a front row seat in both the aroma and especially the flavor. The brett plays a really nice role in this style as it can stand out and dominate the brew. The aroma is quite nice on it as well. An absolute must try if you have not done so already. You won’t regret it at all."
"I suppose for the style the appearance does not get much better. Its yellow, but it has nice lacing and fair head retention. The aroma is a lot of lemon lime soda, phenols, band - aid, earth and funk. It is just on the right side of off putting honestly. Strong herbal, earthy, and bitter hop flavors. A well hopped beer for sure. The lemon lime soda appears again here as does the band - aid and phenol but it is more subdued and mostly in the finish. Wonderfully dry and crisp. I would love this on a hot summer day. A neat interpretation of a bastard style in the beer world."
"The farm smell is right there wafting through and after the pour. Really funky. Above average mouthfeel. Nothing exceptional taste wise, a little pepper, drinking of hay, but drinkable. Some rice as in saki, as in roast and toast rice. Worth a try for something different."
"Easy to get through a bottle, but not worth the price. Love Stillwater, sort of like this beer."
"O - This is a pretty tastier beer. It reminded me of a lighter version of Rayon Vert."
""
"The brett hits you like a ton of bricks. What a unique base for such a heavy brett character. If you like brett, seek out this beer. Nicely done."
"pour is a very light pale yellow, light haze, with a fair amount of white fluffy head. Nose has a great Brett presence, dusty and lightly leathery, hints of peppery spice with a lemony fruity back end. The taste is great, strong Brett presence again, dusty, very fruity array of tropical fruits. Mango's and apricots, very expressive and tight. Soft body, a touch syrupy, decent carbonation. Extremely refreshing and so bright especially for the abv."
""
"O- This beer really has a beautiful brett character that is full in the aroma with some nice bright flavors supporting it in the taste. There is a touch of tartness that grows and more depth comes with each glass."

"Not a bad beer for a style I'm not a huge fan of. Poured a light, golden yellow, pale and slightly hazy, with a small cap of white bubbles for a head; minimal retention and lacing. Aromas of pale malts, musty grass, and a distinctive Belgian yeast quality that puts this on the border of a saison (typical Stillwater fare). More of the same in the taste, bready pale malts, yeast, grass, light herbal hops. Light-medium body and quite good for the style."
"Not much a fan of blonde (ales), but the Brett funks this thing up and makes it a beast."
""
""
"Another excellent beer in the long line of Belgian-style brews from Stillwater. This is probably the lightest and most drinkable I've had from them even if it's not quite a complex and ""meaty"" as some of the other."
"One of the easiest most flavorful drinking bretted beers I have had to date. You can have a few of these and really enjoy each one. Nice."
""
"	The flavoring has a mild tartness to it and a light spice with a bitterness midpoint. At first I thought of a rye spiciness, with its concomitant fruit-like notes. Turns out there’s a double addition of Brett, which would explain the interesting and hard-to-place flavors and aromas, as well as the exceptionally dry finish. (And what I can only describe as a light “baking soda” hint on the flavor.) Crisp, light, delicious."
""
"I’ll have another."
"Overall this beer argued too much with my sensibilities. The result? I could not appreciate it."

"Crisp and tasy. I could drink this beer all day (and at 4.5% ABV probably could)."

"M - light body with good carbonation. Light flavors and good use of adjuncts and Brett. Quick fading aftertaste and easy to drink. Overall an interesting and fun beer to drink"
"Notes: Sure, I typically like what this brewer is doing and can´t help but to reach out for any new offering. But this one hit me at the right moment, on the right spot… Fantastic, so much flavor with the low above, and that range… Really nice."
"Overall a very good brew. Who knew Brett, saison yeast and hops could make corn and rice taste good."
"Growler from GBX poured into a weizen glass. Nice amber pour with a ton of pillow white head. Great spoting and lacing throughout. Smell is of zesty fruits, complex notes of citrus and some wood. Taste is a great mix of hops, malts and fruits. Big bold taste with a zesty kick on the end that leave me wanting more. Feel is lively with awesome carbonation and some dry champagne on the tongue. Very interesting and a bonus. Overall- A very quality brew from Stillwater. My first experience with this outfit and I'm impressed. A very enjoyable Blonde that had so much going on with the taste and smell. Sort of Farmhouse, sort of Saison, sort of Good! Will hit another of these-"
"Man this beer is tip top - well beyond average - only wish I was a baller so I could drink it all the time - at $15. a 750 milly i'd go broke otherwise!"
""
"M: The late-sip pairing of sweet malts, Belgian spices, and Brettanomyces is a game changer, sweet and funky and lively. Not quite a full-on saison, although it is this close {indicates mere millimeters with thumb and pointer finger}. The ale feels heavy though, perhaps my only significant complaint."
""

"Poured into a Black Raven imperial pint. Pours a slightly cloudy pale yellow amber. Healthy three finger head and active carbonation leaving chunks of foam on the side of the glass as it slowly dissipated. Looked great! Aromatic aroma of Belgian yeast and spicing, light fruit and citrus, slightly sour and funky. Flavor dominated by citrus, mostly lemon, and brett funk. Light grain and sweet malt. Astringently bitter finish, but supported by the fruit from the citrus. I'm not a big fan of brett, but I have to admit that the low level in this ale along with the refreshing lemon flavor was quite nice. Light to medium bodied. Not my style, but I enjoyed the whole bottle. Good job, Stillwater."
"Overall: There is a ton of flavor in this beer given the abv. I thought it was interesting and would have more."
"mouthfeel is kind of like a champagne beer, bubbly, but dry, dusty and tart."
"o - Overall a pretty nice beer from saison. Taste had a little too much pepper for me, but the nose was very nice. Would try it again."
"Beer is light in body and effervescent. A little dry finish, pretty bretty, Brett c or b character. Interesting. A pretty good beer I'd have it again."
"The beer appears a hazy, straw yellow hue with a lasting white head. The aroma is enticing, offering a bouquet of floral notes, citrus, earth, yeast, grass. The flavor has all of the aforementioned characteristics, as well as a pleasant spice character. The feel is smooth on the palate, finishing dry with a crisp hop character. Light bodied, easy to drink, complex, delicious. I would happily have this again. Recommended."
"O- This is a good beer that is easy to enjoy. Brett is not overpowering. I feel that it is Pilsner with Brett and farmhouse yeast, which seems to work well in my opinion."
""
""
"Pours a slightly-hazy straw color with a really nice white head and some good lacing on the way down. The nose brings a slight bit of grain along with some faint floral hops. Light earthy notes as well. The flavor has a nice grainy base along with good hop and yeast notes. The Brett shines through in the finish, which is quite dry. Light, crisp body. Really nice."
"woah... definitely a mind-f@#k here. i think that when taken in context, this is one very very well done beer. one foot in outer space, one foot in hipster dive bar. pours a clear gold with a white head that holds and leaves lots of lace. nose is mainly grain, corn and earthy hops. touch of fruit (lemon?), spice(lemon pepper?) and bread thrown in for good measure. taste is crisp, dry, earthy, corny and euro-hoppy. the hops seem very ""real pilsner"" like. just a tiny touch of bitter and lots of earthy goodness. extremely clean finish with no aftertastes. brett hasn't quite shown itself yet, so i am curious to see where this goes. created as deconstructed hipster schwill, i find it to really hit the mark. light, with flavors of adjunct all over, but somehow coming off elegant and ""premium"" for sure. not what i expected, but not a let down by any means. simple, clean, well done."
"This beer poured out as a lightly hazy looking yellow color. The head was white and a little on the fizzy side. The smell of the beer was made of mostly corn aromas and bready yeast. Smells very much like a very generic ale. The taste is sweet with some corn and grainy flavors. The mouthfeel was well carbonated with a decent body to it. Overall this beer was pretty good, I understand the style that was being attempted here and I think it's pretty good. I found this beer to be pretty refreshing actually."

"O: Certainly not your typical blonde ale, but well worth trying."
