"O:  Enjoyable brew.  Not a style that I normally frequent, but a nice departure."

"At the time of writing this, I've never had another blonde ale yet, but the description on this site of blonde ales is pretty spot-on with this beer. In terms of looks, it reminds me of a pale wheat ale and looks quite nice, but in terms of taste, I found it forgettable."

"If I think of this as a lager, it's rather nice."

"I was concerned that the beer was two months past its ""Best By"" date and so I employed a very gentle pour which resulted in just a skim of wisps in lieu of head. No problem as I then used the servers' trick and agitated it into producing a finger of foamy, eggshell-white head with good retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow (SRM = 4 -5) with NE-quality clarity and my old friends, Mammon, Croesus and Midas returned for a taste. I leaned in for a sniff and was rewarded with an odor like honey-lemon tea! No joke, the Saaz hops interacted really well with the Belgian malt to create a very mellow smell. I have been fighting a bad head cold of late and this seememed like just what the doctor ordered. My first draught was very tea-like, slightly thin on the tongue in terms of mouthfeel, but very much like drinking honey-lemon tea. I would have probably identified it as a Czech Pils or another type of lager, had they not identified it on the label as an ale. Finish was semi-dry and mellow to the point that I was driven to have a bit of a lie-down. Oh my."

"Overall: Nothing extraordinary happening in this brew but it certainly would make a perfect companion on a warm and sunny afternoon."

"Pours bright sunny gold, see through, light foam ring. Grain, hay, earthy nose. Cereal grains. Taste is light, touch of sweetness, with a mild bitter close. Hint of citrus. Easy going, sweet, tasty. Honest beer, great midwest farm beer."
""
""
""

"Overall just a ""Middle Of The Road Ale."" Nothing particularly memorable about it."

"Pours amber touched golden with a strong grain presence on the nose. Flavor brings a lot of the same. One dimensional, but consistent. Feel is okay. This is pretty basic. No real flair. But at least it brings a more hearty character than most of the others in its style."

"O-A boring, but easy drinking, beer. Try it and then forget it."
""

"Overall: Pretty much a gluten-free Kolsch, which would be a really good thing if the mouthfeel was better."

"O: Decent gluten-free offering, definitely beer-like and not cider-like, which is my main complaint with most GF 'beers'."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Fine grained, well carbonated, thick enough, nice."
""
""
"Overall it's not a bland Blonde ale but it's really nothing to buy again. Another great beer from Two Brothers."
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and is a good representation of the style. It would probably make for a good summer beer or a pairing with a meal."

"O: A decent ale for this style. I would drink more than one in a sitting. I highly recommend this to folks who are used to drinking nothing but MGD/BUD. This beer will not blow you away. I think a great positive for this beer is it being gluten free, this makes it a great option for those allergic to gluten."
""
"O: A pretty good blonde ale. I think the hops could have been utilized a bit better in the flavor profile, which could have been a bit stronger in general, but still tasty and refreshing."
""
""
""
"Didn't know quite what to expect from this beer, but being a fan of Two Brothers, I figured it was worth investigating. I have to say I was pretty disappointed. Pours a transparent gold color with a meager head that is soon gone. Smell is faint, but what's there is not all that appealing. Flavor leans toward the hoppy end of the spectrum with a wheat aftertaste (reminiscent of Bud Light Golden Wheat, to be honest). Overall, a pretty thin beer with little working for it in any regard. Two Brothers have far better brews than this."
""
""
""
""
"pours from the bottle into a pint glass a clear bright gold color. a fingers worth of bright white head quickly settles to a thin cap leaving little lacing behind. smells are faint, but i can detect some grain, bready malts, spice from hops and light sweet fruits. the taste is bigger than the nose. all of the above blend together very well to create an easy drinking light tasting beer. mouthfeel is kinda thin but average for the style. overall this would probably be better for a long hot summer day, but it hit the spot on a cold winters night with dinnner just as well. plain and simple this is a nice beer."
""
""
""
"Smooth feel, light to medium body. Floral, husky grains, light bready sweetness, pepper and yeastiness, with a dry clean finish. Simple and easy drinking, though it's often overlooked (took me years to write a review of it). Not the first 2 Bros. beer i'll usually reach for, but wouldn't turn it down either."

"Trying the Prairie Path Ale from Two Brothers out of Warrenville, IL. The appearance is clear golden color with very thin white (almost non-exisitent) head that appears to be trying to lace. The smell has very subtle citrus (lemonny) notes....not much else. The taste is a little bitter due to the citrus twang...not much grain or malt....I am guessing rye is used to give the beer a dryness and ability to clear the pallet except for the lemon sourness that hangs on. Mouthfeel is ok, I think the bitterness/tartness from the lingering pallet grasp of the citrus make this beer a bit dodgy. Overall it is ok....whoever added this beer to the BA has classified it wrong...this is a Golden Ale....not a Belgium Pale Ale."
"This is, overall, a very enjoyable, drinkable take on the Belgian Pale Ale style. The aroma and taste are to be recommended, though neither are particularly strong. Another Two Brothers beer I will keep my eye out for."
"Taste is toasty, with a wee bit of citrus and hops. A pleasant and drinkable golden ale here, without much flash or over-the-top attitude. Not outstanding, but solid."
"12zo bottle. Very clear and copper color. Very light carbonation and head thins out rapidly. Suttle aroma of citric hops and light lemon. Taste lingers of only a moment and then discipates. Very light and crsip beer for engoying any time. One of the most suttle golden ales and a very good beer."
"While this is very good and I would recommend trying it, I was puzzeled a bit as to why it is listed as a Belgian pale ale as there wasn't much Belgian yeast flavor to it at all."
"SOLID, BUT NO NEED TO SEEK OUT!"
"Overall a very solid beer that I would have no issues with trying out again anyday. About as solid as they come!"
"Figured I needed a beer whilst moseying down memory lane, and this one was the first to jump outta the fridge. It pours a clear golden straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises lemon zest, light black pepper, a pinch of what seems like nutmeg, and a decidedly light bit o' caramel. The taste follows pretty closely, though the pepper comes through a bit more, and some lemongrass joins the party as well. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a pretty nice brew, nothing overtly special, but I could easily see downing several of these if given the opportunity."
"O: Decent if not memorable. Average beer."
"Another top notch beer from Two Brothers as far as I am concerned. Very enjoyable and highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Although not the time of year for it now, I could see myself having a few of these on a hot summer day out at a BBQ. There is just a little more going on here than 312, the light ale I normally find at such gatherings. Delicate, but not one of the more enjoyable beers I have had from Two Brothers."
"This is my 2nd favorite Beligian Pale Ale - only Troubadour is better for me, and this is much less expensive and locally brewed."
"Drinkability: Nice look, smell, and taste. A refreshing beer, especially with fish."
"I like the clarity of Prairie Path. It's bouquet of grassy, herbal & floral tones never come across as muddled or musty. Though not my usual choice, but I wouldn't mind having this one again."
"Avoid this."
"D: Good ale, not anything that begs back for more. Very typical, but well done."
"Though the taste isn't all that impressive, it finishes very clean and coupled with its dry mouthfeel, high carbonation, and moderate weight--its fairly drinkable as a summer afternoon beer."
"D: I could take down a 6-pack, no problem. I would continue to purchase this if there is nothing new I haven't tried at my local beer store."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable brew. Perhaps too drinkable (or I was really thirsty. Not sure which.) This beer was gone before I knew it. Definitely a thirst quencher, more than a sipping beer. Wouldn't seek out again, but wouldn't turn one down."
"medium body with a light carbination. Could drink these as long as you'd care to."
"D: this beer is drinkable but boring, reminds me more of a pale lager than a Belgian pale. Overall it is palatable, just very lacking in character"
"all in all quite drinkable"
"Appearance and smell suggested that this might be thin and light but that just set up the taste which was full with a lot of honey and the mouthfeel which was again full but very smooth. All in all a very enjoyable beer and one you could go back to again and again."
"D - This is a good tasting beer although it doesn't seem like a ""Belgian Pale Ale"". Still it would make a solid session brew."
"Not my favorite offering from Two Brothers, nor my favorite style of beer, but worthy of a try yourself."
"This is my first but certainly not my last Two Brothers offering. This first four of the six pack poured a head that topped a Samuel Smith Pint Glass, so I took it easy on this one and the head was minimal, but still nice looking for the style. Kinda an average beer here on BA, but I really dig this beer. Paired with a frozen pizza just out of the oven and it pairs well. Smell is on par for the style, but taste and mouthfeel are above average and drinkability -- well, I could drink several of these in one sitting. Nice job, Two Brothers."
"i am really not sure to what degree this is ""belgian"" (little corresponding aroma--just pils malts and some floral hop). the brewery website cites the usage of belgian malts, but i'm not sure belgian malts do a belgian beer make. the label says ""golden ale"" and i reckon it's actually a pretty fair example of that style. light, but present (and nice enough), malt character, good hop contributions. we'll call it a golden ale"
"A pleasant surprise."
"A 12 ounce bottle picked up at the Beer Stop for around $1.75. Poured into a nonic pint glass. The ale appears a clear golden yellow color with about an inch of foamy bone white head. Nose and flavor are of spicy yeast, pepper, toasted bread, lemon, apricot, sweet malt. A notch better than medium in both body and carbonation. Tasty and accessible."
"d: This was okay, but nothing to memorable. I wouldn't have called this a Belgian anything if I had tasted it blind."
"Reviewed on 07/31/2009. On tap at Blind Tiger. This beer pours a clear orange with a small head. The aroma is of fruit and bready yeast. The flavor is of bread, yeast, sweet fruits. It is very pleasant drinking and definitely underrated on this site."
"Overall a drinkable beer."
"Medium-light-bodied mouthfeel with low carbonation. Fairly easy to drink, but this BPA needs some work."
"D: I liked this beer overall. The flavor is fairly complex and the low ABV makes it easy to imbibe."
"D- easy enough to drink a couple of and something that BMC fans could probably appreciate. when i first had this beer (before BA), i remember liking it a lot more."
"mouthfeel is good for the style,and it's easy to drink.however,it's just not that impressive in my opinion.maybe i got a bad bottle,but kinda middle of the road.two brothers has done much better."
" ~ Overall I think this is a quality brew. My lovely wife was kind enough to bring this back to me during one of her recent trips down to the Chicago area. I'm always open to gifts I can drink. I suggest this beer be on your hit list."
"D - Fantastic balance and good all around, this beer is an easy drinker and something I'd take part in any time I could. Good summer beer or sessioner."
""
"Drinkability- Good session beer, crisp and refreshing."
"A noble attempt at the Belgian pale ale style by Two Brothers. It's a beer that goes down nicely, yet rewards savoring as well. Probably wont set the world afire, but a good choice if you're in Illinois."
"Pours a hazy golden, yellow color. One and one half inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, lemon aroma, some yeast cleanliness, and some wheat. Fits the style of a Belgian Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth a crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of hops and lemon up front, a sweet malt background, and a hint of spice (all spice maybe). A smooth finish overall, and not a bad brew. The lighter palate of this beer makes it a great summer session brew. I must say that I'm rating this brew a bit higher than the average, and I'm not sure as to why there is such a low average rating. Probably the best lemon beer I've ever had!"
"A drier take on the style, I would like this a little more it if it were a little sweeter. I'm going to keep trying Two Brothers, so far no knockouts though..."
"D: Big drinkabilty here. Screw Budlights ""drinkability"". This is it. This is my idea of a damned near perfect session beer. Somethnig I can sit down with, and either relax with, or get a snoot full of. I'm not a hophead, but, there is enough hops in here to make me happy. Enough, at least, for a change of pace from my normal diet of malt-bombs. I'm digging this beer, and really digging this brewery. These guys are cranking out some great beers! Second only to New Glarus, as my favorite brewery...and not by much!"
"There are better golden ales out there. Wasn't impressed with this."
"A decent, light-bodied golden ale with a mellow spicy hop character that seems to come from noble hops like Saaz. Pours clear and blond with a firm head that settles to slight ring of bubbles. No lace. Somewhat like a Kolsch but a touch darker in color and with a more toasted character. Just enough bitterness and crisp, toasted malt character to get this one from getting boring. Very clean and almost lager-like. Get this one fresh and it's a delicious session beer. Not sure this has the esters to be considered a Belgian ale; more of blonde, but that's quite alright."
"I found the ale a bit thick on the tongue, like a flat cola. It wasn't something to savor and ""squeeze"" in the mouth. But the ease of drinking with the clean finish it makes this a beer I would drink again and again."
"Mouthfeel is carbonated and also slightly creamy, and there is a clean finish as I swallow. Overall, a decent beer, and one that I would have again. There was just something weird about this beer that I cannot place right now."
"For this style I'm going for the Orval Trappist Ale."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a slightly hazy, yellow-golden color with a thin cap of creamy looking head. The smell is sweet, slightly fruity, a little grainy and spicy. The taste reveals some of the same sweetness, pretty well bitter but not hoppy. There might be a bit of skunk to this bottle, although it's expo is 10/21/08. The mouthfeel is light in body with a creamy carbonation and a very dry finish. Overall, this beer is decent, probably better than your average BMC beer but nothing spectacular. I would not make a point to seek this one out again."
"D: its a very drinkable brew, but a little weak on the flavor for me."
"Rich golden color poured from the bottle, pencil thin head lasted the entire duration with good lacing. Good strong hop aroma is present here. The mouthfeel was slightly bitter which accented the hoppy aroma. Overall flavor is very good and rather complex. For a golden ale this one is bursting with flavor. Very enjoyable and highly recommended."
"Received as an extra from bgramer (thanks Brendan). Best by 10/21/2008 printed on the bottle. Served in my Delirium Tremens tulip. Poured a translucent orange-gold with a one-inch loose off-white head and copious tiny bubbles in solution. Head quickly subsides into a thin skim of foam and some strands of lacing. Nose is mild and exhibits a light and fruity sweetness; maybe a hint of apricot detectable. Taste consistent with nose with a nice hops/malt balance, as well as a subtle biscuity character at the finish. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied with a full mouth effervescence and a slight bitterness/astringency at the end. Brew went down easy, and has a nice balance, but not really style consistent in my opinion."
"I was hoping for a bit more from this one as I have lived just off of said Prairie Path for many a year. While it is not really a Belgian Pale Ale it is still a good beer. I will definitely grab some for my next midnight session on the path."
"Dark golden color with a fine bubbly head. Fair amount of lacing left behind. Crisp, clean smell. Reminds me of spring day (boy does that sound stupid). Mostly light malts with a faint grassy hop note. Taste is light malt with some cereal like flavors to it. Again some faint grassy hop in the finish. Mouth is a little thin. Overall another quality brew from Two Brothers. I would recomend trying all of their brews that I've sampled so far and this one is no different."
"Pours a medium to dark gold with a medium lived small white head. Smell is nice anc clean grassy hops which are subtle but nice and fresh. Taste is light and clean malt, with crisp grassy and lightly bittering hops. Smooth, flavorful and easy drinking. Medium to thin bodied with moderate carbonation. I enjoyed this one for sure, despite its relative simplicity."
"Nothing special here, certainly not as bold as other American blondes. Glad I didn't pay for it."
"fair carbonation. mid body. good beer. these guys do a pretty good job brewing interesting styles for the midwest. i could drink this again. need to visit the brewery."
"A nice easy drinker, but nothing great."
"D: Very good drinkability. This seems more like a toasty pilsner than a BPA. Quite refreshing."
"Pours golden amber with some good bubbling, spradic lacing and a ring foam. The first whiff, whether cold or warm, is sweet butter. As it warms, the buttery malts simmer down just a tad. Then a few other drier grains come up in the tail end of each end. The taste is equally buttery, but with some hard water taste in the middle with a light bitterness at the finish. The palate is a little toasty, sweet, and dry."
"This beer pours a hazy golden color, two finger white head with some nice lacing throughout the drink. Its nose isn't very strong, but I notice a hint of sweetness behind a faint lemon scent. This beer has a smooth, mild taste, a little spice, a touch of citrus, and mild yeasty flavor. I think the mouthfeel is great, good carbonation, smooth going down. This beer is very drinkable and would pair great with pizza! Awesome for a small brewery outside of Chicago, I plan to try more from Two Brothers."
"pours a light orange color with a smallish head, smell is kinda citrusy, with a light hop presence. taste is first a bit bitter then a more smooth taste. it is not bad, could have a bit more body to it, the mouthfeel is kinda watery, this kinda tastes like a mixture of hefeweizen and a pale ale. its interesting."
"Fairly hard pour made just a wee bee ivory head, but on a clear and crisp golden ale - just full of sparkling carbonation. Head did have some staying power. Aroma is more along a standard pilsner than anything Belgium. Quaff is the same, almost more English bitter than anything else - woody, resinous and dry in the finish. Surprised by the ""average-ness"" of this brew, nothing unique or special with it. Not a bad tasting brew, but not one to come back for again."
"clear pale gold with not much head/lacing. understated nose-some vague fruitiness, sweet malt, and an grassy/vegetal aroma. lightly sweet malts upfront and a light but noticeable bitterness. just over light bodied with appropriate carbonation. maybe a good beginner's or lawnmower craft beer."
"What can I say, it tasted a lot better when sharing it with my dad and thinking of old memories so I will buy this brew again, but purely for sentimental reasons. Not a bad brew, and like I said would be great for an outdoor excursion with a cooler of ice, a grill full of meat, and a hot sun. Would compliment a burger perfectly."
"Carbonation is overdone, a real surprise given the lack of a long-lasting head. However, as I continue to drink the beer my enjoyment never wanes. A flawed but highly drinkable brew. One I would have no trouble ordering in the future."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thin white head that fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale and Munich malt scent along with a light hop aroma. It seems quite malty; very nice. The taste is decent. It has a smokey malt flavor that boasts of pale, Munich, and rauch malts. The Belgian yeast doesn't seem to be present in the taste. It goes down smooth and finishes with a dry Goldings hop flavor. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a medium bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. This is a forgettable beer. The appearance suffers (no head retention). The taste is smokey for some reason and the CO2 is less than desirable. It's one and done for me."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and pretty smooth, and the drinkability is pretty decent, as there's nothing to really make this one hard to put down flavor wise, other than the lack there of."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, just a little bit filling, may not be quite on-target for the style, but still a pretty good beer. I could drink a few of them, but might look for something a little more flavorful after that."
"Pours a golden lemon with a nic epillow head and good lacing. Mainly malt...some hop notes....smells a bit ""lagery"". Smooth creamy malty on the front, hops kick in a mid-palate...metallic and bitter on the finish. Mouthfeel is creamy, but has an unplasant matallic finish. Because of teh metallic finish, drinkability suffers."
"The mouth is soft with a bit slickness. This is a very easy drinker, but its not really tasty enough to session. I like it, but I wont be buying kegs of it again! I'll stick to the occasional six pack from here out."
"D - Very drinkable indeed. What it lacks in strength and complexity, it makes up for in it's muted gentle flavor and aroma. Seems to be more of a pale ale than a belgian though, as it doesn't seem outrageous or assertive enough to be compared to the likes of Duvel and Orval."
"Drink-a-bility is A ok quite a nice refreshing brew. This would be a tremendous pick to keep on hand for those timid BMC drinker that just need to get their feet a little wet to start. Prosit, MK"
"Drinkability - this is decent, and could be sessionable."
"This poured a slightly hazy orange yellow color with no head. The carbonation was light to moderate. The aroma was sweet and malty. The hops greet you in a similar way as a pils would. There is some floral taste to it. Refreshing but almost dry. This is a very flavorful golden brew. There is the slightest hint of euro smell/taste to it. The mouthfeel is dry and slick. Overall this is very refreshing but complex. As the label states ""looks simple but tastes complex"". I suggest drinking this not too cold to bring out the flavors."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" white head over the clear light golden brew. Head fades pretty quickly down an uneven layer of bubbles, although with lots of white lacing. Aroma is minimal, some pale malt and effervescence. Taste is light pale sweetness, countered and overcome by rounded bitterness that dominates the rest, on through the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is soft over the tongue, although the bitter is more dominating thatn I would want, and drinkability is acceptable. Nothing much I would strive to revisit here."
"Orange. Well orchestated aroma of butter toffee, burnt corn, peaches, spicy and grassy hops along with some grainy and cereal like malts. This tastes like a prairie. Dry, grainy, husky malts put forth notes of caramel, medicine and light fruit. The hops shine through the most here. They are herbal, grassy, quite spicy and not a pleasing combo, for me anyway. Not offensive."
"M & D: Mouthfeel and drinkability are ok on this offering from Two Brothers. Very light tasting and easy drinking beer thats refreshing and goes down smoothly. Seems like a very good summer beer as you are sweating on the beach. I would have another one of these if it was offered to me, but not sure if I would go out and buy six pack, unless there wasn't a better alternative."
"Easy drinking & smooth. Not one I would go out of way to get, but I certainly would not pass one up. Overall middle of the road."
"Humble as Prarie Path may be, it would make a fine session beer."
"Notes: Growing up, I lived just a block away from the Prairie Path this ale refers to. Like other reviewers from the area, drinking this brew always brings back fond memories from my childhood. I could get to the Wayne County Store in 20 minutes flat by bike from my house!"
"Mouthfeel is rather light with a bit of creaminess and a good flow of carbonation. Extremely easy to drink this one. My fiance has started drinking this over Miller Lite, which I applaud! I could see having a few on a hot day, but other than that this one leaves me searching for something more."
"Opinion: Well, its not a bad beer. It is too one dimensional for my taste, and is very lacking for an APA. It is definitely more of a Blonde Ale. I probably won't be seeking this out."
"Drinkable but boring. Not what I would expect for the style. Nice session beer but no real flavor."
"This is a very raw beer in that the smell and taste is reminiscent of un-fermented malts. Smells like my mash tun, really. It's not overpowering though. Looks nice in the glass, hazy golden color. Hops - alphas only, not too floral, just bitterness. I've really not been too impressed with Two Brothers', and this is no exception."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Prairie Path Golden Ale is a hodgepodge of a beer that doesn't quite come together to form a unified whole. Having said that, I felt much more kindly toward it by the tenth ounce or so. Although I won't be looking for another bottle anytime soon, I'm not sorry that I gave it a home."
"Clear amber gold with a slight tawny highlight, the color is a little deeper than insipid. That might not sound like much of a compliment but it is a lovely color. The head didnt form that impressively, at the apex the foam was still less than one finger in height and it quickly faded to a soapy cap. This aspect of the beer is not impressive. There was no subsequent lacing, aside from a speckle or two. It is uninspiring to look at. The nose is buttery with a kiss of popcorn. Floral hops at the back, some herbal spiciness. Disinterested malts. The nose doesnt explain anything to me. The label says Golden Ale, BA says APA, RB says A Belgian Ale (WTF does that mean!). Two Brothers Website says, Prairie Path Ale is a Belgian-style golden ale. Prairie Path Ale is a full flavored, slightly bitter, clean and refreshing ale. The Belgian malts along with the Saaz and Goldings hops give this beer great drinkability. Is this suppose to be like Duvel? They cant be serious. To me this beer smells more like an English Pale Ale. Whatever it is I dont find the aroma inviting. The first sip is boring. The second sip is buttered popcorn. The third sip is heavy with the residue of the second sip but some new flavors emerge like weak bitterness and some flowery vibes. Two Brothers thinks this beer is Belgian in nature? You got to be kidding me. First of all it is way to clean, it is also too English, and too damn simplistic for me to care. Where are the Saaz and Goldings hops? They are not offering any bitterness of note and little in the way of flavor. Either my definition of Golden Ale is wrong or this beer is just off. I really dont understand what is going on. Lets say, for the sake of argument, I completely ignore style guidelines and just go by taste. This beer doesnt taste good. I dont care for it. Boring with too significant flavors of popcorn. Blah. Medium-light in body, watery on the tongue, the carbonation is low and this only hurts the situation. This beer is not drinkable or enjoyable or anything Id suggest you try. It will take some serious convincing to get me to try this beer again. I purchased this bottle in Iowa City, IA. Not good."
"Layer of crisp citrus; orange and lime. Chewy grains flash roasted. A great gulper -- I finished that bottle in 30 seconds, or so. Quaf, quaf, it would go great with duck, or goose and roasted roots and tubers, and green beans and almonds."
"The beer is a clear, golden color with a frothy, noteworthy head. Moderate lace. The nose is grassy and fruity, with a substantial citrus character. Light body, and fairly high carbonation. A little acidic trait in the brew as well. Not really a lot of sweetness in this one, but there is a solid, sharp bitter finish. I see this one as a great, refreshing, summer sipping beer."
"Drinkability: For a cookout I'd say 5. It is good for the summer when you want something refreshing. For winter, I'd want a little fuller body - something to keep me warm. I'd buy it again."
"Prairie Path pours a crystal clear golden body beneath an average-sized head of bright white foam. The head retention is quite good, and it leaves some very nice lace at the outset of the glass. The nose delivers a combination of yeast fruitiness, floral and grassy hops, and lightly grainy (and perhaps subtly toasty) malt. The body is medium/light and it's crisp carbonation tingles the palate. The flavor is as might be expected based on the nose, with a bit more graininess to the malt and more floral, herbal and spicy hops than are already suggested. It's anchored by a firm bitterness, and what sweet malt is there at the start fades to a dry finish that lingers with some swirling hop flavors (floral, spicy, grassy). It's an interesting and refreshing beer, but it still remains fairly basic in character overall. Still, it's a nice summer beer to enjoy at the end of a long day as the sun goes down."
"Thanks to jackndan/BIF6!"
"Poured with a malty golden color and nice head. Aroma was of light to medium hop, but the conditions for smelling were not decent. Hops were adequate in the taste, but not overpowering. Hops were balanced but mild. There was minimal malt feel. Had a very waterdowned overall characteristic. Overall, nice bier for a session drink. Just would benifit from more malt or grains."
"It's gold, and a bit hazy. The head is ample, but doesn't last very long. The malts are in the aroma with a slight bready smell. A bit of hops in the aroma too, but nothing special. A solid swigger here....easy to drink, pleasantly mild on the palate, perfect carbonation level. Bready malts make up most of the mild flavor, and hops finish it off, once again...mildly. This beer doesn't quite tickle my fancy, but it's worth a try."
"How does this pour such a huge head? I poured about 2/3 of it in a pint glass, and there is about 2 inches of head. It's a hazy orange-gold color, with lots of visible carbonation. Smell is not very strong, light malt and hops. Not a very interesting taste. The malt is very weak, the hops do go well with the carbonation level, though. Not terribly impressive, not bad, though."
"Poured a slightly hazy golden straw, with no much head to speak of. Aroma was sweet, with cotton-candy and vague fruit. Flavor continued to favor the sweeter side, with some indistinct fruit and sugary-grain. Hopping was barely enough to balance. Not a bad beer, but not a lot to commend this beer, either."
"This beer poured a quickly diminishing small white head with fine sized bubbles.The body was clear and the hue was golden.The nose was on the weak side but I did detect some malt and hops.The flavor was fruity tasting and the mouthfeel was tingly and smooth.There was very little lacing with this beer."
"All and all a pretty simple brew, yet fairly likeable and easy to drink. The beer pours a pale golden with orange hues. The head is minimal. The palate is refreshing and clean with ample balance between hop and malt. Not a bad pounder. I'd be interested to try this on tap on a hot sumer day here in Chicago-perhaps as I wait for the next band at a summer street fest."
"Chill-hazed hay color with a minimal and very white head. Laces don't develop. Peppery hop aroma, some lemon grass and bitter acridness. Light body with a fairly straightforward light brown sugar malt approach and an attenuated but highly crsip hop finish. Slight bite to a small aftertaste, re-inforced by Saaz aromas. Two Brothers beers are all over the map to me, this one is a keeper as a warm weather refresher beyond the sea of Hefes -- not a big beer but excelling in the bright category."
"Pours a cloudy/hazy light golden color with very little head. Not a very strong smell, but what is present is of fruit and flowers. The label says its ""light in color, but not in flavor", I thought, however, that the taste was rather mild. There is a hint of fruit/sweetness and a weak aftertaste. An alright beer, it looks pretty good, but is not very impressive in smell, taste or feel."
"Small head, lovely gold color. Aroma: buttery, spicy, grassy, herbal, very dry. To quote them:""Belgian malts balanced by Saaz and Golding hops produce a unique and savory ale, light in color, but not in flavor."" A far cry from a Belgian, actually. Texture is thin, finish comes and goes. They're very earnest, and have excellent package design, these brothers, but they don't live up to their own hype. A satisfactory lawnmower beer, but not much more."
"Prarie Path: A golden ale, in my view more of an American pale ale rather than a Belgian style beer. The beer pours very clear with minimal head that leaves no lace. Very nicely balanced with very tasty hops mitigated by the malts. A quality beer easy to drink, and tasty."
"Hazy, golden/straw color, with a white head. Leaves a decent amount of lacing down the glass. The aroma is of spicy hops, with a touch of malt aroma. The flavor is spicy, clean, refreshing, and sweet. The sweet flavor is almost honey-like. Overall, a very clean, refreshing, easy drinking brew."
"Pretty unique for a golden ale...clear golden in color...barely any lace...the nose is very soft with only some of the Belgian malt and saaz hops making their presence felt in even a slight way....This drinks as clean as it looks....crisp....I wouldn't say it's bitter, but it's got a pilsener like bite...relatively thin(surprisingly a bit watery...the last thing I expected)..not bad....not outstanding..."
"This deep golden ale throws out a miniscule head that is reduced to only an edging within seconds.  Some nice lacing qualities are noted however.  This is a golden ale that you can actually smell the bitterness.  The belgian malts also make their presence known to the nostrils.  This is an interesting ""golden ale.""  It probably contains the most bitterness I've encountered in such an ale.  I like it though.  The spicy Saaz notes really make an impression.  This beer is almost like a pilsner ""ale style.""  If that makes sense.  Very drinkable.  And tasty in my opinion.  Light to medium body.  Nice effort."
