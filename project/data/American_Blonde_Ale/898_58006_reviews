"says review is optional.  It is not."
"Pours a clear medium gold,with bubbles rising long afterwards, producing slightly more than a finger of frothy, shortlived, off-white head that leaves little lace. Aroma is very thin, a little cracker & pale malts, faintly fruity, a little citrus & faint grass. The wheat is detectable as an afterthought. Taste is thin biscuit & bready malts, some light toast & fruit, yeast, some wheat in the background providing a faint hint of banana in the lemon & bitter finish which intensifies in the bitter, mineral, chemical aftertaste. Mouthfeel is on the thin side but not quiet watery, moderate-high carbonation, crisp, prickly & dry. Overall a little disappointing with low drinkability for a Blonde Ale, a brew style with the reputation of being thirst quenching & easy to drink."

"This beer is crisp and light-bodied, refreshing with a bit of bite but still a good smoothness coming through on the tongue. It's semi-sweet, overall, with a sweetness lingering in the finish that's clean nonetheless."
""
""
""
"Pours bright golden light bottom to top. Some white foam settles out. Citrus malt nose, sunny. Taste is a light sweet malt, backed by a lemony tart. Smooth and flavorful, modest carbonation. Bright and sunny. Good beer to change seasons."

"Overall: It is no wonder why blonde ales are so hard to make. It is truly an exact science to get rid of (or at least hide) all of the off flavors. The only way to make this beer better would be to hop (and/or lager?) the hell out of it."

"O- not bad but missing some of malty robustness that comes with gold/blonde ales."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a translucent straw with a tiny white head. Smells of grain and slight fruit, kind of inviting. Tastes of grain and very slight fruit. Beer is light bodied and goes down smooth, very drinkable. Overall, a slightly above average beer."

"Overall a really easy going summer ale that has just enough flavor to keep it interesting. Worth picking up as a single or even a six pack."

"Overall - 3.5. A good average beer but with no qualities that really stand out. I am a very big fan of all of Heavy Seas brews that I have had, so this was actually somewhat of a disappointment of their line to me."
""
"I got as part of a botmc, pours a fizzy yellow with a moderate white head. The aroma is bready, musty. The hops are bready, grassy, it has a lingering finish. The body is medium, light, very quaffable. Not a whole lot going on, would be good on a hot day or maybe as a transition beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured this very average beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a nice golden color but poured a weak head that was gone very fast. The beer has a yeasty bready smell and the taste was just plain beer. Not good enough for another try. I will not buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nothing fancy here at all, just an easy drinking sessioner. Goes down without any problems. Might purchase again if I need a no frills/pool/shoot the shit kind of brew. Would go good with a pizza, or some ball park dogs. Definitely a good intro for BMC drinkers."

"This beer doesn't necessarily have the best flavor nor does it have depth but it is light and sessionable. There's nothing bad about this beer, but there isn't anything that stands out either. I won't buy it again, but I wouldn't turn it down if it was offered to me."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – OK, but nothing special here."
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is crisp and easy drinking but really a mild brew even for the style. I would be hard pressed to find any real reason to return to this brew."
""
"Overall: Drinkable like so many beers from this brewery however just not that imaginative and obviously made for the masses."

"O: Decent golden ale – not my favorite beer from Clipper city – but it went down smooth and was easily drinkable."
""
""
"Decent. A nice little session that would taste good on a 95 degree day."
""
"O: Overall I consider it a so-so beer. The flavor is pretty good, but the smell and appearance leave much to be desired. There's nothing that makes me want to buy another one of these."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-It's drinkable, but I'd like a little more flavor from an American Ale."
""
""
"I have mixed feelings about the beer. Boring flavors but well executed with a spectacular boosted body for such a crisp light beer. There we go."

"Super fresh sampler pack these babies are best by 3/2012...this one pours a brilliant bright clear golden hue with a full thicket of egg shell white head. Frothing head dwindles down leaving layers of intricate lacing. Layers of cereal grains, light fruit notes, and floral hops come across my nares a very pleasant herbal grassiness as well. A perfect clean drinking gold ale really, nothing else to add other than damn it's refreshing and it's good cold and doesn't hurt to let it warm up. This is like the most solid homebrew gone pro brewer beer ever, simple flavorful and nails the style guidelines. A true session ale at 4.5% abv packs a nice amount of flavor into a poundable format, I've never seen this stuff outside of the sampler packs. Lighter bodied ale with ample sturdy carbonation really packs in the flavor and definitely pulls off an enjoyable beer in a style that most beer geeks don't give much attention to."

"Out of a bottle this beer was a golden color (surprise!) with one finger of head. The retention was not very good and the lacing sparse subsequently. The aroma was of light citrus, sweet breads, dry grains and a hint of green apples. The flavors were similar being mostly a compilation of citrus zest, dry grains and some sweetness similar to both caramelized sugars and sweet breads. Sort of like an amber ale, yet it claimed to be an American Blonde? The mouthfeel was a little thin, the body medium/light and the carbonation fine. An ok beer, but it seemed unsure of what it was trying to be."

"I drink as much Heavy Seas on my weekends as I can muster. My buddy Fassio left me a Gold Ale in exchange for one of my Guinness Black Lagers and I have to say, I really enjoy this brew. It looks great in a glass and has a nice mouth feel. Excellent drinkability but a little heavy on the corn after-taste. Overall a solid and refreshing drink."
"Notes: A decent Blonde ale one of the better ones that I have had. Cheers."
"M/O: The beer is very crisp and drinkable. Overall it fits the style very well but does not exceed expectations."
"On-tap at Ale+Witch. The brew pours a translucent gold, capped with a thin wispy white head, and deposits a surprising amount of lace. The nose has very little presence, offering only something faintly metallic. The flavor seems better (initially) as it has a slightly fruity character atop a very basic beery profile. Succeeding quaffs get progressively more unpleasant, as the faint tropical fruity notes start to linger like a cheap Daquiri. I would not have another one of these."
"This was a very easy to drink beer, the flavor was good, probably average among the style. I don't know if I would seek this out but I wouldn't mind having it again."
"Not my favorite style, but not a bad beer. Average for the style. Could be I drank this one too late."
"easy drinking: yes; malt oriented: ...i dont think so."
"But the extremely high quality crafting tha twent into making this is worth something. This is a high quality beer."
"HV"
"O: Usually I like to sit and analyze my beers a bit, but this tasted so good I was surprised how quickly it disappeared from my glass. Nothing too complex, just well made and one of the best mouthfeels in recent memory."
"O: A nice easy to drink blonde ale. Not complex but a nice treat for a hot sunny day."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a decent beer, but nothing special. It was clean and crisp and showed a lot of pale, grainy malts to it. Easy drinking and moderately flavorful. Not a bad beer for the style, but not an outstanding beer overall either."
"D-Overall i was more impressed with this beer then i thought. Would drink this again. Very nice."
"drinkability: basic blond ale, dynamic taste, bold and drinkable."
"More bitter than the smell might indicate. Not as delicate as some Blondes--there's a definite black pepper aspect to the swallow. The grain kinda gets lost in this one, even on the initial sip. I like the body--it's more full than most from this style. High carbonation as well."
"overall a very weak offering from a pretty good brewery - glad i only bought a single"
"Not the beer of the year but still a pretty nice example of what the style is like. Drinks easily and refreshes on a pretty hot day."
"O: A mild and drinkable session ale. 4"
"Overall - A light flavored easy drinker with crisp finish. Nothing spectacular but a well made local beer that is easy to drink and I would definitely try again anytime."
"Pours a nice gold color. A white ring washes around the glass. Smell is tight and potpourri-like. Fresh grass and orange. Taste starts off juicy and slightly hoppy. Overall, a tart, roasty/citrusy combo that I'm not entirely wary of. Finishes a bit sour, and a little sweet. These blonde ales are odd to my palette, but that's alright."
"o - Overall a pretty average blonde ale. Some nice citrus and fruit in the taste, very easy to drink. Wouldn't seek it out again but worth trying once."
"O: solid beer, affordable and local."
"Overall is a a good blonde summer beer, easy to drink while at a BBQ or watching a game"
"Overall this is a pretty good blonde ale. nothing too special or noteworthy. good drinkability."
"Overall it is a very light crisp beer, more or less what you would expect for a golden ale."
"D- Tastes good, not too strong and I could have a bunch more but there isn't too much excitement. Easily a sessionable beer if not bold enough to be an every day one."
"Prost!!!"
"Formely known as Clipper City Golden Ale which I love drinking at the Orioles games (Camden Yards in Baltimore). Pours a nice golden ale mostly clear, shiny topaz with a lasting small ring of cream and drippy lace. Nose is spicy grass and light fruit. Flavor is spiced, slightly tart fresh apple, a hint of toast, and dry grass. Near-medium body is well-balanced, mildly tingly with carbonation. Later on the finish shows some resiny wood and light citrus. Fine example of the style."
"D: A nice beer to relax to. Definitely high on the drinkability scale."
"Less than a finger head atop a slightly hazy beer which color matches a 6 on the SRM beer color chart. Blotchy lace with little cling. Smell is slightly citrus, with malt, and wheat. Taste is crisp grain, citrus, and malt, simple but well balanced. Good body in my mouth, lots of cream feel. Good beer to have with fish, and chips. A good game beer. I have another, and I will not give it away."
"D-Very tasty and coupled with the above something you can drink all day by the pool due to the low ABV."
"Reviewed on 5/21/2010. Bottle thanks to nimbleprop. Pours a clear light orange/gold with a small white head. Aroma of sweet malt, light bready malt, floral hops. Flavor of toasted malt, floral hops, sweet malt. Not bad actually, very drinkable. This one surprised me, given the prior ratings."
"Bottle serving.... totally average in every way...nothing special... a bit watered down for my taste... could barely produce a 1/2"" head with an aggressive pour.... hardly any smell....watered down taste.... nothing special about this ale. I cannot find any redeeming qualities to highlight."
"Nothing spectacular there are other options out for this category but it was ok."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it's nothing extraordinary but this is a solid beer that is worth drinking for a long time."
"Pours a bright golden straw and produces little foam and lazy bubbles. The smell isn't particularly inviting and the taste is somewhat bland. It does have a slight hint of grassyness, but nothing too discernible from something that is mass produced."
"Drinkability is high, considering the ABV and the mild flavor. You could go all night with these, but you could save a little dough and opt for BMC if you're sessioning."
"Drinkability is pretty good. This is a light abv beer and would be fine as a session beer."
"An ok summer beer that I probably won't drink again."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet, hops are present. Taste is good, more hops than I expected from this style, well balanced. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall a good quality brew."
"D: Not a bad beer but pretty forgettable. Less interesting and unique but more sturdy than their Summer Ale and, while I rate them both the same, I liked this one slightly more for the bigger malt backbone and more varied hops."
"Pours clear golden with a lively head that is dismayingly short lived. The aroma is weak, but with a slight toastiness to it. The flavor is decently light malty, with a little shiver of hops. The finish is a little flat and sour, which isn't such a happy thing. The mouthfeel is quite thin."
"Drinkability: definite sessionable beer. Beer went down quickly on a hot day."
"CHEERS!"
"Overall, this is probably the best blonde ale I've had. I really enjoyed this for the style. Its nothing overly complex or impressive, but its quite nice on a hot day."
