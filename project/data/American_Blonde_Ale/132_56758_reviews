"This pours a semi-hazy, straw yellow color with a slight white head. The aroma is grassy/grainy. The flavor is well-balanced for the style with the prefect texture. There is a decent amount of earthy, organic flavors. It finishes with a lingering, grassy grain flavor. Interesting and yet quite simple."

"Good crisp flavor, a little dry hop pines with a great flavor and finish."
"05/16/12 Too bitter for my taste. Not as cloying as most so perhaps the hop-heads might like it."

"This beer is super drinkable. A nice beer to have on hot summer day (like today). Not very interesting, but that's probably the idea with a SMASH like this. If I could find this for $2.00 again, I'd buy it."
"I had this on draft at Mellow Mushroom while waiting patiently for the Mrs. It poured a hazy golden color, I didn't realize it was a blonde ale given then name when I ordered it, so that came as a bit of a surprise. The taste was floral almost under yeast and malts, and was actually quite nice. There was decent lacing on the glass, but not a ton of staying power. Good stuff."

"This one was on the discount table, no date. Pours a cloudy bright yellow with an off-white, slightly tan, foamy head. The head sticks around, 1/2 an inch, for the duration. The lacing is OK - little, dry spots of popped bubbles, like sea foam on the beach. The smell is fairly one-dimensional - nothing objectionable, nothing out-of-this-world: sour grain, some citrus/vinegar. It's a clean-tasting, dry beer. If this weren't the coldest night in November in Alabama but rather, oh, JULY, then this would be an amazingly refreshing ale. Sharp, metallic hoppiness, grapefruit rind, basil, lavender. This one doesn't leave you parched, and the carbonation's just about right. There's a bit of density to it that is welcome, as it's not watery or thin. A good go at it."

"The smell is simple yet delightful, a plain mix of light malts and pine hop flavor that may not be intriguing but it certainly is pleasing. The taste leads with light biscuit flavors, followed by yeast, cleaned up with a touch of hop bitterness. If this is what I expected when I saw a blonde on the menu at a new establishment, I would order the style much more frequently."

"Appearance has a slightly hazy golden straw color supporting a nice steady head leaving a nice curtain of lace. Smell has a nice floral hop aroma over the Dare malt. Taste having a bold, but not overassertive bitterness blending well with the sweetness of the malt. mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. An easy drinking PNW ale."

"o: I enjoyed this beer very much. I wish the flavors balanced themselves out a little more however overall, it was not a bad finish to the flavors. I would drink this beer again. Would not be the first thing I purchase however should I be in the specific mood for a beer with a solid bite - this it is."

"A commercial SMaSH brew! Poured into a shaker from the bottle. Pours a fairly hazy golden straw color with thick, rocky head on top. There is tons of good lacing to the glass. The nose is nice and simple and revolves around some fresh bread, light yeast smell, and very lemony hop smell to the nose. The taste is a nice flow from the nose. There is good sweet malt up front with an oily lemon zing to it. The malt and the hops play nicely together. The mouthfeel was a little thin, but finished nice and dry overall. I think this a good beer, something I am doing in my own homebrews. I think the only detriment comes from the haziness on the appearance and the thin mouthfeel. It was a good beer and a good concept."

"Rouge Single Malt Ale pours an almost hazy golden color, with a small but lacing head. There is a sweet crisp malty aroma, with just a hint of hop. The taste is the same way, good balanced mellow malty flavors, with just a hint of hops mixed in. Good full bodied flavor. Overall this is a slightly hoppy blonde ale with full flavors, very enjoyable for this style."
""
"Hazy pale blonde, one finger of white head with pretty good retention as well as a fair bit of lace. Smell is full of lemony citrus hops followed by cereal malts, more hop and a bit of earthiness, not overly complex but a nice mixture of light citrus and malts. Taste follows the nose, lemony citrus up front, bready malts follow, hoppy and lightly bitter throughout, citrus aftertaste. High carbonation , medium body though watery at points and a bit thin. This was pretty enjoyable although simple, not a whole lot going on here to make this a great beer but certainly something that I could drink a few glasses of throughout the day."
""
""
"O-quite liked this one. Simple an refreshing. Would love to kick back on a porch in the summer with a bottle of this and a steak. Probably not the best beer for the winter season, but I knew that going in."
"I would buy this again."
""

""

"I do really like the simplistic approach to this beer. Most of today's craft brews seem to have 6 kinds of malt, 6 kinds of hops, aged in this, blessed by that etc. This actually reminds me alot of the first home brew I ever made come to think of it."
"A very easy drinking beer; simple in its flavors, but I think it does what it intended to do; showcase the freshness of the ingredients and the essence of beer itself. I’m really looking forward to trying other selections from the Chatoe."
""
"And as others have said, I always respect the process of Rogue growing their own barley, malt and hops. It adds authenticity to this selection. Try it!"
"Pours a murky orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, fruits, and yeast. Taste is much the same with a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but it's pretty basic for the style."
"Overall: This beer is very refreshing and is overall, enjoyable. It has all the elements you’re looking for: maltiness, hoppiness, bitterness. However, the mouthfeel is soooo light, and the bitterness so mellow, that it lacks the profoundness necessary to raise it to the next level. Tasty hop flavor, though light. I would definitely appreciate this beer on a hot day or when I need a good swig of something refreshing, but it is not a real standout."

"Overall, I really dig this beer for the concept of Grow Your Own (GYO). For that alone, I give an overall score of 5. Having just homebrewed a wet hopped beer a few weeks ago, I really admire what Rogue did with this one. I think a tad bit more hop character would help in the aroma & nose profile, but I'm Rogue is attempting to showcase the malts, not the hops, in this finely crafted ale."
"minor carbonation, medium viscosity, and overall a decent brew to have a couple of or more. since i heard Rogue was brewing strains of yeast from the master brewer's beard, i've been a little hesitant about all their beers. i mean, can you imagine the more 'common' areas they might have already chosen for their previous beers . . . . ? yeah, you know . . . ."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while."
""
""
""
"Really good table beer"
""
""
""
""
"I don't have a lot to say about this beer, because this beer doesn't have a lot to say about itself. Single malt? Is that interesting? Certainly not this one."
"Yuck. I'm not drinking this one. I gave it several healthy swallows, and I'm throwing in the towel. Down the drain it goes. A huge disappointment."
""
""
""
"O: Nothing really stood out about this beer that would make me want to try it again but it could be something suited for a hot summer day."
""
"Pick up a bottle. Hopefully it isn't priced too high. Unfortunately most Rogue beers are pretty expensive in New Jersey."
""
""
""
""
"An interesting brew that's an easy quaffer and has some good taste to it, I like it. Probably more than most. ;^)"
""
""
""
"O - Not quite as sessionable as it should be at 5.3 % abv but worth a try if you spot it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The best. Amen!"
""
""
"O- A cool idea and a nice drinking beer. There's not too much that jumps out at me in the beer, but I do love the idea that it is from their hops and their malt. Keep it up guys!"
"Pours an attractive, if typical, clear amber with a very thick, fluffy, and rather persistent white head. Aroma is malty, yeasty and a little fruity, and not particularly strong. Malty flavor has a bitter, slightly tinny overtone and a hint of fruit Texture is smooth and has average body but not much fizz. Not one of Rogue’s better efforts, but still palatable."
""

"Picked this up at the local bottle shop for 30% off. The appearance is a light cloudy gold in color, with a thick white head. The smell is a nice fresh hop aroma. Slight spiciness. The flavor continues in that vein, but adds a subtle sweetness, and the spice now tastes more like a pepper/rye. The mouthfeel is fine, if slightly cloying. Overall a nice blonde ale, and certainly one of the better blonds I have had."
""
"Drinkability - probably pretty good with an intact bottle. I can't totally bottom out the score, I'm still nipping at the beer as I type, maybe got a third of it down, but I am always disappointed with infected bottles as I can't always find another sample easily. I'll keep my eyes open for this one though and give it another shot."
""
""
"O: A very good Blond ale. Nice hop flavor in this beer."
"D- A cool idea, probably not worth the price. It's a tasty brew, but not great for the price."
"Sorry Rogue, this one isn't doin' it for me."
""
""
""
"NICE, NOT MUST HAVE!"
"This particular one is overall refreshing, balanced, and enjoyable. However, nothing really stands out. It's about average to slightly above average for the category."
""
"Overall this beer is a really easy drinker, I like the simplicity of it and really like the crisp finish."
""
""
"Smell was light, with the biggest hints coming from grain, and a nice bread tone. Slightly sour tones present as well, maybe some sour grape or apple.. Nice play on the palate and a decent hoppy aftertaste. Biggest flavors were by far malts and grains"

""

"D: Decent."

"Cheers."

"O: Good flavor and balance, I hope future brews of this ale come out even better as the recipe improves"
"I love the concept behind this beer, and imagine this could be nice and refreshing on a hot summer day, but it's not really hitting the spot on the October evening."
"Not too bad of a beer."
"The hops really take over this beer. It is good as a lighter beer that lets the hops do the talking but I could imagine a few of these would be enough."
"Overall a well made, and well balanced beer that really doesn't try to do too much. It's clean, it's refreshing, it's got a very pleasant (though not complex) hop profile that takes center stage up until the finish, at which point their Dare Malts shine. Additionally, the beer has a great value: I only paid $6. Well worth the price, and a nice refreshing brew."
"O: This is not a terrible effort, but it is not one of Rogue's finest offerings either. In the end, this is a pleasant enough beer, but nothing about it is all that remarkable."
"O- Lack of interesting nose and the poor taste make this a loser, no reason to try again,"
"Appearance is a light orange tone with a one finger white head. The nose has grains, toasted malts, as well as floral hops. Its` taste is a mix of more of the malts, hops, biscuit and faint sweetness. Mouthfeel is light to medium with a very smooth finish. This is a great beer for a warm day in the late summer or early fall."
"A really good drinker. It's almost like they made the Brutal Bitter a 'lite' beer. I like it."
"Overall this is a drinkable, refreshing beer but nothing extraordinary."
"O: This is a perfect summer beer in my opinion, very refreshing and light, not overpowering at all. I think this would be a nice beer to go along with a pizza."
"An okay beer but it lacks finesse and complexity. Ok."
"Nice hop bite, but that's about it."
"Lightly hazy straw yellow with about a fingers worth of bubbly white head. Head disappears down to nothing but tiny swirls. Grainy (an extremely pale malt), grassy flowers. Flavor is crisp and carbonated biscuit malts, which are very pale but on the caramel lightly toasted side. Hops character is huge with floral grassy hops starting to creep in right after the first couple seconds. Some fruity hop notes start the finish but it becomes grassy and overly dry. At first the finish had great flavor changes but finishes off too dry."
"I love the theory and I cannot say I even understand how difficult it would be to produce a consistent product with self grown materials. Let alone a first run with first growth products. I love the idea. I don't love the beer."
"O: While this beer won't win a whole lot of prizes for complexity, it is likable and easy to drink."
"Bright amber body, on the lighter side of the spectrum. Caramel and floral hops in the aroma. The flavor is pretty one dimensional, a weak, nutty roasted malt flavor and a bit tart. Hopped to the point of decent balance, but theres not a whole lot there, the typical sour Pacman yeast Rogue insists on using is here at work. Bland, eh, maybe the barley needs a year or two to get firmly rooted before the flavor comes in strong."
"My response to this beer is unreservedly positive, and I have to think that some reviewers are allowing their negative feelings for Rogue to cloud their palates. I shared a 22oz. with friends, and the response was overwhelmingly positive among a wide range of beer appreciation, from hopheads and homebrewers to ""Miller Lite treats me just fine."""
"I hope they continue something like this."
"D: Pretty drinkable, overall it is an interesting beer."
"I spied, with my little eye, a good bit of sediment, so my pour was as gentle as it would be for my baby doll's skin. Color was a deep orangish-amber. BUPGOO! No head, thanks to the gentle pour. Nose smelled oddly familiar - it was the characteristic Rogue hop strain, underlain by the malty sweetness. Wow! I have noticed this in their beers before (a certain commonality), but to have it appear in a home-grown form is just impressive. It had a very bready, toasty malt flavor initially on the tongue, but also an earthy, grassy (Saaz?) hops flavor underneath. Finish was very dry, just the way I prefer my beers. Best Blonde I've had in a while!"
"D - This is a pretty nice blonde ale. I like the concept."
"The taste is quite good - exceptional balance is noted right away. Notes of lively citrus, toffee and pleasant floral hop bitterness are present. Nothing extraordinary, yet very very drinkable and friendly. Excellent thirst-quencher and thirst inducer. Calls for savory accompaniments, such as grilled meats or hot-smoked fish. I'll have another one anytime - really."
"Poured from a 22 bomber straight into a perfect pint glass.The was an uruption of carbonation once I popped it open,so I lost some of it. It poured a hazy, golden color with plenty carbonation. The taste was vey smooth with a solid hop kick. It had a very earthy mouthfeel and plenty of residue was left on the empty glass. Overall, a quality brew."
"Solid beer not stellar but solid."
"D: This is strange. The carbonation is way too high, the floral aromas are over-bearing, and it tastes like I'm licking a Bayer aspirin."
"Anywho, this beer exemplifies those ideas, and unfortunately i think most of the reviewers are probably just drinking it way too cold. You should really be approaching this as if it were an english bitter, 60ish degrees fahrenheit. If this were ever served on cask, it'd be a showstopper for sure. Best new beer i've tried in recent memory."
"Pours a light, clear, straw yellow with a fluffy white head. The aroma is sharp, sprightly, and bitter, with straw and slight lemon. The flavor is primarily bitter, with a sharp pine sting. The flavor has a light, pilsner character, with a lemony edge and some pine. The mouthfeel is prickly."
"As silly as it seems to say, I think this one would be made great by honey."
"Pours a slightly hazy amber color with two finger of head that fade slowly with thick lacing. Grainy malt and piney hops combine in the aroma. The body is much thinner than I was expecting, and along with a strong, slightly harsh bitterness is the dominate characteristics of this beer. The bitterness is sharp and earthy, with just the slightest hint of malt sweetness. The finish is lingering with an unpleasant bitterness. Not a great beer - the single malt bill doesn't have what it takes to balance the hop profile and really holds this beer back."
"I have to admit that their GYO idea really appeals to me. The beer is a rich amber color, with a touch of haze. Modest white head. The most notable thing about the beer is the intense malt aroma. It's wonderfully complex and appealing. The taste is moderately sweet, with a malt-centric trait. Medium in body, the beer is not as heavy as expected. On the low side in carbonation. The concept is fantastic, and the beer is solidly good...just not great."
" GYO indeed!"
"Inspirational!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a nice golden amber with small streams of carbonation rising from the bottom. Head was a solid 3 fingers off white froath that lasted a few minutes, but then left a nice head akin to whip on a mocha. Aroma was mildly hoppy, small amount of kick but not overwhleming. Malty did come through a bit as well. Taste was a sharp hop, not bitter. Different than I normally expect for something classified as a blonde. Felt good in the mouth. A strange mix of textures, but yet still coated well with enough to it to be interesting. Seemed to me to be one to savor, definitely not something to slam."
"This is the kind of beer I'd like to have a six pack of in place of a fizzy yellow lager."
"A fairly simple beer in some respects, but this is actually a very nice drinking Pale Ale. I almost wish it was a bit bigger so that I could better zero in on the Dare(TM) Malt and the Revolution hops. I could see myself enjoying quite a few pints of this brew. My biggest gripe is that it is a bit over-carbonated, but luckily a few swirls of my glass can get rid of the excess carbonation."
"drinkability: while it can be assumed that a single-malt ale is intended to be consistent in its attributes, it is definitely recognizable and pleasant to drink as such. It has everything it needs."
"Taste is lightly sweet to start, lemony in the middle, with a Saaz-like crisp hoppy close that lingers. Mouthfeel is quite smooth, and drinkability is very nice as well. Good brew, and admirable concept."
"D- tastes very fresh and very rogue. estimating the abv at somewhere round 5% i think this bomber is da bomb. D through the roof homey! flavorful and modest, i dig the organic nature."
"This isn't strong flavored, but it is very pleasant. There is a slight bitterness at the end."
"Appears a pale slightly hazed bright orange golden hue with a thicket of off white cream head, billows above the edge of my new DFH curved pint glass. Aroma is simple yet very nice, a touch of light lemon citrus hops and pale biscuit malts with a nice air of fruitiness. Flavor has an assertive herbal/citric rind bitterness from the hops and a pleasant malt tones coming through. Way more interesting than your average blonde ale, this is a single malted ale that gives of nice biscuit/fruit malt character that really makes the beer along with grow your own Revolution hops kickin' in to balance things out. Way more hops than your average beer very well balanced excellence. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, never thin or boring on the palate. Carbonation is perfect goes down very easy, drinkability overall is solid a nice big bottle of GYO from ROGUE, I will drink whatever offerings come out of this series."
"While the whole grow-your-own Rogue venture is an interesting concept, this resulting beer is a bit lackluster. Moderate malt with pleasant grain and some honey sweetness. Not that everything this brewery makes has to be over the top, but here the level of restraint makes for a rather one-dimensional and unengaging beer."
"D: A refreshing beer with some interesting characteristics, but overall kind of simple and--while very drinkable--leaves something wanting."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light pale malt scent along with a powerful hop aroma. It's bitter as hell and totally dominates the nose The taste is decent as well. It has a solid pale malt flavor with a very bitter hop taste. It's light and quaffable; an enjoyable blonde. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking blonde ale. It's simple in composition, yet flavorful and sessionable."
"D- great beer for the fourth of july or any other summer day. Not too heavy on the alcohol or body so you can have quite a few. Great light offering from rogue and with everything being homegrown how can you go wrong."
"Chatoe Rogue's First Growth Single Malt Ale delivers on a few points. Grow your own ingredients, and emphasizing quality over concept in terms of style. Single Malt Ale is about as good as one thing can be, without getting into the hazy realm of high concept beers. If more ales had this sort of quality I'd be a much happier camper. If all you want is hoppy, malty refreshment, try this beer out."
"Maybe I'm off base, but this beer probably shouldn't be rated as an American blonde, even if that's what it's supposed to be."
"T - Great concept but fails to deliver anything to get excited by. Better beers at the same price from both Rogue & other breweries means I won't be buying this again."
"Of the three Chatoe Rogue First Growth brews that I've reviewed so far, Dirtoir Black Lager is clearly the best. Next is Wet Hop Ale. Bringing up the rear is Single Malt Ale, a relatively lackluster offering from a brewery that is capable of much, much better."
"It seems that the Rogue line-up (the Pac-Man yeast affect) is taking on a very strong English-like taste, aroma, and body. These make for good beers but this brewery is known for their advancements of American style (West Coast) Ales- very contradictory."
"As an example of an integrated agricultural product highlighting both a particular region's raw ingredients and approach to brewing, it's a very cool opening salvo in the Chatoe series."
"D - A totally drinkable beer (if you neglect the price) that I'd quickly recommend to any hop-hating friends. They do exist, unfortunately. *sigh*"
"Bottle: Poured an amber color ale with a medium foamy head with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of caramel malt is nice enough with some piney hops with light citrus undertones. Taste is also a nice enough mix between caramel malt with a light bitter finish with medium piney notes and some citrus as well. Body is about average with good carbonation. Not bad with good drinkability factor."
"Easy enough to drink and goes down well on a hot day, but not my favorite."
"Maybe I got one out of date, how the hell would I know? No freshness dating,,,"
"Honeyish appearance, with mild floral hop aroma. A nice controlled bitterness, citrussy, a little grassy. Average plus mouthfeel. Very drinkable.Easy mouthfeel from the caramel.Suitable carbonation.I am guessing about 6% a.b.v.Thanks Presario.Refreshing for summer."
"I will keep buying these brews because, as a homebrewer, they are doing some of the work for me by doing experiments like these. However, at $7 + per bottle, I could make 5 gallons of similar brew for the price of 5 or 6 bottles."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, which I think I really think it could use more malt character. A little more malt sweetness would really round out the experience."
"D: Goes down fairly easily, but not interesting enough to want more than one of."
"Drinkability is great! It's very light and refreshing and I had no problem going through the bottle."
"Good drinker, nice brew, great concept."
"D: Overall like I mentioned earlier, a great marketing ploy, but doesn't necessarily translates into a great beer, Overall decent per style but a bomber is the limit of my interest and wouldn't care for this in six pack. A tart lemony blonde that somehow didn't quench my thirst. Besides the appearance this was only slightly better then average all around."
"From the 650 ml. bottle. Sampled on July 3, 2010. It pours a golden-yellow color with about two fingers of fizzy, bubbly white head and lots of lacing. The aroma is an enticing concoction of barley malt and thin hops. The taste is almost a polar opposite with a noted bitter hoppiness and a thinner sweet maltiness. Decent mouthfeel. I love ""liner notes"" and this one declares the actual latitude and logitude of where the barley and hops were harvested. You can't help but to wonder if the taste would have been different if these ingredients had shifted a couple of degrees. Likeable beer altogether."
"Carbonation could be toned down, and this is a bit thick, but over all a good, solid Rogue brew and something kind of new."
"Poured into a pint glass, hazy golden in color with good carbonation and a nice, thick head. Light, malty and baked bread aromas with some citrus and hops in the background. This is a very drinkable beer, with a firm, metallic body and mild hop flavors that make it refreshing."
"Drinkability: I'm glad I picked this one up. I fully support the use of terroir in beer. Less transportation cost, more locally produced products, etc., but this beer is lacking in flavor. It is fully adequate in every other area. I guess it just needed some tweaking to find itself. I would purchase again."
"Mouthfeel is light-medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"I could drink this all day. It went down easy, isn't too strong, and is actually very refreshing. I will probably pick up a few more bottles to make this my brew for relaxing on a summer day."
"Tastes a bit more adventurous than it smells. Makes no mistake: this is a simple ale that's not supposed to blow your socks off, but it's really well brewed and there's enough going on to keep your attention, make it more or less worth the price of admission. Very hoppy for a blonde, but that's fine since it turns out the malt is more aggressive than the aroma had led me to anticipate."
"More citrus and biscuit in the taste, corn is gone, thankfully. Some light spice. Carbonation and hops make this one fairly dry, and not quite as light or clean as normal. This would be nice on a hot day, but probably only one. It is well hopped."
"Pours golden and cloudy. A piney, fresh hop aroma on the nose. Flavor is a mild fruitiness of pineapple or melon and a delicate bitterness. A sticky, hoppy flavor lingers between sips. Comes across wet and refreshing. Not overly flavorful and quite sessionable."
"This definitely had a bit of a ""Dirty Blonde"" thing going on, with those earthy hops and fruit flavors getting to come out and play a little more than normal for the style. The malt and hop profiles here were pretty honest and clean thoughout and coupled with an easy feel to keep the drinkibility of this good. I had no problem polishing this bomber off with dinner. Hey, sometimes simpler is better..."
"Sometimes you just want a straightforward beer with a clean flavor profile. ""Chatoe Rogue"" First Growth Single Malt Ale fits that bill. The politics of the beer - sustainable, estate grown ingredients - is icing on the proverbial cake."
"Trying a new one from an oldie but goodie, Rogue. I like the concept - malt and hops grown by Rogue, beer brewed by Rogue. Nice sturdy looking beer, blonde, slightly hazed, thick rocky head. Not a lot of character to the aroma, but clean, crisp, and grainy. Mmm... much more going on here than the nose suggested. Yes, pretty basic, but really bright flavors here. Nice crispy malt, light dry hop. Nice fresh grain and hay flavors. Light and lively on the palate, smooth, highly refreshing and schwillable. The best quality of this beer is it's simplicity. Could be easily summed up in three words; crisp, clean, fresh."
"Golden amber with a sustained white head. Fresh grains and grassy hops aroma. The taste is balanced but predictable. Malt flavors are smooth and grainy, some pine is present. A well cared for beer, I'd peg it for more of an amber ale. It should be in a six pack at a lesser doller per ounce ratio."
"D: An all around beer guy beer. You have to give Rogue props for producing their own barley, malt & hops while at the same time offering a beer that is familiar, yet distinctive. Not quite as nice as the Dirtoir, but with four ingredients, locally sourced, you can't find many that are better."
"What can I say, I am something of a sucker for gimmicky offerings, but I think this is a special beer."
"A pretty tasty and drinkable blonde ale, one way more enjoyable than the anemic standard for the style, and propped up with the malt and hop characteristics of, well nearly a properly rendered Czech Pilsener, of all things. Well, revolutions often have a side-effect of recalibrating expectations, and Rogue has provided at least a glimpse of that here."
"Color was very nice. A nice golden amber, a nice head of off white color. Again taste was nothing more than average. Kind of disappointed."
"both the aroma and taste are very clean and awfully reminiscent of a lager. i know this is technically an ale, but i'm not sure that i'd be able to pick it out a kolsch/pils lineup. you get that pilsner-like bite at the end but otherwise it's very balanced. although abv is unknown, i'd be shocked if it was north of 5.5%, so it's exceedingly quaffable. i can't get over how carbonated it is - my glass nearly overflowed on every pour throughout the bottle - so that makes it a good choice on a hot day. i'm not sure that ""single malt"" does for beer what it does for scotch, but this one's a winner."
"Opened up a bottle today and poured it into a pint glass. The beer was orange in color and a bit hazy. The head was substantial and there was a bit of lacing on the glass. Took in a deep smell of this ale and the smell of caramel and hops were detected immediately. Soon after, the lingering smell of malts became apparent. I took my first sip of this ale and could immediately taste the caramel and hops. Then it balanced it self of well with the malts. Quite honestly, it was very tasty. The drinkability of this ale was very smooth. This ale surprised me as I was not expecting much. I will definitely pick up another bottle when I get the chance!"
"This is a blonde ale? Could have fooled me, it's so hop forward. In a pint glass the beer was a hazy orange color with a small white head and a little bit of lace. Very citrus aroma, a little malt. Big time grapefruit taste, some malt that was hidden by the hops. Not very balanced, not like any blonde I have had, but still a nice beer."
"Drinkability is good an enjoyable brew. Want to thank merlin48 for sharing this one with me."
"Highly drinkable and reasonably priced."
"OVERALL: My first estate beer was from Sierra, and maybe I was spoiled, but given that this one was from the Great Northwest I was slightly disappointed. That said, I was looking for something more bold, hoppy and rich. That prejudice may have led me to not quite fully appreciate the fact that as a nice, crisp and refreshing summer beer the Chatoe Rogue would be absolutely ideal."
"I like the idea of this beer and I'm glad I tried it because I've often thought of growing barley and am growing hops right now in my backyard. I don't think I would reach for it again based on flavor, but I might. It is a well disguised high gravity beer."
"Overall, not anything special or anything I'd seek out again."
"D- Drinks rather nicely, even though if it is uninteresting."
"Dry pop rock palate upfront, but a gypsum and resin dry palate i the finish."
"Picked up this bottle at Hy-Vee on Grand in Des Moines. Pour a hazy blonde with a very loose head. The aroma is citrusy and piney with some honey and good fruitiness. The flavor is grapefruit with a little saltiness and a nice all around citrus rind bitterness. Not bad."
"D: Not a bad beer, but it just doesn't have alot to it. It's just boring, so to speak. Of all of the beers Rogue had produced over the years, I've liked most of them. I have to say I'm a bit dissappointed."
"Drinkability: I'm just not into Rogue's first foray into the chateau-beer world. This beer is awfully rough around the edges, and my guess would be that this is due to the hops. I just don't think this variety is well-suited to a single-variety beer."
"Drinkability: I'll admit, it's a cute concept. Decently drinkable and not quite as simplistic and one-dimensional as I'd first anticipated. Let's see where they go with this whole ""GYO"" idea."
"Pours a toasted grain color with a fairly tight off white head that settles inot a light cap. The aroma is quite faint there is a very light bready malt scent, thats about it. The taste is of a light malt with some fruity notes and a subtle grassy bitter hop bite. The feel is moderate with very fizzy carbonation, lightly sweet on the palate and finishes slightly bitter. A nice easy drinking brew. Good balance between the sweet malt and grassy hops. The flavor won't blow you away but you can easily pack away a few of these."
"Doing the math, that means an FG of 1.011 and an ABV of 4.9%"
"Certainly not worth the price, and really doesn't work as a pale or a blonde. Love the idea of the series, but this needs some adjustments in next year's batch."
"Tinny mouthfeel, good carbonation, with decent heft. Just a hair on the watery side. Slightly bitter, dry finish. The hopping is just on this side of blonde ale. Understated and a little boring."
"Overall I definitely think this was more of an APA than an American Blonde. Either way it's a very understated beer, certainly not bad but also not worth seeking out."
"Pours a nice dark golden amber with a substantial, thick, creamy head. Not much to write home about in the sniffer department, as best as I can tell, but not unpleasant either. Light, hoppy flavor and exceptionally easy to drink. Definitely an interesting offering from one of my favorite breweries, especially when you consider that this is a true DIY brew."
"Drinkability is very good. Well-rounded beer."
"well executed for the style, but not exactly on my list of favorite styles. if this was in 6'ers for the pool party summer it would be a better fit."
"D: not impressed with this one, very basic flavors not complex at all. Dissapointed cause rogue makes some decent beers."
"Rogue First Growth Single Malt Ale is cloudy, bright, golden and very lively, with a foamy, white head that has outstanding retention. Oh, outstanding lacing and sip lines, too. It has a bright, fruity aroma that's recognizable as Rogue. There are notes of lemon and tropical fruit. It has a super smooth medium-light body with a crisp, clean finish. There's a nice, resiny bitterness and hop flavor that veers toward pineapple and mango. The malt pretty much stays out of the way and isn't really sweet or dry. It's really yummy. This is a spot-on American Pale Ale. I had this after working all day in the yard in 90-degree weather. Talk about quenching and refreshing!"
"Good carbonation, smoother on the mouth than I thought it might be. Easy drinking, I had no problem putting down a bomber."
"Cloudy golden body, white head. Toast, lemon peel, and yeast on the nose. Same on the palate. Light toasty grain, moderate citrus hop flavor and a very dry finish. Light body. I enjoyed it, but nothing I would seek out again. Quite ordinary, uninspired."
"I have to say to me seeing Rogue do a malt driven beer seems strange.Poured a bright lighter golden with a fluffy one finger white head that left broken rings of lace as it settled very slowly.Light aromas,mainly light honey,and toasty grain.Honey malt flavors hit up front on the palate along with some toasty/graininess,a faint herbal hop note lingers in the finish.Its lagerish to me flavor wise,its crisp and relatively clean,not bad."
"Drinkability is OK. Would be so much better if it had a tad more flavor diversity."
"Certainly not a blonde ale in my opinion. Delicious and worth the price. You can't go wrong."
"D: This isn't normally my favorite style, but this wasn't too bad for a blonde. I was pleasantly surprised by the bitterness."
"Not Rogue's best, but not a flop either. It's a little too bitter for a non-IPA - I finished the beer 10 minutes ago, and I can still taste the hops. I'd love to see more from the GYO series, just something a little less unbalanced."
"- Overall this is a fantastic fresh tasting brew... and it's great to see that a single malt and single hop ale can come out so good. Great job to Rogue, for yet another great beer."
"4.5/4/3.5/4/4"
"drinkability is solid - i am not a fan of many blonde ales but this and NB's are two of the best"
