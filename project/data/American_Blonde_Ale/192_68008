Instead of the clean, bland blond ales you usually meet in the summer, this had a lovely mix of mild citrus hops and grapefruit sourness (not bitterness) that adds an extra-refreshing edge. The aroma has a mix of freshly toasted bread/malt and light apricot fruit. Overall, a great take on the style. I'm glad to see brewers finally figuring out how to make a fun and satisfying blond ale.","tempest","Jun 11, 2012"

4.23,12.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Medium bodied, displaying a nice range of flavors from malts, fruits and a light touch of hops. The malt is very lightly toasted, not getting in the way of the apricot and lemon freshness. There's a slight tartness from these fruits, just enough to be pleasantly summery without making you pucker. The hops in the back are citrusy and a touch floral, giving a quick bitterness that is packed full of citrusy flavor and adding to a dryness to a juicy finish. The mouthfeel is smooth, almost slick and goes down incredibly easily. This would be a fantastic beer to sit down and enjoy a few of on a hot summer afternoon. Chock full of more flavor than your average summer beer, this one is definitely worth a buy.","chodinheaven","May 29, 2012"

This works aroma-wise but the drinking experience on its own is not my favorite. Works well with a meal due to its lightness, but it's definitely a blonde ale that was trying to be something else. Whatever it was, I've no clue.","magictacosinus","May 02, 2012"

Pours hazy golden straw color with a nice 2-3 fingers of fairly dense white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a decent sized lacing cap that lasts. A nice amount of lacing clings around the glass as well. Aromas of big lemon, pepper, biscuit, grass, spiciness, and other light fruitiness. Some very nice aromas here with good strength as well. Taste of lemon, pepper, spices, bread, citrus, grass, and a bit of tart graininess. Fair amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, bread, and spices that last for a bit on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moutfeel that is a bit on the watery side, but not in a bad way. Drinks really easily as I would have expected for a beer brewed for the summer months. No alcohol presence at all as expected. Overall, some seriously great stuff here. Nice amount of well balanced flavors and super smooth drinking.","superspak","Nov 17, 2011"

The fairly thin, white head that recedes pretty quickly but leaves some nice strings of lace in its path. The smell includes spicy and fresh hoppy aroma. The taste has a mellow malt backbone belgium style. Fresh and lively hop flavor, mostly pine and ginger spice notes. Dry and refreshing flavor. The mouthfeel is lighter in body and well carbonated. Smooth even texture with a dry, crisp finish. Overall this would be an excellent summer seasonal. Highly refreshing. Bright, fresh flavors and very drinkable.","WoodBrew","Nov 05, 2011"
3.98,5.6,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"O: This is quite good, though I'm disappointed I'm drinking my first at the end of October rather than the end of summer, as it would make a great summer drink.

A wave of juicy sweet apricot and apple flavors up front, but a touch of tangy lemon keeps the sweetness in check. There’s a light earthy hop presence that lends a nice depth. Very lively feel to this stuff, tingly carbonation with a light toasty malt profile and a very clean, crisp finish. Regardless of style, this is a pretty damned refreshing brew (it was the perfect lawnmower beer on this day). As a blonde ale? Top notch.","PDXHops","Aug 28, 2011"

Absolutely pick up some somersault if you get the opportunity. It's great on a sunny afternoon, but would be good otherwise as well.

The fruit / spice add subtlely to the complexity and flavor of this beer without overwhelming it. I wouldn’t guess there were any additions to this beer necessarily, and that is a good sign when adding extra ingredients in a light, summer quaffer. I am definitely enjoying this beer; light, refreshing, malty, fruity, spicy and even a touch hoppy, this beer is quite complex and I am quite happy to be having a sixer of this. I have a feeling this beer is going to be completely overlooked by the beer-geek set, but I am quite pleased with it.","Gueuzedude","Aug 08, 2011"

4.03,6.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Somersault pours a little bit darker than blonde, it's a step or two towards tangerine, and crystal clear. The white foam that crowns the beer hits three fingers in height, and displays above average head retention. The sides of the glass are left heavily coated in lacing. The nose has a light grainy sweetness, with a definite touch of apricot. The combination of grapefruit from the Centennial hops and a little bit of ginger forms an interesting counterpoint in the aroma. The flavor is more of the same, with a gentle, rolling bitterness serving as a transition between the sweet flavors and the hops and ginger mid palate. I'm pleasantly surprised at how nice and mild the grapefruit presence is, I haven't been a huge fan of beers that use predominantly Centennial in the past. The mouthfeel is nice, relatively light bodied for a summer ale and paired with a carbonation that does more than just cut through the beer, but stops short of the bubbly activity of, say, a well brewed Belgian. Somersault is a solidly put together beer, and one I could drink a lot of while hanging out with friends on a hot summer day.","axeman9182","Aug 05, 2011"

It tasted very lightly sweet with notes of citrus and fruit at first then became a tad sour with a mild hoppy finish.

Not very balanced, and the ABV seems higher than it is. This one goes straight to my head without any nuanced enjoyment. It feels light, but the finish is so dry that it hurts drinkability. It has more of a ""liquor"" feel to it than a beer feel. Maybe that's just the style, but I don't particularly care for it. I don't think I would buy this one again.

4.32,14.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This ale has honey golden color with a head that clings for a long time. The smell is bright with a hint of complexity.

3.92,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Beautiful copper with clean transparency, thin white foamy head that retains nicely throughout leaving spotty sea foam lace. The smell is fruity. Definite touch of apricot and fruity hops on a clean biscuit, bready malt backbone. Touch of light sweet caramels and floral tones and ginger touches. Nice flowery hops kick in the front of the tounge followed by light fruits of apricot, lemon and pineaple notes. Citrusy. Clean bready malts with a touch of caramel with a clean finish. A slight creaminess in the front with a slightly watery finish. Overall, watery but this is nice for a summer beer. Nice fruity, light and easy to drink beer. Nothing cloying in the fruit, great well rounded hop profile with a light bready malt. Great, easy to drink summertime beer.","JayS2629","Jun 02, 2011"

Fits the style of an American Blonde Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.

That disgusting husky grain smell and taste are just brutal. I get that smell/flavor in so many American Blonde Ales too. This beer skips that and manages to become incredibly refreshing and tasty. It's a great hot weather beer and also a perfect beer to pass on to a BMC drinker.","beavers","May 24, 2011"
3.03,-19.6,3.5,3,3,3,3,"O - Its a session beer and I can see where they were going with it. Its actually pretty refreshing I certainly could see drinking a couple of these on a summer day.

3.78,0.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Somersault starts with the aroma, which has a certain level of lemony graininess. It also has a light sourdough bread characteristic that I usually get out of lagers. It’s a pretty beer, blonde in color, with a nice foamy head. I’m eating this with goat cheese and it actually goes really well together. The high carbonation of the beer helps to scrub the palate of the creamy goat cheese, and the citrusy taste plays well with the smooth cheese. I had this on tap earlier this week and didn’t really care for it, but for whatever reason tonight it’s kind of hitting the spot. Does a neat trick of being very light and easy to drink while remaining full flavored. Not bad at all.","eclaycamp","May 22, 2011"
3.36,-10.9,4,3,3,4,4,"I know this is an American blonde but I swear I got a feeling of a belgian pale from it. Light yellow-orange in color, decent head. Smells like orange a little. The flavor had a bit of citrus and peach but just a tiny bit and then I tasted spice (I swear). This wasn;t bad but I did not find it as refreshing as some of the other reviewers here and I most likely won;t revisit this.","ArrogantB","May 21, 2011"

The aromas are of yeast, a honey like sweetness, and nice coriander/citrus zest. It smells pretty damn good. The flavors are of sweet pale malts, light honey, spices, and orange peels. It has a nice crisp bite to it. The flavor isn't quite as good as the aromas but it's pretty solid. It drinks well and is an excellent option for a hot summer's day.

3.91,3.7,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Tangy sweet apple notes leads off the flavor too, zippy with a little bit of earthy dandelion and residual herbal hop bitterness.

Light bodied and easy drinking, great summer session candidate.","emerge077","May 17, 2011"
3.61,-4.2,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Flavor is coarse and dry, presumably from the addition of oats, and offers bready lemon notes and a bit of spice on the finish.

3.71,-1.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good, light, easy drinking blonde ale that would for sure hit the spot on a hot summer day. Everything was pretty on par for it's style and good, the only thing I would change is to have the finish be a little less bitter and maybe make the body a tad bit lighter. This brew had great drinkability, I could easily put down three or four of these while playing disc golf in the summer. If New Belgium was available in Michigan I would probably buy a couple six packs during the summer to enjoy, but since they aren't i'll have to enjoy the two I have. If you have access to New Belgium and want a good light summertime beer then you might want to give Somersault a try. So far the two beers I have had from New Belgium have been good, I hope the third one I have is just as good.","StoutHunter","May 11, 2011"
3.48,-7.7,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Another seasonal with that ""signature"" Fat Tire biscuit maltiness, I like balance but I really prefer my summer beer to be lighter and more uplifting.

3.68,-2.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Always nice to see new faces in the mixed sixer section. This member pours a clear brass topped by a healthy finger of ever-so-slightly off-white foam. The nose comprises coriander, wheat, light grapefruit peel, very light caramel and light orange zest. The taste holds notes of heftier (yet still mild) caramel, coriander, light lemon zest, light butter, mandarin oranges, and light grapefruit zest. The body is a slightly hefty light, with a very light moderate carbonation and a nearly crisp finish. Overall, a nice little blonde, no pretenses toward anything but refreshment, and this brew delivers in that area. Not bad.","TMoney2591","May 10, 2011"
3,-20.4,3,3,3,3,3,"Poured a pretty clear golden color into the SA Perfect Pint Glass. Nice creamy white head that hung around for a couple minutes and nice lacing. Not a whole lot on the nose: malt, a little yeast, and some flowering overtones. Taste was pretty decent: malt, biscut, some citrusy flavor, and no bitterness whatsoever. Not bad for a summer brew, I guess, but there are better ones out there. Doubtful I'd seek this one out again.","Schmittymack","May 08, 2011"
3.66,-2.9,4,3,4,4,3.5,"O: This will be a nice summer beer, nothing over the top and every bit as good as Skinny Dip. A welcome change to the summer line up.
