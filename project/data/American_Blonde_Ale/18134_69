Smell is of malt, grain, grass, and hay. Taste is much the same with a sweet and slightly fruity finish. There is a very mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable and pretty tasty for what it is.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 30, 2012"

2.96,-10.3,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,3,"I've passed this one so many times... Thankfully, a single made itself available recently, so I finally decided to give it a shot. It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of short-lived off-white foam. The nose is a blast of buttery biscuit, with little else getting in the way. The taste changes things up a bit (thankfully), with notes of orange zest, light lemon peel, caramel, and light buttery toffee coming through. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, nothing too interesting going on here, but nothing all that offensive, either. Just another blah beer that's gonna be passed over by me in the future...","TMoney2591","Aug 17, 2011"
3.06,-7.3,4,3,3,3,3,"A decent blonde, it pours a pretty golden color with a small white head and just a bit of hoppiness and some mild bitter notes. Not a bad beer, but not my favorite from redhook.

3.72,12.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall it was a little bitter to be a real sessionable ale, and is honestly a bit forgettable. Nothing really standing up and greabbing you about this one. A decent pale ale that doesnt really stand out in the crowd.","mikesgroove","Apr 24, 2011"
3.46,4.8,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"During a visit to Portsmouth we took the opportunity to visit Redhook Brewery. Tried the Golden Blonde. The color was golden clear with nice carbonation that gave way to a thin white head and lacing. The nose was a very faint citrus, if any. The taste was good, nice crisp, clean with maybe a hint of lemon. The mouthfeel was good and I certainly could do a Session with this beer.","WoodBrew","Apr 04, 2011"

3.47,5.2,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Hm, well for starters on appearance, it looks almost completely see through, I am very surprised at how clear it is. It looks like a lager almost to me, I know it's a blonde ale, but still. There is a lot of carbonation. The head looked nice when I first poured it, it almost looked creamy, with a one finger width, but now it's almost gone. The appearance is average. The first smell I get is the hops, which is good, it means it's not pussing out the hop aspect. The next smell I pick up is citrus, and finally a small malt sweetness in the very back. The smell it's amazing, but it smells pretty good. Well the taste is a little disappointing, instead of getting that hop bite at first, you get the malts instead. There is a small hop bite mixed in there pretty nicely, but it is subdued by the overall sweetness and maltyness of the beer. There might be a tiny tiny citrus, but nothing like what I was smelling, which is also disappointing. All in all the beer tastes a little bit watered down to me. With all that being said, it isn't a bad tasting beer, it's good, just very average. An average beer from what I can tell is a so far average brewery. As far as mouthfeel, and drinkability go: the mouthfeel is ok, nothing special, the drinkability is pretty good since it is watered down a bit, and the taste is easy drinking and it's yummy enough not to be a gross watery beer. Overall an average beer.","MaltsOfGlory","Mar 15, 2011"

Hops seem to greet the nose at first but that is followed up by a vaguely yeasty slightly malty sensation.

3.13,-5.2,3.75,3.25,3,3.25,3,"Taste, middle of the road, minimal hopping, but a tang, that faint sweetness again, very little malt heft, but enough to separate it from a lesser classification.

The beer pours a clear golden, a few shades darker than pale, with a decent creamy white head and some lacing. The beer is light to medium bodied, and a little thicker and creamier than what is typical in the style. There is a hoppy presence right up front in this beer and a rather citrusy rind taste more on the back end. This isn't a particularly complex blonde ale, it is smooth, quite a bit sweeter than most other blondes, with some graininess and biscuity qualities lurking not too far below. This is definitely more chewy than what is typical for the style. There is just a slightly off lemony citrus taste, and a bit too much hop up front that detracts from this beer. The beer is moderately carbonated and has an aftertaste that does linger a bit. Not a bad beer, glad I gave it a try.","albern","Nov 15, 2008"

The aroma that comes to mind quickly is sweet, but not in a way that is overpowering, but dominant and I would imagine this is from the malts as well as having a slight fruit like ester to it.

This is a light (please do not confuse my portrayal of light as equaling most mass produced light beers) beer that is very refreshing, easy to drink on warmer days.

Aroma is disctinctly nice light malty, can't smell hops but my smeller is bad and it's a bit colder than it should be, and it's not supposed to have much anyway. Color medium gold. Bottle conditioned, slight floaties are just fine. Flavor -- nice balance, on the malt side. Very slightly fruity, just enough hops to balance but not enough to notice. All things delicate and well balanced. Mouthfeel is pleasant, body but lightness and a dry finish. Overall impression is good, drinkability is dangerous.

3,-9.1,3,3,3,3,3,"Slight nose of malt/wheat.  Not very good retention or head at all..  Clear gold in color.  Not a ton of flavor.. just very clean and crisp beer.  There is not enough character in the  brew for my taste.  Nothing stands out as special.","frank4sail","May 20, 2002"
3.67,11.2,3.5,4,3.5,3,4,"Pale, sub-amber appearance.  Frothy head, bumpy on the inside of the pint glass.  Subtle aroma, slightly yeasty/bready.  Light-bodied mouthfeel, just a hint of maple/honey to the malty tastes.  Hops are hardly present but the mild malts don't throw the beer remarkably out of balance.  Flavor is almost gone by the swallow.  Blondes are blondes in the world of beer, I'll always take one over a detergent-tasting macro but not too much interesting here.  Certainly is easy on the tongue and drinkable.","ADR","May 19, 2002"

3.2,-3,3,3,3,3,4,"Had this for the first time in a long time @ The Times, downtown Boston. It was okay. Quite the drinkable and clean product, but it also had quite a bit of diacetyl, which is not cool for the style.","Todd","Nov 30, 2001"
3.83,16.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Notes: Quite complex for a light beer. Much different from our bright tank samples at the brewery which were less stripped and fuller -- none the less very enjoyable.","BeerAdvocate","May 24, 1998"
