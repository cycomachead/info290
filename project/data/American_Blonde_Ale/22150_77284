4.07,6.8,4.25,4,4,4,4.25,"Considering this a brett-ed saison brewed with corn and rice. Pours a cloudy straw color, billowing soapy whit head, settles slowly to a half inch; sheet of thick lace down the glass. Smell: floral, hay, lemony and spicy, moderate amount of barnyard bouquet, hint of dough I'm the back. Taste: lemon, pineapple note, grainy...breakfast cereal, sugar cookie note, into a dry finish highlighting a big spicy and somewhat rindy hopping. This drinks light and refreshing, but the carbonation is really dialed in well to provide heft and lasting power at lower grav. Really well done...the brett adds a lot to all aspects of the beer vs Classique.","babaracas","Dec 12, 2014"

3.88,1.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours moderately hazy golden straw color with a 2 finger dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of tart lemon zest, pear, apple, cracker, bread, hay, straw, grass, herbal, clove, black pepper, musty funk, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lightly tart lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, clove, black pepper, hay, straw, grass, herbal, musty funk, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Light earthy tartness and moderate yeast/hop spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lightly tart lemon zest, pear, apple, cracker, bread, clove, black pepper, hay, straw, grass, herbal, musty funk, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a great crisp malt/yeast/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a very nice saison style. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 19, 2014"

4.29,12.6,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,"this is the best thing I've had from stillwater in ages, its just fantastic beer, perfect for summer, and a nice alternative to a berliner weisse, but does many of the same things. made with corn and rice, clever grain bill to go with the wheat in here. hazy and blonde, extremely creamy, and leaving gorgeous ring lacing as i sip it down, and the head never settles at all, staying a few inches high and super airy in the glass. a nose of subtle brett, a couple of strains were used in this, along with a saison yeast strain that i taste a lot more than i smell. the taste is awesome, appreciable grain character to this, starchy just a little from the rice i assume, and really full bodied. the corn may contribute to some mid palate sweetness, but trio of yeasts clean up any and all residual sugar in the very dry finish. this is the more elegant and refined side of brett fermentation, not heavy on the funk at all, just a little more tart and interesting than a normal farmhouse strain, but it brings the best out of the unique grain bill. tasty and original beer here, low in alcohol and very effervescent, which makes it a bottle i wish i have five or six of to drink in a session instead of just sharing one. stillwater needs to keep going in this direction, its fabulous beer. love the full feel to it, the drinkability, and the yeast complexion. top tier offering here at a fair price.","StonedTrippin","0"

Effervesced and light body, with a roasted and toasted character towards the end of the palate. The aftertaste is more of the toasty and grainy characteristics, with hints of sweetness.

4.01,5.2,3.5,3.75,4.25,4,4,"I was really excited to pop this beer open, because I honestly had no idea what to expect from it. Stillwater Premium pours out a pale golden yellow color with a large white head. The aroma, at first, smells like an adjunct lager with maybe a touch more bright citrus. As either the beer warms or I get closer into the glass, more subtle aromas come out. The musty aspects from the Brett start to take over, as well as a bit of spicy/earthy hops. The taste is, again, really interesting. It has the clean, crisp, and citrusy lager taste there, but it's subverted by a heavy amount of very musty funkiness that cuts right through the lager base like a knife. The Brett funkiness has a fun time interacting with the citrus and hops in the beer. I don't know how to really describe the feeling of the funk hitting in this beer - it almost feels like the mouthfeel gets thicker when the funk comes rolling through, even though it obviously doesn't. It's probably due to a strong dryness from the Brett that fights against the crisp, bright, and light lager base. Premium might not be a beer that completely succeeds on all levels, but it's interesting enough that I can't help but recommend it.","shand","Beers"

I get what Brian’s going for, and I think that he probably did an excellent job in creating that beer, but it’s not quite what I was hoping for and is definitely not for everybody. Admittedly, I’m a bit picky when it comes to brett funk: I like the musty, dank, and fruity characters, but get a little sensitive when the spicy, phenolic side of brett becomes more prominent. In this beer, the latter is definitely the case. But, it looks, smells, and feels fantastic, overall—it's just the prominence and balance of different brett notes that I'm somewhat at odds with. My understanding is that Brian wanted to create a very clean, very drinkable brett beer, and using brett in primary with the malt base he did, he did exactly that.","fmccormi","Nov 14, 2012"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, banana, fruit, spices, earthy funk, and horseblanket. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, spices, earth, and massive funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The brett going on in this one definitely took a front row seat in both the aroma and especially the flavor.

4.38,15,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"	The flavoring has a mild tartness to it and a light spice with a bitterness midpoint. At first I thought of a rye spiciness, with its concomitant fruit-like notes. Turns out there’s a double addition of Brett, which would explain the interesting and hard-to-place flavors and aromas, as well as the exceptionally dry finish. (And what I can only describe as a light “baking soda” hint on the flavor.) Crisp, light, delicious.","elNopalero","Jun 14, 2012"

4.17,9.4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Growler from GBX poured into a weizen glass. Nice amber pour with a ton of pillow white head. Great spoting and lacing throughout. Smell is of zesty fruits, complex notes of citrus and some wood. Taste is a great mix of hops, malts and fruits. Big bold taste with a zesty kick on the end that leave me wanting more. Feel is lively with awesome carbonation and some dry champagne on the tongue. Very interesting and a bonus. Overall- A very quality brew from Stillwater. My first experience with this outfit and I'm impressed. A very enjoyable Blonde that had so much going on with the taste and smell. Sort of Farmhouse, sort of Saison, sort of Good! Will hit another of these-","TheDinger","Mar 14, 2012"

4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"M: The late-sip pairing of sweet malts, Belgian spices, and Brettanomyces is a game changer, sweet and funky and lively. Not quite a full-on saison, although it is this close {indicates mere millimeters with thumb and pointer finger}. The ale feels heavy though, perhaps my only significant complaint.","akorsak","Feb 28, 2012"

3.98,4.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured into a Black Raven imperial pint. Pours a slightly cloudy pale yellow amber. Healthy three finger head and active carbonation leaving chunks of foam on the side of the glass as it slowly dissipated. Looked great! Aromatic aroma of Belgian yeast and spicing, light fruit and citrus, slightly sour and funky. Flavor dominated by citrus, mostly lemon, and brett funk. Light grain and sweet malt. Astringently bitter finish, but supported by the fruit from the citrus. I'm not a big fan of brett, but I have to admit that the low level in this ale along with the refreshing lemon flavor was quite nice. Light to medium bodied. Not my style, but I enjoyed the whole bottle. Good job, Stillwater.","LiquidAmber","Feb 17, 2012"

4.5,18.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"woah... definitely a mind-f@#k here. i think that when taken in context, this is one very very well done beer. one foot in outer space, one foot in hipster dive bar. pours a clear gold with a white head that holds and leaves lots of lace. nose is mainly grain, corn and earthy hops. touch of fruit (lemon?), spice(lemon pepper?) and bread thrown in for good measure. taste is crisp, dry, earthy, corny and euro-hoppy. the hops seem very ""real pilsner"" like. just a tiny touch of bitter and lots of earthy goodness. extremely clean finish with no aftertastes. brett hasn't quite shown itself yet, so i am curious to see where this goes. created as deconstructed hipster schwill, i find it to really hit the mark. light, with flavors of adjunct all over, but somehow coming off elegant and ""premium"" for sure. not what i expected, but not a let down by any means. simple, clean, well done.","timtim","Feb 05, 2012"
3.83,0.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured out as a lightly hazy looking yellow color. The head was white and a little on the fizzy side. The smell of the beer was made of mostly corn aromas and bready yeast. Smells very much like a very generic ale. The taste is sweet with some corn and grainy flavors. The mouthfeel was well carbonated with a decent body to it. Overall this beer was pretty good, I understand the style that was being attempted here and I think it's pretty good. I found this beer to be pretty refreshing actually.","Knapp85","Jan 28, 2012"
