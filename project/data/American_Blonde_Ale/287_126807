Scents of fresh apricot, vanilla, light cardamom, sugar cookie-like malt sweetness, a slight floral aroma is also present. Overall impression of aroma is of a wonderfully fruity and sweet beer, with a big hit of apricot, but also showcasing the vanilla and cardamom additions and a bit of the malt. Very nice. Flavor begins lightly sweet and sour, with notes of vanilla, sweet and lightly sour apricot juice and very light sweet spiciness, likely from the cardamom. Middle moves into a flavor profile that is very strongly reminiscent of the tart flesh near the apricot pit with lesser amounts of vanilla still present. Finish is sweet and tart with notes of tart apricot flesh, vanilla and a background of sweet spices. Aftertaste is sweet and tart with notes of apricot, vanilla and cardamom. Overall impression of flavor is of a nice fruit beer, one that melds the sweetness of apricot with the tartness of the innermost flesh and blends it well with vanilla and cardamom notes. My only complaint is that I wish there was a bit more assertiveness to the malt. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with light carbonation and a lightly tart feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a nicely done beer that captures the feel of eating an apricot. Overall this is a fantastic beer. More experimental than Mars, it has a wonderful aroma, a beautiful flavor and a lovely mouthfeel. Quite nice and well worth hunting down.","Auraan","Dec 08, 2014"

There is a bright apricot that loses it's way amidst the earthy vanilla that gets stronger as you drink and the cardamom which also adds earth. There is a strange spice taste int eh finish with a tinge of alcohol as well.  It's almost a plastic like taste or a taste like something in there is synthetic.  There is a sour undertaste overall.  Finishes with a bitterness form hops that frankly saves it and makes it drinkable.  That hops presence comes to the palate to lighten up all that thickness and thick flavor and leaves a bit of bitterness alongside the tart apricot.  This frankly tastes like a spiked fruit punch and the mouthfeel is just too heavy. I do not think these flavors work well together.","utopiajane","Beers"

This stuff pours a clear straw topped by a finger of dirty white foam.  The nose comprises orange zest, powdered sugar, Creamsicle, light coriander, vanilla, and a touch of lemon peel.  The taste brings in more of the same, the vanilla and spices leading the way, followed by a strong wave of orange and apricot juices, which end up washing out all else.  Some mild lemon-like tartness pervades the finish.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, a nice enough beer, but I think the fruit juices overpower the proceedings.  Not really a peaceful situation, if you ask me, but also not entirely chaotic.","TMoney2591","Nov 17, 2014"

Reminds me of orange cream soda a bit but with candied apricot instead of orange.  The cardamom brings a spicy herbal character at the back end. The taste starts with a strong tartness from the apricot.  The tartness was not too prevalent in the nose but dominates the flavor. The vanilla softens it a bit before the cardamom takes over giving the end a spicy flavor.  The combo of flavors is quite odd and totally unique.  Each of the adjuncts stand out and are identifiable with the exception of the honey.  Overall, I'm glad to have tried this unique and creative brew even if the flavors don't harmonize that nicely.","homebrew311","Nov 16, 2014"

This beer has a lot to offer, both a strong suit and a weakness. Each major flavor is clear and ample, and most work well together. The fruit and cardamom certainly do, but the strong notes of vanilla made it too much. A good, adventurous concept that had very good realization, and it is a calming brew, but ultimately unbalanced. My relatively high score looks on the bright side of their adventurous goal and less on objective, balanced, traditional beer scoring- any adjunct-scorners will probably burn their hands just holding this bottle.","1000lbgrizzly","Nov 09, 2014"

Head retention and lacing are both decent enough.  Aroma is fruity and sweet, it smells like apricots, vanilla, cardamom, honey and a sweet spiciness.  I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, it's sweet, fruity and a bit spicy and somewhat tart, too.  I do think it's more fruity and sweet than anything else.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and smooth with a moderate amount of carbonation.  This sure doesn't drink like a beer that's 7.5% ABV.

Appears with minimal head even after a hard pour a bit under carbonated, bottled on 10/2/14.  Hazed apricot glowing orange, minimal white head as mentioned left fine speckled lacing.  Aroma tart apricot, soft vanilla even some earthy apricot pit notes.  Honey ferments out pretty well, maybe some slight floral notes.  Flavor has vanilla all over, the base is a tart mild citric experience of the apricot juice, there's alot going on honey, cardamom, apricot, and vanilla compete and lack cohesion.  I'm enjoying it but it's a challenging beer to consume.  Mouthfeel is a bit cloying some residual sweetness and something in the texture makes it tough to swallow, light carbonation doesn't help this body move across the palate any better.

Aromas of sweet apricot, rich honey, subtle spices, and toasted grains. Very sweet, and a bit lopsided nose. Flavors are very tangy and sweet forward. Holy hell, cloying, like an overpowering piece of candy. The honey and apricot clash a bit, with sweet over sweet taking out their frustrations on your palate. Slightly sour, even. Vanilla notes come in, too, and it does not help matters. Yikes. Oily, slick body, with a slightly sharp edge from the carbonation. The aftertaste is very cloying, with a tangy, tart, and slightly sour blending linger. Slick, lingering finish. This one is not good.","GarthDanielson","Nov 03, 2014"

Nose of apricots, sweet malts, and an herbal note I can not put my finger on...most likely cardamom.  Flavors are unique with sweetness to the sides and tartness to the front and back mingling with apricots and vanilla beans as it warms.  The herbal notes are enticing with a sweet tart like candy flavor being rounded out by nice carbonation to make this one very pleasant to say the least.

3.58,11.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/2/2014. Pours slightly hazy bright golden orange color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, apricot, cardamom, honey, bread, vanilla, herbal, grass, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of pale malt, fruit, spices, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, apricot, cardamom, honey, bread, vanilla, herbal, grass, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Fair amount of fruit tartness and earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, apricot, cardamom, honey, bread, vanilla, herbal, grass, light pepper and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and solid balance of pale malt, fruit, spices, and earthy hop flavors; with a solid sweetness/tartness/bitterness balance and minimal cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, moderately crisp, and fairly slick/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very solid and unique spiced blonde ale. Good robustness and solid balance of pale malt, fruit, spices, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A bit off balanced with the spices and fruit with some slight cloying flavors; but quite enjoyable overall.","superspak","Oct 30, 2014"

Flavor reveals a tart and sour base, sweetened slightly by the vanilla that lingers long in the aftertaste. Apricot becomes evident in the tart/sour character, along with candied orange. Reminds me of st Joe's children's vitamins. Honey sweetness emerges mid palate to accompany the vanilla. Cardamom weaves throughout. But, the apricot sourness rules the day.

Taste is very acidic, with a mix of holiday spices (cloves, cardamom?) and fruit (lemon, apple, peach). No hops.  Alcohol masked well.  A pretty unique oddball.","webmanspidey","Oct 16, 2014"

I just expected something more refined from Bell's. A great man once asked, ""Did Venus sweep you off your feet?"" ... and the answer is no. No it didn't.","Alextricity","Beers"

After Mars I came into this with high expectations, and while I appreciate the attempted innovation, I'll be more than satisfied to share my other bottle.","TheDreamingTree","0"

Not that nice. No hops. Medium carbonation. Overall, it's not terrible, just not anything delicious. It's very unique, but it's too acidic and the various flavors don't work together nicely. I'm glad Bell's is being creative, but this is far from their finest. Hope the other planets come out better.","yannimou","Oct 12, 2014"

And like a lot of Short's  beers this seems to be a love it or hate type beer. I don't really care for it, it's not offense, just not a fan of the flavor combination.","PaulyB83","Oct 11, 2014"
