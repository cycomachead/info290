"Pours a hazy gold from the bottle with a substantial fluffy white head. Smells of bread with a touch of citrus and spice. Very bready taste with a bit of lemon and floral notes. The hops come through with a bit of bitterness at the end. Medium mouth with some carbonation. A decently quaffable blonde."

"The beer pours a white bubbly head that dissipates quickly. The beer itself is a clear pale gold. the beer has a very sweet malt smell The smell also has some light bready yeast notes and a light hop profile. There also appears to be toasty notes as well. The taste is similar to the smell but that the hop profile is mulch stronger and more bitter with a lemony hop flavor, light banana yeast notes, Belgian spices and hints of the rye mash. The beer's mouthfeel is light bodied and very little carbonation but smooth and a bit creamy. Leaves refreshing aftertaste. The beer is a decent blond ale."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 4/11/2014. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, cracker, biscuit, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange peel, cracker, biscuit, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, light pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of pale malt and earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and fairly sticky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish as expected of 4.8%. Overall this is a very nice blonde ale style. All around good balance and robustness of pale malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Bells is a brewery with integrity and nothing proves that better than Third Coast Beer: it is a clean, flavourful, well-malted, tastefully hopped ale that has far more character than commercial, industrial brewed beers but is still every bit as approachable and easy-going. Anyone who remotely likes beer should find this a delight."

"O: As a hoppy blonde, this isn't turribly successful. There's way too much hop/malt clash for me. Having said that, this isn't something I'm going to drainpour - it's only kinda crappy instead of godawful. I don't need to have this one again."
""
"O: one dimensional but drinkable, bitterness is refreshing but almost overdone"
""
"This is no ordinary blonde ale, and that's probably why I am enjoying it. Highly hop forward with a complimenting citrus angle of hop and yeast which works nicely."
""
""
""
""
"Third Coast pours a gold color with a large head. There is an offensive aroma that is similar to cat pee. The taste has a cat pee flavoring, with a strong cereal flavor. The taste is very light, and rather offensive. Overall this is an avoidable beer. Not too much good can be said."

"O - true to the style, but I'm not a fan. Ended up dumping half the bottle. Was hoping more from bells, but that's more my high expectations talking (since the beer stayed within the style)"

"O: Overall, this was alright. I mistaked the third coast beer for the third coast ale. My bad. None the less, this is sort of a run of the mill blonde ale, it's probably great for a hot summer barberque but it's cold outside right now and I'm not really feeling it. Still, to each his own, try it if you like lighter ales."
""

"Sometimes I'm lovin' this beer, other times it falls flat. Freshness probably has a great deal to do with it."

"Overall: This is obviously supposed to be an easily drinkable craft beer. Honestly, it is not immensely different from lighter colored lagers (though this is an ale), but does include a good depth of flavor for being 'restricted', in a sense, to the guidelines of a simple style. If this came in cans, it'd be a great, easily drinkable tailgate beer come football season."

"Poured this American Blonde Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a clear yellow color - produced a small white head, average retention and it left some lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of malted wheat, sweet grain- Light in body, there was a base of cereal grain, some hop bitterness. Easy to drink - good summer beer."

"O- this would be great for any outdoor summer day. Very easy to drink but still very quality. I really liked it. Like I said, it's like bud light for craft beer drinkers palates."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a beer for taking out on the lake for a hot afternoon of fishing. Refreshing and it goes down like a champ. Not the most flavorful thing on the planet, but it gets the job done."
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not sure age has ruined it. It's still tasty! Would have again. Super drinkable."

"This is ideal for a hot weather day with its bitter, quenching properties but at times this one can be too harsh; still worth trying."
""
"Epic fail."
""
"Overall: Solid but not great sessionable ale that would work well on a hot day. Typical Bells being very clean. I would not go out of my way for this, but a fine example of the style."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Clear pale gold with a white cap. Aromas of fresh hops, orange slices, grains. Crisp mouthfeel with apparent carbonation. Easy drinking as it should be. Big bitter smack at each sip. I was not expecting that. Bitter, peppery, sweetness is short and fleeting. This was not the refreshing drink I was expecting it to be. This had some harshness to it, that I don't think belongs in this light simple style. When I want some bitterness, I'll reach for a IPA or hoppy PA. With a Blonde, I expect sweet flavors, light crisp feel, and an ease of drinkability. This was not that. Not my cup of tea. Pass."
""
"O-An average boring beer. Nothing off-putting, nothing to write home about."
"Is this unfiltered? Nose has some nice tones to it: citrus hits me at the start but seems to fade fairly soon into things. Carries more spicy hop tone to it than I would have expected. Pretty drinkable, though the hops do take it to a different place than most blondes are at. Not too shabby."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a semi dark yellow with a frothy white head. Smell is grainy, subtle hops, hint of sweet as well. Bitter up front that goes all the way through, it covers some of the flavor at first. After it has a nice malt flavor, the hops is there with some sweetness at the end. The bitterness stays through the aftertaste. A medium mouthfeel, nice and smooth, nice balance after the first few sips, the bitterness doesn't fit well in the beer overall. A good beer, nice flavors, not something I would get all the time, but a good beer nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden yellow with a couple fingers of fluffy white head. Good retention and sticky lace. Nose of grains, cracker, a bit of citrus and yeast. Taste is dry and toasty grains, bitter hopping, light citrus flavour and more yeast character. Medium light feel, a bit drying and moderately bitter finish. A good blonde, but fairly uninteresting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This blonde’s very drinkable with a great nose, but it’s a little too bitter for the style. I could use more sweetness."
""
""
""
"Like it enough. Wouldn't go shopping for it but really glad I had it."
""
""
"Overall a really poor showing from Bells here. I think I see what they're getting at which is an easy drinking beer for the masses. They have succeeded at this but have sacrificed a lot in the process."
""
""
""
""
""
"Translucent golden yellow, with tons of sediment. Nice sticky lacing and a head that lasts. Smells sharp, pungent and bready. Almost meaty? Not much hop character in the nose to speak of. The smell is almost enough to turn you off. The taste is almost the opposite. Slightly sweet, bready and a nice citrus hop bitterness towards the end. As the beer warms, the tastes seem to blend and it gets better. I love when a beer does that. Mouthfeel is light and nicely carbonated. This is a good session beer if you can get past the nose. I think my tastes have changed since college!"
""
""
""
"D - Ok, low abv, not a palate killer. I think this could be a nice session."
"Overall, refreshing and simple but very satisfying. Nice session brew."
"Really good stuff. A tasty, refreshing, balanced and hop-forward blonde ale. Could almost call this a pale ale. Well done."
""
"O - I could easily kill a 6 pack of these during the summer. It's not a mind blowing beer by any means. But, is miles ahead of the BMC light beers."

"O decent malty beer, would try again nothing too special though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Pretty nice offering from bell's"
"Taste is full, hinting at grains (barley, wheat) and just enough of a hop bite to make this a formidable and ideal session ale. Nothing truly outstanding, but overall quite an enjoyable brew."
""
""
"O: Easy drinker. This has too much flavor and character to be a blonde ale. This probably closer to a pale ale."

"O - Light and refreshing."
"O - Definitely enjoyable. Great session beer, but not one I would go looking for."
"Very drinkable. The sweet character I describe does not make the beer too sweet."
"Citrus is the taste with a light bitter aftertaste. Very tasty and a very drinkable, fresh and crispy beer!"
"A great session beer here. Not the most complex flavor profile, but still a very well made beer."
"Pretty good stuff for what it is."
"Overall: A very tasty and interesting brew. It has a surprisingly high hop presence for a lighter bodied beer. Its like a light version of a pale ale. A good option for summer when you want an easy drinking beer with a good hop presence. This bottle was a few weeks past its recommended date yet it still tastes fresh."
"I guess I haven't had many American Blond ales. This one is light enough to drink easily but the flavors aren't great, in my opinion. The first Bell's beer I haven't liked too much."
"D: High. Light crisp and easy to drink"
"O: I was expecting a bit more from Bell's, but I suppose I shouldn't have got my hopes up for a blonde ale."
"Overall - I like this beer better than the sum of its parts. Don't think it would be an every day beer, but it's a tasty change up."
"This is a good session beer. Nice for it's style."
"Overall-Not really want I was hoping for. I have yet to try a Bells beer I haven't liked, until now. Will not seek out this beer again."
"Overall this is a good beer. IBUs aren't that bad, but it does have that hoppy bitterness to it."
"Orange, lacy, hazy, beautiful, but smells grainy with a bit of floral hop--what is an American blonde ale? I'm not sure I've ever had one before. It's basically reminiscent of a light European lager, very crisp, a little bit sweet like a pear, grainy, enough citrus/floral hops to stay interesting but overall soft and clean on the palate. It's a great lager, and so top points from me, but I guess I expect more interest from Bell's."
"Drinkability pretty good. It's a boring beer, but inoffensive."
"This beer is far different than most in the Bell’s portfolio, but I find it to be quite tasty. It is not the best of its kind, but it is an interesting take on an easy drinking lager. I will definitely consider picking this beer up for a summer BBQ."
"Very drinkable and easy to go down."
"Taste is actually pretty decent - a step above any macro American Blonde Ale. Much more dominant malt profile shows up, backed by an even tiny hop bite that makes for quite a refreshing beer. Still feel like the flavour is lacking a bit from age at this point. Also a grainy/grass taste reminiscent of macros. Mouthfeel is light to medium, crisp and dry. Overall, I was a bit let down by the first two categories but the taste made up for it. Obviously quality ingrediants are used for this beer which set it apart from similiarly styled mass produced BMC types. Decent beer with a good sessionable abv."
"O - Not a bad beer, really easy to get down."
"Overall, a good, light beer. This is something that I could see myself sessioning in the right situation."
"Pours a hazy pale yellow. A good amount of head with good retention. Smells light citrus and lemon. a hint of yeast and some slight hints of a sweet malt background. Mostly the lemon and citrus stand out. Very light... the taste is subtle and not exciting. Lemon and yeast, a tough of wheat. Well carbonated but a bit thin. There is some bite to it that hurts the drinkability a bit."
"Simple enjoyable beer. Thrist Quencher. Lawnmover. Summer time. Make it happen."
"Light bodied, plenty of carbonation, and has an unpleasant, bitter aftertaste. It does not seem like this fits any one style very well. I don't care much for this beer."
"Drinkability: I'll have another please... Seriously, at 4.8% and with how light and refreshing this is, a 6er in a night wouldn't be out of the question at all. I wish I had access to this in the summer after a fun day on the river. I know it's not a favorite style because it's not huge, but this beer deserves some praise."
"I found this beer very drinkable/sessonable and would be great for a hot summers day of fishinng."
"Moderately bitter hop bite, lagery feel, though a Blonde Ale. Grainy, grassy, herbal, wet hay, floral notes. Dry finish, lightly bitter. Simple and clean, the focus seems to be on the floral American hops. Drinkable and quenching, though a bit simple and one-note. Lager of the Lakes was more enjoyable to me personally."
"Highly drinkable. Great brew."
"Drinkability: Very easy. Beer all gone in less than 15 minutes, including forcing myself to take breaks"
"Drinkability: A tasty, thirst quenching brew that can be drunk all night long."
"A rather nice beer considering it didn't look like much in the glass."
"Notes: I am happy with this beer that I have seen in stores everywhere around here and finally purchased for purposes of drinking and rating it here today."
"D - This has good drinkability. It is a very easy going beer. Overall, I think this is good, but kind of generic. I could easily drink a lot of these. I think this would be a good beer to have on a nice hot day."
"This is a full pale ale. the taste is full of pale malts. The carbonation is upfront and builds. Crystal malts make an appearance and finishes with slight hop citrus and bitterness."
"D: very sessionable, don't go out of your way for this beer, but worth trying."
"Drinkabilitly - I was pleasantly surprised by this brew. It's really pretty good. Easily drinkable and would be real nice on Spring and Summer days. I'll give this a second go round no problem."
"D: Somewhat sessionable, but not something I'd want more than a pint of."
"D: The beer is rather drinkability, but the lack of complexity really hurt the beer."
"Overall outstanding session ale here. I would not mind throwing back a half dozen of these any day, it just really seems to work quite nicely. Spot on."
"D - I wouldn't really call it 'a truly quaffable beer'. It seems like a step above generic BMC stuff. It just feels watered down. I needs a little balancing pale/pils malt to sweeten it up just a touch and give it a little more body. Not bad, but not something I'd reach for again."
"It's a very ""clean"" beer....pretty drinkable as well. It isn't going to ""wow"" many people but if this is meant to be a refreshing beer, particularly for hot weather, I'd say it's a fine choice."
"O: Versatile, but not overly interesting."
"Pours a pale honey color with a two finger white head and a bit of lacing. Nose consists of slightly sweet dough and hints of light floral and citrus notes. Taste is the same with a grain and bread interplay. Somewhat grassy. Mouthfeel is nice with good carbonation and a heavy enough body. Drinks fairly well and would be a solid introductory beer."
"This is why I like mixed sixers. It pours a clear lemonade with a bunch o' particulate matter floatin' about in there. A nice finger of steadfast white froth sits on top. The nose comprises lemon zest, mandarin orange flesh, flowers, and a tiny hint o' funky sour. The taste is similar, though the lemon brings some of its rind along for the ride, creating some extra bitterness toward the end. The body is light, with a light carbonation and a rather smooth feel. Overall, an okay brew, but nothing I would necessarily aim at getting again."
"I poured into a pint glass to an inch of white head that was gone in no time. This beer is yellow in color and has suspended yeast particles in it. The aroma is sweet bready malt. The taste is sweet malt and is replaced by a metallic bitterness. It reminds me of a European beer. The mouthfeel is medium and has a slight grittiness to it. This is not my favorite style so the drinkability will take a hit."
"MF&D - quite carbonated, and easy to drink. the only problem is that one could do it for a lot cheaper with a big block of pbr."
"Drinkability: I view this as an all around good beer, but, I can't see myself having more than one in a sitting by itself. This is really a beer to have with a meal. That crispness and bitter finish suggests something best paired with a meal...I don't know what yet, but something to counteract another strong flavor. Fish maybe? Again, good beer, but even with it's nice ABV I can't see this as sessionable for me anyway."
"On the whole, this almost seems like a light ipa to me. Batch 9722."
"I don't know what to tell you....something about this beer is amiss. Clear golden color, with what I thought was carbonation bubbles, but 5 min. or so later and it was just suspended floaties, is this beer bottle conditioned? ""A golden beer brewed with pale malts. Large American hop additions contribute a crisp refreshing bitterness. A tribute to the Great Lakes, T.C.B. is a truly quaffable beer"". Or so the brewery says .I'm not so sure, maybe I got a bad bottle. Bells is 1 of my top 5 breweries in America, this is not what I see in the reviews or the beer. I will try again another time, and review."
"D - Great BBQ/Lawnmower beer, exactly what I look for on a hot day. Touch too expensive, won't necessarily keep it stocked at all times, but a nice treat."
"D- Easy beer to drink, would be nice to have a few but the price is a little high in my opinion, extra points for having one of the most original labels in Michigan"
"Pleasant, easy drinking beer. Nothing extraordinary but a good, solid brew."
"D: Even with the metal taste, its a decent drinker."
"The taste is better. The American hops bring a nice, drying bitterness forth. Piney and an unsuprising touch of yeast, being that it's floating around everywhere like fish food in the glass. A little heavy on the carbonation, but it makes for a solid BBQ beer."
"Poured into a pint glass, left a half finger white head with minimal lacing. Lots of suspended yeast sediment which I like. Beautiful floral scent with lots of American hops. Very crisp and bitter taste, little biscuit in the malt. This makes me think of an American ESB. Very nice and drinkable, I may try to brew something like this!"
"Drinkability, easy to drink, but at 10$ a 6er, ugh. Half a point extra for the awesome label."
"Drinkability: Light, easy drinking but not really worth returning to, especially because of the lingering aftertaste."
"A light, snappy beer. I'd recommend it wholeheartedly over anything from a major brewery any day."
"Pours a light yellow, not too translucent though. Head was white and fluffy. Armoa had a mix of lightly sweet malts. Taste was slightly sweet and grainy. Bitterness of the hops was there as well. Not too thick or thin. Decent beer that I had with my salmon burger."
"T-"
"D/Overall - Refreshing, crisp and light. Being that Bell's is popping up in grocery stores and gas stations more and more, I'd definitely pick this up over most other brews you'd find in those locations. I'd pass this up while at a specialty store however."
"Very drinkable. Third Coast Beer will become a regular in my fridge and I will attempt to convert my BMC friends with this. TCB should get more love, quite surprised that there was only 240 reviews."
"Overall this is a good brew, light and refreshing. Unoffensive flavors and nice low ABV, great session brew."
"F: Finishes pretty dry and semi bitter. Almost like raping my tongue with it. Some fruity flavors seems to stick to the sides of my mouth and keep some juicy flavors coming. It has quite a bit of bitterness, but lacks much hop flavor, but it's called a blonde ale and not a pale so I guess it doesn't need much for hop flavors, but also might be a little to pale IMO. It's still a nice beer though."
"A good, lagerish beer. I enjoyed the salty taste."
"The 3rd Coast Beer pours a golden straw color with a minimal, 1 finger head. Lots of sediment slowly settles to the bottom of the glass. Smell is sweet and citrusy. Hints of lemons, limes, and grassy field greens. Taste is not nearly as sweet as the nose but has a nice bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is thin and crisp. Drinkability is pretty high. Low ABV and refreshing on a warm day."
"A surprising amount of flavor in this Blonde Ale. malt is full of grainy biscuit charater. Floral hops have a solid presence, and the peppery, yeasty quality was completely unexpected."
"Drinkability: Even with its lively effervescence, it displays a substantial body that a lager of comparable composition never could. All in all, a pleasant, easily drinkable light ale, though the closest I've been to the Third Coast, is a trip up or two to up to Three Floyds for Dark Lord Day."
"Poured in a Sam Adams perfect pint. Appearance is a cloudy haze with some debris floating around. Smells a little hoppy and yeasty. Taste some pleasent bitterness from the hopiness. Light bodied feel, grity. Could drink a few more of these but not likly."
"This beer pours a pale yellow color wtih a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is nice, with a spicey slightly sweet hop over a semi-orange seet malt. The flavor is nice as well. The hop is not something I can place, but I really like the crisp spiceyness it brings. There is a slight orangey sweetness. I like it. The feel is moderate with a lively carbonation. This is a very exciting, I really really do like it."
"Bell's lives up to their reputation with this brew. I'm looking forward to checking out the rest of this case now."
"A step above the BMCs, but not by much. Poured a clear golden yellow with little head or lacing, a nose that was slightly grainy-slightly fruity and a thin body. Taste was slightly fruit, but mostly bland. Finish slightly on the watery side. Not much of an offering from Bells."
"MF&D - quite carbonated, and easy to drink. the only problem is that one could do it for a lot cheaper with a big block of pbr."
"D- Seems like a good beer for summer. Perhaps a little too bitter."
"Drinkability- Fantastic"
"Body and drinkability were both typical for the style. There are times when a nice, smooth, quaffable blonde is the beer you're in the mood for, and this would be a good choice. If it were regularly available to me, it would be in my regular rotation. Worth trying, and worth having a friend bring back from vacation."
"D: Easy peasy."
"This beer pours a deep straw yellow with ample amount of sediment floating around in this brew. A one finger of bubbly white head caps the beer, receding rapidly leaving no lacing to speak of. Nose is mostly of grains and malt with only a hint of floral hops to it. Taste is grainy up front with touch of breadiness and malt in the middle, and the finish is of grassy and floral hops. Light to medium body, medium carbonation, very crisp and smooth, goes down easily. This is a highly sessionable beer."
"Overall, a very light beer. I could easily drink a few of these in a sitting. Nothing I would go out of my way for, as it just doesn't have to much flavor going on. Not bad for a summer day."
"D: Not for me, but I could see some liking this as a good session beer."
"Not bad for the style, I think most here are voting against the style rather than the beer. Pours a hazy golden with a thin white head. Aromas of bitter, earthy, piney hops and lager yeast. Don't get me wrong, the hops are relatively light, but far more noticeable than usual for the style. Similar as the far as the taste goes, a quick hit of bitter hops, refreshing, then a slightly stale taste of lager yeast takes over. Crisp, but a bit too strong on the yeast front- it kinda lingers in the mouth."
"D: Easy to drink, but not all that appealing to kick back with either considering the gamut of better beers to do so."
"Taste reflects the nose. Semi-dry, crisp and refreshing. Mouth carbonation is average with light sweetness on the finish. This is a simple beer with a nice, crisp character, mild and enjoyable."
"D- Light body makes it an easy drink, but I would tend to reach for others, probably. Not a bad brew at all, just not mind-blowing. For the style, however, it's got more flavor than most."
"This is a good unfiltered brew with pretty solid flavor, though some may find it to be both uncomplicated and a bit light. I enjoyed it well enough."
"Cheers."
"Pours a weak golden/green clear with hundreds of unidentified particles floating all around. Moderate white head mostly diminishes. Aroma of corn, grain, adjunct smell that is unappealing. Do I have the High Life with floating pebbles? Natural Light? The Beast? Aroma is no appealing whatsoever. Taste - bitter and not as bad as the aroma, but still nothing pleasant. Pale grains, slight lemon taste, just not what I expect from Bells. I really, really tried to be an advocate on this one, giving it a 2nd pour, but just cannot rate this any higher."
"Thin pure white head, barely lasts a few seconds before dissolving into islands across the surface, no lacing at all. Hazy enough to induce a decent translucency to the orange-yellow color, this haze prevents much hue loss at the rims. Orange and lemon citrus break into your nostrils first, bready in a semi-uncooked manner, somewhat earthy more so than floral, not many fruit scents nor malt sweetness, overall just trails off on you as if in mid-sentence. Medium-bodied, holds its weight consistently throughout and the carbonation plays an able supporting role. There's some sort of pickled or saline bitterness to it, doesn't seem directly attributable to the grass, straw, sourdough bread flavors. No malt rescue unit on the scene. The citrus element is mixed and without a clear character. Comes across as ""beer"" albeit crafted beer, wish the whole was more than the sum of the parts."
"The first, and hopefully only, Bell's beer I have no desire to have again."
"D: Dangerously sessionable."
"mid body. good carbonation. i like this beer. could do session with this."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Light body with light carbonation and a dry finish."
"Drinkability is high. Easily sessionable with such low ABV, and the flavor profile is simple but pleasing. Not a bad beer at all."
"Bell's Third Coast Beer is an okay beer. I was almost certain that I'd reviewed this beer before, but found that I had confused it with Third Coast Old Ale. That's a different animal. I prefer Third Coast Old Ale. Third Coast beer is merely above average. Perhaps this is a style for which it's tough to create a standout. That might be the case here. I'll have to explore the style more to have a more informed opinion. As it is, Third Coast Beer is okay. Not a great deal better than that."
"D: Definitely a drinkable beer, but I've had better from Bells. Nonetheless, I could see drinking this in the heart of summer while grilling outside!"
"D - This is a very off-centered brew that seems too strange to really enjoy. Not bad by any means, but I'd pass on a second one."
"A nice beer but not terribly interesting. The beer is a hazy pale golden color with an okay head. (Quick edit: the beer is apparently bottle-conditioned and once the yeast settles out, it seems to clear up some, unsurprisingly) The nose doesn't exactly blow me away, but there's nothing offensive about it and I can imagine a bit more hop aroma from a very fresh bottle, not that this one is old. The nose has a bit of spicy, earthy, mineral hops against a backdrop of pale malt. The flavor is similar with a bit of grassiness coming in and touches of lemon and corn. The whole thing seems like a European lager. I recently had a nice German Pilsener, and Third Coast Beer is bringing that back to mind readily. I would love to try this beer on tap at the brewery or within a few weeks of bottling because the flavors on these light, fresh beers can be fickle. A big thanks to deliriumfest for the trade."
"D: A very easy beer to drink which makes this beer a decent session beer."
"The beer is pretty clear, with a slight bit of cloudiness. Looks good with its one inch fluffy head. The pale straw colour makes the beer look like it's a pilsner of some sort. The nose smells of malt, but you really have to strain to smell them. The flavour is mostly maltiness but really smooth. There is a bitterness to the beer, but it's quite subdued. The hops come through at the end, and they are slightly grassy. There is a sweetness in the beer that comes through after the beer warms up, which gives it a pleasant aftertaste. The mouth feel is quite light, but this helps the drinkability. The drinkability is what you'd except for this beer. Another great beer from Bell's."
"Very pleasant overall if you enjoy a light, bitter beer to sip. Personally, I find it a bit too subdued... it reminds of how awesome a full-on Tripel could be, without quite going there itself."
"D-OK. A fine sesion beer, but relatively normal. But regardless of its normal flavor, it's a well-made beer and quite appealing."
"This was quite a surprise, from the opening aroma blast to the final sip--not because it was delicious, but rather because this was one beer that one could not judge by its cover, so to speak. Delicious, subtly complex, and one that has a fixed position on my beer radar. Thank goodness Bell's in back in Central Illinois. Third Coast is very good stuff."
"Taste: Floral, pale malts, fair bit of spiciness and hop bitterness in the finish. Bitter citrus rind flavor stays on the palate for quite a while."
"Pours a clear pale yellow. There is a lot of suspended yeast. 1/4 inch head with slight lacing and slight retention. Smells of hops, sweet malt, and some slight fruit. Fits the style of an American Blodne Ale. There is a smooth and crisp mouth feel with a high carbonation level. Tastes strongly of hops, sweet malt background, slight fruit, and an associated dryness of the palate."
"I enjoyed this one more than I expected since I am not a fan of this style of beer."
"d- perhaps not the most drinkable beer. one is filling, and two is a meal, and the flavor is a bit heady. i would definitely buy this again, but get something a bit smoother too."
"Not a bad beer, though I think Reissdorf has the edge as it comes out a bit smoother in the end. This one looks a little better and has some healthier looking lacing, but then again, looks aren't everything."
"D: I guess I'm usually not a fan of blonde ales. For a blonde though, it is slightly below average for what I've had. Went okay, however, with Indian food."
"Poured into pint glass. Pours deep golden with a half finger of head. Smells citrus, lemony. Taste is smooth a little bitter but hop bitter not sour. Good mouthfeel. Very drinkable. My first bells beer and although I'm not a huge fan of this style, a solid example."
"This beer has a nice bronze color with a gold hue. There is some sediment to the body but it is not too bad. It has a golden white head and lace. There is plenty of frothy uneven head and a lot of lace. It has a hoppy citric aroma. The taste is also well hopped and citric with some fruit like sweetness. The aftertaste is a little sour but mainly cereal and grainy. The mouthfeel is fizzy and slick. Overall it is a different beer but good."
"Pour is a nice light golden color,with a serious white head. Aroma of citrus and floral hops with a touch of spice.Light bodied, smooth malt background,with a lemony hop sort of finish.Very easy mouthfeel,like you could dirnk many of these today I thought this offering to be quite good. Thank you Mr Bell"
"The taste matches up pretty well. Much more interesting than I would expect out of a blonde ale. Nicely balanced too. Definitely more of a summer beer, but not bad here in the middle of December either."
"With it being about 20 degrees tonight I can't help feeling this would be much better in the summertime. Pretty decent flavor overall, and better than I was expecting. Actually had a pretty nice hop bite to it."
"Overall, I think this falls somewhere between a mild blonde ale and an aggressive IPA, but it's pretty solid regardless. I'd definitely kick back with some BBQ and a couple of these."
"This beer has a great texture, rich unattenuated (but not oily) full feel. I could drink this all day and at 4.8% ABV I just might!"
"D: It is a bit too bitter without enough blasting citrus hops for me; a good beer but not the best in bell's catalog."
"This one poured a cloudy golden with almost no head. It had quite a bit of yeast in suspensin. It smells mainly malty but there are some hops in here. The taste is pretty good--crisp, medium-bodied, with some solid flavor. Some bitter hops at the end provide a good finish. I say this is another solid brew by Bell's."
"D: Low alcohol makes this fairly drinkable on one hand, but the bitterness combined with the higher carbonation make it tough to drink a lot on the other."
"D - Decent session beer. Clean, refreshing and eminently drinkable."
"D: I drink Bell's other brands pretty frequently, and I think this wouldn't make many people's regular rotation. For a quality craft brew, it's very drinkable and tasty, but not distinctive."
"D: The ale is approachable, loaded with hops but with a pleasant edge. I could spend my day at the beach drinking this."
"Pours a goldish/ yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, small grapefruity hop, and a grainy malt. In the taste, buscuity malt and small grapefruity hops. A small bitter and medium mouthfeel, and a dry, small hop aftertaste. Nice balance, kind of standard pale, with a touch bigger hops."
"A bit too strong for a blonde ale. Drinkabilty is difficult and it's also possible that this beer was mis-categorized. It tastes more like a base IPA than a blonde ale. It's not bad but I wouldn't even classify it as a blonde ale."
"D - this was okay. It had a weird balance that didn't seem to work very well. It definitely got better as it warmed though."
"Third Coast Beer ain't bad, but seems to have a bit too much peppery spiciness for my enjoyment. Wouldn't mind trying it again, but there are many other beers higher on that list."
"D- really nothing special here. glad i went for the single bottle and not any more as i doubt id want to try it again."
"Overall impression: A straight forward, balanced, approachable blonde ale. Good crossover beer."
"D--Certainly goes down smooth and easy. Low ABV. This is a summer refresher, but I'd advise you to come thirsty and drink it cold."
"Light mouthfeel, probably leaning toward medium giving the crowd it runs with in the blonde ale style. Very clean, drinkable, and hop-driven take on a classically summer style."
"I liked this beer, and think it would be a good session beer, but probably only for one session. For Bell's it's not nearly enough of a stand-out. This, rather, is the lowest-key of any of Bell's offerings, and I suspect that is why its ratings are low. A solid, easy to drink beer--all the terminology used for domestic macros but for real. Worth trying."
"D- Fairly easy to drink just not a lot going on here."
"12oz bottle. Pours a light golden orange color with a solid looking head. The aroma is sweet malt with some spices, hints of citrus and spicy hops, very nice and interesting nose. The taste is light pale malt with a surprisingly amount of spicy hops in the finish. Overall, Bell's Third Coast is another solid beer from Bell's that I wish was distributed down here with most of the other Bell's brews that are available. Recommended."
"Golden. Mildly aromatic, slightly tart, with notes of vanilla, orange creamsicle, lemon and pilsner malts. When I was drinking this I wasn't sure if this was a lager or an ale. The malts are grainy, unexciting, and have notes of corn and butter. The hops are herbal and earthy, with notes of lemons, herbs and cream."
"Pours a hazy soft golden straw color with a decent white head fed by good carbonation. Smells of subtle hops (spicy, earthy), slight light malts, and lemon peel. Taste leans toward the lemon citrusy side with the spicy hops bringing up the rear. Pretty well balanced, light mouth feel. A good take on a Blonde Ale"
"mouthfeel is crisp carbonation, bitter, very sessionable, still hasn't lost charecter despite age."
"Malty aroma, and malty backbone in the quaff - but with a packed hop punch in the finish. This is on the edge of a pale ale style, I think a bit too sharp and tangy for a blonde ale - but never-the-less a tasty treat if you're into the hop ride."
"D-Has more hoppy character than the style description would indicate, but I really enjoyed this one. Very drinkable."
"I love Bell's, but this is not one of their best. It is like a lager w/ ale hoppiness, however they just didn't blend well. It is light like I wanted, but not very drinkable due to the harsh hops and skunkiness. Maybe I got a bad batch (couldn't test the date as the website was down), but this is my 4th beer from the six pack and they have all been consistently dull. I don't think I'll pick this up again, however I would like to try it on tap to see if the experience differs."
"D- I don't really know what to say, this makes a great warm weather beer and would be a kick ass session brew."
"drinkabliity is decent. if the brew was a bit sweeter and had a bit less CO2 in it, this could be a solid brew, but it falls short in a few areas."
"Drinkability: A bit hoppy for a blonde, but at 4.8%, a sessionable brew."
"This beer pours cloudy blonde color with a lot of visible yeast floating around. The aroma has some mild caramel notes, but is mostly of sweet bread. The taste is of pine resin, with a lingering bitterness in the finish. The hop profile is firm without being overpowering. This is a very bitter beer for a blonde ale. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice blone ale. It has character, which is something most blondes lack. I'm not a huge fan of this style, but I can surely see myself drinking this beer again on a hot summer day."
"a clear straw/pale gold in color, creamy snow white head and lacing. grassy, vegetal hops dominate the nose along with biscuity malts. smells like a good pilsener. taste is lightly sweet malts and a smooth, moderate hop bitterness. light-bodied, with a crisp, effervescent carbonation. a good summer beer."
"Drinks pretty easy, blonde with a tinge of wit to it"
"Thanks to MuenchnerKindl for the sample."
"Very easy to drink could down a six of these easily"
"D-This is a very easy drinking beer(good for a game or two)Good session beer."
"D = I rate this slightly above average only because the hops do make it interesting. It is low enough ABV to session and would be better than your average American lager for that purpose, but I am not sure I would seek it out just to have one, though maybe it would be good on a hot day after being outside for awhile."
"Overall- It's a really nice beer on the lighter end of the spectrum."
"Kind of pale, hazy, and yellowy. Nice dense white head. No huge presence of aromas. Maybe some hoppy characteristics. The flavor indicates more of a presence of hops. It's got the bitter ale flavor with a minute amount of citrus. Not too overpowering, but then again, it's not an IPA. Pretty smooth and easy to drink."
"D - This beer is ok. It has a descent amount of hops. It doesn't really stand out as anything special."
"I think this beer is very drinkable, and satisfies a number of different personal cravings due to its complexity. The carbonation, overall taste, and particularly the aftertaste are very palatable in my opinion."
"d: A sessionable brew thanks to a light flavor and mouthfeel. Its enjoyable, but nothing special. Bells has set the bar pretty damn high, this beer is one of their weaker offerings."
"D - Pretty good, taste profile is a bit odd, but it is quite drinkable. Sessionable, and definitely worth a try, but this is probably my least favorite offering from Bell's."
"The drinkability is good. Not a great style, but a fine brew for it. MK"
"Cloudy gold with a one inch head. Plenty of visible carbonation and good retention and lacing. Aroma is not interesting , smells like American hops. I dont have the ability to detect micro-aromas so I asked my bloodhound wife. She said all she smells is hops. It has an interesting bitter flavor and good mouthfeel with plenty of carbonation. Another reviewer referred to light prickly carbonation, that describes it perfectly. I enjoyed this beer and would drink it again."
"D: Not a style that really wows me but was a good brew nonetheless. Easily drinkable."
"Thanks to kryptic for the taste."
"Pours a light golden color with light carbonation and a thin lace of head. The bottle had some floaties in it also. Smell is sweet with some fruitiness to it. Taste is almost identical to the flavor just a light more pronounced. Mouthfeel is smooth, but has a bitterness that seems to linger in the back of the throat. Normally I don't care for bitter aftertaste, but being a blonde ale it's quite pleasing. This is the first time reviewing this beer, but second time having it. If it wasn't for the floaties this would be an excellent beer all around. This still is an good beer that is one of the better blonde ales I've had."
"Batch 8106. Light orange hue with a thin white head that disappaited leaving a faint ring, very lazy carbonation. Not quite clear, more hazy, transluscent. Smells of tangerine, pomegranite, hops. Lively hopped taste and mouthfeel, thin body, some sharpness in the finish. A swirl produces some fizziness and the modest ring and lacing persists. Aftertaste is bitter and dry. Overall, quite enjoyable, like all Bell's products that I've sampled recently."
"What a great session beer! I haven't figured out whether they use ale or lager yeast for this one, but it definately has a clean finish. The hop aroma and flavor are right on for this style. Did I detect a bit of Munich malt? Anyhow, this is a highly drinkable and straightforward brew."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't turn one down... but there are many other American Blondes that I would prefer."
"There is not much taste up front. Get the hop bitterness after swallowing. Not too impressive. It is light bodied like you would expect and carbonated very well."
"Drinkability: Very refreshing, very drinkable. Good beer for the summer."
"I've seen Third Coast Beer any number of times during trips back to Ohio, but it has always been past its prime. That is, old Third Coast ale, not Third Coast Old Ale. This time I got lucky and found a relatively fresh bottle. Why doesn't this stuff get more love?"
"D: I'll giver her a B+"
"Drinkability: Reading through the reviews, it appears that there has been some style drift; clearly not an APA and a blonde ale might be accurate but this could be a lager, too; whatever it is, it is just not my style"
"Eric"
"Drank from a 12 oz. bottle from batch number 7826, bottled on February 15, 2007. Pours a slightly cloudy yellow with a tall, white head. Nice, light flavors and smells of the hops. A little leafy and grassy. Light, crisp mouthfeel. Overall, a nice, clean pale ale. Perfect to drink cold on a summer evening. Another great offering from Bell's."
"standard APA. just not very interesting"
"A very easy-to-drink pale ale from Bell's. It's good but not great."
"I did not know anything about this beer going in, I actually thought it was a lager before the pour. The taste and the haziness and particles in the glass I think this mostly reminds me of an unfiltered Victory Prima Pils. And since Prima Pils is one of my most favorite beers, I really enjoyed this beer."
"Overall, a pleasant pale ale offering from Bell's, more on the refreshing side."
"I must say that I am a bit let down by this offering. I didn't really know what to expect out of it as I hadn't previously read any reviews. It is light, refreshing, and very sessionable but those are pretty much its only highlights. Definitely not the best beer from Bells and one I won't try again unless it's given to me."
"D - Is average because of the carbonation"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Light bodied with high carbonation sums up the body of this brew. Tends to finish dry.This brew is easy to drink and could be something one could drink all night. This one is so-so, nothing to brag about."
"bottle before pouring it out. Extra flavor, you know. I do wonder what a fresh one is like, though."
"Easy to drink, pleasant yet unremarkable beer."
"Well balanced, simple, and easy to drink. Not as crisp as I would like, but good."
"Pours a straw yellow color, just a slight shade of haze, with a puffy, rocky white head. Smells a tad sulphury and very floral; the website claims they add generous portions of ""American hops," but I'm definitely smelling some nice noble hops here. The first sip is cracking crisp and very dry, with a stiff bitterness. Definitely a hop-oriented taste, but not one you'd expect from a pale ale... an intriguing blend of floral and citrusy. The clean bitterness extends well into the aftertaste, washing each sip away nicely. At 5%, dry, and relatively light bodied, Third Coast Beer is like a crazy beer artist's interpretation of lawnmower beer - unique, delicious, and eminently drinkable. Wow."
"Bottle-conditioned T.C.B. pours a hazy golden body beneath a short head of creamy white foam that holds well and leaves sheets of thin lace about the glass. The nose is mainly hoppy with a grassy, floral, and gently citrusy edge over a soft maltiness that's straightforwardly grainy - and the flavor is basically the same. The malt and hop flavors work well together with one supporting the other, and it's nicely balanced by a bold bitterness that leaves it refreshingly raspy-dry in the finish. It lingers... spicy, grassy, bitter... similar to a fresh German lager. It's basic, fresh, hoppy beer as I'd imagine beer was prior to the Volstead act of 1919."
"Overall, a quality beer. You could definitely drink a few of these in a night. I'll get more in the future."
"hazy unfiltered straw-colored liquid with a foamy white head. in the nose, it's grainy with lots of hops. tastes like a lublin hops sandwich on hearty white bread. strong flavors of lager yeast and coarse grain, with an inordinate amount of grassy hops. in writing this, i realize that there aren't words that can make this sound good in print. this sleeper of a beer nails it though, and is sadly overlooked"
"Slightly cloudy off-yellow hue, bubbly carbonation, tiny chunks of yeasty particles. The nose contains earthy notes, malts, day old wheat bread and plenty of yeast. Razor sharp malts, fresh baked bread that is toasted and some tender lemon notes. Crisp and refreshing, medium bodied, bitter and a bit over the top on carbonation. Subdued spicy citrus hops dominate the palate with long, lingering zesty lemon peel flavorings. Solid at best, but mis-classified as an APA. This could pass for a PPA--pilsner pale ale."
"This is definitely in my top 10 beers."
"Very drinkable, sessionable brew. Perfect summer quencher. Also a very approachable beer, should be easy to get some BMC drinkers interested in craft beer with this one. Will look for this again come the dog days of summer."
"Third Coast Beer falls a little flat... it's just missing somthing. And in contrast to what the BA Style currently states, I feel it should be listed as an All Malt Lager rather than an APA... But that qualm aside, this one could easily be replaced with Bell's Lager (Of The Lakes) Beer. My first dissapointment with a Bell's brew, but thats ok! I've got some other Bell's brands to review throughout the weekend."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is very light in color, slightly cloudy and has a huge foamy white head. Smell is of citrusy hops and a sweet with malt. Taste is initially sweet with a bitter following and a totally clean finish. Nice balance, slight aftertaste of grain. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a creamy consistancy. This is a very drinkable beer, goes down smooth and tastes pretty good. Worth trying."
"Drinkable and pertty tasty. This is the lightest beer of any bell's that I have had and is not to bad. Very nice on a hot day or after a round of golf I imagine. Alright brew! Bell's has not dissapointed me yet, but this is the closest they have come!"
"Since I'm not a fan of overly sweet beers, this one worked very well with me. I was expecting a sweet wheat beer that people put orange slices on, and it was nothing like it. I enjoyed it very much, and considering the style, very enjoyable."
"Notes: Oh, how tastes mature. When I first had this, I was so unimpressed, I never thought i'd be back to try it again. Now, I may just get a sixer next time i'm out at the beer store."
"Overall, a decent Pale Ale - pretty different from most APAs. The flavors are OK, and the aftertaste is a bit much."
"I'm not sure if this was really intended to be an APA or not. (Then again still a hell of a lot better than their Pale Ale, IMO). Either way, a nice refreshing brew."
"Really blah stuff, bordering on bad. I definitely won't bother again, and I poured out about half the bottle. Back to the Two Hearted!"
"This is a pretty tasty one. Bell's seems to specialize in making ""big"" beers, and that touch showed through in the other lighter-colored beer I had from them, ""Oberon."" This one is no different - very big taste & flavor. I'd say this is hoppier than your usual APA. Very close to an ipa, really. The mouthfeel is interesting - almost a champagne-like feel. Very lively. Pleasantly bitter aftertaste. I'm suprised this doesnt have a higher overall average score. I'd drink it again."
"A nice two finger head with slow retention to a thick, foa,y head. The steady bubbling complimented the slightly hazy amber, maple colored beer. The aroma was a funky hop with some tainted smelling malts. This beer tasted a little adjuncty to me. Not expected from any Bell's beer."
"this beer looks good, hazy yellow orange with a brief foamy head. the smell is malty and dry, the taste is quite bitter with mellow sweet malty flavors, along with that trademark bell's yeast flavor. good carbonation, drinkable, very strong in all categories. not the most complex, but it seems to marry pilsner and pale ale characteristics with a belgian twist. interesting and tasty. recommended for sessions and to share with friends."
"D- This is a very smooth and light beer and it would be nice to have a bit more flavor or depth in the malt and the hops both. It might be a nice thirst quencher on a hot summer day."
"There is plenty of carbonation and when you finish the bottle, you want another."
"drinkability: pretty strong"
"D - I am very impressed with Third Coast. It would be a good beer to have onhand for get togethers."
"Pours a hazy straw with a fluffy white head that settles down to a thin skim. A fruity, and maybe citrusy nose greets you. Taste is crisp, clean and refreshing. Moderate mouthfeel with a slightly sweet aftertaste. More citrus. Drinkability is pretty darn good. An excellent hot weather beer."
"Overall, not bad. I've had way better American Pales in my life, but it stands up well on it's own."
"Drinkability- Easily a session beer on a hot summer day. Nothing outstanding, but nothing to complain about either."
"Notes: A fine summer beer. I get the feeling that this beer is muted in the bottle. I would be interested in trying it on tap. Something tells me it would be better."
"Drinkability: Not what I was looking for. One was more than enough for me."
"Overall a good golden ale with a no frills approach. I really liked the dryness and texture the hops are responsible for creating. Not a lot of hop flavor, but a ton of hop presence. Some may bash this coming from such a powerhouse brewery, but I'd like to think this is one of the best 'Golden' Pale ales I've had around my neck of the woods."
"Dits ok. Im glad I tried it, but I doubt I would seek it out again."
"Picked this one up in Michigan over the weekend. Thought i was getting Third Coast Old Ale turns out I got Third Coast Beer. Somewhat of a dissapointment. Pours a yellow golden color with tons of floaters. Maybe it needs to sit a little after transporting. Minimal head and no lacing. Smell is malty with a slight earthyness/grassyness. Taste is just kind of bland. I noted some slight butterscotch. Overall just a real dissapointment. Dosn't live up to the Bell's reputation or the others that i've had from there."
"Slàinte!"
"12 oz bottle, poured into an Imperial Pint glass. Color is a hazy golden orange. Ok head, but receeded quickly to almost no lace. Smell is grassy. The first time I drank this was strait from the bottle. I thought it was overly sour and bile-like, and didn't really like it. The taste improves dramatically from a glass, but still very sour. It's like lemon grass. I was warming up to the taste as I went along, but not enough to want to get this again."
"Have had and enjoyed this before both on tap and in bottle, but the last two bottles I have had have been disappointing."
"Final Thought: Another fine Bell's product that is clearly under-rated, but does not taste APA, more like a Golden or a a mix of Pils-Hefe."
"Bottom line: This would be on my regular rotation if it was available to me locally. Solid sessionable brew."
"Slight haze, light golden orange with a wispy, soft-white head. Aroma of light bready malts, Bells yeast, and a crisp hop aroma. Clean, slightly grainy malt. Sharp, citric hops dominate. Lime and grapefruit. Tart, crisp, acidic. Not bad at all. Light to medium bodied. Refreshing carbonation. I continue to be impressed by Bell's. Maybe it's the yeast?"
"12 oz bottle pours a cloudy golden orange with particles of yeast floating through out, aromas of yeasty clove and apricots. Fruity and bready flavors, medium bodied with a very nice creamy mouthfeel, bitter and dry finish. I like this unfiltered lager."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable brew. Perfect for lawn mower beer."
"Poured yellow and slighly cloudy with a very weak head. Smells mainly grassy with a tiny bit of malty sweetness. The taste is pretty much purely bitter with a nearly bile-like aftertaste. I got a small amount of malt up front, but that was about it. Mouthfeel was decent with lots of sharp carbonation. Drinkablity was OK, but I found the hop profile to be all wrong. In truth, I thought I was getting the Third Coast Old Ale, but I grabbed this instead. Oh well."
"Poured not aggressive but not carefully into a Pils glass. A very pale, straw yellow with tons of carbonation bubbles running to the top. Almost little to no head could be found thus almost no lacing. Body is cloudy and looks unfiltered with some floaties. Nose if floral with a touch of lemon zest. Grainy malt with some citrus hop carbonation zing in the back of the tongue. The body is very light and dry. Kinda a tangy finish. I'm sure this would be a good hot weather beer but not my cup of tea."
"Deep mahogany in color and very clear, this beer was topped by a thick tan head that showed good retention. The nose has some bourbon, sherry a little caramel and a mild citrus finish, There is a bit of bread dough or yeast on the finish. The flavor is a nice melding of toffee/caramel sweetness that is accentuated by sherry notes. The citrus dissipates and is just a mild bitterness on the finish. This has the same velvet smooth mouth feel I expect from Larry Bells beers. Nice drinkability."
"One again a good offering from the folks at Kalamazoo Brewing. Keep up the great work."
"Its not at the top of the food chain, but its also not a bad beer at all. Worth a try."
"I won't be getting this beer again."
"Light yellow/gold with lots of sediment swimming around. Small white head leaves a slpotch of film. Very little, slightly breadlike malty smell. Nice and hoppy, potent noble or clone. Crisp with a slight toasty malt underneath. Simple, tasty. My new lager of choice, and I'm not much of a lager fan. Light, crisp, refreshing, this is going to have to be a regular in my fridge!"
"Bottle, served at right temperature with good head, which lasted about two minutes. Looks great, a beautiful, hazy, light golden beauty. But smells musty, earthy and/or yeasty. Not really a very good smell at all. But it tastes lovely. The earthy smell transfers much better to the palate, and there are definite citris tones too. A little bitter, not at the start, but grows to the end, and does so very nicely. A solid beer all the way through the mouth and down. Too bad the smell isn't so great. All in all, a solid beer, and I'd sit down with this beer all night."
"I think it taste pretty much how it smells, floral with hints of citrus. Drinks like a medium bodied lager. I can drink several in one sitting."
"Pours a slightly cloudy yellow, big white head forms with lots of sticky lace on the glass. Smell is citrus, some floral hops, oranges, malt. Taste is citrus, light malts, floral hops, grapefruit with a clean bitter finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, medium carbonation, citrus acidity, crisp and refreshing. Very enjoyable beer. Thanks DrJay!"
"Cloudy straw yellow with a bright white head. Although it thins out quickly, it leaves quite a bit of lacing on the glass. Floral hop aroma is strong enough to be considered perfumy, and there's a hint of hop spice in there as well. The same hop character carries into the flavour, but there's a mild maltiness and strong (but balanced) bitterness that fill things out. The bitterness becomes more dominant in the finish, but not to the point of destroying the balance. Floral hops really linger for a long time. Light body, drying finish with a bit of grainy astringency. A good lager with more hop character than I expected."
"The body is nice considering style. A good malt backing that lingers into the body gives it a bit more omph. Some slickness but the yeast is just too much of a distraction. Hard to hide some of those flavors in such a light beer."
"Bronze with a touch of rust. Tiny flecks of sediment suspend in the last bit of beer in the glass. Hops profile made me think of a a lighter version of the Two Hearted Ale. Overall, seems a little unrefined and rough around the edges, but it is nonetheless an enjoyable beer."
"It's a good experiment. An all malt lager makes for a darker than most lager, unfiltered and has floaties in it. Has a grainy sweetness with some vegetol and apple-like notes. Very earthy, yeasty, and dirt-like (that actually sounds worse that it tastes.) flavors. Over-ripened fruit tones show through the malt. Falls a bit bland into the finish and becomes not too interesting. Most flavors are muted and strangely contaminated."
"Drinkability is average, but this is borderline offensive for a supposedly in-offensive style."
"Relatively cloudy gold even with a very careful pour. Head doesn't hold up too long. Smell is nice. Flowery, grassy hops and some biscuity bready malt. Taste is more of the same. Not quite as clean of a taste as I expect from a lager, a little muddled. But this example is 8 months old so that might be affecting it. Other than that the flavor was excellent though and the mouthfeel is nice and crisp. Bitter aftertaste is done just right as well, with some strong spiciness on the finish. Good example of the style."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, crisp and refreshing. Perfect carbonation as it flows down the gullet. A wonderfully drinkable lager that could easily stand up to hot weather. The hop presence really adds to my enjoyment of this one. A great one to keep around in the warmer months."
"This one pours a beautiful golden color with a white head. I had some mild lacing going on. The aroma is good, smells of pale malt and hops. It has a light malt taste with a nice bitterness from the hop addition. The mouthfeel was nice, medium carbonation. I think this is a good drinkable beer. I wouldn't expect anything but greatness from the K-zoo brewing co. Keep up the good work guys. I like the Mackinac straights label now on the bottles. Mackinac Island is a great place to enjoy some good beer. Hope to see them their at the Oktoberfest again."
"poured a nice golden color with a nice white head and some decent lacing. aroma, citrus like grapefruit and a hoppy nose. looked like sea monkeys floating around in my glass. flavor citrus and hops,did not care for this one. do not think I will try this beer for some time."
"Nice medium mouthfeel on this very sessionable brew."
"Am I the only one who bought this beer thinking he was buying the Third Coast Old Ale? When I opened up the first of the sixer, it took one sniff for me to know this is no old ale. This beer has a clear golden color with lots of bubbles coming up. Crisp grainy, malt aroma. The flavor is a pilsner like malt profile, but with more yeast flavor. Some spicy hops too. More flavorful than most beers of this type, but it's not a flavor I particularly enjoy. Not a terrible beer, just somewhat disappointing."
"Pricks."
"This beer pours a pale yellow color wtih a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is nice, with a spicey slightly sweet hop over a semi-orange seet malt. The flavor is nice as well. The hop is not something I can place, but I really like the crisp spiceyness it brings. There is a slight orangey sweetness. I like it. The feel is moderate with a lively carbonation. This is a very exciting APA for me. I really really do like it."
"I enjoyed 2 bottles of this light ale over dinner. Poured light straw in color, very clear, untill the final pour which added sediment and haze. Grainy hop nose, white head which left alot of lacing. This is a crisp, quite bitter brew. Citric/lemony in the middle and more sharply bitter in the finish. Refreshing and tasty. Decent everyday brew."
"This one is a good looking hazy yellow with a very frothy white head and a veritable army of floaties invading my glass. Unfortunately for this one, all it has are it's looks. The nose is very subtle and easy to miss. The taste is much like the nose, only more pronounced. A little oily and citrusy. Hops are the predominant flavor though not overdone. This beer would probably be o.k. if served pretty cold on a hot summer day. A decent lawnmower beer. Very underwhelming"
"This guy is a light, hazy straw color, some floaters roaming around in the beer. Tiny white head on the top. Lemony scent, tones that seem similar to a wit to me. Light grain malt front, lemony zest, some bittering hops. Slight soap taste. Im not too impressed with this one, it seemed to have some wheat characteristics, but the other reviewers dont seem to have noticed that, so maybe mine was off."
"This review is from a 12oz bottle sampled on 12-19-04. Cloudy straw yellow in the glass with a small white topping of bubbles. Not much lace and the puny head disappears quickly. Aroma has a touch of hops over a funky odd smell, not really sure what it is but it didnt give me high hopes for the flavor. Taste had the same funky flavors to it with a bit of hops through in to control it. Fairly light mouthfeel but crisp. Not exactly something I would drink again. I am not sure what the hell is going on with this beer but I will avoid it in the future. Thanks to clvand0 for the sample."
" Drinkability is average not something I would want to try again after the other Bell's stuff I have had latley this is a dissapointment, or a missed styled beer may be a better description, if style was adjunct lager would be rated much higher. Thanks go to merlin48 for the sample."
"Not high on my list of American pale ales and IPAs, though this seems like a good beer to use to introduce non-craft brew drinkers into the field. Affordability is also a plus."
"This beer is really not for me. A little thin, and the pine hops isn't balanced very well."
"Thinner in body, this brew was crisp at the start and had a clean, refreshing dry finish. A decent drinking brew, just the flavor seemed a little tame for the style."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" bright white head above slightly cloudy bright straw brew. Head laces well. Aroma is an earthy, sort of hoppy veggie scent. Not too wild about that. The aroma carries over a bit into the flavor, although the hops add a nice crispness. Mouthfeel and drinkability are reasonably good. If we could just get rid of the off flavor/taste I perceive, we'd have another great lawnmower brew for the summer fridge..."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is great! It has a nice malty scent with a fruity yeast finish and some floral hop notes. The taste is good. It has a light pale malt flavor with a crisp, slightly bitter finish. It goes down smooth with excellent mouthfeel. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great American pale ale. It has awesome aroma and mouthfeel along with pretty damn good flavor ; a good drinker."
"Pours a cloudy pale gold color with a fluffly white head that leaves a slight lace. Aroams are of bready and biscuity malts and a slight hop presence. Flavors are initially malty with bread and nutty flavors kicking in. This flavors are quickly overwhelmed by a zesty citrus hop that dominates the finish of this beer. There's also a bit of spice to this beer along with a refreshing carbonation that leaves the mouth tinglin a bit. Overall this beer is fairly light bodied, has some interesting flavors to it, but it just doesn't all come together."
"I was not very impressed with this particular selection. Although supposedly a pale ale, it did not really look or taste like one to me. First, I was a little frightened by the appearance - a myriad flecks of yeast (I suppose) were floating about in my glass. It pours a pale yellow color, several shades paler than what I am used to seeing from pale ales. The smell was almost acidic and chemical-like. The taste was only slightly better. I hope that perhaps I just got a bad bottle - I was not expecting something of this quality coming from the same brewers that bring us the divine Two-Hearted Ale."
"Picked up the Bell's Sampler last night, what a deal includes 4 of each the Two Hearted, Pale, Porter, K-zoo Stout, Amber, and the Third Coast beer. Anyway I think that's a Pittsburgh thing that they package especially for Tony Knipling of Vecenie's. Appearance: Cloudy, white cranberry with an orangish yellow haze over it. Forms a nice white fluffy head with the yeast visible in the final pour leaves some evenly strung lacing. Aroma: Candi sweetness sugar tone wrapped in hop bitterness yeast character gives this brew the characteristic ringwood spiced breadiness, yum. Taste: Upfront bitterness not much balance touch of sweetness is there but mainly a dry mix of biscuit malts and spicy hops. Mouthfeel: Medium body loads of yeast suspension easy carbonation. Drinkability: Nothing great leaves a lasting bitterness on the tongue, but still pretty drinkable."
"Drinkability: Nice. The label states that they made this to be a refreshing and quaffable ale. In that sense, they succeeded. Not outstanding, but simply a nice session beer."
"Pours a hazy yellow. Dense, fluffy, white head dissipates quickly leaving some lacework along the sides of the glass. The first sniff has a slight whiff of grassy hops. Maltiness is crisp, body is light, the finish is dry with a big smack of bitterness. A bit of spicy hops in the middle but the very light malty start and bitter finish pretty defines this beer. An excellent light ale for hopheads. This is a simple beer. I wouldn't be shocked if only one malt was used in making this brew. The very dry, bitter finish makes me want more of this stuff."
"Hazy gold color. You can clearly see yeast suspended in the glass. Smells lightly of floral hops and sweetness. Taste is very well hopped. I would say that this could almot be classified as an IPA from it's hop bitterness. Another very solid offering from Bell's."
"Pours a slightly hazy light gold with a persistent white head that leaves sheets of lace. Aroma is a mixture of bread and toasted malt notes, and some earthy and citrusy hops. Flavor begins slightly malty, some toasted cracker and yeast, with a large hop presence... earthy and citric hops add a lingering bitterness that is quite nice. Body is light and carbonation is medium, making this a very nice session ale for hopheads!"
"But I like it. Earthy hop backed by just enough malt to allow quick draining and a definite summer boating type beer. Aromas of a high school gymnasium filled with people eating granola and pounding shots of wheat grass. Clean it up a bit and replace that grapefruity finish with something slightly less cheeky and I would be only happy to drink a bunch."
"This beer poured a hazy, fizzy, yellow color (good persistent fine bubbles) with tall, creamy, white white foam that persited and clung to give lace. The smell was somewhat citrusy and malty with notes of grain and bread and a faint whiff of sulfur. The taste was dominated by the bitter and somewhat soapy hops, almost lager-like. The malt was there but not enough to balance the hops. The mouthfeel was smooth but hoppy and a bit tangy. The body was medium and the carbonation good. The hoppy taste lingered. This was a decent beer, but a little thin on flavor and low on malt balance."
"Mouthfeel has at least got some body, and I can't knock the drinkability much, but overall this is a pretty average brew."
"Hand it to Bell's on another great brew. The head on this was bigger than an elephant and there was a perfect citrus and hop aroma. There was a wonderful hoppy explosion that got sweeter as it warmed up in my mouth. This beer reminds me so much of SN Pale, but with a huge upgrade. Even my fiance that doesn't like beer enjoyed this one. I really think this one should have a higher rating than its current."
"To add, I think this is predominately a bitter beer. Grapefruit rind in a bottle. I like bitter, but I find this one-dimensional and I am not too impressed. I'll finish the bottles in my fridge and will probably not buy or drink this again."
"Thanks to feloniousmonk for the bottle."
"Looks very much like a Wit. Cloudy pale yellow with a snow white frothy head. Lots of floaties. Aroma is yeasty like a wheat with a hint of citrus. Flavor is also like a Wit yet a very bitter finish that lingers. Somewhat of a different pale and if not for the harsh bitterness, wouldn't be too bad."
"Not my favorite Bell's but still pretty drinkable."
"A beclouded yellow color as it sets in my glass, with lots of little fernies floating around, the head is a majestic crown of white upon the gold with a satin like sheet of lace to drape the glass. Earthy malt that is somewhat sweet and crisp at the front, backed up my a hint of yeast, a splendid nose if I may take that liberty, start is rich in malt, lightly sweet with the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is brisk in its acidity and the hops persistent in their spiciness, the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting, a fine drinking beer and one that would be a Hit with us Arizonians when the temperature hits the 110s, hell it would be a hit here if it hit the 10s, God forbid Snow & Ice"" especially here in Phoenix, cus these Knot Heads can keep from running into each other in bright sunshine on dry eight lane roads when we are all heading in the same direction."
"I love it. Very drinkable, if you can appreciate the hoppy bitterness."
"A decent beer, but for a bell's beer....this is a dissapointment!"
"I am not entirely sure about it, on the whole, but it's growing on me."
"ng"
"Another raised tip of my Hat to BigHuge, for this fine thirst quencher."
"Nice hazy amber with a small head.Nice tight bubbles rising in glass.Somewhat bready aroma with a sharp hop bite.Hops dominate the flavor but are almost overpowering.Doesnt come across as an IPA or the like.Has a sharp flavor to match the aroma.Somewhat astringent flavor.Pretty standard going down-the better mouthfeel is washed away by the overall flavor.No big deal stick with their stouts."
"Pours a medium gold color with a rather thick fluffy head,a real malty toastey aroma not much hop to it.The taste is really malty and bread-like some nice fruitiness as well,there is some hop dryness and herbalness in there but its very faint.A decent brew but I dont rate it with some of the others from Kalamazoo."
"This beer pours a cloudy orange color with a medium head and just a tiny bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma was pretty hoppy with a bit of wheat. The taste seemed a bit plain and not to my style. It had some citrus hints but mostly it was hoppy and bready. Drinkability was ok, but this one just didn't fit my style."
"This is supposed to be a pale ale? I don't think so. This is definitely a lager. It is a pretty quality made lager but nothing special. Very yeast and doughy in taste. Other tastes do not come forward enough for me to recognize them. A pretty easy to drink brew but nothing special."
"This brew had a fruity aroma, a large white head of small to medium bubbles and a cloudy yellow orange body. Initial bitter taste followed by a dislike for the taste. It got a little better with time, but still not high on my list."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a cloudy golden color with a medium head that didn't stick around long. The is some lacing to be seen. Aroma is of malt and hops. Good carbonation, taste is slightly sweet, with a medium body to it, and a good hop finish. Drinkable but not my cup of tea."
"Nice maps on the label which vary from bottle to bottle. It pours a cloudy pale golden color, with a nice thick puffy cloudlike head which sticks to the side of the glass. A smell of sweet caramel and bread is present. This is a nice tasting beer, and as with the smell, caramel comes through in the taste. A smooth drinking beer with a medium feel. I enjoy this beer, however, do not find it easy to have more than about one in a sitting--this may be due to the sweetness in the taste."
"Flavor: I was disappointed. As fine a brewer as K'zoo Bells is, this one isn't too good. It had a sour taste.of those around here. I'll pass"
"Nice looking lager, soft hazy yellow, more orange at the top with a big luscious, pillowy head of stark whiteness that faded somewhat fast but always leaves a solid thin skim of foam the whole glass through, lacing is in stringy patches. Aroma is all malts, very biscuity, and bread doughish, with a slight soft touch of apple and citrus. Taste is darn nice, layered and fairly complex malts, soft and appealing, slight breadish quality with subdued yeast and hops that lend a bit earthy, nice mellowing bitterness and dryness follows through and lingers longly into the back of the throat and tongue. Very well balanced. Feel is a lighter medium body, pretty full too, with a bizaar light creamyness in the middle and giving way to a slight tingly dryness into the finish. This was a surprise to say the least, wasn't expecting it to be this good after reading so many mixed reviews. I figured its a Bell's it can't be all bad. And its not. One heck of a easy, well balanced little brew."
"When I poured the beer it formed an enormous monster of a head. Maybe I did something wrong, but I felt like a mad scientist. The head kept growing up and up to form an entire mini mountain range. It didn't settle and the lacing coated my glass. The color of the beer is a muted-orange/yellow color. It smells bitter, but muted. It tastes about the same. Strongly bitter aftertaste. Kind of thick and creamy at first. All in all, a slightly better than average brew."
"Pours to a hazy, orangish/yellow color with a thick off-white head. The aroma is extremely citrusy and floral. The flavor is again citrusy and somewhat bready, with the typical yeast flavor from many Kalamazoo beers. It is a well balanced brew, not to hoppy or too malty. It would be a good session beer; it is light-medium bodied and easy drinking. Not a bad brew."
"Third Coast, on cask: Imagine my surprise when I saw I had yet to rate this beer, as I’ve had it on cask numerous times, in numerous places around town. Interestingly, the place I had it today called it a summer seasonal. This was a typical cask beer, fairly bright yellow, with not much head, although no less than one should expect. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Actually a wonderful taste, nicely balanced malts and hops, with several layers of complexity. This beer is a great example of the miracles of real cask ale, as it lets the characteristics of the beer really stand out. Buy it, if you can find it on cask."
"Brilliant clear golden hue until the poured yeast sediment provides a uniform turbidity. Fluffy, well retained pure white head leaves coarse lace. Floral hop nose, with soft doughy malt and hints of butterscotch. Subdued, pleasant green apple. Enticing aroma. Quick snap of bready sweetness on the palate is washed by a surge of sharp hop bitterness that's initially non descript. Hop character becomes herbal mid palate, surfacing along with a grainy dextrin malt pseudosweetness and mellow diacetyl. Moderate in body, and both proteinaceous and amply dextrinous in mouthfeel. Creamy. Finishes with a brief resurgence of maltose, but otherwise dry and pleasantly bitter. Certainly a quirky brew and quite flavorful at that. Not overly lager like. Remincescent of a Paulaner Munich Lager / Anchor Liberty ale hybrid with a drop of diacetyl. Uniquely tasty. Thanks to Feloniousmonk for sending this bottle!"
"Somewhat sour aroma,but not so strong as to be unpleasant, then a sweet pale malt backing. Huge, somewhat fluffly, white head. Pale gold mildly cloudy from setiment in the bottom of the bottle. Some lacing. Mix of mild malt with a sour flavor that moves to drynesss that leaves a long after taste (that is sometimes too bitter). Appropriately medium to thin, with just a little too little of body. Dissappointing considering the caliber of the brewery. Too sour with not enough balancing."
"A most unusual lager, you never, ever find this much flavor in a lager! Bold, bright, beautiful, tasty, zippy, zingy, clean, fresh, refreshing, with an unusually fruity finish, and without being troubled by darker flavors or too much body. It belongs in a class by itself!"
"Hazy golden color, lots of suspended particles. Medium head, white and about 1/4 inch in height. Yeasty pizza dough aromas with a slight hop prickle to the nose hairs. Hoppiness dominates the flavor profile and the overall impression -- while there is enough of a brown sugar and cardamon sense to the malt to lend a creamy and balanced mouthfeel, the finish and memory is citrusy hoppy and bitter oily, overall. Somewhat astringent beer, could use a little more complexity in my opinion..."
"Poured a hazy cinnamon brown/orange with yeast particles. Was a clear color before the bottom of the bottle was poured (when lit from behind it was a clear amber with a red tinge, minus the yeast). Thick light tan head with big bubble. Gradually subsided and left a small amount of lacing. Rich malty aroma with caramel, alcohol, and a light floral hoppiness. Flavor dominated at first by a rich, malty sweetness that was balanced by a hop bitterness. Aftertaste dominated by hops but had some caramel flavors. Slightly acidic and astringent. Full mouthfeel and a dry finish. Moderate carbonation. Not bad."
"A beautiful pour--golden yellow with a lava lamp effect created by rising carbonation cutting through suspended yeast sediment. A couple fingers worth of foamy, cream-colored head that reduces to a nice cake with minimal lacing. Sweet, floral smell complemented by light bready notes. Given the wonderful look and nose of this beer as well as the general strength of Kzoo brews, the taste is something of a downer. Bitterness rules the day from the start to the afternotes. Other flavors (sweetness, citrus, and yeast, most notably) are overtaken but are nonetheless detectable. This beer seems to cling quite a bit, which is probably more noticeable because of the persistent bitterness. It is more than adequately drinkable, but there are better choices both in this style and from Kzoo Brewing."
"A pretty average offering from Bell's...cloudy yellow in color...big fizzy white head....nose is of herbal hops and some breadiness....flavor is dominated by the hops...I expected more malt backbone than what is offered here..I dig the hops....a little citrucy but not as good in this aspect as other pale ales...bitter, dry finish....I've had many Pale Ale's better....dissapointing effort from one of my favorite brewers..."
"This beer is classified as an APA, but I'm not so sure.  When I purchased this today, I was talking to one of the Beer Men in the store (who is actually a BA) and he told me this beer used a lager yeast."
"Okay, this is a light, clear yellow color.  Slight aroma, with a slight tangy taste too it.  Lighter then most pales I enjoy.   Bell's as whole in their lighter ales/lagers really haven't appealed to me so far."
