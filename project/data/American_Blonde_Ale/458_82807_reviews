"Pretty damn good. Strong, full flavor with no objectionable qualities. Fairly cheap, strong enough, and easy to put down. Love the dry hopped flavor; this beer has a certain dignity to it that the regular Fireman's Four just barely misses. Don't get me wrong, Fireman's Four is a great beer, but Four Squared is just that - Four ""squared."" Rich, thick, with good carbonation and a universally good flavor. I could honestly not see anybody who likes beer having a problem with this brew. It's not too-much or too-little of anything. It tastes great without venturing into the more adventurous flavors which non-craft-fans may not enjoy. For those new to Real Ale who prefer more standard beers, I would start here. If you're feeling adventurous or want something that's stronger than necessary and has a crazy flavor, try their Devil's Backbone. Either way this is a company that makes great product and you're in good hands buying any of their beers"

"This pours from the can a solid yellow tan color, like a dark lemon jello color. There’s a underprounced straw-grass hop aroma on it which lends itself to a crisp, straw/grassy characteristic as it’s sipped. The seasons haven’t changed to fall where I live yet but this beer is making me think it would be the perfect autumn IPA sipper."

"over all a really surprisingly good beer that is well balanced hoppy beer."

"Let me first start by saying I'm a big fan of both Real Ale and Fireman's 4 but this rendition of the beer is not to my liking. The beer is a bright golden color with a soap bubble head. Nose is extremely floral and citrusy. Beer is a sharp one hit of bitterness and overpowering yeasty flavors that left an unpleasant after taste. The body is light and crisp, almost no malt flavoring to balance. Not something I'd recommend or return to, Fireman's 4 just isn't a big enough beer to balance the dry hoppying."

"When I first tasted this I thought it was a pale ale. I was shocked to see it's (supposed to be) a blonde. I would definitely have this again in a heartbeat. Cheers!"

"Nice summer night and my neighbor brings over a couple of Texan beers. This one in a can surprised me because it started as a blonde ale and I'm a very hoppy beer lover. It was very clean and dry and although not really hopped up it was very pleasant to drink. Balances and tasty."

"reat nose! Sweet citrus, cotton candy, definite pine. Much more on the malty flavor... Somewhat surprising. Nice caramel, mild breadiness, with a twinge of tartness near the finish. Very nice hops that finishes a pretty solid beer. I don't really like their fireman's#4 offering and was afraid this would be a mildly hopped version of that. It actually is a very nice beer that really showcases the hops around a decent base beer"

"12 ounce can poured into glass a nice clouded golden yellow with good head, smell of hops very prounounced , a little citrus fruity smell. I dont like Blonde beers normally and I dont care for the regular Firemans 4 version but this hopped up version is awesome ! Hope they decide to make it a regular offering. This and their stellar Lost Gold IPA are my favorites from Real Ale, the Rye Pale Ale aint bad either."

"A supercharged version of the Fireman’s 4 with a clean dry finish that went down smooth. The 4-squared poured a hazy gold with a substantial white head. The added hops were readily apparent on the aroma and through the first sips that really transformed the Firemen’s 4 into a fantastic beer. The base Fireman’s 4 flavors are there with a bit more body behind them and more pleasingly bitter hops all around."
"This Real Ale beer is a tasty one and the hops help make it and enjoyable brew. It seems like it would go very well with certain cheeses and its fruity component makes it a good refresher for a summer day- something I wouldn’t normally say for a hoppier than average beer. But this one is definitely one to try and enjoy and I recommend grabbing a six pack or two if you can find it."

"This revved up golden ale features nice floral spice on the nose that matches the wonderful taste of aggressive, yet not offensive hopping plus increased carbonation[compared to Fireman's #4]. The beer is now a seasonal offering."

"Overall- I'd really love to try this from the tap, I think it would have much more character than from the can"

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is quite enjoyable with a mellow yeastiness and alcohol feel. Probably the best real ale offering I have tried to date. Thanks again Will."

"Excellent light-drinking, but still hoppy and wonderfully aromatic beer. Perfect for the dog days of summer. The ABV on this is 6% per Real Ale's website. I agree with other reviewers that this is more of a pale ale rather than an amber or red. I had the one that comes in a black can. Perhaps the various incarnations of ""4" have created confusion."

"Got in a trade with Cyde. 12 ounce can into pint glass, best before 8/20/2013. Pours moderately cloudy pale golden amber color with a 2 finger fairly dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, orange rind, floral, grass, pine, light honey, and dank floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dank hop notes with a light malt balance; and good strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest, tangerine, orange rind, floral, grass, pine, bread, light honey, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of dank floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, floral, grass, pine, bread, light honey, and floral earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice complexity and balance of dank hop flavors; with a light-moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent hoppy blonde ale. All around nice balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. Really enjoyed this one."

"O- a decent pale ale that is better than a lot of the, but nothing to blow me away. Love the fact that it comes in a can though, although I didn't see a ""bottle on"" date but I may have just missed it."
""

"O: While it has a bit too much acidity from the hops, this is still quite refreshing. Plus, it's cheap!"
"O: Definatly not what I was expecting. This was recieved on a trade so I hadn't heard of it previously. I did enjoy the malt profile of this beer and the fresh hop aroma, but it lacked some of the bitterness I was expecting. But a solid beer overall"
"Pale golden pour with a foamy white head sustained by pillars of carbonation. Grassy and floral hops dominate the smell. Cantaloupe and honeydew melon. The taste expounds on those light melon notes and flourishes. Excellent citrus forwardness. Nice light hop bite in the finish and a lingering freshness on the tongue. A bit of toast takes something away from this for me. This drinks dangerously well though. Excellent carbonation and light body. Deceptively refreshing."

"The zingy hops are just bitter enough, but mostly it's a festival of leafy, herbaceous, perfumey, and darkly fruity aromatics. I can't identify anything that reminds me of specific fruits, but it's quite a harmonious warm brew. I'm not a hop obsessive, but this is a really sensational hoppy beer. I think it should be categorized either as a Pale Ale or an American IPA. The focus is clearly on the hops, and the color is neither a red or amber. From the 12 oz can purchased at Texas Wine in Fredericksburg."

"The beer pours a golden yellow color with a soapy white head that left tons of lacing. Smells of fruity tangerines and grapefruit with some caramel in the background. It tastes of hoppy citrus peel, mostly grapefruit, there is some breadiness and pine in there too. It has a light body and the carbonation is soft, full and silky and the finish is crisp and slightly dry. I really enjoyed this beer, way better than the regular Fireman's 4."

"O - Unbelievably good. Without a doubt, this is by far the best offering from Real Ale."

"A very tasty beer. Highly recommended."

"DRINKABILITY: This is the first beer I've given a perfect rating on I think. This is exceptionally refreshing for a hop head as well as a regular beer drinker while being sessionable as well."

"I'd consider this one a summer beer for sure. Offer it to friends at the pool instead of the typical bmc this season."

"O - An enjoyable beer that I will continue to pursue. I like the hops aroma and flavor. I wouldn't call it unique, but this beer takes a less traveled path to hoppiness."

"Overall- Just about what you'd expect, it's a beefed-up Fireman's 4, but unfortunately the things F4 has going for it (clean, light, crisp, good drinkability- all great in a blonde ale) don't really come through. Still quite balanced and on the refreshing side, but a heftier beer needs bolder flavors to entice me."
