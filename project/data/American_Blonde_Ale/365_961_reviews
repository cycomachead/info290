"Malt and hops, hops drying out the finish. Clear golden body, with airy head, aroma of bread, crackers, mostly malt characteristics. Taste is malt again, hops kick in on the back plane, drying it out at the finish. Very crisp and clean beer, but not as smooth and velvety as some of the British or Belgian varieties."

"A little hoppy for my taste but good for a summer afternoon. I've not much experience with ""golden ales"" I guess, but I was expecting something a little more drinkable. It has a citrusy finish, similar to a pale ale. I give it points for being organic and it seems relatively complex for a lighter beer."

"I chose this beer cause I really like Pike IPA and wanted give one of there other brews a taste. This is is a great break away from Hoppy brews and I really appreciate the obvious craft of creating another fine brew. I will still enjoy my IPA's but this one is on the list for another way to enjoy fine beer, I think all my Texas friends who are not craft beer drinkers would enjoy it as well."

"Conclusion this beer is a good session beer for experienced craft beer drinkers. For noobs there may be to much flavor."

"Probably just fine on a hot day; not terribly interesting to me."

"Overall it's enjoyable, perhaps not my personal favorite from Pike, but still tasty."

"Had this at Uncle Uli's in Leavenworth. Crystal clear straw color with a nice white head. Floral and sweet notes in the aroma. Very smooth and malty flavor. Very drinkable. Light malty sweetness with mild bitterness and a dry finish. I'm not a huge blonde ale fan but I think this one represents this style well, and is another good beer from this brewery."

"O - Very much a classic pilsner flavour and feel, close enough to a blonde ale and worth a purchase either way"
""
""
""

"O: Most American blondes really don't do much for me and this one was no different. Again, nothing really wrong with it, average."

"Overall a decent pale ale, aside from that vaguely musty quality on the palate. That's enough reason not to have this again though, given the crowded field of better pale ales out there."
"Pretty dull beer. Not particularly impressed."
""
"Overall- Light, refreshing, soft feel, and good flavor for a blonde ale. Pretty good for a $3 bomber, a nice summer drinker. I'll probably get it again at some point."
""
""
"O - Overall, I should have tried this sooner. It's one solid pale ale!"
""
""
"Poured and inviting hazy yellowish orange, 2 finger off white head that stays for a few minutes leaving decent lacing.. Smells of relaxed hops and sweet malt. Taste is mostly sweet caramel malt with hops balancing it very well. Overall a perfect beer for this nice spring afternoon."
""
"O - A very well balanced pale ale that doesn't assault your taste buds with tons of hop bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - Good and flavourful for a golden ale. Not extreme but well done."
"Pours a beautiful dark golden color with two fingers of head… lots of lacing. Smells of hops and pine. The flavor is very crisp and hoppy with a touch of grapefruit and grass. The mouthfeel is light, creamy, and well carbonated. Overall, very drinkable."
"This is actually more enjoyable than it seems."

"Taste has a light bitterness with some creamy light malt. There's a a good full Mouthfeel and a dry finish."
"Medium bodied with a crisp hop bite up front that lingers over the sweeter notes and bready yeast into a slightly dry finish. Pale malt backbone with hints of grass and straw along with some zesty spice and apple. Well balanced, refreshing and easy to drink."
"A little underwhelming, but the flavors opened up after a few minutes and this was actually quite pleasant and easy-drinking."
"On tap at Pike brewery. Pours golden hue with a white, foamy head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of biscuit malt and piney hops. Medium, crisp body. Taste is of piney hops, grapefruit and biscuit malt in the background. Long, hoppy finish. Nice, tasty brew."
"It took some time, but Pike Brewing has arrived in Orange County. To all the hop bombs I can easily grab from the shelf, this is a fair alternative for those who aren't looking to get their palate thrashed in a pinch."
"It’s more like an English Pale Ale than American Pale Ale. It’s pretty good beer."
"A Superb enjoyment."
"O: A pretty good beer, but very easy to forget."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good Pale Ale overall. It is drinkable and has a nice balance. The grassy note is a bit out of balance, but overall that is a pretty nit-picky thing. This is one of the better examples of this style I have had, and I would definitely recommend giving it a shot."
"D - A tasty offering, reminiscent of a hopped up pilsener. Worth a try, but don't expect anything spectacular."
"D - Sure its fairly light and drinkable. It's an average offering."
"Overall, a decent enough pale ale, restrained in the bitterness, but still exhibiting a full flavour profile. A good sessioner, if you're ok with a more rounded quaff."
"Poured into a imperial pint glass a deep amber hued golden with a well formed tight one finger white head that was gone pretty quickly.Mainly caramel/biscuit malt in the nose with some light floral hops,seemed to be a little more malt driven wich surprised me a little.The flavors are alot like the aromas,sweetish biscuit malt with light citric and earthy hops,a little toastiness in the finish.Pretty much a no frills APA with a big malt bill,not bad."
"Taste is clean, full grain, apple, light grass with a long, full aftertaste. Balanced sweetness and light bitterness with light spicy-herb hint and faint bitterness at finish."
"Final Notes: A delicious no-frills session beer. Ideal for when you want a beer with flavor but that's easy on the palate and you can have a few in a single setting. Would make an excellent party or after-yardwork beer."
"D: Average drinkability, even its unusual low abv hardly makes this a contender for more, just a boring example, flat and lazy drink that is mediocre at best. Average excitement not particularly sharp and defined, and rather lifeless and mundane."
"Pours a rather typical clear yellow with a foamy white head. Aroma is not strong, but is crisp and malty if not inspiring. Flavor, fortunately, is better - malty and a little fruity with a faint and not too unpleasant tinny undertone. Texture is smooth and just a little fizzy. Overall, fair to middlin' and leaning towards middlin'."
"I think I'm pretty jaded at this point: Nellie doesn't look all that naughty to me... The brew pours a mostly clear orange juice topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises wheat, corn, floral hops, coriander, cardamom, and a tiny touch of coffee-laced toffee. The taste comprises the toffee, corn, wheat, florals, and a touch of newcoming orange-peel. The body is pretty light, with a light carbonation and a nearly crisp finish. Overall, a very ordinary brew, nothing much going on, but very drinkable nonetheless. Not bad if you're looking for a session brew."
"The low ABV does show through on the mouthfeel, though, with a slight, slick, and watery feel. But even so, this is a marvellous hot weather session beer."
"Average but drinkable. Try it yourself."
"Taste, a little muted in comparison to their other beers compared per style. I mean, their IPA/DIPA/Barleywine are through the roof. This one is made for the ladies I take it. It isn't bad, its just a warm up, liason between I dunno maybe they still drink Olympia and Hamms out there. Minimal hops and bitterness, never heavy, but still good enough to rock on a hot day."
"D) A pleasant brew. I'd have another...if only I had another to drink."
"Pike Brewing Company--Naughty Nellie Golden Ale. 4.70% ABV. 24 IBU's. Milld lace head. Clear bright gold color. Subtle floral hop front. Mild sweet somewhat creamy light butter biscuit caramel smooth body. Crisp refreshing delicate hop spice end. Quite tasty despite lightness. Well Made. (4.0 / 5.0) 5 oz. Taster @ Seattle Pike Pub & Brewery 5/9/2010."
"Drinkability: Would have loved to have more ABV present but it was made well for style."
"Drinkability: A light, though pleasant, very easily drinkable beer that was the one, singular shining grace in a night of being forced to sit through ""Twilight"" in its entirety. However, I'd consider it more in line with a blonde ale as opposed to a pale ale, but what do I know."
"It has a thick body with a big malt backbone. It has a nice bitter finish to it that is pretty dry. The taste overall to me is pretty bland, but it is a nice golden ale. It is very approachable."
"Bright citrus hops balance a soft biscuity malt discernment finishes mild with a faint hint of pear. Decent quaffing ale"
"This is a well balanced, easy drinking, sessionable beer. It is a good example of how a pale ale can be flavorful without being hoppy."
"Pours a clear golden orange colored body, bubbly. Huge foamy slightly off-white head, average sized bubbles. Funky aroma, grainy. Effervescent. Lagery. Cooked vegetables. Fizzy, foamy. Some hops. Funky taste, vegetably. Not as bad a taste as the smell. Letting air out a bit. Better as it warms up. Not as vegetably, but not a fan of the flavor."
"Drinkability: very drinkable. This would make a stellar session beer."
"Not a Pike favorite for me but also not something I'd normally drink, in any event, since I almost always drink a higher alcohol brew. Not bad; just not my thing."
"The body was medium full, not as full as others of the style, without being the least bit heavy. This is a very drinkable beer, crisp, light, refreshing and easy to enjoy. This may be the perfect lawnmower beer, why drink thin, watery crap when you could hangout with Nellie? Worth trying."
"Pours a very nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one finger creamy light white head, with some nice sticky lacing. The nose is slightly hoppy, with some nice malt notes, very slight citrus. The taste is slightly hoppy, malty, slightly bitter, with some citrus. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice little brew."
"This beer is the middle management Human Resources job of American Pale Ales. Just there for the paycheck. Like this review the beer started out with high hopes, then the wheels come off.."
"This one had nice flavors added to good drinkability, sessionable for sure."
"Nothing exceptional, but an acceptable stand-by if nobody else is home."
"Naughty Nellie's lacks the hoppy bitterness to be considered a Pale Ale in the sense that we all know it by. It is mild in character throughout. Cloudy pale and yellow in the color. Fruity in the nose and the mouth with no big malt or hop characteristics jumping out at you. Fine mouthfeel and good drinkability, it tastes fine and has a good ABV that you drink for a while."
"All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by this one. At times, it felt a bit mundane and usual, but at the same time, it's unbelievably drinkable and smooth. great with food, decent on it's own, and all in all, delicious. This one would also make a solid entry into craft brew for those unfamiliar - nothing too offensive or powerful."
"Sample at the brewpub. This brew pours a clear golden color with a thin and foamy off-white head that diminishes steadily. Sticky patches of lacing on the glass. Mild hops and grass in the nose. Light-bodied with a light hoppy character, with notes of malt and hay. The finish is floral hops with a lightly bitter aftertaste. Average overall."
"We bought this because my wife's name is Nellie, not because we wanted the beer. It surprised me and I'm glad I had it! I would recommend this to anyone who prefers a less hoppy pilsner/pale ale style that leans towards the sweet side."
"Poured a light amber gold color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is fruity and sweet. Light and refreshing, slightly fruity. Some hop bite, nice balance. Medium bodied. Full flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is hoppy and bitter."
"Overall: The mouth feel is astringent and powdery dry. The finish is bitter. The beer comes off as flat and light struck. There is a slight sulfur taste mingling in the beer. The head is not persistent. The beer is uninteresting and boring. I didn't think that beer can live up to its name on the label. The hops are dull in the beer and adds no character. The malt comes off shallow, which leads to a bland personality."
"Fairly average, would not seek out again."
"Not an exciting ale, but a decent introductory standby that's very companionable with a burger. Very enjoyable, actually."
"D - Pretty good. Coffee was unexpected but welcomed addition"
"Purchased: Liquid Solutions"
"Drinks alright, just not enough going flavor-wise to hold my interest past one or two"
"The taste brings a white wine sweetness that is balanced promptly by citrus hops and a hint of pine. Perhaps this is an American Pale Ale after all? Either way, this beer tastes good. I'd even like the hoppiness if it were a Golden Ale, so no marks against it. The mouthfeel is juicy and clean, with a crisp & bubbly finish that picks up a touch of bitterness from the hops. I can get down with this brew; although the style isn't my favorite, you can taste the craftsmanship behind the beer, as with most of Pike Brewing Co's creations."
"taste is somewhat watery and light, hops, some wheat, grainy, some citrus, and just a touch of bitterness."
"Thanks to my son for muleing this one back from Seattle, and for the warning that it's not much of a drinker."
"If you considering it as a Kolsch, it's really a quite drinkable session beer."
"Eh is all I have left to say about this beer."
"D: Not bad."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow/ orange-ish color with a white head. In the aroma, sweet maltiness and almost lager like. In the taste, dry to sweet maltiness and quite lager-ish. A smooth with a small bite in the mouthfeel and a small dry malty sweetness in the aftertaste. OK, very lager-ish throws me off nothing too exciting."
"Pours a three finger white head that fades slowly to thin layer leaving a good lace. Cloudy pale amber color. Light carbonation and light bodied. Slight hoppy nose. Flavor has some malty sweetness but hops dominate which is surprising given that the IBUs are only 34. Lingering bitter aftertaste. $1.45 for a 12oz bottle from John's Marketplace Portland, OR."
"Drinkability: This is a refreshing brew that provides great flavor and unique character."
"D: This is an easy brew to drink long into the night (and possibly the next day). It has a modest ABV, is lightly carbonated, and neither the sweetness of the malts or bitterness of the hops dominates."
" Body is light and effervescent, although it can be a touch fizzy if sipped hastily. Goes down easy, and given the low ABV, would probably make a decent session beer. Still, it doesn't rank as one of my favorites."
"D: Moderately drinkable, a good summer backyard beer."
"When first poured, the color was a slightly haze golden yellow, with very little foam. Then, after the first smell, it seemed that this ale had a lot of promise. The smell of mild hops and a fruity aroma filled the nose. Then it was down hill after that. The taste was just of a sour/tart/bitter and not a lot of hop flavor or any fruit what so ever. After each sip, all I got was the sour/bitter/tart taste on the palate with very litlle flavor of anything. Blah! One more gulp and down the sink!"
"Certainly a session beer for those who can handle the hoppiness of an APA...price wise this beer makes me search out AlleyCat's Fullmoon before visitiing Naughty Nellie again though."
"As I drink this, I'm watching Silver Chair struggle through their new single, Strait Lines, which I really enjoy on the radio. The singer can't hit the falsetto at all, quickly switched to screaming, and wow, now I'm not so bummed their show at the Crystal Ballroom is sold out! The point is, it's an interesting parallel to this beer, as while I applaud the effort, but it fails miserably. So yeah, one and done, not drinkable to me."
"Big thanks to lipschitz for sending me this (CanBIF)."
"NOTE: My bottle says 4.9% ABV, and the label is different."
" Overall a great light easy drinking als. Great on a hot summer day. This is a beer that everyone will like."
"The taste was a nice balance between bitter and sweet, broken up with a blast of hops in the middle before finishing crisp and clean. The carbonation was lively, but not abrasive, and medium body seemed right for the style."
"The mouth thins a bit in the end, but this is an easy drinking session beer. Nice to meet you Nellie!"
"An okay pale ale when all is said and done. Not worth the clams for it when we have decent micro pale ales brewed locally and regionally available for less. Still, it's good to see new stuff available on the shelves as well. And I like the name."
"Hazy golden pour with a light head that retains for the length of the beer. A flowery perfume hops with a sweet malt body aroma. A sweet hops taste with a bitter malt after taste. A creamy feel with a crisp finish and a sweet aftertaste. In all this beer is very easy to drink it has a nice blend of flavors and a crisp quality that makes it tasty and refreshing."
"Drinkability: very average. I had this on two different days of my trip, and both days I had the same impression - just not impressed with this beer."
"Brought to me from the brewery in Seattle"
"I found this to be a better balanced and more drinkable than their standard pale ale. Very good."
"Very pleasant beer. Not going to offend any beer fans, but may be a bit difficult for people who stick with low-end American beers to stomach."
"It has the malty backbone of a bohemian pilsner."
"Medium-golden with a compact, foamy, white head. Light, grainy bread malt aromas are overshadowed by lively, spritzy, fresh, citrusy hops. Light malt flavors up front. Grainy, faintly sweet. Big zesty hop splash. Fresh, citrusy, juicy, and bitter. Very thirst quenching beer here. Light bodied, dry at first and then juicy hop finish. A nice session ale that's all about fresh, juicy hops!"
"This bottle foamed over after I popped the cap, not due to anything I could control--it has been sitting upright, unagitated for a week. Styrofoam white head, chunky but not overly consistent. The beer is a fuzzy nectarine colour, and the head leaves rings of thick lacing. The aroma is unexpected, but delightful: citrusy Belgian pale ale aroma here, almost like the metallic tang of Orval. The yeast definitely plays a role in the smell, giving a soapiness and sourish fruitiness. A strange combination of malt, and little to suggest hops at all. The metallic and tart fruitiness really dominates. This is not complex, but I enjoy it quite a bit. Pineapple citrus and grapefruit on the mouth, leaving a bitterness like pomegranate seeds. Light malts mingle with the strong lemon citrus, and again hops are not easy to find in the taste, whilst they do leave the dryness. The taste definitely has some Belgian characteristics. I would say grapefruit and lemon are the two most detectable flavours here, with the light malt in the background. This possesses some similarities to hefeweizens as well, not only in the unfiltered look, but the sour but revitalising wheat-like tastes(and judging by the bottom of the bottle this beer is unfiltered.) The body is medium and refreshing, and the carbonation is average. The strange aftertaste is unique for this style, and actually quite quaffable. This is bit of hybrid in my opinion--pale ale does not quite describe it."
"The Naughty Nellie that Naughty Nellie's Ale was named after was a lady of the evening, harlot, tart... take your pick. Since variety is the spice of life, a maxim that I'm sure applies to her profession as much as it applies to beer, I'm willing to cut her ale some slack for its uniqueness. I won't be buying it again, but for a one night stand, she... er, it... was an enjoyable enough ride."
"The head is small, off-white, noisy and dies to a film. The beer is clear, orange-gold, brassy. Sweetish, malty nose shows a little barbershop. Some grains and flowers in the front give way to a thick, flavorful, somewhat fruity middle. The finish is nicely bitter, nutty, perfumey. This is a good beer with lots of character."
"Light-medium bodied, liked it better on draft but still a solid beer."
"This one pours out to a dark gold in the glass with a decent-sized head. The aroma is that of bread dough and malt. The taste is really nice, with a some lemon flavor detected along with a nice, malt sweetness. This is an easy to drink beer that would be quite easily consumed on a warm day."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy off-white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a malty scent that boasts of pale and biscuit malts. It has a bit of a citrus hop aroma. The taste is good. It has a light and refreshing malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes slightly bitter and dry. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking pale ale. It has good aroma and taste; a solid drinker."
"This beer was great. Pours a light golden amber with a medium looking white head. Lacing is decent but not spectacular, lacing will show on the glass. Smell is of caramel and fruit malts, citrus hops bring up the rear. The taste is a great balance of apple syrup malt and hopped up citrus. Grapefruit detected. Medium bodied and invites you back for more, excellent."
"They have better beers."
"Notes: This beer has 2 very nice characteristics that it executes well. One is the hops and the other is the slightly sweet biscuity malt that makes you want to keep drinking it. A very solid brew. Cheers!"
"It is a slight cloudy dark gold color with a decent head. The aroma is slight sweet and there is some floral and spicy hops in the nose. The body is light, but it stands up well to the bitterness. It has some sweet maltiness and a slight citric taste. There is a bit too much yeastiness for my taste, but it is not too bad. It finishes pretty dry."
"Pours a bright auburn color with a thin lace on the glass. The aroma is of mildly fruity hops and a hint of sweetness. Like the woman on the label, the beer has a great body with a perfectly balanced mild malt and spicy sweet hop balance. Refreshing finish and extremely easy drinking."
"Drinkability  Excellent interpretation of the style, although the hopheads may be a little disappointed. This went down well to start off the night."
"Hazy copper with good, tight head and lacing. Yummy sediment makes it cloudy and velvety on the tongue. Yeasty aroma of must, fruit. I would describe this as a pale ale for lovers of yeasty hefeweizens. Not any wheat, but lots of fruity yeast with flavors of banana and apricot. Malts are complex, with some nuts, butter and caramel. Hops are noticeable but not at all bitter, just appealing and moreish. Incredibly soft finish. Would probably be awesome on a not-too-hot summer day. Your girlfriend may love it. A very good, and unique beer. It was definitely too fruity to be the ideal beer for me, but I still liked it very much."
"Slightly sweet fruit nose. Sweeter malt base that covers the tongue initally. Then you get a nice fruit taste on the tip of the tongue (juicy fruit gum). The brew finishes with a nice sharp hop bitterness on the back and base of the tongue. The brew is balenced very nicely. Medium mouth and body. This is a nice drinkable ale. You are left with a little purfume hop flower in the finish as well... Nellies.."
"Light amber gold color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is fruity and sweet. Light and refreshing, slightly fruity. Some hop bite, nice balance. Medium bodied. Full flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is hoppy and bitter."
"Yet another gift from Genaro from his West coast swing. Pours a cloudy golden amber with a thin off-white head. A potent and lasting aroma of citrus, floral hops, sweet malt and crushed berries. Fairly malty with a slightly doughy and caramel notes. Lightly perfumed and amply hopped with lime citrus, mild grapefruit and hint of peppery spice. A faint taste of pears appears towards the end. All in all, not as naughty as the name implies, but pretty darn sexy."
"Pretty good session brew..as it suggests on the label."
"Slightly hazy orange brew forms a thin white head with OK retention and lacing. Aroma is very crisp and fresh with citric hops and well-balanced amount of malts. Taste is much the same...fresh, bright citric hops, smooth malts, a lingering honey-like sweetness and assertively fruity. The finish is smooth with caramel notes and an even bitterness throughout. Real nicely done, easy to drink. Clean, crisp wet mouthfeel with a medium-light body."
"A slightly beclouded amber color on the pour, the head portly in size, frothy in texture and the color an off white, with the residual lace a thin sheet to cover the glass. Light aroma of the hops, sweet malt, a bit or a hint of pineapple? Start is sweet and loaded with malt, the top skimpy in feel, finish is lightly acidic, the hops present but mild, dry aftertaste, not sure this beer will get much from me, seems a bit thin-waisted as in watery."
"Notes: They stated this is a session brew, they were right. Minus the extra yeast flavour this is a good brew and something I’d drink all night."
"Pours a very slightly hazy very slightly reddish golden color with a very large off white head with a floral nose. The beer has a slight herbal front with a peppery middle and a clean cedary finish with hints of grapefruit and thinnish mouthfeel. This is a decent drinkable beer that tastes of a higher alcohol percentage than I would guess it actually is. (% unknown)"

"This is a great summer brew. Lighter in body, a touch sweet with a nice hop presense to balance. It rates on the the refreshing scale as well as in quaffability."
