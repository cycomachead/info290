"Pours a clear golden orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, grass, and hay. Taste is much the same with a sweet and slightly fruity finish. There is a very mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable and pretty tasty for what it is."

"I've passed this one so many times... Thankfully, a single made itself available recently, so I finally decided to give it a shot. It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of short-lived off-white foam. The nose is a blast of buttery biscuit, with little else getting in the way. The taste changes things up a bit (thankfully), with notes of orange zest, light lemon peel, caramel, and light buttery toffee coming through. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, nothing too interesting going on here, but nothing all that offensive, either. Just another blah beer that's gonna be passed over by me in the future..."
"A decent blonde, it pours a pretty golden color with a small white head and just a bit of hoppiness and some mild bitter notes. Not a bad beer, but not my favorite from redhook. I would maybe drink it again, but overall I was not especially impressed."
"Overall it was a little bitter to be a real sessionable ale, and is honestly a bit forgettable. Nothing really standing up and greabbing you about this one. A decent pale ale that doesnt really stand out in the crowd."
"During a visit to Portsmouth we took the opportunity to visit Redhook Brewery. Tried the Golden Blonde. The color was golden clear with nice carbonation that gave way to a thin white head and lacing. The nose was a very faint citrus, if any. The taste was good, nice crisp, clean with maybe a hint of lemon. The mouthfeel was good and I certainly could do a Session with this beer."
"Very drinkable. Welcome back."
"Hm, well for starters on appearance, it looks almost completely see through, I am very surprised at how clear it is. It looks like a lager almost to me, I know it's a blonde ale, but still. There is a lot of carbonation. The head looked nice when I first poured it, it almost looked creamy, with a one finger width, but now it's almost gone. The appearance is average. The first smell I get is the hops, which is good, it means it's not pussing out the hop aspect. The next smell I pick up is citrus, and finally a small malt sweetness in the very back. The smell it's amazing, but it smells pretty good. Well the taste is a little disappointing, instead of getting that hop bite at first, you get the malts instead. There is a small hop bite mixed in there pretty nicely, but it is subdued by the overall sweetness and maltyness of the beer. There might be a tiny tiny citrus, but nothing like what I was smelling, which is also disappointing. All in all the beer tastes a little bit watered down to me. With all that being said, it isn't a bad tasting beer, it's good, just very average. An average beer from what I can tell is a so far average brewery. As far as mouthfeel, and drinkability go: the mouthfeel is ok, nothing special, the drinkability is pretty good since it is watered down a bit, and the taste is easy drinking and it's yummy enough not to be a gross watery beer. Overall an average beer."
"The body was a bit thin for the style, yet managed to still be kinda sticky. Drinkability was decent, but below average for the style. Overall, if you're in the mood for this style, try a different example."
"(86th)"
"Despite the overall presentation, it's a refreshing, though not completely satisfying, beer."
"Ok blond, fairly one noted with the exception of a nice clean honey taste."
"I've alway found Redhook to be a solid if unspectacular brewery, and this offering is no different. Worth a try though."
"Redhook Blonde is an average blonde ale that is a little lighter on flavor than I hoped."
"D= very drinkable, probably goes well with just about any meal or salad, refreshing and not boring for a blonde in this category. Sessionable."
"Ver drinkable, even for the non beer drinker, like my sister."
"Sampled on September 30, 2010. It pours a slightly cloudy golden yellow with a quarter to half inch of fizzy white head. Hops seem to greet the nose at first but that is followed up by a vaguely yeasty slightly malty sensation. The taste has this sort of canteloupe or melon thing going on as well as a thin but tart hoppiness in the end."
"A good choice if you're looking to drink more than one or two. By the same token, though, there are a number of other beers out there that taste pretty similar. If you find yourself in possession of a couple they'll go down smooth, but I wouldn't go looking for it"
"I rank this as a session beer, or a good beer for drinking with food. It's definitely a beer that invites a second half, or even more."
"Drinkability: the bit of sourness in the taste is fleeting and doesn't build on the palate. Overall, an enjoyable and refreshing beer."
"Highly drinkable, but just not as tasty as I had hoped it would be after the initial flavor burst up front. All in all a good beer, just leaning towards the basic side which I guess is fine for a nice summer brew. A definite session beer."
"Taste, middle of the road, minimal hopping, but a tang, that faint sweetness again, very little malt heft, but enough to separate it from a lesser classification. This is a decently built beer for a summer day or girlfriend. Good enough for me around the pool."
"Decent enough mouthfeel. A beer to drink after you've mowed the lawn and you want something to drink."
"D- Very drinkable, a good session beer (damn, did I really use that term?) I would order this at an outdoor spot on a sunny afternoon."
"Red Hook Ale Brewery, Inc.--BLONDE Golden Ale--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 5.30% ABV. 24 IBU's. (4.0 / 5.0) Wheat Ale. No sediment. Thin mild lace white head. Pretty enticing clear bright rich gold color. Delicate flowery mild hop light fruit ester front. Thin bodied mild sweet light caramel wheat doughy fruit hint refreshing body. Clean mild hop crisp citrus hint end. Well Made! Sampled 7/11/2010. 6-Pack $8.49."
"Overall, a decent, crisp ale that is refreshing. Nothing too special or interesting here at all though. I wouldn't turn one, but I don't see myself seeking this one out again."
"The case packaging looks neat as well!"
"Pass on this one"
"Blondes are not my favorite beer but this is one that's worth getting if that's what you're looking for . Not going to be too expensive, hopefully your expectations are already depressed and it's really not that bad after all that. Decent sweetness, which a blond should have and good enough abv to put on a buzz with."
"Some nice body in this ale, more than expected really. A fair amount of carbonation but still a nice smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable beer, not heavy or filling, and great flavor. I could do this whole six pack no problem."
"Low intensity, high refreshment, and unexpected character."
"D: Would not recommend this one but it is drinkable. Not a stellar example of a blonde ale at all."
"Overall, this is nothing special. It doesn't have to much of a complex taste to it. No major malts or major hops. Maybe a good summer beer."
"D: this brew lacks in overall complexity and has that, as I saw on another post, lawnmower type of vibe. On a hot day this might turn out to be the cats meow, otherwise it misses the mark"
"It felt watery yet syrupy at the same end. That said, it was drinkable and not terrible."
"Pours a body that is clear yellow in color, with a frothy head, small, malty, and effervescent. Light, watery, malty taste, light. Similar in many aspects to big brother beer. Not much else to say, kinda bland."
"M + D: Moderate carbonation and a lighter body. It's a pleasant beer, without going too crazy in any way... just nice and simple. If some of the macro offerings were more like this, I'd be in beer heaven. Not too bad at all."
"Overall.The beer is just okay. I don't think it is great. There is a cooked corn note coming over the toasted malt. The mouth feel is carbonation, and powdery. Finish is slight bit bitter and it kinda leaves a funky aftertaste."
"A solid, yet average brew. Doesn't blow you away with it's boldness, but thats not the brews purpose. The brews purpose is to be a solid Blonde Ale. Considering the limitations of the style, I would consider this a very average Blonde Ale. Not something I will seek out again, but I wouldn't turn one down either."
"Fairly drinkable like the rest of the style."
"A clear pale golden color with a minimal white head ,no lacing. Smells sweet and slightly fruity,just a touch of hay,or maybe grain.Flavor is a bit sweet,bready,with a touch of fruit . Nice dry finish and mouthfeel. A well built and solid blond,drinkable for sure."
"Very refreshing beer. Clear gold pour with a little white head. Fresh grassy aroma with lemon. Taste is wheaty, and little sweet and lemony, kind of like a hefe-light. A good beer for a hot day, but nothing spectacular. A better alternative to Bud Light."
"D- Very dribkable and non offensive. Not amazing but it gets good marks becaue it is quite nice in the style."
"The beer is a good looking one, with a nice pale malt nose with some graininess underneath. The beer pours a clear golden, a few shades darker than pale, with a decent creamy white head and some lacing. The beer is light to medium bodied, and a little thicker and creamier than what is typical in the style. There is a hoppy presence right up front in this beer and a rather citrusy rind taste more on the back end. This isn't a particularly complex blonde ale, it is smooth, quite a bit sweeter than most other blondes, with some graininess and biscuity qualities lurking not too far below. This is definitely more chewy than what is typical for the style. There is just a slightly off lemony citrus taste, and a bit too much hop up front that detracts from this beer. The beer is moderately carbonated and has an aftertaste that does linger a bit. Not a bad beer, glad I gave it a try."
"Drinkability: This beer has a warm, toasty feeling to it, and it's ok for a sipper. Personally, I don't really care for beer when it gets warmer, but I feel that this one holds up better that way. I wouldn't buy this on a regular basis, but it's not something that I'd avoid either. Not bad, but definately not the best Redhook has to offer."
"Nothing out of the ordinary here, just the usual blonde ale that seems to be pushed out by all american breweries. It was thrown in the mixed 12 pack so I gave it a whirl but wasn't really too happy with it. It's light bodied and super drinkable, but just not enough taste to warrant buying this on its own."
"An easy drinker, but otherwise unimpressive."
"Not bad, nothing to write home about either."
"D. A fairly new style. I would say this is an unremarkable beverage, but compared to some of its contemporaries, its above decent."
"D: Very drinkable beer as it is not very overpowering in any of the flavors and is a light feeling beer perfect for a summer day."
"Light and fairly refreshing. Golden color topped with a thin white head. Pretty basic taste with a slight malt flavor with some citric wheaty lemon notes. Goes down pretty smooth but this is nothing special. It would be good for sitting in the hot sun or doing some yard work."
"The drinkability is ok but I would not recommend or choose it again. Prosit, MK"
"D: This beer is nothing special, but I don't always need an outstanding and complex beer. This is a drinkable, smooth ale and a very good summer drink."
"For a blonde, it's not extreme, but it's sessionable and can hold it's own in the summertime. I wouldn't want to go after this one during the fall and winter months, but it fits with the mixed 12-pack it came with."
"There are so many better blonde ales out there that I regret buying a six pack of this stuff and will probably give it to guests to try."
"Except for the weak aroma, I kinda dug this brew."
"D - Wouldn't mind having a few of these to pound, certainly better than macro alternatives, but overall it's a very bland brew. It' somewhat reminds me of Flying Dog's Tire Bite mixed with semi-flat seltzer."
"pours a clear med. gold w/ a thin white head which dissipates quickly leaving little to no lacing in my nonic ; a very subtle smell, a bit of steely grain and lightly toasted malts, but not much else ; a thin, dry flavor as well, a bit of bready malts and a slight hop bite, some fruits but not discernable, slightly metallic finish ; a dry, light bodied beer with a good amount of co2 ; a quaffable brew for sure, just not a striking one..."
"D: Let's be honest, this isn't going to have as much impact as a great IPA or tripel, but as a blonde ale it's quite good."
"Bottle dated 021108. 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow color with a thin white head. The aroma is sweet grainy malt with just a touch of hops. The taste mirrors the smell with some malt and a touch of hops in the finish. This is really not an overly complex beer, but is decent for what it is. All in all, this is an easy drinking blonde that just doesn't possess enough character to buy again."
"This poured a light clear amber with very little head. It smelled and tasted like a regular pale ale, with a bit of hops and descent malt flavoring. It was watery but somewhat smooth with almost no carbonation. It had only a little aftertaste, which made it easy to drink but not very potent. Overall mediocre."
"Verdict: Not bad. Drinkable. Sessionable. Impressive? Not so much. Good summer beer? Check."
"The flavor doesn't really live up to a great ale, but it's drinkable."
"Pours a cloudy orange hued golden yellow with a bare head that quickly dissipates to nothing. No tracing to speak of. Aromas are a play on some crystal malts and hops, mostly citrus varieties with some bright fruitiness as well. It is a very quiet aroma, clean. On the palate, the malts develop with biscuity notes, whole grain bread and then mashed with more oranges and lemons, almost to a slight tartness. Hops are very subdued, an overall so so beer; certainly an easy drinker and nothing offensive but not particularly one I would pick up again."
"Pours a straw-ish blonde yellow color with a fair, white head. Lots of bubbles. Smell is of light graininess, maybe a hint of fruitiness. Taste is more of the very light matly/grainy flavors with a slight noble hop-like bitterness. Balanced but yet not much character to speak of. Easy drinking. Mouthfeel is very carbonated and light bodied. Fairly drinkable if you are looking for something light."
"Pours a light orange-gold with a thin white head that shrinks to a ring forthwith. The nose is mostly citrus and tepid malty sweetness. As is the taste -- rather bland and uncomplicated while remaining inoffensive. Crisp, light-bodied mouthfeel. An easy drinker, but not a thrilling one. Mediocre across the board. Just wanted something a little lighter while I'm making the chili before the big Super Bowl feast and I pulled this out of the Redhook variety pack so as not to take any of the better offerings ahead of time. It served its purpose -- I'd never buy one on its own."
"Taste is malty up front, not too sweet, bitterness near the end, but neither aspect are particular strong nor noteworthy. Crisp taste, bit much carbonation, better if this was a summer seasonal than a year-round brew that could be consumed in the winter."
"Poured a nice straw yellow color, good carbonation with a 1/2 inch fluffy white head. Taste was typical of most of them, lighlty hoppy, smooth not much body, character or love in this one. A drinkable beer but not one I would have over and over again."
"This would be a great hot summer lawnmower type beer. I'll definitely consider it again when I'm looking for that frisbee/volleyball summer beer."
"Overall?... not much bad to say about the taste that is present, rather there's a lot of taste that is LACKING."
"A: Golden/yellow with decent head retention. Some lacing. S: Some lighter malts, a distant hop aroma. Nothing huge. T: Huge presence of strawberries. maybe it was just this cask, but I'm having hard differentiating anything else. There's a slightly hop dry finish, but not much to speak of. M: Coarse, light, refreshing. D: The balance is a bit off, the fruit taste is a bit overpowering, but overall it's a nice light beer for a hot day."
"-GAPit"
"Drinkability; all day if necessary, with no regrets."
" This is pretty drinkable, definitely sessionableif you like the style. This came in a variety 12 pack and it was okay I guess, but to purchase this on it's own - not."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking session ale."
"D - Pretty high for me, this is a refreshing beer that is very easy to down. Not too complex, but a good beer nonetheless."
"Try this beer if you like redhook. Not great, not bad."
"a good enough blonde. my only issue was what i said above."
"Tasty, clean flavor with a fresh accent and smooth, easy finish. Not much more than crystal malts and medium nobles but it works, especally in warm weather (it was 83 degrees yesterday. In the middle of October...). High drinkability. Good for the style."
"Have this brew left over from the summer. In my opinion on a warm day this brew is pretty tasty and refreshing. The brew pours to a golden color that is pretty vibrant. Has a nice sized white head that seems to break down quite quickly but did leave a little lacing at the top of the glass. The aroma that comes to mind quickly is sweet, but not in a way that is overpowering, but dominant and I would imagine this is from the malts as well as having a slight fruit like ester to it. All in all it is a lighter brew and the aromas seem to fit the bill. The taste is similar to the aroma, nothing really new here but does have a slight dough/bread flavoring. This is a light (please do not confuse my portrayal of light as equaling most mass produced light beers) beer that is very refreshing, easy to drink on warmer days. I am glad to have this one in the summer pack, but would be a little upset if this was in the winter pack offering."
"pours a lager like golden light color with a small white head, a decent amount of head. smells slightly citrusy, it does have some great hoppiness to it, taste is like a lager and an ale got it on and made a pretty decent beer. has a nice slight maltiness to it but also a laggery type hopness. not a bad beer, redhook makes some good affordable beers and this one is no exception."
"Medium gold color. Decent white head that fizzes out somewhat quickly. Smells like a beer that's not trying to be something other than a beer. No stupid fruity odors. No excessive hoppyness. Just a pleasant somewhat sweet aroma. If this beer was a breakfast cereal it would be Golden Grahams. Nice amount of carbonation and texture. This is a quite drinkable brew. I like it."
"Drinkability: Blah. This beer is hardly worth even trying. There are no outstanding characteristics to speak of and it's affiliated with Bud. Stop trying to pass this off as a microbrew. k thx bye"
"When poured, the color was a medium dark yellow with very little foam and no lace what so ever! The smell of hops and spice was evident in the aroma coming out of the glass. The taste of hops had a weak flavor and the spice tasted like corriander that was weak. Not well balanced and the flavor was boring, boring, boring."
"Served with nearly no head in a 32 oz glass mug. Pale yellow in color and nearly clear. Very little aroma. Taste is light with just a hint of hops. Slight wheat flavor.not bad for a lawnmower beer."
"Poured a hazy golden color with very little head that dissipated rather quickly. Not much aroma to speak of at all. Thin body with watery mouthfeel. Fairly pedestrian blonde ale that neither offends nor really satisfies, unfortunately. Much better than a macro-brew but what isnt? Bland."
"nothing too remarkable about this beer either, but it certainly has enough flavor to make it onto my list again. nothing stands out as bad either. A good macro, all around, but nothing fantastic"
"Overall, there's really not much to say. This beer doesn't really have any downsides other than a lack of upsides. I certainly wouldn't turn a bottle of this down, as it's fairly refreshing, but there isn't anything which would make me seek it out."
"Overall- I had to take a step back when reviewing this beer. I wasn't prepared for something so light going in. However, it was actually quite good considering the style. It isn't something I would seek out, but the next time I'm in the mood for something on the lighter side it is something I would consider."
"Smells of a light sweet malt and fruitiness, a little diacetyl and hop. Pours medium straw  clear  mild head that is creamy. Tastes crisp with malt sweetness, fruitiness, and hops  medium-low to low hop flavor  medium bitterness  low malt sweetness  pretty light and watery. Finishes with low bitterness  mostly clean. Thin body and medium carbonation. Overall Impression: light, refreshing, easy-to-drink beer. Good for thirsty summer afternoons. Doesnt taste like much, but I suppose its not supposed to. Redhook delivered what they advertised: an average American Blond Ale."
"Da: not too bad."
"Bland, bland, bland. Are Redhook's better days long past them?"
"Redhook Blonde Ale was a golden color with good clarity. It had an off-white head with decent retention and left a little lacing behind. The aroma was sweet malt with a touch of hops. The taste was sweet malt with some hop flavor thrown in. The finish was dry. It was medium bodied with medium carbonation. Drinkability was good. This is a nice ale, It would make a good session beer."
"4-13-08: Drank this from tap, easy drinking beer"
"Unremarkable but unoffensive."
"The brew pouerd from a 12 oz bottle dark gold with a big foarmy head and light lacing. Nose of citrus and light malts, and slight aroma of hops. Mouthfeel was light and flavor follows the nose with a little corn taste. Not much finish. Overall a fairly unremarkable beer."
"D-nice summer beer. not one to drink to fast or too slow."
"Drinkability: Another middle of the road offering from redhook which I think would be great for the non-craft beer drinker and also occasionally for the craft beer drinker who is looking for something basic or for a change of pace."
"Appearance is golden in color with a white head that disapates quickly. Smell and taste pretty much the same of sweet malt with a good crispness to it with a healthly carbonation. Having a light mouthfeel This is a simple ale and a good choice for the warmer months when looking for something refreshing."
"Surprisingly good for a Redhhook. (tho I like the ESB and Porter, too)."
"The word blonde doesnt quite get it, maybe golden amber hue as this describes the color of th body much better. With a light tan head that doesnt stay around long. Very zesty mineral induced nose but not special. Enters the mouth sharply with a slightly soured silky mineral feel. Nuttines is also present. Mouthfeel is oddly thick for this type of beer but nicely welecome. fineshes with a slight wheat bitter. Overall enjoyable."
"Drinkability: its harmlessness is offset by its relative vacuousness; I'm not sure I could describe this beer to you tomorrow it's so nondescript"
"Drinkability is only slighty inhibitied by the over sweetness."
"Oh well, Im rating it as a tasty blonde ale."
"Cheers!"
"Notes: Red Hook could do better. A disappointing effort."
"peace...bc"
"Dirty blonde color. Minimal head but some nice retention. Light body. Some grain and faint wheat fllavors. Solidly malty but enough hops for a crisp dry finish. Simple and highly drinkable. Easy finish. A little boring but that might be what you are looking for."
"The malts are a bit more assertive when tasted as they come across ascaramel and toast. Just enough hop dryness for balance and a clean finish. The butter is gone. The mouth is light and spritzy. This would make for a decent hot weather beer."
"Overall, a good no-brainer beer with some easily accessible taste."
"It's crisp and refreshing, so if I ever have to settle for it again on a hot day, I won't be disappointed. It's just too sweet and kind of bland. There's not much complexity in this one. The ESB is still my preferred Redhook ale."
"12 ouncer, ""Bottled"" dating etched onto label of 08 07 06, pours light, yellow and clear, with a white head, grassy and slightly skunky nose leads things off. Light brew, more moldy grass notes. sort of a cloying, oily, over dry mouthfee. Drink this one super cold and you should be fine, semi-micro lawn mower beer, not the best one in the sampler box it came in. The last 1/3 of this was a drain pour, not worth the calories and alcohol..."
"D - I find it very drinkable. It isn't going to overload you with flavors or hops but is a very good easy drinking beer."
"Yellow gold colored with a fairly weak, white head. Smells like cheap, sweet malt. Taste is generic and malty, with some scarecly detectable hops, a faint creamy taste, and a slightly rusty/metalic aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly crisp. Somehow, drinkability is not suffering too bad... I must be thirsty. Overall I don't hate this beer because it is cold and refreshing, but I'm not going to pretend that it's better than it is."
"Pours a light gold color, with a one-finger fizzy head. Shows poor retention and a few streaks of sticky lacing. Pilsener malt and fruity wine aroma. Pale malt and pilsener sweetness upfront, followed by a vinous yeast flavor. Dry aftertaste, hints of saaz or tettnanger. Light and crisp, but shows traces of diacetyl. Finishes with a lingering dry white wine flavor. The yeast character seems too dramatic for the malt and the hops are almost non-existent. Unbalanced with a strange oily mouthfeel... mabye Redhook should have used soft water and more hops and called It a Kolsch."
"This beer poured a golden color with little to no head. There was a light lacing on the glass however. The beer has a sweet mellow smell but not much else. The taste is crisp and malty like you would expect with a hint of a wheat grainy quality. It does have a little bit of an aftertaste that is slightly on the bitter side. Almost a soapy flavor. The beer had a crisp feel with an over all light body. In all not a bad blonde. Very drinkable."
"First sampling 7-17-05: An ordinary attept by an ordinary brewery of an ordinary style. Smells lightly sweet, corn like, grainy, and earthy. Tastes like corn sugar powdered sugar. A little like buttered popcorn. Mild hop character gives little earthy and bitterness. Mild body that reveals graininess and a little astringency. Continues to water as it travels across the palate. Finishes sharp and abrupt, but crisp."
"Clean on the palate with a refreshing carbonation bite. Very good beer for the summer months. Fine, drinkable beer."
"D- This beer his light and crisp and has many lager qualities but it doesn't have the nice depth of malt and the hops are punch and bland."
"Redhook Blone pours a nice golden color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is good, a bit malty, some hops are also evident. Tastes okay, nothing too earth shattering, but quite drinkable. Nice malt backbone with some hop toward the end. Worth a try, might be a decent session beer."
" Light to medium bodied. Active carbonation. Crisp, clean mouthfeel. Drinkable? Yes."
"A simple golden blond ale. Not something I'd normally go after, but on a warm summer day or just hanging out watching the game, a great session beer."
"Pours a clear, yellowish gold, with a small head starting out fading to nothing, little lacing to speak of. Faint aroma, can't even pick up enough to tell what it is. A light body makes this easy to drink, but there really isn't much to taste, little malt presense, hop unnoticable. Better than piss beer, to be sure, but still no reason to have this again. Would be a good one for doing something on a hot afternoon."
"M/D: It has a medium-light body with almost high carbonation. Pretty much what I was expecting, easy drinking, sessionable, and refreshing."
"I could see myself enjoying these from an ice bucket while on the beach on a nice summer day. A good solid choice amongst beers to relax with."
"Poured a pale golden color with massive chunky white head. Smell is minimal with a slight bready maltiness noted. Taste porsents more hops than malt and is fairly pleasant. Finishes with more dryness than maltiness and is enjoyable. A nice easy drinking beer, but nothing exceptional."
"A nice drinkable ale. Would be a nice first ale for lager drinkers."
"Overall impression: Pretty basic beer, but this one is very drinkable. Probably a good cross-over beer for your macro friends."
"Malty beers like this seem to coat my mouth and this one does the same. A little hop dryness in the aftertaste. Easy to drink."
"At first I didn't know what I was drinking, so it was a guessing game. I figured it was something light, and guessed a summer beer. When I finally looked at the keg, I realized that I was essentially right. Redhook Blonde is not the most flavorful beer, but what is there is very pleasant. There is a slight wheat taste with a hint of lemon, that makes it a very drinkable beer to have several of. The freshness of the keg was a big positive, for this beer was crisp and enjoyable. I can picture myself sitting outside during the disgustingly humid months of Boston drinking one after an another."
"Overall: Unremarkable. Not really sure why this one is rated an ""80."""
"Pours a two-finger white head that fades quickly leaving a good lace. Chrystal clear amber color. No nose. Good carbonation and light-medium bodied. Starts with hints of sweetness some hop bite, finish is clean, would be a good summer beer. $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Capital Convenience Concord, NH."
"Overall, i dont hate this beer, but i wont get it again. just not enough here."
"Pours a dark straw to light golden color with a 3 finger head that falls to a very solid finger over top. Clarity is excellent and only sparse bubbles from the bottom well up. Nose is moderately strong in noble hop spicey and herbal qualities. Malt character is pretty light behind this. I'm only getting a touch of a grainyness. Not a lot going on. Flavor is lightly dought and bready, with a touch of floral noble hop character, and a lightly bitter finish. The flavors are not melding real well for me on this one. Mouthfeel is light with a light to moderate carbonation. I'd like a much healthier carbonation to keep this one from just feeling flat overall. Drinkability is just okay on this one. The flavors seem to be fighting each other with the doughyness and the noble hop just not blending well. The feel seems off with the carbonation not balancing. This is one I don't see in my future."
"This beer pours a golden yellow with a thin white head that leaves a little film and a little lace. The smell is a sweet buttery malty smell. The taste is mild barley malts with somewhat of a buttery aftertaste. Good carbonation but the thickness is just average. Overall a decent beer but I wouldnt be apt to picking it up again"
"Dated 050905 and it's been in my cupboard since last Aug. or Sept. (Cupboard is dark and cool at all times.) Aroma is disctinctly nice light malty, can't smell hops but my smeller is bad and it's a bit colder than it should be, and it's not supposed to have much anyway. Color medium gold. Bottle conditioned, slight floaties are just fine. Flavor -- nice balance, on the malt side. Very slightly fruity, just enough hops to balance but not enough to notice. All things delicate and well balanced. Mouthfeel is pleasant, body but lightness and a dry finish. Overall impression is good, drinkability is dangerous. (It seems to have less alcohol than it does.)"
"Dnot much flavor, but could be very good after working in the yard. This might be a good transition beer for those who are just starting the craft journey. There are some macro pilsner similarities, but just enough hints to craft to possibly seduce someone to the dark side."
"This newly re-designed bottle of Redhook Blonde might as well be any basic macro in my opinion. Same color, taste, etc. Pours a fizzy yellow with a faint hint of fruity ale sweetness. But that seems to be the only distinguishing ""ale"" feature of this beer. Bland, boring macro taste, with no hop profile to speak of. So many other fine ales to choose at this price that Redhook beers aren't worth the time. Too bad."
"This is a very drinkable beer. It would be particularly good on a hot summer day, maybe even garnished with a small slice of lemon."
"Drinkability here reflects taste. I wouldn't turn this down at a party. Not a bad beer at all."
"My friend who normally does not like beer was estatic about this one. This is a good cross over beer. Give it a try."
"In summary, I think that Redhook Blonde Ale is an above average beer product. I think it will appeal to most drinkers, at least as an occasional summertime quaff. Its nothing exceptional, but its good enough to throw back a few on a warm day to quench your thirst while you anticipate something a little better."
"Bottled 8 Aug 05 Pours a clear golden color, some carbonation, very small head, light lacing afterwards. Scents of hops, malt, sweet, and grassy. Nice taste kinda sweet with a little bit of a hop flavor, smooth feeling. Light body. Very drinkable, a good reprecitation of the style. Would recommend."
"Pretty good. Not mind-blowing, but very drinkable. Recommended."
"I really wonder how people would review this beer if they didn't know AB was involved. If one reviews this beer objectively and according to style, you should find it pretty good. It's a blonde ale, and well made. I would have this again, if offered."
"The drinkability of this beer is pretty good. I'd have another, but this is my last blonde ale from a Redhook sampler case."
"Not my favorite kind of beer, but this does it's business well, and I hope it is enjoyed by those kind of people who enjoy this kind of beer."
"This brew pours a clear golden color with a small white head the recedes within seconds. The aroma is thin, and malty. The taste is almost as thin as the smell, but not quite. There is a faint malt flavor, but nothing else. The mouthfeel is light bodied and over carbonated. The carbonation actually burns my tongue as I drink. Overall, this beer just isn't my thing. It might be appealing to the average macro drinker, as I am sure it is meant to be, but to a craft beer drinker this brew doesn't have enough of all things that make beer great."
" Finished smooth and easy. I'll have this again next spring when the BBQ season starts. Good."
"Drinkability: The beer, despite its simplicity (or maybe due to its simplicity) was very drinkable and I could have had one or two more right on the spot. Part of that is that I kept want it to blossom into something more significant on my palate. The other aspect is that the beer is consistent from start to finish."
"This is very watery going down. Not Good, not recommended"
"Drinkability- Very drinkable blonde ale. Had this one right before bed. Cooled me down with this hot weather we are having. Smooth, crisp and tasty. Very much a nice session ale."
"Appearance pale yellow/gold with a foamy head that produces a little lace. Aroma is of cooked corn, and hops. Initial taste starts with malt, citrus, yeasty, buttery diacetyl, and wheat. Finish is dry and clean. I have tried it on tap, and it is better. A so  so blonde ale  there are better examples out there."
"ending up pouring the rest of this beer down the drain. This is a very rare situation. I think only the 2nd time since I began reviewing on Beer Advocate."
"Carbohydrates / 12 oz.: 13.1 g."
"Mouthfeel is average decent carbonation and fairly light bodied. Drinkability is a touch above average. One could session this beer as it is an inoffensive, medium flavourful ale. I would not rush out and buy this, but it was a decent fall back when the other choices were beers I dont like or refuse to drink ( Stella)"
"pours an orange yellow color and is super clear. seeing the world through a pissy filter as i stare through the glass. cool. bubbly. crisp. flowery sweet smell. what a fresh taste.. honey notes are obvious and vanilla a little less so. hop kick in the back end.. surprising but welcome. mild though, no complaints here. finishes dry.. overall refreshing. puts hooker blonde to the test, fo real."
"12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a medium gold color with one finger of head. A little bit of lacing going on. The aroma is grassy, with a slight amount of pale maltiness and just a touch of hops. It almost smells like a pilsener. The taste is about the same. Light grassy and malty flavors with just a little bit of hops. The mouthfeel is decent for a blonde ale, and the drinkability is ok as well. It's there."
"What the hell, I got a couple for free from a neighbor... who am I to say no to free beer? It wasn't that bad for the price *L*"
"Tastes sweet like bread yeast, nice but not complicated. There's a slight chemical aftertaste that some might not like all that much, but it grows on you after a few sips."
"Cheers!"
"The beer pours a gold color with a 1/4"" white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a grainy pale and carapils malt scent with a fruity yeast finish; refreshing. The taste is decent. It has a dry pale malt flavor with a slightly fruity and grainy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a low bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a good drinking American blonde despite it's flaws."
"Pours a medium golden, clear with a small amount of carbonation and a thin head. Aroma is semi-sweet, bready-yeasty. Plain, inoffensive, generally nice without a lot more to say. Flavor is slightly sweet, creamy and a hint of citrus. Minimal hops. Mouthfeel is moderate, generally pleasant. This beer is a nice drinker- nothing amazing going on, but hey, it sure beat the other selections on tap!!!! Enjoy it when you aren't looking for anything complex, just a nice drinkable beer."
"Looks great: deep gold color with a blanket-like foam, leaving bits of white lace everywhere. Faint flowery aromas, grassy, grainy, with hints of citrus. Foretaste moderately is doughy and bread-like. Moderate to high carbonation, with exceedingly small bubbles. Crisp finish. The brew has a somewhat thin in the heft department, and in on the sweet side. Middle of the road."
"If you are looking for ""refreshing", then I'd recommend giving this a try. It doesn't have tons of character, but that is probably part of what makes it so easy to drink it - it just goes down."
"The taste is light and crisp, with hops, wheat, and grassy tones. This is a nice light brew, some distinctiveness to separate it from the herd but nothing offensive."
"One inch of bubbly, coarse foam dies fast. A dark gold, mostly clear beer has tons of carbonation. The smell is buttery, dusty and a bit sour with some fruit. Front is fruity, grainsy, leading to a tangy middle showing light caramel and some butter. The nutty finish is very fruity, bitter. There seems to be a touch of metal and a little chemical. Not bad. A grainsy, fruity blonde."
"Clear gold color, medium, fast falling head. Lemon citrus hops in the nose. Taste is dominated by a strong malt presence, with some sour hops accompaniament, A fairly big beer, for being a redhook. Wheat graininess present. Well carbonated, and refreshing, just like the bottle says."
"Very drinkable; refreshing and light. I'd probably get tired of drinking this all night, but it's a decent tasting blonde."
"Overall, however, a refreshing ale for summer!"
"Actually, this is pretty good for the style. Easy to drink with enough substance to maintain my interest...better than most blondes at brewpubs. This would be a good session brew for hanging with friends and shooting the shit."
"Appearance: Honey golden hue off white cream tinted frothy head leaves sporadic specks of lacing. Aroma: Biscuit malts plus 2 row pale malts, touch of honey and fruit character, hint of alcohol and wheat not bad. Taste: A clean semi flavorful Bud-Hook product nice for sipping on in session flavor is reserved mild hops semi sweet with a touch of honey for the malt profile relatively clean and nonofffensive. Mouthfeel: Lighter body easy carbonation nothing too special to note. Drinkability: Not a bad chill and watch the game type of beer, light crisp decent flavored blonde ale."
"Little head with an aggressive pour, but leaves attractive creamy lacing, on top of a fairly clear light orange-gold body. The aroma is malt with sweetness, pretty faint. Gentle carbonation on the tongue and a light body accompanies a nonchalant malty flavor with a hint of hops. It picks up on the way down as wheat emerges, finishing fruity on the citrus side. Boring, except for the finish, which is a little too strong. It is refreshing and easy-going but not commendable in any other way."
"Not a bad summer sipper (or should I say guzzler...?) I drank mine rather quick, without realizing it. I'd say burgers with garlic toasted buns and homemade macaroni salad is in order."
"Light Gold with a decent head this is an easydrinking ale with just enough hops to let you know that this isn't Henry Weinhards. Give this to your Bud drinking friend and hope that he or she likes this better as we all need to start our beer journey somewhere."
"Strong example of the lightest ale style. Good ""initiation"" ale"
"This is another good beer that makes no since to me. Everything about it is average, except the taste, which is pretty good, but it's so damn drinkable. Maybe it's a break from all those heavy brews or something. Anyways, it's got a well balanced taste of malts and hops, mixed with wheat. There's no real overbearing taste that is in charge, but I guess that makes it good. I will say though, that it is just like a heavier version of a cheaper brew. One thing for sure is that it is quite creamy."
"This beer definitely lacks aroma. It poured a small sized white, smooth, creamy head that consisted of fine-small sized bubbles that fully dissipated. The body was slightly cloudy and carbonated with a yellow hue. The nose was that of very little malt and hops with a sweet, hoppy and malty flavor to it. It was smooth and tingly on the palate and was light-medium bodied."
"Drinkability  It almost crossed the line from drinkable to sinkable, but I think Ill stick with it."
"Very nice smell of tiny hops and a little malt. Very smooth taste almost buttery like a wheat but only a little. Good bold flavor more than I expected in the finish a little sweet!!"
"Yellow gold color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is grainy, grassy and sweet. Lightly hopped, lightly malted. Well balanced. A mild pilsner with good flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth and clean. Aftertaste is slightly malty, no bitterness."
"I am rather underwhelmed by this beer. It's not horrible, but it just needs a cleaner hops presence and more malt to help balance it out. I must say that it does go down easily, even with the rough mouthfeel and the flavor problems."
"Flavor is sweetly malty, light, with mild unassuming hoppiness rounding out the end. A light floral fruitiness, with some lemon and pear. A bit of buttery diacetyl flavor in the middle. Clean flavors, well balanced. Light body, with a crisp carbonation. A bit more carbonated than I'd like, leaving me pretty burpy. Not terrible by any means, but nothing special."
"Another ""summer quaffer."" A little tart at first, but then the malt kicks in to mellow things out a bit. Slightly citric and a little thin, but not too much so. Faint impression of melon in the background. Nothing special, but quite drinkable and refreshing."
"Very pale in appearance with a basic lacing, clarity is fine. Faint aroma of malt and very clean with not much going on. Big on crispness with a tight but light pale malt body. Quick bitter kiss of hops keeps the brew in balance, hints of dough biscuits and husky grain in the finish. A decent extra pale ale, nothing to go crazy over."
"Translucent golden hue, served with a small white head. Decent retention it produced some specks of lace. Crisp nose with buttery hints odd, and not very inviting. The invitation of the bouquet matched the palate perfectly (unfortunately), it had almost uncontrollable buttery diacetyl flavor. Distant hops, wheat-like malt backbone. Lackluster and almost offensive. Medium-light body, creamy mouthfeel. Did I get a bad sample? Id like to try it out of a bottle, maybe. This wasnt enjoyable at all"
"I thought this beer would pour more of lighter color but it didnt. It poured a dark gold, almost the color of apple juice. There was a tight white foam head on top of the beer but it left pretty fast and left a very patchy lace. The aroma was grassy mixed with malt and hints of wheat. There are also light hints of citrus mixed in. Nothing that really stands out with the aroma. The taste is pleasant. A sweet start with a neutral mid swallow and the grassy/citrus hop finish. A good beer for a hot day but nothing to special with this one. Slightly above average."
"This beer pours a light amber color and has little head and almost no lacing. Very cool color. The aroma is malty with a hint of citrus, but not very strong. The flavor is a little sour and a little bitter at the same time - some hints of citrus also. There's nothing too special about this beer - I didn't not particularly like the flavor, but it wasn't really bad, just not my style."
"This is a pretty good looking beer that pours out a hazy pale amber or dark gold with a yellowish white head. The head is minimal and diminishes to a haze quickly, but manages decent lace deposits. Continual streams of small bubbles make this an active beer with a crsip mouthfeel. The flavor is mostly malty with a bit of hop balance. The nose is light and mostly malt with a hint of citrus. Slightly sour finishing taste. Good beer in a pinch; look for the distinctive red and yellow Redhook name on labels gracing the squat bottle."
"This is an extraordinarily average beer. It is quite good looking however. Orange, cloudy, smal bubbles, and small head. Lightly malty aroma with mild citrus. Round orangy, lightly roasted flavor. Very light bitterness. Light mouthfeel. Does not have much of an aftertaste."
"Though having said this its very very easy to drink in large quantities."
"Bright white head on top of a pale golden colored body. Head is moderate in size and retention. Flavor and aroma is mostly light sweet malts and almost hidden flavors of banana, vanilla, and wheat are somewhere in there too. Fairly drinkable and thirst quenching. I threw these down almost too fast to enjoy."
"Pours a bright golden color with a creamy white head that fades into a nice amount of lace. Nose is quite clean with mostly malt aromas. Light in body and very crisp and refreshing. Taste is lots of sweet malt up front with a bit of fresh wheat. Some light and buttery fruity notes are also present followed by some spicy and citrusy hops. A nice brew for a warm afternoon like today."
"Cheers"
"Pour is clear golden, small white head, very minimal lacing. Aroma is sweet, some banana and slight citrus. Flavor is very sweet, lots of banana and some other fruitiness. No reall hoppiness to note. Fairly thin and watery. Nothing in this brew that would make me go back for a second."
"This brew hits the glass with a nice citrus deep yellow color. A foamy white head rises from the bubbly bounty under it. A nice Saaz aroma pertrudes from the Klages and munich malts giving it a non-offensive invite to the beginner. To the veteran brew mizer, the complex combination of malt and hop without creating any off flavors, grants immediate respect to it's creator. Overall, a well-liked ale with some lager tendencies."
"The quintessential blonde beer color, of course a pleasing to the eye crystal clear gold color, the head impressive in size, frothy in texture, bright white and the lace fine sheets to cover the glass. Malt dominates the nose, clean, fresh and pleasant enough. Lightly sweet at the front, skeletal top, bitingly acidic finish that has a decent hop presence, dry aftertaste and a good Lawn mowing beer."
"dark golden, or light copperish in color. a slight head and lace. a malty aroma without any really discernible big hop aroma that i like in my ales. malty tastes are of the lightly roasted variety, with a bit of hop balance. mouthfeel is ok...i detect a somewhat buttery tone to the profile, with a somewhat pronounced hop bitterness in the finish. this blonde ale is just average in every aspect. i suppose it would make a nice session brew in spite of it's 5.37 ABV. i need to be drinking this as a summer quencher instead of in the month of december in the northland. thanks to NODAK for providing this in our beer trade."
"Draught version. Golden colored with a medium head that lasted fairly long, also lively carbonation. Sweet yeasty/citrusy aroma that bordered on a German Wheat. Light and refreshing if a little on the sweet side. I did enjoy this one somewhat, but mostly because I got it on tap. I'm not sure how well this would translate to a bottle."
"Redhook’s Blonde Ale pours to a golden color, with an off-white head that quickly dissipates.  The carbonation level within this drinkable beer is decent, it does not attack the tongue.  The aroma is somewhat a floral, spiciness.  The malt/hop flavor is well balanced within this beer, neither one outweighs the other.  Overall Redhook Blonde Ale is a very drinkable beer which I would drink again."
"Along with SN Summerfest this  is one of my favorite summertime quenchers, and, IMO one of the better products RedHook makes.  It pours a dark blonde (hint of amber) in the glass with a two finger fizzy white head that rapidly disappears.  The aroma is very slight, a trace of fruitiness but that's all.  Taste is dominated by sweet (but not overly sweet) cereal maltiness.   Hops is in the background but noticeable.  This beer finishes with a refreshing dryness.  What a shame, this was my last bottle until next summer.  This is how macro flagship beers SHOULD taste."
"Crisp and refreshing. Pours out to a bright, golden color.  Not a complex beer, but rather straightforward.  Not meant to be an IPA, but rather a light, session ale.  A quaffable thirst quencher.  A good beer to introduce to those who drink macro beers."
"Three finger effervescent head tops a rich gold body which reveals a steady stream of carbonation. Lemon dominates the aroma, with some vegetables in the mix. A nice malty taste is balanced by a zing of wheat, and a snippet of hops. Surprisingly full mouthfeel.  Intended as a summer quencher, it fills that job admirably. A lawnmower beer for microfans. I went thru 3 with my wife's Mexican Chicken Casserole'."
"The beer pours clear golden and has a nice frothy white head that retains nicely.  It has a nice little malty aroma.  Nothing substantial about the taste however.  Fairly bland.  Maybe a bit of a lemon like zest to it.  Very little malt character and no hop accents to speak of.  Light body.  I could easily drink more than one of these, but I wouldn't seek it out and would prefer many other light colored beers over this one."
"Appearance is right on with the style, quality lacing. Nose is sulphur and hop combined to give the impression of ones well-used hockey gloves. Decent hop presence, but the malt manifests itself with a grainy character. Although not downright awful, I won't be purchasing Redhook Blonde again. Try Rogue's Oregon Golden Ale if you're interested in this style."
"I'm not really a fan of golden ales to begin with, but I thought I'd give this one a shot.  Nice clear goledn color adn foamy white head, biscuity aroma and flavor.  maybe it was in the bottle too long, but it seemed the hops were off a bit.  I think I'll try it at the brewery and see what's really happening here."
"Slight nose of malt/wheat.  Not very good retention or head at all..  Clear gold in color.  Not a ton of flavor.. just very clean and crisp beer.  There is not enough character in the  brew for my taste.  Nothing stands out as special."
"Pale, sub-amber appearance.  Frothy head, bumpy on the inside of the pint glass.  Subtle aroma, slightly yeasty/bready.  Light-bodied mouthfeel, just a hint of maple/honey to the malty tastes.  Hops are hardly present but the mild malts don't throw the beer remarkably out of balance.  Flavor is almost gone by the swallow.  Blondes are blondes in the world of beer, I'll always take one over a detergent-tasting macro but not too much interesting here.  Certainly is easy on the tongue and drinkable."
"Blonde ale is one of Redhook's triptych of seasonal beers, along with Winterhook, and Nut Brown Ale.  It is usually available in the late spring and summer."
"Had this for the first time in a long time @ The Times, downtown Boston. It was okay. Quite the drinkable and clean product, but it also had quite a bit of diacetyl, which is not cool for the style."
"Notes: Quite complex for a light beer. Much different from our bright tank samples at the brewery which were less stripped and fuller -- none the less very enjoyable."
