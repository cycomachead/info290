Taste is strongly balanced leaning towards the grain and malt bill. Bread, fresh grain, balanced hop, faint soapy, balanced citrus hop, gentle bitterness. Carbonation is great, body is light and airy with a semi dry finish. Could be a bit brighter but darn this is drinkable and balanced.

Not particularly bitter, this is drying on the finish with a fruity bitterness and a mild grapefruit pith-like bitterness. Very nice stuff, this is extremely sessionable.","DefenCorps","Aug 25, 2012"
4.33,2.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a hazy light yellow with a medium white head. Smell is a really nice citrusy hop with bready malt in the background. Not quite as nice of an aroma as LWP, but still rather impressive. I think it might get a 4.5 if I wasn't comparing the two. Flavor, however, is more impressive than LWP. It's a little bigger and maltier than LWP but with a similar hop profile. It almost comes off like a baby version of Heady Topper. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is another great hoppy beer from HF and one I prefer (slightly) to LWP.","starrdogg","Aug 25, 2012"
4.42,4.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer is light golden yellow with a soft, white head. The aroma is great, offering some citrus and tropical fruits.

The smell is great and again reminds me of a hoppy citrus pale ale, with a light honey malt backbone to it. The taste has a big malt backbone with some grassy hop notes and a touch of citrus, lemon grass that reminds me of gumball head though not as aggressive. The feel is nice and light, ok carbonation.

This is quite a summertime offering that I could throw a growler full back easily by myself without regret. My only real cause for concern here is that in the past 2 months I have now tried 5 different hoppy beers by Hill Farmstead that are new to me. Each and every one of them despite being an IPA, DIPA, Pale ale or hoppy blonde all have a dominating straw character to them that stands out more than I would expect. I guess that's just HF's house character? I recently got to try 2 other brewer's takes on using the Motueka hop and despite knowing that was in this brew it just doesn't come out to me... nor does the amarillo.","stakem","Aug 05, 2012"
