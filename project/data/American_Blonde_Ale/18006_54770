Slightly foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, pine, wheat, bread, grass, and floral hops. Very nice and pleasant aromas with good strength, balance, and hop complexity. Taste of orange zest, grapefruit, pineapple, wheat, bready grain, light pine, citrus rind, floral, grass, and herbal earthiness. Light citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pineapple, wheat, bready grain, light pine, citrus rind, floral, grass, and herbal on the finish for a short bit. Very nice flavor balance with a good amount of hop flavors; zero cloying flavors present on the finish as expected. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol warming is pretty much invisible, with hardly anything present on the finish as expected. Overall this is a damn nice blonde ale! Very nice hoppy flavor with good malt balance; and extremely easy to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 02, 2013"

Smell- there is a floral aroma..reminds me of potpourri and popcorn. Buttery aroma. Orange peel as well. Taste- mild bitterness with an unwanted soapy experience. somewhat watery. A little coriander, lemon peel. This lacks body, sweetness, and is a little high on carbonation. I suppose if in the summer, this would drink well from the can if it was a little colder.

The nose is a blast of florality, as though a small meadow had been pressed into my cup, which had been previously lined with some light buttery caramel. The taste toned down the florals by a fair degree, leaving some fossils to be gazed at while munching on some watered-down caramel corn. Basically, tone down a Daisy Cutter a bit, and you'll be left with this. That doesn't mean I dislike this flavor, by any stretch,, it's just a way to describe it. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a refreshing feel. Overall, a very nice, sessionable blonde. Good times down at Half Acre, I tells ya.","TMoney2591","Sep 05, 2010"

The aromas that had been in existence to give it that extra pop were not very evident. As was agreed on by the others in my party, this tasted like a toned-down Daisy Cutter. There was a wheatlike breadiness to it that was surprising due to the relative clarity of the beer. It sat rather well in the mouth. The carbonation was spot on, and you can't say anything against the freshness of it.

The malt has a dry cracker like quality. Very clean taste. Bitterness is higher than most as well. Light body and nicely carbonated. Feels lively and does not linger on the palate for long.

3.6,-3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Drinkability is good. Not a lot going on with this beer, but the flavor has some decent citrus to it, the body is fairly crisp and the ABV is low. So a pint or two of this would be easy on a hot day.","sisuspeed","Jun 20, 2010"
4.32,15.8,4,4.5,4,4,5,"Tastes light with a hoppy bitterness up front and a watery, slightly nutty sweet malt finish with a bit of floral honey character throughout. Very fresh, clean flavors and well-balanced. Large, rounded and slightly tingly carbonation accentuates an otherwise light body. Drinks like water. I might wish for a little more flavor somewhere in the middle of it all, otherwise this is a perfect summer beer. Glad to have tried it.","abuliarose","Jun 18, 2010"
3.67,-1.6,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Nothing like a big blonde! I got two fingers' worth of French Vanilla-colored head off of my initial pour, which I had to back off of lest it spill over the rim of the glass. Color was a slightly hazy golden yellow (and remember, boys and girls, clarity is over-rated). Nose had a fruity sweetness, like tangerine or melon or both. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was fruity, but drier than the nose had led me to expect. Finish lingered with a pleasant fruitiness. This would be good on a hot day in the sun, especially given its low ABV, but conversely, it was not exciting enough to warrant seeking out for the cooler.","woodychandler","Jun 10, 2010"
4.1,9.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Mouthfeel is light and the carbonation is on the higher side. Drinkability is good, it has some very nice flavors to it. The crisp citrus flavor was particularly nice and made it a pretty nice and refreshing beer. overall a very nice, flavorful and well balanced beer.","billab914","Jun 03, 2010"
3.87,3.8,3.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Nicely easy-drinking. At 4.20%abv (dude!) this one is definitely sessionable.","coldmeat23","May 26, 2010"
4.1,9.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This was very tasty. A light Golden Ale with a fresh zesty profile and a super easy drinkibility to it. This one was a great choice for the tall-boy cans, as it's prefect for summer imbibing.","Kegatron","May 24, 2010"
2.9,-22.3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,3.5,"I had this on tap at Half Acre. The beer pours a light murky gold with a decent white head, nothing of note. The aroma is light hops pretty boring. The taste is bad, its a trumped of version of a bud light. Light hop, mostly skunk and a super light feel. Mouthfeel is water and not something I would drink more than half a pint of. Quite disappointing.","jrallen34","May 22, 2010"
4.2,12.6,4,4,4,4,5,"This is not a stand-out beer by any means, but is a great candidate for the cooler in the summer. Easy on the alcohol and somewhat easy on the wallet (in craft standards). Full flavored enough while still being incredibly easy to drink and refreshing. This is a great summer beer that will probably see a lot of cooler time from me this summer, whether it be concert tailgating, golfing, fishing, or chilling on the lake...cans are the way to go for the summer!!","hawks10","May 18, 2010"
4.01,7.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"As for drinkability: Half-Acre's version of a session ale truly hits the mark. It practically begs to be quaffed while relaxing on a porch. No other location would do it justice.","chicagobeerriot","May 09, 2010"
4.33,16.1,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Drinkability is immense. Not since Surly has a beer in a can been so good to me. Thanks again, Freddy - never heard of this beer before you, and I definitely seek it out next time I'm up in the Chi.","kels","Apr 27, 2010"
4.45,19.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"D: I've had the pleasure of enjoying this on draft, from a growler, and now from a can. I can say that (as soon as it is readily available around town, in cans) this will be my go to summer session ale. This is a wonderful, easy to drink, and flavorful Blonde Ale. Great work guys!","GbVDave","Apr 22, 2010"
3.63,-2.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"A freebie to take home from DLD, I think this can was from Masterski. The beer pours a pale orange color, slightly hazed, with a few fingers of yeast-cake-looking foam. The beer smells like a straightforward ale, clean with hops presenting as a bitter note rather than floral or citrus. The taste is likewise straightforward, grainy and toasty, again the bitterness in the aftertaste but not as strong as in the aroma. Light bodied and easy to pound. With the low ABV I'd call this a perfect summertime beer, not the most flavorful from Half Acre but that's not what they were shooting for.","TurdFurgison","Apr 21, 2010"
4.44,19,4,5,4.5,3,4.5,"D: I'd drink this as a session beer any day. It's not the most complex beer, but it's got a solid flavor that stays stable and refreshing until the end. I was pleasantly surprised when I remembered I hadn't poured the entire can, and that it survived warming up handily.","VerbingNouns","Apr 17, 2010"
3.65,-2.1,4,4,3,4.5,4,"D - If the aftertaste weren't as off-putting, I'd gladly put down a 4-pack in an hour or two. This would be perfect in the Wrigley bleachers as everything about it screams session. Love the 16oz tallboy cans, and the animal-friendly holders too.","MasterSki","Apr 15, 2010"
3.79,1.6,3,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"A great drinker and fairly impressive given the low ABV. I wish the flavor had lived up to the smell, but then it probably wouldn't be as great of a session beer.","bjacokes","Apr 14, 2010"
4.1,9.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Edit: Just got a low-fill can at the brewery, super fresh. There was a clear grassy hop note to the aroma, and a nice creamy feel also. Seems like they are hitting their stride with this one. Great summer session beer.","emerge077","Beers"
3.63,-2.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D - Highly drinkable, I'm not a big fan of this style of beer, but it is a pretty good take on it and easy to get down.","AgentZero","0"
4.27,14.5,3.5,4,4,5,5,"Light bodied and fairly crisp, not too thin, not too full, refreshing.","paco1029384756","Mar 28, 2010"
4.28,14.7,4,3.5,4.5,4,5,"Something weird was in the aroma... hiding underneath the hay and grassy hops. I couldn't quite figure it out and it wasn't appealing at first, but then the taste revealed it. Pretty distinctly sourdough bread contributing a little tanginess. Crackers and a little lemon rind. Really pleasant once I figured that out. Some grassy hops in the finish and just supremely drinkable. It really grew on me as I kept refilling my glass. I could drink this all day. Extremely flavorful and palatable for a beer of such small stature. Impressive.","Ineedabeerhere","Jan 15, 2010"
4.23,13.4,4.5,4,4,4,5,"The mouthfeel is very dry and light without being lifeless. The carbonation is at a high, refreshing level. I'm glad I got to drink a low abv beer that wasn't boring, even in between all the big stuff we were pouring this night. I would kill this growler no problem on my own. This was a good American style session beer, or "imperial session" for the English blokes.","jeffthecheff","Jan 12, 2010"
4.37,17.2,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Notes: This beer is probably too hoppy to be considered a bitter or mild, so I guess the brewery defined it as a "session ale."  I see it's listed as an American Blonde here, instead of any of those. I just hope they brew more in the warmer months. We need more flavorful low alcohol beers.","Maction","Jan 09, 2010"
4.43,18.8,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Libation: What can I say? This is an excellent ale. It has all the characteristics of what I'd want a great sessionable lager to be. Clean, drinkable and a complex flavor profile that does not try to assault the palate. It's unfortunate that so little of this was produced, it would be nice to see Half Acre offer this one again. Let's hope they do!","OttoBomb","Beers"
4.33,16.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Great beer, pours a bright golden hue. Thick, rocky white head. Intensely and pleasantly dry-hopped; not overwhelming. Very little malt in the aroma. Mouthfeel is fresh, satisfying and fufilling but not heavy or crisp, just right. This beer has some legs to it, very enjoyable. Hops stay with you throughout, fruity, citrusy, not dry. Great beer...not surprising from the guys at Half Acre, they're off to a great start. Cheers!","jayhopkins23","0"
