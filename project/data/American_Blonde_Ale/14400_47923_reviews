"O: recommended for hop heads who favor piney hops and plenty of grapefruity bitterness."

"I appreciated the American Pale Ale and it was a good representation of the style, as it was well-balanced. I would try it again and pair it with a dish like a steak salad, which I imagine would cut the fattiness and complement the citrus."

"I agree with BierJager89 But, I like it because it is a Spring Brew, it should be lighter. Great for a Seattle Spring day. this would be good for any social gathering celebrating the PNW spring and a great time to see how friends like it! It really helps to try this one on a Real Spring Day, especially after drinking all those fine winter ales!"

"O: It was a bit light for my taste, and the taste was not what I was hoping for and a bit disappointing after the nose. Still worth a try."

"Overall - Not a bad brew, but seems a little off for this style. Not bad in general though."
""
"Just a quick review of this beer - I was in awe by the color. It was a deep beautiful orange- I was expecting it to be a much more pale beer. The smell was floral and hoppy without much else being present. That's how it drank as well. Pretty simple, basic pale ale. I could see myself drinking these pretty easily, but not a beer I'd go out of my way to find."
""
""
""
"An interesting pale ale, or blonde, or whatever you want to call it. It seems more of an English take on the style, and with that in mind, is quite pleasant."
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty good beer. Some of the beers from this brewery are a bit hoppy for my taste, but this one is pretty close to what I prefer. It's also a bit more ale-like than some other ""blonde"" ales that I've tried."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a dark blonde color with a little white head on top. Smells super citrusy, yet full malts come through in the nose as well. The typical white grapefruit and evergreen hop tastes that we associate with Ninkasi are not restrained in this brew. Some roasted flavors combined with caramel and pale malts to provide a much stronger grain presence and bigger body than most blondes. This one is an American blonde that is not wimpy. One shade blonder than SNPA, with a hint of classic Ninkasi."
""
"Amazingly refreshing and complex for what it is supposed to be."
""
""
"The palate opens moderately bitter and surprisingly astringent. It drinks closer to an APA than a blonde ale, with the bitterness being fresh, pungent and with a blend of a German herbal/minty/spicy hop flavors and a secondary American citrus character. The malt character is less noticeable here, with a blend of biscuit and toast. Mildly sweet and moderately oily on the finish, this beer is medium-light in body and slightly over-carbonated. The finish has a lingering bitterness that's quite pleasing, with an herbal/minty character. Alcohol is well-hidden, but in all honesty, there's no reason this beer couldn't be brewed at 4.5% - just look at Victory's Summer Love, which combines German hops and a blonde ale remarkably well. Solid."
""
""
"O- A pretty dull beer with unpleasant bitter earthy notes."
""
""
"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a half finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of lightly toasted and biscuit malt, faint hops, reminiscent of a light pilsner. Flavor of mild bready and biscuit malt, sligthly nutty, finishing with dry bittering hops with light herabl notes. Medium bodied. Flavors are appropriate for a light Spring ale; but nothing really stands out and could use slightly more hop flavor to balance the bitterness in the finish. A nice dinner beer with pleasant maltiness."
""
"Overall, this is a perfect spring beer. I would definitely try this beer again. Such a great blend of bitter floral citric hops and sweet caramel malt notes. The only thing keeping it back are some astringent characters towards the aftertaste. I'm overlooking this since I'm really enjoying the beer."
""
""
""
"Overall - I don't know that this fits your classic description of an American Blonde; the flavor hits much closer to an American Pale to me. Regardless, it's another solid effort from Ninkasi, and a definite winner for a spring seasonal release."
"Poured from a 650ml bottle. Pours a deep yellow with orange highlights. Nose has lots of lemony hops.Very fresh and clean smelling. Taste is similar with lemon hop notes right up front. There’s good strong bitterness and generic malty sweetness as well. Tastes a bit like an ale version of a maibock."

"Overall/Comments: This was my first time having this and I came away thinking that this would be a very solid choice in late spring/early summer. Another solid beer from Ninkasi!! Classified as an American Blond Ale at 6% ABV. Spring Seasonal Release. Reviewed and Consumed 9/20/12."

"A bright, well-balanced ale; tasty and nicely hopped for a blonde. Probably best in spring, but also thoroughly enjoyable in the summer, when I had it."
""
"O- Weird and ultimately below average rendition of the style. I'd recommend only if you like Ninkasi or hoppy blonde ales."
""
""
"O-decent blonde ale with good flavor, would be a decent session beer"
"O - This one didn't have too much going on, but it was enjoyable as the temperature was getting warmer...simple, but it keeps you interested"

"The carbonation is just high enough to really make those citrus hop notes sing and be really refreshing."

"Overall, it is a little unbalanced and doesn't seem to match the style it claims, but I really like it nonetheless. Would love to try it again fresh."

"It is probably on the edge of its style but that only makes me like it a little more. A little confused with the abrupt changes from honey to hops and back again... but definitely worth a sixer."
"Deep golden color with a white head that dissipated slowly leaving lacing on the glass. Aroma of toasted and biscuit-like malts with some faint floral hops. Flavor very similar to aroma, but I didn't detect the hops at the beginning of the taste. It's light to medium bodied and has a a crisp effervescent mouth feel. It tastes and drinks like a pilsner lager. It finishes dry with an earthy hop bitterness. Overall, Spring Reign is more malty than hoppy."
"Cheers!"
"A balanced sessionable ale with just a touch of hop. Great summer beer."
"Purchased at Full Throttle Bottles in Georgetown (Seattle). 22 oz. pours a nice amber color and is fairly clear. Good frothy head out of the bomber with lacing. Malty finish with come caramel notes. Nice fresh, spicy finish and spring-like hence the name."
"The label claims this is drinkable a session beer, but given the ABV and IBUs, I can't agree."
"This was a little hoppier than other Blonde ales I've had. That wasn't really a bad thing though. I thought it was more of a pale ale than anything else, as I didn't detect much malts in the taste. It had a fruity/hoppy smell, with a little malt in the end. It's not a beer that explodes in my mouth, but it is nice for the hot summer days."
"Pours light and blonde and drinks like a forgettable ale. the hops show up but don't really make a statement and the beer seems over carbonated. I know this is a entry level type beer but I expected more from these guys especially for a seasonal in a bomber."
"All in all a very nice 21st take on an old school West Coast ale. Ninkasi should consider making it year round."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style and carbonation is moderate. Overall it was a pretty easy drinking and flavorful beer. It wasn't anything outstanding, but was pretty decent. The flavors were pretty well balanced in the taste as well. Decent beer overall."
"O: Mild, but flavorable. Nice balance."
"D - Drinks light, slight bitterness."
"D- I've been very impressed with most of Ninkasi's brews. I'd give this beer another shot and just hope I got a bad bottle."
"Not a bad brew, can see what they're doing and it's been done pretty successfully, if not outstandingly."
"A decent brew, clean, fresh, bright and drinkable without being all that exciting. But I'm very happy to have some unexcitingly quaffable beer on the roster, and Ninkasi again delivers on that."
"I'm not really sure what an American Blonde Ale is supposed to be, other than a marketing gimmick. I feel it's too hoppy for the style, and consequently would make a better pale ale. Not a bad beer at all."
"So this is a matter of taste, but it seems like sharp, highly hopped ales should be in the Pale Ale category."
"Really a nice beer for what it’s supposed to be. Seems to be a nice light session beer to help celebrate the warmer weather. Spot on boys!! Keep up the great work."
"Appearance is a light golden amber with a thin head that leaves a fair lace. Smell is light, but floral hops are there with malt in the back. Taste has a strong grapefruit bitter that seems out of balance with the roasted malts. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. They call this ""blonde"" a session ale on the bottle, but to me it's more towards an IPA."
"O: Solid spring ale from Ninkasi, no real complaints here. Good drinkability, really refreshing."
"Drinks pretty good for the style. Not a huge hit with me but an easy going summer-drinker."
"The overly toasted malt character detracts a bit from the overall package for me but it's a nice drinkable bland with a healthy grassy hop profile."
"O: At 6% abv this is not quite the session beer it claims to be, but it's very easy to drink and tastes pretty good. Wouldn't turn down a free pint, but it's not Ninkasi's best."
"One finger semi-broken creamy white head, medium-slow dissipation, good lacing, over clear straw yellow body surrounded by multiple streams of rising carbonation. Hops dominate the nose, pretty grassy with slight pineyness, dryish bready malts for balance. Taste mirrors nose, not much going on here, fairly light body and mouthfeel is a bit watery. Not very impressed, my least favorite of Ninkasi offerings to date."
"Drink- It's below average and I expected more. I had heard good things about Ninkasi but think I need to try their regular line up before I write them off."
"Drinkability - Easily quaffable, and that is exactly what I'm doing on such an annoyingly hot day (upper 80's right now, was 90's earlier). Thanks for the great extra!"
"D: Finally found a Ninkasi that I don't like...this was a drain pour."
"Loads of carbonation in this beer. It looks like a spring (blonde) ale should look like, light and crisp, the color is golden yellow, or blonde if you will. It is a little hazy, you can't see through it really at all, which is surprisingly nice. The head is a nice two fingers and it is sticking around for a while, it looks fluffy and pillowy, and completely white. The appearance on this is pretty impressive. The smell is nice, it smells like spring! It just smells super refreshing and nice and crisp. It has a nice light hop smell and a sweet malty finish on the smell as well. It also smells a little citrusy and it might have some floral notes as well. A little complex, but not too much on the smell, either way it smells nice! Not as much flavor as I would have liked on the taste. The hops and malts are really skimping out on this beer. I mean that is kinda to be expected because it is a blonde ale, but it's a little more than I would have liked. On the plus side it is very refreshing, and it has some nice citrus characteristics and some flowery taste to it. It tastes like spring to me, which is really nice, I just wish there was more of that flavor all around. Overall, tasty, but I wish they increased all the flavors one notch! Mouthfeel is pretty good, normal for a blonde ale, and the drinkability is very high, higher than I should give it credit for, the taste would indicate low drinkability, but since I want more of that flavor that I'm only getting a little bit of, and because it's very crisp and refreshing, it just makes me want more and more of it. Overall, a well done beer, not too impressive on the taste, but it is so crisp and refreshing that it makes me want to give it a good grade."
"This might be a spring seasonal, but man, this would be perfect for a warm summer day. Well done Ninkasi, I am fan."
"Good stuff, a real beer's beer as I like to say, not something that an old redneck would think was to froofy-froofy, but still tasty. I approve."
"D: An easy beer to drink a lot of. Its lager-like characteristic smoothness is made much more enjoyable (imo) by its strong hoppiness (for the style), making this an above average session beer."
"I remember this beer with more pale malt and not so much of that hang-around dry bitterness."
"rating drinkability purely on a typical blonde ale being fairly middle-of-the road, i'd go only a '3', but pretend it's an IPA and it's an easy '4' and still certainly sessionable!"
"3/6/2011 Sampling--Rocky lacy medium thick white head. Clear pretty bright gold color. Delicate floral hop front. Crisp refreshing mild sweet light textured tasty light malt smooth Golden Ale body. Mild hop clean refreshing citrus hint crisp end. Subtly hopped. Easy to drink."
"Taste, great honey and floral hop complexity to a very light feeling beer in a good way. The slightest feel of apples and maybe even cinammon (its not just for winter beers). A great hot weather, working outdoors, swimming, shooting beer. And for $3.50, you can't go wrong. Check it out."
"D - Pretty good and decently balanced, but you have to think of this as either an amber or pale ale then you get it."
"I rate this one a solid ""GOOD"" and would recommend it to anyone curious about trying a slightly bitter, hoppy beer."
"Drinkability - I liked the sharp personality of the flavors but it just didn't go down well for a beer trying to fill the sessionable bill."
"Drinkable, and a little unusual for the style. More body and bitterness than expected. I would have this again in season."
"I just don't understand what Ninkasi was trying to do with this one. The beer is at best unoffensive, but there's no complexity, poor balance, and well, it just doesn't taste that great."
"An OK beer but nothing special, tastes like a watered down Stone Arrogant Bastard."
"Coarse and grainy in flavor with a return of lemon/orange citrus that lingers through the finish and accompanies some lightly toasted grain. Offers a moderate body for the style given its texture, with a good balance of background citric sweetness, though not bitter by any means. Rather heavy in character for a Blonde Ale, adding some depth to the style. Nice drinkability overall and rather dry on the finish, yet a firm carbonation holds up to give the beer a creamy feel. Tastes like there's a fair amount of wheat in the mix."
"D: I can easily put down a 22oz and would enjoy a 2nd during a long afternoon or bbq."
"Not a fan."
"D: Solid stuff. One of the cheapest new bombers I've seen in a while, a nice brew for spring."
"D- Pretty good, although a blonde it is not- a pale more like it."
"Overall - This is a nice ""spring ale"" as they call it, that will probably appeal to fans of pale ale, and mellower IPA's. It may be raining here in WA, but this brew already has me in the spring mood, lol."
"This beer is a clear copper-amber color with a centimeter of resilient, sticky foam. The aroma combines caramel malt and flowery hops. The body is medium in body as sweet and grainy malt spill into a moist center. The mixture of hops is pleasant with both pine and citrus notes. This is a nice drinkable beer. I am not sure about the American Blonde Ale category, though. This beer reminds me more of an American Pale Ale."
"The body was typical for the style, as was drinkability. Overall, a decent beer, worth a shot if you see it."
"Next review!"
"D: Pretty drinkable, the dry finish keeps you coming back for more and the flavors are nice, just needs to be balanced."
"Spring Reign Ale is at least as good as Radiant Summer Ale. Why stop there Ninkasi? Give us something for the autumn and winter seasons that is just as hoppy and just as good. More hoppy and better would work too."
"This beer reminds me quite a lot of Bridgeport IPA, actually."
"Had this in a bottle and also at the KLCC Brewfest in February around it's debut time. It pours out a light, not quite opaque yellow-brown color with a white head. Looks like it'll be refreshing, though there's not much of a smell to it. The taste is dominated by the malt which tastes a bit like straw and a bit like bread. Not a hop taste to be found, though, no taste of alcohol either. It's ok when it's very cold, but as it warms up it becomes even stranger tasting. Not the best of Ninkasi's spectacular line of beers."
"The aroma was biscuity with a hint of noble. The taste was sharp and it finished creamy. Definitely got the idea that this was mostly malt dominated brew. Out of the few that I have tried of this style it is tops. On the end of the drink you get a nice bitterness that is light on the palate. Overall this seasonal is well worth trying out."
"Pours a hazy orangish-gold color with a frothy white head that turns to a light ring around the glass. Aroma is of caramel, slight citrus and a touch of butter/diacetyl but it isn't that vibrant. Flavor mirrors the aroma except for more citrus hops with some toasty malts. Its a light bodied beer that is slick because of the present diacetyl. Its a decent beer out of the bottle but the tap version was seemed much fresher and more flavorful."
"Aroma is a bit woody, some straw, and a bit of metallic hop spice. Some diacetyl/buttery flavors in here, bleh. Some DMS cooked veggies too. Some grapenut graininess. It aint bad, but its nothing outstanding. I'm glad to see Ninkasi has fixed their spoiled bottle issues and such though. This js just a standard blonde/golden/pa, nothing really off or really exceptional."
"Overall impression: Nice sessionable beer. A lot more interesting than I expected from a blonde ale. Recommended."
"D: Very drinkable brew, will be enjoying more of this for sure!"
"Drinkability is okay for what it is, a strong pale ale. But not what I was hoping for or expecting after reading the label. Decent price at least."
"4/4/4/4/4.5"
"taste is semi-thick, pine, dandelion, grass, some nuts, hops, and a few malts, ends on the dry side and bitter, becomes more bitter as you drink."
"Recommend a try at least.. but not a top pick.. especially from this brewer.. and I am shooting myself for missing an Oaked Cask of Tricerahops last night..."
"22 oz bomber. Bright amber/orange in colour, good sized off white head. Lots of citic hoppiness in the aroma ,backed by a good malt. Flavour is very lemony /orange hoppiness, bright and breezy, though you can tell the malt backing underneath is strong and consistent. Nice mouthfeel..great hoppy after taste. Very nice, excellent strong pale."
"Light bodied with with good carbonation and a dry mouthfeel. I couldn't finish this. The metallic and medicinal hop finish was too much."
"D- Very easy to drink, great solid brew."
"One of the more flavorful blondes out there, would make a nice session beer, nice seasonal with a nice Northwest hop presence, wish this stuff was available in my neck of the woods, recommended"
"Poured from a 22oz bottle, this is the first beer I have had from Ninkasi, and if the label hadn't been so bright and appealing on a crappy Seattle day I might not have picked it. Right now I am glad to have bought it. A slightly vigorous pour gives it a light amber orange color with a 2 finger head, and a slight head retention and good lacing. Smell is mostly fresh hops with a little bit of light malt in the background. Taste is orange zest and floral hops, with a bit of roasted malt. Hop bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. This is a very drinkable beer, and makes me think of how some of the better pale ales out there would be if they were fresh."
"From a 22 ounce bottle. Slightly hazed amber with one finger of off white head. (gentle pour) Good amount of lacings. Aroma is floral hops. Taste is citrus grapefruit orange hops and strong support from the sweet malts. Tasted like a nice West Coast Pale Ale to my palate. Easy drinker, very smooth. Medium dry finish. Very fine spring beer. I believe this beer was quite fresh and it is the first time I have seen it on the shelves in the Portland area."
"D: the bottle says ""a session beer that everyone can enjoy"" I would agree. Another great and tasty Ninkasi!"
