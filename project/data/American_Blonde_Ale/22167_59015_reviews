"My standby lighter craft brew"
""
"With light session beers, I like to get a real sense of the ingredients that went into the beer. This seems to have a very neutral yeast, malt, and hop character. Nothing really shines. Not a poorly brewed beer, no off-flavors. I just have had much more interesting blondes where you really get a sense of a nice base malt with complimentary hops."
""
"Overall a good summer beer that has more favor then most."
""
"On tap at Matt's Bar in south Minneapolis; and it's well-matched to heavy fare: crisp, lightly malty, thin and very consumable, if not necessarily inspired."

"Overall:  I've had this on tap several times but picked up an on-sale sixer for a review.  This is a good starter beer for your BMC drinkers or for a change-up from your big flavored beers.  Worth a try."
"Overall: A good example of the blonde ale style. The flavor is pleasant and interesting, but stays out of the way and doesn't try to make a bold statement. I would have preferred the malts to be a little more toasty or maybe biscuity rather than grainy, but I could be misperceiving that. A solid member of the Fulton lineup, that should not be overlooked just because it doesn't have an overpowering amount of hops or malt."

"Mouth was ok. Very mild even for a crossover beer."
""
"Final Thoughts: I went into this review having never tried Fulton Lonely Blonde before and with low expectations for a style I consider boring. While it is nothing complex or mind-blowing, Lonely Blonde doesn't need to be, it simply impresses with its good flavor and drinkability at a sessionable ABV. Nice one, especially recommend for any craft beer newbies. Would I drink it again? Yes."

"O=I am not a huge fan of American Blonde Ales and still have not found one that tastes better than a good amber lager. This beer doesn't offer anything unique--I would not purchase again and would think twice of choosing it on tap at a bar."

"However, once again, there ain't nothing wrong with it, and it is just as good as a blonde ale should be. In fact, it's nearly perfect for a blonde ale. But, again, I'm not going to grab at one anytime soon."

"Not a fan of this one. Why pay premium price for what could be replaced by a PBR or High Life?"
"My first sample of Lonely Blonde was at Autumn Brew Review in 2010, and my impression was far less favorable. My guess is that tough festival conditions and a small sample of a more delicate beer impaired a fair tasting. Fresh and from the brewery, it's a solid beer that's refreshing with a complex taste that explains why a large number of folks are drinking with a Lonely Blonde at the tap room today."

"I'd get this again. Nice summer beer or with lighter foods."

"O-For the price there are better options in my opinion but this is a decent brew. Reminds me a bit of spotted cow but a little heavy on adjunct flavor."
""
""
"Golden blonde, clear, with a white foam head that dissipates quickl leaving a skein. Spotty lace here and there. Smells of flaky buttery crackers, bread dough, cereal. Taste is cereal grain, crackers reminescent of Triscuits, very lightly sweet. Hop bitterness arrives and cleanses the palate. Nicely balances and a clean finish. Body is medium to light, a little slick, holds together well, decent carbonation. Overall- light but decently balanced favors make for easy drinking."
""
"Toast and butter, light bitterness in the aftertaste. Simple taste, slightly grainy, papery, and a tad swilly. Light bodied with light carbonation. Overall drinkable and refreshing enough on a hot day, though i'd prefer my local version, Half Acre Gossamer to this."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a beer for the masses to enjoy. Hot day, hell yes I'd put this back. Nothing special but it's solid per style."
""
"I wasn't going to drink the blonde last night, but after the awful sweet child o vine during the Marquette/Providence game, I was like trying to reset the palate with a clean beer, so I popped this Blonde Ale open. It just didn't get the job done, it was gritty at times, the alcohol seemed bigger than it should have, it just didn't leave me in a position to recommend Fulton at this point."
"Was this beer built to compete with adjunct lagers? It certainly seems so to me. It's light, clean, and crisp, without a ton of flavor. Not bad, but there are better beers like it around that are more worth drinking."
"Y'know, certainly not a bad beer, but kinda boring.The same is true for SCoV Squarely a B- beer for me, as was Sweet I am pro-Fulton but more often than not I will find something more interesting to drink. I think Fulton needs to elevate its game and get more daring."
"O - This was an okay blonde ale. I'd like to try some more beers from Fulton."

"Overall: A pretty solid take on a Blonde ale. Tasty and very easy to drink."
""
"Overall - This is an example on how to do a Blonde Ale correctly and it's perfect for any occasion. It's not complex in flavor, but it doesn't need to be. It gets the job done as being a beer that doesn't sacrifice it's flavor for simplicity!"
""
""
"This one really does nothing for me. I hope Fulton does well and I enjoyed the Sweet Child, but I have no need to ever try this one again."
"Overall: I like Fulton's ""Sweet Child of Vine"" that I've had on tap on a few occasions, and will try that one from the bottle next. I was hoping for more from this beer based on the recent hype over the brewery opening in town and bottles being available. This isn't a very good interpretation of the Blonde style and just doesn't do much for me. I won't seek it out again...but I'm hoping they try some more adventurous beers in the future. I might suggest this beer for friends or family who usually drink ""Light"" beer...but not for my other craft beer aficionado friends. Half a point bonus for the nice labeling on the bottle."

"Decent beer, but isn't much better than a BMC beer. Easy drinking, but lacking depth, and flavor."
"Serving type: Bottle"
"O- A simple beer and one that is easy drinking. I'd bring this one to a tailgate."
"This beer pours a clear pale gold color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes within seconds into almost no lacing. The aroma is of light bready malt with a hint of honey. It is nice, but it is all very faint even for the style. The taste is similar to the aroma. I like what I am tasting, but it is just to light even for a blonde ale. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with a thin texture, and moderately high carbonation. Overall, this is an average blonde ale that I will probably pass of next time."
"O- a good summer beer with a low abv,,easy to drink but flat on the taste..still an allright brew to try"
"Drinkability: Comes across as a creamier, fuller bodied, hoppier lager, and that is a-ok with me."
"On-tap at Acadia Cafe. I'd enjoyed Fulton's Child of Vine and hoped this would prove tasty as well. But frankly I was let down with Lonely Blonde. It's just another clean, grainy blonde ale. I already know what 2-row barley tastes like and there's nothing new here. Plenty of other breweries have made this same beer for years, there isn't much reason to single this one out."
"I will try again to reaffirm my impressions, I know that the first time I had Sweet Child of Vine, I did not care for it, but have had it since and enjoyed it."
"D- Very nice summer blond, refreshing, flavorful enough to keep me interested, balanced, clean. Very nice beer from the new kids on the Mpls craft beer block..."
