Once the head dissipates we have a hazy golden color with still lots of fluffy white head on top. Aroma of very light pale malts, some floral hops, dry, with little sweetness in the nose. Flavor is hay, a hint of floral hop, nearly no malt backbone, and a slightly dirty finish. Light bodied as would be expected from a session beer with lower carbonation than I expected. Overall a mediocre brew but inoffensive and seems like something that a larger group would enjoy at a cookout.","BMMillsy","Jan 27, 2014"

Mouthfeel falls just short of medium for the style but makes up for it by being perfectly carbonated and mildly creamy. It reminds me a bit of Southern Star's bombshell with less sweetness and body. Both have nice grains and a subtle hop. I think this is pretty good. I have already bought two sixers on my various forays to the metroplex, and as it gets hotter, this beer will only become more appealing. This is a perfect choice to grab a sixer of before heading to a Rangers game in mid-June.","twiggamortis420","Mar 20, 2013"

I also get a bit of orange citrus, but it is subtle. The flavor is a bit different. The toffee and biscuit malt notes add some nice sweet character, which is complimented by the orange and grass notes from the hops. There is also an earthy character in the flavor which is quite nice. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Nice beer.","Mora2000","Aug 04, 2012"
