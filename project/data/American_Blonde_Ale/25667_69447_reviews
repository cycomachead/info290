"Rated this as a Blonde Ale, not an Extra Pale Ale as ABW classifies it as. Not bad, pretty average."

"Simultaneously sweet and grainy, the beer shares the qualities of a failed experiment and a cheap macro-lager. I like ABW a lot, and that's why this one's a head-scratcher. Its direct competition in town in the easy-drinking ale category, Hops and Grain's The One They Call Zoe, blows it out of the water. Can't all be gems, I guess."

"Pretty disappointed in this beer, it seems that they are trying to make a mass market lager with a craft beer price tag."
"This is my 1st beer from Austin Beerworks after hearing good things about the brewery. It taste like a subpar lager, such as Lone Star or PBR. After drinking a few dogfish 60 minute IPAs, I grabbed a 6 pack of this stuff (for $10) and couldn't even taste it. I hope the brewerie's other beers have better character than this one, otherwise I won't be revisiting. No characteristics to point out- just terrible..."

"O- This was a decent pale ale that was nice to drink. There wasn't anything that really stood out in it, but it was overall enjoyable. I'm glad I got to try it, thanks again Sam for sending it!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""

"O: This beer is pretty average. The flavors are ok, the mouthfeel is ok, it's just ok. I didn't hate it, and I didn't love it. This would be a great alternative to BMC if you wanted a substitute."

"I could see finishing quite a few of these in the summertime. Which should be starting in about three days..."
""
"Drink- I wanted this one for the style tick. I wouldnt have searched it out in the meantime. I can say that on a sweltering hot Texas or CA summer day this would work wonders."
"Austin Beerworks needs to reconfigure this ale or just get rid of it all together."
"D ~ Overall underwhelming. Good? yes I finished it but not great or worth revisiting. This is what would be an ""Extra Pale Ale"" in terms of being Extra Pale, rather than Extraordinary."
"O: This beer is OK. That is about all I've got. For once, I would not buy it under any circumstance... unless there was just a bunch of crappy major brands, and this brew."
""
""
"One last thing: the name. Peacemaker? Given the history of the Texas Rangers and whatnot I imagine that this is a reference to the guns they used in as “pacifiers”? While this may be clever and in line with the brewery’s theme, speaking for myself it brings up uncomfortable connotations that really shouldn’t affect my experience drinking. But they do, and it does."
""
"Not bad, nothing spectacular though."
""
""
"Overall this is an ok beer. Nothing stands out but it's not bad either. I had it as a beer to end the night with and it might be best served in that role."

"A pretty basic take on the style, nothing spectacular but perfectly drinkable."
"Creamy body with grainy nuts on the flavor, packs a nice amount of flavor in here with a nice kiss of grassy and floral hops on the finish. Kind of like a cream ale with a bit more malt flavor and maybe more yeast character. I like this one, the earthiness from the malt and understated hop presence give this one a British feel to it. I still like the Pearl Snap Pils a little better than this as far as ABW offerings are concerned, but the Peacemaker ranks above the IPA for me. Tasty brew, I'll buy another sixer of this one, no doubt."
"This drinks like a refreshing, blonde, almost Kolsch-like. Easy going with only a modest bitterness and a pleasant cracker/bread malt profile. Would enjoy another."
"O - Light and very mild. Ok"
"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is full of grass and orange citrus hops with a little bit of bread and biscuit malt. The flavor is more of the same, with some juicy orange citrus notes coming from the hops. The bitterness is fairly low and the beer is well balanced. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice beer overall."
"Simple and enjoyable. I like it. Not the big hits like Fire Eagle or Pearl Snap are, but still a well made mild pale ale. Excellent for the summer or just everyday drinking."
"Either I just pick up XPAs that are past their prime, or this one is just somewhat exceptional."
"Mouthfeel - Crisp and snappy."
"O: Not bad, but not quite as nice as the pils or the IPA."
"The mouthfeel's just right, and I'd drink this again. I would definitely take this beer with me to tubing trips! It's such an easygoing beer. However, out of three beers I have tried from Austin Beerworks, I think I enjoyed Pearl Snap the most."
"12 oz can poured into Sam Adams glass. Pale amber color with pretty much no head or lacing - looks a lot like apple cider. Not a flavorful aroma, kind of a sour papery malt smell. Weak hop flavors for a pale ale - seems like more of a blonde ale. Pretty bland overall. Finishes okay, good carbonation and bitter bite. Overall it's a step above domestic lagers, but needs some work."
"O: Prefer their IPA, but I could see myself drinking a lot of this over the summer."
"Clear yellow, no head or lace. Head could not be created on swirling. Malty aroma. Taste is predominantly malt, but very clean. The look and mouthfeel are similar to an adjunct lager, but the taste is much cleaner in that it is devoid of the earthy, corn flavors in the finish. High carbonation and medium-light body. A good summer time beer."
"Overall: Very easy to drink, took my time with the first can, but the second one i took down in about 5 gulps. Great to see new offering in Texas, and great to see more offerings out of the can. I will have to give their other varieties a try."
"i hate for this beer to have a negative first review, but i am being honest. hopefully someone out there really enjoys this brew and will review it."
