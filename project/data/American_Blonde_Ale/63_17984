I guess I was expecting an ale with fruit, or maybe something shandy-like. For that reason I am somewhat let down. I have to get past that, however and rate it as a pale ale. In that regard it is pretty good. Not quite as good as Mirror Pond, but a fair shake is owed to Twilight Summer Ale.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Oct 29, 2014"

There's a hint of bready malt. Flavor is slightly fruity, likely attributable to specialty malt, with floral, perfumey notes, a touch of citrus, and a grassy, almost piney, earthy, crisp finish.

The smell was mild, which I was expecting with it geared towards a summer session beer. The taste was pleasantly mild, following the smell. I could taste slight hints of citrus, but again it was quite mild. I thought it would be a good introduction beer for newbies, but my friend was not too fond of it. Overall it's a good beer for summer barbecue sessions","nreed","Jul 07, 2014"

Aromatics biscuit malts, bready character all day hints of floral/citric hop notes nice Summer Ale character extremely easy to drink. No catpiss or crushed aspirin from the reserved Amarillo additions but there's floral citric notes in the flavor that work with the light bready character get drinking while it's available. I drank Red Chair out of style, I'm about to do the same with this one...glad to see Deschutes in the Burgh it took a long time to get it in Western PA well worth the wait. Mouthfeel textured with moderate carbonation lighter bodied easy drinking lovely experience.

Although the aroma was understated, the taste most certainly was not. A very hoppy blonde, with strong grapefruit and pine/spruce aromatics accompanied by woody and earthy flavors that became more prominent as I made my way through the pint. Wow. A very nice Pilsener and rock candy sweet malt backbone provides a counterpoint but still a hops forward summer beer. All in all a great beer but hops approach American pale ale in magnitude.

The taste was much different than the smell and is very 'hoppy' with a bit of a harsh aftertaste for my likes.","BeerWithMike","Sep 14, 2013"

4.44,21,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This pours a golden toasted straw color with nice foaming. The foam dies down leaving some cotton in the glass. The aroma has a subdued straw-pine hop characteristic, with just the slightest whisper of a biscuity malt. A bitterness upfront has a pleasing straw note which tapers into a slightly piney finish. There’s a dry and lingering finish with the slightest hint of caramel sweetness. To be honest it’s a confusing mix of contrasting flavors with the hops and a touch of malt contrasting rather than complementing but I definitely enjoyed spending time with it.","elNopalero","Jul 22, 2013"

The combination of Amarillo hops and the typical estery English yeast strain they probably used results in a beer that smells and tastes a little like candy.

Significant bready notes in the nose some grassy and light resiny hops. Taste mirrors nose, quite bready ala English Pale Ale, slight bit of resin, floral notes, decent bitterness on back end.

3.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Flavor is hops-forward with a slight biscuity kind of undertone. Mild flavors lead by a very reasonable hop bitterness credited to Amarillo. Combine that with light carbonation and this is a supremely drinkable brew.","hreb","Jun 24, 2012"

4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"O: A great summer beer, enough depth and character to be really enjoyable, but not so much so that a person wouldn't want to drink more. I can see this being a definite gateway beer for non-craft drinkers. Great stuff, wouldn't expect anything less from Deschutes.","pokesbeerdude","Jun 17, 2012"
3.26,-11.2,3.5,3.75,3,3.5,3,"Pours a hazy light orangey-yellow with a half thumbs width white head. A nice bright, sweet fruity aroma alongside a hit of malt. Flavor starts off with a hit of sweet fruit, countered by some of grassy hops that seem to accentuate the sweet fruitiness, and closes out with some rice cake. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, a decent summer brew. Very sessionable and low key, certainly not the most exciting brew out there though that's not what its trying to be.","denver10","Jun 16, 2012"
3.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Overall nice, nothing special but then again you usually don't want summer beers to be too strong in any direction. This had some nice light malts and gave it a nice kick with the resinous hops, and nice hop flavors, but still quite drinkable.","jlindros","Jun 15, 2012"

3.97,8.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"an outstanding summer beer, infinitely sessionable and plenty interesting. smells like fresh hops but not in an overpowering way. it smells balanced by some fruit, maybe clementines or something not quite tart and not quite sweet. flavor is very fruity, but not in a fruit added way, i think its just the character of the hops used, which leaves an excellently crisp finish. very different flavor profile for a summer beer. i could easily do a 6pack of these in an afternoon. delicious when ice cold. feel is good, light and drinkable without being watery. less than medium body, exciting on the tongue, and clean finishing. no complaints with this one, great summer brew.","StonedTrippin","Jun 14, 2012"

Nothing too much going on here, just a refreshing easy-drinkin beer. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a good session beer.

3.78,3,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a one and a half finger head that fills up the glass perfectly. The head is about half big bubbles and half small bubbles, but it looks very creamy. It's leaving excellent lacing, that is clear. The head is actually hanging around for a decent amount of time, not going away completely at all. Pretty impressive there. The body is a gorgeous golden color, very bright, very nice looking. Carbonation looks like it's a little on the high side, but not by too much, it looks like it'll be nice even if it is a little much. Visibility is ok, can't see much through this beer, but it's by no means ""cloudy", I can see some things. Overall the appearance is very nice, the lacing is very impressive and so is the head. Very nice smell to this beer, very refreshing smelling and clean. It has a small hop note up front and then some evident fruit in here as well. Light fruit, maybe lemons or something like that, very small, but it adds a very nice smell to the beer. Nice malt smell to this as well, light, maybe caramel malts. Overall the smell isn't to crazy or out there, but it's really nice, very summer like and refreshing to the nose. Taste is a little disappointing, for sure not as rich of a flavor as I was expecting, but still way better than there cascade ale, which is also a blonde ale. The hops and fruit are a lot more present in this beer than in the cascade ale, other than that they are very similar. Overall the flavor is just much bigger in this beer than in the cascade ale, still not as big as I would like, but good none the less. To describe this beer from from to end, I get the hops first, then some nice malt, mixed in with clean crisp water, then comes some orange and then a hop bite to finish it off again. This beer has a lot of the flavors enter and then come back later in the palate, it's very nice. I don't know if I just don't pay attention to this fact in most beers I review, or if it's just especially well done in this beer, but I am noticing it a lot now. It's not a chaotic palate, it's not all over the place, it just has nice flavors coming and going and then coming again. The flavor still isn't as much as I want, but overall it's a really well done beer and it's got really nice flavors and mixes them up well, even if it't not as flavorful as I would like. The mouthfeel is decent, not as much carbonation as I would like, but still for sure more than the cascade ale had. The body is big enough to fit the style, which isn't hard because it's a blonde ale, but still, it's not water. The carbonation is my only complaint, but it's still not bad at all. Drinkability is very good on this beer, it's tasty, crisp, refreshing, not a problem to drink at all! Overall this is a really good summer beer, slightly fruity, slightly hoppy, the best of both worlds. Not as much flavor as I would like, but that's not the end of the world in this case.","MaltsOfGlory","May 28, 2011"

If you live in a warm climate like I do, this could easily be a great year-round drinker, as there isn't one bit of that seasonal type of novelty feel to this beer that tends to pertain to a lot of the more fruity wheat beers a lot of craft brewers tend to release. Best of all, Deschutes is one of the only craft brewers I'm aware of that DOES NOT follow the norm of releasing their seasonal brews two months before the actual season.

The hops really seem harsh and not just bitter. Leaves a lingering bitterness long after a drink. Again there is not much from the malt.

Delicious and well-balanced as I've come to expect from this brewery -- an interesting blend of malts and hops, though I'd be hard-pressed to pick out what's what -- some toasty caramel, nectarine. Interesting mouthfeel -- it doesn't seem very carbonated, but it gets a good tingle on the tongue, and then it dries up nicely. A pretty complex beer that's drinkable enough for a warm day, though I definitely agree with the reviewer that wrote that this would be equally welcome on a cold night.

That is to say, I enjoy it quite so, as a lively summer kick. Standing golden in its glass as afternoon sunshine, with a bright white head reducing to a thin light lace, fresh and fruity fragrances touch the nose. The hops, they won't kick you in the face, but you'll definitely know they're there. Moderately carbonated with a crisp volley and a slightly bitter finish...

4.05,10.4,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head along with floaties. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful malt complexity that balances well with the floral hop aroma. The taste is good. It has a very smooth malt palate that is slightly sweet and boasts of pale, carapils, and light crystal malts. The hop bitterness is mild. It balances near perfect. It goes down easy and finishes a bit fruity in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is outstanding. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good American pale ale. It has excellent flavor and aroma; a good drinker.","WesWes","Oct 03, 2004"

Hopilicious and supremely quaffable, this is a beer to seek out and consume in quantity. Easily my new favorite beer from a quality Oregon brewery.","BuckeyeNation","Aug 19, 2004"

4.4,19.9,4,4,4.5,4,5,"A nice break from your normal PacNW pale ale this was. Not everyday malt takes center stage in on of these beers. Hops do their thing as far as taste goes, but bitterness is relaxed. Crisp and clean. I'll be picking this on up again for sure!","MrNuggets","Aug 09, 2004"
3.92,6.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer burst forth from the 12-ounce brown bottle a cloudless golden color with a semi-creamy white head that is modest in size and as it dissolves, the lace forms a thick and clinging sheet upon the glass. Nose is malt dominated with a slight hint of hops, lime like in its crispness, fresh and pleasing to the nose and the eyes, start is delightfully malted and slightly sweet with the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is moderate in its acidity, the hops delectable in their spicy presence, very dry and lingering aftertaste, and a nice beer and really hits the spot.","Gusler","Jul 30, 2004"

2.6,-29.2,3,3,2,3,3,"This is easily Deschutes' worst beer. They already make 3 pale ale type beers (Mirror Pond, Bachelor, and Cascade which is a much better light summer thirst quencher than Twilight anyday), so there is absolutely no need for this beer. The real tragedy is that Twilight bumps Pine Mountain Pils out of the line-up, a very well-liked beer and one of a disgracefully small number of American micro pilsners. Bad move Deschutes. Bring back the Pils -- seriously. Actually I'm guessing most casual beer drinkers will not find anything too objectionable about this beer, and it seems to be an immediate hit, but its shortcomings are noticeable to those who are paying attention. I will not buy this beer again, although I guess if I see it on tap I'll give it a whirl. A disappointment, and a real bummer; dare I say, a disgrace.","Thrasher","Jul 02, 2004"
3.08,-16.1,3,2.5,3,3,4,"Must say this is an OK beer but its bad in comparison to one of the few good pilsners ever to come out of Oregon..bring back the Pine Mountain Pils next year ..PLEASE","Reidrover","Jul 01, 2004"
4.1,11.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Deschutes Twilight Ale, summer 2004, had a transluscent light straw color capped by short-lived quarter inch white head. There was some streaky lace.The pleasant citrusy aroma was predominently grapefruity. The taste was sharp and grapefruity with a good hop bite tempered by some malt sweetness. The finish was slightly dry and citrusy. Overall it was flavorful, but not overpowering, and definately thirst quenching. Just what a summer beer should be.","genaro","Jun 29, 2004"
4.1,11.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Twilight Ale was served from the tap in an imperial pint glass at the Deschutes Public House in Bend. The beer was a slightly hazy rich orange-golden straw color, and was topped by a sticky white head that left thin sticky sheets of lacing. The nose presented a bright and citric-resiny hop bouquet and a complementary light crisp maltiness. On the palate, a crisp, clean, and subtlly complex malt profile with some crackery pilsner qualities opened and was followed by a citric-zest transition to a crisp and clean, moderately bittered, bisquity finish. The medium-light body worked very well with the flavors and summer character of this crafty and original brew. Twilight ale drinks very well, and is crisp and refreshing, yet is solid, balanced, full flavored, and satisfying...making it the summer seasonal of choice for me.","HiroProtagonist","Jun 22, 2004"

3.58,-2.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Good solid summer brew from deschutes. Pours a light orange/amber with a decent ivory white head that stays in size throughout. Lacing is minimal as you drink. The smell is of a summer garden, mint and berries tingle the nose. A slight hint of caramel malts, very clean to the nose. The taste is of sweet malt with a wet buttery puck to the tongue. Hop presence is light but there, a nice crisp medium bodied summer ale. Like the bottle says these are perfect for sitting on the porch after that hot summer day.","beertaster13","Jun 22, 2004"
