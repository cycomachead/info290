"Easy to drink I guess. I just don't want to go back and drink it again, but its their entry beer.  Gateway I guess."

"Blonde colored beer, smell is sweet, cereal notes. Taste is a sweet beer, fat, with a yeasty start and a Corn Pops finish. Mouthfeel is really slick and buttery the really makes it drinkable. Hop presences is a non-factor think they were going for an easy drinking crowd pleasure and even though I might reach for a Bombshell Blonde first Dallas Blonde remains a solid Texas blonde option."

"Overall- I like this alot and if I had more access to it I would put this in the rotation for summer and probably all year. Plenty of flavor and extremely drinkable, I would definitely recommend this one. (86/100)"

"Drinkable enough beer, but not one of Deep Ellum's frontliners."

"The can is correct; this goes down easy. While it's difficult to drink while laughing at the overwrought hand wringing over the slogan without shooting beer out your nose, it can be done. And this is worth chasing down. It's nothing amazing, and won't change your life in any meaningful way, but it is a solid blonde ale, perfect for nights on the deck of afternoons by the grill, when you just want a beer without having to think hard about it."

"D/O- Rated to style. Nothing off-putting about this beer but nothing that stands out either. A fine alternative to mainsteam lagers. Thanks for this one kojevergas!"

"Again, the brew is super cloudy with debris, which makes me think the six-pack I picked up is old (the 2/12/14 printed on it might be a best-by date) ... BUT it's still really good. If it were closer to 4% ABV, I'd consider it a perfect session beer. At 5.2%, it's still a a good one and a beer I'll definitely be picking up again."
"Low C+"
"O - The look and smell had me optimistic, but the taste and mouthfeel didn't back them up. It's certainly not the worst beer I've ever poured out of a can, but it's also definitely not the best."

"Passing over some old hand written reviews. I remember liking this one a little bit more than what the rating says. Guess i'm gonna have to drink it again! On to the notes: Orange body, hoppy aroma but not too overwhelming. Light body with a hoppy resinous presence, crisp and dry to the palate. In the end, easy comes easy goes!"

"Can given to me from a friend. Pours into my tulip glass all head and then some. Taking a while to get this into liquid form jeez. Once the head dissipates we have a hazy golden color with still lots of fluffy white head on top. Aroma of very light pale malts, some floral hops, dry, with little sweetness in the nose. Flavor is hay, a hint of floral hop, nearly no malt backbone, and a slightly dirty finish. Light bodied as would be expected from a session beer with lower carbonation than I expected. Overall a mediocre brew but inoffensive and seems like something that a larger group would enjoy at a cookout."

"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Golden hue, bubbly head, and some persistent lacing. Bread accentuated with honey and lemon. Pungent bread, with a crisp hop, and harsh lemon. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."

"Pours out to a nice frothy white head and dies down to a permanent thin layer of foam. Lacing is minimal but it tries. Color is a hazy yellow and tons of bubbles rising. Aroma is grainy, malty, crackery and a hint of hops. Flavor is a balance of malt sweetness and mild hop bitterness. Finishes crisp. Mouthfeel is big for the style. Overall, a good alternative to adjunct lagers."

"Overall, great beer out of a can! Easy to drink. I'd pick this up over any mainstream domestic to stand out a little with friends who can't get away from the norm, and it won't overpower them."

"A furious of bubbles results in a loosely packed but tall and fluffy white head that settles when she gets good and ready. Color is pale yellow with a ""winking"" clarity. Light fruits (pear, grapes, lemon), malt and even some pepper to the nose. This broad smells good. Light and fruity as expected on the tongue and ""goes down easy"" with that simplicity reserved for nights like this when it all just comes together."

"Overall: Fantastic blonde very friendly and drinkable but still has flavorful elements that make it interesting."
"Light, grainy malt with a modest fruit and hop combo that keeps it from being too boring. Mouthfeel falls just short of medium for the style but makes up for it by being perfectly carbonated and mildly creamy. It reminds me a bit of Southern Star's bombshell with less sweetness and body. Both have nice grains and a subtle hop. I think this is pretty good. I have already bought two sixers on my various forays to the metroplex, and as it gets hotter, this beer will only become more appealing. This is a perfect choice to grab a sixer of before heading to a Rangers game in mid-June."

"On tap at the brewery. The beer pours an orange color with a white head. The first things to come through in the aroma are biscuit malt and a hint of grass. I also get a bit of orange citrus, but it is subtle. The flavor is a bit different. The toffee and biscuit malt notes add some nice sweet character, which is complimented by the orange and grass notes from the hops. There is also an earthy character in the flavor which is quite nice. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Nice beer."
