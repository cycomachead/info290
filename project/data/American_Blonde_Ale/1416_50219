Color was a hazy lemon-yellow (SRM = 4). Nose had a lemony, grassy scent and lemongrass was certainly a possibility. Frankly, it reminded me more of a Pilsner than a Blonde. Mouthfeel was very soft, caressing my poor, bruised tongue and washing it with a lemony, biscuity flavor. I stand behind thinking of it as a German Pilsner. Finish was semi-dry, refreshing and a definite possibility for inclusion in the cooler in the Sum'r, I mean, Summer.","woodychandler","Dec 15, 2013"

3.68,6.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 6/14/2013. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy golden straw color with a 2 finger dense bright white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, apple, cracker, bready grain, floral, grass, light honey, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt and hop notes; with decent strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, apple, cracker, bready grain, light honey, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, cracker, bready grain, light honey, floral, grass, herbal, and earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and moderate robustness of hop, malt, and fruity ester flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately dry mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4%. Overall this is a nice blonde ale style. Good balance of hop and malt flavors with moderate robustness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 25, 2013"

Aromas of toasted grain, tangy sweetness with hints of berries, and floral highlights. Flavors are roasty and toasty forward, with a subtle buttery and toffee backbone, and some floral hops highlights providing a hint of bitterness and pepper spice at the end of the palate.

The nose comprises sweet lemon peel, very light biscuit, and a hint of mint. The taste holds notes of thoroughly funky lemon peel, light wheat, a pinch of coriander, and a single miniature crystal of Belgian candi sugar. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, this beer just didn't quite do it for me. I get that it's meant to be light and "refreshing" for the warmer months and whatnot, but it's just too thin, too light, too insubstantial to really work, and the Sorachi hops, which actually can work at times, don't express themselves well enough, due mostly to a lack of support. You can have an awesome quarterback, but if he's got no one to throw to...","TMoney2591","Dec 07, 2012"

The beer does seem to have a defined sweet tone to it, in a malty kind of way. But also in a way that brings grain tones into the mix as well. Hearty ones, but not in a way that overpowers things. The overall verdict is that this is a pretty good blonde ale. A bit thick and hearty for the style, but it's alright. At least, worth trying.","RblWthACoz","Sep 03, 2012"

Smell is of malt/grain, and some mild grassy and hay aromas. Taste is of malt/grain, grass, and some herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is easy to drink but the aroma is a bit weak in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 28, 2012"

A small 1 finger head lasted for most of the beer. Constant streams of carbonation rose for about 15 minutes. Aroma was slightly sweet, and slightly wheaty. Taste was very pleasant, slightly citrusy, a tad sweet, a tad of hoppy bitterness, but very balanced. Felt ok in the mouth. Slightly over bitter on the toungue, but coated well and felt solid.
