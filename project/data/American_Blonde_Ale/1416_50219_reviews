"Light blonde beer, very dry and crisp with a heavy cereal and grain profile, grassy, nice hop hit at the end."

"Overall – A rather good summer style wheat/saison at only 4 % abv.  For the light alcohol level this is a fantastically flavorful brew and makes for one fantastic session .  Rather nice overall!!"

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, very mild kick, good representation of style, this is a nice beer to pound down for a long time."

"A good brew to drink in the summer as I look forward to its release every May; it isn't the best blonde ale, but it sure is refreshing when it's 100 degrees in the Salt Lake high desert sun! A solid summer seasonal by Uinta brewing."

"Overall: Refreshing and light with a bit more flavor than I was expecting; a nice summer quaffer"

"I think it's excellent and with an abv of only 4% this is a tasty little summer beer. Blonde ales are cousins to kolsch and this one sure reminds you of that. I would say that it's only flaw is that the bitterness becomes a bit much as it lingers."

"O - Plenty of flavor for 4% although day-to-day, I rather have a low ABV Pils like Troegs Sunshine Pils or Pilsner Urquell. I'd also take 21st Amendment Bitter American over this; keeping in mind, they all have about 10% more alcohol. Still; this is a good beer and I'll have it again."

""
""
""
""
"One thing's for sure- Uinta has done a fine job of capturing the taste of summer and the sun in a bottle."
""
""
"Overall: A solid, refreshing ale available in a can that delivers a fair amount of flavor in contrast to its low alcohol."

"O: Easy to drink, sessionable, and refreshing... A very enjoyable beer for a hot summer afternoon/evening."

"A thanks to the legendary woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a cloudy yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is malty, lemons, some floral notes. Taste is lemony, malts, a bit of floral hops, easy drinking and refreshing. Feels light in the mouth and overall would be a fine session beer."
""
"I heard a nice, loud Crack so I celebrated with an inverted Glug, resulting in two-plus fingers of soft, bone-white head with good retention that resembled meringue. Color was a hazy lemon-yellow (SRM = 4). Nose had a lemony, grassy scent and lemongrass was certainly a possibility. Frankly, it reminded me more of a Pilsner than a Blonde. Mouthfeel was very soft, caressing my poor, bruised tongue and washing it with a lemony, biscuity flavor. I stand behind thinking of it as a German Pilsner. Finish was semi-dry, refreshing and a definite possibility for inclusion in the cooler in the Sum'r, I mean, Summer."
""
"O - Decent session Summer beer that can be drank in mass quantities."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 6/14/2013. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy golden straw color with a 2 finger dense bright white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, apple, cracker, bready grain, floral, grass, light honey, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt and hop notes; with decent strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, apple, cracker, bready grain, light honey, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, cracker, bready grain, light honey, floral, grass, herbal, and earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and moderate robustness of hop, malt, and fruity ester flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately dry mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4%. Overall this is a nice blonde ale style. Good balance of hop and malt flavors with moderate robustness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"I like this beer. Yeah, it's got some minor flaws but who doesn't? I like a lot of these summer beers and this is no exception."
""
""
""

"Pours light gold with dissolving white foam. Wheaty citrus nose. Lemon. Smooth and sunny taste. A light tart rises up. Very slight hop at the finish. Really bright summer beer. Solid."
""
"Pours a light golden yellow with a thicker then expected white frothy head. Smell is doughy, slight hop, slight citrus. Taste is crisp, the doughy flavor is there with some malt and a slight citrus hop finish. A thicker mouthfeel then expected, a refreshing beer, really easy drinker. Overall a good beer that is done well. Really great summer beer, but I could have these all year round."
""

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, extremely light, golden-wheat color with a ton of carbonation throughout the body and a sparse, filmy, white surface coating of head. Aromas of toasted grain, tangy sweetness with hints of berries, and floral highlights. Flavors are roasty and toasty forward, with a subtle buttery and toffee backbone, and some floral hops highlights providing a hint of bitterness and pepper spice at the end of the palate. Light, crisp bodied kept effervescent by the carbonation. Tangy sweet and flowery aftertaste leading into a clean, slightly dry, crisp finish. Extremely easy to drink."
"Overall a standard session ale. An easy drinker."

"Overall unless you are looking for the low abv. you should pass on this beer."
""
""
"Overall: Definitely has the feel that a summer beer should. Chewy, creamy malt with light springy hops. Good for a hot day on the porch."
"Poured into becker pint glass; clear golden yellow with a medium white head that sticks around with lots of foam and lacing. Smell is lots of crackery malt and just a hint of citrus and grassy crisp hops. Taste is delicious; crisp, clean body of biscuity malt with a perfect pinch of juicy citrus and crisp hops. Another great session beet from Uinta."

"OVERALL: A pretty good ale, one that I would revisit in the right circumstances. It's light, drinkable, and has the refreshing quality a summer ale needs to have. Not too bad at all."
""
"The taste is upfront grainy but there are enough clean hops to balance it off. Also that lemon citrus activity is mellow but adds to the character."
""
"The aroma is OK, but nothing to write home about. A slight finishing hops aroma. Nice but subtle. The taste is a refreshing blandness. Not very anything. Similarly, the aftertaste is nothing either. It is something good to wash food down with or to drink many of on a hot day."
""

"Barely medium in body, it's got more heft than many blondes. It's also got a hard bite of crispness all the way through without giving up smoothness. A gently herbal edge gives a little dryness going into the finish."
"O: A nice little summer beer. Very easy to drink (dare I say session?), and a nice value too. A good amount of flavor for a 4% beer to boot. Worth a try"
""
"I picked up a bunch of different beer for the annual July 4th BBQ I really enjoyed this easy drinker. It was refreshing and just was plain ol good... It was out of a can ICY ICY cold... I could sit and while an afternoon away with the wife in the hammock and a Sum'r..."

"O - Tough to rate, considering style. For what this beer is brewed for, it's excellent - easy drinking and sessionable while providing a complementary depth of character to keep it interesting. I could certainly drink this all day. Well done blonde ale."

"How fast do you have to speak in order to pronounce this beer the way it's written? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of bone foam. The nose comprises sweet lemon peel, very light biscuit, and a hint of mint. The taste holds notes of thoroughly funky lemon peel, light wheat, a pinch of coriander, and a single miniature crystal of Belgian candi sugar. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, this beer just didn't quite do it for me. I get that it's meant to be light and ""refreshing"" for the warmer months and whatnot, but it's just too thin, too light, too insubstantial to really work, and the Sorachi hops, which actually can work at times, don't express themselves well enough, due mostly to a lack of support. You can have an awesome quarterback, but if he's got no one to throw to..."
""
"O: This is an easy drinking beer that is big on flavor and at 4% abv, I could knock back a bunch of these on a hot summer day. Wonderful beer."

"Man this is kind of an oddly sweet beer. At first I was thinking: what the heck? And I was also thinking: do I need to get milk tomorrow? Actually, that last part is a lie. The beer does seem to have a defined sweet tone to it, in a malty kind of way. But also in a way that brings grain tones into the mix as well. Hearty ones, but not in a way that overpowers things. The overall verdict is that this is a pretty good blonde ale. A bit thick and hearty for the style, but it's alright. At least, worth trying."
""
""

"Overall a sure fire winner of a summer ale worth a six pack a sitting."

"This was certainly a pretty hoppy take on an American Blonde and I didn’t mind one bit. This was flavorful, crisp and light on the palate, making for a pleasant drinkable experience. Uinta has been doing nicely for me this summer with these quaffable lighter beers."
"Pours a hazy light yellow with a 1 inch foamy white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt/grain, and some mild grassy and hay aromas. Taste is of malt/grain, grass, and some herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is easy to drink but the aroma is a bit weak in my opinion."

"From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Emigration Market in Salt Lake. Check out their selection of Utah singles."
"O/D-An unbelievably forgettable Summer Blonde that is nearly $11 for a six pack. Quite an incognito brew with a soggy price tag. My lack of success with Summer seasonals continues."
""

"Not a style I would go to often but I was grilling yesterday and this was nice to have all afternoon.Poured into a standard pint glass a clear lemon tinged light golden with a thinner white head atop.The aromas were actually quite complex with lemony hops,toasted cereal grain,and a hint of biscuit.Lighter mouthfeel was expected but it didn't deter much from the beer,bright lemony notes along with a grainy element that lingers into a nice finish.One of the better beers I can think of if you want a low alcohol but flavorful blonde ale."
""
"A well done American Blonde. Lot's of flavor, but easy drinking and refreshing."

"Pours a clear, gold color. 3/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of slight earthy malt, caramel malt, sweet malt, hint of yeast, and a hint of citrus hops. Fits the style of an American Blonde Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, pale malt, hint of wheat, hint of citrus hops, slight caramel malt, and a hint of spice. Overall, good appearance, aroma, feel, blend, and body."
"O - Pretty good beer for the sum'r season. Gives a decent amount of flavor and the light hops is a nice finish. Would certainly share a few over a barbecue."
"O- decent beer. Would be great in the summer. The only real complaint is the excessive use of malt."
"Overall- Much better the second night out of the growler..."
"O - Good not but not Great i wouldn't buy again over the wasatch kolesch."
"Nothing more then expected, decent summer quaffer"
"While I appreciate the crispness, dryness, and low alcohol content, the flavors are so offputting that I found this to be most unpleasant. However, I feel that this isn't a poorly crafted ale, hence I cannot legitimately rate it lower - despite my near thorough unenjoyment."
"Overall a very light, refreshing beer to be enjoyed on a nice hot day, low alcohol allows you to partake on a few while working outdoors."
"Notes: A couple of months since bottling so maybe on a fresher version the Sorachi might shine more on the nose and palate… Still it is still holding up pretty well. Last year I was curious to try it and this time I did not want to let it go by despite the pricing… Too expensive for what it is. Otherwise this would make for a fine easy social refreshing ale."
"Golden yellow that is slightly hazy. Almost no head just a bunch of large bubbles sticking to the sides. Light/Pilsner malt aroma with some lemon grass. Somewhat sour like macro lager. Flavor is carbonated and crisp. Extremely pale/sour malty let down. There is a light grassy hop finish that separates it from the category of bad macro brew."
"o - i could definitely see myself drinking a few of these under the hot sun. never been to utah but id assume this would be perfect when its hot there. nice one."
"D/O: The lightest ales are a simple pleasure when they are served in a seasonally appropriate fashion--when refreshment becomes a bigger part of why we drink. This beer is no exception, with the ability to quench a powerful thirst and still provide an interesting, if understated, display of malt and hops."
"Overall - not a bad brew, but also not very interesting. Good tasting."
"O-I could drink this all day."
"O: This is a summer ale. The flavours are quite good and very drinkable. Not summer yet, but a low alcohol option to consider when the hot days come around."
"D) A decent summer, this one poured a little warmer than proper, so it would've been a bit better."
"Poured into a hefe glass. Color was a very light pale straw with a milky white head. Initially poured a 3 finger head that lasted 5-10 minutes. A small 1 finger head lasted for most of the beer. Constant streams of carbonation rose for about 15 minutes. Aroma was slightly sweet, and slightly wheaty. Taste was very pleasant, slightly citrusy, a tad sweet, a tad of hoppy bitterness, but very balanced. Felt ok in the mouth. Slightly over bitter on the toungue, but coated well and felt solid. A nice summer beer. Definitely worth drinking."
"Mouthfeel is light with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"A refreshing, tasty and fresh blonde ale. The best one so far for me."
"The highly-refreshing drink is light-bodied and thoroughly carbonated, but not at all obnoxiously so. Highly quaffable. Thanks to Wasatch for the bottle!"
"Pours an almost clear straw with a chill haze forming quickly as the near pure-white, one-finger head dissipating into a bubbly froth. Crisp malts, light fruits and near indiscernible hops all float to the nose. A bit dry going down with some malts, a surprising hoppiness, and a good, somewhat delayed fruit hit at the end. Light-bodied and highly drinkable, but still tasty, which is what I look for in a good summer sessioner. Could polish a few of these off easily if I had access to em'."
"Thanks John!"
"An ideal summer brew. Crisp, clean, and extremely refreshing. Light in body, but not in flavor. Great for a nice session on the deck into the evening hours."
"Pours a clean/clear light yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight yeast. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, some slight hop notes, yeasty. Medium body. Drinkable, another organic brew from Four +."
