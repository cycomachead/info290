This pale ale has a mild aroma which consists of hops, malt and some citrus. The aroma is pleasant. The taste, on the other hand is my favorite. Please do not judge me, but the taste is like a combination of hops, lemony citrus and some good skunk weed from the west coast(no really!!). This pale ale goes above and beyond and balances the citrus and hops so well. This beer is refreshing, feels good on the palate, and leaves you wanting more and more.

3.96,11.2,3.75,4.5,3.75,4,3.75,"BOD 4/11/14. Pours a clear amber that is slightly beyond golden with a faint hint of red. Normal head with weak lacing retention. Excellent nose of tropical hops (mango, passion fruit) over a light biscuit sweetness. Almost light medium bodied with an above normal carbonation level that effervesces nicely on the finish. The taste profile is well balanced between hop flavor and sweetness. It is more spicy than tropically oriented, which is surprising based upon the hop bill and nose, over a nice biscuit sweetness background. The finish is crisp and effervesces into a tropical peppery note.","tillmac62","Jul 17, 2014"

3.24,-9,3,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.25," Overall a solid 3.25 for Big Wave Golden Ale from Kona Brewing Co. Its very light and refreshing. Just a little TOO light, or I would've ranked it higher.

4.3,20.8,4.5,5,4,3.75,4.25,"The Blonde and I were both beginning to sweat in anticipation, or maybe it was just attributable to the heat and humidity, but I was quick with the pour. The pseudo-cascade died down, creating two fingers of rocky, bone-white head that began to fall, leaving nice lacing in its wake. The color was a bright, sunshine-yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4), like liquid sunshine in my glass! This would be far more heartening on a dreary winter day, but it was already hot and humid here in my kitchen. Nose was very fruity - peaches, mangoes, papaya, guava, even coconut. Aloha, honey! Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. The taste was entirely fruity, like Juicyfruit chewing gum or a roll of Tropical Fruit Life Savers. My my. I stand behind all of the fruits that I mentioned on the nose with the exception of coconut. I may have been hallucinating on that one. Finish was semi-sweet, not quite semi-dry, but quite refreshing on this occasion.","woodychandler","Jul 14, 2014"

Luckily, the beers smells much better. Once I take a swig I am again reassured that this is much more than a cheap domestic. Hints of citrus in an otherwise bland unsurprising swig. I like it though its somewhat refreshing. overall I rate this beer 3.00 okay. I would not recommend this to a friend however I would recommend this if your other options are unfavorable or unknown.

Pleasant, mild, floral hop aroma. Flavor is in line, mild and neutral. Somewhat fizzy, but drinkable. Slightly nutty grain flavor pleasantly complemented by tropical fruit hop flavors. This beer mostly succeeds in being inoffensive and drinkable. The exception, of course, is that it's really too boring to be a session ale.","hreb","Jun 16, 2014"

3.51,-1.4,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.25,"Overall I thought this was decent beer and a solid example of a Blonde/Golden Ale, it had most of the aspects that I would expect from the style, it had a pretty bright aroma, but I found myself wishing it tasted more like it smelled. This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, clean, a little crisp, not filling and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I could see myself drinking a couple of these when it's warm out, but I think after two I would start to get bored with it. What I like the most about this beer was the aroma, it was pretty nice and I thought it was the highlight of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was that taste, it came off a little bland and I wish it was a little more like the aroma. I might buy this beer if I want an easy drinking beer, but I don't think it's something that I need to keep in the fridge and I think it's worth trying at least once, but I doubt it will be an instant favorite. I think it's a nice beer to enjoy in warm weather. All in all I thought this was a fairly solid beer, it wasn't the most memorable, but for a Golden Ale I thought the aroma was pretty memorable and it had a pretty even amount of pros and cons. So far this is my favorite beer from Kona, but it isn't a favorite of the style. Nice job guys, this was a nice easy drinking beer, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Apr 21, 2014"

This offering, Big Wave, does a pretty decent job. Out of the bottle, it's none too impressive - your normal yellow, run-of-the-mill beer color - not much head, but surprisingly it has good lacing. The odor is absolutely wonderful, fresh and citrusy. Mouthfeel would be outstanding to me if it weren't so carbonated - it just takes away from the feel for me. Taste-wise, I liked it. The brew was bold, fresh, I could taste the citrus and it mixed well with the hops. Unfortunately, there was just something there - I just couldn't grade it outstanding. Overall, it's a good beer, I definitely enjoyed the two I just had...","jjamadorphd","Feb 21, 2014"

Aromas of lemon zest, orange zest, pineapple, tangerine, floral, grass, pine, cracker, light bread, light honey, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of hop notes with moderate malt presence; and solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange zest, pineapple, floral, grass, toast, bread, cracker, light honey, and floral earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pineapple, toast, bread, cracker, floral, grass, and floral earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice and pleasant flavor profile with very balanced hop/malt flavors; with a solid amount of robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish as expected of 4.4%.

Very soft flavors in the mouth; muted without being watery, tastes of water crackers, unleavened bread, lightly spicy hop finish. Very clean, easy and pleasant session beer, tasting like a cream/blonde style of ale.","Aaron_Ramson","Aug 24, 2013"

Anyway, this stuff pours a clear golden-straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises old mango, funky lemon peel, mild grass, and a few tablespoons of honey. The taste focuses on the lemon, with a slightly decreased sense of funk, altogether tempered by a crisp, watery biscuit-ish character. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp-ish finish. Overall, an odd little beer, one that seems to wanna be a lightly fruity blonde, but one that ends up a watered-down and funky husk of its own aspirations.","TMoney2591","Jan 22, 2013"

Still, there's a decent hoppy finish which is dry but only a little bitter.

Smell is of malt/grains and maybe some grassy/veggie aromas. A bit of a metallic aroma as well. Taste is of malt/grains, grass/veggies, and salt. Why is this beer salty at all? A mild bitterness after each sip. This beer has a pretty good carbonation but it is slightly thick feeling for some reason. Overall, this is not a very good beer. I am still curious as to why this is salty.","UCLABrewN84","Nov 29, 2011"

Sure, there were times when he would help out the project and ease construction in a limited fashion, but mostly he found himself cast aside, waiting for others to step in and help. “Don’t get down Reggie,” the slim solid 4 block Agapantha would console him, “we all, you know we all get sore sometimes, that’s just how Tetris goes, line eat line world.” Despite these consoling remarks, deep down Reggie knew he was unwanted. He could feel the disappointed glares when he would arrive next in line and announce his willingness. “Ah jeez, I don’t…I don’t know, just put him wherever, we will figure that one out…later I guess.” Reggie sighed a generic sigh and held his head up high, waiting for his day in the sun.","SubpoenaDeuces","Jun 20, 2011"

Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a hazy light gold color with about a half inch white head which went away quickly. Lacing is average. The aroma is light, it smells like bready malt, honey, and a bit of fruit. The taste is exactly the same as the aroma, I can taste the bit of fruitiness in this beer but I can't figure out exactly what kind of fruit it is. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it seems a bit slick with decent carbonation. It's still light, but had more substance than I expected. Drinkability is decent, it's not hard to drink at all. Not a bad brew, but it's not my favorite of the Kona beers I've tried.","bluejacket74","Jan 17, 2010"
