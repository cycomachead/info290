2.55,-24.1,3,3,2,3.5,2.5,"I have seen this bottle several times before buying one as a part of a mix and match your own sixpack. THis was the only of the six that was not an IPA and that was because coming from San Antonio, I have an affinity for the Alamo and Texas in general (five of the six were Texas brews). I struggled to figure out where in the world this beer came from. THe label indicated it is a product of Real Ale Brewing in Blanco, bu the website is a completely different company, so obviously Real Ale must be contract brewing for them while they build up the brand. I am a huge Real Ale fan and consider Fireman's Four (SMaSH brew or not) the best lawnmower beer around. Since I am firmly in camp with Real Ale I cannot falt their technique and must fault the recipe for what turned out to be a dissapointing experience. The brew is crystal clear, and pours with a slight head if agitated which leaves light lacing, but the hop profile is almost non-existant and reminded me of a BMC rather than blond ale (like Fireman's Four). THe malt is strangely out in front and does not seem well balanced with any bittering hops I could distinguish. I prefer a blond ale with a light malt body that is subtle and there mostly to support about 25 IBUs, but this seems closer to 5 or 6.","tomnoble","Jul 14, 2012"

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. It poured a clear, slightly-darker-than-straw color, with a decent head on it that hung around a little bit. Smell was of light malts and a touch of hops. Flavor followed suit. A decent hit of malts, blended with a light flavor of hops. Produces a clean and crisp flavor and mouthfeel. It's nothing spectacular, but it's a decent ale. It could be improved with only a little work. However, that said, given the Alamo theme, my feeling is that it's more targeted towards the average beer drinker who's visiting Texas and gets pulled in by the novelty of the label. Still, it's worth a try. I could see it being a great hot-summer-day type beer. Better than a macro lager.","YonderWanderer","Dec 06, 2007"

2.75,-18.2,3,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,"What a fun idea - I love the Alamo. But is this the best we can drink to drink to the Alamo? Refreshing and light? Yes. Tasty? No, not really. I assume this brew is targeted to more-of-your-average-beer-drinker-crowd-type persons, but why cant it taste better? It is just shy of good.","MrHungryMonkey","Apr 19, 2007"

3.81,13.4,4,3,4,3.5,4.5,"From a beer trade, first time I've heard of this, hopefully this will be distributed back east. Pours a hazy golden orange color. Smell is of light citrus. Taste is a citrusy hop flavor quite like graprfruit which fades out quite quickly. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than expected. But overall this is a really great beer to drink, reminds me of a more flavorful summer ale. I think this is the only style Alamo makes, hopefully they will branch out a bit more.","Manosbeeroffate","Nov 07, 2005"
3.72,10.7,3,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Picked this up just before leaving SA on the way back to IL. Had to wait more than 24 hours before trying. I wish I'd had a chance to sample a draft version, but this one is a very drinkable ale. One I will definitely get again next time in the River City.","kdog630","Aug 07, 2005"

I don't know if this is the same "Alamo" beer I tried at the Menger hotel in San Antonio (going on two years ago) or a completely new concoction. The alamobeer website only furthered my befuddlement.","DarthMalt","Jan 16, 2005"

4.03,19.9,3.5,3,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall Impression: Very enjoyable. Refreshing and clean, this is a great summer session or lawnmower. I think the label and name are a bit gimmicky, but what ever it takes to get Real Ales product out there. Strongly recommended!","HardTarget","Nov 15, 2004"
3.53,5.1,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Alamo Golden is a hazy golden orange in color. Head is white and frothy. The aroma is a fairly nondescript, generic sweetness. Not bad smelling, but not much character. Taste is sweet, almost as if there is a little honey involved. There is also a distinct herbal, tea-like taste towards the middle of the sip. Finish is a lingering combination of sweet malts and herbal flavor. Drinkability is very good, this is a nice lighter ale for sessioning. Still this beer isn't nearly as good as the other Real Ale offerings I've sampled.","Gagnonsux","Beers"

4.07,21.1,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer is a slightly hazy, dirty gold with a small, white, foamy head. The aroma is nutty, a little sour, a little wheaty, a little floral. The front is tangy, fruity and floral. The fizzy middle is fruity, light and a little milky. The finish is very roasty and nutty, with some nice bitterness and a little more fruit. Delicious. A long, lingering grainsy aftertaste. Apple burps. It's a nice, flavorful, nutty blonde. I like it a lot.","kbub6f","Beers"
3.53,5.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Alamo in a bottle pours with a quickly dissipating head and is a rich gold. There are slight citrus notes and some floral hops in the nose. This is a great for those that like some character in their beer without going over the top in any of the aspects. While this is not terribly light, it is a summery beer with a decent balance. A little hay and orange peel in the aftertaste.","TPoling","0"
