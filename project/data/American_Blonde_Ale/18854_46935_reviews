"Weak and lacking flavor. Needs more personality."

"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very light, a touch of malts. Taste is malty, bready, some sweetness, smooth and easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a refreshing beer."
""
"Taste is mild and malty, but balanced nonetheless. A very engaging session ale here, though it certainly won’t impress hop-heads or most beer nerds. I can imagine this being quite refreshing on a hot summer day. Overall, not a complicated brew, but certainly an enjoyable one."

"Draught: This one poured a clear, golden yellow color. There was a bit of a white foamy head that didn’t last long but did leave some lacing. Decent but lighter aroma. Malts, bit of corn, faint breadiness. The taste is half decent. A bit of malt sweetness, bit of the corn, some graininess and faint grassiness. Not sweet, but no bitterness at all. Taste is OK. Not exciting, but not bad either."

"O- Nothing to scream about, but there are definitely worse blonde ales out there. I don't regret the purchase of a six-pack since I and my friends will enjoy every one."

"O - Overall, an average blonde ale. Too sweet/malty for my tastes."

"Had this one while out sightseeing in New Orleans! Served from tap into an Abita shaker. Poured golden with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, musty, skunk, wheat, and grain. The flavor was of sweet malt, grain, wheat, earth, and metallic. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was an average brew. Unfortunately nothing on this one really stood out for me for this style. It seemed to be a pretty average example of the style with the earthy and wheat flavors going on. I really wish it could have had a just a little more going on to make my palate jump up and down with joy. They do good beers, but this isn’t one of my favorites."

"O: My score is significantly higher than the critical mass on this one, but I'm judging NOLA Blonde against the competition of low-ABV session ales. And this is as good as it gets in the middle-tier price range. Blows the doors off all the other blah Southern session ales, comes only in a can, has a lot of flavor, and won't have you on the floor if you happen to burn through a bunch. NOLA can be a little hit or miss, but the Blonde really works."
"Poured from tap into tulip flute glass at a restaurant in the French Quarter. Poured golden color with slight head. Very mild malty macro aroma but slight crisp hop. Taste is good for a blonde...crisp, mild, slightly sweet citrus. Its ok, but there are much better brews out there...but, yes; it is a good ""intro to craft beer""...but there is about a billion miles between this and something like a Firestone walker Anniversary brew..."
"Drink- It was tasty, probably the 1st blonde ale ive really enjoyed. Would have this one again on a hot day while drinking from a can."
""
"overall - not a bad beer, just a bit boring."

"Overall, not a phenomenal beer, but pretty good for its style, very drinkable and great for a hot night."

"Sessionable, tasty as far as blonde ales...cans are always a plus."
""
"in a style where the top rated beer rates below a 4, this is one to check out...i expect this to rise to the top few if more people tick it with an open mind to the style."
"In general, I do not particularly love the American Blonde Style. I cannot deny this. That being said, this is pretty remarkable. It's much less boring than I anticipated. This is not only better than the typical blonde ale, it's simply a good beer."
""
"I’ve never been a huge fan of American Blonde Ales. NOLA Brewing Company has done a nice job with this one. The nice fruit and hop flavors really make things tick. It’s not very deep or complex, but it is tasty nonetheless. As far as American Blondes go, it’s a pretty good option. Check it out."
""
"Pours a hazed light golden yellow, good cap of white froth, okay retention. Scent leads with a blend of light citrus and light doughy bread, not much else. Taste is light as expected, light fresh citrus and a splash of fruity and sweet esters, some faint kisses of doughy bread again. Medium bodied, good moderate carbonation. Nice intro to the brewery and one that I would love to share with some craft beer noobs."
""
""
"M: Lively and fruity, the citrus lasts throughout with just a bit of hop bitterness. Nothing fancy but a good tasting ale."
""

"O= A tasty treat indeed. A friend picked it up for me from New Orleans and while I was a little disapointed it was a blonde ale it was free, a snapshot of a new brewery for myself as well as a damn good blonde ale. I really wanna see what else these guys do now."

"Dammit, I should be watching the Saints with this beer, rather than the Broncos. Oh well, I guess God's in there somehow either way, right? It pours a lightly hazy gold topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises wheat, light coriander, lemon peel, and a sort of Brett-like funk that seems rather out of place here. The taste brings in more of the same, with a light pinch of black pepper and a bit more lemon zest than before. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda grainy feel. Overall, a more-than-ordinary brew, one I'm glad to have tried for the sake of it, but nothing I'd ever really look to have again."

"O: This is an easy-drinking lawnmower ale if I've ever had one. Simple, yet not at all boring. There certainly isn't focus on any one particular flavor - but I'm enjoying the final product nonetheless. This is a fun beer."

"O: Harkening back to the old 'drinkability' score on BA, this one approaches '5' Territory... excellent on a mild fall afternoon or three, and (I'd imagine) ridiculously refreshing on a hot summer's day. This was a hit with everyone in my group, from beer novice to connoisseur... I'd love to have access to this one year-round. Great job, NOLA!"

"A solid blonde ale."
""
"Overall: if I went for lighter tasting beers, this would make a fine session brew. The bitter finish was a turnoff. Better on tap."
"Had a glass at the Blue Nile on Frenchmen. This reminds me of Chelsea's Checker Cab Blond, though this was a bit more mild. The spicy hop finish was subtle, but tasty, as was the light pale malt backing. The barley was a fairly plain white toast flavor, but it was all appropriate for the blonde ale style."
"A great summer beer. Easy to drink."
"An excellent lighter bodied beer. Plenty of flavor, a great crisp body, and goes down like water. Something that is great for the hotter months or general everyday drinking. Highly recommended."
"Good brew. I love the warm malts and the way they sit with the fruits."
"I want to like this beer. It just tastes a little off to me. It has a nice upfront flavor - what I would expect from a blonde. The finish gets me though. There is a hop bitterness that I don't expect or really appreciate in this style. The head disappeared right away and there was no lacing present. I can't think of much good to say about this one."
"Not much to write home about on this one. Awkwardly put together, with a grainy malt character on par with most mainstream macro offerings. Indifferent hopping and a bit watery at the finish - not really even interesting enough to throw in the ""refreshing lawnmower beer"" category. I tossed the last of my beer simply because I got bored with it."
"Nice blonde ale with a deep tranluscent golden hue. Nice creamy head that lasts. Has a cream soda smell right now but there is a lasy next to me with some nice perfume on. Balanced malt and hop taste. Pilsner malts and a dry hop bite a present. Very drinkable as it goes down smooth on a hot Alabama day."
"Nice beer. Served with a thick, foamy, frothy, white head and lots of lace. Color was a clear amber. Aroma was malt, grain, cereal with a bit of hop. Flavor was like aroma. Good body and carbonation. Short finish like flavor. Easy drinking session brew."
"AV"
"Crisp and mildly bitter with a trace amount of noble hops present in the aftertaste. Clean with a vaguely fruity yeast presence. Fairly simple yet it hits the spot nicely. Well carbed, crisp and refreshing. Good session candidate for warm weather."
"D - I could have had the 1L growler on my own. Solid lawnmower beer that is true to style and has a slight extra kick in the aroma. Would be good for a hot summer day in New Orleans."
"On tap 02/10/2010 at The Avenue Pub in New Orleans. pours a medium golden color with light head. Aroma of yeast, light citrus, pine and light on the malts. A bit sweet to the taste with slight hop presence in the finish. Okay, not memorable compared to the Hopatoulis (sp?) or the Brown, but it is a bit above average."
"RJT"
"As a side note, I've also had this on cask a couple times, and I bet I would probably rate it close to all 5s. Incredibly smooth with a much more powerful aroma and flavor. The regular version is good, though not entirely spectacular. But if you ever get the chance to try dry-hopped on cask, it is not to be missed."
"Note: the light of the bar and the smoke may have affected my review."
"This is a very drinkable beer; quite sessionable. Perfect on a hot day. I reminds me a lot of a Pale Wheat Ale but more fruity."
"D - This was a very crisp, clean flavor that has high sessionable qualities, a great Blonde Ale and a great start to the NOLA Brewing Company!"
"Overall- A great beer from a new New Orleans brewery. This is a perfect beer for the heat and humidity of New Orleans."
