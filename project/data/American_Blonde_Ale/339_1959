Occasion: lazy Sunday, post mattress-shopping peace....Appearance: nice golden copper body with subtle effervescence; white sudsy lacing--a good start... Aroma: lemony zest on top of a crisp, clean hop aroma; some lawn mower clippings are hinted at... Palate: medium-bodied, with a presence late at the throat; a pillow-quality body, perfect for this heat... Taste: not much in the way of complexity; grassy notes at the end with some herbal/floral hints--but oddly maltier than a saison usually is... Overall: a low alcohol (4.6 ABV) allows this to be a pleasant pre-lawn mowing brew; the overall experience is within its genre....","dacrza1","Jul 07, 2013"

4,14.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a somewhat hazy golden color with a very white, very foamy head that fades to a cap. Lightly sweet, and lightly funky in the nose. Pleasant. The taste is similar- some nice fruitiness, with notes of red apple and pear as well as some breadiness, a hint of bitterness, and a little bit of funk. Restrained, and very refreshing, but enough interesting flavors to hold your attention. This is in no way an American Blonde Ale, and those looking for such will be disappointed. This, as the label attests, is a classic Belgian farmhouse style ale. Call it a Saison if you will, but not a blonde. I enjoyed it, and suspect that many that didn't are looking for something more mundane.","Georgiabeer","Aug 06, 2011"

3.57,2.6,3,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Flying Fish Farmhouse Summer Ale pours a brilliantly clear sunshine yellow. There's a bit of wispy white foam sitting atop the beer, but it vanishes without a trace pretty quickly. The nose has some of grainy sweetness, but almost smells a bit like some corn product was used as an adjunct. There's also a small earthy-noble hop note to the aroma. The flavor is almost identical, same grain, corn, and hoppy points get hit on. Bitterness is pretty much nonexistent mid palate. If anything I'd say the hops are just a touch more present here (to the beer's credit), but it's really not enough of a difference that I can bump taste up to the next score. The body is surpremely light, makes it very drinkable/thirst quenching for the hot weather. The carbonation, if measured in volumes, would probably be a bit on the low side. However, when paired with this thin (and I say that with no negative connotation) body, it definitely pops a little and adds some liveliness. The great mouthfeel makes me wish the flavor profile was a little more fine tuned on Flying Fish's Farmhouse Summer Ale, because I think then it would make close to an ideal summer beer.","axeman9182","Jul 11, 2011"

The word ""farmhouse"" in the title is generally appealing, the word ""summer"" on the other hand... I've heard saison yeast can be tricky to handle, but I'm somewhat surprised they just copped out with just a standard English ale yeast. At least they did go for a sour mash. So the beer is a tasty blonde, yes, even a very fine ""summery"" beer, but I'd a bit happier if they dropped the word ""farmhouse"" from the label.","ChainGangGuy","May 16, 2011"
3.57,2.6,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"O: This is a light beer that does not have an extreme amount of flavor. However, it is a summer beer. This beer has high drinkability. More to the point, it is an easy to drink beer that still has some nice flavor. There is some fruit, mild biscuit, and crispness from the hops. It is on the drier side, but the hops are not as aggressive as an IPA or even a pilsner.

The nose comprises wheat, light coriander, light lemon zest, graham crackers, orange peel, and some fresh spring flowers. The taste is heavy on the citrus notes (orange peel, lemon zest, a splash of ruby red grapefruit), but they all blend together into a muddled citrus-y mess; coriander, cardamom, and a pinch of nutmeg round things out on the tongue. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish.

Taste is the same way, crisp, clean, with some lemon, but the corny taste sticks around. It's like a craft version of a macro, if that makes sense. I'm just not a huge fan of blonde ales I guess.

The finish is a mix of bitterness from the hops and a bit of that typical farmhouse funkiness. Mouthfeel is, well, average at best.

There was no freshness date to be found anywhere on the bottle. This is a very tasty and enjoyable beer. It poured a clean and clear golden yellow to golden orange color. Very clear and golden yellow when back lit. There was almost perfect carbonation bubbling up from the bottom. Nice two finger head with a rough pour. There is a strong lacing down the glass and nice head retention. It still had at least a quarter inch of head 3/4 of the way down the glass. Smell is light and airy with a slight hint of spice. It certainly has some pale malt and a dough like scent mixed in the nose. Perhaps some mild clove and some sweetness as well maybe some pineapple and banana tones. There is a slight tang or sour note in there too. The taste is smooth and very easy to drink. There is a taste of pale malt with a nice dry flavor in the beginning of the taste. No real sweetness found on the pallet. The dryness gives way to a nice spice flavor with some slight bitterness. Subtle hop oil lingers in the back ground. The finish also lends itself toward the dry side. Very nice mouth feel and a great taste. I wish I could find this beer further north but I think it pretty much stays in NJ.

2.76,-20.7,4,3,2.5,2,3,"Overall - bland. What smoothness there was came more from thinness than anything else. While not awful, and I had two or three and will be able to eventually finish the 6-pack (or find someone to help me do so), its blandness and aftertaste would not have me choose this again for a summer brew. Not satisfying.","jwc215","Aug 05, 2006"

Not much in the way of a typical saison aroma - not much yeast, or grass, or spiceness. I read one review that called in a blond ale. Kind of a plain beer.Not a good example of a saison, but it is a beer one could drink during a summer afternoon.","doubleipa","Jun 28, 2006"
2.65,-23.9,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Drinkability: The beer has a decent drinkability with no true flaws. I might have scored it higher if it was marketed as a blond ale.

At first sip it seems like it is going to be too carbonated, but it smooths out considerably at the finish. The saison yeast is less noticeable in this beer than in other saisons I have had.

Taste is a slightly sweet lemony malt with balanced by a small dose of floral hops. This doesn't have any of the spiciness or the slight tartness I've come to expect of saisons. Mouthfeel is thin and very carbonated. This is a rather mediocre offering that isn't a good example of the style at all.","cubedbee","Aug 31, 2005"

Nose was odd--malts with an attempt at spices but such a menagerie of spices I cannot even begin to place them. In terms of taste, I am not sure whether this is truly a saison. Very light and crisp with somewhat of a dry finish. Also, like the aroma the flavor is so mushed togeterh I cannot honestly place much of anything other than some slightly sweet malts and a light layer of bittering hops. There is some other flavors present, but they are so blended into each other I cannot place them. For me... just not a very interesting beer.","MuddyFeet","Aug 24, 2005"

I can't put my finger on the sweetness. Its somewhat floral. The flavor is a little light comparted to the nose. The lemoney floral component is most dominant with the light peppery spice playing second string. I get a light metallic twinge on the finish. The feel is moderate to thick with a moderate carbonation. Maybe a touch too thick for me. I'd like a litte drying on the finish too. The drinkability is very good. Its a refreshing and crisp brew.

A little bit of a dichotomy there, but one that benefits it when it comes time to choose which beer to drink. This is absolutely a great lawnmower beer. But, I think the cask has something to do with that, as the bottle is not in this league. A shame, really, that I can't keep a cask on my deck for after my yardwork.","Foxman","Apr 23, 2005"

It has a grainy pale malt flavor that boasts also of wheat and a fruity yeast finish. It goes down with ease and finishes a bit tart and fruity. The mouthfeel is good.

Great malty flavor with a slight hop bitterness.Some very nice residual yeastiness in the backround .Very smooth on the palate-nicely built for only a 4.6% beer.I could seriously drink this all night no matter what the season.

The flumes of quick-rising, tiny bubbles add to the appearance. The head is big-bubbled at first, but holds well and leaves some very good lace. After the initial pour has settled, the bubbles become smaller. The aroma is interesting: citrus - mainly lemony, a gentle peppery spiciness, some herbal & grassy notes, very soft summer fruit - crushed raspberry, perhaps?, and a very slight acetic note. The body is light with a highly effervescent carbonation that gives a zesty mouthfeel and makes the beer appear bigger than it is. The flavor offers a gentle malt sweetness that's well balanced by hop bitterness, a light spiciness, and the bite of the CO2. It finishes with a mouth-coating citrusy malt that lingers for some time, and some residual pockets of bitterness. Light but interesting, with some very nice character. Refreshing and enjoyable. Well done. With the addition of some yeast characteristics, this could be exceptionally nice.","NeroFiddled","Sep 24, 2002"
