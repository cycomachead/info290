"Nothing special. Very pale. Annoyingly bland after two."

"Good full flavored beer.   Hint of wheat overtones.   Light enough for Summer consumption, but full flavored enough to enjoy anytime."

"Pours a clear golden yellow with a nice white head. There was no real and defiant smell to the beer. Taste is pretty bland for a summer beer, there is no stand out ingredient that really screams summer. Mouthfeel is a lightly carbonated beer that hangs around for a little bit. Overall it's a little below average and really not worth it. #t6pp"

"Overall: Better than the Narragansett lager, and a bit more expensive, coming in at just over $8/sixer here in Boston. However, for this price and quantity (16oz cans), I'd be hard pressed to find a better sessionable summer beer that doesn't blast me with hops. Would definitely recommend, especially if you're looking for a party/BBQ beer."

"This is a nice light beer that is easily quaffable. There isn't much here in the way of flavor but it is refreshing and easy to drink straight from the can. This is a great BMC replacement beer as well as a light lawnmower or tailgate beer."

"overall a good summer beer. hard to see anyone not liking it. not going to be anyone's favorite but it is what you expect it to be."

"Overall, this is decent summer fare, with a good arrangement of flavors in decent quantities, the beer obviously designed to be light, crisp, and refreshing, while still maintaining good flavors, and succeeding very nicely in doing so. It’s a bit of a shame that the initial flavors couldn’t last longer, and that the hops come to so heavily dominate the beer over time, but this is still a very nice brew."
""
""
""
""

"Overall great for the warm weather or anything outdoors. Will be picking this one up again."
"notes: Heftier than any other Blonde Ale I've had. Reminds me of an English Bitter. Well done."

"What a solid, refreshing take on all of the generic ""summer ales"" that come around. This has the flavor and character of a good lager, and yet the thickness of an ale that gives me the best of two worlds. It's not complex by any means, but maybe I wouldn't want to have a super complex beer every day of the week, and by no means when I'm out and about on a picnic or beach someplace. This is nearly a British session beer, and I could consume many in a row. Three of their beers in, I'm yet to find a brewery as Narragansett that does offerings this simple and equally enjoyable as they do."

"Overall (3.5): It is what it is. It’s not perfect, it’s not exceptional, but it’s plenty easy to drink and pleasant in all the ways that count. Exceptional in any way? No. Great in any way? No. Very good in any way? Maybe if it’s hot out and you didn’t expect to see this kind of beer around. It’s just fine, and that’s fine by me. Glad I got a sixer, because this is an easy going beer."

"An easy summer drinker. Not remarkable, but good enough flavor."

"O - Great summer beer. It's almost like a light pale ale if that makes sense. You get the flavors of a pale ale, but with less bitterness. Impressive that 'Gansett pulled this off."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden beer with a thick, foamy head that dissipates slowly and leaves lots of lacing. Crisp grass and zesty lemon aromas with some floral hints. Flavors of grasses and grain with soft lemon rind notes. Has a light, dry body that makes it perfect for cooling off on a hot summer day."
""
""
"Clear, golden yellow with a tall, thick white head, this beer produces some beautiful lace. The beer is light in complexion and fruity in aroma. Estery, slight malt, a touch of herbal hops, distant citrus. Nice. The flavor is light, as is the body. Nice for summer, but it does give us a little complexity and intensity. Slight sweetness, but the finish is abrupt. Good summer brew."
"I purchased a 6-pack of these cans for the beach and they absolutely hit the spot. It was light enough to be enjoyable with a refreshing and clean flavor profile. And they're priced just right!"

"O) Not bad for a summer ale. I'll definitely drink another."
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and is a perfect beer for the summer. It has a bit of citrusy flavors similar to a West Coast IPA but these are very subdued."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice summer beer. Very drinkable."
"Overall, good, definitely a little tame but nice hops/flavor for the low ABV+style. Easy drinkability and price will probably make this a regular summer purchase for me."
""
"A good blonde ale with a noticable hop presence. A bit grainy and the hop bitterness lingers but still quite refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into an imperial pint glass a clear light golden with a 1/2 finger white head atop.Aromas were real light a bit of floral hops and toasted grain,really light to be honest.grainy with mild sweetness on the palate,a light smattering of leafy hops,a decent toasted ceral grain note in the finish.It's not bad...maybe rated to high but it's good for what it is,a summertime quaffer."
""
""
""
""
"Malt flavor with a touch of grain that wasn't present in the aroma. There's a flowery hop punch in the swallow. A very smooth beer with enough crispness to keep the body spritzy. An excellent Blonde."
""
"Lighter medium body, well carbonated, refreshing and cooling on the senses. This beer isn't trying to blow you away, which actually works perfectly. I'm not really a fan of the style but I'd definitely buy this again."
"16oz can purchased at McKinnon's in Portsmouth. Pours a crystal-clear straw-yellow body with a good inch of surprisingly persistent off-white head. Smells sweet and bready with hints of lemon zest. Tastes bready at first with a good bit of lemon-like hops toward the finish. Light and effervescent. Super-drinkable. A lot more to this one than I thought there would be. Really good."
""
"O: not a bad beer. It was an enjoyable beer. I'm glad I got a sixpack of this. I would definitely have this again."
""
""
"O: This beer is very refreshing, enjoyable, and easy to drink. I would love to have another one of these, it was surprisingly good (not that I should be too surprised as I have liked each of the beers I have had from them). The hop-forward flavor with the grapefruit hops was quite enjoyable."
""
"Another workman brew from Narragansett. Nothing wrong with this one, just a decent beer at a good price."
"O: This is a simple and insanely drinkable beer. It is significantly more appealing in the warm weather."
"OMG. I wasnt expecting what I got form this beer, honestly. I used to think New Belgium Hoptober was the best Blonde, but nope. Theres an amazing balance, and I think thats the key here. Light upfront bitterness thats kept in check by a subtly sweet malt. Its all so light, and a perfect summer beer."
"Clear yellow color with a frothy white head. Mild juicy, oily citrus aroma over some fresh grain...simple and pleasant. Increased grainy sweetness comes through in the flavor with some earthiness and a snappy citrus zest finish. Light bodied, well carbonated, very crisp, and damn drinkable. This is nothing outstanding, but it's a perfect refresher for the beach. I personally like a little more cracker/biscuit malt in my Blondes, but this is tasty as-is. This would fit in with a cooler full of hoppy pilsners quite well."
""
"I am shocked. Highly drinkable, with nice balance of bitter and malty with nice hop character. I would buy this again."
""
"O: A nice, simple, and refreshing summer beer that is extremely sessionable. The price is great too, at only $8.49 for a sixer of pounders. I think I've found my new summer beer"
"You should be this. Thanks."
"o - Overall I thought this was a really good light blonde ale. There is some nice citrus hops to it and a lot of wheat and bready malts. Not super flavorful, but a really nice summer beer, and way better then most lighter beer options. Would have it again."
""
""
""
"Poured into a nonic: Gansett Summer presents itself beautifully with a clear, straw gold body and a thick, fluffy white head that hangs out for a while. Aroma is modest, but good, with a distinct citrus component mingling with sweet and grainy notes. Its flavor is modest as well, but well done. It is a 4.2% summer beer after all. There is just a faint hint of the citrus coming thru, but is second to a very crisp, clean, refreshing malt profile, which seems as though there is some wheat in there too, which lightens the whole affair. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy however. I gotta say the lacing on this one is impressive. Overall, a very well done summer blonde: crisp, clean and to the point, although those looking for a more ""robust"" flavored summer beer (oberon, hop sun) may be dissapointed. But for what it is, a clean, lower alcohol summer ale, I enjoyed it, and would probably get it again."
"O- this is going to become my go-to this summer. Tasty, light, refreshing, cheap, and it comes in tallboy cans. Love this"
"Feel is light bodied with light carbonation, just enough to keep the beer from dying at the end. Not bitter, not overly sweet. A simple American blond. I could drink a lot of this stuff at 4.2%"
"O: Probably my favorite summer ale, and my favorite session/can/bbq/beach beer. Fits the bill perfectly. What are you waiting for, grab a 'gansett!"
""
"by far the best summer ale available for the price. after reading the profile on the website, i was very surprised to see the addition of citra hops to the recipe. i look forward to this every summer. recommended."

"An alright blonde ale, just not enough flavor to get too amped up about"
"Thanks to Rubby for passing this on for a try. This summer treat is an anemic gold color with few signs of life but it does produce a voluptuous white crown of foam and gobs of lacing in retreat. The nose picks up a pretty pungent skunky wheat bread with a hint of cider. Hard to say whether this is good or not so good, but I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt...I'm thirsty. The flavor is light but not at all complacent as I get more skunky bread, wheat and sunny citrus hop. Very crisp with a delicate but deliberate carbonation that peppers the palate pretty aggressively. This is clearly a nice choice for sessioning/partying. Light bodied, near watery but held together by the lively feel. Lots of bread and a tasteful hint of bright hops to make this a very serviceable thirst quencher. Take it out on Narragansett Bay the next time you push off from the docks at the East Greenwich Yacht Club, bring some chips and salsa and a few Ghandi Bots for dessert, and all you need is a good friend or two to make it a great evening."
"D: I was pleasantly suprised with this beer. Flavorful and interesting, I could drink these all day. At 4.2 ABV, this is a great summer beer. Perfect while your roasting on the beach or hanging out at a backyard bbq."
"The nose has corn, flora, light citrus. It has a taste that is reminiscient of Honey Bunches of Oats or a similar cereal. Malts also come through, along with some more light citrus. MF leans towards light, a fairly crisp and dry aftertaste. A pretty solid ""summer beer"" that I picked out of my basement, before moving on to some autumn beers soon."
"This beer pours a nice yellow color with a thin white head. The smell is grassy floral and citrus hops with a light background of malt bthe flavor is similar to the smell with a smooth clean finish bthe mouthfeel is light and almost thirt quenching. overall this is an excellent summe beer"
"Thanks to victory4me for sharing this. Pint can into a standard pint glass. Pours golden yellow with a large 3-fingered white head that, even after some time, still was almost a finger's worth. Lacing was thin but present throughout. Nose is sweet with elements of lemon, grain and toasted malt. Taste was lemongrass, sweet malts, and hints of grassy hops. The finish is dry, crisp and light. The mouthfeel was on the light side, as expected, and mildly carbonated. This was a pleasant surprise and, reported inexpensive, would be a go-to summer standby…except we don't get it here (that I am aware of)."
"Overall I have to give this a 4.5 rating it is a very drinkable and a very tasty Summer Ale Just what an Ale like this should be!"
"D: Overall a pretty decent summer session beer. Light bodied, full of flavor, lower on the abv side."
"O: definitely nothing complex. Very drinkable, as it is intended to be. Best summer beer of 2011!"
" To bad i found these late in the season would have been my summer choice."
"Pours a very pale yellow with a slight bright white head. Aroma of sweet citra hops and toasted grains. Great summer flavor begins with a good hit of those delicious citra hops. Grain and cereal malt add great balance and sweetness before a crisp hop finish. Flavor profile is not huge, but perfectly constructed for such a sessionable ale. Not a wussy, fruity, hopless summer beer, but a well crafted, hop and flavor friendly sessionable summer ale"
"The CPJ"
"O - Very good and very drinkable summer brew - this is definitely my pick for the summer."
"O: I'm not normally a fan of summer brews, but 'Gansett made a wonderfully refreshing beer here. Hops are noticeable without smacking you over the head, which most hoppy beers do these days, IMO. Pretty and simple."
"O: Really enjoyed this summer offering from the boys (and girls) at Narragansett. At only 4.2 abv, its extremely sessionable, goes down easy and would be perfect on a hot summer day at the beach. The best of the best for summer beers as far as I'm concerned."
"This is a great summer brew from the guys at Narragansett. There seasonal brews continue to impress me. I've probably bought a case of this so far this summer and there is most likely another six pack on the horizon."
"O: Very nice summer beer that is refreshing, balanced and quite tasty. The only challenge with this beer is that I have not had an opportunity to get any more as demand is strong."
"Cheers!"
"O: It really can't get much better for this style. Recommended!"
"Crystal clear and yellow/gold in colour with a lingering white cap of fine foam. Solid sheets of bubbles coated the top of the glass. Cereal and grainy aroma along with zesty citrus and a hint of pine. Moderate bitterness provided balance for bready malt sweetness. More citrusy hops, cereal grains, slightly metallic and bitter in the finish. Rich, creamy texture, light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation, fairly dry. I really enjoyed this. A solid summer ale."
"O - Hmm, what to say about this. I'm pleasantly surprised and disappointed all at the same time. I had heard from a number of trusted BA's how good this beer is and finally got around to trying it. Well, it is way better than I expected it to be when I first saw this on the shelves earlier this summer, but I had heard what a nice hop profile this has...and I just don't get it. Maybe this has been on the shelves (or actually fridge) of the beer store for a while and the hops have faded some, but it just wasn't as expected. However, this is definitely a better than passable summer thirst quencher. A day of working in the yard, a round of golf, a day on the deck or at the pool - this will work fine. A bargain for $9/6er of 16oz cans, but not enough to it to make it into my regular summer rotation."
"Overall not bad, better than I expected, nice flavors, hints of grassy mild hops, but a bit watery and way too light."
"O- For the style, it doesn't get any better. Highly recommended!"
"Light gold colored beer with a slowly fading head.Aroma is very light frutiness.Taste is dominated by hops and pine needles.Another disgusting over hopped beer that makes it taste like Pine-sol.I would not recommend and will be very lucky to get through this crap."
"The flavor is delicious. I could throw back several of these in a session. Perfectly balanced and teeming with flavor, this is certainly a top notch example of the style. I definitely want more of this. Recommended."
"With so many better summer seasonals available, I wouldn't recommend, but be sure to try for yourself."
"Beer is medium to light in body, moderately carbonated on the palate and good throughout. The finish isn't dry or bitter, just a nice finish with no aftertaste. The lead off is a little sweet, mild malt, intermediate levels of yeast character on the middle and a clean finish. I'd have it again, unoffensive, sort of a perfect circle sort of beer."
"Overall a tasty summer refresher. Simple and quaffable."
"Over the past few months I've been able to drink a lot of fantastic beers from all over the country, but this one might be the MVP of the Summer. It's perfectly priced, extremely refreshing, highly drinkable, and it appeals to both craft and non-craft drinkers."
"D: This really floored me. I've never been a fan of Narragansett's flagship even by AAL standards, but this is a very flavorful, wonderful, refreshing summer beer. The weight of the blue tallboy in hand is a great addition to any summer afternoon."
"Buy it, you won't find anything better for the price."
"Pou yields a bright, clear brew that is golden in color with a thin white head and some very light lacing. Some spots, though not all that much. The nose carries a bit of light grain, though not much of any accompanying sweetness. No real hop presence in the nose or flavor, though a bit of bitterness comes through in the finish. Really plain overall. However, something about the chemistry that I do enjoy. No hops and the malt really brings neither malt flavor nor sweetness. Well made with no real flaws in execution. Kind of bland, but satisfying."
"O: A really nice, flavorful, crisp and balanced pale blonde ale. Near perfect for summer and one of the best blondes I've had. The 4.2% ABV means you can session at your backyard BBQ or beach party all day long."
"O; Goes down easily, extremely tasty, not filling, not much of a kick, and a great representation of style. Hellooo - if the local liquor stores can keep up with the demand, you SHALL be my summer beer."
"This beer far exceeded my expectations. This is a damn fine summer ale and a damn fine beer all around. The distribution of Narragansett is limited, but, if you can get your hands on this, try it now."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger foamy white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slight hop note, with a touch of caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, slightly hoppy. Medium Body. A nice brew, excellent thirst quencher on a hot day."
"It's great to see the Narragansett name out there again!"
"Low ABV, clean and enjoyable flavors, really an excellent beer for the summer season (or any season). Nice can too..."
"I'm glad to see 'Gansett changed it up from the overly bready SA Summer and Oberon. This is a perfect gateway selection for those who are scared of non-yellow beer. I've been enjoying it for about a month, and it certainly holds up to a thorough inspection."
"Rich amber in color, light with a nice head of white on top. Lots of carbonation coming up toward the surface throughout the session, reinforcing an already strong look. Light hops get stronger as it warms up. Nice bit of grain mixing in as well now, nice depth to it I have to admit. Crisp, clean taste and feel here. Really again very well done I have to say. Light finish which was quite dry and I have to admit this was very, very session able. You never can tell what is going to happen when you try a new pale ale, but this was surprisingly very good."
"A big shout out to woodychandler for the hook up. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of hops, some grains. Taste is a good hop/malt balance, some citrus flavor. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a refreshing and enjoyable beer."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing and at only 4.2%, this is pretty light. Overall, I'm really enjoying this and I think the brewers hit the nail on the head with a light refreshing summer beer that has more flavor than your typical summer beer."
"A little bit heavier than I would preffer for the style and the carbonation is very soft. Not a bad light summer beer here. Narragansett again makes a pretty kickin' seasonal."
"O- If this was available in my area, it would be my go-to beer throughout the hot weather season. What an impressive beer that absolutely nails what it set out to do!"
"O: Surprisingly not bad. Old school fifties aura meets modern attempt to appeal to broader, more discerning audiences with mixed results. This is a good beer to get thoughtless with, grab a few, hit the roof deck with friends and just chill with some music. It tries to work in some more complexity than its flagship predecessor, but stumbles as much as it strides, as the light fruitiness and the hops progress, but the discrepancy between that and the sour middle, mediocre aftertaste weigh this beer down."
"Overall: Best thing I have had from 'Gansett and what I would describe as a perfect lawnmower beer. Enough strength and beer taste to quench the thrist and keep on going. Complex enough to make me want the full six."
"Side Note - along with my inexpensive 6-pack of tall-boy cans, I got a free neck tie. It is polyester blue with anchors and the traditional Naragansett ""Hi Neighbor"" Can't imagine actually wearing it, but found it quite amusing"
"The Crack & Glug produced two dense fingers of rocky, bone-white head with decent retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity and an abundance of visible CO2 bubbles. Nose had an interesting lemony citrus scent. Mouthfeel was very full thanks to all of the carbonation. There was a light pine hoppiness along with the lemon citrusiness noted on the nose. Finish was quite dry and refreshing and I realized that I should have been outside on this warm afternoon to drink it, rather than inside at the keyboard. This definitely rates a place in the cooler."
"Flavors of cereal grains, caramel malts with a mini hop snap on the finish. Some light fruit flavors like apple or pear too with a hint of lemon zest. I really like the soft mouthfeel of this beer and high drinkability level."
"Why couldn't they market this as their ""light"" beer? Regardless, a decent example!"
"O - a good summer beer that I'll be drinking a lot of this summer."
"The beer reminded me of craft brewery takes on the cream ale. It started off with a light, somewhat cream bread taste and then a spicy citrus hop finish. It's simple, but a tasty session option."
"Sampled at the B/A Craft Brew Fest on June 3, 2011. The pour is a hazy golden-yellow with a bit of a fizzy white head. Up front on the nose there seems to be a sweetish malt character above anything else with a little hint of citrus zing. The body was a bit better than average in the medium range. The taste was quite sweet at the start but then evolved into a butternut, citrus circus and a slightly dryer finish. Pretty good summer."
"This is the best new beer I've had in a long time and solid proof that Narragansett's rebirth is on solid footing -- it's a hell of a lot more than ""Hi neighbor!"" nostalgia. Proof that you can make a refreshing ""lawnmower"" beer with plenty of character that brings the flavor but, at 4.2 ABV, doesn't knock you on your ass. I'lll be drinking a LOT of this..."
"This is a very easy drinking beer that has a well balanced flavor. Very refreshing and with 4.2% abv you can enjoy a few while camping or at a BBQ."
"Overall one that I am glad to have tried, but don't need to have again. Of 'Gansett's four seasonals this one was my least favorite."
"Wow, it seems like every summer ale is lemon this or wheat that, Narraganset does an English mild/IPA with a perfect balance of macro beer and session ale. This beer would be amazing on cask. Such a unique style, this might actually give the Gansett Bock a run for the money."
"This is much better than most summer ales I've had. 'Gansett summer, for example, makes an embarrassment out of Sam Adams's summer offering. I'm so glad this brewery came back from the dead. They should brew a beer called ""zombie Gansett."""
"The feel of this beer is pretty light. There is a slight push of bitterness but this beer just stays smooth and then is gone down before any real notice."
"D: Drinkability is high and this is a great beer for just sitting on the beach. i found it to be more enjoyable straight from the can then when poured and I am glad that i have a case to tide me over for memorial day weekend"
"O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not filling at all, mild kick, good representation of style, this is an excellent BBQ beer to pound down for a very long time."
"I bought a six pack this year as soon as it appeared on the shelves. In the past year, I have had some remarkably mediocre summer beers and American Blonde Ales. As a result, I am bumping this to a 4.5 overall. It's not a mind-blowing beer, but it is one of the best of this style."
"O - this is quite a nice summer brew and definitely worth picking up for the price. i thought it was going to be a bit better than it was but again not at all disappointed. it must be noted that its an extremely drinkable brew."
"Quaffable summer ale, a solid brew all around."
"Medium bodied with the carbonation on the light side of medium, I'm digging the mouth feel and if I had this around my neck of the woods regularly, I'd drink a heck of a lot of it. Wonderful brew!!"
"16oz. can served in my Sam Smith tulip nonic. Pours a translucent straw gold with a pillowy, 1.5 inch bright white head. Head eventually settles into a 1/8th inch cap with delicate strands of lacing encircling the shoulders. Nose is light and pleasant - wheat, citrus, apricot and a kiss of floral hops. Taste consistent with nose with the floral hops character present in the nose revealing itself at the finish. Really quite flavorful for such a low abv beer. Mouthfeel is light in body with a refreshing, palate cleansing carbonation and a semi-dry finish. This is a fantastic session beer and the 16oz. tallboys make it perfect for summer. I see this as becoming a staple in my fridge over the coming months."
"O - Overall, this is a damn good beer from Narragansett and quite possibly my favorite seasonal of theirs. For the price ($7.99/5 tall boys) you cant even come close to value. Hands down my new summer session beer."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass luckily as the three finger cream colored head was barely contained. The head falls slowly to a half inch blanket. Decent lacing. The brew is golden yellow in color. The nose is some hop tartness, fruit, citrus, a little grain and slight malt sweetness. The taste is very clean and crisp. A nice blend of mild hops and light sweetness. Finishes quite dry with a slight bitterness. The body is light with active carbonation..a touch course. Overall a good summer drinker and a great value to boot!"
"Question: Why is this classified as a Blonde ale on this site when the folks at Narragansett clearly labeled it a Pale Ale? It certainly tastes more like a blonde ale, but if they're going to call it a Pale Ale, I'm going to rate it as such."
"Would I buy more of it? - I would and I will. The price for a six-pack is hard to pass up and summer has just begun. The hottest days are ahead and this beer at 16 oz. a time is the way to go!"
"To be honest my first impression wasn't that great, but as time went on I did come to appreciate this one more. Poured into an 8 oz. tester glass, little head that dissipates quickly; nice light yellow/golden color. Smell is of citrus and those notes come through on the taste a bit. At first it tasted a little flat maybe, or lacking in any strong taste at all, but for a summer-y beer it's actually not too bad. The carbonation was certainly there. Nothing here blows me away though. Overall a crisp and refreshing beer that I could certainly drink a lot of, and isn't this the point of a summer brew?"
"O: Overall a very nice Summer Ale. Pretty excited about it, plan to buy lots more over the summer."
"Finally. Finally a local brew better than Sam Summer! Quite a bit better, by my estimate. This beer is exceptionally refreshing and wouldn't lose character if it warms up on a hot day. Plus...I mean...tallboys!"
"16oz Tall Boy (of course). Pours a translucent golden color with a half inch of frothy head. Lots of lacing. Aroma is of grains, floral hops, a bit of lemon and some cut grass. Taste is a nice crisp bite of hops upfront. Some breadiness along with a slight hint of lemon. Most summer brews have an abusive amount of lemon flavor but this one has only a bit and it works well in this beer. Somewhat sweet at the end. This is an outstanding summer beer. Great balance of taste and drinkability. 'Gansett's newest offerings have yet to disappoint. Overall, I will be drinking my fair share of these beers over the summer."
"O/D- In order for a summer beer to score relatively high on my scale it needs to be light-bodied without sacrificing flavor. It obviously needs to be drinkable as well. I believe that this beer is an excellent summer brew. Unique taste combined with light body. Doesn't hurt that it comes in tallboy cans as well. Might be their best seasonal in my opinion. I will be drinking these all summer."
