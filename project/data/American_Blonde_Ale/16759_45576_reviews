"Poured from a 12 oz can into a pint glass, this creamy ale had significant head. A strong bready smell is detectable instantly. Not as thin-bodied as some ales, this beer is creamy and delicious. I tend to like my beers a little more bitter than this sweet ale, but its a great drinkable beer."

"O:  mostly a creamed corn mush but that lingering bitterness, though very subtle, helps smooth out the big sweetness up front; typical of the style, it's got a lot of American adjunct lager-like taste to it, but there's nothing wrong with it at all.  a beer best suited for the hot months and while not remarkable in any way, I might call for one from time to time out and about."

"Nice malt/hop balance"
"Pours hazy gold with small white head, smells of wheat and bready malts, tastes heavy on yeast and roasty malts, thin smooth mouthfeel. This beer would go well with a game of baseball."

"Overall:  A nice thrust quencher for a hot day.  I know this brew particularly has helped turn many of my friends into craft beer fans.  This is light, crisp and unoffensive."

"O: This beer is easy to drink and is quite flavorful for a blonde ale, making it a good representation of the style."
""
""
""
""
"O: The gateway beer into the Southern Star craft brewery. Its nice. Certainly nothing out of place here. Very balanced. Could be a good choice for the beach or pool."
""
""
""
""
"This is a good brew. The texture is nice and the flavors are pleasant. I am increasingly liking canned beer."
""
""
"Blonde Ales are not usually something I drink but I found I really enjoyed this one. It poured a golden amber with a big frothy white head and plenty of fruity malt in the aroma. For a lighter beer it had a nice full creamy mouthfeel with hints of fruit and apricot that I found appealing. This is not a complex in your face beer, but something that is light and refreshing with enough body to keep it interesting. A great beer for our hot Texas summer days."
""
""
"O - It was served Ice cold, will try it again on a hot day."
""
""
"D: all-in-all not too shabby. eliminate the haze and the oxidation and you have a solid drinkable blond from this Texas brewery."

"O: no reason to recommend this beer."
"Good taste when you drink it but the aftertaste is not to my preference. The fact that it comes in a can is not optimal, I think that bottle would help the way this beer is drank."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O overall i feel this beer is great for someone who is not familiar with craft beer and is transitioning from adjunct lagers to the craft world. I feel I could use more malt to balance the back ends excitement."
"Can  Appearance: Clear golden yellow with bubbly white head  Aroma: Fairly muted yeast  Taste: Toasted bread  Palate: Cleansing palate, light body, minimal, clean aftertaste  Overall: Very drinkable, while still having good character. Good, clean, drinkable beer."

"Poured from a pint can into a pint glass, non canned date. This pours a near clear light yellow color with a large off white head which has goo retention and leaves a lacing. The smells are of light grassy hops and crisp malts, something closer to a pilsener. The feel is medium to light. The taste is okay, pretty light with a little malts and hops, disappointing."

"fizzy on the tongue, creamy on the palate, light body and pretty refreshing. for a beer style that's so plain (blonde ale) this is pretty excellent. great tasting and perfect for the summer!"
""
""
"LOVE THIS STUFF."
""
""
""
""
"I've had it served on draft at many bars and they routinely don't get the temperature correct and it just doesn't taste right to me."
""
"Drinks eay, a slightly off-centered Blonde IMO, but more interesting than most of this style"

"Pours hazy gold with a massive, fluffy biege head. The head dissipates slowly, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. The head retains very well. The smell is pretty mild, but I can detect some breadiness as well as some citrus. The taste is bready with some strong citrus flavor. There is some bitterness on the back end. The body is light to medium. The beer is refreshing and easy to drink. Overall, this is a good beer. This would be great for drinking on a hot summer day."

"Pours a lightly hazy yellow to orange-ish color with a white head. In the aroma, a small dry malt and a note of dry hops. In the taste, a small pine like hop and a dry malt. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry pine hop in the aftertaste. A bigger hop than expected, but just ok, kind of average."
"3.5 D: Fairly tame, but tasty and easy to drink."

"The Bombshell Blonde Ale from Southern Start is ok. The beer pours a nice clear golden color with bubbly white head that is leaving a spotty lace. The smell is underwhelming, some faint lemon/lemon grass zest. The taste is very sharp, starts with a lemon flare then turns to a grainy/bread finish. The mouthfeel is light to medium with good carbonation. Overall it is a decent beer."

"kind of thick and chewy, but drinkable. I would continue with the farmhouse comparisons (man, I'm getting all nostalgic over here for childhood summers playing with hay bails). I'm not generally a big fan of blondes (at least not when it comes to beer...), but I really like this brew. I'd love it on a lazy summer afternoon. The fact that it is in cans also makes it that much more accessible to bring camping/hiking or to the beach or to a hayfield somewhere for a midsummer picnic. Grab a sixer if you see one and like the summer months. Well crafted and immensely enjoyable."
"Hazy golden orange/blonde colour, one finger of white head with some lacing on the glass. Smell is mostly bready malt, crisp hops, earthy with some cut grass notes, grainy and crackery as well. Taste follows the nose with grainy bready malt, mild bitterness throughout, grassy, light lemony flavours, earthy finish with a long malt driven aftertaste. Medium carbonation, dry and medium bodied with a nice overall feel. Nice easy drinker here, good balance and tasty as well, could drink a few of these in the backyard on a summer day."

"A cloudy dark golden beer with a fluffy white head. Smells and tastes bready and rich. Very creamy body, smooth, buttery. Totally not filtered. Best ""all-purpose"" beer made in Texas. Very little hops added, but comes off as distinctively balanced."
""
"Overall: This is one hell of a refreshing beer, and Southern Star have achieved it without sacrificing flavor. This is a great beer to drink, and it is very complex. There is no other Blonde ale that I drink the way I drink this one, it is in another league."

"Food Pairing- I had this with pizza and it was a great combination."

"A large, 4-finger white, bubbly head develops with good retention. A hazy yellow and straw colored body is accentuated by an endless stream of bubbles emanating from the bottom of the glass. The aroma is of wheat, straw, hops, lemon, orange, a slight funk, a bit of spice, and a bread/biscuit finish. It tastes of bread, straw, lemon, orange, some hops, and a bit of funky yeast. Mouthfeel is very smooth, and crisp on the finish. Overall, a delicious, refreshing brew."
"Itâ€™s a well-crafted golden ale, a light beer for the craft set."
"I like this beer even though there isn't much going on...some floral hop and biscuit notes. It's one of the better blondes I've had."
"D/O - Drinkability is low. Great look, promising smell, but the taste and mouthfeel stick the nails in the coffin. A pleasure to admire from far, but not the best beer to actually imbibe."
"Overall this is a great Blonde. Very well balanced and the citrus flavor makes it a great summer sipper.."
"O- This is a great session beer and a perfect beer to take to the beach or fishing. Keep up the good work Southern Star."
"Overall this is a solid offering, especially since it comes in a sometimes more friendly can format, as long as I don't have to smell it much. It still doesn't close to unseating Sun King for my go to lighter ale."
"Solid beer, but not quite what I was expecting for a Blonde; is a bit more malty than I was expecting."
"This beer is extremely easy to down, leaves a very nice aftertaste and is nice and smooth."
"Good job Southern Star."
"This is a solid summer beer. I would have liked it to have more hops to balance the flavor."
"A different take on a Blonde ale that works very well. This is my second offering from Southern Star and so far I am diggin their brews. One of the great Texas craft brews that I should have discovered a while ago."
"O- i really enjoy beers in cans, and im glad the craft beer movement is heading that way. the more camping/beach options i have, the better. i can see my cooler containing this next time i head for an outdoor adventure."
"Thanks again to the legendary woodychandler for yet another canned beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. This beer exploded out of the can and finally setteled down to have a cloudy golden color with about 2 inches of head. Smell is malty, biscuts, slightly sweet. Taste is also malty and biscuts, some honey, a bit of sweetness to it. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a quality beer."
"O: Great beer from southern star. Since it comes in a can I can see myself quaffing alot of these by the pool."
"Overall-This is kind of a hybrid between a Hefeweizen and a Blonde Ale. Love the fact that it's canned, and a 7.99 six pack is great for a summer beer."
"Yet another quality beer from Southern Star. Pours golden with a 1/2 inch pillow of white head that fades rather quickly to a thin layer. Smell is of sweet maltiness and a hint of hops but just a hint. The taste is just like the smell, sweet and citrusy and balanced extremely well. The carbonation is perfect giving this beer a creamy texture. Truly a great session beer."
"O - As drinkable as it gets. Balanced taste, pleasing mouth feel, moderate ABV. A damn good session beer. Worthy of multiple purchases."
"O: great beer wish I had a yard to mow and a full case of these to drink. Just what was needed after finishing work."
"I love blond beer and that makes that i am giving this good brew a high rating. A very soft and tasty beer."
"D: Definitely a session beer! This one is perfect for hot summer days. Not too heavy for a day at the lake and flavorful enough to still be good at a party that night."
"Overall usually not a big fan of the blonde ales but this one knocked my socks off, big fan of this brew"
"Overall, seems more like a light pale ale than a blonde, but on a warm night, this would go down easily, again and again"
"EDIT: After having another can I believe this may be better classified as a Kolsch, big lemony esters. In any case, very refreshing, nice summertime quencher."
"Pours a pale hazy orange with a bit of white head... Smells floral and a but hoppy. Tastes smooth and sweet with a nice kick of malts on the backbone. Vry drinkable and pretty tasty all things considered. Not something i would seek out but above average"
"I didn't know what to expect from a Texas Blonde ale, but this one pours a slightly hazed honey golden hue with a bright white head. Aroma is pretty mellow layers of grassy herbal hops and sweet honey drizzled bread notes. Flavors more grassy herbal hops lending a slight bitterness with a nice honey dipped breadiness full all grain malts going on. No rough offness just a clean drinkable golden ale. Satisfying maltiness and even carbonation with a light to medium body straight from the can into my favorite mug. Overall experience so far with these Texan canned beers have been nothing but positive, if you see them grab some especially fresh pale ale or any form of the Buried Hatchet Stout."
"This blonde does it all without doing too much or trying to hard. Very refreshing and has a lot of depth to it. I cant wait to put a six pack in my cooler and go play a round of golf or go to the lake. Its a home run of a blonde for sure"
"Pours hazy yellow with a full white head. Smells like a slightly soured belgian ale. Taste is like lemon-rind and tea brewed bready malts. Just a hint of that soured nose. Really odd. Mouthfeel is big carbonation and a medium body. Overall, this beer is alright. Something seems off."
"Not the quintessential blondie, but damn drinkable."
"The carbonation level seems alright; along with the beer's medium body, the mouthfeel is Bombshell Blonde's most appealing characteristic. Ultimately, though, I find this to be a boring, bland example of the blonde ale style. When people say that they don't usually like blonde ales, it's because of snooze-fests like this offering."
"O: All in all, this is a solid brew. Not much going on in the scent but a very easy and natural taste. Great to try if you like session brews and have access."
"Well-balanced hop and malt flavor is very drinkable. One of the best blonde ales I've had in quite a while."
"D - Pretty good brew. Very easy to drink a few of these during a sitting, nice spring summer time brew. I would have this brew again and would recommend it"
"D- I really enjoyed this beer alot. VEry drinkable and very cheap. Will be picking this up to throw in my disc golf bag to drink on the course. Give this one a try if you havent"
"I can only say good things about this beer as it has served me so well after many tastings! I have had many cans of this delightful brew from Southern Star brewing out of Conroe, TX. Pours a hazy yellow/orange, smells deliciously sweet and drinks the same. Drinkability is extremely high as I could have one of these daily! Light on the hops and malts are balanced very well with the sweetness of this brew. Truly a delight!"
"I just gave it a 3.0 in appearance given that I had it out of a can. I don't really know what separates a beer from having an ""awful"" appearance versus an ""exceptional"" appearance. You know, unless there were little bits of meat floating around in it or something. I suppose that would be pretty awful."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied, but the carbonation is really nice. Pretty smooth going down. This is a really well-done blonde ale, and very drinkable. It has just enough flavor to make it sessionable and give you a desire to have several."
"I enjoyed this beer more than expected. not ususally a lighter beer person but this one worked for me. very light and refreshing. Great summer beer."
"It's like a German hefeweizen mixed with a light pale ale. A good beer here!"
"Definitely worth a Tick or a Trade -- Hattip to Crusian for the cans! : )"
"Picked up a can at Whole Foods. Clean but a bit boring. Just very subtle pale malt and a hint of herbal hops. This is a very light tasting ale, though the body isn't too thin. It's a fine lawnmower beer, probably a good beer for a party with mixed beer appreciation, but I wouldn't buy it for myself."
"D- It is a good beer for a hot day, there is little complexity. I really liked the small amount of hop spice, I just really wish there was a lot more."
"Partly refreshing, but then much too sweet with a constant butterscotch note (not diacetyl though) which grows very tiresome (although my girlfriend enjoyed it much more than me so YMMV)."
"Impression: A mostly forgettable beer that I would not recommend unless offered as a freebie."
"This is a solid blonde, the best part about it is the smell, I found it more flavorful than most blondes as well."
"It's too bad the beer didn't match up to the buxom blonde on the can. The best things about this beer were the appearance (it didn't look like an adjunct lager) and the mouthfeel, which was thicker than I expected. But let's be honest, who buys a beer for these two charactistics alone? The taste factor dropped off for me because it had a strange lingering aftertaste that I couldn't put my finger on. Not repulsive, just weird. It didn't make me anticipate the next sip though. If you have no hair on your chest and this is a favorite style of yours, then give it a try. However, this brewery has much better offerings like the Pale Ale and Pro-Am. Not something I would seek again unless they attempted an imperial version."
"D - well this is very drinkable. tastes pretty good, pleasant, and not heavy."
"D: Very much so."
"My full review is here: http://whatareyoudrinking.net/2011/01/this-tin-woman-has-heart-bombshell-blonde-ale/"
"I would definitely buy this again."
"This was good and had just about everything I like in an American Blonde Ale. A moderately assertive bitterness, fruity hop flavors, a silky sweet malt backing, and a refreshing and crisp drinkibility. I pulled this cold out of the box and immediately poured it and had it with dinner. This is the type of beer I love to see being put in cans."
"For all its carbonation, this beer is a very smooth drink. Medium-bodied and almost creamy, it was not what I expected from its appearance. Drinkability is good, but I would find it moreso if it was just a bit lighter."
"Pours a nice blonde color (duh) with a small head that leaves some good lace. The aroma is lots of melon fruitiness and a nice breadiness with some yeasty notes. The flavor is honey with some white grape and baguette plenty of fruity citrus notes and some mild hoppiness. Just delicious."
"wow, this beer really surprised me>>>im not really big on blonde ales>>except belgian blondes>>>the smell straight out of the can reminded me of a nati light>>>>i wasn't really expecting much>>>but that first taste was awesome>>>i really like it>>>>you can def. taste the sweet malts>>>the hop presence is not there as expected>>>def. drinkable>>def. worth checking out>>>>a texan beer that is actually pretty decent"
"D: I'm not usually one for blonde ales, but this was quite nice. Easy to drink and fairly complex."
"This is not a bad tasting beer by any means, it's just on the unimpressive side. Even still, it's light, smooth, and refreshing, and for someone looking for a beer they can suck down a few of on a lazy afternoon, this is honestly a solid choice."
"D: Good beer with a few flaws that limit my score (and desire for more) a little. Unclear when this beer was birthed, so it's debatable where this can is in terms of its freshness (case in point: friend returned with it from Texas mid-summer...but it's been fridge-bound ever since). My hunch is, though, that it's still pretty fresh...it's just among the middle of the pack for those I've tried of the style. I could return to this...or not. Though, since this is my second of two cans, I guess I DID return to it! Thanks, Bill!"
"Slight carbonation with no alcohol flavors present. All around a very sessionable beer, would pair very well with a light lunch. No strong flavors to overpower any food offerings."
"Southern Star Bombshell Blonde should be renamed Pop Gun Blonde. Even that, though, implies more power and personality than this rail thin brew delivers. Each and every one of you, no matter where you live, should be able to find better beer than this."
"D - Very drinkable, could easily session on a hot day outside"
"but hey, the label is way cool."
"i have 4 left and will pawn them off on neighbors to see if somethings amiss."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are both top-notch. Smooth, silken texture that sticks around just long enough to show off a pleasantly sweet aftertaste."
"This is an American Golden Ale - sure a ""Blonde Ale"" - but it leans towards a lesser hoppy Pale Ale, Cream Ale, and Wit. Unique and definitely worth trying. And revisiting."
"RJT"
"beer is medium to light in body and has a nice bitterness to ti. There is an aftertaste that is slightly grainy overall. Its moderately carbonated and has some sweetness up front. Its kind of corny at the back. Overall its OK."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. had my first tending the grill on a Texas August (i.e. quite warm) day. This definitely could be a session beer."
"These are just over $5 for a 6er at my local specs. My uncle who swears by coors light drank a can and said it was good. That says something for a man who's never had anything other than coors his whole life."
"a pleasant surprise of a brew with a nice bellowing head of ivory and a body of cloudy gold. this beer has sediment and you can drink it clear or cloudy... there is a lot of esters in the cloudiness... but the yeastiness does get a bit overboard. smell of zucchini bread and very delicate pineapple fruit. palate is not as exciting. fruit is subdued by yeastiness and the bitter is finish has a straw must to it. not bad. the infiltered aspect is a saving grace for the ester and gentle body... a bit too gentle at times."
"Light body with plenty of carbonation. Not the most amazing beer ever, but this is a solid canned craft option."
"Probably will not have this one again thou..."
"D - This is a very easy drinking beer that is refreshing. If there were more balance in taste I think it would definitely add to it's drinkability."
"This beer is way too dark to be a blonde. More of a light amber. Toasty, sweet hazelnut, and honey in the nose. Similar taste, very much like a bizzare amber. The dry, toasty, hazelnut finish lingers long after you swallow. Very unexpected flavors in this beer. Pretty nice."
"this is one of the better blondes ive had. its full flavored but it doesnt end up syrupy."
"Nothing stands out as particularly good or memorable. It's just ok. After this 6 pack, I'm done with this one."
"The sweet and grainy malt is foremost in the flavor here. A slight hop bitterness, but mostly a gentle noble-hop like spiciness. Quite pleasant overall--the flavors are subdued and understated, but they work together quite well. Medium-light bodied, with a prickly and grainy mouthfeel. Drinkability is excellent, and I think quite well suited for a hot summer day."
"d - great session beer."
"D: The taste is good and the beer is light and refreshing with low carbonation. Makes this beer good and drinkable."
"Overall very tasty. A little odd for the style but I like that it has character."
"Meh, I'm not in love with this one. It's decent, but odd. I'm not sure what kind of occasion I'd want to drink this on. It's not crisp or refreshing enough (it's not refreshing at all) to be a go to summer beer in my opinion, and that's the one place I could see it fitting. It doesn't, though. A puzzling little beer. I don't think I'd come back to it."
"D- It does give some semblance of drinkability, if a straight forward, malt heavy, non-balanced beer is your style. For me, I tried it. If I were offered it again, I would respectfully decline it."
"A nice enough beer for uncritical drinking on a warm day. Can't think of too many other situations where I would be interested in drinking a beer like this."
"Drinkability: If you are looking for an in-your-face, over the top beer...this isn't it. If you are looking for a simple, very drinkable brew to enjoy and relax with, here it is. This is the kind of beer you can just sit down and drink without having to think about or analyze. Enjoy it for what it is...I sure am."
"Pours a cloudy pale golden color with a huge, rocky white head. Aromas of bready malt, light caramel and a hint of hops. On the palate, a nice mix of sweet malt and hops make this one quite drinkable. Nicely carbonation leads to a clean mouthfeel which creates a good, refreshing beer. Nothing out of the ordinary, just a good, simple canned beer."
"There's plenty of drinkability to this one, though if it was stronger I'd be more inclined to it. All round a tasty brew, though."
"Overall, not too bad coming from a can, certainly drinkable and creamy, if a bit unbalanced in the finish"
"D: I could kill a case of cans on the river."
"D: Well balanced, nicely blended, decent representation of style, goes down very easy and definitely one to sit with for a while."
"Poured into an imperial pint, formed a 1 1/4"" beige head above the cloudy amber brew. Dense bubbly head recedes slowly, with prevalent chunky lacing. Aroma is sweet, with a fruity bubble-gum tinge to it. Taste mirrors the nose mostly, but near the close hits an earthy hoppiness that I could have done without. Mouthfeel is smooth but kind of thin, and drinkability is okay as well."
"D - This would make a nice summer session beer for sure. Lots of flavor for what it is, and it goes down easy. Taste might suffer a bit, but there are times when this would really hit the spot. Another beer I wish we had here in MN!"
"D&Notes: This is actually a good brew, but odd as it may sound, may just be a bit too rich and flavorful for what somebody expects for the style. It really doesn't taste much like a blonde ale, as in a blind taste test, I would say one could easily take it for a light vienna lager or amber ale. That being said, with a semi-complex flavor, moderate ABV, and the fact that it's canned, this is a great anytime, anywhere session beer for a beer geek."
"I cracked this beer after an indoor soccer game cause I wanted something mild. This would make a nice summer session beer. I would probably pick up some of this if it were available to me because it would be acceptable to my non-craft beer drinking friends. Glad I got to try it."
"Glad I had the opportunity to try this."
"The refreshing light body and low ABV make this a good quaffer for the spring or summer. It is not very complex and the aforementioned strange bitter flavor keeps this one from a higher rating. Still well worth trying."
"Dark, honey blonde with a massive rocky merengue like head of cream colored foam that lasts for days. Honeysuckle, pale malt and a touch of floral hops in the nose. Plenty of pale and Vienna malt flavors with a touch of honey and decent hop bittering in the finish. Creamy bodied with mild carbonation. A nice beer but not one I would go out of my way for."
"D: While it does have some nice flavor going on, the mouthfeel is pretty much enough to say goodnight for me. I'd drink this before a Budweiser, but not much else."
"The blond on the can convinced me to drink this after having sat in my fridge for a week or two. There is a wonderful dense head on this beer as it clings to the glass on the way down. As the can states, ""Clarity is overrated."" A hazy, dull yellow colored beer. The nose is primarily yeast character with just a bit of malty aroma. Orange slice smell as well. More bitter than I expected for a blond, but balanced in its sweetness. The floral hops blend well, too. Creamy mouth that ends semi-dry. Altogether, it makes for a very drinkable, delicious blond ale!"
"Quite a drinkable beer actually. I liked it and I am not traditionally a big fan of the ""blonde"" category of beer."
"Where this beer actually shines is in its mildness. Lager smooth and completely inoffensive with a big grain flavor, very easy on the taste buds."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, the Vienna malt added a nice flavor to it that I enjoyed. It's definitely different then any other American Blonde that I have had before, but it was pretty good."
"I was very pleased with this beer. It had a nice amount of flavor, and would make a great session beer."
"Light to medium body with decent carbonation. Light and refreshing, fairly easy to drink but maybe a little bland. I would probably get bored of this after a couple."
"D-Pretty easy drinking as most bloneds tend to be. This one has very full flavor though which I've really not experienced with this style before."
"Lots of foam and lacing after he pour from this headdy brew. A wheat beer like haze of amber, copper, and sediment. Very attractive looking beer. Toasted bready malts, some pilsner malts give a grainy smell and taste to this brew. While the yeast seems to impart an aroma ofdried apricots and light berries. The yeast seems to vamp up the berry flavors when you take a sip of seems to be exacerbated, but in a good way. The palate is a little powdery, but definetly grainy and full of character. This has turned out to be my favorite blonde I've had so far. I recommend anyone trying this beer."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer. I was surprised with this one. I am starting to remember that just because it comes in a can doesn't mean it will be bad. Would recommend to anyone who wants to either try the style or come back to a good beer in the style."
"Pours a cloudy pale golden color with a monstrous creamy white head that shows much resilience. Fruity bready aromas waft in front of my nose with some bitter citrus as a supporting player. Taste is creamy rich and malty with lots of fruit citrus and honey. Rich creamy velvety mouthfeel, medium level of carbonation, light to medium body. I am very impressed with this one. Very light and flavorful. I could see downing many of these if I still lived in Houston."
"Very drinkable, very smooth. I will have to drink more blondes because I just might like this style."
"Golden colored, quite cloudy and hazy, making slightly opaque. head is thick and frothy and sticks down the sides. smell is a bit fruity. mostly pear and apple. little hop aroma. taste follows the smell, with hints of pear. hints of a bready finish. definately a nice malt background on it. a slight bitterness closes out the finish. drinkability is incredibly high on this one."
"Pours a golden orange with a nice, one-finger white head. The beer is slightly hazy. The aroma is wheat, lemon, malt and some honey. The flavor is very nice, with some citrus and honey and biscuit malt. I also get a little caramel characteristic in the flavor. The mouthfeel is medium and very creamy. Medium carbonation. A great blonde ale and it is nice to see a brewery actually try and pack flavor into a beer of this style, instead of just brewing a watered-down beer, calling it a blonde ale and targeting BMC drinkers."
"The beer is well carbonated, has a light sharp mouthfeel and crisp finish. It takes all the desirable traits of an american macro (light, easy to drink, crisp mouthfeel) and adds a bit of body, depth and a very nice balanced flavor. This is something I would definitely like to see in New England, especially during the summer months."
"Would I buy more of it? - sure, if I lived down in Texas I could see myself drinking a few of these from time to time."
"Pours a very nice cloudy yellow color, nice carbonation, HUGE three-finger foamy head, which settles down to some very nice sticky lacing. The nose is malty, slight yeast note, citrus. The taste is sweet, malty, nice little touch of yeast, also some nice citrus notes. Light/Medium body. Drinkable, a very nice easy drinker."
"Opinion: I might be jaded as this brewery is just minutes from my house, so I am getting the beer as fresh as it can be. This is a session beer, and I think that it is a very good example of the style. I like the complexity to the malt on the palate and the fact that the hops are noticeable, but play a supporting role in the finish. All this combines into what I would call one of the best examples of this style. I would definitely recommend it!"
"D-Southern Star does it again. A very nicely done, sessionable American Blonde. Plenty of flavour, light and easy to drink. This one would stand up nicely at a Texas BBQ on a hot, dry summer day deep in the heart of..."
"I liked this beer, refreshing, not much of an aftertaste, citrusy and clean. Can is retro and all so way to go with that if you like that stuff, pick some up."
"D= Is out of sight. Could drink this all day and not get bored, which is rare for most texas blondes."
"Pours a hazy straw color with a very ambitious head that leaves a nice lacing behind. Aroma is slightly sweet, corn, honey and wheat notes. Taste is predominantly sweet, the result of bread, wheat and corn flavors. No bitterness whatsoever in this beer. Features an extremely short finish with no aftertaste at all."
"Pours a pleasant apricot color with a thick white head that leaves some lacing. There are lots of little floaters suspended in it, and there are striations of color toward the top, with a distinct pale, cloudy band just below the head. It's not a pristine appearance, but a very interesting one. The smell is mild but pleasant, with notes of stone fruit, biscuit, tangy yeast, and minerals. The taste is again nothing too assertive, but is quite delicious: apricot, wheat bread, chewy yeast, some faint piny notes in the finish. It's a little like some Belgian pale ales -- reminds me a little of Taras Boulba. It's highly carbonated, which is perfect for its rather thick body. It's too complex and meaty for a lawnmower beer, but I could see putting away a good few of these in a sitting. Glad I found this on my visit to Victoria, TX -- too bad it's not in every store in town."
"D - I could definitely keep drinking this. It's kind of like a bmc on steroids; ya know, with actual flavor. Good brew."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a good mild beer with a lot of flavor and substance to make it one that you can pound down several of throughout an evening."
"I love this beer, and it's one that beeradvocate has the right idea about. Many times, I think that the BA reviewers are blind to the charms of beers with a milder flavor, but apparently this one bridges the gap. Positively delightful, and an incredible bargain to boot."
"D- Pretty easy to drink. Could see this being a great summer time session brew. I'm not normally a fan of the style but this is alot more like a hefe than any blonde I've had."
"Upon cracking open the CAN, head began to foam up, as though it could not wait to escape. Pretty dang full CAN as it turns out. My aggressive pour resulted in a foamy, soapy two fingers of ecru head with good retention. The color was a really cloudy, extra-hazy honey-golden shade. Nose was an interesting mix of grassy hops and biscuity/bready malt. Mouthfeel was somewhat full, almost creamy with that same grassy/bready admixture of flavors on the tongue that I noted on the nose. Wild! The finish gave way to the bready/biscuity flavor which was just fine. Man, I really liked this beer and could definitely see it filling my cooler in the summer."
"The beer is a bit bigger than the crisper versions of Blondes that appeal to me. The extra sweetness and fruitiness proves to much in the end. Thanks Exiled!"
"Drinkability: Not a beer I would have sought out had I not heard the review on Craft Beer Radio; not sure this qualifies as a blonde ale, I think it is a very creative take to define a new style"
"D: Picnic, beach, yard work, funerals; this beer is great anywhere and should be consumed by the sixer. Feel free to channel your inner-John Belushi."
"Decent enough beer. Once you get beyond her looks, there's not much to her."
"Goes down real easy."
"D- I like it. An easy drinker. Doesn't make you think. A def summer beer."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer has a light body. It never dips into the thin bodied notes. The carbonation is active and totally appropriate to this beer. This is a beer that I could session with and never be bored. Well played!"
"Dark cloudy burnished gold. The head is creamy white and leaves very nice lacing. Smells of hops, strawberries, and a subtle pine note. So far WAY up there on the canned beer scale. Taste is freakin awesome. Nice, nice balance of malt and hops, again, delicate hops and a faint strawberry taste. A sharp finish, not too assertive. Very very, very very nice. Mouthfeel is soft and a touch undercarbonated. Drinkability is very good. An afternoon in the making, for sure."
"M/D: This beer is a huge surprise. I was expecting something like Fireman's #4 which is a simple & drinkable ale, but this beer is way more complex tasting. The mouthfeel is the very definition of 'creamy' and begs for more sips."
"A fake blonde, but still a lot of fun. :)"
"Pretty good overall and easily a session beer. The low abv and abundance of flavor make this a cool session brew. Glad I got to try it."
"Not usually a fan of blonde ales but I'd say this is one of the better ones I've had."
"Not bad. The beer has an interesting honey malt sweetness and a good hop flavor and aroma. However, there is a bit of fusel alcohol in this one which is sort of a turn off in a beer this light."
"Cloudy, darker than a blond but lighter than an amber. It appears golden with a tinge of red. It produces a very small head, but it's dense enough to produce a nice lace. There's no noticeable carbonation. I get faint hints of cherry in the aroma. Nice balance between the malt, hops, and alcohol. A thicker mouthfeel than you would expect, a bit on the chewy side. Finish is also well balanced, with both sweet and bitter notes."
"Overall I would definitely go here again. This was a superb offering for a hot summer day. Highly recommend."
"Nicely carbonated and creamy, very smooth and easy to drink. A nice beer for a hot day, and you can easily put down many of these."
"This is an incredibly drinkable blonde ale. It's perfect on a hot day."
"Another craft brew in a can - always a welcome sight. This is a nice session brew here. Its easy drinking and perfect for the hot summer months. Keep up the good work Southern Star."
"Hazy golden pour. White rocky head that fades into a thin lace. Smells of sweet pale malt. Faintly lemony, some floral smelling hops as well. Very inviting. Tastes of sweet malt tempered by a fair amount of bitter hops. Slightly bready, maybe even a little caramel. Grassy, floral hops make the beer fairly complex for the style. Medium amount of carbonation. The beer packs in a lot of flavor that you wouldn't expect from the style. Drinks very easy."
"D- Damn speedy drinking and canned for easy delivery."
"Poured from the can a hazy orange color, making the ""Clarity is overrated"" claim from the can spot-on. More lasting head than I've ever seen from a blond ale, and it even leaves some lacing. Smell is particularly malty and bold for the style, almost like a brown ale; sweet, caramely, and delicious. Taste is loaded with malty, bready goodness, and I taste a bit of apricot and orange fruit in the finish. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, also unique in a blond, and leaves my mouth a bit sticky. In comparison to other blonds I've had, Bombshell is imperial-like in appearance, smell, taste, and mouthfeel, but at 5% ABV, drinkability is excellent. Such a great beer at a very low price... and in cans!"
"D: As this style of beer goes, this is a drinkable example. Solidly made and easy to drink."
"D: Definitely a session beer! This one is perfect for hot summer days. Not too heavy for a day at the lake and flavorful enough to still be good at a party that night."
" Tastes exactly like it smells, like a cross between a Vienna and an American blonde with a big, biscuity yeast finish. Hops pervade all throughout, and all around it's a damn good balance between sweet grain and bitter hops."
"A fine brew here in this blonde ale. Well-crafted and unique. Easily drinkable at 5% ABV. I will happily return to this blond Bombshell."
"D) Yep, keep them coming. I can see this being a staple canned beer setting beer; lake, pool, sun, yum. Really nice work, very clean and flavorful. Blonde beer done right."
"12oz can. Pours a hazy golden copper with a substantial off-white head that lasts and leaves nice lacing. Smells of sweet, light, honeyed malt and a hint of floral hops. The taste is mostly sweet, pale malt with a nice bready quality. Light hop bitterness. Refreshing. Medium body with low-ish carbonation. Nice blonde."
"Overall, only the words ""thoroughly enjoyable"" could summarize this beer. Nothing too much to criticize."
"Notes - I wasn't impressed with the appearance and smell, but the taste changed my mind. That's what's most important anyway, I guess. A great beer for converting the BMC heathens, or for when you're just thirsty."
"Drinkability- Not my favorite style, but I'll be damned if I couldn't drink a lot of this on a hot day, or even right now sitting in a 68 degree house. It doesn't taste or smell as good as a kickass IPA or RIS, but that shouldn't be what it's held up against. It's a blonde ale, and I can't think of another beer of the same style that I'd rather have. Great job Southern Star."
"Overall this is a great offering from Texas, anyone who enjoys Blondes should like this. I know it is slowly being distributed to other states, if you can not get this, drop me a line maybe we can trade!"
"D: Very drinkable, I will be seeking this beer out again."
"Overall, a good beer that I mildly recommend if you can easily find it (especially if in a buddy's fridge). For me, it doesn't have enough flavor to warrant buying many unless on tap and limited choices or a friend has it."
"Poured into a pint glass pale straw yellow with a nice thick white head. Lacing all the way down the glass. Smell is very fruity, suprisingly strong. Taste is very malty, with hints of various fruit flavors. The hop bite at the end leaves a slight dry feel, which is the only downer. This is going to be a great Texas Summer beer."
"Verdict: Perfect for sessioning, Bombshell is just a mild and friendly beer. Every brewery has to have an offering or two in their lineup that appeals to the fans of ""lighter"" beers, luckily this one has soul and flavors in abundance. A perfect companion for a hot Summer day here in Texas."
"This Blonde might not be a bombshell, but I'd definitely penetrate her aluminum lining and session her with rock hard resolve. A very solid beer."
"Taste is very unique and tasty. It has plenty of husky, grainy maltiness and a noticeable hop presence. Sweet toffee and caramel flavors are followed up by a mild bitter finish. The mouthfeel is full and creamy with no lack of flavor power. This blows away all other blonde ales I have had, which to me is a fairly weak style to begin with. I've already gone through 2 sixers and will be buying many more as it will make a fantastic summer beer. Love it."
"One of the better blonde ales I've had, though it's not a style I seek out. The bready maltiness makes it a step above most grainy offerings."
"I am taking some of these to my BMC friends to see what they think. Show them there is other beer out there."
"D: pretty good and i love the lable art"
"Pours a hazy light copper colour with a minimal head that doesn't subside too much. The first thing I though when I stuck my nose into the glass was 'Dang it, I forgot to make bread today!'. There's an overwhelming smell of bread dough with some floral undertones and a malty sweetness. The taste is... not challenging. By that, I mean it's good but fairly middle of the road. Not too sweet, not too hoppy, not too bitter, and with a medium body. This style of beer (when brewed by a craft brewer) is almost craft beer with training wheels, and is hopefully a stepping stone for the macro beer drinker to develop a more discerning palate. For someone who drinks something like Arrogant Bastard or Sierra Nevada Torpedo, this beer will be as easy to drink as a glass of water, but for someone who wants to try something other than Budmilloors, it's a great first step into beer advocacy."
"Flavor starts off with some biscuity sweetness from the pale malts that combines with nutty notes along the way. Hops are fairly muted, but distinctively floral and saved for the back of the palate where they add a slight bitterness to the finish. Mouthfeel is solid, with a great carbonation level, medium-thin body, and a smooth (somewhat dry) finish that both refreshes and leaves me wanting another sip. This Blonde Bombshell did her job well; keep up the good work Southern Star!"
"Overall, a very nice beer. I wish it had a little better mouthfeel."
"Pours a golden yellow colored amber body, with a frothy white head, good lacing, somewhat diminishing. Somewhat fruity aroma, some pale hoppiness. No very strong. Hoppy dryish taste. Tasty light taste. Creamy-like."
"I had this at the Oktoberfest party. This and Real Ale are the two standards for the style IMO. Easy to drink, a good flavor, and not too heavy. Hard to beat on a hot day, or anytime."
"D - This is a session beer all the way generally not a style that gets me excited but I could drink this all day while watching sports worth trying"
