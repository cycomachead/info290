There is a decent amount of earthy, organic flavors. It finishes with a lingering, grassy grain flavor. Interesting and yet quite simple.","Lemke10","Nov 30, 2014"

3.67,0.5,3.25,3,4,4,3.75,"This one was on the discount table, no date. Pours a cloudy bright yellow with an off-white, slightly tan, foamy head. The head sticks around, 1/2 an inch, for the duration. The lacing is OK - little, dry spots of popped bubbles, like sea foam on the beach. The smell is fairly one-dimensional - nothing objectionable, nothing out-of-this-world: sour grain, some citrus/vinegar. It's a clean-tasting, dry beer. If this weren't the coldest night in November in Alabama but rather, oh, JULY, then this would be an amazingly refreshing ale. Sharp, metallic hoppiness, grapefruit rind, basil, lavender. This one doesn't leave you parched, and the carbonation's just about right. There's a bit of density to it that is welcome, as it's not watery or thin. A good go at it.","kaufmaal","Oct 06, 2013"

There is tons of good lacing to the glass. The nose is nice and simple and revolves around some fresh bread, light yeast smell, and very lemony hop smell to the nose. The taste is a nice flow from the nose. There is good sweet malt up front with an oily lemon zing to it. The malt and the hops play nicely together. The mouthfeel was a little thin, but finished nice and dry overall. I think this a good beer, something I am doing in my own homebrews. I think the only detriment comes from the haziness on the appearance and the thin mouthfeel. It was a good beer and a good concept.","estlinska","Mar 15, 2013"

No head, thanks to the gentle pour. Nose smelled oddly familiar - it was the characteristic Rogue hop strain, underlain by the malty sweetness. Wow! I have noticed this in their beers before (a certain commonality), but to have it appear in a home-grown form is just impressive. It had a very bready, toasty malt flavor initially on the tongue, but also an earthy, grassy (Saaz?) hops flavor underneath. Finish was very dry, just the way I prefer my beers.

Malty did come through a bit as well. Taste was a sharp hop, not bitter. Different than I normally expect for something classified as a blonde. Felt good in the mouth.

4.01,9.9,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Trying a new one from an oldie but goodie, Rogue. I like the concept - malt and hops grown by Rogue, beer brewed by Rogue. Nice sturdy looking beer, blonde, slightly hazed, thick rocky head. Not a lot of character to the aroma, but clean, crisp, and grainy. Mmm... much more going on here than the nose suggested. Yes, pretty basic, but really bright flavors here. Nice crispy malt, light dry hop. Nice fresh grain and hay flavors. Light and lively on the palate, smooth, highly refreshing and schwillable. The best quality of this beer is it's simplicity. Could be easily summed up in three words; crisp, clean, fresh.","twelvsies","Jun 01, 2010"
3.68,0.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Golden amber with a sustained white head. Fresh grains and grassy hops aroma. The taste is balanced but predictable. Malt flavors are smooth and grainy, some pine is present. A well cared for beer, I'd peg it for more of an amber ale. It should be in a six pack at a lesser doller per ounce ratio.","brownbeer","May 31, 2010"
3.88,6.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"D: An all around beer guy beer. You have to give Rogue props for producing their own barley, malt & hops while at the same time offering a beer that is familiar, yet distinctive. Not quite as nice as the Dirtoir, but with four ingredients, locally sourced, you can't find many that are better.","melliott2811","May 29, 2010"

4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"A pretty tasty and drinkable blonde ale, one way more enjoyable than the anemic standard for the style, and propped up with the malt and hop characteristics of, well nearly a properly rendered Czech Pilsener, of all things. Well, revolutions often have a side-effect of recalibrating expectations, and Rogue has provided at least a glimpse of that here.","biboergosum","May 29, 2010"

4.1,12.3,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,5,"both the aroma and taste are very clean and awfully reminiscent of a lager. i know this is technically an ale, but i'm not sure that i'd be able to pick it out a kolsch/pils lineup. you get that pilsner-like bite at the end but otherwise it's very balanced. although abv is unknown, i'd be shocked if it was north of 5.5%, so it's exceedingly quaffable. i can't get over how carbonated it is - my glass nearly overflowed on every pour throughout the bottle - so that makes it a good choice on a hot day. i'm not sure that ""single malt"" does for beer what it does for scotch, but this one's a winner.","coachdonovan","May 18, 2010"
4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Opened up a bottle today and poured it into a pint glass. The beer was orange in color and a bit hazy. The head was substantial and there was a bit of lacing on the glass. Took in a deep smell of this ale and the smell of caramel and hops were detected immediately. Soon after, the lingering smell of malts became apparent. I took my first sip of this ale and could immediately taste the caramel and hops. Then it balanced it self of well with the malts. Quite honestly, it was very tasty. The drinkability of this ale was very smooth. This ale surprised me as I was not expecting much. I will definitely pick up another bottle when I get the chance!","Kala1073","May 17, 2010"
3.92,7.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This is a blonde ale? Could have fooled me, it's so hop forward. In a pint glass the beer was a hazy orange color with a small white head and a little bit of lace. Very citrus aroma, a little malt. Big time grapefruit taste, some malt that was hidden by the hops. Not very balanced, not like any blonde I have had, but still a nice beer.","lordofthewiens","May 17, 2010"

3.32,-9,5,3,3,4,3.5,"OVERALL: My first estate beer was from Sierra, and maybe I was spoiled, but given that this one was from the Great Northwest I was slightly disappointed. That said, I was looking for something more bold, hoppy and rich. That prejudice may have led me to not quite fully appreciate the fact that as a nice, crisp and refreshing summer beer the Chatoe Rogue would be absolutely ideal.","StoneTSR","May 14, 2010"
3.3,-9.6,4,4,3,3,3,"I like the idea of this beer and I'm glad I tried it because I've often thought of growing barley and am growing hops right now in my backyard.

3.52,-3.6,3,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Picked up this bottle at Hy-Vee on Grand in Des Moines. Pour a hazy blonde with a very loose head. The aroma is citrusy and piney with some honey and good fruitiness.

3.08,-15.6,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"D: Not a bad beer, but it just doesn't have alot to it. It's just boring, so to speak. Of all of the beers Rogue had produced over the years, I've liked most of them. I have to say I'm a bit dissappointed.","WYVYRN527","May 02, 2010"
2.98,-18.4,3.5,3,3,3.5,2.5,"Drinkability: I'm just not into Rogue's first foray into the chateau-beer world. This beer is awfully rough around the edges, and my guess would be that this is due to the hops. I just don't think this variety is well-suited to a single-variety beer.","flagmantho","Apr 30, 2010"
3.73,2.2,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Drinkability: I'll admit, it's a cute concept. Decently drinkable and not quite as simplistic and one-dimensional as I'd first anticipated. Let's see where they go with this whole ""GYO"" idea.","ChainGangGuy","Apr 30, 2010"
3.63,-0.5,3.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,"Pours a toasted grain color with a fairly tight off white head that settles inot a light cap. The aroma is quite faint there is a very light bready malt scent, thats about it. The taste is of a light malt with some fruity notes and a subtle grassy bitter hop bite. The feel is moderate with very fizzy carbonation, lightly sweet on the palate and finishes slightly bitter. A nice easy drinking brew. Good balance between the sweet malt and grassy hops. The flavor won't blow you away but you can easily pack away a few of these.","Gmann","Apr 29, 2010"

3.92,7.4,3,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Rogue First Growth Single Malt Ale is cloudy, bright, golden and very lively, with a foamy, white head that has outstanding retention. Oh, outstanding lacing and sip lines, too. It has a bright, fruity aroma that's recognizable as Rogue. There are notes of lemon and tropical fruit. It has a super smooth medium-light body with a crisp, clean finish. There's a nice, resiny bitterness and hop flavor that veers toward pineapple and mango. The malt pretty much stays out of the way and isn't really sweet or dry. It's really yummy. This is a spot-on American Pale Ale. I had this after working all day in the yard in 90-degree weather. Talk about quenching and refreshing!","yesyouam","Apr 07, 2010"
