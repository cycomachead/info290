"Not much different than Pabst."
"Had at Logan, where the options are always disappointing, and this did not disappoint in its disappointment.  This has all the characteristics of a macro - so in that regards, if sales take off, they are ready.  It has little smell or taste.  I gave it a strong score for Look, as I am wearing my favorite sweater today, and I think the beer looks good next to me.  Overall, this is very much a beer, so good work Shipyard."
"This beer doesn't not taste at all how I remember it. It's been seven years, so I guess time may have warped my memory. It seems to be skunked, but I bought it at my go to store which is reputable and has fresh product. Either I remember a bad beer as good, or it got skunked along the way."
"Drinkable, with a pleasant woody finish. However, it has a weak hop profile and tastes kind of like wort rinse..."
""
"Taste a lot like Budweiser, if Budweiser had a much more beer flavor to it instead of a watered down taste. I like it, but prefer Prelude from Shipyard. A pretty good beer."
""
"I did not like this beer.  Funk on the nose, no head to speak of, little body and an odd taste - bitter and foul.  Mouthfeel was OK.  Would not revisit."
"Overall:  Nice beer, with some good malty and sweet flavors.  I’d certainly drink it again if offered."

"Standard ale with not much going for or against it. A little watery though, and the flavors aren't too pronounced. Drinkable and smooth, but not that great."

"Just a small step above mass produced beers. Will not buy again"
"Overall (3.52) : Aroma is the strong suit here. Downright impressive. The taste leaves a little to be desired for me personally, but I could see someone being absolutely crazy about this beer. It has a great profile and is pretty complex. I like how the malt and hop wrestle each other for dominance. As stated, the hop actually wins the battle by the end of the taste. It is a good beer and I'm sure it's great on tap. Give it a whirl."

"American Blond Ale? Who added this beer? This one is obviously an English Ale, quite sweet & malty, and only slightly bitter. Not exactly a hop-head's favorite style, but a reasonable approximation of the style. Not great, but not bad."

"This is one beer that goes great at a cookout, at a casual dinner or a quiet night out. Very easy to drink, and reminds you of New England. Another good local offering for me."

"Pours a very nice clean/clear dark golden yellow/orange color, nice carbonation, with a nice little fizzy white head, which leaves some sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, kinda yeasty, and sweet. The taste is malty, yeasty, with some grapefruit notes. Medium body. Overall not too bad, a nice thirst quencher."

"DATE REVIEWED: June 29, 2014... GLASSWARE: Barley Creek pint... OCCASION: prepping for P90X3--starting tomorrow...APPEARANCE: quickly dismissed off-white head; body is translucent copper with subtle, sparse effervescence... AROMA: caramel malts join with softer hops to produce a relatively pleasant promise... PALATE: sessionably sippable; slightly buttery; little or no aftertaste... TASTE: buttery caramel malts, front and center; a bit of blood iron, metallic hops; some fruity esters are involved--not so much complex as a base mixture of beer's usual elements ... OVERALLL: described as an American blond by Beer Advocate, I though this played more as an ESB--refreshing like a Kolsch, but more publike in its demeanor and flavor profile--not quite solid enough to demand seconds but not offensive..."
"The Export is my go to beer when the only other options is Miller and Budweiser; perfectly drinkable beer that you could have one too many of. I always like to support local and Shipyard produces a lot of other good beers. It has better taste and presence on the pallet than a macro, but does no favors either."

"Only the second Shipyard I've had, and probably the better of the two. I was impressed with it's appearance - a very nice dark amber color, almost honey-like. The odor was a weird mix of malty sweetness with you regular beer smell. I wasn't entirely sure I liked it, but it was altogether that bad. Mouthfeel was just a bit better than okay. I was very impressed with the taste - a nice roasty, sweet, malt and hops flavor that was crisp going down. Overall, a decent beer. I'm glad I still have plenty to go through."

"Overall: Solid session beer. Easy and approachable but with enough flavor complexity that it isn't immediately forgettable. It doesn't really stand out as something I need a cooler full of, but I'd certainly have it again. Strikes me as a good beer for a hot day."

"The Crack! was nice and loud, the CAN brimful, and the Glug inverted. I have gotten quite practiced at doing this and I CAN intuit when to back off of the pour so as to avoid overflow. The resulting two fingers of dense, tawny head evinced good retention and produced some nice lacing as it fell. Color was a deep, golden-yellow (SRM = > 7, < 9) with just the slightest hint of a haze. My old friends, Croesus, Mammon and Midas came by for a taste but as usual, they proved incapable of sharing, so I went ahead with my business. Nose had a clover honey-like sweetness and when I closed my eyes, I swore that I was smelling lager! Mouthfeel was kind of full, thick and viscous and while the taste was very much like honey, it was cloyingly sweet. Ugh! I am not a big fan of sweet, especially in beer, hence my being a self-avowed hophead. The finish remained ungodly sweet and I was not enamored of it. There was nothing intrinsically wrong with this beer and it was stylistically correct, but it just was not my cuppa tea. YMMV."

"Pours a lush, golden brown. Upon pouring, aroma begins to be noticeable, which is a heavily malted scent. This I believe is Shipyards best work. Their IPAs usually miss the mark, but they're American style beers, are on point. Very drinkable, great color, not to heavy, not to light. This is a versatile beer. Whether its 9 degrees on a Maine night or a July 4th weekend, this beer is good to go anytime of year. Arguably it's best attribute is the aftertaste, which is sweet and malty and makes you want another round. Good stuff here by Shipyard, Cheers"

"O - Don't recommend. Not much better than an AAL, and would in fact drink many AAL's over this, as I've has several that are actually better tasting, and even ones that are similar in taste quality would be much cheaper. This is supposed to be a decent beer, but it just tasted off. Cheap sourness is the best way to describe it. Maybe the lines were dirty at the bar, who knows. Still though, I won't purchase this again."

"o: Perhaps some proof that enjoyment is all in the presentation and the environmental conditions. Did not particularly appreciate the first one I had, but this one rocks. Very satisfying. That it only cost me a dollar warms my Scottish soul even as the beer cools my physical innards."

"Pours pale and hazy. Light straw with a head of white foam that fell fast to some decent lace. Nose is floral, apple and lots of pale malt. Very low key. Bread, dough and caramel. Opens up with grass and earth. Citrus in back. Taste is grainy malt like it wants to be an amber with apples on top. Not really balanced. Plenty of cracker and bread. Diacetyl. A touch of hop bitter and oil on the tongue at the end and a small bite from the carbonation. Body is thin and not heavy. Doesn’t finish well because it finishes sweet and the diacetyl leaves bitter. It’s just ok."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is certainly good summer fare, being light and crisp, but largely suffering from a lack of sugars to help counter the heavy grain flavors."
""
"Pretty dull. Nothing technically wrong - it seems well crafted but boring. Like a US version of John Smiths. Looks good, but the aroma and flavour don't hold your interest. Decent body though rather too dry. With so many great beers out there, this isn't really worth the trouble. Give it a miss."

"Pours a hazy light orange with a foamy light tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy broken rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with some grassy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp but somewhat medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with a pretty good smell but the taste doesn't match up in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"Not a terrible beer, but not a great beer by any stretch. Pale and sweet. Easy to drink with low impacts. I guess I can see the appeal."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is sweet and mellow. It's very drinkable, but it's not particularly interesting. Also, it's not an American Blonde. Sorry."

"Overall: This beer has great flavors of malt in the finish and, to a lesser extent, some delicate floral hops at the end. The malt gives it a great “beer” smell and it is satisfying to swig. The carbonation makes it sessionable and it has a fullness that domestics lack, without being overbearing like a DIPA or a stout. I would def order this as a pitcher at the bar."

"O - A good ale"
"(This was all half jokingly.)"

"Noon after work beer, won't fill you up, but will offer a nice relaxing buzz at 5%."
""
"This beer pours a clear gold color with 1/8 inch head and thin, lasting lace. The aroma is of citrus with cake and hay. The flavor is lemony with bread and piney notes. There's a mild but long lasting hoppy bitter aftertaste that follows a light mouthfeel. Shipyard Export Ale is a good beer, recommended."

""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"O: Good drinker that goes down easy. Good for a few."
""
""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a orange yellow, with a half inch of white head that leaves a ring of lace. Smell is clove, ginger, biscuit, and some orange. Taste is all of those things with clove and ring wood yeast the most dominant flavors. Body is medium, plenty of life, a little dry in the finish, and easy drinking. This is a o.k beer, not something I would seek out."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good brew, not my first choice though."
""
"I can't believe I haven't tried this beer before now - being from Maine and all. But it is really good - just the right balance of hops and malt - I can taste the cascade hops that must be in there. If you haven't tried this in a while - try it again - it is really good. I am a home brewer and this is the taste that I have been trying to get in my homebrew. I will always have some in the fridge from now on"
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light, crisp, smooth and almost watery, with a very light feel and very light carbonation and a finish that's almost dry. Highly drinkability, but the flavor is just average and it's kind of boring."
""
"This is a weird beer. It's a little unbalanced. The hop character isn't smooth and over powers what little malt comes through. This is probably a one and done for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Ov: Very simple while not seeming thin. Refreshing and is worthy of drinking 2 or 3. Almost tingly like a champagne. The aftertaste can turn away many but it grew on me. I can drink several of these and would probably ask for more. Cheers!"
"O - A very good session beer. Tastes great, looks great, goes down easy, and has a reasonable ABV, so you can slam a few back and still go about your daily routine. Great example of a blonde ale, will definitely drink again."
"A safe, light ale that would be okay to session, not alot to write home about however."

"Tasting the beer , the flavors appear accordingly. Nice mouthfeel finishes the tasting. Very drinkable light lager,with medium carbonation, just like it was meant to be for this style."
""
"Tried the Shipyard Export Ale whilst in Orlando at the Ale House. The beer poured a clear golden pale color with virtually no head and no lace. The smell was mostly grain with slight lemony/citrus hop. The taste was very clean with cereal base and lemon hints. Mouthfeel was light in body and so so carbonation. Overall wasn't bad, good for a warmer winter night in FLA."

"O: The best of a bad lot from this mixed 6 pack. Shipyard should ensure less stock put out there, as this likely was an old 12 (it included the summer ale) and they had a bunch of them stacked in the main section where it was room temperature for a long while... This is the type of ""craft"" beer that people would buy and not like due to age."
""
""
""
"Overall a prety good beer. Would recommend. Nice malt flavor"
""
""
""
""
""
"The pour is a golden color with some nice white lacing down the glass and a decent head, although a bit soapy. Scents are a bit off, may have been the date of the beer. Not quite sure what an ""American blonde ale is""...but to me, this is a cross between some type of a pilsner and possibly an APA. It is quite easy to drink, fairly smooth except a bit ""tingly"" on the back end and quite a bit yeasty. A decent beer for sure, just not a top grade micro-brewed beer but good in it's own right."

"Why am I drinking this? Oh yeah, it was free. Avoid this beer, unless you like drinking popcorn."
""
"O - Somewhat disappointing and just average overall."
"Dulled gold in color with small cap of off-white head, little lacing at the top of the glass. Scent is pale but buttery and light caramel notes with little bits of herbal hopiness. Taste follows suit, a bit bolder than any blonde i have, very English in its construction. Medium bodied, lightly creamy. A decent, drinkable beer without much character."
"O: This beer just doesn't work; I don't know what it's supposed to be but it just doesn't work as it is; something is off; I'm glad I just bought one as I don't think I will ever come back to this beer"
"Overall: Nice drinkable beer with a pretty mild, standard taste. Nothing crazy here. Not bad, just not impressive either."
"O - Not much flavor, but is very drinkable being a very generic ale."
"O: A bit below average falvorwise in my book, kind of disorganized, coarse with an overall flavor that really doesn’t bind and flow well together, comes off as a mess. Cannot see a repurchase in the future."
"Pours a translucent gold with a 1 finger head. Aroma mostly grainy and malty, hint of grass, butterscotch and a slight funk. Malt forward, cereal and a little yeasty, hints of caramel and somewhat buttery in the finish. Has a slickness to it from the buttery flavor, light body, finishes a bit off to me."
"Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this is a drinkable yet filling beer. The body is rather light considering the flavors. The carbonation is a little fizzy but does not detract from the flavors one bit."
"overall: a step above average across the board, attributes are a bit more developed than a typical blonde, makes for a nice casual ale."
"This beer is surprisingly smooth, though not lacking crispness. The body is on the lighter side of medium. It is a little bit slick, other than which makes for a very good mouthfeel."
"O- Standard session brew that won't blow you away, but is still satisfying and good-tasting."
"Really great Malt Balance. I just had to comment due to my previous perception of this beer. I was really pleased with it."
"O- A really tasty sessionable ale. Can't beat it in the summer heat."
"O - Smooth drinking if unremarkable otherwise. Highly session-able when eating summer food."
"This is pretty damn easy to drink. Havent had this one in over a year since a road trip up to Maine. Not as good as I remembered but still very enjoyable. Would like to see this more often."
"O: No big flavor profiles, but well balanced, and easy drinking. a solid effort all around."
"O - An average blonde, nothing overwhelmingly impressive, but if youre in the mood for this style its a good one to try."
"O - Never again on my pallet"
"The pour has a half finger head. The color is clear with an golden color and touch of amber. Aromas are of barley. Taste is smooth with a very mild hop finish. Sweet apple malt is appreciated. Mild to moderate carbonation. The beer is average in taste. It is a ""safe"" brew without overwhelming nor underwhelming qualities."
"Overall, better than what my first impression would have had me believe upon the initial pour. Nothing great, but worth trying."
"The taste was very well balanced. It wasn't bitter or sweet, but I could taste lots of malt character and hop character nonetheless. The taste was heavier on the hop character than I'd like. It was oddly lacking in bitterness considering that it still managed to taste like grass. I've mentioned in many reviews that I don't like my beer to taste like grass. However, other than that it was great. I loved the balance and I loved that the flavours were not masked by bitterness from the hops or from burnt malt, nor was any of the flavour masked by sweetness. Aside from the grassy flavour, it was a fantastic beer."
"O: standard ABA, sometimes come back to depending upon what else is served"
"The pour was about what I would have expected given the style. Light golden in color with a medium level of haze and cloudiness to it that obscured a bit of the sunlight poking through. Nice head of white capped the top and settled down smoothly and evenly, creating a decent broken crown that ringed the side of the glass and kept some nice lacing. Aroma was light, and this would be a trend throughout the day. Light notes of peach and light grain are really all that is coming through right now. Warming brought a smidge of citrus to it, but nothing really standing out here for me at all. Crisp, clean flavor though with light hints of clove and heather that sat on top of a base that resembled mostly light fruits and hints of grain. Smooth, light body was not overly carbonated but rather a bit silky and left just the right amount of dryness on the tongue as it worked itself through."
"A deep golden color with about a two finger head that sits around for a while. The nose has sweet pale malt and a lot of peppery floral hops. The body is light tangy/sweet biscuit. Hops are light as well over the malt but still very earthy but more fruit flavors are pronounced a lot of peach and bitter, sourness. Finishes dry and tangy light fruit. It's a little hoppy for a Blonde."
"Medium bodied. The flavor is light fruits, pear, white grape. Followed by a bit of floral hops, sweet bread, a dry finish and a raw grain aftertaste. Very enjoyable and worth having another."
"O - Ok. Its certainly not a bad beer but its lacks depth to be a truly good one. Very average."
"Pretty solid, better than I recall from a few years back. Either it's better or I'm less a snob. Either way, I'm happy it's around again."
"Drinkability - This is a pretty solid brew. Reminds me of a German Pilsner. Easy drinking and sessionable. Very nice for Spring and Summer. Nothing complicated, no frills. Well crafted."
"Drinkability- Pretty good but not great"
"D- Good drinkability. This is a very easy drinking beer. Nothing to interesting."
"Notes: Not a bad beer and interesting style which is a plus. I am happy I picked up this one a good style for a warm day as well. Cheers."
"Notes: Another safe offering from Shipyard. Sure to be a crowd-pleaser. A better alternative to the ubiquitous macro lagers, but nothing special otherwise. I didn't mind drinking it, but I wouldn't give it a second look."
"O- Not likely to buy this again, there are other beers of this style I prefer."
"pleasantly surprised with this, I'll be picking up a six pack of this next time."
"Aroma is malty and crisp, more like a lager than an ale but still all right. It pours a clear, bubbly amber with a rather thick and fluffy off-white head. Flavor is crisp and malty with a fruity undertone, mainly apple and banana, and a hint of hoppy bitterness. Texture is fairly smooth and edgy, leaving behind a nice tingle. This is a good party beer, or an accompaniment for a hearty meal."
"One of those ""the best available option"" beers among boring beer lists."
"Overall this is a beer with some easily fixable flaws. The fermentation schedule or temperature is most likely to blame here. Most likely both put together trying to move the beer as fast as they could. I think i would like to try this again but maybe at the brewery or at a pub who just changed the keg."
"Drinkability: Not that great. Reminds me of Red Stripe and would probably be just as good on a hot summer day on a beach."
"Poured a translucent amber brown with yellow highlights with a very thin head and almost no lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was malty, sweet, various grain notes, very slight peach, and citrus. The taste was also dominated by the malts alongside citrusy, mild peach, and various grain accents. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, mild fruity, malty, and grainy finish. It drank really good and was a decent blonde beer."
"Overall: From what I know, this one isn't widely available in my immediate area, but I certainly am not going to lose sleep over that fact. Good for a conversation piece, maybe a beer to kill the monotony between beers, and it's a good drink, but not something I'd spring for unless the options were more limited."
"Mouthfeel is light with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"The tastes matches the smell with a grain taste to the finish starts with a buttery smooth and as the carbonation builds this taste slowly fades and becomes a dryer mouth with a pale malt taste lingering"
"Drinkability: It's a smooth, sufficiently tasty, albeit kinda buttery blonde. Which is exactly what I was expecting from Shipyard."
"Cheers"
"Verdict: Not good, but very drinkable, unique and cheap."
"D - It's good, I'm glad it came in the mix-pack I got. I wouldn't buy a six-pack of just this, though."
"This ale is something different but nothing to rave about. It pours a golden yellow color with not to much of a scent. It's a fairly lighty drinking beer for being an ale. It does have a slight bitter and spice taste to it. Something new to try but probably not going to be anyones new favorite."
"DB- Not much to say but nothing bad to say either. I would say this one pretty much splits right down the middle. A simple ale with a decent flavor set, would probably be good for someone new to the craft."
"This is pretty good for a blonde. Highly drinkable for most."
"D -- Very good drinkability with a nice balance between hop and malt. Many can go down in a sitting and not overwhelm or distract. My first recent taste of this brew brought back good memories of micro sampling many years ago -- I'm glad to find out Shipyard is going strong."
"Its a clean ale, a bit thin, but a great lawnmower, or gateway creaft beer for the bmc crowd. Not a bad beer overall though."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and is quite sessionable."
"Dr. A easy to drink, mild, good flavored beer. A little too sweet to have more than one or two."
"One of the first craft beers I have had. Decided to review it recently after having one on tap to relive the beginning. Not as great as I remember but still, worth a shot."
"Meh. Its like an inferior version of sierra Nevada pale ale."
"Pours a clean yellow color, with a white head. In the aroma, gingerbread maltiness. In the taste, well, like buttery gingerbread. A small bite and small to medium bodied mouthfeel, and a semi dry maltiness in the aftertaste. Very English, kind of feel like part of the Sam Smith line, but not as good."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is rather mild, some hops. Taste is a balance of hops and malts, a bit on the light side. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good beer."
"Pretty well rounded beer. Not bad!"
"Highly drinkable; good everyday beer."
"Easy drinking beer that's more interesting than the average blonde ale."
"Taste, a nice initial grasp of carbonation and light hops, light caramel, very light. It recedes though, not into something good, it just goes away and becomes watery. Just not a fan of this, could get comparable stuff for cheaper."
"D: There are better, more well-rounded and smoother light ales out there, but Shipyard's Export isn't all that bad. It's very clean and looks good for the style, even pretty quenching and might pair with grilled chicken or a summer salad. However, there is a milled graininess and boring flavor that bump the drinkability down a couple notches."
"I think this would be a good summer beer (lawn-mower). I will check with the store the mixed 6-pack came from to see how much a 6 pack of Export costs. It might be a good summer drinker when most people would go for a BMC. Having said that if ti costs the same as most micros, I probably go with something with more flavor."
"Drinkability, I think if this style was something you enjoyed you could drink a sixer over a couple hours no problem."
"Not much to it."
"D: Very drinkable on both hot and cold days. I had this beer almost every day in Portland, Maine during the winter. Tasty, not too flavourful but does the job."
"Just bland, boring, and ho hum. Something I will probably bring to a Memorial Day BBQ this weekend. Not really bad, just uninteresting."
"Pours a golden honey color with a thin white head. Nose has dry malts and grainy hops. About aberage in the flavor department as well. Grassy malts and some stale hops. The body is light, but clean. Possibly the best aspect of the beer. Not bad, but nothing too special either."
"D = This is a really easy drinking and enjoyable beer."
"Picked this up on a whim, i've always seen this on the shelves but somehow, they just don't stand out, and after drinking it, I know why. Nothing really to want you to come back, way too tangy, to the point that it overwhelms the malts and you get a wierd tang from start to finish. It would be drinkable on a hot day, but what isn't. I think at one time these guys were handled by miller, and I think that is maybe where the taste went."
"This is a quite drinkable, fairly well balanced beer. I could see drinking a few of these at one sitting. It would go great at a BBQ or with a burger. Something for a warm summer day."
"Pretty good. Would be easy to session. There really isn't anything to dislike about it but it doesn't bring any game changing traits to the table either. Good in all ways, but great in none."
"Serving type: 12 ounce bottle."
"Feel was pretty bubbly, the medium body was pretty slick. I wouldn't choose to drink any of these in the future, the flavor just didn't agree with me."
"D: Goes down easy enough but nothing special."
"Overall, an average American pale ale. Not really much else to say."
"Poured a nice pale color with some carbonation that lingers. Nose is pretty weak, fruity with malt detectable. Taste is somewhat bitter with more of alcohol taste and not too much of other flavors detectable. Overall, an interesting take on a pale ale but nothing that impresses me much."
"Taste is a bit sharp and bitter quite carbonated. Something is a bit odd with this beer though, I had it with a couple others and we all thought it was a pretty poor beer, not easy to drink and didn't sit well with any of us, skip it."
"Value: I'll tell ya I paid $6.00 for a sixer of this. You couldn't do much better for a buck a beer."
"Poured a clear, almost translucent golden body with a big foamy head on top of a faint aromatic body of mild hops and malts. A little too sharp for my liking, a mild (even bland) ale that doesn't pack much in the hops or malts department and just comes across as a tad overly hopped with a dry, cutting backbite. Has a little punch to it compared to macros but not my favorite ale at all."
"This is a light-bodied beer. It never really coats the tongue, and the relatively high degree of carbonation keeps it crisp and refreshing. Between the solid balance of flavors and aroma, clean mouthfeel, and modest ABV, I could easily see myself having several across a prolonged session."
"This is an under appreciated beer. I'm well above the curve on this one."
"Drinkability : you could session this if you wanted, but it isn't anything I'd recommend."
"I wonder if the taps condition at the local establishment did not affect this pour/beer since I can not imagine many folks enjoy this beer in this condition. Poured a dark gold with no head or lacing but just a small collar that stayed with the beeer throughout. Beer was almost totally flat. Smell was not much of a presence either with very light notes of toasted malt and yeast. No fruit or sweetness in the smell which aligned closely with the taste of this beer. Not much in the line of flavor or mouthfeel with little no no carbonation. Not a beer I will be trying again."
"If you drink this one cold you will not be able to appreciate the beer. It really comes together once you allow it to settle and cool."
"12oz bottle, no best by/bottled on date, purchased at RSVP in Portland, ME on 10/30/09 consumed on 11/1/09. Poured into a shaker pint. Nice white, tight, two finger head over a golden body with good carbonation, head dies down to leave a nice thick veil. The nose is...lacking, some bready malt, nothing too distinct, no hop presence that I can detect. The taste is of some sweet malt, a little piney hops, buttery/diacetyl, decent bitter finish. Medium/light bodied, a little creamy, maybe a little over carbonated. I am remembering why I don't ever pick this up, just a very uniteresting brew."
"Th feel of this beer is a nice crisp easy drinking beer. It's pretty light with some really good carbonation."
"Not a bad taste. Malt sweet, some straw and biscuit. Didn't have that zing at all. A bit boring, but could be good on a warmer day. Easy drinking."
"I would not go so far as to say this is the worst beer I've ever had, that title is reserved for Natty Ice, but it ranks close. The Export tastes like vinegar mixed with Becks. After my first sip I immediately asked the bartender if the keg had gotten skunked or if the lines hadn't been cleaned since new years. He assured me that this was how the beer was supposed to taste and so I, not being one to waste beer, choked it down. Somewhere amidst the sickly sour taste and urea-yellow coloring I found a redeeming quality to this monstrosity; it goes great with pretzels. Something about the salty tang of a pretzel counterbalances the overly dry feel and bitter morningbreath taste of the Export ale. It will be a while before I try one of these again."
"Overall, a mess and not very good. Put it in a different category and maybe it would jump a little but this fails as an APA for me. Can't recommend. Rotation: avail here but one and done for me."
"This is a good straightforward ale. Light golden yellow color, a little fizzy but nothing a little harder pour into the glass didn't take care of. Lighter flavor but has a nice balance for whats there. Nice little hop background that comes through the nose.It's drinkable also."
"mouthfeel is ok and drinkability is pretty solid."
"whoa. taste is rich (no indication in the appearance)...the butteriness continues with an assertive malty backbone/punch in the face, but tempered in tag fashion by the hops...not overly complex but rather intriguing as an APA. not a clone of anything! the buttery mouthfeel really makes it all work. quite drinkable. a session APA for sure. at least for me."
"D: By the time this beer was warming near the middle or so, it was starting to taste almost as malty as it was hoppy. Weird. Either way, it would be easy to drink a couple of these, but there's many better APAs out there."
"341 ml bottle- Pours a deep rusty gold with a frothy white cap. Nose of sugary grains and fruity malts, some white bread crust and grassy hops. Tastes of slightly biter hops and sweet grains, and some sweet malts. There's a hint of vanilla and rye too. Finishes sweet, with a slightly metallic and bitter finish. Ok. Thanks mom!"
"D. Overall, a clean, not so hoppy beer that does neither disappoint, nor stick out."
"Off the tap at the brewery this beer was a light amber color with no head to speak of. The off-white skim did not retain well and the lacing was also thin and scattered. The aroma was of sweet malt, pale malt and a little caramel malt. The flavors were light and crisp, dry graininess, hoppy bitterness and a drab, macro-like finish. Though I would describe it as a session beer the finish really took a lot away from this beverage. The mouthfeel was a little watery, the body light and the carbonation medium."
"Have enjoyed this beer since a trip to Portland."
"D: A great APA if you enjoy Ringwood, merely good otherwise but plenty sessionable."
"D - pretty easy to drink at first. Dryness is a large part of it."
"Pours a clear, light amber color with a thick med of small to medium sized white bubbles. There is lots of visible carbonation rising in the glass. Some hops in the aroma, along with malt and grain. The Export tastes buttery, with some hop bitterness. It finishes dry, but due to the butteriness, the beer leaves a good amount of coating in your mouth that lingers well after you've swallowed. If you weren't partial to this feeling, you'd want a sip of water after each sip of beer. The amount of carbonation also borders on the upper end. All in all, there are some good things and bad things about Shipyard Export. It's a beer you can find almost everywhere in my area, so if I don't see something I like, I can always order one. It still carries a premium price though, so usually I can find something a little more interesting for the same cost."
"M/D - The beer had a light texture, but far too much 'zing' from the carbonation for my tastes."
"D - Easily drinkable but not very interesting. Average at best."
"Pours slightly hazy golden with off-white head. Nose is rather weak with some buttery grain elements and faint citrus. Palate is more citrusy-sharp, though still thin bodied, and has that buttery flavor coming through again. Finish is short and has more buttery flavors."
"On tap at Max and Dylan's near Park Street. Served in a standard pint glass. Yellow color, well carbonated, no lacing. Watery appearance. Smell was a tad musty. Taste was pretty average. For a pale ale, it was more malty than hoppy. Also, I did not prefer the slightly sticky mouthfeel. While I did not find the taste overly appealing, it was a fairly easy beer to drink due to its blandness. This was more of a beer to order and drink, instead of ordering to enjoy. Washed my appetizers down, so it served its purpose."
"This beer is very straight to the point, no bells or whistles. Great for knocking back a few with friends on a cold evening."
"good carbonation and mouthfeel. very sessionable."
"This beer pours a nice golden color with a decent white head. There is not a very hoppy aroma which is typical of American Pale Ales. The taste is well balanced, but seems to be more like an English Pale Ale than an American Pale Ale. I don't taste the usual citrusy hops found in APAs (Cascade, Centennial, Amarillo, etc). Not a bad beer overall--quite drinkable actually, but I don't think it compares with the west coast APAs."
"I enjoyed this ale."
"Feel and Drinkability: Dry finish with some maple tones leading up to it and some green hop flavors sticking around after. Medium bodied with medium carbonation, nothing wrong with how this one feels. This is one that's easy to drink, though I'm not sure how readily I'd pick it up again. Its good, but it hasn't made it to my ""regulars"" or ""fallback"" lists."
"Final Thoughts - Definitely a decent entry by Shipyard. Overall enjoyable, and definitley one to session."
"Drink is still not to good I really couldn't drink even two of these."
"D: Sits heavy in the stomach. Cant have more than a few."
"Good brerwery tour if you are in the Portland area."
"Drinkability: A very malty ale, much more of an English pale ale to me. Decent malt/hop balance, and relatively smooth. Nothing to complain about, but nothing standing out. Might be good for someone into a malty ale, but not me. Mostly average for the style."
"D - This is a very smooth and sessionable beer. I have bought many a six-pack of this and will buy many more."
"I have drifted away from hoppy beers over the past year, as I got tired of the constant ""extreme"" hop additions. While interesting, it became distracting & led me enjoy more malt-oriented brews, which was quite enjoyable to say the least. Lately, maybe because of the hints of Spring that we've been teased with here in Boston, I have to say I am enjoying the hops anew. I thoroughly enjoyed the 12 pack from Shipyard, including this goos, basic American pale ale. Arguably not the prototype like Sierra Nevada & others, Shipyard's offering sensibly (to my mind) did not leave out the malt element. Golden yellow pour to a 3/4 finger white head & nice lace retention with a flowery hop & yeasty bread-malt aroma & slight apricot hints. Creamy & yet crisp with a bit much carbonation, good clean medium body & taste. Very refreshing."
"Why is this called an APA? Maybe my bottle is old, but I've got no hops and almost no malt. This beer is all Ringwood. It appears a clear amber with a white head and lacing. The flavor and aroma have a creamy sugar candy character with a hint of fruit. There's also a mild bready malt backbone that provides a pleasant contrast, but for the most part this is a simple, yeast-driven beer."
"One reviewer brought up pancakes, and that's unfortunately what I was reminded of after I read that. Call this an English pale ale and maybe I'm a little more lenient, but for my money an APA better bring at least half a wallop of hopping."
"D: Excellent beer. Can be enjoyed with or without food, and at any time of the year."
"From a 12 fl. oz. bottle with an expiration date of Apr. 09. Sampled on Feb. 28, 2009. I like the way it looks with its ultra-clear copper-golden tone. I gave its appearance the highest grade. Not much head though. The aroma is mostly malty and vaguely hopped. The mouthfeel is medium and the flavor is also quite malty and a little fruity. It's a nice product."
"D- Decent. Not something I would buy again though."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a light amber golden color with very little head. Smells kind of toasty but off-putting. Taste is kind of toasty malts and unlike any other apa I've ever had. Light-medium bodied mouthfeel. Drinkable but the toasty-ness doesn't do well for the style. All in all an ok beer."
"This is a solid brew that I will revisit occasionally."
"The flavor seems typical of an English pale, slight sweetness immediately balanced by earthy hop flavor and mild hop bitterness. The biscuit flavor is also prevalent. Mouthfeel is ok...slightly more carbonated than I would like, but has a nice feel otherwise. There is, however, a bit of astringency making what would be a nice session beer tough to drink lots of."
"A decent beer from Shipyard. Worth checking out."
"Overall: I as a bit surprise by the nose. it seem every time I went to nose the beer it change forms on me. There is a slight chalky, powdery mouth feel. The finish is bitter and it lingers for a bit on the palate. It is not a great beer but it is better than most."
"The Shipyard Brewing Co. makes a variety of different beers, but once you've tried one, you've more or less had them all. The taste is similar across the board. The Export Ale was the first that I tried growing up in Maine and it pours a typical light brownish color with a bubbly head. It is definitely possible to smell the hops immediately after pouring and that is the predominant taste as well. I would recommend Shipyard to those looking to enjoy a nice easy Ale, especially when visiting Maine and looking to pair your beverage with seafood. This brew is by no means offensive and they use fine malts from the Weyermann Factory in Bamberg, Germany."
"D - On the other hand, very easy to drink!"
"d- pretty good, i haven't seen this beer around here much but i'd def pick up some again"
"I usually drink Export on tap, and in my opinion, I think the bottled version is a bit mellower with the tap having a wee bit more hop bite. This is one of my standard ""go to"" beers that I feel comfortable offering a guests who simply ask for ""a beer"". I enjoy most of the products that Shipyard produces...wish it had a greater distribution range. A bit hard to find here in NJ."
"I hated their IPA, but the export wasn't so bad. It had much more flavor and was actually hoppy in comparison. I poured this one into a Piraat tulip glass. The head was light, the body was decent and the taste was very palatable. I could see myself drinking this beer all day. I wish I had found this beer earlier in the summer. It would be a decent session beer."
"Not a beer I'd buy again."
"Yellow in color and topped with a fluffy tan head. Retention is quite good. There's a rolling lacing left all around the glass. There's some hop aromas, subtle fruits and some esters. Tastes a little spicy with the hops being a bit more present to the palate than the nose. Malts are definitely present. Some fruit and honey are in the mix as well. A quick swirl results in very little carbonation. It's very light-bodied going down with a little chalky aftertaste a few drinks in. No complaints here."
"This beer poured a decent yellow/gold color with pillowey head that dissapated relatively quickly, no lacing to speak of. There was not much of an aroma. The aroma was a little sweet but not too much. The taste was faintly sweet from the malt with some fruity background. This beer isn't a beer that completely ""wows"" you but it is a good beer that isn't all that memorable."
"This brew was the typical orangish color that you would expect from a APA, but the head looked too thin. There was a decent hop presence in the nose, as well as a mild bite in the taste. However, it wasn't nearly as hoppy as I would have expected. This brew just didn't really seem like an APA to me. There was a very mild malty sweetness after the mild hop burst; it maybe had a toasted malt character that seemed more like an aggressive red? Not bad, but just not what I had anticipated."
"I thought this was by far the best of the 4 in the pack. A nice solid beer here. Great smell, nice hoppy taste, and smooth finish. Also not too high in ABV so you can easily put a few back. I would definitely come back to this one."
"Bought a sampler pack. The drink had a wicked good sized head, almost an inch thick. Clear, crisp orange-amber appearance with bubbly lacing. Aromas were pretty darn good spiced hops; very subtly aromic. Taste had a hint of honey to it, sweeting the hoppy, doughy flavoring. Mouthfeel gives it a good crispness but it does have a slight over-watered texture to it. Overall, decently refreshing pale ale."
"Sampled out of the bottle. I didn't like it. Golden colored topped with a decent foamy off-white head. Spotty lacing. Malts dominate the hops here with some caramel, honey and oats. Tilts too heavy on the malts for my liking. A little syrupy as well."
"Too bad I didn't like it. Has a strange off flavor kind of a weirdly sour sweet taste in the middle of the mouth. Kinda funny beer. I'm hoping I somehow got a weird one because, well, it's not my cup 'O."
"Nice refreshing brew, I really enjoyed having a few of these during the warm spring season. Pours a light copper/dirty yellow color with a nice thick head and a good amount of lacing. The aroma is malty with a strong bread scent, mild hops seem to be present. A nice full mouthfeel is pleasing on the palate. The flavor is surprisingly crisp and really seemed to quench my thirst. Strong sweet malt presence backed by some mellow hops, there is a mild buttery taste that is hit or miss with this one. Overall It is rather enjoyable once in a while."
"Pretty darn good taste though, and extremely easy to drink. It's less hoppy than most pale ales. Smooth and buttery going down. Nice summer beer, good for relaxing."
"An easy-drinking pale ale, but none too exciting or unique. Perhaps this was a good alternative to macro lagers in the area (upper New England) at the time it was founded, but in modern times I would consider it quite average."
"You can knock these back easily because here isn't one disinct flavor that jumps out at you. Just had one after painting outside for 4 hours. Refreshing, not filling, not overpowering. Decent but nothing I'd go out of my way for -- but wouldn't refuse on either."
"Crisp and light medium-bodied Shipyard Export is a very well-balanced beer with great drinkability. Make mine a Ship-yahd, Bub!"
"Pours golden orange with a short lived white head. Smell is yeasty, doughy, malt. Taste is balanced sweetness and bitterness with a lager like yeasty finish. Not much hop flavor but enough bitterness to balance. Nothing too spectacular but drinkable. Very basic, simple average beer."
"There are brewing flaws in this beer, but it's not horrible."
"D: Definitely drinkable, I will having this beer again and look forward to trying others from Shipyard."
"Fairly thick for the style and uniquely centered around a slightly bready, less sweet malt over your normal APA Hoppy dominance. I like it. Alot."
"D-a nice ale with plenty of flavor,it would be hard not to drink another if I had one"
"Not my beer of choice as far as the drinkability goes, but I'd still take anohter."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it's nothing out of the ordinary, but it's a good solid beer to drink for while."
"D - Easy drinking but not much more than an ordinary brew."
"The taste has a good balance of malt and hops, sweetness and bitterness. It has elements of bread, honey, a hints of earthy pine and citrus, giving a fairly crisp finish and nice lingering flavour."
"M&D: Heavy and full flavored, again, more so than you might think just by looking at it. The carbonation was well matched with fine abundant bubbles licking back. The brew wasn't a stunner by any means but it is a great ""general purpose"" beer that I would love to sample again someday soon."
"I would never purchase or drink this beer again, this is one of the worst beers I've ever reviewed. I don't think it had anything to do with storage or transport because I bought a variety pack and the other 2 types of beer in it were exceptional. Shipyard is usually good, but they missed the mark here, by a lot.."
"D: Highly drinkable. This is a fine session beer."
"The best thing about this beer is that it goes down very smooth and doesntleave you parched. It quenches your thirst and leaves not fruity/hoppy aftertaste in your mouth that you dont want. Overall a decent beer but i have to say it isnt worth a purchase of a six pack."
"Wow #100 and I'm drinking Shipyard Export Ale. No offense to this beer but with a decent cellar, I think I should have celebrated with a different beer. But, onto the review. Poured a 12oz bottle into a Smokestack Goblet. Aroma is nondescript. Nothing special but nothing outstanding either. Though I was expecting a bit of hops in the aroma. Taste is about the same. Faint hint of smoke (maybe just roasted malts), wheat and just a bit of hops (I'm stretching when I say bit). Mouthfeel is about average. Its drinkable. Nothing special."
"meh"
"Pours a perfectly clear yellow-gold in color with a full 2 fingers of soapy, long-lasting head. Aroma is quite faint but pleasant; dominated by a slightly caramel maltiness with only mere hints of hops. Taste is, at first, much like the aroma. Very malty and somewhat sweet. Towards the finish however, hops suddenly appear, mostly citrusy and spicy, not overwhelming but they contrast rather starkly against the overwhelming maltiness. Into the finish there is a good amount of bitterness. In the late finish and into the after taste I can detect some honey notes. Mouthfeel is good, light-medium body with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good as well. This is a solid APA but more malty than hoppy."
"Pours a fogged straw/gold what gives a decent white-ish head that falls rather quickly. Nose is boring. Flavor is earthy and leafy with a sweet tone. Minor citrus. Not very interesting or complex, but well rounded enough. Feel is decent. Low, soft carbonation on a average liquid body. Very easy to drink and certainly a possible session brew."
"Re-review July 2008: The beer definitely has a buttery diacetyl taste to it. Actually the buttery malt lingers a bit too much and leaves a slightly oily mouthfeel in its wake. I still like the cracked barley taste to the beer, but the diacetyl is a bit more than I care for. I'm knocking this down a peg."
"Another bottle copped singly from Total Wine and more in West Orange...Was a huge fan of shipyards pumpkin ale as this is considered their flagship beer it is a overall good sample that goes down smooth and is very easy to drink...Nice amber/copper appearance with slight carbonation present...Smell is very bready with hints of caramel and butter...Taste compliments the aroma with a slightly malty bread and butter finish and slight bitterness that lingers on the palate...Good mouthfeel and easy drinkability make this a good sociable session beer...A classic American brew...Recommended."
"For Shipyard's flagship beer, I'm sure they could do better or at least improve it to make it stand out, as is though it's a bit bland in the taste department."
"Wet and thirst-quenching, but with a dry bready finish. Highly ""quaffable."" A very good session bitter. Sweeter than normal, but well-balanced and smooth."
"D: Goes down easy and quick."
"Beer pours a golden amber color with a modest off white creamy head that fades leaving the lace to conceal the glass. Nose has pleasant malt sweetness with a bit of earthiness and oranges, crisp almost acidic, touch of hops. Start is light to moderately sweet, slight hop spicy bite, top is light to medium in feel. Finish has an understated hop presence, acidity stinging, dry as they come."
"It starts off promising with its appearance; bright pale blonde with a big crackling head. Odd aroma of sour grains and a touch of grapefruit. The flavor is alright, but hints of ink spoil part of it. A touch of herbal and kissed with citrus, all tied to a mild astringency. I tried to like it, but I didn't. It's light enough to drink easy, but that damn ink-tasting off-flavor takes a lot of will to consume."
"Enjoyed on tap at the Marriott Hotel in South Portland, Maine. This was a bright and clear, deep golden color brew with just a whisp of a white cover and very fine lacing that held nicely. The aroma is a pleasant but subtle lemon cookie dough deal. The flavor is also clean and easy enough to drink multiple sample. It has a bready citrus/wheat flavor. Clean, a bit acqueous with kind flimsy carbonation. This might appeal to any beer drinker, fairly mild and refreshing but generally unspectacular and forgettable."
"Billed as a ""Canadian Style Ale"". Pours a light yellow. Very dry and lightly malty. Crisp, clean finish. Tastes like many Canadian beers I've had; that is to say, it's good, but not great."
"D: Simple and good; definitely sessionable and worthy of another tasting or two."
"Solid contribution to the lighter side of the pale ale."
"Cheers"
"Had this on draught at the Emerald Coast Brew Fest in Pensacola, FL. Poured an attractive golden color with a decent head that didnt last too long. Somewhat of a fruit aroma, though not real distinctive. Taste was a bit fruity with a bit of a hoppy finish. This was nothing special, but was decent and inoffensive. Drinkability was pretty good"
"A very average beer. Nothing special at all here."
"This beer poured a clear golden color with a thick head. There was a steady stream of bubbles from the bottom of the glass. The aroma was initially hoppy, but became more sweet and malty as it sat. The taste is malty and sweet with a slight bitter hops finish. The mouthfeel is medium to full. Overall, I like this brew and consider it worthy of another."
"D - An ok, if somewhat boring session brew that exhibits a very British restraint and mellow character. That metallic mineral well water flavor can get on my nerves a bit. I won't be having this again."
"Overall- A decent beer when your options are limited."
"Overall, not to my taste. Fairly easy to drink, but just nothing there to really hook me. I will take some of the blame in assuming a beer called Export Ale was going to be on the heavier side. I drank it, review accordingly, then log on and find out it's a pale ale. Oh well, bland even for a pale in my opinion."
"Beer pours a nice pale color with some carbonation that lingers. Mild, fruity aroma with malt detectable. Taste is somewhat bitterish with more of an alcohol taste and not too much of other flavors detectable. Malt backbone shows through. Overall, an interesting take on a pale ale but nothing that impresses me much."
"Eh...pretty bland offering and not something I'd turn to again. Shipyard brews are very hit or miss with me."
"Bottle: Poured a golden brown color ale with a small bubbly head that disappeared a bit too quickly. Aroma of rough barley with this weird Shipyard yeast which doesnt really fit my taste buds. Taste of rough grain and yeasty finish dont really get me excited and leave me wondering where this is going. Average body with some adequate carbonation. I recently went through quite a few beers from those folks and I didnt find anything that excited me."
"well made stuff"
"Drinkability- For as bitter beer as it is, still suprisingly drinkable, pleasant for more than one!"
"- Bomber pour, cellar temperature, into a pint glass -"
"12 oz. bottle- color of clear honey , with a thin stark white head - nose of sweat socks , chocolate malt , sweet orange , and mild floral hops  taste of malt , sour milk , acidic , and mild hops - body is sharp , and with medium high carbonation  aftertaste of spearmint , milk , and sour"
"Cloudy gold from a 12 oz bottle with a medium whtie head and minimal lacing. Nose of light malts and hops, and not much else. Mouthfeel moderate, and flavors of sweet malts, light hops, and a touch of caramel. Slightly sweet finish. Simply ordinary but drinkable."
"D - Pretty good flavors, but it isn't your protypical APA."
"Drinkable - I never seen this and then in the past 2 days I seen it twice. I would buy this again. I enjoyed this one a lot."
"I poured into a pint glass. Light rust color with a foamy head that didn't last long and had little lacing. Smelled of grains and a slight alcohol scent. Tasted slightly sweet, some grains and a subtle taste of corn?? A good brew overall, not extraordinary, but something that goes down smooth and easy to drink."
"A very strong Maine brewing company."
"An okay brew for a light pale ale. Nothing special - inoffensive. Too light in body and flavor, but not a bad choice for something that is easy to drink with some flavor."
"Regardless, thin mouthfeel and astringent alcohol taste aside, it went down well and was great with food. I'll still use my Shipyard glasses. And I'll still love the logo. But Shipyard Export is one of those things I'll only try once-in-a-while (just to see how the formula changes over time)."
"I'm not a big PA fan, but I do enjoy them with food...particularly stereotypical bar food. This was paired with a 8oz ""loaded"" burger & fries and was excellent with it. I did find this Shipyard offering to be enjoyable and I would certainly enjoy it again, especially if paired with a good sandwich & fries."
"Pours a light amber color with a big bubbly head that settles down rather quickly. Aromas of mild hops, grain, and some butterscotch. The mouthfeel is watery and almost what you'd expect from some macros. I used to really like this beer, but my opinion of it has gone down over the years. It's a little better on tap. This is probably the only beer I can think of where the cask version had the same or less flavor than the original. That was dissapointing. Overall, this is a good session beer for me but there are much better beers to be had from Shipyard."
"A very satisfying beer and definitely a good choice for a session beer."
"Pours golden with white head with really small bubbles. It leaves some lacing on the sides of the glass. Aroma is grainy with hop aroma. Aroma is malty with some fruit and hop bitterness. Medium bodied. Bitterness lingers in the finish. Drinkability is ok, this is a nice beer."
"Ugh, I gotta admit, not impressed. Transparent straw color with simple disappearing head. Pine hop aroma with similar tase, but has a spoiled sweet/bitter flavor. Perhaps this bottle was not taken care of properly, but I would rather have water than this again. Has this stale aftertaste and seems improperly carbonated. Just kinda ""off"" in general. I'll pass."
"Decent beer, nothing to write home about. Spend that $7 somewhere else."
"B'ham UK"
"Shipyard Export Ale is crisp and clean with a flavor profile that is balanced overall. It is a raw, no frills type of ale with no one dominant flavor. Its not perfect, but I still like the overall taste. It seems like a good, basic, all around ale for consumption with food, on the back porch, or during a football game."
"Overall, a nice solid ale."
"D: OK. Not a bad purchase, but theres tons of better beers out there."
"I can't quite put a finger on why I don't like this, but the flavors mix together in a somewhat harsh way. My least favorite of the Shipyard line."
"I remember, when I was in some bar in Georgetown, CT and actually seeing it on tap, happt happy joy joy. An all around good drinking beer"
"m"
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson, AZ"
"A lovely gold almost amber colour with a lace head. Smell the malt - a refreshing aroma - with a touch of fruit that seems to appear in the mouth feel. I liked this pale ale. I always prefer a pale ale over a lager and this hit the spot. Maybe it was 'cause I drank the first three while sitting on my veranda on a warm sunny afternoon. The aftertaste was just a touch into the bitter zone. Just right for a warm sunny afternoon! For those of us in the border provinces of Canada it is sometimes frustratingly difficult to try beers from neighbouring states because of the laws governing our impoting of foreign brew. So to my fellow New Brunswickers let me say that this ale is not in the top fifty but a good ale that comes recommended for those who want to experience a local brew when passing through Maine on the way home."
"Pours a golden amber color with white sticky head. Aroma is buttery with a spicey herbal hop and malt. I for one am a fan of Diacetyl but it is one of those ""you love it or hate it"". Buttery malt dominate the taste with not much hops to speak of. Overall, this is a pretty decent brew that I won't mind having again."
"An all malt midstream American pale ale good for quaffing and sessions."
"12 ounce bottle. Best before notches at F and 06."
"Pours a nice golden amber color with a small head and retention, with little or no lacing (poured from a bottle into a pint glass). It has a very fruity, malty smell to it. This is a fairly tasty beer, but nothing too special. It has a good deal of fruity malts, with a decent balance of hoppy bitterness. In between light and moderate on the palate, with a good amount of carbonation...goes down fairly well and tastes pretty good. A very drinkable beer..tasty... but nothing too out of the ordinary."
"Feels nice 'n active on the palate, great for washing down a great fried-scalop dinner. Yum."
"Light-bodied and refreshing, but too watery. Good ""backyard beer"" if nothing else. Tastes like its trying to be a British Pale, but without the balance or complexity. Not horrible, but not really recommended either, unless you can find a single for about a buck or so."
"Notes: A decent pale ale, nothing extraordinary. Wouldn't go out of my way to drink it, but it's not offensive, either."
"I cant believe its not Butterbut it is."
"Total drain pour here. I'm glad I only bought a single and I'm glad Trader Joe's only charged 85 cents - even at that price it wasn't worth it. Hell, at least Bud Light will deliver a ""clean crisp taste"" without the diacetyl. This beer is a perfect example of why Ringwood yeast can't be trusted in the hands of any brewer other than an expert."
"Drinkability = Not really that good."
"Overall this beer is too thin and mild. There isn't enough boldness or complexity to hold my attention. Lingering buttery flavor becomes distracting over time."
"Overall just can't get past the off flavors. Would definitly avoid in the future."
"I can see the homage to British style beers Shipyard tends to make, but I've been to England and even the most dyed in the wool British pubster would have a hard time with the amount of butter in this beer. It dominates all else. Pour was a bit flat but not upsetting given the style, hop nose was non-existent, and the malt character was weak at best given its deep gold color. Also how can they call it and American Pale Ale when it taste far more like something from Yorkshire. Do they brew with the square or is their ringwood just really lazy. A bigger disappointment is that I had it at Federal Jacks ""birthplace of Shipyard""."
"drinkability: average-good"
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Drinkability and Notes: A great session beer, wouldn't have a problem drinking a few of them. Really doesn't stand out in any respect but holds strong in its simplicity."
"I found this beer to be a very good session beer. It was not heavy at all. The color was good as was the smell. I would highly recommend this beer to any of my beer drinking friends. I got the Export Ale in what is called ""The Captain's Collection."" This is a 12 pack of different Shipyard beers. I am now trying to get a case of the beer since it was so good."
"D: I'll finish this one, but won't buy it again. Decent enough, I suppose."
"Cheers!"
"Shipyard makes some decent beers; this isn't one of them. It was a nice orange color with a small head and some lacing. It had a sweet, grainy odor. The taste left a lot to be desired. It was mildly hoppy, but the bitterness was not pleasant.. Mouthfeel was very thin. Drinkable in that it will quench your thirst."
"EDIT: Available in Halifax at Premier Wine & Spirits. Dissappointed that the only American micro I bring home is available here."
"Sessionable, but only average for a craft brew."
"this shipyard offering pours a pale amber with a frothy white head that is very sturdy. it has an uncomplex aroma, slightly hoppy with a mild barley sweetness. had a slight bitter taste, something i didn't expect from the aroma. a decent offering, worth a shot."
"Not bad but not my favorite."
"Very crisp in the mouth, almost no aftertaste  which would be nice with the PA. For an afternoon drinker, this is OK."
"This pale ale is nothing fancy at all. Very light and simple...nearly no hops and not too exciting."
"The flavor does not do it for me. Very tart, with more grassy hops. A pleasant hop tingle mingles with some slight carbonation. Medium body. Some sugary sweetness comes out as it warms. Sticky finish, with tannin notes. Something about the hop flavor is off here, and the beer lacks cohesion. I don't want another one of these."
"Notes: Nothing really bad or ""faulty"" with this beer, however it doesn;t really appeal to me as it's not very flavorful. Reminds me more of the golden ales offered as a choice at brewpubs than an APA."
"This beer pours a light amber color from a brown twelve ounce bottle, with a head that dissipated quickly. I don't detect any off flavors in the aroma, but I find the taste to be disappointing. Definitely some butterscotch in there. I wouldn't say there is anything really wrong with this beer, but in my opinion there really isn't much to recommend it either. I don't care much for it, I won't be purchasing this again."
"Picked up a bomber at my newly found brew source. Glad to see they are restocking. Bottle smell is sweet and fruity. Pours to a light yellowish copperwith a moderate to firm head. Nice lacing. Taste has well distinguished sweet hops flavor but light and not overly sweet for an ale. Nice smooth finish with a blending of flavor and a slight bitter bite that fades away nicely. Carbonation is good not too much nor too little. Mouthfeel has the ale sparkle. A tasty beer by any standard. A good sessioner without a doubt."
"Pours a medium light amber with a 1 finger head and OK lace. Smells of sweet caramel malt with some spicy and slight citrus hops. Hints of apple as well. Again sweet malt up front and some OK hop flavor and a bit of bitterness. A bit buttery. Slight honey and apple flavors. A bit weak as APA's go but this one is easy to drink. Not much to think about with this one. A good session beer and one just to relax and enjoy."
"An exceptionally easy-to-drink, fruity East Coast pale ale. Not terribly exciting, but tasty just the same."
"A good mouthfeel, however, makes this one rather quaffable. An inexpensive alternative to the macros at least."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a pale, crystal clear gold color with little head. This brew has a buttery smell with floral hints. Pretty good taste with the buttery malts detected in the aroma making a return in the flavor with spicy hop bitterness in the showing up in the end. Tastey brew, could more than a few down in one sitting."
"This is the best Shipyard has to over, IMO."
"Overall: A fair ale but nothing to rush out and try."
"A very drinkable beer. It's nothing exciting, but we need nice, unabrasive beers around, too. Well done."
"A nice honey color,but a weak small head that disappears quickly.A nice hoppy smell with a hint of spices.A real hoppy taste,very dry.This is a light good summer beer,good for BBQ.Not a bad offering from Shipyard,I won't mind having more than one at a ballgame."
"A pleasant not too complex ale here. I wouldn't pick this over a SNPA though."
"Clean, crisp upfront, close to medium bodied, but takes a turn towards off dryness and mineral-like chalkyness the rest of the way as well as empty areas. Very plain and poor attempt at an APA. Far too dry and unbalanced with hardly a taste factor to it."
"A golden orange color. A firm, lace-producing white head. Great herbal aroma. At first glance, this is a solid brew. Slight malt aroma, and decent caramel and toasted malt foretaste. Then theres a huge astringent quality that kicks in. I wasnt expecting the beer to dry out as much as it did, and to present a chalky, metallic characteristic. Bitterness follows. Its highly carbonated, and ends abruptly. Its an above average brewbut, at least in my book, its not a stand-out."
"Serving type is a brown bottle with freshness date.This beer pours a classic golden color, with about a 1/2 inch white head. Smell is mostly malty with buried hops.A biy cirtrusy also has some hints of oak. This is a light- to-medium bodied beer, also has very minimal lacing. A bit sticky in the mouth but goes down easy enough. All around about average."
"Nice hop bitterness and malt balance. Very drinkable with an average mouthfeel. Seems there could have been more fruitiness from the hop aroma.A tasty beverage from the beaver (?) state. Definitely give it another go round."
"Malts anchored this brew, some metallic. No bitterness that I could detect although it had enough hops to finish clean. There was actually some warming which surprised me as its 5% but it comes through and helps this beer along. I liked the backend sweetness that is cemented by a crispness to cleanse the palate. I think this beer could grow on me."
"This beer pours a crisp golden yellow. The head is white. It appears quite fluffy and fades very slowly, leaving thick laces. It has a citrusy aroma. It smells slightly piney. It has an aroma that I can not define, but it is not all that appealing. It might be Murphys Wood Conditioner. It has a cirtusy flavor. It is slightly bitter, but not as much as I expcted. It has a very slight biscuty taste. It also is slightly malty. Ultimately, I am unimpressed with the flavor of this beer. It is too mild. I think it needs to be about doubled in bitterness. That would help. This beer is carbonated well. It goes down smooth, leaving almost no aftertaste. This beer might not be a good session beer because it doesnt taste good. I doubt that I would want to drink any more of this beer ever. It is not awful, but just not worth your money or time."
"This beer pours a very clear straw color with a small white head that fizzles out pretty quick. The smell is corn-like and lacking. The flavor or also corn-like with some sweetness. A little bit medicinal. It is not very complex. The mouthfeel is alright. Light/Medium body with medium carbonation. Average drinkability. It's an O.K. beer. Good for a night of heavier drinking and you don't care about diminishing your supply of these."
"This is a very flavorful beer. Nicely copper and a touch darker than I'm used to in an APA. Smells sweetly spicy. Sweetly fruity in a perfume and refreshing way. Light hopping and subtle. Tastes moderately sweet of fruits: peaches, pears, plumbs, and pumpkin. Sweet spices, like corriander and ginger, add a summertime refreshing flavor. Sweet fruits and spices round out nicely. Body is firm but lighter than expected; makes for an easy drinker. Finishes in a sweeping way. A quick finish, but not abruptly crisp or dry, just sweet and fleeting. Very nice."
"I'm surprised that I have not reviewed the Export Ale yet since Shipyard is a summer staple for our family. Nonetheless, I picked up a ""Captain's Collection"" recently, ostensibly to get my hand on the Chamberlain Pale Ale, but I get two reviews now. The Export pours a light amber topped off with a foamy thick off-white head. The aroma is of pine and is slightly citrusy, but the taste is rather different: fairly bland, some rose hips with a yeasty aftertaste. The carbonation quotient is high, and the mouthfeel is thin. This is a light brew, good for summer, I'd say."
"Smoothe mouthfeel though, very light. The carbination makes it a little tougher to drink, enjoy slowly."
"Overall: Decent enough session brew, I guess, but not one I'd like to try again. Pretty run of the mill, bland APA."
"Export Ale is way too Ringwood-intensive for me. Even though it isn't horrible, anyone who drinks this stuff better have a high diacetyl tolerance. I only bought a single bottle. If I had another, I'd put it in the cupboard next to the bottle of Mrs. Butterworth's so it'd be handy the next time I get a hankering for a tall stack."
"Lighter in body. Lightly crisp at the start, with a smooth and relatively clean finish. Decently drinkable. Not a bad brew, it kind of has a unique flavor."
"yellow-amber color, filtered to transparency. thin head that fades quickly; some lace cling but nothing amazing. rich malt smell, butter maybe and light dough with floral notes. taste is balanced with malt - sweet and buttery at first, then hops slowly take over and slowly diminsh to leave a citrusy finish. the thin mouthfeel is the weakest aspect of this brew, needs more body. otherwise it qualifies as a decent anglo-style american beer you can down in quantitity. get a couple six packs and some friends and session it up. or get a better maine beer... : )"
"Better than the macros Canadian golden ale. Some yeast, malts, and hops are there mostly in aroma and also in taste. malty aftertaste. Bit of head, thin mouthfeel. Sweet but Ok at end of summer day. Yeast imparts some citrus fruit. Easy drink, would to try on tap."
"poured a crystal-cleardark amber color with moderate off-white head that quickly fell to a ring. Smell is hoppy with a background texture that I can't quite place (sweet, burnt sugar??) Taste is extremely dry with an even drier finish. Not a bad beer, but not real good either."
"This was a good session beer. I enjoyed sipping it waiting for the plane."
"No complaints for this beer, but nothing that stands out. Pours a clear yellow gold color, head is good initially but short lived. Taste is alright, lightly hopped, sweet and clean. Slight bitter aftertaste. Very drinkable, a good outdoors summer beer if you can find a bargain price."
"Deep gold color with a fairly decent head that slowly sizzles down. Malty nose and a buttery rich malty flavor that is adequately balanced with hops. Aftertaste is slightly bittersweet. Overall effect is that this a fairly quaffable session beer but is unremarkable. There is better ales out there."
"Anyway, there are also some hops in the tail end of it. Very strong diacetyl though. Nice aroma, slightly worse taste. A decent brew, but not the best example of a pale ale."
"Drinkability: This one surprised me with its depth of character. Last summer, in Maine, I had some bad experiences with a couple of New England breweries that used ringwood yeast. Shipyard and Magic Hat were notable exceptions, and Export Ale has convinced me that ringwood yeast can be extraordinary when used properly. Export Ale is delicious, feels wonderful, and is highly drinkable. Geeez, I'm ready to go back to Maine, even if it is a 20 hour drive."
"A good drinkable beer that would work great a a bbq or football game."
"On-tap at Brian Borus. A nice golden colour with an eggshell colourd head of frothy foam. Aromas of sweet malts, and light green hops. The taste is nice, but very subdued. some biscuity malts and light hopping are evident. The mouthfeel is medium light and the drinkability is slightly above average. A good session drinker and a good burger beer. Nice."
"Clear and golden honey, very still. The off-white head went away quickly leaving tight bubbles in a ring with a dusting, but no real retention. Nice malty scents with a lot of caramel sweetness punching through that makes me think of cotton candy. A lot of carbonation in the feel, bit foamy, just a bit too much for me. Dark toasty flavors with some hops coming though. Bit of bitterness left on your tongue. Some gin in there, fairly astringent. Not too much screaming out at me, but this would be a damn good lawnmower beer."
"i like this beer. nothing terribly exciting, but it's good, and it really strikes me as different. it's quite unique tasting."
"Pours a golden slighty hazy color. Smells like buttery malts and spicy English hops. The taste is fairly balanced. Buttery malts with some hop fruitiness. Very clean taste. Kind of light bodied for my liking. All around this is a decent pale ale. It kind of reminds me of Bass Ale because of the buttery malts. It is worth a try!"
"The mouthfeel was solid with nice carbonation. Easy enough drinking beer, would be a perfect session beer for some folks. Its also a nice intro beer for advocating. It also went well with the food."
"The beer is dark gold in color, with a moderate creamy white head. Smell is of slight floral hops, and slightly stale bready malt. Taste is bitter and acidic, grassy and slightly bready malt is also present. Nothing too special, but not a bad beer. Good drinkability, this is a beer that I could sit down with a 6 pack of, and not get up until I plowed through the lot."
"This one has a clear gold body, with a slight haze to it. Small off-white head topping it off. The nose is light malt. The taste has a light-weet malt fron, buttery tones, followed by a touch of hop bitterness. Pretty highly carbonated. Med mouth. This is quite refreshing."
"Drinkability- Just a run of the mill ale IMO. Nothing great, but decent. May be a nice session beer for some."
"Pours with a three-fingered white head that fades quickly and leaves a good lace. Medium carbonation. Light almost clear amber color. Nose is somewhat hoppy. Starts and finishes hoppy with a lingering hoppy aftertaste. Medium bodied. 83¢ for a 12oz bottle from Cumberland Farms Convenience Greenland, NH."
"-Oelergud"
"Hazy golden color with a small white frothy head that doesn't last long. Bready, buttery aromas, has bready, grainy and butterscotch flavors, it is light to medium bodied with a slick mouthfeel, finishes a bit sour, not all that great, glad I only bought a single bottle."
"Purchased this as a store single based on a suggestion from the owner. Not only was he biased towards the Shipyard, he even had a very similar logo tattooed on his arm. Great IPA compared to the many I've tried lately (though I'm not a big fan to this kind). No lacing or carbonation but a great taste, not bitter in the least. Would suggest to any IPA drinker."
"The beer poured an orange-tinged, Harp like color. Some consistency of color I mean. there was little head and no lace to speak of. The beer itself is sour, not so much hoppy but sour like green apples or old leather. The malt does not add to the hops but rather contributes to the overall sourness. It was a wierd beer for me, usually if I don't like a beer on the first bottle it improves with the second, and ten some more with the third. But my liking for this beer decreased by the time I had my third bottle."
"Drinkablilty: Not bad. I'd like to try a few more of these."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable due to it's uniqueness and balance."
"The Export Ale is flagship brew from this Portland, ME brewery. I like this beer from time to time. Nice session beer."
"Pours a rich golden color with a one-inch white head that lingers for a while. Aroma of nice ale yeast, astringency, and a touch of hops. Rich, buttery mouthfeel holds a palate of light hops, fruit (apricots?), and some breadiness. Finishes with a very nice buttery texture and a taste of dry roasted malt. I like this, and it'd probably make a good session beer, but I probably don't want more than one at a time."
"Seems to me that this brewery is a bit average. But at least if you can rely on this as a session brew is need be. Poured out a golden yellow with some carbonation visible. Smell consisted of grains, slight hops, butter, caramel and some breadiness. Taste was pretty much as the smell with the breadiness really showing up towards the end and mixing with some peppery flavors that lasts into the aftertaste. This one's a litlte bit above average but nothing worth shouting about here."
"This ale is a clean pale yellow with a fizzy white head. Has a big malty sweet aroma with some spiceyness and something else ( Ringwood yeast mabye). A light hop bitterness followed by a quick malty sweetness that ends with a smooth spicey hop finish and again something else ( Ringwood yeast again??) This is the beer that turned me on the Micro revolution. It was nice to see that I still enjoy it."
"Too sweet to have more than one IMO. Off the mark in terms of style. This is one to pass on."
" Like said, I was looking for thisone & glad I found it."
"Shipyard's Export Ale exceeded my expectations and proved to be a very enjoyable pale ale. I was impressed with the mild malty sweetness and how well it balanced with a hoppy nose. It has a very clean finish and stays on the palate just long enough to know you've had a well produced brew."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a big ol' 2"" off-white head above the clear golden brew. Laces excellently. Aroma is malty, with a tinge of hops. Taste is of slightly buttery pale malts, ending with a hops bite. Smooth mouthfeel, and the drinkability is excellent, escepially for these warm summer days. I imagine this on cask would be exemplary, but haven't seen it."
"This is a very good example of a traditional English Pale Ale, although it's not vastly appealing to my taste buds, not being a lover of the style. Throw this towards your English Pale friends and they will love you for it. As authentic as I've had out of the bottle in the US."
"drinkability - too bitter"
"Beer is good. Happy free gift beering."
"Mouthfeel & drinkability as well as taste just above average."
"Note: Had this with a grilled talapia fillet and went very nicely with it."
"This pale ale poured a clear, amber color with white, sudsy foam that settled but clung to the glass a bit. The smell was minimal but improved as the beer warmed: light malt with a bit of fruitiness and a touch of hops, and finally a light touch of butter. The taste was malty with a light touch of butter (diacetyl), some floral hops, and a decent touch of hop bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth, crisp, and dry with decent tangy hoppiness. The body was medium and the carbonation was modest. The lingering aftertaste was floral and bitter hops with a touch of butter. This was a good, lighter bodied pale ale. Dry and easy to drink."
"A bit fizzy and biting up front. Lightly sweet malt and quite hoppy, especially given the light malt profile in this beer. Long hops aftertaste and unpleasant thin malt aftertaste too. Not well balanced or tasty. Pretty thin and non-descript. Basically a heavier hopped golden ale."
"Not a bad brew, one that I could see myself enjoying on a nice summer vacation up north on the Maine coast."
"Overall it's a bit subdued. It's not bad, but I prefer my ales with a little more character."
" A real disappointment after a Thumper."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a white lace head. The aroma is of pale malts and a sweet yeast scent. The taste is decent, but nothing special. It has a good balance of pale malts and mild bittering hops. There is not much complexity, but it is a fine beer none the less. The mouthfeel isn't that good. It's a low bodied beer with way too much carbonation; every sip ends with a painful burp. With all things considered, this is still a good drinker."
"Bitter, smooth with a feel on the light side of medium. Good hop strength for a Pale Ale, approaching an IPA."
"Nice mouthfeel, being medium bodied with a clean, crisp finish. Easily a most drinakble ale."
"When poured, it was a light amber yellow with not much on the foam or lace. The smell of hop's, malts and spices filled the nose. The taste was a pleasant surpise of malts and hop's with a spicy nature. A well balance of sweetness all the above. Also, a pleasant after taste that lingers on the palate."
"Pours an amber with a nice bright white head. A light, chewy malt flavor holds in the sweetness. Bitter hop finishing and a slight fruitness attempt to balance out this brew. Fairly thin mouthfeel. A drinkable beer, but nothing special. Another hohum shipyard brew."
"Pale golden in color with a sparse white head. Aroma is floral and deceptively hoppy. Taste is bready and malty without alot of excess sweetness. Hop bitterness jumps in at the end tying things op nicely. Great drinkin beer. Not too strong, sweet, or bitter. I'm bringing a bunch to the next party I hit. Drinkable and approcheable for converting folks."
"Drinkability: Nothing special by any means. Quite light and lacking in character. Won't try again."
"Poured a big bubble foamy, dirty white colored head. The beer is clear and light amber in color. The smell is lightly sweet butterscotch. The body is on the light side and the taste is pretty well balanced between malt, butterscotch, and hop bitterness. The butterscotch disappears in the minimal aftertaste. This is a pretty good pale ale."
"Good overall brew, and nice sitting by the fire...this one warms up nicely."
"Nice drink, tastey. Fails to warm up as nicely as I would wish for in both flavor and feel."
"Definitely a Bass clone. Palt malt, slight bittering from a dose of what I assume are Fuggles. Highly quaffable and good for a session or a meal. Does not get in the way of food and goes down easy. Good when the only other beers on draft are the Macros."
"Yellow gold color. Small white foamy head. Aroma is grainy, grassy and slightly sweet. Touch of breadyness as well. A medium bodied blond ale. Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are fairly spicy with a touch of grapefruityness, yet it is not very bitter. Its a blond ale, so the flavors are mild, but it does have some character to it, sort of like a very mild pale ale. Light and refreshing. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Tasted this brew twice on a recent trip to Maine. Rated it exactly the same both times. Funny thing is, I did not think I had tasted it twice until the time of writing after the trip upon comparing notes. Not bad I must say so myself! Second tasting was at the Portland airport. Shipyard brewpub tasting notes on the menu where quite good. ""Full bodied, yet lighter in flavor, maltiness shows through initially, followed by a subtle and distinctive hop taste with a very clean finish. A golden ale with a coppery hue, reminiscent of a Canadian style ale of old."" First tasting was at the Muddy Rudder in Yarmouth. This was my first beer upon arriving in Maine, I enjoyed it with a bowl of Crab stew.This was a deliciously fresh tasting and well built brew that had superior drinkability."
"Poured out a golden, slightly orange color with a head of white foam that receded and eventually fell back into the beer after a few sips. This is a nice and pleasantly bitter ale. Easy to drink. It has a dry bitterness with a fruity tang, along with a grassy hop flavor. Not bad at all."
"The taste is sweet malt then clean hops with a nice spicy finish. One of the best Shipyard Products. Very balanced, even, and clean. Great combination of malt and hops."
"I admit I am a closet fan of a good export ale. This one poured a medium gold color with a white head that was snap crackle pop like with carbonation from the bottom. The head receded pretty quickly though leaving a slick of white alonf the surface that continued to bubble. Smell was oily and slightly toffeeish with a butter aroma wafting here and there. Taste was malty and copper like with some wheat in the backbone of it. Very clean a crisp. A slight hop bite towards the end of the taste but nothing prominent. Pretty well carbonated adding to the crispness. I like this beer and would love to try it on cask for sure."
"Poured a beautiful golden amber with a nice thick white head. Smells of mild malts, bread, and a hint sweet citrus. Taste is well balanced with the caramel malt coming through at the end for a nice finish. Solid mothfeel. Highly drinkable. A very fine offering from good brewery."
"The bottle does not really state the style, and, for some reason, I thought this was going to be a Scottish heavy export. I was surprised when the beer poured a clear gold. The aroma was clean and fresh, and slightly fruity. Mouthfeel was very sturdy. Bright and malty on the tongue with a bit of cooked cereal that lingered through the finish. I'm still not sure this hits the pale ale style, and still seems to have some Scottish aspects."
"This beer pours a light amber color with a fizzy white head that disappears quickly. The aroma is not very strong, but it it a little fruity. The flavor is very malty and it has something odd in the aftertaste - possibly burned caramel mixed with citrus. Not a bad beer, but I don't particularly like it."
"This is a great looking Pale ale. Honey colored body topped by a thick white head that shows excellent retention, but little lacing. Hop laced, fruity aroma, strong notes of pear or raisin. The taste is a good bit of malt sweetness, with some fruitiness mixed in. Slight bitterness on the finish, but not much. Mouthfeel is solid and enjoyable. Drinkability is also good, as this goes down smooth. Seems like a more traditional pale ale. I like this one."
"Dark yellow colored with a white fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Little to no aroma. Mild flavor of floral hops, with citrus highlights. A light hop bitter finish comes through. Smooth mouthfeel, but a little watery. Pretty light and average beer all around."
"Appears a golden orange crystal clear hue with a pearl white two finger sized head of foam that leaves behind trickled rings of lace in my glass. Aroma some nice fruit (notes of cherry) aromas arise at first, blended with a mild hop aroma and buttery malt finish overall pretty pleasant not mindblowing but pleasant. Taste is crisp sweetness at first then a slightly woody tone creeps in on the scene with some earthy mild hop bitterness alright not bad, and I must note that the flavor seems a bit unbalanced toward the woody hop bitterness side of things. Mouthfeel is a bit thin lighter bodied ale not much texture here kind of boring in fact. However it's a beer meant to be drank as a session brew but I will continue my search for extraordinary brews."
"When this brew was poured, it had a large white creamy head with small bubbles that lasted a good long time. This brew had good lacing to it and the body was clear with an amber hue. The flavor was smooth and lasted throughtout my rating of this brew."
"This brew poured a creamy white head of fine to largely sized bubbles that lasted a long time and left a good lacing. Its body was a clear thin amber-orange color. I thought this brew was very smooth from start to finish with a light bitter flavor throughout. It had a mild bread hop aroma to it that was not very complex and rather on the plain side."
"This used to be an old favorite of mine some 10 or more years ago. And I remember it being better than this bottle I have now. How time changes. Anyway, a deep golden brew with an ESB like head to go along. Not much retention here and little lacing. Aroma is bitter with slight hop and malt fragrance. Medium bodied and crisp, with a slightly dry finish. Flavor could be stronger and as I remember, used to be quite hoppy on draught. Not anything outstanding but there are so many better than this one."
"Pours a golden coppery color with a retentive head. Shipyard brews have generally been very favorable taste-wise to me and their flagship product meets that standard. The malt characteristic is immediately noticeable but it doesn't necessarily dominate the hops. In fact, the finish is both dry and hoppy. Overall, I thought the brew had very good balance. While my favorite Shipyard product is their IPA, I'd also be happy with this one any time. One of our favorite local restaurants in SW NH recently added Shipyard Export to their tap menu and my comments on the draught product would be similar."
"Would drink again, but not if there was something else on that I hadn't had yet. Not a bad beer, just not exceptional."
"A fine ""light ale", a decent session brew for the less discerning, but I'll pass, thanks!"
"Pours to a clear copper color, with not much head, just a ring around the glass. The aroma is caramel malts, and spicy hops. The flavor is malty, caramely, with a fruity and spicy hop flavor. The malt and hop bitterness is well balanced in this brew. It is a light-medium bodied beer, easy drinking. I really enjoyed this one."
"On draught in the terminal of the Orlando airport. Having a 4 beer sampler at an airport makes up for standing in a line with no shoes on any day. Rich gold color with a medium thin white head. Pleasantly floral hops aroma. Maltiness hits you at first but is immediately followed by hops. I noted the commercial description describes the experience of drinking the beer perfectly (for once). There is also caramel and/or butterscotch in the flavor which is a nice touch. Smooth finish. Kind of light for my tastes but it was pretty good."
"Poured a decent yellow/gold color with pillowey head that dissapated quickly.Not much of an aroma I thought a little sweatness but not to much,the taste was faintly sweet from the malt with some fruity background.Nothing spectacular but quite drinkable,but not anything to seek out."
"Not worth revisiting."
"Dark yellow gold color, clear as a bell...fugitive head that's down to spider tracks in ten seconds but which do lace slightly vertically and horizontally on the glass. Sweet malt aromas, notes of buttery pancakes with real maple syrup. Malt carries forth subtly into the primary flavor impression, discreet but faint, toffee and pale diacetyl with a distant lime and white pepper hop to balance. I like a bit more fruit and chewiness in a Pale, but this could certainly be seen as a good-natured session brew."
"Perfectly clear beer. Deeper in color than golden, but not quite amber. Just a wispy little bone colored head. Nothing but an edging is left in seconds. Lacing is slight, but nice to look at nonetheless. The aroma is complex. Sweet. Toffee-like. Buttery. A bit like carmel corn. And some dry hop tones come into play as well. The first thing I notice of all things upon tasting is the dryness of this beer. Leaves one longing for more. There's also a nice caramel presence and slight butterscotch. I'm not sure if Ringwood is the yeast of choice for this brewery, but I wouldn't be surprised to find that out. A little bit of the same fruitiness and buttery qualities that I remember from some of the Middle Ages brews are here as well. It's nicely carbonated in the mouth and has a body of about medium. Very quaffable and enjoyable."
"Crystal clear, light gold in color, with a tight white head. The aroma is quite light, mostly grainy with a bit of floral hops. Nice thing about this beer is a really smooth transition from a light pale malty body to a mildly woody, herbal hop finish. A good body to the beer too -- filling in the mouth while staying fairly crisp. Quite drinkable."
"Nice dark golden color with a small soon fading head that leaves a thin lace. It's smell is malty sweet w/ a fruity addition, quite pleasant. The taste is also sweet, bready and complex. I like this ale, it's has nice features and is easy to drink. Somtimes it reminds of me some dark lagers, maybe it's the bitterness in the end which hints in that direction."
"Poured a gold color with a mild head and small amounts of lace.A very crisp and well carbonated Ale that leaves a bitter finish in the mouth.A light body with a slight malt texture.A hop aroma and taste thats not too strong,but there.Leaves a refreshing feeling on the pallate with a touch of lemon on the finish.An overall fair Ale thats very drinkable,but could use some more hops."
"smooth with a nice crisp carbonation and a thinner body (not real thin, but i wouldn't say medium), this is an easy one to drink. it has good malts in the taste, but i didn't get more than a hint of hops. there is also a taste of grains and oats from start to finish. i like my pales with a little more hops to them, so this one is lacking. it is a decent beer, a little better than average, but not a great example of a pale."
"This ale poured a light honey yellow with a white head that dissipates very quickly. The aroma is lightly malty with hints of alcohol. No spiciness from the hops or fruitinss from the yeast. The taste is light and crisp with some malt sweetness up front. The finish is refreshing with notes of citrus and a little hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. This is an easy drinking ale that is probably better in the summer than in the winter. A nice product but nothing really special."
"clear light gold. medium carbonation produces a thin white head. buttery/fruity aroma with some pale malt notes. crisp and sharp with a bit of toasty malts and spicy hops. Medium to light body. the crispness and hop bitterness really gets in the way of any malt body, making for a thin mouthfeel. not a good rendition of an english pale ale."
"Pours a golden orange with a nice white head. Well balanced with the right about of hops and malt in the smell and taste. A touch of fruit in the smell but nothing over powering. A little light for my liking but still a good beer. English style pale ales have never been my favorite, unless they are on cask!"
"The ""best"" beer on the Downeaster (the Portland, Maine train). I drink it right from the bottle. Peeking through the top I detect a nice copper color. It has a good blend of hops, and not overly carbonated. This last fact is crucial on the train, because the movement of the train can cause gastic disturbances. I always offer it to fellow passangers, enlightening them to what they are missing."
"Pours a light copper with a nice head, that leaves a sexy lace.  light tone on malt that has some bittering hops that are placed nicely.  The aroma of pale malt if profound.  The carbination leaves a sting in the mouth and palate.  Very nice brew."
"Notes: A bit thin for my liking, this brew used to have a bit more body and oomph from what I can remember. Feels and tastes like it is filtered too much. Not bad for a lighter ale."
"I'll pass on this one. I don't think a fresher offering would do much for me."
"Brightly copper colored, mine produced a rather fluffy, foamy white head. Nice thick sweet malty smell with some hop induced floral notes. Very appealing. First taste was dominated by a big sweet malty, yeast taste. Just like biting into a Bob Evans buttermilk biscuit (Wildman, knows what I'm talking about.) Very creamy rich taste, more malty sweetness than I have seen in a Pale Ale. Nice floral hop bite balances nicely. Only downside was a slight medicinal taste at the bottom of the glass. Very good, tasty and easy to drink. I agree, this should be their flagship brew."
"An english pale only in its malting.  A great Shipyard that should be enjoyed.  Cheers!"
"Pours a nice deep golden color with a decent white head that fades a bit too quickly.  Smell has a little bit of maltiness in it but seems to be mostly hops, and a little more aggressively hopped than most english pales.  The smooth creaminess of the malt in this beer gets you started but for some subtle and then some not so subtle hops kick in to make it a nicely bitter pale ale.  A bit to bitter for the english style but I'm not really complaining about that.  The flavor rests somewhere betweeen an EPA and an APA but leaning more towards english.  As with all Shipyard brews that I have tried so far the mouthfeel is exceptionally creamy yet the flavor leaves the mouth when the beer does.  another exceedingly drinkable ale from Shipyard, theses brews would all make absolutely excellent session brews.  A big thanks to the Bierman and JohhnyP for getting these lovely Maine brews my way."
"Golden-amber, crystal clear body.  Pours to a thick, bubbly head that just doesn't last.  Leaves a bit of clinging lace, but not much.  Malt noticeable in the smell, with spicy hops and a hint of fresh-baked biscuits.  Hops obvious in the taste - herbal and slightly citrusy.  Malt and yeast become more prominent as the brew warms.  Good beer, but not an especially good Pale Ale."
