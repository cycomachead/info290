This has all the characteristics of a macro - so in that regards, if sales take off, they are ready.  It has little smell or taste.  I gave it a strong score for Look, as I am wearing my favorite sweater today, and I think the beer looks good next to me.

The taste leaves a little to be desired for me personally, but I could see someone being absolutely crazy about this beer. It has a great profile and is pretty complex. I like how the malt and hop wrestle each other for dominance. As stated, the hop actually wins the battle by the end of the taste. It is a good beer and I'm sure it's great on tap.

OCCASION: prepping for P90X3--starting tomorrow...APPEARANCE: quickly dismissed off-white head; body is translucent copper with subtle, sparse effervescence... AROMA: caramel malts join with softer hops to produce a relatively pleasant promise... PALATE: sessionably sippable; slightly buttery; little or no aftertaste... TASTE: buttery caramel malts, front and center; a bit of blood iron, metallic hops; some fruity esters are involved--not so much complex as a base mixture of beer's usual elements ... OVERALLL: described as an American blond by Beer Advocate, I though this played more as an ESB--refreshing like a Kolsch, but more publike in its demeanor and flavor profile--not quite solid enough to demand seconds but not offensive...","dacrza1","Jul 02, 2014"

The odor was a weird mix of malty sweetness with you regular beer smell. I wasn't entirely sure I liked it, but it was altogether that bad. Mouthfeel was just a bit better than okay. I was very impressed with the taste - a nice roasty, sweet, malt and hops flavor that was crisp going down. Overall, a decent beer.

I have gotten quite practiced at doing this and I CAN intuit when to back off of the pour so as to avoid overflow. The resulting two fingers of dense, tawny head evinced good retention and produced some nice lacing as it fell. Color was a deep, golden-yellow (SRM = > 7, < 9) with just the slightest hint of a haze. My old friends, Croesus, Mammon and Midas came by for a taste but as usual, they proved incapable of sharing, so I went ahead with my business. Nose had a clover honey-like sweetness and when I closed my eyes, I swore that I was smelling lager! Mouthfeel was kind of full, thick and viscous and while the taste was very much like honey, it was cloyingly sweet. Ugh! I am not a big fan of sweet, especially in beer, hence my being a self-avowed hophead. The finish remained ungodly sweet and I was not enamored of it. There was nothing intrinsically wrong with this beer and it was stylistically correct, but it just was not my cuppa tea. YMMV.","woodychandler","Jan 05, 2014"

Their IPAs usually miss the mark, but they're American style beers, are on point. Very drinkable, great color, not to heavy, not to light. This is a versatile beer. Whether its 9 degrees on a Maine night or a July 4th weekend, this beer is good to go anytime of year. Arguably it's best attribute is the aftertaste, which is sweet and malty and makes you want another round. Good stuff here by Shipyard, Cheers","Zeke30","Sep 20, 2013"

Bread, dough and caramel. Opens up with grass and earth. Citrus in back. Taste is grainy malt like it wants to be an amber with apples on top. Not really balanced. Plenty of cracker and bread. Diacetyl. A touch of hop bitter and oil on the tongue at the end and a small bite from the carbonation. Body is thin and not heavy. Doesn’t finish well because it finishes sweet and the diacetyl leaves bitter. It’s just ok.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

Foamy broken rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with some grassy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp but somewhat medium bodied mouthfeel.

I've mentioned in many reviews that I don't like my beer to taste like grass. However, other than that it was great. I loved the balance and I loved that the flavours were not masked by bitterness from the hops or from burnt malt, nor was any of the flavour masked by sweetness.

Light golden in color with a medium level of haze and cloudiness to it that obscured a bit of the sunlight poking through. Nice head of white capped the top and settled down smoothly and evenly, creating a decent broken crown that ringed the side of the glass and kept some nice lacing. Aroma was light, and this would be a trend throughout the day. Light notes of peach and light grain are really all that is coming through right now. Warming brought a smidge of citrus to it, but nothing really standing out here for me at all. Crisp, clean flavor though with light hints of clove and heather that sat on top of a base that resembled mostly light fruits and hints of grain. Smooth, light body was not overly carbonated but rather a bit silky and left just the right amount of dryness on the tongue as it worked itself through.","mikesgroove","May 22, 2011"

He assured me that this was how the beer was supposed to taste and so I, not being one to waste beer, choked it down.

I thoroughly enjoyed the 12 pack from Shipyard, including this goos, basic American pale ale. Arguably not the prototype like Sierra Nevada & others, Shipyard's offering sensibly (to my mind) did not leave out the malt element.

Towards the finish however, hops suddenly appear, mostly citrusy and spicy, not overwhelming but they contrast rather starkly against the overwhelming maltiness. Into the finish there is a good amount of bitterness. In the late finish and into the after taste I can detect some honey notes. Mouthfeel is good, light-medium body with moderate carbonation.

I think it needs to be about doubled in bitterness. That would help. This beer is carbonated well. It goes down smooth, leaving almost no aftertaste.

The body is on the light side and the taste is pretty well balanced between malt, butterscotch, and hop bitterness. The butterscotch disappears in the minimal aftertaste. This is a pretty good pale ale.","HappyHourHero","Nov 18, 2003"

Hops are fairly spicy with a touch of grapefruityness, yet it is not very bitter. Its a blond ale, so the flavors are mild, but it does have some character to it, sort of like a very mild pale ale. Light and refreshing. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","beerguy101","Oct 12, 2003"

Funny thing is, I did not think I had tasted it twice until the time of writing after the trip upon comparing notes. Not bad I must say so myself! Second tasting was at the Portland airport. Shipyard brewpub tasting notes on the menu where quite good. ""Full bodied, yet lighter in flavor, maltiness shows through initially, followed by a subtle and distinctive hop taste with a very clean finish. A golden ale with a coppery hue, reminiscent of a Canadian style ale of old."" First tasting was at the Muddy Rudder in Yarmouth. This was my first beer upon arriving in Maine, I enjoyed it with a bowl of Crab stew.This was a deliciously fresh tasting and well built brew that had superior drinkability.","moulefrite","Sep 26, 2003"

3.77,14.2,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I admit I am a closet fan of a good export ale. This one poured a medium gold color with a white head that was snap crackle pop like with carbonation from the bottom. The head receded pretty quickly though leaving a slick of white alonf the surface that continued to bubble. Smell was oily and slightly toffeeish with a butter aroma wafting here and there. Taste was malty and copper like with some wheat in the backbone of it. Very clean a crisp. A slight hop bite towards the end of the taste but nothing prominent. Pretty well carbonated adding to the crispness. I like this beer and would love to try it on cask for sure.","GreatPondBrewer","Aug 11, 2003"

3.94,19.4,3,4,4,4,4,"The bottle does not really state the style, and, for some reason, I thought this was going to be a Scottish heavy export. I was surprised when the beer poured a clear gold. The aroma was clean and fresh, and slightly fruity. Mouthfeel was very sturdy. Bright and malty on the tongue with a bit of cooked cereal that lingered through the finish. I'm still not sure this hits the pale ale style, and still seems to have some Scottish aspects.","Brent","Jul 25, 2003"

4.03,22.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This is a great looking Pale ale. Honey colored body topped by a thick white head that shows excellent retention, but little lacing. Hop laced, fruity aroma, strong notes of pear or raisin. The taste is a good bit of malt sweetness, with some fruitiness mixed in. Slight bitterness on the finish, but not much. Mouthfeel is solid and enjoyable. Drinkability is also good, as this goes down smooth. Seems like a more traditional pale ale. I like this one.","aaronh","Jul 09, 2003"

Aroma some nice fruit (notes of cherry) aromas arise at first, blended with a mild hop aroma and buttery malt finish overall pretty pleasant not mindblowing but pleasant. Taste is crisp sweetness at first then a slightly woody tone creeps in on the scene with some earthy mild hop bitterness alright not bad, and I must note that the flavor seems a bit unbalanced toward the woody hop bitterness side of things. Mouthfeel is a bit thin lighter bodied ale not much texture here kind of boring in fact. However it's a beer meant to be drank as a session brew but I will continue my search for extraordinary brews.","WVbeergeek","Jul 02, 2003"

Anyway, a deep golden brew with an ESB like head to go along. Not much retention here and little lacing. Aroma is bitter with slight hop and malt fragrance. Medium bodied and crisp, with a slightly dry finish. Flavor could be stronger and as I remember, used to be quite hoppy on draught. Not anything outstanding but there are so many better than this one.","BierReise","Jun 20, 2003"
4.1,24.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a golden coppery color with a retentive head. Shipyard brews have generally been very favorable taste-wise to me and their flagship product meets that standard. The malt characteristic is immediately noticeable but it doesn't necessarily dominate the hops. In fact, the finish is both dry and hoppy. Overall, I thought the brew had very good balance. While my favorite Shipyard product is their IPA, I'd also be happy with this one any time. One of our favorite local restaurants in SW NH recently added Shipyard Export to their tap menu and my comments on the draught product would be similar.","Greenlabel","Jun 03, 2003"

3.25,-1.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"On draught in the terminal of the Orlando airport. Having a 4 beer sampler at an airport makes up for standing in a line with no shoes on any day. Rich gold color with a medium thin white head. Pleasantly floral hops aroma. Maltiness hits you at first but is immediately followed by hops. I noted the commercial description describes the experience of drinking the beer perfectly (for once). There is also caramel and/or butterscotch in the flavor which is a nice touch. Smooth finish. Kind of light for my tastes but it was pretty good.","Dogbrick","Apr 27, 2003"

Sweet malt aromas, notes of buttery pancakes with real maple syrup. Malt carries forth subtly into the primary flavor impression, discreet but faint, toffee and pale diacetyl with a distant lime and white pepper hop to balance. I like a bit more fruit and chewiness in a Pale, but this could certainly be seen as a good-natured session brew.","ADR","Apr 08, 2003"
4.22,27.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Perfectly clear beer. Deeper in color than golden, but not quite amber. Just a wispy little bone colored head. Nothing but an edging is left in seconds. Lacing is slight, but nice to look at nonetheless. The aroma is complex. Sweet. Toffee-like. Buttery. A bit like carmel corn. And some dry hop tones come into play as well. The first thing I notice of all things upon tasting is the dryness of this beer. Leaves one longing for more. There's also a nice caramel presence and slight butterscotch. I'm not sure if Ringwood is the yeast of choice for this brewery, but I wouldn't be surprised to find that out. A little bit of the same fruitiness and buttery qualities that I remember from some of the Middle Ages brews are here as well. It's nicely carbonated in the mouth and has a body of about medium. Very quaffable and enjoyable.","Bighuge","Mar 22, 2003"

It has a good blend of hops, and not overly carbonated. This last fact is crucial on the train, because the movement of the train can cause gastic disturbances.

First taste was dominated by a big sweet malty, yeast taste. Just like biting into a Bob Evans buttermilk biscuit (Wildman, knows what I'm talking about.) Very creamy rich taste, more malty sweetness than I have seen in a Pale Ale. Nice floral hop bite balances nicely. Only downside was a slight medicinal taste at the bottom of the glass. Very good, tasty and easy to drink. I agree, this should be their flagship brew.","StevieW","Jul 23, 2002"

3.95,19.7,4,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a nice deep golden color with a decent white head that fades a bit too quickly.  Smell has a little bit of maltiness in it but seems to be mostly hops, and a little more aggressively hopped than most english pales.  The smooth creaminess of the malt in this beer gets you started but for some subtle and then some not so subtle hops kick in to make it a nicely bitter pale ale.  A bit to bitter for the english style but I'm not really complaining about that.  The flavor rests somewhere betweeen an EPA and an APA but leaning more towards english.  As with all Shipyard brews that I have tried so far the mouthfeel is exceptionally creamy yet the flavor leaves the mouth when the beer does.  another exceedingly drinkable ale from Shipyard, theses brews would all make absolutely excellent session brews.
