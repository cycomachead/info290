"It's light-bodied, as it should be, with a softer crispness that, while constant, gives preference to smoothness. A little leaf dries it out, but it never leaves the area between semi-dry and semi-sweet."

"OVERALL: Pretty crisp little summer ale here. No frills, no thrills, but a decent light option for outdoor activities in the summer."

"O- BMC missed out because this is the light, drinkable, everyday beer that they claim to make. The difference is that BluePoint Summer Ale is good, for real. P.S. I drank this all summer long right from the can, now, on the first day of fall, I poured one into a pint glass for the review. Good stuff."
"Overall - This is a good beer. Nice and crisp."
"Draught @ Headkeeper: This one pours a clear golden color. There was almost no head and no lacing on mine. The aroma is lighter but still nice. Faint malts, a hint of fruit and floral notes. The taste is nice. Hint of sweetness, faint fruits and some malts. Nice and refreshing."

"o - nothing mind blowing but a good session beer."
""
"Overall: a decent but unremarkable spiced summer blonde ale."
""
"Thanks to the creator of the can quest, woodychandler, for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is malty, sweet. Taste is very mild, some light malts, a touch of floral hops. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a mediocre beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, the neutral flavor and mouthfeel make this for an easy beverage to down immediately in 90+ degree heat. Other than that, I wouldn't reach for this again."
"Light gold with a sizeable head and good retention. Light malt aroma with mild lemony hops. Taste follows nose with a decent dry bitterness in the finish. Good overall malt backbone. Light feel with a refreshing carbonation and quenching character. A nice beer overall."

"The Crack rvealed yet another brimful craft CAN and the Glug initiaally filled my glass with foam until I backed off. The two-plus fingers of rocky, bone-white head were extremely fizzy, causing it to diminish in a hurry. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity and lots of CO2 bubbles in evidence. A fizzy yellow beer and Mr. Koch may eat his heart out! Nose had a soft maltiness along with a lager-like honey scent. Interesting. Mouthfeel was slightly thin, but the taste was lightly malty with a honey undertone on the tongue. Finish was semi-dry and refreshing, but somehow, I felt as though it were lacking something. It was kind of an underwhelming beer. I would look for something else for the summer."
""
"From a 12 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on June 30, 2012. The pour was golden yellow with a thin, fizzy white head, slow moving carbonation, and a slight chill haze. The aroma was your basic toasted pale malts with a clean and crisp hop note in the background. The body was summer light. While the taste had a pleasant enough pale malt character I was expecting more of a citrus zest in there as well. Low bitterness. It was drinkable on the 87 degree day on which I tried it out."
"A decent summer thirst quencher, but I'm not inclined to buy it again."
""
""
""
"O/D-Pretty bland. Not happy with a six-pack purchase. Another snoozer in a long line of Summer bores. Easy to gulp down but doesn't impress at all."
""
""
"Pours a beautiful pale crystal clear yellow with full white long lasting head. Nice scent of citrus and sweetgrass. Taste is clean and crisp , just what I want in a summer brew. Really refreshing. No hoppy aftertaste or bitterness; a great more than one choice!"
""
"Great alternative to a macro lager. Highly drinkable without that macro veggie taste. Good for a rather bland style."
"O: Refreshing, very easy to drink, and quite sessionable. Not the most interesting flavored beer but it is very light and refreshing for a hot summer day."
"Overall: At first glance, I wasn't expecting much out of this beer, and sorry to say Blue Point, I was right. Very bland flavor and nothing shot out at me with anything new. A beer I maybe might recommend to someone who is just starting out drinking new and exciting beers, but something I can't drink all around, let alone in the Summer."

"Overall: Quaffability is key here. This is definitely something I could drink throughout a warm summer’s day. Not much going on, which I’ve come to expect from Summer Ales but this is as flat, flavor-wise, as they come. Nothing stands out. I will forget about this beer by tomorrow. If you want an easy drinking, take to the beach/cookout, warm day playing frisbee beer this will definitely fit the bill."
"Overall this is really just a seasonal purchase and the price was right (mix and match of 9.99) but if I ever need a summer ale this one would be purchased again."
"Might or might not be a small step up from BMC. Pass on this one every time. 2.5"

"Top five summer beers in my opinion. A very full-flavored yet easy-drinking crisp summer brew. A perfect companion to a hot summer day BBQ on a rooftop in New York City. I love when a brewery finds a winning recipe and sticks with it. There is no need to fix what ain't broken."
"O – Starts bright and ends relatively clean."
"Overall this is a rather weak beer. Forgettable all around."
"O - Kind of upset I discovered this at the end of the summer, really enjoyed this one"
"Pours a warm yellow-orange color with a thin cream-colored head. The aroma features a faint combination of light, lemony wheat characteristics and a slight citric tartness. The flavor is likewise light, with a mild fruitiness that seems like some combination of banana and orange. The texture is light and fizzy, which works with the mild flavors. Overall, this one is a pleasant, easy beer that is appropriate for the heat of summer, but there is nothing that stands out among other mild summer offerings."
"This is a great summer brew and was a very pelasant surprise. I really like the honey aspect of this beer."
"o: Overall I found this beer to be something to bring to a party to add to the beer selection. It's not too heavy so it won't ""fill you"" and it will satisfy a lager drinker becuase it doesn't have that heavy ale feel."
"Gold colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is dominated by bread.Taste is bread and florals.Overall a decent beer that will not wow you or sicken you kind of a run of the mill flavor.I personally would not buy again but would recommend to try once."
"Not bad, nothing special though, much better options out there."
"o: glad I tried, but don't need it again. not a fan of overly malty beers and that is what this is...too much so at a lowly 4.4%."
"SUMMER IS HERE AND THIS IS A GOOD ALE"
"Overall it's a pretty good beer. Nothing too special, but nice when thirsty on a hot day."
"Mouthfeel is average with average carbonation. Overall this is a decent summer offering but there are many other which a much more flavorful profile which are just as readily available and just as sessionable. No need to revist here."
"D - A pretty standard light ale that could double for just about any yellow fizzy beer. The aroma is pretty nice with a light note of malt and some pleasant, herbal hop characteristics that are together reminiscent of the better international light lagers. The flavor is considerably more bland as it possess only shadows of the character hinted at by the aroma and there is very little to taste by the finish. Not bad in any specific way, just very bland and unremarkable."
"Not over the top, not a top rated one, but good and enjoyable, and at this time of the year, thats pretty good"
"O- not bad but i like my summer ale's with a little more wheatish flavor and dry feel."
"This brew is a clear golden color with huge apparent carbonation and a fairly huge head. It doesn't retain for too long though. The aroma is a bit off, bit citrus, grains, and overripe fruit. The fruit is the part that gets to me, it just doesn't smell that great. This bad boy tastes a lot better than it smells though. Comes in lemony and grainy at first, then some other citrus flavors come in along with some solid wheatiness to pair with the grains on the finish. Aftertaste is dry and wheaty. The mouthfeel is nice, it's light and gets a bit drying towards the end, and the drinkability is fairly good. A good, enjoyable summer ale. Nothing more."
"D: Definitely a beer for someone who just want's to keep on drinking. I found it bland with no taste that made you want to come back for more. I would steer clear from it."
"Overall – Not a trailblazing beer by any means, but still a very clean and crisp refreshing summer ale. It's extremely drinkable and would work well as a camping brew."
"Overall: decent and not how I remember it. Bigger and more flavorful than I remember it being, which is good, but I wonder if it isn't missing the aim of being a summer beer. Still, I'm sure I'll end up drinking lots of these by the time Labor Day rolls around. Cheers!"
"The first notes coming through were of the grain and bready like tones, cereal grains, which were present right away in front of you, were now taking center stage. Soon though some subtle hints would start to come out as well. A nice subtle touch of Banana was apparent, as was the slightest little bit of a hop note. It was hard to discern what kind as it was very subtle, but I would guess a little citrus or fresh grass flavor, not very heavy and just more of background lightness then anything else. Predictably, the first flavor that came through was the grain notes that were so prevalent in the aroma, but quickly these faded, or rather mingles in with some light fruit notes, some yeast showing their muscle. Giving me hints of Banana, some light lemon almost, very nice with a little bit of a kick. The kick probably coming from a little bit of the hops that were poking their head around in there. Light grass now mixing in."
"As a summer ale that is suppossed to be drinkable, this is. Just do not expect to be blown away by any taste. Pours a light straw color, no head, no lacing. Smells of some citrus, but little of anything else. Tastes pretty bland, has some lemon notes and is more bitter than I would have thought. Mouthfeel is that of a light lager and it drinks like one as well. Bottom line, pretty average."
"M/D: Medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, a pass."
"All in all, this kind of sucks. Not worth your time or effort. Don't bother hunting or trying."
"D - I really enjoyed this one, it hit the spot."
"My first sip of this beer was too reminiscent of mass produced American beers. I felt that though this is a blonde ale it should have been a bit more substantial. The flavor notes of hops was apparent but not as strong as I would like. Maybe this isn't the style for me, but overall I did not believe it was very good."
"Twelve ounce bottle pours a clear light golden body with a two finger offwhite head. Retention is average and there are some curtains of patchy lace on the glass. Aroma has hints of twangy wheat malt and lemon zest but mostly biscuity scents. Just a faint note of grassy hops. Light body is nicely carbonated. Taste has a subdued sweetness that goes well with the biscuity pale maltiness. Lemon zest, a faint note of grassy hop bitterness and an aspirin note comprise most of the flavor profile. Finishes clean and crisp. Not bad, but far from my favorite for a summer ale."
"This is a tasty crowd-pleasing summer ale. It's refreshing enough to drink on its own on a summer afternoon. But it's also light enough to pair well with a flavorful summer meal. I don't think you can really go wrong with this beer, and I would definitely get it for a BBQ or dinner party."
"Disappointing. Just kind of bland, with a few off flavors."
"Easy to drink and worth your time. Good summer brew."
"D: The beer is somewhat refreshing and thirst quenching, although the taste isn't very interesting. It's not a bad choice if you're looking for a light beer on a hot summer day."
"I think this beer is a solid example of a quality blonde ale."
"The beer pours a translucent cornfield yellow. It has a good two fingers of head that dissipate quickly. Limited lacing present as the beer is appreciatively quaffed. Not a whole lot comming through in the nose. Faint hop present and slight lemon citrus. Taste is frankly watery. There is as in the nose a slight bitter finish. Malt presence equally subtle. The beer is well carbonated and it suits its mild taste. This beer is very drinkable. Could have several of these without problem. However, there isn't enough going on for me to reach for it over other excellent summer beers. Really only slightly better than many bmc products. Fine to have on a hot summer day to quench ones thirst, but beyond that, simply average."
"For a summer ale I would expect a lighter feel with more carbonation. This might be past its best by date so some carbonation may have been lost. Overall it would make a good summer beer."
"D: Not offensively bad and undrinkable, but just terribly average."
"Poured a very light yellow with good carbonation and almost no head. Aside from some VERY subtle herbs, the nose had nothing. Ditto the taste. I understand that 'lawnmower beers' are supposed to be light, but this one was almost begging me to add some flavor in the form of a citrus slice. The mouthfeel was slightly above average, given the carbonation. Overall, I was sincerely disappointed with this specimen."
"A: The color of wet straw, thin layer of tightly packed head - 3.25, S: A light malt build adds some bready aromas, there is an herbal hop smell as well, some soft bubble gum on the nose - 4.00, T: Slightest bit of bitterness on the very tail end of the beer, otherwise the malt is what steps forward leaving a somewhat sweet doughy taste, flavors are somewhat muted, very smooth and inoffensive - 3.00, M: Medium bodied and on the creamy side - 3.50, D: A decent, very drinkable beer - 3.50"
"D- Not a bad beer at all, just nothing wow wee about it and there are other session beers I would reach for first."
"a great summer brew!!i can and will have this beer again ,very refreshing in the hot humid summer days."
"Pours a bubbly clear gold with an initially billowing head that quickly dissipates into nothingness. Sweet graininess on the nose. Taste is ordinary, unimpressive but not offensive - lightly sweet malts without much in the way of hops to back them up. Watery body is its biggest drawback. Blue Point has better beers in its lineup...I'll not have this one again."
"An okay blonde ale, probably good for outdoors in a bar-b-que."
"D/O: A decent summertime refresher, but nothing too terribly interesting going on. Would work well with a variety of summer foods. Probably good at parties with non-craft beer drinkers, but there are better options out there in the style."
"D - Not bad. Goes down nicely with little aftertaste."
"D: This beer goes down very easy, and hits the spot on a hot summer day. Nothing really stands out, but it all works well."
"D- One of the easiest drinking beers I've had this year. Not loaded with flavor and aromas but a very drinkable beer."
"I was pretty disappointed with this beer. I know summer beers tend to be lighter, but this one was bland and lacked the crispness that makes a beer like this refreshing."
"Pours a perfectly clear straw with a small head. Its exactly what it intends to be: a light, easy-drinking ale for hot summer days. Lemon is present in both the nose and taste. Slight cooked corn/veggie in the aftertaste. Pretty clean and crisp. Would make a great session on a summer afternoon."
"Pours with small fizzy white head that bubbles down to nothing making the glass appear to be filled with apple juice. Fruity, malty sweet nose, sugary with a little bit of mint aroma. Tangy in flavor and slightly alive with small bubbles that coat the tongue, the fruit flavors are pretty refreshing at first but become boring, over done and far too sweet. I'd like some bitterness, some crispness, this is almost juice-like in body, syrupy and coating, one dimensional in flavor. I dont necessarily care for it."
"Slight bit of body from the wheat. But the bad taste seems to dominate any positive mouthfeel."
"5/3/6/3/11 (2.8/5)"
"D: Good drinkability, palate is thin but with a half-way decent flavor making for a good lawnmower beer."
"M/D - I find this beer very drinkable but only because there isn't much to it. I wouldn't seek it out to buy myself, but if offered it, I would definitely not say no."
"Overall-would drink again, though I wouldn't seek it out."
"Taste is a malt front with a nice citrus back and some good balance to it. I like that this beer is not trying to be too much of anything. It doesnt overwhelm but it doesnt underwhelm either. Its very sessionable with a low abv and a good crisp finish and mouthfeel that is good for the warmer weather months."
"I'm going to go back for a second to see if anything else comes out. I'm on my second one, and maybe there is a cracked graininess that is coming through in the body. This beer is just ultra smooth and not much ""there"" there. The finish is just watery emptiness. The aftertaste is slightly soapy to non existent. The mouthfeel is watery, and a tad bit drying on the tongue. This is an entirely refreshing, empty, and forgettable beer not worth spending anymore words on."
"Light bodied, medium carbonation, the finish, again, to me tastes only of water and that's not going to make me want have another bottle, for sure. This one I cannot recomend."
"D - This one's just not working. Needs some carbonation or a pop of flavor to be a refreshing summer brew."
"I would pass on this one again, as there are more interesting summer styles to be had out there. Not citrusy or hoppy enough to be an adventurous outing, but one that's satisfying no less."
"Overall-not offensively bad but not great. Blue Point based on my tastings makes good beer but this isn't great, really watery and nothing notable. Still, fine on a hot day."
"Pay for it again, I will not."
"Somewhat drinkable, as there is a crispness. But, it also has a watery thinness. Overall, it's too shallow. Not a fan of what's going on here. Better summer thirst-quenchers out there, IMO."
"I was drinking this out of the keg while fishing Saturday night. This beer pours darker than your average summer ale in my opinion with a slight white head. The smell is feint but what I get is citrus. The flavor is nice, I mean its a summer ale not a DIPA like I usually drink but it has nice flavor and is extremely drinkable. The flavor has a mild hint of nuts and citrus. The mouthfeel is very pleasant and its certainly something that can be drank all night"
"A summer beer... nothing incredibly out of the ordinary... easy drinking."
"Pours a nice golden color with a nice white head that leaves a thin lace on the beer. Smells very grainy with a hint of citrus and malt. Their is more citrus appearance in the taste with the grain. Their is a slight taste of hops in the nose and finishes nice and dry. This is a nice summer time beer and easy to drink, I will probably look for this one again."
"Pours a transparent gold. The aroma is grainy and intense, with a nice dose of flowery hopes. The flavor follows suits, with a nice grain, good flowery hop character and a sly bitterness that comes in on the back end. This has a thin, refreshing mouthfeel. Not a trail-blazer but a good summer-time drinker."
"The mouth feel is light, which is expected for a summer ale. This is on my list of ""must haves"" during the summer as it is light and refreshing. I really like that it doesn't have the heavy citrus flavor that a lot of summer brews have. It's a must try for those that like the summer seasonals."
"Pours a very nice golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger fizzy white head, which leaves some sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, slight hops, with lots of caramel. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, grapefruit, with some caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice thirst quencher."
"Mouthfeel- I really like this. Starts off like a light ale but the hops come back for the finish. Almost like a pale ale that is weak or a summer brew that got a heavier dose of hops. Thirst quenching and I was pleasantly surprised by the hoppier flavors. The growler claimed this bew has another un-named ingredient aside from the lemon citrus-cardamom maybe?"
"Pours a clear golden color with little bubbles going up the glass. There is a one finger white head that dissipates quickly leaving no lacing. Wheat, malt and lemon aromas are well balanced. Up front flavors of toasted malt with the wheat and lemon following up. Not very complex flavors but well balanced. Light body, medium carbonation, this is a smooth, easy drinking summer ale. Not to much to it but enough to let you know you are drinking a craft beer."
"Pale gold with ashort tan head. The aroma gives off hints of creamy diacetyl (in a good way) and mellow bready grains. The flavor is pretty mild, but it has the same salty and astringent aftertaste that I didn't like with the toasted lager. It's almost chaulky in the aftertaste and that pretty much ruins this one for me. This one's headed for the drain."
"I'm not usually a big buyer/drinker of summer style brews but when I get the urge for one this wouldn't be a bad choice."
"D: Overall, a refreshing and enjoyable summer brew that is good all summer long."
"Again was able to pick this up at Community Beverage in Queens, which has a wonderful selection of Blue Point brews. Very light, summery drink with not much flavor to it. Its far from being watered down, but if its going to be called a summer ale, you would expect more citrus kick to it. Very small citrus hints with a crisp, clean feel. Not that the lack of citrus was its downfall, but it was a bit surprising to read the label and then taste it. Overall, smooth and refreshing, but not spectacular in flavor."
"D-Very drinkable on a summer day, the biscuits dominate the pallate. I prefer the Brooklyn summer to this."
"D - at less than 4.5% abv this is one heck of a summer session beer!"
"This ale is quite refreshing for a hot summer day. It has just enough flavor ""without that heavy citrusy"" taste to keep it interesting."
"Notes: I see this is considered an American Pale Ale but it seems to be more of a wheat beer in a lot of ways, or maybe like that Magic Hat offering (I forget offhand which it is) that they bill as a ""lighter shade of pale."" Scored against the APA style, this is way light."
"Light mouthfeel with a pleasing,tangy,juicyness. Refreshing summer beer,staying light with enough taste to make you want to keep drinking"
"A very solid summer ale. Poured a bottle of it into a glass mug. The beer poured a light gold colored body with a very small head and poor retention. Decent lacing afterwards. The smell was fairly malty with a sweet undertone. The taste was very smooth. It was a nice mix of sweet and bitter tastes with a sweet aftertaste that was honey-like. The mouthfeel was pretty thin, but that is expected of a summer ale. The beer was very drinkable. Tasted good, had a light body, and was very refreshing. A pretty good beer."
"Appears a clear golden large white head rocky appearance light ueven specks of lacing with each sip. Aroma light citrus zestiness with a light toasted malt profile really pleasant and clean overall some would say bland but that's not really the case here. Flavors a clean drinking ale with some citrus and pine hop flavors with a clean malt sweetness again a refreshing clean malt profile with enough hop balls to keep most interested I'm really a fan definitely easy drinking. Mouthfeel is light bodied even carbonation even a bit watery but to hell with the texure this beer pulls of light beer with flavor presence. Drinkability is high I could down a few of these without overthinking it I'm a fan of Blue Point beers that I've tried this is no different great stuff for the summer visit to the Long Island brewery."
"Taste is somewhat sweet, with biting earthy hops and very subtle hints of citrus. I'd think they would want to expose the citrus element more, since this is a summer ale. Still this is a quality ale from Blue Point, something I would have again and would recommend to anyone looking for a solid session beer."
"D: The tastiness is a little lacking, but it goes down easy, not-too-filling, Ive definitely had better in the style and quite frankly I was a little disappointed based on what Ive come to expect from Bluepoint Brewing."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" white head over the crystal clear light golden (yellow?) brew. Head fades at a reasonable pace, with heavy sticky lacing. Aroma is minimally ""beery", the lightest of grains and hops. Taste is light as well, a twinge of sweetness ""overpowered"" by a quick shot of hops crispness. We'll assume they are aiming more at the light beer market, and not the APA market. Mouthfeel is okay, and drinkability is actually not bad, for a summer brew. Could be more cutting edge, but it'll do."
"Pours a beautiful golden color with a long-lasting head. Smells of citrus and wheat...wouldn't doubt if this were actually a wheat brew. Goes down very crisp and it finishes with a little bite of lemon. Very enjoyable summer beer."
"D: Worth a try if you're on the deck sitting in the sun with some friends. Possibly a good one to bring to a party for variety."
"Comments: Nice summer ale from Blue Point. I drank a fresh bottle & was enjoyable. I would buy this again when in the NY area."
"Pours very light orange-tan with good carbonation, slight swirls of head. Nose has light wheats, not much citrus (was expecting more), and a hint of hops. Taste is a little fuller, more hops and light wheat, was expecting some citrus but not really there. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. All in all, easy drinker but not one of my favorites."
"Drinkability: Easy going, but not what I expected from Blue Point."
" This goes down sinfully easily. Has summer barbecue written all over it. Liked it."
"A very drinkable ale. Not as hoppy as your typical APA, but a perfect summer beer."
"I dont see any reason to purchase or drink this beer, other than curiosity, or getting it for very cheap (both of the reasons I bought & drank it)."
"Well this started off good. The beer was looking fine a nice golden ale with a fluffy dense head that dropped back and even left some lacing. Then I smelled it and everything came to an end. I almost poured it out right there, but I thought well if I can eat stinking bishop cheese I can try some of this beer. Well to give you an idea it smelled of cheap macro swill and had some corny DMS thing mixed with a lemon citrus and covering the glass to really get a good smell almost made me pass out. Well the smell carried over into the taste but thankfully it was cold enough to muted the wost of it. Suprisingly I was able to finish the whole bottle despite the smell and I opened a second one to make sure I didn't get a bad bottle, that one mostly fed the drain. Best part was the nice balanced carbonation and decent body."
"Bender: I couldn't get past the fact that it smelled like a Corona."
"poured a very pale yellow color with moderate long-lasting head. Smell is slightly sweet but little else detected. Tste is extremely light with a little lemony taste but nothing that sticks out. Mouthfeel is smooth and soft. Easy drinking on a hot summer day."
"A nice Summer brew on a hot day with a good drinkability level."
"Pours a clear pale gold color with a white head that dissipates quickly but leaves a nice lace. Lively carbonation. Mild lemon citrus smell and light malt smell. Taste the same as smell but a little thin in flavor. Clear crisp finish that makes this a very drinkable summer brew."
"Smell is very subtle, some light fruityness, some lemonyness, but I wanted more. Taste is a bit dry, sweet, light- this is the kind of taste I wish every Coors or Bud or all those kinds of beers would taste like. Taste and mouthfeel are both extremely refreshing and lively. Bubbly, not too watery, no bad aftertaste- simply refreshing. Very drinkable- it's ligh, it's cold, it tastes good, and you definitely keep going back for more. Great beer, especially for a hot day."
"If easy to drink lagers are the standard by which the masses judge beer by, this should be at the top of the list of beers to buy."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light and dry, pale malt scent with some lemon zest. The taste is decent as well. It has a light pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and a bit musty. There is a bit of lemon as well; not bad. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an above average summer brew. It's nothing special, but it drinks well on a hot day."
"The taste is all about hops. Light, and not mindblowing, but enough to impart a slightly puckering lemony character to this beer. Nothing spectacular. Good mouthfeel, smooth drinking and no strange or gunky aftertaste. Highly drinkable. It's a refreshing brew, and perfect for hot summer days. Nothing spectacular, but a solid beer."
"This beer pours pale yellow with a tall white head- it consists of large bubbles that quickly dissipate, though. There is a faint aroma of malt and hops. The flavor is crisp, clean and dry with lingering malt. There is a nice touch of bitterness as well. Overall this is a friendly, well made beer but ultimately uninspiring."
"12 ounce bottle, pours light and clear, suprise, bready nose, with maybe ahint of hoppyness. White head, decent retention and minimal lacing left behind. My favorite aspect of this light, summery quencher/quafer is the mouthfeel. it was soft, rounded and very smooth, not what I would expect from an everyday summer type brew. All together, decent stuff. Cant go too wrong here as long as its fresh and cold."
"Smooth malt character is replaced by hops with bitter finish."
"Drinkability many on a hot day with no air due to a blackout!"
" Blindfolded, I'd have probably guessed it was a Golden Ale and a good one at that. Maybe a Kolsch but not a Summer Wheat. In any event, aftre drinking the first bottle, I wished I could have obtained a full 6-pack."
"Very interesting take on an ale that looks and acts like a cross between a pilsener and a weizen but doesnt lose its ale character. Great summer beer, went exceedingly well with a pot of mussels and fries. If beerfinancier is asking for another, get me one too!"
"Nice golden hue, with little head even when poured vigorously.  Some flowerly aromas are noticeable. Crisp and delightful, it has that ""ale"" tang of fruitiness.  Hops cling to your tounge, but not too long, nor does it distract from any food that you might be eating.  An extremely tasty and drinkable brew- it is prefect for summer.  I also liked this beer because it did NOT (at least to me) have that lemony flavor that accompanies summer beer nowdays."
"I thought this was a delicious ale, and I didnt notice anything floating in it, possibly because it was on draught. I've had the bottle, and there is some weird floaters in there, but they didn't bother me. There is little head and is a nice amber in color. Goes down smooth, slightly sweet, and very refreshing. I had it on tap at the Lobster Roll, arguably the best seafood restaurant in the Hamptons. Went very well with the food. This is all over Long Island, so if you get the chance, try it out."
"Thanks to Davo for the sample."
