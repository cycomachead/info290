"Light and fizzy with some faint malts in the flavor. Grainy"
""
""
"O: I would never guess this is a Firestone Walker beer, it's an introduction to craft and I could see adjunct beer drinkers digging this, definitely not for me, I like more in my beer but this would make great lawnmower beer, it's light, easy drinking, nothing overwhelming, balanced. Probably won't buy this again as I think Easy Jack is a better value."

"Great tasting beer.  No bitterness, a slightly sweet taste, with a moderate malty flavor. Very easy drinker."
"An overall straight ahead take on a simple style done simply."

"1 pint, 6 oz. bottle from BevMo. Taste is malt forward with small hop bitterness and mild carbonation. Simple but smooth, dry and clean. No corn or rice which places it miles above the mass brewed standards. I enjoyed this for what it is: a refreshing crisp American Blonde Ale. Love the low ABV."

"Excellent tasting beer. My go-to beer on my west coast visits, just wish I could buy in Ohio."
""
"Great beer good taste, easy drinking"
""

"An all around easy drinking beer. it's a blonde ale, nothing experimental or crazy... that's why I love it. It's the perfect hot weather beer."
"It's a very drinkable beer. A slight sweet bite at first taste with a sweet aromatic finish. I really enjoyed this beer while visiting Cali this past weekend. A big plus to find a beer that is what it is, Just a decent local beer. It not usually a fan of blonde ales but this one makes me want to try more."
"Very good but I wish was sold in greater US"
""
""
"Nothing special. Decent beer with a light taste"
""

"Ok it is what it is...and there's nothing wrong with what it is.  It's a blonde ale and that's what it wants to be, so comparing it to something else is like comparing a good pizza to a good steak dinner; it's not fair to either.  This is the kind of beer you drink when you're having an impromptu bbq with some friends on a nice summer day.  If a refreshing beer is what you seek, this is one of the best in that class."
"It's a blonde ale. Anyone expecting something in-your-face spectacular is looking at the wrong style of beer. But, for what it is, it is really great. Crisp, clean tasting, and refreshing to drink."
"Smell and taste is malty and alittle sour. Meh"

"Quite possibly one of the worst beers I have ever had - I just don't get it."
"Really enjoyable but not unique or memorable as the popularity suggests."
""
""
""
""
"It's part of their typical 12 pack and I usually enjoy this one after enjoying darker and hoppier beers.  I dont seek it out but it's usually on the cheaper side in NorCal. It's light, flavorful and a much better alternative to the big brewery watered down beers."
""
"Wouldn't hunt it down, but its was a good beer."

"Really enjoyable but not unique or memorable."

"I am not a fan of blonde ales, but for being one, this is a decent beer. A little to sweet for my taste though."
""

"Lite and sharp. A little thin."
"tastes like miller or something similar"
""
""
""
""
"Good carbonation. Wheat-grainy taste. Nice blond color. One of my faves."
"A decent beer with a good taste"
""
""
""
"O- Nice malty beer with a solid hop presence that is drinkable on any occasion. It may not rate well, but in my book, it rates higher than it is on here. And that's okay. Keep in mind this was on tap; perhaps this one does not age very well in bottles. If thats the case, Firestone Walker really needs to get a new distributor."
""
"not really a Firestone fan at all or a American Blonde Ale drinker but this one deserves a good review, I was handed one at a get together and hit with a new respect for both the style of a balanced blonde ale and Firestone. Small hop bitterness  toasty smell of barley and a clean malt backbone, all in all a refreshing crisp ale"

"not amazed by this, but when i drink a blonde ale, i do prefer it to be hoppy, and this one most certainly is. its darker than blonde by a shade or two, honey maybe, with a tall but short lived white head. nose of robust pils malt and european hops with more than balancing bitterness. farmy in taste, with a musty barny funky weirdness that i dont think comes from yeast. not quite tang, but funk for sure. the pale malt is heavy here, old, and rich for a blonde beer. carbonation is high, body is fuller, and there is something distinct about this one, although i dont love it all that much. hard to make a simple pale beer distinct these days, and they succeed at that, but one bottle is plenty for me right now. short of refreshing but exhibiting some of the same characteristics. im glad i was able to grab one of these from lowry liquors, those guys do a  nice job."

"On a hot day, nothing beats it, period. Great ""drinkability"" and refreshing. Firestone offers quite a selection of good beers, and 805 is by far my ""go to"" beer. They also are promoting the hell out of it, so they obviously have faith in this beer as well. Have been to the both breweries (Paso Robles and Buellton), and loved the atmosphere and the food in the restaurants were great."

"This is just funny, I didn't like it at first sip and it didn't improve after that. A peculiar release from a great brewery. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Albertson's supermarket in San Diego."

"This is a very pale light golden beer with a modest but lasting layer of foam atop it. The aroma is... bordering on non-existent: a light dusty scent of hops, perhaps some malt, but it's difficult to tell. The flavor is moderately bitter, though hop flavor is lacking, giving away quickly to a little sweet malt, slightly grainy. Body is well-carbonated, light but not watery. This beer is very drinkable, but also inoffensive, and not memorable at all."
""
""
"Honestly, it's a pretty good beer. I tend to lean toward amber lagers, but I'm expanding my horizons on the beer front."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"That said, it's damn near unbeatable on a hot day. It's almost as light as a wheat beer. It manages to be crisp and clean, but still pack plenty of flavor. It's nice and malty, and they did a great job in not going overboard with the honey. It will be a staple in my fridge this summer, and my go-to at the pub for my first round on a hot day."

"Definitely a well crafted blonde ale, the malt is full and rich with a snappy hop bite on the finish. It goes from white bread to biscuits to grainy all in one sip. Its one of the best I have had, but still wont supplant SS Bombshell Blonde as my go to summer blonde ale."

"This is a decent blonde ale that has bready malt qualities and a slightly sweet finish. Smooth, light and sessionable."

"Overall – Nothing really too outstanding here. It’s refreshing, but a bit lacking in the flavor department."

"O: I'm not digging this one too much; the sweetness is a little too much."

"O: Decent blonde, though nothing memorable for me. Sessionable, though I would still prefer more hops."
""
""

""

"Overall - All styles are not created equal. So hard to judge a beer like this, when it's good for the style, but doesn't do much to capture the excitement or imagination of your average beer geek, in essence because the style is invariably 'boring'. For a blonde, this is amazing in its overall balance and its drinkability. It's perfect for a summer BBQ or mowing the lawn. It's mid-November, but I think I'll have another!"
""
""
""

""

"Overall a passable Blonde Ale. It might convert a macro drinker toward better beers. Probably much tastier on a hot summer day which it is not at this time. I have two more left in a FW variety pack and might tweak my review after drinking those."
""
""
"Overall, this is a slightly above average but forgettable blonde ale. I'm gladly finishing it and enjoying the rest of this glass, but I'm not upset I only picked up a single."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, try it, and be honest with yourself for what this beer is trying to accomplish. Great job Firestone!"
""
""
""
""
""

"Final Though: Its a beer that everyone can enjoy. Get some tri-tip and fire up the grill!"
""

"O - This beer is so popular right now in Cali that you can't miss it. I was skeptical at first but was glad I dove in and gave it a shot."

"overall, decent session beer, but not extraordinary"
"This beer is great for a hot summer day at the lake, on a boat fishing or to wet you palate after mowing the lawn but thats about it."

"O: Above average, but nothing special. Refreshing and drinkable."
"Overall, it's a really well-polished, perfectly balanced but basic golden ale. Well, not exactly completely basic as there are some hops to it (and they're really quite nice), but it's not trying to be anything other than that. Is it any better than an inexpensive American lager??? Probably. Better than a German or Czech pils? Well, that's apples and oranges. I've drank about 4/5th of it. Would I have another? If I was having one, yes, I think so. I wouldn't mind it. Good for warm weather. Any place a pilsner might fit in. Not really worth pairing with food though."
""
""
""
"O - A decent blonde ale with high drinkability. Flavor is subtle but nice. A slight saison and wheat character comes through. Nothing really stands out though."
""
""
"O: A very good sessionable beer that should be tried if given the opportunity to."
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Not bad. Brewed for the 805 area code as a fresh sessionable ale we can all get behind and enjoy with our tri-tips or local organic sustainable heirloom free-range farm-to-table artisanal rabbit food. It’s a good solid beer with unusual freshness."
"I do get how this beer falls into FW’s lineup nicely however I would have appreciated something a bit bolder and hoppier to rep the 805. While well crafted this is fairly mediocre."

"Wow.... for a blonde ale... not something i would buy just happend to aquire, but i did really enjoy this blonde ale. Nice dark blonde in color with some nice pure white head rentention. Aromas nithing there but some sweet malts as expected... but the flavor was quite full for style... lots of slightly sweet malt backbone no hops, but malt flavors were nice. Great with pub food in general when you dont know what you are eating at a party. Very verstile beer for a beer lover."

"Drink- It was better than most blondes. Still a blonde though."
""
""
"Pours a clear gold with a foamy bone colored head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, honey, and some vegetal aromas. Taste is much the same with a vegetal and slightly metallic aftertaste. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer with some weird aromas and flavors."
""
"O: This had a promising start, but the simple and dull taste proved this one to be average at best and certainly not one of Firestone's better offerings."
""
"Pretty much an average blonde, but great for the summer."
""
""
""
""
"D    "
""
""

"I spend the entire pint trying to understand what this was. There isn't much head, retention, or lace to this one. The nose is weak and offrers some strange fruity notes. And its taste is more of the same. If anything, it tasted like a weak pale ale where the hops weren't worked as much as they could. At least it was easy enough to drink, not terribly offensive, and was bubbly in the mouth. As far as everything else, I'll pass. It's a good thing this is brewed for the local Central Coast market, because I don't think it's necessary to inflict this beer on the people in my area (Orange County)."
"Not that good, but completely expected for the given style."
""
""
""
"The color when poured into a pint glass what a light yellow with hardly any foam and not lace. The smell was of a weak lack luster aroma of weak hops and that was it. The taste was of really weak everything in a beer. I should have rated it a 1 all across. Not a good blonde ale. What a disappointment from a very good brewery. One of the worst ales I've tasted from Firestone/Walker."
"Clean taste, mild mouthfeel, grain presence. Easy to drink, slightly bitter aftertaste, but nothing that should scare any seasoned beeradvocate. A decent beer, worth having around for other's to drink. You've had lots of iterations of this beer, this is the local brewery easy go to drink for the non beer drinker. It is what it is. You know what kind of beer I'm describing. Its an all barley version of BMC basically. Slightly better, a little more ooomph, but nothing special."
""
""
""
"Overall a mild tasty low alcohol ale."
