"Nice enough, but not really a lot going on here. Plain, fairly straight-laced malty brew."

"What is up with this brewery? Looks like they're brand new, and I wish them nothing but the best of luck. But, this and their IPA (which are their only two beers, it seems), appear to have the same malt and hop profile after all, with slightly different yeast strains to boot. If I were to choose between the two, I'd probably go for this one (I'm a sucker for steam beer) but it's fantastically simple and mediocre for what it perhaps intends to be. I really hope their next offerings to come through town are more unique, because these made me a bit sad."

"Overall, it's fine. Solid enoughâ€”not really offensive in any way. It doesn't really give me much in the way of excitement, but I'd probably consider drinking it again."
