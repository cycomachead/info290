1.25,-67.3,,,,,,"Aroma is of nuts, caramel, toast, and mild smoke. It's the only good point to this beer. Pours deep gold with no head or lacing. Flavor has a faint caramel note in the background. The rest is old, used coffee grounds to the point of being overwhelming. A totally different coffee flavor than can be found in stouts. Light-medium mouthfeel with coffee ground finish. Supposedly it's a California Common style beer, it's nowhere close to the prototype Anchor Steam. Not recommended.","B967ierhunter177","Jul 11, 2014"

It's definitely got a unique green-roast-vegetal something going on that I usually associate with roasted-two-days-ago organic coffee.

3.84,0.5,4.5,3,4,4.5,4,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.. Pours a beautiful coffee brown with a thin slightly tan bubbly head. Smells somewhat earthy and sweet with a bitterness to it, very much like coffee. Somewhat of a cocoa like sweetness to it that goes along well with the coffee nose. Despite how clean the beer looks and the lighter brown color it is very solid in color with very little light penetration. The taste is amazing, very much like cold iced coffee. The graininess from the maize is somewhat noticeable under the initial coffee sweetness and bitterness. Has a slight creamy taste to it as if it where ice coffee with a bit of cream, not sugar however. More bitter and strong tasting in the finish. Has a nice full and tart mouth feel just like regular coffee, Medium carbonation. One of the few beer's I ever new I would definitely buy again right after trying it. Cannot wait to sip a nice cold one of these later on this summer when it starts to get nice and hot outside. A must try if you're both a coffee and craft beer lover, although I can definitely see this might not bee for everyone.","Zachtheporter","Feb 28, 2012"

The smell is of a regular red ale with notes of roasted coffee on the finish, very roasty. This beer's flavor profile allows the coffee they used to shine through. It is very refreshing and is almost reminiscent of an iced coffee. With a light mouthfeel, this beer is quite quaffable.

Carbonation is vigorous to the point of diluting the body mid-sip, while the back of the tongue is washed with herbal hop bitterness, more coffee, and nutty caramel. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly with a clean finish. All in all, a tasty take on the Cali Common style; something worthy of a homebrew recreation.","wagenvolks","May 04, 2011"

That being said...Pours a semi-translucent reddish-brown with a loose, off-white head that dissipates into a swirl of foam and a thin band around the edges of the bowl. Nose is somewhat vegetal and also suggests spent coffee grounds. Taste expresses coffee grounds, some malty sweetness (caramel or toffee), followed by a vegetal quality towards the back and a light bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a carbonation that falls just short of lively. This is an interesting beer, but I'm really unclear as to what it is trying to be.

Very odd having this flavor unclouded by dark roasted malts or chocolate flavors. Very iced-coffee-ish. Pale carmel malts are present and are very light grassy hop touch.

The taste is the same, exactly. There is a nice amount of coffee in here, but it's rather quite subdued. For being a steam beer, I think the coffee is at the right spot as any more would have been to much. A simple style with a simple amount of coffee.

Very malty smell and a slight sweetness. Taste fell short for me, the lager taste shows up out of nowhere. A bit surprising and offputting, don't get me wrong...it is a tasty brew, just unexpected.

A little 1.5cm head forms on top, but the bubbles are so loose that it sort of fades quickly. Still looks pretty nice, but the head is a little boring. The smell is interesting. Very clean and crisp, but a very nice caramelly sweetness. I like the smell, but there isn't exactly enough in there. The one other thing that I can find is a bit of toastiness, which seems odd considering the color, I wouldn't expect to find this much burnt, toasty smell in there. The taste is where it gets interesting I think. You get a very nice grainy sweetness, that is filled up and balanced with the roastiness. It's really nice. You also get a nice slight herbal bitterness balanced with sweetness. The yeast prfile is very clean, which brings out the roasted flavors. Part of this flavor almost seems to skip over that moderate nutty, slightly toasty malt flavor I'd expect for the color. I find this really enjoyable and tasty. The body is a little thin, the carbonation rushes in but isn't too exiting. The drinkability is pretty good though. Enjoyable, not too heavy or overdone, but the roastiness is still quite interesting.","taylorhamrick","Oct 07, 2009"

Nose and flavor are dominated by notes of medium roasted coffee and rich toasted cereal grains, followed by earthy hops, slightly spicy, hints of citrus, a pleasing bitterness to compliment the sweetness of the caramelized malt.

It is tough to get past the coffee to find any attributes in terms of aroma so if you are not a coffee fan, this probably wont turn you on at first whiff. The interesting as it blends a heavy dose of iced coffee and fruit lagerness. The finish is slighly dry and I am left with sense of cocoa. For such a light beer in terms of body, there are heavy flavors and depth. This is a well-done beer and very different from other coffee-infused beers that I have come across.

Aroma of rich coffee beans. Taste? Try a crisp, nicely hopped lager with tons of coffee flavor. So strange, that I kinda like this. Could I drink a 6 pack of this? Probably not, but glad I grabbed a single.","RustyDiamond","Aug 11, 2008"
