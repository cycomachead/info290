"Some pleasant ester and hop flavour, but isnt balanced well with an over carbonated under bodied beer. Blood navel orange taste and aroma (seems over ripe with excess sulphur). Although could lend itself to a few if the sulphur wasnt so evident."
"Overall: I'm normally a fan of Mountain Goat beers, but have to admit that this one was a bit disappointing. Not awful by any means, just a bit of an awkward flavour profile. I certainly wouldn't recommend it at AU$69 a case."

"Poured this at a good temperature with a very fizzy, then scummy head. Aroma was abundant tropical fruit with some yeast and hop. Flavor's a bit more traditionally steam, but not much. The heavy carbonic tang hinders. Body's a tad thin. Finish is like flavor, not very balanced, too long lasting. Never want another. Very minimally similar to a steam beer."
"O: A poor imitation of the original Anchor Steam. Not bad but not worth seeking out."

"O: NIce beer that goes down quite easy. Good for a few."

"Overall: A very easy to drink beer, but nothing special. IMHO, it could probably do with either a tad more flavour hops or a bit more sweetness to balance the astringency."
""
"O-- Good for warmer weather but not a lot to this at all."
""

"Certainly a nice enouh brew , perhaps more suited to really hot weather"
""
"O/D - A fairly tasty 'light' beer. Pretty decent. I remember it being really tasty on tap at the brewery but less so from the bottle which is probably older. Not bad as a gateway craft."
"Overall, interesting. A great hot weather beer. Zestily refreshing. So when will Mountain Goat make their core business their better one-off beers, rather than the two they regularly release?"
"O - A little bit different and really sessionable."

"Overall â€“ an easy light drink good for hot weather or hot food. Enough taste and nose to keep it all interesting."
"O-This combination of sweetness and dry bitter is hard to put a finger on, but it works. The subtle sweetness takes this beer to a different level. I'd rather drink this than most of the IPA's I've had. Very well done."
"One of the most consistent beers I've tried, I would highly recommend this for summer as an easy drinking beer, and I will be purchasing lots."
"It's not something to write home about. Drinkable on a hot Aussie day, and is definitely better than a macro Aussie lager, but not something you would recommend."
"Ok summer drinking but not much more. Mild flavours of tangy citrus fruits and some dry aniseed (& smoke) on the finish. This beer is very subtle in all respects and clearly built to quaff. Some examples from tap have been much better so I will need to revisit at some point."
"Pours straw yellow with slight cloudiness from bottle conditioning. Fresh yeast on the nose as well as some lemony citrus hops in the background. Crisp soft mouthfeel. Bit fruity. Firm but light bitterness. There seems to be a subtle roast note in there as well. It's like a summer steam beer. This is a very very well crafted beer. Sometimes I absolutely love a gentle delicate beer like this."
"Food match: Thai, grilled chicken with salad or light barbeque fare."
"D - My first steam beer so hard to judge, but I liked it a lot."
"Well I'm impressed. Wish I grabbed more than one bottle, but I will cherish this one. Easily drinkable and well made."
"A bit of yawn in every glass. Not a terrible beer but not quite sure who would get into this. Not enough for the geeks and a bit out there for the regular folks. A bit of citrus hops on the nose and some more on the palate but very high carbonation gives it a prickly feel that hides some of the flavour. Somewhat one dimsional and drab for me. This is only the scond steam beer I've had, the other being the original Anchor and I didn't think much of that either so maybe it's the whole steam thing I don't dig."
"Everything adds up to make this one sessionable beer."
"With one sip, I was instantly reminded of James Squire Golden Ale, a beer that I have a lot of time for. Currently a rather underrated beer in my opinion, and the best from Mountain Goat that I have tried."
"D - Drinkable but not inspiring, wouldn't rush out to get again. Although I am not overly familar with this style it just seems lacking in something"
"This beer was given me to as a present and must say ive never tried it before and looking forward to seeing how it goes,it pours a dark orange cloudy straw hue with average carbonation that leaves a one finger creamy head across the top with a nice even ring of lacing around the rim,it has aromas of subtle spicey oranges and a big hit of wheat,it has an average mouthfeel with tastes of spicy wheat followed up a very nice dry crisp finish that leaves your thirst satisfied but still wanting another sip,although this beer isnt very complex and is pretty much straight down the line it is very easy to drink and would recommend this as a starter into the micro world for newbies."
"d) An interesting style, not far off the California common style description."
"What can I say? It's drinkable, there is flavour, it isn't stylistically accurate and otherwise it is a bit boring. A decent step up from macro lagers and an easy entry for new craft drinkers."
"Seems watery to me. But as already mentioned, that only adds to its quaff-ability."
"D - Not horrible but certainly could have a bit more oomph. I guess it's an approachable beer from a decent microbrewery."
"(Also, surely ""Steam Ale"" is a contradiction in terms??)"
"Mouthfeel is a bit tangy and fizzy but otherwise OK. Overall it's not too bad but if I don't ever drink this again I think I'll survive."
