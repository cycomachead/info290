"Great beer, I tried this brew a couple years ago and just tried it again the other day and I almost forgot how good this brew actually is. This is one of those beers that you just have to try!"
"Might be the most over-rated beer I've had.  Fairly ordinary ale with the usual malty aromas and bready flavors. Decent hoppy finish."
"Love this for a tasty refreshing something different."
"Excellent beer. Very drinkable. I would buy this any time on any occasion"
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

""

"Overall, this is a good beer for what it is. Very drinkable and also very sessionable. Not a very overpowering or interesting flavor palate, but I don't think that's what they were intending here. This is essentially a more finely crafted take on a standard American amber lager"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a tremendous beer, in so many ways. It looks, smells, and tastes great. The combination of malt and hops is such that you have substantial flavor, a clean finish, and an incredibly drinkable beer. I picked this up to celebrate a special moment, and it absolutely fit the bill. This is truly a world class beer."

"o: an interesting beer. Very unique. A very pleasant beer that I enjoyed this time where as 10 years ago I disliked."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is pretty one sided. Nothing special, Anchor needs to update their shit"
""
""
"O - I was quite blown away by this beer. It is really good! I had been putting off trying this one for a while because a coworker said she wasn't a fan of it, so I assumed it wasn't good. As a matter of fact, this is a very enjoyable beer. If you are into bread-dominant flavors, this one will sing to you. Couldn't see myself drinking this one frequently, but I'm sure it'd pair well with a plate of fish and chips, or crab cioppino. It probably would be an excellent choice for cooking with."
"And it may seem petty, but I have always loved the whole package of Anchor beers--the roundish bottle, the label, the cap.  Maybe I'm a little over-sensitive after having been ""away""..."
"Pretty nice crisp taste. It's like a hoppy lager"
""
""
""
""
"Wow, I rated this higher than I thought I would, but I sat down and thought and thought and this beer, to me is unique enough and so incredibly drinkable that I had forgotten that I had spent a couple years drinking only this stuff ( well, the predominant, on-hand brew). It's very good and a bit underrated."
""
"The go to beer period.."
""
""
""
"O: Solid beer.  Nothing spectacular but hits most of when I look for in a solid lager style beer.  3.75"
""
"Keg of anchor steam drank"
""
""
""
""
"The flavor profile is reasonably intense, fairly well balanced and slightly complex.  It begins with a moderate earthy bitterness that slowly fades to a mild caramel and biscuit sweetness.  The middle has a slight lemon zest like citrus note.  The finish is a slow fade of earthy and zest bitterness that lingers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my go to beers. Easy to find, easy to drink."
""
""
"Overall this beer was pleasant but I was expecting more.  It was a decent tasting beer that I could definitely drink it again as a light, sessionable beer.  I would like to try a slightly fresher bottle/draft just to see if four months is a bit past this beers prime."
""
""
""
""
"overall, refreshing beer, a bit sweet on the backside keeps it from being exceptionally drinkable, but a decent beer none the less. Would like to try the dryhopped version, I would like to see a bit more hops to balance out the sweetness of the malt."
"On tap. It was a bit skunky, rough after taste. Upside way better than Heineken."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an amber color with a finger width foamy head.  Head retention is decent.  Lacing is mild.  Has more of a sour fruit aroma.  Slightly sweet with some floral notes.  Has that lager type taste with a very slight sweetness to it.  Nice bitter hop at the end with a sour fruit aftertaste.  Not much of a lager drinker, but this one is not bad and definitely worth trying.  It is my first try at a Cali Common."
""
"An average beer. Nothing special. Has a slight skunkish smell and taste to it. Lacks depth. Drinks smoothly with moderate/light carbonation. Aftertaste is not very pleasant, but not harsh."
"A little sweeter than expected. Not a ""Winter"" brew. Early Spring would be might refreshing."
""
""
""
"A great tasting beer. Well balanced."
""
""
""
"I love this brown ale type beer. Clean taste with a creamy head. You can really taste the hops and malt.  Very little after taste."
""
""
""
"O: Solid, easily drinkable beer."
"O: Anchor Steam is pleasant enough, but if this is the prime example of a California Common, there's nothing about it that makes me want to explore this style any further."
"Have had better porter, but not bad overall quality. This is a beer you have once in a while, in between heavier beers while out bar hopping. It has plenty calories to keep you going."
""
""
""
"Solid.  Cannot go wrong with this one."
"This beer had the look and smell but the taste didn't tie them together. Kinda disappointed from the brewery reputation, the mismatch of favors got me."
""
""
"O - Very clean and in essence what a mass-produced lager could be, rather than what it typically is.  I enjoy this and would pick it up again, but I can say I do not find the style to be as compelling as some.  Nevertheless, this is an excellent example of the style."
"Dark amber color. Had on tap.  Got better as I was drinking. first slightly bitter then smoothed out."
""
""
""
"Working off old notes.  Will update with more details if/when I have another."
""
"O – Similar to a lager in its smooth drinkability and accented bitterness, with the juicy, fruity character of an ale. Very distinctive."
"Very solid Amber and extremely drink-able... This is what I consider a nice ""baseline"" beer, and then you start getting adventurous with hops/malt/spices/etc. as a brewer to build upon it.  I prefer a little more bitter profile, but I would never turn this one down.  Goes perfectly with seafood as it is often served with in SF..."
"Very good amber color Ale"
""
"An American classic that is really delicious. It is malty sweet with grassy/earthy hops and a clean feel. A beer that every BA should eventually try."
""
""
"It has a strong hoppy taste"
""
""
""
""
""
"To me this is in the same category as BMC."
""
""
""
"One of my absolute favorites.  Brilliant blend of malt and hops.  Combines the clean crisp characteristics of a lager with the flavorful, bold tastes of an ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Fluffy head with tanned straw color. Smell reminiscent of English pubs with a flavor profile to match. Served a bit too cold, but a quaffable brew nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Love it, but to me it only tastes really good in the bay area. No idea if it's the atmosphere or the climate..."
"Pretty average tasting beer, glad I only bought a single."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice tasty non-traditional lager with barley forward, slight hop finish.  Easy to drink, not too heavy. No CO2 carbonation, only natural carbonation and traditional brewing methods.  A real pleasure to enjoy and one of my favorite lagers."
""
""
"Seemed fairly bland or watered down.  Still better than typical American domestic brews."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent beer. Nothing remarkable here, but very drinkable. Has a bitter aftertaste but pretty smooth going down."
""
"Man I'm tired of doing this."
""
"Flavorless and a big disappointment"
""
""
""
""
"Really drinkable beer.  My new goto beer."
""
""
""
""
"Bottled on 9-17-14, poured into a shaker pint glass. Clear reddish gold color, one finger white thick head, pretty good retention and nice lace. Aroma is malty, with some light grassy notes. Taste was malty, like the aroma, with some peppery flavors and just a touch of bitterness. Mouthfeel was fairly light, but very crisp, almost dry. Overall, this is a pretty nice beer, quenched my thirst very nicely."

"What the hell is a steam beer?"
""
""
""
""

"Overall: not a style of beer I'm overly familiar with - I can't think of anything comparable in the UK off the top of my head - it's not a bitter and it sure as hell isn't like a lager either. Either way, given a choice I'd definitely drink it again."

"The only beer I didn't finish on my Old Chicago World Beer Tour. I tried it about 2 years later, thinking it might have been a bad batch...it wasn't. My taste buds flip inside out to avoid the taste of Anchor Steam. Yecch!"

"A classic! Pours deep amber with a white head. Aroma is big time caramel and sweet. Light bodied, well carbed and easy drinking. That sweet caramel carries through very well to the palate with a bit of earthy hop character and a clean finish. Could be a great session beer, I don't think there's ever a bad time to crack one of these. This is a very well made beer."

"Poured a dark golden color, generous head, nose smell was the good beer smell.  The head stayed right with it while I drank.  Mouth feels good, not bitter aftertaste.  Nice hop taste, smooth and tasty.  Good beer.  Drink quite a few of these."

"fabulous beer."

"*Overall this is a pretty unique tasting beer and style. Never had anything like it. It's like an ale, but it's a lager in style and taste as well. Some of the flavors are hard to describe without sitting down with a glass of Anchor Steam and figuring it out on your own. But that makes reviewing and tasting beer fun. It would be great with hamburgers, hot dogs, sausage, barbeque, or any grilled meats. Solid beer all around!"

"When in SF, you pretty much have to have an Anchor Steam.  It's available everywhere, and it's what the locals drink.  Goes great with seafood, as you would expect.  Nice dark beer, and the style is better than that of a generic brown as far as I'm concerned.  At some point I should try some other Anchor beers too."
""
""
"Overall, always wanted to try it, Nice historic beer that seems to stay within its style.   It is a little middle of the road for me, but I wanted to experience this style.  I would like to try it with seafood, perhaps a Cioppino, or crabs.  Cheers!"

"I'm in love with California made beers.. perhaps I'm biased, as I'm from the great Golden State. ;)  This beer is delicious, plain and simple.  Has a good amount of bitterness to it, but it's a pleasant one.  I like it straight out of the bottle, and I love supporting CA.  :)"

"I happened to watch the episode of Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter about this brewery,  having this beer in my fridge. The program gave a pleasant image about the brewer and I think that made this beer taste even better when I had it on the next evening. Good beer that tastes like a beer should.  Nice looking bottle and label."

"Grain and bread flavor dominates. A solid, classic brew."

"Copper color with a head that died to a thin ring.. spotty lace.. the smell is fruit, pear, clean malt sweetness.. tatse is the same fruit mostly a pear, tartness, yeast, very slight caramel.. thin lager body.. its decent for what it is.. would probably rate it lower if not rating for style.. just not a huge fan of the past 3 anchor beers i tryed."

"Overall, I really like this brew. Will definitely try again. This isn't the kind of beer that will inspire a revelation or challenge your convictions--although, it might be a revelation in that to me this is what a basic, simple beer could and should be and it might challenge your convictions if you've been succumbing to pretension and fad brews, thinking that only an esoteric style or brewing method or exotic ingredients can result in a glass full of joy. This beer is... zen like for me!"

"O - Begging forgiveness. Not at all familiar with California Steam beer.  This just wasn't bad at all.  It's like my opinion of Belgian beers: they just have their own little thing going on.  My first impression?  Honestly?   ""So this is what happens when you ale a lager!""  Give me another try next summer."

"I may be sentimental but this beer holds a special place in my heart. Long before the craft beer revolution this was the one that started it for me. That said, given the style I still think it's an awesome beer. It's not going to blow you away but then again that is not its intention. Just a great drinking beer of a unique style. I always come back to this beer."

"This is a really good beer. The Quintessential California Beer. A tan to amber color with a good foamy head. Lots and lots of aroma and the taste is equally strong and fruity with caramel and coffee undertones. had it on tap and out of the bottle. It's a great beer. I first drank this beer in 1987 and it's still a great beer. If you're an Ale fan you'll like this gem from the city by the Bay."

"I can't believe I haven't tried this beer until just now. I have to say, I wasn't expecting anything great, but I was quite impressed. Not a complex beer by any stretch of the imagination; yet, what it does, it does well. The most noticeable characteristic is the bold toasted malt. The hop bitterness is subtle, but does a nice job of balancing out the malt. Overall, a beer that I'd go for again. I really did myself a disservice by not trying this before."

"Not a bad beer by any means. I just wish there were a better balance between the malt backbone and the hop flavor. Just seems to me the flavor is dominated by the roastyness and has no counterpart to balance the beer overall. I would drink this again, but I would chose other beers first."

"Overall - Would definitely consider this for a hot day, tailgate, session, you get the picture kind of beer. Easy to drink, doesn't taste like hell after it warms up; in fact maybe tastier after it gets a little warmer depending on your palate. A simple beer, balanced well that provides you with maximum enjoyment and drinkability. Will definitely have to buy this again sometime. Very affordable by the way."

"Overall: I was quite stunned by this beer. A very refreshing combination of sweet malts and refreshing hops. Goes well with itself or particularly with a nice dinner. What surprised me the most was the price. I expected the usual premium U.S. ale price of AU$150+ for a case of 24 x 330mL, but at only half that, this beer is not only a gem, but a bargain. Well worth it - a great food beer."

"Has a Brady malt aroma. Pours deep amber with a nice beige head. The head lasts about a minute with moderate spotty lacing on the glass. The taste is Brady, slightly fruity. It is crisp not overly carbonated. Very nice, should be even better on a hot summers day!"

"I found this beer in Big Sur for the first time and enjoyed it at the River Inn. Near a pretty decent river. I loved it. It tasted like how perfect that environment sounds.

"O - I'm a local and have been drinking and enjoying this since before I was a beer snob, however, older and with a more refined palate, this beer is only slightly above average for me. Not saying I wont enjoy more in the future, but Anchor Steam I'm sad to say is mediocre. Anchors other beers are great, though!"
""
"O: I expected a simple beer and got one. It reminds me of a cream ale with a slight hoppiness and tartness to it. Simple but decently flavorful. Not bad."

"Medium copper with a finger of white head that retains well. There's light fruitiness on the nose with sweet caramel malt and a minty quality from the Northern Brewer hops. Overall, though, the smell is rather subdued. Clean sweet malts show up first in the taste, followed by an earthy, grassy taste and a lingering hop bitterness at the end. No floral or citrus notes are imparted by the hops. The body is on the lighter side of medium and there's little carbonation."

"O: With each aspect of the brew, it just got better and better to behold... It takes me back to one of the first craft/micro-brews I enjoyed as I reformed my pale American adjunct grain lager ways. After all of those years, I have come to realize just how unique, and special this brew is. A truly classic micro-brew, and one of the originals as free Americans rose up in protest to the swill the big breweries fooled us into drinking."

"O - This is an okay beer, but I have no idea when I would drink this beer were I to have again. It is quite refreshing but there are certainly more refreshing beers around. It’s sessionable but I’d rather session a beer with stronger fruit, nut or malt profiles. It’s not particularly hoppy which is fine by me as I don’t enjoy the hops but if I did like hops I’d choose an IPA. It’s relatively inexpensive but if I really want to get after it there are cheaper beers with higher abv’s. It doesn’t taste bad, but if I want a tasty beer I’m going to have some variety of porter, stout, Belgian or sour. It is well-balanced which in this instance is somewhat of an inadmirable virtue as it renders a neutral beer which fails to offer a definitive characteristic required to compel purchase. There are various reasons why I buy beer, but there is not a situation I can think of where another beer would not better compliment that reason."

"O: Anchor Steam has not failed to deliver on any of their beers I've had so far and this is no exception. Excellent pairer with medium to lighter fare (I had it with rice and chicken just fine) or on its own as a refreshing drink."
""
""
"Overall, this is a very good little beer. I will certainly buy a six pack of this beer in the future. This is worth a try-don't judge it simply because of its availability."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a lightly foamy (2/5) and otherwise smooth (3/5) body that's well-suited to the particular beer and style in general. Closes dry, with light stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."
"I had this beer on tap at Kimballs Pub in Williamsport PA. It poured a clear amber color with about a half inch head. It smelled slightly sweet and sour. The taste was slightly sweet like dried fruit but it was a little malty/bitter. The best thing about this beer is that it is very very smooth with a creamy mouthfeel."

I really can say that I love this beer... but it is not remarkable to the palate... to the level that I have become accustomed."

"Overall: This beer is a major disappointment. It miss the mark on every level. The aroma and taste only gave hints of roasted malts. While trying to infuse a hoppy finish, this brew ended up being a “bitter” mess."
"DATE TASTED: December 21, 2013... GLASSWARE: Howard's Pub pint...OCCASION: post Hobbit unwinding... APPEARANCE: beautiful copper-amber body supports a thick, pillowy head; solid lacing.. AROMA: fragrant, soft hops with floral hints; malts are minimal... PALATE: medium-bodied, almost creamy; highly drinkable lager...TASTE: crisp and clean; start to finish, an agreeable West Coast resin and moderate pine; little citrus to be found... OVERALL: though intimidating to rate a style all its own--I first sipped this ""steam"" beer with wide-eyed, impossible expectations--the experience is that of a refined, articulate pale ale with a slightly thin quality..."

"12 oz bottle poured into a pilsner glass. Pours a nice burnt orange. About a finger of head which has nice retention. Lacing is nothing special, but solid retention, like I said. Nice crist, clear appearance. Nose and mouth are very similary. very malty, earthy, biscuity, bready upfront. a slight hop presence. Very crisp. Pretty good mouth feel. the bready - biscuity taste lingers for awhile. Overall, pretty good. This was one of the very first craft beers that I ever had and I distinctly remember disliking it. That was at least 5 or 6 years ago. Anyway, suprised to find myself enjoying now the second time around."

"O: I guess I am seeing the Bros rate it so highly due to the respect it deserves for longevity in the brewing industry and the true to style characteristics based on the fact that Anchor Brewing actually created the style. Its a very drinkable beer but not my favorite style in general. If you like this style, this beer pretty much defines it. While I tend to gravitate to stronger, more robust, modern styles, I can see however where 150 years ago, brewing this kind of beer was a most awesome achievement! Go Anchor!!!"

"Poured from the stubby 22 into glass. It created a light tan, 1-finger head. A little darker head and color than I remembered. It's been a long time since I've had this one. The creamy head lingers nicely and leaves very decent lace. I honestly didn't pick up much on the aroma, slight hops. The beer is very dry, skews malty but leaves a pronounced bitterness. Clean finish. It is busy in the mouth and appears very lively in the glass with its active carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The metallic note is offputting, and I know the esters are a byproduct of fermenting lager yeast at ale temperatures, but it's still a weird combo. Great malt backbone, and fairly refreshing."

"Overall, this is a unique and distinct brew. Tastes like a classic with good flavor and mouthfeel."

"Small head that dissipated quickly and an amber body with excellent clarity. Nose to the bottle, smells like grain husk, cereal, a slightly medicinal, rubbing-alcohol scent detected. Taste is extremely clean; caramel and toasted grains up front with a slightly herbal bitterness at the end. Highly carbonated with a medium thin mouthfeel. Well balanced, tasty and extremely satisfying."

"Overall: A great lager. I would have no problem buying a six pack of this when I come across it. I definitely recommend this beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- My first steam beer, so nothing really to compare it too. Although compared to other lagers, it is a very natural feeling beer. Not too many crazy flavors, just a good clean well crafted lager."
"This beer is a testament to Anchor's dedication to quality. It's archetypal, like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale or Bell's Amber Ale. Few beers are as good, and even fewer are better. If you're looking for a gateway to craft beer, this is it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This one caught me completely off guard. I was expecting a lager and got something more similar to a fruit beer. And a pretty good one, too. Hot summer days beg for this beer."

""
""
""
""

"I am not a lager person in general and so It's not entirely fair for me to review this beer, but oh well. The beer has excellent dark amber color and has an excellent aroma. It is a somewhat thick lager so the mouth feel wasn't what I expected. I really don't like wheat beers and the taste, again it's a lager so maybe it's not ideal that I delve into this, was very wheat-like. The beer starts off decent, but through the heavy mouthfeel and thick grain taste I normally call it good after one. Most anyone else reviewing this beer raved about it so it's probably just me, but this isn't a ""go to"" beer for me, but I'll drink it if it's this or commercial beers available."
""
""
"Poured into a sam adams glass, a nice, off white, head developed with mild retention and lacing. Appearance was clear with a golden / orange color. Nice fruity aroma with spice notes. Tasted hoppy and light up front with floral and fruity notes, light caramel on the back. Medium mouthfeel with a light, dry aftertaste."
""
""
""
"Overall an interesting beer. Not usually one for lagers but I'll give everything a shot. Would get again if the mood struck me"
""
"O - classic beer, okay but I don't consider it a treat."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I'm glad I finally got around to reviewing this classic. It is lighter and more quaffable than I remember, but a a great example of this style nonetheless. At times, it reminded me of an English mild and other times of a German Pilsner. The whole package is a bit rustic, but the easy drinking nature of this brew would make a great session/football watching beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours into tulip from bottle a beautiful clear copper with small white head. Aroma of sweet mild malt, pears, some florals. Flavor is admittedly mild but definitely session able. Medium light mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Sweet malts and light fruits with a slightly unpleasant finish. Finally tried this and it is not too bad. Better sessionable brews though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A nice dry tasting steam beer that is very easy to drink. A good go too for something on the lighter side."
"Overall- Good beer for watching a ballgame, with lots of hop and malt character. Best with strong flavor foods."
""
"Poured into a pint glass from the bottle. Small, quickly receding head soon left after the pour. Initial smell is complex, but the combination of hops and floral tones makes it pleasant. The taste is sharp, but I think it lacks a full flavor. It is still very good though. A very sessionable beer as the palate is clean after drinking. A historic brew and certainly worth the try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - this was enjoyable, reminded me of yuengling but with a very British flavor. Has a very bright, crisp, and refreshing flavor profile. Great refreshing beer, simple and straightforward but still very interesting."

"Overall: Delicious. An american classic that is a hybrid between an ale and lager, the unique brewing process (which is worth looking up for those who don't know what a Steam Beer is!!) gives the pleasing versatility of this beer. The northern brewer hops mix perfectly to give the woodsy, minty, and overall rustic hop flavor. A must try that can easily become an old standby, especially for cool fall nights."

""

"A true classic. I have had this one many times and find it to be a nice refreshing summer beer with more character than a macro lager and enough complexity to keep things from getting too dull over the course of a session. Pours a deep amber on the SRM scale and leaves a nice rich foam if you pour the beer correctly (although with this one I often dispense with the glass). Aroma is a sweet and spicy combo of bready spicy yeast and herbal notes with some sweet malt. Taste is where the magic is, sourdough yeast, cleansing spice like white pepper, some banana and vanilla esters... A nice sour tang with a decent biscuity crystal malt lingering sweetness on the palate. Drinkable but not dull. Might underwhelm those who love hop bombs as the Northern Brewer are there to provide grassiness and a bitter foil rather than complex hop aroma but keep an open mind. There is enough ale character in this hybrid style to keep one engaged."

"O: Great beer and uniquely its own. Would be great with some grilled chicken or other light BBQ food."
""
""
"Initially, it seemed not to be a big deal, but then it kind of grew on me for its unique taste. Though it resembles some British bitters. I could have drunk a few, very drinkable. Definitely worth it a try. I round it up given its historic twist."

"Anchor Steam pours a darker clear amber color with a nice large lacing head. There is a weak aroma, but has bitter and floral notes. The taste is a bit bitter, and has long drawn out floral notes. A bit watery, but nice flavors, easy to drink. Overall a solid beer."

"7/23 revisited. Have a new appreciation for this brew, great creamy, biscuit, nutty malt flavors, crisp and refreshing."

""

""
""
"This beer has a classic and clean taste that is enjoyable to say the least. The hops are soft yet bitter and drinks like a lazy afternoon. Friendly and approachable. Would pair well with black bean burgers and would compliment a variety of vegetarian dishes. Would also go well with spicy foods like chili or sweetly smoky foods like barbecue. It's versatile."

"Drinkability- I have had this beer so much but never reviewed it until now. It is a very good beer and a great session beer."

"Just know this. Anchor Steam is a true American classic. It's everything Anchor intended it to be, and anyone that appreciates good beer should have one every once in a while to remind themselves of where the movement began (I know this isn't literally the first ""craft"" beer. Just one of the progenitors.)"
"It comes across as damning with faint praise, I know, but there you are. It's not a bad beer by any means, just to my mind rather overhyped (and overpriced, to be honest). What it really is, when all is said and done, is a solid session beer, not that far removed from Boston Lager. Folk who've drank a lot of Sam Adams and have never tried this really should, they'd probably like it a lot."

"355ml bottle. ap: amber, short-lived head. sm: herbal hop. ta: medium sweetness and bitterness, minty. mo: light med body, oily texture. ov: full-flavoured, prickly carbonation. A beer that I okay, not good or bad. Best before date unreadable on label."
"Tried this beer at Lombard's Restaurant at Universal Studios Florida. Was very pleasantly surprised to enjoy a good micro-brew at the theme park. Great taste with no bitterness. Paired it with the Turkey burger and calamari appetizer. I will have to find this one again."

"I poured this into a pilsner glass and it looked very enticing with a big head and a lot of bright orange bubbling action. The smell was a little citrusy and a hint of pepper but the taste reminded me of eating soap, as did the mouthfeel. Maybe I'm just not a steam beer kinda guy but be that as it may, I didn't like this beer."

"Poured into imperial pokal. Golden amber with a thick fluffy white head that collapses to a thick layer of foam and then sits. Smells a bit soapy, crackery and malty. Taste is crisp and clean, with crackery buttery malts and a slight hop twang to snip off the aftertaste. A delicious session beer, this would be great with a picnic or after doing yardwork in the hot sun."

"On tap at Comstock Saloon in North Beach. I've had it in the bottle in San Francisco as well and I just find this to be uninspired and not very drinkable, regardless of it's glorious history. It was more respected in the 70s when there were so few interesting beers to compare it to."

"Appearance is amber, but who really cares about the color of the beer so much when men can't differentiate between colors very well. My apologies to the women. The smell is impressive though. It's nutty, caramel and has notes of ripe banana esters. The taste has notes of vanilla and some nutty tones, but it is balanced by a hop finish, balanced and appetizing. Mouthfeel is medium to medium full. Overall, this beer is a high quality low alcohol beer and is great for people who love their malty taste and low alcohol percentage. It seems to catch up to all of us in the end."

"The color is very rich, a copper color. This beer retains the head very well.a nice earthy smell. The slight piney smell certainly comes through. This is a pretty smooth drink with just a hint of aftertaste. I can see this being a sit around and drink a few with friends kind of beer."

"The color is light cooper, with a slight off-white, bubbly neck that retains well. The body is clear, and emanates caramel very strongly, as well as earthy and piney tones. The light body brings caramel/toast nodes, with apparent hops. You can notice a discrete fruitness in the background (mango, bananas). The finish is strong, exposing so well the hops... It's a good Lager, with a more malty profile, and a slight background fruitness. Great beer - I like it!"
""
"One of my all time favorite beer!"
""
""
""

"Easy drinker; relaxed, mild, and highly quaffable. Nothing tremendous in terms of flavor or aroma, but then again, nothing off-putting or offensive, either. I respect the originality of the style but I think I prefer ""Steamy Windows"" from Liberty Street over this one, despite its history as the precedent-setter."

"O - Solid beer that really embodies what a pilsner should be. I would say with this beer there is nothing 'new' about it. They set out to make a really solid beer and they did just that."

""

"Drinkability: Well this was my first California Common, and I wasn't really sure what to expect. Overall, I think that it is a nice drop, one that would go with a lot of different styles of cuisine, but I'm not sure if I would buy it to savour on its own merits."

"Summary - Anchor Steam is really a great beer. It's hard to explain, but it is just so smooth and balanced and drinkable. There is just the right amount of hops and sweetness. Possibly one of my favorites."
""
"Poured into a standard shaker from the bottle on 4/5/13. The color is a nice bronzed amber color with deep orange hues to it. It has a very active head of off-white bubbles and promises to be pretty active on the tongue. I've recently become a fan of the Northern Brewer hops and they definitely work well on the nose of this beer. The beer is very much full on malt and caramel with that distinctive lager yeast smell of fresh baked bread. The Northern Brewer hops play well to the background with good woodsy and minty smell to the background. The taste is fairly mild, but like expected, very active. It's a good malt and caramel backbone with that great scrubbing of the Northern Brewer hops giving that woodsy taste and a touch of lemon rind maybe to it. The mouthfeel is very full bodied and again, very active carbonation. This is a great session beer and very good overall. Without much surprise, it is the standard in my mind of a Steam Beer (I refuse to use California Common lol)."
""
""
""

"The Verdict: Not bad. I know it’s highly regarded by many, but it’s a bit too mild for my taste. I did enjoy it, but not enough to go looking for it."

I might suggest a cd by Bucky Pizzarelli called Challis in Wonderland where this guitar phenom sits in with some wonderful arrangement with a small string section performing some old great jazz pieces arranged by Challis who worked with Bix Beiderbecke. Another wise choice might be Hampton Hawes trio music."

"A beautiful copper brew with pillowy head and great retention. Hop-accented (Think: Flowers and mint) aroma with a biscuit and caramel backbone. Some high-alcohol notes are noticeable both in the nose and tongue with the former having a more dominating dried leaves and grain husk flavors with a bubblegum center. Angular and spritzy on the tongue the brew quickly placates to an almost uncarbonated, soapy medium bodied brew with assertive bitterness."

"Poured into an ale glass (yeah, yeah, yeah, it was sitting at my desk already,) developed a rich amber color, very clear, very small head. Nose is nice; rye, fruit, though hard to say what, maybe peach and lemon, a little fresh oregano, and yeast. Taste is fresh and bright, citrus notes (without the hop explosion that I've come to associate with it.) Finish is zesty, with lemon grass and fresh herbs riding it out. Mouthfeel is perfectly matched to the taste, light, spritzy, and bitter. The flavor and feel race across your tongue and disappear, enticing you to sip again. Overall, a well put together beer, and American styles are not usually my favorite territory. 4.25/5"

"I enjoyed the taste and flavor. Came in a bottle poured it ınto a glass. good color. it was my first west coast beer... had it a while ago while visiting in SF wish I could remember more. I Really liked the bottle. I thought it was fun and creative... had it in a pub somewhere in Ghiradelli square. :)"
"Bottle. Pretty darkish cobber amber with a medium creamy off white head. Lots of bubbles in the liquid. Aroma is malty, some barn and rye bread. Wonderful spritzy carbonation with lots of small bubbles. Flavor is sweet, caramel malty with a slight peppery bitterness. Nice and fresh - wonderful summer beer!"

"O - Low ABV, highly drinkable and perhaps one of my favorite lagers (or should I say steam beer!) that I move towards. Nothing to blow anyone's socks off, but for one looking for a well put together, upper-end brew, this is it."

"Anchor Steam Beer - The bottle says: ""Anchor Steam brand beer is virtually handmade with an exceptional respect for the ancient art of brewing. The deep amber color, thick creamy head, and the rich flavor all testify to our traditional brewing methods. Anchor Steam Beer derives its unusual name from the 19th century when ""steam"" seems to have been a nickname for beer brewed on the West Coast of American under primitive conditions and without ice. The word ""steam"" may have referred to the pressure of nature carbonation developing in the beers. Today the brewing methods of those days are a mystery, and for many decades Anchor alone has used the quaint name ""steam"" for its unique beer. Today Anchor is one of the smallest and most traditional breweries in the world. San Francisco's famous Anchor Steam brand beer is unique, for our brewing process has evolved over many decades and is like no other in the world."""

"The brew poured with a one finger white head that dissipated quickly and left no lacing on the glass. The body is a clear amber color with mild visible carbonation. The nose is really muted. And I mean muted to the point that I was sticking my face in the glass and couldn’t get much. I was really searching and got a slight hint of hops. The taste was boring at best. There was a crispness to it, which was the good part. Otherwise, I got some malt on it with a hint of hops. Wow this is just bland. It goes down easily but I think my qualm is more with the style. It’s just very boring to me. I could easily put a few back, but I really wouldn’t want to. Finish is quick and unremarkable. This one just wasn’t my cup of tea."
"It's an OK beer, though not amazing. From the stale background notes I'm wondering if this is old, though it's well within date. Decent malt character with an unusual yeast presence (like an English ale). No aromatic hops to be discerned. Goes down easily enough but just isn't that interesting. I wanted to like this more - perhaps I'll have another, fresher one some time."

"Anchor Steam Beer: A dark honey color beer with a good head. Lots of malt throughout, and tempered by some bitterness in the finish. Wet and dry at the same time. The finish is definitely unique. Worth a try if you have never sampled a steam beer. Better than most beers you find on tap at your average well. Still, I was not wowed enough to make it part of my standard favorite rotation beers."

"O: A crisp and refreshing, somewhat hoppy beer with a nice bit of fruity ester complexity."

"My first foray into the style, so I'm not sure if I'm undervaluing it. But I'm not particularly impressed. It's not especially tasty, or refreshing, or anything, really."
"355ml bottle. Pokal glass. Single brewer tasting session on agt´12. (Enjoyed many times in the past). Amber/Copper color. Chill haze. Off-white froth creates a rocky crown. Quickly dissipated head leaves a thin layer on top. Caramel & toasted malt aromas with citric hoppy hues. Flavors of malts, light sweetness & caramel. Light to medium body. High carbonation. Hop bitterness in the middle is covered by toasted malts. Smooth palate. Dry finish with some sweet, grainy & slightly citric notes."
""
"Side note: as this one warms, you can really get a sense of the grain in there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: It's not a very complex beer, but it does everything right. It's somehow quite sugary in texture, yet the hops gives it a nice light bitter kick. It's just a joy to drink and not one to over think ;)"
""
""
""
"It's got a nice grainy smell. A powerful hop bitterness up front that mellows out with excellent malts and a mild fruitiness. That's the simplest way of explaining it, but really you won't have any idea what to expect. It's a beer in a league of its own. Maybe it's not for everyone, but everyone needs to try it."
""
""
"Quite a nice full drinking beer, which shows a good complexity and flavour."
"Overall: This is always a nice easy drinker. Not too complex, but quite good."
"overall- Great beer but tastes like an Ale, This isn't the old Anchor Steam, Recently the brewers have added alot more color to this beer along with more hops. The old Anchor was much ligher in color with a lower hop level and a yeasty character. Is it better? I'm not so sure, this beer kind of tastes like a hopped up amber ale without that character. I like the older Anchor"
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Final Thoughts: This actually tastes like a hoppier version of the first home brew I ever made (Cream Ale) which makes it sort of unimpressive. However, it is a very cool hybrid of the ale and lager worlds and you can definitely taste both elements in here."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours clear copper with a tall, biege head that dissipates slowly. Some lacing is left behind on the glass. The aroma is of barley malt and some hops. There is a nice malty component to this beer in the taste. There is sweet up front with breadiness hitting at the middle. There is some hop bitterness on the back end with some aftertaste. The flavors are well-balanced. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is smooth and dry. The drinkability is very high. This is an excellent beer. I have to agree with a previous reviewer that this beer does remind me of an ESB."
""
"Really a new experience for me. It really does skirt the line between lager and west coast style ale... leaning more toward the lager profile, both flavor wise and smell wise."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I liked this beer a lot. It's very reminiscent of Fuller's ESB. Try it with fish and chips (excess carbonation is good at cutting through oils and fats)."

"Lovely stuff. Rich caramel balances a slightly unruly herbal hop flavor. Further warming brings out some sourdough bread crust, black pepper, and leafiness. A hint of fruit and yeastiness adds depth. Great, full mouthfeel especially considering the sub-5% ABV. An original American style and Anchor Steam pretty much defines it, what more do you want?"
""
""
""
""
"O/D-How have I not rated this before? I am sure I have had it before but it slipped through the cracks. I truly am not a fan of the style. This is the Big Daddy of Common Beers. It still isn't my thing."
"O: Glad to have finally tried this one. Well balanced and lives up to the hype."
""
"Poured from the bottle, this is what beer looks like. Its glowing amber color and thick (!) foamy head provide a backdrop for a soothing upward cascade of bubbles from the bottom of the glass. The malty but crisp aroma presents a nice combination of bready sweetness and mossy bitterness. The flavor likewise exhibits good depth while still being quite drinkable. The must hop profile is more pronounced over the malty base, and there is some tangy yeastiness to add further complexity. The beer is substantial on the tongue but smooth, which once again makes this one flavorful yet drinkable. Overall, there isn't anything here that isn't normally found in other beers, but this has some kind of character that makes it stand out."
""
"Pours a crystal clear amber/copper with a tightly knit head that dissipates quickly and doesn't leave the inside of the glass a ton of love. Smell is very lager-esque, grainy but simultaneously complex and very much inviting. Taste is refreshingly hoppy but not overbearing, and of lightly toasted malt. Feel is refreshingly crisp, but overall comes off a bit thin; however, definitely something to enjoy in sequence. Overall a great brew. . . got into the whole ""steam"" scene while on a trip to the Bay area, and this certainly exemplifies it."

"honestly i felt that while this beer was good it lacked any defining characteristics. the nose is kind of flat but the malt and hop balance is spot on, not to bitter not to malty or sweet. This is a good session beer because it does not leave any lingering taste but at the same time i feel that its constitution is fairly week. not bad but not great. pretty middle of the road."

"Pours a clear orange amber with nice carbonation, a small white head and lacing. Nice aroma of sweet wheat, lemon and earthy malt. Taste is sweet malt with a dry hoppy bitterness; finish is dry and hoppy. Light flavor, not all that complex. Skirts on the edge of tasting like adjunct ingredients, but overall nicely made if a bit simple. Carbonation and flavors combine pleasantly."
"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, bottled 1/11/2012. Pours slightly cloudy golden copper color with a very nice 3 finger dense off white head with incredible retention that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing on the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of bready grains, grass, floral hops, herbal spiciness, caramel, and a bit of light fruitiness. Some nice and well balanced aromas; but are a bit muted. Taste of bready grain, floral, grass, pepper, caramel, herbal, and light apricot. A decent amount of peppery bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of bread, pepper, herbal, floral, and light fruit on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of flavors. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a smooth and crisp mouthfeel as expected. No alcohol noticeable at all as expected for 4.9%. Overall this is a very nice brew from Anchor. Very crisp with a nice flavor profile; and easily drinkable. Definitely a great session beer contender."

"Pours translucent copper in color with a creamy off-white head that dissipates in short order. Aroma is mild and wheaty. Vigorous carbonation and a somewhat creamy mouthfeel are nice, but the taste is underwhelming. There's caramel malt and some wheat, a touch of hops... Tastes like beer. What else can I say? The balance isn't bad, but there's nothing in the flavor department that draws me in. The incredible rep that preceded this brew is a mystery to me, and I doubt that I could pick this out of a ineup of generic session beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and very singular. Carbonation is heavier than expected, and likely keeps the beer from bogging down, as I bet it would be much heavier if the carbonation were lighter. Slightly dry finish."

"Overall: B+/A-, easy drinker"

"Overall - This is a beer that anyone can enjoy, whether its the craft beer enthusiast or the casual yard beer drinker. It's simple in flavor, yet it tastes good enough that it can please just about anyone!"
""
"Pours amber with nice head retention, subtleness of an ale and smoothness of a lager."
""
""
""
""
"O - A standard for sure, and now I understand why. Not outstanding for any one particular reason. Outstanding because everything here is done well. Readily findable and not expensive. A perfect fallback beer, and something I plan on drinking plenty more times."
""
""
""
"O: Pretty easy to drink and probably the best known beer in the style - I probably had my first one of these about 15 years ago. There is a nice complexity to the flavor and the beer is quite easy to drink. Makes me think of being in San Fran."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice copper/amber color and formed a nice off-white head, that left some nice lace. The aroma was of malt and some hops. The flavor was of malt and hops with a slight citrus aspect. The finish was a touch astrigent, giving it a slight bitter aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark yellow with a slight head. Earthy aroma and earthy flavor. Some bitterness from the hops, some lemon zest hanging out, the malt hides underneath and never eager to hog the attention from his friendly neighbors. A crisp mouthfeel with a dry finish. A smooth drink, very easy to session, and an overall good beer."

"Overall – Paired with the chowder, this was a winner. An easy to quaff, slightly sweet overall beer that can quench your thirst. A solid beer though one I most likely won’t have again unless in the area."

""

"Pours a deep copper color with vibrant clarity and lots of visible carbonation. Shallow off white head. Lots of caramel malt on the nose with subtle notes of biscuit and grain. Some earthy scents with a subtle hop presence. Medium to big in body with a good malt foundation. Lots of carbonation dry bready characteristics up front with touches of caramel sweetness balanced by a crisp finish. Definately tasty and more than drinkable. Slight floral presence. Big for a small beer that holds up really well. I love the unique twist of this beer being a lager fermented at warmer temperatures. I dont get a lot of fruit but you definately get that ale/lager hybrid feel."

"possibly my favorite easy drinking ale on the market. pours a deep copper color with a welcomed 2 inch white head. smell is primarily malt based, not heavy, with some bitter and citrus hop fragrances. smells like a beer the revolutionaries would have been drinking in boston back in the day, it just has that important timeless nobility in its nose. flavor is amazingly well balanced, with more hops in the finish than the nose gave away. mouthfeel is nice and smooth. its down easy, but not in a throwaway sense, it is very enjoyable and every sip can be a pleasurable experience. great carbonation and a medium body. im happy to drink this all day everyday. it goes well with a lot of food, is reasonably affordable, and is interesting enough to old my attention. i am always excited to see it on shelves back east. this has been one of my go to beers for years."

"This is a slightly cloudy amber colored beer. The head is off-white that holds decently. Smells slightly like caramel with hints of bread and grains. Tastes similar to the aroma tasting very bready and grainy. A very balanced beer with earthy qualities."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A great beer. Very earthy and easy to take in. I think this one would be very approachable to a non-craft beer drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very good, this isn't a huge seller in my area but that leaves more for me. Excellent beer to sit down and enjoy a couple per sitting."
"O: excellent choice as a session beer or replacement for one of any light or macro-adjunct beer. Slightly milder than an average APA, but with as much flavor. Should work well with many lighter-flavored foods."
""
""
""
"Overall: Its a great little beer and there is nothing else quite like it. Right smack in between a lager and an ale. This classic brew will always be a good choice."
"O- A very nice beer. I prefer more intense ales, porters and stouts, and this is far from the best beer I've had, but this is definitely a beer I want on hand."
""
""
"Now to attempt to make an imperial version..."

"Poured from a bottle and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazy, slow bubbling orange-copper coloring that has a thin, filmy, white head of very low profile. Aromas are very well blended, with a caramel malt presence and roasted characteristics. Flavors showcase a more tangy malt presence, with a good hops bitterness to balance from the background. The roasty character and the peppery spices from the hops are great accents to the malty backbone of the beer. Smooth bodied, with a crispness to the finish from the hops. The aftertaste is a good blend of the malt sweetness and the roasty notes. Very well balanced beer, and insanely easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a unique brew, very complex yet everything balances nicely. Could definitely be a top pick session beer for me as it is very drinkable, bot too bitter, and not to malty or sweet. Very good beer!"
""
"O: its not one of the greatest beers out there, but I`ll probably come back to it just to re-review"
"It's just one of the best all-around beers, period."

"I'll need to try again because there is no way this beer is as famous and world renowned as it is if it tastes as I had it. I was hoping by being in the hometown it would result in an above par experience but that was not the case."
"Medium carbonation, medium body an enjoyable drink!"
""
""
""
""

"My favourite element of the beer is its taste; well balanced and robust, sweet caramelized malts with a hint of hop bitterness."
"Anchor Brewing was purchased in the 1975 by Fritz Maytag, and helped revitalize regional brewing in the US, a precursor to the craft explosion we get to enjoy today. Anchor's flagship brew is Anchor Steam, which falls into the California Common style category, a hybrid by the use of lager yeast at warmer then usual temperatures. This beer pours slightly orange with flashes of amber, a frothy head that provides good lacing throughout. Bready malty tones are first observed, with slight yeastiness poking through as the beer warms, simple and pleasant. Again the bready malt meets with hints of yeasty flavors, while the brew shows a moderate level of bitterness, slight citrus notes from the hops that all lead into a clean, crisp finish. A light to medium body is met with a good level of carbonation. A GREAT example of this style."

"O: Very refreshing. Classic style. I will definitely try more during the summer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Having known nothing about this beer before I bought it, I'd say it was a pretty good beer. The California Common/Steam Beer genre may not necessarily be my cup o' tea, but this is a tasty and refreshing beer nonetheless, one that I would certainly recommend for both an experienced craft brew drinker or a relative newcomer alike."
"Its got a little more carbonation that I like, just the right viscosity. Definitely a session beer, could easily put a couple of these down without getting tired of them."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This was one of the first ""good"" beers I had every had way back in the day. I think I am likely not along in that. This beer style made ""california common"" a house hold name due to the fact that no one else is allowed to claim steam beer. Although not overly complex, I appreciate this beer for what it is an amazing drinkable beer, a timeless classic, a craft beer when no one knew what that meant. Someone had purchased this for me as a gift and I was happy to drink it for the first time in a very long time."

"This is a pioneer that helped to fire off the craft beer revolution. I used to buy this at the Food Giant in Wallingford, and always looked forward to the nice bitterness and flavor that put it in a different class from the commonly available beers. I haven't had any in years, so when I got a bottle as a gift, I was looking forward to a good nostalgic taste, and I am not disappointed. I could drink this all night while watching good movies or cartoons, and know that the evening was well spent. For you folks that want to look into the world of alternative beer, this is just about the best place to start. Decent bitterness without a strong skunky malt smell or flavor, and one swig leaves you wishing for another. Many thanks to the guy who got this distributed up here in the cloudy zone back in the 70's."

"From the bottle marked 1SL. Sampled on Christmas Day 2011. It pours a medium amber with a small head that becomes a ring while leaving a decent lacing. The aroma is of barley, biscuit, and sweetness with a nice hoppy balance. The body falls into the medium range. The taste has a moderate bitterness and a clean finish."
""
""
""
"I've had a few different breweries version of this beer ""Steam"" or ""california common"" as some call it. I tend to enjoy the ones that are a little more biscuity and have more hop aroma. This one is a little less of those 2 features but a very enjoyable beer, easy to drink."

""
""
"O: pretty good above average lighter ale, not overly complex and thus very approachable. Would recommend."
""
""
"O: This is pretty damn good, and like many of the well-known craft beers (SN Pale Ale, SA Boston Lager), has a good degree of versatility, as well. On the other hand, it's not my favorite, and truth be told, I think I prefer Flying Dog Old Scratch (if we're staying in the not-too-well represented style of the California Common) overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: I can see why this beer made it big. I can appreciate the approach-ability of the beer. It's just mediocre to me."

"It's a completely different beer than what the smell suggests. The malt is definitely the most salient flavor - semi-sweet and very bready, almost musty. The hops are also pretty prominent and intertwoven with the other flavors. They're present from start to end. Finishes dry with a grainy, slightly bitter aftertaste."
""
"Overall: Perhaps one of the best easily obtainable beers. When it's time to splurge (money-wise) a little, Anchor Steam is always considered. Highly recommended."

"O: Truly one of a kind, this beer has an X-factor that reminds me a lot of Orval. Rich in flavor, yet relatively simple and refreshing."

"O- i did not enjoy this beer. maybe because i was expecting something different. i doubt ill buy it again but there may be some that will like this style. tastes like all the other beers out there i used to drink before i got into craft brew. i kinda feel like i would of enjoyed it more from the bottle perhaps."
"This is something I would drink again and recommend to others and have with rich fatty foods to cut the hoppiness down."
"Many years and beers have passed ever since and although it’s never been a favorite of mine it’s a damn good lager that I enjoy occasionally."
"The mouthfeel is medium/thin with just enough carbonation (could be the glass)."
"O-Better than the SN Beer Camp, but still nothing there that wows me or would keep me coming back."
"Overall Drinkability - This is the grandaddy of Steam Beers, so it almost can't get a bad grade here since I'm rating by style. It's somewhat enjoyable but despite even my infatuation with the city of San Francisco, I cannot convince myself to say this is a particularly good beer. Good in style, perhaps, but overall I don't find it all that special. Except for the fact that I first had this beer on my honeymoon in SF. But even nostalgia can't sway me here."
"O - A pretty decent beer, which one would expect from a signature beer like this. My only dislike is a sourness that seems to stick through the aftertaste. Still, a nice flavor that flows with the feel well."
"Overall this is a decent flagship beer from Anchor. I'm anxious to see what else they have."
"O: This is a very good beer and if you have the opportunity to buy this beer (preferably on tap) then do so."
"Anchor Steam pours a bright copper with a nice but small white head. The aroma is light and slightly caramel malt, with a slight, fruity tinge. The flavor is nicely malty without being too sweet. There is a nice, bready, buscuity malt character. More caramel, and some slightly dark, raisiny fruitiness are balanced by a mild hop bitterness. Some mild herbal hops pop through in the finish. There is an odd, slightly sour, estery flavor in the finish."
"The flagship beer from an iconic brewery. This pours a autumn-straw burnt toast color with a generous amount of foam. Great nose, with a muted maltiness. I pick up a light malty sweetness with a bit of a dark biscuit on the taste. The effervescence keeps it light, with a crisp, dry finish. An old favorite and a classic standby."
"O: Quite surprised at how much I enjoyed this beer. I usually prefer dark/heavy beers, but this was satisfying. It has a very good flavor profile for a light beer. I happen to pick only one bottle, but I wish I got a 6-pack. I would recommend this to any beer drinker. I also see this appropriate for almost any drinking occasion. Cheers!!!"
"D: Beautifully balanced, flavourful, and very sessionable; it isn't hard to see why this one has such a fine reputation."
"Poured from a bottle. Copper color with a white head that mostly dissipates. Minimal lacing. Aroma was that of earthy notes and citrus. Tasted of funky wheat, malts and citrus. Light to light-medium in body with moderate carbonation. Drinkable, but I wouldn't have more than one once in awhile. Still a good beer!"
"Dark gold in appearance, slight cloud to this beer. The smell has a nice hop to it that is very close to the overall taste. Very clean mouthfeel, hits the mouth and leaves nicely. Will remind you of a Pale ale. The taste is nicely hopped and sits nice in the mouth. Overall we like this beer and find it very drinkable and one to have in the fridge. Will go with any type of bar food, we think some good wings."
"Overall: I would recommend this for anyone looking for a session beer that doesn't take a backseat in the flavor department. This will make my kegerator again in the future for sure."
"O: Definitely a good beer. There is a lot going on with it. This is one of the first beers to which I introduce my non-beer-loving friends."
"A great beer to sip on a warm Fall afternoon."
"O- I can't recall ever having Anchor Steam prior to this review, which surprised me, but regardless, this is a very enjoyable beer, which I will be sure to pick up again in the future. It's very well rounded beer and probably one of the tastiest lagers a person will find. It has shades of an English Ale, which is what I think is drawing me to it so well. Highly recommended!"
"Excellent refreshing brew."
"O: This beer had fantastic balance and I could see myself drinking this at any bbq anytime ever. Tasty!"
"O: cool style, I've never had it before. I love a complex lager, and the yeast gives some itneresting flavor. This is available all over and fairly delicious - recommended as a gateway beer at the very least."
"Overall a really great flavorful beer. Don't have too much experience with a California Common style beer but this seems to really fit the bill."
"Def a good choice."
"Cheers!"
"O: this is a highly drinkable brew that I often overlook. It is full over flavor and has a nice refreshing balance."
"O: A unique American lager. I’m really glad to see our country representing in the lager game, especially with a style all our own. Lager doesn’t mean “boring beer;” in fact, some of my absolute favorite beers are lagers (mostly German, though). Nice going, Anchor Steam – gotta love good beer with good history."
"D - As the prototype common/steam beer, I was pretty disappointed. Not a bad beer, but not what I was expecting."
"Pours a beautifully clear deep gold color with a three finger pillowy head. There are tons and tons of tiny bubbles rising to the top. Looks very nice in the glass. Smells of caramel, toasted malt, and grassy hops. Nothing wildly complex, but it smells good. The taste is mostly toasty and caramel malts. It finishes with pleasant grassy hops. Mouthfeel is light to medium and the carbonation is pretty high. This is one hell of a drinkable beer. Overall, incredible for the style. Light and refreshing, yet still maintains a rich flavor throughout. Highly recommended."
"Effortlessly drinkable yet hugely tasty and always welcome"
"(O) I really like this beer a lot. Has a really good flavor profile and it's crisp and refreshing. Definitely a quality crafted brew that's been holding steady for a really long time."
"This is some solid stuff. Highly refreshing and one of the most drinkable beers I have had in a while."
"O - I had never had a beer in this style before, and decided this was as good a beer as any to start on. I can see why it's been brewed for over 100 years."
"Overall this is a good beer and is a great ""go to"". It is very unique, but tastes great, is priced well, and not hard to find."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"O: Well balanced and refreshing--an easy session beer."
"O - Yep, it's a classic. Rich in flavour, handsome, sessionable, affordable. Great beer."
"Defines the style, so rating to style is almost redundant. Uniquely crafted session-able ale that immediately brings to mind foggy Summer mornings in The City. Not often craved, but when I'm in the mood for it, little else will do."
"O) Haven't had this in a while, and I have to say, this is a highly enjoyable brew, that is plenty easy to drink. I can see why this is an old reliable for many a craft beer drinker."
"O: Not my favorite style of beer, but a well done beer."
"O - Very drinkable old standby"
"This beer is often priced in the $13.50 range for a six pack in the NY area but if you do some looking you can find it for $11.99 some places. Kind of a lot but it's a more special beer than I remember."
"Cheers!"
"Fullish in body, quite well carbonated, somewhat scrubbing. It's been perhaps four years since I first had Anchor Steam, and I had no real memory of this beer. A bit muddled on the whole. Certainly not bad, but I'm not a huge fan."
"Good amount of carbonation; you really can taste it."
"This beer just hit all the right buttons for me tonight. Having previously enjoyed this on many occasions, I have tended to overlook this as it's readily available in a world of the elusive hunt and desire to seek out more limited or exciting beers. Not really overly complicated or vivid, but really well executed."
"Overall: An excellent drinking beer with wonderful mouthfeel, although I was expecting more flavor. On the whole, a good beer."
"O: I really liked this beer and could definitely knock a few in one night. First time I've used this word in a review: quaffable."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the look. The coloring was deep, rich, and dark, with a nice frame of a head. Where we lost points was in the adjuncty grain through the middle, which became harsh at times. Despite this, the licorice vibe as a primary source of sweetness was something that kept the drinker interested, and coming back for more."
"Copper-brown color with a small off-white head. Malty aroma, very bready and somewhat earthy.Very smooth and malty with muted hops. I do not know how some people pick out 10 different flavors in this beer - I do not find it that complex. Very drinkable though."
"O: An extremely drinkable beer, the classic in its style. I don't drink it often, but when I want it, its always there."
"It tastes good as well. The flavors were pretty light. It worked well for a warm summer afternoon."
"Final Thoughts: Good."
"O – Have not had an AS for years, what a fun rediscovery for me. Very good drinkability, and a very well rounded malt & hop profile brought a smile & memories my San Fran apt. A quality beer. 4"
"Similar to a blonde ale, this beer is sweeter, crystal malt combined with lager yeast, making is crisp and clean without any real hop profile beyond aroma."
"Overall- It was a good beer, not great, but good. The beer has a great balance. The sweetness is very consistent throughout the taste and provides a nice balance with that fruity ""zing"". Adding to the balance, the bitterness is more than I was expecting (in a good way). Because it has decent flavors, I may buy again if it went on sale. Otherwise nothing really stood out to write home about."
"Tangy and effervescent. A little cloudy in color and very refreshing with a little bitterness too boot. Used to see it regularly but not so much in my neck of the wood anymore. Gotta look for it. Makes the big houses taste like water by comparison. They make a great porter too!"
"Make sure you drink this thing at a lower temperature, warming really doesn’t do it any favors."
"O: This is a very enjoyable and balanced beer, with an extra smokey twist. I'll drink this as it is, or perhaps with smokey sausages. I want more!"
"Overall: Very drinkable. It has been too long since I had this beer. Defines the Steam Beer style."
"Overall. Nice. Tastes like what I would think adjunct brewers are going for. Too bad they're so cheap and don't make mainstream beer taste good like this."
"This is one of those beers that other beers of this style get compared too. I really enjoy this one and will always take one if offered, and will still buy on occasion."
"O- Not crazy about this one, but it's better than BMC products. Not recommended at this time."
"Poured a beautiful light amber color. Smell is incredibly sweet; malts, caramel and strong honey. Taste is extremely light, smooth and sweet with some balancing hop citrus zest and bitterness. An incredibly unique beer, as well as incredibly refreshing. There's a good reason why it's been such an influential, pioneering brew."
"O - Not a bad brew at all, very similar to an amber lager. With that being said not my first choice in the variety, but a craft classic and worth a a try."
"A true classic, a proto-craft beer if you will and really something worth revisiting after a long absence or a couple of times a week for sipping, either way you are in good company with this beer."
"Pours an amber color with a large off white head which has great retention. Smell is of bready / bisquity malts with a little hops. Feel is medium to light. The taste is pretty good, you get the wave of bisquit / bready matls up front with some hop bitterness at the end, its followed by a weird lingering after taste which is hard to describe, perhaps metallic. Overall this is a pretty tasty beer and one I'll get again."
"O: Just a great all around beer. It's one of the standard ""go to"" brews in our fridge. A solid example of the quality that comes from Anchor. Love this beer"
"Overall: A great simple beer. Crisp, clean, and easy to enjoy…just like us Californians."
"Great lager."
"T: There was actually a lot more to this beer than I expected to find. Smooth malts at first followed by some earthy hops and bready malts on the finish. There's a nice bitterness that you're left with on the finish that definitely keeps you coming back."
"Overall: A true standout classic amongst craft brewing. As an SF resident, I'm quite proud to call this our iconic flagship beer. I always take this over a pale ale any day due to its unique fruity and malty flavor!"
"Overall: I'd tried this one years ago and forgot the taste, but BA got me curious. What a nice surprise! I'd drink this one on a regular basis. Can't wait to try Anchor's Liberty Ale."
"Been wanting to try this one for quite a time now, and i recently got my hand on a bottle of it, I've tried ""Oslo Mikrobryggeri's"" steamer, and i don't really feel anchor steam beer reaches the same level, i was kind of disapointed."
"Good solid beer."
"Now this is one jim-dandy of a brew! This brew poured up a hazy copper-colored body with a wonderfully thick, off-white colored head with good retention and lacing effects on the glass. Aromas of malts, caramel, citrus fruits (lemons, and maybe some orange). Flavors of the same in a malty concoction that beckons you to take the next sip just as soon as you finish one. Medium-bodied, full-flavored with a dry finish and citrusy aftertaste."
"Overall, this is a very interesting type of lager. I'd certainly drink it again. It has the hoppiness that I like from pale ales with the nice malty flavours and crispness of a good lager."
"O: I have tried many California Commons and this is still by far the best one I've ever had."
"Overall, this is a good beer. The flavor profile is balanced and fairly complex. This is an enjoyable steam lager from the brewery that pioneered the style."
"Overall - THis is a good beer to drink in summer or to have on tap while enjoying some of your favorite seafood at a raw bar. Light and refreshing, nothing overpowering."
"O- I know this beer is very popular, and being a brewer, it is interesting to read about the techniques used in making this beer. However, this one just doesn't do it for me. Not a bad beer, but not one I would go out of my way to have again. I haven't had many Cal. Commons before, but I am told this is a good representation of the style though."
"Overall: Nice beer."
"It has been a while since I drank an Anchor Steam...I forgot how good it is! The color is a rich amber and clear. Decent white head that laced pretty well. There was not much to smell other than hints of malt and bread. The taste was good....definite malt base that was balanced neatly with hops. The beer had some body but was still light on the pallet. Mouthfeel was great...very easy to drink and had anice clean finish."
"12oz. bottle served in an American Pint at 53 degrees. Batch# 1YF indicated on the back label. Pours a translucent burnt-orange with a dense, 2.5 inch cream-colored head. Head eventually settles into a solid quarter inch cap, with some residual spots of lacing revealed as the brew recedes. Nose reveals noble hops aromatics and light, toasted malts. Taste follows nose - hops presence is not overpowering, but overwhelms the malt profile. There's also a faint citrus quality interspersed across the backbone and finish is not really bitter, but there is a slight floral/earthy character that lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation and just a kiss of acidity. I can't say that I've had many opportunities to try this style out, but I was a bit underwhelmed. I can see it pairing well with food, but there are other brews I would go to before seeking this one out again."
"This is just a very drinkable beer. There aren't a lot of prominent flavors that confront the palate, but it goes down so nicely. Smooth when it should be smooth, and crisp when it should be crisp. Just wish it wasn't so cost prohibitive for me to enjoy it regularly around here."
"O: Smooth drinker that goes down easy. Great example of the style, an American original. This is a must try beer."
"Solid lager here. Clean and crisp yet substantial taste profile. I guess this is a craft beer legend for a reason."
"Note: After further reading I see that ASB is technically a Lager. It is a Lager that tastes alot like an Ale, much like Kolsch is an Ale that tastes alot like a Lager. This fact only accentuates the unique greatness of this beer."
"One of my favorite beers, and a classic example of the California common style. Pours a deep amber/orange color and gives a nice white two finger head that slowly fades to some excellent lacing. Smell is of yeast, citrus, and a hint of earthy wood. Hoppy character is the nose for sure. Taste follows suit with some earthy hops, malts, and some citrus. Somewhat bitter aftertaste, in a good way. Mouthfeel is a little heavy, but not too much. This is an excellent brew, and a great way to get into the California common style."
"Nose hop soft and warm, a little wood mint too. The taste is hoppy but not excessively. It contains malt and slightly sweet, which gives an almost imperceptible hint of caramel. Beer pleasant, easy drinking and should deploy its full power enjoyed on a long beach in the state of California."
"D- Lighter than it should be given everything that's going on, but still quite a body. A real beer drinker's experience. Nicely balanced, very unique."
"Medium bodied with a slight creamy texture that adds fullness to the palate. Crisp floral hop presence up front that's only faintly dry and bitter. This is countered by the sweet malt and light fruit notes. Hints of caramel, biscuit, toffee, hazelnut and apricot. Well balanced and easy to drink. There is nothing outstanding about this beer but it's well crafted and sessionable."
"Comes out a deep orange red and gives off a grassy aroma. The taste starts crisp, builds a slight apple-y taste, and finishes with some piney hops which linger on the tongue and strengthen as the beer warms. Even though the head quickly disappears, there's enough carbonation that leave me burping for a while. While this is not a particularly strong brew, it's more complex than one might suspect."
"Won't be buying this again in stores but since tonight is 2$ draft night, I might spend another 6 bucks."
"Overall: Good, all the way around. I've never tried a California Common, but it's not a style I will shy away from in the future. Very nice."
"Standard for the California common, smooth and sessionable, but has much in common with any other amber lager. Its appearance stands out, never had such an impressive head on a lager before. There are other beers I'd rather session but if anyone asks for the style, this is the way to go."
"O: I like this beer. It is uncomplicated and straightforward, a little understated, and very refreshing. Every bit as good as I remember it from decades ago. I hope the new owners can keep it this way for years to come."
"I may have found a new favorite session beer; this was brilliant. Smooth, drinkable and surprisingly complex for what it is. There’s a reason they named the style after Anchor Steam."
"O- A great beer, definitely session worthy."
"Overall- Even though I have had many, many beers this is the first time I have had this one. Impressions are that this is an easy drinking beer if you want to have something in between boring and crazy. This would seem to me as a great beer to pair with any type of dinner. 4/5"
"Pours a nice orange amber with a thin white head. Mostly some light malts in the nose and I didn't detect much else going on. Flavors had a lot of malt and some orange citrus flavors. Crisp and bitter to the taste. some other rather fruity and nutty notes that I can't quite detect exactly what they are. A bit bubbly but not in a bad way."
"O - This is my favorite Cali common. The flavors are simple and it is extremely easy drinking. I am glad we are finally starting to see more Anchor products in our area."
"Nice beer, will have to get again."
"Tastes are bitter caramel, crusts, salt, finishing hops, sogginess, bread, pistachios, cornbread and yeast. Smells of caramel bitterness, more hops, stringy barley and weirdly enough, I know, brandy-esque booze. Available anywhere. One reason I rated this guy!"
"Overall, this beer is average. I don't think I'll buy it again. It's too sour/astringent."
"Overall, a beer that is the classic example of the style, but is not the end all."
"D-Very drinkable and my introduction to the style; a light but complex beer."
"Pours a dark reddish brown, chestnut, with a 1 finger head that laces around the glass quickly. Maple syrup on the smell, sweet malt, sugary much like a Bock. Sweet sugars on the tongue caramel, very grainy lager taste a tad bitter on the finish. The feel light and dry. Very enjoyable beer, has alot of good characteristics that are hybrid from other styles."
"Love the look, description on the bottle and would love to try it fresh. However it's a bit too mild for my regular tastes, especially at the price in Ontario."
"In a class of its own I'm very pleased with this beer and I will recommend it to others"
"Overall, this light to medium bodied beer is one of the great session brews to come out of the States. A classic all in it's own, this tasty brew is one for the ages."
"O: What can I say? It's Anchor Steam. It's phenomenally unique. This is one of my go-to beers pretty much anytime."
"Smells bready, metallic and a bit earthy. Flavor profile starts there, only more intense. Bitter to near astringency, which contributes to a bone dry finish. Raw and spicy. Ample carbonation fluffs it up to a fuller feel than anticipated. Mildly sweet, moderately toasty, exceedingly grainy. Nothing wrong with revisiting a classic now and then, nope."
"Very drinkable, would like to do a full session with these."
"I recommend this beer to anyone who would like to try steam-beer."
"Overall: A very tasty and rich brew."
"O- A classic craft beer. I wish more craft breweries would make a California Common beer for me to compare this to, but a very smooth drinking lager."
"12 ounce stubby bottle poured into a 10 ounce glass. It's been years - perhaps a decade even - since I last had the famous Anchor Steam Beer. Pouring it again, for the first time, and I'm struck by the loads upon loads of carbonation in the brew. The bubbles just go on for days. Upon further inspection, this beer is brilliantly clear, as you can easily read the label from behind the glass. A big frothy head bursts to the top of the brew, but recedes just as quickly. Color is darker than gold but not quite amber, settling in at a rusty orange. Smells of a light grain, almost like a pilsner. First taste is sweet, almost fruity, with a very sweet malt finish. This - this is not like I remember at all! Moderate bitterness in the finish, but not overpowering at all. Slightly sticky and relatively thick mouth feel, though the heavy carbonation helps to scrub the taste off your tongue as you drink it. As you continue to taste the malt becomes more and more pronounced, and it works in context with the yeast profile to create almost a jam and bread flavor. An underrated gem."
"O - if there is no other game in town then go for it but I probably would been better off with just a water."
"O: I'm a huge fan of this beer, it's one of the beers that prompted me to start exploring in my early days. It's kind of strange to come back to it, I think my palate has been irreversibly changed by the beers that I drank in the intervening years, but in many ways it's just as good as I remember."
"Pale copper colour, Light white head, no lacing to speak of here. Smell is malty, slight caramel and toffee, an earthy grainy note, slight hop bitterness in the nose. Taste is big malt, caramel, toffee, clean with a light bitter finish. Good mouthfeel, big carbonation but seems to not last on the palate, medium weight. Good overall brew, sessionable and nice for the season."
"Pours with a big, foamy head. Tons of suds. The beer itself is tea-colored with yellow highlights. Crisp, grassy aroma with some citrus undertones. Fresh grain mixed with creamy berry and citrus flavors, yeasty, with some slight hop bitterness. This is one complex beer."
"Overall: A delicious lager beer with enough character to be interesting."
"A fine beer from Anchor Brewing and is definitely worth a try."
"A classic, a big stepping stone in the craft beer world. Definitely has more going for it than your average American lager but not something I'd feel the need to pick up often."
"On tap. Pours a translucent mahogany color with a thin layer of head. Virtually no lacing. Aroma is of toasted malts, bread and slightly sweet. Taste is sweet toasted malts, and a slight hop bitterness. Has kind of a cereal taste to it. Thin and watery mouthfeel but its a crisp and refreshing easy drinking beer. Overall, this is one of the better warm weather beers and worth having often."
"D: an american craft classic that is super drinkable and showcases an american hop that isn't dominated by citrus."
"Overall a very nice beer and def one of the beers that got me into craft beer. I def have a soft spot for this one."
"O: A good, solid beer that is tasty, balanced, and refreshing. I feel like this will make a fantastic summer beer and a nice break from over-the-top IPAs."
"This is the beer that started the craft beer revolution in this country and it’s still going strong all of these years later. I hadn’t had this in a while and sitting down with a 22 oz helped me realize again how flavorful and just plain drinkable this can be when you sit down with it. 40 years later and still going strong, this beer is a winner."
"overall - i can see myself taking this one to every barbeque from now on. awesome stuff. seems quite sessionable."
"This is a good consistant brew. The pour is golden in color with a nice solid white head on top that beer a good lacing down the glass. The taste of this beer is pretty standard but yet has enough flavor to keep it interesting. Mostly hops and malts on the tongue. The smell is basically the same. Mouthfeel is easy going. A good social beer. I wise choice of the the main stream beers out there."
"Despite it's mediocre aroma, this beer really came out and shone for me. A classic American craft beer, the West Coast is proud."
"Pours a clear organ/copper color with an inch and a half of orange tinted white head. Leaves a decent amount of sticky lacing on the glass. Has a good malt smell right off the bat. Taste goes right along with the smell: sweet malty and grain flavors Taste has a bitter feel to it that balances with the sweet malt flavors well.. Has a medium body and a medium/ balanced amount of carbonation. A good refreshing brew from the west coast."
"Overall: I think this is actually a pretty good session beer. Simple in pretty much everything, which works really well. I think Anchor does the style more than justice and might actually pick up a six pack in the future."
"O - Very drinkable, pretty tasty, nothing bad, just not something that will be my go-to."
"Missravenblue: 4/5 (A)"
"D - overall, very enjoyable. It wasn't quite what I expected, but it was great and a beer that I would love to drink a few of. Overall, a very balanced, tasty beer that I will be going back to."
"This is the CA common flagship. It is a good beer that is lagery in quality but has the esters of an ale that really give it character."
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is easily drinkable but not watery."
"Overall, very nice sessionable brew. The nose and the finish are brilliant, making up for the slightly weak mid-palate."
"Overall a good refreshing tasty beer. Always a stand by in my fridge."
"Overall: I am a resident of the San Francisco bay area and am fascinated by this breweries long standing ability to brew unique session beers. I will definitely start adding anchor steam into my regular rotations."
"Overall, better than expected and a beer that I might pick up in the summer. Would go well with burgers and brats on the grill."
"O - Very balanced and drinkable, I could and certainly have had a number of these in a sitting. A great session beer no matter the occasion."
"Copper color with an overabundance of white foam. The aroma is kinda hoppy but bland. The taste has a tartness that I don't find appealing, like it's meant to be acidic instead of build character. The finish is tart leaving a somewhat nasty aftertaste. No me gusta. Drain pour."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This California Common beer is a nice dark amber color and it produces a thick creamy head. Head retention is good and it leaves nice lacing in the glass. The aroma is very nice, showcasing malt and hops. The beer has a nice medium body, malty backbone, and light amounts of citrus. This is the standard bearer for California Common or Steam Beer. This is one of the beers that saved beer in America. Anchor Steam is everything a craft beer should be!"
"Flavor is a crisp and fresh citrusy, balancing out the maltiness and grainy character. A very delicious lager, with a smooth and complex flavor profile."
"D - A very drinkable beer that would be as well suited for a hot summer day as it would a cool fall evening."
"O = This is a really good standard beer type of beer. A great tasting, easy drinking beer appropriate for just about any occasion."
"Again, crisp...and clean. Not a lot of aftertaste and what IS there is that perfume you get in the nose that is thrown off from the noble hops. One of the easiest drinking craft brews in the US, this is a classic and, at the risk of repeating myself, deserves respect for what it meant to the craft brew movement in this country. Fritz Westinghouse...I know you sold it, but you saved it. I love you man! Psst, that's not just the beer talking."
"*Plus my girl friend, not a beer geek, but a girl who none-the-less enjoys a good beer really likes this one."
"Theres more alcohol taste than you would expect with a sub 5% abv. A slight bitterness to balance the sweet taste of apple and wheat makes this beer great. I'll definitely buy it again!"
"Dr: Far too expensive in Ireland, but certainly worth a go."
"D: its everywhere, affordable and americana, of course I'll be getting it again. However those are not the only reasons as its a prety decent beer."
"This beer pours a clear orange amber color with a finger of foamy white head that leaves a fair amount of lacing as you drink it. The aroma has hints of malty sweetness and a little bit of earthy hops. The taste is similar, with the beer starting with a sweet malty flavor and some honey, and finishing with some earthy hop bitterness. Could use some additional citrus hop flavor to make it a little more complex. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth, with a slight amount of overcarbonation. Overall a good amber hybrid."
"Mouthfeel Is vey smooth and lightly carbonated. A body very easy to deal with and very easy to drink. A nice offering in the steam beer category. Tasty and easy going down, I'll have another one."
"Dark golden, a touch of amber, perhaps? Great white head, good retention and good amount of lace. Aroma is underwhelming, grain and whiff of spiciness, but everything is very muted. Taste a bit heartier than an average lager. Refreshing front with a nice amount of carbonation, some unroasted malt in the middle with an understated amount of bitterness. Popcorn after then finish."
"The CPJ"
"drinks very easily, an easy session beer with a very easily managable abv. this could be a pivotal beer in converting a BMC drinker to craft. i would come back to this, but IMHO, its only slightly better than say yuengling, but practically double the cost. however, i think every craft enthusiast should atleast try this once."
"D: Heavy drink-ability in terms of putting back a true bitter beer than most where the hops stands tall and fast. However the staleness of the beer would be hard to go back to if not just looking for ""beer"" to drink."
"Anchor Steam Beer is a wonderful quaff poured a crystal clear amber color. Served well chilled out of the fridge in a pint glass. Aromas were of citrus and piney hops in the nose and some caramel malts. The taste gives way to soft citrus and pine hops with a hint of caramel and a biscuity malt quality. A finely complex brew for the price."
"This one pours a nice clear amber out of the bottle. Well retained finger of foamy white head that leaves good lacing. Really clean looking and bright. Nose is really malty and sweet. Some notes of corn and cereal grain. Tastes corny and light. Kind of wet, like a slightly soggy bowl of cereal; pretty underwhelming I was expecting more. Otherwise goes down smooth. Overall pretty decent. Classic looks-better-than-it-tastes bber"
"A crisp malty citrus hops bite. Light caramel malt body with a well balanced citrus/grassy hops bite to finish. Doesn't finish too dry or bitter. Refreshing."
"D: The subtle adjunct tones detract from an otherwise simple and enjoyable experience."
"Pours a small one finger white head. Golden copper body. A slight ring of lacing remains. Smells of some earthy hops, carmel, toffee, burnt sugar. Tastes earthy, carmel sweetness, some piney bitterness. There is something off flavored in here that I can oly describe as metalic/tangy. Some mineral water taste and piney lingering bitterness on the finish. Medium light bodied, light carbonation. I could drink two or three of these."
"Pours a sunny copper with a huge fluffy white head. The aroma is sharp and tight and malty, with a little stink of herby hops. The flavor is malty, a little sweet and quite grainy - you can almost taste the spent grains from the mash - with a slight hop shimmer and a mild bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel is extremely smooth, and the beer finishes grassy and grainy and crisp."
"Drinkability is good, but I don't think I'll buy this again as i'm a bit bored with it, considering I can get a decent IPA at a cheaper price here in Texas. There's no way this should be priced more than any Sierra Nevada sixer."
"Iconic."
"Not bad, a solid B rating from me."
"D- very easy to drink... noting mind blowing but wouldn't mind drinking more for the price. Overall good for its style"
"I just tipped up the bottle & was disappointed to find it empty already. This was nice, I want another one. Nothing extreme (thankfully), but faultless. Looks like beer, smells like beer, tastes like beer, had no faults. What mmore can you ask? I'm off to buy some more right now."
"Notes: This is a very delightful beer, very good example of the style. Would of given this one a better rating but the smell and taste are just not very memorable."
"Drinkabilty: Taste light and refreshing, so quite drinkable. Certainly one I would choose if I saw it in a pub and I was in the mood for something light."
"D - Hard to get past the flavor. Perhaps this is the style...but I'm not much of a fan."
"A benchmark brew for all true beer lovers. Rich, complex, balanced, and rewarding. You get it all with this beer: hoppiness, maltiness, slight citrus, strong robust grain, medium-thick mouthfeel, great carbonation, smooth finish, sublime aftertaste, 5% ABV. What more can you say? It's as damn near perfect as a beer can be, and the quality has been consistent since I had my first one 20 years ago. Fantastic."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability went hand in hand, as the smoothness and dry clean finish lent itself well to both. Need to have more beers in this uncommon style, but good marks for this one."
"D-I'll be honest, this is on the same level as many BMC beers...even the light ones. I don't think I'll ever have another one of these."
"Overall, absolutely worth it..might have to be in the mood though."
"when tasting this and comparing it to all the mass produced pilsners, you can understand why this is so different. First, the color is a cloudy copper with a creamy white head. And there's actually some flavor to it! Maltiness with some bread notes and a hint of sour in the finish. Perhaps not a world-class beer, but it is certainly an American classic and gets bonus points for the history and revolution it helped to spawn."
"OVERALL GRADE: C+/B-"
"Drinkability - well balanced and fantastic tasting beer, wish i had more. will seek again and stock for future needs!"
"Anchor Steam Beer is a good beer. It's a little bitter than I would like. A cloudy Ale but that could be because it's steamed? I would recommend Anchor Steam Beer to my friends but I wouldn't buy it for a party or a get-together. Anyone who tries it wont be disappointed."
"reminds me of summer :)"
"Poured from tap as well as out of a 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a golden colour with a medium big white foamy head that settled down slowly in the glass. Aroma is grassy with some notes of malts and grain. The flavor is somewhat bitter, but not as bitter as most lagers. Flavour is grassy, notes of malts and hops. It has a short aftertaste. Overall a bit bland beer, but a quality session beer if there are no better choices."
"D: This tastes like a better, malt-heavy version of a macro lager."
"D: All around, this is a superb example of the style, and the definition of a good sessionable beer."
"tasted wonderful on one of the hottest days of the year. wonderful hoppy nose. The hops and malt are wonderfully balanced. I think something special happened when they decided to brew a lager at ale temps. The lager yeast is much cleaner than ale yeast. Just brewed a clone recipe of this. cant wait till it's ready."
"Drinkability: Despite the lack of foam and lacing (which again may be the glass - no way of knowing) I think I like this beer better on tap than in a bottle. Went very well with crab cakes, and I could easily put back another 16oz. A very drinkable and all-around good beer."
"Anchor steam is still solid just as I remember it. Inexpensive to boot too and easy drinking. Not the most knockout beer I've had, but certainly one that is worth its price and then some and easily available."
"D - A very drinkable beer, would definitely work well as a session drink."
"D: Nice session beer. If you want to go for taste but watch the ABV or calories (lol), this may be a good standard brew. Fine gateway beer for newbies."
"Verdict: If you've ever thought about trying a ""steam"" beer, this one is a definite good starter choice. Very drinkable and delicious, two of the most important characteristics of the perfect beer. If you find it, you should get it. A- (4.2)"
"D: A very different beer unlike any I've had before but it was quite enjoyable. It isn't too complex but that's what makes it so great. I could see myself easily picking up a 6-pack after trying this beer. It would be a great session beer."
"Drinkability - not extremely complex in taste but definitely unique. Definitely worth a six-pack to acclimate yourself to the taste."
"D - Low ABV, easy to drink outside of the heavy carbonation."
"Overall a nice beer. It is pretty much the quintessential California Common beer as it was pretty much the original. It is the style. But slowly forms of it are starting to emerge which is good. It's not an exceptional beer but it certainly is easy-drinking and when your looking for a couple lagers to drink one night or looking to get friends into craft beer, this may be the beer for you."
"All in all, I believe that I received an inferior example of this style due to storage and shipping. I'd love to try this beer fresh on tap in California as I've heard wonderful things. Highly sessionable, this brew probably could have been a winner."
"Drinkability: This is definitely a beer worth trying. It is Anchor's flagship beer and has by far the most reviews of any Steam beer. There is a fair amount going on here, especially for an American Lager at 4.9%."
"D - Very drinkable. A refreshing beer with a great taste."
"Mouthfeel was nice and because it was way lighter than expected, it was very easy to drink."
"Overall, good, but not outstanding."
"D- Pretty solid. Not going to say no to it and wouldn't say no to more than one or three."
"D - a complex and very drinkable brew, the flavour are interesting while being light and refreshing enough to be a great session option"
"I got this six-pack as a Christmas gift this year, and had not heard of it until then, so I didn't quite know what to expect. Turned out to be a great gift. Thanks, Tony."
"D: little to no alcohol flavor....very enjoyable on nice day"
"D: Enjoyable as it got warmer, cant taste the alcohol at all."
"This is definitely a real beer, a man's beer. A great beer for warm weather."
"Looking forward to having again sometime."
"I would describe this as a very drinkable beer which is session worthy. A tasty brew this is..."
"great drinkability. its strength come from it averageness. it doesn't overpower you. you can sip it or you can throw some back with friends. it's fairly common in stores, the price isn't really out of reach for most people. it's better than the macro brews, but not snobbish. you could give it to connoisseur and noob alike and both would be pleased."
"Notes: This is my first encounter with a beer of this style. it is easy to drink, enjoyable, and would not be a poor choice on a night out with friends. It looks and tastes like a typical American Amber. I'd probably have mistaken it for one if I hadn't any knowledge of it being something else. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but I wouldn't mind having another."
"Had this on-tap at Duarte's tavern in Pescadero, CA with Artichoke soup and sourdough bread...heavenly trio. This beer is absolutely wonderful on tap, creamy, smooth white 1 inch head sitting atop a light amber transparent body. Smells and tastes very inviting with the caramel-malt backbone complimented superbly by the fine cone hop bitterness to even things out. A wonderful beer and one of the best lighter USA brews I have ever had."
"M, D- Light bodied with a medium level of carbonation."
"poured a beautiful copper color with a nice frothy white head. With aromas of toasted malts with hints of citrus. The first drink reveals a soft bitternes with a bit of caramel sweetness. The carbonation is nice and makes this american classic easy to drink. only the price keeps me from drinking this one on a regular basis."
"D - Easily poundable with a good hop / malt balance with flavours that won't overload the palette. Highly recommended as a session beer and another quality offering from Anchor."
"taste also malty, citrusy. slight bitterness. good carbonation but found this sort of dull as a whole - much like other times i've tried it. average drinkability."
"D- This was a good beer that I didn't mind at all. In fact I thought it was a lot better than what I figured it was going to be. Anchor which is the grandfather of craft beer seems to still be in the game with this one. The ABV is low enough to kill a sixer of this and still be good."
"D-high, low ABV allows for a really high drinkability"
"Final Thoughts: Well, if you are on a boat with this stuff, I would suggest you follow the beer's namesake and pitch it overboard. It's like you found a treasure map, were overjoyed to a calm sea journey, only to toil through storms & pirates at great cost only to find that the treasure you found, didn't even cover the cost of the journey. Disappointing, although not unexpected I'd have to say. I knew Steam Beer had weird yeast so maybe it's just not the style for me. In conclusion, it won't leave you shanghaied, but don't expect smooth sailing so you'll want to pass."
"d: very smooth and very drinkable."
"D: Excellent beer. Easy to drink."
"A very nice lager, very drinkable. I will buy this beer again."
"Very well put together. It's different and I like it."
"After a disastrous bottle opening by my wife, I was left with roughly half of this great beer to savor....So, with what was left of the brew, it poured out a nice amber color, with a thick frothy and full white head with some pretty good lacing. It has a very unique aroma, a bit like seawater and malts mixed in with some grassy notes. Very crisp, refreshing taste as well, malty and sweet up front, sharp hop presence that hits the back of the palate, leaving just the right amount of bitterness on the tip of the tongue. With the medium-light body, low carbonation, and crisp characteristics of the beer, this is one easy drinking california common, my go to summer beer."
"D - I could definately session some of these. I could have gone for a deeper hop profile but this is a nice easy drinker."
"D: Always a good bet. I really like this godfather of craft brews. It won't stand up to something with more depth like a spectacular IPA or Trippel but it is really drinkable. I like this one as an introduction to what craft beer should be."
"D: A favorite of mine, tastes like no other beer I know, but still very drinkable, complex but not obscure"
"D: Very drinkable I remember why I wanted to brew this classic beauty now once more."
"D: Very drinkable. Smooth, flavorful and balanced. Sessionable ABV."
"RJT"
"Might be a beer that could turn a macro drinker towards better beer. It's different than any beer I've ever had, even though my description doesn't capture that very well. I would think all beer advocates would want to give it a try at least once."
"This is a very solid beer. Nice flavors and aromas going on. This is a very interesting style of beer."
"I could have a few of these no problem. Smooth light body beer goes down quite nicely."
"12 oz into a snifter. Pale ale color with a decent head. Wow, what a wonderful nose, just fantastic. It has that lager funk but the maltiness and hop balance of a pale ale. This beer is just so clean, it drinks well, preserving the lager yeast on the tongue but the pale ale qualities on the roof of the mouth, not as crisp as a lager, more gentle. Really a wonderful brew, the ""California Common"". My friend and I like to brew a similar brew to this in the fall, a pale ale with lager yeast, fermented at room temperature, and this was the beer that inspired us to take matters into our own hands (and to save some money). Great brew from Anchor, cheers."
"Always curious based on the high reviews, well deserved."
"D- Very, very drinkable. Light and crisp but not watery. Very well balanced. Toasty, bready front with a crisp floral hoppy finish, but it goes back to a sweet malt aftertaste."
"D: Good drinkability, but not something I have too often."
"D - This may be the perfect session brew; a terrific blend of malt flavors ... some dry, some sweet. Superbly crafted brew."
"12oz bottle. Amber hue with a small, short lived head. Aroma is sweet malt, ripe fruit with some nice hops presence. Medium body with piny hops fill the mouth with nice balance of fruit and biscuit malt. Long, dry, hoppy finish. Very interesting brew"
"Final Notes: One of the best session beers you could have. Low in alcohol, very drinkable, and tastes great."
"this beer speaks volumes before even trying it and then lives up to the expectations. yummy drinkable beer"
"D: Good drinkability. Lower ABV, good flavor and balance."
"D = Nice drinking beer. I could put a few of these away watching football, working outside, etc"
"D: All around a very solid beer. Unique yet familiar, Anchor Steam possess a nicely balanced kick of floral hops of sweet malts which don't overpower the palate. I could easily knock down a couple of these back to back during a night with friends. Solid, not stellar, but definitely recommended as a uniquely drinkable American classic."
"Anchor steam is a ol' standby, right up there with Sierra Pale Ale, Brooklyn Lager, HopDevil, etc... Like all Anchor beers, it is carefully brewed with great balance. Nice lacing in the glass, good use of pale malts and mild hop flavor. My default beer at Phils games."
"drinkability; easy enough to drink but it sits uncomfortable in my stomach and I don't feel like having another."
"Draft at Town Hall Tap. Poured into a pint glass a clear copper color with a slight 1 finger head of white. Very clean aroma with minimal notes of malt and grain. Slight cereal notes. Very clean flavor as well. Very easy drinking. Slight sweet start that last throughout. Minimal bitterness."
"A nice deep amber color That starts with a nice foamy head about one fingers worth. Has a little or no aroma that I could detect. It does have bitter beginning but then finishes smooth. Judging from Anchor Brewing Liberty Ale, which I really like a lot, I was a bit let down by this one. It's still pretty good and I would never turn one away."
"Pours golden / bronze. Nice lasting offwhite head. Aroma is sweet malt, caramel, hops. Taste is hops. sweet malty caramel. Palate is medium body, smooth and creamy, nice carbonation. Finishes sweet malt and caramel balanced by slightly bitter hops. Goes down smooth and easy. A very good and tasty brew."
"...Over all a good sipping beer but defiantly not something I would pick first, but there really wasn't much wrong with it, just not my personal favorite."
"Deep yellow with a reddish hue and perfect clarity. Poured with a thick foamy head with great retention. Pale malt and fruity aromas, apple and pear, with hints of hops and grass. Medium bodied and smooth with refreshing carbonation. Also has a dry feel that starts early and lasts through the finish. Sweet malty flavors combined with ripe apple and pear flavors and a lightly bitter dry finish."
"Drinkability -- Overall, quite pleasant. Clean, balanced, immensely drinkable. While not a true session beer, this one can This is the kind of beer that everybody can appreciate, craft lover or no."
"The beer pours a copper color with fizzy frothy white head. The smell is of hops and malt. It smells like a lager with some ale characteristics. The taste is sweet, almost grassy like, with hints of caramel. The mouthfeel is light, and I would consider this a very drinkable beer."
"Medium body. A nice session beer. Well balanced and easy to drink."
"Not sure what all the fuss about this beer is."
"Tastes bad, overpriced, no big f***in' deal."
"mouth feel smooth with lite carbination"
"I had anchor steam on-tap at a few places in San Francisco as well as in bottles. It was a clear amber color with not a lot of carbonation. It was light-medium bodied. Distinct taste and good drinkability. I can see why it's a popular beer on the west coast."
"Overall: Drinking this beer is always a pleasure. It is very balanced and very drinkable, with enough complexity to stand out over other ""drinkable"" beers. The fact that it is a lager but is fermented at ale temps and aged/conditioned in interesting ways definitely adds to the complexity. This is one of the few American styles of beer that doesn't just shove a mouthful of hops down your throat. That can be enjoyable, and there is a time and a place for it, but Anchor Steam is a very balanced beer that could stand up to any type of food and be enjoyed any time of year."
"i can throw these back like any good session beer"
"Overall: very good, well balanced and complex beer. I was impressed by the aroma that filled the room while the beer was being poured. My first Anchor and I really enjoy it. Shame it is so hard to find in Portugal."
"Tasty and worth a try. I'd like to try a fresher example toget more hop character."
"My first steam beer, the original steam beer - I like it, but not so much that I would choose it over a pale ale. I actually found the saltiness a little too much and wonder whether it is typical of other California Commons. Overall it was an interesting and worthwhile drinking experience, but probably not something I'd go back to."
"Not a bad brew to go to if in need, but not something I would seek out. Especially at almost $3 a bottle."
"Pours a clear bubbly straw amber, good head leaves no lacing. The nose is sweet, citrusy, floral, grass. Taste is straw, grain, malt, a sort of bland alcohol taste but a fuller flavour than any BMC beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly chewy. Drinkability is high and this would be quite sessionable at 4.8%. Also comes in a cool unique stubby bottle."
"light/medium bodied mouthfeel, clean, moderate carbonation. drinks pretty well, something easily sessioned."
"After a drought of California beers in Spain, I stumbled upon a case of this gem. Poured froma 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It gave me some memorable head, about 1.5 inches andlaced my glass. Nice clear dark golden appearance. Smell is subdued malts and light hops. Some bitterness, which is a good thing, and ale qualities. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and it is a oh so drinkable beer. Thank you, I believe I'll have another."
"Pours a transparent light brown to amber color with a dense 1"" head. The head sticks around for a while until it recedes to a foam on top of the beer. Aroma consists mostly of malt, with a little bit of sweetness and a floral note in there. The taste is also heavy on the malt, there is a bit of a caramel malt flavor and there is a bit of a roasted taste to it. Also, has a fairly clean finish that I like. Mouthfeel is medium with light carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer, the pinnacle of its style, but it isn't something that I enjoyed enough to seek out again."
"The drinkability may be this beer's strongest attribute. Though the price usually keeps me from actually doing it, it would be easy go through a sixer in a single night. Seeing as how this is one of the only good beers served at one of my favorite restaurants, I tend to drink my fair share of Anchor Steam."
"Good Red Ale. Has a copper color to it which leaves streaks as you drink. Has a pleasant taste with it's ripe flavor. Fairly impressed by the taste. A little fruity but not bad. I would recomend it. It's not the best beer to drink over and over but still worthy of high marks. This is the first Anchor beer that I remember drinking and it wasn't bad. It is possible that had it before but probably not somber enough to remember what it actually tasted like."
"It reminds me of a brown ale that is trying to be a pale ale but without the gusto....I'd like to try the liberty and hummer for comparison. Does the lower abv equate with a flatter taste?"
"Overall: Very interesting beer in terms of how the taste profiles transition and mesh together. Will definitely have again."
"First thing about this beer is its beautiful appearance in a glass. I love the amber color, and the off white color of the head is very nice, I just wish the head had stayed around a little longer. Nice malty smell not over powering. Tastes very smoothe, with a slight citus or hoppy finish. Very drinkable and enjoyable brew."
"This one poured a burnt orange in color with a billowing and soapy off white head. It's pretty translucent and is light bodied. The smell is lightly malty with little else, other than some slight sweetness to it. The taste is pretty solid. It's very malty and has some light caramel accent to it. It drinks pretty smoothly and is pretty light and well carbonated. The bubbling stayed active the entire time. It's pretty drinkable but I can't compare it to anything else from the style. I liked it for being a lighter beer but wouldn't necessarily go back."
"Having this one at my bud Ralph's house out here in San Diego. Poured with a giant foamy, frothy, sudsy, cream colored head, that lasts a while, good lacing, and lots of big bubble trails. Color is a clear orange amber. Aroma is burnt sugar, caramel, malt, minerals, and hop with a bit of fruit. Flavor's the same way. Body is good and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and of medium length. First started drinking this in the early 80s and it doesn't seem to have changed a bit. Great beer! Session."
"D - Very easy and enjoyable to drink. Would be excellent to session."
"I had fond memories of this from about 20 years ago when I first set out from home. But the truth is afte comparison to the many other choices out there this beer just isn't special to me anymore. Sorry, just telling the truth."
"D. A fairly low alcohol brew with some good body and nice malty aroma and flavor. This is a solid brew that I came back to every couple of months."
"Great session beer right here, Anchor Steam is an un-pretentious brew that tastes great."
"Pours a deep brown color with orange highlights and a thick yellowish colored head and great lacing. Smells of orange peel and vanilla, and some barley. Tastes of wonderful barley, orange peel, vanilla, and sweet malts. Mouthfeel is medium and very smooth. Drinkability is exceptional."
"This is a great beer. it was one of the best beers back in the 70's and is still one of the best. Kudos to Anchor for keeping the same great taste. It pours well, a nice clear amber with a nice creamy head. The aroma is sweet and hoppy. with a light to medium body. very crisp dry flavor. This beer never disappoints."
"This brew is very easy to quaff and is probably the best new lager style I've tried in a long time. The taste crisp, clean and well done and coupled with a solid mouthfeel, come together to create a pleasing beer. I don't know if all California Commons are like this, but Anchor Steam Beer has definitely set the bar high."
"It has a pretty simple taste with mostly biscuity flavors in the forefront. Its taste is over-all pretty light which isnt always a bad thing, as this beer is the example."
"A very drinkable brew - I would buy it again -"
"Pours a nice clear orange amber color with a finger of moderately evaporating ecru head. The aroma is of lime citrus as well as more of a corn syrupy smell along side of the general malty properties that are seen. The taste is both nice and rich in malt character. It is however quite abrasive in regards to the flavor. There is a lemon rind citrus flavor that provides both bitter and astringent properties to the flavor that I don't much care for. The mouthfeel is good as well as the beer is fairly good to drink once you are able to get past the astringent citrus. It's an interesting style. Not probably one of my favorites, but you can't argue with the inventors of the style so it's not all that bad."
"beautiful light coppery color with a nice very small bubbles head with a creamy smooth texture. A breadiness comes out in the taste. This is an easy drinking beer and well worth getting any time you can."
"All in all, this is a very good standard brew. Use this one as a standard for steam beers. This is very well balance. Worth trying at least once, despite availability."
"Pretty much the standard for the style. A classic."
"Drinkability: At 4.9 ABV and no palate stressing flavors, this a very drinkable beer!"
"Anchor Steam is a classic American beer that I am ashamed for not having reviewed sooner. Tonight, while dining with a friend at Bobby's Burger Palace, I decided I'd have the Anchor and drink it carefully. This steam beer has a nice woody, minty hop flavor and aroma. The finish is a little sweet with a light fruitiness."
"Overall an average beer I know anchor steam did a lot to start the craft beer movement but now this beer pales compared to many of the ""new"" craft breweries. A decent beer that I would drink again but it is just average."
"There is not much to the aroma - it had a faint hop smell. It had a good balance of hops and malt. The hops provided a good level of dryness and a slight bitter pine flavor. The malts lent a good caramel flavor, but were not too sweet. It had carbonation level was more on the softer side. I've had this beer a few times before, but I didn't think much of it other than thinking it was good. Overall this was a good beer and while I might not purchase a six pack I would defiantly have this at a bar."
"This pours a medium gold in the glass with a half-finger head that dissipates in time and no lacing to speak of. On the nose, it's very withdrawn and weak, maybe a slight dried fruit presence, but it's very weak. On the tongue it's an explosion of flavor compared to the nose, dates at the front, a deep sweetness followed by a lighter citrus on the back of the tongue, lingering for a long while. Truly one of the better tastes I've experienced, and a total shock after the weak nose. In the mouth it's a wide and shallow feel, quite carbonated and fuzzy on the extremities. It's almost too distinctive to drink one after another, but it would be decent for a few."
"Rich, thick, foamy head of just slightly off white. Two minutes it is calming down to a island in the middle of the field and a thick clinging lacing on the side of my glass. The rich color of amber, rating a 18 on the SRM Beer Color Chart. Piercing aroma of barley sweet malt and roasted wheat. Sharp and direct taste of lemon, chili, wheat, and green hops. Clean feeling on my tongue and a lingering finish of lime in by soft palate. Creamy and sharp needles of fluid on my gums, hard palate, tongue, soft palate and glottis. I have come to the conclusion that there are good beers and those that just try to make it in the world of beer drinkers. Most have little resources to buy good beer and accept the taste of mass produced mediocre beer as long as it gives them a buzz that helps them forget life's hardships. This beer is on a higher level, that delivers great flavor for a reasonable price. I will make every effort to introduce this fine beer to my friends at my next gathering."
"Drink - This is an excellent beer that is highly sessionable. Worth a try if you see it at the store/bar."
"Aroma is hoppy and lightly floral but gives way to faint grassy scents. The taste is malty sweet and pretty well balanced."
"D: Very sessionable and enjoyable. Absolutely worth a try."
"I cannot wait to try Anchor Steam on draft but I've yet to find any in the midwest that offer it."
"I'm a little surprised to see I've never reviewed this one before, always good for a 6 pack beside the river"
"Always a dependable selection for a day at sea, or just sitting around pool side with your first mate (or second). The historic popularity of this beer is easily fathomed. Anchor's away!"
"Cheers mateeys"
"It's refreshing, doesn't taste 'bad' and is of average alcohol. Depending on what you're doing, you could have several of these in a sitting and not feel to bad about things. There are other beers I'd rather have, but these would do in a pinch."
"Overall I was very impressed with this beer. I've seen it around for $9.99 + tax for a 6-pack so it's a good value for a very good lager."
"d- great, this is a solid beer with a great and true reputation. i pick this one up and drink it every once in awhile."
"I have no other experiences with Steam / California Common style beers, so my preferences may just be not geared towards the style rather than the Anchor Steam itself."
"D- I would definitely drink this beer again. It would appear to be a go to beer without a doubt. Easy to drink and quite enjoyable."
"A new style of beer for me, hope I will drink many more!"
"D-Very drinkable, this is one of my early favorites when I started drinking beer. It's not knocking my socks off now and I fear I've moved to more extreme styles leaving this solid winner behind. Definitely a beer I'd recommend to someone who doesn't normally think about good beer. Very accessible"
"D - Just great. The original steam beer sets the bar so dang high with this style nothing else really compairs. Wish a 6 pack was a bit cheaper than $10 so I could drink this all night long."
"D: Overall and excellent beer. In a word: BALANCE."
"Here we have a successful, unique brew. The fat bottle, the cute anchor and distinctive bottlecap, and amber look are all plusses. The extremely easy drink that still manages to hit you with spice and remind you that you're sipping a finely crafted beer not some alcoholic water. Multiple bottles don't numb the tongue to the wild work going on underneath here, but still the abv should be higher. Ahoy, steam boys!"
"enjoyed this beer wish he had a little more smell to it."
"Anchor Steam as I have been told, holds the patent on the Steam name, meaning all other beers of this style must go by the ""California Common"" label. The owner of Anchor, Fritz Maytag, is a legend in the brewing world and this beer stands as a ""gateway"" for many craft beer drinkers and will so for many years."
"One of my fallback beers. I wish it was available in more places around me. I'd love to try it on tap! Great beer!"
"Cheers!"
"A very easy drinking, mildy bitter beer. Nice smooth mellow flavors making a great session beer. It's nothing fancy, just a good honest, flavorful beer and the smooth carbonation really makes it for."
"D: it drank very good and went well with cajun calamari and some cajun gumbo; pretty decent."
"a classic!"
"D: Great for a specialty beer. Would go well with or without food, any time of day."
"D - With this balance of flavor and low ABV, very easy to drink."
"I only bought this to try a steam beer cant say ill buy it again its a solid brew really no flaws to it but its really nothing to seek out."
"D-Drinks easily enough. A good lawnmower beer."
"Anchor Steam has a clean copper yellow. A thick head tops off this beer. It's golden off white color laces the glass. Not much of a nose? This disappointing considering it's great appearance. It has some bitterness but all-in-all a very light beer. There is no after taste either. This is the most drinkable beer I have had from the Anchor Brewing Company, but it lacks in something to make it stand out against other beers."
"D- fairly easy to drink and has lots of flavor, I'm really surprised, the first anchor I had really turned me off but this one is definitely a winner"
"Pours a honey-amber with a bright white head that quickly dissipates. Smells of sweet malt and caramel. A very bready, sweet malt starts the beer off. Hints of honey and caramel as well. Toastyness too. Finishes with a minor rush of citrus hops and some more faint sweetness. Nothing big about the flavor. Very light bodied and highly carbonated."
"Decent mouthfeel with medium body and good carbonation. Ok drinkability, but the sweetness got to me after a while. Perhaps bottles are better?"
"D: Great palate cleansing scrubbing power due to a generous carbonation proved a great partner to a fully loaded mushroom cheeseburger."
"The beer pours and orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is grassy hops with some grapes and caramel malt. The flavor is toffee, grassy hops, grain and some metallic notes. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Good for the style, but this is a style I am not much of a fan of."
"Drinkability - This beer has a great texture, and great body. There is enough flavor to keep it from being boring. In fact, the finish leaves a taste in your mouth that reminds you that you just consumed a masterpiece. I am not sure what characterizes this style of beer and distinguishes it from other styles. I do know that it is really a great beer!"
"Poured this one into a tulip. Pours a deep amber honey kind of color with a big three finger off white head. Good sticky lacing all along the sides. The smell is nice. Although I'm having a little trouble pinpointing anything particular. Citrusy hops? Definitely some fruitiness to the nose but I just can't seem to articulate in my mind exactly what it is. The taste is a balance between some up front sweetness and some hop bittering at the end. I'm diggin' this and regret that I only bought a single. For me, the mouth feel is a bit strange. The carbonation is kind of low, and it seems to dry my mouth at the end. However this taste great and I could session this bad Larry all day. Great drinking and probably the best I could have chosen for an introduction to the style for me."
"Overall: A fantastic, refreshing, beautiful, and tasty beer. Grab a 6-pack and kickback on the porch for a bit."
"What a long strange trip it has been. Haven't had this SF original in years and finally got to cracking one open tonight. I know packaging isn't everything, especially in the world of craft beer, but this bottle (and quite possibly the SNPA bottle) really define the underlying character of craft beer for me. Okay, let's get to the nitty-gritty. The color is a nice copper with a dense pillow-like head that hangs out for a good while. Nose is full of earthy characters with a bit of lemon on the back end. Complementing the nose, the flavors on this one are primarily earthy in nature with a well-balanced malt profile and faint orange rind quality. The body is very pleasantly round while finishing pretty clean. I could go on describing this beer, but really it deserves to be drunk. Next time you're out grab a sixer of this classic. Nazdravi."
"The family resemblance to Liberty Ale is unmistakeable; though Anchor Steam of course doesn't have the forward hop character of Liberty Ale, they share a lovely mouthfeel and fruity character."
"Tried it on three seperate days to be fair. It seemed to get worse each time."
"Pours a copper color with a one finger head which gives way to some faint lacing. The aroma is of caramel malt roasted malt and a hint of green fruits. The taste has a nice deep malt backbone of caramel and roasted malts. The middle and backend of a nice little generic hop bite with hints of green fruits. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and a little dry. The drinkability is good, it is a solid beer, with nothing to make you dislike it, it is an easy drink with some nice flavor to it."
"I'm a little perplexed by this one. Lots of praise to be said. Gorgeous beer in the glass and a pleasing smell. I was impressed by the body for this type of beer. However, the damn thing tasted like soap, and the after taste was extremely bitter. I'm a big fan of huge IPAs and other very bitter brews, but this seemed extremely out of place and was not pleasant. A bad bottle? I have had Steam Anchor before and remembered it fondly, but I could barely get through this one. And I'm far from picky about different styles of beer."
"Poured into a standard pint glass, with a slightly off white head of about two fingers and a orangish-tan color. Smells of some citrus and bitter pine, with some malts as well. Taste is more malty and more piney with the citrus notes taking a back seat. Feel is crisp, with a fairly light body, very carbonated. Good overall beer nice feel, flavor and aroma."
"with an average body."
"Overall this was a nice beer. Poured a dark golden color with a white head about two inches that disippated fairly quickly. Smell is malt with a faint hops citrus smell. The taste is also malt with a faint hops flavor. Fairly bitter, but not overpoweringly so. Really a nice beer, and very nice after a hard days work. Enjoyable."
"One of my all time favorite beers. If you have never been to San Francisco to Pier 39, its worth the trip just to go to the Anchor Steam brewery. This is some of the best American beer on the market and criminally underrated. The smell, taste, and drinkability are second to none, and this is an enjoyable drinking beer, perfect for just about any occasion. Well rounded and not lacking. Very very close to brew perfection!"
"Overall: Fairly well balanced, caramel and pine dominates. Not overly impressed considering how much press this beer gets and high price tag. It is not refreshing enough to be an easy drinker and isn't complex enough to make me take notice."
"This is a very misleading beer. At first I was not entirely impressed as it seemed to be just another amber style beer. However, the subtle qualities of this beer are so nicely in balance it creates one heckuva drinkable beer."
"D - Finishes easy enough, and no reason not to enjoy more than one. Yet, it is a mild beer and one that left me wanting a bit more in the flavor dept."
"On a side note, I like using anchor brewing co. bottles for homebrewing, they have unique nice looking bottles."
"D/O- It's a classic, but I'm not digging it. This is by no means a bad beer. It's just not for me. Give it a try and decide for yourselves. Cheers."
"Overall: This beer is legendary, and arguably noted as being the beer that saved craft beer in America. Personally I find it hard to compare to others in the style (Because I haven't had any yet). Will need to do more research on the hop notes as they are the qualities that separate this beer from being a Pale Ale. This beer reminds me of drinking a Pale Ale."
"pour is like that of an unfiltered lager... bit on the amber side. mild head that seemed about right but not particularly impressive. nose of apricot citrus with a palate of a suprising amount of bitterness. interesting quality of malt and hops. quite herbal bitter with no quality of fruit outside of the nose."
"Easy-drinking and pleasant overall."
"Pours a clear amber color with a white head that leaves some lacing on the glass. Aroma of malt and earthy hops. The taste has caramel malt and some nice hoppy bitterness to it. Medium bodied with strong carbonation. Drinkability is ok but this not something I'd drink too many of at once. Overall it's a decent beer, but nothing amazing."
"D: It's a good enough beer, but not one I'd care to drink very often."
"D- Easily put down and a great pick for a session beer."
"D - Easy to drink and full of flavor, this is a great lager. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Smooth, creamy, and enjoyable. Will I miss you California? Maybe. Will I miss your beer? Sure, but I'll still be able to buy it."
"Taste is decidedly malty with toast and caramel leading the way. Plenty of floral bittering and a little bit of hop flavoring. Yeast is clean, but exhibits a touch of light fruit, maybe some red apples and pears. Freshness is paramount to this as some old Anchor Steam can get pretty hairy. Fresh, it is delightfully pleasant with the refreshing qualities of a lager blending nicely with the subtle complexities an ale yeast has to offer. Nice brew, and a good example of classic American craft beer."
"Overall a very nice balanced brew, along with a sneaky hop bite. I like it."
"D - Had 22oz at the hotel bar and enjoyed every last sip. If I didn't have to be somewhere I would have had another. Very enjoyable and glad that I finally got to give this one a try in it's home state."
"Pours a clear amber with a decent white head atop that diminishes quickly, leaving no cap, but a ring around the edge that doesn't lace. The aromas are muted with sweet malt and a light spicy hop aroma. The beer itself has a nice lightly sweet malt backbone with light bitterness and fruity esters, including apple. Strong carbonation couples well with the light drinking beer. A good beer to drink on a hot day after a bike ride and lawnmowing."
"Drinkability - 100% recommend. Anytime, Anywhere - if your a beer drinker, this is a must have/try. Loved it!"
"Taste, like they advertise, its what, a lager yeast made in an ale or vice versa. Light body, ample hopping for a flagship brew from back in the day. Just the right amount of sweetness. Mouthfeel allows one to pick up some of the complexities and what sets this beer apart from a standard APA. Great summer beer, sometimes a little cost prohibitive, and a well known folklore regarding the dickness of those affiliated with the brewery prevent many from enjoying the finished product more often."
"Obviously a beer of utmost importance for American craft brewing, Anchor Steam transcends it's historical value by being consistently great tasting and eminently drinkable."
"I'd drink it if it were the only thing on hand, but I don't exactly have high praise for this one."
"D- very good, this can be a exelent session for a hot summer night."
"Drinkability: A classic brew. You truly won't find another beer like this. That said, it is also quite tasty. This is one that everyone should try at least once."
"D: Good - goes down easy, but not too easy."
"It's been some time since Chumley's Passport thing introduced me to the Steam, so I figured I'd give it another go while CK is celebrating Fritz's wonderland of brewy goodness. It pours a clear copper-amber with a thumb of light off-white foam on top. The nose is primarily a humid melange of citrus and floral hoppy goodness, though a bit of medicinal/soapy notes stagnate in the background. Interestingly, the taste runs along these same lines, though the soap is gone, and there is an increased influence coming from the flowery and cirtusy hop elements and a very light twinge of caramel. The body is light, with active carbonation and a crsip, dry finish. It's all pretty straightforward, but nothing all that desirable. Can't fault the drinkability, though, as this guy is light and refreshing enough to warrant constant returns to the Steam room."
"Bottle poured a clear burnt orange, with a lovely frothy head with nice retention. Smell of sweet grains, hint of raisin. Flavors of caramel and malt is nicely balanced with somewhat bitter hops, but hops aren't real noticeable, they simply hold back the sugars and balance everything, providing a kind of dry finish. This is so unique and very good. I love this beer. It is very versitile. By that I mean it is hard to pigeonhole into a category. I think it could satisfy many different style palates. Very well made and a classic in my house. Thanks Wal-Mart for the fresh sixer."
"Drinkability/Final Thoughts: Very drinkable, though rather complex. It definitely deserves its fame as one of America's oldest craft-made brews and at a very reasonable price and high availability, I will definitely be revisiting this beer in the future."
"Drinkability is extremely high. These things go down very easy, almost too easy."
"This is a very drinkable beer, and one of the better lagers I have had thus far. Definitely something I could go back to as a unique session beer."
"Overall, Anchor Steam is a very full, and balanced beer. There isn't much to it, there isn't a challenge like the big brews, but this is definitely a refreshing, enjoyable brew."
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer suprisingly more than I thought I would. Thumbs up!"
"enjoy"
"Hard pour resulted in two finger off-white head, slow dissipation with nice lacing. Dark amber body with no visible carbonation. Nose features a big malt hit, not too sweet, great balance with minimal hop presence. Taste is unique to the style quite malt forward with some floral and grassy hop notes muted by big malt bill and lager yeast. Medium mouthfeel, not sticky, decent effervescence. A totally unique drinking experience which highlights the craft in craft brewing, a truly great session beer (as are all the beers in Anchor product line). No trip to SFO is complete without at least one of these iconic American brews. We all owe Fritz Maytag a big debt of gratitude for reviving the American brewing industry and this (un)Common style. Cheers, Fritz!"
"pours a hazy copper color with large head and lacing with lively carbonation. light hoppy bitter taste. good smooth beer but not much else to it. light body and thin texture. short flavor duration. nothing special, pretty average but a decent easy to attain beer."
"All in all, a very nice beer, and a true classic. Not my favorite style but it defines California Common beer. Anchor Steam also deserves to be commended for its focus in subtlety and balance--one can only with that more micros focused on the subtleties and delicate balance in great beer rather than going for over-the-top flavors."
"Not a bad beer, could knock a couple back, not a bad session choice. A good beer, would definitely have again"
"Anchor Steam is brewed with enough restraint (in both alcohol and flavor) and subtlety to be a highly quaffable beer. Also doesn't hurt to be an American classic."
"N-had this back when i was in my 20s and really appreciate it now in my 50s...this is a very drinkable and enjoyable beer.I enjoy trying all the different styles of beers and the""big"" brews.but this is quality in a bottle...its a keeper...even though its only 4.9 abv."
"Very good lager. Not heavy, refreshing, easy to drink, easy to like."
"Special thanks go out to Adam and Joel for this little number,it pours a light clearish amber hue with nice carbonation that leaves a creamy two finger head and heaps of lacing,the smell is a combination of aromas of maple syrup,light toffee,sweet honey and caramel,it has a pretty lightbodied mouthfeel to it almost close to carbonated water and exudes light tastes of honey,maple syrup and finishes with a dry caramel finish at the end and to be honest i gotta say its quite a bland taste for a brew that i expected and heard so much from and even though its very easy to knock back as a session brew it really doesnt have much substance to it all."
"Overall it's a solid beer, but all the hype seems a little unfounded. An ""A-"" from the Bros? This is a ""B" beer in my humble opinion."
"I didn't know what to expect when I bought this beer, but I am impressed. I would drink this over and over again. Now I'm gonna go pour two of these bad boys in my mug."
"D- I am very impressed by it's drink ability, I could drink this beer all the time, with that said I want to thank all my G's in Cali that steam there beer, west coast in the house!!!!"
"On tap at the brewery in San Francisco. Poured into a small 6 ounce fluted glass. Learned today that this beer is the only lager that Anchor makes. Also learned the various reasons this beer is called a steam beer and that nobody knows the truth for sure. Scoring bonus points for history, normally wouldn't do that but in some subconcious way, you can taste the history in the glass. A classic."
"Drinkability - I really like this beer. One of my favorites. Very nice. Another beer that I could drink during any season."
"D- A great, drinkable session beer. Not as sweet as expected- which is a good thing. A great beer to keep around."
"Price = $5.49 at Winberrie's"
"Medium bodied, with an appropriate level of carbonation. Really easy drinker. Nothing too exciting, but a true classic."
"Very nice & easy to drink."
"D: Definitely a quality brew and probably great for the style (my frame of reference is lacking) but not exactly thought provoking in my opinion. More interesting to me is the history/process of the style and how Anchor has the trademark rights to the ""Steam Beer"" style."
"I suppose this is the benchmark for the style, and quite a good one at that. This is a great beer, very refreshing, crisp, and just enough character, but nothing untraditional."
"D: Very drinkable, could easily have a few of these over the course of an afternoon."
"D: One of my favorite beers. To me, nothing quite tastes like this one. Highly drinkable and refreshing. Perfect to session or have with a meal."
"Very nice beer, hops are light but present as to not overpower the distinct 'steam' taste of the beer, nice malt backbone but once again is well balanced to bring out the fruity yeast flavors not normally found in a lager beer"
"This is easy to drink and fairly refreshing."
"D= Well Anchor got sold today so I decided to crack this one open... Pretty good beer. Nothing spectacular and amazing but it's the orgin of craft beer. Worth trying for the novelty alone."
"Feel/Drink: Light crisp mouthfeel. You can drink these guys all day."
"btw - I spent my first 4-5 years of drinking craft brew drinking it out of the bottle and when I finally got enough sense to start pouring it into a glass, a whole new damn world opened up! You should really only review beers that you've poured into a glass. It's not all the same."
"D: Very drinkable, this is certainly quite enjoyable and I would definitely have another."
"All considered, I would say its an above average beer. Quite drinkable. Would be nice to sip sitting on the porch on a warm day."
"Light to medium bodied with a slightly chewy, crisp mouthfeel."
"Extremely drinkable, this is a great session brew. you could break out a six pack of these puppies and drink them all evening long. This beer would go well with lunch and it doesn't have the abv to interfere with your day."
"Exceptional drinkability. Nothing too exciting, but still, it's a solid beer that goes down easily."
"D: Very drinkable, low abv and lightness of it would allow me to drink a 6 pack of these with ease."
"cheers!!"
"D: a great brew for the table of the tavern, anchor has made a name by brewing this original ale."
"Medium amber color, clean pour with a very smooth head which doesn't stick around. Smell is biscuity caramel malt with a bit of hops. Taste is complex, bitter and mildly citrus hops blended well with an unrefined/raw grain taste. Creamy taste and feel, very smooth despite the strong flavors of both hops and malt. Long-lasting taste, with a creamy grain taste lasting, while the hops and stronger grain taste come first. Very drinkable, but also very complex to focus on the beer itself, I am able to sit through a pint sipping it and thinking about each sip and the finish."
"D: It's very easy to drink and makes for a good session beer."
"Extremely drinkable, had a few more on the same night of review."
"Pours a light amber colour with a nice white head and lacing. I smell light hops and biscuit malt. The taste has a nice bitterness to it. I get some citrus hops with almost a bread flavour from the malt. Very smooth mouthfeel. I could drink many of these in a row. I don't often drink this, but when I do I always enjoy it."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D. Great drinkability. I would have no problem drinking the whole 6-pack tonight as I find this beer to be very delicious and very refreshing."
"D: Very drinkable, easy to finish off a six-pack in one night."
"D - Very, very drinkable. This is one of my go to beers for an all around great American craft brew. I think I might have a special place in my heart for Anchor Steam because it is brewed in SF (one of my favorite cities)."
"Drink: It has an interesting flavor, starts sweet and finishes dry. Nice to taste one, but you could easily have it for a session as well."
"D -- There's a reason this beer has been around as long as it has, it has a great, complex character, but doesn't overwhelm with too much -- it goes down nicely and leaves you wanting to try more."
"Nice and tasty, and a nice change from regular styles."
"Bold, but light enough that it can be drank in a session. It's hard for me to pin down this brew, but all I need to know is: it works."
"Nice drinking beer, but a bit sweet for me. Nice for sessions and BBQ."
"An interesting beverage. I keep picking it up occasionally, so that says something, doesn't it? I can think of worse ways to spend an afternoon than knocking a few of these back. Will definitely be trying to do Anchor Steamed muscles with it."
"This is a hugely drinkable beer. Just fresh, clean and simple. Why don't more people drink beer like this instead of BMC/MolsonLabattSleeman? I can't see this beer scaring anyone away, no matter how accustomed to that other BS."
"A decently made, fairly unremarkable beer. For all the fuss made about the way this beer is made, it doesn`t really deliver anything particularly special. Nice golden copper body with a soft head that fades quickly. Pleasant but maybe characterless nose of soft fruitiness. It`s significantly more bitter than I expected. A touch metallic in the finish. Not a bad beer but nothing to get excited about."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, I could drink this for hours and stay satisfied, without filling up."
"D: its quite drinkable since its a nice craft brew no flavors over power or anything like that so ya its drinkable"
"Drinkability is pretty damn good, could def enjoy this on a summer day. I'm glad I finally tried this micro classic."
"D - Very delicious and enjoyable beer."
"T & M - This opens smooth and malty with a very slight hint of honey followed by a hoppy bitterness in the finish that lingers briefly. This is not a rich tasting beer but the flavor is not thin either. Medium bodied with a persistent carbonation that bristles against the tongue."
"Finger plus of deep tan microfoam, dense even if not the best retention, thin but sticky streaks of lacing. Deep metallic copper color, slight haze only partially disturbs the transparency, lighter orange around the rims.Earthy, minerally nose with its own metallic veneer, apricots and oranges, smidge of caramel and honey glaze, hoppy florality, basically, though, the earthiness its best attribute. Medium-bodied with a big foamy attack that fills your mouth swiftly. This might serve the purpose of disguising some of the bitterness of the grassy hops and sour bread aspects. More minerally here than earthy, like quinine. Apricot, peach, apple fruit match up well with the bitter front, together with the lemon and orange citrus make it a balanced experience. Caramel salves the wounds at the end. These days it is getting tougher to give props to beers which don't strive for pyrotechnics, but this is a traditional winner which deserves its place at the table of champions."
"Drink: easily drinkable. A totally nice beer."
"From the bottle to a pint glass. Pours a very bright clear copper/amber color with a small white head. Pretty nice retention and leaves a little lacing on the glass. Smells earthy and fruity, a touch of caramel, citurs and kind of biscuity. A little hoppy mainly citrus hops I'd imagine. The taste is really refreshing. Citrus is the main thing I pick up as well as a bit of caramel. Kind of biscuity just like the smell as well. Kind of bitter but not bad, malty but it doesn't overpower anything. Nothing though really jumps out, to me seems pretty balanced and like I mentioned earlier refreshing. Pretty average mouthfeel nothing special there. Overall this one is pretty good. Pretty low ABV so having a few is no problem and I would gladly grab another. Definitely a classic and one of the beers that helped me turn to craft beer. I love to grab some of this once in a while and enjoy a few."
"I have finally tried this legend, on-tap no less. I have heard that this is the best way to get your Anchor Steam and someday I'll compare to the bottle. A great alternative to macro for that icy summer drink but I couldn't possibly justify the $12 six-packs here."
"2012: Had this again and enjoyed it quite a bit; the flavor is basic, but I'll bump it up a notch due to the extreme craftsmanship involved in making this beer as an American classic."
"Taste is crisp and sharp, a bit metallic but not too bad. Very easy to drink. Theres some nice hops and malt to it but very understated."
"More english bitter than lager. I can see where Sam Adams was modeled on this. Pretty MOR now, but must have been a lighting bolt back in the 70s."
"An overall outstanding beer, definitely one of my favorites that I'll buy over and over."
"This is so solid. Lower ABV brew, no flares or tricks, just well balanced & very tasty. I tend to overlook this on too often, but when I have it I'm reminded what a great, drinkable brew this is. Possibly my favorite session beer."
"An excellent, anytime kind of beer. It drinks super easy, is delicious, and is a staple in American craft brewing. Hoist one and enjoy it."
"D: High. Delicious beer. I'm definitely moving to USA! :p So that I can spend a barbecue evening enjoying all those refreshing and delicious beers..."
"D-this is very easy going down and has some really nice flavors to it. a little too grainy for me and would have liked a smoother texture."
"Notes: Nothing outstanding about this beer but it is a solid everyday type of beer."
"Good work."
"D – A great beer in an understated sense."
"D- went down pretty well, not too bad a beer just to have after work as with my review"
"Darkish amber color with a 1 finger head that left little lacing. The smell is strong of spices, malt, and hops. I can sense the hops much better in the taste than the smell. Its a very nice bland of hops, spices, and malt. Pretty good mouthfeel and drinkability. Not a bad beer at all, definitely worth trying."
"I don't like this beer...it taste way too bitter and sour for my taste. It's really unflavorful and one of the worst beers that I have ever had. I tried to at least give it some sort of love since it's a California thing but I just couldn't do it. Sorry but it's just not the best thing that I have ever drank for sure..."
"A very well balanced beer with a flavor that has you looking for more. I could drink these all night."
"Dr. Yes, it's okay, but there are much better ones out there. (10/29/11 edit. It's very good stuff. Not life changing at this point...but it was 30 years ago.)"
"D- Not my style, but I could see myself picking up a 6'er of these when settling in for an all night game of cards with the boys."
"I love $2 Tuesdays. This is the best you can do if you gotta do beer there."
"very drinkable"
"Drinkability/Overall - A worthy beer."
"D: Nothing jumps out at me when I drink this brew, but there isn't really much to complain about either. A drinkable brew that pairs well with lots of different foods. I could use a little more mouthfeel, but other than that it's a respectable quaff."
"Solid carbonation buzz, strong in the mouth. Very drinkable, great beer."
"A good steam beer, the history is grand on this drinkable, smooth beer, another proud export of California - I'm continually surprised by how many places I see this beer and Sierra Nevada."
"This beer has a pretty good mouthfeel, although the carbonation is just a touch more than what I usually prefer. A very drinkable beer."
"drinkability is good"
"I bought this beer because of the unique way in which it is fermented. Maybe my expectations were somewhat askew, but my impressions of this beer are so so. I guess I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't say it knocked my socks off."
"D - Since this beer is not very common here I would try it again once sixers get more reasonable but until then drinkability is high."
"D- Drinkable as a amber beer gets with all to many reasons why its a good choice."
"Color is a deep woody one, a mix of red and brown. The aroma has a lot of spice to it as well as some hops. Taste was pretty good. The spices were there, as well as some hop and malt characteristics. I was surprised that this was only 4.9% ABV as it tasted stronger than that. Good beer if you need something to wake you up but not get you too loose."
"Poured from a stubby bottle with some code on back, I assume for freshness. Poured a golden amber color with a generous amount of head. Scents of sweetness from hops and malts prevail. A citrus like almost dry aftertaste prevails. Mouth feel is creamy and smooth. This could very easily be a session brew for me."
"Yet another beer I gave less than stellar scores but would buy it again. This would be my next top pick to take to a hot July BBQ. Seems like it would go great with that kind of food. Possibly it will grow on me."
"Overall: This beer smells rather like a good Czech Pilsner, and tastes rather like a good lager mixed with a bock, and somehow is none of the above. This is a true classic; the taste is something every beer enthusiast should know. Try this beer..."
"Aroma is mostly malt. Flavor has some hop balance buy is mostly malt and biscuit flavors. Mouthfeel us dry and bready. I easily drank three pints without getting tired of this one. Good enought to be called an American classic."
"Overall: Quite good. An enjoyable beer. Crisp and refreshing."
"[Edit] this beer improved a LOT when taken with some food, even some chips or something. The malt and sweet flavors came through and the bitterness reduced. I have changed my opinion of this beer (with food)."
"Raising a glass to the US Junior team, since they are too young to have one themselves. Well done boys, and all in due time."
"The bar I was at on New Years Eve was out of my regular and I hadn't had Anchor Steam beer in something like thirty years. So I had three of these straight from the bottle. I loved it and decided to buy a couple of bottles to later sample and review. I have to admit I preferred it straight from the bottle on New Years, although there where no doubt other factors involved. One thing for sure, I won't let another thirty years go by before I enjoy this old friend again."
"Poured from bottle into glass mug. Appearance: poured a beautiful, honey gold w/ many rising bubbles. Smell: pleasantly bready w/ touch of hops. Taste: cant pick out specific flavors but very good taste and just a small touch of hops in the finish. Mouthfeel: medium slightly creamy just to my liking. Drinkability: enjoyed it w/ chunks of smoked swiss for a great combo. Could drink 2 or 3 at a time, would be full after that. Very happy with this beer."
"get yo'self some now!"
"Cheers!"
"D: Easy to drink and low ABV. Very tasty and a San Francisco legend."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Not much head formation. Its a nice amber color with a little reddishness to it and a bit of cloudiness. The aroma is a nice, malty aroma with some woodiness (similar to a Scottish Ale). The taste is a little bitter up front and finishes very sweetly with a taste similar to the smell. Its pretty light in body and very drinkable and refreshing and would make a good session beer. Cheers."
"You can't go wrong with this beer .It is very drinkable with a full flavor not as much depth to to taste for some but it's classic .I have never had it on draft but I imagine it must make it even better."
"Value: You can buy a six of draff for about three bucks less, or ante up the extra few bucks for some excellent beer and get Anchor Steam. I know what I'd choose..."
"again, not necessarily my favorite style, but when it comes down to it.. I don't think there's much that could improve this beer. excellent work."
"12 oz bottle to glass. Pours a light amber, pretty dark for a lager. Smells like typical lager / Bud smell. On taste, really like the balance...full flavored, a bit like a Marzen or Oktoberfest. Carbonation was moderate, where I like it. Overall a really good, drinkable beer. All the Anchor's I've had I really enjoyed."
"I hadn't had one of these since before I really started to appreciate craft beer. I knew I'd liked it, but now I'm pretty it's an excellent session beer, and one I'll come back to as a stand-by from now on."
"Notes: This was my first steam beer. I guess this makes sense since this is apparently the original steam beer. I know this style combines elements of lagers and ales, but this beer definitely seemed like a hearty lager to me. In particular it seemed similar to an Octoberfest lager, which is not a bad thing at all. The next time I want a malty lagerish beer when its not October, I'll think of this."
"This is a fun, drinkable session beer. I prefer it on tap close to the brewery but it's still good in the bottle."
"D: very, would be great pizza beer, just need some pizza. glad i bought in a six pack and not a single."
"Frothy white head with quite a bit of staying power atop a golden orange/copper colored brew. This was one of my early forays into craft beer, and I still have a soft spot for it. Malt and earthy, floral hop scents. Taste is much of the same. It's a really nice balance between that initial crisp bite of hops and the not too sweet malt on the back end. Low ABV makes this very sessionable as well."
"Overall: I wasn't really sure what to expect with this one but it is definitely quenching. There isnt a distinct and unique flavor but rather a melody of grain that is traditional and non offensive."
"This beer vindicates the reputation light lagers have."
"$10.79 for a 6 @ local package store."
"Pours a hazy copper color with a full frothy off-white head. Good retention and lacing. Smell is of fresh whole gain bread with a earthy and floral hop presence. Taste brings what the scent dictated with the multigrain bread and earthy and floral hops up front but with a presence of carmel and fruit in the background. The only knock is the presence of a faint metallic and sulfry taste on the finnish. Medium bodied, fully carbonated. Very unique beer, hard pressed to find a beer with this flavor profile."
"D. This beer is extremely drinkable. It goes down easy. Low alcohol makes this a very sessionable beer. I hope to get a keg of this into my kegerator in the near future."
"Drinkability: It's pretty good. Certainly something I could get again."
"This is possibly the most balanced beer I have ever had. It is a great session beer, but is also satisfying enough to have just one."
"D- OH YEAH. Super drinkable... and as expected the ""clean crispness"" of a lager with the fruitiness of an ale. Just amazing... and it is also great to put an ultra classic like Anchor Steam to the lips... it's like drinking history!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, mildly carbonated, balanced, a tiny bit sweet, and very drinkable."
"Overall, a solid and unique beer. As I'm in Scotland at the moment, I have my reservations about the freshness of this beer, so I hope I can try it again stateside. Still, it's a beer everyone should try and I would gladly drink it again."
"I don't have too much experience with steam beers, but I know this is the most popular of the style with good reason."
"One bottle of a mixed sixer I received from my parents for my 26th birthday."
"Overall a nice and drinkable beer."
"D: Excellent. A true classic that provided one of my earliest exposures to craft beers back in the 90's. Worth every penny I paid for it."
"F: Finishes semi bitter but pretty dry. Semi light but pretty crisp finishing flavors, reminiscent of a nice lager. A slight spice and some slight earthy flavors linger a bit. The nice malty flavor fades nicely but leaves the nice bitterness, which also doesn't hang out for long. Pretty crisp and refreshing."
"Notes: It is a good brew and is a pleasure to have it around. But style purity and all, there isn´t much to rave about. It´s pleasant to be had but much of the hype and claim to originality pivots around how it represents steam beers, which in fact and thanks to them is legally a void style since they trademarked the term and all other brewers are legally banned from using the definition commercially. The fact that thanks to them beers of this particular craft have to be called ""California Common"" after they appropriated a piece of shared culture does not raise much sympathy from me and certainly does not add to the drinking experience."
"Crisp and grainy yet light and toasty. Light apple juice fruits balance an earthy bitter...ah steam beer. What I think of when I hear the generalized word ""beer."""
"Drinkability and mouthfeel: Crisp/lightly carbonated so it goes down smooth. Easy to enjoy on any occasion. A real testament to the craft brewing movement in america."
"D - Very enjoyable, but I'd recommend not having two of these in a row so that you don't deaden yourself to the taste."
"I've heard about how great this beer is for years. I waited until I got one free to try it. This is worth paying for. Dark gold boardering on red, big, thick dense rocky head. Clean, mallty, sweet, somewhat fruity nose. Nice sharp bite from the hops. More hoppy than I expected. Some grapefruit-citrus, then malty, yeasty finish. Pleasantly bitter aftertaste. This might not quite as great as some people have told me it was, but it's a very satisfying and drinkable well made brew."
"Drinkability: This is a fantastically easy beer to drink, and one of the closest examples of what I think a session beer should be. Low abv, delicious, not too strong, but very complex in a subtle way."
"Drinkability- Excellent, low ABV and unique taste makes this a great session beer. Leaves me wanting more."
"overall i was very suprised - i have many anchor steams through out the years and was never impressed but this bottle was great and kind of wish i would have bought a 6er instead of a single"
"This is a simple, unpretentious beer. It pours a clean copper color, acceptable head, moderate lacing. This beer smells earthy and slightly sweet. Some absolutley charming floral flavors with a delightful semi-sweet aftertaste. Very clean mouthfeel, very easy to drink. If not for the price (10$ for a six-pack), this would be a fantastic sessioner."
"One of my favorite West Coast beers, maybe because it does not push the hop envelope, but rather seeks a nice balance for a great drinkable lager. A nice clean bright pour settles to a darker copper with decent white head, some lace & good biting carbonation. The aroma hints at more floral hops than malt, whereas the flavor mates some clean bright hops with roasted malt in a good earthy way. Just a simply great all around refreshing beer."
"D- Very drinkable, great candidate for a session."
"Pours a deep amber color with a thick fluffy head that sticks around forever. Smells of earthy hops, a bit of toffee, and sweet grainy malt. The taste follows the aroma. Earthy hops and sweet malt with a long lingering mild hop bitterness in the finish. Medium body, creamy mouthfeel, crisp carbonation. I drank a lot of this beer in the mid nineties it was somewhat of a gateway beer for me. Delicious in its simplicity, yet interesting enough for my ever changing palette. Great session beer!"
"Drinkability is good. It goes down pretty easy and has a nice taste. I'd have a few more but its not something I'd go crazy for."
"This beer is one of the most unique lagers. I've never seen a beer with better head than this beer. It doesn't have a strong smell. As far as drinkability goes, you can drink this beer pretty much anywhere. If you're a fan of lagers, you have to give this a try."
"Very drinkable. When suggesting new beers for friends unfamiliar with craft brews, this guy is one of the first on the list."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a clear copper with a long lasting 2 finger white head. The aroma is earthy, bready with a bit of sweetness. The flavor is pleasantly bitter with a dry, bitter finish that lingers. The beer is medium bodied and IMO very sessionable. A great all around beer."
"Very tasty and complex beer."
"D - Fair drinkability. It's standard beer. Nothing special in my book."
"Drinkability: this is a very interesting beer to me which I like because it is different. I think it would pair great with something unctuous like salmon or fried whitefish."
"Very drinkable, one of my favorite tap offerings. This keg traveled particularly well. If it wasn't for the distance I would have this beer as often as I can."
"D: Not something that I would have on a regular basis. Not very complex and after one you have this style down."
"Taste: More complex than I was expecting. Some caramel, sulfur/minerals, medium bitterness."
"Drinkability: Obviously a very important beer in craft beer history that is quite good but is ultimately more relevant for its history. Nice to have every once in a while."
"This is a very tasty beer. After drinking a mix 6 pack of Anchor Brewing Company, this is probably my favorite. Pours a beautiful color- golden orange. Smells sweet and fruity. Tastes balanced and plentiful. Would be a good session beer. I'd buy again if it wasn't for the price."
"Feels great going down, and i could drink these forever. All in all, a great beer."
"Poured into a wheat beer glass, nice foamy offwhite head that lasted until the final sip, nice lacing. clear amber color with little earthy but no other noticable smells, the taste was mostly malt at the begining with a slightly hoppy wet finish, the mouthfeel is medium body with slight carbonation, a very smooth drinkable beer that is one I could have several of and not feel like I just had a meal."
"this is my lawnmower beer. not too light and reminds you that beer is supposed to taste good."
"Drinkability: I'm more of an IPA fan so this was a little to big in the malts to takedown but I could have one or two with a meal"
"This is a unique beer. I'm not much of a lager fan, but then other lagers are really nothing like this. This is very refreshing, and I plan to serve it soon at a barbeque, where I think it will go great with pork butt and hot weather."
"d: I have no idea what the ABV on this beer is, but I know that this is a beer that I wish was commonly on tap at my local bars!"
"Pours a straight up amber color that is transparent and has a one-two finger head that is just between creamy and fizzy, head retains for a bit and leaves no lacing, the only weak part of the appearance. Smell is the weakest aspect of this beer though, weak smell, can pick up malts, some hops and a pretty solid lager smell, nothing special but not bad in the least. Taste is good, great malt backbone to this one with a finish of some hoppy bitterness, overall a great lagery solid flavor. Mouthfeel is medium and a bit creamy, coats the mouth with a good aftertaste that leaves you wanting more. Drinkability is huge here, could get a keg of this and be very very happy, doesn't fill you up and the taste seems like it would not fade away after many of these."
"Not something I would order again, but glad I got a chance to try this legend of a beer."
"D: Very drinkable. At 4.9 it's got more than a bit of a punch, but the alcohol is well disguised. nice drinker here. (not me - the beer!)"
"Drinkability: a good clean all rounded lager. Very drinkable, its a very malty beer but avoids tasting cereal. Provides a good contrast with Dark fruit & citrus flavors and aromas. One of the most flavorful lagers I've had."
"Tasty and refreshing, Anchor Steam is simply a versatile, sturdy craft beer. You could pair it with just about anything, in my opinion. I put it up against some meunster cheese and they got along like old friends."
"Poured from a brown 12oz. bottle. Has a pretty amber color with a 1 1/2 inch head. Smell is, well there really is no smell. Taste a tad malty and fairly bitter, I bit to bitter for my taste. Feels medium bodied and bitter in the mouth. Drinkability is o.k. I suppose. Overall this is a fairly mediocre offering."
"D: If you can get past the flavor, the nicely carbonated body is such that you can certainly down a few."
"(D)- A fine beer that I would gladly choose over M/C/B. Solid flavors with a good balance to it. 6 of these wouldnt be that hard to finish."
"Anchor's Steam is all about texture. It has a very pleasant mix of frothy and creamy, but not overly so. Carbonation is nice, feels big, expansive, but fits this brew to cushion what could be harsher flavors."
"Not sure about what the California Common/Steam Beer style is all about. This beer makes me want to suggest a new style: enigma. This is a craft beer icon, but it has no taste. Thankfully, it is not yellow. I want to like this beer. It is probably one of the first craft beers I recall having at an excellent hole-in-the-wall pizzeria in Sausalito, CA while on my honeymoon 26 August's ago. Not even close to the caliber of Anchor Liberty or Anchor Porter. I am flummoxed, and disappointed."
"Until tonight, it had been a few years since I had an Anchor Steam, and I'm reminded again of how much I enjoy this beer. I need to work it back in to my regular beer ""rotation""."
"D - goes down very nicely. Could easily drink a couple."
"Overall this is a unique beer with a great taste that I feel I should get more of."
" Taste is what it's all about and this beer is all about it. A very good balance of sweat and bitter. A very slight citrus after taste, just enough and I mean just a touch to let me know it is there. Alot of American brews use Cascade hops that taste like sour squash and this beer avoids that strong ""citrus"" punch. Good with food, good as a session beer and complex enough to be a good slow night cap after a long day in the salt mines."
"D: I could have several of these... they go down quite easy, but still really wake you up with their unique taste. Wish this was more readily available around here!"
"This has a very nice taste, very smooth, very creamy, low carbonation beer, lots of semi sweet caramel, lots of toffee flavor, some saltene cracker dryness as well. There is a cracked grain appeal to the beer, an herbalness, and a leafy hop bite in the finish that dries things out just right. This is a fairly complex beer, more than I remember it, but than again, most beers are more complex when you sit down and do a review in the right setting. The mouthfeel is slightly drying and there is a cracked grain dryness in the aftertaste balanced out by some sweetish malts. Very interesting beer for sure. L'Chaim."
"Anchor steam is an interesting beer. People should check this out if for no other reason that there are so few steam beers and they are a truly American addition to the beer vocabulary. Poured from a bottle into an Anchor Steam pint glass, copper in color, nice head, falls away rather quickly with steady carbonation. Aroma is a mixture of malt and a lagerish odor. beer is easy to drink and tastes wonderful. This is one of my standby beers, I order when I see it at an average bar. Its a great beer ""brewed in San Fran since 1896"""
"It's an unusual but really wonderful beer. I can't for the life of me explain why I don't get it more often."
"Medium body and medium carbonation. A craft beer classic."
"Tasty, though. Very easy to put down."
"Pours a nice amber/copper color with about two fingers of head which recedes quickly and leaves some lacing. Smells of malt and hints of caramel - subtle hops in there too. Great taste - some bitterness but well balanced with hops and some citrus. Good carbonation and a medium body make this a very drinkable beer - was my session beer a few days ago."
"M medium body medium carbonation a classic"
"Pours an amber with light head that retains well and does a bit of lacing down the glass. Smell is interesting, clean malty bready character along with a slight hint of hops... a tad citrusy. Taste is disappointing, there is a strong bite that is very unpleasant but I can't put my finger on it. Mouthfeel and drinkability are ok."
"Overall - Is it a pale ale? A dark lager? It's somewhere in between. It's unique, not to mention uniquely American!"
"D - Not very high wouldnt really want to drink it again"
"drinkability: A great choice for a standard lager"
"Poured a clear, light copper color with a nice tan head. Nose was moderately hoppy with some caramel in the background. Taste is malts and hops and sugary and bready too. Mouthfeel was lively though a bit thin. Drinkability was good but I dont see myself drinking to many of these at once. One and I am pretty much ready to move on."
"D~ This is a great beer. I think the first of it's kind that I've ever had. I enjoyed it very much. NIce strong beer but not too serious and leaves room for more than one. :o)"
"This was my everyday beer when I lived in the Bay Area. It's hard to get it as fresh in NYC, but it's great anyway. Pours a clear amber with a huge white head, leaving just a little lacing down the glass. The smell is mineral and fruity at once, with some floral notes. The taste is clean minerals, a floral middle, with a bitter finish. It's moderately carbonated, with a simple, mid-weight body. Downing a few of these is easy and a real pleasure."
"I like Anchor's Steam Beer but its not something I'd buy all the time. Its a true testament that different can be good and a great reason why the Anchor Brewery is one of the proud father's of the American Craft brewing movement. Cheers Fritz!"
"D: Great beer to go with sturdy home cooking. Over all a great beer. I pity those who havn't tried this one yet."
"The taste ia a nice balance of hops and malts with a nice warming bitterish finish. Very nice mouthfeel; smoothness with a nice bit of ""fizz"". Overall a very pleasent beer. Very drinkable."
"D: Does a session beer have to be under 4%? I'd say this is a good candidate otherwise. It has a great flavor, but without being so strong that it induces palate fatigue. Easy to have a few of these and enjoy each one. Still, the flavor is not so great that I'll pick this up very often, which compromises the score a bit."
"A very good beer, nice balance between sweetness and bitterness. Good clean finish with some residual flavor. A great session beer, one of a kind."
"Drinkability: I'll be buying this again, and again, and again. I feel like this deserves an even better grade than A, but I'll change it in the future if need be. This is a classic and a must try."
"This beer was also an upset. I have never had a steam beer before, so perhaps i am missing the point of the style. Pours a lighter amber color with a terrible head that quickly disappeared and left no signs for its existance. The aroma was very basic with no specific smells. The taste was similar. There were no distinct flavors, mild hoppiness and malt. Felt light but had no redeeming features. I didn't want to finish the beer, but i did in hopes it would get better toward the end... it didn't"
"Cheers!!!"
"D- easy to finish and quite sessionable. something i always overlook, but then when i buy it im never disappointed."
"D- Easy drinking with a nice balanced flavor."
"Anchor Steam is a crystal clear amber beer with a nice, dense, splotchy, off-white head that has great retention and leaves great lacing on the glass. It has a malty, grainy aroma with spicy, fruity, wooden hops in the nose. As it warms, the fruity, estery tones come out more. It's not quite banana-- more like apple. It has a smooth medium body with a crisp finish. It's not sweet or dry. It tastes a little spicy, with notes of bread, grass, clove and lemon rind. It's perfectly balanced. The bitterness is just enough to keep me thirsty for more. This is pretty much a perfect session ale."
"A moderate mouthfeel with decent carbonation makes for great drinkability. A quaffer."
"D: i would drink this any time any where"
"Overall drinkibility is good. It goes down easy, and I'd say it's a medium bodied brew, so it's not very heavy. A great session beer."
"I recall when I first tasted this beer over ten years ago, I thought it was thick and heavy. No doubt, I was not a very knowledgeable or experienced beer drinker at that time. This is one of the most satisfying beers for any season or occasion."
"This beer pours what I would consider to be the definition of copper colored. Off white rocky head that remaines sticky but does dissapate after a few sips. Aroma is quite unique several things going on citrus and earthy notes from the hops, caramel and some grainy notes, the yeast gives interesting esters as well as a sulfer character. The initial sip is impacted by a sharp crisp bitterness and carbonation that relinquishes to more caramel and ceral flavors from the malt. To me the malt, hops, and esters from the yeast are in very nice balance. Mouthfeel is dry and crisp a very sessionable beer."
"This may be the best beer to have on a warm summer day. In a perfect world, this would be the ""Budweiser"" of the United States--just a great beer that is easy to like but doesnt' skimp on taste. It pours a medium brown with a slight tan, fizzy head; fair amount of lacing on the glass; crisp bubbles float to the surface at a rapid pace. The smell is exceptionally clean with big hints of malt, barley, and hops. The taste is the perfect amount of carbonation coupled with an ever so slightly bitter hoppiness & a nice, dry finish. For it's slight bitterness, this is very smooth however and very easy to drink. Great session beer. Pick this beer up!"
"...whatever. What you need to know is this: A beautiful golden beer and a nice foamy head that laces the glass throughout. A moderate dose of Norther Brewer hops makes this an unassuming quencher. You are not going to smell anything extraordinary except a clean proprietary yeast doing its job well. Well made and highly quaffable."
"Good flavour (though an acquired taste, as it is quite unique) that can accompany all kinds of food from pasta to pizza, best served cold. Not easy to find however and a rather upscale beer by domestic standards. (Expect to spend around $10 for a 6pack)"
"Truly a classic"
"D- get a six its gunna be a nice night.. cheer"
"Overall a true classic. I enjoyed this beer when I was younger and although I took a break from it during a hophead stretch and a Belgian fixation it's been back in regular rotation in recent years."
"D - Very nice drikability with a fantastic malty, hoppy balance that goes down very nicely."
"The only flaw with this beer is that it lacks any big flavors that immediately jump out. But I guess extreme drinkability is a double edged sword, and it is definitely a price worth paying for this extremely session-worthy beer."
"Bottle from the Davis Co-Op. Revisiting an old favorite here. Pours a nice even brown with excellent clarity and a nice, well retained white head. Smells of biscuity malt, with some sweetness and a hint of floral hops. Flavor is a nice featured malt body, with lots of nice smooth biscuity flavor, some light toasted french bread, and graham cracker. Finish transitions to more of the same, but drier with more of a bitter kick, which is nice and keeps things interesting. Medium bodied, and supremely easy to drink. One of the best session beers, and has been for a long, long time."
"D-if it is given to me I would drink it, but won't be looking for it again myself. I guess I would put this in the take it or leave it pile."
"High drinkability!"
"I'm suprised that this wasn't my first choice when I first looked to try an Anchor beer (I had the Liberty Ale in Denver last summer). This is truly a unique beer in nearly every facet subjected to this review. The balance and quality of flavor are unlike many other beers that I have sampled and it's easy to drink; this beer is put together very well. If you haven't tried this before, please do yourself a favor and get a 6-pack as soon as you can."
"This was the newest beer on tap at my local bar (Senunas') and I figured I'd give it a shot. I was pretty impressed with it. It poured a medium-dark brown color and it tastes a few steps above Yuengling. I tasted a mild fruitiness in the after taste, which makes it a unique lager to me. I wanted to go back for more, but the bar was too crowded. It is a light lager which makes it easier to enjoy. I'm not too familiar with the Anchor Brewing Company, but I'll keep my eye out for their other brews."
"A good sessionable beer with it's low alcohol and lighter taste. Very enjoyable and highly drinkable."
"T: This is pretty much the coelacanth of beers: a living fossil. There's certainly no other beer quite like it. But it's more than just a historical artifact. It's a good beer in its own right. If I'm at a bar that has it on tap, I always order at least one pint. Honestly, though, I don't seek it out as often as I should."
"Not an expert on ""steam"" beers, but it was unique, bitter, and interesting. I liked it."
"Overall, another great brew from Anchor that left me anxious to try another interpretation of this style. Very tasty and easily drinkable, I would highly recommend this beer."
"This is one pleasant beer. Crisp and clean, with a light drinkable feel and no aftertaste detectable. A great year round beer."
"D- Very drinkable. It gets a little dry with quantity, but it still goes down really smooth."
"Drinkability: I'd say this is a good solid beer for drinkability. I'd be happy to drink more right now and I will return to this beer in the future as beer of choice."
"Pours a medium amber with a moderately thick, sticky foam head that hangs around a little longer than your average beer. Not a lot of detectable smell, but a very malty, slightly hoppy flavor. BA lists Anchor Steam as its own style of beer, and it tastes like it - it's not quite like anything else. Its full body and smoothness makes it one of my favorite all-purpose beers, good with food or without. If you tried it... try it."
"Overall, a tasty beer that is definitely unique. A great choice for a session brew due to the flavor and ABV."
"While not exactly comparable to its heady Cali brethren in the hop department, one shouldn't overlook the simple drinkability of this more reserved beer - malty, fruity, and yet duly balanced in a near-perfect old-world manner. Sure, no tastebuds will be burst here, but that's not always the aim - pleasing structure has its merits."
"Half finger off white head diminished to a cloudy, wispy surface with a few large bubbles hanging around, moderate carbonation. Bronze and orange colour. There was a gentle scent, fruity on opening, then floral; with air and warming, took on an earthy nose. Taste was very earthy hops, bitter with a malty follow through. This reminded me of a very work horse type of brew - steady, reliable but nothing in particular aside from a strong malt composition distinguished it. Honest and down to earth beer none the less mostly characterized by its malty core; a wee bit filling for my tastes."
"Drinkability - Extremely drinkable. One of my favorite session beers."
"D- Very drinkable."
"D: All around, this is a great example of the style, and the definition of a good sessionable beer."
"D - Sure. You could put a bunch of these down to impress yuppie friends. Seriously though, solidly drinkable not unlike Anchor's Liberty Ale (which I recommend over the Steam Beer)."
"A good beer although not a style that excites me too much. Nothing outstanding but a decent beer for what it is."
"Overall - I like this style of lager, especially the bitter component combined with smooth drinking. Has lots of flavor as well."
"D: This is a beer for drinking. Not sipping, not evaluating -- drinking. This is the beer you want to grab a big mug of and slosh around and, well, quaff. Fine, fine beer."
"Pours a red gold with some orange color good white head with a little lacing. Not much smell to speak of. I try not to review beer styles I do not like, but I should like this one. Some really like this beer. IMO it is just a run of the mill beer. Its ok, but lacks any depth or real taste to speak of. I have had many a bottle and this beer is better on tap. You can do much better than this one. Later"
"This particular beer was recommened to me by a friend with a ""good knowledge and taste"" for hoppy beers. I cannot say I would classify the Anchor Steam as a ""hoppy beer", but is quite tasty nevertheless. It has the smooth front-end of a Pilsner, with the complex (and almost confusing!) back-end of a pale ale. Incredibly drinkable, leaves the drinker craving another! Typically, I prefer a beer that hits the total of the palette, but this beer is an excellent example of its style. Top-fermented. A good ""lazy sunday"" beer."
"Nice crisp and refreshing mouthfeel, exceptionally good!"
"Pours a clear, golden/orange color. One inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of yeast cleanliness, some hops, and some slight euro malt. Fits the style of a California Common / Steam Beer. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of some pale malt up front, then yeast cleanliness, a very slight hop background, and a hint of a light citrus flavor. Overall, a decent example of a Steam Beer from my previous examples, but still nothing to go out of your way for."
"overall a very commendable beer. i can find myself drinking this often."
"D - Overall...I like this beer a lot...it is refreshing...I can see drinking this one during the spring and summer months..."
"This one's been around a long time and it's still one of the better session beers out there. No tricked up hops or other gimmicks, just a good solid beer which is enjoyable to drink."
"Overall, better than I remember, even though I remember it being good. I'll seek out this one again (not least considering its history and importance) and hope to try their other creations someday."
"Poured a golden color with thick head and good lacing down the glass. The scent was of sweet malts. Flavor was of creamy malt and bitter hop. Not too much carbonation, sort of coats the tongue. One of the most balanced beers I've had, the malt and hop are perfect together. It was a little bit on the bitter side but not overwhelmingly bitter. Very drinkable"
"D - absolutely one of my favorite session beers; unlike anything else on the market and worth every penny"
"Pours a five finger white head that fades very slowly, leaving a good lace. Crystal clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Slight hoppy nose. Flavor is more hops than malt but has some sweetness. Smooth. Light bitter finish. $2.15 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"D: A session beer that could satisfy a hophead, a maltoid, and a new convert to good beer. It has something for the first two to like, and won't scare the newbie."
"D- I take a few of these at a time."
"Pours a burnt orange brown color with a small white head that leaves some soapy stickage on the glass. Unique nose, definitely balanced. Balance is a key word when describing Anchor Steam Beer, crackery malt character, good sweetness and a superb hop bitterness on the finish that begs for another sip. A bit astringent, a bit acidic with some notes of lemon skin on the aftertaste. Mild carbonation and excellent drinkability. Classic and always a winner."
"edit: revisited this 11 months later....just as good...no, it's better."
"Definitely a good go-to beer. Nothing astounding, but always solid with a great flavor profile and it looks like a solid brew. Can't really knock it. An all-around a-ok beer."
"Ordered a bottle this past weekend while eating at an Afghan restaurant in Cambridge. Poured into a pilsener glass. Burnt orange color, thin head, and plenty of carbonation. Smelled ever so slightly of hops. Taste of the beer was great. Nice combo of all ingredients made for a thirst quenching beer. Very smooth, low in abv, and extremely easy to drink. Pairs well with all types of cuisine, or could be a nice session brew. A true original."
"Anchor Steam poured a dark gold color almost no head. The smell was a bit light with hints of citrusy hops, and malt sweetness. The taste was of bitter hops. Very crisp, hints of citrus. Not overly bitter. Drinkability was good as was the mouthfeel. This was an interesting beer, that was very crisp. Could be quite refreshing. I would probably buy this again."
"I'm not sure if Americans cherish Anchor Brewing as much as I do. I am certain, however, that I can't be speaking solely for myself when I say that finding Anchor beer on the shelves was one of the pivotal turning points in my beer drinking life."
"D- not bad on the drinkability side. It takes a few sips to acquire the taste for it but it is actually quite good. It shoots down the throat."
"This is a good one. Try it."
"Very nice, easy to drink beer. Not overwhelmingly strong, but it has plenty of flavor to keep you interested. I could drink this one often and seem to like it better from the bottle than from the tap."
"It is a decent beer. Nothing spectacular. The flavor and aftertaste are total putoffs though. At first it doesn't taste too bad but once you swallow it the taste is really off. I'm not a big fan of some beer that is ""beer snob approved"" and this is one of those."
"Pours a very rich amber color with a nice tight creamy head that fades slowly. Very deep complex for a relatively easy drinking beer. The aroma is wonderful, sweet malts and fruity hops. Very crisp smelling. I get a small amount of citrus as well. The taste is also exceptional. Mild carbonation tingles the back of the tongue while the hops dance on the front. A nice malty backbone provides a nice platform for all of this. The mouthfeel is creamy yet thin and the flavors hang around for a while on the palate. A very drinkable brew, and with a low ABV, it makes for quite a flavorful session beer! Give it a whirl."
"MF&D - Medium bodied with a slightly creamy mouthful. Excellent seession beer."
"overall- decent. I think its a mild-mannered beer that suffers from not being exciting or daring enough. this might have been a great beer 20 years ago, but with the myriad of beers to choose from, especially amber ales, its hard to choose this over others; particularly at $10 a six pack."
"A good beer, but to me it seems relatively run of the mill. If I was wanting a ""beer beer," this wouldn't be my first choice."
"D: Good, not great, but wouldn't turn it down like I would some other beers."
"MF&D - the carbonation is perfect, crisp, cool, and refreshing. as far as feel and drinkability goes this beer is great, this would make a great session beer were it for the fact that I do not find the one-sided taste appealing."
"Future outlook: Very solid on all counts, and one that I'd be glad to welcome back."
"In the end, it's not exceptional and I wouldn't pay the high price for a six pack but it's interesting and different and worth a try."
"One of my first steam beers and I think a very good one."
"Poured from the bottle into my snifter. For some reason I snifter beers on occasion. The neck funneled the unique aroma. Golden/amber color. Go some citrus in the smell. The taste was as unique as the reviews say it is. I got some citrus and most of all a nice balance. Mouthfeel was nice and had some small bubbles. The drinkability was good and would be worthy of downing a few."
"When I buy Anchor Steam Beer I feel like I've done something good. Thank you Fritz Maytag and your 'posse' for putting together such a wonderful product and sticking with it."
"Over all its Nothing like what I expected it to be. I am very glad I didn't judge the beer by the ""steam beer"" cover. steam beer so far is great! I definately recommend this beer!"
"Conclusion: Nice bitterness and CO2. Citrusy and malty nose. Very fruity flavor with hints of mango, cantaloupe and pear. Fluffy head which doesn't stay airy for too long, but definitely drinkable with a thick, smooth mouthfeel. Very satisfying and doesn't demand much from the drinker. Absolutely brilliant"
"Drinkability: I will not be having this one again..My ranking would be a lot lower if I were not ranking to style...I think this is great for the style but uneventful for a beer."
"Pours a nice amber color with and off-white 2 finger head. Good lacing. Pretty interesting brew, leaves a bitterness on the back of my mouth, which normally turns me off to a beer, but its not off putting to me in this one. This has a unique flavor. Has an earthy flavor to it with light citrus notes. but due to the bitterness, i probably couldnt drink more than 2 of these in a setting."
"Poured into a pint glass.Pours a cloudy light amber color with white frothy heading. A citrus hop smell is immediate and slight touch of caramel. Taste is very light and crisp with lemon also a nice bread-like maltiness with a very hoppy finish. Very little lacing but it is an awesome tasting beer very easy to drink."
"This unique beer is worthy of a try, and it will be one for me to drink every few months or so."
"Drinkability- very good. This beer would play a strong company to any leisure activity, or to a good many meals, while also being enjoyable all on its own. Solid contender for ""go to lager," is you are looking for one."
"My first beer review on here - so bare with me. I really like this beer. I now get it pretty regularly when I am looking to enjoy a beer with a good taste. I usually just enjoy this beer from the bottle, smells pretty good. I think i have poured it only a couple times, and i have drank probably 50 bottles of it."
"Note: this beer is waaaay better on tap, especially closer to San Francisco. Having said that, this bottle product's appearance is slightly hazy amber with ruby highlights and a frothy off-white head. Aroma, oh boy, has some issues. Vegetal hits my right away with smells of cook asparagus. Behind that was a decent malt profile of toasted grains and some caramel. No hop aroma. Flavor has some more asparagus, wet paper cardboard, and the same malt profile behind all that such as in the aroma. Medium hop bitterness but barely any trace of Northern Brewer hop which is the highlight of this style. My conclusion is that this was from old stock because the hop aroma and flavor had completely faded and the oxidation, but there are some brewing issues there, too, that produced the vegetal issues. I've had this beer at the brewery and there it was absolutely delicious. Shame that there's packaging issues."
"A perfect ""after a long day of work"" beer."
"This is truly a must have in the beer world. It's so unique and very exceptional."
"D: Tastes good and goes down easy. It's also not too filling. Very good drinkability."
"Medium bodied and medium carbonation. An interesting beer to try but not as great as I was lead to believe. I'm not sure what it was but at times this tasted a little stale...it actually came in a plastic amber bottle so maybe that affected it in some way. I'll probably try this one again down the line to be sure."
"D: Excellent balance of malt and hops, not overpowering in any one flavor. Crisp and refreshing easy drinking beer."
"D: Pretty drinkable beer, it's quite pretty inexpensive which makes it even easier to drink a few."
"This beer pours a nice amber/orange color with about an inch of white bubbly head. Head fades relatively quickly but leaves thin lacing on the glass. Scents of citrus fruit seem to blend very well with the hops and malt. The taste is equally as balanced as the aroma. Initial taste was of sweet malt, followed by some citrus, finished off by a nice bitterness of hops. Lighter bodied beer that I could definitely sit with for a session!"
"Beautiful amber color with one finger frothy head that retains and leaves sticky lace throughout glass. Some malty notes but citrusy, crisp aromas are more pleasing to the nose. Taste is creamier than expected; balanced with grains, and citrus hops left behind. Medium body, carbonated well. This smooth beer is easy to drink and leaves a pleasant hop dryness on the tongue. I would have a lot with pizza. I would have a lot by itself. I really love this beer."
"Amber colored beer with a big head that slowly fades to half an inch.Aroma is very weak.Taste is grapefruit and some other weak citrusy blend.I honestly don't know what to say about this beer.Overall it's slightly above average but there's nothing there that makes you want to come back for more."
"Overall: uninspiring"
"(D) A good drinkability. Becomes easy and more pleasant to drink after a few sips."
"I'd absolutely buy this again, this is a great session beer."
"Overall: Drinkable, but too much like a BMC to waste the extra couple of bucks on for a sixer."
"Simply enjoyable and wholly delightful - a good place to drop anchor for awhile."
"Plenty of fizzy white head top this copper colored beer. Smell is of sweet malts, with a slight hint of citrus. The taste is a bit citrusy, some malts come into play, with a smooth, slightly bitter finish. The beer is slightly carbonated, light-medium bodied, and very pleasing overall. An excellent beer in my opinion."
"Appearance has a dark golden amber head with a generous head. Smell is sweet citrus malt with hop aroma. Taste is grainy, slight grapefruit bitter, good balance with malt and hops. Mouthfeel is medium light with a good amount of carbonation. A good brew, but for me the hops get in the way of making it a good session."
"Drinkability is very big. You can have many pints of this and not feel full. Goes down smooth."
"I can see and taste why this beer has been around for so long."
"This much-celebrated brew deserves every bit of the hype that's been heaped upon it over the years. No matter how many micros I try, this classic remains one my favorites. Pours a foggy copper with thick white foam and smells of strong earthy hops and sweet malts. It's extremely flavorful. Carmelly malts perfected balanced by a complex fruitiness and powerful hoppiness. Medium body is well carbonated and crackles on the tongue. A hauntingly long finish that leaves you to contemplate just what exactly hit your palate. Highly recommended."
"Anchor Steam pours a slightly hazy amber with a moderately thick, golden beige head. Smell is mainly malts with a hint of citrusy hops. Taste is malty, but a good balance of bitter hops. Nuts & oak are present. Feel is nicely carbonated. This is a drinkable beer and incredibly unique."
"A lot of grains coming through, very multi-grain-like in flavor, despite that there is a prominent bitterness in the beer, which actually took me off guard. Leaves a sweet flavor on the tongue, yet a lot of residual bitterness as well. Quite unique."
"Overall a tasty and easy drinking beer."
"Pours a cloudy amber color that pproduced a fluffy white head that sticks to the glass and produces excellent lacing as I drink. Tastes of hop bitterness with a malty backround. Tastes somewhat caramely. This is a light bodied beer with outstanding taste. This is a prime example of a steam beer. Very good drinkability. Definatly drinking this alot more."
"Nice crisp mouthfeel aides the drinkability, yet this is a smooth beer. A little mellow on the taste, but I'm tasting some corny mealy taste, with a slight hop bite on the finish. Aftertaste reminds me of Cheerios. Not too bad a beer. Anchor does well with most anything they put out. Recommend."
" Beers like this are great relaxation beers. This is a great overall beer and as good as I remember it."
"m/d - A little thin. Overall very sessionable, I'll go back for more at some point"
"M: Not one of the more popular styles, but I picked up a 6-pack because my entire beer cellar consists of mostly heavy, high octane beers. I was searching for something lighter and different and this does the trick."
"Golden in color, fluffy head if you pour hard enough, but it fades fast. Smells like malt, grass, some caramel. Crisp clean tasting more grass/hay some kind of earthy hop. Highly carbonated can be a little too much at times, but on a hot summer day its great. Truly this is a drinkable beer, honed for decades for just that purpose, this is one of my go to session beers."
"Pretty good session beer."
"On tap at the BJs Restaurant and Brewhouse in Torrance, CA. Aroma is lisghtly spicy, hoppy with some maltiness in there. An amber color that is crystal clear and very little head. Flavor is toasty, biscuity and balanced with hop bitterness. Some woody, spicy notes from the hops. Balanced and a dry finish. Very drinkable. Complexity comes out when it warms a little."
"Good refreshing beer, makes me want to have another."
"Its hard for me to criticize this beer, its so tastey and well balanced."
"D: This is a finely crafted brew. It tastes great and goes down easy. It's also not too filling. Very good drinkability."
"M&D- Clean dry feel that is easy to drink"
"D - Suprinsingly adictive and very drinkable sweet tasing beer, instant favorite"
"This beer poured brown with some orange highlights and a single-finger head that lingered. The smell is mostly malt with some yeast and spices. The taste starts right off with a combination of malt and hops that lingers on the palate with some spiciness in the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with a moderate amount of carbonation. This is a fairly drinkable beer, although the hops may turn some people off. Probably the most famous version of the style, and definitely worth a try."
"Mouthfeel was smooth and medium bodied. Some zip in the swallow."
"Good quaff. If you like the hoppiness of an IPA, with a bit of a malty flavor, look no further. Nice aroma and a solid flavor."
"D- Excellent. This is a nice well balanced beer. I will definitely buy more of these."
"Drinkability: A great beer nothing very drinkable but unlike anything I know on the market."
"D - This Steam Beer was great, it is good to see this hybrid flagship of the Anchor Beer is as great as billed, making this a very sessionable beer"
"Solid but unspectacular beer. Good nose, mouthfeel is good, flavor is a bit bland but crisp and refreshing without tasting too watery. Some citric notes with a little bit of bitterness. Slight soapy taste, which is odd. Balanced beer, but I probably won't try it again."
"D- very good drinkability"
"Overall it was a different style of beer and I wasn't sure if I was going to like it. I ended up enjoying this beer."
"Pours amber with a medium white head. Corny, bready aroma with a fair amount of malt. Astringent metal and bread dough taste that has been watered down. The hops don't do much in terms of adding or detreacting from the beer. Sorry, this one is overhyped and watery."
"3.3/5"
"Had 2 to get a feel for it but could have easily kept going. Drinks very easy. Great steam beer."
"D- Very drinkable. Distinct taste. Definitely something you can drink a lot of."
"Easy drinking. A classic steam beer."
"One of my favorites - I come back to it frequently."
"D - This is my all time favorite beer - EVER. I hope to drink this beer my entire lifetime and the next."
"My expectations where met."
"A pretty average beer in my book nothing special!"
"Overall this is an interesting beer that reminds me of another I've had that I can't put my finger on. The taste is very distinct and certainly worth a try if you haven't had it already."
"A nice beer, though this is my first of the style it's probably the best."
"Notes from 11/21/07"
"Drinkability is very high. Always a favorite with food. It's high availability on the West Coast makes it one that I go to often when traveling on business."
"Legendary beer with a taste to match. The aroma is yeasty and sour with bread like malt and hops. This beer is clean tasting with a floral hop and has the distinct California Common taste. I believe that for this beer ""less is more."" It's not complex but it's good. Try this one with sour dough and beef stew. It seems to match with them well."
"GC"
"D Infinitely! Great intro to serious beer drinker for an amateur."
"M + D: A very nice, approachable, and certainly sessionable beer. A great, full flavour and medium body with just the right carbonation. This is something I've passed over far too long and so some catching up may be in order!"
"This is a beer I had been looking for for a while now and I happened to stumble upon it at a Kroger in Roanoke, VA. I picked it up and it was better than I expected- without a doubt one of my favorite brews. This could be enjoyed by both beer geeks and newbies alike."
"D: The bottle version allows better temperature control and thus better appreciation of the malty complexity."
"I definitely enjoyed this beer."
"Mouthfeel is pretty light, and drinkability is great."
"Not going to do the whole rundown on this one. Sorry, just an adequate but unimpressive beer that gets lost among the array of far superior choices at Hi-Time or BevMo. Boring. Pour me a proper pint, e.g., a Fuller's 1845, any day of the week."
"Pours an amber red colored body, with a big white head, that is somewhat diminishing. An aroma of malts, with some hops, but not very much aroma overall. A bitter taste, maltiness, and some sourness. Not very fizzy. Eh. Though I would like to try a couple more in this style before I judge based on just this one beer."
"M&D--Enh on the mouthfeel--a bit biting and rocky, not as chewy as I would expect, but not in the least watery, either. The drinkability is unreal--I noticed one advocate reviewed this out of a can. If I could get cans of this and California dreaming weather you'd have me setting sail for the western skies in no time. Glad I finally got to taste this banjo of a beer--i.e. a uniquely American contribution to the realm."
"Serving type: bottle"
"I used to like this beer, but I bought a bottle yesterday and it didn't impress. Color was a weak copper, with no head, no lacing. Smelled mildly of malt, and taste was the problem. Malt, a bit of caramel, and a trace of vinegary aftertaste that ruined the whole experience. I made it through the glass, but really didn't enjoy it."
"Pours a orange brown color with a thin white head that fades fast. Smells sweet and alcoholic, sweet malts in there somewhere. Tastes the same as the smell, sweet up front and sweet in the finish. No bite or bitterness. It goes down well and in crisp and easy to drink. Just a solid all around good beer. Try it at least if you can"
"This is a solid, but largely unexceptional brew. I might pick up a sixer if it was on sale, but there are a ton of equally priced brews that I like more."
"Cheers!"
"Refreshing and highly sessionable. Quite a superb session beer, with the overt qualities of an ale and the underlying crisp, refreshing nature of a lager. An outstanding classic."
"Truly a classic. Nothing else quite like it. As excellent and intriguing today as it was 30 some years ago when I first tried it."
"D: Highly drinkable and sessionable. One of my faves, only complaint is high cost of six pack here in Texas."
"Poured into a tumbler, copper orange color with a big billowing head that become dense and rocky, lots of carbonation bubbles. Aroma of caramel, some floral notes, slightly perfumey. Taste of lightly toasted grains, semi-sweet, hints of caramel, bready, and dry on the finish. Only the slightest bit of hops can be detected. Creamy mouthfeel, medium bodied. A very nice lager. A wonderful session beer."
"It was a good looking brew with an amber color and a 1-2 finger foam head with some wintery lacing. The aroma was malty with a fruity smell. The taste was creamy and bitter from the get go and had a caramel apple finish. The mouth feel was well carbonated and left some fruity bitterness on the tongue and back of the throat. Overall this is one that needs to be bought more often."
"Overall Steam is a real treat. Pick it up and enjoy."
"This is a great beer! It will probably not be long before I pick up more. Its balanced flavors make it very versatile when pairing it with food. I enjoyed it thoroughly with Lebanese food, aged white cheddar mac and cheese and more. My drinkability score is hurt a bit by its usual price of nearly ten bucks a sixer around here. When it's on sale, it's a great bargain for a fabulous beer. Plus, it's a lager! Props to Anchor for crafting a classic, out of the box brew."
"One of my favorite craft beers that is widley available. Always a good purchase. It is an exceptionally tasty wheat with just a bite of hops and an incredible ability to quench ones thirst. It has nice citrusy finish and looks hazy orange in the glass. Opaque. Try their Liberty Ale as well if you have the chance."
"Always saw this in the package store and finally got around to giving it a whirl. I was curious to see how a brewery invented its own style of beer basically, and man this shit is good. It's one of the most crisp and refreshing beers I've ever had. There's also this nice fruity character about and it is extremely drinkable. I like this beer a lot and wish my store carried more from this brewery."
"This is a micro-brew legend. Tasty and unique. Though this is not my favorite of the Anchor beers. It is still very enjoyable, and something I would recommend."
" This beer looks and smells good, and keeps getting better from there."
"D: Easy to have a sixer of these. Great session brew, especially during a hot summer day."
"A very easily drinkable and readily available beer that I need to stop neglecting."
"The taste is similar, being restrained but flavourful and fairly full-bodied. It's well balanced and has lightly sweet caramel, toasted grain, balanced with mild, citrusy-leafy hop bitterness with lemon and bitter leaves. it's full-bodied yet light, crisp, and asy to drink."
"Pretty drinkable, I was impressed by this beer for sure."
"D - 4 - this is a good session beer, one to enjoy many through the course of a night with friends."
"Overall, this is quite the beer. I have never had a steam beer, but I do like it. I am more of a dark beer drinker, but I could see this being a nice session beer."
"I had tried this a few years ago and tried it again on the recommendation of a fellow BA (Thanks DKB!) who says it's one of his favorites. It was like trying it again for the first time. Beautiful orange amber in the glass with a healthy (almost decadent) head of foam that lingered through the first few sips and laced the glass. Malty nose, but the initial taste was a nice balanced malt and (fruity?) hops that added a whole bunch of tastes to the mix. Not cloying, not too bitter, and definitely very drinkable. A bit of astringent in the aftertaste, but nothing to detract from the flavor. Loved it. I understand the attraction."
"This is a decent mid-major. It's clean and doesn't drink too badly - better than most. Sessionable."
"Drinkability: Paired quite well with the film Karate Kid playing in the background. A fine, drinkable brew all around that appeals to my session beer sensibilities."
"D - Not great, but not bad."
"Mouthfeel is medium with an ample dose of carbonation. Very drinkable beer that I could find myself enjoying several. Great segueway into the fall as it is a slightly sweeter tasting beer, but doesn't hit as hard as some of the malt bombs that come with the fall."
"had another one this year and body was a bit thicker than recalled, taste a little sweeter."
"Really good beer."
"Taste is very well balanced. Bready malt and hops in harmonious accord. It's a beautiful thing. Finishes with a slight hop bite. This one is extremely drinkable. Had it with pizza and the two went wonderfully together."
"Really, my ""criticisms"" or evaluation of this beer are almost beside the point. It's an institution, it's an innovator, it's a classic. It's great for beginners, it's practically sessionable. It's important, it's fucking delicious."
"I would definitely love to try this beer on tap because out of the bottle it is a very solid brew."
"D- Interesting beer and a nice change up."
"D. Very enjoyable. I will definitely be getting this one again."
"Originally sampled from the bottle and now sampled on draft 5/9/08. Good beer, I like it better now than I did when I first sampled it. Amber colored with a nice khaki head which leaves some nice lacing. Some sweet caramel malts in the aroma with some fruity spice. The flavor starts off with carmel malts but it is also nicely hopped making it pretty well balanced. I'd get it again."
"D - I could pair this with any BBQ and great summertime sessions. The diamond of this mixed 6..."
"A very very drinkable beer. A fantastic standard and no-fail fallback. It is actually hard not to grab a 6 of these."
"Notes: My impression is that if you stumbled upon this in San Fran (on tap) that it would be a great find (along with the ambience and what not). A good drinking beer and a great alternative to mass market beers for sure."
"A very nice beer, I wish I hadn't had those others before it though"
"I had no idea what to expect from this beer but it's really quite good. It might be the color, but for some reason this beer reminds me of autumn. I could see this being very sessionable this coming season."
"Reminded me a Alaskan Amber which is one of my favorites. So I will be getting more Anchor Steam. A solid beer that is a great drink on a hot Houston afternoon!"
"If I were blindfolded, I'd presume this to be a typical APA. I imagine the uninitiated wouldn't realize that they were drinking the most original of American beers--the first of our own."
"Poured to a good head that lasted a while. Head was slightly off white. Also had some lacing. Poured gold in color. Smelled very light. Maybe a little malt. Tasted very light also. Some citrus and hops. Then again very light tasting. Had a slightly bitter aftertaste. Felt good in the mouth. I thought maybe a little too much carbonation. I will buy these again on occasion. I just wouldnt want to make this a session beer."
"This was my first steam brew ever. It had a pleasing dark golden hue to it. The taste was clearly lagerish as it should be, but without a doubt had a leg up on your standard lager. It had a healthy kick of hops and finished rather clean. Not a bad beer."
"An absolute fridge staple."
"Drinkability is very good. Anchor Steam is a classic tasty and very sessionable beer. Everytime I get some, I wonder why I don't grab this beer more often. Very good stuff."
"Didn't know what to expect when I bought this therefore I had no expectations. Pours a nice orange/amber with a creamy head that sticks around for the duration. Minimal lacing clings to the glass and a slow but steady stream of carbonation is present. This beer is extremely aromatic primarily consisting of sweet malts. The aroma is absolutely wonderful. The taste is very malty, sweet, and even a bit hoppy. There is a good balance present in this beer and makes for an enjoyable experience. The more I try this the more I like it. Creamy and full on the palate with a smooth finish. Overall this is a great beer that I could easily enjoy in any setting."
"Anchor Steam beer is an amber, mahogany syrup in a glass. The smell isn't that strong but satisfying. The taste is one of malty, grain, and vegetables. But kids don't beware, it still tastes great. Carbonation attacks the tongue but the aftertaste is where the goodness lies and where you can tell much about a beer. This brew has a deep, mahogany taste that can satisfy the drinker that is looking for an ""in between"" lager and porter beer. This beer is a great Fall season beer that equips you for making the transition between light, sweet brews and bitter, heavy ones."
"Its an amber/orange color with a very nice looking 3 fingered electric white head. Left minimul lacing. Smell light, some citrus zest and carmel hint sto go with a little spicey hop and bready malt. Taste has a nice bitterness and decent malt backdrop. The mouth feel could be a little heavier for me its med/light. Very drinkable and overall refreshing beer. Its easy to see why its been around for so long."
"The beer pours from the bottle an amber-copper color with a big off-white head head. A pleasant aroma consisting of fruity, caramel, malt character with a slight whiff of hops. The bitterness of the attacks the palate quickly but then retreats allowing the malt to come through with caramel, fruit and a bit of sugar. The beer leaves the palate dry with lingering bitterness. This is a good classic beer. Definitely worth a try."
"12oz brown bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a translucent amber-red with a thin off-white head. Smells malty, with nuttiness, fruitiness, and caramel. Tastes sweet and fruity, with caramel, biscuit, nut. Somewhat aqueous with effervescent carbonation making this one a super-drinkable refreshing beer. A classic for sure and for good reason. Unfortunately, at the current price on the other side of the country from the brewery, this will only be an occasional treat."
"Translucent amber with generous white head. Nose is hop citrus (lemon), and very metallic. Overall, a malt focus on the palate, with caramel, very smooth body, and the hops have a dry, grass/earth character that is what reminds me of this beer every time. Finish is dry, crisp, refreshing. Drinkability is over the top!"
"A solid beer, the Anchor Steam. I've always been a fan. It's not fancy, and doesn't hit you over the head or anything, but it's a consistently fine beer. I'd say this sets the bar for steam beer, but it's the only one of the style I've ever had. Still, it's a fine example of an under-used brew, in my opinion. A great session beer too, at 4.9% ABV."
"M&D: compared with the draught version, the bottled one fares slightly lower due to the slightly more coarse fizziness and also a thinner body, but the trademark flavour profile stays intact. A bitter-sweet session beer designed to quaff!"
"That sweetness continues on the palate and has a back palate similar to a mild English ale but it's sweet and almost like a waffle or something. Maybe it's because I'd always imagined a steam beer would taste like a waffle for some reason. The palate kind of folds over and well, I don't know. It's unique. Lots to like though, and yeah, I quite enjoy drinking this. Pleasant and unique. Smooth and velvety mouthfeel."
"Classic golden brown/amber color, and a good head that stuck around. Slightly hoppy, maybe with a hint of toast or nut. Also a pleasant dry bite with very slight bitterness. Aroma is very fresh and pleasant, reminds me a little of an ESB. Mouthfeel is slightly dry and full, but not heavy."
"Really pleasant, very drinkable beer. It's the sort of beer that makes its way by pure quality, not by being something extreme. Next time I myself am in San Francisco I'll be picking up a couple more of these for sure..."
"The beer settled with a murky amber appearance and a generally thin, but creamy head. I sensed a slice spice ingredient to the beer but generally had fruity and hoppy characteristics. Taste had a mostly bitter punch to it with a slightly sweet aftertaste. Not enough to call it a balanced bitter-sweetness. I enjoyed the carbonation the most as the mouthfeel made this really refreshing and light. Overall, a decent beer."
"Overall, this is a very tasty beer. Takes the best of a lager and adds some of the goodness of an ale."
"Something is strangely likeable about this beer that I can't quite articulate. I crave it when making pizza. Makes for nice summer drinking as well."
"Notes: A classic west coast session beer. Great stuff."
"A unique beer that's hard to compare with anything else I've had. Gold/amber in color with a nice uneven head. Smells of crystal/caramel malts with a slight flowery-sweetness. Overall first impression is malty, but there is a mild hop bitterness that maintains an almost perfect balance. An underlying fruity character fades in and out. Very smooth and drinkable. Nothing in particular jumps out and grabs you; just an overall solid and pleasant beer."
"The low ABV makes for a great session beer as well."
"great on tap. had this with oysters."
"Smooth, easy-drinking session beer. Not too light, not too heavy. This is the quintessential go-to West Coast beer, even more than post-runners such as Sierra Nevada and Stone."
"Overall: One of my all time favorites, this could be the best beer made in America."
"D - Not bad, but not my cup of tea (or bottle of beer)... My first steam beer... I'm happy I tried, but definately a one and done..."
"D: Overall some smooth toasted caramel malting but more of a tweener. Good for one or two but fails to satisfy in numbers."
"D- A highly drinkable beer that is smooth and refreshing, much like the rest of the Anchor lineup."
"Very drinkable -- more flavor than one would expect for 4.9%."
"Taste is clean and crisp, hoppy up front and finishing with well balance light malts. As the beer warms the finish becomes more complex and bready, yet not overpowering. Feel is good, better than initially expected given the perceived high carbonation. Finish and drinkability are solid. Just realizing that the turn towards a bready finish may be related to the reduced carbonation as well as the warming temperature. I guess further study is indicated."
"Just a great stlye of beer and this is the flagship brew for the style. Amazing how it continues to set itself apart from the massive pantheon of craft beers these days. A classic."
"i hadn't had one of these in years, pours a clear med. copper color w/ a thin white head which dissipated quickly leaving little lacing in my chalice ; not a strong smell, steely malts, some hints of caramel, a bit of floral hops and vinous, fruity alcohol present as well ; a crisp, malty flavor, cereal grains and toasty caramel well balanced w/ hop bitterness, some nuts, dark fruits and metal/mineral in the mix ; a rather rich feeling light-med body for such a small beer, coupled w/ the decent amount of co2 makes for a creamy texture ; a very tasty and drinkable beer here, i'm surprised the style is not more popular..."
"In my opinion, this is an amazing beer, but drinkability for me is dependent on season. I would drink this all summer long, and although Anchor has a summer beer, this is much better, and should be considered highly. I'll be buying alot more."
"Quickly becoming one of my standard go-to beers for consistent enjoyment, particularly in these warmer months. California Common beers are very unique to each brewer, enjoy tasting the differentiating qualities and nuances from one variant to the next. This beer also happens to be #7 on the list of most preppy beers according to Tipsy in Madras: The Essential Guide to 80's Preppy Drinking."
"Overall what a brew. Wickedly drinkable, and totally worth checking out. Recommended for sure."
"D - This is a very good beer that I could session it has a good taste thats pretty light worth trying"
"Overall I thought this was outstanding. Really a great session beer and the epitome of the style. You really cannot get better then this, it really has a world of good coming out of that bottle, and there is really just no way you can go wrong wit this one in any way!"
"Deep orange colour with some fluffy, sticky head off-white in colour. Smells of sweet caramel, earth, grains, with some light citrus odours. Taste is creamy caramel mixing into bitter citrus, grains, grass. Slightly drying finish. Carbonation fizzes in the mouth, with some bitter tingling to finish. Nice feel in the mouth, medium bodied. Tasty, refreshing, and I definitely want another."
"Thanks to Mattt for the bottle!"
"Very boring beer from a great brewery."
"d: a decent beer and one that you end up having a lot if you live in the bay area; good on a warm san fran summer day (which there aren't really that many of unfortunately"
"Silky smooth and substantial, excellent creamy character; well-balanced, wonderfully tasty, earthy, and perfectly refreshing. This is the prototype for the style for a reason...it's good."
"Palate is too sweet for my taste. Thankfully it is malty sweetness, not artificial in any sense.Tons of residual sugar here. Feel is nice and full too, which is a bit of an intense combination for a lager. Moderate carbonation. Finish is remarkably astringent, earthy notes and a bit of citrus hops clean it up. Chalky, bready. A bit salty too. Overall not bad, but not great."
"A good crisp, clean beer. Tastes of fruits, hop bitterness and lightly roasted malts. Another great beer from Anchor."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Chimay goblet. This beer pours a deep reddish amber with a big 2 inch head that melted into a thin layer on the surface of the beer. Anchor Steam also left just a slight lacing down the sides of the glass. On first aroma, roasted malts and caramel come out. Then hints of biscuits and just a smidge of hops come out in the finish. The taste is toffee up front with slight notes of roasted coffee beans and the finish is just a slight hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is interesting. Its really carbonated, but has a very clean and dry finish. This is a great session beer when you want something a little fuller than things that are fizzy and yellow."
"There's something about Anchor Steam that makes me view it as the working man's craft beer. Its certainly the type of drink I want on hand after a hard day, because its clean, refreshing and unchallenging. The flavours will certainly not blow people away, but its the kind of sessionable beer I think we need a lot more of."
"I don't really feel like talking about the individual qualities of this beer. It's a delicious beer of an authentic original American style. It's hoppy and satisfying, yet light and thirst quenching. Spicy and a little fruity, yet also clean and crisp. A classic, and something I can drink almost all the time. If you're reading this and haven't tried it yet, do it!"
"Somewhat muted coppery color. Always a decent head on top. Nice, moderate amount of hop aroma. Has that certain ""bite"" to it. Crisp flavor with a good bit of hop bitterness. Some residual malty sweetness. Great body-very full. The full flavor somewhat lends itself to the body. Very drinkable and always enjoyable. One of the first craft beers I ever got into. Get it fresh. I have had some that has been laying around and it isnt pretty. American classic for sure."
"Notes: It's late and I have had enough of this beer to let you know that it is not only above average,but well worth the time and money. A session beer and a delight on any day regardless of the temperature. So well balanced and nice bitter finish that goes so well with the caramel notes. Go out and try one."
"Certainly not my style at all. Smells of some sweetness and soap? Very malty with weird lager-esque taste predominant. Similar to Kolsch styles. Contrary to some, I didn't think immediately of an ale. Definitely not the smoothest or most likable in my opinion"
"Drinkability is great on this beer. The balance between the malts and hops is almost perfect and the smooth mouthfeel makes it go right down."
"I tried this beer on May 23, 2008 at ""The Beer Bistro"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a translucent medium reddish-brown with a thin off-white head. The aroma was citrusy hops, and some sweetish malt. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied, and well carbonated. The flavour was very hoppy, leaving a bitterness on the tongue, as well as a little sour apple taste."
"Interesting and flavorful."
"This is your average American lager, only it does everything better than your average american lager."
"D - I might have a few of these, but the only memorable aspect of this beer is it's aroma. The taste isn't all that interesting, and for the price I definitely wouldn't choose this as a session beer; it's not *that* good."
"M/D: Medium bodied, high carbonation. Pretty drinkable. Easy to go down. Very nice beer, much better then I remembered it. Glad I picked it up again."
"You just gotta give it up for the true American beer!"
"A classic micro that is a good place to start for a newbie like myself."
"I will come back to this from time to time because it is so good and so unique."
"D: Easy to drink any time of year. Very tasty and worth drinking."
"Slightly cloudy, dark amber out of a stubby. A finger of head that dissipated in a flash. Smelled of subtle hops and a sweet malt -- think Pilsner at a bakery. Rotund sweet taste -- chewy and thick. Finished with a very bitter, lip-smacking citrus bite. A bit dry for my taste, and the flavors lingered about a second longer than the head."
"A nice looking copper color with a tan head. Nice candy malts and some faint hops. Taste has soem good citrus hops up front with a malty finish. Nothing special, but good for the style. Nice crisp medium body creates a nice palate. A drinkable beer, but a bit over priced out here in Colorado. I'm sure its more reasonable back in Cali. Nice job Anchor."
"Notes: This is quite a unique style nicely drinkable as well.Cheers"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Smooth and easy, this is an effortless beer from the lips to the gullet. Its raw character, leaning more on the grains and malts than hops, positions this as a stellar food beer that would pair well with steak, chicken, or even vegetarian dishes."
"I'll probably look elsewhere for a drink when the warm weather hits, but this strikes me as a pretty great springtime beer; it's got some hints of summer but enough body to fight through the last throes of winter."
"O-Overall, I actually liked this beer quite a bit. Maybe didn't live up to a lot of the hype I heard, but still enjoyable."
"Verdict: This beer easily earns its status as an absolute legend by being both crucial to the revival of American beer and downright delicious. We owe this beer a lot, buy some and enjoy a few pints of your history."
"Pours a dark copper color with a nice lace a head. The smell has many of aromas of adjuncts, but also slightly fruity. Goes down pretty smooth and leaves a little bitter aftertaste. Taste is very malty, but bitter with a hint of apple fruitiness. Overall this is a decent beer. Not bad to have once in a while."
"Classic brewery, classic style, classic beer. Always a great go-to brew."
"D - A fine hybrid beer - more ale like. I appreciate the historic relevance of this specimen to the American Brewing landscape. This is one I welcome to my lips w/ a great hop and malt balance. Pale ale in some repsects yet Steam beer deserves a category all its own. There is fruit and woody earthy flavor but the finish is clean and this one goes down refreshingly easy. I already mentioned I had three, but for a buck a bottle at a place that has a decent selection locally I couldn't resist. Kudos to Fritz Maytag for reviving Anchor and keeping this style alive."
"D - Nice beer that would probably make a good session beer. I think this would be good with many different kinds of food."
"I'm actually surprised at myself for waiting so long to review this beer, as I've always been a fan of anchor. Anyhow, the good stuff: nice copper/red hue. hefty body on the lager. good carbonation. soft fruity cereal notes on the nose. medium viscosity for a lager, a bit heavier on the palate than one would expect (on first try). a spiked dry creaminess on the finish. good beer."
"Poured a dark gold body with some decent head and lacings. A rather simple smell, dry and hoppy with some airiness to it. A smooth, medium bodied brew with a hop kick to it, but also some roasted malts and sweetness to it. The malts and sweetness (caramel/honey?) dominate the tongue and the hops hit for a dryer, but not overpowering backbite. Simplistic, maybe, but still a nice beer to relax with while sitting at a bar on the beach."
"Poors amber/red. Smells of grain husk and some earthy spiciness. Fairly clean though. Tastes very crisp. Clean, and somewhat refreshing. Nothing spectacular, but easy to drink. I'll happily have another."
"had this on tap the othernight at strangebrew in NH. 910 reviews as of this writing so I'll go with a slightly different angle than usual. This is a classic and good choice most anytime. Maybe my taste buds have changed or this was not the freshest tapline but I'd swear it was hoppier in the past. Regardless it was a great choice at the pub."
"Almost no foam as I pour it into the glass. Reddish brown colour. Smells like caramel and nuts and the smell is nice and powerful. When it comes to the taste I can taste some sweet caramel and then there are bitter hops to keep things balanced. A really nice brew. Gets better when it warms. Recommended."
"D: It has a good mouthfeel, but the intense bitterness severely limits the drinkability for me. I could see drinking it with some spicier foods, but definitely not a beer I could sit down and flat-out drink."
"This beer is incredibly drinkable, giving smooth lagers everywhere something to aim for. Almost dangerously drinkable... a lager version of an english bitter... not too strong, but packed full of flavor, a great beer for all parts of the year, but I would recommend it for summer."
"D - Very drinkable. Truly a classic American beer with a pleasant malt character and enough hops to balance."
"D: I could easily drink a 6er of this beer and I hear they open ferment on top of the roofs in SF."
"Yet another one of my favorite beers. I read a lot on Beer Advocate before I decide to buy a beer and this is one of those I've wanted to try for quite some time and finally purchased. It was in a bottle and I chilled it slightly because it was somewhat warm. Poured into a goblet. Much darker, golden color and nice off-white head. I get a nice hint of red-raspberries and strawberries. It goes down extremely well and is a good beer to have anytime. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good beer."
"Pours a nice dark copper color with a light tan head that faded pretty fast. It laced the glass well all the way down the glass. It has a nice aroma of toasted malts and deeper roasted ones with a slight citrisy hoppy finish to the nose. The taste is a nice blend of sweet toasted malts and more bitter roasted ones with a nice citrisy hop finish. The mouthfeel was very crisp and clean - really refreshing. The drinkability is very high on this beer as it is a really bold yet refreshing beer."
"Drinkability= I could definitely put down multiple bottles of this beer in one sitting."
"D: It's a lager, so it's very drinkable."
"Recommended!"
"The bottom line: Anchor's Steam beer is a venerable oldster on the craft brew scene at this point, but it still persists as a tasty, if not particularly depthy option. A great session brew."
"Palate is good, with a very smooth mouthfeel that might be a touch high in carbonation. Refreshing, infinitely drinkable."
"Definitely very drinkable and possibly good for a session, but it's just too expensive for me on the east to every do such a thing. I would drink this again, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"I've had Anchor Steam before and didn't find it that impressive... now I'm not sure how I missed it. Sit down with a pint and look closely. A gem. Incidentally, reminds me of several Saranac beers -- if you like those, check this out. Now to find another steam beer to compare..."
"This poured a dark amber with a little off-white head. It smelled predominantly of malt with some yeast as well. It tasted like dirty malt with some hops bitterness. It was watery and smooth with no carbonation and a very slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall this was surprisingly dirty and bland."
"This is one of the best beers I've ever had, and my first of its style. I am extremely pleased with this one. In a class all its own."
"overall, this isnt my favorite beer but i could see having a few"
"The mouthfeel is sufficiently chewy to give a good overall body. Enjoyable, simple lager."
"Very drinkable brew, I could see myself having 4 or 5 of these in one session."
"M/D: Thick mouth feel like drinking a glass of milk. It is very drinkable and can really see why it is so popular."
"Pours a fragile, light gold with a limp but persistent white head. Smells of roasted nuts with sugar. Taste is a wet and sweet experience, almost like that of pure dextrose or cotton candy but enriched with the overall nutty flavor of the beer that lingers in the mouth past some taste of alcohol towards the finish. Mouthfeel is one of my favorite parts- there's a high level of carbonation but it's not abrasive. The beer is exceedingly smooth and light, unlike any other beer I've experienced. It seems like the alcoholic version of something from Willy Wonka because you almost can't believe it. I've never drank more than one at a time, though, and I feel that after a couple the distinct sweetness might become a little hard to handle but for a single beer, especially if you were to pair it with a dessert or appetizer, I think it's great."
"D - Very hoppy strong taste. Overwhelmingly so. Nicely balanced fruit and grain underneath that take away some of the hop harshness. Not for the weak taste buds! I could only get through one per evening, but I would have another if in the mood for hop overload again!!"
"Was a little disappointed in this, I was hoping for a little more grassy or citrus hop flavors but got mostly tea-like bitterness instead. Not a bad beer, but not to my tastes."
"D - Very drinkable nice on a hot day."
"Bottom line, this is a unique beer. It pours a nice amber color with a nice ivory head consisting of large bubbles and good carbonation. Its smell was malty and spicy with back notes of citrus. The beers' taste is smooth at first, primarily malt and smokey bread flavors. It finishes dry and the aftertaste is more malt, very bold. Mouthfeel is smooth and drinkable, crisp and easy to drink more than one. Definitely try this one!"
"Not sure if I'm just not a fan of this beer, or steam beers in general. Bought this in a mix grab-six-pack from the food Co-op, drank this one first. Poured into a pint glass, darker than commercial lager; flavor was a little too sulphorous, but could taste a good malt profile behind that. A decent first steamer for me, however I don't think I'll go back and stick with ales or true lagers."
"The best of the easy to find micros in my opinion. One of my favorites and it seems to be getting easier to find in Tennessee."
"Overall, this is an awesome beer of an awesome style. Highly recommended."
"Might be a good gateway beer to get from macrobrew lager swill to the good stuff."
"Drinkability - A long time fav for me, and one I keep in my rotation for everyday drinking. This brew must be given respect for being an all time American classic."
"Like said before, I too tried this before (a few years ago) and was not impressed. I guess with ago I now know better. :) I enjoyed a few tonight in a Sam Adams glass and was very impressed. at $10 a 6 pack it better be good and I will be adding this as a regular in my rotation!!"
"drinkability is decent. this is a bitter brew without much hop character. the malts are well proportioned, but the body is not there to back them up."
"Drinkability isn't super high for me. I like bitter but not quite as much for this particular style. This is a dry metallic tangy bitter rather than an alum hoppy bitter that I prefer."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite beer in the world but I wouldn't pass it up if offered."
"Drinkability- A very unique brew with some interesting flavors I cant quite place, an interesting beer, worth a try but not somthing for me for every day."
"Pleasant to drink, but that is expectable considering the 4.9%abv."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Beer appears a slightly hazy orange/amber with smallish head that fades quickly but leaves good lacing. Smell is sharp and clean, but doesn't stand out. Initial taste is a pleasant bitter with sweet caramel notes at the end, very balanced. This beer is smooth, and it goes down easily. It makes a great session beer (and, as I found out, part of a decent sauce for chicken). If it wasn't so expensive around where I live it would be in my fridge all the time."
"Drinkability: A great refreshing brew that at 4.9% ABV, makes a great sessionable brew."
"This is extraordinary beer. I think the bottle I had may have been just a little old, but it didn't matter. It poured with a lovely golden amber color with a generous head that left copious lacing in the glass. Gorgeous. The smell was a very nice mix of sweet malts and hops. The taste was a similar balance with the sweetness of the beer kept in check by the bitter hops. It was very drinkable, and I would definitely have this again."
"easy drinking session-type beer. Has that ""liquid bread"" quality to it and being that its from 'Frisco, I can't wait to try it with some good sourdough bread."
"Smell was intense and vinergery, maybe sweetly yeasty, couldn't put my finger on the smell but it was almost off from what I remembered. Appearance was amber with a decent head. Taste was slightly hoppy and sweet, it really grew on me after a few sips. Easy to drink and not too strong."
" Great as a session or for a quick few after a thirstifying day of work. Real drinkable."
"Pours with small initial head, creamy with ever so slight off-white tinge. Mostly diminishes, but has good lacing. Very aromatic when poured. Citrus jumped out of the glass at me, a little yeast and very slight malt. Had a scent of sweet apples or cider. Very clear amber appearance. By the looks of things, actively carbonated. Taste, or lack of it, is a dissapointment. Medium duration with a mildly bitter finish, just a really watery taste (much more so than I remember, maybe I have been drinking too many taste-filled ales recently). The mouth is a creamy feel, soft but yet lively carbonation. Lack of taste is the biggest let down for this brew."
"I really liked the Anchor Steam beer. The maltiness & bitterness seemed perfectly matched and balanced with everything else about this beer. The body and carbonation made this both lightly filling and highly enjoyable."
"Pours a fairly hazy amber color with a good head that retains nicely. Aroma is of grains, yeast, some fruitiness. Not too strong but pleasant. Taste is of more light graininess, yeast, light hop spice found in the finish. Mouthfeel is fair bodied, very crisp, and good carbonation. I could take a few of these down in succession but not an entire 6-pack."
"A very good beer really. Great to have on hand as most people enjoy it."
"D: A nice balance of flavors, complicated without being overwhelming. Very tasty."
"Overall, this venerable old craft beer is a tasty drink. Not exactly the most complex taste I've ever experienced, but good nonetheless."
"Poured out of one of their big bottles into a pilsner glass. Nice copper color. You can smell and taste the sweet malt. A lot of lagers look and smell nice but I think what sets Anchor Steam apart is its taste and finish. No after taste. Well done. Should have bought two."
"D: Goes down pretty easily. Not a lot of heft to slow you down, and the taste is ""clean"" if that makes sense."
"Drank this one in the dark in at the Almamo Drafthouse movie theatre, so I didn't see the color, but have had it on tap at Anchor's tour as well. Very nice and fragrant hoppiness, but not overly so. Taste is good, with a good bitter kick and hoppy floraly citrusy taste but with some definite maltiness in there too. I was expecting more hoppy bitterness from what I remember of the first time I had this beer, but was pleased at the amount it had, and the reasonable lasting hoppy aftertaste. I liked this beer, and especially the Anchor Porter these guys make, which is one of my favorites. I look forward to trying more from them."
" Mouthfeel is crisp and light-bodied. This is an easy drinking session style beer. One of my favorites for such a thing."
"Anytime is the right time for Anchor Steam! I love opening the fridge and seeing this beer! Went to the website just to see those big ol' copper kettles...reminiscent of the handcraftedness and integrity one observes when a pizza is baked in a real stone brick oven!"
"The mouth is light and bright. This is a easy drinking beer. Would be easy to session of your not in the mood for a pallet burner. This beer is easy to pair with food, just avoid anything to spicy."
"I really like this beer, incredibale. you don't find many like this."
"Smell is a little weak compared to most craft beers, but for a low ABV session, its not so bad. Very clean, good water, some hop and malt balance. Taste clean and fresh. Hops are present as is the malt but overall, it is pretty watery. Feels refreshing and almost a soda type carbonation. A good beer for it's style, probably much better on a warm summer day."
"This is a very enjoyable session beer. It is the hallmark of the style and the standard by which all others in the style are measured. It is extremely easy drinking and the flavor is well balanced and substantially full. For sure, this is one of my favorite session beers."
"Just a solid beer. Nothing that really extreme, to impress me, but you really have to give this beer credit for starting the craftbeer/microbrew movement."
"d: A one of a kind offering, an excellent session beer, and a pioneer of the US craft beer movement. Anchor Steam is the definition of a Steam Beer and a must try for beer enthusiasts. Nothing extravagant, just beer made the way it should be."
"Little disappointing but still, I'm glad I got to try this."
"D: hard to get through even one for me, because the taste is so laboreous."
"A great beer and an American classic. Like I mentioned above it's a balanced brew that would make a great session beer."
"Drinkability: Excellent. This is an absolutely wonderful session beer. A true American classic."
"clear amber with fluffy head. nice malt rich aroma. flavor is extremely well-balanced bitter hops and malt. one of the most balanced beers of my recent recollection."
"Better than a macro-brew, because at least it has a distinctive taste. But not better by much."
"My new favorite lager. Anchor steam poured into the pint glass a great amber color, with some nice head and decent lacing. Very light scent, a nice mix of malts and hops, but not much there. Very good flavor, each taste seemed to bring out a hidden quality of the beer, with different swirls of hops or malts. Easily one of the smoothest beers I've ever had. (Have had it from the bottle, too, and not quite as smooth.) An excellent beer."
"Pours a crystal clear amber color with a small off-white head that dissipated into a ring around the glass. The smell has an odd caramel aroma, kind of powdery (perfumey?); its weird but not offensive. The taste is of lightly toasted malt, grainy, with a shot of bitter hops in the end. Nothing crazy with the hops, subtle. The feel is light but not watery, slightly fizzy; finishes rather clean and crisp. Nothing outstanding here, a bit grainy which I'm not a fan of. However it is nice and light and a good change up brew."
"A higher than average drinkability, goes well with lighter dishes such as poultry and seafood."
"My second brew from Anchor, and I am still very impressed... really liked their anniversary ale, and this steam beer was certainly good... pours a copper color with a modest frothy head... smell is good, very nutty and bready.. taste is very slick and full of bready and slightly caramel-vanilla flavors... Mouthfeel is super and the drinkability is really exceptional... goes down like water without any bitter aftertones what-so-ever... Really enjoyed drinking this brew, and with a modest alcohol content, could easily down a few of these in a single setting... copped a single 12 oz size from Wine and More in West Orange for about $1.50... Recommended..."
"This beer has a clear amber color with minimal head. No lacing and medium carbonation. The aroma is lacking anything profound. There is some graininess to the initial taste. with a precenance of hopps that controls the taste. There is nothing special about this brew, but it is at least worth a try."
"Wow, what a beer. So different and interesting, and extremely drinkable. This is one of my top Session Beers. It is well structured in flavor, and drinkable with out being watery (aqueous?) or wimpy. I have difficulty describing the flavor, but I highly recommend you try it out right away."
"Anchor is always a goto beer when I can't decide what I want... I don't know what else to say except thanks to Fritz and Anchor for being revolutionaries."
"Drinkability will change dramatically, I suspect, to personal taste. I was satisfied by the time I finished the pint, but didn't feel the need to order it again."
"smell is earthy malts with some floral hops, citrus. Taste is fruit with some bitter hops. Mouthfeel was a little thin, but I could drink this bad boy all day long."
"D - Not bad at all, I could see this as an easy go to beer. Not an overly complex brew, but a pretty tasty one none the less. Definitely worth a try."
"Anchor Steam is my favorite all around beer. I love the shape of the bottle and often don't bother pouring it into a pint glass since the bottle feels so good in hand. The taste is good, not really anything to write home about, but very easy drinking. This is what macro lagers should probably taste like. A great choice at the tavern (if you can find it on tap in the Northwest) or after mowing the lawn. I have to drive 45 minutes to find a store that carries it (Whole Foods in Portland, OR) but it is worth the time."
"Review added 11-20-2007, translated from french 1-13-2008"
"D- Very sessionable, I've seen this on tap at the local pubs, I'd definitely enjoy this brew with a burger or steak."
"Pours a deep cooper, off-gold color. Carbonation seems heavy -- lots of bubbles below a thick, creamy top. Lacing and retention are good. Aroma is malty, earthy, and somehow industrial. A bitter pang hits you as soon as it touches your tongue. For a couple sips you might wonder if it's a bad bottle, but keep it up. One of the most unique brews out there."
"All around, it's a good beer and a great example of it's style. It's very drinkable, and is remaniscent of many beers on the west coast in yesteryear."
"Need I even mention that this is extremely drinkable? Easily #1 in its category, and a distinguished, proud American classic. Next time you wear yourself out on high-gravity ales, pick up a six pack of Anchor Steam and be glad. I really should have a few bottles of this around at all times."
"D - I should have bought a case. Very nice beer."
"I have no problem give this 4 across the board. I've learned a lot about beer since my first Anchor Steam, but this always a great place to revisted."
"Drinkability: This is a refreshing and classic brew. Each bottle I have had over the years has had its own character."
"D - Overall a very drinkable beer..totally sessionable, I enjoyed it very much"
"I actually thought this beer was better in the bottle than on tap."
"Drinkability - Definately good, I could drink this beer all night. A superb choice for a session."
"If you want to try the best example of a steam beer, go with this one as it is the original."
"Pours a clear light copper hue with a one finger big bubbled head that quickly dies down to a small, thin layer. Stickiness is very minimal and weak. Smell is a nice fresh floral aroma with a sweet light caramel malt. Some light citric fruit is present in the nose as well. Taste is a bit metallic at first but the caramel malt becomes present. Caramel and a hint of light milk chocolate is then followed by a grassy floral taste on the tongue. Aftertaste is a bit bland with a cardboard like flavor. Mouthfeel is slick and light bodied with a good full carbonation. Nice crisp session brew that can be enjoyable at all times of the year."
"D - Very fine drinkability here, easily sessionable and all-around tasty. I could easily drink a few of these and feel good about it."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours copper/amber with a half inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like caramel, bread/grain, toasted malt and some citrusy hops. Taste is same as the aroma, but it starts out hoppy, then comes the malty sweetness, and finally it leaves a bitter hoppy aftertaste. Pretty nice. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it has a good amount of carbonation and is crisp. Drinkability is good, it goes down smooth and it's easy to drink. I think it's a good overall beer, a pretty decent choice as a session beer."
"Tastes a lot like the smell, with toasted malt and a mild sweetness dominating along with just a bit of hop bitterness and citrusy hop flavor. Very well balanced and very refreshing. Crisp carbonation and a nice medium body, yet light on the palate. I could drink this beer all night, a great session beer."
"Drinkability: Flavourful and full of character, nice crisp taste and very pleasant to drink."
"Flavor changes and is more complex than I remember. Initially hoppy in an English bitter sort of way. That changes towards the middle and end of the brew, where it becomes more caramel with a chalky, dry finish. Mouthfeel is medium and more hearty than expected. However, it's dryness and complexity would lead one to call this an excellent session."
"Drinkability: Smooth enough to be enjoyable back to back, bitter enough to keep it from being a session beer for my tastes. I will definitely have this one again."
"Delish."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a unique dating system into a pint glass. It had a solid copper color. It had just under a finger of white foam that slowly settled into a partial film. No lacing but good carb. The aroma was earthy malts and caramel. The taste was pretty good. Malty with a crisp bitter from start to finish. It has a really bitter aftertaste that sticks around just a little too long for me to really enjoy. I like the strong bitter on the ADIPA's I've been having lately so not a problem with bitter perse but something about this one. The carb makes for a nice mouthfeel. Overall, it's a good beer and worth trying. Not sure I'd buy a 6 pack of it but maybe once in awhile if I saw as a single or if on tap somewhere as a changeup. (3.5, RB, T, O)"
"D- the reason anchor steam beer and anchor liberty ale are the brewery's top national sellers is that they are extremely drinkable beers. smashin a sixer of each is no problem at all."
"following honestly. Good stuff."
"I find it baffling that Anchor Steam only gets an 85 on B.A., since it's THE definitive example of the California Common style and one of the catapults for the craft beer renaissance 20 years ago as much as today. IMHO, if this ISN'T one of the most drinkable beers, then craft beer is dead."
"Smell is malt with a hint of hops. Taste starts out somewhat dark and malty, but the hops kick in towards the end. The hoppy taste is almost a bit smoky, or like black pepper. It's an interesting taste, and grew on me as I drank it. Above average, but not amazing."
"Could drink a lot of these because of the low ABV and the lightness"
"Easy drinking and juicy. Can't complain, and could enjoy any time. Well-buttered french bread with light ham goes great, and I would like to try this with seafood and a salad. Nice luncheon beer."
"D: Definitely a drinkable beer. Does not really taste like much, but it was pretty light and easy to drink. Definitely good for the summer or grilling."
"The number one thing that comes to my mind about this beer is ""distinctive"". Think about it, it's a beer brewed with bottom fermenting lager-yeast, but fermented at an ale temperature. I guess you could say, you kind of get the best of both worlds in this beer. Indeed, this beer more less possesses the flavors of an ale with the smooth crispness of a lager. Only drawback is it's a little pricey, but in my opinion, it's well worth a little extra cash."
"Sampled from 1 pt. 6 oz. bottle. Pours clear amber-copper color with slightly off-white head. Thick head at first that takes some time to settle but once it does it leaves a nice residue for the remainder of the beer. Medium carbonation and lots of bubbles. Smell is mainly of malt and sweetness but there seems to be a small, very small touch of bitterness. Flavor is nearly identical, mostly malt, some caramel with a toasted feel to it but there is a taste of bitter hops in there, a very nice balance. Leaves a slightly dry feeling in the mouth that I wasnt too fond of but wasnt terrible either. Overall a great beer, easy drinker with a great taste to it."
"Anchor seems to have cornered the market on steam beer, but readers beware, Flying Dog puts out a very nice California Common called ""Old Scratch"" that gives this brew a run for its money, if not surpassing it in taste."
"D-Pretty darn drinkable. It does however leave a little of that odd metallic aftertaste in my mouth and a bit of that slicknees on my tounge."
"Drinkability is absolutely perfect. This is THE example of the style. If Steam Beer isn't named after this, it should be. Highly recommended."
"D: Very drinkable, a craft beer classic. I'm very lucky to live in the Bay Area where this stuff can be found damn near everywhere on tap."
"D: This is definitely a session beer. Tastes good enough and low enough ABV that you could throw back a few of them. Not bad, but not great."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and easy to put back a few because it doesn't fill you up"
"Besides aroma this beer is pleasingly good on all levels."
"Goes down smooth, with a body on the light side and appropriate carbonation. A fantastic thirst quencher, and extremely drinkable. Coming home from a quick trip to the grocery store in a scorching hot car on a 100+ degree day, I couldn't wait to crack this open, and it did the job. I'd drink a few more, but tomorrow will be hot again..."
"D: Personally I'm not fond of that nutshell flavour."
"D- Another winner for me from this great brewery. It is easy to see why this company has been so strong for so long. Light enough to have several, but complex enough to keep you enjoy every sip."
"Drinkability: A very interesting beer, somewhat rare and unique. This beer has great taste, an ABV less than 5%, and I don't get bored or filled up drinking it. Just a perfect session beer. However, it is unfortunately somewhat expensive for me (I purchased some Anchor 6 packs on sale for $6.99, they are regularly $7.99). If this were less than $6 a six pack, it would be a regular in my fridge."
"Deep amber in color with thick creamy head. Very drinkable beer and like the other Anchor entries that Ive tried(Porter and Liberty Ale) very tasty and satisfying. The head was not that long lasting and the lacing was mediocre. Still, an excellent beer that I would recommend. Flavor grows on you."
"D- A super beer to spend a session with, tasty, but not overly done."
"This one has a lovely copperish color and a subtle but enticing smell steeped in hops. The flavor is a nice mix of hops and malt. It is quite flavorful, yet light enough to enjoy again and again without bogging down the stomach. Mmmm..."
"Pours a slightly cloudy, reddish/amber. Sort of a cider color. 1/4 inch head that settles to almost nothing. Sort of bready in the nose, earthy malt balanced with a very faint hop aroma. The taste is sort of peculiar. Not much flavor at all at the beginning of the drink, although it tastes very fresh and pure. The taste is mostly towards the end of the sip and ends with a rye-like dryness. The mouthfeel is crispy and smooth especially served relatively cool. Quite drinkable as well. It is almost like a brown ale with an extremely light body and a little less flavor. Good session beer I would imagine."
"An all-around solid brew."
"Nice west coast offering as they didn't go overboard with the hops and the smoothness certainly makes it a breeze to drink. Would be a good companion to some SF seafood"
"very smooth medium-bodied beer with moderate carbonation. this is a great beer, definitley worth trying if you havent yet."
"D- I can imagine a lot of situations this would be a great beer. But I probably wouldn't choose it often out of a huge lineup. Still not bad."
"Taste great. Quickly one of my favorite beer. Would definitely have another one."
"Ice tea brown, a thin but steady head with a lot of lace. Smells of malt and white bread, tangy with nice carbonation. A touch of clove flavor with a pleasant bitter finish. Very drinkable, mild but interesting flavor. This would always be a welcome selection. Nice."
"D-What more can I say, this is a true classic and one of the first beers that got me into the whole craft movement. This is a welcome summer beer on a humid evening."
"D- This is a pretty drinkable brew-but nothing special. It was interesting to try this steam beer. Definately worth a try."
"I would drink a few of these."
"D-Very drinkable could easily be a session of not a lot else was available"
"Pours a clean copper color with an off-white head. In the aroma, a sweet malt characteristic, and the same for taste, but with a dryer end. A sweet dryness left in the mouth. A very easy going, smooth beer. Lots of repect to Anchor, it got my parents to understand craft beer!"
"This is one beer that I like better from the bottle than on tap. It is light and damn refreshing. This beer is a true American classic and one I'd be glad to drink any time."
"D: Very drinkable, not the best beer in the world by any stretch, but a very good one."
"D - Overall this is a great beer. Nice to have on hot days. There may be more flavorful beers out there, but not many as exceptionally balanced as this one."
"Overall Impression: A lightly fruity beer with a firm grainy maltiness, toasty and caramel flavors with a lingering hop bitterness. Steam beer is beer fermented with a lager yeast strain at warmer temperatures around 60F. Hense the name steam beer. Also known as California Common style beer."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Tulip glass, the beer pours a nice amber color, with an off white head that eventually laces nicely. The beer has a nice sweet hoppy aroma to it, and the taste is that of oranges, hops, black pepper, and some lemon. The beer goes down easy and opens up as the beer warms up to the proper serving temp. There is a nice dry hopped after taste to the beer as it feels carbonated just right, any more would induce soda like qualities."
"D- Great If it wasn't so expensive here in MD I would make it a regular on my roster."
"This is a beautiful effervescent copper color and shows a nice spongey, eggshell head, with no lace really. The nose is herbal hop, sugar, cracked grain, and very faint all around. Taste is smooth, soft, bready grain with a pleasant brassy undertone. The finish is drying, with a faint hop aftertaste. This beer is a great example of one that puts emphasis on malt, yet stays extremely light and refreshing. The mouthfeel is round, smooth, fluffy."
"This is the consummate pale lager. A wonderful balance between the sugary malt and the slightly spicy hops makes this a pleasure to drink. You can tell why this one kicked off a revolution. If you've never tried it, you're missing out. A dependable beer I could have anytime."
"Drinkability- I like this beer and I strongly recommend it."
"Nothing special, especialy for the regular price. I got this on sale for $6.99, but I wouldn't pay the $9 it usually is."
"This is a beer I have seen on the shelves for a while but never have tried. I'm trying many different styles more often and never realized that this was in its on category. I would say as far as Steam Beer, it is not going to get any better than Anchor. Very surprised. Amber color, malt sweetness and lemon undertones, taste is malty, with a slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat creamy. This is a great session beer, drinkability off the charts."
"to the Anchor's version."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, this is good beer to stick with for an evening if you want something a lot of substance that isnt going try to knock you over. I liked this beer and thought it was very good."
"It's slightly thick-feeling but smooth. No bite whatsoever, and thicker than you would think. It's a substantial ale but with a flowery -- and smoky -- depth. Very very good."
"After reading various reviews about this beer I decided to try this brew. I must agree with the majority this is a good beer. It has a little bit of an aftertaste after awhile but nothing to make me not want to not buy another one. The color is amber and the smell was citrus like."
"The taste is very good and flavourful. Roasted malt and grain that's semi sweet hits me first and then some caramel malt provides some sweetness and that's backed up by a good hop profile that adds some nice bitterness. It has a very good mouthfeel and has medium carbonation. The finish is all nice and bitter and it leaves a short but pleasing aftertaste. This is a *very* solid brew that I need to visit more often. I heartily recommend it!"
"Quite a nice balanced beer that I would drink a lot of. Unfortunately it is sporadically available here and pretty bloody pricey ($5.95-7.99AUS) Otherwise it's be a 4 at least in the drinkability."
"Well, I think this is my new session brew. Great flavor and cheap. BMC exclusive drinkers don't know what they are missing."
"Final Statement: Now I understand why this is such a classic. This is just a good solid brew, a lager that drinks like an ale. A must try for any BA."
"Presented from the tap in a pint glass. Very clear with an amber hue and a couple fingers of head. The beer smells like bread with hints of fruit. Wow, the taste is very refreshing, clean, fresh, and crisp. This is a wonderfully drinkable beer. I don't know how I missed this one for so long!"
"I had hopes for this beer, and boy it did it hit the spot. It just took the lead in the Unorganized Invitational from it's brother Anchor Bock. It'll have to hold off New Belgium's 1554 to secure the title."
"Color is a beautiful dark brownish amber, while head is thin but fine. Aroma is weak but pleasant, decidedly malty. (However, my allergy was acting up some when I tried this.) Flavor is rich, malty and bitter with a snipped of fruit undertone. Jazzy, zingy, nice and rough, it is a pleasant and refreshing, if not spectacular, lager."
"This beer pours a copper color. Aroma is somewhat malty. Taste is somewhat of a cross between a lager and an ale, as expected. Some fruitiness of an ale balanced with the smoothness of a lager. Interesting combination of styles. Apparently, Steam beer is a style that's not prdouced as often anymore."
"This is the perfect summer companion. Easy to drink all day/night. Can't find anything that comes even close to this beer as far as quality and uniqueness. Pairs well with any pasta dish."
"pours a beautiful clear amber with a rocky head. smells of biscuity, buttery, bready malts with some sour fruit mixed in. taste is almost dry upfront and quite crisp overall, somewhat astringent. decent amount of hops but they play a supporting role here. light in body and very drinkable at this abv. as the beer that revived brewing in this country i suppose i should give it higher marks but i prefer their liberty ale."
"D - Very drinkable beer. Spicy malts make the taste and smell very interesting. Head retains to the last drop."
"Great beer. I can see why this beer is so popular. There's nothing really fancy about it; it's just straight-up flavorful and drinkable. Give it a try if you haven't already done so. Recommended."
"While not as excellent as some beers, don't be surprised when this one turns out to be one of your favorites. It's good old reliable, good to the core, and a good beer to start out any night."
"Anchor Steam deserves its classic status and is a very dependable beer, like an old friend. Subtleness is its strength."
"Decent mouthfeel, but despite its shortcomings in the taste department this is an oddly drinkable beer."
"A little disappointed with this one really, was expecting more flavour and a better mouthfeel from a beer most beer lovers in the UK have at least heard of, if not tried."
"Could easily become a session beer for me, good drinkable brew from Anchor."
"Pours a nice copper color with little to no head. Aroma is a mild yeast with some malts. Taste is refreshing with some sweet malts and a mild bitter finish. I drank the bottle in less than 10 minutes, so very drinkable and very sessionable. Excellent beer."
"Anchor Steam Beer pours a light copper color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. At first the aroma is fruity, then caramel malt becomes apparent. Caramel malt and a nice hop presence make for a classic beer. Sessionable and recommended."
"Drinkability: Overall, this was a nice beer. Easy on the eyes and easy going down. A great session beer. I feel like I could drink several of these and not be disappointed."
"The beer is a pleasing golden amber with decent had that rapidly dissipates. Aroma is lightly sweet and just a bit hoppy. There is very little hoppiness in the flavor, which is rather malty and very sweet which was OK. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, smooth, and pleasant."
"Poured 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Has a copper, milky look with a generous head that has a medium lace. Caramel and nuts come out in the smell with some hops and a bit of bread too. I tasted the bread first followed by the caramel and nuts. Finishes up with the hops, you can tell they are there for sure. It's strong in the mouth, but enjoyable. Definitely a drinkable beer. One for the future sipping."
"Taste has some maltiness to it, with a sour, astringent grassy hop note and a metallic copper flavor. It's overly carbonated with an unpleasant tasting hop/metal aftertaste. Not especially tasty or easy to drink. It sure looked good, but damn, I just don't see what everyone is nutting over with this one..."
"Generally drink in bottles. My package store keeps on hand for me. $8.99/rack. Trying to find in a restaurant/bar on the East Coast? GOOD LUCK! Seved on tap at Jivelli's in Maverick Square in East Boston -the only place I have ever been in East of California that has it. Anybody know of another place? Temendous as a session brew."
"Poured a crisp orange with a diminishing head. The aroma was a great blend of caramel and pale hops balanced with earthy citrus hops. The taste had a great malt sweetness in the initial and a great hop bite in the finish. The beer was light and crisp on the palate. This is a great session beer."
"Got this after hearing so many rave reviews on BA and from friends. 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a fairly reddish copper color, almost amber but not quite. A little bit of lacing after one finger head faded. Smell was mostly malty, bready. Taste was a lot of bread and grain. Slight sweet maltiness, and even slighter hop aftertate. Overall, though ,the grainer texture and taste dominates, with a more standard lager flavor following up. Feel is fairly thin bodied, with that grainy texture and medium carbonation. Um...I dunno. I feel like I'm supposed to like this beer - it's unique and...fairly acclaimed - but I didn't. It's definitely better than your standard macro-lagers, or even most lagers overall. I guess it'd be sessionable if I was forced to drink lagers, but it's just not great."
"D: Good beer, not over the top and easy to session."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied and leaves a dry taste in my mouth. But, it's very drinkable. Overall, this is a classic, very good beer. Definitely recommended."
"D: Highly drinkable, my all time session beer. If i had to drink only one beer forever (right now) this would be it. extremely pleasant experience."
"355 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal pub, Stavanger. Imported to Europe by www.bierenco.nl . ABV is 4.8%. The beer starts gushing out of the bottle when opening. Deep golden to amber colour, decent head. Nice aroma of fruity hops, malt and raisins, hints of bakery and oak. Low carbonation in the glass, soft mouthfeel. The flavour is malty sweet with caramel and some crisp hops. Decent hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste. Uncomplicated, but okay."
"Drinkable beer, but definitely not something I buy on any kind of a regular basis. It's a storied company and a storied style, but Anchor makes far better beer (Anchor Porter, e.g.)"
"Very drinkable, straightforward, approachable, yet tasty, wel;l crafted session brew. Would be a great brew for introducing BMC drinkers to craft brew. Will be enjoying a few more of these this summer."
"Good body and very crisp carbonation that avoids numbing the tongue. This will never blow away my taste buds but Anchor Steam is one of the very best sessionable American beers in my estimation. Just an easy drinking, well-made brew to have while hanging out with friends."
"Pours a thick, slightly off white head and copper color. Smells of fresh malt. Tastes fresh, grassy, maybe a little buttery. Doesnt seem to have too much aftertaste. Slightly effervescent mouthfeel and a bit creamy texture.... This one is deffinetly not bad. I don't detect much hoppyness to it, but yeah... it's still good. @ 4.9% this would make a great session beer."
"drinkability - Great beer, had this on tap at a new place that opened up. Nice beern selection too."
"Metallic copper in color with a quickly dissapating head. Smell in the bottle is kind of corny. Taste is very lager like with a little more carbonation. More malty than a lager, good carbonation and good tart finish. As a ""common"" beer it is very good. This is a good sessioner. Goes great with a steak. A good standby beer to keep on hand for your friends. Not exotic but different and more uncommon than common."
"Copper, white head,sightly tart first taste that pops out into a great malty. Easy to drink, tasty and like I said, a solid great brew."
"D - Pretty decent. I could drink these all night."
"Strange brew. I don't like it, but I'm sure that's my palate and not the beer. I recommend you try it and see what you think."
"This is an odd beer for me. Everytime i drink one it seems to taste a little different to me. Sometimes the yeast goes a bit chalky, sometimes the hops are especially grassy, sometimes it comes off really earthy and rustic, sometimes it seems really clean. Even out of the same six packs, maybe my palate has just been wacky lately. Anyhow pours hazy light copper with a decent head. Smell is lightly malty with light yeasty fruitiness and spicy hops. Starts off with a nice even keeled maltiness, the yeast then perks up with some fruity notes and earthiness accented by the hops. Hops turn spicy through the finish. Light body, highly carbonated, not abrasive, but not creamy either--just the right level of aggressiveness. Great session beer."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Because this was the first steam beer I was ever exposed to I suppose I'm biased towards it , still while pouring a magnificent 2.5 finger head and lacing the glass nicely it lacks a distinctive smell. Taste , while not overpowering is strong enough to get your attention and I find it to be a beer one can drink all night long ( assuming an unlimited budget)."
"I'm very happy that I decided to pick up a six pack after a long hiatus. This is an excellent beer. You can't drink just one."
"Overall, I dont think I could drink more than one of these at a time. Not having experienced this style, I cant really say if its a bad example, or a good one. I'll have to try the style more, before I can say if I like it or not. Congrats to Anchor though, for going the creative mile!"
":D"
"D: A very drinkable session beer, that has little character in my opinion, just something to pour down your neck. However, does beat macro in appearance and smell, not too sure about taste tho. Glad i tried it once."
"Don't drink and review."
"Drinks too easy, baseline for the style. Even better on draft"
"This is one of the most drinkable beers I've had! I could drink these all evening long, and at just 4.9% that would be a great option! Anchor Steam has always been one of my favorite beers, and I'm glad I'm finally getting a chance to review it!"
"Crisp feel, especially if its colder. A nice low alcohol brew. Should try it again in the summer"
"Smooth and drinkable but I don't find it particularly interesting."
"There are more ambitious beers on the American market, and there are lots of other good, innovative steam beers too, but this is a classic and one that never dissapoints. Highly recommended."
"Overall a flavorful, bitter, clean beer with just enough malt to keep it balanced and interesting."
"Pours a pretty golden-copper color, topped by a smallish bright white head. Sweet aroma of caramel and adjunct malts, along with some light sweet fruit. Palate is much the same - caramel malt, a hint of adjunct, and some lighlty fruity hops. Body is smooth and creamy, great for session drinking. A unique American classic."
"Into a pint glass, a nice clear copper with a good half inch white head, a little bit of lacing. Aroma is a bit faint, but a full maltiness with some fruits, some citrus in the hopping, its decent. Taste is classic, as good as a lager will get for me (because it kind of isn't). Nice medium body and good carbonation, its an extremely drinkable beer, balanced, clean, crisp, they really have it just right, it enjoys popularity for a reason."
"Drinkability--I stopped drinking it."
"This was recommended to me and I was quite happy about it. It pours a dark amber with a little head and some crowning after it thins. The smell is very woody with subtle malt and hops. The taste is rather light, but with some good hops and is quite dry. It's fairly medium-bodied and refreshing. Very drinkable and pleasant."
"Served on-tap in a pilsner style glass. Clear dark amber in color. Minimal head with good lacing on glass as it is drank. Smell of malted barley and hops, trace of banana. Flavors of molasses and coffee. Good mouthfeel with minimal carbonation. Definitely can drink more than a few of these without realizing it."
"Drinkability - A classic session brew and a nice return to excellent ""normalcy"" for me after having several complicated brews over the Christmas season. This classic lives up to it's name and is a great easy drinking brew while still providing phenominal quality."
"This is not the kind of beer that ""attacks"" your buds, rather one that grows on you."
"D - A nice brew. I always enjoy picking one up but the price always seems to be a bit much for the quality."
"Drinkability is on par."
"The beer pours a mid-amber color, and has a firm, thick bubbly head. It is mildly-carbonatedand and has a pleasant citrusy hop smell. A quick sniff in the glass reveals a touch of grainy malt and a more floral character to the hops. In the mouth it is not too lively, with the flavor dominated by a firm bitterness, displaying the floral hop character noticed in the nose - the citrusy character is there too, but becomes more subdued as the beer warms in the glass. It is balanced by a dryish but rich malt body, with a caramelly, burnt touch. Finish is a bitter blend of burnt caramel and hops, leaving a lingering bitter and slightly cloying aftertaste on the tongue. A great beer - one of the better-known American craft brews, but deserving of its popularity."
"This was my first legal beer if I remember correctly and I remember really not liking it. I'm drinking this and realizing how my palette has developed because this really is a pretty damn good session beer. Next time you're watching the game or hitting the woods with the guys sub out your macro or even craft lager and bring a case of these along."
"D-Something I could drink plenty of and not have a problem."
"Well-constructed and undemanding, this is a very drinkable session beer."
"D- easyily sessionable. mellow flavor. well deserving of its hype."
"Had this on draught at the Mellow Mushroom on Hwy 5 in Douglasville. I was quite impressed with it. It poured a burnt orange colour with a very pretty off-white head. Lots of CO2 streaming skyward kept the foamy cap from fading away for some time. Plenty of glue-like lacing in this one, too. Looks good. The smell was quite lovely, as well. Heavy malt, with light hops, this almost reminded me of the breakfast cereal Sugar Smacks. Certainly very inviting. Much more hops in the flavour than was evident in the smell. This is very well balanced. Pleasant, malty sweetness up front, and a nice hop bitterness on the finish. A rock solid beer. Mouthfeel seemed well rounded and very easy to drink. I truly enjoyed this one. I ended up having two pints. Delicious!"
"Very light pour, vanishing head and mediocre lacing. Aromas were malty with some floral quality. Taste was better than expected- bready malts with a slightly sweet character, then a nice delicate hop finish. Very crisp clean taste and good carbonation. A very sessionable brew, pairs well with just about anything."
"Overall: I'd rate Anchor Steam as a very solid beer. Great flavor and high drinkability make this one I would recommend and will definitely continue to purchase. Glad I found this one about 8 months ago. Highly recommended."
"Overall, this beer has a very rustic distinct character, and, as innovators of the style, a great benchmark."
"Anchor Steam makes a no-nonsense American Lager (a Steam): a nice blend of sweet and bitter via the American hop infused malt core. Its stronger than your average APA."
"Drinkability: Pretty easy drinking brew. Have to admit, the grassy flavor reminds me too much of some macros or a can of Boddington's. Not a huge fan, but it is the epitome of the style."
"Oh, I like this one. Better than last time I reviewed it, at least."
"Drinkabilty. Goes down easier than an Italian footballer in the penalty box. A great all-year round beer that matches well with everyday food."
"The subtle sweetness is definitely from the malt flavors that are heavily present. Has a great easy to drink flavor. Nice mix of flavor. Extremely enjoyable and at 4.9% it has a decent ABV. I will continue to drink this beer and I find it to be scarce in many bars. This is a well crafty beer and has a nice overall mouth feel and drink ability. Pretty neat history behind the name and the brewery. No freshness date on the bottle. This is a great beer that has been a long time coming for a review from me. I enjoyed every last drop. Well recomended."
"This beer poured a golden color with a thick head but falling head. The smell is slightly malty but not overpowering. The taste is sweet with a touch of spice and hops. It has a bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is full but not heavy  with a small carbonation bite. The drinkability of this beer is high as they tend to slide back easily without being too filling."
"Pours a bright, nearly transparent amber with a substantial, fine bubbled head. Aromas of caramel malts and a touch of hops; not very expressive, but true to style. Rich, creamy, highly carbonated mouthfeel. Tastes of light fruitiness, citric hops, and dry, crackery malts at the finish. Very active toward the end. Lingers on the tongue a while. Overall, an extremely drinkable beer, understated but flavorful, that will pair well with lots of savory food -- pizza, sandwiches, burgers. Wonderful."
"Super drinkable, perhaps the perfect session brew."
"One-of-a-kind beer. Very complex and unique flavors can be found in this one. An American classic. Be sure to add this one to the list of beers to try."
"Not a whole lot of complexity but I like it. Feels bubbly and refreshing in the mouth. The excellent drinkability and relatively low AbV make this a great session beer."
" When this stuff is fresh, which can be rare here on the East coast this stuff is amazingly easy to drink and a real joy. An American original (with taste!)"
"This beer could go good with some tacos."
"The taste was very crisp and refershing. Malt flavors of carmel and hop flavor as well. Citrus like taste in the end. Really nice and refershing."
"Taste is refreshing yet balanced and mellow. Tough to gauge by style since it's the only California common beer I've ever seen. It is unique, and well made. Slightlly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is slightly watery. I'd try it again, especially to ward off the indian summer we're currently experiencing here in central NC. Worth a try."
"D: Nice for a session beer, but in the grand scheme of things, this is pretty average."
"A must try beer."
"-Oelergud"
"D- a great session beer, goes down super smooth, light but very pleasant taste, a classic well made american beer"
"Mouthfeel is good and this brew is very drinkable. A great session beer. Despite there not being distinct flavors this is a good brew and if you haven't ever picked this up you should do so and give it a try. Despite it not being my favorite Anchor beer (the Liberty Ale is) this is solid."
"Found at a convience store on Rt. 1 in Newcastle. Pours a deep gold color. Can't smell much except a little bit like a macro. Taste is much better, similar to a pilsner but with more hoppy flavor and a slight citrus finish. Good mouthfeel Overall a really good beer. Price kinda sucks ($9.59 for a six pack) but worth having every once in a while."
"Nicely carbonated with a light/medium body, this is a very drinkable session beer."
"Anchor Steam is an amber colour with a small white head. Aroma and flavour is a fairly even balance between toasted malt and leafy, herbal hops. It's also rather creamy and has some bubblegum sweetness. Didnt mind this."
"Clear amber color with a medium white head that hands in there. Noticable malty aroma. Good taste, malty, smooth pleasant with no harsh aftertaste. Rich mouthfeel and very drinkable. This would be a top choice at a restaurant with food and right up there with Yeungling, Sam Adams Boston Lager and SNPL as a regular every-day favorite."
"An excellent session or ballgame beer. Highly drinkable."
"The malt and the smooth mouth, makes this a pleasure to drink. The bitter finish is just a little harsh at first, not my favorite hops, but the malt is so good."
"Served in a pint glass; pretty amber color with a tannish-white head that quickly dissipated. Pleasant, malty, sweet aroma. Flavor is well balanced; slightly bitter from the hops, but not overpowering and definitely not unpleasant. Nicely carbonated; this beer goes down very easily. This would be a beer I could drink very easily all night."
"Drinkability - Sure, I'll have another. A lot smoother than many lagers that try too hard to be too much."
"P.S. - I love this bottle shape!"
"Overall, a great but not remarkable beer. Highly drinkable, and far above average. Reccomended for sure."
"Anchor Steam was amber in color and clear, and had a nice head. After a few minutes only a thin layer was left, but did leave some lacing. There were some hops in the aroma. The taste was good. A light malt flavor with plenty of hops. The Northern Brewer hops are a nice change from what I'm used to. It was medium in both body and carbonation. A very drinkable beer."
"Poured to a golden orange with off-white head that dissipates quickly, with okay lacing. Aroma, while not bad, was nothing real noticeable. Flavor was okay, and this had a decent palate. I did not care for this as much as other Anchor Beers (Old Foghorn and Liberty), but I may have just gotten a bad bottle and may very well try again. This one just didnt do much for me."
"Malty caramel aroma with some hop presence and a little alcohol. Pleasing grainy malt flavour backed with a good hop flavour, almost wood-like. Medium body and carbonation, with a faint alcohol warmth. Very refreshing and drinkable for a beer with this much flavour."
"Rich, creamy mouthfeel."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer, and the beer that defines this style. How can I take points off of it, because it is the style? Hmmm. Well, I will grade it based more on my interpretation of the melding of the flavors rather than how it fits the category. I like it, but wish that the whole water hop balance made it easier to drink. To my recollection, this beer tastes a lot better in San Francisco, so I would like to try it again there."
"Eric"
"Poured a nice orangish gold color, with decent head, decent retention, good lacing. Smell was light, with classic malt, seemed like some sweet tones as well. Mouthfeel was creamy, light, and crisp. The Steam Beer had a great crisp taste, light and refreshing, with its sweet and bitter flavors in excellent balance. Very drinkable, very enjoyable."
"D  Good, easy-drinking beer."
"Pours a slightly hazy amber color -- not too dark, and with a fair amount of visible carbonation. Smells of malts, grains, and some hops. Taste is similar, but with a bit of added florals. Mildly bitter aftertaste. Feels fairly smooth, but there's way too much carbonation. Overall, a decent, better-than-average beer with a nice taste, but it's nothing special. I'd probably get it at a restaurant again, but it seems a bit expensive for what it is in the store."
"Quite drinkable- has enough interesting flavors to hold your interest, but also is crisp and refreshing."
"Along with the Franziskaner, one of the bests readily available beers you can buy. Anchor Steam pours a very nice red amber color along with a off white head that sticks around till you finish your pint. That ante's up the respect right there! The smell is floral and has an awesomely balanced complexion of hoppy bitterness and malt. Reminds me a lot of a Sam Adams Boston Lager, but with more flavor and craft. The taste is orgasmic in words. Has a carmel-like initial flavor and then heeds way to the malt, which is quite sweet. The mouthfeel is nice and heavy, makes you think twice about it being a lager! Drinkability is that of a hefe in my opinion, very smooth and balanced. The steaming process leaves it wickedly smooth, and I love it! Anchor pretty much re-invented this style of beers from the grave, and its added quite a unique beer to the styles of beer from around the world. It has the character of a hefeweizen and Vienna lager, which is a good mix to go with! Very tasty indeed."
"On par with a craft amber ale. I cant say I can pick out the difference aside from more hops. Looks amber with a nice white head. Smells very caramel and tastes it with a nicely balanced bitterness. A pleasure to drink and great with rich food. I get a hint of alcohol as it warms, but thats really the only bad thing I can say. Cheers to this classic."
"I don't really know why, but I just find it pretty awesome that this brewery developed their own beer, which eventually became a style all its own. Anyway, enough blabbing...Anchor Steam pours an attractive clear copper, with a smooth, thin white lace heading. Smell was somehwhat weak, but not bad at all. I picked up on some malty biscuit smells, along with a light touch of honey and carmel. Taste was very bitter, with the dark carmel and honey flavors showing up somewhere in the middle. Not too carbonated or big on the hops, but the malt bitterness makes up for it. Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied and very easy to drink. I see this beer as being somewhat of an acquired taste. This is my second sampling of the beer, and I have to say that I like it a whole lot more then my first time around. Its one that seems to keep growing on you."
"anchor steam is a great beer, easy drinker."
"I'd buy it again if the opportunity arose."
"D: Excellent flavor from a solid beer that's stood the test of time."
"This is a good beer and even more drinkable than Sam. I like the idea of lagers at ale temps, but it truly is subtle variant for a lager. This beer is a good pick, and I'd love to do a side-by side with the two beers."
"This is a tasty beer, with a good flavor. For me though, it has a bit too much maltiness to really be viable for sessionability. However, as previously suggested by others, this is a great beer for summertime, so drink up!"
"Smooth drinking beer, and ultra unique. Definitely a solid brew for any occasion and one that I will be going back to in the near future. A must try."
"This is one pretty available, light and easily sessionable beer."
"Anchor Steam is classic refreshing beer. It's not incredibly complex, but it has distinctive charactor. We're blessed Anchor Steam has survived when so many other regional breweries have long since failed."
"Anchor's flagship beer is still good, but I suppose my tastes have changed. I also wonder, if Anchor increased the hop bill a bit since the mid 80s, as I don't remember this beer being quite so hoppy."
"The beer pours a gorgeous copper color with a medium head and light lacing. The aroma is that of citrus and mild hops. It is very palatable with mild hoppiness and light citrus undertones. The mouthfeel is substantial and a little more than I expected. The taste is a bready yeast with the aforementioned nuances. As I try to partake of the local offerings when visiting a city, I reverted back to Anchor Steam when a particular SF restaurant had a more limited beer menu. It's superior drinkability paired well with food or multiple pints in a session. As an aside, it was also nice to see it in stores priced less than $10 a six pack, even if it had to be in it's hometown."
"D - Definitely a quaffable session lager type. Not my favorite style but nice to go down very cool on a hot day."
"Drinkability - this is good, goes down well. Very sessionable."
"12 oz bottle poured into an Imperial pint glass. Chunky white head, about 2-3 fingers width. Head quickly recedes, but leaves a moderately sticky lace. Color is a clear amber. Smell is slightly sweet like honey and malt, and a slight hop tang. Taste is a very balanced between malt and hops, one not overpowering the other. Finishes just slightly bitter. Mouthfeel is light to medium body Moderate carbonation. This is very easy to drink, and I'm sure I'm going to finish the six pack this evening. Quite quaffable and refreshing"
"Overall: Never had a Steam Beer? This one presents like a great pale ale, with good flavor and a good mouthfeel. Very enjoyable. Recommended."
"This is a drinkable beer. Its a bit average in terms of taste, but a drinkable beer just the same."
"This was the first steam beer I'd tried some years ago, and, to this day, it's really the only representation of the style I've ever had. I really have no complaints and, overall, this is a damn good beer."
""
"This is a great session brew, very drinkable. I remember liking this beer more than I did this one. I will update review this one again when I get a bottle that I know is fresh."
"Pours a clear copper color with a thick fizzy white head. Aroma is earthy malt. Taste is sweet toasted malt with a slight hop bitterness. Overall, I think this is a pretty boring beer that is over-hyped in my opinion. I will probably not purchase this again."
"It's tough to find a fresh pint of this in Boston, but when in San Fransico you'd be hard pressed to find a more drinkable beer. As far as adhearance to style its much like Duval, didn't they invent the style? A great ale-like lager, I'm sure the best selling craft in America (Sam) owes a great deal of its popularity to this predecesor."
"Medium body lightened by crisp, brisk carbonation. Becomes very creamy as it warms up. I'm very impressed  and perplexed! This beer ain't famous for nothin'!"
"The thing I love about Anchor Steam is that it is crisp, has a little bit hop pop to it, and has a nice mouthfeel. What you get is a somewhat lighter feeling beer that has a very good punch to it in flavor. You get a good dose of hops, on the level of a pale ale even. But there is a little malt caramel background that sets it apart from west coast pales. A very good refreshing choice if you are in the mood for this type."
"Overall - A pretty good beer....Nothing extraordinary, but very very drinkable... certainly worth a try..."
"I suspect that I have got myself a skunked bottle or something here, its had to come a long way you understand. On first pour the beer looked beautiful with a nice coppery colour and decent head and smelt mildly of malt & yeast (it reminded me of homebrew). The taste itself I found quite subdued, perhaps what would be expected in a kiwi/uk style mild ale but the aftertaste was not to my taste. I found it not only lingering but astringent and sourish like nothing I have tasted before bar homebrewing disasters. I think I am going to have to reserve my judgement on this one until I can try a (hopefully) fresher bottle."
"The carbonation of this beer is forefront. It is highly carbonated. The carbonation can be felt up to the point where one swallows the beer. I'm not a big fan of that, seems to be a little too much if you ask me. This is a beer that I'll drink again, but I don't know how soon I'll be in the mood to drink this beer again. It is something unique, however, there are many unique beers that I have had that I might prefer over this one. It just doesn't seem to hit the spot, or any spot like a good beer (in my opinion) should."
"If you don't mind the bitterness, this might be a good choice for you. It doesn'tfit my tastes, and unfortunatly, won't go onto my list of would drink again beers."
"Certainly the best American beer I ever had. An incomparable one. It came on a hot sunny afternoon and made my day - hazy and crisp, hoppy and smooth, all in one. Fantastic drink, I wish it would be exported more widely. Anchor Steam can easily beat dozens of European premium lagers. But if San Franciscan brewers decide not to expand production for quality reasons, I can understand. Miss this beer, really."
"This is a highly drinkable brew. Excellent all-around beer that would compliment most styles of food or stand out well on its own. Best ""backyard"" drink I've had, and I usually try to keep a couple in stock for those times I don't know what else to have."
"Firm maltiness and delicious earthy hop flavors blend together cleanly to make a pleasant and highly drinkable lager. High on my list of all-purpose session beers."
"Very solid beer. I could drink this beer frequently (and have been known to)."
"This poured into a pint glass with a nice deep amber/copper hue. The head is fluffy white and dissapates quite quickly. The aroma is of weak grains, very faint. The taste is o little bitter in the front and in the back. There is the balance of malt and hop in the body, but they just impress. The total brew could be a decent stand by at the bar where not much else is going on. Probably the only one of this style that I've had and I could just not know what I'm looking for."
"This makes a great session beer, all year round but especially during the warm months."
"Pours a copper, amber, gold color with a 1/4"" white head that quickly dissapated. Mild hops and fruit in the nose. Maybe bannana. Taste is very simple but good. Easy to drink, with a mild hop finish. Very dry in the mouth. Possibly the most drinkable beer that I've ever had. It's just so smooth. Recommended."
"Had this last night at a german-style restaurant. I got this kind of as an appitizer. Tasty. This was my first beer from Anchor. This is just overall a great beer, really for any occasion. It went down smoothly, and had an exceptional finish. The frothy head lasted all the way down and left a nice lace throughout."
"Like this beer a lot. It was the first American craft beer I ever tasted (thanks to elricorico) and I enjoy returning for a visit here and there."
"I got this beer in a bottle and it came with a frosty mug. Once in the mug, the beer looked a light amber. At first it had a nice frothy head that soon dissipated to nothing. It smelled of a fresh cut lemon and a bitter hops with a few oats in the background. The taste reminded me of a watery red grapefruit with a metallic aftertaste that lingered far too long. Lacking carbonation, this beer had a very thin mouth feel to it. Over all, I thought I could do with out ever drinking an entire bottle again. However, I could take a swig here and there with out being totally offended."
"Poured a medium copper color woth slightly off white chunky head. Smell is a very enjoyable combination of malt with citrus notes. Taste follows through with a good malty character and a mild lemony note. Finishes with a good refreshing taste that is supremely enjoyable. Hard to believe I never had this beer before.I will definitely visit it again."
"Overall, I like this beer, but I didn't have anything to compare it to. Not sure I've ever had another steam beer. So my ratings pretty much only reflect how I feel about the beer. In conclusion, for a lager that is fairly light in color, I was pleasantly surprised."
"There is nothing more refreshing than drinking an Anchor Steam on a hot day (yes, even outta the bottle) or more classic a microbrewed taste than this beer. This was one of my first microbrews and I fell in love with it immediately. It says, ""Anchor Steam"" to you while you consume it. Slightly malty on the front, mild hoppy kickback, great session beer, great starter for a new micro-drinker. Nice head upon the poor, decent lacing down the glass. An alltime classic!"
"Nice copper color with just a bit haze to it. Fingers worth of creamy head. The smell was hard to find...slight malt scent in the distance but nothing really pops out. Nice and creamy feel to it. A semi-sweet roasted malt flavor with a bit of hoppy citrus on the finish. Nicely balanced, almost full-bodied brew that goes down easy. I only wish the aroma would catch up with the rest of the characteristics."
"Drinkability - I can't drink this too much. Something about this makes it a bit undrinkable once it is halfway through the glass. Still a good beer."
"A very good beer overall. Certainly not worth the price, but very good."
"I could have several of these and they might have to become a go to beer for the summer."
"I'll definately be coming back to this one, perhaps fairly often. Tasty brew!"
"D-A little tart and makes your mouth water and your cheeks pucker. Recomend it once"
"Has it changed or has my taste changed..????"
"Drinkability is very good , a good session beer."
"I've heard so much about this beer, I had to try it. No complaints. The creaminess definitely puts it in a category by itself."
"This beer doesn't give you anything spectacular, but the taste is really unique, and it's one you can drink frequently and not get sick of it."
"Overall a nice refreshing and flavorful beer. Clean and well balanced. Not my favorite of Anchor's offerings, but a fine beer anyway."
"Pretty good, a perfect session beer."
"Musings: One of my favorites. The accustomed taste is like a train wreck to get thru at first - but then becomes one of your best friends. Highly refreshing and interesting."
"D - very tasty session beer, not overly hopped, easy to go down."
"it's not a character of aroma or taste i can really identify. not that it's all that mystical, but it is a bridge style. i like it, but i don't"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Grab yourself a six pack enjoy the day."
"This is a very interesting brew, not comparable to any standard beer ... guess this is hardly a love at first sight, but once you start liking it ..."
"Poured into a pint, color is a deep clear amber , with an inch of creamy , off white foam that dissipates to quarter inch; well sustained by a constant rising carbonation. A fair amount of lacing left on the glass. Taken to the nose ,aromas are of grain , earthy , some fruity notes and slightly bready qualities. Raw , grainy flavors come first ( and quickly) , then some bitter earthiness and a slighty citric and bitter hop finish. Interesting floral flavor here and there. This is a very unique and neat beer. An in yo face , grainy-raw ride , full of character and intrigue. Just a great beer."
"Slàinte!"
"D - Definetly a sessionable beer and something I always have on hand for friends. I have no idea why I didn't review this earlier - I've had this sitting in my fridge for quite a while now. A good beer."
"Overall, a decent example of a uniquely American style. It was okay to share this with an Austrian friend who had never had this style before, but I don't think I'd be purchasing this on a regular basis (I would rather have Anchor's Liberty Ale, as my tastes lean towards the American Pale style...also, too much good homebrew to drink!)."
"Poured into a pint glass with a 1 finger head lasting 5 seconds. I love the color of this brew, it looks exceptional. At first sip, it tasted somewhat like an ale, but later it subsided to a malty taste. I think this would be an excellent session beer (I will find out tonight.) Not too much in the aftertaste, but quite refreshing"
"It is a little hard to describe this beer but i will take my best shot. There was almost no head at all, could have been the way the bartender poured it. Taste was decent but I dont think I could sit down and drink a lot of them. If you are going out to dinner I would definetly suggest it if they have it on tap."
"This is the beer that changed my attitude about beer. Very drinkable, makes an excellent and refreshing session beer, but it's can be an acquired taste for some folks. Serving this beer too cold can make for a bitter experience."
"Very drinkable, worth a try."
"I can always drink one (or six) of these. This is the standard for the style, as they created it."
"I've never found the ""California common"" style very interesting, which I guess is why I never got around to reviewing it to now. A drinkable beer, but not much that makes it stand out. Other interpretations that are good tend to rely on good malt character or interesting hops. The character of lager-at-ale-temp yeast just doesn't produce interesting flavors, in my opinion."
"A simple, uncomplicated beer with no real negative traits. A sensible session beer choice, favored over many equally low ABV beers that can only claim a fraction of the quality."
"I had great expectations for this beer and it's legendary status which perhaps is why it turned out to be a disappointement. It's not a bad beer and is far better than a pale tasteless macro beer, but compared to what I expected it was bland. I wanted more perfume, more scent, more magic. What I got was fine."
"On-tap served in a pint glass. Copper hue, slim head of white foam, good carbonation present. The aroma was quite faint with a light maltiness. The taste is nice, not particularly sweet, but somewhat nutty and semi-bitter. Alcohol does not appear strong. Crisp mouthfeel and finish, light bodied, but not watery, it goes down easy. This has always been a very reliable session beer, especially when there isn't much else to choose from. A classic..."
"Very dark amber, with an off-white head which is made of various seized bubbles and has some retention. Malty aroma that with herbs, almost medicinal. Dark chocolate, and coffee  nice dry finish that balances the flavor profile nicely. Very chewy and round, wonderfully soft."
"Overall, it is a decent session beer."
"Cheers!"
"The carbonation is nice and lively and this beer is highly drinkable. I just wouldn't ever think of going out of my way for it."
"Anchor Steam pours a golden amber color, and mine had a thin off white head that left a lacing around the sides of the glass. It has a musky sweet smell of malts, with ample hops to balance it out. The beer seems to have malty characters that hit the pallet first, and in the body significant hop characters(kinda resiny). The aftertaste is fairly smooth, but bitter at the same time. I felt like the bitterness was really strong, but as you drink the beer it becomes much less prominent. Mouthfeel: nice balance of malts/hops. The drinkablity grows as you drink it, I always want another when I finish the first. I had this conception that I really wasn't a fan of lagers, but to my surprise this is a lager...it has really changed my perception...I plan on experimenting with the variety a little more."
"It's smooth and slightly dry and just oh so easy to drink. This is a great gateway beer for friends and a wonderful session beer to have on hand."
"This is a true original. The beer pours an amber color with a nice head. The smell is a pleasing sweet malty aroma that I can't quite put my finger on. The taste is a well balanced mix of malts and hops. The mouthfeel was low carbonation and dry. This is the epitome of a good session beer to me."
"Nice coppery color with good clarity. Wonderful malty, caramel smell. Malt flavor prominent. Smooth mouthfeel & easy drinking. Not as hoppy, but with good hop flavor in the finish without being bitter. Could be a bit more carbonated for my taste, but porper for the style."
"This is a nice drinkable steam beer from anchor that really would be nice on a nice warm day or even as a nice drink after a long day at work. A good all around beer for the beer geek or the average beer drinker."
"Mouth feel is light to medium in body and has active carbonation."
"Drinkability - This is what a ""Beer"" should taste like, could drink these in a session... matter of fact I think I will now ;)"
"D - The drinkability here is high -- this is a very quaffable brew."
"This beer poured a golden amber with an ample white head that fades quickly and leaves a thin film the whole way down the glass. The smell is mostly pale malts. The taste is a very strong taste of pale malts but it is balanced nicely with some subtle hops. There is a good thickness and some strong carbonation that complements this beer nicely. Overall a highly drinkable and very good for a hot summer day."
"Special Note: do not drink this beer too cold. like many beers and wines, the flavors and aromas must be allowed to breathe. If you don't mind warm beer, this would probably be best at room temperature."
"I don't see why I couldn't have another one. Overall, it's a relatively unique taste, but a good one."
"Overall just a solid american beer. Can't go wrong with it. great balance. Mmmm good."
"Smells good--nice carmally aroma that really is a good indication of what I'm about to taste. Pours a big, pillowy head and there's a good stiff lacing all the way to the bottom. The taste is really very good I think--it's got a carmally hoppiness, if that makes sense, and it just feels very full and substantial in my mouth and on my tastebuds. I really liked this--good balance and fleshed out."
"You ever say to yourself, I just want something that tastes like beer? That is the place this beer has in my heart. It pours out with a tiny white head. The body is an amber color with a decent amount of carbonation. Nothing like the streams in a belgian, but nice, and well beer like. It has a very clean beer smell. A light melon like hop and a tiny bit of malt. This beer never ceases to amaze me with flavor. Delicious hint of fruit, but mostly a perfectly balanced beer. The hops have a couple of layers. The first flavor I taste is very fruity, but it opens into a peppery flavor as it goes down, and just after, the flavor comes out as a piney/citrusy flavor. Very fun to drink and easy to drink. This is the jack of all trades of beers....you could drink it as a lawnmower gusler or a sipping evening beer. Goes great with food too."
"A light, drinkable, and unobtrusive offering. Nothing that will blow you away in terms of flavor, but a version very indicative of the style."
"Taste is pretty refreshing, clean, with little bitterness in the finish. Decent going down, fairly easy to drink. I'd order another. This is good beer."
"Easily a session beer of great weight. I'll drink it again for sure."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are average, nothing particularly notable. Interesting beer, worth a tasting for sure."
"this is quite a unique beer. lovely copper color with a nice head. aroma is rahter faint. taste is very difficult to describe - first thing noticed is bitterness of hops, not fruity or citrusy at all, next comes a toasty malt character. mouthfeel is very smooth and drinkability is extremely high, great session beer! this beer is so unique that i find the flavors very difficult to describe, i just know that i like it a lot! highly reccomended."
"Clear medium copper with a small bumpy head and many columns of carbonation. Nose is a powdery collection of malt with a hint of bitterness. Taste is smooth, well-balanced, with a very mild lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium, a firm body. Nothing off-putting at all in this highly sessionable brew. Get it. Enjoy it."
"D - Pretty bad. I passed off the second half of my bomber. It just wasn't an enjoyable brew. I don't know about food pairings, I think there might be something with which it would be sucessfully paired, but I cannot envision it (might be the barleywine that I just drank). Sessionable? No. Not at all. It is weak enough for sure, but the aftertaste destroys the prospect of sessioning this beer."
"Although I liked the beer very much, the full body prevents me from drinking another one in the near future, the style is just in between a very drinkable beer like Koninck or Palm and a speciality brew like Westmalle dubble, from which one is enough. That is why I gave an average rating for drinkability."
"I think this beer is due a better rating than what I see. This is a good session beer to have on the menu."
"DA little disappointed in this oneI had in on tap in college and remember liking it much more than I did in this bottle. That being said, I will try to find it on tap (perhaps at Old Chicago) and re-review to be fair."
"This beer gets a 5 not because it is the best beer I've ever had, or my favorite, but simply based on the style. This is the original, the very first steam/CA common beer, and it is the one that all imitations are based upon. A true classic."
"Drinkability:Definitely a refreshing session brew. Prefect for summer afternoon's at the ballpark."
"Crystal clear amber. Light, yet persistent carbonation. Greyish yellow foam cap. Yeasty bread dough and crisp astringent hop aromas. Angular maltiness with fruity-yeasty links to a citric bitter hop finish. Clean, crisp and juicy, and light in body. Out of this world drinkability, but I'm usually satisfied by just one. Props to the OG, Mr. Maytag."
"This is a great steam beer. One of the original of its kind. It is well worth every penny of it. In fact, while out in SF, try to go to the brewery there, this is surely a great beer and visit. A must have."
"Drinkability: Like other Anchor brews, that unique airy mouthfeel dominated the experience for me, and I'm not very fond of it. It doesn't seem to blend well with the rest of this beer. An American classic to be sure, just not for me."
"Pours an exceptionally clear deep, reddish brown amber into a pint glass, thick foamy head lasted for a short while before falling to moderate cream colored lacing. This particular lager is exceptionally complex in both smell and flavor, scent is hoppy, citrusy and floral. Tastes caramelly sweet, hoppy and fruity, finished with some hop bitterness and a little dry. This is one of my newfound favorite beers, will seek out in the future, would consider a new favorite session beer almost. Mouthfeel is slick and smooth, goes down very well, finshing clean with a light bitterness. Being my first California Common, I must say this is an excellent brew."
"Overall, this is a great beer and I'm glad the opportunity popped up to give it a shot. I respect the makers of this beer and its bretheren going way back to the 1800s."
"Very drinkable."
"This is a beautiful session beer, IMO, which is good because I get it here in big 650ml bottles."
"What a classic beer. There is an homage to this beer at the Magic Hat brewery in Burlington Vermont, and it is clear why. The taste is light but still full, with a crisp malt to it. Drinking it is really easy, especially if you are used to seeking out the more extreme varieties of beer, its a welcomed change. The smell has hints of wheat in it, but the carmalized notes peek through as well."
"At one time this was probably one of the better beers available to beer drinkers. For what its worth, it really is a good drinking beer, goes good with food or not. I would choose this over pilsners/exports/canadians and of course, the BMC conglomerates. This is a very expensive session beer."
"Pours a clear amber, with average-sized white head that leaves modest lace. The aroma is mild, but toasty malts fallowed by earthy hops. The taste is somewhere between a lager and an ESB. Hop bitterness overtakes the caramel malts, but nothing is terribly assertive. This is one of the beers, if not the beer, that started the craft beer revolution in America so it deserves its props and it's one hell of a session brew to boot."
"Notes: I have never had a California Common/Steam Beer before, but this example is pretty good. I would recommend at least trying it, as it is a historic brew and a solid beer of its style (apparently)."
"This beer pours a clear deep amber has a one finger light tan head with excellent retention and a nice coating of lace on the glass afterwards. The aroma is of sweet malt and caramel. The flavor is low in hops at first, earthy roasted malt with a slightly bitter hop finish. This beer seems to be their standard bearer but i'll take their much hoppier Liberty ale over this any day."
"Mouthfeel was cleansing with medium carbonation. Overall, it was quite different than I remember [it has been over a decade since I last had this brew]. Not nearly as exciting, but this may have to do with the vast amount of other beers I have since tasted. For those who have not expanded their beer horizons, this would be a good introduction of a good American beer."
"Mouthfeel: Kind of light on the tongue and slightly thin, but this is according to style and is actually quite quenching when paired with the lighter flavor of this beer."
"Sessionable by the gallons!"
"Not merely one of the best examples of the style, but arguably one of the best American beers on the market. Ive said it before in various forum posts and Ill say it again: this well-balanced, infinitely drinkable brew is THE perfect session beer. No one can claim to be a serious craft beer lover and never have tried this one! Highly, highly recommended!"
"She got a body that licks creamy and is no way flat"
"M & D: Mouthfeel is nice, not too bitter--has excellent balance. Drinkability is exceptionally good. I could have a bunch of these in a session as they are easy drinking and very tasty."
"drinkability: pretty drinkable"
"Overall OK, but nothing special, and not worth the price charged at the LCBO. If you can get it locally though, go for it."
" It's easy to forget about this one, but I make sure to get some every few months or so. My dad says he used to get this in the 70's (he still does.) Things weren't so bad in 70's for beer if this was around. A good beer to chose if you had to pick one to be stuck on a deserted Island."
"overall- kinda reminds me of an oktoberfest with the malty backbone. pretty nice beer overall. Not a favorite but a really nice clean taste."
"tastes much better. this is obviously a well-made brew. a little more bitter than i expected. quite drinkable, i could have a few of these."
"Hops a major flavor with a sweet caramel taste, also a fruity flavor and finishes a little dry. I like this beer. Now I know why people have recommended it over the years."
"The taste is a good combination of lighter malts with a full body flavor. Creamy almost but with a hint of caramel flavoring and then at the end a spicy kick. A small amount of floral is noticeable but you have to look for it. Anchor Steam is a nice summer beer and has a fantastic history. If you have the time I suggest to peak around their web site and check the history."
"Pours a clear, medium copper with a small, off-white, foamy head that has very good retention. Some sparse, spotty lacing. The smell is of perfumy fruit and grain. The taste is rather mild and a bit sweet up front with a good balance and a pleasant fruity, lemony, light bitter finish. It has a thin-medium body, lightly dry texture, and moderate carbonation. There was a slight sourness in there that I didnt care that much for, but otherwise this is a highly sessionable brew that I enjoyed."
"d - i couldn't drink as many steam beers as i could drink their liberty ale, but i could definately go through a few of these and be quite happy that i did!"
"Pours incredibly deep copper color with a finger of head taht falls slightly to a healthy foam over top. The nose is lightly grainy, light caramel. Overall, it is not an overly aromatic brew. Flavor is prominently grainy, with a light caramel. A light hop bitter hangs on the finish. Nothing really grabs me and keeps my interest, though this would be a good transition brew for those just fining craft beer. Feel is moderate with a very active bubble on my tongue. The beer is smooth and very easy to drink. I'm not the biggest fan of the grainy nature of it. There is nothing flawed in it, but I don't think I would buy this one again. It just doesn't do it for me."
"Very smooth and drinkable. This would be an excellent ""session"" beer and should go well with almost any kind of food."
"Anchor you son of a bitch you've done it again. Thanks."
"Pours a tawny light brown with a vague clarity. A dense two finger head has nice retention and average lacing. Spicy hop nose with hints of lightly toasted sweet malt. I'd like to say the assertive hop bitterness is well balanced with the mildy vinous citrus flavor, but I can't judge the style until I review more of the same. I can say that the light body and medium carbonation make up a mostly smooth mouthfeel, but the spice/hop bite lingers and dries the finish enough to make the average rating for drinkability generous."
"Notes: good all around beer, can't go wrong with it"
"Drinkability: Easily poundable. Nothing exciting and nothing off either. I've never had a ""steam beer"" before. Tastes like a solid lager to me. Lagers aren't my favorite but I'm glad to have tried this once."
"Pours a reddish/golden amber with a finger of khaki head and a bit of lacing. Smell is heavy on the toasted grain and caramel malts. Taste continues with the toasted barley malts, caramel, a sliver of citrus, and an elusive hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, medium bodied, and moderately crisp. Tastes like prototypical lager, a lot like Sprecher's lagers. Drinkable for days, but nothing too exciting. Never been much of a lager fan, but this was tasty enough I suppose. Enough character to keep me interested."
"It's been nearly a decade since I've had Anchor Steam. I revisted the classic this evening. The Steam poured a nice copper-like color with a proud head that left decent lacing early on. Initial smell is malty with a slightly bitter tang in the front. Same carried over to the taste. This is a very nice, straightforward, and historic American brew. It's a must try."
"Pours a copper color with soapy foam that leaves behind bits of lacing. I detect a roasted, toasty character in the aroma along with a hint of nutmeg. First taste is unique to say the least; very distinct. Roasted malt is upfront with a pepper spice aftertaste. My mouth is left dry and refreshed, but this brew is rather biting (i.e. powerful and flavorful). Some bitterness in the tate, but not on the magnitude of a pale ale or IPA. Overall, a very good beer with an interesting history. Worth of a few pints."
"The beer dispenses from the 12-ounce brown stubby bottle a crystal clear deep amber with a personable creamy light tan head that last for eons before dissolving leaving a fine coating of lace to conceal the glass. Nose is sweet malt, fresh and crisp, clean on the palate, start is lightly sweet with the malt pleasant and the top light to medium in feel, Finish has a pleasing acidity and the hops delightful in their spicy presence, dry aftertaste, a pleasant beer on a still hot Sunday afternoon in Phoenix."
"This is a great!!! looking beer wth a full head and a clear dark coppery color..The smell is ok,a pretty full spice and ale mix with a malt backbone.The taste is a little bitter with malt and citrus flavors. The flavors are very unique. A can see myself having more than one of these tailgating perhaps.This goes down so easy I think I'll have another. Cheers."
"Smell is light and clean and understated. Nutty malt. I taste it and it really strikes me as bland; no hops to speak of. It is a very pleasant texture but boring flavor."
"Between light and medium in body, softly carbonated, and easy to drink. I'll stick with my ales thank you."
"Mouthfeel has a nice bite to it, sticks to the back of the throat. A very summery beer. This says ""west coast"" to me in a big way. Even though I haven't much experience with this style, I'm already a bit of a fan."
"Classic old style label and the stubby bottle, Anchor Steam is a classic example of the style. It pours a dark coppery orange color, clear and clean, with a short but thick head of off white foam. The head does shrink away, and it is just a bit too thin to leave any lace. There is a strong barley malt aroma, with some earthy characteristics in the smell of caramel and nuts - similar to oa brown ale. Similar taste of malt and some clean hop bitterness. Rich and full bodied, but still quite refreshing - pleasantly ssuprised with this one."
"It came out a light copper color with a nice size head of foam that left some lacing toward the bottom of the glass. Not much of a smell with this beer, except for some malts with a fruity background. Some smell is better than no smell. The taste you get is the the lager first than the ale second. It is a crisp, malted hops with a dry hop bitterness at the end. The mouthfeel was light without being a light beer and with some carbonation. This is a beer that everybody should try for themselves. It would also make a nice summer session beer."
"I don't doubt this is spot on for the style. Not my favorite thing in the world but definitely has its place in the beer spectrum."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. Head is moderate with O.K. retention and not much lacing. Color is just a deaper red than peach. Smell is faintly caramel. Taste is well carbonated, crisp and slightly sweet. Toast and caramel come to mind, light on the hops and fairly balanced. Refreshing and conducive to nice bouts of belching. Mouthfeel is just thick enough and pretty drinkable. Great example of an All-American lager type beer. Fits right in with lagers and pilsners on the drinkability factor. Definitely will revisit on many a warm summer night."
"D- This beer does have interesting qualities of both lagers and ales and is a very smooth beer. It doesn't have quite the complexity to hold my interest."
"Anchor Steam is widely accepted as the classic example of a California Common. It features a atrong caramel malt aroma and flavor. A refreshing bitternes, but not too much. Steam is crystal clear, copper orange with some darker hues. Always and acceptable beer in my house."
"I could sense a vegetable like aftertaste that followed a slightly fruity beginning. A very good beer, but very expensive. Worth a try. The lingering aftertaste is a nice reminder."
"The taste of the lager yeast is very prominent, reminding me of Yuengling Lager, especially toward the end of the pint, when the taste became heavy, dominant, and overwhelming. This beer just doesn't do it for me. There were some hints of strawberries and a tinge of malty sweetness on a few swigs when the pint was half full (or half empty, since I'm giving a negative review), but that was a brief respite from the experience of swigging this beer. Steam (aka California Common) is a style unto itself. I don't have much interest in it, based on this beer. It tastes more or less like a generic lager. I'm not surprised there aren't many brewers working in this style."
"This beer uses lager yeast and was brewed at ale temperatures! Unique genre! STEAM, not ale, not lager, but the best of both worlds. Flavorful and clean and refreshing. The only important atribute with this beer is its exquisite balance of hops and malt. This balance carries through to every facet of the tasting process. The end result is lots of flavor and lots of drinkability. A middle of the road beer that is sure to satisfy most who don't prefer one extreme or another. My personal review on the brand- Anchor owns the rights to the name ""STEAM."" This is like owning the word ""ale."" This is absurd and usually unnoticed, so if you can find a steam beer of equivelant quality, buy IT instead. I love this beer with all of my heart. Too bad it costs $8 a six!"
"Anchor Steam is a refreshing, enjoyable beer (and virtually the only example of its style on the market). It may be slightly overrated due to its ""cult classic"" status. On the other hand, it did single-handedly keep a style alive; overall, it's a good crossover craft beer."
"Pours a semi-clear pale red color with a creamy white head. The aroma is malty with hints of spices. The taste is sweet, but not too strong. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, and very smooth.. Overall, this is a great summer brew. It's easy to drink and refreshing."
"I have decided to delete my previous rating because Im sure I got spoiled samples. The sample I am tasting now was bought from a hotel consignment. According to the date code this beer is 3 weeks old. This was fresh tasting beer. Poured a deep amber color with a nice fluffy 2 finger cap which retains a good lace on the glass. Medium carbonation. Aromas of sweet crystal/caramel malts and grassy hops..very pronounced aromas. Full bodied beer...chewy toasty malts with spicy hopping that goes slightly drying in the finish and lightly bitter in the after taste. All in all this a good session beer...well made, quaffable, full bodied and satisfying."
"The ol standard, eh? Well, it did have a nice pour- amber /orange with a foamy tan head. Only a slight malt aroma. But the taste, not good. Not much in the way of malts or hop. Just some earthy, slightly bitter flavor. Kinda flat in the mouth. Boy, overall a dull & boring lager. Wasnt offensive, but didnt do anything for me."
"This is a unique and in my opinion an above average beer. Lots of character to it. The mouthfeel is moderate, almost creamy. I could have a good amount of this."
"12 oz. with no freshness date - served chilled in a pilsner glass. It is an orangey/caramel color with a 1/4"" light tan head that dissipates to nothing. Smells earthy with caramel. It is crisp with a medium body that tastes earthy with caramel, toasty/biscuity malts, and floral/spicy hops that leave a mild bitterness."
"The beer poured a fine amber with an eggshell head. The aroma was a blast of malt and floral hops. The taste was of hoppy malt with many floral and fuit hints in the finish. the feel was a full bodied beer that was fairly oily with a well proportioned hop finish. This was a pleasant experience I enjoyed the beer and it went well with the meal providing a nice counterpart to calimari and fish giving a good cleansing."
"This is one of my all time favorites. One of the first micro's I bought in CA. Pours a nice golden/amber color with a nice head, but does not last long, very light lacing if any at all. Nice malty scent with a great light taste. I really enjoy this beer, very drinkable."
"Appearance is reddish brown with a beige head of thick foam that lasts and sticks to the glass. Aroma contains loam and malt and brown sugar. Initial taste is a smack-down of bitter hops and citrus. So much flavor! Followed by a complex and fairly bitter finish that lingers, reminding you that there was a barley and malt explosion on your tongue, but a merciful lemon to cleanse the palate."
"Drinkability: Very good. Good taste without numbing the pallate. Good summer beer."
"Easy drinkable if you like bitter and burnt."
"Pours a neat orange/amber, with a fluffy white head and good lacing. Smell is citrusy hops, smells crisp. Taste is deep and malty, with a nice hop bitterness and a dry finish. Good malty aftertaste. Taste is nice and crisp, smooth and easy drinking, tasty beer."
"I keep finding flavors here that remind me of both Pale Ales and German-style Vienna lagers or richer Oktoberfestbiers. Very drinkable, enjoyable, and effortless in its session-ability. The rustic charm of grassy hops, strained yeast, and somewhat clumbsy brewing practices are also what gives this hybrid beer its charm."
"Light brown color, medium head. A medium bodied beer. Mild malts and hops. Nice malt sweetness, balanced by a nice hop spiciness. Mild taste. Good flavor. Mouthfeel is very full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. A simple well made beer. Classic style. """
"I have since seen the light. Anchor Steam is a wonderful beer. First of all, its bottle shape and label design are perfect, and once in the glass it looks about as beautiful as a beer can look. Perfect amber color, slightly cloudier than the Old Scratch, with a nice white head. It smells and tastes very creamy, feels full and soft, and is quite refreshing. Slight bitter aftertaste. I can see why this beer is a classic."
"Drinkability: Very good. This would make a nice session beer."
"An interesting blend of hops and malt, but the hoppy-bitter bite is a little harsh for my liking. The first time I had this was at a fish and chips joint in Crescent City, CA and went really well with my meal, but I've had it a few times since and can't say I'd consider it much more than an average session beer."
"Feels nice -- goes down smooth, highly drinkable."
"I know I'm in the minorty,but I just did not like this beer. For me, it was way to creamy tasting. I thought the head was never going to go away. There has been a lot of hype about this beer,and I guess is was expecting more. It was average at best."
"Sometimes, with all the beers a BA tries, some just get lost in the shuffle. This one reminded me of how much I liked it the first time around. Pours a amber with gold streaks, the head is creamy and 2 inches thick. The aroma is of summer fruit and light barley, hints of floral lace the nose. The taste is classic session, the floral aroma blends well with the creamy buttered malt, this is the ultimate summer beverage."
"Very nice session brew here. Pours a light amber with very light head. Taste is of currants and hops. You gotta love the tradition of this beer, being one of the first craft brews in the U.S. Rich in tradition and smooth taste, and possibly the best label of any beer, this one's a definite keeper..."
"one finger head grabs the side of the glass and hangs on respectably well. copper color. crisp fruity smell and taste. highly bittered dry finish. good stuff. i have tried with this one just sitting down with a beer and with several different types of food and this beer is much better with food."
"I haven't had this beer in probably 4 years and I forgot how refreshing it really can be. The first thing that became apparent is that the beer is a cross between an ale and a lager. The rounded fruity ale notes are complemented by the clean finish of the lager profiles. An American classic that is perfect for Summer."
"A very drinkable style."
"It's creamy smooth, seems medium-bodied and has a fine mouthfilling carbonation. Robust and refreshing. Absolute assertive excellence."
"This beer didn't seem to do it for me. I know Anchor pioneered the style and name ""steam beer"" which led me to believe this is the ultimate of the style; if so, then this style is not for me. I was left unimpressed, and don't think I'll try it again soon."
"Pours a dark amber color, with a creamy white head that dissapates slowly and leaves crazy lacing down the glass, a nice looking beer to be sure. Smell is dominated by malt with a grainy smell backed up by a fruity esters aroma, not really complex or inviting. Taste is a nice blend of malt and hops, this really is a unique beer and theres not really any other beer you could compare it to. The flavor is bready malt flavor with a light caramel sweetness and a lightly bitter floral hops finish. This beer has a full body and mouthfeel even though its a lager (kind of), and there is a lot of carbonation which makes the beer more refreshing. A unique american brew, not very complex but quite refreshing and a one of a kind brew."
"Drinkability: This would make a great beer to bring to a party where there would be people who drink something besides macros but may not be that knowledgable to open their perspectives to the world of good beer."
"Overall Impression: A good summer beer. Easy to drink, a little filling for a session, but I could see this being a crowd pleaser. Give it a try!"
"Drinkability is excellent, very crisp and flavorful, a nice replacement to your usual lager...you will not be disappointed!!! The end flavour on your tongue is quite bitter but if you like a hoppy beer you will fall in love like I did. A usual session beer for me when I have the money."
"One day I would like to try this closer to or at the brewery, because I imagine that when fresh the hops are that much more assertive and the beer tastes that much more crisp."
"A very good beer. Poured out to a dark orange / gold color with decent carbonation and a slighly pumpkin colored head that had some staying power. Odor was mostly hops, with a hint of lager like qualities, and a touch of corn. Flavor was solid, medium bodied, with a very nice complexity. Most noted taste was that of hops and barely, with a smooth maltiness detected. Finished slighly sweet, and a touch dry. A helluva good beer. Recommended."
"650 mL brown bottle with freshness code stamped on the rear label."
"Thin cream colored head quickly dissipates. Medium orange amber in color. Aroma is earthy and woodlike, hop aromas light. If I think really hard, I can almost smell the SLIGHTEST hint of amaretto. Carbonation level is right on. Plenty of bittering hops in the flavor, but not much as far as flavor goes. Not to say there is a lack of flavor, only somewhat as far as the hops go. Nice and clean and well balanced, with a nice lingering bitterness left behind. Good beer for hot summer nights."
"Drinkability: With so many beers to choose from, you forget to pay occasional homage to the craft brew that started it all - and this is a good one to set that standard"
"Overall, a nice beer -- I'd recommend it to friends looking for a change of pace from a macro lager, but nothing that I'd put on my favorites list. I will certainly buy this again (and I'd love to try it on-tap), but I won't be pining for it in the meantime."
" Still pretty tasty today."
"Drinkability: I wish it had more flavor, but it's definately easy to put down a few. I'd like to try this on draught sometime. Maybe that will open it up some."
"Taste is crisp malt and nice bittering hops. Nothing inhgerently ""hoppy"" about this brew, that is just what comes out first. Lightly fruity malt in the middle somewhere and way back there just hints of banana. Crisp mouth and nice dry finish. Well crafted and balanced. Lots of subtle complexities. An old favorite that is always nicely drinkable. Love it."
"Dark copper color with a 1 1/2"" tan head. Good retention. The smell while it is cold is just a waft of a little malt and citrus aroma. But as it warms up a bit the malt aroma sweetens to almost an candyish degree. Either way the taste is clean with a short-medium finish. There is a mellow caramel apple flavor to it. The drinkability is exceptional and it would pair well with a wide range of foods."
"The mouthfeel is medium-light with some carbonation tingles. Good session brew and/or dinner drink."
"Poured a clean, orangish color, with a pretty white head, not very thick, but it was there there, and still beautiful. Smelled of light malt and predominately of hops. There was a nice spice to the hops, but nothing as harsh as the IPA's I generally tend to drink. Disappeared very quickly, wasn't much of a session beer, I just drank it quickly, very quickly. I used to hate lagers, but this beer is teaching me not to be so judgemental towards the lager."
"Drinkability: Goes down like water down the drain. Easy to drink/pound/whack. Could easily drink 12-15 of these."
"This beer poured up a deep copper color that was lighter around the edges. A big fluffy head was generated and faded slowly while lacing the glass. The aroma is very subtle. Flavor is crisp with nice hop character. Finish is dry and clean. Leaves your mouth watering until the next sip. It's no secret why Anchor is a strong player in the market they virtually created. It makes for a great session beer. Perfect for a hot summer day."
"Taste is very smooth, some note of fruit, with a well balance malt and small hops, nothing very strong, just well balanced and smooth. Very good drinkability, nice beer going down very well."
"Nice, medium amber-colored beer with a short-lived 1/2"" head that stuck to the glass here and there. The light aroma of hops and malt turned into a moderately powerful bitterness on first sip that was nicely balanced by the bready, and even slightly fruity, malt flavors. As the beer warmed up, the fruitiness became more pronounced, but the hop bitterness still dominated. Finished crisp and clean, without a lingering aftertaste. Eminently drinkable, and a great beer with dinner."
"Mouthfeel is crisp at the start with a crisp, slightly dry finish. Extremely drinkable, and a perfect brew to enjoy with a pizza."
"Pours medium dark amber-brown with a short creamy head that quickly dissipates. Not much lacing, moderate to high carbonation. Not a lot in the nose, mostly barley, hops, and a hint of fruit. Taste starts off very empty, but flavors come out through the sip, ending with a rather sharp bitterness. Although the mouthfeel is smooth, the bitterness stands out and there is no counterbalance of other flavors. I'd like to try it on tap."
"This might not be the most drinkable beer I've ever had. It tastes good, but the bitter aftertaste has kept me from drinking more than one of these at a time."
"dry, sweet and crisp bready malt, with a tickle of bitterness at the end. very clean tasting and a bit spritzy. again a hint of fruit sweetness comes through but isn't very present. almost a bit of mustiness in the malt-- i think it's that earthy flavor, maybe the hops? great balance between bready malt and hop aftertaste. Super drinkable."
"Pouring a deep amber with an inch of thick off-white foam, Anchor Steam has slightly hoppy aroma. This beer has a sweet-malty taste and practically dances on the tongue. Anchor Steam has a good hearty mouthfeel without being too heavy. It is an extremely drinkable beer that I think would be an exceptionally good one to drink on a warm afternoon. Dare I say a ""steamy"" afternoon?"
"All 4's here. Orangey-amber-good carbonation action-small head that holds well. Malty buttery apples and hops. Some caramel taste too. Taste is dry and not as bitingly bitter as I remember-there is a nicely balanced malt/hops blend. Some slight fruitiness. Dry mouthfeel --quite smooth and drinkable."
"This is hands down one of the best crafted lager on the market, well worth the extra dollar. I can enjoy this brew any time."
"This is very enjoyable...accomplishes balance of flavors well, like Thai food (there even seems to be some saltiness. I would reach for another!"
"The hops delivered a decent degree of bitterness, but were rather one dimensional, and didn't mix well with the creamy malt. This is a combination which makes little sense to my palate."
"Worthy of a 4+ IMHO"
"The beer was an amber color with a generous frothy white head that stayed to at least a quarter inch through the pint. The smell was quite fruity and malty. I couldn't quite place the taste, but it was almost tropical. Like I said, quite delicious and refreshing at first, but towards the bottom of the pint it is damn nigh too much. I will probably drink more in the future, but I definitely couldn't foresee this being a session brew even though it is under 5% ABV."
"Pouring into a pint glass at about 50 degrees (F) it pours a deep amber color w/ 1 cm of frothy tan head w/ lots of cling to my glass. It also appears a little cloudy at first as well. Smell is of sweetness- cherries or raisins malts maybe. However, no hops or dark malts other than fruit, nothing too special. Smooth vanilla cherry flavors up front with some hops to it and then a little more hops on the finish; a little watery also and not too complex. However, this is a very decent beer to drink. Prickly carbonation that sticks to the tip of your tongue on the sip and then follows the contours of your tongue even after the swallow (lots of carb!). Light-medium bodied; mild and smooth and very easy to drink a whole lot of them!!"
"A nice brew by a great brewer."
"This poured a dark golden, sudsy head that diminished quickly, but left a collar all the way through, smell was a bit woodsy, with slight fruit aroma, taste is of well balanced mild hops and malt, bit of apple notes, and a bit spicy, mouthfeel is well carbonated, a bit of chewiness, but very mildly so, finishes very smooth, drinkability is excellent, this is a great session brew,I can't believe it has taken me this long to review this as I have had this many times now, I really like Anchor Steam a lot!!!"
"Drinkability and Overall: Again, Anchor has left me down. First the OSA 04, and now this. I have yet to try their Bigfoot barelywine, but I have one waiting for me in the cellar. Hopefully it's better than this bland beer."
"The mouth feel is pretty light and just a little creamy, and it goes down smoothly."
"First off, I love the way the beer produced one of the best heads of foam I've ever seen. The color of the beer was a nice dark copper. I liked the malty smell, and how the hops are only really distinctive in the taste. It also had a suprisingly somewhat creamy feel. Other than that, it would make a nice brew for a warm summer night."
"I do like this beer. One thing I can say is that there is no beer that is even close to it. Everyone says it is unique, and everyone is right. A great beer to have around; it shows what America is capable of brewing."
"Anchor Steam pours a deep copper with an average life off-white head. Its aroma is fruity: meyer lemon and grapefruit, with an essence of roasted malts and hops. The taste is a similarly complex balance of flavors with a quick bite of hops, sweet malts and a citrus finish. Mouthfeel is a little dry, which is good in my book. This beer's drinkability is better than most I've tried, regardless of style."
"Decent mouthfeel. without heavy carbonation. Has a little bit of body to it, it doesn't feel thin. This beer is quite drinkable, when finishing one it seems that another is a good idea."
"This beer is juuust right. A great session ale that goes down easy and doesn't rape your mouth,"
"A well made brew awaits you from Anchor Brewing, no skimping here, and not watery in the least. See it on the shelf, take it from the shelf and buy, it will not disappoint."
"Mouthfeel was a bit thin but that makes it all the more drinkable. A good session brew. I've never had this in the bottle, but I look forward to trying it."
"This is a lot different than what I remember from when I was in SF. For some reason I had the distinct memory of sour dough bread and not particularly liking it. But then again that was a few years ago and my tastes have changed since then. The beer poured out of the bottle with a finger-width head on top that dissappeared down to a thin film with a lace that clung to the sides of the glass. The color was a burnt, clear copper. The hops are not overly complex and roll over the tongue very smoothly. However, I did notice slight hints of lemon and sugar. But what gets me is how much smoother a beer it is now than what I remember."
"12 ouncer sampled. No freshness indication on the label. Pours a nice rich dark amber, with an off white creamy, dense head. Respectable lacing left behind. Sweet nose of caramel and brown sugar. Medium bodied, smooth malty base to this one, soft, creamy mouthfeel, very easy on the tongue. Smooth subtle hops in the finish, slightly dry very pleasant quafer/sessoner. Classic early/back in the day micro. thanks for the memories and for the fine suds for all these years!"
"Being the only steam beer I've had, this isn't that bad. It would probably be better during the summer rather than the winter."
"Overall: Very clean malty beer."
"This one is quite pleasing. Pours a dark copper color, could use a little more head. Despite this, I love this beer. The hops here have a perfect balance to the malt, and this beer has a crisp, refreshing aftertaste. Exceptionally drinkable. Like a pilsner, this would go with nearly any meal, yet it is more hearty and full bodied than that style."
"One of the best all around domestics around. Glad to see it at a cafe for $2.50 a bottle. Usually one of the more expensive six packs at the local grocery store. After reading the review by Michael Jackson 6 months ago, I knew I needed to try this famed steam beer. Loved it then and my feelings haven't changed now. Cannot compare to another steam beer, but the appreance is above average, nice head and carbonation (but seen better). Balanced taste just perfect. Would love to convert others that stick to their Coors, Bud Light and Miller Light. Try one today."
"As indicated by the smell, Big and malty up front. Is there something lemony/fruity there as well? Great dry grassy hop finish that balances out the malt perfectly. Mouthfeel is full and kinda creamy. This beer can be different from sip to sip. Lately when I have one of these the flavors all seem to run together rather, rather than having a beginning, middle, and end. Definately some lemony esters up front. One of my few fallbacks."
"Poured out a nice amber color with a 2 finger head ,slightly hazy appearance,,looks really good.Im impressed with the taste, has good amount of hoppiness and it goes down really smooth,,no aftertaste. I could see me havin a few of these and it sucks because i bought only one :("
"Pours out a nice copper color with good carbonation a a thick white head.Aroma is a mix of spicy hops and biscuity malt.Taste the definition of ""Balance."" A malty, creamy front end, with some toffee type notes, which gives way to nice dry bitterness to finish things off. Reminds me of HSA really. very good stuff, and worth the 8 bucks a sixer. Smooth & creamy mouthfeel, drinkablity is decent."
"Consumed in October 2004. Purchased at the local Safeway. Pours with a deep copper/amber color. I very nice head, which some was still remaining after it was gone. Very little lace, but not expected either. Smells of hops, malt, maybe a bit of citrus. A very unique beer in my opinion. Has that lager taste, but also has that IPA taste to it. Even has a bit of citrus taste in the mix. It goes down very smooth. A very easy beer to go through a six pack and still want more. Possibly my favorite session beer, or at least for a nice hot day after working or playing hard. This was the first beer I was introduced to while growing up. I remember swimming in Eagle Lake (Northern California) and doing a little snorkling and finding a bottle cap from an Anchor Steam bottle. I must have smelled it for days. It was such a facsinating smell to me. This was when I was about 7 or 8 years old. Ahhhh, good old memories. Too bad it took me almost 20 years from then to try my first."
"It smells earthy and a little bit stale, but after tasting it and enjoying the bread and butter mouthfeel, you can forgive the scent. It is perfect for a cooldown after an autumn bbq. I really love this stuff. Best on Tap at an Old Chicago with a slice of pepperoni pizza."
"Interesting style... it sort of combines the clarity and hoppiness of a lager with the head and maltiness of an ale. Pours a clear brown with a big foamy head which looks very good. Smell was nutty and hoppy. Taste was a sort of ""This is a lager?"" taste, nutty, with some roasted malts and a nice hoppy finish. This is a very interesting beer, sort of having multiple personalities."
"Tastes bready, with some hints of lemon and malt. Creamy, mouthfeel after the initial carbonation kick subsides. Highly drinkable, goes down very easily. A quality American classic."
"Fine beer, unique certainly (to what i have had), and better than I was expecting. Try it if you have not yet."
"Final Thought: Not as good as I expected, however I will drink this on occasion, buying it as a single, primarily for the beers' unique aspect."
"I hadn't had this in quite awhile, with all of the other more recent micros now out there. This is still an outstanding beer. It is a hazy, somewhat amber color. The aroma is somewhat floral with hop notes. The taste is slightly sour. Nice blance of malts and hops. One of the originals is still one of the best."
"All in all this is fairly good beer. It's definately unique, which I really enjoy and respect in general, but maybe it's just not my style."
"Poured as an amber color with a nice head that lasted awhile. My nose detected a hint of floral hops, otherwise there was nothing notable. Taste was nicely balanced between a hint of caramel with a light dry hop finish. Mouthfeel resulted in a nice clean finish. This is an extremely drinkable beer but one that is unremarkable in my book and not worth the normal high price tag commanded by this ""macro micro""."
"Nice caramel type color with a creamy head. Good hoppy taste, but oddly enough I'm even more drawn to it based on the appearance of the beer itself than the taste. Plus, very pretty packaging. Nice above average beer."
"Good-looking amber body with nice carbonation and finely laced 2 inches head, medium-lasting. Piny hops aroma with notes of perfumey caramel. Nice malt development in mouth, good balance. I like it more with every sips. It remains very light though with resin hoppy profile bringing a light bitterness. Well done and indeed got the lager light and refreshing smooth body which I liked."
"For me, this is an example of the sum of the parts doesn't quite add up to the whole. I can appreciate this beer in each area but I just don't love it or even like it a lot. I just like it a little."
"This beer pours with a cloudy brown color and a thin tan head that does not last long. The aroma is minimal with nothiong impressive besides the malty smell. Flavor consists of light roasted malts, breadiness, and a touch of non-distinct hops. It also ends with a bit of sourness. Overall this beer has nothing too distinct about it. It beats macro swill, but not by much."
"I haven't been drinking craft beer very long, and I came back to this one (after drinking ""bigger, better"" beer all summer long) not expecting much. I'm shocked to find that it tastes even better than I remembered. This is a truly great brew."
"Poured an golden orange colour, with a creamy, off white head. This beer is very carbonated. It's clean and crisp like a lager, and fruity like an ale. Kind of 'woody', with a clean malt character. It's got a bitter aftertaste. Dry finish. A good session beer."
"Pours an amber color with an adequate light beige colored head. Malty, earthy and grassy in the aroma, a slight bit diacetyl and further mineral-like qualities in in the water content. Slightly malty sweet, yet astringent from the malt and backed with a further dulled astringency from the hops. A bit fruity in the whole hop/malt balance, but if you know the brewing history behind a ""Steam"" (trademarked) or California Common beer, you'll understand why this beer had pushed the envelope at one time when it came to small-batch brewing. It since had become a U.S. classic, and rightly so. It is very crisp and enjoyable."
"A truly excelent and enjoyable brew. This beer poured a good looking amber color with a nice white head that clung to the glass and left slight lace till the end. The smell was good with a nice earthy malt character. The taste was superb with a nice citrus bite in the beginning, a carmel like maltiness as it washes over your mouth and a great dry citric aftertaste. A unique beer indeed and a great session brew as well."
"It pours a copper color with a big tight bubbled head and just a little bit of lace. The aroma is sweet and biscuity, with floral notes. The taste is very interesting. It starts out with a hit of hop bitterness that quickly leads into a sweet, biscuity almost honeyish feel. There isnt much of a finish other than lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel of this beer is a little watery. Its not superlative, but still a very interesting, quaffable beer."
"A good little beer, not on par with the liberty ale but none the less, might have been served a little too cold in the bar i had it in"
"Very smooth to drink, classic in style and flavor. A very likable and drinkable American ale."
"Beer is good. Happy historical beering."
"The aroma is kind of nutty with a sweet smell in there. The taste is nutty and slightly malty, but only a trace of a hop prescence. Mouthfeel is good and smooth, almost too smooth, though. Overall, a good beer to enjoy anytime."
"I had to try Anchor Steam since it is one of the few American classics. Appearance is a dark copper with medium-sized, creamy head. Smell is clean, slightly hoppy, with a note of sweetness. Taste is nicely balanced. Mild malts and hops combine for a fairly complex taste. Slight citrus taste is noted on the edges of the sip. Thankfully, Anchor Steam is a full-flavored brew that doesn't feel too heavy for high drinkability. Overall, I really liked this beer, but didn't find it to be the most exciting style around. Anchor Steam is a must-try though, it's not often you find the originator of a style of beer."
"This Anchor is a very unique and respectable beer. I'll have it again as a change up or sampler but I prefer the porter/liberty ale."
"Amber/brown color with a creamy head. Left some nice lacing on thw glass as it went down, and it went down FAST. Very smooth tasting. Very well-balanced hops and malts. Sweet and bitter tasting, yet is not rough on the palate. A truly unique beer that goes down way too easy. A must try!"
"This is a clean amber ale with afizzy white heat that disappears quickly. The beer has a light sweet malty aroma. The malt flavor promised in the aroma gives way to an assertive hop bitterness before giving a crisp clean finish. A tasty drink for when you're having more than one."
"All I can say is that this is one quality beer. A standard in the craft beer market and always welcomed by me when I see it on tap at a bar. It might be a tad overpriced for a 6 pack. I think a 6 pack goes for around $8.39 or usually higher, but this is a solid product and a true session beer."
"The beer is clear, dark amber with a big, yellow-tan, foamy, active head that collapses crustily. It leaves soap-film runny lacing. Fruit and crackers in the nose. A fruity, bitter front. A light, fruity middle showing some caramel. A nutty, fresh, bitter finish. A little tea. Hoppy aftertaste. This is a nice, fresh, hoppy, light beer. A good dinner beer."
"Pours a dark amber with a 2 finger, thick head which stuck around for quite a while. I recognized immediate sweet malt smells with just a touch of hops. The taste is nice and balanced - malty, even nutty maybe followed by a bit of bitterness from the hops; it's a smooth, easy drinking beer. It seems to be a little overly carbonated and maybe that adds an interesting, individual characteristic to it; I'm not sure. At times, I felt like I couldn't find my way through the bubbles to get a good grip on some other lesser tastes though. It's still very drinkable, tastes pretty good and obviously, very popular as a result."
"Much different and better on draught!"
"Out of the bottle, it has a small, albeit sharp bite. Fairly dry but smooth in your mouth, easy to swallow. The aftertaste lingers but doesn't bother you and seems to invite you to take another pull. I don't recall any specific flavors coming out, which makes me think it is benign but I know there is a lot to it. Perhaps it is the maltiness slightly surrounding the other nuances in it. It is a beer worth taking the time to savor. I should have done that more tonight."
"The head is dense and regular and faded quickly; the body is of a red amber color. The smell is very malty and reminded me mostly of sweet watery caramel. Almost porto like. A bit yeasty, showing also a fruity character, maybe sweet strawberries. Also a chestnut aspect and a very dry floral note of straw. Interesting. The taste shows caramel but mostly a sweet winy/porto-like fruitiness, oaked and viscuous. Some sweet citrus too. A thick and dry hoppiness reveals a mint and chocolate character. The mouthfeel is quite pronounced, but maybe the accent on the hops is a bit over the top. Maybe a bit too thick to be highly drinkable."
"Poured out a nice orangish reddish color with a puffy off-white head. head was chunky in parts and left a fair amount of lacing on the glass. i didnt get much of a smell from this beer, a slight flowery scent with a bit of bitterness maybe. Taste was well balanced. A nice bitter hop bite at the beginning, but got sweeter as it warmed up. finished dry and tasty. A nice brew that is very smooth drinking. this would be a nice beer to have any time of the day. clean, refreshing, and different. Jay enjoyed this one."
"Good appearance, dark amber color and big head. No single, overwhelming smell... mostly just clean, dry, a little malt, maybe a little hops. Taste is rather nondescript as well, maybe just a little grain, except for a strange, slightly bitter aftertaste. I like a good bitter, but this is either too bitter or not bitter enough, it just doesn't seem to work for me. However, this is my first of the style, so take that into consideration. Good drinkability, it goes down smoothly, but I just can't say I'd want to buy another one."
"Notes: This is a solid beer. It doesn't have bold flavors, and it's not high in alcohol so it would be a good style to consume a few of. The mouthfeel is nice and the beer is pleasant to drink."
"Color was copper with a nice amount of carbonation. Smell was quite clean but some of the malts really showed up in the aromas. They were a little bit more rich than the bottle verison. Taste was a little bit of a let down. It focused more on the earthy tones than anything. I was expecting more of a hop/malt combination just like the bottle verison, but it was mostly earth tones. Not bad by any means, but I would of liked to see some more flavors in there."
"i've been waiting to have this beer for a long time. it has a sweetness to it that usually goes along with high abv ales, but this one is under 5%. so i cant figure that out. a little too malty and sweet for me to love it, though i can surely taste that is made of quality beer goodness :) it has a good amount of hops but the malts over power them. the color and appearance are very pleasing."
"Still, a good beer and one to add to your tasting list when you can find it."
"Slightly hazy copper color with firm, fluffy head which later broke into chunks and stuck to the glass, nice lacing. Malty smell, with earthy slightly nutty, uniquely woody undertones. Taste was very much like an amber lager with a hint of fruitiness, consistent with the beers' hybrid nature, very flavorful and complex. Hops were firm but in no way overbearing, nicely balanced. Very easy to drink many of these fine beers."
"This beer seemed highly drinkable to me, and great with the chicken gumbo I was eating."
"Pours out a light copper with an off-white head. It built a good head readily, and eventually settled to about a 1/4 inch thick... still hasn't totally disappeared. Smells somewhat of sweet malt and fruity esters. Better smell than most beers I've reviewed so far. Tastes great! Immediate bitterness, balanced by smooth malt and fruity flavors. Finishes dry with a lingering bitterness...not too much, but enough to let you remember you've had a great beer. Mouthfeel also very good. Just enough carbonation to keep it light, but still feels substantial enough for my dark beer tastes. This is definitely a beer I can drink over and over again... a wonderful offering!"
"D&N: This a beer unlike any other. The taste is familiar, but with something extra that really makes this beer shine. I haven't finished a beer this quickly in a long time, but it's just so tasty that I ""reviewed"" it in about twenty minutes. Highly recommended."
"on of the boldest lager beers i can think of, unique and full of character. i don't know if i'd always reach for this first, but i think it will always stick out in my mind. another winning original."
"Nice rich color with a moderate head, a complex taste that says ""this is beer, and good beer too"". It doesn't try to be anything else other than a very good beer."
"This is a good one for those new to the microbrew scene to cut their teeth on."
"Overall this is a very solid beer and the availability is a very good thing if you're stuck somewhere you can't get much else."
"Had on tap at the Cactus in Newport News, VA. Came to me in a glass with a nice amber color, but not much head in sight due to its pouring is my guess. A nice clean aroma with malt sweetness and notes of citrus detectable. A light toasted malt flavor is accompanied by a sweet taste and a slight bitterness. Definatly a lot of lager charecteristics to this beer. A little too thin in the mouthfeel and a very smooth drink. It has a slightly unusal flavor the is complex enough to keep you interested and makes for a good summer brew."
"Hmm, good beer in the Congo. Anchor Steam poured an amber colour, with a big three finger head. After a few minutes, the head went away, just leaving a small amount of foam. Lacing coats the glass like a curtain. Very pleasant. Sweet smell of malt(vienna?), banana, citrus, hop, and more malt. Sweet tasting, with enough of a bite to be satisfying. Little overcarbonated mouthfeel, but that's forgivable. Highly drinkable. A good session beer, and my first beer of this style."
"Anchor Steam Beer was served from a 12 oz. bottle. In a pint glass, the beer was a clear and vibrant orange amber and was topped by an ample white head that left thick sheets of lacing. The nose was crisp yet bready sweet with notes of banana, complemented by a nice resiny/citrus hop bouquet. The taste opened with smooth bready-citrus malts, followed by a spicy-zippy grapefruity bitter transition to a citrus zesty banana-tinged spicy, moderately bittered finish. The body was a little too thin for the flavors and character of the beer, but otherwise was appropriate. Anchor steam was a satisfying and tasty beer, with some uniqueness to add to the interest."
"Sampled 2/1/04"
"Pours a nice, fluffly head that eventually dissipates into an assertive cloud cover. Amber colored. Smells like basic beer: that Budweiser, Miller, Pabst scent. Starts with a malty (no roast) blank creaminess and ends with plenty of hops. A conversation-enabling beer: pleasant enough to go unnoticed."
"This is a great beer. It's unusual flavor sets it apart from other beer. Very easy to drink... Overall it's great."
"Drinkabilty: No thanks. This is worth sampling, but the old bitterness make it bad in my book. I will sample this again to make sure I didn't get a skunked one, but I maintain that this beer has a low drinkability."
"This beer is unique and it has a beautiful character. I definitely enjoy this brew a lot, the price is pretty steep in my area though. I will definitely have to have a craving for this beer in particular to shell out the $11 for a six pack when compared to many other brews that I enjoy as much. I definitely owe a lot of respect to the history of this beer for helping to kick off the craft beer movement in the U.S. I will definitely drink again."
"Pours golden with a 3/4"" light tan head, which fades fairly quickly but leaves a nice lacing on the side of the glass. Not much of an aroma at all, but what is there smells ""like beer""...slightly hoppy and slightly malty. It smells like what you remember beer smelling like as a child. As the beer hits your tongue, there is a slight hop bitterness. As you begin the swallow, the bitterness changes to a malt presence that is not sweet. The bitterness reappears for the aftertaste. This is a rather strange blend. It is not my favorit beer, but it is very satisfying in warm weather and also when served with just about any meal. It is very drinkable."
"Anchor Steam is fully deserving of its reverence."
"This is like no other beer I have tried. An excelent brew."
"Poured into a tumbler, this honey amber brew grew a bubbly white head. The grain aroma, with it's subtle yeast accent, was inviting. The rolling malt flavors started grainy but became sweet and syrupy, only to lead to a crisp finish. The hop spicing provides some interesting counter point, and makes the brew an excellent pair with a bowl of chilli. The mouth feel is fair, at times a little too syrupy, but otherwise this is a drinkable beer that will likely return to my fridge."
"This is an American classic. The somewhat unusual, non-genre specific flavor might not appeal to all, but it's a well-made, enjoyable brew."
"Light amber body with a creamy long lasting tan head. Aroma is sweet malt, brown sugar, and floral with an enticing hoppiness. Taste is caramel malt and some spiced hops. Earthy flavor comes through strong but it's not overpowering. Nice lingering grainy aftertaste. Carbonation a little high. This brew went down surprisingly easy. I would love to try this one on tap. This is a step above their Liberty Ale in my opinion."
"Very smooth and a little creamy. Good stuff to drink, I could drink it on tap all day, but from the bottle it benefits from a bit of a chill."
"This is a staple in Northern California, and a beer I can remember people drinking around me since my early years. Pours a gorgeous copper/amber color with an average, fizzy off-white head and some solid, sticky lacing. The aroma is strong and sweet with some green hops tang underneath and a note that reminds me of banana...though this is not nearly as bizarre as it sounds, and in fact imparts yet another distinctive aspect to an already unique brew. The taste is likewise singular. I get a big maltiness in the beginning that is masterfully balanced with a healthy dose of grassy hops that keeps the brew on the bitter side. The finish is citrusy and slightly minerally, with a hint of the same exotic banana note that is hinted at in the nose. The mouthfeel is good and chewy but refreshing as well. Drinkability is practically unparalleled. This is a must try and a true American icon of a brew."
"Flavor is satisfying with some slightly roasted malt and smooth but crisp, sharp hop bitterness, and lingering bitter aftertaste. Average mouthfeel for a non-macro, not thick. Good drinkability due to the smooth malt and sharp hop character."
"I had forgotten how much I liked this beer before I picked some up at the store this weekend. Appearance was a shade of copper, with a respectable head. The aroma has a pleasant fruity smell to it, along with a slightly burnt malty smell. The taste, mouthfeel and drinkability, are good to very good. This is by no means a ""heavy"" beer nor a ""light"" beer, to me, it has an almost perfect balance that makes it not only tastey, but very drinkable - something that I think is not easily achievable in the brewing world. This is one of the breweries and beers that revitalized the craft-brewing industry in America, and it's still making a statement some 30+ years later. If you haven't tried this beer, this humble reviewer highly recommends it!"
"A very fine beer, I have converted a couple people to good beer with this and still enjoy it myself."
"Earns at least 4 out of 5 swills in my opinion."
"It is drinkable and true."
"While Anchor is a flagship of American brewing this brew does not do much for me but I love Anchor for doing it as it has provided a stepping stone into the craft brewing world. I cut my teeth on this beer so to speak and still revisit it from time to time. The beer pours a light amber color with a clear head. The smell is nothing spectacular but then again, it's not offensive either. Its taste is initially interesting as the hops struggle to let presence be known. As the bottle is finished it leaves you with just an average feeling. This beer is tons better than BMC but again, it does not do much for me. I must salute Anchor for being a pioneer though and this beer definately has its place in my fridge for the occasional BBQ or for my as of yet to be BA friends"
"I'd easily choose this over a Bud or Miller, but I don't think I'd seek this out. I do, however, see how this gained popularity back when an American microbrew was a novelty. This would probably be a great gateway beer to lure someone away from macroswill to quality beers!"
"12 ounce bottle."
"If any beer was ever properly described by the word ""suds", this is it. It's a great standby to have waiting in the refrigerator."
"After finishing one I was a slightly disappointed. It may have been due to all the expectation and hype I have heard about this famous beer. One consideration to take from my review is that I live in Cleveland, Ohio so this beer may not have been in the best condition. I will definitely be giving this beer another try. Everyone must try an Anchor Steam beer at least once."
"I have had a renewed love affair with Anchor the last month or so. Since returning to my ""roots"" I thought I should re review this classic that is responsible for the micro revolution, it also started me in to the world of quality beer. This beer is a medium amber, head retention and lacing are excellent. Fresh malty and grainy aroma is prominent. Smooth, rounded, refreshing and a tad dry. Some caramel notes, Good hoppy bite. A totally drinkable beer, good year round."
"ng"
"Super drinkable, mild yet flavorful."
"If you've never had this classic beer, try one. It's distributed just about everywhere, and it's generally affordable. Anchor Steam has a lot of interesting history behind it, as does the entire Anchor Brewing Company. It's right powerfull stuff, and it's fun to learn the background of this great American beer. I'm glad I had the opportunity to spend some time with this old friend."
"The finish was long and bitter and the beer dried out a bit at the very end. The mouthfeel was firm, seamless and smooth. Anchor Steam is a true American classic."
"Pours a clear, copper amber with a small beige head that retains well, and leaves lots of patchy and sheet lacing. Nose is subdued, but is a nice balance of fruity hops and caramel malt. Mouthfeel is well carbonated with a moderate hops bite. Good, well rounded taste that is dominated by lager style malts. Plenty of fruity and floral hops for balance. A very friendly drinking American classic that is deserving of its reputation in the history of 20th century American brewing. Exceptional drinkability."
"I had a pint of this last night and I was a little taken aback. I've had this in a bottle before, but I decided to try it on tap (especially after trying the Anchor Steam Xmas brew--excellent!!) This beer pours a medium orange-brown and had a faint musty smell. The taste was different. Certainly not what I remembered. I sort of think I had some pulled from a really old keg, because it just felt flat, and had macro-like thinness. I know this isn't a thick beer, and I noted light citrus notes of orange or something, but again it just felt 'off'. There were very faint hops, and decent malt, but again, not what I wanted. I'll try to re-review with a well kept bottle, but as it stands, I would not order this on tap again (at least not where I got it last time)"
"Clear amber hue, thin bubbly white head. Weak aroma of hops, malts, barely noticeable. Creamy, sweet, sweet malts off the bat, backed by somewhat of a light grainy touch. Hops dominated palate; medium bodied. Dry finish, little aftertaste going on here. Perhaps a yeasty end, again hops-dominated palate. Not as good as I remember, somewhat subdued flavorings, nothing to really get your attention. Average across the board."
"A very clear light copper with a whitish head with impressive creaminess and retention. A bright sting of hops, but surprisingly not cascades in this californian brew. It smells like a German variety along with bready buttery malt. Flavor is a nice fight between the hops and caramel malt - the hop flavor and bitterness rides all the way through, although I find the finish is slightly harsh. The body is too heavy to be a session brew of mine, and the tingly carbonation is not that great. Despite the rich history, I find this brew to be pretty forgetable. Good hop flavors accompany a decent caramel malt body with a subpar feel. An average beer."
"This is a very easy to drink beer, and even though it isn't the most complex brew in the world it is certainly an interesting one. I wouldn't mind having this with some ""finger foods"" such as mozzarella sticks, potato skins, buffalo wings, etc. Fritz did the beer drinking world a service by saving the Anchor Brewery, and I'll salute him by drinking a few of these anyday."
"Deep amber color, with a great head. Smells simultaneously fruity, tangy and malty. This possesses a bitter taste, though deep and malty, and with an aftertaste that is even more bitter. Not surprisingly, this was rather complex, and an impressive example of a truly unique style."
"Not a bad beer and perhaps my rating is a bit lower than it would have been if I hadn't heard so many good things about this beer. I tried this beer for the first time in Northern California. It pours a very nice orangish-red type of color. The smell isn't very overpowering. The taste initially is very good but then it gives a bit of a dry aftertaste to which I wasn't a fan of. Its a better beer than most of the things you will find in most local bars. I would try this again but not anywhere where they have a good selection of beers."
"Despite the absence of flavor, this is a drinkable beer. All other elements of the beer brought up its rating. I would try this again."
"A copper colour with a thick head that had real staying power and ended in a pretty lace. The smell was sweet and malty. The taste had a bready quality to it. Also sweet. It went down pretty smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. A good beer to enjoy with friends or at the bar."
"Cheers"
"Good sized frothy and rocky white head. Clear copper in color. The head is quite sticky and reduces very slowly, holding onto the sides of the glass until it eventually becomes a thin lace. Mild aroma that is a bit different (cant quite put my finger on it) yet hops are fairly apparent. Nice smooth medium mouthfeel. Bready malt start with a caramel notes. Nice hop finish that is a bit dry and lasts a good length of time. Some slight lemon notes are noticeable. Great highly drinkable, well balanced brew. I really liked this one. Not an overly complex brew, but a great one that Ill be buying again."
"Anchor Steam is a good beer, especially for those who enjoy hops."
"The beer pours a reddish gold color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is good. It is of sweet malts and a mild hops; very aromatic. The taste is good. It is dry and malty. It has a bit of a watery finish, but all in all it's pretty good. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer; an excellent sessions ale."
"Light-medium feel with good carbonation feel, an easy drinking session beer. Thank you Mr. Maytag"
"Overall, quite frankly 1 of the best beers ever!!! A beer that yo can slowly savor or drink several of hanging out. A beer that you can always rely on!!!"
"Very friendly on the taste buds; high on the drinkability scale. The amount of flavor is ""just right"" for a session brew: solid quality, but I could go through several of these without thinking about them."
"Pours deep amber color with a white and highly fomaed head. Aroma is fairly heavily hopped with whiffs of caramel malt in the background head. Taste is sticky caramel followed by a rush of medium hop bitterness. For some reason this beer is much better wih food for me. It seems to compliment so many beers and only conclusion I have is that s some very complex tastes that just aren't picked up until you add food to the mix."
"Best steam beer period. Amber color with white creamy oam head. Toasty salty malt, and above average hops and carbonation which makes it drinkable and popular. Subtle citrus & carmel. candy floss aroma. Lingering aftertaste. Unique. Fills you up and can be before food and then with the meal."
"Overall not a bad beer."
"This one poured a clear copper with a good sized light tan head. The smell was more floral than anything but a little on the weak side. The taste was odd in the fact that the hops came first then the malts. Very crisp and lemony in initial taste. Floral hops come through later. A bready, woody malt flavor follows up the hop taste and holds on through the finish. Not much steam or smoke flavor really but there was something slightly different about the body of this beer. Whatever it is this is a very easy one to drink all night long."
"I picked up a 22 oz. bottle of this stuff at some municipal liquor store. I think it might have been a little old, but nothing bad. Pours a nice gold-copper color, with a little white lace. The taste is full and malty, with a little hops in the aftertaste. A good anytime beer."
"Appearance is a clear light amber/copper. White head that dissipates rapidly. Taste is sweet and hoppy with a semi dry finish.Some fruit and citrus undertones in the finish as well.Mouthfeel is a little watery, but creates a bit more drinkability in the brew. An interesting style and a must try on tap."
"A strong offering. What really grabs me about this beer is the unique style it represents, something uniquely American, a status quite difficult to attain in the beer world."
"Nothing outstanding to look at but backed up by an earthy aroma with hints of sharp citrus (lemon?/grapefruit?) and a slight sweetness. A light toasty flavour with a nice hop balance. Very easy drinking ."
"The smell of this brewwasquite malty. It poured into a light amber color into my glass. Very malty flavor as well, also bitter for a beer of this type. The beer was too bland for me. I prefer liberty ale if going with this brewer...at least that has some flavor. However, I would rather drink something from Victory."
"Pours an amber-copper color with a small off-white head. Smells of sweet bread malts, with a barely detectable hop accent. Taste starts with the bread malts, but is quickly overshadowed by some rather unexpected medicinal, and sprucy hops. Finish is bitter with lingering maltiness. Not as watery as expected, and rather drinkable."
"poured a light amberish gold,virtually no head to speak of,had a little bit of a feed bin grain aroma, but thats it.It had a pleasant enough sweet and hop taste, nice but somewhat thin malt hop balance and goes out with a distinct hop aftertaste. Smoother and sweeter than the macros, about the best I can say for it."
"This was one of my first introductions to good beer and has always been a fall back brew for me. Just had to review it as it is simply a classic. After a few tastes to review I paired it up with a few slices of colby-jack cheese... absolutely wonderful!"
"Overall, a pretty tasty beer. Rather unique taste and good balance make for easy drinkability. Doesn't push the envelope as far as taste goes. A good starter beer for someone needing to be weaned off of macros."
"Taste is subjective and all that, and this beer didn't do too much for me. It starts off well with a nice head which quickly goes down to a lace. It has a nice amber color. The smell is nothing special, but not bad. Same for the taste. As others have mentioned, it has a bite and has a nice hop finish. The hops finish isn't really balanced against any other flavor so the finish ends up distracting from the final taste. It seems to have not much of a taste until the aftertaste. I'm not unhappy with this beer, but it doesn't satisfy me either. This is the only beer I've tried within the ""steam"" style."
"Pours a hazy burnt orange, mild carbonation, with an off white head. Quite pleasing to the eye. The nose was malt and hops, with some spice and citrus. Quite a nose full. Smells good. Tastes like malt, salt, light hops bitterness and some citrus. A little bit on the sour side with the aftertaste. Really unique. Smooth and oily mouthfeel. Clings to everything. All around very unique. Definately something I would pick up again, but not something I'd want to drink every day."
"Drinkability: A session beer that could satisfy a hophead, a maltoid, and a new convert to good beer. It has something for the first two to like, and won't scare the newbie."
"The 22 oz. bottle pours a big foamy head atop an amber body. First sips are sweet without being cloying. A slight impression of pear nectar. A bitter hop taste in the back of the mouth mars an otherwise clean finish (or enhances it, as your preference may be). Midway through, I get a more hearty or ""rough"" hoppy smell and taste, ending with a more malty profile as it warms. This does have the signs of being a ""frontier"" beer with its western American hop profile, but a great session beer."
"What a beautiful thing. A real treat for any beer lover. I'm gonna try cooking with it."
"A solid ""above average brew."" The beer pours a medium golden with a good creamy head. Aromas of malt dominate as they do in the mouth. The texture is fine with a round medium bodied feel. The taste is pleasantly malty, and almost a tad sweet. A little fruitiness can be found as well. A nice tuesday night beer that happens to work better as a food beer than a sipper to me. I served this with halibut in parchment paper using lots of vegetables an Asian flavors. Delicious, and the beer was just right. This is a solid workhorse beer that is priced right and delivers nicely."
"Dark orange/amber in color with a fizzy but defined head. A citrus, hop aroma with some other things going on here as well...sulfur? Taste is very unique. Smooth malts, crisp hops with a citrus hop characteristic. I can't do the taste description justice here. Everyone should try this one. Lasting flavors, very nice drinkability. Too bad there are not more beers out there like this...maybe Anchor should release their copyright of the term ""Steam Beer""...?"
"Flavor: it tastes crisp clean flavor. Nothing spectacular, but not bad. I'm sure that before the growth of microbrews that this beer really stood out. Now, it's pretty middle of the road."
"I always thought this was one of those ""egend"" beers whose name is bigger than its taste....I was wrong...this is a great session beer along the lines of a solid amber or marzen....unique and tasty..."
"This beer has an enticing copper color and pours with a light beige head. There is not a huge amount of aroma to it, it smells clean, malty and a bit of floral grassiness to it. A light sweet/ malty taste up front that finishes with a good bitterness. This beer is about perfect balance between the hop and the malt. Just a wonderful beer that, because of its popularity/ availability, of the gets short shrift. In my mind this is one of the great everyday drinking beers."
"Had this on tap at the local pub. It pours a nice golden color with a medium head and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is a little hoppy, but the wheat is very prevalent in the nose. Nice aroma. The flavor is a littly malty, a little hoppy, and a little sweet. Great blend of tastes. It is very easy to drink and I think it is a great Summer beer. I've had this several times again and it hasn't disappointed."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a dark copper color with two fingers of head that stay along for the ride. There is some lacing left on the glass. The smell is grassy, piney, and malty. A very nice aroma that fills the nostrils. The taste starts out with a light bit of sweet malt and caramel. The taste ends grassy and a little hoppy. A very well balanced beer. The mouthfeel is just a little light, not too bad. The drinkability is very nice, as this isn't even 5% abv. Too bad others don't make this style."
"I have never tried this on tap and its been awhile since I have had this period so I figured to give it a try yesterday and review it again this time on tap.Pours a deep copper color with light to medium head,a lighter aroma is sweet with a lingering hop presence.The taste is nice and balanced of sweet caramel malt and a dry fruity finish,a very sold American beer a real cant miss selection in my mind."
"M"
"Comments  The sour twang keeps this one off of my, favorites, list, but its interesting and unique."
"Fairly clear orange-copper tone with an eggwhite head, tightly pulled together and with excellent retention. A solid ring with a nice film remains even after a lengthy meal spent slowing enjoying it. Aroma is faint and pleasantly simple. Distinctly natural, even herbal. Grainy flavor with a lively, massaging mouthfeel. Just a good, solid beer."
"i hadn't had an anchor steam in quite some time and thus had forgotten what a great beer this is. pours a simply awesome ruby colour with a just-right head, and a just-right carbonation balance. everything is simply wonderful about the look of this brew. smells of malt and i detected a bit of caramel as well, which can be tasted as well, along with a bunch of other flavours, including spice, citrus, and some saltiness perhaps. this is a slightly creamy brew that is just incredibly easy to drink. i highly recommend it, and it is usually pretty easy to find."
"When poured, this beer had a medium sized off-white head along with fine-small bubbles that quickly diminished.The body was carbonated and clear.The hue was orange and the nose of this beer was medium malty.The lacing was good on the sides of my glass.The flavor had a bitter fore and aftertaste that lingered.The mouthfeel of this beer was smooth and thin."
"This beer is well balanced and may be a good cross over brew for those who are prone to drink weak flavored beverages."
"Extremely nice clear reddish/amber colour with a white head that disapear not too quickly. I can smell some spice. Taste is bitter with some roastiness. I was little bit surprise considering the colour of the beer but I enjoyed it very much. I can't wait to try other Anchor products!"
"Passable, but unremarkable to my mind."
"It either does not travel well (from SFO to Tulsa) or is overrated. It has a typical copper-amber color as most pale ales do and a slight head, as you'd find on an American lager. it is a fairly balanced brew but none of the malt or hop characteristics stand out. it finishes with a lingering bitterness that is expected. I'm wondering if the problem was with me, I'd had this beer before (in the bottle) several years ago in San Francisco and liked it ok, but this was a let-down. I'll try it again on-tap when I know my palate is not compromised."
"Poured from a 355ml brown bottle with freshness date on back label. Opened it with a brass anchor bottle opener. I like the look of these bottles, and that's definitely one of my favorite logos of all time. Colour is a beautiful light amber, big foamy white head that subsides to a thin layer, some lacing as well. Nose contains caramel toasted malt, some sweet butteryness, some citrus, and rounded by floral hops. Smooth buttery toasted malt flavour, well rounded hop finish. Feels very creamy in the mouth. This is one very smooth beer, like a velvet glove encased in glass."
"Though the body is nice and full, the carbonation is somewhat lacking. Anyhow, it's a very respectable beer. I like it."
"One of my all-time favorite beers. A class of its own. Love it in the bottle with that crisp spicy taste; love it on tap where it's a little mellower. It has that briny taste that makes me think of San Francisco. Simply one of the most unique beers on the planet and a delight to drink..."
"Medium white head atop an amber beer with streams of carbonation cascading upwards. Aroma is a bit estery with enough hops and malt to balance the flavors. Sweet taste is complimented by a good amount of hops and the esters make one think of a style that is not quite an ale. Very smooth for an ale(?) with a good balance of flavors. Mouthfeel is of medium weight but not so much as to take away from the clenliness. Very good beer that i would enjoy on a hot day fishing a stream in the mountains."
"Pours a nice copper color with a rich white head, lots of carbonation. Slight fruit and nut smell , with a slight hint of malt and alot of hoppiness. The flavor of the beer is great, very nice balance between malt and hop with a slight bitterness to the finish. Small amounts of citris seem present here, along with some nut flavors, possibly almond. Overall this is a very good beer, nice character, and very smooth to drink. Not sure if it is worth the price I had to pay for a 6pk of it, but still good either way."
"Pours with an ivory colored head settling over clear deep amber liquid with ample carbonation. The nose is fresh sweet maltiness tempered with flowery hoppiness. Taste is crisp with sweet crystal malt-like notes, bready/biscuity flavors and a clean slightly minty hoppiness rounds out things. Finishes on a bitter and fruity note, very distinctive & very drinkable!"
"Fruity, honeyish odor, not unlike a Fuller's ESB. Mouthfeel is surprisingly thick and creamy. Taste starts out sweet and honeyish, gets thicker in the middle, with a nice, mildly hoppy finish. I found this to be a very enjoyable beer, and could probably put away several at a sitting."
"Good coppery color...Nice head that dissipates quickly. Smell was a nice malty aroma. Taste was excellent..a bit of sweetness followed by the the right amount of hops.. a nice balance. Mouthfeel was solid with a smooth feel, but still robust enough. Drinkability was excellent...extremely smooth going down...almost too easy to finish this 22 oz. offering."
"Pour is a light amber/copper, small white head quickly diminishes and leaves very minimal lacing. Aroma is sweet, lightly fruity, with some hops sneaking in the end. Flavor starts sweet, maybe slightly bready in the middle, and a good hoppy ending. I remember liking this more before than I seem to now."
"Why did I wait so long to try this good old beer..its a great drinkable beer, simple yet great quality!"
"Light brown color, medium head. A medium bodied beer. Mild malts and hops. Nice malt sweetness, balanced by a nice hop spiciness. Mild taste. Good flavor. Mouthfeel is very full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. A simple well made beer. Classic style."
"Pours a amber/copper color with a nice foamy white head. Decent lace sticking to the glass. Smells lightly hoppy. Carmel malt with a touch of hops with an earthy, grainy taste. Light to medium body. This is a good session beer. It also goes great with food. Anchor Steam is a great classic American microbrew. Any beer lover should certainly taste one. It is a great beer to revisit now and again."
"This beer poured a dark amber in color and top off with a decent white head. The head gave way to a decent lace. The aroma is malt and musty yeast with a hint of hops. The taste matches the aroma with a nice hop finish at the end. I would call this a medium body and very easy to drink. Very nice!"
"For the most part a nice drinking experience but not one that i would call memorable."
"golden red in color. there wasn't much of a head. I didn't notice much a smell to this beer, it may have been just that it was in a resturant and there was a lot food smells around, but this beer didn't have a very distinctive smell to it. The taste was a pleasant surprise after taking a whiff and not noticing much. it was well balanced with caramel malts and hops. I noticed it was also very spicey, i noticed cinnamon and other baking spices, kind of like pumpkin pie without the pumpkin. Its mouthfeel was surprisingly thin , but not badoverall a real nice beer, good flavor. got tastier as it warmed up."
"It is a classic, but it is a classic that must be cared for properly, just like a lot of other good beers. When fresh Anchor Steam has an agressive bitterness that is tempered with a healthy dose of caramel malts. These malts add some sweetness and body and a little bit of a rustic character. If this beer isn't consumed when fresh it tends to be more balanced, and well, kind of boring. It's the fresh hop bitterness that can really grab the attention of your tastebuds. The unique esters obtained from the unique fermentation process are subtle and could be interpreted as faults. I do believe these mineral-like qualities created by the yeast are under-appreciated."
"Light iced tea color with no head at all. Faint aroma of hop and florals. Mouthfeel is a bit bubbly and tingly, with carbonation being on the high side. The flavor in general is weak. It consists of mild malt, but there is a distinct metallic undertone to it. A light hop bitterness lingers. I just don't see the attraction to this one."
"A bright, beautiful hybrid beer that goes down smooth and easily, always accompanied by flavor. A great American brewing accomplishment, I always say! I'm forever glad there's always Anchor Steam around!"
"I am partial to this beer. It has always been a favorite and one of the first ""better"" beers that I started drinking. The beer poured a bright amber/copper color and had a huge white and creamy head that clung nicely to the glass. Nice citrusy hop and bitter grainy aroma. Some floral and fresh grass there too. A light to medium bodied beer with a very clean and dry taste. Matched perfect with my Hamburger (well, just about any beer probably would). Finishes crisp and pleasantly bitter. A classic and a good one to revisit from time to time."
"On tap at Burgh's in Bridgeville. The color was a dark amber. The smell was that of maltiness. The taste is fairly unique. It's much heavier than a lager, but not quite an ale.........quite a bit of malt in it. Mouthfeel was fairly smooth. As for drinkability, I think I could have a few of these. A unique taste, and as the last surviving example of an otherwise extinct style, and a good solid American beer!"
"It is very difficult to describe the taste of Anchor Steam! It is a kind of dull spice -- it's a pale ale with an aftertaste that is dry and musky. But, it's a pleasant ale to drink, and it's easy to drink many more than one."
"A very nicely hopped brew with good balance. The flavor is all there. The body is medium and it is very smooth. A great drinker. I could session with this one anytime. I'll have to grab a few bottles and see if it is the same."
"Can honestly say that I have never been too fond of this beer in the bottle, maybe it's the trip across country it has to make to get here but there is always a funky grassy taste going on that does nothing for me. However on draught this beer pours a nice amber with a creamy off white head. Leaving a decent lace around the rim of my mug. The aroma is a sweet caramelly malty aroma with a nice solid back bone of hop aroma. The taste of this beer is unique due to the fact that when they orginally brewed this beer they had lager yeast, but no refrigeration to ferment it as a true lager. So, they fermented this beer at ale temperature using the lager yeast creating the California common or ""steam"" beer style. This beer has a wonderful hop bitterness with sweet apple tones and a nice full malt profile wonderful beer. The mouthfeel is mildly carbonated with a great smooth finish from this medium to light bodied beer. Incredilbly drinkable if obtained freshly."
"I had to force the issue of an unfrosted pint glass for this bottled version in a beer bar that does a great job with its draft versions. Having noted that, it was a surprise to me that I could barely raise a single finger of ivory head over the clear amber body on this beer. Perhaps it was just too cold overall. In any case, it did not keep even the minimal head nor did it do any lacing to speak of. It did, however, have a delightfully robust nose that spoke volumes of malt and hints of hops. The taste started full of the malt and sweetness, but finished surprisingly bitter. The aftertaste seemed to moderate the bitterness with a final dry sense. An enjoyable beer that I could enjoy more than one to a sitting. The final strong nose is caramel malt as the brew warmed."
"This is probably one of my favorite american lagers along with Sam Adams. Nice color with slight cloudiness. Aroma is malty and a little hop fragrance. Very smooth on the palate unlike other lagers which have a little more effervescence to them. This was about the only beer on the menu tonight worth having. It's a shame restaurants don't give their beer selection half the attention their wine menus get."
"Pours a nice amber in color with a lot of head that fades to a slight covering at the end. Incredibly easy drinking and in that respect quite dangerous :) Well balanced and complex to the point taht the hops and malt take turns coming through. A wonderful standby beer."
"It's hard to review a beer that was the first of it's style. It doesn't really matter if this is an ale or a lager because it's a flat out great beer. It's highly carbonated with a dark ruby color and a well retained head. The hops are noticable but don't take away from the sweetness of the malt. This beer certaintly deserves it's reputation."
"Notes: This is a delicious brew that I could drink all night long. While not overly robust, it is tremendously enjoyable. A wonderful stepping stone beer. One that could be used to convert the un-beer-ducated over to the good side. Now that this is available in Canada, it could go a long way to change perceptions of what mainstream American beer is. Plus, the pseudo-stubby bottle should prove to be a hit with Canadian drinkers that are feeling a little nostalgic."
"Solid, interesting and quaffable. Worthy of its reputation."
"It pours out with a nice pillowey head, and bubbles all over in the beer. A darker orange color. Some lacing on the sides of the glass. Tastes pretty good, i cant think of anything ive had that has tasted like this. Its interesting and tastes good, id say give it a try"
"Served a copper amber with a small head. A nice brew for sure. Hop bitter is there. Fruity is there with her friend toasty. This beer tastes like liquid pretzels. It took me a while to figure out what that taste was. This beer tastes like pretzels! Actually quite a complex brew and quite tasty. I could drink this all night."
"I haven't had this in quite some time, and hadn't been overly impressed when I did. Upon further review, however, I find this to be quite a nice beer. This would be a good beer to use to try and win over a macro drinker, as it is not too bitter or strong, but miles above the ""big three"". Nice, malty flavor, smooth and a little creamy. Some hop bitterness, but not much (compared to a lot of micros). Pours a nice, amber color, some carbonation, but not too much. Slightly sweet, and I wouldn't drink too many because of that. Overall, a very well balanced and enjoyable beer, from a company that makes consistently terrific product."
"This is another great beer from Anchor. Pours a nice amber/orange color with an average-sized white bubbly foam. Head fades down, leaving a thin lace on the glass. Scents of citrus fruit seem to blend very well with the hops and malt. The taste is equally as balanced as the aroma. Initial taste was of sweet malt, followed by a zing of citrus, finished off by a nice bitterness of hops. This is an exceptionally balanced and bold beer."
"Prost!"
"First time I've had this, not quite sure what I think of it yet. It's good but maybe not my cuppa. I'll wait & give it another try soon."
"Poured into a light amber/orange color. Had a thick head that quickly disappeared but left a lace on the glass all the time. Smell of malts & hops noticeable. Good carbonation and you could feel it when drinking. Mouthfeel was thin and crisp. Smoked, hops was part of the taste malts were strong also. All in all a good beer glad, I bought a sixer of this."
"A very soft and smooth nosed beer considering how lemon, smoky, and uniquely bitter this strange brew is. Truly unique as everyone has said. Definitely picking sixers of this to keep around the fridge. Fabulous."
"Pours a deep amber color with a thick and creamy white head that coats the sides of the glass with sheets of lace as it recedes. Nose is sweet malts and caramel with a touch of floral hops. Medium in body with a good amount of carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel. Taste is raw grains and bitter hop resins up front with a bit of lemon rind followed by notes of sweet toasted malts and caramelized sugar. A bit of lemony citrus is present in the aftertaste. Simply a classic brew that is a must try for anyone."
"Crystal clear, light caramel-amber in color with a decent beige head and excellent retention atop medium bubbles and moderately-strong carbonation. Lacing is adequate. Aroma is grainy, husky, lightly caramel, yeasty with some ""primary dredge"" characteristics. Hops are not very abundant in aroma. Mouthfeel is initially fizzy with a medium body. Taste starts with a fizzy, clean amber malt profile, some mild, gritty, earthy flavor hops, penetrated by some mild yeasty fusels and sulfur midway through, then ending in a pleasant, lingering grainy sweetness balanced by smooth, earthy hops. Everything simmers and becomes more round after warming. An American classic in it's own right...a good alternative to ESB's, but it just doesn't do much for me."
"Not bad. This is the first lager I've had in quite a long time. Poured a hazy copper with a sizable and stickey head. Malt and semi-sweet aroma. Fairly malty taste with some hop-bitterness. Has a prickly, medium-bodied mouthfeel. This is a pretty good lager - one of the better ones I've had (and they haven't been too many - I'm more of an ale man). Definitely a session beer. I'd make this my regular lager, but it's a little on the expensive side here in the Boston area."
"If you're ever planning on coming to San Francisco, make sure you make your reservations for the brewery tour ASAP. They only do them once a day -- for 12 or so people. You won't be disappointed!"
"I am excited to finally review this classic! Anchor poured very smoothly, revealing a light copper/red color with a 1/2 a finger thick off-white head that remained the entire way down the glass. The only complaint was the smell. There wasn't any. It just smelled like ""beer"". The taste on the other hand was great. There was a nice hop bitterness that attcked the front of my tongue while a more mellow malted flavor pleased the back. The aftertaste was tart with some notes of apple. This had a unique lager style taste that I do not think I have ever tasted before. The mouthfeel was well carbonated and creamy. One of the more distinct american beers around. try it if you can."
"A very drinkable session beer. It's clear amber with a small off-white head. I sense just a bit of floral hops in the aroma, nothing pungent. A zesty carbonation treats the tongue, as well as a perfectly balanced hop and malt combo, more hops at first. The finish is dry, crisp, and refreshing. I'm pleased that I finally tried this classic....highly recommended."
"This is a very drinkable beer that I had been looking forward to trying, and it did not let me down. Obviously against a macro there is no choice, but still this is a beer that I will buy again and offer to friends."
"anchor steam pours out a hazy amber color. there was the slightest bit of sediment on the bottom of the bottle that i made sure i swirled in. a foamy head dies to a fine lace. not much in the nose except some slight fruity maltiness and a bit of floral hops. tastes very fruity...maltiness evident and a slight stinging hop bite. a lot going on here. the creamy mouthfeel isn't really smooth, so to speak...adding to the unique and rough profile. alchohol is noticeable, and so is a slight sulphur note on the palate. seemingly full bodied; an enigmatic beer to say the least. finishes with a hop attitude which i found stimulating and pleasing to my taste buds. i can see why this is an all time classic. another brew i could easily drink many of!"
"This brew poured a clear amber orange color with a small off-white head the did last. The aroma was hoppy with a flowery-citrus background. The taste was also citrus with sort of a lemony zest with a finish that had a fairly bitter hoppy finish. There was a good amount of carbonation and the beer went down easily. This would be a good summertime beer as it is crisp and refreshing."
"Pours a clear amber color, has an average sized foamy white head that last. Has a grainy, bready flowery aroma. Light and balanced hop and malt flavors, medium body with a dry crisp finish, this may be on of the easiest drinking beers I have ever had."
"Hoppy nose and taste. It has a decent golden amber color. and a moderate head that is short lived. Kind of has a stick to the roof of your mouth yet smooth texture in regards to mouthfeel. It has a very bitter finish that is a bit off and lacking balance. Overall a somewhat drinkable beer but not a great beer."
"Deep, opaque copper/red color. Decent head, with the tiniest micro-bubbles, which turn into elegant lace. I like this beer because it has character, but is unobtrusive. It is yummy and interesting, yet it does not get in the way of dinner. It has a malty flavor on a medium body, with light hop bitterness. The high carbonation further enhances this beers with food profile for me."
"A bit over-carbonated, but that's the fault of the bar, not Anchor, I hope. The over-carb decreases my drinkability - this is dehydration city waiting to happen."
"While it may not be on anybody's 'Best of' list, it's a rock-solid and dependable brew that never fails to please. The granddaddy and precursor of all American micros."
"F"
"Pours a pale copper color with very little head, that leaves a sexy lace behind. Earthy notes in the smell of the malt is very nice. The hops flavor is strong yet nice with that musty note. This is a great steam beer."
"Overall, it pretty much met my expectation of a beer style that originated as a crudely made beer, made under hot and trying conditions. Not for me, but a unique beer and probably enjoyed by many."
"This is a real winner if you like amber beers. Has a nice wheaty taste, with some faint fruit flavors. Not much of a head to it, but that is to be expected. Also, there was a tinge of hops, but it was balanced well enough for me. ""Goes down smooth and never lets you down"". Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed."
"It pours a light amber in the glass with an off-white head that shrinks to a cap. The smell is of bready malt, some grain, light caramel tones and herbal hops. Carbonation is crisp and tightly knit. Tea-like hops dominate, providing a signature bitter bite, with grain and some caramel malt coming up for support. A light-medium bodied brew."
"Darker than anticipated and cloudy. Minimum head and certainly full bodied but somewhat bitter with an after taste that will not leave you alone..in a very positive way...Not a good brew for dinning as to its weight...but certainly a session beer..."
"It pours into the glass a clear dark gold/copper caramel color. The head is not too thick but large. The lace on the sides is quiet evident to the end of the glass. The aroma is of malt, caramel, hops, floral and some spices. The taste in the beginning has hints of caramel (slightly sweet) then hoppy. Followed by some citrus and a little bitter. It then goes slightly sweet again before it finishes somewhat dry. The flavor stays with you a little while after. Not what it used to be, but it is still a good starter beer."
"Here's a hopped-up lager typical of a west coast brewery. You certainly won't hear me complaining. Pours a pristine copper color with a thick, foamy head. Looks pretty good at first, and the smell is inviting, too. Notes of sweet malt and maybe a bit of spicy hops are evident. Taste is diverse with notes of the sweet malts at first, countered by the spicy hops toward mid-glass. Mouthfeel is rather grainy, which may take away from the drinkability a bit. Overall, though, this is a classic brew and one I've been fond of for quite some time."
"Inviting copper color with a thin white lace on top. Some malt and a bit of spice show up in the aroma. Mouthfeel has some stronger carbonation than I expected, but the taste is rather crisp and pleasantly bitter. This is a good lager with some surprising hop flavor. I enjoyed it!"
"A truly good beer!  Pours a very clear light caramel color with a medium off-white head that leaves a lace down the glass.  The smell is that of a non-complex, yet inviting caramel and malt.  This is one ""hopped-up"" lager with tastes of a repeat of the aromas along with a crisp hop bite.  It is light bodied and very well balanced.  Maybe not totally true to the style in the hops category, who cares...this one is very good and has character to be remembered!  Cheers!"
"A very unique beer... copper / amber with a thin white head... leaves a good lace on the glass.  Malta aroma, some caramel and spice.  Upfront, the flavor has a grainy charateristic, then bitter hops, followed by a slight sweetness.  Has a rough mouthfeel, and a meduim body.  It's been years since I tried this one... and this was probably one of the first micros I can remember truely enjoing.  A classic."
"Although it pours a nice clear yellow, I think don't think that it's an exceptional beer to be rated above average. It is better than your big brewery beers, but an average beer! Tried it about two years ago and thought it tasted better. Will try again later!"
"Tastes like no other amber I have ever had before.  Floral taste with a crisp hoppy-bitter aftertaste.  After a few sips it became one of my favorite beers.  Has an awesome color too it, good all the way around...not very scented though but that to me is by far the least important qualty of a beer."
"Pours a amber-copper color nice, thick and chunky head (that dissipates quick) that leaves nice lace. Great apperance, makes your mouth water just looking at it. Not much to the smell, some malt and floral hop aroma, but what it lacks in smell it makes up for in taste. Medium bodied with a nice mouthfeel, especially for a lager. Starts with light caramel malt taste which then leads the way  toward the hops. Some citrus flavor and a crisp bitterness lead to a dry finish and a lasting aftertaste. Very good."
"My first taste of a microbrew was this beer. My friend used to steal it from his fathers package store. A clean taste, slightly sweet with a good balance of hops, it seemed exotic at the time, but now just tastes great. I definitely recommend this all."
"A fine beer.  On-tap this tastes crisper than out of the bottle.  A fine bronze color in the glass with enough malt to let you know its there.  The hops hit the palate which grabs you due to the fact its a lager and you may not be ready for a hops from a lager.  Very drinkable."
"It's nice whenever you come across a beer that is not afraid to show some bitter hop character and not only hop aromas."
"The first ever US Beer that I tried when I lived in England, I immediately fell in love with it then, and I still love it today - many, many years later. Lovely deep amber / light copper colored beer that pours with a good head that soon dissipates (as with all bottled Anchor Beers I find). Not much nose, but what it lacks in smell, it makes up for in taste. Lovely mild bitterness with a dryish finish that begs the next mouthfull. Just right for the times when you fancy ""a few"" beers. Lovely supremely balanced Session Beer that I personally find very Quaffable. First time I found it in England, it was described as Americas only indeginous beer style. Hard to believe this Brewery nearly bit the dust. I raise a Steam-er to Fritz Maytag, I think we all owe him a few beers !!!."
"650mL bottle.   has a nice amber/copper colour, with a decent head that fades to a thin lace.  I liked this beer, it had a pleasantly bitter taste, along with a dryish finish.  It's definitely something that can be considered a session beer, which is something I've been trying to find lately."
"I was not impressed by this beer.  It exhibited nice grassy aromas and had a more robust color than I was expecting, but the flavors were disappointing.  The beer was very light tasting with little malt sweetness or bitterness.  I guess you could call it a well balanced flavor, but it seemed rather un-inspiring."
"I had this beer for the first time about two months ago.  I found that after couple of weeks of having this beer (I had had just one) I was seriously craving it.  It has a great deep amber color to it with a foamy head.  It's taste is a great balance of malty richness followed by just the right amount of hop finish.  This has quickly become one of my favorites.  And I love the unique bottle shape as well."
"I think this would be a great beer to widen the horizons of macro-drinkers. Try one."
"I remember the last time in Sanfran, passing time in a bar, I ordered one of these on tap. My expectations were low, based probably on less-than-fresh bottles consumed in MI. But they didn't have any other good choices so... It was absolutely beautiful. Perfect, fresh and living. I recall it was lighter in color than what is in front of me now. Is this bottle contract-brewed somewhere other than in SF? There is no definitive statement of origin on the label. (brewed ""by"" AS, SanFran; rather than brewed ""in"" SanFran) I wonder..."
"293"
"Notes: You don't find other beers like this, not even close in their mimics. This is truly a unique brew, and a classic; a legend in the hand-crafted/micro industry."
"Bright copper in color with a foamy off-white head and obvious, brisk but fine carbonation. The aroma is of a clean, rich malt and light fruitiness with some hops. A full body combined with the zesty carbonation gives a distinct mouthfeel. The flavor starts with creamy, lightly caramel malt and leads into a vast hop character of flavor and crisp bitterness as it crosses the palate. The finish is dry and lasting. The classic of the style."
"Awesome. Drink, Drink.  Cheers!"
"The beer poured amber with a thick creamy head and a slightly malty aroma.  The first drink left nice lacing, but not a great flavor, in my opinion.  I thought it tasted too bitter, which lasted for a while on the tongue.  Not one I would seek out, but I would not turn it down either."
"Just had this with a nice roast beef hoagie at a favorite deli/beer store. An all around good beer - the taste and mouthfeel were pleasant, and the finish was very enjoyable. I am not sure i would spend a night drinking it, but would definitely not shun it if it were offered."
"Short-lived head and average color. Crisp and not overly bitter, but not much to the finish. Slightly better-than-ordinary overall. It is really a good beer to break out of the macro mold with, as it it not too hard to find."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Pours clear amber with compact, fleeting head.  Aroma is noticeable but hard for me to pin down.  The taste is not hard to pin down--bitter but in a unique sort of way.  Bitterness lingers, but it's a trademark for Anchor Steam."
"This beer poured a nice copper/amber color and formed a nice off-white head, that left some nice lace.   The aroma was of malt and some hops.  The flavor was of malt and hops with a slight citrus aspect.  The finish was a touch astrigent, giving it a slight bitter aftertaste.  A good beer"
"Beautiful copper body. Rocky, fluffy just slightly off-white head. Excellent lacing. Wonderful mix of floral and citrus hops in aroma. Superb hop and malt balance. This beer could be drank all night. Paired with any food. Clean. Truly does exhibit ale and lager characteristics. Too often overlooked, an America Classic."
"What a unique brew. A kind copper color in appearance with a nice head to top it off. A simple sip and the hops explode with a sharp bitteness. An absolute full flavored beer and definitely a keeper."
"Excellent on tap as well."
"Orange - amber in hue w/ a very slight haze.  The thin, but tight head leaves a respectable lace.  Light caramel malt notes and toasted malt comprise the malt aroma, while an assertive woody Northern Brewer hop nose follows.  Lightly bodied, and highly carbonated, but the ample residual dextrins make for a smooth, crisp, and pleasant mouthfeel.  The woody, slightly earthy hop flavor is expected from the hop variety used.  Hop bitterness overpowers malt sweetness, yet isn't overbearing.  The finish is clean with just a hint of esters. Anchor Steam is an excellent session brew for hopheads."
"Anchor Steam was probably the first micro I had that sent me onto this path...So yesterday I picked one up at the Greenbush Beverage Center for old times sake. It wasn't quite as good as I remembered - still hoppy, nice color and lace. Went down well with the burgers & steak at a cookout though and that's  what counts."
"I prefer ales to lagers, but as lagers go, this was extremely drinkable.  Great amber color, nice head and lace, good mouthfeel (for a beer of this type).  Balanced with a hoppy finish.  It had me looking in the 22 oz. bottle for more."
"Deep amber color with a small, short-lived head.  Elusive, slightly-spicy aroma.  Nice balance.  Enjoyable beer, but not outstanding and less interesting than I used to believe."
"When in rome, do as the romans. I had this on vacation with my girlfriend in San Francisco. After having the Liberty Ale, I expected more flavor, but remember it for what it was. Nice copper color, big head, that settled nicely. Nice taste, just want you want in a lager. Malty, thick, rich and inviting. Hops and bitterness lingers. A little thin, but very good going down. I was glad I finally tried it, and in it's hometown too. I rate it right up there with a Boston Lager, and better than a Yuengling. Not a bad choice at all."
"Lingers on the tongue with somewhat of a citrus residue. Bitter/sour. In-between. Not bad though."
"Anchor Steam:  Copper, clear beer, with a pale white head.  Very nice malty/grain aroma, very nice beer, however, it’s a little hard to place.  Starts bitter, ends with faint malt sweetness.  I do not know if this will make sense, but most beers end on a downbeat, this one ends on an up beat.  Very nice, very drinkable."
"Anchor Steam has a deep amber color with a generous head. Malt overtones, faintly fruity, and fresh with a crisp, refreshing hop dryness to finish. Quite rounded, full of character."
"Pours a nice bright sopper with a decent off white head.  Smell is of nice caramel malt and some light floral hops.  Taste starts off with some sweet caramel malt that is soon followed up by a decent hop flavor that balances the brew out nicely.  Nice smooth mouthfeel and fairly drinkable.  I generally prefer my brews to be a bit bigger than this, however, for the style this is a pretty nice offering."
"Appearance is deep clear amber. Almost copper. Beautiful pillowy white head. I don't get a lot on the nose. Maybe some slight malt. Taste is nice. A nice bready yeast flavor is present. There's also a very slight fruitiness that accents nicely. Like apples and pears. Very clean taste. Easy drinking. Solid brew here."
"A very solid beer, when I can find it which isnt all the time.  A sure thing and a great beer, another beer that helped change my thinking about how a beer should taste."
"I'm not a big lager fan, but after reading about how this beer was made to gain some ale qualities, I was impressed enough to give it a try. Much more complexity than a typical lager. Less hop character than I would have expected from a west coast brewery but some nice maltiness."
"This is another always-reliable beer from a west coast brewery.  It's an all-night beer with good aroma and flavor."
"Such a great beer, tastes a bit like fresh greens in a backyard garden, especially if you drink it at the brewery.  Sometimes it's not good, sometimes it's the best thing on earth, it just depends on your mood.  A historic beer."
"I'd like to say I like this beer more than I do because of its unique status as a hybrid. I do enjoy it on tap when I'm in the San Fran area.  Maybe its too balanced in its presentation with hop and malt so equal that I can't form a strong opinion.  Its also a little thin in mouthfeel and finish to me.  Big fan of Anchor's Porter, though."
"Good session beer, light in flavour, aswell as having a good hop profile, and well rounded flavour, very nice."
"Served from a bottle.  Very big head, foamy noisey and lasted a long time.  Clear with a copper colored amber.  Surprisingly light nose, that was dominated by malt.  Smooth malt character to the taste with sharp bitterness surrounding it.  Finishes long and dry.  Nice and full mouthfeel adds to the enjoyment.  Feels like your really drinking something with some body, especially since it's not a stout or porter.  This would be an easy beer in which to enjoy several."
"Simply an all around good beer, with decent balance and incredible character. Used to treat myself to this beer when I was cutting my teeth into the better beer world ages ago. Everyone should at least try this beer once."
"On tap, this beer has been fairly consistent, and one of my favorite summertime brews. The crispness of this beer makes it a easy drinking one. The bottled is very good, but as others have stated, can be quite inconsistent, with a metallic, stale,  almost oxygenated taste to it..."
"First had Anchor Steam at this hippie shrine kinda joint called Vesuvio in San Fran about ten years ago. I was thrilled at the time. Still pretty good stuff."
"A classic beer.  Such a distinctive taste; never gets old"
"While the color and smell say drink this one, I find that each bottle has a nasty metallic aftertaste to it.  In addition, the beer seems watery in comparison to other ales, though firmer than all pilsners and most lagers.  Some people swear by this beer, I just swear at it.  Much better than Bud or Coors though."
"This is a terrific beer, while agree that this is one of the best around it pales to a Liberty Ale.  But I degress, take your Bud swilling friends and have them try an Anchor Steam - the shock will do them good."
"Very ale-like in character, with distinct malt.  This brewery knows how to turn out quality products."
