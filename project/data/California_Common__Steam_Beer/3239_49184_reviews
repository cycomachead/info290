"This beer is a decent malt-forward lager, malt and grain flavors predominant. Nothing exceptional, but another easy drinking thirst quencher."
"Beer is medium in body, creamy and has a nice finish on it, mildly bitter not grainy at all. A fine steam beer / lager. The munich malt comes through nicely and the finish is good. I'd have it again probably."

"Overall: I had this a while back, but definitely enjoyed it. I think I have to try this again to get a more accurate idea."

"Overall a very tasty and easy to drink beer. I recommend this one very highly."
"O: Not a bad beer, could have had a smoother aftertaste and more fruit notes."
"Visions of blazing six-guns taking down rows of empty bottles. Perfect clarity off of the copper-colored brew, and the decent- sized head leaves some patchy lacing. Clean malt nose of caramel and a hint of bread. Very, very smooth with a moderate- sized body. The palate is clean throughout, with a dry-ish malt character aside from a quick splash of caramel. Modest hop- ping goes right to balancing and retains a subtle herbal flavor. Hints of fruit and nutty, bready malt in the dry finish. A very tasty straight-up lager here--nothing fancy, just really good drinking."
"An ok beer, but not one I would pursue again."
"D - This is a pretty good beer. It holds up well with other steam beers."
"D- Even though this beer has a dark body the taste and aroma are very light and thin. Not that much depth and the sulfury flavor covers most of the flavors as the beer warms."
"D: I would definitely get this beer again. Probably will not buy this beer again in a little while but I would definitely get it again."
"The taste is that of molasses and malt with just a wee bit of hop bittering. I can't say that I notice any hop aroma or flavor. I would definately drink another (and do indeed have one more bottle in the fridge) if offered, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"Bronze hue with a light haze. Lean foam collar leaves spotty lace. Weak woody hop nose combined with hints of medium lovibond caramel. Trace toasted malt hints. Middling aromawise. Incipient in flavor is dilute toffeeish sweetness, which leads into a combination of bitter black tea like and soapy hop flavors. Beefs up slightly mid palate, with doughy malt providing relief. Oddly becomes more watery as it warms. Lightly bodied and carbonated. Could use a touch more spritz and dextrin in mouthfeel. Finishes with a fading surge of biscuit malt and table salt. An odd, yet bland melange of flavors. Skippable, this one is."
"Clear copper color with no head and carbonation is void. The aroma is a bit toasty with some caramel malts. Hop aroma is nill. The flavor is of caramel malt, and a bit toasty. Again, not a bit of hop flavoring or bitterness. Light in body, and easy drinking... the best quality about this one. My suggestion is pass on this one."
"This beer has all the maltiness required, but somehow left the hops behind. It was all aroma and not much else."
"Pours a strange, slightly opaque copper-amber hue with minimal head. Nice deep aroma of sweet malt, with a hint of dark cherries, toffee, and oak. Thin, slightly flat mouthfeel. Moderately unpleasant palate belies the nice aroma. Slightly bitter taste, but not really from the hops. Malty notes, followed by a deep warming sensation in the throat. Not one I'd recommend."
