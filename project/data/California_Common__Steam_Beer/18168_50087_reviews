"Strong woodsy notes. Scratchy pine, toasted and grainy malt. Orange hue. Fresh,  minty aroma. Coarse feel, light-med body . Fresh squeezed citrus, orange/grapefruit."

"05/29/13 On tap at Rattle N Hum, NYC. Lovely creamy head & mouth feel. At the low end of the IPA IBU scale this really hit the spot. The bitter has no bite. Simple dry aftertaste. At 5.7 ABV this could be the start of a long relationship, but availability appears to be a bit hit & miss, so if you find it, give it a try."

"O: I found this beer to be a good representation of the style and had a nice balance between the malts and hops."

"A good stab at the California Common style. Could have a bit more bright flavors."

"Had this on tap at Birdsall House in Peekskill. It is my first Steam Beer so maybe this is how the style is supposed to taste. This beer was completely unbalanced with a weak malt presence and an over the top yet extremely bitter hop profile. If you like to drink a glass of bitter hops, then this beer is for you. I proceeded to drink a few west coast IPA's after this one that completely blew me away."

"o - Overall a pretty good beer, though no where near their other hoppy offerings. Some nice floral and citrus in the nose, though the taste has less. Easy to drink, a nice light beer, but would highly recommend their other IPA's if you're looking for something hoppy."
""
""
"However, the unfiltered lager aspect with this along with the tons of citrus hops really makes this hoppy lager a drinkable and really enjoyable beer."

"O: Surprised that this is a California Common/Steam Beer as it could easily be mistaken for an APA or an IPA. There is a pleasant amount of hoppiness that makes this one quite enjoyable and it is very easy to drink."

"Mouthfeel is great- light to medium body with moderate carbonation. This one is definitely a keeper and an excellent example of the style."

"Overall a tasty well balanced ale. Very sessionable."
"I generally do not gush about pale ales. I tend to like good ones as much as the next guy, but this one was particularly good and I had a few of them in a session. The aroma is floral hoppy, with a very nice finish of Mt. Hood hops which lend an astringent, earthy hop character to the mix. I also blended the hop common with another peekskill pale; ""wake up call"" on a 3/4 to 1/4 basis (favoring the Hop Common) ....excellent as a blend as well."

"O: love the style and i find this one to be a nice representation of the style but would have liked to see some more head retention, taste was overall very pleasant"
"Overall, this is a significant improvement from the old hop common. Very easy to drink, pairs great with wings."

"Overall: I could have had more than one of these, especially in warm weather."
"Nose just like the taste. Great balance juicy hops in the middle very piney and grassy. Cereal malts a bit sweet on the finish with moderate carbonation leaving a great mouthfeel. Silky smooth."
"A burnt orange color topped with a dense head of foam, Hop Common is definitely sessionable and pairs very well with the food on the menu at the brewpub. The first sip tasted woody and left lacing on my pint glass. Nicely carbonated and somewhat dry, this well balanced beer has a creamy mouthfeel and a hoppy finish. Regularly on tap and well executed, it's worth a try either on its own or along with some of Peekskill's other brews."
"Yes siree, I could do with a sixer or two of this one. Great to see something different from a brew-pub. I believe Peekskill Brewery is relatively new, but they've got some tastee brews over there. This may be my favorite yet."
"A great drinking local brew. The beer was a looker. Nice dark copper color with solid lacing. It was a mix between an American IPA and a Cali Common. Good taste and decent mouthfeel. A solid mix between Anchor Steam and a traditional IPA. The pubs best offering."
"Hop Common from the Peekskill brewery and that of Defiant Brewing in Pearl River NY are one of the same as the brewmaster at Defiant produces some of the brews served at Peekskill Brewing. This is a wonderful brew; grapefruit and sticky hops dominate the palate and nose in what is simply an EZ drinking and immensely enjoyable hop laden brew. Fantastic acid balance giving this concoction extreme drinkability. Served in a ""proper"" pint on scene you will simply love it!"
"On tap at the Brewery in Peekskill, pours clear lighter copper amber, supporting a middle of the road off white head, and then showing better then average lace. Just a hint of hops in the nose. Balanced brew, toffee malts a hint of tropical fruit and grainy hops. Nothing special, but a decent offering for a tiny brwery that is hosting a boatload of guest taps and still searching/finding its way with its own brews."
