"This is quite a good lager; very flavorful, solid, and fitting for everyday consumption."

"Pours golden straw in color with a thick 2 finger just off white head. Got your bread malts in the aroma, along with some corn and a every so slight citrus note. The taste is exactly what you would get with any solid lager. It is a little creamier up front and also a little bitter on the back end. I really have no complaints with this one. I got it on the cheap too, which is always a plus. It's just a solid easy drinking beer."
"This is a good lager. It's not flashy, but it's enjoyable and does what it's supposed to do. Well done."

"O: Not bad. It's nice to have a steam beer (whoops, I mean California common) not from Anchor. I'd never turn down a free can of this."
