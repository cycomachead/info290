"If you like Anchor, try this. It's probably not a fair comparison, but I'd actually like to try them dude by side to see how wrong I am."

"I poured one and a half cans into a half liter stein,a deep bronze with a quick to fade white head.Aromas are light with some caramel and dough mainly,some light soapiness is there as well.That soap-like note is bigger on the palate along with some caramel and mild toast,some light earthiness as well in the finish.The soapiness kind of takes over the beer at first wich is a turn off,after awhile it gets better but still a little annoying."
