"Nope. West=western=Cal-if-forn-i-a. As in Steam. Only, I couldn't tell, because this had an awfully muted hop profile for a steam beer. It's got the pretty, hazy, fizzy copper color of Anchor steam, and the aroma is nice, crisp, very pale malt. Tastes like the pale malt mixed with some light german(?) hops and finishes with bready, wonderfully done yeast. Nice and well balanced, but I wouldn't have guessed it for a steam."
"On tap at Tomlinson Tap Room, this is a lager per the brewer's website, but it really does have some amazing pale ale attributes (meant for, I believe). Poured a very nice copper color with excellent head and some nice lacing. Very clean and crisp malty scent with a huge hit of citrusy hops. Nice crisp and refreshing malty flavor with a huge citrus hop hit at the end, which gives it just a bit of roughness. Overall quite good! A nice blend of lager and pale ale attributes."
"The flavor takes hold of the tastebuds and gives them a good thrashing with raw, leafy hop cones and a peppery carbonation level. The German lager yeast is apparent, adding a hint of sulfur-y goodness, but this beer tastes much more ale-like than I had expected. The alcohol nips at the back of the palate with a hint of fruity sweetness. Mouthfeel is bold, yet restrained, with a medium consistency and uppity carbonation. Juicy and crisp on the finish with a lingering kick of hop oils. All in all, a delightfully fresh, hoppy IPA. Kudos to Sun King and thanks again to brundo4 for a killer trade!"
