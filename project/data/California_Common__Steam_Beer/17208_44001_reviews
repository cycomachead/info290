"Final Grade: 4.00, an A-. This is the second Icelandic beer I've had - both from this brewery - and I've been quite impressed with each of them. I've been meaning to try a steam beer for a while now, and although Skjalfti doesn't exactly have the brand recognition of Anchor Steam, I still think this made an excellent introduction to the style. It's a little pricy to be a realistic session option in these parts, but easily worth a try, and I will probably pick it up again some time."
"Generally, I’m not that big of a fan of brews where the hop bitterness outweighs the hop flavour (but that’s a personal preference and I’ll have to dial it in with a few more steam beers to see what’s good for the style) Anyway, I found that the style was really well balanced and delicious. A good one!"
"O-a decent beer in this style, reasonable session beer"
"Clear copper body and a pile of off-white head. Decent retention and patch lace. Bready and floral aromas predominate, with lesser notes of citrus and sulfur. Toasted malt and tangerine hop flavour, with balancing bitterness in the finish. Not big and bold by any means, just a good balanced profile. Light-bodied but not thin, low carbonation, smooth. Nice session lager."

"O: Decent IPA, it was good to try, but I found it way to one dimensional."

""
"O - Given the style, the flavour profile was quite loaded. Worth a try, but nothing mind blowing."

"Pretty decent stuff."

"O: Nothing crazy about this beer. I could easily turn this into a session beer but might get a little bored after awhile."
"Overall- This is a very interesting beer, right away this kind of reminded me of a doppelbock from the smells and even initially on the tastes as well. I did really enjoy this one although I kind of had low expectations, which I am quickly finding out that these Scandinavian offerings are a little more above average than I initially thought. Great balance although there is not a whole lot going on in this beer, but I do like the ice sweet caramel bread malts mixed with the mild hop presence and an even more mild citrusy fruit presence in there as well. All in all I wish I would have picked up a few more of this one because I actually liked it!"
"D: This is actually the first steam beer I've had, so I've little to compare it to. That said, it's a refreshing and pleasant middle-ground between ale and lager well worth trying."
"D: Pretty easy to drink and refreshing brew, but I wouldn't likely seek this one out again."
"O - refreshing lager picked up from the LCBO - somehow tastes very similar to Grand River Curmudgeon IPA - I will definitely pick this up again - easy to drink and sessionable - my go to iceland beer!"
"The flavour is lightly roasty with medium malt sweetness and a refreshing bitter finish. Flavourful and drinkable lager not unlike Anchor Steam."
"o-I would buy this again in a heart beat. Really interesting find for the LCBO."
"Pours a golden orange, with a creamy offwhite head. Good retention and some lace. Nose has some distinct grassiness, fairly leafy. Taste has more of the grassiness in it, bitterness is evident but not overpowering. Again, leafy with some pine notes as well. Moderate malt base, some breadiness but subdued. A bit of butter. Finish lingers a bit, but overall a decent beer."
"Pours a nice copper/amber colour, decent white head, light traces of lacing on the glass. Smell is not overly aromatic but nice smooth malt, light citrus, mildly hoppy. Taste is crisp, a nice hop presence is there, nice malt, a really flavorful lager. Good creamy mouthfeel, quite refreshing very smooth, perfect carbonation. Really solid beer, nice flavourful lager, I could drink this all day."
"A top notch bottled wheat. Sharp citrus with a nice head on the pour. Clean finish. The light amber colour was surprising. I thought it a most delicious pint and would partake of it's wheatie-citrus-ness again. And again. And again. And again. But probably not again after that."
"A basic and mostly unmemorable beer, though it's well-made enough and pretty drinkable. I'd probably drink this sometimes as a sessionable beer if I lived in Iceland to try keeping things local. Here in Canada, there are too many other good beers similar to this one."
"Hoppy aroma and well balanced taste, with a nicely bitter finish. A very nice surprise!"
"Pleasant and unique (to me at least) offering that I'll have to try again."
"D: The drinkability is very good. I could see enjoying this a lot in the summer."
"A nice offering and my first experience with the steam beer style outside of Anchor. I am looking forward to the smoked stout from the brewery later this year."
"Drink - A pretty decent brew that is definitely worth a try if you happen to see it on the shelves. Sure hit the spot while watching nfl football today."
"Another well crafted beer from these guys."
"Really I am very happy to have enjoyed this beer, and am happy that the Skjalfti will be available at the LCBO. It can be hard these days to find a good full flavored lager - the Ölvisholt Brugghus Skjalfti is a Premium Lager which honorably reflrects the style, and has provided me with the perfect solution!"
"The appearance is a hazy straw colour with a head that recedes leaving no lacing. Sweet malt and earthy-pine hops are balanced in the light aroma. But there's a medium-high level of bitterness that stands out which lingers too long in the aftertaste for my palate."
"Clear light gold and decent head. Nose has an odd fruitiness to it, lychees and tropical fruit. Fairly bitter and sharply carbonated, again with a lychee flavour. Quite dry and a bit astringent with a herbal hop. Light toasted grain and caramel round out the flavours. A little bit on the acidic side as well. This one could use a bit more sweetness to balance the hops, but overall drinkability isn't bad."
"A nice drinking beer worth trying."
"While I may not be able to pronounce its name, I can say for certain that Skjálfti is good beer and Ölvisholt Brugghús, seemingly, is a gem of a little brewery. The name of the beer translates to 'earthquake', ironic considering it brings the two continents' styles together rather than dichotomize them. I understand that Icelanders have a reputation for drinking a lot - but with offerings like this who can blame them?"
"D - Nice solid, session brew. I dig the idea of a hopped-up steam beer, and the nose on this one is quite enjoyable. If it tasted a bit more like it smelled I'd actually get this semi-regularly."
"An excellent summer quaff, it's only too bad that the price doesn't correspond. Still, a quality offering and I would gladly try whatever else makes its way here from the far-off land of ice."
"Yellow body with initially a foamy head. Wafts initially a cheesy aroma, then reverts to a neutral one. A little lagerish taste, a tad beow average mouthfeel. Drinkable, but not too drinkable, and 500 ml. is too much for me. Rather uninteresting overall."
"A decent lager, and one that I could happily drink on the patio. Perhaps not enough complexity for many repeat visits, buta good 'lawnmower' beer."
"Bottle: Poured a bright golden color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of clean cereal with light residual sugar notes. Taste is also dominated by floral cereal with a clean dry finish with some subtle residual sugar notes. There is also some light cooked vegetables which I could have done without. Body is quite full with slight oily texture with good carbonation. Not bad thought it doesn't really stand out and the light DMS touch is not that pleasant."
"Reminds me of Brooklyn lager, though I think I like this one better!"
"Pours a copper colour with a nice white head. Smells sweet like fruit candy almost. Taste has some hops with a strong malt backbone. Very bready type taste that has some type of fruit in there. Very smooth and a great drinker. Probably not going to buy a lot at the price in Ontario, but a very nice beer."
"Well done Iceland! A great example of the style, very drinkable and refreshing. Sleeper hit for the summer."
"This beer smacks of quality and has a very unique personality all its own. I dig it."
"High marks for this one. Will it knocn you off your feet? Nope. But I can't come up with any drawbacks, and it fits the style to a 't'."
"I felt almost obligated to pick this one up because of the rarity or rather lack of availability of the style, and I'm very happy I did. On a hot summer's day, this beer would be on my top three to turn to. Worth a try for sure, and the perfect season to do it."
"I just saw this today at the LCBO, how nice to be the first reviewer from Toronto for a change. Big foamy off-white head, three fingers, low moderate carbonation, lots of sticky sheet lace. In due course, the head settled into a few large beige blotches floating atop a clear copper brew. There was a citrus fruit hoppy aroma on the pour and more sweet apricot and bready malt nose after it breathed; quite a pleasant smelling beer. The taste was more malty than hoppy with pine flavour and a resiny mouthfeel, earthy swallow, more pine and bitterness in the long lingering finish. Mouth is pine resiny, medium body, buttery texture. No hint of volcanic ash whatsoever. Overall, not bad at all and I'd gladly have another."
"A very satisfying but quenching lager with the unique character of ale hopped balance. Great innovation, I want more of this."
"To sweet and buttery in my opinion."
"Had a bottle of this in Stockholm last weekend. Poured with a white light head and lace. Color was slightly hazy medium amber. Aroma was nice with a slightly smokey & very slight citrus and apricot characteristics. Flavor's the same. Nice body. Excellent finish. A session beer."
"D - This is a very drinkable product. Interesting enough to keep going back to and pairs superbly well with varyous dishes. Both the aroma and taste of this beer has changed alot since it was first launched back in march 2008...towards hops, hell yeah!"
"Pours a one finger white head that lasts leaving a good lace. Crystal clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Malty/hoppy nose. Flavor is almost balanced leaning to hoppy, slight bitter finish. 330ml bottle 249 ISK ~ $2.99 Vínbúõin Hvolsvelli, Iceland. The name means earthquake - very appropriate for the country. From my notes - 7/22/2008."
