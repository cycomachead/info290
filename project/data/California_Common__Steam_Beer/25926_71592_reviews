"For a flagship beer, 1888 can hold itself together. It's a drinkable, all seasons beer."
"Pours a clear copper with a foamy beige head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some vegetal aromas. Taste is much the same with a herbal hop flavor on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that drinkable but not a good example of the style."
"O: I like the throwback idea, the flavour initally was not too hot, but comes back around as I drink it. Bottle at Hi-Times, very local, a solid effort in the end."

"O: Hard to say this was bad because it wasn't really offensive. It was just really...bland."
