"Final Thoughts: Akin to other IPLs that have come out in the past year or so. Would be better if it weren't for the off-flavor in the aftertaste. Would I drink it again? Maybe on tap, but I will be checking out the rest of their offerings."

"If their Pils is my favorite offering of Bauhau this is a very close second.   An interesting take on a California Common....an enjoyable and tasty take I might add.   The hops are evident but there is also a nice biscuity, nutty malt flavor.   Hops are flavorful not bitter...notes of peaches and apricots on the taste...aroma gives off some light citrus as well...highly drinkable....full of flavor...a definite winner here."

"Overall:  Tried a can from this new brewery in Minneapolis.  It's a pretty decent beer, nice flavor and easy to drink.  Probably a pretty good option for session drinking or to introduce craft beer to BMC folks."

"Overall: A very solid brew that is described as a California Common but comes off like a citrus forward American Pale Ale. Really good use of hops."
