"I can't fathom people rank this stuff so high."
"Semi dry base that leaves a lip smacking aftertaste. The hop is present but not excessive. Moderate but lasting aftertaste. Good body with low carbonation."

"The beer pours a surprisingly vigorous head that is bubbly and foamy and white. The beer itself is a deep and dark  copper to a dark ruby. The beer is clear. The beer has a strong malty smell that has a bit of hops. The taste of the beer is similar to the small. The beer has a strong malty taste but the taste is.closer to a sweet taste aith ander taste of toast. Hops are there but they are minimal. Hoppy aftertaste.  The feel is medium bodied and smooth with a clean finish. Overall,  a pretty fantastic commons and worth it."
"I want to like this one. Has alot of great elements, and still misses. Too watery, too lean."

"Overall: this is a straight middle of the road California common; maybe not a destination beer but it will do in a pinch."

"O: The more steam beers I try, the less I like them."
"Not a Steam Beer at all...Being that I have shared many Anchor Steam beers and brewed a common homebrew I was so upset at how far this beer really missed the mark..."
"Definitely sessionable but hopefully not here since it's an airport"
"Pours a fully hazed amber brown. Nice white head. Nose is slight hops anda touch of wood. Flavor is smooth with a slight wood tone and somewhat firm hops. Feel is a bit thin on the liquid aspect, but it starts off pretty silky. Heavily drinkable at first. My first sip turned out to be a few seconds long and became a long swig. But as time went on, it seemed to lose its luster and I had a hard time finishing it. I had to force the latter bit down."
"A nice easy drinking beer, would be a good session beer."
"prominent pilsner malt flavor, with a Euro hop flavor. more lively, fruity flavors come from the brewevidence of higher fermentation temps (actually, sometimes big wafts of fruitiness meet my tongue (and my nose))"
"sitting right @ the bar here, writing the review. about 100 ft. from home plate of Fenway. Anyway, this is on cask tonight. $4.50 a pint. Creamy head & mouthfeel. Amber color, little bit of hoppy smell and aftertaste. Set at room temp. but it's a bit hot for this tonight. Wish I could try other choices,"
"Drinkability: easy to quaff and could be a session beer. Nothing to right home about, but this beer is one of those you drink and don't over-analyze it."
"Poured an orange brown and was extremely hazy. Just a thin head which would form spotted lace around the glass. The nose was malts and lemon. The flavor was a bit disappointing. It was really sweet and I could not find the hops. The malts were very present and their sweetness was mellowed thanks to a nice woody background. The overall flavor of this beer is best described as iced tea. The mouthfeel was very watery. Shadowy body: At first is was pleasantly full, but it finished quite thin. The iced tea flavor detracted from the experience and did not leave me wanting a second beer."
"Medium bodied, to the light side, its a very good session beer, it's not hard to drink a few of these."
"Hazy copper, the haze is probably from the semi excessive use of hops in many ways and the yeast flavours are at a minimum  so this cask has dropped properly. Nice creamy tiny bubbled sticky lace. Very aromatic of fruity esters, raw hops and bready malt. Real smooth with a good malt foundation, fruitiness perks with flavours of melon, pear and peach. Big wave of hops both in bitterness and flavour hit the palate and seems to linger for a while with the fruitiness trailing along. Certainly a bold and expressive cask ale."
"A solid session beer. Its consistency is of water with flavour, making it dangerously easy to drink. Nice job on this cask ..."
