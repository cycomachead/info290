"Wasn't sure what to expect from this as I was unfamiliar with the term 'dampfbier' until now. Wasn't a good sign when I uncapped it and it immediately foamed over. After the overactive effervescence dissipated quite quickly, it's a pretty good-looking beer. Nice medium amber, opaque but no haze. Didn't get a lot on the aroma, so can't comment there. But the taste really did not do it for me. Everything about this beer was mild to the point of bland except the metallic aftertaste. Combine that with a dry finish, and I wasn't all that thrilled."

"500 ml bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of biscuit, cracker, toast, light caramel, pear, apple, floral, grass, pepper, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of bready malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of biscuit, cracker, toast, nuttiness, light caramel, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of biscuit, cracker, toast, nuttiness, light caramel, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of bready malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. A slight metallic note noticed on the finish, but not really detrimental to the flavor. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice steam beer style. All around good balance and robustness of bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid lager to drink for a long time."
"Though Local Option boasts it's ""ideal for warm months", I'd add the caveat that it's a relative claim: good for a warm, mild Bavarian summers, perhaps, but better suited to late-spring or early-autumn in places with truly hot, boggy ""warm months"".  All in all, however, Dampf Loc is a beer that makes one think—though I wouldn't deign to call it ""challenging""—while being very drinkable, if not especially delicious; and I'll add bonus points, moreover, for all the welcome historical and contextual patter the brewery provides the drinker."
"Have not tried too many Dampfbiers but this was an incredibly balanced, drinkable ale with tons of rich grain quality. Very glad to have had the opportunity to try this one."

"The better of the two beers I picked up from Local Option. Nice and clean and easy. Unexciting, but that's ok."
"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a half finger white head with excellent persistence and light lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, nuts, mildly sweet lactic; I don't know why but this is reminiscent of a mild milk stout. Flavor is similar to aroma with sweet caramel malt, nuts, mild grassy hops, finishes more attenuated with less malt with light nuttiness and faint hops. Nice medium body with some creaminess. A quite nice take on the California common style, a bit sweeter and nuttier, which is nice for a change. The initial flavors are reminiscent of a very light brown ale. Quite quaffable and interesting. If this is faithful to the Dampfbier style, I'm surprised they are no longer around. I enjoyed this one; could be my favorite of this style so far."

"O: I've never tried a ""Dampfbier"" before, but this seems to be an interesting and unique German style. It's quite malty but doesn't seem heavy on the palate and as a result is rather drinkable."
"we need more beer like this on the market, what a brilliant offering. copper in color, great active white head and rejuvenation ability. nose that's balanced with pale English and American malt, and west coast hops. minerally, clean, almost like a lager. the taste is fresh grains up front and balancing European style hopping on the back end. its more robust than any steam beer I have had before, more flavorful and interesting. grassy notes throughout, as well as a toasted nutty complex in the middle. still its quite light and easy drinking. medium body, very active carbonation, and crispness to the finish that maximizes refreshment. it really pepped me up this beer, impressed me. for a beer style that has been either forgotten or misinterpreted, this was really a breath of fresh air. id love to get this bottled out here in Colorado."

"Beer is medium-light to light in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a beer that is foamy, then smooth on the palate. Closes dry, with substantial stickiness remaining on palate."

"O) it is a good beer for summer!"

"O: While Dampf Loc is an uneven beer in some spots, it is likeable and drinkable."

"O- This beer has an amazing head with some great fresh malt flavor but the odd iced tea and bitter green hops finish is odd and really gets in the way of the taste."

"Interesting beer to see in my area. Kind of wish I brought my Local Option cervoise #properglassware to the bar with me, but oh well. Poured a darker amber color, more deep than hazy, with a small but firm cap of white head, that retained well and left spots of lacing on the glass. Malty sweet aroma, toasted grains, caramel, fruity esters. Sweet caramel malts were in charge again on the palate, toasted bread crusts, a little buttery, hops very mild and somewhat fruity/floral. I don't know...seemed a bit off-balance to me. There was a crispness to the mouthfeel that typically comes from the hops in a beer, but in this one, I just didn't get very much hoppiness in the flavor. Light-medium body. Not really bad overall, but just seemed somewhat off to me."

"The flavor has a surprising bitterness. Again, something which I hadn’t expected but it is definitely welcome. This was a welcome surprise and one which has me rethinking my expectations of the style."

"Easy drinking, and very thirst quenching. Good to know there are other Dampfbiers out there worth drinking."

"This is a good drinking beer, perhaps sessionable."

"On tap at Mission Dolores; served in a tulip glass. It pours a dark tan with a low head, not much lacing. The smell is vegetal and malty, with some notes of stone fruit going a little sour. The taste is very nice, lots of mellow malt with a twinge of bitterness, a faint tang in the background. It's a little thick, highly carbonated. I could drink quite a bit of this in a sitting, if it were a little less alcoholic. A fine beer."

"A great beer, I have actually had German Dampfbiers and this one pays tribute to the style pretty well."
"Smooth like a lager and crisp like a weissbier, this is a good mix with the subtle finish of bittering hops."
""
"Wow this beer looks great. I don't think I have see head on a beer from the US with this much retention and ""fluff"". Definately smells earthy and breadlike. The taste is english malty, but with just enough hops to make it slightly more hop forward. Like an ESB with an extra kick of hops. The hops are more bitter grassy. I'm not getting much citrus. Very good beer for sure. My only gripe is the price. If the local option was within the same price as, say a distant overseas option, then I'd go with this everytime."
"Earthy bitter aftertaste, very malt forward upfront with more toasted grain and husky grains in the middle. Effervescent feel, fairly light bodied and quaffable. Seemingly simple, but with enough nuance to keep things interesting. Would like to try on tap for comparison..."

"The historic hybrid beer calls out all of the acceptable descriptors that the style allows and does so with surprising balance. But there's a reason why today's Pale Ales have gained traction and why California Commons have faded into novelty. I appreicate the flavors of this beer if only for the quirky charm of retrospective nostalgia."

"And the reveal is…Dampf Loc by Local Option. Never heard of this beer or brewery but it has a sweet ass metal label with skulls and cross bones and what appears to be a freight train from hell on it. Looks like this a California Common/Steam so 0/1 on the style, but oh well, it's a good beer. Thanks again Kyle!"

"O: Is this a nice representation of the Bavarian peasant ale? I don't know, but it was good. I can definitely pick out the weisse yeast used and I think it's a nice touch. Definitely drinkable. I would obviously choose much more flavorful brews given the opportunity, but it was a nicely crafted beer."

"Clear gold in color. Served with a sizable foamy white head that reduced fairly quickly to a thick, stable surface coating. Lots of lacing. Aroma is of toasts and nuts with a perceptible bitterness that seems out of place. Taste is heavy on the toast, toasted grains, and wood. Maybe a little bready, with some grassy hops on the tail end. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation and a mild mix of bitterness and astringency. Overall a good beer (and one that I've never come across) that paired well with the Publican's meaty offerings."
"This stuff pours a clear copper topped by a finger of dusty white foam. The nose comprises toffee, walnuts, light flowers, and very light oak. The taste holds notes of toffee, pine sap, grass, flowers, light greens, and light oak. If I were pressed to sum it up, I would call this a richer version of a pils...something like that... The body is a hefty light, with a moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a nice, unique little brew, something that goes down easy and thoroughly satisfies. It'd be great if other breweries took this style on..."
