review_text
"Dark but clear amber, slightly off-white 1 inch head. Light lacing. Smell is odd, fruity, but attractive ... maybe a bit sour. Moderate carbonation. No sourness in the taste. Malty taste. Hops bitterness becomes more prominent as the beer warms. Body is OK... not too thin; in fact, a bit substantial for the style. This is a pleasant enough, refreshing beer, but not an outstanding beer."

"Hazy copper brew with an off white foam that recedes to a thin skien.  Lemony, black tea and grainy nose. More grain, lemon, some crackers and biscuits in the flavor.  Comes off malty but also sour. Thin body.  I'm not certain what style this is supposed to be ..Amber according to the label but its a bit on the lemony and sour side too. Confusing. It's more or less like a Lipton iced tea with added lemon flavors."

"This has a real grainy nose with some caramel notes over faint citrus and mint. It pours a light chestnut tinted amber under a 1‚Äù off-white foam cap that produces significant lace. Offers a very creamy palate beginning with very faint chocolate, grain, and light caramel with very nicely balanced malt sugar flavors. It starts with a light sweetness growing to a mild caramel biscuit flavor that dries out on the finish. The hops have a mild citrus mint flavor with a light bitter touch. Good balance between the hops and the malt. The malt flavors linger nicely. Medium body and a little above on the carbonation."
"This would be alright on tap with a cheap burger, but for something coming out of a bomber, I guess I was expecting a heck of a lot more. I'll probably order it again someday if I see it in a local grill or tavern, but I'll stick with something bolder for my fridge."
