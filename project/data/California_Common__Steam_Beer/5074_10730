The flavors were at first malty and nutty but it then went a little spicy with the hops before returning to the roasted malt finish that lingered on my tongue. Nicely layered.

If this was canned in 2004 asw the numbers may suggest than...it's sad that this one was still in circulation but I have to say, I've been to Wilbur's many times and this last visit was the first occasion that I saw this beer.

3.72,11,3,3.5,4,3,4,"Drinkability: Great. This is a very refreshing lager, a little on the thick side but still very satisfying. I will be purchasing more of this brew. I do have to say that I obtained this brew from the local brewery rep. after I had a bad bottle of their beer. Steamworks customer service is A+.","BadRockBeer","Apr 21, 2007"
3.53,5.4,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"It's a style I like for a day to day beer and I have no problem going back to this one. The only real issue is that it's more expensive than comparable beers like Yuengling or Karl Strauss Amber.","Domingo","Mar 24, 2007"
3.48,3.9,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Taste is more of a light lager I think. The malts are held down, and the hops don't grow. Overall the taste is sublte, yet it is a bit refreshing. Drinks quickly.","Mebuzzard","Mar 09, 2007"

4.13,23.3,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"This beer pours a nice reddish amber color, with a small white head. It smells sweet and hoppy, with a little bit of malt in the background. the taste is nice and crisp, with the malt showing just a bit, and the bite from the hops is good but not overwhelming. The mouthfeel is nice and balanced, much like the taste, quite good. I found this to be a very drinkable beer from a brewery that is fast becoming one of my favorites, at least if their other beers are as good as this and their Colorado Kölsch!","67cuda","Oct 18, 2005"

I said to myself. Now, I say, "lager, and damn good." this deserves the recognition they advertise on their bottle.","gbontrag","Aug 17, 2005"
