"Overall Impression- Light sweetness, good amount of malt and an appropriate amount of hops is all present. Glad I was finally able to enjoy this guy. Apparently not even the Tap Room and Bottleworks has this one available! Only for Pi. Come by and enjoy!"
"Overall - 4.5/5 - a very enjoyable lighter beer"

"Very well done! Easy drinking malty bliss!"
"Pours a moderate golden color with a good white head and a bit of lacing on the way down. The nose carries some light grain and perhaps a touch of fruit. Flavor is likewise pretty tame without very much going on. Light-medium body with good carbonation and a semi-dry finish, though the body is just a bit chewy. Average."

"Beer is fine except there is a huge aftertaste that the more you drink the more work it does on your palate. It is acrid and harsh, the rest of the beer is nice, sweet, mildly, a little yeasty, a decent steam beer buried under the avalache of the aftertaste. Too bad. Mulligan?"
"Medium mouthfeel and a bit of a hard finish on the palate. Decent try overall and very different than other Schlafly offerings, of which i am a big fan."
"nice flavor that paired quite well with the pizza and garlic bread i had. i enjoyed this and will seek this out again."
"M & D - Crisp and clean. Overall a forgettable beer by an otherwise good brewery."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of hops, slight citrus, slight sweet malt, and slight grain. Fits the style of a California Common / Steam Beer. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, sweet malt, wet hops?, slight roasted malt, and hint of citrus. Overall, a decent beer with good blend."
