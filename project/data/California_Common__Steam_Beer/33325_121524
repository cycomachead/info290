4.1,13.9,,,,,,"A bit hazy, yellow orange in color, foamy white head. mild aroma, slightly sweet. Same with taste. Grainy malt, cracked corn, a bit of earthiness, some noble hops? Medium body and carbonation. Very easy to drink, and nice mild flavor.  Great for a hot New Orleans day.","jmdrpi","Aug 31, 2014"
