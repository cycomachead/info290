"Amber in color topped by a stiff foamy persistent cap.  Looks good.  Great lace.  This smells like a rich lager beer. Grain, honey, biscuit, soft malt. The taste is intriguing.  There's the hint of spruce right away.  Then a berry-honey wash of sweetness.  Now more biscuit and bread. A nice bitter hop here keeps it all clean and dry. Great flavor, nothing over the top. Smooth and well-crafted body. This is a tasty easy drinking beer."

"Final Thoughts: I had this fresh over a month ago and it was even tastier. Usually I wouldn't suggest springing for a sixer but with the high ABV and Summit's low prices (locally) it is a steal. Would I drink it again? Yes."

"Overall:  Can't say I'll put this ahead of many other possibilities...but it is interesting, and I'll give some credit for that."

"O-Not one of my favorite unchained offerings.   The writeup sounded great but nothing I would seek out again."

"Overall: Pretty good experimental beer. I expected more exciting flavors from the maple syrup and spruce, but didn't detect much of it in the taste. I've never had such a bitter, hoppy lager (is it an IPL, or an IPCC?) , and it was pretty good. It's already really good as it is, but like I said earlier, I feel that the hops overpowered the malt and the rest of the flavors a little too much. Some age to mellow out the hops might do well for it, and Summit itself even suggests aging."

"The bitterness is just way too much in this for me.  Harsh bitterness drowns out the maple and spruce, with just a bit of maltiness in the background."
"This is amazing stuff from Summit. I am sad to think that soon its not going to be available. I've been stockpiling (and subsequently drinking) six packs. It is big and bold and bitter. The taste is smooth yet bitter and piney. There is a faint trace of the maple syrup. This is a perfect beer from a cold MN fall night."

"Overall:  I was expecting this to taste a little weirder than it did.  It mostly tasted like a pretty standard pale ale to me.  Worth a try."

"O:  I liked this more than I thought I would especially after giving it a chance to warm up."

"Overall: A very good twist on a Cali Common style brew. Good bitter and piney taste of hops and spruce tips along with some good sweet malt notes."

"I didn't think I was going to like this beer. I am generally not a fan of lagers, and the Summit Unchained series has been more miss than hit for me. But this one has been a pleasant surprise. I can't say I really notice the maple syrup or spruce tips, but if I were forced to drink lagers for the rest of my life, I would put it in my rotation. It's fairly balanced, with a clean, bitter finish, and a maltiness that lives up to its dark, well past amber, hue. Can I detect maple? No. Did I like it? Yeah."

"O: While the smell is lacking, the flavor and appearance are outstanding. This is a welcome addition to my fridge while it's available. I hope it becomes at least a seasonal, if not a regular in Summit's stable."

"O - Herkulean Woods, as the name suggests, is a big and bold earthy beer with deep malt and maple syrup complexity that underlines it's aggressive hop bite and sharp spruce addition!"
"This is very nice, indeed."
""
"O - Fascinating and tasty lager; I fully expected it to be much more malty with a subtle hop/pine presence. I was wrong. If you like a big hop and pine bitter beer, you should give this a try."
""

"Dark amber color, pleasant, if weak, aroma with pine (well, spruce, I guess) evident. This is a much more bitter beer than I usually like, but I like this one because of the mix of the maple syrup with the bitters of the hops/tips. This is especially evident in the finish… piney bitterness with a very nice sweetness. Very good, Summit. Kudos to brewer Christian Dixon. A high in bitterness beer I actually like!"
""
"Nice job, Summit. A touch disappointed that the maple syrup was evidently spilled on the brewery floor – must have made quite the mess – but what’s left behind is a very good beer. Will have no trouble putting a couple of these down with my winning poker hands tomorrow night."

"Overall: This is a very good strong, sweet and bitter lager that fits in nicely with the Oktoberfests of the season."
