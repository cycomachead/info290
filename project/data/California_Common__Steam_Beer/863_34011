3.68,1.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Draught at the brewpub during RBSG09. Toasty amber color, lightly hazy, with a white head. Subtle herbal hops and toasty malt aroma. The flavor is a great example of balance, with toasty and caramel malt flavors mixing with herbal hops. More hop flavor than anchor steam, but along the same lines. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. A very solid, easier drinking offering from Russian River. Like pretty much every beer they make, you can tell that a lot of thought was put into its construction.","bulletrain76","Aug 29, 2009"

3.88,7.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Had this on-tap at the brewpub in Santa Rosa. Not my favorite style, but I like the history of the style and the California connection. Still, this was one of the better ones I've had of the style. Pours a light orange/amber with a relatively thin but silken head and superb lacing. Smells relatively light and grainy and with a very light lemony fruitiness. Tastes less grainy, but there is still a bit of graininess. There is also the typical ale and lager combo of yeastiness with some earthy and citrusy hoppiness, some more of that light lemon flavor, and a finish of spent grain, like a small beer. Very, very smooth and easy to drink.","Georgiabeer","Aug 06, 2009"
3.93,8.9,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"D - Great steam beer with lots of flavor and plenty of hop bitterness, but not too much of either. Really tasty stuff, and a nice example of the style.","ffejherb","Jul 12, 2009"

3.78,4.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"RBSG09 on tap at the brewpub. Pours dark orange with a thick, cascading, light-beige head. Aroma is nice fresh bread dough with some fruity hops and a metallic note. Flavor is milky and doughy, with light caramel sweetness and some citrus. Nice bitterness and a dry finish.","illidurit","Apr 18, 2008"
3.67,1.7,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"This was my first time trying this beer. Definitely has a RR twist on a style that I typically do not order. This one is a lot better after it has warmed for at least 10 minutes. Not bad, but with so many others on the board, I would go for something else.","mjl21","Jan 30, 2008"
2.09,-42.1,3.5,2,2,2,2,"The taste is pine, a hint of grass, and only a weak, burnt toast flavour for the malt. It's too bitter, mostly just hops, without the fullness of body or flavours to back this up. It may not be very bitter on an absolute scale, but it's far too bitter considering its other qualities.","Offa","Nov 27, 2006"
4.23,17.2,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability- Damn, I wish I had tried this earlier. I see a growler of this in the future this coming summer. Hopefully it's still around.","GClarkage","Beers"
