2.75,-21.7,,,,,,"Is it steamy in here, or is it just this beer?  Anyway, this stuff pours a clear copper-bronze topped by a finger of dirty white foam.  The nose comprises toffee, dried malt, mild flowers, milder pine, and a touch of candied orange peel.  The taste brings in more of the same, though with a heavy, overarching dose of conflicting maple syrup and pine resin.  This coupling clashes constantly, drowning out the otherwise mild and genial characters.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda dry and crisp finish.  Overall, this is a bit too messy of a beer to do much good anywhere.  It could be worse, though, so I guess there's that...","TMoney2591","Aug 26, 2014"

This is an odd beer...I like the concept, but it doesn't quite deliver a 'double california common' it does provide the double strength which is probably why it doesn't get a better score since the alcohol kind of holds it back from being more enjoyable.","Slatetank","Dec 20, 2013"

This sweet adjunct flavor was evident in the nose but is much stronger here and really hurts the flavor of the beer. I'm not sure if it's just in my head but there is a sweet corn or rice flavor that is really sweet, overtaking over the hops and interesting malt notes. There's a touch of boozy heat in the finish but the high ABV is nicely masked. Not harsh per se but the hop flavors are muted and the off flavors make it tough to finish a small serving.","corby112","Dec 16, 2013"

It was nicely balanced had a nice hop finish to clamp down on the solid malty backbone. My only complaint is that it's a bit thin. Not to the point of being watery, but a little less robust than I would have liked. I won't put this on a ""favorites"" list. but it's a thoroughly enjoyable beer.","LCB_Hostage","Dec 08, 2013"

3.52,0.3,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a good example of the style. I haven't had a lot of steam beers and I've certainly never had an imperial version, but I thought this beer did a good job at sticking to the basic steam beer formula but making each aspect bolder then it normally is. This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth, but it was a little filling and the I think I would get bored of the taste eventually so I think one is enough for me, and I think the sweetness also hurts the drinkability a little. What i liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was and the appearance, I thought both of those aspects were pretty good. What I liked the least was the sweetness and thickness, I thought they could be both be toned down a little. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it really not the type of beerddd that I would normally buy, but I would recommend it as a good strong version of a Steam beer. All in all I wasn't too let down with this beer, even though it was a little rough around the edges I thought it was solid for what it was going for and I thought it was also a pretty good deal for an 8% beer. Solid works guys, I'll keep a look out for more beers from this series.","StoutHunter","Nov 17, 2013"

In fact, this is probably my first one. On to the beer... Rich copper color, lively carbonation, and a healthy white foam head that lingers. Smell is clean, with notes of herbal (Northern Brewer?) hops and light pale malt notes. Taste really wows as it's not heavy or sweet like I was expecting. Very drinkable, full-flavored. Good clean flavor from the lager yeast, neutral malt character (just a touch of toasty flavor), and a really nice snappy hop finish. That finish is clean and biting, and I just love whatever hops they used to do this. The strength of the beer is undetectable...until you finish; then you feel that this one packs a little more booze than normal. I was left really wishing I had gotten a six-pack instead of just a single. Definitely recommended, particularly if you like steam beers.","JEdmund","Aug 30, 2013"

I think that fans of sweeter styles of beer such as Bocks will really enjoy this one. It has enough bitterness to cut through the sweetness at the end, which really helps out with drinkability.

Excellent lacing. No real carbonation to be seen coming up from the bottom. Nose is lager yeast with a faint touch of sweet lemon. Herbal hops, light grass, sweet malt, corn and honey. There’s even a little mint, a touch of tobacco and some light toast. Taste is sweet but not heavy. Without much carbonation it’s very soft on the palate. Hops are bitter but a little shy. Herbal, minty, grainy, nutty and a little warmth from the alcohol. There’s a nice oily coating but no bitter bite that usually goes with that. The malt is sweet and full and there is just a touch of pine on the back palate. Body is thin and it drinks creamy. I’ve never had anything like it. Finishes dry and crisp.

Pours a crystal clear amber body with a cream colored head, kind of thin textured in appearance, fine speckled lacing patterns left behind as it settles. Aroma semi sweet nose, muted a bit served cold at first after warming not much more opens up. Flavor has the same raw earthy bitterness that the Steam beer from San Fran has, semi sweet bread mostly a subdued caramel sweetness with evident alcohol with a minimal light syrup texture. Drinks down way too easy especially for 8 percent abv it doesn't offend in anyway it's just a solid drinking beer about as refreshing as an Anchor, just with more malts shining through. Mouthfeel light residual sugars on the palate even carbonation light to medium bodied not cloying at all, alcohol is just barely evident. Overall, a beer that will get your non craft beer drinkers wasted, even though this beer is flavored toward a newbie into craft beer with somewhat of a lack of complexity they did what they wanted to do and stayed true to the originators of the style.","WVbeergeek","Jun 06, 2013"

Almost like a whole grain raisin swirl bread without any cinnamon or much sweetness. Earthy bitter grain with earthy bitter hops and overall clean flavor profile. Not very refreshing for the season but it is a pretty goo beer and does place your mind in some wild wild west saloon with will smith and those weird spider bots. Seems like the most refreshing thing that would've been available. That was off topic but overall a pretty nice beer with traits common to a steam beer and alcohol that is undetectable even at dead warm temperatures. A little drier than most steam beers with less fruitiness.","jtierney89","Apr 24, 2013"
