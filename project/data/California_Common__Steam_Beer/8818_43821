3.08,-1.3,3,3,3,3.75,3,"Pours a clear orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and biscuit aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and caramel flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable but nothing really stands out about it.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 24, 2013"

2.31,-26,3,2.5,2,2.25,2.5,"Overall - I'm normally a big fan of amber ales but in this instance, I'm not excited about it. This is their flagship beer, the one that everyone in the area knows about. I am no more than 10 minutes from this brewery and have yet to go to it. I am hoping that this is a bad batch and not the standard. I really want to give this another try directly from the brewery, hopefully it will be different.","BeerEngineer","0"

The flavor is sort of bland. It’s just sort of sweet with a little bit of malt flavor. It’s mostly just grainy and bland.","womencantsail","Feb 04, 2012"

2.89,-7.4,3.5,2,3.5,2,3,"O - Overall, a very average beer. A slightly sweet, fairly light beer that is easily drinkable but won't set the world on fire with what it does, which is nothing exceptional, but not I wouldn't classify it as a bad beer either.","olafisberserker","Jan 23, 2011"
2.6,-16.7,4.5,2,2,2.5,4,"All in all, this sucks. No worries about this one. I am starting to think that this brewery wants to be Budweiser. No flavors, just water.","steve8robin","Oct 15, 2010"

3.18,1.9,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a light amber color with a white head. The aroma is toffee and earthy hops. The flavor is toffee, earth and some citrus hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Nothing special here, but nothing too offensive either.","Mora2000","Nov 22, 2009"
2.52,-19.2,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,2,"Pours a one finger white head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Almost clear amber color. Nose has hints of light piney hops. Flavor is mildly hoppy, indistinct. Dry piney finish. $4.49 for a 22oz bottle from Liquorama Upland, CA.","jdhilt","May 02, 2009"

2.44,-21.8,4,2.5,2.5,2,2,"Maybe I'm just too sensitive to diacetyl, but in this beer it adversely affects the smell, taste, and mouthfeel. I only made it through half the bottle, and that still felt like several sips too many. If I saw it on tap somewhere I'd probably try to talk the bartender into giving me a sample, just to compare it to the bottle. But if I had to make a decision based on this bottle, I wouldn't try it again, nor could I recommend it.","vurt","Beers"
