"A solid California Common Lager. Quite tasty."
""
""
""
""

"Notes:  Very well brewed great dryness as well as a good balance between hoppiness and sweetness.  Cheers."
"Great lager during a hockey game!"
"Nothing if not bland. This was my first experience with Baxter Brewing Co and I must say I'm disappointed."
""
""
"Too bland for my taste. Maybe it's the style I am not too familiar with."
""
"I did not enjoy this style of beer."
"The feel of this beer is smooth with a medium body that goes down easy. There is some hop aftertaste that hides until the end and makes things feel bigger than before."

"O: Definitely grew on me. Nice to have a sweeter lager that's not overly sweet."

"OVERALL: Good Solid Lager with above average ABV (5.3%) that Doesn't Over-Power You....I enjoyed It....and will Purchase it again....But I WON'T be Rushing Back To The Store for MORE."

"Pours a brownish color with little head. Very faint smell. A decent little lager. Malty and an easy finish. Nothing spectacular here. Overall good though."

"Pours nicely from the can, with a chestnut brown color, white head, and decent lacing. Mostly clear and inviting. Sweet malts up-front on the nose with caramel, cherries, and not much else detected. Very light aroma. Taste is clean and refreshing. Malty, with a hint of damp basement in-mouth and a dryish finish. Sweet tea, wood, chocolate caramel, and a touch if sediment round out the flavors. The mouthfeel is pretty unobtrusive, with a clean finish and polished overall feel. Overall it's a nice lager, but lacks a distinctive trait to help it stand out."

"Poured from a can into a shaker pint, the beer is a crystal-clear, copper coloring, with a steady flow of carbonation, and a bubbly, fluffy, clingy, off-white head. Nose of toasted grains, subtle toffee sweetness, and roasted notes throughout. Flavors are roasted caramel sweetness forward, with an underlying hops bitterness and roasted character. Richly sweet throughout, on a slick, mid-body. The aftertaste is roasted, as well, with a sweet caramel characteristic, and some nutty notes mixed in. Clean, smooth finish. More body than what I would expect from the style, but damn tasty and drinkable."

"Overall not bad, I do like the malt base, and aroma is decent, but the hops turn up a bit too much on the taste for a nice lager, at least in this case it just overpowers it, something like American Darling they go well as the lager and malts are stronger and they balance, this just goes a little overboard on the hops. Still a nice crisp enjoyable summer lager."

"The taste is better balanced--the hop is far more pronounced. Dry finish but with a caramel overtone. The aftertaste is biting and bitter, but not long lasting. Full body but the carbonation is high as well."

"Overall: Baxter seems to have phased out Amber Road in favor of this brew. I dug Amber Road a lot but this is a really good beer and will probably appeal to a broader audience. I had one with a grilled cheese on a sunny day and it was, as we say in Maine, of the finest kind."
""
""
"O) A decent brew. I'd drink another one."
""

"Overall a pretty clean, solid offering from Baxter, definitely better than most of their stuff. Ends up being a bit too sweet and lacking crispness towards the end of the pint. (3)"

"The beer pours a creamy, very light amber/rich golden color with a silky, off-white head of medium-sized bubbles. In body, the beer is clean and translucent, with just a slight haze from the beer’s rich coloring. Bubbles are a constant fixture within the beer, and punch towards the surface with quite a lot of tenacity, keeping the head rocky at about a fourth of a finger’s width. The head leaves some nice fluffy lacing as it moves down the glass. On the nose, the beer smells of caramel, cream corn, slight cider, herbal hops, and a finish of sweet bread. The cream corn is a little strong in the nose, but not off-putting. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet with a bitter back finish that balances out the beer. There is a little earthiness in the beer, adding slight complexity, but really this is a simple sweet and bitter beer. In flavor, it tastes of cream corn, crackers, soft caramel, and very faint watermelon. These flavors slide into a finish of herbal and grassy bitter hops that blend and mellow the sweetness, leaving a slight metallic twinge on the finish and aftertaste. Again, the DMS seems a little high in the initial sip, though it’s nicely drinkable and inoffensive. As you drink more of the beer, the bitters tend to grow and provide a nice bite that covers up much of the cream corn character. In the mouth, the beer feels light bodied with just a little gelling. The carbonation is fluffy and full, and the mouthfeel is silky (nearly syrupy) with a nice little crispness on the finish. After the beer leaves, the mouth is left slightly wet, but fairly neutral, making it perfect for another sip. From the can I detect little to know change in the drinking experience, aside from the slight metallic bite, which is actually quite pleasant in this particular beer. Overall, the beer is refreshing and simple. The DMS is a little high, but still manageable, and the flavors are all inoffensive. I’d place this a step above the Adjunct Lagers. It’s easy to drink, refreshing, and mild in flavor. Not a bad beer, but not amazing either. A nice, simple (almost) session lager."

"Big fan of the Common/Steam style, and this is a great addition to the very small field. Light golden amber color which was a little lighter than I expected. Aroma was pure Steam beer, the minty, woody Northern Brewer hops were easily picked up was the nice biscuit like malt backbone. The taste was a home run, a nice fruity malt flavor from fermenting at ale temps with just enough of the hops coming through to balance the beer perfectly. Overall, in my opinion, this gives Anchor Steam a run for it's money. This will be a staple in my beer fridge!"

"A nice balance is found between the earthy hops and toasted caramel grains. Very crisp and one that can be quaffed. Nice to see someone brewing a Steam Beer in New England."

"Beer pours an absolutely crystal clear golden amber with two finger head. Smell is of lager yeast and toasted malt. Great lacing in the glass. Initial caramel malt sweetness finishing just a tad drier than the initial taste. Good carbonation level, very pleasant. Great beer, in a style that is so often overlooked."
"The taste has a bit more character than the nose with the same caramel maltiness but a decent bitter and dry finish. Drinkable for certain."
"O-Common Beer's have never been my cup of tea but this one is different. I've only had a few of the style butt his one is probably my favorite."

"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s a solid beer but there are better choices within the style."
""
"Served from the can and poured into a 12 oz mug. The appearance is golden/red and very clear. The aroma is very much sweet without a hop note to be found. The mouth feel is crisp and carbonated. The taste is where this beer goes down hill; it is an absolute malt bomb with little encouraging me to open the next can from the 6 pack."
