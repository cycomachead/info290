"Recommendation: Don't be scared by the description, this one's worth seeking out."
"Oak brown with a medium head that dissappears quickly. Lots of carbonation bubbles. Smells a little like bud light, which is a turn off. Taste is a little acidic, lemons and pine needles. Carbonation and a light-medium body. Sour flavor dominates but isn't so much that it's distasteful, but not a lot of complexity in the flavor either."

"Original Review,  It's time for a Short Short's review, this one was just ok, it was for sure unique and it had an interesting slightly sour finish, it was nice to try, but it's nor really something that I think needs to be Bottled.  This was served on firkin and the carbonation was very low."
