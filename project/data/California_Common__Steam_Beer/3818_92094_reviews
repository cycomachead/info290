"Is it steamy in here, or is it just this beer?  Anyway, this stuff pours a clear copper-bronze topped by a finger of dirty white foam.  The nose comprises toffee, dried malt, mild flowers, milder pine, and a touch of candied orange peel.  The taste brings in more of the same, though with a heavy, overarching dose of conflicting maple syrup and pine resin.  This coupling clashes constantly, drowning out the otherwise mild and genial characters.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda dry and crisp finish.  Overall, this is a bit too messy of a beer to do much good anywhere.  It could be worse, though, so I guess there's that..."

"I think that this experiment proves that not all beer styles are better ""doubled"" or ""imperialed."""

"While this is a fine drinking beer, it lacks the crisp refreshing qualities one typically seeks late on a long hot summer day."

"O: It wasnt a bad beer. It was my first California Common which I understand is a lager that is fermented at higher temperatures. Would I buy this again? Probably not for myself. Although the wife liked this one a lot, so I guess it depends who you are."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty tasty beer that was more complex than I expected from a California Common/Steam Beer, and I think that the ABV showing through separated this from the pack in this style so I definitely want to have this again."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is medium full but with heavy carbonation.... Takes the heaviness of a double beer with the crispness of a pilsner of lager and works it well!!! I enjoyed this and am mad I did not get more then a single when it was around.... If it was round next year I will not make the same mistake!"
""
""
" The taste is pretty decent with some malty flavors which are toasted and slightly caramel with some very nice hop flavors which are both woody and slightly spiced with some mild yeast flavors which seem to clash ever so slightly making the malt come forward along with a mild alcohol infused finish. This is an odd beer...I like the concept, but it doesn't quite deliver a 'double california common' it does provide the double strength which is probably why it doesn't get a better score since the alcohol kind of holds it back from being more enjoyable."
""
"On the lighter end of medium body with a bitter grassy hop presence up front that's countered by a very sweet malt backbone and an unpleasant metallic adjunct like character that lingers long into the finish. This sweet adjunct flavor was evident in the nose but is much stronger here and really hurts the flavor of the beer. I'm not sure if it's just in my head but there is a sweet corn or rice flavor that is really sweet, overtaking over the hops and interesting malt notes. There's a touch of boozy heat in the finish but the high ABV is nicely masked. Not harsh per se but the hop flavors are muted and the off flavors make it tough to finish a small serving."
""
"This is a classic ""better than a sum of it's parts"" beer. After reading a lot of reviews talking about how sweet this beer was, I was expecting not to like it too much. But honestly, I didn't get any of the sweetness others referred to. It was nicely balanced had a nice hop finish to clamp down on the solid malty backbone. My only complaint is that it's a bit thin. Not to the point of being watery, but a little less robust than I would have liked. I won't put this on a ""favorites"" list. but it's a thoroughly enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a good example of the style. I haven't had a lot of steam beers and I've certainly never had an imperial version, but I thought this beer did a good job at sticking to the basic steam beer formula but making each aspect bolder then it normally is. This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth, but it was a little filling and the I think I would get bored of the taste eventually so I think one is enough for me, and I think the sweetness also hurts the drinkability a little. What i liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was and the appearance, I thought both of those aspects were pretty good. What I liked the least was the sweetness and thickness, I thought they could be both be toned down a little. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it really not the type of beerddd that I would normally buy, but I would recommend it as a good strong version of a Steam beer. All in all I wasn't too let down with this beer, even though it was a little rough around the edges I thought it was solid for what it was going for and I thought it was also a pretty good deal for an 8% beer. Solid works guys, I'll keep a look out for more beers from this series."

"12 oz bottle from ""Lifesource"" grocery in Salem OR $2.19 Holy cow 8%!! a steam? Pours a beautiful golden colour with a large ,thick and frothy off white head. Malty aroma..bready,a lot of cereal ( Cream o wheat),herbal and a touch of fruit as expected from style. Taste is like the aroma but sweeter and with a good touch of warming alcohol..but not over the top. Mouthfeel is good and substantial..smooth. nice. Really don't know how to judge this beer ..but i like it but maybe one bottle would be enough."

"O- This is pretty good version of a California Common. Of course I compare it to Anchor Steam which prefer, but this has a surprising level of tartness that I found interesting and not to dominate and refreshing. I picked up a 6-pack of this for 5 bucks at my local bottle shop, how could I not pick it up!?"
""
"OV: An interesting beer. I've never had the style before, so had no preconceived notions about what to expect here. The flavour is good and the mouthfeel very nice. An interesting mix of flavours that work pretty well together and the 8% ABV is well hidden. Good effort from ST."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: Haven't had a steam beer in years since Anchor Steam ""back in the day"". Interesting brew and kudos to ST for going for something different. Good, not great."
"Not a bad beer, but nothing particularly special, and for the style, I found the alcohol a bit more prominent then I would like."
"Overall - A good interpretation of the style I guess. It's quite boring and has the taste of a session beer with enough booze to slow you down. Another beer worth trying but not something I'd pick up again."
""
""
""
"O-Maybe it is the style, but this beer did nothing for me. On a summer say it is refreshing but not very flavorful."
""

"just a tad too heavy to be golf course beer, and I made that mistake. that's on me. however, this is a nice fall brew, being a real malt forward offering and something highly rare as far as I know, an imperial steam style. smelling like german and English malts, caramel and toffee abound, but its not that sweet. liquid bread comes to mind, if it weren't for the ale yeast, which is bright and punctual, dabbing in and out with a lightness that seems to temper an otherwise heavy grain forward brew. almost lager clean in the finish, something to behold in terms of mouthfeel. could use a touch more vigorous carbonation, but the big body is right on. not my favorite of the 2x beers, but I absolutely caught this one out of context. full autumnal, I am wring to critique this fun beer too hard. great buzz for the price too, a sixer is a chore."
""
""
"Overall: A style you don't see too many breweries try, but this beer is enjoyable and good."
""
"I was really surprised and blown away by this beer. For one, steam beers are anything but common, and to find an imperialized version of one is pretty much unheard of. In fact, this is probably my first one. On to the beer... Rich copper color, lively carbonation, and a healthy white foam head that lingers. Smell is clean, with notes of herbal (Northern Brewer?) hops and light pale malt notes. Taste really wows as it's not heavy or sweet like I was expecting. Very drinkable, full-flavored. Good clean flavor from the lager yeast, neutral malt character (just a touch of toasty flavor), and a really nice snappy hop finish. That finish is clean and biting, and I just love whatever hops they used to do this. The strength of the beer is undetectable...until you finish; then you feel that this one packs a little more booze than normal. I was left really wishing I had gotten a six-pack instead of just a single. Definitely recommended, particularly if you like steam beers."

"Copper penny color. Thin layer of foam on top. Light malt and that familiar California common yeast aroma. The mouthfeel is smooth and crisp. Very malty profile with the familiar yeast flavoring. I get some hop interplay in the back of the palate. Never had an imperialized California common. It is pretty good, but not amazing."
""
""
"O: This beer is relatively easy to drink considering its strength compared to other beers in the style."
""
"Just not quite enough to back up the abv. I think. Interesting attempt, but I wouldn't look for another imperial steam beer after this one."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/30/2013. Pours lightly hazy orange amber color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, apple, pear, toast, biscuit, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, pear, apple, biscuit, floral, grass, light pine, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, apple, pear, floral, grass, light pine, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt, hop, and yeast flavors; with good flavor robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice imperial steam beer. Good balance of malt, yeast, and hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"Overall- I would honestly take BMC over this. I usually like Southern Tier's products but this is a failure. Pass on this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is very nice beer, the bread dough emphasis an excellent choice, and the sugars and hops providing good overall balance. Eminently drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-not a bad beer, drinkability is good but alcohol I think hinders the flavor. Probably wont get it again but worth trying once"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a rather simplistic offering from ST. It's brewed to style and has decent drinkability given its size. It's a bit dry and the alcohol is noticeable, but there is enough depth to enjoy. As a beer this is a bit forgettable, but for the style it's on point."
""
""
"O: Even though the alcohol is a little on the higher side for the style (intentionally, of course), this is a solid steam beer. Easy to drink for a spring brew, where things are starting to get a little warmer but it's still on the colder side. A welcome addition to the line-up"
"Overall – It's a hybrid of the California Common style. The ABV (nearly double the CA Common style) is fairly well balanced with hop bitterness/flavor. Very full and alcoholic to be a session beer but, with all that said...I enjoyed it and would purchase again."
""
"Overall – Sorta like a thicker and creamier malt liquor with a bit more hop than normal. Like a high end malt liquor. Not too bad if that is what you are in the mood for actually."
""
"A good beer, but it's just a bit much. The melanoidin character is quite strong and needs dialed back to improve it's drinkability, perhaps replaced with Munich (if indeed, that is what they are using). One of these is plenty."
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good beer for the style. I'm a fan of most of the Southern Tier beers I've tried, so I figured it was a must I tried this beer when I saw it. I wouldn't buy an entire 6 again, but could see myself having one or two as a session beer on the beach."

"Pretty god beer. Poured cold, with smallish, cream-colored head that soon settled and almost no lace. Color is a clear deep, orange-copper-amber with plenty of bubble trails. Aroma is hop, malt, oak, spice. Flavor’s like nose, plus caramel and Is rich. Body is full, not too counter to its heavy bitterness, and has great carbonation. Finish is like flavor, with bitter hanging in there to the end."
""
""
""
"12oz bottle from ABC Liquor in Orlando. Poured a clear pale orange body with a two-finger off white head. Aroma of Nilla wafers, milk (yeah milk), and starfruit. Medium-light body body and slightly sticky texture. Medium carbonation. Flavor is light butterscotch and pink grapefruit muted by piney long hop finish. A refreshing brew, starting with interesting spicy quality anf finishing like an IPA. Nice brew. Creative."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden amber color with a large off-white head with good retention and lacing. The aroma is mostly malt with very little in the way of hops. The taste starts out with a good amount of malt and is followed by a lingering bitterness from the hops. I'm enjoying this one, it has a great balance between the malt and hops and is pretty drinkable for an 8% ABV beer. As the beer warms in the glass, the hops do become more pronounced."
"Pours a clean orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, a mellow and a sweet malt. In the taste, a sweet malt that fades into a dryer hairspray like alcohol presence. A small bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry malt and small hairspray like aftertaste. Eh, I suppose it's ok, just a bit boozy."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Making a ""double"" version of a steam beer is certainly an interesting experiment, but ultimately one that in my opinion does not have to be repeated"
"O: I think the suped up version of a California Common/Steam (higher ABV) is an interesting idea but needs to have the booze a little more well hidden from the taste to be really enjoyable for me."
""
""
"Overall: This wasn't bad, but I had certainly expected better. This is a unique style and I applaud Southern Tier for trying this but it definitely isn't something I feel the need to buy again."
""
""
""
"O: While this beer is somewhat uneven in spots, it's still an appealing beer. Drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On to the beer though. High grain presence it seems. Quite a lot of malt sweetness as well. Almost seems boozy, from a whole whopping 8% it's carrying. Decent enough to drink, just nowhere near as inspiring or interesting as other brews Southern Tier has done."
"Poured out as a nice deep golden color with a soapy white head on top. The lacing is minimal and the retention is thin. The smell of the beer has a big amount of toasted malt on the nose, not much in the way of hops. The taste has the same toasted flavor as what the nose was kind of giving a preview too. The beer is a little sweet with a subtle bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a pretty good carbonation to it. Overall this beer is decent. Nothing too crazy but was nice to try."
"O: This is a very memorable beer. There is a lot going on, so I wouldn't call it a clean beer. The only downfall could be that it has too much going on but there seems to be enough separation in the flavors from keeping it too muddled. I think that fans of sweeter styles of beer such as Bocks will really enjoy this one. It has enough bitterness to cut through the sweetness at the end, which really helps out with drinkability. While looking, smelling, and tasting the beer it is clear that effort was put into making a good quality beer."

"Poured one and a half bottles into a 1/2 liter stein wich brought good clarity to a copper/bronze body and a nicely defined one finger creamy-like head atop.Very clean nose with only mild toastiness and caramel sweetness.A full almost creamy feel to the beer is by far the best part of it.Flavors have subdued caramel and doughy sweetness up front more mild sweetness coming from the alcohol and a honey tinge,hops are subdued just giving a faint flash of leafiness,I even detect a sour note, although very light in the finish.Iam not sure about a double steam style but I Iam a big fan of ST going back to my western NY days."
"Overall: an easy to quaff beer. I think this represents the style well despite the higher alcohol content."
""
"Overall- I like it considering the fact it is a bigger version of the style. It does have that woodsy feel to it, but the alcohol is not well hidden in the taste which makes it less drinkable. All in all its pretty good, wouldn't seek out but worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad brew, definitely something different for me but not anything new. Has a little bit of everything, Grab a glass and enjoy...Salud!"
"Interesting beer, drinkability is not that high though."
""
""
""
"Overall: Letting it ride as a somewhat bigger, somewhat bolder beer it was fine."
""
""
"A rough one. I'm finishing it because it's engrained in me that I have to. Drink something else, or like me, learn the hard way."
""
""
"Not bad, but Southern Tier has better beers out there. Their 2x IPA and 2x Stout are much better than this. Not to say this beer is terrible, but I was expecting greatness -- I guess I got my hopes up too high. This beer just lacks flavor, to be quite honest... it mostly tastes of sweetness with a trace of hops. Definitely worth trying at least once to form your own opinion."
""
""
""
""
"Interesting beer. Not my favorite style, but fun to try. A little too thick to drink on a hot day, probably a better springtime beer. Not going to get again, but glad I picked up a 6 to give a chance to."
""
""
""
"A very good and underrated beer in my opinion, a really enjoyable mouthfeel and great flavor, hides its strength well, easy to like, definitely will have this again."
"O: A hop focused beer with a fair amount of yeast character. A cool idea for a style that has been well executed."
""
""
"Great drinkability, nothing life changing but goes down easy"
""
""
"I love a good Steam Beer, but was concerned on how one would come out doubled. It actually is a little light color-wise for a steam beer. The aroma is sweet and malty, with a bit of hoppiness. The taste? Again, I've never had a double steam beer. For better or for worse, they nailed this. It does taste like a doubled version of Anchor's Steam. However, like the majority of double pilsners, it just comes off too sweet and boozy."
""
""
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, good kick, good representation of style, it’s a decent lager to drink for a while if you want something a bit different."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep amber with a copper hue. Perfect clarity. A vigorous pour produced 2 fingers of loose foam that fell amicably to a thin ring and skin on top. Excellent lacing. No real carbonation to be seen coming up from the bottom. Nose is lager yeast with a faint touch of sweet lemon. Herbal hops, light grass, sweet malt, corn and honey. There’s even a little mint, a touch of tobacco and some light toast. Taste is sweet but not heavy. Without much carbonation it’s very soft on the palate. Hops are bitter but a little shy. Herbal, minty, grainy, nutty and a little warmth from the alcohol. There’s a nice oily coating but no bitter bite that usually goes with that. The malt is sweet and full and there is just a touch of pine on the back palate. Body is thin and it drinks creamy. I’ve never had anything like it. Finishes dry and crisp. This a very supple beer that’s vivid and unique."
""
"The Rest: While it may not be apparent from my review, this is a really good beer. Big, bold flavors, not much hint of the alcohol hiding in there and great drinkabilty. A buddy brought over a six-pack for a Bar-B-Q, and we quite enjoyed these."
""
""
"Overall: I tried rating this to style as it is better than several beers I have had of this style. That said, of the 2X series it is probably my least favorite. It meets the style, but the extra alcohol really does not do much for me flavor wise. The rest is just an ok beer. I will pass in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a crystal clear deep golden color with a thinnish white head that dissipates almost instantly. The aroma is sweet with honey like malts, orange marmalade, and dark pitted fruits. Light bready pilsner malt shines through. The flavor is sweet and a bit woody with a firm earthy hop bitterness. There is a bit of alcohol presence in the flavor that I didn't find in the aroma. The flavor is not nearly as sweet as I thought from the aroma. Medium body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. I usually enjoy southern tier, but this one is not for me. Boring, too sweet with a bit too much alcohol presence."
""
""
""
""
"I like the 2X series, especially the stout and IPA, never had the 2XMAS ale...these beers are higher in the alcohol department but served in a more manageable size unlike their other high octane brews. Pours a crystal clear amber body with a cream colored head, kind of thin textured in appearance, fine speckled lacing patterns left behind as it settles. Aroma semi sweet nose, muted a bit served cold at first after warming not much more opens up. Flavor has the same raw earthy bitterness that the Steam beer from San Fran has, semi sweet bread mostly a subdued caramel sweetness with evident alcohol with a minimal light syrup texture. Drinks down way too easy especially for 8 percent abv it doesn't offend in anyway it's just a solid drinking beer about as refreshing as an Anchor, just with more malts shining through. Mouthfeel light residual sugars on the palate even carbonation light to medium bodied not cloying at all, alcohol is just barely evident. Overall, a beer that will get your non craft beer drinkers wasted, even though this beer is flavored toward a newbie into craft beer with somewhat of a lack of complexity they did what they wanted to do and stayed true to the originators of the style."
""
"Pours a clear dark straw color. Smells of grain and caramel, a bit sweet. Tastes of light sugary malts and alcohol. A bit metallic, leafy hops, fair amount of bitterness. Lighter medium bodied feel, graceful for the amount of alcohol. Has a filtered dryness and cleanness that makes it very palatable This is a good beer, a sneak attack for its mild character but its potent results."
""
""
""
""
""
"Big malt flavor up front with thick bread notes and some sweet caramel flavor. The taste is kept lively with good carbonation and a slight hop bitterness - floral and herb. A very tasty beer reminds me of an octoberfest without the roasted malt flavor."
""
"O - It's definitely an interesting beer and I'm glad I decided to pick one up. Not sure if I would ask for another one, however. I haven't had too many steam beers but in my novice opinion I'd rather stick to another one of the ST ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - not one of the better offerings at Southern Tier who makes some really great beers"
"Overall I see the label that 2 types of hops were used maybe they should have used another? Usually ST hits the ballpark with these 2X beers being balanced and hoppy but this one is metallic stingy and somewhat terrible..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Price Point - $1.49/12 oz single"
""
"I'd like to try more of this style, but it doesn't amaze me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not bad, this is a different take on a steam, but its the abundance of malt that makes this one not superb, but worth a try if you're looking for something different. Also, the 8% is masked well in taste, so its quite drinkable for its weight."
""
""
""
"This is certainly an interesting beer to me, I really haven't had that many like it. One thing I don't like is the residual sweetness, more than most beers for my palate. The bitterness and alcohol only seem to augment with warmth and each sip, bringing the beer more and more out of balance. A ton of interesting flavors but it just doesn't form a great end product due to alcohol and sweetness."
""
""
""
"I know this is a relatively simple style with hops being a major player, but this ""imperial"" version takes simplicity and mauls it. Perhaps this could be classified as a ""classy"" malt liquor, but this is not a great beer. Any newbies to the style, stick with Anchor Steam, the OG."
""
""
"Overall, I am not especially impressed. The flavor profile is perfectly executed for the stlye but I really don't care for the abundant sweetness. I'll just stick to the regular steam beer."
""
""
"A little hop bitterness makes this an enjoyable Steam Beer. Very easy drinking at 8.0%."
""
"O: I actually like this beer, find it balanced, and fairly refreshing. I wish it was 1x. Should I blend this with water? What the heck is wrong with 1x?"
""
""
"This was not a good beer for me. I had about 1/4 of the glass, then drain poured it."
"Overall a solid new beer, won't blow you away with flavor but is instead a balanced albeit malt forward brew. Works for coming out of winter and into summer."
""
""
""
""
"I want to read English Old Ale and Dopplebock into the flavor profile here, but neither of those are apt here. But the familiar and comfortable flavors remind me of Rogue's Dead Guy Ale and Double Dead Guy."
""
""
""
""
""
"Toasted bread notes up front. Herbal hop bitterness picks up right away. Honey wheat bread malt fills in; light sweetness. Toasted edge to everything and hints of cooked carrots. Woody, herbal bitterness carries to the finish. Lingering honeyish malt. Medium body with a slightly sticky feel. Slightly warming. Not bad, but feels like the amped up ingredients don't work as well together at these levels."
""
""
"This is a meat & potatoes kind of beer. It even has an Irish vibe to it. I definitely appreciate going outside the box in the California Common / Steam Beer category."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice honey golden color, with a quick burst of foam that goes away fairly quickly. Not overly carbonated, and it smells a bit like banana and graham cracker. Tastes like an Oktoberfest on steroids. Has a malty taste that is crisp and clean, that yields to a little bit of hop bite, which doesn't linger too long."
""
"While a fan of Southern Tier, not a fan of their ""2X everything and anything"" trend. An imperial steam beer is not something craft beer needed. All the subtle balance of Anchor Steam is lost here. There is nothing really wrong here, but not much right either. Pass on this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Boozy, but not too harsh. It's an interesting take on the style."
""
""
"Not sure what season they're aiming for with this one, but it's far too heavy for a summer brew. Sweetness is almost cloying, and hop flavor is somewhat one note. The bitterness has an odd, almost stale, soapy feel to it."
""
"Perfect! Except that it is too good."
""
""
"Palate is much the same with a moderate body and low carbonation. Low lying earthy bitterness balances the malt pretty nicely. Almost like a whole grain raisin swirl bread without any cinnamon or much sweetness. Earthy bitter grain with earthy bitter hops and overall clean flavor profile. Not very refreshing for the season but it is a pretty goo beer and does place your mind in some wild wild west saloon with will smith and those weird spider bots. Seems like the most refreshing thing that would've been available. That was off topic but overall a pretty nice beer with traits common to a steam beer and alcohol that is undetectable even at dead warm temperatures. A little drier than most steam beers with less fruitiness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Served on tap at Southern Tier Brewing and from a bottle."
""
""
"Single finger white head with nice lacing on a clear bright deep golden body. Musty pale malts, hint of wood, musty lemons and also some lemon custard sweetness. Flavor is fairly bitter but also has a tropical and lemon sweetness balancing it out. Sharp herbal hop finish. Medium body and moderate carbonation. I have only had a few steam beers. This one seems to be a little more boozy than any other u have had as I dictated by the 2X. Definitely worth trying."
