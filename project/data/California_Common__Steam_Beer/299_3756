4.1,12.9,4,4,4.25,4,4,"The beer pours a surprisingly vigorous head that is bubbly and foamy and white. The beer itself is a deep and dark  copper to a dark ruby. The beer is clear. The beer has a strong malty smell that has a bit of hops. The taste of the beer is similar to the small. The beer has a strong malty taste but the taste is.closer to a sweet taste aith ander taste of toast. Hops are there but they are minimal. Hoppy aftertaste.  The feel is medium bodied and smooth with a clean finish. Overall,  a pretty fantastic commons and worth it.","HattedClassic","Nov 12, 2013"

3.48,-4.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Pours a fully hazed amber brown. Nice white head. Nose is slight hops anda touch of wood. Flavor is smooth with a slight wood tone and somewhat firm hops. Feel is a bit thin on the liquid aspect, but it starts off pretty silky. Heavily drinkable at first. My first sip turned out to be a few seconds long and became a long swig. But as time went on, it seemed to lose its luster and I had a hard time finishing it. I had to force the latter bit down.","RblWthACoz","Dec 30, 2007"

3.73,2.8,3.5,3,4,4,4,"prominent pilsner malt flavor, with a Euro hop flavor. more lively, fruity flavors come from the brewevidence of higher fermentation temps (actually, sometimes big wafts of fruitiness meet my tongue (and my nose))","bruachan","Aug 02, 2007"
3.95,8.8,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,"sitting right @ the bar here, writing the review. about 100 ft. from home plate of Fenway. Anyway, this is on cask tonight. $4.50 a pint. Creamy head & mouthfeel. Amber color, little bit of hoppy smell and aftertaste. Set at room temp. but it's a bit hot for this tonight. Wish I could try other choices,","Backer2004","May 09, 2007"
3.32,-8.5,4,2,3.5,4,4,"Drinkability: easy to quaff and could be a session beer. Nothing to right home about, but this beer is one of those you drink and don't over-analyze it.","Gavage","Aug 01, 2006"
3.03,-16.5,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Poured an orange brown and was extremely hazy. Just a thin head which would form spotted lace around the glass. The nose was malts and lemon. The flavor was a bit disappointing. It was really sweet and I could not find the hops. The malts were very present and their sweetness was mellowed thanks to a nice woody background. The overall flavor of this beer is best described as iced tea. The mouthfeel was very watery. Shadowy body: At first is was pleasantly full, but it finished quite thin. The iced tea flavor detracted from the experience and did not leave me wanting a second beer.","MuddyFeet","Apr 28, 2005"
4.1,12.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Medium bodied, to the light side, its a very good session beer, it's not hard to drink a few of these.","mschofield","Mar 18, 2005"
4.12,13.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Hazy copper, the haze is probably from the semi excessive use of hops in many ways and the yeast flavours are at a minimum  so this cask has dropped properly. Nice creamy tiny bubbled sticky lace. Very aromatic of fruity esters, raw hops and bready malt. Real smooth with a good malt foundation, fruitiness perks with flavours of melon, pear and peach. Big wave of hops both in bitterness and flavour hit the palate and seems to linger for a while with the fruitiness trailing along. Certainly a bold and expressive cask ale.","Jason","May 23, 2002"
4.56,25.6,3,4.5,4.5,5,5,"A solid session beer. Its consistency is of water with flavour, making it dangerously easy to drink. Nice job on this cask ...","Todd","May 20, 2002"
