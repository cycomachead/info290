"ok, decent beer. It is light. Head and lacing ok. Color is nice. Flavor has a touch of citrus and malt. Kinda has a very light of hint of maybe a lemon muffin. Hope I am not stretching too far with that description. The finish has good carbonation and is clean and crisp. By no means am I comparing to a Michelob ultra, but this beer had somewhat of a similar clean, dry finish. I liked it !!"

"O: I think this could be in the running for my BMC replacement at a BBQ. Light enough, great feel. Just wonder if the dryness might build."
"T: Coarse grains, bread, toffee. Light floral hops, clean lemon pith bitterness dominates the finish."

"This leans heavily to the hop. Strong bitter (pine-like) bite. Surprising, given the balance of the nose. relatively easy to drink. Low to moderate body but highly carbonated. This resembles a bitter American pale ale."

"O- Like the taste, interesting and different."
"A pretty hoppy common and would do well in the summer for a refreshing drink."

"This is classified as a steam beer, but it sure doesn't taste like one. Either way, it's actually a real unique and great tasting brew."

"Unique blend of malt & hops give a up front hippy malt flavor with a spicey back end. Unfiltered WIT appearance with a malty spice aroma. Good hot weather beer. I really like Port City beers this one just happens to fall at the bottom of my list. Port City is a Great brewery Optimal Wit and Monumental IPA are my favorites."

"Thanks to Amyliz4 for grabbing this growler from the brewery. Served in a Port City pint glass. Beer is a pale yellow. Good head and lacing. Crackers in the nose. Faint hops. Toasty and a bit bready. Fairly dry finish. Medium body. Quite tasty and a very nice example of the style."
"Beer is medium in body and sweet on the front, a lager-ish yeastiness is present throughout. I drink all the steam beers I can get my hands on and this is one of the better ones. I'm glad I got to try it and it should be made again, just based on how well it turned out."

"The mouthfeel is a little heavy feeling for style with carbonation being moderate. Overall, it was a pretty decent beer all things considered. It was definitely worth saving the batch instead of dumping it, but I can't say I'd be making it a regular purchase though."

"My house mate and I bought this as a Sixtel for our newly built home keg-orator. Being that we Live in Northern VA and had experienced the Blackout first hand we were intrigued to try a local Brew that resulted from the power outage. It's hazy appearance is not unlike a hefeweizzen but it drinks like a Pils. It holds a good head and it is very light on the pallet, leaving behind little more than light citrus and bitter hops. As a ""last-ditch effort"" I say its decent, if it could be improved I would buy this again."

"The beer is fairly hazy and appears golden orange hued. Small white head. The aroma brings citrus, malt, dank hops, resin. Smells nice. The flavor follows suit, with a grapefruit rind and malt presence. Light bodied and easily drinkable. I would definitely drink this again. A solid example of the style."
