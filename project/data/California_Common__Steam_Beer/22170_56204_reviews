"O: Pretty easy drinking with good woodsy hop flavor and supporting malt. Nice balance."
""
"Pretty good overall."
"D - Not a big light lager drinker, but I like this one."
"Short and sweet. And good. That's enough, don't you think?"

"I'm just going to enjoy it."
"Very drinkable; the solid mouthfeel and relatively light (but not bland) flavor make this a good session candidate."
"Taste is mostly citrus (bitter lemon with at most a faint hint of grapefruit, which is strong in the aroma), plus some pine and peppery leaf. It has light toasty malt sweetness underneath the somewhat sharp, vaguely leafy-peppery-citrus-rind bitterness that dominates fully from start to finish, but not aggressively. It is good, but the bitterness is just too sharp and lingering enough to throw off the balance and reduce drinkaiblity."
"Toasty, bready, or even donuty, mildly carbonated, with a nice hoppiness. In contrast to the soft, cloudy, strawberry blond / grapefruit color, the foam is hilariously, giant and bright white. A fun blend of organic malt, hops and yeast, it can be complex if you want it to be, but never in a way that interferes with your ability to enjoy your food or company. It's more robust compared to a steam beer / California common like Anchor Steam. My favorite part of this beer is the wonderful fresh-baked bread smell. Or maybe it's the hops! It has a pleasant bitterness to it and a really great sweet grassy finish that's short, but bold. Cali Common would be a great dinner beer for hearty vegetable dishes, pastas, beans, or big salads with whole grains."
"22 oz bottle from Whole Foods, Berkeley. Bottle says it's brewed by Linden Street in Oakland. Pours with a huge rocky white head. Straw in color with some haze. Nobel hop bitterness in the nose, with clean, light malt too. Lots of Noble hop character, plenty of drying bitterness, and some underlying doughy, honey-sweet malt. Fairly robust for a light lager. A nice drinking beer, would hit the spot on a hot day or a camping trip."
"Bottle, home. This beer pours a bright tangerine orange with a big, puffy white head. It's a nice looking beer, leaving lots of lacing. Also, the label is well designed and professional, a solid look for the new company. The aroma has a lot of noble hops and possibly a bit of West Coast grapefruit rind flavor, but I'm terrible at guessing ingredients. There's a nice doughy yeast note in there, too. The flavor has a good bitterness of the noble hop variety. It's nice and dry. This is an easy drinking beer and would be nice for a session. The mouthfeel is relatively full and has a touch of hop oil. A pleasant lager that would pair well with a variety of meals."
