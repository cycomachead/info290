"Pours a clear orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and biscuit aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and caramel flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable but nothing really stands out about it."

"Overall - I'm normally a big fan of amber ales but in this instance, I'm not excited about it. This is their flagship beer, the one that everyone in the area knows about. I am no more than 10 minutes from this brewery and have yet to go to it. I am hoping that this is a bad batch and not the standard. I really want to give this another try directly from the brewery, hopefully it will be different."

"Pours a golden color with a white head. Strong yeast aroma with some bready malt and a pronounced graininess. A little bit of grass and floral hop aroma. The flavor is sort of bland. It’s just sort of sweet with a little bit of malt flavor. It’s mostly just grainy and bland."

"O - Overall, a very average beer. A slightly sweet, fairly light beer that is easily drinkable but won't set the world on fire with what it does, which is nothing exceptional, but not I wouldn't classify it as a bad beer either."
"All in all, this sucks. No worries about this one. I am starting to think that this brewery wants to be Budweiser. No flavors, just water."
"Drink- 2nd time ive had this beer. 1st time on draft. Wasn't too bad, wasn't too good. Just a nice run of the mill beer."
"and tradition of Cal. Common. We all know the benchmark"
"The beer pours a light amber color with a white head. The aroma is toffee and earthy hops. The flavor is toffee, earth and some citrus hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Nothing special here, but nothing too offensive either."
"Pours a one finger white head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Almost clear amber color. Nose has hints of light piney hops. Flavor is mildly hoppy, indistinct. Dry piney finish. $4.49 for a 22oz bottle from Liquorama Upland, CA."
"An uneventful drink. No reason to try again."
"I'm cleansing my palate and my memory of this beer with a Rip Roaring Red."
"D- Would have enjoyed just a touch more hops in this, didn't find them anywhere. Kinda felt unbalanced towards adjuncts like a macro lager or something with caramel malt added."
"Not that great, this is almost a drain pour for me, would market better as a British Pale Ale."
"Maybe I'm just too sensitive to diacetyl, but in this beer it adversely affects the smell, taste, and mouthfeel. I only made it through half the bottle, and that still felt like several sips too many. If I saw it on tap somewhere I'd probably try to talk the bartender into giving me a sample, just to compare it to the bottle. But if I had to make a decision based on this bottle, I wouldn't try it again, nor could I recommend it."
"Not too bad, though its loose ends could be tightened."
