Sweet malts up-front on the nose with caramel, cherries, and not much else detected. Very light aroma. Taste is clean and refreshing. Malty, with a hint of damp basement in-mouth and a dryish finish. Sweet tea, wood, chocolate caramel, and a touch if sediment round out the flavors. The mouthfeel is pretty unobtrusive, with a clean finish and polished overall feel. Overall it's a nice lager, but lacks a distinctive trait to help it stand out.","TangTKE402","Aug 22, 2014"

3.78,6.2,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Poured from a can into a shaker pint, the beer is a crystal-clear, copper coloring, with a steady flow of carbonation, and a bubbly, fluffy, clingy, off-white head. Nose of toasted grains, subtle toffee sweetness, and roasted notes throughout. Flavors are roasted caramel sweetness forward, with an underlying hops bitterness and roasted character. Richly sweet throughout, on a slick, mid-body. The aftertaste is roasted, as well, with a sweet caramel characteristic, and some nutty notes mixed in. Clean, smooth finish. More body than what I would expect from the style, but damn tasty and drinkable.","GarthDanielson","Jul 13, 2014"

Still a nice crisp enjoyable summer lager.","jlindros","Jul 07, 2014"

3.45,-3.1,4,3.25,3.5,3.75,3.25,"The beer pours a creamy, very light amber/rich golden color with a silky, off-white head of medium-sized bubbles. In body, the beer is clean and translucent, with just a slight haze from the beer’s rich coloring. Bubbles are a constant fixture within the beer, and punch towards the surface with quite a lot of tenacity, keeping the head rocky at about a fourth of a finger’s width. The head leaves some nice fluffy lacing as it moves down the glass. On the nose, the beer smells of caramel, cream corn, slight cider, herbal hops, and a finish of sweet bread. The cream corn is a little strong in the nose, but not off-putting. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet with a bitter back finish that balances out the beer. There is a little earthiness in the beer, adding slight complexity, but really this is a simple sweet and bitter beer. In flavor, it tastes of cream corn, crackers, soft caramel, and very faint watermelon. These flavors slide into a finish of herbal and grassy bitter hops that blend and mellow the sweetness, leaving a slight metallic twinge on the finish and aftertaste. Again, the DMS seems a little high in the initial sip, though it’s nicely drinkable and inoffensive. As you drink more of the beer, the bitters tend to grow and provide a nice bite that covers up much of the cream corn character. In the mouth, the beer feels light bodied with just a little gelling. The carbonation is fluffy and full, and the mouthfeel is silky (nearly syrupy) with a nice little crispness on the finish. After the beer leaves, the mouth is left slightly wet, but fairly neutral, making it perfect for another sip. From the can I detect little to know change in the drinking experience, aside from the slight metallic bite, which is actually quite pleasant in this particular beer. Overall, the beer is refreshing and simple. The DMS is a little high, but still manageable, and the flavors are all inoffensive. I’d place this a step above the Adjunct Lagers. It’s easy to drink, refreshing, and mild in flavor. Not a bad beer, but not amazing either. A nice, simple (almost) session lager.","Maxwell","Beers"

Aroma was pure Steam beer, the minty, woody Northern Brewer hops were easily picked up was the nice biscuit like malt backbone. The taste was a home run, a nice fruity malt flavor from fermenting at ale temps with just enough of the hops coming through to balance the beer perfectly. Overall, in my opinion, this gives Anchor Steam a run for it's money. This will be a staple in my beer fridge!","jdauria","Apr 24, 2014"
