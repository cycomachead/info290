"Surprising...very hoppy but balanced. I really liked this, but it had a strangely metallic aftertaste that I couldn't account for..."

"overall, a rather flavourful brew imbedded within a unique style. sublimely balanced and nuanced. i'd like to sample this on tap."

"Overall; definitely a nice spring beer that has a lively taste and a surprising hoppy note."
" The flavor starts peppery and herbal from the hops which bring out a sort of earthy complimentary malt element with lager-like yeast flavors bringin some mineral elements along with toastiness in the malt and a light almond-like nutty sweetness with a subtle caramel or vienna flavor which compliments the yeast and adds a bit of depth. Overall I would not say this is the best example of the style, but it is better than average in most regards including drinkability...I would try this on draft."

"The rich roasted caramel malts play up a bit more in the taste and the bitterness is must by it finishes clean and balanced. Not sure how often I would have this. Not a ""go out of my way to get it"" kind of beer."
""
"Overall OK, but nothing too special, it has the nice soft feel, soft minerals, that iced tea is really different, and the candy notes are also off for a steam beer, but an interesting twist on it. I wouldn't say I didn't enjoy this a bit, it was a pretty good beer, just not what I expected."

"Overall for 3.25 a pint, I don't feel let down, but I will not be trying this beer again unless it is in a bottle and it is free."

"Overall- Above average beer that has glimmers of being good. Worth a try, especially if you want another example of the style."
"This beer is a complete bore. Tastes like something one would find in a case of Kirkland generic beer from Costco. I can't believe this sells for the same price as Deschutes offerings in the supermarket. Widmer was on my no no list for years... they just hit the reset button."

"Translucent orange with a large head, excellent retention. Aroma is fruity, grapefruit & orange hops with some floral notes. Very crisp beer with strong fruitiness, some grassy notes, honey-like sweetness but finishes very dry. Strong carbonation, but not so strong that it interferes with drinkability. Fantastic session ale, it'd be nice to see more stuff like this on the shelves."

"O- I liked this one a lot. Not dominated by any single characteristic but the herbal hops are balanced well by everything else going on. Seems to have held up even greater than 4 months after bottling."

"A quick drinker. Wish this was a little fresher, seems to have faded a bit. Dull components make for an unmemorable beer but some bitterness keeps it alive. An average cream ale that doesn’t stand out in it’s class."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid sessionable beer to drink for a while."
"Pours to a thin white head, minimal lace and copper color. Aroma is malty, sweet and spicy hops. Flavor is biscuity malt and spicy hops and balancing bitterness. Mouthfeel is light and CO2 is appropriate to style. Overall, this is a good tasting beer."
""
"Nice job on a Cali Common brew."
"Pours a dark copper with tanish head that foams up pretty good with a hard pour. Head sticks around in a thin film, lacing sticks to the glass ok. Smells like bread, fruity mango or peach maybe no hops really. The taste very much a bread craker taste, not really tasting the fruit I smell. There are no hops just a slight bitterness and not to sweet. Mouthfeel is medium, it has body just not really flavor to match. Overall I would drink this anytime and could problay drink a ton, its easy to drink and has more flavor then ur standard beer i guess."

"I went with a fairly aggro pour which resulted in a surprisingly brief finger of light-tan head with relatively low retention. It is a cool day and there is little to no humidity and the lack of head retention was surprising. Color was a deep-copper with NE-quality clarity and if there was a way to cash it in at my local recycling center, I would be on my way there now. I had a babe of a g/f in the early 1990's and her hair was both copper-colored and coarse as wire. I wonder if she braids it up and sells it as scrap? Man, what a beauty! Both the g/f and the beer. Nose was solidly malty with a slightly minty/grassy scent underneath. I was vaguely reminded of Girl Scout mint cookies. Taste was semi-sweet and quite tasty. It occurred to me, in writing this review, that I have never reviewed Anchor Steam, despite it being one of the first micros I ever put up to my lips, I wonder how the two will compare. This was worthwhile."
"Cheers!"

"Pours a clear honey orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, biscuit, grain, and grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a distinct grass forward aroma and flavor."

"If you like the style, you'll like this. I think it's ok."
"I was expecting almost a Pilsner style color, but this was much darker than a Pilsner. Not a heavy hop smell - very bready and almost lager-ish. Taste was very similar, not quite a smooth, dark, winter ale but also not quite a light, summer ale. Essentially a beer to have around year-round, I think. Very nice taste and mouthfeel. Again, very lager-ish, but extremely pleasant and enjoyable. I very much enjoy this beer."

"O: A style that I do not come across very often but I do enjoy trying when I get the chance - a little dryer than I would have expected for the style but enjoyable and sessionable."
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall – While not a flavorful powerhouse, it does have a nice easy drinking and refreshing taste with just enough complexity to not be boring, but not too much too take away from its more session like (at 4.7 % abv) and easy drinking qualities."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Nice take on the style, though I'm not big on the style to begin with. Much like the Ninkasi Spring Reign I had last night, this does well as a spring seasonal release. Easy drinker. Downright sessionable."
""
"This style isn't quite as common as the name would suggest... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunset bronze topped by a short finger of off-cream foam. The nose comprises flowers, light wheat, a touch of funky wheat, and a light dusting of powdered sugar. The taste holds notes of mild biscuit, greens, light grass, flowers, and a twinge of nougat (yeah, I'm not sure where that came from, either). The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a pretty nice little steam beer, something I could see seasonal drinkers really digging in the sunshiny months."
""
"Taste is very palate-pleasing, with a light body but full of flavor. I get enough citrus hops and bready malts to be an ideal balance for a session-style spring lager. Very enjoyable and well-done!"
""
""
"O: This beer may not appeal to mainstream beer drinkers, but it's very good considering the style. I really enjoyed the aromas and flavors imparted by the Columbus hops and the dryness."
""
""
""
"O - This is a good steam beer, maybe even better than the original."
""
""
"Poured a clearish brown body with decent head and lace on top of a slightly fruity but more piney, earthy hop aroma. Beer isn't bad but I just found it bland (boring) and a little toned down for the masses. There is a good hop presence but it's more of just some minor earthy, piney hops that have a little citric to them and help give off an easy, crisp and dry finish. Not much else going on as some fruit and sweet notes are muted and the beer isn't watery but definitely a thinner body helps you pound it."

"Pretty tasty, not fantastic but once you get past the lack of a head it's not a bad beer."
"All in all, this was a pleasant surprise for me."
"O: I bought a six pack of this. The first one I didn't like so much. I had another a few weeks later and it really is starting to work for me. At first I thought there wasn't enough hop to balance out the flavor but I changed my mind. Though not ad hoppy as some of my more usual beers, it is actually quite balanced. It would make a good session beer. It's a tasty beer but its missing something to really make it pop."

"Overall a nice beer, and very timely for the coming of spring."

"a style of beer id like to see come around a little more, this is a great spring seasonal with all the necessary attributes. it pours an amber to copper color, clean and neat, with an inch of lasting white head. the nose is pretty well hopped, a little citrusy, with a fairly big malt profile for such a light and crisp beer. there isn't rye in this, but is has a certain spice element to the smell as well. the flavor is really well balanced. plenty of grain happening, some caramel sweetness, a little tannic thing going on, and a good size body. the hops are exclusively in the finish, hardly bitter at all, but of a neutral fruity feel to them, good compliment to the bigger malt flavors. the finish is super crisp and refreshing, and this is an easy beer to drink quite a few of. I like it in early spring here because its got the clean satisfying drinkability and summery hop complexion, but it also has enough body to be useful when its still cold out. a well made example of a style that I am finding I really enjoy."

"It's been a while since I've had a steam beer. Columbia Common is a beautiful beer, it pours out a brilliant copper color capped with a lovely head. The aroma is a little weak and what's there of the toasted malts is a bit. It ticks the flavor marks just right though, with that whole ""not a lager, not yet an ale"" thing going on, with a wonderful slight malty nuttiness. A bit of hops hang out with a grainy finish. The mouthfeel is on the heavier side of light and highly carbonated, and the drinkability is solid. A solid attempt at a under-brewed style."
"This started a little shakey, but improved as it warmed. Very drinkable, would love to get some fresher just to see if it is any better"
""
""
"Overall a surprisingly tasty beer. Wasn't expecting much here but this is an excellent mild ale."
""
"Overall, this is a light and quaffable brew of no real distinction, but I'm always willing to try a lower-alcohol beer from a reputable brewery. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Sprout's Market in San Diego. I've got five more bottles from the sixer, so this will probably end up at DIPA Helper."
"This is a disappointing beer. The nose offers very little. The flavor follows. There isn't much here. It's a simple, subtle flavor profile. The mouthfeel is also a bit thin. This just isn't for me. I need something a little more bold and flavorful."
"the color is reall nice...brown with maybe a very slight redish hue. there is a slight hoppiness in the nose- not strong at all. the taste is similar- a weak hoppiness and a watery finish. the mouth feel is pretty good and it seems pretty drinkable. i could drink a few and watch a game, not heavy at all."
""
""
""
"A flavorful but still light ale."
""
"Overall: while this beer seems a little rough around the edges, it's actually not a bad example of the style. This beer is worth a try if you are into the style and want to expand beyond Anchor Steam Beer."
"O: While this beer won't win any points for originality or complexity, it is refreshing and easy to like. Drinkable."

"An enjoyable steam beer, well suited for spring and easy drinking."
"O- Above average. Cool and refreshing with a nice spring hop taste to it."
"Very sessionable beer, but nothing outstanding."
