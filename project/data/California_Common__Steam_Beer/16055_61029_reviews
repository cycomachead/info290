"Overall- no a bad beer at all, I have never seen this before so I am assuming it is a hard beer to find in the southeastern US."

"Overall it grows on you a whole lot. Somehow warmth does this beer a huge favor while it continues to be just as refreshing and pronounced as ever. I know warmth in a summer beer may go against the refreshing idea... but I felt like when it sat and warmed up it really became amazingly enjoyable. Kind of felt this was more of a saison of sorts crossed with a pils... I don't know. It's very good and very well achieved. The amount of flavor and potency that is in this beer for such a low ABV is astounding."

"This is a super foamy beer that pours a light tan-amber color. It smells grassy. Like a just-mowed lawn, even. There’s a big bouquet of grassy, spicy, piney hops. Nothing at all like the blonde ales I’ve come to expect. It’s full-flavored, with grassy hops, and a slight taste of Alka-Seltzer that came through as I sipped. Curiously so, in fact. It wasn’t off-putting but not necessarily something I’d want either. Finishes nicely with a touch of sweetness and enough effervescence to keep it light."

"A decent beer and as I said, it's full of flavor and not alcohol."
"Pretty good beer even tho I accidently left it exposed to the sun for a short time each day for about 2 weeks. And it doesn't remind me so much of a steam beer so much as perhaps a farmhouse. Poured with a nice, foamy, frothy, thick, creamy, off white head and lots of lace. Color is a medium light amber. Aroma is big on yeast, then bitter citrus, malt. Flavor is much like nose, not overly sweet, some barnyard, finishing off with a taunt of banana, but is dominated by yeast. Body is very good and excellent carbonation. Finish is like flavor and is still dominated by yeast. For that, I don't make it a session. Interesting to try and enjoyable this time, but that's about it."
"D: Incredibly easy drinking, that's for sure. I like the aggressive hops considering the style. Light, refreshing. Give it a shot"
"For what is and is trying to be, this is a very nice beer."
