"Anchor brings forth another winner."

"I'm just not vibin' with it..."
"The feel is medium bodied and really has a great smoothness that goes down very easy. A really great drinker that has a great flavor profile. This beer brought the flavor and really left the bitterness behind."
"Interesting complexity: This one starts off with a malt base that succumbs to the aforementioned hop bitterness.  But I also detect a bit of fruity sweetness in the swallow, yet the aftertaste is bitter and long lasting.  Leans to the full body side, good carbonation.  Easy to drink."

"Enjoyable."

"Can. Label art is very legit. Beer pours darker than expected. Clear Amber color with a big, fluffed head. Rings of lacing. Has that ""common beer"" aroma. The dry hops don't really stand out in the nose all too much. Common beer yeast, which I find to be very distinctive...probably Anchor's house yeast. Sweet bready malt. Very estery/fruity. Flavor is malt and yeast dominant. Fruity esters, Anchor yeast lagerishness....yes lagerishness. Bread and caramel malt. Soft floral hop.  Finish really cleans up with a lingering apple flavor. Stimulating carbonation. Not exactly what I was expecting. More hop, less sweet next time. Reminds me of a Maibock."

"Clear gold under a foamy head that fills up the glass.  Toasted, biscuit-like malts, honey, and just a little apple, melon, and strawberry fruitiness in the aroma.  Flavors of bready grain, grassy bitterness, floral hops, and earthy citrus.  Clean and crisp, easy to drink.  Similar character to other Anchor beers.  Not much of the expected Citra and Nelson qualities."

"It's good. Not as good as their lager"
"Something is a bit off. Bittering is too overwhelming for my palate, as well."
""
"The Citra and Nelson don't necessarily stand out. This is still a Steam Beer at heart with some additional hop nuances. However it's still a huge improvement over the original."
""
"Citra and Nelson Sauvin combine VERY well, citrus, minty goodness in a liquid gold frame. A fabulous brew!"

"I wonder why Anchor Steam limits this beer to cans only?!"
""
"Serving type: on tap."
