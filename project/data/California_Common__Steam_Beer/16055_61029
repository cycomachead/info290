I know warmth in a summer beer may go against the refreshing idea... but I felt like when it sat and warmed up it really became amazingly enjoyable. Kind of felt this was more of a saison of sorts crossed with a pils... I don't know. It's very good and very well achieved. The amount of flavor and potency that is in this beer for such a low ABV is astounding.","Misanthropy_Sipping","Aug 18, 2012"

3.8,-0.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"This is a super foamy beer that pours a light tan-amber color. It smells grassy. Like a just-mowed lawn, even. There’s a big bouquet of grassy, spicy, piney hops. Nothing at all like the blonde ales I’ve come to expect. It’s full-flavored, with grassy hops, and a slight taste of Alka-Seltzer that came through as I sipped. Curiously so, in fact. It wasn’t off-putting but not necessarily something I’d want either. Finishes nicely with a touch of sweetness and enough effervescence to keep it light.","elNopalero","Nov 20, 2011"

4.08,7.1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Pretty good beer even tho I accidently left it exposed to the sun for a short time each day for about 2 weeks. And it doesn't remind me so much of a steam beer so much as perhaps a farmhouse. Poured with a nice, foamy, frothy, thick, creamy, off white head and lots of lace. Color is a medium light amber. Aroma is big on yeast, then bitter citrus, malt. Flavor is much like nose, not overly sweet, some barnyard, finishing off with a taunt of banana, but is dominated by yeast. Body is very good and excellent carbonation. Finish is like flavor and is still dominated by yeast. For that, I don't make it a session. Interesting to try and enjoyable this time, but that's about it.","drpimento","Aug 14, 2010"
