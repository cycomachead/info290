4.06,10.3,3,4.5,4,4,4,"Copper colored brew, decent sized cream colored head. Kind of surprisingly the hops dominate the nose, bitter variety. Nice sweet malts too. Same kind of thing for the taste, hoppy to the point of being somewhat surprising. I've only had a couple to a handful of this kind of style, so im not sure if it has a "normal" profile or not. Really the only steam that i am really familiar with is of course anchor's, and this seems to be a bigger beer than that. Most malts and for sure more hops. Medium bodied, somewhat creamy mouth. Tastey brew, I've been hearing murmurs about this flat earth and will for sure dive deeper into their line.","Tballz420","Jun 16, 2010"

Crisp hops with a bit of graininess as well. Feel is fine, maybe a tad thin, but nothing crazy. Very drinkable. This is one is in the top two for me as far as offerings from Flat Earth. Several of their other beers I have come away with less than impressed. Nothing outrageous here, just a solid sessionable hopped up beer.","jera1350","Aug 19, 2009"

The color was light amber with a light white head. Sweet and malty nose. Sweet attack with some late presenting hops that acted more complementary in the draft than as the centerpiece in the bottle. There are some fruit notes in the flavor that seem almost like mild berry flavors. As I have said, much less hoppy than what I remember the bottled variety being.","Ragingbull","Aug 14, 2009"

3.78,2.7,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"This is actually pretty nice; at first I didn't like how jarring the transition between the smooth, chewy malt notes in the middle and the harsher hop notes in the finish, but after a few sips it begins to get a bit more integrated and balanced (though the hop character is a bit more harsh than I might prefer). This definitely seems to be an under-appreciated beer though, but I suspect that the breweries consistency issues have to do with much of the problem; I am just glad that I got a stable / fresh bottle.","Gueuzedude","Mar 27, 2009"

3.58,-2.7,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"A nice steam beer (I refuse to call it California Common). Aroma was so so. There's a spiciness to it that I wasn't expecting. Pour was a beautiful clear amber with a puffy one finger near tan head. Clear and crisp. Taste was good but odd. There is a strong astringent bitterness to it that I don't associate with steam beer. The hops create a resinous film on the throat that don't let any malt through. Not bad.","HomebrewPgh","Oct 06, 2008"
4.31,17.1,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,5,"Pours a handsome copper color, with a monstrous, almost unruly beige head that really hangs in there for a long time, and leaves clumpy & sticky lacing all over the glass. Nice floral hop aroma, some grainy/beery aromas, some slight citrus/tangerine notes. Really nice flavors here, bright, citrusy, some bitter grassy flavors, some slightly sweet malty flavors. Clean, crisp, really nice/active carbonation....this is the very definition of session beer.

The first sip brings an unexpectedly perfect impression of Anchor Steam, but maybe better...very soft, creamy mouthfeel, broad fruitiness that gives a feeling of sweetness but isnt really sweet...dry roasted bittreness in the finish.

3.14,-14.7,4.5,3,3,3.5,3,"I picked this bomber up for $5.99 at the Andersons store in Dublin OH. I thought it might be a German Helles lager (a style I crave always) but it turns out I was wrong, it's a steam beer clone (a style I'm not crazy for). The beer is light copper colored and clear, with a really thick wet foam. The smell is nothing special in my opinion, just biscuity malt and a hops bitterness without the good hops aromatics. The taste is sort of bland as well, well balanced but with a lingering hops bite which isn't pleasant. No flavors that really make it for me. The body's just about medium, which is just about right for the style I suppose, and drinkability is OK except for the bitter aftertaste. Not badly made but not really my choice for a summer day.","TurdFurgison","Jul 25, 2008"
3.64,-1.1,4.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"22 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a clear copper color with a half-inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing is very good. The aroma is very light (but nice), it smells like some toasted malt and herbal/grassy hops. Luckily the taste is stronger than the aroma. It tastes like sweet and toasted malt, along with the herbal and grassy hops. Starts off sweet, and has a bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with low carbonation. It's also a bit creamy and coating. Drinkability is decent, it's smooth and not hard to drink at all. I think this is a solid beer, I'd buy it again.","bluejacket74","Jul 07, 2008"

Turned out to be a solid find, and I'll definitely check out Flat Earth again if I'm in the area. Appearance was a nice orangy amber color with a slightly weak head. Nose was nice, lots of fruit aromas along with some smoky malt. Taste was likewise, not super complex but tasty with the smokiness and the spicy hops and fruit.

Even though this has its complexities, I needed a bit more out of it other then the yeasty play that seems to be the main attirbute of the Flat Earth line thus far. Enough with the yeast alreay, give me some more malt and hops please. But, be that as it may, its a pretty solid brew that is fairly enjoyable for its bomber worth.

Fruits come at you with pear pulp, apple skin and concord grapes. Yeast adds a little doughy dimension to the nose. This flavor profile is quite interesting. It's got the appropriate clean malt flavors. But also some pizazz. This is coming from the spicy hops and estery yeastiness. It's a great touch to this beer. Honeyed malts form a nice base. Pepper notes accent nicely as well. The beer could use a little more carbonation. It's not flat, but is on that side of the spectrum. Body is about medium or so.

It pours a clear light amber-brown, with a small white head that fades quickly. There is a pleasant malty smell. Now, the taste is of a biscuity maltiness, with a slight brown sugar sweetness, finishing with a hint of hop goodness on the tip of the tongue. Initially, the hop flavor was much more pronounced, to the detriment of the other more delicate flavors. The only other beer of this style that I've tried(Anchor)is not particularly hoppy either. The mouthfeel is nice and full and it goes down easily. This is a nice version of a(for the Twin Cities)rarely brewed style.","edbeered","Jun 11, 2007"

The first thing I smell is HOPS. A good sign so far. My first taste leads to a surprising thicker mouthfeel considering the color and lager style. The malt profile is bready and sweet but not heavy and balances out nicely with the assertive hops. Interesting hop flavors of pine, grapfruit, and citrus. This beer is complex as I can clearly pick out the smoothness of lager and the malty ale characteristics. It's a beer that will make you say hmmmm. Good to see a California common fresh from MN that delivers.

4.1,11.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I had the pleasure of trying this beer on two occasions over the past few days and am glad to see yet another nice offering from Flat Earth. The beer pours a translucent copper color with a small, foamy white head. The aroma is slightly sweet with a complex hop aroma that runs the range from citrusy to grassy and floral. The flavor is crisp and malty with a pronounced hop glavor and bite. Great balance. The lager-like properties really shine in the flavor and mouthfeel. Drinkability? Surely I could sit down and have a few and enjoy the hell out of 'em. Good beer. Nice to see this style at a local brewery.","bucko","Beers"
