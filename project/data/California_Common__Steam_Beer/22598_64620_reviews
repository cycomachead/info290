"o: its a sweet and rich beer that has just enough bitterness to cut it. a good beer to drink and enjoy without having to think too much"

"Nice enough flavours, could definitely drink all night. But just doesn't interest me that much."

"I found this beer to be exceptionally lacking in style or imagination. It's not even particularly well crafted for what it is. I'd say that it feels by-the-numbers, but I think it even falls short of that. I was pretty unimpressed."

"O- balanced and smooth- great if you aren't sure whether you want a pale ale or sweet lager"

"Overall this is a definite favorite of the style. I have had this before and will probably have it again."

"The feel is bright, fluffy and creamy. This is a very light-bodied brew, though by no means thin. It's got enough of a crisp edge and smooth flow to keep it from being boring."

"Pours a clear, slightly hazy vivid copper gold. Nice foamy white head. Smells very good - crisp citrus hops, grain, and lager yeast. Tastes very refreshing, clean and fresh - citrus hops and lager. The body is light and fits well with the other components. Active carbonation that doesn't get in the way. A nice surprise extra in a trade. Paired well with a steak teriyaki dinner."

"This pours with a toasted straw-tan color with nice creamy foam and a lingering hint of tartness on the nose. It has an almost biscuity-tart flavor which makes it much more interesting than your typical California common or steam beer, at least in my experience. Thereâ€™s a lightly lemony hop aroma with some sweetish biscuit notes on the flavor. The Citizen reminded me in some aspects of the tartness from a Berliner weiss beer, combined with a lighter Anchor Steam."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice California common with a good malt and hop balance."
"HOWEVER(!), the girl running bartender at this establishment was FAR MORE FLAVORFUL than the brew. blonde, beautiful, (bountiful!), and with a smile on her face. what a treat. almost any beer is certain to be delectable in her presence!"

"This is the Cismontane that I hoped for from the time I first tasted them. Its copper color and good head retention leave a good first impression on The Citizen. Sourbdough bread and a floral note in the nose. Good tasting stuff, sourdough at first, softer notes of pine, floral, and citrus. Medium bodied and easy to drink. The California Common is anything but common to find, so it's great to see Cismontane doing a style other brewers shy away from."
"I recently had this on tap at the Tam O' Shanter in Los Feliz, LA, CA. It all started with the ""jackpot ringer", ok, the handle. A tree branch with a metal plate on it? We are off to a great start!!! I tasted it and thought it sublime. It was nice and strong, smooth, had plenty of alcohol and over the course of the several that followed, just got better and better. This is not true for every beer. Some you might not be able to drink all night and enjoy as much as your first. This was not the case with this beer, it paired as perfectly at the bar with conversation as it did with beef sliders! Fantastic! I contacted the brewery to find out where to buy it, they suggested Whole Foods might have some left. One bottle indeed, all mine! Can't wait to try it!!"
"Drink- It was just okay. The style isnt my favorite and if you barrel age it, I want the chardonnay notes to really shine through. Just a bit lacking to me."

"Pours a murky honey orange with a 1/2 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt/grain and some grassy aromas. Taste is of malt/grain flavors up front with an herbal and grassy hop finish. There is a medium amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, it's always good to try another beer of this particular style and this one is pretty good but nothing all that special."
""
"While I'm no expert on this style, it is classically true to the style. This is actually a really nice effort."

""
"O: This is like Anchor Steam on steriods, but really it's nowhere near Anchor Steam, it doesn't use Anchor Steam as a template. This is a lager that takes its influence from modern CA brewing, it's not looking to the past. Well made and quite tasty."
""
"If I didn't know this was supposed to be a California Common, I'd have sworn it was some kind of Belgian-style pale ale. The Citizen could stand to have the fruit character and the sweetness dialed back a bit. I'm glad I got the chance to try it, but this one is not a version of the style I would rush to try again."
"D: A beer of substance that represents a style characterized by balance, this new offering from Cismontane may be their best production beer yet. Its English sensory qualities are no surprise coming from this brewery, making for a versatile, easy-drinking beer that equates well to a pale ale."
