"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of pale malt, sweet malt, hint of wheat, hint of hop, and hint of yeast. Fits the style of a California Common / Steam Beer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight yeast, slight wheat, pale malt, hint of sweet malt, hint of hop, and slight adjunct. Overall, weak appearance, decent aroma, feel, and body."
