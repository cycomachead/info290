"My local priced this stuff down to make room on the shelf for other things, so I finally pounced on it. It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises barley, wild rice, grass, and a touch of sweet vinyl. The taste holds note of wild rice, vinyl, sharp grass, flowers, and Indian corn. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, this stuff just didn't jive with my tastebuds. Straight up."

"Overall not bad, other than the obvious big infection on the nose, but somehow not affecting the taste really, just the slightest touch on the finish. Fairly decent taste, adn could have been a better nose, but not too bad."

"22 ounce bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Loud crack upon opening, probably infected. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that last. Dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a ton of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lightly tart lemon zest, green apple, pear, cracker, bread, light honey, hay, straw, grass, herbal, light pepper, funk, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with balanced malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, green apple, pear, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, straw, floral, grass, pepper, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of green apple, pear, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, straw, grass, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of malt and fruity yeast flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming present after the finish. Overall, despite obvious infection, this was a nicely enjoyable brew. Obviously not to style, but was tasty for what was there. Very smooth and crisp to drink as well."

"Poured a honey gold with a good head of foam from a vigorous pour that fell to some crags and really great lace. Nose is fruity hops, a little sour, a little skunk. Malt is caramel and grain. Good lager nose but starts to fall apart as it warms. The hops go grassy and catty and the spice character which is very faint goes sour in the nose. Malt gets breaddier but like sourdough. Taste is breaddy malt with a try at some sweet citrus in back. It puckers from bitter fruit because the lemon got pithy. Husky, grainy malt this is no girlie beer. Finished dry with plenty of full bodied malt. Drank ok but not great because of hops going sour and a taste of corn on the back palate. It was mildly astringent and even a little metallic. Can live without this one."

"Worth a try. I've just never been able to get into this style but I review anyway."

"$7.00 for 1 pint 6 oz bottle in MA. After pour the foam took over the glass for 10 minutes (red flag - not finished fermentation). Foam is amateur and annoying. Nice honey color. Smells nice - fresh hops, like cascades (the cheap ones). Tastes surprisingly good - nice fresh crisp, may be honey with bitter (perhaps a bit too bitter) finish. Overall slightly above average. Not worth $7.00. May be $3.85 is a fare deal."

"The beer is pale golden with a subtle haze. Small white head with decent retention. The aroma brings lager scents, grain, some yeast, light floral hops. Some citrus and sourdough bread in the flavor. Earthy with some bitterness in the finish. Mediocre smell and aroma. Light in body with crisp carbonation. Overall, this was just OK."
"Taste starts with a peek of sweet, ample citrus in the middle, and a lot of rounded bitterness in the close. Aftertaste a bit off, but nowhere near what the nose was hinting. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and drinkability is okay. Not all I hoped, but not as bad as feared either."

"O: I haven't had too many Cali Commons, but this matches up fairly well with the few I have had. Easy to drink and would appeal very well to any beer drinker, craft or not. Solid"
"Three Heads Common Man is a cloudy, golden lager with a very generous, cream colored foam that lasts in huge lumps. It leaves a great ring of foamy lacing. It has an aroma of light grain, fruit and caramel. It smells fresh. It's soft and pretty full bodied. The finish is sharp, dry and acidic. There's a bitter lemon peel aftertaste. It's quite top-heavy with bitterness. It is a lot like an ale, maybe an IPA or an ESB. It's a very simple, well-blended flavor that keeps my attention."

"Recent bottle from Village Beer Merchant. Foaming yellow coloured body. Mildly cheesy. Average mouthfeel, appropriate carbonation. Neutral taste, nothing special. So-so drinkability for what it is. Better than a macro. I would certainly drink this again if only hot tapwater was available and I was thirsty."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the light, even flavoring. The hoppy inclusions are light enough to not be off-putting for someone who doesnâ€™t like hops, but at the same time the malts were overly adjuncty, and lacked the quality of flavoring we were expecting."
"o - Overall I thought this was a decent California common; a nice refreshing summer beer. Very easy to drink, would probably have it again."

"The beer pours a clear dark amber with a thin white head and modest lacing. The nose is bitter and hoppy, but it seems like they used that completely wrong hop...one which doesn't complement the lager yeastiness. The taste is equally disappointing with an average lager malt followed by a lingering and intense bitterness. Even as it warms it's still very bitter, but starts to balance out substantially. Not terrible, but not desirable either.."
"Overall a good addition to the Three Heads lineup. A sessionable beer I would never turn down."

"I had this at Lovin' Cup in Rochester, in late March. The bartender recommenced it, I had never heard of it before. It had some hops to it, but lightly done so you could get the full taste of it. Yet it was also really smooth - hence the name special lager I guess. Either way it was an awesome beer. I'd recommend it to anyone."
