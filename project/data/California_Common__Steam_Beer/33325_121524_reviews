"Easy drinking brew. Only served on tap. Easily replaces those big breweries versions. If you're looking for a craft crossover or are just being introduced to craft beers then this is for you."

"A bit hazy, yellow orange in color, foamy white head. mild aroma, slightly sweet. Same with taste. Grainy malt, cracked corn, a bit of earthiness, some noble hops? Medium body and carbonation. Very easy to drink, and nice mild flavor.  Great for a hot New Orleans day."

"O: Overall, not bad. Flavor and smell are very good. It could be a little more drinkable, but it's definitely the most sessionable offering from Gnarly Barley."
