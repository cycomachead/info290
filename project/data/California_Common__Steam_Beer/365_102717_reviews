"Hazy gold-orange with a small sweetness on the nose. Hop bitterness and a sort is grapefruit pith tang with no real malt sweetness on the tongue. You could be drinking Bud, I guess."
"Resiny aftertaste with a mineral touch and a faint hint of bitterness. Aftertaste is just a slight beery mouthful, utterly forgettable. Not really much to recommend this, but it's a pleasant gulp."

"Overall: this is a highly drinkable beer; I'm finding I quite like it.  It's a very traditional take on the style, but I find it well-made and quite refreshing."
