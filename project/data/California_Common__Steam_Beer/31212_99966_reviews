"It's an interesting take on a steam brew, but is missing I think some of the toasty notes and classic bready character I like from the style.  It's still a very solid enjoyable brew though.  Hope someday they can NSFW."

"The nose is bread, malt, flowers, and biscuits.  A little straw and grain.  The flavor is moderately sweet, cracker, bread dough, lots of yeast mixed with floral hops.  The finish is clean, dry.  This is good, but nothing amazing.  Standard, unoffensive, but forgettable."

"On draft at the Brixton. The appearance is a very cloudy amber color, with light foam. Smelling, I find little to no aroma. The flavor is surprisingly wheat-like, something like a wheat/lager hybrid. It's definitely an easy drinker but something about the flavor did not make me want more than one. I haven't had a anchor steam in a while so I can't compare."

"The beer is mostly clear and golden hued with a soft white head. Malt, biscuits and some mild hoppiness in the aroma. Easy drinking and clean. Refreshing with a dry finish. Light in body with zesty carbonation. A decent beer. I enjoyed my pint."

"Bright and clear with a nice white head, pale gold in color. A bit of spice hop in the aroma (Saaz hops). Fairly clean flavor profile with a bit of hop flavor, and definitely fairly assertive with the hop bitterness. Dries out a bit in the finish and definitely invites another swallow. Overall nicely done and incredibly drinkable. Kicking myself for not grabbing a growler of it when I visited today."
