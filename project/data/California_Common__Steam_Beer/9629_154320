2.87,-19.2,3.5,2,3.25,2.75,3,"Oak brown with a medium head that dissappears quickly. Lots of carbonation bubbles. Smells a little like bud light, which is a turn off. Taste is a little acidic, lemons and pine needles. Carbonation and a light-medium body. Sour flavor dominates but isn't so much that it's distasteful, but not a lot of complexity in the flavor either.","Chris_the_Tartar","Mar 22, 2015"

This was served on firkin and the carbonation was very low.","StoutHunter","Beers"
