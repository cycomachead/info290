3.71,3.9,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"I haven't had too many steam beers, and to be honest, I haven't really liked any of the ones I've tried. This beer seems a bit thicker than other ones I've had, but I enjoy it more than some of them.","Alextricity","Oct 24, 2013"
3.79,6.2,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and pretty good example of the style, I find most Steam Beers to be a little on the bland side but Short's kept this one interesting with a nice malt profile and little bit of grapefruit hop flavors that worked well with this beer and it made it stick out a little. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, clean, not filling, and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I could see myself drinking a few of these when in the mood for a beer like this. What I liked the most about the beer was the balance in the flavor and aroma, I thought they were both pretty nice. What I liked the least about this beer was that it's released in the fall, I feel like this beer would be a great summer or spring release and I think it would be a nice beer to have when it's hot outside. I would buy this beer again, I could see myself keeping some in the fridge for when I'm in the mood for a beer like this and I think it would go good with a meal. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style or hoppy lager's in general. All in all I was happy with this beer, it was just as good as I remember. I haven't tried much of this style, mainly because there just aren't that many examples of it out there, but so far i would say that this is my favorite. Good job Short's, thanks for offering another solid drinkable beer in bottles.","StoutHunter","Oct 22, 2013"

I have no idea how to score it. Pretty easy drinker. Nice pricing point at $1.49 for the single.","GRPunk","Oct 19, 2013"

3.78,5.9,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 9/24/2013. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, grape, cracker, bread, floral, grass, pine, pepper, and floral/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of hop and yeast ester notes with a fair amount of malt; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, grape, cracker, bread, floral, grass, pine, pepper, and floral/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruit, cracker, bread, floral, grass, pine, pepper, and floral/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of hop, malt, and yeast ester flavors; with good flavor robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected for the ABV. Overall this is a very good hoppy California common style. All around good malt, hop, and yeast ester balance; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","0"

4.25,19,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Sampled at the brewery, brewer's notes "" traditional Northern Michigan style steam beer"". The pour was anice deep straw color capped with a mid size full head and bright white lace. The nose is initially elusive to pinpoint, very clean and neutral, but has some hop crispness and some malt and some esters from the yeast. The beer has a dry malty flavor balanced with hop dryness. Finish is dry and long with an aftertaste needs to be quenched with another.","jimbotrost","0"
