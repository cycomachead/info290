It is well made, and a pretty solid beer other than the smell leans a bit too much towards malt liquor fusels.","Mdog","0"

It neither looks, smells, nor tastes like one. More of a keller/zwickel to be honest. After realizing that this wasn't the amber lager I thought I was pouring, it took me a couple minutes to get into it. Alas, once I reset my expectations, this is actually a rather enjoyable beer. Mellow and light but nuanced and reasonably complex with no noticeable flaws and a well-balanced flavor.","Phocion","Dec 13, 2014"

Smell is quite refreshing as I haven't had a lager for quite some time. I can smell a little sweet malts and maybe some hops in there that add to the sweetness but seem complimentary. Nothing strong in the nose here. Pretty tame as expected. Taste is of sweet malts, toned down hops to balance. I get a real buttery taste to the beer which is unique and surprising. Mouthfeel is thin as one would expect. Overall this is a pretty decent lager. The taste is quite unique with the buttery notes and was a nice surprise.","NeedBeerHere","Jan 11, 2014"
