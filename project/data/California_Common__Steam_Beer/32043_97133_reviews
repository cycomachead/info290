"This is a much more nuanced version than the earlier ones available . The colour is darker than Anchor Steam and the flavour bigger and more complex. The yeast issue seems to be resolved and the beer has that perfect combination of ale and lager that makes for great drinakbility. A sessionable beer that arrived just in time for the heart of summer."
"O: Enjoyed the malts, but the yeast left an unpleasant aftertaste. Hopefully this was because of the first run, but this beer did not have nearly as pleasant of a yeast profile as Anchor Steam."
