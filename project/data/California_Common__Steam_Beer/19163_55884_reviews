"O - I not not have much experience with this style. I think Anchor is the only other that I have tried. After reading the description it seems to follow the guidelines. It just seems like a boring style to me. It is easy drinking. It kind of reminds me of a Euro lager."
"The Steamy Windows is decent not spectacular.  The beer I had was overprimed which I'm sure affected the taste and scent.  The beer poured a golden color with huge white fizzy head that left some lacing.  The scent was grassy like.  The taste was crisp and clean.  Overall it was ok,"

"O: Holy Shit, Batman! This is amazing beer. It is definitely California Common, aka 'Steam Beer.' But the added bonus of the light spicing and fruit esters make this really refreshing. The sweet to bitter balance could not be more perfect. I will go back to this again and again....when I am in Michigan. #pureMichigan"

"Craft beer has a certain quality that cannot be replicated by industrial, multinational breweries nor by homebrewers and starter kits. As a microbrewery, you never want your beer to resemble either of those extremes; Steamy Windows, the only beer I've yet to try from Liberty Street Brewing, seems like it could have been made by either. That's not a good first impression."

"Nothing mind blowing, here, but it was certainly something you could kick back and drink a bunch of without getting fatigued (or drunk, for that matter). Mellow and contempt, I think I may actually prefer this one to Anchor Steam, although it's been a while since I've had that one, maybe too long to compare. Not something I would actively seek out, but something I'd get from time to time at the brewpub for a relaxing change of pace."
"Overall, Very easy drinking and approachable. Very well balanced."

"Overall - This is nothing like the steam beer I tried by Anchor Brewing.. I don't particularly like it."

"Overall I wasn't a fan or impressed by this beer and I thought it was a below average example of the style. it was pretty dull and somehow managed to be rough around the edges, it didn't have all the aspects that I look for in the style. This beer didn't have good drinkability, it wasn't that smooth and the taste for sure didn't hold my attention, one is more than enough for me, I don't want to drink another one. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it seemed pretty true to style but it could have been a little smoother. What I liked the least about this beer was the taste, it was pretty simple and dull and the flavors didn't seem nearly as clean as they should be. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's not worth my time and I can't say that I would recommend it to anyone. All in all I was pretty let down with this beer, so far Liberty Street has been disappointing me, both the beers they have bottled have been pretty underwhelming with this one being the worst of the two, I know they can make some good beer, I have had them before, but if they keep bottling these bland beers instead, it's not going to work out good for them, better luck next time guys this one needs some work and so Far it's my least favorite beer from Liberty Street."
"Overall, this just isn't a beer I see myself seeking out again. It's the definition of an average brew."

"Overall this beer did not bring a lot to the table but it certainly wasn't bad. I'd probably pass on it for something else though."
"Overall, nice flavor and easy drinking. But if I wasn't told it was in the Cal. Common style, I would have though it was simply another amber lager."
"I could have another, this is tasty"
"D_Very easy drinking. Quite flavorful too."
"Taste is hoppy, smooth, wet. Great tasting. Not overly complex or challenging but really good. It seems to me that Liberty Street just brews solid gold. I had no idea what I was ordering when I said I wanted a ""Steamy Window"" but I'm willing to do that here because I know they don't brew garbage. Another great brew. I just wish more people could experience these brews instead of just people in southeast Michigan!"
