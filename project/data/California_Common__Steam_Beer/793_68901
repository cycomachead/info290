3.79,1.1,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"O - This is one nice Lager from Lake Louie. It has more hops that previous (older) reviews would indicate so I wonder if there is a newer recipe since it has made a return.","Ri0","May 16, 2014"

3.45,-8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This was all right. Felt like a juiced-up red lager at times, but it wasn't bad.","Strix","Aug 26, 2011"
3.58,-4.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a light copper in color. In the taste, sweet malts and grain, fruity ale yeast and a mild hop balance. A little green apple, caramel, tea like hop bitterness and a more or less clean finish. Mild but a decent beer, glad I got an opportunity to try it.","Stinkypuss","Aug 20, 2011"
3.85,2.7,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"While inconsistent at times, I really do appreciate the goings-on at Lake Louie. It's fantastic to see such a small operation pumping out a wide variety of styles and taking risks. Well done, Tommy.","BarrytheBear","Aug 13, 2011"
4.1,9.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"It's drinkable, for sure, but not the light-bodied, simple-focus lawnmower beer that the name likely suggests. It's best served cool, not cold, while watching one's bug zapper illuminate the night air.","cokes","Jul 30, 2011"
3.92,4.5,5,3,4,4,4.5,"Overall - Good to see a local take on the steam beer. And a very flavorful take it is.","scaliasux","Jul 06, 2011"
3.75,0,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Lightly bitter aftertaste, key malty flavors of multigrain bread and bitter walnut. Medium bodied, slightly creamy. Fairly simple and straightforward, easy enough to drink. Glad to see Lake Louie trying their hand at different styles like this.","emerge077","Jun 13, 2011"
3.48,-7.2,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"The best part is that each component is not overwhelming, which makes this and easily sessionable beer.","SykDoc","Jun 10, 2011"
3.75,0,3.5,3.5,4,3,4,"Overall, a tasty beer and very good for the style. Slightly bitter and very malty.","adman08","Jun 04, 2011"
4,6.7,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a nice example of a very decent IPA. A little darker color than I would have expected and a decent smell and head on it. Taste is very nice, doesn't overwhelm nor underperform. If you have a chance to try some you should as it's a very nice example of an IPA.","sendsilk","May 28, 2011"
4,6.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours clear mahogany with cream colored 2 finger head that settles back down to a quarter inch floating layer with interesting lacing. Very carbonated. This beer is supposedly made with primarily a Black Malt at small enough amounts to appear reddish. It certainly doesn't smell or taste like any Black Malt I've ever had. It has the intensely nutty hazelnut aroma of a really nice brown ale, with light amounts of grassy herbal hops. The hops do a nice initial pine and woody strike on the palate and dissipate quickly for the roasted nut flavored malt tones with just a tiniest whisper of lychee fruit-like esters. The brewery claims that there are supposed to be black cherry tones, but my tongue says lychee instead. Goes down easy, light bodied and smooth, can be sessioned if you are smart about your pace. Somebody somewhere called this a good "lawnmower" beer. I'd have to agree. Its a great summer thirst quencher with enough flavor to multitask as a serviceable sipper as well.","WastingFreetime","May 09, 2011"
4.1,9.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a golden amber with a merangue-thick frothy head. Clean herbal, grassy, and sweet smell. Pleasantly soft flowery flavors of clover honey are set against a grainy malty base. A great big clean dose of citrusy piney hops balance beutifully for a excellant overall beer flavor. This is a much more substantial and flavorful summer seasonal than the usual thin watery hot weather golden whatevers that come out this time of year. But still very a drinkable and enjoyable lager. Home run.","lester619","Beers"
4.55,21.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"I am thoroughly impressed by this beer. While the name lends itself to the beach-beer ideology, I see this rather as a beer to be enjoyed within the relative safety of the screen porch or hammock. Rock solid beer, probably best enjoyed before summer even rolls in.","Skidz","0"
