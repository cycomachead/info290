4.25,13.3,,,,,,"05/29/13 On tap at Rattle N Hum, NYC. Lovely creamy head & mouth feel. At the low end of the IPA IBU scale this really hit the spot. The bitter has no bite. Simple dry aftertaste. At 5.7 ABV this could be the start of a long relationship, but availability appears to be a bit hit & miss, so if you find it, give it a try.","seedyone","Nov 24, 2014"

3,-20,3.75,3.75,2.5,2.75,3,"Had this on tap at Birdsall House in Peekskill. It is my first Steam Beer so maybe this is how the style is supposed to taste. This beer was completely unbalanced with a weak malt presence and an over the top yet extremely bitter hop profile. If you like to drink a glass of bitter hops, then this beer is for you. I proceeded to drink a few west coast IPA's after this one that completely blew me away.","kbrod7","Aug 23, 2013"

The aroma is floral hoppy, with a very nice finish of Mt. Hood hops which lend an astringent, earthy hop character to the mix. I also blended the hop common with another peekskill pale; ""wake up call"" on a 3/4 to 1/4 basis (favoring the Hop Common) ....excellent as a blend as well.","MysticRuler","Feb 15, 2012"

3.85,2.7,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"A burnt orange color topped with a dense head of foam, Hop Common is definitely sessionable and pairs very well with the food on the menu at the brewpub. The first sip tasted woody and left lacing on my pint glass. Nicely carbonated and somewhat dry, this well balanced beer has a creamy mouthfeel and a hoppy finish. Regularly on tap and well executed, it's worth a try either on its own or along with some of Peekskill's other brews.","Keene","Mar 07, 2010"
4.05,8,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Yes siree, I could do with a sixer or two of this one. Great to see something different from a brew-pub. I believe Peekskill Brewery is relatively new, but they've got some tastee brews over there. This may be my favorite yet.","modernartblues","Feb 28, 2010"
3.81,1.6,4.5,3.5,4,3,4,"A great drinking local brew. The beer was a looker. Nice dark copper color with solid lacing. It was a mix between an American IPA and a Cali Common. Good taste and decent mouthfeel. A solid mix between Anchor Steam and a traditional IPA. The pubs best offering.","BavariaYeti","May 26, 2009"
4.47,19.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Hop Common from the Peekskill brewery and that of Defiant Brewing in Pearl River NY are one of the same as the brewmaster at Defiant produces some of the brews served at Peekskill Brewing. This is a wonderful brew; grapefruit and sticky hops dominate the palate and nose in what is simply an EZ drinking and immensely enjoyable hop laden brew. Fantastic acid balance giving this concoction extreme drinkability. Served in a ""proper"" pint on scene you will simply love it!","barknee","Beers"
3.78,0.8,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"On tap at the Brewery in Peekskill, pours clear lighter copper amber, supporting a middle of the road off white head, and then showing better then average lace. Just a hint of hops in the nose. Balanced brew, toffee malts a hint of tropical fruit and grainy hops. Nothing special, but a decent offering for a tiny brwery that is hosting a boatload of guest taps and still searching/finding its way with its own brews.","Billolick","0"
