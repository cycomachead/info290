But, this and their IPA (which are their only two beers, it seems), appear to have the same malt and hop profile after all, with slightly different yeast strains to boot. If I were to choose between the two, I'd probably go for this one (I'm a sucker for steam beer) but it's fantastically simple and mediocre for what it perhaps intends to be. I really hope their next offerings to come through town are more unique, because these made me a bit sad.","magictacosinus","Dec 10, 2013"
