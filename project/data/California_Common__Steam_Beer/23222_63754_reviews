"Exceptionally smooth drinking lager.  Poured from a 1 pint bottle, first chance to finally try a TG.  Not disappointed & would definitely recommend."

"Nice easy drinking lager! Great price."

"This is weird, and not necessarily in a good way. Surprisingly bitter, citric, yeasty, with little maltiness.  Definitely interesting."
"Overall:  Picked up a bomber in Wiscoland to continue trying the available TG beers.  This is usually on the shelf but I had avoided it due to it being a lager.  It is well made, and a pretty solid beer other than the smell leans a bit too much towards malt liquor fusels."

"I thought that it was a kellerbier more than a California Common, and it has something macro lager (though it is unfiltered). I think the price point is a bit high for a bomber - I could find beer that is simple and easy-to-drink in a six-pack for just under twice as much. It is easy-to-drink. Wasn't too impressed overall."
"After drinking there IPA and APA's i can't drink lighter beers anymore.  But it compares well with the style."

""
"opened 1, ended going back and getting three more. These things are truly awesome."
""
""
"Maybe just not my style but it didn't really have enough to impress me. Had a very macro taste and feel."

"I have to admit that this wasn't the beer I was expecting. If rating strictly to style, I would be much more harsh because, well... this isn't a California Common. It neither looks, smells, nor tastes like one. More of a keller/zwickel to be honest. After realizing that this wasn't the amber lager I thought I was pouring, it took me a couple minutes to get into it. Alas, once I reset my expectations, this is actually a rather enjoyable beer. Mellow and light but nuanced and reasonably complex with no noticeable flaws and a well-balanced flavor."

"I'm not sure I'd need to get this one again.  I like lagers just as much as the next guy, but this was pretty standard.  Maybe twas overhyped for me?"

"A simple beer but executed without flaw. Extremely drinkable."
""
""
"A pretty good beer from a not overly popular style. I figured TG would have went the non-traditional route on this beer, but it appears they chose to be very restrained with it."
"Very cloudy light straw colored body. Kind of looks like pee. Very sweet yeasty smelling. Sweet tasting. Kind of a dough flavor. Pretty good for a lager."

"Overall - Pretty flavorful for a lager. Very malty though. I'd like a little bit of hop bite."
""
""
""
""
""
"Delivers what it says it does. A mild lager that still brings plenty of flavor to the palate and is clean of any off flavors. Nice after having so many IPAs and hop soaked brews."
""
"O- I turn down nothing these guys do. They seem to do either everything right, or throw away everything that isn't up to A standard. Congrats!!"
"O- Nothing flashy, but sturdy and very well-done. At $5 a bomber, its still 23 cents an ounce that equates to $16.50 for a six-pack. C'mon TG, start bottling in smal format already! So while this was worth trying the one time, I probably won't be buying this again, at least not for a while."

"O) Folks just don't get to excited about drinking lagers, but for lager lovers, (try saying that 10 times fast) this one is worth seeking out. I do think this should be available in 6 packs, rather than bombers."
"Overall: A pretty solid take on a light pale lager style. Nice crisp grainy malt notes with some light citrus notes."

"I'm not a huge fan of pale lagers. But this one is far better than most. It's bright, flavorful, and clean. Excellent."

"This being my first encounter with this style, I wasn't sure what to expect. That said, the end of my only bottle had me wishing I had purchased more. It's delicious! Incredibly refreshing and easy to drink make this inoffensive beer a must have!"
"O- if you like lagers well done .. and i do.. then this one is great for the style"

"Pours out a darker yellow in color with a tiny white head that dissipates quickly. A nice looking beer. Smell is quite refreshing as I haven't had a lager for quite some time. I can smell a little sweet malts and maybe some hops in there that add to the sweetness but seem complimentary. Nothing strong in the nose here. Pretty tame as expected. Taste is of sweet malts, toned down hops to balance. I get a real buttery taste to the beer which is unique and surprising. Mouthfeel is thin as one would expect. Overall this is a pretty decent lager. The taste is quite unique with the buttery notes and was a nice surprise."

"what can you say here, just an all out excellent lager. its hazy and darker than just blonde, maybe light buttery in color, with a viscous white froth of head daily aroused. the nose is bread and cereal grain heavy, definitely robust compared to most. what i like about this the most is that is so flavorful while being distinctly american. it doesn't rely on german malts or czech hops to make it flavorful and interesting, it moves well beyond that, but it still falls nicely into the style guidelines while doing something very different. cereal grain flavor, lots of body, and a gently citrus hop note from about the middle onward. clean finish, lager yeast is richer than most, just such a layered and well done beer, especially for a lager. i could drink this continuously. fuller bodied, lush in feel, refreshing enough but thats not the point here. a great lager, world class in my opinion. well hopped, flavorful, grainy, clean, full."

"Light to medium bodied with light carbonation, and a sweet malty aftertaste. You can tell when you drink this beer that it is well made, but there is nothing that jumps out and grabs your attention either. I am glad I had the chance to try this though."
""
"Aw…so sweet. Grandma Dorothy would surely be proud."
""
""
"Overall not bad, lots of flavor for a light lager, lots of dough and cracker, straw, etc, and plenty of lager yeast notes but not super crisp like the beer wants to be a big imperial lager but stays soft and light. Enjoyable and refreshing."
""
""
""
"Bottle from Omensetter. Pours a mostly clear, pale golden with a medium white head. Aroma is grainy, malty, a little citrus, no hop presence at all. Taste is medium sweet, maybe slightly bitter, a little fruity. Finish lightly sweet, a hint of bitterness. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation. There isn’t a lot going on here but it’s solid."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is a pleasure to drink."
""
""
"O - a very good lager, more complexities from hops than most lagers. My second offering from TG, and another solid brew"

"Not a great beer but solid and since it was a TG brew, I would take it over other lager offerings."

"D - overall, this is a really nicely put together lager / california common. At $5.99 a bomber it's good, but I don't think I would revisit it...maybe on tap."
"This beer pours a clear golden color. The head is an inch in height, and recedes slowly into a nice cap of foam. The aroma is of bread, faint toffee, honey and floral hops. It is on the lighter side, but it is still very pleasant. The taste has all the elements of the aroma, but with a little more power. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a nice beer that I would drink again, but won't seek out again."
""
"Glad to try it. Won't be seeking this one out again though."
"O-One of my favorite easy drinking beers of all-time. A keg of this at a summer pool party would be perfect. I could drink this every day for the rest of my life. I really, really like this one."
""
""
"Flavor is mild, light bready malt notes, crisp with a very low level bitterness. Light bodied and it finishes dry and clean. Easily drinkable and deceptively simple. Pretty much how a macro should taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A simple beer overall but given the right moment, there's nothing better. Not much to think about. Just quenching, enjoyable, and very very refreshing."

"D - All around great refreshing lager. Light and crisp. I don't normally drink Lagers, but I will have more of this as it will be great to have during hot summer days. Well done TG!"

""
"Easy to drink, above average lager."
""
"Easy to drink and no real flaws, but nothing compelling about it either."
""
""
"Overall- It certainly is more Fuller’s than Anchor Steam, but the sweet malt compliments this beer very well. If you see it, go for it, as is the case with anything Toppling Goliath makes."
"Notes: On tap at The Sanctuary. Very enjoyable lager that is fresh, crisp and refreshing. Pretty simple but it has a subtle complexity and balance. Very nice on a summer day."
"Mouth feel was nice due to the head that just never went away. Drinkability was well...easy."
