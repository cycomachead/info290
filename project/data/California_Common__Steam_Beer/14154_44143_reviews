"Aroma is of nuts, caramel, toast, and mild smoke. It's the only good point to this beer. Pours deep gold with no head or lacing. Flavor has a faint caramel note in the background. The rest is old, used coffee grounds to the point of being overwhelming. A totally different coffee flavor than can be found in stouts. Light-medium mouthfeel with coffee ground finish. Supposedly it's a California Common style beer, it's nowhere close to the prototype Anchor Steam. Not recommended."

"12oz bottle, is brownish-red with a thin beige head. Aromas are mainly coffee with some grain, but not much else. Tastes include coffee, toasty grain, earthy, spicy. Mouth is creamy, somewhat acidic, with a semi-dry finish. Overall, I think this exceptionally created, but pretty one-note with not a lot of complexity. Great use of the coffee, but I'm not sure I'd buy it again."

"Overall- Well, I don't know quite what to make of it (the fact that it's a low-ABV experimental-something-something available in a reasonably priced sixer is probably what's throwing me off), but it's unique and I'd definitely seek it out. It's definitely got a unique green-roast-vegetal something going on that I usually associate with roasted-two-days-ago organic coffee. I'd definitely like to know more about the process and whatever the heck they put into this stuff. Recommended."

"O: This was not what I expected when I cracked it open, but not a bad thing. Very sessionable as a Cali Common should be, but the coffee adds an interesting complexity that puts it into a whole different category. While I enjoyed it, i don't think I could drink more then two in a sitting."

"This is like a lagered cup of FANTASTIC coffee!"

"O- REally enjoyed this beer. Would have guessed this was a brown ale or dopplebock (reminded me some of Perkulator) but the coffee works well with the steam beer."

"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass.. Pours a beautiful coffee brown with a thin slightly tan bubbly head. Smells somewhat earthy and sweet with a bitterness to it, very much like coffee. Somewhat of a cocoa like sweetness to it that goes along well with the coffee nose. Despite how clean the beer looks and the lighter brown color it is very solid in color with very little light penetration. The taste is amazing, very much like cold iced coffee. The graininess from the maize is somewhat noticeable under the initial coffee sweetness and bitterness. Has a slight creamy taste to it as if it where ice coffee with a bit of cream, not sugar however. More bitter and strong tasting in the finish. Has a nice full and tart mouth feel just like regular coffee, Medium carbonation. One of the few beer's I ever new I would definitely buy again right after trying it. Cannot wait to sip a nice cold one of these later on this summer when it starts to get nice and hot outside. A must try if you're both a coffee and craft beer lover, although I can definitely see this might not bee for everyone."
"pours out like ice tea, not what i was expecting. a thin off white head quickly rises and settles, like on a cola. no lacing is noticed and retention is very poor. smell is coffee mainly, but there are also earthy tones and malts. it's weird tasting coffee in something that isnt pitch black, but it works. has a good malt body to cary thru. mouthfeel is thin and watery, not only for coffee but also for a california common. it's nice to try coffee in something thats not a stout but i still wish it had a fuller body."
"Pours a light see through brown color with a small slightly off white head which recedes to nothing and leaves very little lace. The aroma is of bitter coffee, it is not very big though. The taste is of bitter coffee with a slight sweetness at the very end of the beer. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated but slightly thin. Overall it was an okay beer, it wouldn't be my first choice."
"Cheers!"

"D-I thought the coffee would overwhelm this beer, but this is actually a pretty well balanced beer. I'd like to have this one again."
"Pours a deep amber to light brown in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, dry and roasty coffee. In the taste, dry roasted coffee, a lighter malt and a small note of sweetness in the end. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry to sweet coffee in the aftertaste. A nice coffee presence and a thinner body, decent, but did not think it was a steam beer at all."
"light tan colour, with an eighth inch of head. Distinct coffee aroma.A little lace. Average mouthfeel, good drinkability, with good bitterness and secondary malting. Coffee very distinct. Gets bitterer towards the end, but tolerable. Fast dissipitating head."
"Poured from the bottle decant amount of head. Head is flimsy and disappears quickly. Dark in color. Strong full coffee flavor. Very enjoyable and easy to drink. Rich coffee scents that teased my taste buds. I was surprised at home full the flavor was."
"D: Happy to have experienced what a coffee infused lager is like, and a steam beer at that! Relatively drinkable, but only if you enjoy coffee."
"Pours caramel with ruby hue. Fair amount of head at first which dies down to leave enough to just barely cover the surface of the beer. The smell is of a regular red ale with notes of roasted coffee on the finish, very roasty. This beer's flavor profile allows the coffee they used to shine through. It is very refreshing and is almost reminiscent of an iced coffee. With a light mouthfeel, this beer is quite quaffable. While this beer isn't extreme, it is definitely tasty, and something you could drink all evening."
"O: Goes down very easy, very tasty, not too filling, mild kick, not a good representation of the style but a DAMN fine beer! I really like this beer but is definitely doesn't fit it's style. I'd recommend it in a heartbeat though."
"This beer is strange, and I recommend trying it to anyone that loves coffee. It's got some flaws, but overall a good beer."
"I'm pretty surprised that this is called a steam beer. Maybe it is a steam beer with coffee added, and I guess that would make sense. Whatever this is, if you're looking for a relatively low-alcohol coffee beer, Oscura is probably a good choice. All the coffee flavors, none of the acrid harshness."
"The flavor mimics the aroma with a hearty dose of bitter coffee, light spices, and toasted nuttiness from the malt. Carbonation is vigorous to the point of diluting the body mid-sip, while the back of the tongue is washed with herbal hop bitterness, more coffee, and nutty caramel. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly with a clean finish. All in all, a tasty take on the Cali Common style; something worthy of a homebrew recreation."
"O: Not an overly complex beer, but a well put together Steam Beer. Easy to drink with a nice sweet malt character."
"Thanks to Schmittymack for bringing this bottle to share last Saturday. Reading the label, I assumed this was a stout, although the bottle said nothing along those lines. The bottle Poured a dark amber color with a lingering tan head. Aromas of coffee, toasted malt and light vanilla. Palate was light to medium bodied with flavors of coffee, toasted malt, light vanilla and a hint of earthiness."
"Overall, an interesting ale. Worth a try."
"Not sure about this one, very odd, I wouldn't drink it again to quick."
"Overall: Get this beer. Its different from what you would expect. If you like coffee bender, this stuff is better in every way."
"D: I enjoyed this beer and certainly would order it again. But, if you don't like coffee, this is not the beer for you. I would recommend Oscura as a beer to accompany a dessert."
"Smells like a steam bock. Tastes... Wow. Peppery and coffee. Tons of flavour on the tongue. Very different then it looks. Well carbonated and fairly drinkable but a bit overly spicy"
"D-fairly drinkable, but not the best."
"I'm going to have to rereview this beer once I'm able to get my hands on some fresher stock. The downside is that the bottling date is on the bottom of the brown bottle printed in black lettering, which means it's impossible to see when the bottle is still full. I remember the beer being much more enjoyable than I'm tasting tonight, even from a couple months ago."
"If you'd like an easy to drink very coffee forward beer this is for you."
"Drinkability: High. Iced coffee. Refreshing. Perfect for lunch. It goes down easy."
"D/O- It's hard for me to think of this as a ""California Common"" beer as it tastes nothing like the most well known of the style, Anchor Steam. But then again ""steam"" only refers to how it's made, not what it takes like. Having said all that I really enjoyed this beer. Very easy drinking and while coffee notes were apparent from the get-go, they were not overpowering. hats off to Furthermore."
"Actually reminds me a bit of Dark Horse Perkulator. Insteresting, a bit different but a large amount of flavor with lower abv."
"It is good if you like coffee, which I do. An good beer."
"Pours a clear brown coffee color almost like iced black tea with a thinnish brownish white head and a small amount of lacing. Smells of coffee and nothing else. Tastes of a lot of freshly ground coffee. Mouthfeel is medium with a little carbonation. Drinkability is low."
"Good drinkability. An interesting twist to the California Common style. Nice job, Furthermore!"
"D - Well Damn I got an old beer. Still for $1.75 it drinks pretty good but I will have to track down a fresh one for comparison. Decent coffee beer!"
"D: goes down easy. I'm not so familiar with this category, but I like this beer"
"Brown colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Looks like a soda.Aroma is coffee.Taste also is coffee and caramel malts.Strong coffee taste prevents this from being a beer with good drinkabilty.Overall OK but the coffee is a little overpowering.I would recommend to try once."
"Super easy to drink. Really solid beverage and would probably be amazing with some chicken tacos. It has that clean finish, bright beginning of flavors, and sharp nose. Altogether I'm a fan."
"D - not bad but many other brews would come first."
"Overall: I really like this unique take on the style. It is the only coffee fueled steam beer I've ever had. I loved the combo of the traditional steam beer malt bill with the coffee. It created a fascinating profile and one I wish I could get regularly in Boston."
"Was not expecting a whole lot from this little number, but I've got to say I'm really impressed. Great taste, great feel, & I don't foresee getting too messed up from a few of these. Definitely a winner."
"Drinkability is sessionable I'd like grab their sampler case, I really really liked the Knot Stock as well interesting brews Aran Madden used to brew here in the Burgh with the Foundry and Church Brew Works, I'm glad he found a happy new home to brew at."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a light level of carbonation. The lack of carbonation hurts the drinkability a bit but overall it was pretty decent.The coffee addition in this brew is really strange for the style, but it worked out."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is pretty good if you like coffee. The coffee flavors did seem to dominate the beer a bit, but it was a pretty good coffee flavor at least. Pretty nice beer overall."
"Cheers..."
"I have to say that while I'm not overly familiar with this style, I was quite surprised to see Oscura classified as a California Common/Steam Beer. That being said...Pours a semi-translucent reddish-brown with a loose, off-white head that dissipates into a swirl of foam and a thin band around the edges of the bowl. Nose is somewhat vegetal and also suggests spent coffee grounds. Taste expresses coffee grounds, some malty sweetness (caramel or toffee), followed by a vegetal quality towards the back and a light bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a carbonation that falls just short of lively. This is an interesting beer, but I'm really unclear as to what it is trying to be. At first impression, I'm thinking American Brown, but not getting a clear style impression. Regardless, an interesting beer that's certainly worth a try if the opportunity presents but not something I would seek out."
"this is a smooth highly drinkable beer. want more, only bought a single 12oz. bottle."
"Good drinkability, good beer."
"Drinkability: Definately the best Ive had from Furthermore brewing. A nice session brown even if it is stylisticly a steam beer."
"I could easily put back a couple of these in a sitting. The coffee is not overwhelming, but a nice complement to the overall beer. This is a really nice brew. I would say this is definitely the best brew I've had from Furthermore."
"(D)- An interesting variation on the style with the fair trade coffee addition into the mix. It is rich, but is also crisp and malty with the even balance without the coffee overpowering everything. Unique stuff."
"D: for the rich taste, it is really solid, not a high ABV makes this a nice go to"
"Pours a brownish dulled copper color with small cap of off-white head, leaving little lacing. Scent is of fresh medium roasted coffee beans and only a faint touch of grassy hops and carmely malts. Taste is once again a cool, crisp burst of the fresh medium roasted coffee. Very odd having this flavor unclouded by dark roasted malts or chocolate flavors. Very iced-coffee-ish. Pale carmel malts are present and are very light grassy hop touch. Medium bodied, slightly oily. A unique beer... the coffee scent and taste alone makes this, only some faint muddled, earthy charachteristics cloudy it."
"d: I love that coffee is spreading to more and more styles. I never expected to try something like this, but it works very well."
"The beer pours a dark golden/amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has an excellent dry, roasted, coffee scent. It's earthy with little malt character. The taste is good as well. It has a light pale malt flavor with the addition of coffee. It's dry and roasted without the black and chocolate malt taste. What a concept. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn smooth coffee beer. I love the use of coffee without all the black malts."
"Another interesting brew from Furthermore. Who would have thought of coffee in a Cali. Common/Steam beer? Glad that these folks did! A solid choice for a coffee brew outside of the usual porter or stout style."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with a very nice touch of coffee, caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, with some coffee notes. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, different representation of style, this is one is a little lighter than your average coffee-flavored beer and is a good one to drink for a long time."
"D - Interestingly light for a coffee beer, it still packs the real coffee flavor punch to it. Pretty well balanced and medium-bodied giving it a rather easy drinkability."
"Quite interesting to see a coffee-infused beer that isn't already malt-heavy (porter/stout/doppelbock, etc.). This experiment is actually reasonable successful. Nice to see brewers playing around with lagers."
"Overall one the most unique beers I've ever tasted. Certainly not my favorite but a worthy well crafted brew."
"The beer is light bodied, crisp and full flavored with a nice dry finish, making for a nice mouthfeel. The strange metallic flavor in the finish kind of lingers and makes the drinkability suffer."
"D: Quite a curious brew - flavor grew on me after a few sips and some warming. Common/'steam' beers aren't in the normal rotation for me and one with coffee added is certainly a first...recommended for a try if you find one. Wouldn't mind having another - thanks again, Adam!"
"D: This is a strange beer, but I can attest to drinking it chilled on a summer day and enjoying it. Drinking it is pretty effortless, but maybe I am too much of a coffee lover."
"Oscura has a dark copper look and a loose off white cap that faded into the darkness. Looks like a simple beer and not as dark as I was expecting for being brewed with some fair trade coffee. The smell consists of some sweet malt with a light coffee backing and grain. The taste is the same, exactly. There is a nice amount of coffee in here, but it's rather quite subdued. For being a steam beer, I think the coffee is at the right spot as any more would have been to much. A simple style with a simple amount of coffee. Light to medium bodied with carb hitting the tounge, this one is not dead. Oscura did not wow me, so i wont be going back for it, well maybe if it's on tap I will."
"Thanks Jer & Karen."
"This beer smells exactly like my morning coffee, brewed with fair trade coffee so I think this qualifies as me being a good person. Didn't expect it to be a light brownish amber after smelling it. The head was the faintest brown and faded quick. Aroma was outstanding and full of coffee and dry cocoa. Very malty smell and a slight sweetness. Taste fell short for me, the lager taste shows up out of nowhere. A bit surprising and offputting, don't get me wrong...it is a tasty brew, just unexpected. Mouthfeel is standard lager, thin and crisp. Very drinkable and very tasty, could sit around and watch football with some of this."
"D - An interesting beer that would need to be chosen during cold months of the year without a doubt. I can't imagine having a coffee type brew in the summer, but during the winter it is solid. I would however, avoid having more than one or two of these regardless of the year."
"Pours out a very nice clear red color. It's somewhere between copper, and a dark amber, nice looking. A little 1.5cm head forms on top, but the bubbles are so loose that it sort of fades quickly. Still looks pretty nice, but the head is a little boring. The smell is interesting. Very clean and crisp, but a very nice caramelly sweetness. I like the smell, but there isn't exactly enough in there. The one other thing that I can find is a bit of toastiness, which seems odd considering the color, I wouldn't expect to find this much burnt, toasty smell in there. The taste is where it gets interesting I think. You get a very nice grainy sweetness, that is filled up and balanced with the roastiness. It's really nice. You also get a nice slight herbal bitterness balanced with sweetness. The yeast prfile is very clean, which brings out the roasted flavors. Part of this flavor almost seems to skip over that moderate nutty, slightly toasty malt flavor I'd expect for the color. I find this really enjoyable and tasty. The body is a little thin, the carbonation rushes in but isn't too exiting. The drinkability is pretty good though. Enjoyable, not too heavy or overdone, but the roastiness is still quite interesting."
"Overall this one was not what i expected but it was worth the try. Certainly an interesting brew and the brewer should be complemented for the creativity. Just kind of missed the mark with me a little."
"D - I felt like this should be a stout. I'm definitely not used to a lighter coffee beer. While it lacked a bit of body, Oscura definitely makes up for it in the aroma and flavor departments."
"D: A nice coffee beer. California common, I think not. If u are in the mood for a coffee forward beer, this is a goood choice."
"It went down easy enough but I couldn't see drinking more than 2 of these in a sitting."
"Drinkability-This was a pretty interesting brew. Not really in a good or bad way. I'd have another if offered just wouldn't seek it out."
"D - This is a fine Cali Common. I once brewed a Steam beer based on an Anchor clone recipe w/ cold brewed Panamanian coffee, but this is more seemless in flavor, which is good. The base beer isn't overwhelmend by the beans-well done!"
"this one pours a medium brown color with a 1/2 inch head and some good sticky lacing the smell is roasted coffee but not overpowering i smell malt and some hops some toffee its good! the taste is roasted coffee first then some sweet malts and toffee with some hops..IMO ... this is a coffee lager and a good one to start with if you want to sample coffee brews of all styles..i like this one its smooth and drinkable again a good place to start.. ill buy it again and ill recommended it for 1st time coffee infused samplers and others who just like coffee brews this one one is definably lighter then the stouts and ports in the coffee style"
"Big Thanks to Beerisheaven for this one."
"A 12 ounce bottle purchased at Abe's in Bethlehem for around $1.75. Glad to see this brewery entering the PA market. Upon pouring into my shaker glass, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this was not another coffee infused porter/stout. Appears the color of iced tea with about two fingers of quickly fading off white foam. Nose and flavor are dominated by notes of medium roasted coffee and rich toasted cereal grains, followed by earthy hops, slightly spicy, hints of citrus, a pleasing bitterness to compliment the sweetness of the caramelized malt. Crisp, bitter, and approaching full bodied with adequate carbonation. A great addition to the PA beer scene."
"D: Very quaffable, under 6%. I love coffee, beer and coffee in beer. A solid ale, the best I've had from Furthermore."
"I am sure having this FRESH on tap help a lot--I would bet the bottled version is not as good. I will have to try that experiment as I know this beer is available in PA now."
"For coffee beer lovers or is that beer coffee lovers."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a nice bite of carbonation."
"This is on the top of the list for coffee infused beers. Very nice head bout an inch thick that never went flat nice rich hops light, the coffee in this beer is just overall delicious. Not acidic like alot of coffee beers taste like. It didn't last long it was too easy to drink and went down nice and smooth. Ill easily be picking this one up again."
"This was definitely a weird one. I honestly liked all of the individual components of this beer. Well done coffee character. Good backing flavors. A crisp, smooth, and easydrinking body. The problem is, I don't like my coffee beers feeling like a Lager and I don't like my Lagers having coffee in them. Thus the drinkibility takes a hit. I drank this with my meal and it just didn't work at all for me. Probably should have saved it for a nightcap. Otherwise, this is definitley one to check out if your a coffee-head."
"This - is - a - fantastic - coffee - beer."
"Overall, I just can't seem to like this beer. I like coffee beers, but this beer is just simply coffee and no beer. I really don't know much about this beer, but I probably won't be drinking it again anytime soon."
"drinkability is good. this is a mellow and easy-drinking coffee beer with just enough richness and character to sustain itself, yet still refreshing enough to hold up for multiple rounds. nicely composed and uniquely flavorful. cheers!"
"The appearance/aroma really hurt the overall rating, but I thought this was a pretty good beer. Furthermore has yet to disappoint."
"Pours a glowing copper color with two fingers of creamy head that wants to camp out for a bit. OK, I guess it wants to camp out forever since I have been waiting here for 15 minutes and haven't noticed a change. Guess I'm going to have to dive in. Smells like freshly ground coffee beans, before they have been brewed. Not much else, but still inviting. The taste is fresh roasted coffee of a cheap variety (think Folgers breakfast blend). Overall, it isn't too bad but could use a bit more body and maybe an additional element since the coffee flavor here is not of a gourmet variety."
"Drinkability is interesting. Get rid of the vegetal-old coffee ground note and this is a really nice, well-above-average beer. As is, there are some really good aspects of it, and the one really noticeable flaw, but regardless it's a very unique beer that's pretty tasty as is."
"Purchased from Three Cellars in Franklin, WI. Pours bright, deep copper color with no head. Aroma is of grain and roast coffee. Medium bodied, this beer tastes of caramel up front and has a long, slow roasted coffee finish. Definitely for fans of iced coffee. Not sure I'd want a second one right away, but would definitely drink one again in the future."
"This was done really well. Nice twist on a coffee beer that isn't a stout."
"This beer smells more like coffee (and looks less like coffee) than any coffee beer I've ever seen. I guess I'm used to coffee flavors in stouts and such. But it was very creative and quite drinkable. I must sample other Furthermore brews."
"Well. Good beer. Not at all what I was expecting. Big points for originality & confounding expectations. Well worth giving this one a whirl."
"A very nice surprise and treat. Can and will drink lots of this stuff. Yum!"
"D: I had no expectations of this beer. This was unique to anything I have tried before and is pretty good. I enjoyed it altogether, but don't know if I would seek it out. The coffee/roast/smoke flavors and aroma were great. If you're a coffee lover, give this one a try."
"I enjoy complexity in beer, but not all necessarily require a diverse flavor profile to impress me. This is a coffee beer, pure and simple. It was the first I have sampled that was not a shade of brown or black and the first that was not an ale (according to the label, this is a ale-lager hybrid). Oscura is definitely an interesting concoction and one that I would love to see other brewers trying their hand at."
"dirty who?"
"Into an imperial pint, pours a clear amber with a nice off-white starting head, then nothing but the thinnest of films, no lacing. The aroma is spicy, full of aromatic roasted coffee. One dimensional, but still nice. Tastes kind of like a beery coffee, the latter being quite strong, but some standard caramels and grains and a bit of a herbal quality to it. Has decent body, plenty of play, in all very interesting and fun to drink."
"A coffee beer without the mask of a hearty stout to hide behind. In typical Furthermore fashion, this is a rather plain base beer with a touch of uniqueness to it. This pours out a deep rusty copper color with great clarity and a well-lacing head. The aroma is an in-your-face coffee punch, but done so delicately. It is tough to get past the coffee to find any attributes in terms of aroma so if you are not a coffee fan, this probably wont turn you on at first whiff. The interesting as it blends a heavy dose of iced coffee and fruit lagerness. The finish is slighly dry and I am left with sense of cocoa. For such a light beer in terms of body, there are heavy flavors and depth. This is a well-done beer and very different from other coffee-infused beers that I have come across. It is a pretty interesting step to go with coffee in such an unroasted beer. That being said, like others in the Furthermore lineup, this would be a great dinner beer, but not one that I see myself reaching for often."
"D - A bit of a one-note song. Like Perkulator, if you like coffee, this is a fun one. But don't expect classic balance or depth. Just enjoy it for what it is, a coffee-bomb."
"D - This is a pretty good brew. I really like the smooth coffee flavors."
"A great brew I will gladly seek this one out again. It is easy to drink and much lighter than the coffee stouts so It would be great with a Sunday brunch If you are into coffee brew this one is a must try"
"By the way, is Oscura a particular style of brew? I've noticed other breweries with the same name/style. Interesting."
"I thought this would have a lot more coffee flavor to it, but was still pretty good. Much lighter in body than other coffee beers I've had. Worth a try."
"Pours murky brown. Oddest color on a coffee beer I've seen. Nose is a lot of coffee. A lot. Vibrant espresso grinds kinda fragrance. Flavor carries the same, but it's a real big punch in the mouth. And the lingering aftertaste is so intense and coffee-forward. Intense. Not much going on here besides coffee. Feel is fine. So is drinkability. This is a coffee beer. Plain and simple."
"D - Not a bad beer if you like coffee just somewhat boring and one dimensional."
"This is a nice ale with a hint of coffee flavor, nice."
"On-tap at the Acadia Cafe in Minneapolis. Served in a pint glass, it a clear amber with short, white head. Interestingly, I had this shortly after sampling Peak Organics' Espresso Amber. By comparison, the Obscura has more flavor up front, but less aftertaste. It still had a wonderful, medium roast aroma and burnt chocolate flavor. There was a touch of bready malt in the background, but the coffee dominated the flavor. Unlike some coffee beers, this one isn't too over the top. It's fairly drinkable and you can tell that's beer. I'd say it's worth a try to for coffee lovers."
"Drinkability: It's different for sure. While coffee stouts are downright commonplace these days, I'm hard-pressed to name even one other coffee lager. A coffee-based brew for warmer days. Definitely worth trying a bottle."
"Bottom line: A tasty brew with the word coffee on the label..and by golly, the coffee tastes very nice indeed. A keeper."
"coffee beer, and not bad."
"Drinkability: This one's pretty good - the coffee's about as authentic as you get - but there's not too much backing up that's noticeable. Some faint malts, roasted and darker and then some, but nothing that really comes through in any noticeable way. This one's definitely all about the coffee, and while the coffee's good, it'd be nice to see a little more here backing it up."
"The unique ideas of this beer really come together nicely. The softer coffee infused with this Vienna lager combine for a delicious beer. I won't hesitate in picking this beer up again; if you get the chance to try it it's definitely worth it."
"From a brown 12oz bottle - Pours a clear light root beer brown color with a slight head and below average carbonation. Smells of roasted malts, and coffee. There is a slight dusty taste too. First sip is sweet then it is all coffee. COFFEE, COFFEE, and more COFFEE, Very light bodied. Decent mouthfeel but a tad under carbonated. Pretty good."
"Sorry."
"D- This beer is coffee [stop] That is all [stop] There is no depth or other flavors to balance it, and the coffee flavor was mostly coffee grounds not coffee bean of fresh coffee. The more I sipped this beer the more the drinkability score when down. I give them high marks for creativity but there just isn't enough follow through."
"D: Very drinkable. An excellent coffee lager...not a stout. If there is a criticism to this brew it is that it's one-dimensional...coffee. If you enjoy coffee, you will enjoy this beer...very true coffee flavor. I am enjoying the experimentation at Furthermore."
"D: This is simply too easy to drink."
"Not a bad beer, was actually a little surprised. All in all seemed like a watered down doppelbock. Overall pretty tasty though."
"Clear amber. Thin cream colored head. Lacing is pretty sporadic. Smells like coffee. Like used coffee gounds. Pretty thick. Not much else to the aroma. Decent tasting coffee beer, but I much prefer the stout/porter based coffee beers. This tastes more like just coffee than a blend of coffee/beer. I just get a lot of bitter coffee ground flavor, which is o.k., but I like a little bit more beer character in my coffee beers. Decent enough, but let's just say I'm glad I only got a single of this one."
"this was a plesant suprise, this was the lightest color coffiee beer that i have run acros so i dident have much hope for this one. to my suprise the coffiee flavor is exceptional in this one and is in purfict ballance with a robust amber lager, i couldent put this one down, it was bitter, slght bits of carmal and sour notes and had me beging for more. i need to get more of these for sure"
"Nice full malty flavor. Medium bodied. The coffee has an herbal effect here, offsetting the sweet malt. A drinkable session beer. The aftertaste is a weird --- but not bad --- combo of coffee and earthy hops. The only minor negative is that the light sweetness of the beer doesn't blend as well with the coffee as much as a smaller-bodied or darker beer might. For example, I would have chose a brown coffee ale rather than an amber pseudo-lager (Steam beer/California Common-style)."
"Appearance is good, a nice brown color with a decent amount of head and lacing. Smell and taste are pretty similar. Lots of coffee flavored malt, some spice, and a bit of yeastiness. Mouthfeel is good, nice medium body and a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is also good."
"Overall I am really unsure what this one is supposed to be. It is carbonated, the buzz I am feeling is a testament to that, and the aroma was very, very nice. But the flavor just left me hanging. It needed that extra push to really come forward and show off. Nver the less. It was still very solid and a very nice little beer, just not sure what it actually was."
"D- pretty solid drinker."
"This is really quite drinkable. Definitely an aftertaste of coffee."
"D: Very well constructed beer. The coffee flavor ends up canceling out any of the subtlety of the base beer so that's a bit of a bummer. Quite appealing otherwise."
"I liked it quite a bit but - though I'm not sure the ""herbed/spiced beer"" category is necessarily what the Oscura folks were going for, whatever it was, it just seemed to me that they missed it a bit."
"This beer captures the essence of coffee like no other, including big stouts. A coffee lovers beer. I would prefer drinking this to coffee."
"This beer pours a deep amber-brown color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes into nice lacing. The aroma is of bitter coffee grounds, with hints of caramel, and lots of piney hops. The taste has a little less coffee than the aroma, but it is still very much there. There is more hops, and a nice malt backbone. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety texture, and lively carbonation. Overall, this is one of the oddest beers I have yet tasted, and I like it. It would be perfect if I were in the mood for a coffee beer, but not something as heavy as most coffee stouts are. I will certainly drink this again."
"this beer must be drunken warm."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth. On the lighter side but I find that really enjoyable as most coffee brews tend to be heavy stouts. This one is quite refreshing, while still packing a big coffee punch. Overall, a solid new brew from Furthermore and one I could see drinking a good number of on a hot summer day. Wish I had easier access to this one. Coffee beer lovers -- find this!"
"Pours a clear amber brown with a decent sized off white head. Aroma is very sweet with toffee, caramel, bitter chocolate and coffee. The coffee flavor comes through a lot stronger in the flavor though not overpowering. Some toasted almonds as well are detected. Finishes short and coffee bitter. Medium bodied, creamy texture."
"The overall drinkablility is quite nice. I wish I had some more of this beer to share because it was quite interesting. Well done... thanks to asmokingoat for sending me this bottle..."
"Poured into a Stone IRS stem, because I was envisioning a coffee stout. Needless to say, I was surprised to see a chestnut brown pour with a nice beige head. Aroma of rich coffee beans. Taste? Try a crisp, nicely hopped lager with tons of coffee flavor. So strange, that I kinda like this. Could I drink a 6 pack of this? Probably not, but glad I grabbed a single."
"drinkability: high"
"I haven't been a big fan of Furthermore's beers for some reason. Not sure what it is, but it doesn't matter. This one is a home-run winner in my book. Unique, tasty and extremely drinkable. I'll be buying much more of this!"
"Kudos to Furthermore for this wild card. I'm liking them more and more with each new release."
"I would highly recommend this beer. I had this on-tap at the Benno's beer tent at the WI State Fair."
