After the overactive effervescence dissipated quite quickly, it's a pretty good-looking beer. Nice medium amber, opaque but no haze. Didn't get a lot on the aroma, so can't comment there. But the taste really did not do it for me. Everything about this beer was mild to the point of bland except the metallic aftertaste. Combine that with a dry finish, and I wasn't all that thrilled.","QueerBeer","Apr 29, 2014"

Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of biscuit, cracker, toast, light caramel, pear, apple, floral, grass, pepper, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of bready malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of biscuit, cracker, toast, nuttiness, light caramel, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of biscuit, cracker, toast, nuttiness, light caramel, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of bready malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. A slight metallic note noticed on the finish, but not really detrimental to the flavor. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice steam beer style. All around good balance and robustness of bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 12, 2014"

3.7,1.9,4.5,3.75,3.5,3.25,4,"Though Local Option boasts it's ""ideal for warm months", I'd add the caveat that it's a relative claim: good for a warm, mild Bavarian summers, perhaps, but better suited to late-spring or early-autumn in places with truly hot, boggy ""warm months"".  All in all, however, Dampf Loc is a beer that makes one think—though I wouldn't deign to call it ""challenging""—while being very drinkable, if not especially delicious; and I'll add bonus points, moreover, for all the welcome historical and contextual patter the brewery provides the drinker.","OrestesMethuon","Apr 04, 2014"

3.99,9.9,3.75,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a half finger white head with excellent persistence and light lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, nuts, mildly sweet lactic; I don't know why but this is reminiscent of a mild milk stout. Flavor is similar to aroma with sweet caramel malt, nuts, mild grassy hops, finishes more attenuated with less malt with light nuttiness and faint hops. Nice medium body with some creaminess. A quite nice take on the California common style, a bit sweeter and nuttier, which is nice for a change. The initial flavors are reminiscent of a very light brown ale. Quite quaffable and interesting. If this is faithful to the Dampfbier style, I'm surprised they are no longer around. I enjoyed this one; could be my favorite of this style so far.","LiquidAmber","Nov 29, 2013"

Poured a darker amber color, more deep than hazy, with a small but firm cap of white head, that retained well and left spots of lacing on the glass. Malty sweet aroma, toasted grains, caramel, fruity esters. Sweet caramel malts were in charge again on the palate, toasted bread crusts, a little buttery, hops very mild and somewhat fruity/floral. I don't know...seemed a bit off-balance to me. There was a crispness to the mouthfeel that typically comes from the hops in a beer, but in this one, I just didn't get very much hoppiness in the flavor. Light-medium body. Not really bad overall, but just seemed somewhat off to me.","Rifugium","May 10, 2013"

It'd be great if other breweries took this style on...","TMoney2591","0"
