3.21,-12.5,3.25,3.5,3,3.25,3.25,"Poured on-tap at the Tap House and served in a shaker pint, the beer is a caramel coloring, with a sparse, filmy head. Nose of nut and honey, with roasted overtones. Flavors are more of the roasted character, with a honey and toast blend to follow. Richly sweet aftertaste, with caramel and honey notes on a smooth body. The finish is slightly dry, but slightly cloying.","GarthDanielson","Aug 08, 2013"

3.65,-0.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Clear amber colored brew under a small, wispy white head. Smells mild and pleasant: sweetish doughy malt and herbal/floral hops with a little bit of caramel and a somewhat buttery element. Light herbal, leafy hop flavor over cereal grain and warm biscuit malt. Medium bodied and bitter in the finish. Enjoyable on a very warm late spring night.","wedge","Mar 03, 2012"

4.03,9.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Taste is bready but also fruity, maybe apples or pears. Some decent noble hops. Smooth mouthfeel without too much carbonation. Very easy to drink. Plenty of kick too at 6.1, although the chalkboard at the brewery said 5.8. What's .3 between friends? Not outstanding but very nice, with a lot of flavor for the style in my opinion. Solidly made less than eight miles from my door. Sweet...","daliandragon","Nov 25, 2011"
4.72,28.6,4,4.5,5,4,5,"Overall- Like I mentioned my first steam beer and it was suprisingly fruity and tasted great. Still not very good at reviewing so take this with a grain of salt, but not the beer because its perfect the way it is!","usafboy","Aug 26, 2011"

3.3,-10.1,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear light amber color with a small white head. Small bit of lacing, not much. Aroma is caramel malt with some toasty highlights and hints. Flavor is quite bready and grainy. Some generous chocolate flavors as well as the fully toasted bread. A touch of hop bitterness arrives in the finish and balances this one out quite nicely. Not quite bitter enough and I think too much breadiness and roastiness for the style.","SaCkErZ9","Dec 23, 2009"
3.42,-6.8,3.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"I've had this beer from a growler before and did not notice any sourness or creaminess. I'll chalk that up to maybe a dirty line. Otherwise this beer is smooth and drinkable. Nice to have something different from a local brewer.","tdm168","Beers"
3.52,-4.1,3,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Overall a decent beer, nice to just chill with. I personally like the hoppy finish and think that is a nice touch as well.","SIRIUS2","0"

3.63,-1.1,3.5,3,4,4,3.5,"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint-glass a slightly hazy orange with almost no head. Aroma is slight sweet malts and a trace of hops. The taste is an interestingly hoppy version of a steam beer, a nice hoppy lager. The beer is fairly light with decent carbonation. This is an enjoyable brew, but nothing all that special.","atsprings","0"
