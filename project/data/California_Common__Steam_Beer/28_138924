4.09,7.1,3.75,4,4.25,4,4,"Interesting complexity: This one starts off with a malt base that succumbs to the aforementioned hop bitterness.  But I also detect a bit of fruity sweetness in the swallow, yet the aftertaste is bitter and long lasting.  Leans to the full body side, good carbonation.  Easy to drink.","smcolw","Mar 22, 2015"

3.61,-5.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Can. Label art is very legit. Beer pours darker than expected. Clear Amber color with a big, fluffed head. Rings of lacing. Has that "common beer" aroma. The dry hops don't really stand out in the nose all too much. Common beer yeast, which I find to be very distinctive...probably Anchor's house yeast. Sweet bready malt. Very estery/fruity. Flavor is malt and yeast dominant. Fruity esters, Anchor yeast lagerishness....yes lagerishness. Bread and caramel malt. Soft floral hop.  Finish really cleans up with a lingering apple flavor. Stimulating carbonation. Not exactly what I was expecting. More hop, less sweet next time. Reminds me of a Maibock.","VelvetExtract","Mar 13, 2015"

3.6,-5.8,4.25,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Clear gold under a foamy head that fills up the glass.  Toasted, biscuit-like malts, honey, and just a little apple, melon, and strawberry fruitiness in the aroma.  Flavors of bready grain, grassy bitterness, floral hops, and earthy citrus.  Clean and crisp, easy to drink.  Similar character to other Anchor beers.  Not much of the expected Citra and Nelson qualities.","wedge","Feb 14, 2015"
