All their beers taste like your in a dark tavern standing at the bar while the bar tender turns the wooden handle and out flows a foamy froth of goodness.  These beers are excellent like drinking right out of wooden keg!!  Ahrrg...","Randygroves","Oct 06, 2014"

The scent carries a slight yeast like spice...so does the taste....I want to say rye....but not sure. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a tasty beer.","WoodBrew","Aug 28, 2013"

3.13,-4,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Pours a clear reddish amber color with a bubbly head. Not too much of a strong scent but there are malts and hops present. Starts off smooth and semi-bold with malty flavor but finishes dry and slightly bitter. Drinks rather smooth and fast as I found myself not wanting to make the dry after taste last long. A nice find and a slightly better than average brew.","Lemke10","Jan 27, 2012"
4,22.7,4,4,4,4,4,"O- The crisp hoppy lagered beer is very sessionable with some bright hop flavors that are nice. The fizz could be a bit softer but even with the full fizz the mouthfeel is a bit to big to be crisp and refreshing, but that is fine with me.","rhoadsrage","Dec 08, 2011"
3.73,14.4,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"O -- I wasn't expecting such a hop-forward character for a California Common. The spicy bitterness becomes a little overpowering and makes me think this beer is contending more with American Pale Ales than Steam Beers. Wish there was more malt, but certainly a drinkable beer.","steveh","Dec 05, 2011"

3.3,1.2,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Hoping this beer, unlike its two predecessors, won't sully my glass too much. It pours a clear wan bronze topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises grass, sweet flowers, light honey, wheat, and light buttery biscuits. The taste doesn't change much of this up, but the sweetness and the graininess are both increased together, making for an interesting flavor combination, not unlike lightly sweetened Corn Flakes. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, an okay brew, one that doesn't impress, but also one that doesn't necessarily disappoint, either. It's a nice easy-drinker, something some might call a good lawnmower beer (I could drink anything after/during yardwork, so this term has little meaning to me).","TMoney2591","Beers"
3.25,-0.3,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Mellow feel, light bodied with moderate carbonation. Grassy and floral again, some mild hop bitterness in the middle, lingering into the finish. A bit of smooth maltiness, husks and all, a simple flavor. With a bigger sip, there is more residual bitterness that builds in the aftertaste. Overall it's a simple, utilitarian session beer. Clean with no flaws, it just may not hold interest for everyone.","emerge077","0"
