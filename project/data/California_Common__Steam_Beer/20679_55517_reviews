"Pours a slightly hazy light amber color, with a white head that stands just over an inch tall. Retention is good, and as I drink it leaves some beautiful lacing in my glass. Smell is sweet, with a bit of orange hop aroma. Taste is smooth, with floral and citric hops, malts are bready (go figure). Mouthfeel is slightly thicker than expected, with average carbonation. This is a really enjoyable beer, nice and easy-going. A solid offering from Everybody's."
"Poured a slightly hazy orange-amber with a small but creamy cap of white head. Moderate, steady carb. Aroma is crisp with fresh hops and grains. Biscuity taste well balanced with grassy and piney hops, with light fruit notes. Light-medium mouthfeel, and quite nice overall."
"A really solid Pale Ale in my book with just enough sweetness to balance the hops and a good dose of flavour and aroma hops."
"This beer pours a hazy dark orange color with a finger and a half or so of think white head. The aroma is strong with fruity hops and malty sweetness. The taste begins malty sweet and then switches to citrusy hops and then finishes with more complex maltiness. The mouthfeel was very smooth and it finished clean. I really enjoyed this beer and would definitely suggest it to anyone."
"- Had about 4 pints of this back to back... and love it... it's enough to get me back to the establishment serving it. Great job on a great NW brew..."
"D: An outstanding steam beer. I would love to try it again next to Anchor Steam and see how the two compare. I feel like this is a good contender. I actually had it in the sampler and enjoyed it enough to drink a full pint afterward."
"Overall, a very good, bordering on great, beer. Worth some effort to try."
"Washington State produces precious few California common or steam beers. This one is bright orange-topaz, unfiltered, and sports a thick, lumpy head of duff. It has a grainy aroma and a light, quaffable body. But the clean, lagered crispness you'd expect is absent as is any visual clarity. While not a dramatically flawed beer, Daily Bread can't compare to west coast standards from the likes of Anchor or Heater Allen and doesn't make for a choice pick among Everybody's regular offerings."
"Wicked easy drinking, and quite tasty."
"Drinkability is good, a nice hoppy beer. The fact that they apparently brewed this with a lager yeast at ale yeast temps didn't really impart much character (chico ale yeast is just as neutral), but it's never the less a tasty beer in the classic local style. The fact that I can get my hop fix without much alcohol really helps, a session beer for hop heads."
