4.04,4.9,4,3.75,4.25,4,4,"Amber in color topped by a stiff foamy persistent cap.  Looks good.  Great lace.  This smells like a rich lager beer. Grain, honey, biscuit, soft malt. The taste is intriguing.  There's the hint of spruce right away.  Then a berry-honey wash of sweetness.  Now more biscuit and bread. A nice bitter hop here keeps it all clean and dry. Great flavor, nothing over the top. Smooth and well-crafted body. This is a tasty easy drinking beer.","JackieTH","Jan 09, 2015"

3.5,-9.1,,,,,,"Overall: Pretty good experimental beer. I expected more exciting flavors from the maple syrup and spruce, but didn't detect much of it in the taste. I've never had such a bitter, hoppy lager (is it an IPL, or an IPCC?) , and it was pretty good. It's already really good as it is, but like I said earlier, I feel that the hops overpowered the malt and the rest of the flavors a little too much. Some age to mellow out the hops might do well for it, and Summit itself even suggests aging.","enjambed","Nov 01, 2014"

5,29.9,,,,,,"This is amazing stuff from Summit. I am sad to think that soon its not going to be available. I've been stockpiling (and subsequently drinking) six packs. It is big and bold and bitter. The taste is smooth yet bitter and piney. There is a faint trace of the maple syrup. This is a perfect beer from a cold MN fall night.","SurlyZach","Oct 30, 2014"

3.75,-2.6,,,,,,"I didn't think I was going to like this beer. I am generally not a fan of lagers, and the Summit Unchained series has been more miss than hit for me. But this one has been a pleasant surprise. I can't say I really notice the maple syrup or spruce tips, but if I were forced to drink lagers for the rest of my life, I would put it in my rotation. It's fairly balanced, with a clean, bitter finish, and a maltiness that lives up to its dark, well past amber, hue. Can I detect maple? No. Did I like it? Yeah.","DaveAnderson","Sep 25, 2014"

4.12,7,5,3,4.5,4,4.5,"Dark amber color, pleasant, if weak, aroma with pine (well, spruce, I guess) evident. This is a much more bitter beer than I usually like, but I like this one because of the mix of the maple syrup with the bitters of the hops/tips. This is especially evident in the finish… piney bitterness with a very nice sweetness. Very good, Summit. Kudos to brewer Christian Dixon. A high in bitterness beer I actually like!","MNAle","Sep 18, 2014"
