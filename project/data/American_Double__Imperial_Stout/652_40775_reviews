"Assuming this is lightly infected. Looks ok and goes downhill from there. Not bad, you can sense a quality beer in there, but off."

"Some coffee taste, mostly chemical aftertaste."

"O - I haven't been this worried about an infection since that time I hooked up with a chick in the parking lot of a Red Roof Inn. Luckily, both instances were infection free. This is an excellent coffee stout, but the infection rumors had me apprehensive. I am enjoying this beer very much on a borderline chilly Independence Day eve."

"2013 bottle as an extra in trade. Pours black with a one finger dark khaki head. Aroma of chocolate, some coffee, vanilla oak, bourbon. Flavor is bourbon heavy though not boozy, barely any coffee, light chocolate, nice vanilla finish. Bit of a Jack and Coke flavor going on here, supplemented by the lack of body. Body is on the thin side with medium carbonation. Overall a nice flavor but seems to need a good bit more body. Doesn't seem like this one is infected so that's good! Not bad but I don't think I'll seek this one out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Edit for second attempt. The fact that knew what I was getting myself into helps some. The sour flavor is not so off-putting as I originally described. Mixing with the obvious bourbon and coffee rounds it out. Even if this had been an intentional characteristic it wouldn't be grabbing high marks for taste."

"O: Even though the 2012 was infected, it was still enjoyable. I found I was actually gravitating to it more when I need to take a break from the bourbon heavy 2013. To me, this is another BB stout from the Midwest along the lines of Blackout, Black Note and BA Siberian. I wonder if they use the same barrels."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Definitely a nice, coffee stout, but the sour in the taste is a bit offputting. It doesn't completely dominate the taste but does give it a twist. Still, a nice stout."

"Re-review: Had the 2014 vintage, poured into a Surly Darkness goblet today, 2/28/2014. So... not going to lie, this is clearly contaminated. I got no coffee, though I did get a bit of oak, vanilla and bourbon. But the mouthfeel is thinner than expected even for the base stout and there is a tangy fruitiness to this that reminds me of green apples. Simply not a good beer and I decided it wasn't worth finishing. I'm leaving the scores the same as it was from last year's vintage which was delicious."
""
""
""
""
"O: Delicious, lots of flavors and mighty sweet. Central Waters knows how to do this kind of beer."
"O - A winter treat that is fun and easy to drink. I do not age this as it begins to turn tart over time. Enjoy it fresh for maximum flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Dangerously drinkable. I'm gonna cellar this as well and check on it next year. Provided, of course, these aren't infected and recalled."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a beer for ageing. I have two more bottles form 2013 vintage and I will drink one as a two year, and one as a three year. This is coming very soon to my local and I will be buying a case to age."
""
""
""
""

"An excellent beer, but frankly a little bit of a let-down since I expected more of a coffee presence in this beer. I had to trade for this, so it's possible that the coffee is much stronger when it's fresh. I would definitely try this again some time if I can score some more in the future."
"O- It was ok."

"Pours out dark as night with a one finger head that is a dark beige or light brown. Smell is a tiny bit of vanilla, definitely some coffee, dark fruits, and no hop presence that I can smell at all. Taste is a little bit of bourbon, some decent coffee, vanilla, and the obvious dark fruits. Not sure if this is an old six pack as it isn't as coffee forward as this beer usually is. Mouthfeel is pretty nice and thick. It's no BCBS but it is thicker than most. Overall this is a great beer. I know it's better fresh. This must be an old six pack."

"O: a very tasty coffee stout, well on par w/ even the likes of KBS, especially given this is more widely available"

"O I have been going nuts over this beer. I have never had, and I've tried and tried, a non-infected bottle. I finally got lucky. Wow! Great stuff. I love a good coffee stout that doesn't go overboard with the sweetness. This is damn near perfect with it's bitterness and sweetness. Loved it. Yikes, it's been a journey but now I finally got what everyone else has been talking about."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Overall a nice bourbon forward stout with some great roasted coffee flavors. The coffee they chose worked great with the barrel but I feel like more of the coffee would have only made this that much better. Regardless, a recommended bourbon barrel coffee stout. No signs of infection."

"Beer is medium-heavy in body, with medium-low carbonation, leading to a soft, slightly foamy mouthfeel that comes across a bit slowly as a result of the low carbonation. Higher levels of carbonation would do significantly more to make this somewhat more foamy on the palate and also enhance its ease as a slow sipper. Ethanol is fairly easily felt in the nostrils and back of the throat, somewhat surprising given the relatively low ABV here. Closes quite dry, with substantial stickiness clinging to the palate. In general, a fairly mediocre presence as this goes across the palate."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is really thin, light, but drinkable."
""
""
"Especially considering the price, this one was a big letdown. Reminds me of a breakfast stout that I let sit for 5 or so months...the coffee fades too far back and the flavors become confused. Not quite a drain pour, but close."
""
""
""
""
"The chocolate gives the beer as super mouthfeel. Bring me more please?"
""
""
"D-nice notes of coffee and reasonably flavorful. hints of sweetness and a decent feel. prerty solid but nothing super special."
""
""
"O - This one deson't really hit the notes that I look for in a bourbon barrel stout. It's a good beer, not great. I probably would not purchase this one again."

"O- The aroma and flavor make this one a keeper. Big flavors, tons of bourbon and coffee."
""
""
""
"O-Tastes like a stout mixed with a flanders with the mouthfeel of a diet soda. This was very disappointing, but perhaps I got a bad bottle."

"Overall: Peruvian Morning is a great barrel-aged coffee stout. The coffee is well balanced, doesn't appear to have faded too much, and isn't at all stale tasting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A.. fucking.. mazing.. central waters is an asset to the state of WI and is often over looked by the beer geeks here. Too bad.. Peruvian Morning rivals the best stouts I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
"O = I'm OK with this beer as a stout but it is a heavyweight for beginners in stout enjoyment. I am STILL quite jarred by the flavor profile and that was OVER an HOUR AGO! I think the best enjoyment of this beer for me is paired with a dark maduro; a longlasting Churchill."

"*was this infected? So weird."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Coffee, bourbon, and barrel? Yes, infected? No!? Drinkable none the less."
""
"Overall: I've heard a lot about this beer and I was very happy to finally get to try it. No doubt can fulfill even the most picky stout fans. Seems to be just off of the great stouts but is no doubt a great brew."
"O: A very nice brew. It's decadently sweet in some areas and quite bitter in others, finally very dry in the end. Nice journey of sensations. Bourbon treatment is not overpowering in this one, just complementary but still strong enough to withstand the somewhat strong coffee flavors. Nice balance overall and quite tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"I would like to have a non soured version and compare to KBS. Definitely worth a try even with the risk of getting an infected batch."
""
""
""
"I have heard such wonderful things about this brew, my expectations were much higher. apparently they've had some infection issues with this in consecutive years, so I can only assume that was the case for me, although the beer wasn't super off, it just wasn't what it was advertised as. pours a thin looking brown with some red hues in the light and a small cream colored head. the nose is like an attic, dusty and undisturbed. its also little tangy, which makes me think somethings up, but the bourbon is strong, and the coffee is acidic and bright. the flavor is coffee dominant, with roasty malt and some faint cocoa powder notes. the finish is funny, highly acidic, not quite vinegar, but moving in that direction. its a strange contrast to all the bourbon that's there at the end, and the alcohol really stands out. I don't taste that bacterial sort of funk, but maybe this is indeed infected. the mouthfeel is really thin for the style, watery but well carbonated. this is a miss in many ways, which makes me assume I had a bad bottle. I will have to source another, and try again. this is supposed to be fantastic beer, so it deserves another shot, although two years in a row of bad batches has me concerned about central waters more generally."
""
""
""
""
"O- I was hoping to land one that wasn't infected, but I was let down. Even if I was expecting this one to be a sour stout like ""funk metal"" or ""tart of darkness"" I'd still be let down. Since I got a ""sour stout"" I pretty much rated it according to that style, and I feel like it was average at best with that mindset. I'd really love to get a bottle that wasn't infected, so I can see what this beer is supposed to be all about."
""
""
"O- Too bitter and thin for my liking. Nothing I will be seaking out again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very interesting, would have paired well with some Bruery beers. I went in expecting sour and was left with exactly that. If I was expecting a great imperial stout I would have been disappointed. Despite the sourness, this was good and unexpected."
""
""
"Bottom Line: Boom! head shot!"
""
""
"tastes like a liquified grape tootsie roll pop"
""
""

"O - If you're looking for a delicious coffee stout, I highly recommend PM. I'd definitely buy again. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: i find this to be quite nice to be honest. it's not the most complex brew, but it is fairly well balanced. the flavors intermingle nicely, just wish that the palate was left with a bit more on it during each sip."

"An outstanding bourbon barrel aged coffee stout. What it lacks in body it makes up for in near perfect harmony of flavors and sheer drinkability. This went down easy and left me wanting more. Most definitely worth seeking out to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I actually enjoyed this more than KBS. Heresy, I know :)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer. I find this equal to or better than Half Acre's barrel aged Over Ale but since they do not bottle it makes it difficult to compare and contrast. The brewer and whoever runs the barrel aging program at Central Waters deserve honors for world class accomplishments. The last barrel aged beer I tried from Central Waters was awesome and this one was equally enjoyable. A barrel aged dark beer lovers dream come true. An unbelievable value. A Grand Slam again CW."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a badass beer."
""
"quick note: there are rumors of infections in this beer. Some of them I've had have been sour."
"This is a great beer! I plan to store a couple bottles for next year. Being from WI, I will have no problem purchasing the next release and I look forward to doing comparisons between the two ages. Definitely recommend!!!"

"still very good considering the sourness, soooo hard to find a coffee bourbon stout - the best of both worlds, i dont think anything will ever beat goose island thoe!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A very unique coffee profile. Its not the best BA coffee stout, but it is enjoyable in its own right. Been wanting to try this for some time now, thank you Kyle!"
""
""
""
"Poured into a snifter this beer is black with some brown highlights and hints of a tan head that quickly recedes into the blackness of this brew. Aromas of bourbon and oak hit you first with a fairly high level of dark roast coffee also present. Taste is like the aroma, dark roasted malts with plenty of oaky bourbon with a slight vanilla quality. A weaker body than some of the other big BB stouts but at this lower alcohol level that is not unexpected. A fairly high alcohol burn for this alcohol level. Higher carbonation zing than most of the style. I prefer this over most beers from CW but it would benefit from either a higher alcohol content or less burn."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A pretty good beer though I had better."
"Overall, especially impressive beer for how much it costs. As the first CW beer I've had, I'll definitely be sampling more of their drinks."
""
"O: Yeah, this is a very good to great single stout, which it is. It's not an Imperial stout, but it's still pretty damn good. Have to respect a BA beer that tastes like bourbon, but where bourbon isn't the only thing you taste. As for any infection: no, not in this bottle."
""
"This is a very nice BA stout with lots of oak, vanilla, and chocolate, but not as much coffee as I expected. It's a great, very drinkable beer, but a bit sweeter than I'd like."
"Aging could very well improve it."
"O. This is a great Imperial Stout with great balance and a drinkability that means you can have two."

"Central Waters Peruvian Morning Brand Stout ---4.5/5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Nice complex beer, definitely above average for the style. The tartness at the end seems a little out of place though."
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Nice hue, decent lacing. Nose is really good combination of malt, and bittersweet components. Flavor is roasted coffee and grape leaf with sweet components. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Amazing. Certainly better than last years version, which is really saying something."
""
""
""
"One of my favorites, from one of the more under rated breweries in the world. Taste follows nose and great flavors or Coffee, Bourbon and Chocolate meld together beautifully. I keep reading the comparisons to KBS and Peruvian being referred to as a smaller version of KBS, but I would pick this over KBS, especially at half the price."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is my first Central Water's beer and it's a damn good one. I've never tried KBS, but if this is a poor man's version of it (as I've heard it described) then I'm even more excited to get my hands on the real thing"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: KBS-lite? It's a great beer with a great coffee presence, but could use more bourbon and more body to really take it over the edge."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Top notch ba stout. Although many times the motor oil-thick stout is very appealing, I like that this one is a little more easy drinking but still packs a ton of flavor. Makes me not feel the need to chase any kbs down (although now I want to track a couple fresh ones down and do a side by side)."
""
""
"O - It was immediately apparent that this was not your typical stout. Tart, lactic flavors dominate giving this a unique blend of sour and roasty coffee. I drank about half before I did a little research and noticed that this batch had some unintended flavors. The brewery recognized the problem and established a voluntary recall, but I'll hold on to my other bottle. It isn't everyday you get to try a sour, barrel aged stout. I will seek out another batch to try the real thing, but this was interesting enough to not disappoint."
"Fantastic offering from Central Waters. Tops last year's in every way. Pours thick and slick w a sandy one-finger head that retains well. Aroma is redolent w coffee and bourbon, hints of baker's chocolate and vanilla as well. Taste follows the nose almost perfectly, vanilla less present. Silky and creamy on the palate, boozy in a pleasantly warming way."
""
""
""
"O: great morning beer verdict A"
""
""
"Overall - I'm pretty happy with this beer and think it has a near perfect mix of coffee and bourbon flavor. I was hesitant on buying this since I wasn't a big fan of last years batch but I am definitely happy that I picked this one up. I will be buying a few more four packs and will be aging at least one of the four packs."
""
"O/. Very solid. IMO crushes 2012. 2012 had a small metallic type taste in the bottles I had, maybe just bad luck. Will be purchasing more..."
""
"Final Thoughts: I'm not a huge fan of using coffee in beers as it tends to thin out the end result, but the use of bourbon barrel oak aging more than made of up the slight lack of body. This was my first Central Waters offering and they've done a fine job because I plan on exploring more of their full lineup. If BCBS is the king of bourbon barrel aged beers then I'd have to say Peruvian Morning is the younger and less refined prince. Would I drink it again? Yes, got a stash in the cellar."
""
""
"Notes: Solid bourbon, coffee beer. There is a slight heat, subtle bitterness of coffee, and the flavors don't meld. Despite that, the beer ends up working. The flavors don't clash and stand well on their own bottom. Solid beer that is a nice little treat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is mesmerizing when you're in to mood for something assertive, bold, and complex."
""
"O - This is one of my new favorites and I will look for it everywhere I go."
""
"Had this been thicker, I would've put this up there with BCBCS. A splendid quaff that is, IMO, up there with best in class. One would have to do a double take to make sure this wasn't KBS. If you see it, pull the trigger."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall an amazing brew. Something I will seek out every time."
"O: Excellent BA stout. I've had stouts that have stronger individual components, but this melds flavors really well. I love how subtle the coffee is, yet it is present throughout the entire flavor profile. Really well done. My favorite from central waters. Hope to try BCBCS someday, but until then, this does nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An under-rated beer, as many recent reviews have said. I think of it as a smaller version of Bourbon County Coffee Stout, but still very flavorful."
""
""
"O - Love that the bourbon does not dominate this beer. The south american coffee is front and center and tastes wonderful. The carbonation is right on but I felt the mouth was a bit thin and not as frothy as I'd hoped. CW fixes the mouth I think they have a world class stout- its that good."
""
"O: This is very impressive. Great drinkability. Pretty damn close to KBS and about $7 cheaper. Not sure what other years taste like since this is the first time I've had it, but if other years were like this, this is very underrated."
""
""
""
"O- Simply put...Fantastic! A fantastic sipper. The flavors are beautifully melded together into a delicious breakfast stout! Holds true to a theme I'm finding with CW...they know how to do their bourbon barrel offerings!"
""
"Edit: I had this same beer with 2 months of age and it was sour/infected. - so I docked to overall score from 4.25 to 2 : ("
""
""
"O: Outstanding. A great BA breakfast stout. Coffee is not dominating, but very fresh and noticeable."
""
""
"This really hits the mark. Not too much of each flavor but an enjoyable sipper that really makes you appreciate the melding of the various flavors. Nicely done."
"Overall: I'm a fan! Glad to have gotten to try a fresh, non-infected version of this beer. I will sit on the other bottle I have for a year and see if the barrel characters blend a little better, but this is pretty great without any aging and highly recommended fresh."
"2013 vintage. Pours a very dark brown-black color with a small tan head that diminishes quickly. Scent is straight coffee forward at first. Tons of fresh ground coffee with sweet bourbon and chocolate notes. Lovely oak and vanilla as well. Taste is just as it smells, and just what I was hoping for. All the great coffee flavors are there that were present in the nose. Reminds me of fresh KBS in a way. Fresh coffee with balanced out bourbon flavors. Sweet vanilla, milk chocolate, and just a hint of toffee and caramel. Roasted malt and roasted coffee. Mouthfeel is medium bodied...could be a little more thick. Booziness is appropriate here, not overwhelming. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a wonderful barrel aged offering from CW. Much better than the bourbon cherry stout IMO. Great beer for coffee lovers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Damn, again tonight. This is a big beer. The aroma is of a coffee-infused barley wine. Too bad for the metallic tartness. Otherwise, the booziness combines wtih the roasted malt to create a great night capper. (I don't think I could drink another one, is what I mean.) I wish the alcohol were more subtle. The coffee is overwhelmed by the mouth-puckering booziness. Still pretty wonderful, though."
""
""
""
"O: This is a fantastic brew from CW that is only outshined by 1414 and 15 (2012 BBS is damn close). I really wish I would've brought a Uhaul to the anny party to stock up for the rest of my life. This is the seond best coffee stout I have ever had next to FBS. Do seek this brew out if you ever have a chance!"
"This is a medium bodied offering with a moderate amount of carbonation. It is a very nice barrel aged stout with perhaps a coffee inclusion that is seemingly lost behind the bold barrel presence. Overall, this is a pretty solid brew. I was very happy to find no off characteristics or signs of infection despite previous reviews stating the brew's demise. Nicely done, would drink again."
""
"Overall- Superb barrel agee coffee stout. The balance of sweet and bitter is almost perfect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Was hoping it wasn't infected and had high hopes based off the aroma, but the flavor was just off."
""
"I have had some great beers from Central Waters, but this isn't one of them. I will be on the lookout for any previous releases, or future releases. But in general I will completely avoid any 2012 bottle, especially at $5 a 12 oz. bottle."
""
""
""
""
"I will find something else to drink tonight."
""
"OVERALL: The only other Central Waters offerings I have had have been incredible. This is clearly a beer that set out to be amazing, and elements of greatness are there, but I think it is only fair to review it as I had it. After all, the brewery let it out there and people should know what they’re dealing with when deciding to purchase, or trade for, this beer."
"Post-pour: Sofa! Sofa, so good. No fountaining or other signs of untoward madness. Instead, a cap of dense, rocky deep-tan has formed with excellent retention. Color is a deep dark-brown with caramel highlights. I definitely get the coffee on the nose along with vanilla or coconut from the bourbon. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full and the bourbon was the initial taste on my tongue, followed by the coffee roastiness. Finish was initially somewhat hot, perhaps a construct of the bourbon, but once that faded, I got a nice combination of coffee and bourbon. I am now inspired to put a dollop into my coffee later this AM. I may need a nap after this, however."
""
"Overall this beer delivers as advertised. Lots of roasted coffee flavors complemented by the barrel characteristics. The lower ABV for the style improves drinkability and helps the coffee aromas and flavors to ""pop"" more than a bigger beer would. Great after dinner/winter beer for sure."
""
""
"Overall, this is one of my favorites, and I'm glad I took the time to review it. It's been a while for me with reviews, and I'd set this one aside until I had the time. I could sip this all evening (granted, it's a winter evening...in Montana). This is one of the greatest Central Waters brews I've had, and a great reminder of why they remain one of my favorite breweries despite being painfully inaccessible where I live."
"D: finding this one a little too one-note, especially considering the note isnt exactly the best flavor out there. the astringency of the bourbon isnt enjoyable and is rather disappointing. it also could be infected which is a real bummer cause i was looking forward to this bottle. bummmed."
""
"D - A very enjoyable brew that did not disappoint... A potent mix of coffee and bourbon are both the dominate players and highlights of this brew... I can whole-heartly recommend and would gladly indulge in again..."
"January 2012 Vintage, poured into a snifter. Pours a dark brown with hints of blood red, relatively thin medium tan head. Smells fantastic -- bourbon, vanilla, molasses, malt. Bourbon and vanilla probably most prominent, with slight hints of fruit. Taste is similar, with bourbon and vanilla coming through strongest, nice hints of oak and coffee. Mouthfeel is a little fizzy, but smooth, somewhat bitter on the end. Overall this is a great beer. Still, there are other Bourbon beers I enjoy more, but my bottle does not seem to be infected, and I'd like to grab another bottle for aging purposes, cheers."
""
"but it is overall an good brew"
""
""
""
""
"Splitting a bottle with my man VDubb whilst enjoying some Ninja Turtles action from our youth. This stuff pours a deep black-brown topped by a finger or so of tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, light whiskey, hazelnut, coffee, and molasses. The taste brings in more of the same, though the roast is a bit stronger (or it just blended more seamlessly with the coffee) and the tangible booze character is decidedly more pronounced, though not enough to warn me away with any success. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda dry-ish finish. Overall, a damn fine stout, the perfect combatant to the chilling weather and the sadness I felt in CW's normal coffee stout."

"Overall. Well, as I was warned it might be, this bottle is indeed infected. It's actually not bad tasting, but the sour and coffee don't really work well together. Still smells great."
""
""
""
"O: definitely a damn good beer and was really excited to try this one. good lookin out beezler for bringing this one down playa."
"This poured out as a very nice looking deep black color, there was a nice thin head on top until the first sip killed it off. The lacing is very subtle. The smell of the beer gives off some wood aged bourbon-like aromas. I also pick up some fruit in there and vanilla. The taste of the beer gives off more barrel flavors some subtle coffee and chocolate and hints of vanilla in there too. It's also sweet. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy on the carbonation and thin feeling. Overall it's still a really nice beer to say the least. It's worth trying if you come across it."

"Had this back to back with an Atwater Block VJ Black, and don't kill me, but I definitely liked the latter better. PM poured a dark brown-black with a small wispy beige head, minimal retention and lacing. Nose is heavy with woody oak, roasty dark malts, coffee. Lots of roast in the taste, dark malts, coffee, bakers' chocolate, oak, burnt oatmeal raisin cookie. Didn't pick up very much bourbon at all here, maybe just trace amounts. Still a tasty beer overall. Medium-heavy body, fairly smooth for the most part, but just on the border of being too roasty/burnt."

"Peruvian Morning (2011), pours a black color with a lacy small tan head. There is a roasted coffee aroma, that is creamy and has some vanilla hints. There is a strong creamy coffee flavor, that is a little heavy with alcohol. Good full flavor, warm on the palette. Overall another good black beer from Central Waters, diffidently worth a try. The creamy coffee flavors make it unique and very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O- I really enjoyed this stout. The coffee flavor held up very well even though it was brewed in January (8 months ago). All the flavors were very well balanced- there was a nice bourbon quality which didn't dominate the beer too much and was balanced with nice chocolate/espresso qualities. I would definitely like to try this beer again, maybe a little bit fresher next time."

"Overall: Really glad I got this one, and will be seeking it out again. The best coffee based beer I've had to date."

"A nice bourbon barrel aged stout, but lacks some fullness that would put this in the upper ranks. Good barrel aging flavor, dry, roast, coffee, vanilla. Tasty stout."

"Ah ok but nothing out of the ballpark. I was looking for a little bit heavier of a coffee beer but was somewhat let down."
"EDIT: just need to add kudos to Central Waters for putting their various barrel aged beers in 12oz bottles. I can actually drink an entire bourbon barrel stout when I'm on my own without getting ridiculously drunk and still have a bit of leeway. I cant say the same about Bramble or BCBCS, both of which I drank solo and felt the worse for wear."
""
""
""
"Overall, nothing bad to say about this beer at all."
""
""
"This can’t be that far off from the real Peruvian Morning. It tastes like a well-crafted barrel-aged stout, like a KBS Lite. The nose is exceptional. The body, well, is a little half-assed. I want to give this another try, and wouldn’t mind doing it with another of the same vintage. Still a plus beer. Excited to try two other barrel-aged Central Waters offerings that I own."
""
""
""
"EDIT: Drinking a 2014 now and it's pretty awful. There's a tartness in there and it's a touch hotter than it should be at this ABV. Really light in color and thin body too. Would score it a 2 at best."
"Theres so much going on, it melds together a bit. i would love to see a bit more balance and more coffee flavor. its sweet and bitter, which isnt really what I expected. I like how those flavors feel and finish, but the taste could use some work."
""
""
"O: Enjoyable, but nothing that is considered top notch. Had this bottle with the bourbon barrel and this wasn't nearly as good."
"I don't taste any signs of obvious infection, even though the brewery issued a statement on this beer (that I didn't see until after I bought). I just wasn't that impressed, as it's just too thin for a stout."
"Medium body and mildly carbonated, prickly on the tongue. Fairly easy to drink but a bit astringent for me."
""
""
"O: Overall, I have to stress that the brett character is thee most subtle I've ever experienced in an [brett] infected beer. I do enjoy this for what it is, but not what it's supposed to be. I love you Central Waters, sorry I had to review this beer."
"O - a great KBS alternative price-wise and availability but I would like to try a bottle from another batch to compare"

"O- A really nice coffee stout, has held up really well since I first tried some in February."
"Well worth a try, tasty and complex. The weak body is a serious drawback though."
""
"Bottle generously shared by popery. Thanks David. Pours a dark brown with a small tan head that settles to a ring. The aroma is big roasted coffee with a decent amount of bourbon, some vanilla, and a hint of coconut. The the taste is slightly sweet with lots of roasted coffee, a bit of nuttiness, and some bourbon. The finish has more coffee with a bit of nuttiness. Very thin mouthfeel for a stout. Low carbonation. This wasn't bad, but it reminded me more of something like cuban espresso brown ale or coffee bender with some bourbon more than an imperial stout."
""
""
"O-- Too much of an artificial sweet cherry and vanilla feel to this that brings it down. Good coffee nose and feel but the cherry infused bourbon is a bit odd and offsets the good parts of the coffee. No sour notes at all but do think this infected."
"O: I enjoyed this but I thought this could have been much better."
"O - Overall, I was really looking forward to this one, but the dark fruits really muddled it up for me."
"This beer is Central Waters’ 10th Anniversary Imperial Stout infused with Peruvian coffee and aged in a bourbon barrel. Acquired this beer as an extra in a trade. Poured from 12oz bottle into a snifter glass. Pours coffee black with a thin off-white head with decent lacing that lasts throughout. Aromas of coffee and some more coffee. Reminds me of my dad’s black coffee running in the morning. Taste is roasted malt, coffee, oak, and bourbon. Low carbonation and medium bodied. Overall, a very nice and mellow beer that I wouldn’t mind having every morning in lieu of regular coffee seeing that I’m not big on coffee."
""
""
"O: Damn, what a beer. Strikes a really nice balance between the stout, coffee, and bourbon, and quite drinkable as well."
"Re-rated after having the 2013 vintage, bottle thanks to Jon Graham. Fantastic bourbon character, nice coffee notes and great integration of the barrel. 45/45/45/425/45"
""
"Overall I had high hopes for this one but was let down. I tried a friends home brewed stout last week that tasted a lot like this. My friend added oak chips, that he charred and let soak in a mason jar with Makers Mark for a month, to the underlying stout. I wasn't impressed with his attempt either but he's no pro. I'm Just sayin'. Thank you so much to injuredreserve for giving me this bottle. I would love to give this one some time and maybe it changes for the better."
"O: Well, I don't really know how I feel about this one. For 8.5% it's easy drinking. The lactose qualities really take over the coffee characteristics, but the major fault appears to be the barrel aging. Central Waters did a decent job but it's just not adding that extra dimension. This is kind of underwhelming for a barrel aged beer."
""
""
"Drink- I was so excited to get this and then I wasnt too excited when I drank it. Oh well, shit happens."

"Pours dark brown. A bit too dark to see through. Beige head. Film of fine bubbles. Aroma is pretty sweet. Lots of caramel and sweet chocolate. A little coffee but less than expected. some nice barrel character. Good vanilla. A little green pepper. Taste is a bit simple. Sweet caramel with some chocolate. Smooth mouthfeel. A lot better than the previous version that I tried."
"Overall I really do like the taste of this brew, but it's lacking a lot of depth I think for it's style. I really do like this fruit deep red berry character I am getting on this."

"Fairly solid beer, but nothing spectacular. It's a little one note towards coffee, but still enjoyable."
""
""
"Pours a dark reddish-brown with a thin white head. Much lighter than your average stout. Smell is heavy on the coffee with a bit of oak hiding in the background. Flavor isn't quite what I expected: the coffee comes through in a very acidic way which throws things off a bit. The mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style, doesn't support this beer very well. Overall, this beer doesn't quite live up to expectations. It's very thin and acidic for something that's supposed to be an imperial stout. That said, it's certainly not bad, just not worth seeking out."
""

"2012, 12oz, bottled in January. Pours near black with a thin beige head that is quick to dissipate. Trace lacing on the glass. Aromas are boozy bourbon, roasty, chocolate, and coffee. Tastes are coffee, bourbon, roasted malt, dark chocolate, very boozy with a peppery prickle on the finish. When cold, the coffee really stands out, but as it warms the bourbon takes center stage and really dominates the palate. Mouth is on the thinner side of full bodied, and slightly gritty or chalky. Overall, I enjoyed this one, but feel compelled to compare it to a certain counterpart that I haven't had in awhile, that being KBS. Either way, this was worth the try."
"O: Did not live up to the hype for me. The age might have done this one in a bit. Need to try it fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a near pitch black with firm, dense cap of mocha froth, good retention and lacing. Scent is dominated by strong, heavy roasted espresso beans, fresh brewed espresso, fresh scraped vanilla bean, bitter baking chocolate and fudge, bourbon notes hint at alcohol, some dark stone fruit. Taste follows suit, big coffee notes, both bean and brewed, big vanilla - not sure whats from the wood vs. any bean or extract, nice bitter fudge like chocolate, subtle fruit, some bourbon for character but not to overpower, light creamy sweetness. Full bodied, silky smooth and lightly creamy. Overall, fantastic find on draft and something I could have had multiple pours of if not for the late hour. A big recommend."
"O: A very rich and enjoyable coffee stout. Coffee flavors are natural and the bourbon mixes well. Thanks a ton, jbck109!"
"This beer pours a medium bodied dark cola brown with only a slight lacing around my snifter. The nose is dark sweet malt, slight coffee, and a good amount of bourbon barrel with plenty of vanilla sweetness. There definitely isn't as much coffee as I anticipated. The flavors are of sweet dark malts, cola, vanilla, and light bourbon. There is little to no coffee and it finishes pretty watery. It's also a little over carbonated. It drinks medium in body and leaves a slight bourbon barrel vanilla in the after taste. I don't like how light this is, like their bourbon barrel stout. It's odd and over carbonated. Also, where's the coffee? I consider this beer to be pretty average and wouldn't buy it if I saw it. The mouthfeel is just too light and I really wish it at least looked like a stout."
""
"Thanks to Duff27 for this one!"
""
""
"O= I'm a little disapointed to tell you the truth. I've heard a ton about this beer. It was a little bit of a let down. A solid coffee and broubon beer but the stout itself doesn't impress much. Boost the beer flavor while keeping the coffee and bourbon the same."

"All in all, a good bourbon aged stout that is a great value for what it is. I just need some more coffee in there. Perhaps I'll try another bottle and give it another go."
""
""
"Overall - Good stuff. No substitute for KBS, but the coffee character impresses me a tremendous amount. I question how well this will age based on the tangy smell I'm detecting back there. It's also a bit light to age for a really long time."
"O: Very cool beer. Tasty now and I look forward to the effects time has on it. I've had some other coffee bourbon barrel beers that are abrasive or just taste burnt. Not here. Central Waters is getting damn good with their barrels."
"Better then Central Water's BB Stout, but merely above average at best."

"The stout pours a very dark brown bordering on black in my snifter with a quickly diminishing moderate tan head. The aroma is a wonderfully complex blend of coffee, bittersweet chocolate, oak, and bourbon; a very inviting nose. The flavor is roasty and boozy coffee, with bittersweet chocolate. The finish is slightly warming, silky smooth, and with an reemergence of bourbon. Delicious. The mouthfeel is velvety smooth, medium-full with medium-low carbonation. Overall a 4-pack of beer you cannot be disappointed with, a very good stout."
""
"O: This is a really good beer that I am thrilled to be able to try. If this was available to me, I would likely by this semi-regularly. I would not look to this if I was dead set on having an imperial stout because it is not very true to the style. However, that doesn't take away from how good this beer is. Certainly interested in trying more from Central Waters."
""
"Would def recommend."

"Overall, an enjoyable beer. Would be a good dessert pairing due to the sweetness - maybe creme brulee or a flourless chocolate torte. CW is really stepping it up recently with this one, the Bourbon Barrel Stout, and BBBW."
""
"Overall this is a coffee lovers dream beer. Fresh and robust all around. A real nice beer."
"O - a very rich and intricately flavored stout.. just plain ol' amazing. sugary sweet with a lot of bourbon profile which were subtle fresh, but after a year of aging are more present. i recommend picking up a couple bottles fresh, and letting a few age for a year just to compare."

"D - Not bad, undeniably better than the Bourbon Barrel Stout that I tried a month or so go."
"O: excellent beer. It was just decent until I tasted the woody or earthy flavor. That just made the beer for me. So glad to have found a couple of these in a store today."
""
""
"O: I'm almost on the fence with this. It's good. I'd love to cellar a couple of these. Man, I like it, I don't love it, but I like it. My ratings are all over for this one. It's so perplexing - like a hot step-sister. 3/5/4/2/4-3.93"
"O: This is a big boy coffee stout. It has a ton flavors milling about - the nose is excellent yet the flavor leaves just a little something to be desired."
"Got this in a recent trade but can't remember who sent it, thanks! Dark black, standard stout appearance. Smells like coffee, rich stout, malts, good. Flavor was a little booze a lot of coffee, very rich and full flavored. Much better than the Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Stout I had in the same sitting. I'd love to get another bottle of this at some point, good stuff."
""
"Agreed it needs a little more carbonation to improve mouthfeel. Otherwise, enjoy this beer for its flavors. The vanilla is the main player up front with a nice barrel age on the back. I need to get to this brewery. I said a bang, bang, banggity, bang, I said a bang bang banggity banggity bang"
"O- I've had this once before, but it was about 6 months old at the time and I felt like it could be better if I got it fresher. This is a damn fine barrel-stout, but falls a bit short of top-tier for me due to the watery feel."
"More please."
""
""
"O This beer just isn't my style, its all coffee and lacks ballance in my opinion. If you like a coffee stout that is very coffee forward you would probably like this, but its not for me."

"O/D- This is nicely balanced in my opinion, and a wonderful start to porch beer season. Highly recommended. Thanks to duff27 for picking this up for me when I couldn't make the trip, you da best."
""

"This beer pours an opaque dark brown color. The head is a half inch of tan foam that recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is very nice balance of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, roasted malt, and graham cracker. Very mouthwatering. I could smell this beer all day long. The taste is similar to the aroma in that there is a lot of complexity with many different parts intermingling with each other. The malty chocolate and vanilla flavors come through first with a creamy coffee presence in the finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and a silky texture. Overall, this is a very well crafted beer. A great beer in fact. I would drink this beer daily if it were available for me to do so."
""
""
"Overall: A very good take on a coffee forward barrel aged stout. The barrel elements mix in very nicely."
"O - I'm not sure if I think it really fits well into the style. However, it is a very good beer. The coffee is very present but great. The barrel really adds to the finish. The problems I have lie in the appearance and overall body of the beer. I'd actually feel that this really just pushes the brink of a Stout and doesn't really qualify as a Double Stout. That said, I'd buy this if it were available locally. No question."
""
""
"O: A very enjoyable offering from CW. They have nailed alsmost everything except the body and a bit more flavor. As with other CW Stouts, including Satin Solstice and Brewers Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout, this stout needs a bit more backbone to push it from the very good to great."

" work, but really this was very good . I would gladly recommend."
"Overall : I must say I am throughly impressed by this beer. Its hot huge flavor and and bold aromas. Highly recommend this beer to any who enjoys big stouts."

"This aroma is heavenly, burst from the bottle. Boozy caramel and toffee blended with oily coffee beans. Very reminiscent of Big Hugs on the nose. A surprising level of clarity. Pours like a fresh pokal of Sumatra with very little head. Goddamn is that smell terrific. The taste - I don’t even know how to describe this. It’s so perfect. Really a brilliant combination of smoky caramel and light chocolate with fresh, fresh coffee beans. They’ve achieved a truly perfect balance here. Mouthfeel could be amped up a bit but that’s my one and only critique. This beer is otherwise flawless in my book. Extremely well done. This is a definite must-try!"
""
"O: The flavors were nice, but a little unbalanced and the body was too thin for an imperial stout, even a barrel aged one."
""
"O - We had the Bourbon Péché Mortel right before this, which was probably a mistake. This isn't even anywhere in the ballpark compared to that beer, but is nice on its own. It really doesn't drink like an Imperial Stout, IMO. Nice, not world-class or anything."
""
""
""
"Poured into a snifter, dark brown almost black. No foam, a very fine ring around the edge with some light lacing. Smell is roasted malt, coffee and chocolate. The taste is roasted malt and coffee, a little peppery in the middle, and a chocolate finish. As it warms the bourbon becomes more noticeable. Medium mouthfeel with good carbonation. Overall a good beer with great taste. Very easy to drink considering the size."
""
"This is a fantastic beer and as I stated already, the coffee is done perfectly in this one. Bravo."
"Overall, this is a standout beer. The aroma is wonderful, and the flavor, as mentioned, is so well balanced and well rounded. The mouthfeel is the one detractor, but the aroma and taste are so well done, that I can allow myself to see past this, and perhaps even enjoy its lightness. You would be doing yourself a disservice if you didnt allow this one to come down in temperature. I want to say its a sipper, but its too damn good to just sip. Luckily I have another."

""
""
"Overall – A very good beer from CW. I had the BBBW right before this and enjoyed that beer as well. I need to find a couple more pronto."
""
""
"O- A very good beer especially if you like whiskey/bourbon. You can tell the folks over at central waters put a good amount of work into this little-known Wisconsin gem. Unfortunately I was slightly disappointed by this beer. I had heard quite a few good things about how phenomenal this brew was, which unfortunately made it so that this brew had some very high expectations to live up to right to from the get-go. I definitely did enjoy it though. I found it to be incredibly flavorful and very rich. I had a few of these the night I tried it with some other beers in between and non of them were able to hold up in flavor to this imperial stout. I noticed that for the majority, the coffee flavor becomes less noticeable after you have been sipping it for a while. An awesome brew that every Wisconsin beer geek should try. Unfortunately the price makes it so that I probably wont be purchasing this beer again."
""
"O- I love the scent and the taste. Making this beer a little thicker would do wonders for it on the whole"
"O. A very good beer. Very complex, with lots of flavors. A nice smooth non-hot beer for how fresh it is. A year or two on this and it could be truly amazing."
"Overall, i was pretty impressed with this beer. I enjoyed the balance between scents and flavors. Well done."
"O/D - I'm a bourbon fan and I typically dig bourbon barrel aged beers, but this one doesn't quite do it for me. It's hot with booze, and has some interesting bitter notes. I'm going to cellar my other three bottles in the hope that the heat will decline a bt."
"O - Great beer, and can't wait to try it with some age on it, although I don't know if it will help the coffee flavors. Central Waters impresses me again."

"CHEERS! Beertracker"
""
""
""
"Really a good tasty beer that is just a bit off on body. Central Waters is now back in my good graces. Don't you guys feel lucky?"
"O: This is a good offering by CW. It not only balanced, but it also balances CW bourbon barrel line up. I would say it’s my least favorite of CW BB. However, considering CW talent regarding BB, last is still MUCH better than most and maybe the most powerful statement is that I could drink this 365."

"O - I missed out on last years version, and don't remember two years ago being this good. Actually more well-balanced than the Bourbon Barrel Stout (although still a great beer...), this vintage of Peruvian Morning is definitely one to grab a 4-pack of if possible."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my 10oz. Cigar City snifter. Pours a jet black hue with the thinnest head imaginable, despite a vigorous pour from nearly 5"" over the glass, straight down the middle. The nose on this is lovely. A sweet coffee with some vanilla and barrel tones. This is probably one of the finest coffee stouts I've ever had. Truly f'ing marvelous. The taste is again coffee laced with vanilla and some bourbon. The coffee aspect is neither acidic nor overpowering. It's the most perfect application of coffee I've had in a stout. The mouth isn't the richest or creamiest, but it leaves a nice warming sensation in the mouth without feeling like an alcohol type burn. The coffee lingers without being bitter on the finish. Overall, this is one damn fine coffee stout. I want more. Now."
""
"Infected! Too sour to drink. Disgusting. Purchased three four packs of this stuff,and every bottle was infected. If I ever get hold of a non-infected example,I will be sure to re-review,but as it stands,the beer I've had both last year(2012) and this year(2013) have been repulsive."
"Quite chocolatey, like Hershey's syrup. Bourbon influence still there, but no coffee. Tasty, and no sign of oxidation. Happy and surprised that this has held up for so long."

"Overall - This is the best so far of the Central Waters 2012 speciality beers. I will be purchasing a couple more if there is any left."
"(I had this beer cellared since March of '09 at a temp of 55 to 65 degrees.)"
"Overall: Nice Bourbon Barrel aged Imperial Stout with coffee. There are certainly better ones out there (Goose Island BCBCS, Founders KBS), but this is a great deal for the price at roughly half of the others."
""
"D/O- The lack of head right off the bat was disappointing but other than that, a solid coffee stout. Believe it or not my favorite aspect of this Central Waters offering is the sweetness and how it compliments the coffee's boldness. Recommended."
"O: My favorite of the 3 recent CW bourbon barrel releases, including Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout, Bourbon Barrel Barleywine and this, Peruvian Morning. Seems most balanced and very drinkable now -- I'll be interested in tastings over subsequent weeks and months."
""
""
"O- Really enjoyable, really enjoyed the coffee notes balanced with the bourbon, really easy drinkability, a little too rich but nothing to take away from the beer."
"Arguebly not as good as Goose Island BCBCS, but since that beer is almost impossible to buy now, this is a very worthy substitute at a better price."
"Overall, much better than I expected. Even with the high ratings I thought this might be too boozy or the coffee flavor might be too strong, niether were the case. This is a very balanced beer. The blend of flavors are outstanding, no one flavor overpowers the other. This is maybe the most balanced bourbon barrel aged imperial stout I've had. Shockingly drinkable."
""
"Smell is some definate coffee, some chocolate, some vanilla, roasted grains, and a slight bit of hops to balance the sweetness off although it is a tad sweet smelling. Smells really chocolatey too me which is nice. Definately some vanilla from the barrels too. Taste is a REALLY nice mix of a little coffee, vanilla, and chocolate. Almost a perfect balance. I already wish I bought more. Really, really good. Mouthfeel is nice and thick for the style. What a great beer. Starting to get to the point of GI BCBS in taste. Not really there but for the price and availability this is under the radar."
"Bill"
"O- Great beer, wasn't so sure at first but as the flavors mixed in my mouth i really liked the beer. Great sweetness with nice coffee and bourbon undertones."
"Bottle. 2012. Poured into a tulip glass a dark brown color with a light tan colored head. Coffee is the upfront dominant note but is then balanced with a nice, earthy oaky aroma. Dark chocolate as well. Medium mouthfeel, velvety. The dark roast coffee flavor again takes center stage but is not overbearing. The coffee is then backed by a nice dark chocolate note that then transitions to a slight bourbon flavor. The alcohol is there but isn’t ""hot"". A nice beer."
"Only subjective comment on this brew is that i think there could be a tad more coffee added to better balance the bourbon/vanilla flavors. This is completely subjective based on what flavors i value more prominently in a beer."
"O: A pleasant drinking experience. Extremely easy drinking. Excellent display of barrel aging finess. The bourbon doesn't dominate the flavor, but gives it a nice sweetness. The coffee is really the only flavor that lacks a little here. I remember liking this one more in the past."
""
"O: Hold onto this stuff and Journey!"
"Wow what a beer. If you get Central Waters go grab some of this it is worth it."
"This is a really good beer. Excellent integration of the various pieces, and they add up to more than the sum of the parts. Smooth, rich, and just delicious. I also love that they sell it in 12 oz. bottles, so I can actually drink one solo."
""
"O- very good BA coffee stout! I have had a year old bottle and it tasted a bit sour almost, not infected sour, but just off. Think this is a beer best drank fresh, so drink'em if you got'em."
""
""
"O-This is one of the best coffee beers available, i believe. I rank it up there with Great Divide's Espresso Yeti and Bell's Java Stout. The base stout isn't quite as delicious as Yeti, but they nail the coffee element in this one. Not over the top, but its there and tastes like fresh,boutique coffee. Not stale, like someone poured a cold, gross cup of Starbucks into your stout, yuck. Let it warm to nearly room temp for pure espresso, bourbon, and rich vanilla flavors. Yum."
""
"Cost: $11.99 for a four pack."
"One thing that always slightly downgraded the Coffeehouse Stout was just a slight watery aftertaste. Not only does the Peruvian Morning eliminate that but it hits you with a Bourbon aftertaste from the barrels that it was aged in. This brewery is far and away my favorite!"

"Thanks Adam, this is a great beer! I look forward to getting to know Central Waters better, and getting some more Perevian Morning in particular. i think I tasted it (and about 40 other awesome Imperial Stouts) at Darkness Day, but it was hard to appreciate the complexity and nuance in that context. This is a fantastic beer, and it's kinda nice that it is not too big (in comparison to some others) at just 8.5%."

"D:  This beer was a wonderful experience. It brought back some great memories of my grandmother's delicious chocolate cake. I highly recommend this beer!  4/5"

"O: Good, but less than I was hoping for. I love RIS, coffee infused, and bourbon barrel aged, but this was a little light in my opinion. The coffee was a nice flavor note, but it dominates the palate, leaving just mild flavor note integration with the rest of the beer ingredients."
"A decent offering, but I think I was expecting more. Regardless, I'm still grateful to have tried it."
"Overall-- this is the best CW stout I've had...  It still doesn't totally blow my mind, but I do like the coffee and whiskey notes.  4"
"I got this in the Secret Halloween BIF, thanks Michael. The pour is opaque black with a thin white head, nice lacing. The smell is a mix of coffee, vanilla, bourbon, and oak. The flavors meld well together, lots of coffee. The oak, vanilla, and bourbon are nice complements, lingering coffee finish. It is a bit thin for an imperial stout, good carbonation, the 8.5% abv is barely detectactable. A great coffee stout, this version was 2001, and I have to seek out more!!"
"A beer that I imagine is wonderful fresh, this has not held up well. I'm not quite sure what happened, given that this particular bottle wasn't terribly old. I'll hold out for a new sample in the future."
"O - Another solid beer from Central Waters. I wish I had tried this fresh. Definitely worth seeking out."
"Overall pretty good, would be better fresher I bet with the fresh coffee that probably died off a bit in the 9-10 months since. Despite the booze, a bit of acrid burnt grinds flavor, and some acidity, it's still a nice dark roasty chocolate stout."
"Pours a darkish brown color. Aroma of chocolate and coffee. Taste is chocolate right away followed by coffee and a little bit of vanilla with a slight alcohol burn at the end. The beer is thin for a stout, but still very pleasant to drink. This is a beer definetly worth drinking again."
"O: I really enjoy this beer. It's quite easy to drink, but has very nice flavors. I have had it fresh a few times, and remember it tasting better then. Maybe I'll revisit when the 2012 comes out."
"I didn't expect much out of the beer for whatever reason and I had no idea it was barrel aged. So I say this beer is a success."
"Overall, this was a very tasty stout and a great extra for a trade. The thin body was a low point but the smell and taste of this beer is way too good to let that ruin the beer. Thoroughly enjoyed this brew for sho"
"Full body, decent carbonation, silky smooth and balanced on the tongue. The balance and smoothness on this beer was incredible, making the already delicious profile even better."
"O - Way unique brew! Super glad to have picked this one up in a trade! Can't wait to try this one again!!!"
"O: It really is a balanced heavy hitter of the two flavors. Really happy with the balance the coffee brought this bourbon barrel beer."
"O-Very good beer"
"I would not call this a well balanced beer but the bold, upfront mixture of bourbon and coffee makes me a big fan of this brew. Maybe a little thin but overall a very high quality beer."
"Overall, this was very solid. A very interesting -Bal aged stout that I am glad I tried."
"D: Awesome coffee, too many would be filling, but would not mind starting the mornings out with this."
"O- I would gladly drink more of these. I'll have to acquire more, this shit is sick good."
"Overall this was a very good beer and I enjoyed it more than the base beer – somehow the coffee was more robust even with the time in the barrels. A great beer that’s well worth a shot."
"Had another bottle courtesy of Jon and it was just as good, if not smoother."
"O: I enjoyed the flavors in this one but an Imperial Stout should be darker and have a thicker body. This probably should be a porter but the bottle says stout. I would recommend it if you like CW and coffee beers but I don't plan to search this one out again."
"O: As this one warms, the bourbon becomes more dominant on the nose and the taste becomes more distinct coffee. the interplay between the nose and taste makes for a pleasant drinking experience. I knocked this one down a tad because of the appearance and carbonation. Seems more like a brown ale than a stout. But sets it's self apart form say other stouts like KBS. And at $3.50/bottle I wouldn't hesitate to pick up again. The ABV lingers a bit on the finish. Definitely one to drink now and not sit on. Coffee has held up nicely but the tartness from the barrel might end up being too much and take the beer out of balance."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 1 inch beige head that fades to an oily cap. Random legs of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smells of bourbon, vanilla, wood most prominently with cocoa powder and roasted coffee beans to a lesser extent. Taste is of bourbon, vanilla, wood up front that fades into coffee and cocoa flavors on the finish. There is a slight roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a medium body with a lower carbonation level and a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good stout with nice bourbon aromas and flavors. I am glad I have another one of these in the cellar."
"Had a chance to have one of these waiting in line for Great Taste of the Midwest tickets. The color and aroma are the first things I noticed while pouring. It is a tremendous stout with great coffee aroma and taste. It is higher in abv but not noticed. Great finish and overall a great beer."
"Overall a very nicely done bourbon barrel aged brew."
"I'd buy this one by the case if it were available in my area. Get it if you can!"
"Overall: I would call this good but not spectacular. I enjoy the mix of flavors, but I would have liked a bit more body. I would have another."
"I'd like it to be a bit more bourbon forward, personally. That said though, this is a tasty and easy-to-drink beer. I'd like to drink these on a regular basis."
"O: This is good but not anywhere near what the hype says it to be. The Bourbon Barrel barleywine is far superior when talking about their special release beers."
"O - I was really looking forward to this beer, and for the most part it doesn't disappoint. I'd like to get more bourbon in the flavor, but otherwise while I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way for it, if I see it available I'd definitely grab more."
"Thanks David!"
"""Peruvian Morning 2011"" -- Batch# 0305 on bottom."
"Overall, a complex and intriguing offering from a great brewery. Well worth a try. I would definitely have this again."
"Overall:I'm not that thrilled with this beer, it's a little too harsh, and the coffee flavors, while present, are not as dominant as I would like."
"Overall: Like I had said in the taste section, very similar to KBS, but without the hype. Tough call between this and the Bourbon Barrel Barleywine as my favorite Central Waters beer, but this is really fantastic. Must get more!"
"Overall, this is an enjoyable brew that could probably benefit from some time in the cellar, as the abv could be slightly better hidden, although I like a little bite from time to time."
"This beer pours near black with a moderate cream color head that slowly fades...lacing is moderate,does not denote booziness, a good looking beer. The nose is mainly coffee with a bourbon undertones, was expecting a bit of wood and just cant find it. Nonetheless a very nice smelling beer. Taste is Chocolate, Coffee biterness, not as much bourbon as expected, but a very balanced malt profile. As far as mouthfeel is concerned, It does not meet my preference for a stout of this ilk but is not lacking. It is clear that they did not try to stretch the boundries with this brew, but it is worth seeking out..."
"O- one of the better coffee stouts out there. something im glad i got the chance to try and something that i will be picking up locally as soon as it gets released again. central waters being sold in chicago is definitely a good thing."
"Love it, great coffee-centered brew."
"O- This is light on malt flavor but full on other character that has a nice depth and very drinkable."
"o - overall, this was a solid brew. I'll be honest, if this didn't say bourbon barrel aged on the side of the bottle, I would question if I wasn't making up the bourbon flavors because they are that subtle on my palette. in a world where most barrel aged beers are almost like beer aged bourbons (I know, I know, such a thing doesn't exist, this is merely to paint a picture). the highlight of this beer is the coffee used in my opinion. it is complex and tasty and works really well for my taste buds."
"I am excited to get this in chicago next year, i'll be buying a good amount."
"D: Despite the alcohol content, this is quite drinkable. Not overly balanced, with the main players masking other characteristics to some degree, but very tasty. The slightly thinner bodied that expected aids the drinkability, despite my desire for a little more viscosity. Overall, very enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and the carbonation proper. Overall above average but not even close to the best bourbon barrel aged coffee stouts."
"O: I have to say that I've wanted to like the beers from Central Waters, but so far they're coming up a little short. This beer could be so much more but is semi-pedestrian in its current form. Flaws were apparent at almost every level. It could be darker, thicker, and more complex. This fits the definition of ""not impressed"". 2/5"
"Overall this is a great beer for a Bourbon Stout and not so much as a coffee stout. Was looking a little more for the latter."
"Shared during a small Charlotte BA tasting with marine1975, caSSino, CarolinaKevin, and GehenHerzog. Big thanks to GehenHerzog for bringing this one out to share! Served from bottle into a Bell's stemmed tulip. Poured a massively dark brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount almost instantly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, coffee, peat, and slight mothballs. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, coffee, vanilla, sweet alcohol, and smoked wood. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. It have a pretty nice peat and smoked wood aspect going on here. Both the flavor and aroma were quite good on this one. Really glad I got the opportunity to try it and I suggest you do to!"
"I always feel sketchy about sending text messages about this beer, like if too many Patriot Act Ninjas are following my conversation, ""hey, let's get into some Peruvian Morning tomorrow," and then all of a sudden my doors are being busted down by the narco police . . ."
"O - A solid coffee stout. You can really tell that they used high quality coffee in this one. Very good."
"(12oz bottle courtesy of Alpar!). Pours dark brown with khaki head. Aroma has a beautiful blend of coffee, chocolate, vanilla and light bourbon. Taste is sweet with a little roastiness and a light burn from the bourbon, but its nicely balanced. Full bodied with creamy/slick texture. Smooth finish with some heat, but not too much. This beer is really good and I'd love to have more."
"The mouthfeel"
"O: This one has the right combination of coffee and barrel aged flavors to make it a winner for me. Great stout."
"Full bodied, long finish, but not the flavors I want to soak in. Not so much. I almost don't want to finish the contents of the bottle. I will, anyway, but ...eh, maybe I won't. Only a few ounces left, but it's over, it's done, I've been there and done that. Bleh. My tongue is tired already. Meh. Sorry, can't get too riled up about this one."
"Black body with a pilowy tan/light brown head. Smells strongly of latin american coffee, bright acidity and a light roast. Some vanilla like sweet bourbon sweetness comes through at the end of a real big whiff. The coffee really dominates the flavor of this one, similar to the nose latin american coffee notes and some light roast notes. Not much bourbon flavor present, some in the finish but it doesn't really meld with the overall beer. body is medium bodied with more carbonation than I'd like. Decently drinkable but I wish the bourbon notes blended in a bit better. I don't know if I really like the interaction of the bourbon and coffee flavors, I think I prefer the bigger bourbon notes and darker roast notes of BCBCS better. Maybe also a different blend of coffee would help this since I'm not the biggest fan of Latin American coffees. Anyhow I'm glad I got to try this one but wouldn't seek it out again."
"D-This is certainly unlike any other RIS or Coffee Stout that I have ever had. However, despite being so unexpected I really enjoyed it, I like to see a brewery pushing styles and this is a success."
"A bit thin for an imperial stout - I miss the creamy viscosity that characterizes the best stouts."
"D: Most imperial stouts' viscosity and sweetness is what hinders the drinkability, but this one isn't nearly as sweet or sticky (or heavy feeling) than most imperial stouts, making the beer quite drinkable."
"I could have many of these and it is a huge coffee barrel aged stout. That is hard to accomplish. Excellent beer."
"D - goes down smooth and easy, goes great with a 'breakfast for dinner' type meal."
"I love this beer; I've had 3 2012 bottles over the last 2 weeks and I think I like it even better now. Insanely smooth and creamy and nearly perfect; I'll be looking to get more of this ASAP."
"Good beer. Good balance of sweet/roast/chocolate/vanilla/coffee with no taste overpowering the rest."
"This beer pours a dark brown with a nice tan head of foam on the surface. The aromatics are heavily bourbon and there are some sweet vanilla and a hint of clove aromas. The flavor is oddly sweet for the style. I would have expected a BBA Imperial Coffee Stout to be significantly more robust than it actually is. Hell, I honestly don't even taste the coffee, and this beer is only a month or so old. I find that this beer tastes pretty darn good, but it's actually more in line with the BBBW then it is with any stout. This is a pretty weak imperial stout just like the Satin Solstice. I'm going to guess that this is not the forte of CW. The body is medium, but it's almost considered thin. The one thing this beer has going for it is it's just overall tasty and easy drinking. If you can get it to the right temperature it goes down really easy. There is almost no coffee what so every just a vanilla bourbon goodness, but I enjoyed drinking it. I wonder what more coffee in this beer would taste like."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for an imperial Stout. I might consider this beer a barrel aged stout instead of an Imperial Stout. A delicous beer and a great beer made by Central Waters. This is the first beer i have had of this brewery and I want to try more of thier beers!"
"Overall a good beer, not as great as I remember it being. This is a bit underwhelming for an imperial stout."
"Overall, a pretty good beer, but I can't help but wonder where the claimed coffee flavors went. It was a 2011 bottle, so the coffee flavors should be fresh, but they seem to be completely absent along with most of the other typical stout flavors. It tastes much more of the barrel than the beer that went into it."
"D - Drinkability is high. While I feel the barrel may outshine the coffee a bit, it is still a delicious beer that I drank all too quickly. As the alcohol heat arrives near the beginning of the beer, by the time the other bold flavors take part, it's nearly forgotten. Thankfully, this comes in 4-packs and I will be on the lookout for this!"
"My first beer from Central Waters was a very good one. Can't wait to try more of their stuff."
"D: To me, this just isn't as drinkable as other bbal stouts. The booze is really forward on this, and not for the better in my opinion. By no means is this a BAD beer, but I definitely won't be rushing out to buy any more."
"Thanks Levi!"
"Drink and overall: Very drinkable. Can hardly taste the 8.5% ABV, which I suppose is relatively mild for an Imperial Stout. I love this beer. I was very impressed the first time I tried it, and continues to impress with each additional tasting."
"Edit: I picked up a 4-pack of the 2013 vintage, and it's incredible - huge coffee, rich dark chocolate, and just enough oak to cut through the sweetness. Terrific stout."
"Don't get me wrong, this is a very good tasting beer. I just don't think it quite holds up to some of the big character double stouts out there. I'm going to keep these in the fridge for a change of pace from time to time when I don't want to be weighed down."
"Alcohol is noticeable to a small degree. This mixed with the bitterness of the coffee notes does slightly take away from an otherwise drinkable beer. Mouthfeel on the other hand it really quite nice. Rich, smooth and a precise amount of carbonation trickle over the tongue in a superb fashion."
"This beer is dark as... shiitake mushrooms. Deep, deep chocolate tones with a slight alcohol tinge are the most present aromas, but another pass brings a fruity smell, but what fruit that is remains a question (think really faint apple or banana). The total smell experience is by no means lacking, but it does not stand out in comparison to the BBS. Coffee, chocolate, bourbon, and a vanilla/fruit mix permeate through the flavor profile. All of these tastes are equally balanced, but the coffee taste lingers well after the sip. Think of your best cup of coffee, and how you smile after each sip. This is the feeling that the Peruvian Morning brings. The mouthfeel of this beer is worth mentioning as well. The carbonation adds a crisp component to the otherwise big beer, adding both to the complexity and the lingering aftertaste."
"Mouthfeel is extra thick and viscous with moderate carbonation. It's definitely a sipper, but a good one for the bourbon and coffee fan. This will be one that I track down each year it comes out."
"D: My glass went quickly; the complexity in this one really kept me interested in having the next sip. Hope I get another chance to try this one in the near future."
"Pours black with a big tan head that stares back at you for a while. Smell is outta sight - big coffee, tiny hint of vanilla. For the record, the BA offerings from Central Waters are always lower key, with wel integrated flavors as opposed to huge barrel potentially overpowering the base beer. This beer tastes of mega coffee, with just a touch of bourbon, vanilla and booze. CW knows how to make an imperial coffee stout, and PM just extends that idea without changing it much. This beer tastes fantastic. Medium carbonation with maybe a slightly thinner an expected mouthfeel. Exceedingly drinkable. Just a killer brew."
"4.5 D: This is a good one. It isn't nearly as bold and flavorful as something like GI BCS, but it's a damn good brew that is easier to drink. Bourbon paradoxically is the main act while simultaneously complementing the base stout. Lots of good flavors going on in this and they all work together."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a wonderful dark brown color with a milk chocolate thick head. The aroma is fantastic with strong chocolate, vanilla, great bourbon tones and slight coffee notes. The taste is rich and creamy with chocolate and bourbon at the front and a nice vanilla finish with warm alcohol on the throat. The emmy J's coffee that was advertised on the label (being a local emmy J's coffee is fantastic) was missing and if not noted would have never known was there. The brew had a thick body and was just all around delicious."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a bit of head. Way too thin for an imperial coffee stout. But, smells incredible! Lots of coffee and bourbon. Wow. Tastes great! The bourbon is just subtle enough to compliment the coffee. The mouthfeel is a bit thin and dry which causes the drinkability to suffer a bit but the beer is so tasty it makes up for it"
"D: Another outstanding Imperial Stout from Central Waters... this brewery keeps killing it with their amazingly subtle barrel-aging and complementary, balanced flavor profiles. Quickly becoming one of my go-to brands for those dark beer cravings. Definitely another beer to keep an eye out for."
"D - Big, bold, roasty and flavorful, this is a great beer to sip on. And one probably won't do it for me. I could easily go for some more of this."
"This is a drinkable beer, although more than one is bound to leave minimal palate for tasting without some relief time. Definitely, a solid beer with strength in all components. I hope they keep making this solid beer."
"I really wish I had tackled this sooner; I just couldn't yet bear to part with my last Central Waters beer. It's a shame the coffee flavors have so faded; I thought Emy J's blend was exceptional in the Brewhouse Coffee Stout. A nice beer as-is, it just seems very similar to the bourbon barrel stout."
"D- Very excellent brew. I found this one very easy to drink."
"Beer is silky smooth and coats the mouth with great flavors, its a pure joy to drink. Mildly sweet and hot in the front but the bourbon is amazing in this one, its bitter with coffee and roast at the end and finishes great. I really enjoyed this beer."
"This is a really great beer, much better than I would have thought going in. The aroma reminds me a very grainy mash ton covered in bourbon and with savory notes to it. A Smooth Bourbon taste thats creamy in feel and verysavory. Oak is very nice in this. Malty sweetness definitely there, but balanced out nicely. Not hot at all, though the smell makes it seem like it will be hot. Nice beer overall."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is (as I've mentioned) milky and smooth, fills the mouth and leaves a silky smooth chocolate and coffee aftertaste on the tongue. Very drinkable and enjoyable and I wish my coffee tasted like this every morning!"
"A perennial favorite from Central Waters, this is a great barrel aged coffee stout. With this and the other Central Waters -bals available for purchase off the shelf come February, we have it good in Wisconsin."
"Poured into a snifter. Color is near black with a short mocha head that has a decent retention time. Nose is strong coffee and wood with some nice touches of vanilla and cream. Great taste, combining coffee and vanilla well. Good body.and carbonation. Another solid hit from Central Waters."
"Overall:  I have had this a few times and have encountered the sourness on each occasion; at first I thought I was getting a bad bottle but I guess that is what the brewer has intended - I am not a big fan of that element"
"(D)- A fantastic beer and a fantastic example of the style. Superbly balanced despite being bourbon barrel aged. One of the finest examples of a Barrel aged beer that is not incredibly boozy, but smooth, yet rich and inviting. Yet another reason why I love midwest brewers."
"Pours a dark brown, almost black with a tan head. Smells are malts, chocolate and bourbon with some vanilla. Taste is chocolate, bourbon and vanilla with an espresso finish. Mouthfeel is medium, not as thick as I thought it would be. Drinkability is very good with this one."
"I really liked the flavors here, and the there was definitely no shortage of crunchy and delicious coffee flavor to this, but the bourbon presence here if VERY warm and stinging. Almost to the point of interfering with some of the other flavors. I could see maybe aging one of these but then you're going to lose some of the vibrancy of the coffee. Tone some of that barrel down and this would be pretty freaking good. On this night though, I just wasn't digging this nearly as much as I thought I would."
"D - Somewhat drinkable, just thin bodied and light. The alcohol burn makes it a sipper. Just ok for me."
"D. This is definitely drinkable. Pretty good stout. Just a little bit of heat in the smell and taste, but not too much. Coffee stouts arent my favorite take on an Imperial Stout, but there is no denying this is a good beer."
"CW strikes again with another masterful piece of artistry."
"I pretty much love everything from Central Waters, this one was no different. Great beer, enough said."
"D: Very tasty. Alcohol is well hidden. I could drink plenty of these!"
"Bourbon greets the palate with a spicy alcoholic heat and bubbly, tight carbonation. Mid-sip, notes of dark chocolate and roasted coffee beans stop in for a brief visit before the boozy finish of vinous, port-like nuances, licorice, and a bit of smoked beef. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected for the style and (as noted) rife with carbonation. A bit too much so, in fact, but the finish is creamy and relatively smooth despite all the alcoholic heat. Overall, a very tasty beer, but fell slightly short of expectations. Certainly worth a try, though."
"D - as a stout, very good...as an RIS, missing the big body and appearance. still quite yummy with a very well done coffee+chocolate emphasis."
"D - Pretty drinkable, as it is tasty and nothing is offensive. Would not mind having this again."
"I love this beer because the coffee flavors are so authentic. Much like CW Coffee Stout, Peruvian Morning has a wonderful, complex flavor of fresh brewed coffee - nothing artificial. Coffee lovers do yourself a favor and get your hands on some of this soon!"
"Somewhat drinkable, nonetheless. Bit too thin."
"D: Bourbon heat on this makes it a sipper, pretty decent kick, I wish I could age this a year to take some heat off the bourbon, but it sips pretty well as is...."
"D - This is a solid brew that the folks at Central Waters have come up with. This one is easy sip on and enjoy over an extended period of time. That doesn't really change the overall drinkability in any way. The aroma was really a slight let down but not by much as it was still good. I could definitely have this beer again and if I get the chance, I will."
"12 ounce bottle- 2010 edition. Pours inky black cola. very little head with some fine mocha lacing. Nose- wood, light vanilla, sweet malts, milk chocolate. Not much in terms of coffee though which is surprising. Taste- initial sip is bourbon heat followed by an acrid black coffee taste and wood dryness. As the beer warms the malt sweetness comes partially through. Medium bodied with higher carbonation. Finish is quite bitter and hot. I think this is one that could sit for awhile to smooth out."
"Good beer, only falls a bit short of KBS which is my standard for any bourbon coffee stout."
"Pours a very nice black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, with some nice little islands and sticky lacing left behind. The nose is very nice of malts, bourbon, slight oak, some roast notes, chocolate/toffee. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, very nice touch of bourbon, some oak notes, chocolate/toffee. Full-Medium body, the ABV is alittle upfront on this brew. Very Drinkable, this brew really surprised the shit out of me, very very nice, highly recommended."
"Pours a deep, dark, opaque black color, with a nice cap of off-white foam. Huge aromas of bourbon, vanilla, roasted malt, coffee and dark chocolate. On the palate, a very nice coffee imperial stout, made so much better by the time spent in the bourbon barrels. An outstanding beer, maybe ½ a notch below GI Bourbon County Coffee Stout and KBS."
"Medium bodied, smooth, creamy, very easy to drink, and very good. I will seek this out again."
"Overall, very glad I got to try this. Anyone who likes a good bourbon barrel beer with a hint of coffee is sure to enjoy this one."
"D- This beer was fantastic! I almost forgot all about it and then at DLD I got a bottle and remembered that I wanted to try it. Was well worth the surprise and wait. Will be looking for more bottles in the future of this!"
"All in all, a nice beer but not a defining example for its style. I'd drink this on occasion if it was readily available to me and not too outlandishly priced."
"D: Fairly good, but it was too early to open this one. Reminds me a lot of GI's Bourbon County Stout, but less intense"
"The beer pours dark brown to black with a tan head. The aroma is lots of chocolate and coffee. The flavor is more of the same with the addition of vanilla, oak and bourbon. Surprisingly, the chocolate is more dominant than the coffee but this is an outstanding barrel-aged beer that lives up to the high ratings that it receives. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: This was very nice. The bourbon flavors blend well with the espresso and chocolate. While a touch on the sweet side, this was a very smooth beer that has a great finish. I would look for this again."
"SkÅL!"
"Huge thanks to Andrew for sharing this one last week out of the blue. One day I will really have to repay this guy for all the great beers he randomly shares. This one pours a black or very dark brown with a nice tan head. Aroma of ancho chile, dry coffee beans, and bourbon. The taste has bourbon, chocolate syrup, malt, and peculiarly the coffee is much lighter than in the nose. The finish brings roasted malts, cookie, and spice. Mouthfeel is full and nicely slick and oily. This beer was tasty, but somehow it lacked the depth for me to truly enjoy it as much as I had hoped I would. Good beer."
"D: A good beer for sure. But a bit boozy, and not the most elegant version of this style.. perhaps it is a shame that I drank a KBS last night, and it is still in my memory."
"D- This is a very good, interesting imperial stout and a nice ending to the tasting. The ABV is minimally noticeable. I found this brew to be quite drinkable and unique. The fruitiness blends well with the coffee characters. I'd love to have this one again!"
"D: This beer is up against some tough competition. Coffee imperial stouts are getting more popular, and there are a couple of other competitors in this particular coffee-bourbon style (KBS and BCBCS come to mind). On the whole, I like this beer, though I feel its competitors are better."
"D: A really complex beer. Even with the barrel aging and a significant ABV, the alcohol presence is fairly minimal. I'm glad to have several more of these."
"D: This beer is perfect for those getting into bourbon barrel-aged brews. It's smooth, not overwhelming, and very good. Definitely something I am looking forward to trying again in the near future."
"D - Good overall barrel aged stout. Not overpowering and much more than just a sipper. Aroma is quite complex and enjoyable...flavor is good, but a notch behind the aroma. Tingle all over the mouth is interesting and unusual. Definitely a worthy BA stout. Glad I had the opportunity to try it."
"Overall a tasty beer that is not too much. Some stouts can just be too intense. This one is good. Get it if you can. Pretty surprised this one isn't rated higher."
"Overall - I'd call this a malt bomb, but it marries my love of coffee and beer (and bourbon) nicely. Delightfully rich, I wish we served this at the coffee shop I work at."
"Overall, while an excellet brew, I was expecting just a little bit more. I've come to expect great things from Central Waters, so while this brew is great by any other standards, this one fell just a bit short for me."
"Peruvian Morning possesses the same ""grainy"" (though not unpleasant) corn flavour the BBS had, so I believe it may have something to do with the barrels they use. I know they said at the brewery that they used Heaven's Hill barrels (among others) for their BBBW. This would be great on a Sunday morning with sausages drizzled with real maple syrup...Cinnamon rolls would work well too."
"D: this is a very tasty beer...lots of complex flavors that begin to really open up as the beer warms. A great sipper for sure."
"Edit: 2012 edition in my glass right now and this stuff is amazing. I originally gave this a 4.1, but I was a noob then. This stuff is legit and you cannot go wrong for the price. I am stocking up on this beer. Wow, what an underrated beer. This has everything I want in a beer. Solid bourbon presence, nice coffee flavor with a subtle roast, creaminess and good mouthfeel, and an extremely dangerous drinkability. CW does it right."
"Overall, a great introduction to Central Waters. I will certainly want more of this stuff."
"Cola/coffee brown color, nowhere near opaque as light provides a nice glow. A thin tan head that quickly fades to nothing and no lacing. Overall very serene and still looking beer (like the Machu Picchu depicted on the label I suppose). The aroma is easily the highlight of this beer for me and is among the best of any barrel aged stout I've tried. Rich balanced blend of flavors, focusing on the coffee and sweet bourbon/vanilla from the barrel aging. Unfortunately I enjoy the aroma much more than the rest of the experience as the flavor is more similar to the CW Bourbon Barrel Stout, as well as the too thin, undercarbonated body. The finish is also particularly short and dry resulting in disappointment. The flavor is much more bourbon and vanilla forward than the aroma and is lacking the richness and balance of the aroma. In particular the coffee flavors are only present near the finish and in the lingering dryness. Not sure beer exactly is the base beer, but the barrel flavors are supported by mild charred malt, dark chocolate, too young dark fruits. I'm enjoying the Central Waters beers I've tried so far, but maybe my expectations are too high as I keep waiting for one to ""wow"" me and that hasn't happened yet."
"This is my favorite Central Waters beer of all. Just an amazing stout from soup to nuts!"
"D - This is certainly a class act for the category. As far as American Double/Imperial Stouts go, the 8.5% ABV is actually toward the low end of the spectrum. You can never go wrong with Central Waters...these guys know what they are doing when it comes to brewing beer."
"Why do I expect every imperial stout to pour out like Expedition or Ten FIDY. My high expectations always lead to disappointment when a beer such as this pours a thin dark brown, but is nearly black in the glass and ruby edges where the light shines through, small tan head and some nice looking lacing. Wow, impressive coffee nose on this. Nice balance between the coffee notes, chocolate and roast, with only the slightest hint of bourbon. Mmmm, this is delicious. Coffee is in generous amounts, blending perfectly with chocolate, graham cracker, caramel, and vanilla nuances that just dance on the tongue. Not really getting much in the way of barrel in the in taste department, but there is light bourbon quality, with a bulk of the barrel aging translating into a vanilla finish. Smooth, rich, inviting. Barely any bitterness from the coffee or hops. This is malt forward, lightly sweet and delicious. Truly a spectacular tasting coffee stout, but I could go for a little body and maybe just a touch more carbonation. Great drinker, can't taste any alcohol at all. This is one that I have been wanting to try for a long time now, and I thank Sparklepants for picking this up for me. Great beer!"
"Low carbonation and viscous enough, the barrel definitely helps on the mouthfeel. But once again, as it warmed, a bit too much. I liked this better than the BBS, but still - I had high expectations for this beer. I had heard so much about it and it didn't quite deliver to the level that I had hoped. Really happy that I got the chance to try it and I will definitely revisit it in a week or two."
"Better-than-decent drinkability, though the alcohol presence is assertive enough to make you want to take this one slowly. I'd say two bottle maximum per sitting with this one."
"This is a great beer! One of my favorite unknown beers."
"Despite the warm alcohol, this one goes down very easy. A very enjoyable IS. I will enjoy many more of these in the future. Awesome brew."
"D: This drinks just as well as their regular Brewhouse Coffee Stout, spicy booze and all. I drained my glass post haste."
"D: Over time the coffee could become a little overpowering, but I really am yearning for each next sip at the moment. A great tasting beer with not really any alcohol flavors helps the score here."
"Central Waters brews some really impressive beer. Peruvian Morning's a great example. While it's not their best beer, it's up there. The flavor is damn good. The only qualm I have with it is the body. It's crying out for more. Still very tasty beer nonetheless. Hopefully they'll start distributing their beer to other states at some point. I'd love to see this stuff in Ohio. Thanks, Alex."
"D: Too easy to quaff for a 8+% beer! Damn you guys! ;-) Outstanding beer in book!"
"D - I think Central Waters can do better with this one. It's a fine offering from them but one that is mediocre in comparison to both their Coffee Stout and Bourbon Barrel Stout. It's a decent sipper bit I'm happy with only the one beer."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This pours thick chocolate syrup. Just a little bit of head with immediate lacing. This is dark, but has a reddish tint to it. Just a little hint of coffee smell, but the alcohol is overpowering. Wow! This has a great first sip! Awesome mild chocolate taste with a definite alcohol aftertaste. It's creamy, but that aftertaste hurts the drinkability. This could grow on me"
"Peruvian Morning is an excellent beer and I enjoy it very much. For my first taste of Central Waters brews I doubt much could leave a better impression. Big stouts are obviously not for sessions though I would drink a couple of these in a sitting. Definitely one to seek out if given the chance. Very good beer, no question."
"D- A pretty high ABV but this beer is so rich and so smooth that it could get you into some trouble. Another stellar offering from Central Waters. Just a shame it only comes out once a year."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is above average for the style, even if it comes in at over 8%. Overall, I really enjoyed this brew. Sweet, but well crafted. I will definately pick this one up the next time I'm in Wisconsin. Skal."
"Overall a fantastic beer. Maybe a touch hot for my taste. Considering this is fresh from the brewery I will let it slide for now and revist this beer in six months to see what some age does."
"Drinkability is good for the style. A very nice beer overall."
"I still like their regular coffee stout better, but this beer was tasty and quite warming for the abv. I wish I had more bottles."
"Mouthfeel is creamy with good body. Not overly heavy which is nice. A tasty treat of a beer that I would seek out again if they brew it again! Thanks to kmpitz2 for tossing this my direction."
"Coffee is initially dominant on the palate, sharp and heavily roasted. The -bal comes forth mid-palate, bringing flavors of vanilla and toffee that meld with, but never quite overtake the coffee flavor. Surprisingly light in body, and ridiculously smooth, this could be the most sessionable imperial stout around. It finishes with a coffee-vanilla-roasted nut mélange that doesn't linger on the palate too long, making it a little too easy to take another sip. In conclusion, this beer is really good."
"If Central Waters would use the malt bill for Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout rather than the one for Satin Solstice, they'd have a beer for the ages. As is, this is still damn good stuff if you like stout, coffee and bourbon in the same glass."
"D - Palate killer. Nice, though!"
"I like KBS more, but this is a pretty excellent brew in its own right and I hope Central Waters brings it back in the future."
"D: This is a strong one that is tasty but too boozy. I would not order a second and I might buy again only cause it's sold as a single. I prefer the Brewhouse Coffee Stout from CW."
"D - This is a very impressive, bold beer. I really enjoyed it throughout and am sad to know that this is the only one I have. It was almost too flavorful to have more than one, however I wish I could have another. I was glad to see this on the shelf when I was in WI earlier this year, and wish I could try other beers from Central Waters."
"Overall a nice pairing of a Coffee stout and some bourbon barrel aging. I'll have to track down some more of this. Another winner from CW!"
"D - Very good. The sweetness and vanilla get to be a lot by the end of the bottle but it is still very tasty."
"Very roasty mouthfeel with a lot more of a hop forward presence than expected. HUGE roated coffee bean flavor with hints of chocolate malt, caramel, oatmeal, toffee and a perfect dose of earthy bourbon. This beer is very complex and extremely well-balanced with none of the flavors overpowering the others. Quite unusual for a coffee and/or bourbon barrel aged beer. Silky smooth with a raosty yet sweet body and slightly dry finish."
"D-A very well done brew by CW, but I can't say I am really surprised considering how much I like thier regular coffee stout. A rich, smooth and very well blended brew. Kudos to CW!"
"D: A beauty of a beer, rich aroma and flavor. A little overbearing actually, but forgivable in that I SO want to have this one again...would promise to split it next time. Recommended to start or (better yet) finish the day. Two thumbs up!"
"Hard not to compare to the great Peche as this one is also all about the coffee and also frickin' amazing. Thanks Eric!"
"Drinkability - top notch stuff by Central Waters. MPLS brought me a bottle of this at DLD09. Choice brew, thanks Erik!"
"Nice label. Pours a dark brown color with a medium head, ok retention and leaves a nice bit of brown lacing on the glass. The aroma has a nutty/coffee character as the main component with a little chocolate in the background as well as some nice bourbon notes. I might have confused the bourbon barrel aroma as nutty. Smells good. The flavor is a nice complex mix. Roasted malts, bourbon, coffee, chocolate, and a touch of dark fruit. I don't get the vanilla that most people seem to get, but it's good regardless. The body is medium and the drinkability is good."
"Pours a dark brown with a silky tan head. Nose has bitter coffee, roasted malts, vanilla, bourbon, chocolate and oak. Taste also has a big espresso presence, whiskey, vanilla, wood, cocoa and molasses. Creamy body is delicately carbonated, but a bit thin. Great stuff."
"old scores: 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4"
"This was interesting and nice, but didn't quite live up to my hopes. If were up to me, I'd like to see a thicker mouthfeel and no bourbon barrel aging. Bourbon barrel flavors ran away with this in my opinion."
"D: It's pretty boozy, but for the style I'd have to say the drinkability is good."
"This is one flavorful beer....I'd be interested to see what a little oat addition would do to the body and mouthfeel...as is it is very good but an improvement on the body and texture would make this a classic"
"Drinkability? The taste sure keeps me happy though I'd say the alcohol isn't hidden all that well as I get lots of warming after every swallow. This is a sipper and I'll treat it as such so major problems on that point. I'm really glad I got a chance to try this one and can recommend it."
"One of the more drinkable BA Stouts I've sampled."
"Taste is more of the bourbon, but with some oak and a bit more chocolate coming in than you can detect from the flavor. Matter of fact, there's a lot more chocolate coming through in the flavor and it's very nice. A little thin in the mouthfeel department. This is a very solid beer, and easily my favorite that I've had from Central Waters. Would love to get some more of this."
"D: ABV is pretty low for the style, so it's very drinkable. It's incredibly robust but very well balanced. The bourbon flavor is strong without over-stepping it's bounds. Fantastic beer. I will be re-visiting this one."
"D: Complex sipper with an oh-so-interesting taste profile."
"Pours a cola black with dark ruby outlines along the edges of the glass. A fluffy two finger light brown head falls to a thin creamy layer of foam leaving behind a fair amount of stick on the sides. Aroma is a powerful burst of freshly ground coffee with bakers chocolate and oak. Caramel and bourbon tickle the nose with some smokiness as well. But really, to me this is all about the coffee smell, and boy is it a good one. Taste starts with chocolate covered coffee beans, vanilla, and a bit of fig. Midway some earthy malts with graham cracker and cocoa powder. Aftertaste is warm with a bit of booze from the bourbon with more espresso flavors. Medium bodied with a semi-creamy feel and a soft carbonation. I could use a bit more heft to this, especially for the style. One of the better coffee beers out there for sure. Thanks again Steve!"
"This beer was a bit of a disappointment. It seems forced... The flavors aren't blended well at all. I hope age does a bit more justice to the couple other bottles I have."
"drinkability is good. well balanced. complex and interesting, just not very stout-y."
"Pours an opaque dark reddish brown, some ruby highlights in the corners, nice and thick tan head forms, settles to a thick ring around the glass and a thin layer, some nice lacing sticks to the glass, looks pretty good. Smell is neat, very fresh and roasty like a cup of coffee, some caramel sweetness, lots of chocolate, kind of woody, some nice vanilla and oak notes, some biscuits, nice and sweet, good coffee aroma. Taste is really nice, lots of vanilla and caramel, light chocolate roastiness, buttery oak, cream, some raisins, almost an orange peel/citrus note in the finish, really nice and oaky, like dessert. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to low carbonation, super flavour, very rich texture, nice! Great beer, thanks Russ!"
"D: This is a sipper, and one I'm enjoying. Well done, CW, and please brew this several times more and perfect it, as you're on the right track"
"Drinkability is pretty good. Duane hooked me up with a whole gang of strong dark ales from this area, barrels, coffee, etc...and so far I've like the Tyreanna offerings better. Just a bit too much bourbon here, the barrels were obviously still pretty wet when they filled em up. Less heat would allow the coffee to come through stronger, which I'd prefer. By the end, this got to be a bit of a chore, and I had to drop it a final 1/2 point."
"Peruvian Morning is another beautiful creation from the folks over at Central Waters. They've really been pumping out some gems over the last few years and this is no exception and maybe the best of the bunch, if not it's close. Thanks for the hookup Dave!"
"Overall: The drinkability isn't terrible, but the feel makes it a bit lower. This beer smells and looks pretty good, but once you drink it the mouthfeel is really distracting. The flavors aren't bad, although there is more of an alcohol presence than I would desire. The mouthfeel is very fizzy and does not match the flavors. Especially at first, the mouthfeel really takes away from the flavors and makes it hard to really enjoy them."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" tan head over the almosy opaque dark brown brew. Head falls slowly, with average lacing. Aroma is coffee, maple syrup, and barrel notes. Taste truly shadows the nose, with the barrel character of vanilla and whiskey dominant at the close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is WAY too easy for what it is. Wish I could find come more easily."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip. As it pours there's a glint of red, but in the glass it's pitch black with soft burnt sienna at it's edges. Spots of lace, the tan foam rekindles with a swirl. Aroma is all buttery oak and vanilla. First sip is a nice impression of dark roast coffee, vanilla, fudgy chocolate frosting, and faint bourbon on the back end. Bitterness is slight, as is the sweetness. It's like a good cup of coffee blended with a dropper full of bourbon and melted chocolate milkshake. Feel is on par with other CW barrel-aged stouts, not huge and not wimpy, just right. It's very tasty, not sure if I prefer their Bourbon Cherry Stout more or not..."
"Overall this is not a good imperial stout . I would not buy it again."
"Drinkability- This beer is fantastic. The nose is heavenly, maybe pound-for-pound the best brew I've ever smelled. The taste is really nice as well but if I hear a beer has coffee it in, I want that coffee to dominate. Also it's slightly astringent but nothing I can't get past. All in all very tasty stuff that I wish I had a bottle or two more of. Thanks much Shannon!"
"D--I'm already feeling this hit me and I'm not even done with 12 oz. It's hard not to keep reaching for the pint glass though, this one calls out my name for more"
"Dark auburn/brown body. Thin creamy brown head. Lace comes in sporadic rings. Really thick aroma of caramel and burnt cream and toffee. Also some coffee notes. Reminds me of the aroma for Southern Tier Creme Brulee. Very unique. Very thick. And very inviting. The flavor has a ""spent"" coffee grain flavor to go with the thick caramel and burnt nougat goodness. Pretty bold and actually pretty unique for a coffee beer. This one has got a pretty sturdy body and enough carbonation to prick the tongue. The overall experience is quite good."
"What can I say here, this is a beer that was simply made for me. Insanely good with a rich texture, sweet coffee flavor and an overall approach that is second to none. I need this everyday."
"this stout pours a dark black cherry with a mahogany hue it has a nice creamy head that dissipates nicely to a 1/4 inch mahogany ring til finish.the smell is of coffee and bourbon followed by a cream cherry smell i also smell vanilla bean.. the taste is unbelievably smooth its starts out like roasted coffee and then cocoa and molasses tastes followed by a bourbon vanilla/cherry and cream finish very smooth..the mouth fell is semi- thick and it cotes the senses with the tastes and smells but never overpowers... you just want another sip it gets better and better as it warms.. to bad this beer is in limited release i wish i bought more of this one..its still in the stores so buy/try this one if you can find b4 its gone."
"Simply a terrific beer. Anyone who's a fan of stouts, bourbon, or coffee should seek this out immediately. I've had two of Central Waters 'big' beers & they've both been extremely high quality - sign me up as a fan."
"4.5/4/4.5/4.5/4"
"Good tasting Double Stout. A strong few flavors really shine here, and not much really bad here. One of the better stouts I've had in awhile. I'll be trying to find a few more of these, and maybe hang on to a few."
"D - Definitely order another one of these, if just for rarity. Not one of my favorites in the stout genre. Where's my Cusquena?"
"D: This is as good as I expected it to be. A real doozy that is one of the best coffee/bourbon stouts out there. Central Waters really knows its way around the style."
"D. Oftentimes I tire quickly of big, rich bourbon barrel aged stouts. Central Waters has managed to pack a ton of flavor into this beer without over doing it. I need to get more of this stuff fast. Bravo!!"
"This is an epic beer. The only thing I can compare it to is GI Bourbon County Stout. The addition of coffee makes this one quite different. Either way, this is one amazing beer."
"With their coffee stout, the bourbon barrel, and Satin Solstice, and now this, Central Waters might be the best stout brewery out there (sorry Larry Bell)."
"Drinkability is dangerously high. A very nice stout."
"Full bodied with medium carbonation, with a dry and creamy mouthfeel. Peruvian Morning is an extremely enjoyable stout and I'd recommend seeking it out."
"Pours out a dark black with nice tan head that laces well. Sweet bourbon nose with a touch of chocolate and coffee. Taste is huge with a big bourbon presence followed by bitter coffee flavors. Light almost creamy texture, sweet warming alcohol presence. A little too much in the bourbon for me, but will review it again later. Pretty big beer right now, will be a lot better with a little time on it, but this is a very nice beer."
"D: nice and well-balanced"
"The bourbon is a bit overpowering the taste for this beer though the aroma is world class in my opinion. I probably prefer CW's Coffee Stout to this, but I definitely enjoyed this beer."
"I love Bourbon and I love beer. But part of me wants the whole Bourbon barrel-aged beer bubble to burst. Sometimes it works magic (GI BCS), but it seems a gimmick more often than not. Here it simply serves as a detriment."
"Definitely a beer to savor rather than session. I can't imagine having more than one of these. Perfect for a cold, bitter, Wisconsin winter evening. Or morning, if you trust the label."
"Quite a thick, viscous body on this beer with just enough carbonation to give it a little zest, but still leaving a smooth chewy texture on the beer. I am thoroughly impressed with this beer all around. I really should buy a bunch of these to age."
"Make no mistake about it, this is a kick ass beer, that is more than worth seeking out!"
"drinkability: must have more"
"D- Through the first bottle it's very drinkable. I could see this beer tiring out a person's palate though, since I don't have a desire to have another immediately. Putting a few bottles down to age."
"Body is heavy, carbonation is medium, just right. Drinkable and interesting for non coffee drinkers, extremely drinkable and enjoyable for coffee drinkers."
"Too bad they did not have growlers of this one; it was (one of ) the icing(s) on the cake at a party that was highlighted by the royal treatment dispensed to BAs. The brewery is a must visit."
