"Remarkable beer, rich great balance smooth and a wonderful accompaniment to a chocolate dessert."

"O: Very impressed, I would like to have more bourbon character on the nose and flavor but this is really tasty, nice creamy mouthfeel and at 12% ABV, the alcohol is well hidden, not sure when this was bottled but it's very pleasant. Price is a little steep but this will not disappoint."
"O - Not surprisingly the beer held up fantastic.  The 4 years really added some really nice balance and integration."

"Guest tap at FFF poured into snifter. Appearance is deep brown with no translucent edges. A small tan head forms, then collapses to a thin remnant that lasts the session - which took a while. This was a textbook sipper. The aroma is barrel-forward: coconut, charred oak, vanilla, brown sugar, and booze. Below that are coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malt, and ripe plum. Taste is lead by toasted coconut and the barrel notes - all washed in alcohol. Moderate sweetness comes next in the form of vanilla, molasses, and chocolate. Some bitter licorice and oak flavors come late. Full bodied, thick, oily, and chewy texture, minimal carbonation, long sweet boozy finish."
"Overall, I was a little let down with this. Very little bourbon that I am so fond of in a BBA impy stout, thin and slick, but not viscous. Overly-hyped."

"To me, like fresh Bourbon County Stout.  Very good, would recommend."

"2013 bottle. Very low carbonation but still enough not to ruin the beer. Still very enjoyable."

"The bourbon flavor is the main stage here. But what a smooth clean finish. Starts out a bit boozy but the chocolate and vanilla notes appear as the glass warms up. No head with a dark rich color"
"Wow do much better than old viscosity, pours black with a chocolate one finger everlasting head, smell is bourbon , dark chocolate, oak,booze and irish coffee, lucious full feel with above moderate carbonation which makes this such an easy drinker with dark and milk chocolate being on the forefront followed by oak and finished like an irish coffee full of booze, dark fruit and coffee, overall what a stunner of a drop and well worth a taste cheers."

"O: 4.5 I’m very pleased with this beer and it’s held up very well. There are a lot of great flavors going on and, despite its problems, its still very enjoyable and satisfying. I had one of these fresh recently and it did not have the same complexity and richness; it could be the aging or batch variation, but it’s drinking great now after 3 years."

"My favorite beer of all time.  The thickest beer I have ever drank, I don't even feel like going over why the is better than 99% of stouts out there.  If you like stouts and find this on a shelf, buy it.  You will not be disappointed."

"This beer is tasty as all hell. So many different flavors find their way into this beer. It's pretty awesome. The heat is a slight issue and the other is the $16 price tag. This think costs more than a dollar an ounce in the bottle, which is pretty wild, I think. 4.5"

"O - To my taste buds, this beer is not as complex as I had hoped for.  It's mostly just a very boozy stout.  That does not make it bad, and I'm glad I tasted it.  But I won't be a repeat buyer."

"Bottle pour, believed to be a 2006 (but may have been an '11). Nose, taste, look of an amazing barrel aged imperial stout, but the mouthfeel was thin. Nonetheless, a wonderful beer."

"This is a very good BBA stout. It isn't quite up there in BCBS/Parabola territory, although the appearance and mouthfeel are incredible for the style. It's a very good beer worth seeking out for a try."

"O - The alcohol is hidden well but it needs a greater depth of flavour. I found it a little weak-flavoured and watery. No residual sweetness. Price is extortionate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very thick mouthfeel and only a minor note of alcohol.  Delicious Imperial Stout that I think will only improve with age."

"These beer pours motor oil black. The smell is of sweet booziness. The flavor is sweet with a nice bit of bourbon and dark malts. I absolutely loved this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pours up black with quickly dissipating head. No lacing. Nose is bourbon straight up. All the characteristics that go with bourbon were there. Vanilla, leather, heat, molasses, burnt caramel. Taste is the same way. Huge bourbon, almost too much but not too much if you smell what I'm fartin. Same characters from the nose. It's a simple yet complex brew. Thick body. Not as thick as some brews I've had which makes the drinkability go up. Sticky lingering finish. Very mellow carbo. I dig"
""
""
""
""
"This was strong and made no bones about it but this was one of the few beers where a decrease in alcohol would serve as a distraction. Just a good amount of stickiness and smokiness were found here but it served as proof that that was no ordinary Stout indeed. Worth enjoying, even if it has to be split with a fellow imbiber. Can't wait to give this a go again when the winter comes - this would be a perfect beer to celebrate the holidays with."

"375 ml bottle into snifter, vintage 2013A bottling. Pours dense pitch black color with a small fairly dense tan head with poor retention, that reduces to a ring of lacing fairly quickly. Some slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, raisin, prune, caramel, toast, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, and roast/oak earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, raisin, prune, and roast/oak earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness/spicy alcohol on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roast, caramel, toast, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, and roast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel flavors; with an awesome malt/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is fairly well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome barrel aged imperial stout. All around great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Jet black, thin creamy head. Significant bourbon presence plus vanilla, toffee, molasses. Creamy through and through. Pretty boozy and very vanilla intensive almost to this beer's detriment(almost, not quite). A tiny bit of coffee bitterness on the end? Somewhat thick but not chewy."

"This was served with barely any head. The body was super dark, near pitch black. This stout had an easy going aroma. The usual roasted malts, with vanilla, coffee, sweet bread, and chocolate. The taste was heavy and had a cloying sweetness. I didn't taste much bourbon, I wish there was more...For me there was a good amount of prune and raisin taste near the backend of each drink. The mouthfeel was not memorable, not bad, just nothing special. I will say this stout was viscous and syrupy. This was nice to try. I likely would not seek it out again, but would give it another go if it was immediately available."

"Rich, dark chocolate with a cream finish. The body is thick, like a rich dark cocoa. Low carbonation enhances this feel. It's like a dark chocolate with a bourbon chaser. Very thick body with a low carbonation. More sweet than most Imperial Stouts. Strong alcohol feel. Slightly burnt aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a thick oily black color with a small foamy tan head. Big boozy bourbon aroma, some oak, caramel, and dark fruit as well. Taste is much the same. Lots of bourbon and oak, and notes of toffee, roasted malt, and sweet dark fruits. Overall it is good but not quite what I was hoping for."
"Badass. Unashamed to show off the bourbon. Big oaky notes, spicy booze, perhaps some roasty rye to abut the spice, alcohol heat, burnt sugars, and some finishing vanilla. The body is remarkable. Creamy thick, like a beer slurry. Very smooth, with a tickle of spice, bitterness, and carbonation. Heat is next-level, of course. Recommended."
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty good BA stout. A little heavy on the bourbon in both taste and smell but not overpowering. If it was a little better balanced or cheaper, this would be a great value."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O-This is a tasty beer that sort-of straddles the line between old ale, barley wine, and stout. The flavors are quite sweet, but never cloying. The alcohol is also very warming, but it adds a nice flavor characteristic instead of detracting from the flavors. The feel is a touch on the thin side, but not awful. This would make a very solid desert beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Probably not going to spend the cash to get this one again. After what I consider conquering the stout arena and then going back to this brew a year after; I will pass in the future. But count me in for CFH"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very good version of the style. Not one of the best but certainly worthy of honorable mention."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall one of the more interesting stouts out there. Definitely a sipper."
"Definitely a must try. Have a second bottle that I'm going to continue cellaring to see how it matures."
""
""
"Great, great beer. Nothing that would normally jut out & stick you (heat, bitterness, sweetness) - it's all melded very well. The carbonation, really, is my only critique. I normally don't like a strong alcohol presence, but here I think it works great & ties everything together without getting fusel or unwieldy."
"O - Even with all of the newer BA stouts out there, this one still impresses. It has a ton of flavor and it is well balanced. You get chocolate, caramel, and vanilla sweetness while still getting a nice oak spice presence. Everything just works together well in this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer. It doesn't seem to get the love of some of the other imperial stouts, but for my palate it is just so darn good. It dials back the crazy, super-high alcohol, noticeable oak/barrel/spirit elements of beers like BCBS and BT, but still provides a load of flavor and complexity. It has a bit of an ""iron fist in a velvet glove"" character. Plenty of concentration and flavor, but not the borderline syrup/high viscosity apparent in other stouts. Don't get me wrong--I love BCBS and BT, but this is another take on the style that is just as good."

"O: Very good. This was recommended to me while I was looking for Angels Share and/or Deliverance. This comes very very close. I don't drink bourbon barrel aged beers often but they do make a great choice on occasion. Great beer but not for the weak hearted."
""
"A bang-on BA stout. A few things, namely the body and the acridity of the roasted malt, could be improved, but it is still quite tasty and I really enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Reminds me of sister outfit The Lost Abbey's The Angel's Share but with more barrel, booze, and chocolate. An extremely good, if pricey, barrel-aged stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"2011 vintage. Poured from tap into sniffer at capones in norristown pa. Deep oily thick black color with huuge sweet dark fruit and sugary aromas. Boozey bourbon and vanilla notes. Sweet dried fruit and chocolate toasted malts...vanilla and caramel. Really a lit going on. Awesome brew for sure...one of the better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down dangerously easily, slightly filling, very strong kick, very good representation of style, I like this beer better fresh and I like the original “Old” version better, but this aged “Older” version is a very good beer to sip on for a long time."
""
""
"O - It's a nice take on an Imperial Stout but with the barrel aging adding a vinous quality to the expected bourbon barrel flavors. It reminds me of a cross between a port and an imperial stout with more fruit/plum than dark roasted grain. It's a big beer and a nice sipper but I'd rather have a Parabola."
""
""
"Is Older Viscosity worth the $ 17.00 for one 12.7 (375 ml) oz corked bottle? I had to get it mailed from California. Yup, but not for everday consumption."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I think i preferred the regular old viscosity to this one, but both were big, boozy beers."
""
""
""
"O: world class barrel aged imperial stout. Worth the large price tag this does not disappoint. I won't be able to taste anything for a week after having this Goliath of a beer"
""
""
""
""

"Intensely boozy but such a smooth, rich and tangy flavor. Lots of burnt sugar. This reminds me of a flan custard with the vanilla and caramelized sugar. Woody and a little smoky. It's a thick mouthful with some pleasing stickiness. A great sipping brew and one of the best barrel-aged beers I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A very delicious barrel aged stout from Port/Lost Abbey. It's refined, smooth, bold, big and just wonderful. It definitely is worthy of the accolades and while it's expensive for the size, it's a solid choice that ages very well."
"Fortunately, once in my strong beer tulip glass, the heady dark fruit and chocolate taste overcomes all trepidation. This is a late night slow sipper. Enjoy"

"O: Wow, this is one hot beer. 10x hotter than fresh BCBS even though this has a couple years on it. Bourbon bomb for sure. I normally wouldn't mind but the bourbon doesn't taste that high quality unfortunately. I love big stouts but the roasted malt characteristics are basically hiding under all the bourbon. Think I like regular Old Viscosity even better."

"O - Wow. This is a hell of a stout. It has the perfect blend of bourbon, coffee, a modest amount of chocolate and vanilla flavors. I'd suggest serving this one a little chilled, but it's still good room temperature. If I ever get the opportunity to pick up another, you better believe I will! Cheers!"

"An incredible beer as far as taste and aroma goes. Deep complexity and broad balance of component ingredients. Too bad there isn't a thicker, longer lasting head sitting atop this brew, but then it's ultimately up to the taste. A gargantuan dark ale; thick, chewy, and very delectable..."

"2013 Vintage: For being so fresh this beer was so complex. Huge oak character, boozy, bur not over the top, lots of caramel and coconut from the bourbon barrels. Well done! Tasted like it had been aged for years. Can't wait to age the 2nd bottle for a few years."

"O – This is a good stout, and this was a really fun thing to do. I’ve never had the same beer from different years at the same time. Really the biggest difference that I could see was the amount of bourbon character. The newer vintage was much more bourbon-forward, bordering on hot, while the older version was much smoother and more balanced. Getting some age also added some complexity and allowed the malt characteristics to develop into something special. Overall, I liked both of the vintages for what they were and I’m so glad that I got to try them both! Thanks, Jason!"

"An almost perfect barrel aged imperial stout. Thank god for Lost Abbey's popular older brother, Port Brewing. Angel's Share gets beat up by its bigger and stronger and cooler older brother Older Viscosity. It goes down like water with a perfect explosion of bourbon in your mouth balanced out by a smooth and seductive chocolate and cherry flavor that makes you forget your even drinking a beer. Almost none of the alcohol flavor that the nose would suggest. It was truly brewed by masters of their craft. A real accomplishment of brewing. Brew on Port, and don't take any guff from those swine at Lost Abbey. You will always be the cooler older brother"

"A: Cork and cage add a nice touch, viscosity seems like an appropriate name given the apparent thickness of the beer, only a touch of head along the edge of the glass, dark brown to black – 4.00, S: Strong oak noticeable from a few feet away, bourbon is also present but a little more subdued, wonderful charring, tons of baker’s chocolate and vanilla – 4.75, T: Booze is very apparent, some bitter chocolate, rum soaked raisins, dark coffee and cream – 4.50, M: Creamy with slight prickliness from the alcohol, medium body – 4.25, D: The alcohol is a touch overwhelming but beyond this Older Viscosity is a standout beer – 4.00"

"O - I don't even like bourbon but this beer is awesome. Very, very well done. It's intensely delicious and enjoyable."

"Pours jet black with a small tan head. In the aroma, oaky, roasty, and big malts. In the taste, big alcohol, dry oakiness, rich and malty. A small bite and a medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, with a dry roasted malt in the aftertaste. Big, rich, roasty, a bit boozy, but great."

"I first had Old Viscosity when I was a neophyte beerophile, and it exploded my head at that time. Now, five years later, while I'm less prone to headsplosioning, it brings me back to the elation and excitement that I had at that time. It is a very very good beer on its own, but the memories it elicits push it into rare territory for me"

"Overall- Super solid, I wish it was available for me. I'm not sure I'd drink a ton of it given the price tag, but it's certainly something I would buy each year!"

"13 is fresh and bright but might do well with a bit of age. 11 is good but near flat and not as good as 10. 10 still has its carb and has the most balanced and integrated flavors but is showing its age. Do not age it any longer. 09 was gross. I’d say 10 and 11 are close, with 10 being better, and 13 is drinking good fresh. Would have been interesting to see how 12 was. Cheers."

"Trade from burg at the Swamp Head release. Thanks! Pours black with no head, not as thick as a stout but not thin either. Big bourbon vanilla aroma with some black licorice and chocolate. Thick velvety mouthfeel with nearly no carbonation at all. Thicker than it looked on the pour wow. Big sweet vanilla oak. Lots of bourbon. Definite bit of licorice and hints of cocoa. Lingering and long ladting vanilla on the palate. Lots going on here and a surefire sipper. Old Viscosity was decent, but this really takes it to a new level. Awesome beer."

"Super dark with a medium brown head. Huuuge bourbon nose. Buttery, boozy barrels. Same with the taste. Bourbon dominates in a pleasant manner. Some remnants of a stout, with roasty and sweet malt but the barrels come through as soon as it hits your tongue and stays with you into the finish. But the finish is nice in that it has others flavors such as a sweet dark chocolate and woody/earthy qualities. I really enjoy the bourbon barrel notes because they contribute a true depth of flavor without overpowering or being too boozy. The base beer and its flavors are discernable as the beer warms up so I love that you can taste the difference and enjoy the improvements. Super complex when its given time to warm... to cold out of the tap. I wish all bourbon tasted like this. It's a phenomenal beer but an even better barrel-aged stout."

"O - One of the better BBA stouts I've had. I love the bourbon forward smell, and the great combination of flavors this one has. There is almost no sign of alcohol, which I'm gonna again assume is from the aging. Great, great brew! Would definitely buy again if given the opportunity."

"T: A rich sweetness starts the taste off, full of chocolate cake, fudge and vanilla, but it's constantly beaten back by a great, heavy bourbon note. The bourbon leaves a dryness on the tongue as well as flavors of charred wood, burnt espresso and dark chocolate. It's a touch boozy without ever feeling too hot. Really well done. One of the better bourbon barrel aged stouts I've had."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a terrific barrel-aged stout. The chocolate and bourbon notes lead the way to a flurry of other delicious flavors such as the dark fruits, vanilla, toffee, caramel and toffee. Everything from the pitch-black pour to the medium-heavy mouth-feel make this one a winner."

"fantastic brew. I find this to have quite a different flavor profile than many of the barrel-aged stouts out there, and the bourbon barrel comes through nicely"
"DARK!! Black as night. Thick syrupy sipper. Boozy bourbon nose with tons of chocolate and vanilla. This beer tastes like it smells. Warm boozy bourbon vanilla with chocolatey love and and some almondy smoke finish. Very smooth for what it is. This would become a perfect stout with a couple years of age. Great beer to keep you warm on a cold winter night. Drink in a wide mouth glass to get the full aromatics."

"Overall this is very good. With nearly 24 months on it, this is a nice beer. I""d grab another in a second. Cheers."
"O - maybe my recent BA Pt5 taste has spoiled me, I found it way to boozy and hot, wasnt impressed. I actually appreciate the non-BA version better. The non version hides the ABV with taste very well!! I have been in love with Lost Abbey recently and was really hoping this one would deliver."
""
"A rustic slumbering monster of a dessert beer which cellars well (the disparate elements become better and better integrated, while the alcohol burn dissipates somewhat)."

"D - Definitely a sipper. The 12% ABV makes its presence know. A good stout, but lacks subtlety and drinkablility I've come to expect."
"O: never had this one fresh, so it's hard for me to know how much this brew has changed while it has aged. but I will say that this is drinking phenomenally right now. it's not very complex, but the balance is fantastic. very dangerous at 12% too. and I'm not picking up any hints of alcohol burn whatsoever."

"I can't help but gush about this beer: it's a pretty amazing stout. It's one of the smoothest 12% BA stouts I've had and I'm sure the two years in the bottle didn't hurt it any. I'd be curious to try this somewhat fresh to compare the differences."

"O: Other than the bourbon flavors, there is very little alcohol present in the taste or aroma of this beer. This is a phenomenal beer and the bourbon flavors/aromas are great, it developed a ton from the barrel aging. I would definitely enjoy sipping on this one for quite a while as it is very tasty but definitely a sipping beer."
"O: Apart from the bourbon, I don't get any taste of alcohol in this beer. As such, it hides its alcohol exceptionally well considering the strength. I love the taste of this beer and could sip it all night long."

"O - I actually really like this beer; I've had Old Viscosity and wasn't terribly impressed; however, I dig the booziness on this one...it's a sipping-man's stout for sure; a little less than impressive appearance but the flavors are solid and the heat is kind of an interesting challenge"
"O - An average bourbon barrel imperial stout, at best. Drinks like a nearly-flat Mad River Steelhead stout. Flavor profile isn't bad, but it certainly isn't interesting or exciting."
""
"O- love the nose on this beer but wish it wasn't as hot as it is. First time having this beer so maybe you need to age this one for at least a couple years?"
""
"Overall, an outstanding beer, but not one I would trade for again. It's far too expensive and has too little roastiness and too much fruit on the palate to please me. The flavor really took me by surprise. It drinks as much like a quad as it does like a stout. Still, very glad I had an opportunity to try it."

""
""
"I will definitely give this another chance if I can find a different vintage."

"OV seems like port may have tried to run before they could walk.. It's recommended, but very rough and missing some ties to many loose ends. Goes down easy, but not quite as easy knowing it was $17"

"O: This is a big, big beer. But very very good. Highly recommended."
""
""
""

"Overall, this is excellent Imperial Stout, and a must-try for fans of the style. The care and passion that has gone into this beer is palpable, and the skill required to so excellently barrel-age an already fine stout is commendable. As a whole the flavors are well developed, finely nuanced, nicely balanced between ash and sugar, bourbon and bread, vanilla and caramel, with only a slightly heavy alcoholic vapor and a strangely average mouthfeel marring the experience. Well worth the price."
"O: Quite tasty, liked it more than Old Viscosity for sure. Pleased to see this bottle held nicely over 4-5 years."
""
""
"O: At first I was a little doubtful but I feel this beer tasted much, much better at room temp than cold. It is almost like drinking wine or port. I enjoyed it more and it got more interesting as it warmed up. I prefer a little sweeter stouts but I must say this is a great, great beer. This is one that should be cellared for some years. I can't believe how much it changed with some time. A must try for BA stout lovers, but I must say it still had that Barley Wine taste in it."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this one. There was a bunch of complimentary flavors that combined and made it quite interesting. The oak and vanilla bourbon notes were very smooth. I would have more given the chance."
""
""
"Overall this is a very delicious beer as Old Viscosity is solid on its own. Aging stouts in bourbon barrels for 3-6 months seems to be the optimal amount of time. Port hits it quite right with this one!"
"Just delicious. Have had this beer on several occasions now, and it's always a treat. Furthermore, as this bottle well shows, the beer is quite ageable as well. Altogether excellent. I believe I just may need to have a second glass."
""
""
""
""
"Straight up pour and only a thin brown head that vanishes leaving no lace. Black color, no highlights. Very light carbonation and heavy bodied. Nose is alcohol, almost like cognac and flavor is sweet oak and alcohol. Some alcohol burn at finish. Expensive at $17.99 for a caged & corked 375ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
""
""
""
"Overall this is one bad-a$$ beer. Probably one of the best stouts out there."
""
" I actually already had 1 2010 Vintage and I picked up 3 of these 2011 Vintages when I saw them with the intent of aging 1 or 2 because I had heard good things about Older Viscosity. Boy am I glad I did. I might even pick up more if I still can. This beer is wonderful fresh and I think it will age wonderfully as well. Some people, especially those who don't like Bourbon, might be turned off by this when it's relatively fresh. If you do like Bourbon and you like Stouts, this one is definitely worth a try. If you don't like Bourbon but you can still appreciate Barrel aging, this one might be worth your time also. Very nice slow sipper."

"O- This was a very nice bourbon barrel aged stout. The bourbon definitely added a nice quality to this beer. It wasn't too strong, but added a nice sweetness and was still very easy to drink. I highly recommend this beer if you like bourbon barrel aged stouts."
""
"So thick and so smooth. Lots of vanilla and wood on this one. Very mildly boozy, but it all comes together and works. Love the complexities; love the burn. It just works so beautifully. Ends up being one of those beers I just want to sip and not worry about taking notes on."
"O - A fantastic beer that is a bit too stout for my liking, hurting the drinkability. I would love to revisit this for a cool winter evening but the price will keep me at a distance."
"O- I think bourbon beers are tops with me. The amount of flavour and character they instil in a beer is my absolute favourite."
"Overall: Pretty good bourbon barrel stout. I would say its very similar to Central Waters Peruvian Morning, but with a little more booze. I really liked it, but if I'm going to pay that much money for a Port Brewing/Lost Abbey offering, I'd rather get Angel's Share or Deliverance."
"Overall this is every bit as good as I expected. A real sipper of an imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: one of the best beers I've ever had."
"O: Great beer, but oversmooth mayhap. Too much bourbon, pretty excellent stout, and I think that I prefer the Old Viscosity. This is too sweet and too flat, with zero hop presence. Still, recommended."
""
"O - You had me at bourbon barrel aged! Leaps & bounds better than older viscosity."

"o: fantastic. dangerously delicious and drinkable at 12%. highly recommended for the barrel aged imperial stout enthusiast."

""

"edit: recently had a four year old bottle, and it matures quite well. the flavor may fade a little, but so does the alcohol, so take the good with the bad here. smooth as hell. also, its funny reading this now, nearly forgot about the hard drive, what a bastard!"
""
""
"M/O - Very viscous for a beer and damn near flat with just a hint of the right amount of carbonation. Finishes semi-sweet and slightly dries the palate. Slight chewy malt flavors stick around with a roasted wood on the palate. In summary, a great example of a barrel treated stout without anything else added. One of the best."
""
""
"D: Overall, this is an over the top unique beer. This is taking barrel aged stout and running with it. A sipping beer, or one to split, even at 12 oz."
"O - Really nice beer here. Worth the ridiculous price tag? Probably not, but I'm glad to have been able to try it anyway! Maybe another year of sitting on this one would have helped smooth the taste to perfection."
""
""
"O= Flat beer from a professional brewery is inexcusable. This is an avoidable beer if you ever see it. The flavors are good and I actually think despite being flat it is more enjoyable than the original version but hey.... it's flat."
"originally reviewed: 11-22-2010"
""
"O - a very well made barrel aged beer. While it may not live up to its name in mouthfeel but it sure has flavor. Alcohol is a little strong now but I feel it will integrate nicely over time."
""
"Overall - So impressive. Definitely one of the best barrel characters out there. Maybe not the best stout behind it, but still awesome."
""
"did i mention bourbon? yes lots of it. outstanding, but only at the price paid. i have passed on this every time at the insane bottle prices and will continue to do so."
""
"DOA"
"O: Tasty stuff, I wonder if aging this will tone down the bourbon a notch"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability – If you’re into big bourbon beers, you might like this one; it’s a bit more bourboney than I prefer (although I do like The Bruery's ""Fruet"" because it is sweet)."
""
"I paired this with some Godiva dark chocolate after dinner and it was sublime... Had this been a little more full on the palate, it would have been flying in rare air... As is, it's still a damn solid beer that I'd love to drink on a nippy November evening..."
""
""
"No head on this one. Aroma is atrong with brown sugar, vanilla, roasted malt and chocolate. More of the same in the flavor which is a little too sweet for my liking. Mostly related to the vanilla, brown sugar and licorice notes. This one also has a subtle smokey note to both the aroma and flavor. Although it appears thick its actually thinner than one would expect. Light carbonation. A touch too sweet but very drinkable otherwise with the booze well hidden."
"D - Dark and complex with a distinct contribution from the oak. The sweet finish is a bit too much for me and it contributes to a flabby finish with an unpleasant sugary note that lingers on the palate. Not bad, but I don't know that this really lives up to the reputation that it has developed."
"O - excellent barrel aged stout. I wish this one was more readily available in my area."
"M: Chewy, chewy, chewy. The lack of carbonation, high ABV, and big malt character make this thing a beast on the palate. Tough to finish a 375ml, but outstanding complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
"Low B"
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. The bourbon really adds a great element to the beer and compliments the chocolate malts nicely."
"I'm so glad Port Brewing now distributes to NJ and I was truly surprised that this gem lasted on the shelves for weeks. Next year will be different as the word spreads in the Garden State."

"2010 bottle reviewed in late 2011. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours absolutley black with absolutely no carbonation or head. Nice aroma of dark and roasted malt, whiskey. Medium to heavy bodied. Flavor is rich and mellow. Dark malts, chocolate, whisky, dark fruit and oak. Finishes with a strong whiskey flavor. The lack of carbonation is too bad, but the flavor is excellent and well integrated. I look forward to finding out what a newer, carbonated bottle will taste like."
""
""
"I poured this into my DFH snifter to find a deep dark body that was black as night. The alcohol hits you upfront first in the nose with a lot of bourbon. The taste was not what I was expecting. To me this came off as more of an American Strong Ale than an Imperial Stout. I was a disappointed and I hope to get another bottle in the future and give it another shot."
"O- Great beer nuff said."
""
"I think this is a fine enough brew, but it is too heavy on the wood character. It is also herbally, which just isn't what I'm into."
""
"Most definitely a sipper. Seems more like an American Strong Ale than Imperial Stout. This has not been my favorite Uber Impy Stout, but it's pretty unique and memorable."
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a dark brown, almost black coloring with a chestnut highlighting around the edges and no head. Aromas of booze, blackstrap molasses, hazelnut, and dark chocolate, with a steady effervescence. Great oily cling along the walls of the snifter as it swirls. Flavors are rich and oaky, with a warming, boozey undertone and earthy blending with date fruitiness. Licorice and smokey undertones, with a smooth richness and umami. The aftertaste is the roasty, boozey, and molasses blending, both rich and smooth. The finish is slightly cloying, but incredibly rich and smooth. Delicious!"
""
""
""
"O - Nice big beer. Big alcohol, big flavor. Pretty balanced in the imperial sense."
""
"O: An excellent imperial stout that is just some cellar time and a bit of carbonation away from being outstanding. The flavors are very bold and enjoyable, making this a great sipper."
""
"O - Let down by its carbonation, but a very flavoursome brew."
""
""
""

"Overall: this is great slow drinking beer that is loaded with flavor. Everyone should try this one at least once."
""
"O: Amazing beer. I couldn't figure out how they could make it taste and smell like it did. Quite the experience! Great dessert beer!"
"Overall it definately took the length of the beer to get into this but well put together. It is very intense top shelf"

""
""
"Overall, this brew is badass and huge. Port took a great base beer and made it even better. The barrels are really going to work here."
""
"very good but at $15+ or so there are plenty of other barrel aged stouts that deliver just as much."
""
""
"Overall, this is a top class beer. Not to many breweries out there are making beers like this. Yes there are some out there but this is a classic on the west coast made by a brewer known for Hopped up ales and belgians. Great beer but the price is harsh but worth it just once."
""
""
"O: Freaking delicous beer!"
"Overall: Holy cow what a beverage. This sipper is completely phenomenal. An enormous thank you to Amy for this one. My first real experience of bourbon barrel aging - and I'm hooked."
"Bottled printed ""Vintage 2011"" poured to a NBB Globe glass. The beer pours ultra thick similar to motor oil with a thin mocha head. Some retention and lacing. Very nice aroma of a mix of vanilla, oil, bourbon, roasted malt with a hint of hear. Very nice. The flavor follows suit: roasted malt provides a pleasant sweet background with a mild bitterness, the bourbon, oak, vanilla flavors work very well together. There is a little heat but this is very well balanced and quite complex. Adequate carbonation, full bodied, rich, warm, and very smooth. Overall, this is an outstanding beer! I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it."
"Overall, simply delicious. Not the most complex beer out there but definately worth a try. Looking forward to aging this and trying 'oldest' viscosity."
""
""
""
"BA stouts can be touch and go for me, and this does a nice job of not being overwhelming in any respect. A little underwhelming in some, but I'll take the former as a declaration of a good and tasty brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this beer tastes great but could definitely be improved in the body by being a little thicker. That said, the carbonation on this is pretty good. After all the jokes on lost abbey carbonation, this one is just about right. I know the price tag on this one is about 20 but overall I think it is a nice treat. The flavors are well balanced and there is no ashiness involved."
""
"Very complex and very delicious, a real nice double."
"I scored it a 5 for overall, so what else can I say? This is a great beer. Not sure if bottles are as near perfect as what I had on tap, but what I had was precious."
"Overall. Loved this one. Expensive at $17, but a really nice beer."
"A rich malty experience. Complex dark fruit and woody notes soaked in bourbon. I like a beer that's big and hot, with intense flavor. This one fits the bill perfectly. A tasty treat."
"O: A beautiful malty taste profile in this extremely drinkable Imperial Stout. I drank it immediately after a Kuhnhenn Bourbon Barrel Fourth Dementia and it is tough to pick a favourite out of those two beers."
"My emotions were mixed on this beer. I sipped for over an hour but this was slow and hard to finish. I drank it straight from the cellar, so all the flavors were well opened up already. While that allowed me to get the most out of it, this just is a bit over the top in its alcohol presence. And not the bourbon, just a generic booziness. Cellaring should certainly benefit a beer like this to mellow and blend itself. Would revisit but I can confidently say at this point it is NOT worth its hefty price tag."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is thick like cough syrup and sweet too. A bit too boozey I think. It takes away from the taste with it being so harsh. Bought one of there smaller 12oz bottles which is just right. Too much alcohol for me to enjoy to the fullest extent of enjoyment."
""
""
"-JH-"
"O: 100th review, and what a beer to review! The ONE other beer I would say that rivals, or is the equal of KBS. Absurd and ridiculous bourbon, coffee, chocolate, all barrel aged and amagalmated with time. Thanks to skyroach for the trade. Will seek this beer and purchase with extreme fervor."
"O: This is a sweet, thick imperial stout. It's almost to the point where I'd call it an American Strong Ale, though. It's quite light with low roast/coffee flavor."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers."
""
""
""
"O: Judging from the excellent appearance and nose I was rather disappointed with the taste and especially the mouthfeel. Although it's very complex it's also very boozey and the mouthfeel is really thin for an Imperial Stout. Warming effect is extremely pleasant. Chocolate and vanilla notes are very nice but they tend to get covered up with the booziness."
"Final thought - $16-19 a 375ml is a bit insane, until you taste it and realize how enjoyable it is! Great beer from a place I really enjoy. Thanks as always port brewing!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A decidedly good beer, perhaps excellent even. Ultimately this beer fails to knock me down in amazement. A good brew, to be sure - much improved on tap - but not a game changer. I'm glad I got to have this beer on tap (finally) but, much like its bottled brethren, this brew would likely get edged out in favor of another RIS."
""
"The flavor of this brew is off the charts. Bourbon and alcoholic flavors are in your face. Malted chocolate presence. Sweet, thick, and chewy mouthfeel. Nicely carbonated. This HUGE stout is so intence yet so creamy smooth at the same time. Huge beer= huge marks!"
"O-Classic example of the style. Wonderful balance and richness. Great dessert beer. Another nearly perfect beer from Port Brewing."
""
"O: A really good barrel-forward stout with a good level of complexity. My main problem is that the body isn't as thick and chewy as I was expecting as well as the fact that a little oxidation is noticeable. Also not quite as malty as some other big stouts. Enjoyable for sure, though the price tag does make you want to walk away from the bottle."

"D: [DRINKABILITY] Older Viscosity is a bourbon bomb and it makes for a beer with only average drinkability. Blending would have served this batch well. All things considered, this beer isn't bad, just mediocre in its class, and not as great as it could be. Frankly, I prefer Old Viscosity."
""
"Man, this went well with quality chocolate ice cream and cookies."
""
""
"O - A very good beer. I would like a bit more carbonation, but very nice aroma and taste. I'll have to try this side by side with BB 4D someday. I know they aren't even the same style, but I couldn't get over how much this reminded me of that beer."
""
""
"O - Well done, I could see improvement though, be it in the recipe or even in the age."
""
"Aromas of toffee and espresso, some cocoa and sweet cream comes through too. Tastes of Italian roast and espresso crema, dark chocolate and gourmet toffee, with a sweet, warming bourbon note playing through the whole sip. It has a great mouthfeel—it’s smooth, not alcoholic but it lets you know it’s a big beer and not to be taken lightly."
""
""
"Very nicely done barrel aged stout, a good balance without being to sweet or messy."

"375 ml caged and corked bottle. I'm not sure what vintage this is because the printing on the label is smudged, but I think it looks like it's either a 2010 or 2011 bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with a small tan head that fizzled away quickly. There's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is sweet and boozy, it smells like dark fruit, caramel, bourbon, vanilla, and some chocolate. I think the taste is the same as the aroma, and all the flavors mesh well and none of them overpower the other ones. This beer is definitely one of the sweeter ones I've had lately. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's oily and coating with a moderate level of carbonation. At $16.99 a bottle I wouldn't buy it very often, but I think it's a very good brew."

"Good, but not outstanding in the world of barrel aged imperial stouts. The barrel effect is a bit overdone here for my preference. That, along with the relatively high price puts this in the category of beers that I enjoyed but probably won't purchase in the future."
"O- I really enjoyed this. The nose was the standout, and I love that the bourbon wasn't overbearing. Glad to get this on tap first, the bottles seem a bit overpriced."
"Bottle to oversized tulip. 2011 vintage.Looks good; black and thick with no head whatsoever (bourbon effect?). Smells exceptional! One of the best noses on a beer I've encountered. Caramel, bourbon, and malt are all present - nay, prominent! Tastes great too; all of the above items are well-represented, especially the bourbon and the malt. Mouthfeel is good; warm, but that's to be expected, especially because it's this year's version and hasn't aged long. Overall, a great beer that I'd love to have again."
"Quite bourbony. Not much else, but quite nice."
"Overall a delicious beer that I'm thrilled I was able to try. It was an awesome exclamation mark on a great night with friends."
"had the luck of having this in the proper portion. 5oz pour at hop leaf at a very reasonable price. pour has a head that for the amount of alcohol. black as expected. thick as expected. nose is bourbon and nice balance of vanilla and toasted and roasted malt notes. not fruity. accented with hints of vanilla and malt backing. very very smooth. a perfect portion. great to share. great for bourbon sippers."
"O - very good beer and i would like to get more to lay down, the appearance threw me off where i thought it be zero light penetration upon the pour and the aroma was rather below the standard but the taste and mouthfeel were amazing and made up and then some."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Very full body with low carbonation. Sllick. Could possibly use a bit more carbonation ,but not much. Overall, a very nice barrel aged stout. Good qualities from the barrel. Could use a little less sweetness but I don't want to complain too much."
"If you want the barrel flavors to dominate and you like a rich dark fruit sweetness to go with the bourbon this is for you."
"O- Really impressed with the beer, tried it back to back with the old viscosity and the barrel aged version is vastly superior."
"Overall: Definitely a sipper! Was glad, actually, about the smaller bottle size this time. (A 750ml bottle would have been tough to finish in one sitting.) Strangely, as I progressed through the bottle, it seemed as if the booziness became more and more prominent. Overall, though, a very solid barrel-aged brew."
"Overall: This is a fine and complex beer worth trying for any stout lover. Yes, the price is high so you won't be buying this one by the case or even wanting to drink this as a regular beer but it really is worth buying a bottle to savor a well-made beer."
"O : Not a complex beer, but what an explosion of savors ! How powerful this is ! A wonderful brew !"
"Overall: I had a dream last night that I was having this beer with a nice steak. I had to pick up a bottle today, my local store charged me $20 for the bottle so I was afraid to be disappointed. After taking a whiff of this beer it was love at first scent, it is definitely worth the money I paid for it. I know its from the Lost Abbey brewery but I don’t care about the carbonation issues on this one, I have an 09 that is said to be infamously un-carbonated, I cant wait to crack it open and quaff it down!"
"Bottle - Wow!!! This is just a great beer that is worth the money. Lots of bourbon in the nose. The taste is so smooth. It was hard taking my time drinking it, because I really didn’t want to stop. My only issue was that it didn’t coat my glass like I thought a beer called older viscosity would do. But you would be an idiot to pass this beer because of that."
"Looked exactly as it should; black as Satan's heart and hardly any head or carbonation visible. The booze on the nose was noticeable but covered nicely by heavy chocolate and dark fruit notes. Thick and velvety on the tongue, lots of complex flavors running around, I picked up a lot of dark cherry. Overall a great beer, and really glad my first time trying it was on tap."
"O - A pleasure to drink, suburb beer indeed. Definitely worth buying indeed, over and over again. Now I know what is wrong with Holland; we can't brew stuff like this. Its a bloody shame. One of these days I am going to do it myself, mark my words for it."
"The bourbon and barrel aromas have mostly subdued the roast from the base beer, but enhance the cherry, dark fruit and dark chocolate. Smells quite strong, but more along the lines of warm and inviting vs. straight boozy. Modest carbonation seems a perfect match for the slippery, coating body. The barrel-aging has coaxed out pleasant buttery and vanilla flavors and the bourbon is ever present but never overpowering. Roasted malt again seems to be an afterthought, and it's pretty sweet stuff; I reckon half a bottle would be plenty. Lots of complex dark fruit and multilayered chocolate, though. I'm not so sure I wouldn't slightly prefer the Old version, but Older Viscosity is quite an enjoyable sipper."
"O – Beyond belief scrumptiousness – one of my top 5 favorite beers. It’s a sad moment as the final sip winds down… virtually anything I drink after this will pale in comparison. Too bad it’s so expensive, but well worth the stiff price tag every once in a while."
"O-Excellent beer. Almost worth the money but it is still expensive. Nonetheless seek this one out."
"Loads of barrel on this beer but in a good way, a really complex and enjoyable beer that rewards your attention, lots going on, interplay of flavors. With Derek, I can see some old ale here - not roasty enough to be a proper stout - though the barrel helps obscure some of the style lines. Nonetheless, a great evening sipper, a real treat that deserves recognition. Thanks Ian!"
"Imperial stout? I'd call this an old ale... and one of the best."
"This beer is full of complexities. I got multiple waves of flavors and aromas with each sip. Both senses seemed to pick up new things with each waft and sip. It's very good, but I don't think I'd pay the 17$ price tag again when there are more affordable and delicious beers like Goose Island's Bourbon County Brand Stout."
"This is just awesome."
"Overall, why can't I get this in Texas? It's truly enjoyable, I must have spent a half hour on one glass alone just sipping and marveling, I'd buy this by the case. By far one of the best stouts I've ever had."
"Pours like an engine oil (and that's a very beautiful sight). No head. Very dark brown in color - almost completely black. Smells a lot like bourbon, but not too overpowering. A bit of burned caramel in the smell. ""Viscosity"" is a very fitting name. I find this ale to be quite thick. First sip was very powerful. It hit me with everything it had and for a moment I thought I was done. But the more I sip it, the more I come around. Alcohol is not apparent, but it still feels like a very strong beer. Bourbon up front, but what I find absolutely enjoyable is the sweet, chocolatey aftertaste. That is a fine note that after all makes it for a nice, smooth mouthfeel. Generally, this is not my style (not a huge fan of stouts and barleywines and even less of a fan of bourbon), but once in a while it just hits the spot. By the way, I'm tasting the 2009 vintage."
"Overall, extremely good. This is the kind of beer that made the bourbon aged imperial stout such a big part of US craft brewing."
"O- Nose was too alcoholic and hot from the inense bourbon. Taste was much more sweet and complex. Very anise forward and just a big in your face sweet bomb of a stout. I liked the taste, but a little of this one goes such a long way!"
"O: So here's the thing, I can drink this, and would say it's a decent beer. I would argue it is overpriced compared to similar beers. The barrels really come through stronger than I prefer, but they are exactly that - barrels previously having held alcohol. Would I drink again? Absolutely. Will I purchase another bottle? If I find one at the same price ($17/375ml) that is at least two years old then I will. Otherwise, this one can sit on the shelves."
"O: This is tasty but the body detracts from the overall experience for me. The flavors are great and I look forward to drinking the bottle I have."
"O - A really good beer. Super-complex, mega-heady, and stays with ya'! I'm curious to try the Old Viscosity now to see how this beer is cut with some stainless steel ages imperial stout. Probably dangerous for me to approach this 32 oz. growler singlehandedly, but we'll see what happens :)!"
"Overall, it's one I had been wanting to try for a while and I was let down a bit. Not bad by any stretch, but I probably would have been even more disappointed if I paid $15.99 a bottle."
"Overall, I enjoyed the beer. It would have been much better if it had a more creamy, richer mouthfeel. This was overly thin."
"o - overall this is a boozy beer. the stouty parts are very nice, but the booziness is there. a bit thick and heavy. good beer. wasn't really blown away, but i enjoyed this beer. got better as it went and i found myself getting more impressed as i warmed up to the beer more. i wouldn't turn one of these down and might check it out again, but the price point is a bit tough to justify on such a small beer."
"O - a really excellent beer, i absolutely loved it. For fans of barrel aged stuff or fans of stouts, this really does the trick. the price is prohibitive (at least for my income bracket) so i probably won't have another for some time, and that's a huge bummer."
"Overall, I think it is still a fun beer for anyone to try. It certainly shows that the brewer have a very different idea of how he wanted to make his beer. It packs a punch, so it is good one to have if you wanted to take it slow and savor the abundant flavors."
"O - This beer is simply outstanding, likely the best I have ever had. Port and Lost Abbey never fail to let me down and this beer is the cream of the crop in my opinion."
"A wonderful experience with a truly great beer."
"O- An excellent beer, packed with flavor and layers of complexity."
"D: This was one of the better bourbon stouts I've tried. The scent and taste and body were all great. Delicate and complex, but still plenty bold. The alcohol was noticeable but not too strong, and the finish was very smooth, so it was surprisingly easy to drink. The sweet and roasty/burnt flavors were well balanced in this impressive brew. Could probably improve with a few years in the cellar, but great fresh(-ish). Definitely recommended."
"O: One of the best barrel-aged imperial stouts I've had, and I've had a LOT of them. Excellent scent and very good flavors and texture make this exceptionally well rounded. I wish I had tried it years ago when I first had the opportunity, but I had though it was too expensive at the time. Buy it if you get the chance, and save it for a special occasion. Like a Saturday. Or night time. Or your anniversary. It's that good."
"Overall I think this is the closest thing I have had to The Abyss (my only 5 score). This is exceptional Barrel Aged Stout. I must thank matttyce for this bottle. Seek this out at all cost!!!"
"Overall I think this is a great imperial stout. Its thick complex and flavorful. The only knock I have on it other then the price is the sheer amount of alcohol you can taste in it dampening a complex palate. Would be interesting to see how this one would turn out after a couple of years in the cellar."
"Overall, a delicious and complex beer."
"Is Tomme Arthur the new Dom Perignon? It may sound silly but it's certainly food for thought. It is largely a topic of comedic value to many beer aficionados the disposition of a flat beer. Unbeknownst to most is the unique and choice flavor, in extension possibilities of beer without carbonation. Some beers benefit from the bubbles, but to shun all of the beer born flat? By God, this beer has taught me not only enjoyability without the pang of the pop, but beer can still be simply world class. Lost Abbey may be the forerunner in a new breed of beer. In one way or another, bravo."
"D-Pretty easy drinking for a 12% stout; the alcohol warmth isn't too aggressive and its right where I want it. A very solid beer that I'd love to have more than once, but cost is way too high to enjoy more than once a year."
"Overall: Super drinkable! Tasty, delicious. I want more. I pounded a bottle of this in no time, barely feeling it. This is what barreled big beers ought to be, but alas, the price is an issue. $16.99 for 12.7 fluid ounces? Gimme a break!"
"Pours an opaque black with a small 1/2 inch dark khaki head that fades to an oily film on the top of the beer. Random spotting and streaking of lace forms all over the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark fruits, wood, vanilla, bourbon, and slight soy sauce. Taste is of dark roasted malt, bourbon, vanilla, wood, and alcohol. There is a boozy burn in the back of the throat and a mild bitterness on the palate. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a thick and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but you can definitely feel the 12% ABV while you are sipping on this one. A good beer to share with someone else for sure."
"O - Great beer, I would think at maybe 2 years it would be even better."
"Lighter body, but a good amount of carbonation very complex. Alcohol is certainly felt, but not overwhelming. Amazing beer."
"Pours jet black with a fizzy white head. On the nose: Bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, with some coffee and a bit of burnt wood. On the tongue it is hot up front from the bourbon but it gets sweet from the chocolate and vanilla. Bourbon kicks back in at the end. The chocolate coats the tongue and is very nice. This is an incredible Imp stout. The balance between the flavors is awesome, the only problem is the $!! GRR!"
"Overall Impression- Very strong, very real, very much need to get Port distributed to Missouri! This beer was the best I had on the CA Road Trip by far! Huge bourbon and espresso attributes and one of the best Imperial Stouts I've had thus far. I would recommend but you may have trouble getting your hands on this brew. Can't get much better than this!"
"O - This would probably do better with age. I liked it, but it seemed like a lot of the flavors weren't blending well enough together. I'll try aging one next time."
"A really interesting and delicious sipper with an astoundingly good aroma. Next time I have this, I'll make sure it's a bottle that's been put away for a while."
"o-not super impressed with this beer."
"D-very nice. I would drink this beer again. The beer is a nice representation of the style."
"O - An excellent beer. I feel like there was something missing to put this one really over the top and make it a perfect beer. Still an excellent beer that is worth seeking out."
"Overall: This is a very tasty beer, would drink it again. My bottle however, was very flat with almost no carbonation. Also the alcohol is not too well hidden, but besides that, very very good"
"375 ml bottle; 2008 vintage via Sinner’s Club; thin jet black with fluffy dark brown head fading slowly; intense nose of chocolate cake, oak, bourbon and candy apples; texture is thin and a little oily on the teeth and glass; decadent roast with creamy bourbon, chocolate; level of bourbon is just about perfect to me as it complements rather than dominates; Old Viscosity itself is a rich, decedent brew and this just ups the ante; chocolate and dark fruits with honey, oatmeal and vanilla; very nice"
"That said, a lot of bourbon barrel-aged beers are highly rated solely because the intensity and departure the barrel affords them. For me, the rose already came off that bloom; long gone are the days when I was impressed solely by a beer because it was barrel-aged. But to this day Older Viscosity fascinates me. Offering bourbon as a detail on the edifice not the foundation, it is perhaps the most refined such beer I've come across. Worth every penny."
"Poured dark brown with a moderate frothy brown head that mostly diminished with fair lacing. Moderate to heavy toasted malt, woody with a small alcohol aroma. Full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Heavy bourbon woody and malt sweet flavor with a heavy bittersweet finish of long duration. This is a standout beer."
"On tap at Hops and Pie, 10oz for $8 is not bad considering that a 375ml bottle costs $17. Dark black, no surprises there. Smells fantastic like chocolates and a very subtle barrel and bourbon character. the taste is equally fantastic, chocolate, slightly boozy but the barrel and bourbon never take over. This is a very well done beer, other breweries should take notes because most barrel-aged beers are all barrel and booze. Oh, it wasn't flat either."
"I had this one on tap this evening at Hops and Pie. I've had this one before (bottles) and while enjoyable, I haven't been all that impressed. I am now. Poured a deep, dark black color with a good tan head. Aromas of bourbon, roasted malt, dark fruits and dark chocolate. On the palate, this one is full bodied, with big (yet very balanced) bourbon flavors, along with roasted malt, dark chocolate, plums, vanilla and oak. Excellent balance, drinkable and delicious. I didn't want to finish the glass."
"Older Viscosity is walking on the line of very good and elite, and I think would make an excellent cigar beer. Yet despite such accolades, I remain very hesitant to pull the trigger on a bottle for two reasons: the $17 pricetag for a 375 ml bottle at a store (versus $7 for 10 ounces on-tap at a bar), and the brewery's reputation of erratic carbonation control in its bottles. Looks like I'll have to wait to find it on-tap again."
"O- I love this beer. So delicious. Only complaint is the price tag, paid 15.99 for the 12.7 oz. bottle."
"Overall: This beer is very enjoyable. Great flavor profile with a nice amount of bitter chocolate which I love. Very well balanced and just the right amount of heat that it shouldn't turn you away."
"D- overall this was a very tasy brew. Glad i seeked this out and wish i had more. This jut has such a nice bourbon and chocolate flavor and goes down soo smooth. def. try this brew"
"2011 Vintage. Pours a pitch black, thick liquid with a small tan head that disappears quickly. Scent is AMAZING! Inviting bourbon aroma with sweet vanilla and toffee. Some nice chocolate aromas also. Taste is JUST AS AMAZING! Thick bourbon, chocolate, and coffee flavors! For being fresh, this beer is amazingly well-balanced and smooth. The flavors all blend together so well. Vanilla is lingering on the tongue after each sip. Mouthfeel is thick and engine-oliy. Drinkability is high. Overall, this beer is fantastic, to say the lease. I'm aging one bottle, but I feel like I will regret it because of how well it is drinking now."
"O - Really had heard about this a lot it lives up to the hype for me. You have to understand I think or want to like a bit of burbon spirits to really get into it. If you don't that's okay this is a must have for anyone wanting to try one of the best out there."
"A little too hot and boozy for me, and I would like to see a little more beer in my beer. The harsh alcohol flavors in the middle are also unwelcome. Overall Older Viscosity has its flaws, but it is better than the plain old, and it isn't a bad sipper."
"OVERALL: This is an absolutely outstanding beer. Since the Goose Island sell out I have been bummed that buying BCBS will create a moral dilemma for me, but the OV comes close to substituting for it. If you can get your hands on this stuff, do it. Also, thanks to Robb at Papi's Pizza in Estes Park, CO for the bottle. I don't think I would have even known about it if he had not so graciously offered me a bottle on the house last time I was there."
"O - An awesome smelling and tasting beer. If you like hot bourbon barrel aged beers like I do, this one is a must try."
"O: This ranks in my top 10 favorite stouts!"
"Overall - I love this beer and if I could afford it I'd drink it everyday. Go get you some!"
"O (D) - this is a big beer, tasty, and interesting. too expensive."
"My only complaint is the price point: ~$15 for a 375ml is a little steep. For comparison, that's about four times the price of a KBS, or about twice as much per oz. as Parabola."
"Pours a thick dark dark brown with a nice reddish tint. A nice bit of light brown head. Incredibly thick and viscous. Smells heavily of bourbon. Way overpowering but great. Tastes chocolatey and sweet. Tons of oak and vanilla from the bourbon. Very very potent. Overall top notch"
"O: This beer can simply be explained as too hot. The alcohol bleeds into every aspect of this beer. I had to really pull back in order to focus on the separate categories, it wasn't easy. Even then the alcohol factor couldn't be avoided. All in all a lack of balance is the undoing of grandpa viscosity."
"O: It's hard for me to separate anymore my independent evaluation of a beer and the context of the many drinks I've had. Honestly, seems like another drop in the bucket of barrel aged stouts-- booziness, dark fruits, spices, chocolate, coffee; as much as I love them I feel myself getting bored. Looking at it without the boredom, it has pour mouthfeel, seems too hot and doesn't mask the alcohol very well, and while aging might mellow it I can only see it becoming a BCBS at best, which alone isn't that high of a bar. One of the poorest of the best stouts out there."
"Overall, I don't think I'd drink this again for a while. It's too heavy and undercarbed to be fully appreciated for it's nice flavor."
"Great beer, super complex, and definitely worth seeking out."
"Freaking fantastic. One of the more bourbon-heavy beers I’ve had but still integrates very well and doesn’t completely take over the base beer. Incredible aroma, one of those beers where I’ll keep the last ounce in the glass for as long as I can so I can keep taking it in. Rich and complex, a treat all around and worth the price tag IMHO."
"For such dark, heavily-flavored stuff, Older Viscosity goes down easily. When carbonated, it has its place among the top barrel-aged stouts."
"This pours out as a very dark looking black color. The light can barely get through on this one. The head wasn't very big but it did leave a light lacing. The smell of the beer is heavily roasted, a little smokey, some bourbon, vanilla and a bit of earth. The taste is strong with some booze, molasses, bourbon, chocolate, and some earthy burnt malts. The mouthfeel is pretty thick, very nice body on this beer. Overall I found this beer to be very good all around."
"This beer pours a a thick black color with a very very small trace of tan head. The aroma is strong with chocolate, raisins and alcohol. The taste is similar, with strong notes of chocolate, raisins and a slight note of alcohol as well. The mouthfeel is velvety but and nicely carbonated. Overall and amazing beer."
"O- not big fan of this brewery but was blown away by this one. I will by trying to get my hands on more right away."
"O- Tasty, almost similar to a GIBCS."
"2011 Vintage"
"Unfortunately this is a review of a fresh one, so the score is not as high as it would otherwise be. If you score only one bottle of this brew, try to wait before opening."
"Overall, this is a fine brew, a great combination of a big ale and barrel aging. The bourbon at times dominated but never got to overpowering. I like the idea of taking a great beer and barrel aging a portion of it rather than the whole thing, so that the base can shine through a little more. This is a perfect example of just that."
"Pours a dark brown-black, thick like oil, little to no head, just a thin layer of bubbles. Big malts in the aroma, and bourbon-soaked oak right up front. REALLY packs a punch. Rich chocolate taste, molasses, tar, vanilla beans, and hints of dark, dried fruit. The 12.5%ABV is no lie, and you can feel and taste every bit of it. But it doesn't cut back on the general flavor at all. Thick, and viscous, full-bodied; strong, but very drinkable. I really loved this one."
"overall: high quality"
"Overall, this is one of the best barrel aged brews I've had to date. It is everything that I want in a non-coffee barrel aged stout, and I feel extremely fortunate to have snagged this at the local growler station."
"The cork was difficult to remove by hand, but it was still accomplished. The aroma is very nice and suggests a complex brew. The taste is great. It has a great amount of flavor with a really nice delivery."
"O: I love this beer. While it's quite expensive, it's definitely something I'll try to find more of."
"O: This beer is a sipper for sure. For the amount of beer you get and the price tag, this is one that I won't be frequenting often but when I do, I'll be enjoying this Bad Boy by myself."
"Overall - The flavor is excellent but the lack of carbonation may have held this beer back. If they change this, it may put this beer over the top."
"Mouthfeel is slick and it does a nice job of coating the mouth. Its definitely a potent beer that needs to be sipped and allowed to warm up. I enjoyed this immensely."
"Drink- There are only 3 beers I have ever said I want to take a bath in. 2 come from Lost Abbey. This was one of those beers. I suggest everyone buy a bottle."
"Poured into my bruery tulip. No head and no lacing blacker than old viscosity. Aroma is bourbon, a very woody bourbon. Too much wood for my liking. Taste follows the nose, I like the bourbon but the oak Is too much. I love bourbon barrel beers but this one isn't my favorite. Mouthfeel isn't bad, neither is the carbonation. It's a good beer just not great, I'll stick with old viscosity."
"Overall an amazing beer that I loved. I will definantly be picking one up in bottle form. I just hope the carbonation issues have been corrected."
"O- A little intimidating with the pour, but a nice sipping beer. Higher abv makes a little warm, but not bad. Very much enjoyed this beer after a long day at work. Thanks Adam for the beer!"
"Notes: The body of this beer is a little lighter than I expected, but even the smallest sip is a mouthful. Complex as a beer of this style can be, Older Viscosity is right up there with other barrel-aged Imperial Stouts. Drinkability is dangerously good, as one would not even detect it's 12% ABV. I truly wish this is what emerged every time I remove the drain plug on my truck!"
"O: This isn't my first time trying this one, but it's the first time drinking a whole bottle for myself, and I'm very impressed with how easy it is to drink a whole 12.7 oz. bottle. It's still a sipper, but not as much of one as you might think given the style and the ABV. This is a pretty great bourbon barrel stout, one that's a little light on the roastiness and heavy on the bourbon/sweetness, which is my ideal kind."
"Cracking beer, wonderfully handled."
"Big thanks goes out to Jerriko for sending me this one as an extra in a recent trade! Served from bottle into a Green Man snifter. Poured pitch black with a half finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, caramel, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty tasty brew. Great flavors and aromas going on here. The alcohol was still very forward on this one in the flavor. have an Old Viscosity I plan to crack open to compare here in the near future. I could see this one aging QUITE well though if the alcohol toned down some to allow more subtle flavors to come forward. Definitely worth trying for sure!"
"O - About as drinkable as a 12% stout can be. Very nice."
"Overall one of the best bourbon aged beers I've had, it does rank right up there with BCS in terms of flavor and aroma. I'd gladly seek this out again."
"This is fantastically done. My only complaint is that the back end is wee bit thin, which makes for an uneven aftertaste, but aside from that this is an excellent example of a very big beer."
"D - A defiant sipper... This is a testament to what barrel aged beers should be about... The barrel aging adds loads of depth and complexity without ever taking anything away from the terrific beer that lies beneath... My favorite Port / Lost Abbey offering... While the price tag is quite lofty, this one warrants the price..."
"9/5/2010"
"This is clearly superior to the Old Viscosity, but perhaps not by as much as I hoped. This is rich and full, and has the advantage of some serious barrel aging, but beyond that, it seems to be a similar brew with more breadth."
"Yeah, really happy with this. Thought old vis was good, but this puts it in it's place. Well done!"
"O - certainly would have one, but the vanilla heavy taste and alcohol burn would get old."
"I poured from a 12.7 ounce bottle into a snifter, jet black pour with a very thin tan head. The aroma is big on bourbon, oak and vanilla. The bourbon flavor is up front on the taste, rounded out by vanilla, chocolate, light coffee and light oak. It has a lingering bourbon finish. The body is full, light carbonation, very creamy. A great BA RIS, the right amount of bourbon. A bit pricey at $20 a bottle, but very tasty."
"This is a full bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is lightly prickly on the tongue. The roastiness of this brew coats the mouth encouraged by a slick almost sticky amount of booze. For such a big abv presence this is easy drinking. For once I didn't have to drive so I enjoyed 2 glasses of this and wanted more. I considered opening my bottle of this after getting home, I liked it that much. I like old viscosity to begin with, older is a completely different, deeper and more enjoyable mutation of that brew. Fantastic stuff."
"This was pricey, but I've never seen it around on tap nor in bottle. I knew I had to get it, and I'm so glad I did. I really liked this."
"Overall this is the second time I've had this beer and it was good to know the pleasant experience the first time wasn't an accident. A very big and nicely done beer that's well worth a shot."
"Overall: Excellent beer. The flavor and aroma soar. Rewards every second you spend drinking it."
"Overall - After having just experienced (and reviewed) Lost Abbey's Deliverance, I was curious to review this offering. Where Deliverance was missing some sweet middle game, Older Viscosity was the equal distance away from the fulcrum in the opposite direction. A bit drier would have worked for me. However, do not turn away from this beer if there is a sighting. Nicely done Tomme, nicely done."
"O: On tap? Really? What can I say, I get lucky sometimes."
"The feel isn't overly heavy, but this brew sure packs a wallop with plenty of flavor and then some. Nice to try once, but the overall flavor balance seems a little too heavy on the hotter aspects of the barrel-aged character."
"D - Compound the boozy nature with the lack of carbonation and you've got yourself Older Vis, a beer that doesn't drink very well."
"The best way to improve this would really be to increase the size of the bottles. Aside from that this left me quite content, and validated the hefty price tag."
"D - Pretty high all things considered. I have always liked this beer. The combo of dark stout and bourbon is really nice. The only drawback is the high ABV. as it really does prevent you from enjoying multiple servings."
"D - Drinkability is high. For a beer this alcoholic, its insanely easy to drink. The only thing keeping me from demolishing this beer is the bold flavors that I want to savor. Awesome beer and if not for the price and availability, a mainstay."
"D: The bourbon is balanced nicely, the alcohol isn't overpowering, it's just wonderful overall."
"D: An intense beer, definitely a sipper though. At 12% I was feeling the alcohol after just half a beer. Highly enjoyable and recommended!"
"D- It is a huge beer, for the alcohol and huge assertive flavors, this beer is very drinkable."
"Pours dark brown with no head at all. The aroma has a little bit of a maple syrupy aroma which is mostly over shadowed by the whiskey booziness and wood. The mouthfeel is a little thicker than I prefer and this prevents me from rating it any higher than I do."
"cheers to port brewing and to those of you reading"
"I actually had this on-tap twice. After reviewing it in my notebook I got it a few days later. In other words, this is good stuff. Older Viscosity is definitely unique and I hope to try it in bottled form someday."
"2.0 D: Damn good nose that almost made the bottle a good experience by itself. However, nothing else is up to par. The lack of carbonation made a shitty appearance, a shitty mouthfeel, and a shitty taste. I had hoped that the time in the cellar would have improved this aspect, but alas it did not. I damn near love Old Viscosity, but it was hard to find any of it in the nose or the taste. The bourbon was too powerful to allow that to occur. Tomme should be ashamed of himself for releasing this to the public, especially given the gaudy price. I should also note that I absolutely loved Triple Bock. It was so unthinkably complex and the flavors meshed well together. This doesn't have that same kind of complexity or quality to warrant a good score in spite of being flat."
"Overall an amazing beer that probably isn't higher rated because of their carb issues. Grab one if you can."
"The CPJ"
"Overall- It's a big beer and you can definitely tell. A great sipper. A definite step up from the Old Viscosity with more depth due to the full bourbon barrel. Highly recommended."
"Overall, a really nice barrel aged stout. The price tag is a bit ridiculous, but I enjoyed this nonetheless. The vanilla and bourbon notes really stand out and any harsh notes in the aroma really settle down after a couple minutes. Definitely worth a try for anyone who enjoys barrel aged stouts."
"OVERALL: Was very happy to try the 2010 batch, which ended up destroying the 2009 version. A little bit of carbonation goes a long way, and the feel and look of this one was leagues ahead of last year's. In many ways this one reminded me of Old Rasputin XII, which is a big complement in my book. Worth checking out if you get the chance, despite the hefty price tag. Thanks again Doopie for bringing this one along. Recommended."
"Poured very dark brown, no head on this one with very few bubbles cresting the rim of the beer. Smells of roasted coffee and a waft of booziness reaches the nose. Tastes like coffee and very bitter dark chocolate. The tinge of the 12% comes and goes with every sip and over powers at points but does not put that much a damper on the beer."
"There's no getting around the ABV, but it blends well and suits the style. Quite drinkable given the strength."
"Older Viscosity gives off the bitter scent of dark chocolate and sweetness of creme brulee. It had the dark, opaque appearance that you would expect from a double stout. Mouthfeel was creamy and chewy. It tasted fantastic! Sweet with a strong chocolately finish, with hints of roasted coffee and vanilla. The taste was deceptive- I wouldn't have guessed the ABV of Viscosity was 12% until I finished the beer and felt the punch that it packed. Very enjoyable."
"This beer pours a nice thick black with a slim tan had that laces the glass as it recedes. the smell is roasted malt and bourbon up front with hints of vanilla. the smell is very close to the taste with the rich sweet bourbon flavor stealing the show, with the malts slightly subdued by the bourbons sweetness. the mouthfeel is good, this beer has a full body feel to it, and is very drinkable especially when you consider the abv."
"This was definitely a ""wow"" beer for me. I liked Old Viscosity, but found it to be a little on the sweet side for what I am normally in the mood for. For some reason, adding bourbon to the mix makes it LESS sweet. It's odd, but it works for me, this one came out with a beautifully balanced and complex flavor--showcasing molasses, lightly roasted malt, toffee, bourbon, vanilla, and oak. Chocolate notes make a strong play too, which I'm not sure I expected. Velvety mouthfeel--pillowy and creamy. This one went away far too quickly, I loved every bit of it. If this sold at the price point of GI BCBS, I'd drink it every day."
"Drinkable because of how tasty it is but, this is a sipper and I could not drink more than maybe 6-8 oz of this before I'd be done with it! Great beer from the brewers at Port."
"D- More of a sipper, but leaves a nice caramel aftertaste in my mouth. It's a real solid beer, but is crazy expensive for the size bottle."
"This is a beer that I think best serves its purpose as a dessert. On its own or maybe matched with some sort of ganache covered chocolate treat... either way this beer is damn tasty."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is full but not exactly viscous. The carbonation is low but that helps the overall heavy sensation the beer has on my palate. The alcohol is hot kind of like hitting a shot of bourbon so it works well for me in the beers context. Very high marks for drinkability. This beer was pure enjoyment from begining until the end. My only lament is that I dont have another bottle of this to kick back."
"Hot out the frying pan, bourboning into me. Some caramel and chocolate sweetness, slight roast and smoke and wood. Big heat still after a year, but it's a good bourbon heat of lonely nights by the hearth. Or a campfire with some close friends."
"Overall: Had BCBS Rare on New Years & this beer is very similiar to it; BCBS Rare is a bit smoother. I enjoyed this beer very much...once again; Pricey barrel aged double stout. Paid $16 for a 12.7 oz bottle. Would seek this out again. Wonderful."
"D: This one's a sipper! It hits you strong on all fronts and is a real powerhouse at 12%. My cornish pasties arrived about halfway into the goblet and went quite well with the brew."
"Great Sipping beer. I would get it more often if it was cheaper."
"Poured into a tulip. I did an agressive right down the middle pour for this one. Just a thin layer of dark mocha foam that vansishes almost immediatley. This has a big black thick looking oily body. Quite the booze bomb on this. It's mostly kind of hot alcohol to the nose with just a background of licorice and mollasses with oaky notes. Smells pleasant, but I""m not usually down with boozey noses. The taste is dark like semi sweet dark chocolate with a sweet mollasses and licorice. It finishes with a roasty dark fruit flavor. The mouthfeel is great, it's smooth and full with good subtle carbonation. It drinks nicely, but this is clearly very boozey. It's great and well hidden to the pallet and only slightly noticeable on the finish, but this is still one I""m glad I shared."
"What a fantastic display of the brewer's art. Definitely a contemplative sipper, perfect for a cold and snowy January night."
"Bottle purchased from City Beer in San Francisco. It was a bit expensive ($17), but I've wanted to try this beer, so I hoped it would be worth it for a one time purchase. Pours pitch black with thick brown head. Nice head retention, as the head settles down to a solid ring on top of the beer. Basically a sheet of lacing around the glass. Smells of bourbon, chocolate and roasted malt. Nice sweetness of the chocolate, with a lot of boozy bourbon in the aftertaste. Really smooth mouthfeel. An excellent stout."
"D: This really hides the 12% until it hits your esophagus! Very nice, indeed!!"
"Overall, now that Port/Lost Abbey's carbonation issues seems gone with this years version, it needs time to mellow. I'd recommend it be cellared two years at least. Fresh, I prefer the non-barrel aged version. It is still a a strong Imperial Stout, and a nice sipper, but while I enjoy the bourbon notes, it messed with the balance of the beer. Pricing is also high, at about $15 for this small bottle."
"D: Surprisingly easy to drink, carbonation is medium and there is only a bit of alcohol bite towards the end."
"D-this has some balance, very roasty flavors with notes of chocolate and some malt sweetness in the back. nothing special but a decent brew."
"I love Old Viscosity and this beer was everything I hoped it would be. Excellent."
"Overall, the flavor of this beer is excellent but this beer is flawed. The lack of any carbonation that this beer has resulted in a beer that had the potential to be excellent to be just ok. It sucks that lost abbey has quality control problems. I will not be buying this beer again as it is expensive and I do not want another flat bottle."
"D: it drank decent due to the high ABv and is definitely a sipper. Older viscosity is more complex all around fo sure."
"Reviewed on 3/4/2010. 2009 bottle. Pours a dark brown with just a smidge of head. Aroma of bourbon, molasses, chocolate, vanilla, oak, nougat, maple syrup, coffee. Flavor seems a little less complex and more muddy in my mouth -- still plenty of bourbon with sweet malt, lots of syrupy molasses and vanilla. So overall, I guess I wasn't so impressed with it, although it is a lot better than lots of other bourbon barrel-aged beers."
"D: Obviously poor drinkability and a real shame after the newer batch. Avoid the 2009 and go for a different vintage if you want to seek this out."
"drinkability - highly complex and enjoyable, rich and flavorful, truly a pleasure to drink, the 10 needed some time on it to cool down and evolve"
"Hard to justify 15+ for a 12oz bottle, however, even if it is this good. Quite frustrating it's not priced to compete with other bourbon stouts."
"This is a great sipper. The bourbon barrel is strong in this one, I enjoyed the very strong bourbon taste. This brew is fairly hot and would probably be better aged for a year or two. I only wished I had a couple more bottles for the cellar."
"SkÅL!"
"D - Delicious aged stout. Pleased with only having to spend $12 on this experience."
"Pours like oil with a medium almond colored head. Smells of sweet milky chocolate. Not too heavy - much lighter than other beers of the same pour and smell. Something a little weird in the taste. Overall I would definately order this at a bar. Not sure I would drink a lot of them but still a great beer."
"One last thing, I think the reason I am so surprised by this brew is because I'm pretty sure I originally found out about it on BeerAdvocate (even though I live so close) which is awesome. But now that I've had it, I feel pretty confident in saying that I believe it's incorrectly categorized as an imperial stout. I feel confident in saying this because imperial stout is the one category that I'm not shy to say I know my $h!t. This delicious brew belongs more to the American Dark Strong Ale type style. Just nit-picking though, much love to THE BROS and all other BA members. Cheers!"
"D: Not bad, a sipper for sure and a bit heavy on the bourbon and off in the balance."
"Overall this is probably the best bourbon barrel aged beer that I have ever tried. I even said that in my bottle tasting and it is supported by my tap tasting. Such a kick ass beer, just outstanding. Wow."
"D- I really like this stuff. Im glad I have 2 more."
"The taste is super tasty full and smooth with chocolately taste and light coconut and alcohol flavor with slight woody astringent and smoked element with prominent bourbon effect. bethany says "" like an almond joy"" I love the chocolaty finish eith bitter end whcih has plenty of tangy barrel notes and slight malty sweetness in the finish. The drinkability is wonderful -delicious and intense -12% makes it hard to have more than 1 in a sitting, but you really want that 1 - the smoothness and the quality are high, a trojan horse Barrel aged stout incredible how well it hides such high abv, heads and shoulders above Angel's share to me."
"Had a couple vintages of this, just recently the '08 vintage which is supposed to be the best. From a bottle, pours black with a mocha head. Charcoal, vanilla, oak, some bourbon in the nose. Not overly roasted, which I had remembered from other vintages. Flavor is some roasted coffee, vanilla, a bitter briney kind of quality, green olive. A lot of barrel in the flavor. Though the nose on this was decent, the flavor was weird and seriously lacking, quite bitter and astringent."
"The nose has mellowed out wonderfully, and gained a fruity acidic tinge, The coconut notes here have mellowed out, leaving just some bourbon and vanilla. The palate is sweet, moderately bourbony but just medium-low in booze character. Dark fruit, cocoa, chocolate, a fruity/berry character, particularly in its initial acidity, are all present. The oak has really been integrated into the flavor profile here. Silky smooth,this beer is astounding on the palate. One of the more positive cellaring experiences I've had. Excellent stuff. 4.25/4.5/4.75/4.5"
"D - This is a really good beer. I feel it was a little flat but stil delicious."
"Highly recommended."
"Thin mouthfeel, acrid ashey finish, warm and numbing on the tongue. Vapors rise up the back of the nose. Tasty sipper, but it's packin' heat, which lowers drinkability."
"D - not good at 12% idk how many i could drink"
"I'm not sure what vintage this is. It comes in a corked and caged 12.7 oz bottle. As black as black gets with a brown sugar colored head that forms more of a rim around the top than actually rising to a head. Some spotty lacing and foam on top. Wonderful aroma of a bourbon, red wine and dark chocolate mixture. Very complex, yet balanced flavors. Rick dark bitter chocolate coats the tongue and stays there. Bourbon bites you and there's kind of a red wine bitterness that adds much life to the flavor profile. Black molassas and vanilla round the flavors out. The mouthfeel is as advertised. Thick and viscous that coats the mouth. This is a fine, fine beer. I love it when barrell aging is done right."
"Drinkability is quite good. This is a great sipper. Port Brewing has a delicious BA stout on their hands with just the right amount of bourbon. Definitely seek this one out. A bit expensive like Deliverance, but quite tasty."
"I found this beer to be utterly delicious however it is just so damn thick and the booze really builds over time. Granted I'm not really complaining, it's just a little tough to get through a whole bottle on your own."
"D - Super heavy and heavy alcohol content. Had a hard time drinking one, but this beer is so well crafted that I wish I'd ordered another. So impressed. Very, very good. I would recommend this to anyone."
"Final Thoughts - I like Port Brewing and love what they do for the industry but at the price Port charges for this beer, I'd have to tell them to get over themselves. Really? $8 for 6 oz pours? The beer needs to be in a class of it's own at those rates. I say that with a disposeable income. Money is much better spent on Parabola, Goose Island BCS, KBS, uninfected Abyss off the top of my head..."
"full-bodied mouthfeel, smooth and viscous. low carbonation. pretty drinkable for a beer this big. great brew. not convinced it's worth the price tag, but for an occasional treat OV is a hell of a beer."
"Drinkability is OK, it had a very appealing aroma and some great flavors but the lack of any carbonation definitely hurts it some. Overall it was a beer that had some great potential but just fell short of my expectations. Add just a bit of carbonation and this would be one of the best."
"Just the right amount of sweetness, counterbalanced with tobacco, this one has a lot of elements of a good RIS to it, a middle ground between the American and Russian styles."
"Easy to drink sipper that's enjoyable."
"Overall very good and worth seeking just not among the top and in some cases easier to get beers in this catagory."
"This is an incredible beer - thick and boozy, but a great sipper."
"Near black pour with no head. Massive bourbon aroma with soy, black strap molasses, huge smoke note and lots of volatile alcohol. The flavor is overwhelming charred oak, vanilla, soy sauce, and bitter dark chocolate. The body is syrupy with low carbonation. Man, this beer is just HUGE."
"The initial shock eventually wears off a bit (either that or the old palate just became desensitized over time). It's a sipper for sure but easy enough to drink, though I wish I had waited & split this. I enjoyed this more than it's younger counterpart."
"Taste follows the nose, with some dark fruitiness in the middle, and deep boozy flavors dominating the close. Everything seems to flow together easily. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, with drinkability good for the interest factor and changing flavor profile. Glad I finally got to try this one."
"The ABV is a bit of a shocker, since 9% was my best guess while sipping. This is certainly one of the best and most addictive barrel-aged imperials I've ever tasted and definitely one of Port Brewing's crowning achievements."
"Creamy, thick (as it should be with a name like Older Viscosity), and, in my estimation, perfectly carbonated. This beer really hits the mark, though I think age would make it absolutely phenomenal."
"Take that, high bottle prices: on-tap does just fine. Boosh. It pours a deep pitch topped by over a finger of tan foam. The nose is mostly barrel, as though I'm sniffing the handiwork of a very talented Yankee Candle-type cooper: oak, vanilla, whiskey, a hint of smoke, and maple syrup. Some roasted malts in the background assure me that this is indeed a beer in my glass. The taste is more straight-forwardly beer, with notes of roasted malts (lighter than in the smell), chocolate, oak, whiskey, vanilla, and a drop or two of what seems to be honey. The body is pretty hefty, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly chewy feel. Overall, a very nice stout, though I am unsure whether or not it really lives up to the hype. Either way, it's pretty damn tasty, but a bit much for a regular sipper."
"I went to actually try this beer on tap, for not nearly as much as I would be paying for it in a bottle. This pours the absence of light with a light brown finger of foam on the surface. The aroma is strong. It resembles a port wine, there is bourbon, plum, cherry, chocolate and lots of oak on the nose. The taste is mainly of oak juice, if that even exists, at the end there is a bit of red grape to give it more of a deep red wine taste. There are the traditional coffee, chocolate notes as well as the over powering bourbon flavor. This is a viscous liquid as the title would have given it, but due to the astringency of the liquor I must say it's only rated as good not great. It is a sipper, but still one fine drinking beer. I say get it if the price is right."
"Popped the cork on this mother (2010 batch). No pop. Very worrisome. Oh Tomme, get your carbo under control. Black like 15,000 mile Pennzoil. Actual seems to have a little bit of fizz. Very little head, but seems to be some consistent bubbles. Smells ridiculous. Vanilla/oak barrel overpowering. Chocolate, Starbucks. Bittersweet toasted malt. Tastes of vanilla/chocolate/Peets. Bit of hops to balance out all that barrel and malt. Throat numbing. Actually a good amount of carbonation. Amazing how drinkable this is. My apologies Tomme."
"Half a bottle was enough for me, but the beer was balanced and relatively drinkable for the strength. While the bourbon barrel is nicely integrated, the dark malt notes are also fantastic and I wouldn't mind trying a non-barrel version. Check this out if you can."
"I had it on tap, and immediately went out and bought a bottle so that I could store it. I'd recommend it to all you barrel aged stout lovers, and especially those who love bourbon!"
"Pours an impenetrable black with a fine tan head which fades slowly. Smells of bourbon, raisins, dark chocolate, figs, and seaweed(?). Taste includes roasted malts, coffee, and tobacco. A strong (boozy) bourbon presence with increasing vanilla notes as this warms. Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, and full. It is thick and chewy. This is a sipper for sure. Very enjoyable time after time."
"enjoy one. it will astonish."
"D- A beer to sip and I can't see anyone drinking two of these in a row. One will leave you plenty satisfied."
"Tremendously enjoyable beer. It was a pleasure to savor this one. Certainly a sipper and not something you need more than one in a sitting. The price tag may be off putting for some, I really think it is worth a try at least once."
"D- smooth and well integrated. Abb will roll you. Not filling. Very much a one and done beer."
"I could drink this brew all day, but definitly a sipper. Great out of a sniffer, its just an amazing beer."
"D-Definitely a full flavored sipper but I could sip on this all day."
"D: This one is a sipper, but it is a perfect brew to wow anyone at a tasting."
"M/D - Thick, syrupy body overall. Definitely a sweet but slow sipper..this is delicious but heavy duty."
"Sadly, not very interested to finish this as it stands. What a waste of potential. The Tommie Harris of beers."
"D: Quite good for such a big beer. Not something you would drink more than one of...unless you have another on hand but pretty good. I like this one a lot and am going to try and find some more."
"(D)- A good example of the style, however a tad separated at this stage; the alcohol throws some of its weight around and is rather sweet for the style. While it is good, I would like to see some more of the roasted characters come through from behind the heat and sweetness this puts out. At the same time, the price for one of these, I would much rather grab something else; $17 for 375mL is steep for what you get. Its good, but more worth around $10 for a bottle this size. This can probably age for forever though, so I will see how it is in a year or so."
"D= Its fantastic but not something I could drink too much of in a sitting. The bottle I had was a perfect nightcap on a chilly Fall evening. I will make it my mission to get some more of this one!"
"Pours a deep, slick, sludgy black with heavy rings of dark lacing, marking each sip. The nose is intense. Loads of oak, bourbon, and phenolic alcohol. Notes of vanilla, coffee bean, and chocolate covered raisins. The big flavors of roasted malts and chocolate, presented parallel to the intense bourbon flavors, prevent any astringent bitterness or chalky flavors that sometimes occur in such dark, strong, high ABV stouts. The finish is smooth and complex, and lingers long after the last sip. Almost no carbonation, and a rich, mouth coating ""viscosity."" Take your time with this one, it's a beast."
"Bottle. Really excited to try this one after I found it on shef at Binnys. Pours a deep black color with a slight tan head that collars around the snifter. Huge bourbon notes in the nose along with dark chocolate and some booze. The taste is awesome. Very smooth with a nice bourbon flavor. Some dark chocolate, coffee, and leather after taste flavors. The bourbon really does meld well into this one. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. I could drink this all the time but it would get a little pricey at $12/bottle."
"All in all a richly decadent, mouth enveloping, alcohol warmth soothing, special imperial stout, that I had the pleasure of enjoying with a friend."
" D- The big very full black malt flavor is well balanced and smooth with a nice support from the barrel. There is no big astringency or alcohol making this easy to sip especially for the ABV."
"D: this is by far the best Port/LA beer I have tried. The bourbon is wonderfully executed and the base beer complements it."
"Nightcap after an eli's night with Hoagie and The larse. Thanks to thebestever for this trade. Lovin the aroma and the taste. Choclate, coffee, caramel, fruit. The bitterness adds a whole new dimension. The alcohol is warming and adds to the mouthfeel. Burns just a little bit otherwise the mouthfeel and drinkability would have gotten a 5. I def want to land another one of these."
"As it warms up its get more bitter and the coffee flavor comes out stronger. It's a great after dinner beer."
"D- Drinkability is pretty good. When smelling it, I thought it would be quite boozy, but it was extremely well hidden. However, due to the price, I can't imagine having more than one of these in a sitting."
"D: Surprisingly good. I would pin this beer at a lower ABV than advertised. Sweetness does affect drinkability, but it is what it is. This is one of my favorite big stouts so far."
"MF/D: extremely flat but incredibly smooth for how thick it looks, some lasting heat. wish it was capped since the cork lost it its carbonation... barf."
"Also, $15 for a 375ml beer in its hometown/county when other bourbon barrels that are bottled in 750ml are about the same price. things that make you go hrmm. Don't know that I'm stoked to get it again any time soon all things considered."
"Had somebody told me this was an aged Goose Island BCS, I might be fooled. This was certainly a treat, but in the future I'll stick to BCS, but only due to the price tag."
"Drinks pretty well for as gigantic as it is. It's something that I would definitely recommend just sipping on for an hour or so, as it does have a good bit of heat on the swallow. This beer is also a great candidate for aging, and I may pick up another one to do just that. I actually didn't think I was going to like this beer as much as I did. A very awesome beer indeed."
"Notes: Big bourbon character but *excellent* integration with the beer. Some beers don't benefit from barrel-ageing - this one definitely does. Very impressed."
"Older Vee, as I like to call it. Great presentation in the corked and caged 12.7 oz bottle. Beaut of a pour, pitch brown opaque and silky looking, slim and brown hued head as expected (from an aged beer) and some serious legs, aka viscosity. The nose is wonderful - I don't want to say it's one-dimensional, because it is actually quite complex - but straightforward, in that it is very bourbon-centric and oaky, and loads of roast. This beer explodes upon the palate. Lots of levels here - initially the bourbon and oak, vanilla, rich and full, and a delicious array of roasty malt goodness. I've had this beer several times now and I always get a phantom flavor of blueberry pie. Dunno what it is but I love it. As good as this tastes, the mouthfeel takes the cake and is kind of the essence of this beer, as hinted at by the name. It's just so damn soft and silky. Quite a joy to drink."
"Cheers..."
"I was lucky to get to try this beer. I have been somewhat critical of the Port Brewing beers. I cannot be of Older Viscosity. This is as good as it gets, not only in style but in general. If you get a chance, try it and be glad people are cfrafting beers of this quality."
"TJ"
"D - Pretty good for 12%, but it's so intense, I couldn't see myself drinking more than one on any night... Plus, I don't even have access to this beer, so I'm just glad I had the opportunity to try it."
"Drinkability - If you love bourbon barrel aged beers, expecially stouts/imperial stouts, don't pass this up."
"D- This brew is very balanced for being a bourbon barreled stout. Great flavors and the alcohol is at a minimum. One of the more balanced barrel aged beers I have had."
"Mouthfeel is thick and oily, as you would expext. drinkability is what you would expect from this beer, and any beer with this much booze. It is good anyway"
"Overall I'm impressed with this and yes it had huge expectations for me. I've been saving this for a special occasion and why not draft night, Boise St V Virginia Tech and Labor Day?? I'll be seeking another one of these"
"D - Alright. Its such a big beer and the hot, solventy, boozy flavors make it hard to put down more than a 375mL bottle of this solo (believe me, I've tried several times). Maybe after a year or two the alcohol will be a little softer from aging."
"D - At 12.0%...Good by me!"
"M&D: overall very smooth and rounded (although the warming alc. does cause a bit of a kick at the back of each careful sip), delicately carbonated, quite drinkable & effortlessly enticing~~ This is a delicious and complex heavy ale, but not so... multi-dimensional as Angel's Share that I tried on cask two years ago at the same event (GBBF 2008)."
"D- Sweet, rich, and complex. Makes for an excellent desert. Find a friend and split the bottle."
"D: Very delicious. Wish there was a little more carbonation. I feel like this would be good over icecream as well since it reminded me of syrup."
"Greg Hampton from Whidbey Beerworks suggested that I age this one a while. I probably should have. This one was an odd duck."
"Ages with the best of 'em. Get it, cellar it, drink it with friends. Older Viscosity is a treat."
"Sometimes you build a beer up in your mind to an extent that it simply cannot live up to your own hype. This was not that beer. I couldn't have been happier with the outcome and I will certainly seek out another bottle or two."
"Points must be deducted for mouthfeel and drinkability. Beer is flat as tap water and very hard to drink. Everything else seems similar to the carbonated bottle."
"Flavor is giant coffee and alcohol, tons of warmth in the chest, suprised how much heat in the chest there is with out that much in the chest. Really enjoyed my pour of this, so tasty."
"d - A pretty good beer, but again very disappointed about the carbonation issues. I don't understand why this keeps happening with their beers. In any event, it smelled like a very good bourbon barrel aged stout, and had some good bourbon and dark fruits in the taste as well. Would like to try a carbonated version of this beer sometime."
"D - It's quite drinkable being 12% ABV. It went almost unnoticed. It mis quite a heavy, in your face beer, but one that would be well suited for a bomber."
"Drinkability: Well, when you factor in price I'm inclined to say it's a (4.0). IT's drinkable, but I've had much more drinkable beers."
"Notes: Vintage 2009. Really enjoyable beer. Has a lot of the bourbon flavor, so if you like bourbon you have a good possibility of liking this. Well done barrel aged stout."
"Mouthfeel is medium full with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"D- I think it's GREAT, though I'd probably stop at one due to the alcohol content. This is definitely a brew for me; looking forward to another one after a day on the slopes this upcoming ski season."
"D: I'm dying to try the carbonated version of this beer as I feel like it might make my list of top 5 imperial stouts. Great complexity with an appropriately heavy, smooth, and silky mouthfeel. The lack of carbonation really hurts it as there's very little separation of flavors, and it looks absolutely terrible. Still, one of the better offerings of Lost Abbey's ""Flat Era""."
"D: Too boozy to drink much of this. Glad I found this on tap. A real treat, but I doubt I could really appreciate a full bottle."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is low, enough said. Overall, if I wanted whiskey, I would drink whiskey. This is way too much whiskey flavor in my beer. The base beer has potential, but I will not be seeking this one out again. Sorry to say, this one went down the drain. Skal."
"D: After drinking two shitty macros tonight before coming back to the room for a nightcap this is phenomenal, and there could be bias, but this is incredibly tasty. Definitely an improvement on old viscosity. I could probably split a second bottle with somebody else. It would be nice to see how this improves with age. 2009 bottle appears to be uncarbonated...still a good beer, but this recent batch is nice."
"Drinkability is OK even despite the flatness...I am left to wonder how much I would like this with carbonation. No more Lost Abbey for me unless I am positive that it isn't going to be flat."
"Full bodied with great carbonation(!). The mouthfeel is viscous and slightly dry, but overall it's a bit thin. It's thinner than 2007 batch for sure."
"All in all, this is a very good brew. Super hot right now, but it's a recent release, so age would definitely serve this well. If you have a bottle, do not crack it for a good year or so. Let the flavors mellow down some and they should shine through much better. This is definitely a must try. Good barrel aged stout with an interesting blend of flavors. Definitely worth hunting and trying at least once."
"All 4.5s. Hmmm. I'm sure some of these will be changed to 5s when this beer gets a little while to mellow out. I'd like to revisit this in 6-12 months. Highly recommended."
"Wow, this turned out nice. The rich flavors from the beer and barrel just flowed together effortlessly here and I can't believe how smooth and mellow this got over the last couple of years despite such a large ABV being present. Definitley sipper of high quality here, I'm interested in seeing how this continues to evolve even more over time."
"D: Much better than the bottle version. The draught version really mellows out some harsh characters I noticed from the bottle."
"D - I wish I had split this bottle with a friend (or two). Not sure if I'm going to be able to finish the whole thing. Definitely a sipper."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly light. Enough carbonation to keep the beer lively on the tongue. Superb drinkability."
"Honesty, this is one of the most flavorful beers I've tried. It's almost a ""Christmas Beer", it's so rich and complex."
"This is a real treat, but it would be so much better with a little Co2."
"D--Not exactly a session beer;) I really enjoyed this guy though, very tasty and unique. Wish I could get my hands on this again."
"Pours a rich, dark, black color with cap off khaki head that diminished very quickly. Before its even near my nose, i can tell im in for a boozebomb... scent is of port wine and burbon, vanilla, prune, merlot, tootsy roll. I almost fear tasting it and think i can still taste it almost 12 hours later... very complex alcohol notes as given away by the scent, one of the firt beers where there is a multi-layered alcohol approach - port, merlot, canadian whiskey all present. Dark fruit, earth, oak, vanilla and tootsie roll-like chocolate. Smooth, creamy, coating but not a lot of lingering tastes on the tounge, it does linger in the belly though and i tasted it the rest of the night. A truly unique boozebomb which i may never want to face agaian."
"D - a fine beer, one of my favorites for sure. only hindered by its availability (picked this up in Philly) and price. yum."
"Drinks a tad slow due some hotness, but I enjoyed this & would love to have access to this one. Having said that the little brother (old vis ) I probably like a bit more, will have to verify by looking at my rating,,, Yep the extra 2% abv didn't really do as much for me as the ""smaller"" version..."
"Poured an '09 vintage at a recent BA tasting event side by side with Old Viscosity, we did this one second. Pours an oily black with no head whatsoever. Almost dead flat save for a few little bubbles. Nose is vanilla, oak, and licorice. Taste is more of the same adding some butterscotch and very noticeable heat. Too some adjusting on my part, but after a few sips I really grew to like it. This is clearly where the complexity of Old Viscosity comes from, but needs considerable aging."
"D - Very smooth for a 12% beer. There is a bit of alcohol warmth, but it remains incredibly smooth. Haven't had this fresh, and this one has a couple of years on it now so maybe the age has helped smooth this one out. Flavors are really complex and well integrated in multiple layers of flavors. One 375ml bottle is plenty for me in a sitting, but this one is pretty nice for the style."
"D- at this strength, one 375 is a perfect amount. im glad i choose to be selfish with this one and drink it all by myself. theres just too little to share. i really wish i could find a fully carbonated one of these to try. drinking this treat is making me want to try the regular version."
"My only complaint is that there are few flavor changes throughout each taste and there isn't much nuance. But you've got to love how over the top, no holds barred, intense this is. What a ride! Also, even at 12% ABV this has way more alcohol than anything I've tried (incl. Samiclaus, WWW stout, etc)."
"Minute head upon vicious pour. Carbonation is there but barely, which suits this beer well. Very different from Old Viscosity, much thicker, more bourbon and more complex. Heavy molasses and caramelized brown sugar, espresso is there once looked for but mostly molasses, oak, bourbon and dark chocolate. Well done, could use more carbonation but not much. Extremely drinkable for the style and abv."
"Fantastic beer. Sipper for sure, and while it's fantastic, notably above some other very similar beers, it doesn't require much drinking, but a light sipping enjoyment for an evening."
"Nose has an appetizing bourbon-boozy vanilla/caramel note. Once on the palate a rich dark sugary caramel comes through and also reminds me of coconut. Virtually no carbonation on the palate. Flavors continue to the finish with plenty of bourbon booziness."
"3rd beer at Stoutfest. Black with a small brown head that turns to a ring over time, leaves a bit of lacing. Smell is mostly a bit of the average roasted malt you'd expect of a stout, a bit of vanilla and bourbon coming through as well. Taste is huge and complex. Has a big bourbon/cocoa element that is great especially in the aftertaste. Roasted malts, milk chocolate also apparent. A bit of dark fruit and sweetness in there somewhat as well. My palate was a little weary at this point I think. A little boozy but not too bad considering the alcohol content. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous. Drinkability is decent for 12%, but a big price tag here that I'm not sure is worth the quality and the booze taste is a bit much. 1 glass was definitely enough. Worth trying just for the great bourbon/cocoa element. Definitely the highlight of Port's catalog for me so far."
"D: A small sample was plenty. Sweet bourbon stouts can be a chore to drink by yourself. Great for splitting with a friend or two."
"D - For its abv, it's HIGHLY drinkable. Definitely a highlight of the night. 4.5"
"Well, I'm having trouble attaching scores to this beer. It's hands-down unique, which I love, the bourbon is a bit forward, the lack of carbonation means it's heavy & tough to swill. Overall a very, very good beer. Would carbonation have made a difference? I think it would. Maybe I'll see another bottle someday & get to judge again."
"D: very drinkable, although I don't know how much my liver and stature can handle"
"This was my third Imperial of the session and it blew the others away - followed it with an Avery Czar (which I love) but the Czar just didn't compare, so I had another Older Viscosity... and then tipped over."
"On draft at Sheffield's. Pours a deep, dark brown with the only remnants of a light brown head clinging to the sides of the glass. Smells like coconut and cinnamon, signifying oak, and also smells of bourbon. The malts smell very dark and toasted. Coffee and chocolate dominate the palate with the roasted flavors coming through on the back. The alcohol is present, but it is a little better integrated than other beers of this style I have had young on draft. The palate is very big, but not oily. The finish goes on for a long time. This is a very high quality beer, and I love this style with some more age. I hope to pick up a bottle for cellaring."
"drinkability: i highly enjoyed this one. very appropriate for a northaustin style session beer."
"D - Well, it tastes great, and the alcohol is fairly well hidden - beyond the bourbons flavors that is - only a bit of burn. Definitely a sipper, but one that pleases the entire time."
"Honestly just like AS09 I am rather disappointed from the lack of quality control but I feel this has a more complex taste then AS from what I have picked up. Wish I could try it carbonated."
"A very nice Stout that allows the vinous barrel-aged qualities to rival that of the Stout-like qualities. Thanks Mikesgrove!"
"Pours pitch black, absolutely no trace of lacing or foam! Aromas of bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, taste of dark fruits, molasses, and alcohol that just warms the belly! I also detect an aftertaste of coconut in there. This is as perfect as a perfect beer can get, smooth, warmin, not too sweet, not too strong, perfectly a sipper. My first reaction is to sit at Teresa's and drink this all day, but then the ABV of it wouldn't let me drive home! This beer will be in my quest for greatness, I will search this brew out and gather it for posterity. Thank You, Tomme"
"D - It's a sipper, but could sip this all day until I fall over drunk."
"D: A fine sipper that would be best enjoyed on a chilly winter evening. With a little more body, this baby could perhaps rival BT as the best, boozy Bbl Imp Stout. As it stands now, it's still a great brew."
"D- Definitely a sipper at 12 ABV, but very drinkable. I sipped for about 40 minutes on the 12 oz. chalice that I had and if I didn't have to drive home I would have had another."
"Drinkability is average, too interesting, very one dimensional with the heavy bourbon, another over priced 'rarity' from these guys that I'm glad I didn't bother to track down, and regret even blowing the money on the draft price, which is at least discounted to the bottles. Will not seek out again."
"Beer is medium bodied, feels good in the mouth. Very strong from an alcohol point of view. Very sweet, some chocolate based bitterness. Overall its pretty smooth for this sort of beer. A nice blend all together."
"Had this beer Super Bowl Sunday, I'd been saving it for a couple month's for this occasion. It poured not even a black, but a dark brown, kind of grayish body with absolutely no head whatsoever, I even gave it a big aggressive pour at the end and still couldn't get anything. The smell is mostly a bourbony alcohol with some hints of maltiness and chocolate powder. The taste is about the same, I actually find it pretty bland. It's a slightly complex but dull stout covered in oak barrel. Mouthfeel is not as thick as the bottle's copy would have you believe, in fact it was nothing compared to say, Souther Tier's Choklat. Drinkability is alright, but a bottle was all I wanted...I'm very let down by this beer. Hopefully this was just a bad bottle. :("
"D - Really glad I got to try this stuff. While Old Viscosity is more drinkable, I found this to be a very good BBA brew that lives up to its name."
"I like it, very much."
"Draft, Toronado. I really love this beer. I've had it three times now and have enjoyed it more with every taste. This time, I got a glass to settle my stomach from a night of sours at Toronado's RR -tion night (a 16 oz pour for $6 - bless that bar). This beer pulls off thick and rich better than any other beer that I've tried. The bourbon note is big and strong, but it doesn't get in the way of the underlying stout. In fact, I find the oaky bourbon flavor balances the beer quite nicely. The beer is rich with coffee, cocoa, prunes and brown sugar, yet it's not sticky or cloying. It's definitely a slow sipper. The mouthfeel is velvety smooth. Fantastic."
"Drinkability - an excellent sipper, thanks Johnathan!!"
"Overall I did not find the beer to be drinkable. I have trouble saying tha tthe bottle was mis-handled but something was not right."
"Drinkability: Rated to style, highly drinkable. I keep hoping they will blend it with red poppy."
"Overall, a fine brew. I would recommend it, but also to let it sit for a while before opening."
"Overall, incredibly well-crafted Russian Imperial Stout that I find way too drinkable."
"Thanks to Blake for providing this bottle to the Bowling Green KY BA gathering. A solid beer - big, bold but not too far over the top as some trying for the uber-stout mark. Dark roasted malt flavor. The ETOH does not dominate and adds a gentle warming at the finish."
"D: This beer can be one of my absolute favorites, but this iteration of it is a bit disappointing. The alcohol comes through just a bit too much, unfortunately, but I would still recommend this beer and drink it any time."
"Thanks to Mauerhan for the one-upping - this one has been on my 'wants' for quite some time. 2009 vintage, corked and caged 375ml bottle, served in my Old Stock snifter (also courtesy of Mauerhan). Poured one shade shy of black with just a cluster of clear bubbles that gathered around the edges, with a soapy swirl cutting a swath down the middle. No lacing on this one. Nose is malty, bourbon, vanilla, mocha and booze - smells a little hot. Taste consistent with nose; however, bourbon quality is slightly diminished and a coffee character comes out, culminating in a boozy, almost ethanol-like finish. Well, as suggested by the cork pop (or lack thereof), carbonation is pretty much non-existent. Consistency is medium-bodied and a bit silky; however, the lack of carbonation makes it all feel pretty thin. Decent, but a bit of a let down. The mouthfeel really kills this for me. I would love to try a carbonated version of this offering."
"Overall, a great beer that could definitely benefit from some aging in the cellar. I could see this one mellowing out wonderfully over the span of another year or two."
"Overall, this is very good. One of the best oak aged RIS with tons of bourbon flavor. If you like that vanilla/bourbon this is where you go. For me to be world class needs a head, and better feel overall. Its very similar to GIBCS, but not quite there yet."
"D: Fantastic beer, not too boozy, not over the top but just big enough to draw you in. Full bodied and maybe filling but it is so damn good, it doesn't matter! Booziness is somewhat there, but not overpowering. I only hope to get my hands on more of this..."
"D - Drinks pretty nicely for 12% abv. A bit of a sipper."
"D: I can't rate this particuarly high because of the mouthfeel, but I think that it's pretty remarkable that the taste still holds up fairly well absent carbonation. I wonder if maybe it would have been a 4.5 or 5 if the carbonation had lasted. What a shame."
"Drinkability: This one has all the makings of an amazing, highly-drinkable, life-enriching beer (ok, not so much on that last part). But it seems like it's a great, straightforwardly traditional RIS - that is, tons of complex, heavy, toasted malts, moderately sweet, low hop bitterness - aged expertly in bourbon barrels. And then, this one falls short of the finish line. And not, like, stumbles, but more like, trips and breaks both of its ankles on its way to a career-ending injury before losing all of its endorsement contracts. The carbonation on this one shoots about half of its glory straight to hell, and more than being upset with Lost Abbey/Port about releasing the product like this, I'm upset at the world for allowing such an otherwise great beer to not reach its full potential."
"Very dark brown and pretty much opaque, with only thin chestnut edges. A few tiny light brown bubbles formed a thin collar. Tons of caramel and bourbon in the aroma, boozy and roasty, molasses, vanilla, and chocolate. Very sweet flavour with restrained bitterness. Notes of chocolate, roast, bourbon, caramel, raisin, dried fruit, vanilla, toffee, and alcohol. Slightly woody astringency, full bodied with smooth, low carbonation. It felt a little heavy with lots of warmth all over the palate. It was a little boozy, but very tasty with a rich flavour profile."
"Unusual, intriguing, but somewhat lifeless brew. Would seek out on-tap, but absurdly overpriced in bottle."
"D: It is a beer nerd's sipper. Not the most drinkable for most. I find the drinkability good personally. I would spend a whole night with this beer if I could. Incredible flavor, decently balanced and I like the mouthfeel even though there is no carbonation. 4"
"I bet this stuff is absolutely outstanding on draft. Will see how my other bottle handles some time."
"had @ big wood at brouwer's. totally black and thick like thighs, low carbonation. smells of bourbon, vanilla, toffee, little booze. the alcohol shows up in the taste but the aforementioned flavors are much more meaningful here..chocolate as well here. chewy. ended up getting a second glass of this to confirm its supreme deliciousness. a lovely sipping beer for sitting by the fire with a scientific journal or good friends. i just hope it's carbonated when i open my bottle."
"Soft carbonation up front followed by slightly chewy medium roasted malt body. Lots of sweet bitter dark chocolate, toffee, subtle coffee and hints of dark fruit, especially grape, prune, raisin, plum and fig. Slightly vinous with sweet alcohol notes and a strong bourbon presence that lasts throughout. Subtle earthy oak tannis with a good bit of vanilla that helps cut down the bourbon heat but the flavor is pretty much dominated by the prominent bourbon character. Sweet and surprisingly not too hot at 12%. ABV decently masked but the bourbon presence gives it a lot of liquor taste. Overall pretty drinkable."
"D: Yeah, we realize that this style isn't meant to be massively carbonated, but come on! This style isn't meant to be completely flat either!"
"mouthfeel is disgustingly undercarbonated, which is difficult to do with a RIS. it is nice and thick though."
"D- well had one friday and needed another one on sunday like a junkie. I can't say that I could drink it all day but a few would be no problem."
"D- This brew is interesting to say the least. Nice big bourbon flavor but the lack of carbonation really seems to take away from the overall experience."
"Update: Enjoyed 09 Older Viz on tap shortly after the bottle review. Improves slightly in terms of appearance and mouthfeel from the increased carbonation. Somewhere in between a 4.0 and 4.5. So a slight up-tick in both categories."
"Carbonation issues aside, this is one great beer in the aroma and taste departments. I look forward to cracking open my 2007 bottle that is prpoperly carbonated."
"Sad. That's all I really have to say. This is a pretty good tasting beer. But the lack of carbonation is really a problem. It makes it just hard to drink. I'll re-review if I find a good bottle, or get it on tap. Until then, I'm going to be pretty gun-shy when it comes to Lost Abbey."
"Drinkability: The alcohol is a bit too apparent, which makes the heavy going. This is definitely a beer that needs aging, in a few years I can see it mellowing and the flavours really developing."
"Drinkability is good, although the bourbon stops it from being very high. Great beer overall."
"very good for an imperial stout, just a little too much on the strong side."
"I can see how others might like this, with some age this would be really good as it might dull down some of the bourbon and heat to bring out more complexity, add in more carbonation and we'd have a winner. I really wish I had an older bottle (or a chance to try it on-tap) because I feel this could be a better beer than what's been bottled in 2009. Even though I've had stronger beers I'm glad this is only available in 375ml bottles, but at the current cost you can easily find much better imperial stouts."
"F: Finish has more bitter stout flavors with some earthy flavors. Still semi sweet and very rich. A little creamy as it fades, and the alcohol taste seems to linger a bit as well as the bourbon and oak flavors. As the stout, bourbon and oak flavors fade, it seems to leave a chocolate covered raspberry flavor in my mouth, how interesting."
"This is not for me. I did not enjoy this very much. There are many other Impy Stouts that I enjoy, and ones that I can find locally at that."
"Well, for me the '09 Older Viscosity needs a little time. The bourbon is almost out of control, and it's pretty hot. However, it's still a very solid Bourbon Barrel Aged beer by Port Brewing. The flavors are all there, and it's pretty complex."
"Enjoyed this one at The Armsby Abbey in Worcester earlier tonight, very awesome place with really good food. Poured into a smaller snifter, as black as oil as one would expect and a half finger dark coffee ice cream colored head. The retention of the head was good but little to no lacing is left behind by it (not sure if it's because of the beer or the glass used). The head is creamy but also has some large bubbles in it. After it dies down it becomes a ring around the top of the beer with some clouds scattered over the whole beer. Smell is what one would expect from a beer like this. Tons of bourbon up front, vanilla in the whiskey, malts and some dark chocolate. A good balance of elements that work well. The taste beats the smell out. A very good blend of many flavors. The two biggest elements in the taste for me were the bourbon and dark chocolate. The whiskey seemed to dominate at first but as I got into the beer more the chocolate took over first place and the whiskey surrounded it. Along with these two I picked up roasted malts, coffee, vanilla and a good dose of alcohol. The alcohol does not take away from the taste but adds an interesting element, which I like in these big stouts. The beer started to taste a lot like Speedway Stout but with bourbon aging added to it as I neared the end of my glass. The mouthfeel is thick but not overly creamy, more of an oily feeling to it which suits this beer pretty well. The very low carbonation here also helps the beer out by allowing the complexity of flavors to blend and not be masked by a carb bite. This beer is hot on the tongue from the alcohol but this is expected with any beer that is 12%, it adds a nice element as well. Drinkability is good. It is not perfect because of the price, the beer was worth it but the prices I hear for bottles is pretty crazy and it was $9 on-tap. I would definitely get this one again to remind me of how bourbon aging can really make a good beer and not just hype one. The other thing about drinkability is the alcohol and bourbon overtaking the beer, this seems inevitable but I don't think I would be sessioning this anyways. I can only hope to try some more of Port's limited stuff in the future."
"D- I like bourbon whisky, so I didn't really mind how strong it came through in the taste, but I can't help but wonder how some carbonation would have helped the flavors of this beer come to life. I wish Port Brewing/Lost Abbey would stop releasing flat beers that cost a lot of money."
"the brew has no pop when the cap is taken off, nor does the beer make any foam when poured into the glass. it is, however, completely black in body colour. the smell is incredible, bourbon, oak, prunes, roasted malts, burnt sugar... if only it were a tad stronger! this is quite like the black tuesday I just had, only it had a bit of less compelxity. the initial is a bit more coffee oriented and less on the booze, for obvious reasons. the dark chocolate comes out in the aftertaste quite strongly, and the finish has less of a booze burn. the carbonation is a little more crisp than expected, and the drinkability is great if the brew weren't so hard to get. the feel of the body is too thin for me, as there is quite a lack of carbonation."
"Todo: compare a 2-year old botle of Old V with a 1-year old bottle of Older V."
"D: As I remarked during the tasting, the vintages of this beer are pretty much trending downward (07 was best, 09 was worst). This is not worth what they are charging for it."
"Overall - An amazingly complex stout... highly recommended. I have one more of these and i can't wait to see how it ages..."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Taste is sweet and bourbon nice oaky and malty notes. A solid dark... motor oil beer! A very good compliment to old viscosity.. seek this out!"
"A great balance of all the aspects of a good Imperial stout, but not the biggest, most robust example of the style and certainly overpriced."
"drinkability is decent. heavy stouts are inherently less drinkable, and this is no exception. that being said, the flavors here are sublime in composition and very well porportioned. for sheer richness, this brew is on the level of a Goose Island Bourbon County Stout or a Sam Adams Triple Bock, and is right on par as far as quality goes. cheers!"
"D-12% ABV--who cares! This is so accessable yet decadent at the same time! A masterfully aged brew. Old Viscosity is damn good on it's own and this well, Older is on another level altogether!"
"RoyMunson, thank you again, sir! Glad I finally had the opportunity to try this fine beer."
"D: Fairly drinkable given some fairly obvious flaws. Fairly disappointing as the taste shows some promise, and I was expecting more knowing how good Old Viscosity is."
"J"
"Very enjoyable, almost cordial, I would have this again."
"Deep aroma. Dark. chocolate, caramel, alcohol, tobacco, fresh anise. Strong as I can whiff it about 10 inches away. Taste is addictive I think. It has a very nice blend of all the aromas, with some black plum and hints of pepper on the side. Easy drinking for the abv, a bit thin as mentioned. burnt wood comes in the end giving it a smokey, semi sweet finish. Very nice"
"Overall, the aroma and taste were very good for the style but the lack of carbonation really hurt the appearance and especially the mouthfeel. Got mine for free but sticker is $16.99 which is high for 375ml. Also, for that much, you expect the carb issues to be figured out or don't release the beer. For aroma and taste, the drinkability is around higher but the carb issues and high price bring it down some."
"One to enjoy slowly and with friends. A real pleasure to enjoy this...."
"d- Doesn't quite match the drinkability of it's British counterparts but it does go back easy and smooth."
"D: Very easy to drink could have this pretty much everyday."
"Drinkability: Moderate at best - very refined, very smooth and a great beer to taste if given the opportunity."
"HV"
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, oily, slick, and warming."
"D - To thick, flavorful and high in ABV for more than one. Certainly a must-sip."
"Drinkability: Medium at best - while it's got amazing flavors and superb mouthfeel, the ABV is pretty high - makes for a nice after dinner treat though."
"Overall: absolutely awesome!"
"2009 375mL bottle, corked and caged. After reading all the recent threads I was prepared for this to be as flat as it was. I even shook the bottle before opening to see what might happen, and a few bubbles appeared on the surface. But despite that the cork pulled out slow and there was no ""pop"" sound. I poured vigorously into the glass but only achieved a few bubbles at the glass line. The beer is dark brown/black and opaque as expected, and had no head at all (unfortunately also expected). Despite its appearance this beer smells pretty damn good. The bourbon aroma is STRONG, it smells like a beer/liquor hybrid. Also some chocolate, really good. The taste is just as good, lots of bourbon and mocha and some alcohol flavor too. This seems >12.1% ABV by taste alone... The mouthfeel is poor with almost no carbonation, I'd hoped it would seem cask-like or something. But it wasn't, I'd like this beer much more if it had carbonation to counter the heavy body."
"Very impressive beer, but such a strong flavor I'd have trouble drinking more than one. It's a slow sipper, but well worth it."
"This is my first Older Vis (although I have a 2008 in the cellar) and it is STRONG! *VERY* strong overpowering alcohol smell. taste is good, but a little too strong for me and weird with no carbonation. I can usually drink any beer pretty quickly (I'm just a fast drinker) but this is definitely taking longer to put down. For reference, I love and can put down other stouts that are 10-12% ABV. Honestly, it's work finishing it. I'm very curious how the 2008 is with carb, aged a year but it will be a while before I open it up."
"Thanks to Sparky27 for this gem! 2008 Bottle pours pitch black with tan head. Aroma is a mixture of oak, bourbon, and dark roasted malt. They are all blended together very well with not one characteristic dominating the other. Medium mouthfeel. Flavor is oak, vanilla, subtle bourbon notes, dark roasted malts, and finishes with a touch of hop spice. This is a fantastic brew. I know there has been a lot of criticism of this brewery lately for a variety of reasons and this brew is one of the best out there. Period."
"Finish last many minutes as if you chewed an espresso bean. This brew is all licorice and espresso. I drank this while unconsciously eating a small bowl of fresh black cherries-it actually went well! This big licorice, chocolate, espresso brew will likely go with big flavorful desserts and would be wonderful with chocolate. Very good although you can't drink a whole lot of this one at one time!"
"Drinkability: There's no masking this boozy brew. Heavy and every bit of the ABV, but that's not to say it's not drinkable and enjoyable. While I didn't consider this to be a world-class stout, it's one that I would certainly be happy to have again, and the bottle I'm aging will serve that purpose well."
"D: This is certainly a tasty beer, but it is very expensive, and at the end of the day I prefer regular Old Viscosity more, especially with it's nicer carbonation, body, and the fact that it is considerably cheaper."
"I guess I'll round the scores."
"Had at port brewing/lost abbey on tap in plastic glass. Could not fully appreciate head or carbonation issues, because carb was fine on tap. Being a strong ale category seems very similar to an imperial stout just slight differences in tastes and smells. Very dark brown w/brown head and a little redness shining through. Fades quickly. Some chocolate, caramel, bourbon heat(not too much), and dark fruitiness coming through. Very full mouthfeel. Very similar to old viscocity just slightly stronger. Would have to say it's better than the previous but for the bottle price, not that much better."
"Good beer on tap I can only imagine, for 12 bucks, buy something else. Close, but no lumps..."
"Overall, this beer is nothing but goodness. From the start to the end it continued to impress me. I love how it is over 12% and hardly hot at all. The bourbon was amazing and I want more already. I will have to try and trade for a few 09s. This beer is a must try if you enjoy big BA beers. One of my new favorites."
"D- OLD VISCOSITY, which you can get for 6 dollars a bottle, is way way better than this 16 dollar bottle. I wasted my money tonight and I am not happy with the brewing efforts of port. The day this company comes through with carbonation, and lessens up on their price range, I will welcome them with open arms."
"I really really enjoyed this beer can't say enough about it try it if you can and hopefully the head is better for yours, the only downside on thise one for me"
"Edit 9/09: This years vintage has more of a bourbon barrel influence but lacks the wild yeast and red wine presence. Still a fantastic beer, just different than the '08."
"Pours an opaque darkness with a HUGE two+ finger stiff dark brown head that fades incredibly slowly, approaching 3D. Sheets of Belgian lacing going on. The smell is Heaven!! Rich malted mllk chocolate and cherry vanilla bourbon. The mouth feel is adequately carbonated yet hot and tangy from the alcohol and oh so smooth. Full flavored, the bourbon choco-roasted malt-java taste mix is also amazing. A world class sipper, the 12% ABV warms nicely. I expected it to coat and linger, but it cleaned up rather quickly. One of my all time favorites. Thanking radshoesbro for this '08 version hook-up!!!"
"D: This is a completely different beast than when it was fresh. This is one bad ass beer."
"Drinkability is decent; Warming without being overly boozey, but I didn't find myself immediately craving another one of these."
"D- You kidding me, this was a joy to drink and it was easy to accomplish. Out of all the LA/PP beers, this is currently my fave. Went down to easy and the taste is marvelous. Come to think of it out of all the Bourbon barrel beers i've tried, this ranks very high. Just a bit of a warming effect with this one."
"12.7 oz bottle from the brewery, 2008 edition. Certainly no carbonation issues here. Pours black with a tan head that sticks around for the duration. Pretty nice for a 12% abv beer. Nice melange of bourbon and barrel aromas with enough malt in the background to hold its own. This isn't a hit you over the head beer- the aromas and flavors are remarkably well integrated, and it is remarkably well mannered for the high abv. Lovely balance of barrel notes of vanilla, whiskey, tannic oak; stout notes of some roasty bitterness, a touch of espresso, and nice stiff malt. The bourbon is clean and sweet and goes beatifully with this soft but strong beer. Very smooth with barrel and whisky notes most predominant up front where a nice creaminess manifests. More tannic bitterness and stout notes on the finish. Superb craftmanship."
"Glad I tried it and would recommend to anyone into barrel aged stouts. At this price I won't be getting this again, but I certainly do not regret my purchase."
"This one pours black with a very minimal head. Smells of coffee and chocolate, and tastes of coffee and chocolate with some hints of bourbon and molasses. Coffee/choco lead the charge, though, and it's a nice blend of the two. Despite the minmal head, carbonation is just fine--plenty of tingle. Not one you could drink too fast, but this is a damn solid imperial stout."
"Drinkability= Uh. yeah. Two of these MAX in one night. Flavor is awesome, nose is awesome, visuals are awesome. Abv. is not noticeable @ 12%."
"D: Exceptional in all senses. One of a kind beer. One of my favorite offerings from Lost Abbey."
"Overall: Definitely worth it, however I wish this was bottled in a much larger bottle."
"Overall: A must try and nothing like Avery...I was such an idiot back then...hell, I still might be. Seek out and drink. Cheers!"
"This is a magnificent beer. Its depth, complexity, and unique flavor and aroma profile showcase the master artistry of its creator. For any lover of Imperial Stouts, or any beer that is an experience on its own, this is a must try."
"- Way too drinkable... all I can think is ""What if I had a Stallion Keg of this stuff... would I die?""."
"Just an amazing, amazing brew."
"Draught at The Bistro. Black with a scant head. Woody, bourbony and roasted coffe-like aroma, with some fruity background action. Thick and oily, with low carbonation. Primarily tastes of coffee and bourbon, with light vanilla, dried fruit and wood as well. Some burnt sugar/toffee gong on too. Intense. Definitely smoother and more complex than the regular old vis."
"All in all an excellent brew and worth your time to seek out."
"Mouthfeel is also one of the better ones I've have. Great viscosity (go figure) and it just seems to coat your tongue and not let go. Not easy to find or cheap -- but this is one that I will go out of my way for any day."
"A comparison with Bourbon Barrel Angel's Share comes naturally. I prefer Angel's Share, but not by much. This one's really close and worth every accolade that comes its way. It's truly special. Seek out a bottle and find out for yourself. World class? Indeed it is."
"Edit: with the english barleywine... It was absolutely amazing. Alas, it is still rated for what it is - and that's not god. But with the ebw..."
"Pours a gorgeous black with reddish brown highlights. The tan head quickly dissipates right before my eyes in just 5 seconds. Smells of bourbon, burnt malts, tobacco, and dark fruits. First sip is all prunes and raisins - super bitter but incredibly pleasant. There is plenty of oak too. Almost over carbonated but certainly acceptable. Bitter from start to finish, there is not much sweetness here. The sweetness that is present does not last very long. Part of a massive 2 day Stout tasting. On my bracket Older Viscosity beat BA Speedway in the second round but lost to BA Blackbeerd in the semi-finals."
"Served into a tulip. Pours opaque black with a brown head the clings the the glass nicely. The nose has plenty of oak and booze with a nice dose of brown sugar and vanilla. The flavor is more oaky vanilla with some brash, but welcome roasty and bitter notes. Finishes with a nice alco-burn. Medium body with prickly carbonation and a chocolaty but dry finish. Certainly a well made beer worth seeking out."
"In all, I'm very pleased to see this beer live up to the hype. Wish it would've stuck with me all the way though, but I really can't complain, it was delicious."
"Although it didn't start out that way in the top half of the (much too small) bottle, I'm now tempted to grant the ultimate taste score to Older Viscosity. It's an outstanding, expertly crafted ale that is a near perfect combination of stout, old ale and bourbon. Thanks to Talisker for sending me yet another world-class beer."
"This ranks, to date, as the best mouthfeel of any beer I've had."
"Overall, I am glad I got to try this gem. I enjoyed it very much, but I think I may have been hoping for more. Great nonetheless."
"there's a perfectly fine beer hiding in there under that sweetened blanket...8/5/5/3/15/3.6"
"Overall this is a fantastic beer and if it wasn't so expensive it might be my daily nightcap. Definitely one that the Lost Abbey has perfected and I hope continues to produce."
"D - It's such a big beer. You can't really have too much of it."
"D: A sipper for sure. When slightly chilled, it hides its alcohol well. But becomes progressively more noticeable as it warms up. If too warm, it's a bit too harsh."
"D - A sipper, and a slow one at that. nice to have in a snifter and sit by the fire with in your smoking jacket."
"A meal of a beer right here. Wonder what the calorie count is? Who cares is the answer I think. The cost was a little steep, but this was an enjoyable & unique experience. Would gladly have again."
"Viscosity aside (no pun intended), Older Viscosity is a terrific beer. It does not quite fall into the upper echelon of imperial stouts, but it comes close."
"This is not a great beer, but it is very good, and significantly better than the Old Viscosity, with a more noticeable aroma, better integrated flavors, thicker on the palate although still thinner than I would have liked."
"Overall, a well done Imperial (Russian?) Stout, but slightly over-hyped. Granted, I wouldn't pass this up in a heartbeat, but it's not worth the $25 I paid for this, and wouldn't go for a second shot at it at that price range."
"Very dark brown body with a slight, but persistent light khaki head. Lots of bourbon on the nose. Sweetish dark fruits, vanilla, molasses, and oak blend together nicely. Yum. Taste follows nose: lots of bourbon, but it's not overwhelming. Molasses, chocolate, sweet figs, vanilla, oak, and even coffee all dance together nicely in this heady concoction! Big and bold and warming. Full-bodied (good viscosity) and smooth. Reminds me of GI BCS in all the good ways. Wow."
"Overall: Older viscosity is a very unique beer, absolutely worth at try if you can find it. Not to be confused with Old Viscosity, which is an entirely different experience."
"A great beer, very rare but worth trying."
"D: World class barrel-aged stout. To be sought. Very expensive, however, at like $20 per 12.7oz bottle. Lots of balance here. Exciting brew. Very sippable."
"Overall, an excellent barrel-aged stout and a good example of a beer that is elevated (rather than dominated) by the barrel."
"A good sipper the bottle size was good for me. It was good to the last drop. I was glad I tried it but don't think I will search it out again because of the price. I will say this RIS is the best of the barrel aged I have tried; you really get the barrel taste to stand out"
"The smell I think is a bit better than the taste, but not enough to mention more. This beer is always a treat, especially because I can't find it in stores here often. I got another one to age and see what happens."
"I finally got my hands on a bottle of this and, Holy Sh*t its good. Pours an opaque dark brown, nearly black. Very viscous, with a 1 cm tall tan head. Dense, low-lying aroma of molasses, leather, bourbon, chocolate, cream, and toasted oatmeal. I will attempt to describe the taste, but I know I will not do it justice. Creamy bitter dark chocolate, with an earthy toasted caramel malt. Notes of vanilla, molasses, tobacco, burnt coffee, and oak. The bourbon comes through near the back and in the finish. It rounds the flavors out perfectly without turning the beer into a boilermaker. Worth every penny of the $20 I paid for it."
"Overall: I had this beer on tap at the Bistro in Hayward. It was left over from the Barrel Aged Beer fest a few weeks ago. I am glad that it was still around. This beer was great. Definately a sipper though."
"I must get this beer again, it is just an incredible example of how barrel aging can compliment a suiting beer."
"an expensive brew for sure, but a truly magnificent beer..a treat for any beer lover, and one of my new favorites."
"This is about as good an example of barrel-aging as I've seen in a while. It's extremely complementary to the base beer and doesn't dominate. A great beer."
"On tap at Lost Abbey barrel tasting. Very dark if not pitch black. Carbonation was not evident in the pour I received. This is the second time I've had Older Vis, and I really like it. Dark roasted flavors with oak, vanilla, bourbon, and dark fruits. Very rich, complex flavor and smell. Mouthfeel was less carbonated than I would have liked, and seem to remember there being more carbonation I had in a bottled version last August."
"Notes from 12/7/07"
"Poured a dark black color with a ring of tan bubbles that quickly fades to nothing. Aroma of roast, ash, chocolate, dried fruits, vanilla, bourbon, caramel malts, and alcohol. Taste of dark fruit, some tropical, sticky molasses, roasted malts, vanilla, and bourbon - alcohol. Stiff, and sharp, I like the Old Viscosity better."
"D - It's strong (although I'd have guessed 9%), and I'd likely only have one (or even share a bottle with friends). Delicious & smooth to drink though!"
"Finish was like a vanilla coke with little carbonation, that may not be a great desc. but thats what came to mind.but damn it was gooD. just not worth 25+ dollars"
"Overall, a very enjoyable, but intense, beer. I'm going to try to get my hands on the next batch."
"The beer is very heavy and makes a definite sipper. better on a cold winter day than in the summer. QUite enjoyable and well crafted!"
"Although I didn't care for Old Viscosity much, Older Viscosity rules. The barrel aging really did the trick for this strong ale and it is about as perfectly balanced as I could imagine for the style. I paid a lot for it, but it was worth it. I did not want the glass to end. The next bottle I will definitely share with others."
"This is a sipper for sure. the whiskey makes it that way for sure. Any more than 375 and I would be hard pressed to finish it, and probably wouldnt be able to walk afterwards. nice after dinner sipper, but wish I would have shared it with one other person."
"drinkability is ok. its a beer that i am happy that i could have tried but to be completely honest i dont think i will be visiting older viscosity any time in the near future."
"Drinkability is great. Wow! This is the best beer I have had in a while, and easily one of the best Russian Imperial Stouts I have ever tasted. Track this one down, especially if you are a stout fan."
"Taste & mouthfeel: It's striking how unlike Old Viscosity this is. The abrasive bitterness and resiny hop attack have been softened by the months in bourbon barrels, replaced with sweet vanilla and caramel flavors. There's still a firm roasty bitterness in the finish, like a piece of charred bread sweetened with blackberry jam, but it never overtakes the bourbon and malt. The mouthfeel is full, almost syrupy, and the low level of carbonation only further contributes to that. As with anything Tomme Arthur puts in a barrel, this is simply stellar stuff."
"The first taste is huge. This just has a ton of flavor to it. The bourbon continues to dominate, but it is never overpowering and comes off extremely smooth. Vanilla and a distinct roastiness balance it rather nicely. There is a very slight underlying fruity sweetness to it, and I'm really not detecting hops much at all. The alcohol, at 12%, is quite apparent, and I think it is drinking a bit hot and would likely get even better with a few years on it. The mouthfeel is quite heavy, with the carbonation not overbearing, but still pleasant. Overall, it's an excellent beer for a special occasion, and I think it will only get better with age."
"Sticky and thick as hell. Coats the glass with its richness. I could sip this all night. My rating might be influenced by the fact that I sipped it by a bonfire on a nice cool night. It was damn near perfect."
"Milk chocolate colored bubbley head epuals two fingers but fades fast leaving no lace. Body is jet ink black. Nose is lovely with huge bourbon and toffee notes wraped around some creamy chocolate tones. The bourbon feel is first to hit with carmalized malts and buttery toffee. Some big soured dark fruit in in the middle of the palate. Really creamy and mellow as it warms on the mouthfeel. Bourbon is slightly warm but not harsh at all. Mouthfeel is very inviting of the next sip. Another bourbon lovers joy from Port. Sip wisely and enjoy all night."
"Bottle sampled at Lost Abbey for RBSG 08. Poured into a wine glass. Black color with ruby red highlights. Small cocoa head with wet lacing. Aroma is straight bourbon with a leather note. Flavor is dark chocolate with a roasty undercurrent and complex notes of vanilla, oak, bourbon (without the alcohol sting), and molasses. Long finish from the rich body."
"D- You need to take your time with this one between the richness and the alcohol"
" Mind blowing complexity, and I can't even imagine how good it will be after a full year or two in the cellar."
"Midnight black color with a rich tan head that retains very well and leaves good lacing. Large amounts of bourbon in the aroma, with some vanilla also joining it. Some nice chocolate-y roastiness is also in there, maybe a bit of charcoal too. Thick, chocolate-y, roasty, liquid crawls down my tongue with a very smooth bourbon flavor and finishes with a little bit of alcohol warmth. Body is extremely full bodied with medium carbonation levels. Just a splendid beer to drink, I wish this was more available. I've yet to be disappointed with this brewery; great stuff! Thanks for the sample, Tomme."
"Drinkability- This is a really a wonderful brew that I really, really enjoyed! The alcohol gets a bit more noticeable as it warms but even that isn't such a bad thing. The big creamy body and coffee/bourbon/chocolate goodness are fantastic. Big thanks to Walter for sharing the love!"
"D: A sipper no doubt but damn was this good. Spent 2 bones on this at Monk's cafe in Philly and it was worth it. Still have not had a bad beer from Lost Abbey."
"I had high hopes for this brew and while it delivered on some aspects it fell short on others. There is a little more bourbon character then I'd like but it is very good. I wouldn't mind having a few more to see if they cool down over time."
"It is a great beer that should be sought it. It also happens to be review number 500 for me... fitting? I think so!"
"Tough to say this has ""drinkability"" as it's huge, black as night, and built for the long haul. Though I don't remember a sweet type flavor as I have in other beers of this color and viscocity. Smoke, dark malt, and a long finish. But Damn! this stuff is so tough to find."
"Another exceptional outing from Tomme and the Lost Abbey/Port Brewing Company. Highly recommended."
"D: Obviously a slow sipper but one that you'll savor and finish without complaint. This was much better than the plain Old Visc and I'd recommend it."
"Bought from release in Nov. 07. I had it on tap that day and havent opened a bottle until know. Poured into Duvel snifter, poured black with two finger tan head. Smell is bourbon oak, vanilla, molasses, and boozy dark fruits. Taste is dark fruit, some chocolate powder mixed with slight coffee roast, with a real bourbon oak complex dryness on the finish. Mouthfeel has a lot more carbonation than last year batch which is almost completely flat. Really a nice sipping beer especially after dinner but one or two would be it for a night."
"And what an experience this was. Really big flavors, yet really balanced and so damn drinkable for a beer of this caliber. I gave this 5's across the board without thinking twice."
"Dangerously drinkable - this is complex and delicious, despite the alcohol making itself known. A wonderful brew!"
"Poured a very black color with a beautiful tan brown head sitting on top that fizzles and leaves a little behind. Aroma was very full with bourbon and vanilla notes side by side with dark fruity tones. Taste did not let me down either with a lot of coffee and chocolate with the sweet fruit notes. Mouth feel did provide a slim warming presence but not too overwhelming. Overall I found this to be a great balanced example of a top tier Russian Imperial Stout."
"Don't think I can drink more than this 375ml bottle but it does go down somewhat easy."
"Big thanks to tayner, seaoflament, and Nitrogen for a bottle of these. I shall savor them!"
"Drinkability- Warming, wonderful, chewy, I love this beer more than anything but it's way too high gravity for normal drinking."
"Drinkability is high despite the 12%abv, an amazing profile of malts leads the charge here and is balanced out by the dark fruit and bourbon/wood accents, I can see this beauty only improving over time as the hotness will likely subside, no surprise here, I have drank the Kool-Aid and readily admit that Older Viz lives up to its billing, get some if you can!"
"Bottle courtesy of Bu11zeye: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a small foamy head with average retention and some lacing. Aroma of bourbon and oak with some notes of roasted malt. Taste is also dominated by some nice notes of bourbon with some light oak with some lightly sweet roasted malt notes. Texture is somewhat oily with average carbonation and full body. Alcohol is definitely not too apparent and bourbon is well balanced. Very good over all but I have to admit I was expecting more character from this beer, this is easily drinkable and I would have never guessed the 12% of ABV."
"d: This is difficult to obtain and very expensive, so I certainly won't have it often. I do hope to try it again one day though. Big, big, big thanks to tayner for the chance to try one of the best I've ever had."
"Mouth is big thick and juicy. Silky on the mid palate and long on the finish. A beer I could be happy with as the last beer on earth."
"This is a solid beer, thick and yummy. Definitely not a session beer. Seek this out if you can."
"Pours completely impenetrable black with a nice tan head and ok lace. Smell is bourbon wood right off the bat with dark black death malts and warm alcohol. Taste is thick sick black demon death maltiness with intense bourbony flavors. if your a bourbon county stout fan, this brew is for you. I actually prefer this to fresh B county, i find it smoother. my god the bourbon and wood are prominent here. The bourbon especially. Vanilla, chocolate vanilla comes to mind. Some slight nutty dark fruitishness in the middle. This is very much an after dinner treat. mouthfeel is...well...viscous. not too thick, not too thin. great. The finish has just the right amount of alcohol heat for a good bourbony stout IMO. Im trying to drink this as slow as possible but it is hard, as it is quite tasty. The bourbon wood has done wonders to change and increase the complexities of this beer. Old viscoz is one of my favorite beers, and this is wildly different and just as if not more enjoyable. Can't wait to try the second one in the cellar in a year or 3. Well done gentlemen, well done. Great"
"Edit: This is the 2008 edition."
"Thanks to Overlord for letting me sample this beer. Beer pours dark brown, with little to no head. The smell was bourbon, dark fruits and chocolate. Taste was heavily bourbon flavored, with some chocolate, molasses and fruit present. This was a beer I was really looking forward to trying and it did not disapoint."
"D: This was one amazingly complex beer and very delicious. I enjoyed what I had and it was a great experience to try this beer however, I would not choose to drink multiples of this beer at one sitting."
"One of the strongest bourbon presences I have seen in a beer, thought Old Viscosity was good by itself but this stepped a notch after spending six months plus in bourbon barrels and being blended for a final product, would to drink again as soon as possible, highly recommended if you can get your hands on some"
"Poured into a snifter, a dark cloudy brown, some red in the edges, tiny head forms, leaves behind some lace spots, some legs on the glass, little light for a RIS but okay. Smell is wicked, bourbon, burnt currants, toffee, dates, chocolate, some light roast, rich and intense, vanilla and oak, some coconut, alcohol, very big and very nice! Taste is similar, toffee, coconut, vanilla, bread, dates, bourbon, alcohol, light fruits, nuts, toffee pudding, alcohol is well hidden, some rum and bananas, very nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, low silky carbonation, super drinkable for being almost 14%, feel like it could have been a bit thicker though. Amazing beer, everyone should try. Thanks Russ!! You're the man."
"drinkability is great. very good balance between the malt and the alcohol. great barrel character that is strong but not quite overpowering. alcohol is nicely warming. this is good stuff. i liked this one and look forward to finding more."
"Poured in a chalice a thick black color, not much of a head just some fizzy creamy tan head, awesome carbonation (nice loud POP on cork), there are some oil slicks and very minimal sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is very nice of sweet malts, vanilla, bourbon oak, black licorice, chocolate/toffee/caramel. The taste is awesome of roasted malts, bourbon bang, vanilla, and toffee/caramel. Alcohol is hidden very well, but a nice warm feeling in the throat, very nice for a brew this high in ABV. Full/Medium body, well balanced brew. Very drinkable, very nice to the style, thumbs up Port Brewing/Lost Abbey. If you can get your hands on some, do it. This is very different than the Old Viscosity, highly recommended. Thanks Bill."
"D- This is incredibly tasty but with 12.1% alcohol you definitely could not drink a ton of this beer. It is sooo delicious though!"
"D - This was a quintessential sipper. If for the alcohol content alone, there was just no conceivable way of getting this one to be anything but that. It was so rich and flavorful; every sip you took was one less you were going to have to enjoy later on. It became infinitely more drinkable the warmer it got, really letting the hotness fade and becoming an incredible dessert."
"Pours dark brown in color. Smell is absolutely heavenly and among the best I've smelt in a stout. Reminds me of the nose on the Bells BA Expo/Double Cream blend! The taste is pretty damn close as well. This is truly a very incredible beer. Could use just a smidgen more thickness in the mouthfeel. The barrel aging is done to perfection. A very good vanilla and oak smell. This was easiily the best beer of the night."
"Drinkability: Some of these bourbon brews can really end up a slipshod, careless mess, but not this! Here, we can explore the rich complexities of a bourbon barrel job well done."
"D- though I'm not huge on alcoholic flavors, once you let this monster breathe its quite enjoyable. Applause for the amazing complexity and barrel flavors. This wont make my top ten or anything but it is a brew to try. Recommended"
"Pours a complete midnight jet black with a half finger tan colored head that dies down to a thin layer of bubbles. Rolling the snifter in my hand, a good amount of legs remain on the sides of the glass. First whiff is bourbon, but a very it's so smooth. A lot of dark fruits in the nose; raisins, dates, plums, and fig. A fair amount of brownie batter in the nose. A woody scent and sweet vanilla extract as well. Very complex brew to stick your nose into. Wow, coffee ice cream flavor up front that I wasn't expecting at all from the smell. Smokey wood flavor with a lighter than anticipated bourbon sting, but that's fine by me. Smooth alcohol flavor as it goes down that really warms the body. Aftertaste is sweet caramel malt with freshly ground french roast, I love it. Thick and creamy medium to full bodied mouthfeel with a very enjoyable carbonation. Make sure to take your time to savor this masterpiece, you'll be glad you did. I'm assuming this is the 2007 batch, I have another bottle I plan on aging to see what it turns into. Definitely do what you can to get your hands on this beauty."
"On tap at the 2007 barrel aged beer festival at the bistro in Hayward, CA. This one is dark. Super dark with ruby edges, and not much light penetrates the darkness. Aromas of oak, dark fruits, roasted malts and chocolate along with faint hops, which re much more muted in this version than in the regular old viscosity. Taste is more dark fruits with some nice bouron oak and dark stroh's 140 rum notes. Hops again, are muted, and the finish is all smooth bourbon/oak with some nice roast and bready deep malt to finish it off. Mouthfeel is thick and coating with a great percieved warmth, yet the drinkability remains amazingly smooth. One to cherish, for sure."
"Overall: Damn, damn delicious, and frightfully drinkable. After living in San Diego for a coupe of years and drinking Port on tap at one of the three locations several times a month (we traveled a lot) it's really one of the first things I've had from the Lost Abbey venture, and I'm delighted. It's balanced but bold, full but not hard. I love the stuff, and would buy a case if I could, lay down half, and drink a bottle every month or two."
"Sadly I can't give this beer the high marks I had hoped for it, and it's mostly due to the lack of carbonation. Not sure if all bottles were like this but mine could have been much improved. The overall flavor was high class though, so try it if you get the chance..."
"drinkable?: sure is. WINNER!"
"Drinkability: Is this ever impressive! Deserves all the accolades and then some (particularly in the bottlings that are properly carbonated, and I have had some that aren't)"
"D- This must be one of my favorite stouts. The bourbon is really strong in this and this is from the 2nd running on the barrel. I have one bottle from the first so that should be amazing. I will probably sit on the rest of the bottles for at least 4-5 years."
"Nov 2007 release. 375ml bottle. Black with a slight tan head. Huge bourbon nose with charred wood, blackened malts, and alcohol. Smooth, slick mouthfeel. Fantastic burnt malt, charred wood and whiskey vanilla flavors. Leaves a boozy whiskey taste on the breath to finish. A damn fine barrel aged brew. I m cellaring a couple bottles to see what happens here."
"On tap at Port/The Lost Abbey during the release 11/24/07. Poured into a 5oz flute glass, a black liquid with no head. The aroma on this beer was potent... I was able to get a really deep chocolate out of it with a woody alcohol character underlying it. The taste was chocolate soaked in oak. You do get a somewhat hot bourbony taste from it as well. The mouthfeel was incredible smooth making this beer a delicious sipper."
"Older Viscosity is one of those rarities that must be tried by any connoisseur of fine beers. This was an outstanding beer."
"Pitch black with a small, slowly forming light brown head. Very light aromas of butterscotch, cocoa, coffee and chocolate. Massive flavor, very intense and concentrated. Balanced, and definitely more malt accented than barrel accented. Much more chocolate, coffee, etc. comes through than the bourbon, oak, vanilla and coconut. Those barrel elements are still there, just lighter and in the back round. Its a nice beer and I really like it. Personally, Id like to see more wood character, but thats just me."
"This bottle listed at 13.75% ABV. Despite tasting like a bourbon-aged RIS, it bourbon-aged Old Viscosity. And that difference dollar-wise: $60 bottle, tax, and tip at Beerbistro. And a 375 ml at that. Very dark, some creamy head, with aromas of wine and bourbon, coffee and roasted barley. Smooth, the bourbon had worked in to the taste profile and this reminded me of the 28-year old Kourage RIS I had last year, except less boozy in the nose."
"This beer is much smoother than the regular version, which at times seemed on the verge of unbalanced; this instead is a great after dinner sipping brew. The oak flavors in this brew integrate really well with the bourbon notes; it is hard to tell at times which is which (considering bourbon is oak flavored this makes sense); spicy oak notes, buttery wood and vanillin may all contribute to the perception of bourbon overtones."
"BTW: metallitone1 , you rock! Thanks for the beer."
"D: Wow, this might just be the best barrel aged beer on the market. Simply delicious and entirely satisfying. Highly recommended for any stout or barrel aged beer lover."
"About the only real competition this one has is something like Alesmith's Speedway Stout - but Older Viscosity is a bit more complex and mature."
"Very interesting beer. Big bourbon/oak flavors and very rich. Well worth seeking this one out."
"Pours black with ruby hues, a small handful of oily looking reddish brown bubbles, not enough to call it foam really, crowd together and slowly dissipate. Aroma is rich with a nice big booziness. Sweet dark chocolate cake, some leather and a nice smokiness and woody aroma. Taste has good bourbony quality, the dark chocolate sweetness is mid taste but fairly faint. There is also a good dose of soy sauce like saltiness. The finish is comprised of a very nice alcohol warmth and a good dose of woody tasting dryness. Medium to heavy in body. Hints of the regular viscosity but much more bourbony. A very nice aroma and taste, the leather and soy qualities from the barrel ageing is quite nice and the woody dryness is a great finish. A very finely crafted beer, sipped on this one as long as I could make it last."
"I have been saving this for almost 3 months and am more than pleased with the outcome. The only beer I can compare this to is the Firestone 10th Anniversary brew. This is a very complex brew, and I wish I had a better palate to give it the review it deserves! Not one to drink everyday, but this is a great one. I need to move back to California..."
"375ml corked bottle: Thanks to Vac for sending me this gem. This one pours an almost syrupy dark brown color. No light seems to get through. There is about zero head on this one. There is definitely bourbon to the nose of this one. Some oak and vanilla notes also. Maybe even some cherries also. Very silky texture on the tongue. The taste has notes of coffee and chocolate up front, but a whole lot more is going on here. The bourbon is only slightly evident, and the alcohol is all but hidden. Some fruits and toffee also try and come through, but this one definitely has a complex and exquisite taste. This is superb!!!"
"Originally reviewed November 26, 2006. Poured at Port Brewing Company. Rich vinous aroma, dripping with syrupy Italian real marachino cherries, dark with caramelization and balsamic. Deep dark brown, with a caramel orange fringe and little head. Carbonation is a little restrained, but will come with time. Bright refined caramel corn flavor, along with toasted marshmallow and hazlenut creams. A very syrupy and rich presentation, but gentrified with the older oaky tones and a vinous quality that lends sophisiticatin to the sometimes brash leading edges. Sweeter, too, but not cloying or longing, as it leaves a crisp cherry finish. Excellent!"
"A must try if you like your ales strong...I know I do !"
"The previous reviewers notes made no mention of bourbon effects. Was I handed the wrong beer? There were several bourbon barrel beers there. Now I want to go back and sample all those beers again! ;-)"
"The carbonation was very low. I could've done with a tad more, but the overall flavors were outstanding. The mouthfeel was heavy and almost oily thick. This beer coated your mouth with mad flavor."
