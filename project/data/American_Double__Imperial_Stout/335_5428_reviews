"This is a dark and beautiful stout - it's slightly sweet to taste with vanilla & wood.  It's high alcohol content is a bit dangerous as it is a smooth drink"
"This on draft is so much better than bottles. It has an alcohol punch at the end that detracts a bit from the richness of the stout. But when I want a stout this is the one I drink.  @11% it gets the job done quickly. Another barrel aged brew I tend to lean towards."
""
""
"Smell is chocolate, oak, and whiskey. I like it already. Taste is creamy milk chocolate, hint of coffee. Surprisingly well balanced and mellow. I thought it was excellent"
""
"You can tell this is abv 10% by the taste.Also taste of chocolate."
""
""
""
"A little thin, but solid beer for a great price compared to competitors."
"This is a good beer to age. It is extremely boozy, which I like, but aging it really brings out the malt and vanilla flavor."
""
""
"Had this on draft and really liked it. This is definitely a slow sipper - sweet, thick, notes of vanilla and bitter chocolate, tobacco and oak, boozy. Fantastic bitter chocolate smell."
""
""
""
"I think this gets overlooked becasue its so widely available but a really great stout. Stronger whiskey notes than other similar overall enjoyable."
""
""
""
"STRONG whiskey flavors, somewhat unbalanced. It seems to me that they loaded the beer with whiskey just to get to an 11% ABV. This is a sipping beer for me. Does not go well with a meal in my opinion."

"I remember when I was still new to drinking craft beer and I had this for the first time, I was blown away by how good it was. Now revisting it a couple years later, it's not nearly as good as I once thought. But then there have been other beers which I used to not like which I now do. I guess tastes change. Anyway, with my present taste buds, I'd say this is a good beer, but there are tastier beers out there. Especially considering the price of this beer. Still, never a bad option."

""
""
"Beer straight from the teet of a dragon. Feels great and does the job quickly and thoroughly..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer surprised me. I though that the price was too high but at the initial smell I realized there was something hiding in this bottle. After pouring I discovered a dark luxurious color was hiding behind the bottles glass. After pouring the beer the smell definitely was a little sweeter than before and the initial taste was smooth and flavorful"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: like dessert in a glass, a nice creamy pastry/custard - would pair great with a rich chocolate cake; better shared, sweetness can become cloying"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a nice surprise."
"Bourbon and ethanol smell. Taste is strong on the ethanol, with bourbon and vanilla notable. Feel is a definite strong point, thick and creamy. Comes off almost like (rice?) pudding. Overall really good, not too sweet for a milk stout, but the bourbon could have shined through a little more."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good for the ABV"
"Didn't hide the alcohol very well but good beer."
""
"O - Way better than I remembered when I had it fresh.  Creamier and more balanced.  Maybe my palate changed but this is significantly better with age.  Looking forward to another one from the same 4 pack next year."
""
"Highly overrated, I feel like the alcohol taste is not covered up at all, that's the taste that really stands out on this one, overpriced as well, not an imperial stout fan, but I've paid a lot less Jackie O's dark apparition, which was outstanding."
"This stuff is strong and you probably aren't going to drink too many of them but they are fantastic. If I had one complaint about Dragons Milk it would be that there is (at least for me) a bitter alcohol aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Perfectly balanced and very drinkable for an imperial. Alcohol is well masked by unsubtle tones of vanilla and cream.  Just the right degree of bitterness and hints of oak."
"I love stouts but i guess I dont care for ones that taste like straight up bourbon and dietcoke searved in a burnt oak vessel no vanilla I could smell or taste if u like this style u love this me never again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good bourbon stout. Snifter. Nice flavor not too boozy"
"New Holland hit a gold mine!  Fresh malty smell, with a hint of bourbon.  Nice pour with a darker thin lacing.  Tastes like heaven.  A bit  thinner than most stouts.   The bourbon oak flavor mixes in perfect, with a hint of vanilla.  Smooth, clean finish.  Bottoms up!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Very smooth love the taste"
""
""
""
""
""
"My go-to barrel aged stout. Bourbon tidal waves knock you on your ass and you let yourself get sucked in by the vanilla undertow, not caring if you drown in its boozy bliss.  This is like the Black Sabbath of beers."
"Outstanding Stout with a creamy flavor.  I would definitely recommend  this beer."
""
"Bourbon boozey tastes, dark fruit, vanilla, a bit of malts,oakey. I like that bourdon boozey feel."
""
"New Holland Dragon's Milk -----4/5."
"Reminds me of Sam Adams Triple Bock. Caramel, sweet malt and licorice."
"Better than I remember. Bourbon is well layered but ends up dominating a bit. Base beer runs a touch sweet as well and the two elements don't quite meld. Still, it's tasty."
"I'm troubled by this beer. My biggest problem with it is that there is entirely too much going on. I feel like there are too many pieces, too many tastes, and too many places for the pallet to wander that you get caught up in a maelstrom of muddled tastes. The alcohol is too prominent in the beer and the milk stout and bourbon barrel favors disagree with one another making for beer that I won't have again. This is a personal taste note, so that being said, milk stout lovers will probably find this to be a welcome change in a new direction from New Holland brewing."
""
""
""
"One of the best stout commercially available."
""
""
""
"Wow, definitely a sipping beer. But amazing flavors and aroma."
""
""
"Just didn't appeal to me."
""
""
""
""
"Purchase Value  (B) – “Bombers” are typically more expensive than their six or four pack counterparts, and I’ve seen a four pack available for $14.99 locally. This is priced just about right considering the high ABV and fantastic taste. A beer that I would recommend aging and serving close to room temperature."
"Not quite as good as the Goose Island but a nice compromise."
""
""
""
""
"tried this after working 16 out of 24 hours in the fourth biggest snow storm in O'hare history so maybe this review is slanted a little. I thought the balance between bourbon and stout was very good, easy drinking. I usually like more bourbon. After shoveling 14 inches of snow the alcohol soothes the sore muscles. Very good beer"
"very nice to excellent rich flavor"
""
""
"Like this one a lot.  Seems I'm an ""outlier," so I need to elaborate.  The bourbon flavor does make it a bit harsh, but that's balanced by a smooth creaminess that makes a great combination.  The heartiness of the underlying stout itself is top notch as well, but I'm really not one to go into flowery descriptors so this will have to do."
""
""
"Really good beer. Bourbon notes are tasty and very smooth. Perfect beer for a cold, winter night"
""
""
""
"It's is impressive to me that a brewery can produce a consistent BBA stout available year around. That is the only thing I really like about this beer. I rate it as high as I do because I appreciate the qualities of the beer but just don't enjoy it. The bourbon flavor is overpowering me. Only drinking this in a pinch."
""
""
""
" The flavor profile is quite intense, very complex but poorly balanced.  Bourbon dominates throughout, resulting in the complex flavors being reduced to subservient roles.  It begins with a rush of bourbon that slowly allows a sweet caramel and chocolate to emerge.  Towards the middle, a mild roast bitterness comes forward against a slight bite of tannic oak.  The middle produces a very nice vanilla note.  The finish is dominated by alcohol, with notes of bourbon flavor, and the associated burn at the back of the throat.  As these subside, a sweet note of vanilla and oak linger with caramel characteristics.  Considering this is 11% ABV, they've done a fair job of covering it.  The main drawback is that the amazing complexity is never allowed to truly emerge."
""
""
"Overall:  This is another very good bourbon barrel-aged stout.  Maybe, well not maybe, definitely, not as complex as Goose Island’s Bourbon Country Brand Stout, Dragon’s Milk is still complex in its flavors of malt, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, vanilla and bourbon.  Delicious.  And for the price point, a much easier bourbon barrel-aged stout to drink more often!"

"Possibly old - flat in taste with over the top milk flavor"
""
""
"V - Good value, worth the money!"
""
""
""
"This one was a miss for me and did not meet expectations. The Barrel aging and alcohol presence overwhelm what could be the finer points of this brew."
""
""
""
""
"Dragon's Milk is no BCBS, but it is the best barrel-aged stout that I can find year-round without having to seek out special releases... There seems to be some quality control issues, though. Maybe it's in my head, but some bottles seem a little thin and flavorless compared to others, even within a single four pack."
""
"Pretty average at best here. Hoped for much more. Thin look, no quality base beer stands out, overpowered by the barrel character. Not bad, but just expected more having tried the chili version... which is much better"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quick summary: I thought this beer looked, smelled and felt very good. I thought the back-end of flavor was just too boozy for my own tastes, and that's really the only problem I had with this beer. I gave the remaining three bottles to my brother-in-law, who loves his whiskies, bourbons, and scotch. He loved this beer, so take that for it's worth."
"O- Booze is a little overwhelming, and the barrel aging just doesn't seem to match up to some of the better known barrel-aged stouts."
"Didn't have the flavor i expected from the description."
""
"My current favorite. Love the bourbon stout mix!"
""
""
""
"Best beer I've had in a while."
"Flavor is very rich right upfront, with notes of bourbon, cola, and extremely sweet vanilla.  The vanilla overpowers everything, way too sweet and cloying.  Mouthfeel is a bit slick.  Very one-dimensional, sickening sweet, and crazy expensive."
""
"This year's batch rings in at 11%.   I've found the flavor seems to be best as it warms up.  Tasty and certainly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"Pours solid black with nice one finger creamy head.  Smell the bourbon not much more.  Vanilla little hop a and big bourbon taste, the first I have liked big bourbon so not sure what they did.  Holy hell smooth with a bourbon burn.  Oh crap I may start joining my bourbon loving friends."
"The stout drinkers like and...the IPAers say, ehh"
"One of the best beers i have ever had."
"Poured into my snifter from a 22oz bottle. Deep, dark transluscent brown/black with no head to speak of. Strong aroma of whiskey, with some more subtle vanilla, oak, and a clean bitter note to boot. LOTS of barrel, also some dark malts, vanilla, oak, and reminder of the high ABV. Medium to heavy mouthfeel, coats the palate and let's the flavors linger. Warmth from the big ABV is def there. Maybe a bit too boozy for me, but it is growing on me as well. Nicely crafted overall."
""
"O: An extremely accessible, inoffensive yet unique stout that will be a favorite of mine among the other year-round available stouts."
""
"o: A very pleasant surprise, a near ideal BBS!  At first not quite as flavorful as my favorite, BBA  Backwoods Bastard Scotch Ale, but as a milk stout sweeter and with more body, and the bourbon flavor builds.  4.5  I want more!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Love this beer! Have had it many times. Glad to finally review it!."
""
"Overall - Very good BBA stout that's a little rough around the edges but comes through as a delicious beer, that can easily be enjoyed as long as you take your time. Immense bourbon flavors pretty much make sure that you sip this one."
"Fantastic Bourbon Barrel Stout.  Great flavor and feel."
""
""
""
""
"O- Seen this in the aisles for so long and finally just grabbed one for the eve. This is a nice warmer for the winter months. Not too heavy. Even though vanilla was noticeable, it mingled and balanced well with the rest of the profile. This was a pleasant intro to the style. I will pick up another to store for another cold day after I try a few more of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A reasonable price and true bourbon character are definite upside.  Fairly straight-forward, not a lot of nuance, but tasty nevertheless."
""
""
""
""
""
"Too much bourbon, not enough stout. Lighter in color than expected."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - this beer is great, no distro in maine yet for this brewery and it's sad. Very smooth and well balanced for a BBA stout and the lack of any alcohol aroma or taste is welcomed. Very refined, would certainly grab this again if I come across it."
""
"No balance to this beer.  Everything overwhelmed by the alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
"Vanilla with bourbon back note"
""
""
"O- Assuming that the label is true to its contents, the absence of alcohol burn in the nose and flavor is nothing short of impressive. Coupled with the fact that this is a year-round BBA Imperial Stout (~$15 4-Pack) and one that you don't need to risk life and limb to procure, Dragon's Milk is a more-than-worthy alternative to all the other 'white whales' swimming about the craft beer marketplace. Yes, I will purchase again. (4.5)"
""
"This is my first bourbon barrel stout.  I love the bourbon flavour."
""

"O (4) – Overall I  was wanting to see how it compared to BCBS.  It’s not quite there, but if you couldn’t find BCBS and had this, you’d be happy.  I had this at the end of the night, but I tried not to let that cloud the score."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep dark brown with faint garnet at the edges and a smallish bubbly beige head that dissipates quickly. Aromas of roast, caramel, vanilla, light wood and bourbon with a faint cardboard. Little to no hop aroma, this one seems a bit sweet based on the nose. The flavor is roasty caramel with hints of toffee, vanilla and light oak. Light fruity notes midway through with a sweet bourbon and brown sugar linger at the end of every sip. Medium body, light level of carbonation. Nice easily assessable barrel aged stout. The oxidation in the nose is a little off putting, but the beer is quite tasty."
""
""
""
"o: a really unbalanced beer, but i still find it quite tasty.  could definitely benefit from age, or having more stout flavour presence.  this will really satisfy barrel-aged beer enthusiasts"

"One word to describe this beer,  that being AMAZING. I never thought I would be able to rate a beer as a 5. Even my favorite beers I wouldn't give a 5 to cause the aren't perfect. This beer hit the top in every way imaginable."

"Overall - An interesting brew.  Not over the top in sweetness or bourbon, but still packs a punch in ABV.  Very drinkable and a nice well rounded flavour.  I guess I was expecting something more robust, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Can't see this improving with age really, seems about perfect now."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very well made and blended. It definitely doesn't lack any flavor. Very good. New Holland hasn't disappointed me yet."
""
""
"This was one of my first BA stouts and at the time thought was fantastic, but now that I've sampled many others... it's still good, but like others better.  Has a sweet more of a creamer taste compared to others that are more chocolate and coffee flavors."

"love this oak aged stout with rich vanilla undertones."

"Such a great stout. bought this back in September and put it in the cellar until last night when I put it in the fridge. opened it up tonight and man, this is what a bourbon barrel aged stout should taste like. Just enough bourbon to taste but not overwhelming. I only wish it poured a larger head. at 11% I'm already feeling it"

"A stout meant to be enjoyed in single servings, as far as I'm concerned. Knocking several of these back might knock you into tomorrow. Honestly this might be better if pared back to 10% as in years past, I don't see the value proposition in amping it up to this level. The alcohol suppresses some of the more muted malt flavors you'd expect to find in a proper stout, even BBA varieties."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great stout. Best if you enjoy a combination of malt, coffee, chocolate, and hops flavor with oak barrel influences. The label lists 10% alcohol, and it does taste like it. This is definitely the taste of an excellent stout.  The 2013 is more intense than the 2014.  Do not know if this is due to the year it was made, or whether it is due to the year aging."
""

"Overall a pleasing sipper for a style that I don't typically gravitate towards."

"OVERALL:  Since New Holland’s arrival in Colorado this has quickly become a go-to for me.  I love big, imperial stouts and I love bourbon barrel-aged beers…it’s a treat to be able to have both any time of year now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Purchased in Vermont for $14.99 a four pack (when did we start getting New Holland?).  Nice stout, nice level of bourbon flavor- but lacks the thicker body that I like in this kind of beer."
""
"O: I really like this beer, a solid but different take on a bourbon-barrel stout than you'll find elsewhere, pretty approachable for 11% with good barrel character, and easy to find anywhere in MI. Also sweet name and cool bottle art."
""
"I am torn on this beer.  I do not think it's that great, but I'm not sure it's as bad as I am rating it.  Even though I rated body the highest, I wish it were a bit thicker.  About the only other thing that maybe justifies the ranking is a seeming lack of any bourbon notes that I could recognize (maybe it's what adds the ""cola"" taste I mentioned)."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Nice Chocolate Vanilla taste, vanilla nose, solid lacing. The bourbon barrel aging comes thru but not too strong; especially for an 11%er. My first experience with New Holland; I'm impressed. Think this would be even better with nitro, its a little on the thin side; think it would also be better if aged a year. My rating of 4.25 is pretty generous I think; maybe closer to a 4."
"A very serviceable beer !!!"

"Not a fan of stouts, but this was surprisingly smooth. Vanilla notes, and oak, just as advertised. The alcohol taste was very well hidden."

"ALCOHOL   VERY STRONG NOT AS SMOOTH   LOL"
"Decent beer, but way too bourbony and boozy for me. I prefer a stout where the coffee and chocolate flavors are profiled, this one is not balanced at all. I'll finish it but it may take me all afternoon, it is definitely a ""big"" beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very good beer. The bourbon could be more intense, but as it is the beer is very well balanced and goes down extremely well."
""
""
""
"While the style is not my preference, this is very well executed.  Those who enjoy high ABV beers will rate this stout highly"

"12oz bottle. 2014 Vintage. Pours a dark brownish black color with a thin ring of khaki head. Good amount of lacing. The aroma is Bourbon at first followed by some oak, vanilla, roasted malts, and chocolate. The taste is bourbon and oak. Chocolate and roasted malts as well. Hints of charcoal and earth. Finishes with some nice Bourbon notes. Very noticeable alcohol warmth. Lightly carbonated with a heavy-ish mouthfeel. This is a great year round Bourbon Barrel Aged Stout. Overall, fantastic."

"A most impressive tasting stout. The flavors and feel really shine with big, robust character. The malt component creates a deliciously dark treat; sweetness and bitterness all nicely balanced. The relatively high alcohol content is noticeable but doesn't over-ride any of the malt and hop goodness while the bourbon barrel aging greatly adds to the overall character of the beer. Another fine Michigan beer offering..."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown, near black with a thick head. The smell was very sweet with both the malt and vanilla. There wasn't any real wood I could pick up on in the nose. The taste was very nice with vanilla, malt, and coffee and chocolate flavors being predominant. The bourbon wood came through in the finish with an oakey, slightly sweet flavor that I found delicious."

"A 10 oz. pour at Tyler's Taproom in Apex on 9/15/2014. Dark, decent head. Aroma more like a lighter roast. Milk chocolate and toffee flavor. A bit of alcohol toward the finish. Bittersweet finish. Heavy body and medium carbonation. Sit on this for 6 months to let the alcohol mellow, and put it on nitro, it would be near perfect."

"Very strong alcohol nose and taste at first, a little more than my rookie self likes.  As it warms up however, the ""alcoholness"" fades (though never disappears) to a much more enjoyable level and the taste is much more balanced.  Enjoyed it quite a bit after the alcohol burn faded, not so much 'til then."

"O-It is nice to see this beer in Colorado. It may not be a huge, complex, special-occasion-sipper like Uncle Jacobs or BCS, but it drinks quite well for the price (I can get four of these for the price of one UJ). I like the mouthfeel, in particular, which has a nice chewy texture that fits well with the flavors."

"Overall: If you have never tried this beer and you like stouts that are not too burnt tasting, not too much of that coffee thing. This I think is referred to a ""milk stout", which is a style I am now just discovering, because honestly it was not something I would have normally tried. But, thanks to Beer Camp and the double latte for turning me on to this style."
""
"Poured into a snifter. Appearance is nearly black, with a half-inch creamy light brown head that faded within a minute or two. The nose is very boozy up front, almost mediciny, with some slight notes of coffee, chocolate and vanilla. I didn't get the alcohol in the taste, as the malts covered it nicely. A bit of chocolate and some dark fruit flavors lasted on the back end. As it warmed, the chocolate really came out.  I thought the mouthfeel was a little thin for such a big beer. Overall, a pretty damn good imp stout, I'd buy it again! I'm going to throw a few in the cellar to see well they hold up with some time on them."

"Overall:  For an 11% bourbon barrel aged imperial stout, this is one I'll have to buy and age for a bit.  This was a nice sipper that got better when it warmed up a bit."

"04/26/14 From bottle. Started out on the wrong foot. I was eating & this just didn't enhance the meal at all. Once I was finished & it had warmed a bit, it showed a multi-layered profile. The most impressive taste to me was the toffee. I've heard this characteristic used many times but it has eluded me...until this bottle. Very smooth with a strange mix of oiliness but not particularly thick. Next time I'll get a piece of sharp cheese to play off the best of this well made brew. Hold the presses...10%? A very deceptive 10%."

"This is an extremely rich-flavored stout. It's a special occasion kind of beer. Like old friends getting together, or a brisk fall evening by the fire, or just to enjoy on a Friday night with tunes spinning on the turntable, like I'm doing right now."

"Pours clear and almost black in color can barely see through it unless you hold it up to the light then its very dark reddish brown. Smells very oaky and sweet with notes of vanilla low high carbonation tastes extremely overpowering...nope IS overpowering, way tooo rich! gut-rot! style I'd give a 3 out of 5 over all for me thoe a 1.5. The local craft beer magazine here ""The Growler"" I usually agree with but the review on this one couldn't be more off: ""Super creamy stout"" I find the body very thin for a stout. ""Loads of caramel"" I wish, I didn't even get a hint of it! ""Tootsie Rolls"" where?! ""Roasted nuts"" Nope!"
""
"This is a very nice stout, and certainly the kind of beer a bourbon lover would love. I would prefer the bourbon to take more of a back seat; I'd imagine age does this beer very well. This is a very good beer, but it definitely cannot match up with the best versions of the style."

"O- When so many people chase KBS and BCBS, it's nice to have a decent, readily available barreled stout!"

"Dragon's Milk is quite the beer, through and through - a carefully-crafted but miraculously executed bourbon barrel stout, combining numerous different flavors and wonderful aromas to make a winning product. Only wish it wasn't so thick and filling, but it's a small price to pay for such a pleasant beer."

"Very good stout. A little too strong but as dessert perfect. Smell and taste are beautiful together! You can clearly smell that this stout is brewed in a bourbon barrel as the smell clearly provides some strong bourbon flavor which is great. This beer is definitely brewed to enjoy slowly. I agree with some people who can taste some chocolate taste (ties back into dessert)."
""
""
""
""
"Ehhh. I am disappointed. 1 bottle costed $6, had an epic name/label....and it looked fantastic when I poured it. Beautiful persistent off white head and just about pitch black color. The smell was very mild. What I did smell was mostly bourbon/whiskey. A bit of roasted malt. Taste was a huge let down. Tastes like cough syrup. I don't taste coffee, or chocolate, a bit of bourbon, mostly an artificially flavored dark fruit cough syrup. That was the mouth feel too, like a cough syrup. Disappointed. Won't buy again."

"This is another amazing stout... I can smell bourbon, coffee, chocolate, and vanilla on the pour. Nice finger-thick head that slowly dissipates to a nice thick disk of foam, with great lacing around the glass. Taste has all of the above plus all the malt you can stand, plus a little hops in the backbone. The alcohol is noticeable on the finish. Overall, this is a good sipper for a night!"

"This beer deserves a higher score than 89. If you enjoy bourbon aged ales, you will adore this malt monster. Not for the weak of heart at 11%. It has an alcohol forward taste that does not mellow as it warms. A true work of art as far as my taste buds are concerned."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - As I have stated, I would like to see more of a bourbon character in a beer with bourbon right there on the label. With that being said, this is an excellent beer otherwise, and highly recommended. Just forget the bourbon part, and drink it as an imperial stout or something like that."
""

"O: This has got to be the easiest drinking 11% abv bourbon barrel aged stout I've ever had. It goes down with the ease of a milk stout. It's not the most complex brew of its ilk by a longshot, but it makes up for it with pure hedonistic drinkability. The body and texture are excellent. The high price tag might put a damper on its reception in the market though."

"Overall: Really well done beer. Compared to other ""widely available, value BBA beers"" (read: Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale), it *towers*. This is a smooth as silk beer to please any stout lover. My only complaint is that it's maybe *too* easy to drink."

"Black in color and nearly entirely impenetrable to light. Just a trace of fingernail thin khaki colored head covers the edges of the glass. Aroma of bourbon and dark malt is moderately present. The flavor is heavily weighted with bourbon,dark malt,chocolate,fig,and caramel. The mouth is chewy and sticky."

"12 oz bottle. Pours dark brown with tall, long lasting, creamy, beige head and nice lacing. Aroma is of bourbon, roasted malt, dark fruit, wood and coffee. Body is full, creamy and smooth. Taste is of bourbon, roasted malt, coffee, vanilla, brown sugar, dark fruit and herbal hops. Finish is long and boozy, which I like. It will be my favorite RIS."

"What a nice surprise! On a road trip, stopped Father's Day at 6 Autumns, attached to the Ramada Inn off I-69 in Angola, Indiana for the evening. Nice beer menu, I asked the resident ""beer-meister"" what he would recommend based on my comment that I liked Samuel Smith's Taddy Porter and Imperial Stout. He gave me a couple samples (30 beers on tap) and I loved this one especially for the bourbon finish. The next day I stopped at a store in town and bought a bottle to bring home to Georgia."

"Update:the 2013 version is definitely better. Smoother, more bourbon, sweetness, and general cohesion. The 14 version is 11% vs 10% so it makes me wonder whether they changed the formula a bit. Get the 13 if you can!"

"Poured from a bottle in late May on a warm sunny afternoon. Appearance is very dark - almost like a cola with a slight but creamy tan head. This is a beer with a 10% alcohol content and you taste it but that's not a negative. Very smooth, velvety mouthfeel. Hints of the bourbon barrel aging are very noticeable but not overpowering. Hints of roasted caramel and some vanilla as well. A very strong flavored beer as you would expect from an Imperial Stout. Not an easy drinking beer because the favors are so powerful but very good. I'll probably enjoy it more in tHe winter but it's definitely on the list to buy again."

"O- after being fairly let down by the (in my opinion) overhyped Brooklyn Black Ops, this bourbon barrel stout blew me away. Smooth and delicious with just the right amount of vanilla. It seems the bourbon aged brews are having quite a moment. I see news ones every time I go to my local beer shop. This one to me, though, will definitely be one I'll pick up whenever I come across it."
"Not a bad stout, I'd definitely buy some more!"
""
""
""
""
"Edit: Have had many BBA stouts since and this seems a bit thin and watered down. The bourbon notes are spot on, but it definitely needs more roasted malt to balance it out. Not quite rich and robust for me to be a benchmark for the style. Still a solid option for its availability at a fair price in my area"

"O: Very nice bourbon barrel stout. Body is light for a stout, but the flavor is phenomenal and compensates well. A well made beer, enjoyable to drink. Be advised at 10% ABV this is not session...enjoy one and move on. This is a favorite, and is sure to be enjoyed many more times."

"Very delicious beer. Definitely will add this to my rotation. If your like full flavored darker beers this is for you. I only wish they came in greater than four packs. The alcohol content is nice as well, after one beer I felt a buzz. This is a nice smelling well flavored product."

"Drinkability: Could not drink more than one of these, quite strong, but absolutely delicious!"

"Having tried this for the third time, I'd have to say it is a decent barrel aged stout. However, for the price (outside of MI) it probably does not warrant a higher rating. I don't even consider comparing this to BCBS which to me, is a bourbon barrel aged stout unto itself. So, I would compare this more closely to Fegley's Insidious bourbon barrel aged stout: a more comparable, lower level version of the style. After trying both, I'd recommend getting your hands on the Fegley's first and then the Dragon's Milk. I understand there are many fans of this beer. But I would not buy a 4 pack at the price I paid ($16) again."

"Pours dark with white lacing that turns into a very thin head like most imperial stouts. The smell is of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, whiskey, and esters. The taste is really wonderful it starts with chocolate and vanilla and ends with whiskey, coffee, and warming alcohol. The alcohol taste is present, but that really should be expected when you age something in bourbon barrels for long enough. The mouth feel is lighter than a lot of imperial stouts, but not thin. Overall, I would drink a KBS or a backwoods bastard first, but due to their low availability this is definitely a go to bourbon barrel stout. I will be drinking this one again."
"This is a very unique beer that is awesome in flavor. The first time I had this I absolutely hated it, but have really developed my liking for stronger beers, which this certainly is. This beer is also very good to cook with as well, adding great flavors."

""

"Pours a very dark almost black color with little head. Its high alcohol content is apparent both in the smell as well as the taste. Somewhat overbearing flavor to me, which is surprising because I tend to drink stouts regularly. Chocolate taste with a mix of fruits makes for a smooth taste and feel in the mouth. Very strong beer."

""
""
""
""

"This is a very interesting beer. Not for a beginner to craft beer, but a nice enjoyable sipper that drinks much smoother than the 10% ABV would indicate. A touch on the side of too much oak, but very good overall."

""
""
""

"very drinkable. really heavy on the dark fruits, vanilla, bourbon. sweet aromas, milky. hints of roast. medium to thin feel, not chewy or thick. alcohol is hidden well. good drink for the ABV. flavors aren't really grabbing me this time. I've had better bottles of this, this one's okay"

"The beer actually starts off pretty good, but strangely gets a bit more thin and lifeless as time goes on. There's nearly no flavor in the back palate or the finish either which seems real odd and doesn't give a good round oak character. I get the sense this beer spent barely any time at all in a barrel."
""
"A very good beer, I'm not a huge barrel-aged fan as a general rule, so I may be underscoring it a bit. I will say it smells absolutely heavenly... complex and rich with fantastic spices dancing on the nose that play off the bourbon. I ended up sitting on the last 2 ounces of the glass, just swirling it for a long time and drawing in lovely smells."
""
"( this particular stout varys from batch to batch) I luckily managed to snag the 11% alcohol batch woohoo ;)"
""

""
""
""
"Finally got New Holland in TN, heard good things. Four pack purchased at Craft Brewed. Great looking pour. Thick dark brown head, black in color. Heavy scents of bourbon, vanilla, smoke and chocolaty malt. Rich, warming flavor. The bourbon flavor is there but not overpowering. More tones of toffee, chocolate, and a vanilla after taste. Somewhat boozy, heavy bodied, thick, and sticky. Definitely lives up to the hype. A solid BBS that's a bit on the sweeter side."
""
""
""
"O-I don't drink a ton of stouts, but this was nice. good to sip as the night winds down. you can definitely pick up on the wood aging from the bourbon barrels. I look forward to cellaring a couple of these and trying again somewhere down the road."

"If they called this a bourbon barrel aged porter or something other than a stout, I suspect there would be a lot more love - and it would be well-deserved. Nice job, New Holland."

"So this is my go-to stout. i must say that it may just be me but the later/current versions taste a bit sweeter than the original (but that may just be me). Anyway-don't be scared at the high 4 bottle price as it's well worth it (pairs great with a thick cut grilled T-Bone BTW). If your local craft pub has this on draft - even better. I actually had it on nitro once and well...long strange trip/story there...be careful as this dragons tail will leg sweep you before you know it - enjoy!"

"Dramatically underrated stout, beautiful cascade of foam from the effervescent center for chocolaty aroma. The mild undertones of chocolate and coffee pair effortlessly in the taste utopia that is dragons milk. The finish is smooth as the teet of a playboy bunny on your 18th birthday. This beer is a homerun!"
"Poured from a bottle into snifter glass from a 2013 Vintage. Certainly a good candidate to rival bourbon county stout. Definitely considering the $9 a piece bottle price. Smell is great and taste exceeds that. Definitely a great bourbon barrel aged stout. I will be buying a bunch and aging some as well."

"Overall this is a bit thin for the style, a bit too alcoholic with not enough dextrins left in the body to balance it out. Flavour was decent with a lot of bourbon barrel, not much else, some moderate hops, so it makes for an overall tasty but somewhat bland stout. Certainly not a world-beater."

"This brew is dark black with purple, red, and orange tints about the edges like a sunset stamped out by dark clouds. The smell is reminiscent of plums, chocolate milk, molasses, and sun-dried raisins. The syrupy, above medium mouthfeel adheres to the tongue. Sun-dried raisins, figs, bourbon, and chocolate milk compose the base flavors. This beer gave me goosebumps. The look, texture, and taste reminded me of Pedro Ximenez sherry, the main differences being that the wine is sweeter and thicker and lacks the malty grains."

It had a bit of a boozy finish. Velvety feel across my tongue. Overall a very enjoyable stout. Could sit and have more than one of these on a cold winter day."
"O - This beer has held up very well and I prefer it with some age on it. I usually like BB stouts fresh, but this was a bit harsh when fresh. The age mellowed it out, but kept the bourbon notes. Quite good with 2 years on it."

"Dragon's Milk is a very enjoyable beer. The vanilla syrup quality on the palate is a little different at first, but the smokey and boozey finish is a very nice contrast. Add to that, the feel of this beer is great and makes it a joy to sip. Strong, but not overbearing, rich, but not cloying. This beer rides a fine line, and does it artfully."

"O- I'm astonished that this beer presently has a score of just 88. This is one of the best bourbon barrel aged stouts I've ever had and you can check my track record to verify that I've had some of the best. Maybe the fact that it is so smooth and hides its char, oak and ABV well is why some people aren't down with it. Not enough in-your-face extremity. If you want a well-balanced, smooth and drinkable BBA stout, this one's for you."

"Pours dark cola brown/black with a light brown head. Smells oaky, a little chocolate, some sweetness and bourbon. Tastes of wood, bourbon, dark dried fruits, dark chocolate, sweet malt and did I mention wood? A little sweet maybe and quite boozy, but enjoyable. Mouthfeel is hot with alcohol and medium of carbontation. Not bad. Overall, this is very good, but lacks some of the complexities of other robust stouts. A good, but not great imperial stout at a good price. I might revisit this one again soon, but it would depend on the availability of other stouts."

"Overall, I really like bourbon so this is a real tasty beer but I feel it is a little unbalanced. Bourbon really dominates the whole thing and there isn't any room for the other flavors to come through. Lacking some complexity but still a pretty nice beer."

I couldn't get enough of this beer so lives up to its name. i could drink this beer all day long anywhere at any time.

"Bought a 4 pack of this item. I Drank the first one in the bottle and enjoyed but as a casual drinker this was too much alcohol. So after that I enjoyed it as a shot for me and a buddy while drinking another beer. This is really good but I prefer to drink as shots."

"Just found a 12 oz four-pack of this at Woodlake-Kohler, after experiencing a Bourbon Stout in small glasses at Central Waters Brewery in Amherst Wisconsin, which I was not permitted to buy a growler of. (I settled for their Coffee Stout, which is also excellent.) Dragon's Stout is comparable. Delicious, full-bodied. Outrageously expensive, perhaps, but comparable to that on draft at Central Waters. The 10% alcohol content is shocking for a stout, which one expects to be low-alcohol and low calorie."

"O: Looked good, smelled fine. Unfortunately, it all fell apart when it hit my mouth. An expensive drain pour."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is an oily black coloring with a thin, filmy, ring of chocolate brown head. Aromas of rich bourbon notes, vanilla highlights, boozy highlights, creamy notes, and a subtle bitterness in the backbone. Interesting nose, but very heavy and boozy. Flavors are heavily roasted, with a solid roast coffee bitter backbone, heavy bourbon notes, with vanilla highlights and oak notes, and a building warmth as you drink. The coffee bitter notes build, as well, into the aftertaste, mixing with booze and vanilla/oak. Very dynamic aftertaste on a slick, oily body. Roasted and boozy linger into the slick finish. Good flavors, but a bit out of balance."

"It seems that a small percentage of the people who have this beer have a similar experience. Perhaps it's genetic, like those who think cilantro tastes like soap. Perhaps it's just bad on tap. Perhaps it's a bad beer. I don't know, but I won't be trying it again."

"This is an awesome beer. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a 160oz glass. Comes our black with a minimal tan head and a little carbonation. The aroma is a bourbon and chocolate with little hints of vanilla. The taste is great. As soon as it hits your mouth you get a chocolate/vanilla mix. The back end is mostly bourbon. It's the perfect combination. The beer is not too thin or thick. It's just right. I actually prefer this beer over KBS."

"This little guy is spot on with the ratings. almost opaque in color with very little head and light lacing. Smell is woody with boozy plum and raisins. Taste is spiced turkish coffee wifh a slick start. The more it warms, the more the bourbon comes through. The mouthfeel isn't chewy as one might think, but a little easier on the back of the throat. The taste overall though, is of spiked coffee with an aftertaste of straight soy sauce! If you can get past that, this is a very good sipping beer."
""
""
"Poured into becker pint glass; oily brown pour, black in the glass with a medium tan head that sticks around leaving nice lacing. Smell is dark fruit, bourbon, vanilla and oak. Taste is big roasted malt, dark fruits bathed in boozy bourbon, with vanilla and oak finishing out a mellow, sweet finish with alcohol heat washing everything down. While not as well-balanced as other big name ones, this is a good easily accessible BA imperial stout. It's a bit messy compared to BCBS, but still good. Mouthfeel is full but a bit too slick, I'd prefer a bit more creaminess."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the perfect sipping beer. The oak barrel aging gives it an amazing heart and soul. You will taste the sweet malt, and a nice touch of hop bitterness. But the oak resins really come through, and mix with the high ABV to make a beer that has all the sipping satisfaction of a fine bourbon. This is probably my favorite beer so far. Try it if you can!"
"I will return to update as I get better at reviewing beers, but this beer along with a couple other drinks is the reason I am getting into brewing. A friend gave me a couple of bottles because they did not like it. I was amazed. I almost broke the bottle open to lick the remaining nectar from the shards. I love the deep taste with a bourbon kick! I drank it straight from the bottle since I was in a hotel room and did not expect to enjoy it that much, so I don't have much to say about the appearance and the smell is like most stouts, which are not the most floral."

"O: 4.0 great beer, especially for being readily available. This is one I have every so often, and that will continue."
""
""
"overall: A great barrel aged stout, lot's of alcohol presence, and some great oak and roasted malt flavors, this is a big beer. The price could be a little better, but it's definitely a satisfying brew. If you like barrel aged, try this if you see it, I wouldn't say go out of your way to seek it out, but you shouldn't be disappointed."
"2012. Pours dark brown. It's lighter than expected and and I can see through two to three inches of liquid to the bottom of my little snifter. Small beige head. Pretty good retention and lacing for the style and strength. The aroma is dominated by sweet bourbon. Stout flavors are sitting in the background, mostly just contributing some sweet caramel and chocolate.. The bourbon is nice enough, if a bit simple. Lots of vanilla and toffee. Taste is similar. Everything about this beer just seems simple and sweet. There's some more nice milk chocolate, caramel, sugar cane, vanilla, maybe a touch of pepper, but little depth. Good deal of booze in both taste and aroma. Mild oak. Maybe a touch of roast in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and kinda sticky. Finish is sweet and boozy. At first blush, I thought this beer surpassed my low expectations, but ultimately, I think my memories of sips at tastings and whatnot were spot on. It's better than Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale, which I admit is a pretty low bar, but it's still just a sweet, simple beer dominated by sweet, simple bourbon flavors."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Overall it's pretty good, but to me, it won't justify the crazy price. For less, I could have something I like so much better. Don't let that be discouraging, I paid $5 for a glass, which is fine, It's not that enticing to me to buy more of it. Still, I'd recommend it, quite interesting."
""
"O - Loved this beer. This was my first time trying it and I will definately be picking it up again. Reminded my of Founders KBS. It was not quite as smooth and seemed to get a little harsher as it warmed. But it had tons of flavor and it a great beer. Could only handle one at a time though!"
""

"Overall: As delicious or better than most of the highly sought after BA beers, at half the cost (at least) and 700 times the availability."
""
""
""
""
"Very well balanced the barrel aging rounds out this whole beer. Not overly hoppy or overly malty. This is a very good beer to start out with, that is easily assessable to everyone and therefore should be a good starter beer because it is a good representation of what the imperial stout should taste like."
""
"Poured a very dark brown with a 1/2 finger mocha colored head that quickly dwindled to a small remnant with a little bit of lacing. Smell is all bourbon, with just a hint of plum on the pour and also as the beer warms. Taste is bourbon and chocolate, with a hint of plum/prune. Just a hint of the roasted malt on the backend, but you really have to search for it. This is definitely a sipper, and is a fantastic dessert beer. Carbonation seems to be about medium. Almost a little syrupy in mouthfeel. All in all, a very enjoyable high-gravity beer. Will definitely pick up more of this beer at the next opportunity!"

"this is a fantastic beer! It reminds me of a women i knew once some time ago. Deep, dark and a bit boozey. Looks sexy, the body filling out every curve of the glass its in. A little light in the head but still worth approaching. Face to face you can smell the roastiness of coffee and the sweet scent of chocolate masking the slight alcohol presence, as though it's coming straight off of, or barreling straight into, a bender of epic scale. Either way, you want to experience this gorgeous thing befoer you. At 10%abv, you know she will screw you up if you're with her too long, but you just can't help yourself because after that first taste makes your mouth tingle with excitement, you're hooked."

"Overall: very well put together double. By far my favorite commonly found new holland beer, and I think most would agree with me."
"A dark beer, but not as dark as expected for a stout, definitely not opaque. I would compare it in color to a Belgian strong dark ale. The aroma and taste are almost completely dominated by oak and bourbon. Any roasted flavor was almost completely hidden. It was an enjoyable beer, and I would recommend giving it a try. However, I would not have known it was a stout if it hadn't been written on the menu, and since I was expecting a stout, I was a little disappointed."
""
""
""
"O: It's not undrinkable, however its sweetness is way too fatiguing. Even worse, the beer itself seems designed to showcase the barrel notes, but they're far too basic to really succeed at that, either. For about 6 oz, I thought this was pretty good; for the other 6 oz, I couldn't wait for it to end. So, if you're gonna try it, make sure you split it with a friend, and don't expect BCBS."

"My review will be misleading perhaps, because I don't like bourbon. And this is a Bourbon Barrel Stout! But in spite of that, I'm going to do my very first review here after a year or so of reading all of everyone else. Mouthfeel is nice and thick but to me, which I love. But that 10% ABV is right up front - as is a bit of that bourbon barrel flavor. Everything about the rest of this beer stands behind that. Not that I don't like my hefty ABV - just I think you have to like bourbon, or at least be warm to it, to really enjoy this one. Still glad I bought it. (Probably the 10% ABV that caused me to write my first review! LOL!)"

It's been a while since I have had this stout and I remember it being sweeter, almost too sweet, but this vintage is very nice and well balanced with the bourbon presence balancing out the sweet malt. As stated earlier, I can't wait for next winter to drink this and see how it matures in the bottle. Cheers."

"Even though it is a high ABV beer and that is understood, the taste of alcohol is overbearing at first. Further in, the beer has a distinct flavor of bourbon and toffee. Excellent beer just know what you are getting into at 10% ABV. I would drink this (slowly) again and enjoy it very much."
"Overall - I love this beer. One of the best in its style and available year round."

" Pours up black as an ageless storm, small head of color I cant remember. Aroma is so easy and pleasant on my senses. Malty, warm, hint of earth. I sip. I go into a coma. I recover three weeks later. The flavor profile was electric. Big barrel smoothness, malty, oak, vanilla, vanilla, vanilla, some hops came by to see how I was doing but left shortly thereafter. The body was big, the carbo was smooth. Then, I awoke. Strange. No bottle in sight. No beer residue in my glass. Had I really drank the elixir...or was it all a dream..."

"This beer pours pitch black with a small off tan colored head. The beer is more oak forward then I was expecting. A nice oak presence reminds me of a bourbon barrel aged brew and has a nice dry crispiness to it. The beer is fairly roasty but has a strong toffee and burnt caramel presence to it. It is fairly sweet and sugary. A nice chocolate presence from this beer. There is a portion of this beer that reminds me of and English stout like Samuel Smiths but im not sure what the flavor comes from. A solid stout and a nice example of Oak aging."

"Poured into a 16 oz Goblet. A dark, dark ruby red appearance with a one finger head that disappears rather quickly leaving a thin rim of tan foam. Smell - Alcohol, ripe plums, heavy vanilla, maple syrup, over-toasted almonds.... did I mention the alcohol! Taste - Burnt toast, nice roasted maltiness, the high alcohol level is prevalent throughout and comes back strong at the very end warming the throat. Medium mouth feel, a bit lighter than expected. Overall - a lot going on with this stout. Complex and very pleasing. Could be a little better balance between the alcohol and other ingredients but excellent nonetheless. Glad I picked up and 4 pack!"

"O- A tasty brew with a variety of complex flavors. I enjoyed the aged oak taste that this stout provides. It is both interesting and delicious and the ABV certainly packs a punch."
""
""
"Pours a molassy dark brown - NOT opaque however - light penetrates through with an amber glow. The aroma of vanilla is there - but no clue of the wood. The initial mouthfeel was lighter than expected as this is billed as from the High Gravity Series and I had expected a maltier (thicker) body. The first taste revealed the high gravity was more at> alcohal content than malt and thus more watery. This can be appreciated in many circles - I recall a friend's college dorm homebrew recipe called ""Beggers Blend"" impressively gifted in a high gravity Alc-by-Vol content that was sought after for any late hours party (it was basically a dextrose bomb). That comment aside, this beer definitely has more craft at work than those creations. The oak shows up in the flavor in front trumpet while the vanilla plays Montovani (cascading background strings). I'd like to see more work on this creation more at> heavier body while maintaining the Alc-by-Vol. It is a nice beer with a great name and crafte base that deserves a little further in refinements."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into New Holland glass. Appearance is a very dark brown with lighter brown light passage at the ends. Next to nothing in the way of head and lacing. The nose starts with vanilla and has a heavy dose of oak. A fair amount of booziness is present on the nose with a slight harshness which seems to comes from the spirit. The base beer seems hidden on the nose, perhaps some light cocoa character, but not much else. Taste is is oaky up front and heavy with vanilla in the middle. Again, not getting much base beer here, not sure if it is supposed to be stout or strong ale, but either way, I get little in the way of malt and hops. Just like the nose, a heavy boozy harshness comes at the end and leaves a slight burn. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for the high gravity with moderate to high carbonation. Overall, this beer is a little one dimensional and lacks the backbone that I like in barrel aged beers. It's a nice and easily attainable bourbon barrel aged beers, but there are others I would turn to first."

"My tastes have changed greatly over time, and Dragon's Milk doesn't quite impress me as much as it once did. However, it's still not an awful choice considering there aren't many ""year round"" bourbon barrel aged stouts on the shelves. It's a bit too hot to enjoy in any quantity, but it's a relatively decent introduction to the style. If you remotely like Dragon's Milk at all, you're gonna love plenty of other BBA stouts."
"I love strong brew. I love stouts. With that said Dragons Milk from New Holland is one of the best that fits into both of those categories. It starts malty and strong, then bites so good! It has a dry mocha finish. A great bomber pick up on a cold night! Cheers!"

"It was like a shot and a beer rolled into one. 10 abv."
"Final Thoughts: A little let down because of the slightly thin body. However, it hits all the right notes in terms of flavor and doesn't disappoint when it comes to the oak aged quality. Would I drink it again? It would not be my go-to Imperial Stout but I would give it a try on-tap."

"O - Still one of my top 5 beers period! If you like stouts or bourbon barrelled ales at all, give this a shot. The best New Holland brew I've tasted. Maybe the best beer I've tasted. Always available."
""
""
""
"Putting style to the side, this is a really good bourbon barrel aged beer. However, this is more like a barrel aged scotch ale or barleywine (ala Backwoods Bastard, Insanity, Angel’s Share, etc), than an Imperial Stout. Maybe somewhere between the two styles. Great for a bourbon fix, though!"
""
""
"O. Smooth and rich. I had a vintage 2011 so it was in my basement for over a year. I'll be interested to see how different it is if its fresher. Overall very solid and worth a try."
""
""
""
"O - Good beer, price and limited availablity may make it overhyped. However, it is a very interesting beer and worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This one had some hype from a few well versed friends. Sadly, this one disappoints."
""
"O - A nicely drinkable stout/barley-wine-ish beer. The oak doesn't kill the beer for me like it does with some other oaked ales. I'd like to have this with a New York Strip."
""
""

"O-	One of the best barrel aged brews I have had. Very well balanced. It’s a delicious big beer that deserves to be enjoyed. An excellent offering!"
""
""
""

"A very good beer overall, I liked the dynamic here; there was no hiding the intent, it was a boozy stout and it came out swinging. The BA notes state this is a stout aged on Heaven Hill Bourbon barrels, and while I am not familiar with Heaven Hill Bourbon, I now feel like I know that product and may enjoy it. Definitely worth trying this brew."
"This is all brought together in pseudo harmony with many layers of toasted, creamy, alcoholic notes. It has a thick mouth feel and tons of flavor you would expect from a 10%-er. Definitely a sipper. One will do. Could get gross after a while but I really enjoy this 25oz-er."

"Overall - This is a good stout, but comes through with a lot of heat. I imagine this being a beer hard alcohol drinkers might like; I myself find it a bit too aggressive and transparent. Decent complexity that's overwhelmed by the near numbing heat. That said, there's just enough redeeming stout character that I'd drink it again."
""
"Overall: My friend has been on me to try this one and I finally got it into a glass. I have to say I am extremely impressed by this beer. An absolute steal at $8 a bomber and so easy off the shelf that it makes me smile. I will be picking this up more often for sure!"
""
"Overall- Its my birthday today and a friend of mine picked this up for me at 8 Degree Plato Beer company Ferndale, Michigan. This is actually the first oak aged Stout i've had and I really enjoyed it. If your the kind of person that enjoys craft beer and enjoys bourbon/whiskey on the rocks this beer will turn you into a raging alchoholic if your already not there. CHEERS."
""
"O - This beer ran me $17.50 for a 4 pack so the expectations were pretty high. Mostly, I felt that the beer delivered. It had the sweetness of a Wee Heavy that countered the bitter roast taste most common to a stout. The fact that it drew this sweetness from vanilla was interesting that the oak flavor lent itself nicely to the style. Given it's price it won't be one that I'd grab every time, but I'd say it's memorable enough for a repeat."
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"To be fair, this was quite aggressive but the alcohol didn't detract from this beer. It merely served as a reminder that this was indeed a Stout, just slightly different in nature from the norm. Fans of that style, Scotch Ales, non-spicy Winter Warmers, and after dinner cordials on the strong side owe it to themselves to this give this a go - there's a lot to like here."
"O - 4.25 - Very good and very enjoyable. This one's a solid keeper. It's just interesting enough to make you want to keep buying it but drinkable enough that it doesn't have to be a special occasion. I really enjoy the notes that the wood adds and really like the nice gentle warm throat burn here in a cold house. This is a sit back and get cozy beer for later at night when things are quiet. If it would just snow in Florida and if I had a fireplace and a leather recliner and a blanket, things would be perfect - you know how it gets so quiet at night when snow thickly blankets everything and nobody's out. That's when I'd drink this."
""
""
""
"Carbonation was low, mouth feel medium, left a sticky residue on the lips. Warming alcohol in the back of the throat."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: All the pieces are there but they don't quite come together like I'd hoped. The ABV isn't hidden as well as in others I've had. Not bad by any stretch. Great way to warm up on a cold day."
""
""
"This was nicely done. Unique and balanced, a little boozy but if you like that it works."
""

"O: A nicely balanced oak aged stout with some alcohol warmth."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, glad to have finally tried. A solid dark oaked bourbon beer. Needs a little fine tuning though."
""
""
"This is a great beer but might get dinged a little in style points. Otherwise a top notch beer in my opinion and I might be keeping this stocked in my fridge until can get more BW Bastard and damn Wulver is too expensive!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Again, very impressive, smooth barrel aged beer. I highly recommend this one. Cheers!"
""
"O: This is an enjoyable beer due to the bourbon barrel aging adding to the nice stout flavors and aromas but needs to be sipped slowly as this is a pretty big beer (and the alcohol is not too well hidden in it)."
"O/D-A pretty tasty brew. A cool take on the barrel-aged brew. Not a sludgy, viscous and overly barrel dependent beer. It is lighter, more lactic and the barrel presents itself in a different manner. I truly enjoyed this but I didn't really love it."
""

"2010 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Duck-Rabbit nonic. Poured a massively dark brown (almost black) with a minimal light tan head. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, vanilla, and dark fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, caramel, vanilla, dark fruit, and subtle sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I thought with some age on this one that the alcohol aspect would be completely gone. On the flavor that was definitely the case. However on the flavor there was still a nice little kiss of booziness to be found that was rather surprising at first. Once your palate adjusted to this though it was really quite nice to have a touch of heat to this one. It was fairly well balanced with just a hint of roastiness but more sweetness with the vanilla and caramel going on. A really well done brew that I would suggest anyone to try at least once."
""
""
""
""
"O: a very good brew, but expected some more complexity. Perhaps the bourbon should come through more, but what it lacks in bourbon is made up in balance of malt, dark chocolate and booze. Pick some up."
"Poured from a bomber into a glass. Good head, does not disappate, good lacing down the glass. Smells of chocolate and bourbon with hints of oak. The bourbon hits in the beginning with a chocolate and oak finish that hits dry on the back off the tongue. The beer is creamy yet carbonated and has a great feel. Overall, a good beer that is worth buying again, but still leaves me wanting more."
""
""
""
"O- I like this... its different... boozey as all hell... sweet and woody... if your into strong Bourbon or Scotch than this is the brew for you...."
""
""
"overall: a nice brew but at $15.99 a 4 pack, somewhat a disappointment. Gets better and more complex as it comes to room temp."
"O: enjoyed this much more in 2013 - lotsa of oak and bourbon, the chocolate character was sweeter and denser, while retaining a distinct milkiness."
""
"Overall awesome brew. Would definitely buy more of this as I find it."
"This was a fantastically delicious beer. It's a HUGE beer though. The ABV on this sucker will really sneak up and hit you."
"Edit: 5/11/2013 Revisited this beer again and it was a little better than I remember. Still not something I would go out of my way for, but if it's around I'll keep trying it."
"Overall while not being a huge fan of barrel aged stouts i have to say this was pretty impressive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It would be really good if it wasn't so sweet. Just too much extra sugar. Nice barrel and roast, though."
""
""
"-Overall 4.5: Just a fantastic beer that takes everything you may have heard about Innis & Gunn and multiplies it by at least five. This is a beer for fans of big ABV beers, but also a beer for fans of BEER. This brew is fantastic and worth every penny you will spend tracking it down. Worried about paying $5 shipping to get a big bottle of this? Dont. Just order it and order it now. Paradise awaits. WARNING: the ABV in this baby will creep up on you and knock you off your perch. I'm just saying."
""
"O: There is not nearly enough roast or chocolate in this beer to be world class. There are no major defects to the beer and the bourbon adds complexity, but I want less sweetness and more robustness in my RISs."
"Overall this is a very solid barrel aged beer. I'd like to see it a bit more opaque and maybe a bit more head. The smell and flavors are quite good. It may not be the most interesting but for the price at $8 a bomber it's hard to beat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very interesting beer. It is heavy on the booze taste/smell/feel, but a lot of other flavors come out which are often missing in high ABV beers. It is expensive but if I found it again I would probably buy it."
""
"Taste/feel: Interesting. Very interesting. It has a lot of chocolate and coffee like you'd expect in a stout, but there's some smoke in there. Another surprise was the feel and carbonation. The feel is rather light, and the carbonation is medium/high. The alcohol is easily detected in this one as well. Stouts and porters and the like aren't my favorite styles, but I don't hate this one."
""
"O - Overall, I was excited to try this beer after hearing so many good things about it. Sadly it did not live up to what I had expected. Typically New Holland always impresses me but I did no like this beer as much as I had hoped. I wouldn't pay $3.99 for another 12 oz. Bottle"
""
""
""
""
"I enjoyed two pours of this over the course of the evening. With each mouthful this beer grew on me more and more. Definitely worth seeking out and keeping a few bottles in storage."
""
""
""
"Even better on cask. :)"
"On tap at Trappeze. Poured into a chalice. Frothy, beige head, soapy lacing. Black body. Aroma is mild coffee, vanilla, coconut, mild malt sweetness, slight booze. Pretty nice amalgam of flavors, complex. Very easy drinking for the high abv, very. Flavors really start popping upon warming. Excellent."
""
"Drinkability: Pretty good imperial stout, the taste needs a little more. Maybe a little age will lessen the alcohol burn."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is how a barley wine should taste. (I don’t know what style New Holland Brewing was trying to make with this beer, but to me it seems like a barley wine – and, a darn good one at that.) The focus is on the roasted malt flavors – chocolate sweetness, dark chocolate, and dried fruits. And, the oak helps balance the malt and adds some complexity to the flavor profile. There is also some booziness that works well here – it does not get into alcohol heat, but remains at just a touch to add balance and complexity. This is definitely a must try for barley wine fans."
""
"Overall: Thankfully, the taste delivered what the nose was just embarrassingly fumbling around with. Almost hazardously drinkable. I'll be honest, it has been several years since I'd last had this -- nice to see it finally in Georgia."
""
"O - This was a 12 oz serving, which is a good size of a big beer like this. A 22 would be fine to share, but I think it would be ""too much of a good thing"" and too filling for me. This is a great beer for a cool fall day."
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown/black color with a thin light brown head. Fantastic roasted scent that is heavy with roasted malts, oak, and vanilla. Texture is smooth and creamy. A great overall taste as bold roasted flavor hint your taste buds teasing with vanilla, coffee, and toffee hints. So complex and so delicious. To me this is like a more readily available version of Goose Island Bourbon County Stout. A great brew on a cold night."
""
"Definitely a beer I look forward to trying again."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is silky smooth- full bodied, very light carbonation. This is a good one. Not too much complexity but great taste and feel. I would get it again."
""
"O - I could smell this beer all day and for that I am a fan. As far as the taste goes I felt it lacked a little bit of complexity and the alcohol was super noticeable."

"pretty decent for an easy off the shelf whiskey BA aged stout."
"Overall this is a pretty smackable beer, lighter than what i expected. The heat from the booze had subsided to make it just right."
""
""
""
"overall a tasty beer, reminds me a little of dogfish head's palo santo marron. not world class territory here but one i would be happy to have again."

""
"Good beer, but not overly complex and docked a point for not having any noticeable bourbon presence."
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown in color with plenty of light shining through at the edges. Little to no head but a few bubbles here and there. Dark fruits, grain and sour candy to the nose. Malty, fruity and vinous makes for a unique flavor profile. The vanilla and oak is there for sure. Medium bodied and dry. Taste the alcohol my friends. Let's just say this brew does not have all the expected qualities, but it works on enough levels to keep one interested throughout a bomber session."

"Overall this is a really good barrel aged stout. The aroma is superb and the taste closely follows suit. The mouthfeel could have been a little more full bodied, but the lighter body does make it seem more drinkable. Regardless, this is a great bbal stout. Thank you so much to tut2528 for this as AN EXTRA(!) in our recent trade! You're awesome Ryan."

"After skipping out on work early, a co-worker and I decided to swing in to the NHB world headquarters (Holland, MI) and have a brew. Having never tried the Dragon's Milk, I decided it was time...and I'm glad I did. At 10% ABV, I expected the alcohol to be over-powering and make the beer tingy. Not the case at all! It was very smooth for a stout and the oak aging came out in full vibrance. The only way I would have guessed that it was 10% was the fact that I could feel a slight buzz from 1 beer. I would highly recommend that you don't miss this one if you are doing a West Michigan craft beer tour!"

"O: This was on of the more unique stouts I have tried in a while, and I quite enjoyed it.  I don't think it's something that would make my regular rotation, but I'd definitely recommend trying it."
"Overall- Interesting and complex. Good for sipping but almost a little too much alcohol flavor for me. Reminds more of an imperial stout than an American stout."

"Musical pairing: High on Fire's ""Rumors of War."""

"Very dark brown, nearly black as it fills the glass. Short khaki colored head with nice lacing. Milk chocolate and roasted coffee with a huge molasses and wet oak kick in the rich, textured aroma. Enormous boozy punch with caramelized brown sugar and tons of rich roasted malts; very barley-wine-like. Bittersweet milk chocolate, espresso bean, and oak are all solid components of the body. Boozy, tangy mouthfeel. Overall a really great brew, just a little shocking to the palate."
""
""
""
"Overall, a drinkable barrel aged beer, but very boozy and hot--even after being cellared almost a year. Definitely a sipper as too much of this will make for a bad following day."
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly pitch black color with a small 1 finger tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some light spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big oak, vanilla, toast, earth, roasted malt, licorice, molasses, dark fruit, and light bourbon. Very pleasant and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, oak, vanilla, toffee, molasses, toast, dark fruit, and light bourbon. Minimal bitterness; with lingering notes of vanilla, molasses, caramel, toffee, oak, roasted malt, dark fruit, and light bourbon on the finish for a good bit. Nice flavor complexity and balance; with no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel this is quite nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed on the finish. Definitely a moderate sipper at 10%. Overall this is a really excellent oak aged beer! Very nice complexity and flavor balance; and quite smooth for the alcohol level. I know for a fact that older bottles of this turn out fantastic as well. Really enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
"O: This was one of my first big beers back when I started understanding beer. In all honesty I hated it, now I thoroughly enjoy this beer. I find this one very well balanced all the way around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: This is a mediocre bourbon-treated stout, able to boast an appealing mid-range smell but unable to follow up with its other qualities. The flavor is beguiling for a couple or three beats until acidity surges and the playbook goes out the window. Textures struggle similarly, but without much in the way of an upside to offer counterpoint. Sometimes in artisanal beer you don't get what you paid for; and sometimes, as in the case of this relatively low-priced beer, you do."
""
""
""
"D/O: Try as I might, I just can't get into these barrel aged beers. It's not my thing. This is a big beer. A lot of flavor. A lot going on. It's just not that drinkable for me. It's too sweat and too boozy. It's unbalanced and wore on me as I worked through the glass."
""
"I've had this on tap a number of times at Jacs (Madison). And while my wife loves it, I've always felt overwhelmed by its bourbon-barrel booziness. But somehow now that I'm having it from a 12 oz. bottle, I find it enchanting. Seems counter-intuitive that the alcohol would be better hidden coming from a bottle than from a tap. But the vanilla roundness and lactose sweetness play front and center, and I now love it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a good beer trapped within a single flaw; a nice drink, nonetheless. I’d like to taste this beer without the barrel aging, actually, just to get a feel for how this beer tastes without the booze."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It wasn't fair to drink this right after Dark Lord but it held up pretty well. It has many of my favorite barrel aged attributes without overpowering the beer. It may not be on my short list of favorites but I'll happily drink more should it come my way again. "
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Great beer. The alcohol is a bit too present. Nice barrel flavors and wonderful all-around production."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark, almost black that's nearly impenetrable to light. Some red glints arounds the edges when viewed in sunlight. The impressive root beer colored head retains as well as any beer I've seen (I've seen two or three--and have drunk a few more than I could actually see). There is literally no discernible aroma. Hints of bourbon if you tip the glass a certain way and hold your mouth right. Nothing, I mean nothing that can prepare you for how this beer tastes. Lovely bourbon with a relevant alcohol warmth followed by coconut, all delivered by a viscous, creamy mouthfeel. Very well done, New Holland!"

"overall not a bad beer by any means, one ive been wanting to try but never got to until today. But no reason to get this again."
""
""
"I'll give this beer credit for nicely counterbalancing sweet and roasty elements, but at this point I'm looking for more barrel out of my BA beers and more complexity out of this style in general."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I didn't know what to expect with this coming into it. I knew it was classified as an American Stout which generally to me feel a little on the thin side. This had a great feel, the bourbon added but didn't distract. Overall pleasant surprise!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark cola brown with foamy off-white head. Nose is roast, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, and oaky excellence. Flavor is decadent: chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, roast, lingering dark sweetness- borderline dark fruit with lingering vanilla. Thoroughly enjoyable medium-bodied stout."
""
""
""
"O- nice BA stout. Slightly high carbonation that takes away from the mouthfeel some, but has a nice aroma and flavor."
" This was horrid swill and much too strong, bitter, sour and malty for my palate."
""
""
"O - glad I got to try it and I am enjoying it very much, but it's not in my top BA stouts. Certainly very good and well executed but I prefer something with a bit more body. Still a solid beer and I appreciate the 12 ounce size."
""
""
""
"This is a decent stout. The oak is more noticeable in the nose than in the flavor. It has a solid flavor overall. It's a bit boozy which takes away from the flavor and overall experience. Since the alcohol is so noticeable it also becomes a slow sipper. I wouldn't seek this out again, but I certainly wouldn't turn it down if I was offered."
""
""
"Rich and creamy mouthfeel with flavors that compliment the feeling, Not sure what this beer truly is stylistically but it has the grace of an american stout with the depth of a Russian Imperial Stout. I'm really impressed by this brew."
""
""
""
""
"From a 22 oz bomber poured into my duvel tulip. Served at 55 degrees F. Pours a dark dark brown with a finger length beige head that shrinks to near nothingness. Aroma is toasted dark malt, bourbon, vanilla, and coffee. Flavor is as complex as the aroma. Vanilla, chocolate, mild bourbon, oak wood, cream, and roasted barley. Mouthfeel is medium and quite sticky. Pretty good beer."
"I am not certain that this is really a stout, and I actually could almost taste some Belgian-style yeasts. (To my palate, it was more like a quad.) I tremendously enjoy this beer, and I highly recommend it!"
"Overall, this is probably a bit too sweet and the bourbon doesn't really integrate all that well. Also I'm not convinced this is a stout, more like an imperial brown or old ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm really liking this. Big oak notes, complimenting the milk stout base well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip. Dark brown, not quite black, mostly opaque beer, with a beige head that fades to a ring pretty quickly. The nose is oak, some spiciness, and vanilla, all of which are present in the flavor as well. There's also a slight metallic note in the flavor, maybe some oxidation, that is a little distracting, and the alcohol is clearly evident though not hot. The beer finishes with a caramel sweetness that leaves it just shy of cloying, with a hint of cocoa at the very end. Somehow the beer never seems to come completely together; certainly a decent brew, but by no means outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"of note: when paired w/ dessert this revealed a hop presence that actually served to cleanse the palate very nicely. very surprising level of complexity in something that otherwise seems so one-dimensional (yet delicious)"
"A really good barrel aged brew that rides the path of a stout, a big beer that you'll need to sip. Very well balanced, had fun drinking this one."
"Pours an opaque black with a 1/2 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt, vanilla, wood, bourbon, and a slight whiff of Play-Doh. Taste is of dark roasted malt, vanilla, wood, bourbon, and extremely sweet raw/natural sugar. There is a mild roasty bitterness that quickly fades from the palate after each sip. This beer has a higher level of carbonation for a stout with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good barrel aged stout but it is extremely sweet and cloying."
""
""
""
""
"The mouth is smooth and silky. This is a good beer, but the wood notes just seem to throw it a little out of whack."
"O: this is a beer that takes a few sips to get used to. Once it warms up a bit it's flavors really come out. I really enjoyed this beer. Let the beer warm up a bit after pouring it...then enjoy!"
"D: Big and potent – more a strong darkish ale than any sort of stout. Too much barrel & not enough stout. Way too much booze. And especially given the richness it should have as a stout. High octane, but not in a good way. Almost not possible to finish. A very slow sip and cringe. Only manages a 3.0 on the firm and reasonably nice oak/vanilla character throughout."
""
""
"Seeing how I like thick beer in the right style and flavor, this one will routinely stock my shelf whenever I do my beer runs."
""
""
""
"It is still Way better than Boak's monster mash. That is my number one worst Impy experience. Still looking forward to Night Tripper. If that is so good, why is New Holland still marketing this?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really need to revisit this one, as the few times I had it I don't think I was ready for BA stouts. One of the most unique beers I have had. Pours black with heavy bourbon and vanilla notes. Tastes like those root beer barrell candies, vanilla and bourbon on the finish. Very warm alcohol. A bit sweet for my tastes, and mouthfeel is rather thin for a stout, especially one with that Imperial name in it. Would like to try and rerate this later. Strange, but extra points for its uniqueness."
"O: Great flavor, easy on the palate, but just a bit too watery. This got better after every sip. A few more bubbles would do it wonders. Cheers!"
"From the initial smell you would believe it to be very pungent with its bourbon taste, almost to an overwhelming state, but it really isn’t. Other than a slight (very slight) dip in aftertaste, this is a terrific bourbon barrel stout."
""
""
""
"Pours an odd looking murky brown sludge with a fizzy tan head. No clarity. On the nose there is tons of chocolate and aggressive burnt wood. This is a real one directional aroma. The taste tells the same story: too much wood that somehow brings some chocolate to the table. The more delicate notes of the base beer are completely overwhelmed by the oak. Low drinkability. One of the worst fiscal decisions I’ve made lately..."
""
"Overall: This beer is Bourbon County Stouts little brother. Now that BCBS is so hard to get I will be drinking a lot more of this beer because its easier to get and quite comparable. New Holland does a great job with this barrel aged beer."

"Overall: I tried this beer on a couple different occasions and I have to say it's not something you can drink everyday, or drink several in one day. A 12 ounce bottle is all you need to get a taste and be satisfied. That is not say this beer isn't good, because this beer is better than good. The price is justified and this one is worth a try if you ever feel adventurous."

"This one was ok but a little too one dimensional for my tastes... The oak was overpowering and didn't do this beer any favors..."

"O- Good complex beer, but leaves me wanting a little more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer would be absolutely fantastic if there were a lower ABV version. The booze takes center stage here and is too much at times. If the underlying flavors didn't have to compete in this one, I would rate it much higher."
"O - A good rich warming brew. Dark fruits and bourbon oakyness dominate."

"Paired with a cigar while reading, this one sips well. Other examples of the style are bolder, but this is a better match in the everyday line-up."

"Pours out a dark brown hue with a thin tan head that leaves some retention and minimal lacing. Appearance was not as good as I thought it would be. The aroma has some oak, vanilla, dark fruits that really stand out and lets you know this is a beer worth drinking. The taste starts out with some dark fruits, followed by some vanilla and chocolate and has an oak like taste through out. This beer is very creamy and very smooth, I hardly noticed any alcohol in the taste even though it has 10% ABV. A great tasting beer that is very well made that any stout lover must try, I just wish this beer was a little bit cheaper to buy."

"Really nice. A nice barrel aged beer with nice flavor. A little strong on the alcohol taste, wish it had a little more oak flavor (maybe a little longer in the barrel would do!) Nice dark black color, brown head, deep chocolate smell and nice silky mouthfeel. Overall, a really nice drinkable barrel-aged stout!!"
"Overall it reminded me of a better Guinness. Smoother, tastier, and brought a little more all around, however, it wasn't as smooth as I was expecting."
""
""
"O - Overall, it wasn't bad, but didn't live up to my lofty expectations. It didn't blow me away. I think that I would go back to this one because I don't have trouble getting it, which is rare for a barrel aged stout, but would not prefer it to some of the other barrel aged I have had."
""
""
"O: Wow - this one is quite nice on tap. Very happy to have tried it on growler."
"O - a very potent brew, high ABV with a strong alcohol taste. I was disappointed by this one, and I am a fan of stouts. I sampled it next to Guinness and Left Handed Milk Stout, and preferred both of those. I think if this beer were 2-3% lower ABV, it would compare much more favorably, because it did have a good initial flavor."
""
"O: Good stout, above average, but doesn't get to founder's levels in my opinion"
"O: A solid oak barrel stout. Pretty easy drinking with a solid flavor profile."
""
""
"Overall, a very good barrel aged beer. Definitely worth a try.. or three..."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The tastes are way too subtle for a barrel aged Imperial Stout, almost watery. Kind of tastes like watered down whiskey with some burnt sugars added. This beer comes off very weak. Meh..."

"Not a bad beer, but not much going on. I feel that the alcohol taste overpowers everything else."
""
""
"Worth trying but not something I need to keep around or seek out. Alcohol dominates and gets to your head quickly. Can only drink one, if you choose to drink it."
"Dark brown in appearance - almost black. There is a thin head to this offering and no retention. Caramel dominates the nose. The taste is driven by the chocolate malt smoothness. Pleasant vanilla and whiskey notes are present, but certainly not overdone."

"Goes to show that ya gotta try everything twice!"

"D- Overall, definitely an enjoyable beer. I like the balanced use of oak. The base beer really shines through with lots of rich chocolatey goodness."
""
"Pours kind of thin looking for a ""high gravity"" ba stout, black with a cap of sand colored head which quickly recedes to a ring. Good retention and no lacing. Smell is a somewhat one-dimensional creamy vanilla, with some alcohol, oak, and chocolate malt as well. Taste is kind of harsh oak, vanilla, and milk chocolate. Light body and medium-light carbonation. Kind of flabby, and could use some more heft. Overall, this is pretty mediocre. I would pass in the future."

"This pours a black-ruby complexion with a thin lacing of foam on top. It has an aroma of toffee and espresso, with a bit of smoke. It’s tasty, with some smoked malt, lots of dark chocolate and dark roast coffee, sweet bourbon notes and a long, smoothly boozy finish."
"Side note: After pairing the second half of the bottle with a piece of chocolate cake, this really took on more life. This is a pairing beer if anything."
""
""
"Poured this from a bomber into a pint glass. It was black with very little head but lots of lacing. It poured fairly thick. You could definitely smell oak and vanilla with roasted malts. It was very thick and surprisingly sweet from what I remember from the last time I had it. The malt taste was also overpowered by vanilla. I have to say it was too much. I've read other reviews saying the alcohol was too much, but I didn't think it was too boozy. I had this out with friends before, but this time I drank it at home. I was less impressed with it this time, so it'll be some time before I have it again."

"Overall - I've had other oak barrel aged beers in the past where the oak and bourbon flavors were overly aggressive, this beer is not that way at all, there is a nice balance here. Flavors are also complex and enjoyable. Definitely a nice night cap on a cool night."
""
"O: Overall I'd say this is definitely a good beer. I felt that it was perfectly smooth, but it lacked a more ""robust"" flavor that I get from other American Stouts. It is a very good beer, and I would absolutely buy it again. This is more of a beer for the classic stout or porter lover, and not the fan of huge barleywines or strong bitter stouts. It tastes like a session beer, but certainly doesn't kick like one."

"Wholeheartedly recommended."

"overall - Deceptively drinkable for the 10% ABV. The booze is hidden really well. Quite enjoyable, but Be careful with this one!"
""
"was pumped for this one! poured a hershey's syrup color (and texture) with just a tiny head fading away instantly. smells like an imperial milk stout, sugary and really strong. flavor is woody, the oak aging is prominent in the beer, mellows everything out and helps account for the lack of carbonation. there is also a graham crackey breadyness to this beer, giving it a nice full body. complex and delicious this beer does not hide its strength at all, which is fine in this style. my first new holland brew but will be keen to find some others as this was a great sunday afternoon treat"

"O: I would get a lot more of this if it were available locally. Thanks Scoot69"
"Overall a brew I suggest everyone should try at least once. It's big, bold and fruity with a very smooth, drinkable alcohol presence and had just a touch of a woody tinge at the end."

"O - New Holland's crowning jewel, Dragon's Milk, is rich and flavorful but not boozy nor potent to the point of being cloying. A perfect balancing act of malt sweetness, bitterness, and smooth alcohol, Dragon's Milk is great fresh and even more complex and deep with extended age. I recommend buying multiple bottles of each vintage to visit this real treat over time!"
""
""

"WAY too damn oaky. The oak character dominates the palate, and anything that might have once resembled a stout is now reminiscent of sucking on a woodchip. It's too aggressively oaked, which to my palate makes it almost unpleasant to drink."
"O- If you fancy yourself a bourbon drinker and you prefer vanilla over chocolate when it comes to ice cream and you also happen to love craft beer, it is a must. It's definitely a sipper. I could see a dragon enjoying this after a long day of burning villages and evading arrows."

"2011 Vintage. Pours black that appears dark red when held up to the light. Very tiny tan head that disappears very quickly. Scent is initially very heavy on the dark fruit side. Very sweet dark fruits. A hint of chocolate and tobacco as well. Smells extremely sweet. Taste is initially sweet dark fruits with just a bit of delicious bourbon flavor. Nice chocolatey notes with vanilla and molasses. Very very sweet. Mouthfeel is a little more than than I would have liked. Drinkability is fair. Alcohol is well hidden. Overall, this beer is delicious, but it's just delicious in small amounts. I will definitely be able to finish this 12oz bottle, but couldn't drink more. A little too sweet. Also, I think this one would be more accurate at being classified as a barrel-aged quad. The dark fruits are much more overpowering than chocolate or coffee."
""
""
"O: not a bad beer. Better on tap I bet."

""

"Dragon's Milk Stout pours a black color, with very little head. There is a very warm heavy alcohol smell, with a little bit of coffee, and chocolate aromas. The taste is very heavy on coffee, and the alcohol hits you, and almost burns. Drinking this is almost like tacking a shot of alcohol, I don't know how many of these I could drink. Overall this is a pretty interesting beer, I think it would be great, if the alcohol was tuned down."

"Overall: Tastee, but initially too sweet for me, although that fades away nicely into a clean finish. The oak barrel age was not as noticeable as i would have liked. The 10% is very well hidden - I would have guessed more like 7%. Combine that with the clean finish and it makes this a very strong drinkbale beer."

"Pours a dark brown. Opaque in the glass. Very light tan rocky head. Dense and persitant. Light smell of roasted malt. A little oaky. Taste is roasted malt throughout. Sweetness in the beginning. Oaky. Roasted malt bitterness in the finish. Pleasant lingering flavor. Boozy and warming. Pretty nicely balanced actually. Medium to full bodied and moderately carbonated. This is a solid beer overall. Very strong. But also nicely rounded. Deceptively drinkable. And very good overall."

"3.0 D: There's too many great barrel aged stouts to consider this one again."
"I guess this could classify best as a ""dessert beer", served in small quantities when you want overly-sweet, imbalanced beer, but otherwise, I'd avoid it."
"Cost: $15.99 for a four pack, $8.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle."
"O- Haven't had this for years and really enjoyed it. There didn't seem to be as much oak presence as I remember. Definitely one of my favorite offerings from New Holland."
"O - There's a reason I go back to this beer. Being fond of stouts and most rauchbiers, it's nice to have something with that smoky flavor that has the subtleties that this beer does. I would recommend it to anybody that enjoys stouts or smoked flavors."
"Each sip offers something new. Even if you don't appreciate this style, this beer is worth sampling. Cheers!"
"Unfortunately the worst part of this beer is its taste. Everything else is spot on for me. There is just too much bourbon and not enough complexity."
"Nice Beer! Much better than I expected. It pours a dark, reddish-brown that's nearly black. The head is a medium-tan, although it falls somewhat quickly. The aroma is what makes this beer so enticing. It's woody, smokey, and has a huge, intense vanilla note. Wow. Strong malt, and a roasted-nut scent behind the wood, this is complex and very rewarding to sniff. Alcohol is folded into the aroma as well, with a brandy-like boozy-ness. The taste is drier than expected with a lot of warmth and malt. Roasted notes, and a bit of grain. Medium in body. This is good stuff."
"Medium-full bodied with light carbonation. Very smooth and it does NOT seem like a 10%ABV brew! I would definitely drink this again."
"O: Dangerously smooth for 10% ABV. I'm a sucker for anything oak aged, or anything vanilla. Pair the two together and I'm in beer heaven."
"O: An enjoyable brew, almost exactly what I thought it'd be. For my palette, the oak and booze aren't overwhelming, but I can see where that might be an 'acquired' taste...plus the barrel aging seems to cover up a lot of the other nice parts of the beer. Maybe a year in the cellar would mellow this beer and cause it to gel."
"I think a proper discription of the style would help in the reviews because baby this isn't a stoudt."
"D: This feels like an over the top stout, comes across as an over-attenuated milk stout (that sounds much worse than intended). Hints of alcohol, not enough to be warming. Good not great. I would buy again at the right price."
"Overall great daily beer with big flavors and very nice surprises."
"O: A big, punchy-sweet imperial milk stout. Decent, but I prefer other imperial stouts. Not recommended, but it's not unfortunate. You might buy one just to keep the bottle/label."
"Just be careful, because this got me hooked on whiskey."
"O- a sweet and tasty stout with vanilla and chocolate wraped up in a stout"
"O: Great hints of barrel, but lacking in some area. Great aroma. Drinks a little hot. I wonder how this will be drinking in a year or two."
"Goes down pretty easy but I feel I must take it slow given the ABV. Good job with the alcohol taste though, I definitely pick it up, but it's not a real big kick. Pretty well balanced overall actually."
"O: A really rich and complex American stout, but not the best blend of sweet and oak-aged booziness I was hoping for. At 10% ABV its still a little too harsh for immediate consumption, but further aging might bring the flavors together a little bit more nicely."
"O - I might be putting on the home-state rose colored glasses here, but I find this beer to be outstanding. I had this in a bottle in the middle of a wreckless 25 beer tasting and it still rose to the top of the list, even with a tired palate. I highly recommend trying it at least once to see if its up your alley."
" Overall quite good but not exceptional. Except for the times when it's exactly what you want."
"O - Wish I would have aged this 2011 bottle instead of cracking it open tonight. Something like this would be amazing if it were aged in a bourbon or red wine barrel. The alcohol presence is a little too strong."
"The taste is mostly alcohol and oak. I wish I had let it age but it was the only bottle I bought on a trip across the country. Its a an ok taste but I would let it sit to dissipate the alcohol and try again."
"Heard a lot about this beer so I thought I would give it a go. Overall this beer has a great good oaky aroma. I poured into a goblet to enjoy. A dark pour with nice lacing. First sip was very warm. A nice flavor but the alcohol is the overwhelming characteristic. If you do not mind a truly warming beer this might be for you. I would drink it again but only on a cold night."
"Overall- I thought about buying a 6 pack of this a the store, but I dont think I'll get it again. If I were I would age it at least 6-8 months it would be better but I feel like it is too young. If you like whiskey and you like beer, try it. My recommendations to the brewers: finish dryer and use a better wood."
"O: Overall, I would definitely recommend this to friends. If you take the time to let it warm to the proper temperature and taste it a little bit along the way, you will get to experience many different notes in just one glass."
"o: Not terrible, but I definitely won't buy anymore. There are better BA stouts out there that aren't hard to find."
"O-"
"O: A bit to much bourbon for me. The smell had me excited. But the bourbon and alcohol smash everything that was awesome in the nose. Still a decent stout."
"The beer is a good dark color. Brown. Unfortunately, there's not much of a head or carbonation. I can't quite make out what I smell, it's too faint for my messed up nose. I liked the initial taste, chocolate and a hint of something else. I was reminded of bourbon. I get an alcohol like aftertaste which I didn't like much. The mouth feel is nice and creamy."
"Overall it is a nice flavored stout, needs a little more thickness would make this a top notch stout."
"Tonight I'm having a bottle of this that has been in basement storage for over 2 years. The beer has held up very well and my impressions are pretty much the same as when the original review was done. I think the flavors may have softened a bit over the last couple of years but it is still smooth and tasty with no obvious signs of oxidation. The Bourbon flavors may have come forward a bit more but the whole is still very nice."
"Overall a pretty good heavy stout. Hard to categorize as it seems to defy some categories. Good to try and appreciate"
"Overall, a unique stout though I'm not blown away. I'd definitely suggest it be tried, but I can't see drinking a lot of it. Probably best shared on a cold night."
"Roasted malts up front. Coffeeish bitterness stays. Milk chocolate and rummy dark fruits follow and flesh out the palate. Notes of wood, vanilla, and rum throughout. Hints of soy sauce and licorice too. Warming finish, with lingering caramel-chocolate sweetness and oakiness. Medium-full body with a slightly thinner feel than expected. Not too bad."
"TheBeerAlmanac.com"
"O: too sweet, too thin, too carbonated. As barrel-aged stouts go, this one is lacking body and is out of whack with the high carbonation."
"Overall, it is good and rich, like a fried Oreo. Get one at the state fair, talk about it with your friends, but don't stock your cupboard. It is just too sweet. The wood is great, though: nuanced, mellow. That does not get old at all."
"This isn't terrible, but the flavor really did not appeal to me. The lactic quality is too strong, and this is also a bit too woody. I guess I could understand why some people would like this."
"Very odd aroma of alcohol and rich chocolate/molassas. Very low amount of carbonation, very smooth and clean taste. Taste begins as a rich chocolate coffe flavor and then followed up and palet cleansed with the rich creamy/milkiness. Over all for the price and the hype be hind this beer I was not really impressed. You can get a much more inexpensive and more consistant beer from several other companies."
"This was an ok stout, but the woody aspect of it is too much. The price point is waaaay off."
"I didn't think this was a bad beer. Given the scathing reviews some of my fellow BAs have given it, I wonder if NH hasn't modified it in some way. It's hard to find too much wrong with this beer, but I'll try. For one thing, I didn't particularly care for the cola flavor. Second, at this price I would expect a bit richer flavor. If you haven't tried it this year (2011), give it a whirl."
"Overall I have to say that this is a pretty average beer, but I still find some quality that I really like about it, but as a whole it's just average. My main beef with this beer is that it just isn't as roasty as a stout should be, if you market something as a stout it should have a good amount of roast to it, with that missing it lets all the other flavors take over and in the end that didn't make it very stout like and if I was given this blind there's a good chance I would think this is a barrel aged Barleywine or an old ale with a slight amount of roast to it. I did like how drinkable this beer is, I find that barrel aging can hurt the drinkability a lot of the time, but on this beer it really doesn't matter and the mouthfeel doesn't make it too filling plus for 10% the alcohol isn't that in your face. I can see how some people may be turned off by the heavy bourbon and oak presence in this beer, and I think that's because there isn't enough roast to balance it out, but if you sip on it, take your time, and let it warm up you will find that the flavors that the barrel imparted are really nice and not as in your face as they seem at the start. What I liked most about this beer was the mouthfeel, usually I like my stouts thick as oil, but the lighter then average body really works with this beer and find it to suit it perfectly. What I liked least about this beer is that it's called a Stout, it should have much more roast, instead of a heavy presence of dark fruits that makes it closer to a barrel aged old ale or Barleywine. I will still buy this beer on occasion, it can'r hold a candle to KBS, but anytime I want a barrel aged beer it is available, and availability can play a big part in what I buy sometimes. I recommend this to fans of barrel aged beers, but don't expect to be blown away buy the base of this beer cause it doesn't live up to the name. Even though this is pretty much the most popular beer in their lineup, there are a couple other beers from them I would rather have that are lot more to style and better tasting. This was the first barrel aged beer I ever had and at the time it was super robust and big, but after trying much other stouts I find I still like it, but not as much as I used to it and it's much more average then I first thought. As a whole New Holland is a pretty good brewery, maybe next batch you make you can set aside some of those barrels for Pilgrims dole, now that may be an epic beer, think about it."
"O-wasn't as impressed with this as I was hoping, I wanted more oak taste and not as much bourbon it just made the 10% alcohol stand out more"
"Shared bottle with a friend. Thanks John B. Surprisingly mild aroma. Dark roast, mild sweetness. Also a surprisingly light color that is see through (for a stout) with dark red hints. Coffee, nice roast, oak with a nice vanilla flavor. Moderate to slightly bigger feel with a slightly greater carbonation than I anticipated. Overall I liked the well balanced oak that offers nice blending flavors with out dominating or covering the other flavors."
"O - Would be a great beer on a cold winter day. Maybe with a hot bowl of chili."
"O: Don't buy this, its expensive here in VA and New Holland seems to be riding on the back of the reputation of the 09 vintage."
"Dragon’s Milk makes for a fine sipping brew, enjoyed like a fine scotch. I also have no doubt that this beer will age nicely. That said, I find it occasionally overpowering. The esters give you a nice menopausal hot flash on the way down, a sharp edge that usually seems rounded out to me. I almost find the flavors to be numbing - drink this after dinner, not alongside. Again, I strongly argue that this doesn't fit the same niche that a strong ale or stout would fall under for me. The body is too fruity for another style (savory as it may be) and the alcohol content is far more noticeable than stouts of similar ABV, as well as all I've said before."
"Overall this is a marvelous beer that I would drink again. To me the mouthfeel was the big hit."
"I wanted to like this beer, but that cough syrup quality puts me off every time. I think that less pronounced alcohol flavor would have helped things a lot; but that's certainly a challenge when you're producing a beer with 10% ABV. I can definitely appreciate the little things about Dragon's Milk, but the sum of the parts is certainly a letdown."
"poured into a stein"
"I must say, I enjoyed the heck out of the 2011 version more so than any other batch I've tried. Just a great beer."
"Booze and oak are a somewhat harsh 1-2 punch to the nose. Gentler aromas of vanilla, toffee, dark chocolate, tangy fruit and citrus linger. The oak flavor is also quite potent enough to be near overwhelming at times. Citrus is surprisingly bold, and there’s a ton of tangy raisin and prune. Roasted and toasted grains attempt to assert themselves, but are no match for the oak. The mix of flavors isn’t a bad one; it just seems that the ratios are way off here. Perhaps a blend of oaked and non-oaked versions would result in a smoother drinking brew. Thinnish body, but fairly smooth with a velvety coating feel. Could be pretty nice with a few tweaks."
"O - The appearance and smell of this stout are pretty nice, but the flavor profile is unbalanced. I really think some age would calm this one down by cutting the abrasiveness of the alcohol, toning down the dark fruits, and bringing forward more traditional roasted flavors of an imperial stout. This was sent to store shelves too soon."
"This one pours nearly black with just a faint garnet glow. The head is light tan and diminished to a skim and leaves just a bit of lace. The aroma is moderate-high roasted malts, some chocolate, vanilla, and oak, hints of warm alcohol, quite inviting. The flavor is a marriage of roasted malt, bittersweet caramel and dark fruit upfront. These flavors are quickly swept clean by a pleasantly strong oak flavor that lingers well after the swallow and continues to emerge as the ABV warms my palate and belly. The carbonation is medium and body full. Overall this is a well made brew with a pronounced oak flavor -- a great beer to sit, sip, and enjoy the flavors of roasted malts and oak."
"Pours black with a small whitish head. Big roast and oak on the nose. The taste is milky roastiness with a big oak punch. Maybe a hint of coffee and chocolate. The oak is a bit harsh - seems like it needs some time. The mouth is silky and creamy. Very nice. Overall, this beer has a lot of potential, but is overwhelmed with oak. Maybe some time will chill it out."
"Doesn't drink like a barrel aged stout, and that's kind of a bad thing. A good beer, but either needs a better base beer or more time in the barrel."
"Dragon's Milk pours a solid black, with a foam crown that's just a slightly lighter shade of tan than I'm used to seeing in an imperial stout. The head comes up to about three fingers in height, and has solidly above average head retention. There's a solid ring of lacing at the top of the glass, but everything below that is a bit spotty. The nose definitely shows off the oak barrel aging. A prominent dark chocolate malty note is sweetened up by some vanilla sweetness from the oak. A straight oak woody note is also present, a little bit too much so even. The flavor features those same sweetened chocolate and oak notes, but the woody aspect of the beer is even more prominent. I can close my eyes and easily picture a piece of oak just floating in my glass. The body is solid, sturdy, but not as full as I might have anticipated given the ABV, and it's paired with a nicely subdued level of carbonation. Either aging in straight oak isn't the best idea, or this one was just left in the barrel for too long, but the woody character in this beer is just off the charts."
"O: I'm curious to try this from a bottle, because from the tap I'm flabbergasted this is not a top beer and rated higher. I cannot see much downfall in this beer. It has great aroma, taste, and mouthfeel. Real balanced and enjoyable. Bravo, NH."
"Final thought - 10% abv and tastes like the stouts heaven would make. Try this if you have the chance!"
"stoked to finally give this a shot again after trying it on tap a few years ago. this one just isn't that great. it might just need more time to age... I'm not certain though... it just doesn't jive for me.... but it might be the bees knees for someone else."
"O: Great example of this style IMO. A must buy when it hits the shelf!"
"D -- Hefty and relentless, this is a beer made for kicking teeth in. Definitely worth a try, but I don't see it making it into my regular rotation."
"o - i'd drink this again. ideally on tap with a steak. it's also a good after dinner/dessert beer. I could see myself sipping on one for 3-4 hours after a big meal. becomes better as it warms."
"EDIT: The bottle I reviewed was marked Vintage 2010. I am enjoying a 2011 bottle right now (08/18/11) that is very different from the last. I can't smell any of the alcohol like the first. The taste is much more barrel. Quite a nice difference. I am only going to change the overall score from a 4 to a 4.5 on this. This is something you should ask your Midwest trading partners to add. Note: The 2010 was a 22oz. bomber and this one is a 12oz. bottle. A little easier to get as an extra. Thanks to davesway10 for this one."
"Future outlook: This beer is interesting, but just fails to deliver the IS qualities that one would expect from it (and not nearly ""robust," as the inside of the cap boasted). Not a ""bad"" beer, but not worthy of repeat business."
"Overall-Good, Not Great. The 10% alcohol is definitely dectable. Would of liked bigger and bolder coffee and chocolate. I'll still have no problem finishing the rest of this beer."
"An absolute gem!"
"Dragon’s Milk pours out dark black in color with a creamy, chocolate colored head that recedes fairly quickly. Roasted malts are obvious on the aroma and alcohol is apparent too. Vanilla and oak notes are present, but secondary to the strong alcohol notes. This stout drinks lighter than it looks and has a creamy mouthfeel. Just like with the aroma, when you take a sip, alcohol is the first thing you taste. From there, chocolate and vanilla flavors peek through a bit, but struggle to stand out. I couldn't find any oak notes that were on the aroma."
"D-Overall this was a nice stout. It was smooth and had some nice flavors going on. Some might think the roasted flavor at the end tastes alittle smokey or burnt but i liked it. Def. try this one even though it hasn't got solid reviews. I don't think its mind blowing but its got good flavor"
"O: Extremely complex! This is super rich and packed with a variety of flavors -- would recommend drinking it by itself as a dessert, or afternoon treat. It's a little boozy, but that can be mellowed with some aging. Not something I could drink more than one bottle of at a time (it's really heavy), but would be great to have every once in awhile as a late-night sipper."
"Received a bunch of bottles of this one about a year ago in a few trades, 6 or 8 12 ounce bottles and a bomber. Cracked the bomber tonight. Poured a dark brown (cola) color with a smallish light brown head. Aromas of oak, alcohol, vanilla and dark fruits (plums, cherries). On the palate, this one is medium bodied, with flavors of milk chocolate, alcohol and oak."
"DRinkability/overall- this beer is heavy and has very rich flavor and is certainly not a beer you would go at just slamming down, in terms of drinkability its probably around a four but in its overall it gets boosted up to me to a 4.5 because i just generally enjoyed the flavor and it hit me right on tap at the bar, the smell alone made me happy, maybe not absolute best stout i have ever had but pretty damn good"
"Overall, I'd pass on this again. Not my kind of beer. Way too alcoholy for my tastes"
"I LOVED this beer. One of my favorite stouts of ALL-TIME. I would certainly order this one again. Definitely a sipper and not a beer that you should just gulp down. Unfortunately, I made that mistake."
"Overall, I think this is just a little too boozy and or wood flavored. I think a year or so of aging would mellow it out."
"This beer poured out pretty dark black in color. The head came and went pretty quick, not leaving much lacing. The smell of the beer was burnt and a little acidic. The flavor of the beer had some deep roasted malts, and chocolate in there. The Oak Barrels added a slight sourness to the brew. The mouthfeel to me seemed a little flat. Overall It was decent stout, not one of my favorites though. I don't see myself running out to get more anytime soon."
"Overall: I really hope the third serving was an aberration due to me receiving something from the bottom of the tank. I was ready to crown this one of my absolute favorites until then. I'm willing to give it another go, but caveat emptor -- you might be gambling with the quality of your beer when you get this."
"o-I think this fell a little short of expectations. I had high hopes for this beer and I'm left wanting something else. I will reach for the Poet next time. At least I really enjoy that beer."
"O: It's ok, for being what it is. Not sure I would pick it up again. I can't quite get past that soy sauce taste."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style and carbonation is moderate. Overall it had some qualities I liked but the hot, boozy, woody flavor in the finish just didn't work for me. As I said, the flavors seemed to clash instead of compliment for me unfortunately. I liked some aspects of it but overall it just wasn't for me."
"I got this one in a trade and please send me another!"
"Pours cola with dissipating off-white head. Smells of cola, chocolate, prunes, raisins. Tastes of chocolate raisins, plums, booze, bourbon, slight brown sugar and residual soy sauce aftertaste. Heavy body with light carbonation. Thick, syrupy. Dragon diarrhea after a night of Eithiopian food."
"D – Pretty drinkable brew, not overly strong but enough. Couldn’t have too many of these in a sitting but enjoyable. I recommend this brew"
"O: Solid beer but has to much booze when fresh. Better with age from a bottle."
"Vintage 2010 poured from bottle into Green Flash snifter. Pours black with forced cocoa head, which dissipated quickly. Nose catches a fair amount of bourbon, but it is blanketed by coffee/cocoa notes. But i wish those were more pronounce. on the tongue, i pick up rich chocolate, which covers the tongue comfortably. not much bourbon in the taste, which i prefer, as i like sweet stouts. as it was left to warm up and calm down, a sense of the bourbon was brought forth. mouthfeel is decent. a little too bubbly for my tastes. takes away from the sweetness of the cocoa. But! overall, this is a good beer to drink on a more regular basis, when in the craving state of mind."
"O: This is decent stout overall. I did not get much out of from the oak-barrel aging but that could be due the lack of extended aging to develop more of those characteristics. For its style it's hard to find anything remarkable about it. The chocolate and vanilla that I gather from it make it sweeter than most other 9-11% barrel aged stouts I've had. I vaguely remember having this on-tap a few years back but I don't recall many of the attributes then as I was still (and still am) in the infancy of my beer tasting lifetime. I do not recall the exact price I paid for this 22 oz. but I believe it was somewhere in the range of $6.50-8.00."
"O: Tasty beer and easy to drink. This isn't a beer that I'd drive long distances for, but it's one that I'd certainly order if ran across again. Thanks Jeff."
"Cheers..."
"Wow, the first sip that is all I have to say. The bourbon is very prominent from beginning to end on this one. Good grief that is outstanding. It is sweet, hot and toasty. The finish is so good and just with a light touch of vanilla. The lasting flavor of homemade vanilla ice cream and bourbon is awesome. I absolutely loved this beer and so glad I picked this up on my road trip."
"Overall- I must have hit the clear out price day because I ended up picking this one up for $4.99 and was more than happy about it, especially considering a lot of other bombers range from $10-$20 for something that doesn’t even compare to this one. Although from the name dragons milk I was expecting a heavier stout like beer, but for a barrel aged ale it has a lot of amazing characteristics. Although heavily dominated by the bourbon taste I would definitely get this one again, even at $10 for a bomber I would probably get it again. Great beer offering from such an underrated brewer."
"Cheers!"
"O - Not quite what I expected. Its pretty smooth, drinkable. Not overpowering for a 10.0%. I have mixed feelings about it but its a good one. Lingers on the tongue but not in a bad way. At $14 for a 4 pack....doubt I will go out of my way to do this one again though"
"Compared to other -bal stouts, this is a pretty piss poor effort, mouthfeel is quite thin bodied."
"Interesting to try, but the extreme obviousness of the alcohol just ends this one for me. I enjoy beers that were crafted to employ the alchohol as a compliment to the other flavors, not just a one-sided blitzkreig on the tongue. If this WAS to be an alcohol assault from the brewer's perspective, then they did it quite well. I won't be trying this again though."
"2011 Vintage poured into a duvel tulip. Pours very dark, but not pitch black. It has a medium amount of head which recedes to a ring with a thin film of bubbles on top. Pretty nice, especially considering it is 10%. The aroma is extremely oaky, with vanilla, chocolate, and a very mild dark fruit presence. The oak does a very good job complementing the rest of the beer. It does not overpower the beer, it adds to everything else the beer has to offer. The taste is very nice as well. The oak is at a very good level, and if it was just a touch less sweet, it would be perfect. Oak, coco, vanilla, roast, but all playing very well with eachother. The mouthfeel is a bit light with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, a very pleasant surprise."
"Overall, very nice, though I might prefer New Holland's Night Tripper slightly. I'd buy this again. Good stuff and while not cheap at $7.99, still a decent value for a bomber when others charge over $10 for lesser beers."
"The first impression I always get is the hint of burnt oak, which is good, not too overpowering. Next thing I noticed was the very sweet malt/caramel, and vanilla tastes. The latter being very subtle to me. The alcohol taste is next. Though for me not too strong. To me anyway, it felt just right, smooth and not forced."
"O: Good, but not great. This was stacked up to some pretty heft stouts in the tasting, so I hope to try it again on it's own sometime."
"Overall- Huge flavor and taste but seems like a mixed drink with bourbon. I'm not sure if I could recommend this for everyone and the drinkability is very hard."
"Overall: Not a bad beer, but definitely lacking in body and depth. For the money, I know I can find other high-gravity brews which are balanced with more body and malt flavor. The aroma really lead me to believe this was going to be a great one, but I was a little let down."
"Mouthfeel was full with the oak aging helping to dry out the complex high ABV, maltiness and overall flavor profile. Overall I really enjoyed this beer, not as good as I first remember when I sampled it on draft at the original Savor, but still good non-the-less."
"Very smooth mouth feel. Goes down well. Possibly too well for a 22oz bottle of 10% beer. This is one to share! A 12 oz bottle would suit me better."
"look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | drink: 4"
"This is a super-strong stout; definitely for sipping, and sweet, not hoppy. I highly recommend trying this if these are the things you enjoy in a stout."
"Overall - the metallic taste kinda set this one back for me. It's good thought."
"O: drinkable, but not all the time. I love this beer because it is one that helped turn me on to craft brews. To be fair, though, there are better beers out there. This flavor is very sharp, and I like that it differs from other oak aged stouts in that. Could be aged more to tame it, but then it wouldn't be Dragon's Milk."
"D: Absolutely an excellent once in a blue moon beer for desert."
" I feel this is a brew that tried to be complex, but everything gets too muddled together. The higher the price tag, the higher the D Train's expectations. The Force is strong in this one, but Dragon's Milk is not a Jedi yet..."
"O: this is not a beer that i would seek out again. there are much better stouts out there. i dont think i would drink this again. it isnt quite a drain pour for me, but it is close."
"O- A good beer that borders on great, but not quite there. I did enjoy this one, and it improved remarkably the more it warmed up. Definitely worth a try if you like the style."
"O: Very interesting, unique beer. The effortlessly light body is something to behold. Will definitely revisit, but I don't think it's destined for my top 10."
"O-overall a quality beer, would revisit this again, I'm aging a few bottle so I'm curious how's this goes down with some age on it. Hopefully the boost aspect mellows a good bit."
"Just a spectacular beer. Dark as night, goes down smooth, with a beautiful bourbon-y finish. Has enough alcohol to kick like a mule, but that's all masked by the smoothness. Probably my imagination, but seems like I can taste the oak cask, and that's a good thing. Great with steak. Unconditionally recommended."
" ~ This is a the kind of stout I would go out and drink through an evening. The kind of beer that fits very well into the style category by not overwhelming in any character."
"This is the beer that got me into craft beer...so it will always hold a special place in my heart...and mouth...b/c sentimental reasons aside...it is a damn fine beer."
"O - A par big-ass american stout. It's good, but doesn't stand out from the rest. If you come across it and are in the mood for a big ass stout, this will do the job quite well."
"OVERALL: Not an epic failure per se, but nothing even close to a success either. The spicy boozy qualities just didn’t fit, making the stout taste somewhat metallic. I’m not quite sure what went wrong here. Perhaps one brewer wanted to make an imperial stout and the other wanted to make a quad, so they just made both, blended them, and threw it all into oak barrels as a band aid. Whatever happened, it didn’t quite work out all that well, and it certainly didn’t quench my thirst for a stout. Dare to be different, I guess. Glad to have finally been able to try this one, but I’ll pass on it in the future. Thanks for the fun trade boatshoes."
"O- This is an intriguing beer indeed. A lot to contemplate and necessitating a lot of time to do so. I only have a 12oz bottle, but I will sit on it for some time, especially at 10%. I say try it if you haven't had it and definitely try if you are interested in oak aged beers. I came back to this beer after a couple years because I did not enjoy my first experience, but my palate has matured so I gave it another go. All in all, I think it's too much. There is a lot here to satiate, but there is also a lot left to desire. I have little to no experience with aging beers, but I would guess this could use some."
"Overall, pretty damn good for a readily available barrel-aged ale but doesn't woo me over the top."
"Overall I enjoyed Dragon's Milk- it's not the best Oak Barrel Stout I've had but it definitely is a solid offering."
"O: I reviewed the 2011 vintage. You can hardly taste the high alcohol content over the creaminess and the smoky sweet flavors. This beer is definitely a sipper."
"o-complex but very drinkable, creamy film. This is a sipper that stands alone. Think of sips of about 1/2 oz, then wait a couple of minutes or more for another sip to appreciate this one as it develops more taste in your mouth after it is swallowed. Savory but still sweet, dangerously good, could make a session out of this one. WOW vintage 2010 with 10% ABV"
"Overall after the half fill was gone I wished I had more then the ABV hits you. Dangerously drinkable. When I think of New Holland Dragons milk will always be the beer I associate it with as the best I ever had."
"This robust beer was tasted many time but I refer to the Oak Age 2010 vintage. I like the deep complex wood notes from those bourbon casks. I detected vanilla, caramel notes. Rich but with a bit acid oily mouth-feel the became stronger as the glass warmed. Black in color, opaque in clarity, complex coffee aroma with the black malt. Dragon milk is a heavy body beer with a creamy delicate head. Malt forward and what a kick at I was told is closer to 10% ABV. Yum"
"Loved this beer. I thought it was well crafted, well balanced with out being namby-pamby about the bourbon or the oak, but still keeping them in check. I highly recommend going out and trying this beer"
"I like this brew, the bourbon is of the highst quality and goes well with the product."
"Over I like this beer fairly well. I've definitely had better but for the price, I'd buy it again."
"Overall: I will not revisit this offering or recommend it to anyone else. Nothing melded together well between the different taste elements or the smell and taste combination. Oh well, plenty of other stouts out there."
"D- This was a bit of a letdown for me. I had heard great things, but I have to put this in the ""average"" category for stouts I've had. Maybe I had it too hyped up going in?"
"The flavor was a little too alcohol-packed for my preference considering this beer is 10% ABV. I would have definitely preferred more coffee/chocolate notes to mask the alcohol."
"Drink and overall: I am a big fan of Dragons Milk. Homer maybe. Something that I can get all the time, a good sub for KBS. Not nearly as complex, but over all a very solid barrel aged beer. More enjoyable to me than Oak Aged Yeti."
"I: This is a very big, complex beer and worth every penny my brother-in-law paid for it in the 22 oz bottling. However, I expected more assertive roast flavors in a stout, and then, as an American stout, more hop assertiveness. I don't think barrel aging changed anything in this regard and, therefore, considering the relative absence of roast and coffee, couple that to the prominent dark fruit and chocolate notes, and this beer tends more toward a Baltic porter in my mind. That said, I too can ""drink fifteen Heinekens," but I've been enjoying this beer for nearly an hour. Rather than classify it, I recommend you buy it and enjoy it for what it is, a very good beer."
"Overall: This is a sipper for sure, mostly due to the intensity of the flavors. To me, its better than the reviews would suggest, but maybe I tolerate the strong oak flavor well. I won't buy it again purely because of the price vs. how good I think it is, but it was worth trying once."
"Overall - This beer is just too sweet. I dont care for the carbinated vanilla and oak. Its not undrinkible but nothing i want again. I want a stout oaked beer, not a chocolate and vanilla treat. Maybe drinking kbs and oaked arrogant bastard has ruined me..."
"D: has about the right amount of alcoholic warmth you'd want/need from a brew of this style; doesn't cut into its drinkability at all. Still quite flavorful and drinkable when warmed to room temperature. Not a favorite of mine, but a respectable offering nonetheless."
"I've had this beer on tap before at places with a ""not so great"" beer selection and it will do in a pinch but I don't think I'll go out of my way to purchase a bottle again."
"D - An interesting balance of flavor with a lot of sweetness. Too sweet to drink a lot of in my opinion but a solid tasting beer."
"Pours black. Black as the night itself. Weak head, but not a big deal for most beers like this. Fantastic flavor, mostly due to balance. Heavy on the malt but just the right amount of bitter, with a all background of sweetness. Well done for not having the alcohol burst through. In fact, I couldn't detect it at all. Obviously alot of work went into crafting this brew. Felt slightly flat in the mouth, but doesn't detract. A very drinkable beer for the scariness factor. Overall I'd recommend this to about anyone, great experience without the standard issue carbon copy hoppiness of most others of this ilk."
"Fuller body, sticky and syrupy, decent carbonation. Drinks pretty decent, although I really would have liked more barrel presence and better meshed flavor. This is one of those beers that I've passed up about 200 times before and now I kinda see why."
"D: For how big the vanilla and alcohol are, it goes down quite smooth. It opens up quite well, and the flavor progresses along the palate. Definitely not a one-note beer, with a very nice balance between the vanilla and chocolate. I would definitely have it again."
"D: let it warm up and have it on a snowy night. its a solid clean tasting brew that i would have again if it were there but would not go out of my way to hunt down...although, maybe i'm wrong, i do love the label."
"Overall I found this drink to be more interesting than anything; It's not exactly traditional, and while not reinventing beer, it certainly mixes things up a bit from what I'm used to. I think I'd buy this again if the price were right."
"Taste - earthy chocolate with initial sweet giving way to a more rounded bitter after taste. A short and less intense finish that did not linger very long."
"2008 vintage on-tap during Flying Saucer's 11th anniversary served in a tulip glass a not quite opaque black with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is a noticeable oak note in front of roasted malts. The taste is a smooth blend of roasted malts, vanilla, oak, cocoa and molasses. The beer is medium bodied and has become quite easy drinking with age!! This is a very enjoyable stout, one that certainly ages well!"
"M: I have to say, I think the burn from the ABV in the flavor plays against this beer for me. If the mouthfeel was a bit heavier, I think it could help, but this would be a 1-2 beers most. Really enjoyed it, but the burn can be a bit much."
"D: Definitely a sipping beer, here, folks."
"D- The alcohol in this brew is a little overpowering. I would say its fairly drinkable."
"Overall, its not bad. bought a pretty cheap at $7.99 a bomber. I wouldnt go out of my way to get this but would drink it again if i was craving a stout fix and options were limited."
"I poured from a bomber, 2010 vintage, into a snifter. The pour is pitch black, medium tan head, light lacing. The aroma is heavy on oak, vanilla, chocolate, and dark fruit. The flavors of roasted chocolate, oak and vanilla are prominant. It finishes with some dark fruit and hot alcohol. The body is medium and it drinks like a much smaller beer. A very enjoyable beer that I have been meaning to pick up for some time."
"D - I simply don't like this very much. I wouldn't drink more. But it's not bad to drink."
"Wow, this was something. If you like your Dragon's Milk as a big beer with pronounced and assertive flavors that you can wrap your tongue around, I recommend sticking with the bottle or tap version of this. If you're looking for this with all of those flavors melded and smoothed out into a decadent and obscenely drinkable glass of beer, then I would wholeheartedly say that you must check this out on cask. You'll be glad you did."
"This hits me in the front of the mouth first with a tingling sensation. The taste follows the nose, it is sweet and malty, but also a touch bitter in the finish, along with plenty of booze. As it warms up, the oaken flavors and smells begin to reveal themselves. This is a sipper for sure, but it's real good."
"Better warm..."
"This American Stout is fairly complex yet tastes good with a variety of foods but, also stands very well on its own. This is another great beer from a Michigan brewery!"
"Definitely a unique beer. With so many beers sticking to the standard formulas, it's refreshing to have something outside of the box."
"D-very drinkable. The smoothness really impresses me here"
"Drinkability - Slightly boozy with warming chocolates, roasted malts in the backing , finishes rather well for a higher abv% beer - I found this rather easy to drink ( sipped) and enjoyed it's warmth ."
"D: The beer is definitely one that needs to be sipped given its high alcohol content."
"D- It depends if you like bourbon or not, nice balance. It is a smooth beer, the warmer it gets the more aromas and flavors come out."
"Tasty. Could drink a few but not an all-nighter. VERY boozy. Not overly so - but make no mistake squier."
"The flavor (and milkiness+strength) illicits comparisons to a 'foreign-extra' stout. As such carries a similar flavor profile, with the oak contributing to the necessary dryness, but weaker in body and subtlety. On its own, not bad if you like your stouts sweet."
"Overall impression: phenomenal stout! can have two or three in one session."
"D - Sharp going down, but overall a very good after dinner sipper"
"This is good enough, but I'm glad I just bought the one bottle."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was very black indeed. The beer poured a non existent head and had absolutely no lacing wheresoever. The beer was overly sweet and very dry. Alcohol was just too high I thought which messes with the taste of beer. I will not buy again."
"It's worth trying for sure. The first few sips were great."
"Wow, what a beer. I came into this thing with no expectations, but was absolutely floored almost from the first sip. Tremendous oak aged beer. I plan to load up the next time I'm in a state where it's distributed."
"Cheers!"
"Served at the Tap House in Oswego, IL. Served in a snifter, inky black with a thick cocoa head. A well-balanced roasty trio of barley, cocoa, and coffee dominate the aroma and flavor, with an oaky bitterness and slight boozy alcohol presence playing rhythm guitar behind the roast flavors. The wood is better balanced than it was in incarnations from a few years ago. A sipping brew with enough complexity to hold one's interest for hours, no mean feat for a stout that really ought to be listed as an imperial."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. It's a well-flavored beer, but it's a heavy hitter for sure. I'm glad I split this bottle as it would've been tough to get through the whole bomber. As of now, it's a pretty hot beer, so hopefully some time in the cellar could mellow it a bit more."
"A luscious libation that can accompany a juicy prime rib at dinner, or pair equally well with some rich chocolate cheesecake for dessert."
"Overall I was impressed by this beer. Next time I can get my hands on it I won't hesitate."
"D- I was pleasantly surprised. This is a pretty solid brew."
"D: Excellent winter beer."
"The pour resulted in a finger of deep-tan head that quickly faded to wisps. Color was a deep, dark-brown with ruby highlights and great clarity. Nose was rich with bourbon-vanilla notes. Zounds! Mouthfeel was rather creamy with notes of smoke, vanilla, wood and black cherry in the mouth. It put me in mind of Calvin's dad in ""Calvin & Hobbes"" asking, ""Say, where did you get this [beer], anyway?"" Finish was redolent with vanilla and bourbon. Absolutely breathtaking. Great lacing throughout. It was an attention-getting beer to be sure, but it also wrapped things up for us pretty quickly. Proceed with caution."
"D. Very good. gets better as it warm a bit. Definitely a great beer this time of year and I will be buying more."
"This beer poured a black color with a tan head. The aroma of this beer smelled of booze, oak, and caramel and roasted malts, with hints of chocolate. The taste of this beer is smooth. The aroma is very deceiving, its a balanced beer, very smooth. The mouthfeel is full, more of a thicker mouthfeel. All in all its very drinkable."
"This is quite good, actually-- I was expecting it to be just ok. Dark brown, moderate tan head on it. Smell is a little lower in my book than the rest of the beer, oaky/woody/boozy. Flavor though is good, roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, oak, and vanilla. Nice stout here. Body is decent, maybe a hair light, smooth though. Very drinkable big stout. Nice one."
"Drinkability: It's a great beer, but 10% one is enough. I slowly sipped this one for an hour."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Even though the 10% ABV is obvious, it's clean. The flavors aren't too well integrated but generally satisfying."
"I wouldn't mind it of I never had one again. Nothing special."
"This is a more simple, and very well executed stout flavor profile. No complex malt flavor, but everything that is there is very well balanced. I've had this a few times and it's one I look forward to having again. I'd recommend it."
"D- Pretty drinkable but the oak and bourbon probably limit it to a couple. That and the 10% abv."
"It doesn't get any better than this. First tried from a tap last year and was hooked. Been searching ever since for something as good (or better) to no avail. So beautifully balanced I feel honored to drink it. Recommend savoring from a snifter and enjoy it like you would a fine cognac. It's that good."
"D- A nice stout, abv is very well hidden. This could be a stout that could convert someone to craft beer or stouts, as it could have very wide appeal, I could have drank several of these, but the game was over and it was time to leave."
"Pouring the beer my mouth started to water. It pours out smooth and dark with a decent head to it. Take a sniff and it smells rich and full with a hint of sweetness. It's got a great taste that lets you know it's been in an oak barrel. This is one beer I say you all have to try at lest once."
"Although slightly boozy, a nice beer and will probably pick up a few more again."
"D - This is a heavy drinker, one or two and thats about all I'd be able to take for a night. Great beer though, just curious to see what ageing will do this beer. I'd love it if the bourbon stays and the alcohol tones mellow."
"D - I would say this is decently drinkable. It goes down fairly easy, but i would prefer if the alcohol bite was toned down a bit. Overall though, I think this a good beer, and I would suggest giving it a try. I'd buy this one again."
"I enjoyed this, and wil likely pick a few more up."
"Mouthfeel- the only thing i don't like about about this beer is the dry feeling it leaves in my mouth. But otherwise it is very smooth and goes down like a dream"
"The higher alcohol content definitely makes this a 1-2 bottle beer, but what a great bottle it'll be."
"D - Decent, awfully candy like, and while it doesn't hide the booze it certainly integrates it very well. Could have stood for a body to match the sweetness."
"D-I consider this beer to have good drinkability.Considering it's ABV and the presence of the oak,it is a smooth and satisfying sipper."
"M/D: Smooth and a bit silky, it leaves a tasty coating on your mouth-- figs and chocolate. The drink-ability is good for the style."
"This ale is well-carbonated and creamy. The sweetness masks the high 10% ABV/ Not brewed for heavy drinking but perfect for brunch at Food Dance Cafe or swirling in your snifter."
"DB- Good stuff. It reminds me sort of Backwoods Bastard with less whiskey and a more roasty-Stout feeling. It is strange because they don't even mention Bourbon/Whiskey on the bottle or website. The medicinal hint is my only small rant here."
"Extremely sweet with nothing to really help balance it out, which I think will turn many people off, but I thought it had lots of good flavors to make up for it. Aging seems like it could help some but I really enjoyed this fresh."
"Some of the flavor aspects to this beer can be one dimentional. But it is still complex and intriuging enough to give a try."
"Good offering but with so many barrel~aged brews available today, this one comes up a little short."
"Drinkability - For the style and ABV, relatively so. I don't get any alcohol flavor nor burn. I will admit, however, that the New Holland Night Tripper Kevin sent me was a hell of a lot better than this. I would be interested to see how this beer would do in the cellar for a year or two. I think it would do quite a bit for it and will have to try this again in the future after a few years of age on it."
"Definitely a sipper but an excellent example of a bourbon barrel oak aged ale. Gonna grab a couple of sixers to have for this winter."
"VERY sweet, no hop presence at all. Could not drink more than 2 of these due to the sweetness and strength."
"I see quite the disparity in reviews here. I bought a 4 pack of bottles of this stuff, and after 1 beer all I can say is - yuck. My favorite beers are OldRasputin, Bell's Expedition,Weyerbacher15 and Brooklyn Black Choc Stout - so I love dark syrupy beers - but this one was horrible. It had way too much of an alcohol/cough syrup type vibe and the combo of how sweet it was with the alcohol and I can see getting sick after a few of these. Almost no head on the pour and after a minute, there was no head at all and the beer comes off as 'flat'. Avoid this one. Maybe they do have quality control issues, but they aren't getting my money on the chance I get something different."
"Just not very impressed with this one at all."
"D: Fairly high. It's not overwhelming with weird flavors, but enough complexity to ponder. A reasonably priced, well executed, barrel aged beer--hard to ask for more. It's no BCS or Dark Lord, but it's not terribly expensive and readily available."
"Silky smooth with no bite from the alcohol, which is a pleasant surprise since I expected a big burn. There is also no stout bitterness. As it warms the bourbon flavor takes over almost entirely, muddling up the finish which started off pretty clean. It begins pretty drinkable but becomes more and more vinous as it warms."
"Pours dark brown with a light head and not too much lace, but a sufficient amount not to get docked. Nose is nice with notes of oak, vanilla, chocolate, roasted malt, and some light coffee. The taste doesn't mix these together quite as well, but is still pretty good. Good feel coming from all different directions and quite drinkable for the big beer that it is."
"This is a very nice surprise, easily the best New Holland brew I have had. All the flavors blend together very well. Sweet and roasty with licks of vanilla rum and chocolate. Smooth, adequate mouthfeel. I am enjoying this quite a bit...It is nothing outstanding, but at the same time everything a barrel aged stout/strong ale should be. Very drinkable."
"Since it did come up...This is safe from bottle or tap...NOT from Dragon tit. Your Beer Insurance will NOT cover the ravaging of local villages and virgins or whatever fate befalls you."
"Overall: Very yummy. If it wasn't for the ABV I'd drink more. Definitely one of my favorite beers."
"Nah, I'd do it."
"Drinkability: Good sipper, even if it is too simple. The oak, vanilla and rum-like qualities are nice; just wish the base beer had a little more character."
"A loose cannon of a beer that has plenty of redeemable qualities and a good flavor, but is massively unbalanced and wild."
"D: I suppose it makes sense that ""Dragon's Milk"" is hot and burning - but I'm not a dragon and need more balance than what this brew has to offer."
"Delicious brew. The color is black with a lush tan head with good retention. The smell is rich and fantastic: vanilla, oak, coconut, cream, with a hint of alcohol lurking in the back. The taste is also rich and fantastic. All of the scents above come out fully in the flavor. Maybe it's the name, but the beer does seem to have a milky or creamy texture. It is thick, but not syrupy. Nice sharp, extra fine carbonation, not wishy-washy and somewhat flat like some dark/stout-ish beers. It is not a stout, but the similarities are obvious. The 9% ABV is noticeable, but not overdone. It's an added bonus that the beer is so good and with the ABV being so high just one or two is a full serving of this stuff (it is expensive). If you have access to this, it is a must try. It won't be for everyone, but if you like stouts and rich specialty beers, this is one you won't soon forget. This is, I think, the best thing to come out of New Holland Brewing, besides their whisky which is stupendously good."
"Drinkability: Very good. A sipper, but a great one. Easy to drink."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty decent brew, but the bitterness and lack of flavor complexity might prevent me from having too many."
"Pours a deep black color with a off white head and generous lacing. Smells of vanilla and roasted malts. Tastes of sweet malt, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and subdued hops. Mouthfeel is very smooth with medium body. Drinkability is good. Really a nice beer. Would drink again. Much better on draft than in a bottle."
"Bought this after forty-five minutes at the store, staring at an endless supply of beer. Kinda wish I would have opted for my first decision, but then again, without moving forward, I can never refine my taste. *Shrug* No go, New Holland."
"Considering the serious body, flavor, and abv attached to this beer, it is quite drinkable and tasty. I enjoyed this beer."
"The taste starts semi sweet and malty with a strong vanilla flavor with a bit of a chocolate after taste. A bit malty but the oak barrel dominates the taste of this beer and it is mostly vanilla and caramel. This could be more complex."
"Its a sipper, but you could make 2 or 3 of these last a long long time."
"This is a beer to be savored and a great one at that. They did a wonderful job bringing together all the flavors in this beer and more importantly my non beer drinking wife even seems to like it! Highly recommended."
"A: Thin head which dropped relatively quick, a little spotting lacing along the interior of the glass, dark brown to black in color - 4.00, S: Oak and vanilla really dominate the aroma profile, there is also a strong sweetness to the nose that reminds me of fudge brownies, within the depths I also pick up some dates or dark raisins - 4.25, T: Significant alcohol burn to the point of almost being harsh, lots of dark chocolates and pureed dates, a little bit acidic and kind of reminds me of a very mild soy sauce, the vanilla that was present on the nose comes through on the palate - 3.50, M: Mouth feel is somewhat thick and creamy - 4.00, D: A good beer that is quite drinkable but there was something that didn't click with me, I generally like the use of oak barrels but I'm not sure that was a benefit to Dragon's Milk - 3.75"
"Notes: This is like BCSs ugly cousin...a little thinner, sloppier, and less complex, but still good."
"Overall this was a very nice beer however the sweetness from the barrels was just a bit over the top and hurt the drinkabililty for me. Still, a good beer that should be on par with Crème Brulee as far as love-hate relationships."
"D- Like I said on top. At first maybe than in the middle on this is good."
"Drinkability: (Yes, that was a word before Budwiser snatched it for a marketing ploy). I knew when I poured a glass of what looked like motor oil that I was in love. If you're a fan of the dark side, the bittersweet nature of this beer is sure to please. The high ABV and full bodied nature of this beer makes it a perfect choice to sip during conversation, movies, or as I prefer, while editing video. If you like the darkest of the dark, give this a try. You probably ought to keep it to just one or two at a time, though! [5 out of 5]"
"Sure, Dragon's Milk is a sipper, but drinkability is pretty good considering. I've been known to enjoy a bottle from time to time & I'll continue to do so. Though not mind-blowing, it's well-structured, tasty & enjoyable. Worth a shot."
"Mouth and drinkability both are high on the charts. Very nice brew."
"I didn't know what to expect from this beer, but, I did get a LOT of flavor! Poured into a Sam Adams glass from a bomber, I got a lot of Jack Daniels in the nose. Taste was pretty much the same. I was hoping for oak, but, got more whiskey than expected. I didn't sense much vanilla. If you're in the mood for whiskey with a beer chaser, just go for this! It's nice to sip anytime of the year."
"Overall I really enjoy one or two of these after a hard day of work."
"IMO, one and you're done. This is a very strong brew. one can understand why you only get a 4 pack. would almost be a chore to have another."
"It had a weak head but with a good dark color. The smell didn't really come through for me. It showed some chocolate and a bourbon taste, but not overpowering. It definitely is a beer with strong taste. It leans a little to a porter, instead of an ale, with a thick chewy taste."
"I've had this multiple times and am reviewing this purely from memory. This is just an amazing combination of roasted malts, vanilla, and bourbon. I can drink this at anytime whether it's on a cold winter night or outside in the heat (I ordered it while sitting outside on a 90 degree day, just because I saw it on tap), which is saying something for a beer this type of beer. This beer was my first of New Holland's and I've been aggresively seeking out anything in their high gravity series ever since."
"22 oz bottle. Pours a dark brown with a red hue, thin fizzy tan head that quickly diminishes, good lacing. Aroma is caramel, vanilla, dark fruits, and wood. Flavor is caramel and roasted malts, vanilla, wood, chocolate, a hint of alcohol, slightly herbal, and dark fruits. Mouthfeel is medium, lots of roasted bitterness with a slight alcohol burn, and fairly carbonated. Good beer."
"This brew is good for a whiskey lover and has some good qualities but also has some room for some improvements."
"Drinkability: The flavors are really very good in this beer, however the high alcohol content is quite present. Very good nightcap."
"D: Smells so much better then it tastes. Alcohol is mostly hidden, but it's still a slow sipper. I've got a bomber cellared in hopes that some age cleans up the taste. In it's current form, I'd pass"
"Tastes of sweet rum chocolates, creamy vanilla spread, oak and alcohol. All in all this is a pretty nice beer and makes a great night cap."
"D - I thought this was quite tasty, and the alcohol was well hidden. Creamy, smooth and easy to drink"
"Some boozy heat on the tongue, but that's okay being that there are noticable bourbon notes for it to stick to. Toasty caramel, chocolate, and bourbon flavors lead to a warm feeling in my tummy; the body has some soft richness, but could use a touch more. It's no oak aged yeti, but I have faith in aging a bottle or two of this for a few. Mellow this sucka out."
"poorly gramatical reviews."
"Pretty good offering from New Holland. I've been wanting to try this for a while now. CBX got it on tap, so I had to take advantage of it. Thought it had a nice taste of coffee, chocolate malts, and a finish of slight bourbon. I thought it went together pretty well and didn't have a nasty aftertaste. Even though it was a little hot here, it still went well, didn't make me feel bloated and full. Glad I got the chance to try it."
"D - This is a nicely done aged beer. New Holland put out a balanced big beer."
"D: I very much enjoyed the vanilla flavors in this, although it did seem a little one-dimensional. The bourbon flavors dominated the base beer. While good and something I had no problem finishing, this wasn't the strongest bourbon aged beer I've had recently."
"D - This beer is giving me a nice hint of bourbon flavor which is what I was wanting. I enjoy this beer but wish it had a little bigger body and roasted flavor but it isn't a stout so I can't really knock it for that. I'm glad I can find this pretty easily it is perfect for when I want a nice bourbon flavored brew."
"Thanks strikertown for being a generous trading partner."
"drinks so well due to the complex flavors intermingling and all vying for attention. booze is there, but its not overpowering. It's just another facet of the complex flavor portfolio this monster of a beer puts out. Excellent brew."
"Cheers!"
"Vintage 2010. So, if I were to suckle at a dragon's teat, this is what would end up in my mouth? Interesting. It pours a nearly translucent black-brown. No real head is formed, save a single layer of ecru foamy bubbles, and this doesn't hang around for very long at all. The nose comprises oak, vanilla, what seems like bourbon, chocolate, and cheesecake. The taste follows exactly, with the cheesecake nearly dropping out altogether, the oak gaining some strength, and a drying booziness invading the start of the aftertaste. The body is pretty hefty, with a light carbonation and a thick, chewy feel. I've had previous vintages of this and have been underwhelmed. It's nice to see such improvement in a relatively short amount of time. Or maybe it's been me the whole time..."
"This was a real treat!"
"D - Yeah, this is just a one. I couldn't imagine having another. The sweet is a bit too dominate in the high gravity series."
"Very glad I tried this one after hearing rave reviews about it for so long."
"I've given thought to trying this out for some time and finally picked up a bottle on the way home. It may be 90 degrees outside, but my basement is in the 60's. I am a little confused whether this is a stout or a strong ale. The bottle claims it's a stout and also claims an ABV of 10%. Well, at any rate... this poured out a little thinner than I expected. I was thinking something along the lines of motor oil, and this was far from that. The smell was very appealing, there was some nice coffee, vanilla, and dark fruit. The flavor was much the same with a bit of smoke and buttery mellowness from the oak. The mouthfeel left a little to be desired. I want a beer of this flavor profile to slither down my throat, this was a little lighter than I would prefer. All in all, a pretty solid effort."
"I got no beef with Dragon's Milk that aging couldn't cure."
"This offering pours a deep black leaving a soft tan head. Nose is sweet oak, caramel, chocolate, nuts, herbs, soft earthy notes. The taste is malty upfront, dry oak, nuts, cherry, tart, wonderful deep pitted fruit flavors great vanilla oaky notes as it hits your palate and the alcohol is there but smooth like a nice cordial. This is a great tasting beer very solid I would pair this with a fruit dessert as this would play well with the tart and sweet flavors of the beer."
"D - A very nice beer. 10% ABV is somewhat noticeable at first but less and less as I continued to drink this. Would definitely pick this one up again if I come across it."
"Pours a very deep brown color with a small off-white head that settles into a light ring. The aroma is of oak and vanilla, quite pronounced. There seems to be a bourbon aroma but not sure if it was actually aged in bourbon barrels. There is some caramel sweetness with boozed soaked raisins and cherries. The taste is big on vanilla and oak with caramel and hints of chocolate. The bourbon is also there in the flavor but not as strong. Perhaps it is the strong vanilla that is making me think it was aged in bourbon barrels. Whatever. The flavors are smooth and are in balance. Some fruit notes pop through in the end. Some boozy dark fruit (raisins) as well as some tart flavors. The feel is moderate, not at all heavy, with soft carbonation, smooth, perhaps a touch sticky. Sweet overall on the palate. Slight slight ABV belly burn. Quite a nice brew, very enjoyable. Smooth as hell and great vanilla flavor without being cloying whatsoever. Pick it up."
"Side not that the listed ABV on the bottle is 10.0% and not 9% as listed by BA, most likely a difference in the 2010 batch from previous."
"Pours a deep reddish-brown colour with off-white head. The smell of the oak immediately jumps out at you, which is what you'd expect with an oak aged beer. The taste has lots of the oak, with the roasted malt backing it up. Some chocolate and caramel in the flavour as well. A whiskey loving friend that I shared this bottle with commented that he loved it because it reminded him of a nice scotch, which I'd agree. Very creamy body."
"D - The oak notes made this beer taste like it was 10% when it's only 8.5%...I liked the beer better when it warmed...the oak aged really overpowered the stout part"
"The palate is rather boozy, toffee and vanilla flavors running rampant alongside oak tannins and a dash of chocolate. The body is full, but more like 2% milk, definitely not like the milk of a dragon. It finishes with a nice balance of tannins, alcohol and malt, exhibiting some lingering notes of chocolate and caramel candy. Pretty good stuff overall, though the name is a bit misleading."
"Overall- Very tasty, despite being a bit too young- lots of complexity, though the oakiness still on the verge of being overwhelming. Pretty good drinkability despite it all, but give this another 6ish months and it should mellow out just right and be a knock your socks off brew!"
"D - kind of heavy and with the amount of alcohol its more of a one and done kind of beer. I could probably only drink this every now and then"
"Conclusion: Tasty oak-aged ale. I'd only had this once before, a couple of years ago, and HATED it. This is much better."
"Fairly drinkable considering the alcohol content and the overall richness. Not quite as complex as others of this style, but also tends to go down a bit easier. I definitely would not complain if offered more of this."
"D - one only. Too sweet."
"22 ounce bottle, 2010 vintage. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention is low, with a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, it smells like bourbon, vanilla, oak, chocolate, roasted malt, and a bit of smoke and coffee. The strongest flavor I can taste in this beer is bourbon, so if you're a bourbon fan you'll love this brew. There's also some smoke, chocolate and roasted malt noticable too, along with a lingering bourbony finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it seems a bit thin but it's also coating, creamy and smooth with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, I thought this was very easy and enjoyable to drink. I think this is a good overall brew, definitely worth a try."
"Overall it was an enjoyably beer that I would like to come back and try after some aging. The high gravity is present the entire time that, in my opinion, would make it hard to have more than one. Definitely recommend sipping on this one for a bit."
"Its a unique brew. I love where they went with this one. Highly recommended."
"Poured into a pint glass at room temperature. This thing just looks ominous. It's a dark, dark amber color with just the lightest tint of red around the edges. You can smell the roast malt from across the room. Very ""bourbony"" smelling up close. Maybe it's the oak barrels. A bit too strong for my liking. This definitely has an interesting taste. There's a huge alcohol bite throughout. This is like sipping a tumbler of Jim Beam Rye. No doubt that this is a one and done for me. Overpowering, but good. I like stuff with a little less ABV, but I'm glad I tried this."
"Original was 4/2.5/3/4/3"
"Overall, if you don't like a glass of whiskey, stay away. If you like some nice juice on the rocks, try it out."
"Thanks to Kane at Roof Brothers in Paducah, KY for recommendating this. Kinda reminds me of a mellowed Goose Island Bourbon County Stout in taste, smell and mouthful. Not much head retention but the oak woodsy smell is followed with a very pungent taste and an ever numbing mouthful. Very good beer from New Holland."
"This is a nice beer. Big and something to sip during a contemplative night. Recommended."
"D: this is a sipper. delicious, but heavy duty. very well-crafted, but the beer is rich and there is an alcohol presence - so i'll probably stick to one bottle, and definitely enjoy it."
"Scent is dominated by butterscotch. There's also vanilla, bourbon, and a touch of bitter chocolate. The taste is much of the same...lots of butterscotch. Also woody vanilla and a chocolaty finish. You can taste that there is a bit of alcohol in this, but it's not over the top. Creamy feel and the carbonation was just right. I was really impressed with this one."
"This is an artful beer, I haven't anything as smooth and oaky as this. New Holland did a marvelous job here."
"Despite a slight mislabeling by the brewery, Dragon's Milk is a decent beer. A little on the expensive side at the $8 I paid for it, and if you're looking for classic roasted flavors, it's not your thing. But worth seeking out. Curiosity satisfied."
"D - The oak intensity along with to much presence of alcohol makes me not want to come back for more."
"Overall - Disappointing, I found the vanilla/oak flavors to be intense and well-developed, but without any supporting flavors to contrast or support the beer (aside from alcohol). Nonetheless, I'm glad I tried it it, it is an interesting beer."
"drinkability is lower than i had hoped for due to the strong alcohol presence and rich flavor profile. definitely a slow sipper. though it's delicious, i'd probably reserve this one for special occasions. it would be a challenge to have more than one of these."
"As a sidebar, this beer is listed at 8.5 ABV while the bottle states it is 10.0."
"This is a decent beer but I'm just left wanting more. At 8.5% it should really have more flavor, more body, but instead it comes off a bit thin. Not bad, but there are better barrel aged beers to be had."
"Nice OA ale. So much vanilla oak flavors it tastes like sublte bourbon. I only had a half of glass would liek to have had more to test progression. Nice beer"
"All in all, this one definitely took me by surprise. Bourbon County is one of my favorite beers, and this brew reminds me so much of it in many ways. If you like a good bourbon flavored beer, then you will love this brew. If you don't like em thick, then avoid this."
"Good, potent, and enjoyable."
"Pours a very dark brown, slightly cloudy, moderately portioned light tan head. Aromas of toffee, maple, brandy, oak, earth, and grape. Tastes of oak, caramel, lactic, vinous, with a sweet and spicy finish. Feels medium bodied but far too thin for an oak aged strong ale with this much malt character. This is a tasty beer, I have had it a couple times. It is too thin but smells lovely and easy drinking. I think this is good, but if they are going to go through the effort to oak barrel age something it might as well be a more perfect beer."
"D: A decent drink, but I wouldn't buy another one."
"Mouthfeel is medium heavy bodied and biting, a little too much so."
"Drinkability: A little hot and overly sweet as it warms and it feels like if I had too much it would turn my stomach; I'm curious to see how this would do with some age on it to mellow out the alcohol."
"D: Not really sure where this beer fits, it tastes a lot like bourbon barrel aged stouts I've had in the past except that it's not a stout and the bourbon really seems to be the only thing driving this beer. If the beer were not barrel aged I am wondering what I'd be left with. Knowing this though the beer is still pretty good and drinks a great deal lighter than the above mentioned Bourbon County Stout. One is good and I'd leave it at that for the night."
"It pours a thick, dark onyx with a nice off-white head. The nose gives you lots of chocolate, dark roasted malt, some vanilla oaky notes and just a hint of the alcohol. Each sip helps paint a full picture of this complex Strong Ale. You start off with lots of chocolate that tastes nice and creamy because of the subtle vanilla, and as it warms you start to taste the malt backing it up, along with some oak notes and again just a hint of the alcohol. The lingering finish is of vanilla and chocolate and leaves you wanting more. This is an awesome and dangerously drinkable beer for the 8.5% abv."
"D - Wow does this suck, I think they just said ""hey will put this in Oak barrels and it will be good because everyone else is doing it"". The Oak and bourbon are way overpowering, just bad brewing in my opinion."
"D - New Holland says this is their crown jewel and I have to say I agree. Even though it has the high level of warmth, I think I could drink this all night long."
"Buy a 12oz bottle to try, not a 22oz. Solid beer but i think it should be a 4-pack $10 beer that you pick up to take to a hangout, not a single bottle that you buy expecting to be blown away."
"Overall, its a good beer."
"If you've never had a barrel-aged beer and are interested to see what the fuss is about, this is probably a good place to start."
"Drinkability: An ok stout, but it would be much better without such a strong oak taste. Also, the alcohol presence is surprisingly noticeable and makes it tough to repeat."
"D: I'd been interested in trying this one for awhile, but I'm glad I didn't go out of my way. Perhaps this was just an off bottle, but even if that wasn't the case, this just was not that great."
"Overall, good start bad finish. Has some potential."
"Overall, I thought this was an enjoyable brew. New Holland did a really nice job with the barrel aging and brought out some nice vanilla notes from the oak. This beer is probably the closest I've come to liquid toffee. Not something I would drink all the time, but I'll probably pick up another bottle if I see it around."
"Overall it averages out to be decent, though very strong in flavors. I might wish it to mellow out a bit and have some of the finer characteristics come through. I like my beers seriously flavorful, however this one doesn't quite put it together."
"Pours a black color. 1/3 inch head of a pale tan color. Slight retention and decent lacing. Smells of barrel alcohol, roasted malt, sweet malt, and yeast. Fits the style of an American Strong Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of oatmeal, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, strong barrel alcohol. Overall, strong alcohol flavor and yet still not as overpowering or distracting from the body, as other aged beers."
"(I spilled half this bottle on the floor...foul.)"
"super creamy mouth feel- like butta. not too thin not to sticky, carbonation is spot on."
"Pairing ideas; Suitable with chicken, or fish. Would not combine with any spicy or hot dishes."
"Overall: The beer is decent, however the alcohol overpowers the finer aspects of the beer. Their are faint hints of vanilla and carmel that get lost in the beer. Overall, I'll drink and enjoy it, but if the alcohol taste were toned done, it would be much better."
"Thin tan head of mixed bubbles, just covers the surface before fading into islands across the surface, light lacing albeit with some stickiness. The liquid is dark enough brown to suggest black, opaque although at the rims and glass bottom you can see it's an orangish brown as well as very clear. In the nose oak barrels is no lie, explosive coconut custard, butterscotch, caramel, chocolate covered raisins, maple syrup and just about anything else bearing a familial resemblance to the aforementioned, plums, prunes and maraschino cherries to boot. Medium-bodied, the low carbonation does little to fend off it soaking in like an anchor. Boozy, here you get another blast of vanilla fudge, butterscotch, caramel, coconut, licorice, etc. The cherry fruit has a cola edge to it like Cherry Coke, then slides you date, raisin, prune flavors. Brush of orange citrus. Relentlessly monochrome, if you are not totally into it from the start would need some kind of food to add contrast."
"Drinkability: I like to knock back a few of these on occasion and always keep a few on hand, but not something I would drink all night."
"Overall Impression: When I bought it, I was under the impression it was an Imperial Stout, but I realized right away that it was too thin for the style. It was a slightly imbalanced - a little heavy on the sweetness, but it is a good (borderline Very Good) beer nonetheless, and certainly worth trying, especially if you like barrel aged beers like I do."
"good beer, nothing great, packs a pretty good punch and it isn't crazy money."
"D = I do like this beer, but somehow it just doesn't draw me to each sip like I would prefer. I find after half a bottle I've really had enough. Good, but not good enough."
"One of these would be fine. I can't imagine going much farther than two or three of these, as it will destroy your palate for both other beers and food. Additionally, the 9% alcohol by volume will leave you reeling after a couple."
"just hanging out at work, (wine bar), tasting for a possible on-tap brew. 22 oz brown bomber and good people. the pour was smooth but little head, a little lacing on the glass, a brew-tiful brown. the taste is nice and malty, a hint of raisin? yum. i could drink the whole 22 oz, but not with heidi about."
"The Dragon's Milk Oak Barrel Stout from New Holland definitely lives up to it's name: it's intense creamy flavor blends beautifully with the mocha/vanilla aroma and nutty finish. Very smooth for a stout, probably due in no small part to its oak-barrel aging. Though it carries a worthy ABV of 8.5%, it's presence is barely perceptible. Heavy mouthfeel, with a slight sticky-sweet taste left lingering on your lips. My only complaint is that I got almost no head with very little lacing even with a vigorous pour. Not an incredibly complex beer, but a pleasant desert-like drink that pairs nicely with these cold Michigan winters."
"Overall, the intense vanilla bourbon flavor overwhelms the beer. I would order a local brewpub's stout over this anyday."
"Served with a fine foamy tan head and good lace. Color is a very dark, almost opaque cherry wood. Aroma is heavy malt, whiskey, caramel, vanilla, toffee, and leather. Flavor is like that, but much more intense and quite sweet. Wonder if they're using lactose... Has a smoothness to the body. Good carbonation. Finish is like flavor and long. Not a session beer. Might work good with ice cream."
"Pours a very dark brown; nearly black in color. Around the edges, where light can shine through, it has some red/brown hues. Less than a finger of tanned head produced despite a fairly aggressive pour. Spotty amounts of lacing cling to the glass and it has fair retension for just a thin layer on top of this beer supported by rising bubbles of carbination. Nose is a big bold slap of woodsy oak character that is a little musty with alcohol, dark sugary sweetness and vanilla all coming into play before the usual toasty grain character of stout. Taste is really no surprise after taking in everything the aroma as to offer. Flavors include literally everything that the aroma presented: oak, alcohol (more in warmth factor than in taste but the taste is clearly there as well) bitter chocolate, and slight dark fruity sweetness like plum. Finishes bitter, but more like a burnt grain kind of bitter than a hop bitter. It has a chewy mouthfeel that clings to the palette and doesn't let go. Overall I really enjoyed this beer. It has a very enjoyable and complex nose and taste. The only thing I found a little distracting was the musty character in the aroma. Other than that I really enjoyed everything about this beer and would highly recommend it."
"D: I've seen this beer around, but have been passing this one up for a very long time. However, I found it to be a very good ale, much better than expected. The high alcohol content gives the beers a lighter feeling and encourages another sip. Enjoyed it."
"I heard about this beer at the Blues and Brews festival in Akron last summer but by the time I got to the distributor they were just handing out the last one. I finally saw it in a store over the weekend and bought a couple. This beer is most excellent - probably moved into one of my top five faves so far. Creamy and delicious in a milky kind of way. The only mistake you can make with this beer is only leaving the store with 1."
"Pours dark brown with glowing ruby highlights. The head is very light and lacy with a light brown color. The thin head gives off a strong sweet vinous aroma. The drink is slow and viscous with low levels of carbonation with sweet roasted malt flavors supported by vanilla flavors from the barrel. The flavor fades slowly and gracefully with just a hint of the sweet vanilla lingering with the warming alcohol."
"Thanks again bud for this beer!"
"This drinks remarkably well, and boasts of its relatively mild alcohol-to-deep character balance. Full and yet drinking with a clean and deceivingly mild feel, the flavor keeps satisfying and calling for another sip to add to the complexity. Not overwhelmingly full in complexity, yet keeping up with the best of its style, ages decently and holds up its own."
"Tasty stuff. Should age well."
"D - enjoyable in many ways, but pretty strong ABV is noticeable. Adding the aged oaky flavors on top makes it fairly rough going."
"d - Overall I think it's a decent strong ale, but nothing to write home about. It does have a creamy, smooth milk/vanilla flavor, but the alcohol comes through in it."
"What it is for sure though, is a damn good big night capper of a beer. Highly recommended."
"The beer is well carbonated for the style, but the mouthfeel is a bit harsh. The alcohol is a little overpowering for only being 8.5%, and the drinkability suffers."
"M/D - Very smooth and velvety on the plate with a medium body. Low volumes of carbonation work very well with this style. The presence of alcohol make it a sipper but nothing you can't enjoy."
"M/D- a nice silky mouthfeel. creamy with subtle carbonation. despite the nice feel. the booziness makes this one a bit of a sipper."
"(D)- Definitely New Holland's best offering and perhaps their most popular too. Still a little sweet like most of New Hollands offerings, but not overly so. I wouldnt mind having this once and awhile."
"What a great after dinner beer. Should be sipped not gulped. Takes some getting used to, but once acclimated, a very nice, unique brew. Will keep a few around for sure!"
"Very smooth mouthfeel that saturates the tongue quickly."
"D: Very good beer couldnt throw down more than a 12oz pint in a sitting though."
"Deep, dark, and heavy define this beer. Not for the faint of heart. This will make you never want to drink a guiness again because it takes mouthfeel to a whole new level. A wonderful vanilla undertone coats your palate and faint notes of whiskey can be caught as well."
"Drinkability: To me this stuff tastes like a good whiskey without the kick in the ass. I've sampled it a few times already and I can certainly see myself dropping another $8 on a bottle. At 10% I wouldn't recommend quaffing them though."
"D -- Drinkability is very good. Flavor complexities keep you going back for more. No harsh alcohol to ruin the sampling -- and at 10%, that's surprising."
"Pours a deep dark brown, nearly black with minimal head, but decent lacing. Smell is of oak, vanilla extract, dark chocolate, nuts, cherrys and a hint of coffee. Taste is very plesantly oak forward, with good roasted grain, cocoa and nut flavors. Cherry flavors in e background. Present is a vanilla extract taste, a good quality oak should impart a natural vanilla like taste itself, but this seems artificial. Definitely a little boozy, and not necessarily in a good way... a tad fusel. Good soft yet medium body, light on the carbonation. I want to like this beer even more than i did, but things need to be blended and mellowed a bit better."
"D-This is a highly drinkable beer. I have no idea what to call it...it is a blend of old ale, stout and perhaps a bit of American Strong Ale, but certainly a standout."
"A great beer overall, the booziness is overpowering at first but it's like a good whiskey. I probably wouldn't drink a ton of it at once, but I'll have more if I get the chance."
"D: Tasty, goes down somewhat easily, alcohol presence lowers the drinkability, but a nice offering of the style."
"Poured from a bomber to a pint glass deep black in color with a small but strong head that lasts smells of roasted malt oak and booze. The taste is creamy reminiscent of irish cream there is oak and vanilla, thete are some complex flavors that i cant put my finger on but are good. the drinkability is not there. this is a heavy brew with a high abv."
"This is a home-town favorite, with good reason."
"D - not a bad beer, but a bit lacking"
"Nicely carbonated, medium bodied, I think this beer would age beautifully, but also is drinking nicely right now. This is a good tasting beer, which I will buy again. The first time i bought this, the beer was hot with booze. Today, 8/3/2013, I am drinking a 2013 vintage, and the alcohol is well disguised for 10.00 % abv. I decided to update my review."
"This was good, but not as good as I remember it from 2-3 years ago. Appropriately named, this was the hottest beer for its Abv (8.5% on bottle) that I have had for awhile. Backing off the oak would improve this beer considerably as it overpowers most of the beer's other qualities. Will have to put some away next time I have the chance and re-review."
"Not what I was expecting but I really enjoy it. I wish the feel was a little fuller, but other than that a very pleasant experience."
"This pours a clear black with ruby highlights all around the glass. A decent looking pour. Plenty of ecru head atop the body. The aroma is sweet bourbon oak along with plenty of malt. The flavors burst on the tongue with coconut quite strong from the bourbon barrels. The oak quality really stands out. Though this is classified an American strong Ale, I would call it a Bourbon Stout without the body. Tons of vanilla and bourbon characteristics are omnipresent. This is one awesome tasting beer. The mouthfeel is lighter than most, but the abv of 10% probably lightens it up a bit. The only thing that would improve with this is possibly a fuller mouthfeel, but I could care less since it is so amazing in the flavor department. If you like the taste of anything oaked, you will love this beer."
"Pours a dark brown color, similar to Coca Cola. The head is off-white. The aroma is strongly wood and bourbon and some vanilla. The flavor is similar with lots of vanilla as well as wood, bourbon, chocolate and coffee. One of the more complex tasting beers I have had in a while. Medium body and low carbonation. Awesome beer."
"D- drinkability is average only for the reason that it is rich,and higher in alchohol. i really liked the flavors and easily drank the 22 0z. myself. that said i wanted something lighter to cleanse my palate. really enjoyed this ale and would recomend !"
"It's decently drinkable. I think the mouthfeel is pretty good though."
"very unusual beer...good."
"I have had this beer many times. It seems to be better on tap. I have also sampled an 07, 08 and 09 back to back. The 07 was by far the better sample. Age does this beer wonders."
"The dragon milk pours a deep brown color with a nice bubbly cream colored head that doesn't hang around too long. Not much lacing lines the glass. The nose has very subtle hints of caramel and vanilla. Not much oak is noticed, but I am picking up some alcohol characteristics. Taste is quite complex with sweet vanilla and raisins with a nice bitter chocolate oak finish. Each sip I am picking up different tastes. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and overall I think this is a very tasty brew. The aromas and taste are both full of complexity and keeps the drinker at the edge of the seat."
"Drinkability- This was one of my first high end beers that I ever had and one I will continue to return to. This is a great beer, and a good interpertaion of the style. One that to be savored but can be enjoyed in more than one serving."
"Decently drinkable for the style. Suffers a little from the flat feel, but it's delicious enough that I can overlook that."
"Clearly, the hot alcohol was my biggest problem with this beer. I would give this another shot if it was cellared for a few months as it can possibly mellow out the booze, but from this first impression, this was a tough one to get down."
"M/D - Full bodied with light carbonation. The somewhat unpleasant alcohol burn brings the drinkability down a notch but it is still an enjoyable beer for the most part."
"It's not astringent, but it is sweet and boozy. Maybe age will calm the alcohol presence. And, while I can appreciate the oak, it dominates just a bit too much here. Still, it's one to buy and share with a friend when you want an oak-aged dark brew and if you're ""in the mood"" for the ""heat""."
"Lighter bodied tha I expected but not thin. Silky chocolate maltiness with hints of caramel and toffee. Not roasty at all. Surprising dark fruit notes including cherry, plum and raisin which provide a nice balance to the heavy malt presence. Subtle bourbon presence that isn't overpowering, letting the other flavors shine through. Earthy oakiness with a nice touch of vanilla which adds to the smoothness of the beer. This in combination with the well masked ABV make this beer pretty quaffable. Slightly dry finish."
"Taste is roasted malt, oak, and a tiny bit of dark chocolate bitterness. A bit ashy in the aftertaste. Slightly fuller than medium bodied. This is standard fare for barrel aged stouts. Nothing to make it stand out, but definitely still very flavorful and somewhat tasty"
"This is a beer that I have seen but have passed on buying for the last 5 years. I finally picked up a bottle and I'm glad I did. I really enjoyed this tasty brew."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle with no freshness date. At first glance it looks like cola only a little thicker with heavy carbonation coming to the top. Aroma of a chocolate french press. Light body extreme full flavor. Coffee creaminess, dry chocolate almost nut like flavor. Some minor vanilla notes. Warming alcohol feeling makes this a sipper and somewhat detract from the drinkable nature."
"D: Good to sip. Goes down rather easily for the ABV and style. Sweetness hinders drinkability."
"D: fairly good despite the overall warm booziness, balanced by the smooth roasted character. At 9.0%abv a bomber is about all I could handle though enjoyed every last sip of it. A dark, brooding and sometimes intimidating drink that is sure to warm the cockles of your heart, and pit of your stomach."
"22 oz., silk-screened bottle. It pours damn near pitch-black, with ruby highlights and a finger of khaki head that leaves a few wisps of lacing. Very chocolatey in the nose, with a present, but not too strong oak note, roast, hints of vanilla, and a touch of isopropyl after a hefty swirl. Tastes of roast and chocolate, with hints of green hops that impart a medium bitterness, vanilla, and a mild, but ever-increasing oaky aftertaste. A little alcohol flavor as well. The body starts a bit thin, but becomes a bit creamier as it warms. It comes across as an oaked-up stout that is tasty for sure, but a little rough around the edges. Perhaps some aging would improve this one."
"Not fantastic, but I enjoyed this 07' vintage more than fresh samplings."
"Dark and tasty-a great beer to end the evening."
"D: one of my favorites when I'm back in Michigan. One of the best barrel aged ales ever made."
"With other great oak barrel aged ales out there, I would likely pick those over this, but this is a beer that is worth trying once."
"Drinkability: A good not great strong ale. You must like oak for this one to appeal. This one is sweet but not overly so. The dominate oak gives this some bite and is biggest reason why this one is a one per sitting beer."
"Drinkability: I would not buy it again, but would drink it again, and would be open to drinking an aged bottle. I think a different barrel for aging would make a world of difference. Its very close to being fantastic, but ends up being an OK version of high end beer."
"O: Ok ale, but not nearly as complex as the bottle implies. Strong -OH and overwhelming oak suffocate the malt and vanilla (chocolate)."
"A disappointment considering I am generally a fan of New Holland's brews. It poured rather flat and the taste was quite overwhemling. The strong oak flavor overwhelmed all of it supposed complexities. It was a beer that I had to fight with to drink."
"Drinkability: despite the high alcohol levels, this beer goes down smoothly and it is almost like a liquid meal in a bottle. Worth a try by anyone who can get their hands on it."
"New Holland's Dragon's Milk is definitely a beer worthy of a stout fan's palate. The price is reasonable, it is fairly common and thoroughly enjoyed by this reviewer."
"I would buy a 6 pack of this stuff, but not at $4.95 per bottle. I would not be interested in an entire case. This is more like a desert stout, which you would have only 1, possibly 2 of after dinner. If you plan on drinking a 6 pack of these, you may be out cold at #5."
"D- Nice flavor + High ABV= somewhat drinkable. I don't think I'd ever go out and buy a whole case, but I'd drink a few out at the bar"
"Drinkabilty, well, if I could get this in Arizona, it would always be in my fridge. I enjoyed this beer a lot, one of the better beers I've had in the last year! I'll be seeking out more of this!"
"Black in color, not much head. I enjoy American strong ales as much as the next guy, so I'll be adding this to my list of very drinkable beers. Makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Cheers!"
"I have a 2nd bottle to age a bit more but for now I'd have to say the drinkability is average."
"New Holland Dragon's Milk ale pours a finger of sticky tan foam over an opaque black brew. Carbonation is hard to gauge, but a little slow. The nose is roasty malts, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, molasses, and a note of alcohol stiffening everything up. Flavor is pretty much a reflection of the nose- sweet dark malts, notes of dark fruit, and chocolate balanced by espresso bitterness, a ghost of herbal hop and a rummy nip of alcohol. Mouthfeel is round and smooth, with that tang of alcohol (8% by volume) keeping things from getting fuzzy. Not exactly a porter/stout/wee heavy it's just a nice big barrel aged beer- just the thing for dark cold nights."
"D: Let's just say I am sad I only bought the one."
"I bought this beer at the beginning of my beer journey. I must admit that I was drawn into the marketing and picked it up because of the cool label (and because I really didn't know anything about styles at the time). I actually mistook it as a stout until reading more into it. It was immediately my favorite beer and I now buy any ""American Strong Ale"" or dragon labeled beer out of tribute to this beer and to see if any other is even close to this. I actively seek out this beer and always have one tucked away in the back of the fridge (away from beer thieves) for special occasions or when I am tired of other styles. I'll share a bottle with someone but only if they will appreciate it. This is my #1 favorite brew."
"Poured a dark brown in color. Head was offwhite in color. Or you could probably say tan in color. Had a nice two fingered head that didnt hang around very long. Left some lacing, but not alot. Smelled of alcohol, caramel, and malt. Tasted sweet like caramel. Also notes of cream, oak, and alcohol. Felt good in the mouth. I thought the carbonation was right. With the higher ABV, you couldnt make this a session beer. But it sure tasted good on a cool October evening."
"High abv doesn't make this session worthy but I would get this again."
"Drinkability: Definitely a sipping beer with its many rich flavors."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a cola color with a moderate off white head that had small bubbles (almost like on nitrogen). Rich oak aroma with a bourbon alcohol nose with toffee and vanilla notes. The taste is strong of aged bourbon and coffee and chocolate. Very smooth on the palate but does have a strong alcohol finish.This is a great brew and I thank my bro Steve for giving up a bottle for me to review...good thing it is in a 1 1/2 pint bottle for longer enjoyment."
"Too much oak for me. I tried to separate that out in this review but it clearly influences it."
"Solid brew. Pretty easy to drink, but I""m sure the 9% will catch up with me quickly! ;)"
"D: Fairly easy to drink, and for the price definitely something I will go back to"
"Pours a muddy brown color with a medium sized tan head. Big nose of whiskey barrel and sweet roasted malts. Bang, whiskey again right upfront, i love how much the wood shines through, but then again, i also love whiskey, but i could see how some people may think its a bit overkill. Mellow, boozy and pretty drinkable for a beer of this magnitude, but still a sipper for sure. Very well done, glad to have it in New Jersey."
"Unfortunately the online store I bought this from only had one 12oz bottle left. I wouldn't mind having this on hand to drink occasionally."
"I drink this think like a cocktail. It has a huge alcohol feel, but not so much of the alcohol content compared to others. Too many and these can take you under, but a bomber on a lazy night is absolutely heaven. Give this thing a chance and enjoy the tastes for what they are supposed to be."
"Flavors are huge and can overwhelm. Very boozy. Tough to do a whole bomber of this. A unique beer that won't soon be forgotten."
"This is a good beer, but with a couple tweaks could be great. I felt mostly disappointed as I made my way through the bottle."
"Overall, this beer is pretty much what I expected. I enjoyed it a lot and would not be opposed to buying it again. A solid brew from New Holland, who I'm liking more and more these days."
"Not a session beer by any stretch of the imagination, yet nonetheless, an interesting concotion..."
"Excellent beer, as always. A readily available barrel-aged brew that's easy to get & not priced to heart-attack levels? Sign me up. I should be drinking this one more often. Tip o' the cap to New Holland once again."
"A very drinkable beer that drinks much easier than the volume would dictate. Be careful, this is one dragon that may sneak up on you!"
"D: A pretty solid brew. This is one that would make a fall night by a bonfire complete. One of my favorite offerings from New Holland."
"Drinkability - a great sipper that I will track down again."
"D: This is what I expected pretty much and it didn't disappoint by any means. I could use a bit more in the flavor department but I really can't bitch. This is a damned solid brew and I would be totally game to have this on a regular basis. New Holland is really impressing me with what I have had so far from them and I look forward to further exploring this brewery."
"I poured into a pint glass to a scant tan head. It is dark brown/ black in color. I get dark fruit, coffee, and chocolate on the nose. I get all of those in the taste too. It reminds me of the Bell's Special Double Cream Stout I had last night but not as good. I do get some alcohol as well. Overall, it is better than the draft that I had, but still not that great, good but not great."
"Overall, a pretty good beer. I would probably buy it again and definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys stouts."
"Overall, an okay oak aged strong ale and one that I might even have again. However, it isn't one I will seek out again given the price. Worth a try but not particularly super in my book."
"Meeeh! Right out of the bottle I was going, ""meh."" The pour was uninspired, there was absolutely no head. PBR has head, how does this fail to have head? The look is fine else wise, it looks like any dark beer. The smell is meh, very faint not distinct, just average. Actually it almost has no smell. Try and swirl this, I dare you, you'll won't get any noticeable scent. The taste, I swear I've had this beer before. Oh wait, no I haven't it's just that Dragon's Milk has such an average taste that you'll swear you've had this before. The beer proclaims that it was aged in Oak Barrels, yet I can't taste it. It's about as disappointing as having a bachelor party in your friends with basement with no stripper. (Story behind that comparison.) The proclamation that it was aged in Oak barrels was the reason I bought this beer and that it was called Dragon's Milk, that's cool. You know how hard it is to milk Dragons? It's impossible because they don't exist, silly. My roommate and I spent more time trying to identify what it tasted like, which is detrimental to the enjoyment factor of the beer. But when your beer is completely meh, you have to find enjoyment somewhere."
"if you love oak aged beers, like i do than a must try"
"I was unsure about this beer at first, then things started to get better and better as it warmed. A nice beer to try if you have a sweet tooth and/or are an oak lover."
"D: as far as the centipoise measurement goes it's a bit thin for my taste. However, the flavors are a nice experience. A solid effort from New Holland and a sure place in the fridge when the chance allows. The lighter body makes drinking a piece of cake and where is the alcohol? A tasty liquid overload"
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable thanks to the smoothing, mellowing effect of the oak. Would love to have this beer again."
"Poured a dark reddish brown but it is too light, I shouldn't be able to see through this at all. The head didn't last that long and some intermittent lacing. Smells of oak, vanilla, little bit of chocolate and some diacetyl. Upon tasting, strong Bourbon, oak tannins, small amount of coffee, and has some spiciness to it. In the mouth, it's thin. There are no lingering flavors or coatings, which would be fine if it where a lighter beer. This was one of my segway beers, helped me appreciate better beer. I think my palette has evolved, it's more difficult to finish this time. It would be an interesting experiment to age one for a year or two and see how it mellows."
"Drinkability: Once you get used to it, this is actually a very drinkable beer. I think I'd like it with a touch more hoppiness for balance, but this beer's stellar reputation is pretty well-deserved."
"Drinkable enough, but I would see aging this one in the cellar would help the alcohol from taking such a noticable presence. Decent brew."
"D. No thanks, I wouldn't have more than one."
"The taste mirrors the scent. The flavors are full blown and come out nicely, but they lack that over the top robustness found in some of the other Old Ales that I have had. Fairly creamy, with a nice roasted caramel flavor on the tail of the glass. Really good beer. The mouthfeel is a little bit thin, but that is overlooked in the high drinkability."
"Pours a beautiful, thick, dark brown, developing a tan-colored creamy-frothy head. The head settled down to 1/4 inch and persisted. The initial and subsequent nose is full of vanilla, chocolate, coffee, nuts and anticipation. Well-formed Belgian lace. Very rich, chocolaty, caramel, and vanilla bean on the palate. Delicious malt with perfectly balanced bitter notes. Lingers long and very pleasantly. The alcohol and wood is evident, but in a round, gentle, yet full way. Warmth - yet not too potent for a summer day. Definitely moreish. If you favor large, tannic red wines with your food, this would be an excellent ale alternative. Use some in your marinade/sauce. The ale has enough body and flavor to accompany rich foods and food off the grill. Port wine comes to mind, but it doesn't taste like Port - rather this is a reflection on the complexity of the ale. I will definitely return to this ale throughout the year. Pours a beautiful, thick, dark brown, developing a tan-colored creamy-frothy head. The head settled down to 1/4 inch and persisted.

"For 8.5%abv this is very drinkable. Since it's a bomber, you probably still wouldn't drink more than two or three in a session, but that would be plenty."
"D - A great drinking wood aged beer, well worth checking out/price of admission. A beer I wish I could have tasted on tap when Brass Rail had it -C'est la vie. A great oaked beer in a bottle I would get 6 or 12 and hold half back -no question."
"D: Good, could maybe drink two bombers and would be done for the night."
"Aroma is interesting - somewhat smoky like a stout, but with a strong alcohol bite like a barleywine and a decided overtone of oak. It pours a dark, warm, chocolaty brown with a fairly thick beige head that is not all that persistent. Flavor is somewhere between a stout and a barleywine - oak dominates, and there is some ""stouty"" smoke-coffee-chocolate flavor plus quite a strong alcohol bite like a good brandy. Texture is sharp, edgy and tingly, going down more like hard liquor than beer."
"Almost opaque, a bit of light comes through the top sides of the glass, sparse tan head. Smell is like a big oak tree after a spring rain, chocolate wafer cookie, with air comes some vanilla. Ooooh, what a creamy mouthfeel this is with the taste of whipped chocolate, chocolate chips, hit of bakers chocolate, loads of chocolate malt ... wait, did I mention chocolate? A bit of nutmeg and pepper thrown in. Rich substantial body, alcohol well hidden. With air, a sour dark fruit taste emerges. Nice lace continues, rich full in the mouth, astringent finish detracts, could probably benefit from some ageing. A bit of alcohol heat in the finish, esp with warming, dark vanilla beans. A most interesting concoction, try one!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Just remember to stand up once in a while and take stock of your facilities before you get in trouble."
"D - Dragon's Milk boasts exceptional drinkability for a bourbon barrel aged Strong Ale. This one definitely exceeded my expectations. My first encounter with New Holland was certainly a memorable one. I will be seeking out more from this brewery in the future."
"Well this should improve my evening greatly. Somehow I had it in my head that this was going to be a stout, but I was clearly wrong. This is definitely one of those times where I have no problems with just how wrong I was. Recommended!"
"Poured from a 22ounce bomber bottle into my shaker glass. Shared with brothercannon. The ale appears an opaque dark brown color with about an inch of ecru foam. Notes of oak, vanilla, milk chocolate, caramelized malts, mellow alcohol, slightly nutty/fruity. Medium to full bodied with ample carbonation for an old ale. Tasty stuff. Check it out if you happen upon a bottle."
"Dability is relatively low - alcohol is quite present, the beer is strong, and the flavors not sufficiently interesting to make the alcohol worth it. And too expensive to buy merely for its drunkening powers."
"Drinkability- Very good beer with lots of good flavor. Could use a bit more oak flavor and maybe a tad more thickness in the feel, but overall still a really good beer worth trying."
"Pretty good. Worth trying."
"Notes: A big, interesting, delicious beer is a sipper and it really demands your attention. I first had this on tap at Ballantine's in Willoughby. The bottle reveals that it is consistent in both forms. Everyone reading this should try Dragon's Milk. A ""crown jewel"" beer at New Holland is certainly one that they can be proud of."
"D - couldn't have more than a few but I'd like to try!"
"D: Too sharp and woody for my taste. Improves with warming but not enough to generate much enthusiasm."
"D: You have to remind yourself, hey, this is 9%. Slow down, enjoy it, and call it good."
"D: I'm not sure what to make of this. It's kind of in style limbo. It has a few elements of a stout, an old ale, and a barleywine, but it never really takes off when taken as a whole. I don't regret trying it, but I don't see myself seeking it out in the future."
"D: This is a solid beer. Nothing to go apeshit over, but I certainly enjoy it. I'd have it again and might be in a mood to track down a second bottle sometime."
"d- I doubt I could really have more than one every few hours. This is a very good beer I just think the alcohol in it was a bit much and came through too much to drink more than one in one sitting."
"Medium bodied. Restrained prickliness. Rather crisp. The finish is a bit syrupy, not in a pleasing way."
"I will be buying some more of these. Even at a B plus, this is underrated here."
"I would rather pick something up. This sort of reminds me of the espresso oak aged yeti, but far less tastier. So meaning I would rather pick something else up and would not drink this again."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle. The look was pretty much what I expected, dark and almost inviting. The smell made me cringe, straight bourbon-whiskey-alcohol. Then the taste. I just plain don't like whiskey, and this is all I tasted. For what it is, the mouthfeel was the only thing this has going for it. Light for the ammount of alcohol, and if I liked it, I could sip it all night long. Drinkability is pretty much a 0. But it only goes down to 1. Says on the bottle that this is New Hollands ""crown jewel"".... Well, give me those rocks and stones over there please."
"Drinkability: Drinks like a porter. Exceptional taste packed with flavor. Very enjoyable. I highly recommend."
"I like assertive beer and this one is very much so. Dragon's Milk felt like it feels to sit in a dark brown leather chair in an ornately decorated high-end whiskey bar. It's best sipped slowly and allowed to warm in the glass."
"A high bar has been set for barrel aged imperial stouts. Dragon's Milk just does not live up."
"Poured into pint glass. Pours a nice looking-opaque black, with a finger or so of off-white head that eventually dissipates. Smells nice, with oak, chocolate and malt scents. Taste is pretty good, with sweet malt and oak hitting the front end, and a little chocolate and roast coffee hitting the backend; the aftertaste is a little boozy and roasty. Nice carbonation and thickness, enjoyable. Couldn't see myself having too many of these in a night, and took a long time to finish sipping the ~16 oz. I had."
"Purchased a bomber while on vacation about six months ago, and it's been sitting in my cellar since then. Thought it was time to crack it open on a Sunday night. Poured into stemmed glassware. Dark brown body, but held to the light, you can see it's extremely dark red. Good head, and nice lacing. Definitely can smell that barrel aging with a good long sniff. Taste was excellent. Robust ale flavor that was complimented even more by the oak. I actually like the use of American oak here instead of a bourbon or whiskey barrel. This beer tasted like an ale aged in a barrel, and not an ale aged in Jack Daniels. The beer flavor stood out, and not the liquor. Quite a nice change of pace from the last couple of barrel aged beers I've sampled. Mellow and easy to drink, tons of flavor. Even my wife liked it a lot. Darn, I wish I had picked up more than just one. Keep your eyes open for this beer."
"D= Decent. Like I mentioned this is a very woody beer. Tastes great but the mouthfeel is subpar. I'll prolly look for it again sometime to age and see how it progresses. Not a bad beer."
"22oz. bottle served in a snifter. Poured a dark reddish brown with a quickly dissipating head. Lots of chocolate in the aroma, also a bit fruity. A bit of hops come out in the aroma as it warms. More chocolate in the flavor. Medium to full bodied. Vanilla flavors from the oak. I really got the flavor of a good English toffee from this beer. Fairly long finish with more vanilla notes from the oak. Very easy drinking for 9%."
"Poured into tulip producing a very dark brown with thin head. Nice notes of coffee/cocoa, very light vanilla, woody nose. Taste followed suit though chocolate present initially and just the slightest smoke hints up front accent the nose. Overall mouthfeel is good, nice, smooth, easy to sip though there is a bit of alcohol taste which, at 9% ABV is understandable though this isn't something that's going to be part a very long session. Good beer though and happy i've got more in the cellar."
"Overall, this is a drinkable beer partially because it is not so overwhelmingly intense. However, it seems like it could have delivered a bit more punch, but still good."
"D-An easy one to enjoy. Plenty of flavour and balance with good smoothness making for pleasant brew. The 9% ABV goes by unnoticed."
"The ABV limit's the drinkablity, but don't shy away from this one."
"Pours very dark, possible red coming through when held up to very bright light. Sort of a light body, with alot of carbonation and alcohol coming through. Mild head light brown to white color. Not much on the oak flavor, age would probably help round out the flavor of this brew for me at least."
"D- I went through a 22 oz bomber over about 2 hours, took my time with it, let it linger, allowed it come up to room temp, started at cellar around 48deg...very nice, but the complexity really shines at about 60deg. Really nice beer."
"drinkability: this is a pretty decent brew. i know by the time i get finished with the bomber i will be tired of this brew."
"Blipped ""Beast and Dragon, Adored"" by Spoon"
"D - will enjoy every sip of this, need to get another one and cellar, must sip or you might miss out on everything this beer has"
"This will not be my last Dragon's Milk."
"D-Not something I would want all the time but im glad we can get it here in 750's now"
"I found one easy enough to drink, but don't know if I need to go back for a second. I've had it on tap before (didn't review it though), & would be more apt to have a second or third of a draft."
"mouth is viscous and rich. Drinkability is fairly low because this one is surely a sipper. Flavors actually develop more when it warms to near room temp."
"D: See above note on swirling, sipping or gulping. Mmmgood."
"Overall, I really liked this beer. It's possibly the most drinkable imperial stout I've had. The flavors are nice and complex without hitting you over the head like a sledgehammer. I drank this bomber way too fast."
"Creamy feel, although probably a bit lighter than it should be. Lasting finish. Moderate carbonation. The alcohol isn't very noticeable. Easy drinker."
"The aroma is toasted with milk, vanilla, wood, chocolate, and molasses. The appearance is dark brown with an average head. The flavor is like the aroma but is rather weak. The palate is rather thin. Overall it's too washed out for my liking but still quite drinkable."
"Deep ruby color, creamy tan head, leaves some lacing. Smells of roasted malt, caramel, chocolate, and has a creamy quality. The taste is smooth and creamy, the roasted malt dominating the flavor, a little bitter (can't tell if that's hops or not), the caramel and chocolate surface slowly and there's a slightly spicy lingering finish. Definitely a delicious brew, fits the name well. Very easy to drink and the high ABV is fairly hidden. Great balance and body, and just delicious. This is the favorite of everyone at a beer bar near me called Chappy's, and it's obvious why."
"D: I'm going to enjoy the rest of the bottle, not sure how often I'll buy this, though."
"D- very easy to finish. its nice to have a beer thats barrel aged on the shelves year round. this is something i wish i would have discovered sooner. cant see myself finishing more than one in a sitting, but its something ill try again sometime soon. the interesting flavor and well hidden ABV work in this ones favor, big time"
"Very impressive."
"D - This quite a good beer, not very sessionable, but I do not think it aims to be. Very flavorful, and a good, warming nature makes this quite a treat"
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"This one was poured at Smokin' Joes on the Southside - Feb 14th 2009. A dark almost black brew with dark brown highlights and a tan head that quickly dissipated. The smell is light with some oak and vanilla and a slight alcohol. There are dark fruits and some cocoa trying to push through. The taste is very boozy with a dominate vanilla and oak. There is some bourbon and brandy as well as the dark cocoa and a hint of bitter coffee. This one is very creamy and thick. It tastes amazing but is a lot all up front. This one needs to calm down a bit."
"8.5% ABV. Dark brown, ruby edges, small tan head that was gone in less than a minute, very little lacing. I'm not getting much out of the aroma. I'm really hoping it's because it was poured rather cold. I'll give it a few minutes to warm up. OK, starting to warm now, some sweet, light fruity aroma starts to come out, some whiskey-ish alcohol, red grapes, and light chocolate. Flavor is a little strange to me. There's some very light, almost watery chocolate flavor going on, definite oakiness throughout, and a grassy, earthy component in the finish. There's the grape flavor again. What the hell is this? I'm starting to get a stale red wine flavor in the aftertaste. Ugh, this thing finished bad. It's very light bodied for the color. Maybe I just don't like it because it's dark and expect it to drink like a stout or a porter. It tastes more like a doppelback fermented with ale yeast and aged in oak. The taste and aroma does improve slightly as it reaches room temperature. Not my thing, but hey, I'll finish it anyway."
"Overall, this was a great bourbon beer. I would have preferred it to be a little richer, but because it was light, I finished my glass in no time."
"I tried this beer on tap, and a bottled version. The bottle was nowhere near as good as the tap version, while this is true of many beers it is very apparent with this beer. A lot of the complex aromas and flavors were lost when bottled. But the aroma was very sweet with a definitive brandy flavor. The taste was sweet and had a definite alcohol warming. The color was black. I loved the spicy flavors from the hops. There were definite sweet estery notes as well. This is a great beer, but on tap, this is a phenomenal beer."
"Overall, I will for sure pick up more of this in the very near future."
"Overall very nice."
"D: An extremely easily downed and smooth ale with a great bourbon finish. Nothing was too harsh, it was mellow from the start. A very impressive beer, claps to New Holland."
"Mouthfeel: Light velvety with not a lot of carbonation."
"this is a really good beer, its hard to describe but it is fantastic"
"Drinkability: I wish it wasn't nearly $8 for a bomber, as that seems way too much. But over a long period of time, especially if you like barrel aging, then this is a quality brew. I hope to try more from this series in the future."
"This beer has a nice dark golden brown amberish color to it. Has a fair amount of hops making me think it was somewhere between an imperial ipa and a Belgian double. I really like the flavor although I'm sure I couldn't handle more than a bomber due to the thick richness. It does have a slight buttery taste, so I think it's fairly valid to have milk in the title. The scent is extremely caramelish and of course that definitely influences the taste on this one. I will seek this out again. I think it could even improve with some cellaring. This beer has made me want to set up a trip to the brewery."
"Taste: Lots of vanilla, if there was any oak in here before it's gone now. Kind of disappointing because I've had one of these that was fresher and the oak was really noticeable and delicious. Aside from being currently oak-less it still tastes alright and has a very creamy but kinda light mouthfeel to it."
"Can't help but think this is more like a stout, but as a Strong ale its a nice change of pace and suits New Holland and the name ""Dragon's Milk"" very well and is a solid brew to drink down and warm up with in these chilled Wintery evenings."
"Drinkable, I dont think so. Im wondering if I can finish it."
"Worth a try, but for the High Gravity offerings, I'd go with the Black Tulip."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, and the finish is all vanilla. Pretty interesting and unusual, but not quite up my alley."
"Black pour with ruby edges,one finger tan head.Aroma of vanilla,chocolate,burbon,oak,and dark roasted barly very nice. Flavor is complex and changes as it warms,sweet boozy vanilla creamy oaky honey burbon goodness. Full creamy mouthfeel,chewy and sticky.This came highly reccomended, I now agree.... Good stuff !"
"(3.7/5)"
"Hard to pin down as a style. I'm happy I tried it. Not a bad beer, but not one I'll rush to track down again."
"Poured a dark stout like color with a nice thick foamy head. Nice welcoming aroma of vanilla, toffee, and oak. Strong ale flavor with hints of the oak barrel in which it was aged. Also tasted tones of vanilla and roasted barley. This was a thick ale almost stout like. I would only want to drink one or two of these in a sitting. Overall a very complex brew and one that I look forward to trying again in the future."
"8/4/8/4/19/4.3"
"Pours black with a redish tint. Slight tan head with little retention. Stong chocolate, vanilla aroma with hints of coffee. Oakiness varies bottle-to-bottle. Mouthfeel brings memories of milkshakes. A very, very good beer. Would love to try this on draft."
"Cheers"
"Dark red/brown pour, almost no head to it. Not a strong aroma, slight coffee and toffe. Pretty malty with carmel and slight chocolate. Nice warming going down, 9% abv not offensive at all. Had some other bourbon barrel aged beers, I don't get much in this one from oak barrel.. Reminds me of Highland Brewing's Tasgall Ale. Not bad at all though."
"D - I downed a single bomber of this and didn't care for any more. This is a complex and carefully crafted beer that isn't necessarily my favorite style."
"D: This beer is in no danger of being poured out. Love it. It should be available in 12 oz bottles though."
"Man, I love winter. Not only for the snow and the crisp, cold air, but for the BEER!! And this one is definitely one that I can't wait to get my hands on as soon as it is released. Maybe it's because I'm also a big bourbon fan, but I really like this beer. In the nose, you can gather right away that this beer has spent some time in bourbon barrels. It has aromas of bourbon, toasted marshmallow, vanilla, sweet cream, chocolate, and a hint of spice. I also love the mouthfeel! Nice and creamy, (feels and tastes like there was some lactose thrown in to provide residual sugars) with a roundness and depth that just fills the mouth with goodness. The only downside to this beer is that (at least out of the 22oz bottles) the head is a little thin and tends to disappear quite quickly. I'd love it if the head were a little creamier and stayed around a little longer. Nonetheless, this is still one of my favorite winter beers. A bit pricey, but definitely worth it!"
"mouthfeel is heavy, thick, rich, a complex sipper, loads of amazing flavors mmmm"
"Overall, a must try. The fact that I can't get over is that it is such a complex beer, yet the flavors are so equal in part that there isn't a distinct taste. If only some of the flavors were more pronounced..."
"New Holland's decision to age this in oak barrels was most likely a smart one. Although it is a quality stout, or whatever Beer Advocate chooses to list it as, the beer no doubt benefited from a little extra complexity. It's certainly something that will suit the cellar and makes a more than worthy pick up if you're fortunate enough to find it."
"Poured a 22oz beer into my Unibroue tulip. This beer pours a thin, chocolate brown, with a big creamy light brown head and left sizable lacing down the sides of the tulip. The aroma is heavy oak, vanilla, chocolate, molasses, and what reminds me just of a hint of bourbon. I actually think this is the oakiest aroma I have ever had the pleasure to smell in a beer. The taste is chocolaty up front with oak playing a much lesser role, just imparting some vanilla and woodiness to the flavor profile. Milk chocolate and cream come through. This is really a tasty brew. The mouthfeel is a little light for how big his beer is but not really off putting. This is a really good beer and one that I think I will be searching out again."
"As it warmed, it got better... but there's no need for me to ever drink this again. I wouldn't turn it down, but I'd rock a FFF Moloko instead. I think the whole milk stout / strong ale or whatever the heck this is classified as -- style leaves me a little bored."
"Bottle thanks to Daniel. Pours a dark brown/red color with a large light-brown head. The aroma is very nice; lots of roasted notes, some chocolates, some woody aspects also. The taste is excellent; initially sweet malts, milky and thick roasted malt flavors, some sweet chocolates, and some light and earthy wood flavors in the finish. Very easygoing, and hardly hot at all. Very decadent and extremely milky. Some alcohol present, but overall, a very quaffable brew. Very enjoyable."
"Well blended ale, this one is smooth and delicious. Pours dark like a stout with a creamy off white head, nice lacing and retention. Aroma is a light mix of coffee, mild chocolate, and some caramel. Rich and ever so smooth mouthfeel, this one has a soft finish that is remarkable. Flavor is exceptional nice mix here of lightly roasted malt with bitter coffee and milk chocolate. After a while I could taste a nice helping of vanilla along with some very mild hops. There is barely a hint of the high abv which helps to make this smooth and drinkable. What a nice treat indeed."
"Drinkability: Surely not a ""session beer"" its definately a ""sipper."" A perfect fit for a chilly winter eve, after an outdoor activity. I drank the 22oz Bomber this fall while handing out candy; it is arguably one of Michigan's finest examples of an ""American Strong Ale."""
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Extremely smooth on the palate and easy to drink. Sure I don't think that I'd quaff this, its definitely a sipper...It'd be great to warm up with on a cold winter night. Body is full and heavy, creamy with a velvet like smoothness. Carbonation is at a perfect level, low so as not to interfere with the smooth body. This is one that I'll definitely recommend to anyone. This is one I can easily see myself buying again."
"I hope to re-review, had it at a restaurant and was a little rushed, and it was served too cold."
"D: Not bad, not the beer I had hoped it would be, but good nonetheless."
"D: ABV is the only kicker but this is a staple of my fridge."
"M: Carbonation just slightly more than a stout, and is textured with medium body. The higher ABV makes it difficult for me to believe that you could session it, but my fondness for the style, as well as Kentucky bourbon makes me think that I could have 2 or 3 for sure."
"I would recommending trying since most places only serve it in small amounts anyways."
"D: I could have this beer often but I couldnt have more than 1 glass at a time."
"i would most likely grab this beer again if i had the chance."
"I poured this bomber into my 20oz glass. This beer pours black with a nice frothy head that sticks around awhile and leaves some decent lacing. Smells of chocolate, malt and alcohol. The taste is very dry like dark chocolate with some cherry taste at the end. The taste from the wood is also very prominent and must contribute to the dryness of this beer but not in a good way. The mouthfeel is smooth but a little dry. Drinkability is moderate. I finished the bomber but it certainly did not wow me. Overall I am glad I tried this beer but I expected much more when I purchased it."
"Lots of clean barrel wood tastes upfront with sweet vanallia candied carmell,not as boozy as the aroma would indicate.Smoother than anticipated,lacks complexity has clean sharp bitterness with a citrusy edge. Lacking carbonation with a syrupy edge that i'm not too fond of. Leaves bitter chocolate lingering with sone slight soured tartness. Not harsh,just not real pleasurable. Not a beer that i would drink again,but not repulsive either. Kind of boring,had a hard time finishing the entire bottle,the first half went down twice as easy as the last half."
"D. A full bodied as hell, flavorful and robust ale. Not reccommended for anything other than a dessert beer/night cap. Worthy of a purchase."
"Pours a clear dark ruby red/brown, thin light tan head forms, quickly settles down to a thin ring, some lace spots form on the glass, looks good. Smell is neat, very fruity, caramel, chocolate, lactose, oak, light roast, strawberries, all over the place in a good way, nice complexity, very malty stuff. Taste is nice, caramel up front, thick and malty, chocolate roast, fruit, very milky, kind of a mix between a stout and strong ale or doppelbock, wood comes through in the finish with a touch of alcohol, goes down a bit weak on flavour but is quite enjoyable. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with medium carbonation, assertive, alcohol warmth, nice stuff. Thanks Russ!"
"drinkability is good. the warming alcohol is the only real detractor to the drinkability - and even that seems to fade by mid-glass. great balance otherwise, with no real alcoholic taste noticeable. as i said above, the barrel character is pretty excellent in this one - complimentary without trying to steal the show. a great beer that i've considered buying so many times before, and now that i have i'm sure it'll be a regular purchase."
"This beer is very smooth to drink and has excellent taste. The oak aging adds to its simple yet delightful taste. I would drink another rather easily."
"Pours a dark brown with no head and no lacing. A little red hue around the edges. Roasted malts and some oak coming through in the nose. More of the same in the taste, but the effects of the barrel aging really round out this beer well. I didn't get as much of the bourbon in the draft version as I have previously from the bottle. A very easy and smooth drinking beer which is a problem given the 9% ABV. Very enjoyable."
"This beer pours a dark brown with a tan head and lacing. The smell is of bourboun and malts. The flavor is very nicely balanced between the bourbon, malt and hop flavors, I just wish there was a little more of each. Very deceptive, because I would have never imagined this to have been a 9% beer. The mouthfeel was nice and creamy with a nice carbonation level. This is one of the most drinkable 9% beers I have ever had, it went down very easy, and I was wishing I had some more :)"
"Despite the 8.5% ABV listed on label, the beer drinks bigger due to its almost cloying taste and the noticeable alcohol character. I didn't especially enjoy this one and let the fellow sitting at the bar with me have more of the bottle."
"D - For the ABV listed (9%) this is one of the easiest drinking beers. I could definately had another butcould not and drive home."
"Picked up at Green's in Greenville, South Carolina, as it is not available in Georgia, Dragon's Milk poured out dark brown, and formed a khaki colored head. The smell was a nice mixture of herbal hops and sweet chocolate and toffee. The taste was an extension of the smell with sweet malts being showcased with a backing of hops. The beer was carbonated nicely, and gave a creamy textured feel in the mouth. The finish was quite sweet and would have benefited a bit from more alcoholic strength. Very easy to drink, and quite flavorful, I definately see myself picking up more of this when it becomes more readily available."
"This poured much darker than expected, at a nearly opaque dark ruby with almost no head. It smelled very similar to a scotch with strong oak and leather notes, rich caramel malt, and a bit of smoke and alcohol. It tasted like aged and refined oak, light smokey leather, earthy barley and rich caramel malt, along with a bit of vanilla and sour cherry hops. It was somewhat thick with no carbonation, and had a lasting fairly sweet aftertaste. Overall this was one of the most distinguished tasting beers, and definitely one of the best oaked beers I've had. It had an intricate and delicious flavor, that was very clean and drinkable, with good body. I love everything about this beer."
"D- i'm having a hard time figuring out exactly what is goin on with this brew. so dark but with a surprisingly light body (or medium, i should say). i could assume that alot of the color comes from the char inside the oak barrels, but i can't be certain and i can't find any hints online to determine a conclusion. all other things aside, it leaves me wanting more. its smooth character and laid back flavor leave the door wide open."
"D= This is not a bad beer, it just isn't as good as I wanted it to be. An unusual ""near miss"" from a great brewery."
"22 ouncer, new graphics, i didn't see vintage/freshness dating, pours dark, dark mahogany, initially shows a dark mocha head, recedes down to a splotchy film and leaves lightish slippery lace. Nose is of dark bread, licorish and some background woodyness. Notes of rum, dark fruit, figs and raisins, more dark wood, molasses, and an underlying layer of wood. Nice sipper, bold and flavorful. More high test Michigan brew."
"In the mouth there is subtle carbonation and a very full bodied flavor that is alcohol warm but still smooth. Not a high drinkability rating--this beer will smack you."
"Overall I was very impressed with this. Judging by the previous reviews I was expecting something lackluster, but this one is a real winner. Highly recommended."
"Dragon's Milk is a pretty good beer. Yeah, the nose is too weak and the body a little too thin. Those are my main complaints. But, I enjoyed this beer more than I thought I would after the first sip. It's unique in its flavor, body, and feel. It's certainly worth a try if you run across a bottle."
"Thanks to ThirstyBird for the opportunity to try this one. Served in my Maudite tulip. Poured opaque black with virtually no head other than a tan skim and a frothy band around the shoulders. Some lacing, but virtually no adherence. Nose was sweet and malty; chocolate, alcohol and the ligthest trace of wood. Taste consistent with nose; however, some vanilla is also revealed, as well as a mild coffee character. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied with very little carbonation. Extremely smooth and creamy; not at all viscous. Alcohol is very well-hidden. A nice alternative to an RIS in that it's packed with flavor, but lighter in body. Would make a wonderful dessert beer."
"Nose was espresso, some chocolate and caramel, probably from the caramel malt I tasted in this. Some slight hints of choclate, vanilla and bourbon maybe. The oak taste was a little lighter than I expected. It was very drinkable."
"Nice, a damn solid brew from NH."
"Taste is not as promising as the nose delviered. A bit of a wine like sour. The oak kind of adds to the wine like flavor. The oak is a bit spicy and a little to dominant in my opinion. There is a bit of cocoa and a dry fruitiness. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy although a little thin."
"D - A little strong for multiple glasses, and slightly unbalanced. Decent strong ale, but would've probably worked better with a few adjustments as an imperial or American double stout."
"Excellent stuff, yet another fine product from New Holland that I'd strongly recommend."
"Overall: pretty tasty, and something I'd gladly drink again, but not terribly complex, and a little pricey for what it delivers."
"This one sits in a category of its own. It's not quite like a porter but it draws similarities. It's a well rounded beer and very drinkable. Recommended."
"I had this before I flew out of VA and I am glad I did it turned into a long flight. I finished the bomber by myself and was looking for more it's a good brew"
"Received a midnight black brew with little head (don't know if beer or bartender) but left some spider lacings as I drank. Some wood and sweet malts came through in the smell, plus some coffee malts. A little thick and syrupy with the body, the beer contained a good oak taste with some sweetness and a little coffee malt, among other malts. The oak kind of took over and this is a good beer, but not a standout beer. ABV hidden pretty good as there is a smoothness riding through this beer, including the backbite. I'd have it again but I'm not going out of my way to seek it."
"Tasted on 6/25/08."
"Bottle. Poured a dark, purplish brown color with a nice brown head and strong lacing. Aroma was very pleasant, with a nice blend of roasted malts and oak. Mouthfeel was okay. Flavor wasn't as bold as I had expected, especially for the ABV. Hints of chocolate, oak, alcohol, toffee, and coffee. This was a nice big offering from New Holland."
"Dark reddish color with a thin, creamy tan head that's gone before the end of the glass. Dark, sticky, malty aromas...vanilla, toffee, and chocolate cake. Lots of sweet dark flavor. Brown sugar, chocolate, syrup...everything sweet. Oakiness. Full body, smooth and heavy feeling. One glass is enough for me. Good with dessert maybe."
"Poured a dark brown almost black with very little head. Moderate lacing clings to the 20oz. glass. The smell is very sweet. There is a definite scent of cocoa and coffee present. The 1st sip is very chocolaty. The oak presents itself very nicely by mid glass and finishes with a nice alcohol warmth. This was my first experience with New Holland but was not disappointed. I wasn't sure what to expect from either the brewery or the beer, but based on this, I'll be looking more closely at the line."
"D- 8.5% is well hidden, not bad. I found it similar to 1554."
"M + D: Full bodied, not reall quite creamy... just a bit heavy feeling. A bit intense, so it should be taken easy. I might prefer it to have some more subtle oak flavours or more complexity, but it still ends up a decent brew. Worth a try."
"Look forward to having this one again."
"I was impressed with this beer. The oak aging was done well and added a great character. I've had other oak-aged beers that were either overpowered by the oak or were not perceptibly changed by the aging. Neither was the case with this beer. This is a very good beer to have once in a while as an after dinner treat. Recommended."
"D - The alcohol is hidden on this one."
"My hopes and expectations for this beer were high, and not met. Ho-hum. Next."
"Not bad, but a little heavy for a anytime but during dessert beer."
"Overall, after smelling the bourbon/oak aromas, I was afraid they would ambush the flavor. This was certainly not the case. This beer was amazing. The flavors were complex yet gentle. It made for an incredible beer."
"I don't regret the $9 a paid for the bottle, but this definitely isn't going to make my regular drinking rotation."
"black with dark brown and blood red highlights. tan head is very small and fades quickly leaving minimal lace. nose and taste... pretty well balanced mix of wood, a hint of smoke, vanilla, a little dark fruit, and some herby root beeryness like sassafrass or sasparilla. medium full body with a slight boozy warming finish that is welcome in an ale of this sort. i thought it went nicely with some sausages and burgers on the grill, so i ranked it very high in the drinkability category. decent beer."
"Way too much emphasis on the oak in this beer, I have two more bottles that will be cellared in the hopes of knocking some of the green off the ale. Definitely oak aging gone extreme, but with less than stellar results."
"D: Wow! Such an amazing beer, with a great mouthfeel. This is a beer anyone should try, especially if you enjoy barrel-aged beers. I really enjoyed this brew at noon after just waking up."
"D: This is a drinkable beer. It's a little on the heavy side, but it has a solid taste and a goes down easy."
"D: This beer grew on me. It is light enough to last long into the night but the high ABV would catch up with me and cause an early end to the night. My respect for Holland, MI was reestablished by this nice solid brew."
"This poured a very dark with a minimal head. It smelled delicious, with vanilla, caramel, and cocoa scents coming through. Dragon's Milk tasted as delicious as it smelled. It started out with a vanilla and dark chocolate. The aftertaste consisted of the burnt oak that was advertised, with a hint of bourbon. All in all, this was delicious. It was sweeter than I was expecting and all of the flavors mixed very well to create a very enjoyable tasting experience, however it is not one that I can drink in large quantities."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer pours thinner than I had expected and looked like new motor oil but appears a deep brown in the glass with a thin, yet firm looking head that leaves nice gobs of lacing all over my glass. The smell is nice; a complex boquet of dark fruits, oak, chocolate, vanilla, brown sugar and only a hint of sweet alcohol. The taste is very similar to the nose, with all of the flavors melding quite nicely and a warm alcohol bite at the end. The mouthfeel is on the light side for what I had expected and the beer could use just a tad more carbonation. Drinkability is relatively good, a sipper not a quaffer."
"I feel another bottle may be necessary to cement my overall opinion about this brew. I will definitely try again, may also buy one to see how it does in the cellar."
"Drinkability on this one is pretty high. 8.5% isn't too outrageous and nothing about this beer makes me think I wouldn't want to have another as soon as I'm finished with this one."
"This is true. This is no American Strong Ale, but I have seen it listed as some type of English Strong Ale. Anyway, it is some type of Imperial Stout in my estimation. Nonetheless, this is an outstanding beer. Scents of deep chocolate, cherries, robust coffee shine through. Tastes similar, very light and unique. Heavy ABV not well detected. An a great looking opaque beer. I did not see a large foamy head, but it still is worth pouring and looking at. A nice well rounded nightcap, brew!"
"Drink: Too sweet for my taste.... still a solid Amercan Stout.... certainly NOT an american Strong Ale!"
"D - Outstanding! This is a killer beer! I love the name, the high ABV is nice, and the flavors are damn tasty."
"Because of it's smoothness, I find it quite drinkable.. a very nice American Strong Ale indeed. I'd drink it again."
"Drinkability is good for the style & ABV, but you feel this baby warming you from the get-go! One best consumed on a cold night by the fire. versus the (finally) warm spring evening grilling steaks I chose. A solid American Imp Stout"
"Pours dark color almost that of a stout or porter with little or no head. Aroma is very mild in this one. You do get a hint of vanilla almost a malty vanilla really. First sip you get the light taste of carmal malt and vanilla in there. The after taste is really when the oak really comes through. This is a well balanced beer but I""ll have to be honest. When I see the color or read oak aged, I expected something more out of it. Don't let the taste foll you it is a a well balanced beer that can be enjoyed by many."
"Sorry guys.. wish I had more.. again, taken from a paper notepad. Thanks, Steve."
"Opinion: This is a really tasty beer, and is really reasonably priced at $7 for a bomber of such a complex beer. I like the mouthfeel especially on this beer as it coats your palate with a pleasing flavor and texture that lingers until the alcohol comes and cooks it away. I would definitely drink this beer again."
"Drinkability: Good beer, but could be improved a little. Quite smooth though, and easy to drink. Worth a try."
"Drinkability is moderate. Easy to consume, but flavor is lacking."
"Drinkability- This brew is a rollercoaster. It looks horrible, smells pretty weak, tastes damn good and feels as horrible as it looks. I guess what really matters is how a beer tastes and this one is tasty. As a beer to review, this one looks bad on paper. BUT, if I was just sitting watching football or something this is a tasty barrel aged brew."
"I've never had a beer like this before. When I say it's unique, I truly mean it is a one of a kind. This is the type of beer that beer lovers hope to find, and then are disappointed, when after sampling it, they can't find it anymore. It is a bit pricey at $6.99 a bottle, but well worth the price. If you ever get a chance to sample one, you'd be a fool to pass it up. There are only a handful of beers that I've had the pleasure of tasting that goes into my, ""Special guest"" category, but this is one of them. If I know I'm going to have an avid beer drinker over, I'll make sure to have a couple of bottles of this fine elixir in the house. This would be the 30-year single malt of beers."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is heavy and smooth, nice and chewy. This is classified as an American Strong Ale but I find the texture and mouthfeel closer to a good Milk Stout. The only criticism that I really have on this is that the carbonation was practically non-existent. A few bubbles would have been great. That aside, the drinkability is still good and I very much enjoyed it. Recommended."
"Had never even heard of this brewery let alone this beer, always excited to try a barrel aged beer though, nice surprise and a generous addition to my package, would drink again, recommended to anybody that has not tried it as well"
"This is an enjoyable sipping beer. I just finished it sitting out on my deck on the first Spring-like day."
"Eric"
"~Jonathan Passow"
"Very dark. Pours with a nice tan head and leaves an eye of lace. Smells and tastes of vanilla and chocolate. Nice and creamy, heavy in the mouth. I wasn't sure what to expect when I purchased this, but I'm glad I did. I'd definately drink this again."
"I poured about half of the 22 oz. ""bomber"" into my trusty tasting snifter. It poured with little head, which quickly vanished. The color was a clear, dark brown....not opaque like a stout. The smell was full of dark roasted malts and chocolates. The taste was a mixture of the same. This beer boasts a 9% ABV, but does an awesome job of hiding it. Another classic example of what the addition of wood to beer can do. The oak aging imparts a nice dryness in the finished products with hints of vanilla and other subtle flavors. Definitely worth a try."
"Pours a dark brown, slightly translucent color with a bit of ruby highlights. Plenty of big bubbled tan head and decent tracing. The aroma is a rush of bourbon, oak, vanilla, finishing with high alcohol laced chocolate and roasted malts. It is quite complex, but I don't know if I'm totally hung on it. I love bourbon and I love oak flavor, but I don't know if both necessarily need to be in beer. On the palate, it is vaguely familiar of their wheatwine I sampled nearly a year ago. Underneath all the wood, I picture a medium bodied stout, relatively smooth, but not as smooth as a cream stout should be. It finishes like a bourbon and coke with the light caramel and spices dancing with the oak. The oak brings quite a bit of body but the stout itself is lacking, it needs more of a roasted character and perhaps more lactose. Overall, and interesting brew definitely, but not up there with brews like OA Yeti."
"Props to Joe1510 for hooking up an east-coaster...Proper!"
"Cheers"
"i had this on draft at the nachbar last week and it was awesome. it tastes, looks, and feels far superior on draft than from the bottle. the beer is dark as hell but masks the alcohol pretty well. it has some chocolate/coffe scents, and a bit of a taste, but not too much. $5 pints are some good news, man."
"Not a bad beer. This one is definitely a sipper. Thick and creamy on mouthfeel. Alcoholic in taste, aroma, mouthfeel, etc. A bit much for me. I would easily share 22oz with two other people, leaving 9oz, plenty enough, for three people."
"D: Okay. Enjoyable, but high ABV, and it's noticeable."
"I would recommend this beer. I've previously had it on tap at Roman's Pub (St. Francis, WI), I bought a bottle from Gary's (Oak Creek), and I had it most recently at Comet."
"Medium full body with medium low carbonation makes for a very nice creamy rich mouthfeel which is perfectly appropriate for this beer. Beautiful. Somehow evades getting too cloying and heavy. I really don't want to set this one down. Rich, rewarding, delicious."
"It's nice to find a high quality barrel aged beer that's, although a seasonal, readily available and doesn't cost an arm and a leg to acquire. Keep pumping out the Dragon's Milk New Holland."
"Pours very dark brown with almost no head. No lacing either. The aromas are a heady mix of bourbon, light malt, oak, and cream. Doesn't smell rich, more like a bourbon and cream. The malty notes are subdued. Lots of flavor, but a little thin in the mouthfeel department. Could use a little more backbone. The flavors themselves are very nice, though with some chocolate up front followed by a hit of bourbon and brandy, a long warming development of alcohol, and finally some malted milk on the finish. Quite a nice sipper and doesn't fill you up as much as Bourbon County Stout, but doesn't satisy as much either. If you don't like Bourrbon flavors stay away from this one. If you do, you'll probably enjoy it as I did."
"D- A definite sipper, but not so overpowering that you can't drink more than one."
"D: I wish that I had picked up a bottle or two more of this brew, the flavors are full and the oak aging adds a wonderful blast of flavor."
"You certainly need to be in the mood for one of these. My last experience with a similar beer lead to a day of upset stomach. Not a bad offering but I would certainly not seek it out since the style is not my cup of tea but would recommend to anyone into this style."
"Dark in color with massive head and tons of lacing. Riverside had just cracked a new keg and it was beautiful. Aroma is of sweet barley with hints of oak. Tastes like sweet toasted mocha with very little hop presence. It seems more like a barley wine than a strong ale. Feels thick and rich in the mouth and has just the right carbonation. Overall a very drinkable beer. Complex and enjoyable. If you can find it on tap try it."
"Easy to drink without a doubt but it lacks so zip I think. Tasty but it needs more complexity besides the vanilla and wood."
"The bottom line: For the most part I'm not a fan of New Holland's brews, but Dragon's Milk is a nice strong ale product, actually more stouty in flavour, with a solid cask flavour to balance it out. Certainly one of the stand-outs in their portfolio."
"Almost opaque, a small amount of red hued rays make it through this dark brown beverage. A very thin light tan head fades rapidly. Little lacing generated. The faint chocolate, caramel aroma and vanilla notes of alcohol really open up as it warms. Ever so lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is medium bodied yet singular. The alcohol is warming and presents a tingle upon the swallowing breadth. Somewhat less flavor than suggested by the nose, light malty caramel taste is complemented by the barrel aged flavors. A reasonable drinker at 9% ABV."
"Overall, a pleasant find and a surprisingly good. LIkely will pick this one up again."
"D: This is a pretty good strong ale - if I could get it up here, I would likely buy it from time to time. Definitely worth a try though."
"Juicy, tart and smooth on the palate. The carbonation is moderate which lightens up the finish a bit. I prefer this beer from the bottle once its sat for a while. On-tap its good, but a bit thinner and somewhat less satisfying. A very good choice none-the-less."
"Ok, so this one I actually had been looking for the longest time for, only to just now realize that we can get this in SC. I was shocked and very happy so you know I had to immediately pick some up. This is exactly what I did. Poured a nice deep orange brown, pretty translucent, and to be honest did not look too thick. A small off white head formed on the top but quickly evaporated and left behind only a token amount of lace, almost none of what was on the sides of the glass. Some carbonation was visible. The smell was interesting, definitely could detect a touch of wood ageing in here, the aroma of brandy not withheld, some caramel sweetness and a touch of grain in the back. The taste was interesting again, almost had like a Cola taste to it, especially in the finish. Lots of oak tastes and a hint of brandy like. The carbonation was rather decent and it drank a lot lighter then I thought it would. It was a tad hot and would probably benefit from laying down a little. Overall this was pretty decent of a night time sipper, though I was able to drink it a bit faster then that. It was nothing outstanding, but still pretty nice if you are a fan of the barrel aged beers. This was definitely detectable and overall probably a pretty fair representation of a barrel aged brew. Worth a try definitely."
"Pours very dark brown, with a rich two finger head. Nose is of licorice and wood. Taste- bourbon flavour is quite pronounced, along with the oak. Quite hoppy as well. Sweet iniitially, but that melds into more of a hotness from the booze. Finish is dry and woody. Interesting beer. Carbonation is on the low end."
"I've read the other reviews for this brew and I think that they are being a little unfair. Sure the drinkability is low for many, but it is an interesting tasting, smelling, feeling, and looking brew and I don't think people are reviewing due to style. There are a lot of mediocre milk stouts out there, and this one is far from ordinary."
"Despite all the downfalls, this beer is still drinkable and I am glad I got a chance to try it, just won't seek it out in the future"
"It's no one trick pony, but the lactic sourness is prominent to the point of distraction. The shame is, underneath lies a pretty decent malt profile. Strangely, the muscular ABV helps mitigate the sourness in the end, and it drinks at least better than average. So maybe it's not my cup of tea, or milk for that matter, but hey, I can say I could have done worse."
"As with the smell the flavor charactor changes as it warms. Starts off with a heavy dose of chocolate malt and coffee. As it warms the alcohol becomes more prevalent but doesn't dominate. That is when the vanilla shines. It has a heavy, smooth feel to it and with the light carbonation it makes a great combination. This is a sipper but more approachable than a barleywine."
"Got this one on-tap at Ashleys in Ann Arbor after passing it up a number of times in beer spots around town. A tasty one, if not exactly incredible. Poured a darkish brown with some reddish highlights. Nose is strong on molasses and coffee. Taste is fairly similar, with a good dose of dried fruit tossed in. Coffee and chocolate play a surprisingly big part. Fairly smooth alcohol, especially for 9%. Feel is good with good carbonation. This one was pretty good, I'd definitely have it again."
"Tried a half-pint of this on tap. My first experience was good, but not what I expected. This time around I knew what to expect. This beer strikes me as a good Scottish Ale and not a Strong Ale. Pours pretty dark with ruby edges. Smells and tastes more on the malty side: lightly-roasted coffee, touch of caramel, carbon, smoky, hints of raisins. Some residual hops. Fairly smooth mouthfeel; not super milky, but like a skim milk. Complemented by a touch of fizz, especially on the front of the tongue. A very drinkable beer. More refreshing when it's slightly chilled. As it warmed (which is inevitable, I guess) the coffee and smokiness gets a little too dominant. Still, I would gladly reach for this one again."
"D - I would buy this again, I would like it better if it came in a 12oz bottle as 22oz is a lot to drink by yourself. I was sharing with friends, getting them exposed, so I didn't have to drink it all."
"Bottle: Poured a deep brown with some burgundy color ale with a nice light brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with some bourbon notes is well balance. Taste is also comprised of a nice balance between some sweet malt with some dry fruits elements as well as some bourbon with nice vanilla notes. Body is about average with some medium carbonation and no alcohol is apparent. I like how the bourbon is present but does not dominate or brings too much alcohol. A very interesting and different beer that leaves wanting to try more from this brewer."
"Drinkability: A great beer, one that I would drink in limited quanities. Serving up at around 9% and my bottle came in at 1 pint and 6 ounces. I great beer to hit at a fine pub."
"I will be purchasing bottles to store."
"D- Alcohol cannot be detected in this brew. Its high and will hit hard. This is one to enjoy perhaps as a dessert beer because it is pretty heavy. I liked this one and will have it again."
"D- pretty solid,"
"Great beer to follow up with some bourbon you've already had. Smooth, can't even notice the 9% abv thats even in it! However a bit pricey, but hey its quality beer!"
"D - I would like one of these a every week or so in the winter. Awesome beer."
"Pours quite dark. Looks very much like a good porter or stout with a glance at that dark color & head. The smell likewise gives that impression. Chocolate-dark caramel-vanilla-toast. The taste echoes, although I would strongly suggest giving things a moment to warm slightly and open up. My initial impression with the beer somewhat cold was that this beer was thin & bland. The bourbon-oak is hidden for the most part, giving a background flavor at most. But for my taste, that's fine ... I don't like some of these bourbon/oak-aged things that are more akin to drinking a mixed bourbon-beer boilermaker. Overall, I was quite fond of the beer. I thought it'd make a pleasant ""sipper", not too heavy & alcohol disguised well, that is, if it weren't for the high price/bottle."
"Drinkability is okay. For 9% it is hidden away well, but the lack of flavor and weak mouthfeel don't do it for me."
"This is a good after dinner brew, but is almost too sweet with no hops character too it. It has a mild smokiness to it to counter the sweetness a bit, but not very balanced in any way."
"D: This is a nice strong ale, but the oak barrel flavors were a bit over the top. I will age another offering for some time before I sample this one again. Recommended."
"D - Better than I expected. The smoothness was surprising. Though you can taste the strong alcohol, it is not overbearing. Very nice."
"Drinkability: A good sipping beer; very complex. I wish I had a 12oz bottle and not a bomber. Not sure if it is available int he smaller sizes, but a bomber is a bit much for this hig ABV."
"D- I don't know if I was drinking this at the wrong time, not in the mood, or not eating a complimentary food to go with this drink. I had to struggle to finish this beer. Did not seem to get better with increasing sips, in my opinion."
"Drinkability is OK. I think that a 12oz serving would be better than a bomber, but that is what I think about most beers. Unless I really like a beer, 22oz is simply too much of one beer. Not bad, overall, but just, meh. I'll take Pilgim's Dole over this anyday."
"I have a feeling that the less favorable reviews of this beer, like this one, are of older bottles. The good reviews are probably fresh bottles. That, or this beer just isn't that good?"
"D - Better the first time I had it. Not terrible, but just not a great offering. Probably won't be revisiting this one at the price point."
"This beer pours a dark ruby color with a creamy white head that is seated on top. The nose is full of dark malts, chocolate, vanilla, oak and bourbon. The taste comes in with the same notes ion the aroma with a little more accents on the chocolate and the malts. However, it tastes a little oxidized sadly enough. It's a wonderfully creamy body that leaves a wonderful finish that lingers suggesting to take another drink."
"Pour into a chalice a nice clear dark ruby color, nice carbonation, huge creamy tan head which lasts forever, tons of lacing throughout the drink. The nose is of nice sweet/oaked malts, some dark fruits (plums, figs), slight vanilla, and caramel. The taste is very nice of sweet malts, vanilla, oak, plums, and caramel. Medium body, highly carbonated feel, well rounded complex brew. Very drinkable, I'm really enjoying this one, thanks again Dan. Highly recommended."
"D: Unbelievably easy to sip your way through a bomber of this. Very enjoyable."
"A nice offering, and I will have more of this."
"Overall: I had high hopes for this brew and it failed to deliver. Don't know if i had a bad bottle or what but i wasn't impressed with the mouthfeel or taste. Not a horrible beer but not a good one either."
"Recommended."
"I wish this were available in Nebraska... I'd buy it quite a bit."
"It was okay, but I was hoping for a something a little better."
"22 oz. bottle, 9% ABV. Almost jet black in color, with a thick tan frothy head. The head trickles to a thin layer rather quickly. Vanilla, oak, whiskey and a bit of coffee in the nose. Very smooth, slick, and almost silky. My first impression was that it had a great deal of sweetness, like sweet cream. Vanilla flavor, with just a hint of whiskey. Almost no roasty tones at all, which seemed odd looking at the color. Body seems a bit light, but the lower carbonation works for me. Very smooth, alcohol seems non-existant. Almost too drinakble. The barrel flavor here is done very well, not overwhelming, simply adding a nice layer of flavor. This is outstanding."
"D- I really regretted getting this. I feel like I could appreciate a beer that is barrel aged, this was just way overbearing and it was not ""milky"" in any sense of the word."
"Picked up a bomber this weekend and boy I wish I would have bought more. Poured a dark brown hue with a caramel light shining through it, not much of a head nor any lacing, but so what. The aroma and flavor makes up for it. Lovely scent of caramel, dark chocolate, vanilla with a powerful hint of soy sauce. Medium body, creamy with a fizzy carbonation to start, ending chocolate sweet and soft with a undertone of alcohol. Overall, I really enjoy this brew and will purchase more this weekend."
"This is a great beer to sip and as it warms me up inside I am looking forward to pouring the rest of the bomber. Recommended!"
"The beer is a nice deep black with a hint of light permeating the edges. A tan head sits atop the brew. There are coffee and chocolate flavors as well as the oak coming through. Malts abound in this beer. the alcohol shows a little as it warms. Drinkable, but take it slow. This is one dragon that bites."
"Thanks to Enola for sharing a bottle."
"Into a tulip glass out of a bomber, this brew pours out nearly black, with a little ""dark ruby"" around the edges. Nice thick head. Quite a nice looking brew. Being only accustomed to stouts pouring out that black, the smell and taste were unexpected, but good - sweet, strong notes of fruit, especially prunes, raisins, and grape juice, along with some alcohol. Only a gentle bitter finish. In the mouth it was fabulous - creamy and smooth, with a small presence of carbonation. It was surprisingly easy to put down, too. Overall, this was a good, interesting beer."
"This is my first beer from New Holland, and I am very impressed. I now wish that this was a regulalry seen item around VA. Either way, I'd recommend this beer, and would buy it constantly in the winter, given the ability to do so. Thanks again DeeJayDan!!! This one is a winner!"
"i will say that this beer before the barrel might not have been so good"
"The woods make this one unlike any other brew I've tried."
"9%? I could definately down a growler of this. This is a pretty cool beer, kind of like an American old ale. Big caramel and chocolate (reminds me of carafa malts) flavors. I get more chocolate in the aroma with a hint of oak. There are also some mroe subtle flavor floating around like vanilla, but this isn't the most comples beer. Still, it's very drinkable and I'd get it again."
"This stout is one of the most celebrated bourbon-flavored stouts that does not confess bourbon barrel aging, but merely oak aging. How dey do dat?"
"Pours cola in color with a small off white head. Aroma is bourbon, cola sweetness, vanilla, and a smoky roastiness. First taste shows a nice roasted malt flavor that is quickly followed up by a cola sweetness and a bourbony finish. Some syrupy sweetness is cut by a tangy acidity. A nice oak and bourbon drying finish. The alcohol is very well balanced and the bourbon flavor and aroma comes thru nicely. The roasted smoky malts are also a nice dimension to this beer. The vanilla in the aroma and the cola-y sweetness in the aroma and taste were perhaps a bit strong for myself, but still a complex interesting beer."
"This beer pours a dark brown/black with a thin, off-white/light tan head that diminished to a small ring with a ""spider web"" in the middle. The smell is strong with notes of bourbon, oak (white?) and vanilla. The flavor is more bourbon, sweet malt and wood. The wood is a little strong and puts me off a bit. Further sips reveal some hot alcohol. Mouthfeel is heavy and creamy. I think the hot alcohol taste keeps this from being terribly drinkable. Truth be told, I'm glad I'm sharing the bomber. Perhaps it will mellow in time?"
"Drinkability: Interesting, but a bit subdued; I was expecting something bolder on all fronts; in any event, an enjoyable brew"
"Cheers!"
"An excellent strong ale I will likely purchase again."
"The body has a mid to full feel but the oak essence smooths the flavor out. A good, unique beer that boardlines style but put it in any category you want, I'll have another."
"Taste; those malts come through nicely with the caramel, chocolate and a little bit of toffee. The coconut mixes very nicely with the oak barrel flavors, and has a nice smooth vanilla on the finish. There's not much bitterness to be found in this one. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a moderate carbonation, and the drinkability is very high up there. Once this gets to room temp it gets even smoother and I think the mouthfeel becomes more full."
"Thanks again to shbobdb, who knows I love malty beers. Man, you hit this nail on the head!"
"Frighteningly drinkable old ale which goes down far too fast. I almost never see wood-aged beer of this style, nice to see it done in the US this well."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Exquisite... light and smooth on the tongue, swelling perfectly in the mouth. Effortless and ridiculously drinkable for the style, very highly recommended."
"D - now, this is a heavy beer--tons of malt and high gravity. if you take that into account, the drinkability isn't too bad. this is certainly for sipping. be patient; try to rush this one and it will get you."
"Very well executed. Reminds me of a Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale, but this is more complex and has a better feel. Glad to see New Holland brews coming into Kentucky and southern Indiana."
"Bottle. Pours a jet black with a 1/4 inch dark tan head that quickly dissipates. Excellent lacing on the glass as well. The aroma is sweet. Caramel, vanilla, oak from the barrel, chocolate malt, and just a hint of bourbon. The aroma is fairly subdued, and does not overwhelm you. The flavor is delicious. Plenty of flavors here. Chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, sweet fruits. A bit on the sweet side, but it does not linger long on the palate. A very warming beer. This is probably the best offering from New Holland I have tried."
"This is worth at least trying. It is very interesting and unusual. If you see it, DON'T pass it up. I've not had anything like it. I'm not sure I want more, but i am very glad I tried it."
"Deep brownish black body with a lovely huge monster tan foamy head that includes some huge hollow bubbles. Like what you get if you made a root beer float. nose is a soft chocolatey malt feel with a bit of smokieness on the side. Now this is where the brew goes south for me... Enters the mouth kide day old cold coffee and quickly sours on the second half of the palate, which is not what I expexted. Finishes with that same sour and maybe a hint of nuttiness. Where is the oak and I was expecting a little more dark richness, and complexity from the look in the glass and from what I had heard about this beer, but polar oppisites. Odd, but I guess I could have had a bad bottle.?"
"flavor leaving thing."
"Poured into a pint glass, a deep dark color with decent head, shrinking to a swirling, snarling film, very appropriate, and not so much lacing. Aroma is full of chocolate, a creamy, woody vanilla, some bourbon or something, a little on the subtle side but quite nice. Taste is not so subtle, a potent but well infused with lots of lively chocolate, some plum, hops being minimal, malty as a bastard, bourbon tweaking the edge of my mouth into a grin. really quite nice. Mouth is creamy, smooth, very warm, nice. Overall, I'm a fan. A fan who is glad he has more of it."
"This is a nice dark ale, with a decent light brown head. Looks almost like a coke while pouring. There is a strong smell of dark chocolate. The taste is much more interesting than the smell. Very nice. There is chocolate, raisins, some wine like flavors probably the oak. It is on the sweet side, with no hops obvious. The mouthfeel is good, very smooth and creamy. It goes down way too easy for a 9% beer!"
"The beer poured a deep black color with a slight tan head that disapated rather quickly. left behind was a good ring around the glass and some solid lacing down the sides. The aroma was a full toasted caramel smell, pleasing to the nose. The tasted was a nice toasted, malty bite up front with some very nice vanilla tones as well which made for a smooth mouth feel. With a medium body, this is still a pretty darn easy beer to drink because it is tastey and so smooth going down but yet it leaves a nice taste in the mouth."
"A definite must try."
"This brew pours a dark brown color. The head is small and recedes very quickly into a this ring around the glass, and leaves no lacing. The aroma is of chocolate with a hint of sourness, then some graham crackers. The taste is amazing. It is like drinking liquid chocolate with a nice sourness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is one of a kind. It is possibly the fullest bodied beer I have ever drank, and quite smooth too. Overall, this beer is pretty darn good."
"Flavor is sweet with a slight hop kicker towards the finish. Molasses and just a little bit of brown sugar. Got some fruit too but I cannot quite place it--possibly cherry or plums. Just some slight hops towards the finish which comes across as wintergreen. Medium to full body that thickens as the beer warmed. The head kind of gqave me a milk moustache."
"Drinkability - this is pretty good, in spite of my not liking the bourbon thing associated with the old ale idiom. This is a decent sipper, not really a session beer."
"D: Not so good. I think this bottle went bad. I'm not gonna finish it. Too bad, I was looking forward to this one."
"The light brown head dissapates quickly over the very dark brown with black highlighted body of the beer. Strong roasted smell wafts up, filling my nose, which doesn't leave over time drinking the beer. The taste has strong caramel notes, malty, with just enough hops and spice to balance the sweet taste. Hint of smoke flavor in it. I've had this beer resently at a festival, and it seemed there to be very young and the smoke/caramel/spice was out of balance, and had not been mellowed by the oak aging. The first time I tried it, my first impression was that it specifically lives up to it's name--it's what I would imagine dragon's milk to be--thick and a little smoke in it. An exceptional beer, even though I seem to be a little high compared to some of my fellow BAs, I drink this beer every chance I get. I'm rating the very excellent bottle I have tonight. I had the same sample at Michigan Brewers Guild as Derek, and it didn't match up to the bottle I had tonight in any way. However, the first sample I had of it at the Autumn Brew Review was spectacular in 2003. If there is a quality control issue as suggested by Malcontent, I hope NH can nail down the issue because the beer is well worth any effort to maintain it in the market. Looking at the review clicked in right after me, Westsidethreat did not drink the same beer I did at all. Too bad. It was great."
"D: Very good. This was one of my favourites at the fest."
"Reading other reviews of Dragon's Milk it appears as though there are problems with quality control. I count myself among the ones lucky enough to have secured a ""good"" bottle & as I am almost halfway through the bomber, I'm becoming more & more depressed when faced with the realization that this beverage will soon be at an end. Just an outstanding beer."
"D - This one went straight from Sam's fridge to my fridge. The earlier bottles I have had of this had more of a sour presence that has been replaced by a bourbon/vanilla/oaky char. One of the better balanced bourbon beers I have had (coming from a big bourbon fan). I am definitely going to look for more of this years release."
"Mouthfeel is medium/thin and lacking something in my opinion. I can drink this beer because it's nothing too offensive, but i don't know that i'd choose it over another strong ale - especially given that Arrogant Bastard (a much better brew even without the oak-aging) is three bucks cheaper than this offering. Final analysis: a notch above mediocre since i'm feeling generous."
"Drinkability: I know some of the reviews of this beer were bad, which means I got a good bottle of this. The one I had was at the peak of it's excellence. If most of the bottles were of this quality, I would defiantly buy again!!! They clearly backed up their words on the bottle!!! I can now understand why this is their Crown Jewel."
"In the bottle it was sharp, acidic, acrid and lambic-sour. Is this Brett? A drainpour. The only thing that seems consistant about Dragon's Milk is its unpredictability. I'm going to take my bottle back to the beer store and ask if I can have another one as a replacement. If that doesn't taste like the Dragon's Milk that I love, I won't be buying any more."
"Be careful with this beer, and if you get a sour tasting bottle, know that there are MUCH better ones out there."
"A small alcohol burn during the bottle  this brew could have used another 6 months of aging."
"The beer piles forth from the brown silk screened bottle a deep brown with a large creamy tan head that slowly fades to nothingness leaving a fine thick sheet of lace to cover the glass. Nose is a hodge-podge of aromas, vanilla, Oak, caramel, toasted malt, hops, very complex to say the least, start is slightly sweet with a tinge of tartness, grain profile decent, and the top light to middling in feel. Finish has a moderate acidity, the hops delightful with the Oak flavor lasting to the very dry end, also a bit of tummy warming from the 9 percent ABV, certainly a beer to age."
"My recommendation: Buy at your own risk."
"Creamy and coating, perfect carbonation and medium/full mouthfeel. Super easy drinking...like chocolate milk easy drinking."
"Pours a dark, near-black color with an impressive dark colored head. The smell is a nice, complex blend of sweet malt, slight roast and vanilla aromas. The taste, however, I just couldn't get into. It's sweet with a sour milk taste that was just too strong and funky for me. Interesting, but not pleasing in my mind. The sourness overcame the hints of vanilla and malt and just left me wincing. Mouthfeel was nice and smooth with good body. Overall, an interesting beer but just too sour tasting to be enjoyable."
"One bottle that i shared with friends at a tasting. Very dark for an ale...small brown head. smells like hickory smoke. Taste is smokey, maly, chocolatey. almost like a stong ale that almost became a stout by accident. I like this beer a lot and i'll try it again when i have the opportunity."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 3"" tan head over the almost opaque dark brown brew. Head slowly fades to a pile of froth, with lots of tan lacing. Aroma is dark sweet grains with a vanilla oaky thing going on, and some fruit notes as well. Taste starts with the smooth dark malts, segues into the tart fruits, and closes with gradual appearance of the oak/vanilla flavors, and light warmth lingers. Mouthfeel has so much going on, yet all balances out wonderfully, and drinkability is excellent for such a potent brew. Liked it before, still do."
"I found Dragon's milk to be a bit to complicated, but still very interesting flavors some might enjoy."
" The ABV kept me from from giving it higher drinkability points."
"I was well impressed with the beer's drinkability also, quite good for something that seems to heavy at first. Buy this if just for the incredible aroma."
"A very interesting brew, a nice change from the hoppy strong ales that I'm used to. Not something I'd drink every day, though. Recieved via trade with jpm30."
"There now if by complex they meant as sour as any Gueuze or Lambic I've ever had then they would be correct. I did get a faint hint of the oak in this beer and a little bit of vanilla but over all just tons and tons of sour flavor. To be honest it tasted like a batch of infected homebrew I once had. Now I wasn't going to slam this beer and I truly thought I got a bad bottle but after reading some of the other reviews apparently I'm not the only one the found this sour flavor. This beer is by no means an American Strong Ale it should be classified as a Flemish Imperial Stout if such a thing exists. Now for this beers credit it is interesting but just way to unbalanced I drank shared the bottle with three friends all of who enjoy craft brew including funky Belgians and the like and none of us found this brew appealing. Anyway I still like New Holland and next time I'm in the mid west I'll be picking up some of their black tulip."
"This beer came highly recommended. A dark brown color with hints of a red hue along the side of the glass. A substantial head formswith a beige color, that laces slowly down the glass.The scents are very nice some of the chocolate malt and some vanilla aromas are there, with a touch oak wood from the barrel. The taste is very surprising, immensely sour, mostly a fruity sourness with cherries and some lemon, there is some of the chocolate flavor at the end. In the mouth it was very carbonated, it was present from the beginning to the end of each taste. Drinkability, not so much the sourness makes it difficult to have several, but it is truely unique. I would recommend at least trying this beer once."
"D - as drinkable as dragon-fire soured milk, a little lower because of the sourness, but still damn good, i really like this"
"Drinkability: Aside from the initial difficulties, not a bad beer, I would like to try one chilled and see if that fixes this. Maybe I have a bad bottle, Im gonna read other posts after this and see how they describe this. I expected something richer and less bubbly. Oh jeez this beer is a hazard, it just foamed all over the place as I refilled, or attempted to refill my glass. gotta wipe down the keyboard. I have a hard time imagining this is what the brewer intended. tasted alright though."
"Overall, it was not as complex as I had expected. I liked the first sip, but the more I drank of it, the less I liked it. The alcoholic tart sourness started to become a bit overbearing. It kind of reminds me of liquid fruit cake."
"Drinkability is good, its different and unique one half Stout and half Flanders. Would like to have more to explore in depth but only have one thanks cretemixer."
"Brown in color with a filmy and glass coating light tan head. Complex & inviting nose with a variety of dimensions, wood (bourbon, soaked oak), malt (chocolate, roast) along with hints of rum cake and chocolate covered cherries. Creamy, bubbly feel on the palate. Flavors continue on, contributing what the aroma hinted at. Well extracted malts with hints of chocolate, vinous fruits, bourbon, maple and vanilla. A very good beer and oddly enough, this was strikingly similar to a rare beer I had at the Le Sois Bock in Paris this past summer called Warenghem Olde Breizh (which I am the only rater of). Their malt profiles were nearly identical and they were both aged in wood."
"Overall impression: Kind of interesting. This is what a wood-aged beer should be. It should accentuate not dominate the characteristics of the beer. That being said, without the wood aging, this would be a pretty one dimensional beer. The wood aging fatigues the palate pretty quickly. Worth a try."
"Poured night black with a head that grew like it was on steroids! I'm not kidding, this head would not quit. I have a 20 oz nonic but I could only get half of this into it without running the risk of having it tumble over the edge. Looks very tasty. I lower my head and take whiff ... white wine? Yep, I'm smelling white wine, a little vanilla and lots of citrusy acidic orange. Very strange. A taste treats me to an almost overpowering white wine taste coupled with vanilla, chocolate, and a very sour taste. Each time I sip I taste something else, a feeling that is very engaging. I'm not wild about the taste of this beer, but it is damned interesting, enough to give it a higher score than I might have just because it lends to serious ponderance. As interesting as it is, a second is not in order."
"Very dark brown with ruby highlights. Light brown head made up of fine bubbles - good retention and nice lacing. Lots of vanilla in the aroma. Also some oak and chocolate maltiness. Complex flavour with plenty of orange character and some chocolate maltiness. Some wood, mild roast and moderate bitterness. Slightly aggressive carbonation with a smooth, full body. Surprisingly well hidden alcohol makes this easy drinking, but it's still a sipping beer!"
"A sipper. Good amount of lace and deep chocolale brown. Thanks Dr. Jay. Carbonation on aggressive side. Taste: coriander, orange, like a grand cru with lots of nother complexity. On the edge of funky. Medium-full mouthfeel.Lots of lace.A bit of wood in the finsih, and vanilla aftertaste."
"overall, i probably wouldn't revisit the bottles but will seek this out on tap wherever it may roam."
"New Hollands crown jewel indeed. This ale shows a great deal of patience and vision in its creation. The oak-bourbon character is quite assertive at times, but by no means drowns out the complexities of the malt bill. I drank this around cellar temperature which really seemed to bring out its full character."
"Overall: The flavor is in constant battle over the aroma to ""overtake"" command of your senses. This is a ""beer"" brewed for the sole intent to make you enjoy the moment and forget about your worries and the world around you!"
"Pretty dark beer. Almost black. Thin and airy light brown head. Lace is decent. Aroma is of oak, tannins, whiskey and slight caramel. Flavor is dried fruits, wet cardboard, tartness and stale bread. This one is just not hitting the spot as I thought it would. Nothing seems just terribly ""off."" Maybe a little oxidized. Just really not that good. Bland. I don't even pick up any barrel properties."
"Notes: Very drinkable beer. The sourness will be a bit of a turnoff for those not expecting it. Bourbonish flavors weren't quite as strong as those you get from other bourbon type beers. Fairly drinkable once you're in the mindset for this sort of beer."
"I'm not a fan of tart or acidic beers, but Dragon's Milk is very complex, and unlike young Lambics. This beer has tartness blended with so many other flavors,that the tart palate adds to the complexity of this great. Two mugs up."
"Mouthfeel is silky and creamy with mild carbonation. Perhaps one of the silkiest beers I've ever had."
"Overall, drinkability was good on this one. I will be looking for this one again."
"This beer came a slightly murky dark brown with cherry red highlights and a thin off white head. Smells of oak, brandy, and other sour woody notes with undertones of chocolate and dark sour fruits. Tastes of an initial wild cherry and wonderfully tart plumb sourness with a big oak, citrus and lilac dryness. The malt base that ties all of these together is thin and sweet chocolate and vanilla with a nice wild and musky sour fruitiness. The 10% alcohol isnt detected on the nose or the taste at all. Fantastic and original flavor combinations here. If this isnt original, someone please tell me of more options that are this wonderful and well blended. The mouth feel is light with a tingly carbonation. Ill definitely track this one down again!"
"All and all a great brew. The roasted chocolate flavor is to die for. This starts to approach Goose Island's Bourbon County and 3Floydes Darklord my favorites in this style."
"So smooth, so easy drinking! Dangerous indeed, get ready for a nap! Easilly the best Old Ale I've had, a unique and tasty treat that I can't wait to get again!"
"Caramel, Vanilla, oak. Lather, rinse, repeat. Off dry finish. Teh bourbon flavour - the charred oak - becomes more pronounced as it warms. A slight warming of the throat. Full bodied, moderate carbonation. Left me wanting more."
"I love a wood aged beer! Dark carmel nearing brown in the glass. Minimal head. Erratic laceing throughout the glass. Rich carmel sweet smoky nose. Licorice, smoky malty flavor with the nice oak flavoring coming in at the end. Little to no hop presence. I like hops, but I with big woodsy flavor like this, I can let it pass. This is a very tasty beer, but probably couldn'y more than one or two in a sitting."
"The flavor is of caramel malts and bit of roast. It has a touch of oakiness and also vanilla and lactose. It is medium-full in body with a creamy mouthfeel. Easy drinking for its strength. I very nice brew. Thanks Paul."
"I've loved this beer on tap in the past and enjoyed several (too many) mugs of it at Crunchy's, but this year, the bourbon is overpowering. I've heard this year's new bombers are quite nice, so I look forward to reviewing that."
"Dark choclatey flavor with a hint of Bourbon. You can definitely taste the alcohol but, definitely not over powering. Leaves a nice malty aftertaste on the back of your tongue with a hint of something sweet. I am definitely enjoying this Stout and will get back to the store for more!"
"Drinkability is great on this fantastic beer."
"D- This beer has some good complexity in the malt bill and it has really blended with age (this was just released to the stores). The oak and bourbon really give nice depth to the beer and add more depth."
"This is one of the best beers I've had in recent times. Amazingly complex, definitely not ""over-done," and very deceivingly drinkable."
"Bought this in the new 22oz bomber. Poured out a mohogony black. formed a big pilowy head in my Pint. the smell was great, that of sweet rasins, coffee, milk and honey. The taste is awsome. Sweet chocolate, toffee, and espresso. It also has just the right carbonation with a small alcohol burn and a thin mouthfeel that lets you enjoy big gulps at a time. This is very easy to drink which always is most important in my book. I am now glad New Holland switch to a bomber style for this beer, I can easily put one down in one sitting."
"Dark walnut color with a medium beige head and nice lacing. The aroma has a light smoke character, along with sweet malt and hops. Medium-bodied with a nice oak undertone. There is a nice mixture of toasted malt, smoke, bourbon and muted hops. The finish is rather short and mildly sweet. Doesnt quite live up to the cool name, but enjoyable all the same."
"Drinkability: What style this beer is going for may be a mystery, but this is a good beer. I always enjoy oak aged offerings, and this one does not dissapoint."
"Drinkability: Very easy too drink, even at 9%. I could easily drink a few bombers in one sitting. My first brew aged in a oak barrel, what a great example. Highly recommended!!!"
"Dark brown in color with a light amber highlight and topped by a thin tan head. The nose is very fruit forward. Dates, figs, a little sherry with a light citrus finish. He taste has a lot of wine. I hesitate to label this as a port or sherry. Really more shiraz with black cherry, toffee, vanilla, a little peppery. Light bitterness on the finish, kind of a tangerine citrus. This really hides the alcohol well. Slick and smooth mouth feel. Decent drinkability."
"Pours a deep black with hints of ruby highlight at the edges under a finger of khaki head. I love the smell of a good bourbon barrel aged brew and this is no different - infectious, ephemeral woody alcohol over a bed of vanilla bean, lactose and bready yeast. Flavor is sublime, mellowed bourbon, oak, vanilla extract and toffee/caramel malt. Mouthfeel is thinner than I had expected, but made for easy drinking as did the well-hidden alcohol. A fantastic barrel-aged brew here, seek it out and you shall find nirvana."
"At 10% this brew is dangerously drinkable. Very smooth and unusual. Mouthfeel is a little light, but still intersting. This is a well worth a try. I'm sure I will have another."
"Very good."
"let it warm up a little and the flavor and aroma shines through."
"THE BLOODHOUND FACTOR: I didn't even want to share this beer. Benji got one taste and nearly decided to go for the bottle and finish it. Bloodhounds have exceptionally good taste, as exhibited here..."
"A good natured ale with plenty of punch and lots of rich vanilla flavor."
"Slàinte!"
"I enjoyed this beer a lot and would highly recommend it. Very drinkable."
"Edit: After having a fresher bottle from the late 2005 batch, I'm bumping the mouthfeel up from 4.0 to 5.0 and the smell from 4.0 to 4.5. Also the drinkability from 3.5 to 4.0. The caramel malt really comes out a lot more in this bottle and the smoothness is breathtaking. The fruit it much more subdued than in the aged bottle. There was also a significant vanilla undertone and a strong roasted malt flavor. Very interesting. It's almost like this is a completely different beer than the one I reviewed before."
"Interesting beer from NH. Thanks to walleye for the bottle."
"drinkability: pretty drinkable"
"Thanks dirtylou for the two bottles. This bottle has been in the cellar since June, and I think I am going to have to keep the other in there until then next year to see if there is any improvement. At this point, it is a strange, slightly offensive beer. I started at cellar temperature of 50 Fahrenheit and the beer definately got better as it became even warmer, almost to room temperature. The more I drank, the better it tasted."
"Very, very sophisticated. More in common with cabernet than beer. Although I'm not the biggest of wine fans, I do mean that as a compliment. The closest beer comparison I can make is JW Lees Prize Old Ale. Elegant and refined. Quite a sipper."
"I had two bottles of Dragon's Milk (thanks deejaydan) and decided to review the 2003 rather than the 2004 due to reports that an infection is threatening the well-being of the latter beer. No such worries with the '03, it has aged beautifully. This is one of New Holland's better offerings and is one that I'll be sure to look for on my semi-yearly trips back to Ohio."
"This beer is pretty drinkable, all things considering. There are many pluses but there a couple minuses. When I add them up, the pluses win. This is a good beer but it is nothing I would seek out or buy many of if I had the chance. I would like to try it again but because this beer was so surprising I might like it more now that I have been acclimated. I need to thank mentor for the bottle. It was a gift, what a great guy."
"Mouthfeel is somewhwat light...I was expecting a bit more body. Nice, fast paced carbonation. Seems a bit lacking to me. I'm glad I got to try it but it didn't grab me enough to come back for more."
"Thanks DonO for this one; I am glad I tried it, but it doesn't excite me."
"poured witha a deep dark ruby brown witha fluffy rocky light coffee colored head. has a vanillian woody aroma as it's cold...lots of vanilla oak. light amount of carbonation but a slick mouthfeel, velvety with an aged character well rounded to begin witha thin winey oxidized character. has a dry aftertaste witha lingering dry maltiness. complex and wonderful."
"This oak-aged olde ale might just be New Holland's best beer yet! Its dark mahogany body is capped by a frothy head of dark tan that holds exceptionally well and leaves clinging sheets of lace throughout the glass. The nose is rich with milk chocolate, caramel, vanilla, wood, a touch of vinous acidity, and mild bourbon. It's ultra-smooth, silky, and medium-bodied but not dextrinous across the palate. The flavor is rich and satiating with notes of a soft chocolate and caramel blend, sweet honey-glazed biscuits, lightly toasty malts, a cusp of dark-kilned and almost roasty malts, vanilla, subtle bourbon, and - oddly enough - some background hops. It's well balanced by a firm bitterness, and it finishes dry with more notes of bourbon, vanilla, wood, and lingering roastiness than it had in the mouth (...blocked by the sweet malts I guess). The alcohol is incredibly well-cloaked; and this one will sneak up on you! Brilliant!!!"
"Pours a deep deep brown with a one finger tight head that settles quicly leaving a nice sheet of lace behind,some nice caramel aromas along with some malted milk and some of the oak left behind very nice.Very lactic flavors for an old ale malted milk and deep woody flavors along with some chocolate with alate sourness wich I didnt care for much.A very flavorful big beer but not a fan of the sour finish."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Pours a ruby brown with a beige head that left lace along the edge of the glass. Aroma is a blend of coffee, rich toasted malt and oak. Flavor is similar, sweet, oaky, slightly tart, with a whiskey finish as it warms. The body is okay, not as big as I would have expected. Overall, this was a nice experience, but I found myself slightly disappointed (New Holland makes some of the best beers in the Midwest)."
"The taste was very soothing. The barrel aged ambiance enveloped the other flavours of chocolate and cream. This reminded me a bit of kalooey-n-cream with a smokey barrel flavour. I imagined some melting toffee candies floating in creamy chocolate coffee. This brew was perfect for going with some chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream at a birthday bash. Cripes, it tasted just about like that! Very nicely done. I think this was a cream stout though."
"Pours an inky black with some ruddy highlights and a frothy but short lived head. Smells of bitter roasted malts, sugary lactose sweetness, and some resinous oaky notes. Very malty, slightly burnt bitter flavor. Very complex; vanilla, raisiny sweetness, well hidden alcohol and a somewhat ashy aftertaste with some oaken sourness. This has a creamy full body with a semidry finish that puts me in mind of an Imperial Stout, save the raisiny sweetness."
"Nice, medium mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. The weird woodiness and high abv ruin the drinkability on this one."
"Dragon's Milk is a rich, fruity beer. The wooden barrel the beer aged in asserts itself as it warms. There is a good balance between sweet, bitter, and tangy elements. The high alcohol content is hidden very well, until you try to stand. New Holland is another fine Michigan brewery. Dragon's Milk is another beer to get you through a midwestern winter."
"All things considered, this is a perfect conversion beer for those that think Guinness is the lead dog of ""dark"" beers!"
"Just found this review written on an old piece of paper. Thanks to kmpitz2 for sharing this beer. I think the category is wrong. Should be a milk stout. Anyway. Pours a very dark color with a small head that dies off quickly and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma has a coffee and chocolate malt character, but there is also a slight sourness as well. The flavor is much the same. There are a lot of the chocolate and coffee notes, but there is also a lacto sweetness. It has a strange acidic bite that I don't care much for. It's still a great beer, but it could use a little less of the acidic bite."
"I almost rated this beer higher except for the extreme sweetness. It definately has a place as an after dinner beer but I couldn't drink it all the time."
"Very drinkable. Please make more beers like this New Holland!"
"Nice lacing, and I can't believe the head retention given the ABV of this beer. Pours dark brown, but there is a hint of dark amber/garnet if you hold it up to the light. Smells like freshly crushed chocolate malt, with a hint of the bourbon mixed in. Taste.. slightly astringant/woody tones overpower other flavors going on. There's just enough residual sweetness to keep drawing you back for more. It's surpisingly light and fluffy in the mouth. This is a beer that is a good winter warmer style of beer. Like when you just get done snowblowing the foot of snow that fell overnight, and it's 5 degrees outside."
"Reviewed from a 12oz bottle on 12/29/04. Pours from the bottle a not quite black color but a very dark brown. A decent sized small tan head forms leaving a few rings of lace around the glass. Wow the nose is quite strong and interesting full of a variety of scents. First thing that came to mind was an odd milk stout hybrid with a strong creaminess and chocolate nose. Also I believe there were hints of vanilla and it was a bit woody. Maybe some alcohol as well but with all the other elements it was hard to tell, either way this is on tasty smelling brew. Roasty malts and a woody oak taste hit you first. An interesting sweet creaminess is there as well making it a bit milk stout like. There is some notes of sweetness and alcohol as well. When drinking this I had no idea what style it was but Imperial Milk Stout kind of came to mind. Medium to full body that is creamy. Very interesting brew here, its kind of confusing to drink with so many tastes jumping out that dont add up to a usual style. Its done well though and is pretty good. Thanks for the sample TikkiGodxxx."
"Sweet aroma with lots chocolate, vanilla, and a bit of oak. Strongly carbonated with a touch of lacing as the thick head recedes to a thin film. Bittersweet and chocolately flavor followed by a bit of oak/bourbon taste. Very creamy, great mouthfeel. For a fairly strong beer it goes down easy. I wasn't expecting very much from this beer, and it has improved quite a bit in the months since I first tried it. I just wish I had a few saved in the cellar."
"This beer comes out of the bottle a very dark brown color with a small head that falls to lightly ring the beer. The nose is really nice, but ir reminds me more of a milk stout than an American Strong Ale. I still like it. There is a lot of marshmellowey, creamy tones in the nose. The flavor backs this up very well. Lots of lacto creamyness and actually some acid bite on the back of my tongue. There is lots of vanilla and hints of chocolate malt. I like it. The feel is a little too thin for the flavors I get. Dinkability is just okay. I can't do more than sip at it, but I do like it."
"First sip reveals a fairly thick body and very milky in flavor and texture. Smooth and silky with lots of chocolate on the flavor end. No hop presence I can detect in this overall very sweet beer. No hint of the 10 % abv on the mouth either. A rich smooth brew that I find very enjoyable. If you want hops dont look here."
"Pours a very,very deep chestnut color. It looks pitch black until you hold it up to the light. Nice head though its gone pretty quickly. Pleasant aroma- treacle like. Some very nice vanilla notes. Somewhat toasted and maltish. Malty and vinuous flavor. Absolutely no sense of 10%abv-very well hidden. Nice moderate body. Goes down easy-almost too easy for that matter. Another really good beer from New Holland. Again I will say if they could pull off their regular brews as well as their seasonals offerings I think they could really be up there with some of the other top micros."
"Pours out to a jet black in the glass with a moderate-sized head. Aroma is that of licorice and baking bread. The taste is good with a good dose of malt on the forefront giving way to an alcohol warming on the finish. The ABV isn't hidden, but its not meant to be. However, its not overhwelming either. Well-crafted. A beer to drink on a cold winter's night."
"Smell is gentle and creamy. Some chocolate and a hint of alcohol. Tastes chocolatey and coffee. Vanilla. Oak can be detected, as can an alcohol bite. Some tannin remains on my tongue, playing with the late fine carbonation that persists to form on my tastebuds. Initially, the chocolate is strong, but later sits on the fence between chocolate and hazelnut. The coffee rises later to a nice roasty flavor. The head has settled to a ring around the glass with some lacing stuck to the sides. Mouthfeel is thick. An enjoyable beer. I'll bet 10 years would allow other flavors to rise up to compete with the (presently) overbearing chocolate and coffee. I'll seek out another 4-pack to age, but not for consumption now."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a bit of reddish hues. Aromas of vanilla and smoke, with noticable alcohol sweetness. Vanilla and oaky tones control a mild palate. Again, the alcohol adds sweetness and some thickness. Dark, toasty malt, but not too strong. Coating mouthfeel, but with a mild, lingering finish. A pleasant beer, IMO. Oak and vanilla add a nice complexity to an otherwise ordinary brew. Still, worth a try."
"This almost reminds me of an Imperial Stout, but much too sweet, again not enough to balance it out."
"Right now, it settles for Showtime, but with some attention, it could blossom into full-blown, hardcore mouth porn."
"Creamy and well carbonated. This beer could benefit from a smoother feel with less interference from carbonation. Body is medium-full, but puts out quite a bit. One bottle is easily consumed. Tasty all the way, a bit grainy at times, but definately has it where it counts."
"Dark brown body wears a light off-white ring. Bold cakey smell in which youd have put a pinch too much salt. Original lactic chocolate maltiness, rather complex in the nose, hard to analyze and know what to do with it. Raw grainy dryness chases the potentially fatiguing sweetness. Somehow a powdery cocoa flavor lingers and evolves into a coffeeish highly roasty ending full of dark malts. Smooth round body with soft carbonation. Well contained oak flavors do not attenuate the flavors, not to speak of the totally dismissed alcohol. Worth seeking just because its so unique."
"12 ounce bottle. A very complex brew. More body would certainly enhance the beer and could make it truly world class."
"An enjoyable beer. I like the oak and vanilla over some other examples that can add overpowering bourbon flavor."
"Pours dark brown with mahogany highlights when held up to the light. Thick, rich dark tan head that recedes quickly. Smell was not as strong as expected. The nose was of dark-roasted malts, maybe a bit of vanilla, with a hint of alcohol. I think the beer was too cold for my first couple of sips... letting it warm a little brought out the flavors better. Taste was roasty malt, dark chocolate, with a little oak wood in the background. Occasional hints of bourbon and slight fruityness were present, also. Finish is smooth and dry, and the alcohol kind of sneaks up on you. Probably one of the more drinkable 10% ABV beers. Full bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. Very nice."
"Excellent."
"Appearance: Deep dark black hole appearance sucks up all colors and ounce of visible light with a frothy tan head leaves very nice thick lacing all around my pint. Aroma: Great herbal mix with an herbacous highlights upfront oak aromatic with chocolate and coffee highlights. Taste: Flavor depth is incredible the oak flavor highlights this big stout quite nicely. Vanilla stands out among the chocolate, coffee, and herbal hops not bad at all. Mouthfeel: Full body smooth carbonation no hint of the alcohol in the flavor which is good but somewaht dangerous. Drinkability: Wow, so drinkable great blend of flavors here with the oak barrel aging adding to the overall experience very tasty and smooth."
"Raspberry paste and peppery, charred vanilla appear first on the nose - reminds me of Rodenbach's Alexander. On the palate it is VERY milky and cocoa-flavored. Like Ovaltine, literally. Nearly dry, there is nothing astringent or difficult about the drink. Rootbeer, chocolate milk and strawberry soda patter upon the creamy, milky texture. I wonder if the blatant, confected, chocolate Slo-poke flavor is the result of natural cocoa, the yeast, or was it put there as an additive?"
"If you ever wondered what a Tootsie Roll would taste like in beer form, this is it. If you never wondered what a Tootsie Roll would taste like in beer form, you should. This may be the consummate dessert beer. It would be fascinating to know how this shapes up after three or four years in the cellar."
"Wow! Drinkable! A dark brown brew with a tan head of foam. Aromas are all over the place. Vanilla, chocolate, cream/milk (?), a bit of oakiness and a bit of a strange, lingering, alcohol-like aroma (bourbon?). The taste is a straight up creamy mix of coffee, cream, chocolate, vanilla, and some other undestinct hints. The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, and very easy to drink. The drinkability is amazing for a 10%abv brew as well. This one is really a winner! So unique and drinkable, yet high in complexity and abv! Why is this brew not highly regarded on BA!?"
"Thanks to trbeer for the bottle. Reminds me more of a porter than an old ale. Not a bad beer, and one that I may well have again."
"Upon re-review 02-23-05, I am picking up distinct sourness...the chocolate is nearly all gone, and the silken mouthfeel is now aceticly harsh. Gobble your stores up now, it's quickly depreciating with age. Those oak barrels must have added some lacto or something that is going crazy in the bottles."
"Dark brown-black color, has a good creamy brown head that leaves a nice lacing in my glass. Sweet roasted chocolate and coffee aromas, sweet fruity woody, smokey chocolate and coffee flavors. Nice milky bitter-sweet finish. Medium-full body with creamy and smooth mouthfeel, alcohol well hidden, very nice."
"Thanks to CRJMellor for the bottle."
"ng"
"Drinkability is only slightly better than average mainly do to soda-like tendencies and pretty heavy alcohol."
"2 1/2 years later, it's finally available in MN, in bombers, and is as good as ever. Wonderful nightcap on a very bad day, the day my 5-year old cat died. Helpful in providing some relaxation and a small amount of liquid comfort."
"Interesting stuff. Very, very drinkable for something with a 10% abv."
"This one pours out as if a black hole but it is transparent when put directly to a light. The head is weak and really light in color compared to the darkness of this beer. Lots of lacing on the glass. The smell is of something burnt and chocolate. The taste is extremely unusual. Really creamy, really milky, really sweet (chocolate/coffee). Burnt coffee beans come into the picture the more I drink it. An earthiness arises (maybe the hops?) Not bitter at all, nor is the yeast flavor noticed, nor even the alcohol. Really woody in an aggressive way. This is definitely a beer that needs to be tried because of it's unusualness."
"Drinkability is high despite its high alcohol content and great intriguing flavor."
"The first sip, and damn, this was not what I expected, it is extremely thick/creamy and smooth, tastes very much like baileys and coffee, except even more sweet and almost cloying. Really unusual tasting beer, there is a definite smokiness to this brew as well. I cant say I like this beer, and then after much consideration, I realized why: this beer is very similar in smell and taste to Ensure, the protein drink. The bottle notes that the alcohol level is 10%, but its hard to note. Cripes, I can tell this is well made, but Ill have to choke down at least half of the bottle."
"The alcohol is undetectable and Dragon's Milk is unbelievably smooth and drinkable for its 10% abv. Flavors from the oak aging are not quite as complex as I expected. I thought there'd be a greater presence of bourbon in the flavor profile, but I didn't pick up on that. Nonetheless, this is an awesome brew."
"Strong and black like a good cup of coffee. Little head, but a tad bit of sticky matter does cling to the glass. Aromas are at once of wood, with butter, roasted coffee and creamy chocolate in the background. The mouthfeel is quite lush. The carbonation is rather mild. Flavors run fairly deep, yet come back always to the wood-like a dry sauna at times. Some bitter chocolate/cherry like flavors are to be had, as well as strong, bitter chicory notes and malted milk. This is an interesting drink, yet I feel it is perhaps over-oaked? Try it if you see it, especially on a cold Winters night."
"Burly opaque black with a 1/4 inch head of decent persistence. Ring laces. Hugely diacetyl aroma, so much so that its like artificial butter on movie popcorn. The flavor moves beyond that in even stranger directions, quick sweetness, tons of lime juice mid mouth and a crashing finish that reminds me of German Black Forest Chocolate Cake with cherries. Long and lingering impression in the aftertaste. Does have alcohol notes. Geez, this is weird, a little gunky and as far away from any Old Ale as I can think of. I'll give it different -- but I won't say I like it particularly much..."
"This beer was as black as sin.  It had a light tan, foamy head.  It left some oily lace/residual.  The aroma was of malt, chocolate and burnt cherry.  The flavor was of malt, chocolate and burnt cherry.  It had a slight bit of alcohol present in the finish.  Slightly oily body to it.  A slightly lighter body than others of this style.  A good beer"
"This is a nice representation of a British olde ale. The deep dark color and lacy tan head hide flavors of sweet malt and old oak supported by a smooth heavy body."
