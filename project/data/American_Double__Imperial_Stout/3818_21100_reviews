"O- a nice drinkable oatmeal stout that hides the ABV pretty well.  It's not up there with ST's other Blackwater stouts, but still worth a try"
""
""
""
""
"O - Very enjoyable Oatmel Stout. The two years mellowed the alcohol heat considerably. A great winter sipper."

"O - This beer warrants serious respect as the 11% ABV could jump you if you're not careful.  This is a very good stout and well worth a try for anyone who enjoys this style."

"I should give it another chance."

"Overall - This is a very good oatmeal stout, not watery in the least, but I wanted a bit more of a substantial weight and coating of the mouth. I appreciate the absence of chocolate and coffee, and appreciated the flavor and the smoothness of the oats. A flavorful and well balanced oatmeal stout, and one that you should try."
"Pours dark sable color with light brown minimally foamy head..little to no lacing that disappears quickly. Smells slightly boozy from the age..malt and oat. Taste does not follow the nose..much more full bodied and developed. Milky, creamy, chocolate. No lactate or sour flavor like a typical oatmeal. Nice and chewy..silky and full in mouthfeel. Overall..aged extremely well and a full bodied flavorful taste..usually don't like oatmeals as much as milk stout, but not in this case."

"O - Great beer, its a shame this one isnt around anymore, but what a treat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I've heard talk that this beer is going to be retired. And that's a shame. I hope this isn't true. It, along with Creme Brulee, are some of my favorites from the Blackwater Series. I have yet to try Mokah which I'm looking forward to. But ""oat"" is great. Of all the oatmeal stouts I've had, it's number 1."
""
"Pitch black with no light around the edges and a finger of tan head that reduces to nothing in short order. It smells great with notes of chocolate, oatmeal, toasted oats, rum soaked raisins, and clean malts. The taste is alcoholic throughout with sweet malts, burnt toast, bitter hops, and plum. It has a medium body and leaves an alcohol burn at the end."
""
"Overall: Very well done, complex stout that you will enjoy tremendously."
""
""
""
""
"This is my bread and butter, so I may be a bit eschew, but I absolutely fell in love with this."

"O-Great brew, aging treats it well. Would have loved to have a current beer to match it up with. The Blackwater series is always phenomenal, and this lives little to be desired."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The rather high ABV is extremely well hidden in this beer and there is a nice balance between the sweetness and roastiness - all of this makes this beer very easy to drink and enjoy. I recommend sipping this one and it is going down well on the first really cold night of the autumn (and the first night where we saw some snow flurries)."
"This is one of those distinctively delicious brews that I never forget. It's about time someone imperialized the traditional oatmeal stout. I've always found the oats in standard ones to generally be much too subtle, if present at all. This is not the case with this. THIS delivers the oats... assertive oats. The oats in this stout will NOT be ignored. This stout will bash you over the head with a big sack of oats... and then you'll ask for more. Or at least I did."
"I feel like I'm drinking a real contender to the double stout crown, but one that's a bit short on complexity. The 11% alcohol is entirely well-hidden. The hop bitterness balances the sweet so well it creates the mirage of sweet french-roast coffee w/ cream. And the smoothness in the mouth is unsurpassed."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Super interesting, the cream adds a great twist to a typically thinner formula (non imperial oatmeal stout). This was a bit on the sweet side which takes something away from it, but otherwise not bad. Worth a shot if you want to expand your horizons a bit but I am sure there are better imperial oatmeal stouts out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pitch black with no light passage. Short cocoa head with poor retention and no lacing. Nose is full of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and cream. Flavor is chocolate forward with notes of oat, cream, and building bitterness from the roast as the flavor progresses. Full flavor here. Mouthfeel is relatively thin for the gravity, but full bodied nonetheless. Overall, a flavorful imperial stout with nice oat presence."

"The oats roll in this beer like few others; this has got to be one of the creamiest, smoothest, silkiest beers out there. It's thick without being too heavy and sweet without cloying, and the interplay with the light dryness is nearly perfect. Beautiful."
""
""
""
"O: A very sweet rendition of an oatmeal stout (expected for the blackwater line). Lots of oatmeal in this one, very creamy and smooth throughout. Lots of nice sweet graininess to counteract the bitter roasted malt character. Great oatmeal stout."

"O: I admit, I didn't have terribly high hopes for this one, seeing as I feel most big oatmeal stouts have way too much booziness to them. Then again, if there's one thing Southern Tier knows how to make, it's a ridiculously decadent dessert beer. And ridiculously decadent it is - finishing a whole bottle solo can be a chore. However, the fact that I simply can finish this solo is a testament to its solidity. This would have been incredible if the flavor could match up to the mouthfeel, though."

"like the other stouts in this little series from southern tier, this is a monster. it pours a frightening dense motor oil black, with little visible carbonation and just a thin film of tan. the darkness of this is insane. it smells oaty indeed, like a bowl of oatmeal, a little sweet, and really heavy from the roasted and burnt barley malt. the flavor is not as sweet as some of their others, but its got all the weighty feel and tastes. the malt is so dark, darker than ive seen really, and would probably be very bitter if it were not for the oats to sweeten it up and round it off. however, they also provide body, so the thickness of this is exacerbated into a freak of fermentable sugars. the alcohol that results is massive, and makes this a must share bottle of beer. it burns on the way down, but I still like the feel. its just so big, so dense and thick, but not stupidly sweet, its really a challenge to me. southern tier has got these huge stouts figured out, and this is the best of the lot really. I might have enjoyed the choklat more, but this is a special beer here, worth seeking out."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 9/19/2012. Pours dense pitch black color with a small dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, oats, toast, toffee, coffee, cream, dark bread, floral, light nuttiness, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roasted and dark malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, oats, roasted malt, toast, toffee, cream, light char, floral, dark bread, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Light coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark and milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, toffee, oats, light char, cream, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of roasted and dark malt flavors; with big robustness and malt balance, with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic imperial stout! Big robustness and complexity of roasted and dark malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the gravity. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Pours the darkest of browns, with a thin lighter brown head. Decent retention, and a good lace effect. Aroma is of dark chocolate, and dark, fruity malts. Body is thick and rich with some carbonation. Taste is of oats and malted chocolate, with a dark bittersweet edge. Hints, of coffee, and dark fruit are there as well. Awesome!!"
""
""
"O - As it warms the alcohol becomes more tame and the sweet and richer vanilla flavors come through - even more of a sipper but much better balances/flavors at room temperature. - Ratings reflect my room temperature impressions"

"Overall well crafted and has developed nicely in the last 7 months. One of the less flavored of the blackwater series but the still a real good beer."

"I selected this beer for review 600 because it was my official ""Christmas Eve"" bomber for three years (until I couldn't find a bottle one year and consequently killed the tradition). I honestly haven't had a bottle in a couple of years, and I am glad to report that it's still great. In fact, I think this is the best stout from Southern Tier. It's oddly under-appreciated, in my opinion. It's big, burly, and sweet, but I don't feel like I have diabetes thanks to the oats. Yum."

"22 ounce bottle for $7.99. Oily Irish coffee and grain with a sloppy splash of booze aroma. Pitch black, no light gets through, brown head, no lacing, no foam residue moments after the pour. Flavor is a strange medley of soy, coffee, umami, oats, alcohol. Palate is thick bodied, pungent taste to nose effect. Overall, this is a big shouldered, big daddy. Clear your schedule for the rest of the night, because this one takes time to polish off."

"O: Huge fan of Oatmeal Stouts and happy that ST nailed this one. A beefed up version of the style with plenty of the unique ingredients to make it special."
""
""
"Should be about half this strength."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Definite A/A+. I really like this beer. It does everything an imperial stout should and more. The oat balances this perfectly and draws all of its complexity in together. It also provides the slight grittiness to give a unique mouthfeel which informs a solid beer. Great beer. Will buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Now that I am almost finished with it I can say I like this one and will have it again. Not something to drink after mowing the lawn, but definitely a late winter beer!!"

""

""

"An extreme oatmeal stout if I ever drank one. If it was a little less sweet, it would be much better."
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is deep dark brown to black with a thin layer of head that dissipated rather quickly. The nose is the epitome of hearty roasted oats. The roast profile is quite potent and tasty. The body is typical of a top tier stout – hearty. The finish brings even more roasted goodness with coffee notes coming through as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I gave it a 5 mostly due to the fact that since having the beer I believe this is how stouts should be made in the past I have had (hoppier stouts) while they are good too, this Southern Tier Oat Stout changes the perspective. The chocolate and creamy/sweetness made for a real treat I will be buying this again."

""
"Price Point - $8.99/22oz bottle"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Another enjoyable offering from the Blackwater series. This one is a huge beer, but more subtle than Choklat and Creme Brûlée. Seek it out if you like big oatmeal stouts."

"When I tasted this beer, I got chocolate, roastiness and oatmeal. I was waiting for something else to kick in (booziness, fruits, something) but the taste was pretty much surface deep. I felt like I have tasted this beer 10 times before in various other chocolate and/or oatmeal stouts."
""
"Serving Type: Bottle"
""
"22oz bottle poured nearly black with a minimal and short-lived head. The carbonation level, nonetheless, is good. The high ABV is amazingly well hidden, even in the feel and nose. Full body with very smooth feel. Rich but not particularly complex flavor with plenty of very dark roasted malt and some oats."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is near black and opaque with a thick beige head. Excellent retention with ample lacing cascading down the walls of the tulip. The aroma offers roast, alcohol heat, oats, bread, chocolate. The taste pretty much follows suit, with perhaps a bit more oat presence than was indicated in the aroma. Lots of flavor, but I find the alcoholic heat a bit obtrusive, keeping this beer from being great. Crackers and biscuits linger, as the beer finishes dry. Medium to full bodied with appropriate carbonation. A solid beer. I bet this would age gracefully."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is excellent. Nice smooth and rich flavors. There is some good roast and great oat and chocolate malt notes. Some good sweetness and the ABV is barely noticed."
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This is another fantastic beer from Southern Tier. I really wish they distributed to Colorado and I regret not focusing on them more when I had access to their stuff in Chicago. Anyhow, the Oat paired pretty much perfectly with the skirt steak and potatoes I had for dinner tonight. Like many other Southern Tier offerings I have had, this one stays balanced throughout, in almost every way."

""

"Overall a great desert beer, although a 12oz bottle would be more than enough, I'm struggling to finish the 22oz bottle. Definitely a sipper, the alcohol and sweetness make it hard to drink too quickly."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Very solid stout, great on a cold fall night like tonight"
""
"This truly is an outstanding stout. It Poured almost pitch black with a white head. It had beautiful lacing, I mean truly beautiful. aromas of coffee, chocolate, oats, and hops were all present. heavy in the mouth with light carbonation. alcohol is detectable in the palate, but only after flavors of chocolate, caramel and chocolate are enjoyed. the finish kept me wanting more and I was saddened by the last sip. This is my first experience with southern tier and I enjoyed it very much. I highly recommend this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Bombers are always pricey and rarely justify the costs. While I still prefer other S/T stouts, Oat is ranks up there."
"I loved this beer. Yet another winner from Southern Tier."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Now matter how you slice it, this one kicks ass!"
"O- maybe one of the easiest to find complex imperial oatmeal stouts around. Definitely worth a shot if your willing to embark on a journey through the thick, dense, oatmeal venture in a bottle! This brewery is never a let down"
"Very well done imperial oatmeal stout. Really showcases all of the finer qualities of a well crafted stout with great balance and oat added to smooth it out."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Very nice. I love the smooth flavor transitions in this one. It starts out sweet and then moves to more roasty and bitter. The feel helps with both the great flavors as well as the transition of those flavors. Really a tasty and enjoyable beer to drink. Grab one, sit back and sip slowly."
""
""
""
"Dense finger plus of dark brown foam, mix of differing bubble sizes, dissolves down at a moderately steady pace leaving a solid surface coating behind, skimpy lacing looks like miniature iron mail, no stickiness. The liquid is the expected jet black color, impossible to tell if there are bubbles inside or not, hint of orange at the outermost edges. The nose is all chocolate, toffee, butterscotch and coffee ice cream, probably more flowers than oats although there is a granola, breakfast cereal element going on, might be some plum or cherry fruit there but that chocolate is overwhelming. Full-bodied, lands on the palate with a thud like an anvil. Eventually the carbonation lifts it to create space to move a little, but not much. Blend of both dark and milk chocolate, heavy duty licorice in the mix, vanilla bean, flowers, pine, mint, caramel, molasses and hazelnut coffee too. Once more the oats seem relegated to the background. Gets hoppier retronasally yet without any real sting. Can appear a bit boozy at times. That noted, props for the vividness of the flavors and for all of its flash doesn’t wear you down trying to consume it. Hard to think of what food you’d pair it with, though."
""
"O- A very nice stout, the oats give it a really great feel while the well-hidden booze gives it some warmth and complexity, it's pretty damn drinkable too for such a big beer."
""
"O- I love all of Southern Tiers Backwater Imperial Stouts... As much as I love this one... it's probably 5th out of the 5... that's not a bad thing... it's just that I LOVE the others sooo much!!! It's very really nice, but it doesn't have the caracter that the other Backwater Stouts exude!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A decent stout overall, though like most Southern Tier beers, is too sweet and comes in too large of a serving that is difficult to finish alone. It's also fairly simple and lacking in complexity."
""
""
""
"I'd give it an 89/90. I'd love a 10 dollar 4 pack."
""
""
""
"A big imperial oatmeal stout. Very nice offering from this brewery, who has become a major player in these various imperial stouts."
"Solid chocolate stout, but but not much else going on here. Syrupy and sweet, save for dessert. Not much to differentiate it from the other big ST stouts like Choklat. Not much from the oatmeal at all."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good big stout for those times when you don't have all that much cash to blow on the big leagues. No-nonsense and a fine example of the oatmeal stout style. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was absolutely superb! Wish I had bought a case of these."
""
"D - Very drinkable. The oats really give this beer a great smoothness for how big the body and abv are. Overall, very nicely balanced."
""
""
"Overall a solid, well-crafted imperial stout."
""
"Overall: Tasty and nearly always on shelves in NJ right now. While not jaw dropping, if nothing piques my interest and I'm in the mood for a strong oatmeal stout, I would happily turn to this brew."
""
""
"O - If the mouthfeel was a thicker beer, then this would be a winner. And, it's a sweeter stout than I'm used to drinking as well."
"Overall: I have no complaints, Imperial Oat exceeded my expectations but then again rarely southern tier has disappointed me. Be happy and keep drinking, Salud!"

"O- Great taste and feel, nice warming from the alcohol without the harsh taste, solid imperial stout"
""
""
""
"Overall: a nice flavorful stout. One of their best. Very drinkable. Almost too sweet but otherwise very good."
""
""
""
""
""
"S- big oat smell with a light smokiness. Chocoalte and caramel malt, vanilla very sweet but I like sweet beers 4.5"
"B+"
""
"O - I enjoy most of Southern Tier's 22 oz. offerings and while this was decent, it was a little bit disappointing. Very sweet, which is acceptable in a diverse style, but I would have preferred a bit more complexity. I probably won't spend the $10 to get this one again."
""
""
"O: Overall a delicious stout. Not my favorite of the BlackWater series or ST beers but it shouldn't be overlooked."
""
""
""
"VERY GOOD, WORTH TRYING!"
"O - The only way I'd get this again would be to see if aging it for a year would do anything to mellow out that booze and bring everything together more cohesively. So I'll assign myself that project. The bigness and thickness of the beer make me want to rate it higher, but the overall execution makes me rate it lower."
""
"O - Southern Tier has yet to disappoint me, and this one just follows suit. Great oatmeal stout, very easily drinkable at 10.8%. Pretty much no alcohol detected at all. I would defiantly grab more of these... If I could. Thanks a bunch Todd for sending me another great brew. Cheers!"
"I'm glad I bought 2 of these last year. The age has smoothed it out nicely and I like it much more now than I did initially. Drinks like a Russian imperial with the dark fruit replaced by oats. I'll definately track down a few more & let them sit for 2-3 years to see how it developes further. "
"D - I never would have guessed this to be 11%, 9 - maybe. It is very smooth. The taste is outstanding. I will have this again - one of the best offerings form Southern Tier."
"Overall I have really enjoyed every Southern Tier brew I have tried and this one is no different. Enjoyed with a friend and a UFC fight. Quite a fantastic combination. Thanks to injuredreserve for the chance. A slam dunk if you get the chance."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not as absurd as many in the Blackwater series, but it is big in many ways itself. Good stuff."
"O: Rather boring overall. Had high hopes based on my experience with the rest of the blackwater series, but this one fell flat for me."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: My favorite local oatmeal stout so far. As the label states this 650ml. bottle is a meal in itself"
""
"Black with mahogany edges and only a rim of tan foam. Licorice, molasses and dark fruits on the nose with a lower dose of sweetness in the nose than say, choklat or creme brulee. Flavor is of oats and molasses and dark malts with some nice soily character. The beer is chewy and resonant in finish with a moderate carb and has the potential to fill a belly. The 10.8% ABV doesn't even shine whatsoever."
""
""
"Overall, definitely a good stout and I'm happy I still have about 2/3rds of my 65cl bottle left. ^^"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a shabby stout. I was expecting more, but still pleasantly happy on this St. Patrick's Day. Wish I could try this out on nitro if the time becomes right."
""
""
""
"The best Southern Tier offering I've had. One of the best beers I've had. Tastes more like a porter, but a great stout."
""
""
"Pitch black pour with an intense coffee foam that will not dissipate, providing a hefty promise that you will enjoy the drink that follows. It lived up to the promise quite nicely, giving off an aftertaste and aroma that balances oats and java, with a smidgeon of chocolate. Everything compliments each other nicely and makes this a very enjoyable brew. I will be trying other beers from Southern Tier in the future."
"For more beer reviews, music, movies, books and more check out my website at www.selfhatinghipster.com"
"Opened up a bomber I've been saving for a couple of years. Appearance is still nice, with a rich, dark color and a good full head of dark tan foam. Smell is a little lacking, with only some oats and dark malt and alcohol aromas. The taste is much fuller and complex, though. Dark fruits, sweet malt, roasted chocolatey flavors and a fairly dry, slightly hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is rather thick, but the carbonation is robust enough to balance it. Overall, this is a very nice example of the style and quite drinkable."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very solid imperial stout."
""
""
"Overall-Great Oatmeal stout, very tasty."
""
""
""
"D - Thick and complex, like all of Southern Tier's stouts, but still fairly drinkable for a beer of this strength. The balance definitely favors malt and a sweet finish but there is enough roast character and malt bitterness to prevent it from becoming excessive the way some other sweet, strong stouts tend to."
"Southern delivers again. We really need more access to them here in Boise."
""
"o- this was an okay stout. I'm glad I tried it but I'm also glad I didn't pay $9-$10 for a big bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"Despite the high alcohol, this is an easy-drinking beer that improves significantly with warmth."
"O: Overall I think this is an awesome beer. If you have friends that are whiskey drinkers, this is the perfect beer for them. The ""Oat"" title makes it sound like it's going to be a grainy flavored slick beer, but it seriously tastes rich and feels smooth like it was aged...it's that good...and it just has this nice roasted flavor. I would buy it again, and I will enjoy the rest of this!"
""
"O-Very well balanced stout with great flavor."
""
""
""
"Very smooth finish - feels slick on the tongue. I feel the biggest detractor is the alcohol burn - I think this would benefit from a little age."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pleasant, but not extremely quaffable, more of an Imperial sipper. In my opinion, these Blackwater Series beers are bigger than they need to be, though for the most part they are tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A delicious, really layered and well-balanced stout with a lot going on. Heavy and super-rich and strong."
"Overall: I love this beer. It's got good looks and good taste. What else can you ask for?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I've noticed Southern Tier does big beers well. They go big and I like them. Anything else seems underwheling. This is a tasty big stout. I'd have it again."
""
""
""
"overall, a very tasty stout, although a bit on the sweet side. pretty typical for southern tier big stouts. value is just ok at $10 a bomber. there are better southern tier black water stouts in my opinon, but this one is pretty tasty anyways."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I taste oats. Go figure. I taste Willamette hops. Are they white? For a beer so dark, it tastes so pale. It's a bit of a disappointing dichotomy. It's like the bitter hops only prevent a sweet-candied, molassy mess. It's strong, and mostly smooth, but it's ehh.... There's just nothing neat about. To be frank, it's forgettable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouth feel wise, it's lightly carbonated, oily slick and smooth with a bit of alcohol warmth."
""
"Definitely a beer that could be had for breakfast. Amazing beer, but I prefer Choklat."
""
"Overall: I was expecting my first offering from Southern Tier to be good based on their reputation for good brewing, but this blew me away. An amazing oatmeal stout that sweet-tooths and hop heads alike could enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – A bit acidic and not what I expected out of an oatmeal stout, but the profile definitely grew on me throughout the night."
"Poured into a snifter this stout pours jet black with a moderate tan head that diminished to a thin skim and left a few wisps of lace. The aroma is moderately roasty, bittersweet chocolate, with hints of booze and spicy hops. The flavor is very malty--roast and bittersweet. The beer warms the belly and is velvety smooth. The carbonation is moderate and body silky full. Overall a tremendous stout-recommend."
"Overall a solid choice of a stout. Southern Tier is becoming my favorite RIS brewers in the country."
""
"Overall. Good beer, but maybe not quite as much for the style. I'd drink it again, for sure."

"O: I'm a huge fan of stouts, and this tops my list. I would be hard pressed to come up with another brew that would top this one. It is well balanced is most every respect. If you come across it, I highly recommend picking up a bottle!"

"O: It's good, but not great. I think I had pretty high expectations coming into this since I love oatmeal stouts and an imperial oatmeal stout is even better, but it just didn't quite deliver enough for me. Decent drinkability, but I probably wouldn't buy this again."

"A nice full bodied mellow oily Stout, very drinkable and now one of my favorites. Great beer and a must try!!!"

"Overall: Like all of ST Blackwater series, its big and boozy. However, I do like these huge beers and this was no exception. I will say, however, that Choklat was much better and really seemed to tame the harsher elements of these big stouts."

"O - A good oatmeal stout, but it doesn't blow me away."

"0 ~ i enjoy ST beers. this one was pretty good."
"Bottom line here is the protein and malt work wonderfully. This is the best of their stouts (pending trying chocolate). The oats seem to add just enough to the mouth that this feels almost like a thick imperial. It isn't great and perhaps my score i s a touch high, but it really is an improvement in body and feel over their other imperials. Not a beer I'll be buying often at the price but well worth a try."
"Along with Hoppin' Frog BORIS, these beers accend the thresholds for traditional Oatmeal Stouts and thrust into the realm of Imperial Status while retaining a true base recipe. If this is the new world for Imperial Stouts, then I'm all in on the shift!"
"Once the Belgian notes fade, this is a wonderfully complex imperial stout."
"Blackwater series is the best series of black beers that I've ever had, and this one is no exception. I can't say enough good things about Southern Tier's ability to make big black beers."
"Any oatmeal stout I have is immediately compared to Samuel Smith's. I hate to get `artsy' here, but comparing ST Oat to SS OMS is like comparing Bernini's David to Michelangelo's David. You don't. Each is wonderful in its own right. SS is like the Michelangelo. It's reserved, mellow, pristine, and ideal. ST is like the Bernini. It's alive and moving and bristling with energy. If you like oatmeal stout and haven't tried this, you don't know what you're missing. Seek it out."
"Overall this is an excellent oatmeal stout - Highly recommended!"
"O-A very solid and enjoyable stout that I will certainly pick up again."
"M - Medium body, light carbonation."
"This has been in my cellar for 2 years. Poured a super dark black color with a third inch sized brown head that stuck around for a minute or so. Wow tarts a helluva nose! I smell dark AND a sweeter milk chocolate dark with hints of brown sugar, a strong liqueur, and raisins or other dried dark fruit. Wow, age has been kind to this. For being 11% alcohol(and the boozy nose) I expected more of a boozy taste. This is smoooth and not too bitter. The oat flavor is there but perhaps more in the background than i would expect. Chocolate is the strongest flavor here with a hint of coffee. After the age, id say this beer taxes more like a Belgian style stout than an oatmeal but thats cool. The feel, perhaps slightly thinner than most is still very smooth and coating. This would be great with nilla ice cream!"
"Overall - Excellent beer. Well balanced, easy to drink beer with strong, but not harsh, flavors. I definitely recommend this to anyone who prefers the bold flavors in imperial stouts without the harsh booziness."
"A nice beer and the phenolics add depth to an otherwise sweet beer. Nice."
"O: another quality stout product from STBC. I was very impressed with the solid taste of this beer and how enjoyable it was. Not Creme Brulee enjoyable, but very good nevertheless."
"O: Well put-together and nice. I really enjoyed this treat and love to get my hands on ST brews! Well done."
"O - Big, hearty stout. Highly recommended."
"Overall, nice beer and definitely worth a try. A bit lacking in complexity."
"Overall, okay. I wish it had more to balance out the sweetness. Or I could have cooked a good medium rare steak to mitigate it. Cheers."
"I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a sweet strong beer to sip on...."
"Overall this beer is pretty good, lots of flavor mixed with a good amount of alcohol. Gonna drink the whole bomber tonight, paired nicely with some pinkberry chocolate and peanut butter yogurt. This beer is about 3 years old, which I suspect is just right in the amount of time aging. Cant imagine how boozy this beer would be fresh."
"22oz bottle. Pours an almost black color with no head whatsoever. No lacing. Not much of a smell to this one. Aroma is a earthy with some malts, grain, and chocolate aromas. Taste is boozey with some chocolate, cherries and grain flavors. Earthy. Does have some of that typical Southern Tier sweetness to it. Certainly can taste the abv. Virtually no carbonation. I have to say that this is not one of the best Blackwater Series beers. Overall, its decent but Southern Tier makes some better Imperial Stouts than this one."
"The body of the beer is thick and the finish is full, as well. This beer flavor profile is busy like an LA highway. There is a lot going on here; however, I feel that it needs to age for a bit to help define the flavors. A good beer, nonetheless."
"O: A pleasant surprise. I’m glad I waited so long to open this as its aged beautifully. Really enjoyable flavor and mellow mouthfeel."
"overall i think this is an excellent beer, very tasty and enjoyable. perhaps not up there with the best of the best, but one i will not hesitate to revisit in the future."
"Overall: I'd drink it if somebody had it. Wouldn't buy it again if there were other Southern Tiers available."
"However, I'm left with the feeling that I just ate some burnt cotton candy. If droplets of the beer dropped on the ground the ants would swarm. There's also a lack of carbonation which detracts from the overall experience."
"D: One of the best Oatmeal stouts i've ever had. Southern Tier never disappoints."
"Overall: The Russian Imperial Stout is my favorite among the strong stouts but I felt the need to branch out to the different strong stout styles. This one is a slow sipping dessert style beer. I can't imagine having more than one or two in a sitting. The 22 oz. bottle is perfect size for sampling this style."
"All in all I guess it's ok, there is a chance I got a bad bottle, so I'm sure I'll give it another try in the future. I let this age for a year but was still a little boozy. I guess I'm spoiled with Ipswich and St Ambrose Oatmeal Stouts that I might have expected more from an Imperial Oatmeal Stout. A gift from a good friend, my review does not reflect my appreciation."
"drinkability: a all world stout! This is how you do it. They get it."
"Overall - its very nice!! I like"
"O: Pretty easy drinker and good. Nothing super special but it isn't bad by any means."
"Poured on-tap into a pint glass, presenting with a jet black and viscous look, with a huge, creamy, smooth milk chocolate colored head. Aromas of nut and bread, with some dark fruit sweetness. Flavors are dark cherry bittersweet, coffee, and a steady backbone of dark chocolate. The aftertaste is bittersweet dark chocolate, and the finish is ridiculously smooth. Very tasty brew!"
"Overall: A pretty solid double imperial stout from Southern Tier. They have better big stouts but this is pretty good."
"Had a bottle of this about a year ago and honestly wasn't too impressed with it. The beer pours out as a deep thick black looking liquid with a thin tan head that nearly vanishes within minutes. The smell is a little grainy with some oats and roasted malts. The taste is rather muted, I can taste the malts and oats but it just seems to be on the faint side. If this is really an imperial I'd expect the flavors to be much more intense. The mouthfeel I thought was thinner than what it looked when it was being poured out. Overall not my favorite brew from Southern Tier."
"Dark, opaque, with a tan well retained head and no lace. Aroma of latte and chocolate. Flavor has elements of dried fruit, with lots of molasses sweetness in the middle and finish. A hint of alcohol comes out middle to end. Carbonation is a on the medium high side. Medium body."
"O- I had this bomber with another friend who thought it was a bit too heavy for him so I ended up having 2/3 the bomber... I think this beer would get a slightly higher score from me if I had half the amount I did. I ended up getting palate fatigue from this beer because it was so big and sweet. It had a flavor like none other I have ever had, primarily from the wonderful sweet oats, but this thing is beyond a dessert beer- it is a whole damn dessert bar in a glass and that got to me after a bit."
"A chocolate moose dessert! An awesome brew! A bit sweet but the thickness and sweetness help to carry out the robust flavors within. I damn fine brew"
"Not bad. Honestly, I really don't know taste wise what makes this an oatmeal stout. I won't pretend to. It just comes across as a thick, sweet stout with minimal roasted and hop bitterness in the back. Tasty though, especially for the ridiculous ABV."
"Overall I got what I hoped to get. Sweet, balanced, chocolate. Not sure the age since they don't date, could be months, could be years. All I know is my bottle was perfect. Can't wait to finish the bomber!"
"This beer is a damn fine looking beer that makes you want to drink it. Beer doesn't smell half bad either with notes of chocolate and fruit. It actually smells like a belguim quadrupel ale (abt 12). Unfortunately for me I don't like sweet beers and this one is very sweet. Too sweet actually, if you like sweet and even fruity beers this one is for you, otherwise stay away."
"Nice dark black coldr like a beer should be. A thick tan head that dissapates quickly. Smells and tastes of chocolate and vanilla. Smooth feeling in the mouth for as strong as it is. 11%. Overall an excellent beer to drink and share with your friends"
"O- Overall a very nice brew, a touch sweet, but nice to end the night with it."
"Pours a pitch black color with a small 1 inch tan head that fades to a tiny cap. No real lacing on the drink down and what is present seems to drip back down into the beer. Smells of malted milk, milk chocolate, oatmeal, and some dark fruits like raisins. I get a distinct smell of Whoppers candy and that is awesome. A very sweet beer here, which sort of detracts from the overall tastes. The taste comes through as roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, sweet dark fruits, and toasted oatmeal. Mild cocoa powder bitterness on the palate lasts after each sip. Beer is nicely carbonated and is thick and creamy in the mouth. Overall, this is a good beer and my first from Southern Tier. I liked it overall, but it's a bit too sweet in my opinion."
"Way to go southern tier."
"Not sure what to make of the ABV on this one... BA says 9.6, Southern Tier's site says 10.8, and the bottle says 11. hmm..."
"Overall: A lot to recommend it. I had actually let this one sit for several months because I had been so horrified by the over the top sweetness of the Choklat stout so this is a really pleasant surprise"
"O: This is a good one, but I prefer choklat and mokha. Still, southern tier churns out some great brews."
"Big cheers to IlludiumQ36 for another excellent beer!"
"Overall - A bit much. Sweet and very coffee flavored. This 22oz is more then enough. Too much sweetness and high alcohol make this a occasional drink. Another sweet bomb from southern tier. Not bad, not great."
"Overall, a good oatmeal stout from one of my favorite series of beers from Southern Tier."
"Complex and well rounded the alcohol begins to show some heat after a bit but never intrudes on the flavors, kick ass new ""big one"" from Southern Tier which I expected."
"O: This is okay; it is too sweet and artificial tasting. It is okay with a dessert."
" Upfront taste was very malty to me. That thrown in with the great taste of the chocolate mixed in. At the backend of this, I tasted oat coming through. This was a medium-heavy bodied beer with little carbonation. The ABV is well hidden so beware!"
"D - worse than awful - had to pour it down the drain. Sweetness is over the top and totally out of balance. Absolutely terrible and disappointing considering this wasn't cheap."
"Notes: As in many of Southern Tier's bigger beers, the hop bitterness tends to feel a bit out of place at times. Maybe it's just me. Still a very good beer."
"Bold and aggressive yet complex, balanced, and smooth. A deluxe special treat. Booze is well hidden. Tons of flavor. This one can play with the big boys."
"Note on bottle recommended a snifter. Not fancy enough to own one and drank from a wine glass. Still, this stuff is off the hook. I so rarely buy stouts for myself, but I got this as a birthday present. If you're like me and mainly drink lagers and pale ales, do yourself a favor and grab this hearty stout. Definitely meant to be enjoyed, not chugged. Hits the same brain receptors as the Unibroue ""I can't remember what I did last night"" feeling."
"You know, this started out with some wonderful caramel-toffee roasted malt flavor, but towards the end of the bomber, it stated to really have a nasty bitter aftertaste for some reason. Very difficult to finish. Full-bodied, on the sweet side, but a bad aftertaste."
"D: The beer is quite drinkable considering its strength because the alcohol is well masked from the taste."
"Readily available and not too pricey. however a little too sweet and boozy for me to go out and grab this again. Definitely a good beer, and would love to try on tap."
"Drinkability: I think I would've been happier splitting this four ways... or even five, six, or seven ways. Oat is a humongous beer! I think it would actually be better off with a lower OG and FG."
"Verdict - I personally did not enjoy this beer at all. The first sip or two were interesting. But after that, it was just painful for me to drink. The 11% alcohol did not balance well with the rest of the ingredients."
"D: A sipper to be sure. The alcohol isn't as apparent in the taste as it was in the nose, but it's definitely there. A good bit of warming in the throat as you drink, but not at all an overpowering booziness. The flavor has a good bit of sweetness and at 10% ABV, you'll want to take your time with this."
"D - It would be a great beer to enjoy in front of a fire and just relax."
"Worth noting that mom, who claims to not like beer, said she could drink this, when I made her take a taste. It's funny how someone who supposedly hates beer always likes the beer I have her taste. But anyway - just like the other big Southern Tier stouts, this one's got some crossover appeal."
"Just like the label states... midnite black with hints of crimson around the crown. Half finger head took a bit to come together and then dissipated quickly with not much lacing at all. Malty, sweet and dark fruity nose. Alchohol is present on first taste but then gives way to the smoke of roasted barley, oats, caramel and chocolate with just enough hops to spice it up a bit. Feelin' some spice o' black licorice as well. 11% ABV makes this Imperial a definite top session brew... one bomber is good enough for this here nugget!!"
"Notes: Another nice offering from Southern Tier, maybe not my favorite but they sure know how to craft these big stouts, and while maintaining their characteristic touch this feels particularly adept and smooth."
"Served: January 19, 2011"
"D- Good imperial stout, great mouthfeel!"
"As advertised pours as dark as a moonless night. No head on this one just a thin layer of froth. Coffee and licorice notes initially Nice roastiness and the Oats are definitely apparent. Medium body, slightly oily but not as full as most Impy's. Well balanced flavors yet a bit subdued, just a hint of bitterness and finishes slightly dry. Flavors range from chocolate, grainy roasted malt and molasses. Overall a well made beer."
"This beer is dessert. It pours like molasses and is nearly as dark. Head is impressive and exceptionally dark as well. This is thick and sweet. If this was a blind taste test I would peg this as a chocolate stout. That is the dominant flavor and smell. Dark dark cocoa with a hint of coffee and molasses. You do get a sort of thick oatmeal taste halfway in however. The mouthfeel is good at first but can get a bit sticky. Drinkability is great but only for about 6oz tops. Delicious but weighty."
"A thick beer with a lower level of carbonation make this a delicious oatmeal stout. It is a bit on the heavier side and is fairly sweet, so those two factors made it a little less drinkable than the average stout."
"This is the Southern Tier brew that I've most wanted to try for the past few years and I'm glad to finally get a chance to try it. However, I can't help but be a bit disappointed in the relatively thin body and weak aroma."
"I'm back and forth with Southern Tier. This one is forth. It's excellent and unusual. Lot's of alcohol presence. If you don't like that, you won't like this. I can't say I detect any oatmeal or mouthfeel of it on this brew. The alcohol is that overwhelming. The stout flavor is also secondary. It's there, but masked by that ABV. Normally I would't like that but it seems to work for this particular beer. Two of these will probably knock you on your a$$. I might tempt fate it's that good..."
"D- Overall, I'm a huge fan of all the Imperial Stouts in the Southern Tier line and Oat is no exception. They are all similar in nature, but all have their own unique characteristics which make them each special. Recommended!"
"Mouthfeel is just about medium-bodied with a small carbonation feel. Easily drinkable, but more so for sharing than individual consumption."
"Cheers..."
"D: A sipper at 11%, but it's hard to drink slow. Like I stated above, the only one of the 5 beers in the black water series that isn't overly sweet, so it's definitely more drinkable in that sense"
"ABV here says 9.6%, but the bottle says 11%. Given that, and the style, it really wasn't hard to finish off a bomber. Giving it a 4 for D, with the only improvement being a slightly cleaner flavor and MF."
"(brewed fall 2008)"
"D - flavor makes you want more, but the bitterness and alcohol burn make you want to stop. One bomber will do."
"It's a nice beer, but probably only one glass nice. I wouldn't buy this one again, instead I'd go for the Choklat which has an even higher ABV and seems to mask the alcohol better than this. Both are sweet, but the Choklat is more tasty, though it is a chocolate vs. oatmeal stout. Take it for what it's worth."
"D- Its a sipper as stated before. Cloying and sweet. Thick and syrupy. 9.6 is well hidden so be careful. Dessert sipper!"
"Drinkabilit is ok. Tasty, but a bit sweet for multiples."
"d - Very drinkable and very pleasant would definitely enjoy this beer again!"
"D-Too heavy and has a high abv to be very drinkable."
"Notes: For me this one was a bit hard to finish. It has a lot going on but it's all cloyingly sweet and there is little to no balance at all."
"Pours a translucent very dark brown, thin and fast fading tan colored head, couple small blobs of lace. Smell: toasted oats, dark chocolate, bit of roast and dark fruit. Taste: dark brown sugar, chocolate, a little char, molasses-y, oat, bit of raisin, quite sweet with a background earthy/leafy hopping popping up. Viscous and sweet, drying and sticky finish. Nice oatmeal stout but overly sweet."
"Drinkability: I haven't had this one as much as I've had their other offerings, but wow on tap this is just awesome."
"D--Excellent drinkability for this high of an ABV. Gotta take it slow and enjoy the flavors as it warms up."
"Taste is also very fruity and sweet, downright candy-ish for a stout, in fact; but with some noticeable alcohol bite at the end, which clashes a bit with the cloying upfront sweetness. Syrupy mouthfeel. This is certainly flavorful enough, with a lot going on, but it's way too sugary tasting for my liking; I'm getting sick of it fast as I drink. If you're seeking a super-sweet, syrupy, yet very alcoholic-tasting stout, this one is for you. If that sounds sort of gross, well ... it is. It's complex enough to warrant a taste -- the complexity leaves me feeling open to trying other beers from this brewer -- so if it is a failure, it's at least an ambitious failure. But I can't recommend this particular beer very highly in and of itself. C+ or so, though BA's system scores it out even lower."
"This is not very drinkable but it is fairly interesting and worth a try."
"This was a Christmas gift from my niece and husband. I typically like Oatmeal Stouts but this was a-typical."
"Poured a deep black with a tan head. Smells of caramel, chocolate, and other things sweet. With the pour into my glass, you can tell this beer has low carbonation, and the oatmeal provided silky smoothness. Great tastes of caramel, brown sugar, molasses, and coffee. The taste is just a bit boozy as the ~9.5% alcohol comes through. I've been wanting to try this beer for some time, and I was thoroughly impressed. I have a second bottle and will let it age a bit."
"Finally, I've gotten around to drinking all of the beers of the Black Water series from Southern Tier and I've (accidentally) saved Oat for last. While not as chocatey as Choklat of as coffee flavored as Jahva, it is still quite good. While I've never had an Imperial oatmeal stout before, I quite like this one. I am proud to say that Southern Tier is from my state. I would certainly pick this one up, but if I were ranking the Black Water series, it'd go Choklat, Mokah, Jahva, Creme Brulee and then Oat. Those, however, are some of my favorite beers. Give this one a try. Cheers!"
"Pours a deep, dark near black with cap of brown cap, good retention and decent lacing. Scent is sweet from the get go, notes of chocolate cake and a cup of mild coffee, heavy on the cream and sugar but a nice roasty quality lingers in the back. Taste again starts of sweet, but not cloying. Roast flavors come through quickly. Same notes of chocolate cake and sugary and creamy coffee. Noticeable juicy hop presence behind the strong flavors. Fuller sid eof medium bodied, definitely coasts the glass but feels lighter than that on the palate, some dryness despite all the sweetness. A really nice tasting stout that brings the full flavor profiles as well as the sweetness expected from Southern Tier."
"- Overall not bad, has a killer dry touch.. but is a bit sweet. Might turn out better after a couple of years."
"I live on the west coast, so I had a hard time finding this and it was costly. I probably wouldn't seek it out here, but when I go back east I will."
"Nice beer."
"Nice beer and worth your while to check it out."
"D: Oh so easy, but it was so big, it took me an hour and a half."
"very drinkable very likable the high abv might be an issue since you really dont taste it can easily sneak up on you"
"This brew is dark but flows out quickly from the bottle. Little carbonation, small brown head that dissapates quickly. The smell is fairly sweet with bittersweet cocoa and vanilla. The taste is of vanilla bean at the front with a cocoa and coffee in the rear with a nice oatmeal back adding to a smooth beer and taste. Smooth medium bodied dark brew. This is a grreat beer, you can't tell that it is almost 10 abv!"
"D: Choklat, Mokah, Jahva, and Creme Brulee all have a run for their money here! For my dough, this is the definitive Southern Tier beer!"
"D - This beer is very very substantial. It is thick and heavy and very filling. That said it is rather tasty and overall of good drinability."
"I poured into a snifter to two inches of brown head. It is pretty much black in color. The aroma is rich, dark chocolate and molasses. The flavor is dark chocolate and coffee. It has a creamy texture and no hints of alcohol in the taste or smell. This beer is delicious. As is the case with most Southern Tier beers, it is full of flavor and the aroma is amazing. It is just so rich and flavorful that one in a sitting is satisfying."
"M/D: The mouthfeel is nice and smooth, mild carbination, works well. I liked the beer at first, but once I was sipping it, it just had a medicinal/tingling aftertaste."
"With 11% ABV I was expecting something bold and bursting with flavor to be smoothed out and refined by a year of cellaring. Maybe it doesn't age well?"
"The aroma is very strong with coffee, oats, molasses, chocolate, and hops. The appearance is almost black with a large head. The taste is like the aroma with a burnt coffee oat finish. The palate is smooth. Overall this is an interesting beer but not that great."
"drinkability: This is the 3rd in the Blackwater series for me (after Unearthly and Mokah) and each has been extraordinary. Bravo."
"It does have a nice smooth, slick feel...before the alcohol burn kicks in. Not terribly viscous and it does feel thin. This beer would be good at the above 9.6%...too bad the bottle says 11.0%."
"D: Delicious. Great malt sweetness and still very balanced. Very smooth, and the alcohol is well harmonized. Can't tell it has 11% abv. I'm slugging this back."
"This is a good oat imperial stout but a little too sweet for my palate."
"Drinkability: This is something I'd drink while sitting on my couch near a fire while watching a movie. I don't really think this beer would match well with food, it might be something you would drink for desert."
"D: Given the brew's amazing balance, you'll find yourself drinking this dangerously fast. None of the flavors dominate one another. Coffee, chocolate, bready malts - all resonate perfectly. The flavors were so good here I never noticed any stout bloat."
"d - not something I would drink two in a row of, but definitely a great beer for a cold night"
"D- Outlandishly rich and delicious. It has really calmed down over the years. Highly recommended, but be prepared for a meal in a bottle."
"Aroma is strong and smoky with an overtone of molasses and a hint of quality coffee. It pours a rich opaque sable, like any good stout, with a fairly thick and fine-bubbled tan head that leaves some substantial, if not persistent, lacing. Flavor is fabulous - fine roast coffee, sweet chocolate, molasses, and a hint of hops. The sweetness is not cloying or overpowering, and the touch of hop bitterness balances this nicely. Lively texture is quite fizzy and leaves behind a good tingle, along with molasses sweetness and a little hop bitterness."
"D- this is one of my favorite offerings for them and on draft is fucking awesome. No sign of the abv and for a much flavor and as big as it is this pint will be no problem."
"Another nice tap sighting out here in the 'Burbs. It pours a deep obsidian topped by a finger of light brown foam. The nose comprises wheat, oats, grass, very light chocolate, flowers, and light honey. The taste holds notes of roasted malts, light chocolate syrup, toasted oats, vanilla, and a hint of tobacco somewhere in the back. The body is a light heavy, with a light carbonation and a chewy feel. Overall, a very nice and tasty bit o' stout. Another win for ST."
"would drink again"
"This beer pours a blackness that no color is anywhere near. Finger of head that is a pretty sandy brown. The smell of this beer is rather odd. The smell is of ash (smokey char), chocolate and booze. This beer tastes mostly of the booze, it's possible I missed the oat on the nose, but my palate distinctly noticed it missing here. There is a caramel and chocolate flavor that does work rather well. Odd mouthfeel to be as smooth as it is with all the burnt remnants involved on the palate. Overall it has some very good characteristics and some ones that I don't like very much. I suppose this beer comes down to personal palate. I wouldn't dissuade anyone from having it."
"Pours black with a very thin tan head. Aroma of chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee. The flavor has burnt coffee, milk chocolate, roasted malt, and alcohol. Full bodied with low carbonation, kind of syrupy mouthfeel and very boozy. Tasty, but the high alcohol limits the drinkability."
"D: Great, easy drinking imperial stout. Maybe my favorite of the BlackWater Series. Loved this on draft and the bottle is not letting me down in the slightest"
"Overall the thing that stood out most about this beer was the mouthfeel - until I found out that it is 11% ABV. A flavorful beer that is not quite over the top and does a very good job of masking the alcohol. Well worth a shot."
"D-well i don't believe this is 11%. i couldn't taste the alcohol at all. it went down so easily and i hardly feel it at all. taste stays great all the way through. a bomber can easily be finished by yourself."
"Pours nearly black with a light mocha head without too much retention. Nose brings forward some chocolate, light espresso, and roasted malt and oats. The taste is a bit harsh with some booze as well as a lot of roasted character. Feel is heavy and a bit boozy. As is often the case with this series, the beer shows promise but gets to be a bit much with more than a few ounces."
"Notes: full bodied and full flavored. very well done. i like how there isnt a really strong bitter roast flavor like with Dark Horse One (though that is an excellent OS). spectacular!"
"Quality imp stout, which isn't overly sweet and avoids too much heat despite higher alcohol content."
"Pours a solid black with no head, looks like heavily used lightweight motor oil. Aroma is smooth and sweet, tons of malt with notes of chocolate and molasses. Taste is dominated by malt, oatmeal and chocolate malts are prominent. The taste is not even remotely bitter, it is a refined sludge of several malts that highlights chocolate and molasses. Great mouthfeel, very full and smooth while being extra thick - also extremely drinkable due to the near lack of bitterness."
"Creamy smooth, roasted, chocolately taste with just enough of a presence of alcohol to know it's there. Sweet sugary/caramel scent that also hinted at the ABV. Not much more to say except it was an excellent, uncarbonated experience to have with an Imperial Oatmeal Stout."
"Bottle. Pours a solid black with a creamy, tan head. Lots of chocolate, roasted malts, and oats. Wonderful smell with a taste to match. Full body with a rich, smooth mouthfeel. I could definitely drink this with breakfast. If I could only find a way to make my coffee pot brew one cup of beer at a time."
"D: it drank really good considering the boozy character but IMO was thin for the style; it was still tasty."
"Thick and potent...still, it aged better than I thought it would. It's a sipper, but not as boozy tasting as the aroma lead me to believe. Tasty..."
"drinkability is very good for the strength. thought it would be a sipper, but it's a drinker."
"this is a stout i find myself going back to consistently and out of all the southern tier blackwater beers it is by far by favorite."
"Despite the sweetness a nice beer. Most suited as dessert. Wonder how it goes with vanilla ice-cream? Tasted at a beer sampling at De Klomp, Linköping, Sweden."
"It's not often you find an Imperial Oatmeal Stout, but I'm happy to see it. I like the heartiness and depth of the malt, but would like to see more oatmeal creaminess in lieu of the hop bitterness."
"D: Very goood. Not sure when or what I would drink this with, but like it says on the bottle, ""it's a meal in itself."""
"22oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Poured black, ""as dark as a moonless night"" as it says on the bottle, with a small, dark tan head. It smelled like oak, chocolate, espresso, sugar, caramel. The taste was loaded with sweetness and chocolate with some vanilla, caramel, oak and espresso with some oats to smooth it out. It was like a liquid candy, but smooth. There's some hidden hops at the back end. The mouthfeel was thick like motor oil, after all, it's 28o Plato. This is what I see as definition of a dessert beer - something that goes great with chocolate, heavy, and something that should be slow sipped. I couldn't go much faster than slow sipping anyway because it was so sweet. This was like a smoother, less vanilla-y, somewhat less sweet version of their Creme Brulee."
"D= Pretty decent beer. This isn't a top impy stout by any means but for an oat based Impy stout it's not bad at all. Worth trying to get the oat flavor and possibly to try again."
"Overall, a very good beer. Worth seeking out."
"D-- Very much a slow drinker and only one is needed. Good smell but very sweet and too many touches of booze in this. Really needs something to offset all the sweetness and the hops only distract me for short periods in this before the alcoholic brandy taste kicks in. Low drinkability due to the sweetness and the ABV being noticeable very quickly. Honestly I should have let this sit in the cellar for a while longer."
"Overall: Overall I enjoyed the beer. I thought it smelled great and delivered on the taste. I would recommend this to any dark beer/imperial stout drinkers."
"Bottle courtesy daknole. Pours a darkish brown color with a small tan head. Smells like that instant oatmeal that comes in pouches with a heap of maple powder inside. That, and booze. Flavor is roasted coffee and sweeter chocolatey notes, pretty standard. Loses the oatiness in the flavor but the body is almost chewable from it. Not really jumping out of my shoes at this one."
"This is a very nice little stout, which I enjoyed side-by-side with the chokolat so it was a bit outshined, but is none-the-less a good, more normal, balanced beer."
"D- I was not a fan of this. Way too much of an alcohol flavor, and not enough of the good qualities you get from stouts. I'm aware its a double and not a RIS..but still. Very disappointing."
"D: A solidly drinkable beer."
"Very smooth mouthfeel, even with the 11% ABV this is quite nice to drink."
"This is one hell of an imperial stout. Savor and sip, enjoy this excellent stout."
"This is a nice creamy big brew. Those who aren't into big brews need not apply. Thick and long lasting flavors - I like it, I like it, I like it..."
"The beer pours a dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the roasted malt and chocolate. The flavor is great, with roasted malt and chocolate up front as well as some burnt malt. You also get some oat flavor as well as the creaminess in the mouthfeel that you expect from oats. The alcohol is very well hidden in the beer. Thick mouthfeel and low carbonation. A very nice imperial stout."
"Overall, a very tasty, very drinkable stout. I look forward to having this one again."
"First of all my bottle states that this brew is 11%ABV and looks exactly the same as this bottle displayed with some different highlights on the label,the brew pours a thick crude oil colour with no light let thru whatsoever and leaves a two finger mocha laced head and a rim of creamy coffee lacing,the smell is a combination of aromas of brown sugar,bourbon,dark caramel and toffee soaked in alcohol,it has a syrupy silky light carbonated mouthfeel with hints of dark expresso,caramel,dark berries and blackforrest cake,overall a very nice desert brew that is very easy to drink with its ABV well hidden and would definately buy again."
"A very good stout overall, one I wouldn't mind revisiting. ABV is well-hidden, and it's not undrinkable despite the sweetness."
"Was actually glad I talked myself into getting this one."
"D: Amazing. It's not as sweet as Choklat, which is good depending on what you are after. I only wish it were cheaper."
"Drinkability: The richness and the high abv challenge me a bit."
"d - Pretty good smell but I thought the alcohol was a bit too much in the taste. I felt as though it dominated some of the other flavors, and it definitely felt the 11% ABV it says it is. Would like to try again perhaps after some cellaring."
"Good, but like most Southern Tier stouts, this is something to share with a lot of people."
"650ml bottle at Chancey Smith's. Midnight black in colour with three fingers of foamy brown head and speckles of lacing on the tulip. Smell and taste are burnt grains, roasted malt, flaked oats, coffee, tobacco, bitter hops, and a smokey, charred finish. Alcohol is noticeable and provides a bit of heat, but doesn't detract from the flavour. Full-bodied mouth feel is chocolaty, though not sweet. Chewy and oily in the body with a dry and astringent aftertaste. A complex and enjoyable stout to be savoured over an evening."
"Pours a black color. 1/7 inch head of a tan color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, chocolate, oat, slight tart malt, and a hint of dark citrus. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a low carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, oat, sweet malt, slight chocolate, slight roasted malt, and a hint of dark citrus. Overall, good body, blend, complexity."
"O: This is really sweet, but good at the same time. There's a good balance of sweet up front with a nice bitter dry finish. This is definitely worth trying."
"Drinks big and black without the added coffee explosion of the Java. The thick mouthfeel is a ST trademark style and it really works for this beer. I slowed right down to really enjoy every last sip of this wonderful Impy. Can't decide whether I like this or the Java more but both are excellent"
"not my favorite imperial stout in ST's blackwater series, but stil a very good and complex imperial stout"
"BTW mine clearly says 11% ABV."
"Drinkability: Wow, a big beer here. Tasty and goes down easy, pleasant for a night cap but alas I have more in store for tonight. Good beer from Southern Tier once again."
"D: Fruit and smoke dominate a bit much, and I was expecting a good amount of oat, which really gets overshadowed. For an imperial stout, it's quite easygoing, and the booze is not overwhelming, but I really wanted some more oat."
"Bottle says 11% ABV, rather than the stated 9.6%. Definately drinks like the lower ABV though...hard to sip this one...I just want more, more, more! This sucker sure is filling though...."
"Picked up a bomber from Abe's Cold Beer and shared it with a couple friends. It poured pitch black with a short tan head. This is by far one of the smoothest impy stouts I've had. I'd give a higher MF score, but as the beer warmest a lot of alcohol came forward. Otherwise the flavor is a big, rich mix of candied cocoa with a little mocha around the edge. It reminds me of Sam Smith's oatmeal stout on steroids."
"Delicious dark smoked malts, very much exaggerated here. As with the smell, an oatmeal stout on steroids. Not sure the 11% is needed here to make the super oatmeal stout flavor. Higher alcohol should only be used as needed to give more availability for flavor. I think this could have been done with less alcohol allowing fans to drink a bit more. Not as flavorful as the Creme Brulee with similar ABV."
"Pretty good beer, & mostly recommended for the insane clown posse of its smoooth moves. And get rid of that damn horse!"
"Quite drinkable, though the alcohol presence might make it a little slow work to get through a bomber. I might just recap the thing, though that has more to do with the time of night than the enjoyability of the beer."
"great oatmeal stout a step up from others of it's style .a rich sipper that you will enjoy drinking slowly. great winter warmer .cheers..!!"
"OVERALL: Fantastic in the mouth, a little average before it got there. One that needs a little more aroma to bring it up a notch. Non-the-less, there's no denying that it's one tasty great-feeling treat for sure. One I'll be grabbing again if I see it. Recommended."
"This beer is poured a black opaque color, with a thin caramel colored head, that quickly dissolves away. A sweet and sugary scent at the start with touches of dark bread and dried fruit. The taste comes with the sweet oats at the front, followed by hearty flavors of malt, chocolate, and coffee. Dried fruit and bread start to come through midway, then it finishes with a grassy and citrus bitterness, that lingers on the palate for some time. A skim milk texture at the start, then it gradually gains weight to become more full bodied, more of a two percent milk feel. The back of the palate is left very dry and tacky. Overall this beer has a beautiful look, though the head was sub-par. A solid aroma and taste, with a thick and rich feel, make this a nice night cap offering."
"this is a textbook example of someone trying too hard on a beer that they just weren't prepared to make. the oatmeal was a good idea, but it was poorly implemented, and the entire beer is just a hodge-podge of mediocrity and crappyness. I have no idea why this is so highly rated, this beer is a perfect example of what is wrong with Big Beers brewed simply for the sake of being Big, not for the sake of making beer worth drinking."
"Drinkability: This is a tasty, huge beer with a pretty well hidden 11%. I whine about the bitterness, and I do think its a little bitter, but all in all, a really nice imperial oatmeal stout."
"Splendid."
"Pours black as hell. Very dark. Almost zero head, even with a vigorous pour. Smell is a bit boozy to me, some sweetness, a bit of roasted malt, some coffee too. Not my favorite smell, alcohol is definitely there. Taste is good, but definitely not one to be had cold--too hot. Some sweet oat notes, booze, some good piney and earthy notes, a bit of chocolate. MF is thin, not creamy, way under-carbonated for me. Drinkability is ok, decent, big alcohol (says it's 11%, not 9.6%). Overall, an ok beer, give me an Iniquity or Pumking instead. Too hot, could use some age on it."
"D: A heavy drinking stout, but roasty and tasty. Finish is a little strange and harsh but it's full bodied and flavorful."
"Overall this beer was a decent Imperial Stout from Southern Tier, but Choklat blows this one out of the water. Interesting take on an Oat Imperial Stout and one I will revisit again to see if I can get a better grasp on what exactly makes up this unique flavor profile. Recommend"
"A deep brown black fluid with a light brown head. Nice lace and good retention. A deep rich aroma of chocolate and roasted grains. Charcoal and burnt sugar. Molasses is a big feature. Taste is rich with chocolate and caramel malts. Oats a a mellow binding facet. Coffee and faint charcoal in the finish. A full and creamy feel that blends into a somewhat slick and lightly syrupy touch. Carbonation breaks it up nicely and lets it flow like honey down your throat. Quite drinkable for the abv as it never shows itself until too late."
"Taste more than makes up for the appearance and smell shortcomings, as this is a very tasty beer. Low carbonation and viscous mouthfeel are very nice. Oatmeal makes the brew oh-so creamy and the ABV is extremely well hidden yet still incorporated into the flavor. Hint of roasty coffee and the black licorice is still there. Amazingly smooth big beer, I like it!"
" Drinkability is low, however, due to the heaviness and very high alcohol percentage."
"D - Deceptively potent. Flavors are well integrated, smooth. Easy drinking. ABV would sneak up on you. A good single session beer, not to be taken lightly."
"Pretty good and very flavorful..A nice wallop at 11% alcohol too."
"Overall: I'm happy with this beer, but way too expensive. Over $10 per bottle, I'd probably rather have a Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. They're extremely similar, but this stuff is really nice."
"Well worth having."
"It is well balanced, quite pleasant, very easy to drink, with tradiitional oatmeal stout taste, but for whatever reason, the combination of chocolate, oatmeal and sweet coffee lacks a bit of a kick."
"D - This one weighs in at 11% and I was happy to be sharing it with someone else...I've had better oatmeal stouts and I was expecting more coming from Southern Tier...this one doesn't stand up to their other imperial stouts"
"Pours a nice deep dark brown color almost like a cola with a slight khaki colored head. The aroma is of alcohol, but also some chocolate, coffee, raisins, and yes a little oat, as well as a roasted malt. The taste is a roasted malt backbone, but there is also a good chocolate note, faint coffee, and a slight oatmeal taste at the end. The mouthfeel is of slight carbonation and is silky. The drinkability is good, your not going to pound them, but you can sit and sip a couple or more of these."
"22 oz bottle that says 11% on the label, rather than the 9.6% listed here on BA. Deep, dark and luscious looking with a thick tan head.. Poured into my very large snifter and the aroma coming off this thing is very strong. Once you get past the alcohol on the nose, this opens up to give off some great aromas. Caramel, dry fruits and even a banana aroma? Maybe it's just me. Coffee and chocolate of course, and a hint of oats. Tastes of bitter chocolate and cold coffee. A little astringent, needs a bit more malt to smooth it out. It may be the heat of the alcohol that is contributing to the bitterness. Could certainly see this aging well. Very creamy on the mouthfeel, the Blackwater Series all seem to have great mouthfeel. Too boozy to be drinkable, sip it slow and enjoy!"
"D - This is a pretty good Imperial Stout. The ABV is sneaky...watch out"
"d: Did I get a mislabeled Choklat? This did remind me of Choklat which I scored much higher. Why? Truth in advertising I guess. This was good, 6 ounces at a time. It just wasn't what I expected."
"CHEERS!!"
"The beer is a deep black color with a short brown head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass. The aroma is of dark chocolate, roasted oats, dark malts, some alcohol and a touch of hops. The taste is malty and very creamy up front with strong flavors of roasted oats and dark chocolate. There are background flavors of coffee and dark fruit. There's a mild but complimentary hops presence and there's very little trace of the 12.50% ABV. The after-taste is slightly sweet. Crisp and very smooth but kind of slick due to the heavy viscosity, heavy body, light-to-medium carbonation, finish is sticky."
"D - I remember liking this much more out of the bottle. While this was still a good stout, I think it was a tad green. It certainly didn't weigh up to Mokah, Choklat or Jahva. Perhaps it just needed some age."
"Pours a deep brown color with a generous chocolate head that diminishes quickly, leaving a little lacing. Aroma is of roasted malt oatmeal and caramel. Chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla and oatmeal flavor. Good mouthfeel. Slightly carbonated. Nice finish"
"D: bomber down in 20 solo and enjoyed"
"Not only will this beer fall to the bottom of my list, but it makes me second guess the brewery just a bit."
"Overall - An enjoyable beer that is most notable for the silky smooth mouthfeel and then the rich chocolate flavors. Plan to split this with at least one other person."
"D: Definitely one to split with someone else. The sweetness was a bit cloying at times which I have found to be normal for the southern tier black water series"
"Black in body with cinnamon head. Weak aroma of oats and alcohol. A great taste of oats, malt, slight roast, milk chocolate, alcohol. Heavy body with a lingering malty sweet aftertaste. The alcohol isn't obnoxious but hides in the back of your head. A very nicely done heavy ale."
"Conclusion: The chocolately flavors are really nice, but the booze is a bit hot and a lack of complexity keeps this from being truly great."
"Served with a nice fine, foamy, thick, creamy, tan head and some lace. Color is an opaque dark brownish black. Aroma is malty, toffee, chocolate, molasses, and dark ripe fruit. Flavor's about the same. The molasses and dark ripe fruits stand out, to the beer's detriment, I feel. Body is decent and so is carbonation. Finish is long and has a flavor with a boozy warmth."
"D- Very drinkable for 11% ABV... the alcohol is quite hidden. While I enjoyed a sample of this beer, the roastiness could very easily become overpowering for me... and for this reason, I think I'll make sure to have at least two other friends available to split the next bottle."
"Overall, a good beer that I think would be even better with some age to tone down the alcohol and to let the other flavors develop. Still rather good though and I do recommend. Rotation: not avail in TX (got in a trade). Will probably seek out another for cellaring and see if worth doing more after that."
"Drinkability is not the number one trait of this beer, with the 11.0% ABV hitting the head and chest hard and the heavy-handed bitterness storming the palate, but this is nevertheless a wonderful and complex brew that could certainly stand up to some aging. The creamy characteristics typical of oatmeal stouts are unable to truly present themselves here thanks to the ale's weightiness, but this certainly doesn't detract from the overall appeal of this black beauty; undoubtedly, underneath and though undetectable, it serves its purpose well and only enhances the depth of this creation."
"D: At almost 10% abv this is a great winter warmer. I'm just sitting around with my imperial pint glass relaxing after dinner, and this is beer is certainly working for me right now. It is also nicely improving as it warms up. Now it is even finishing with a slight warming alcohol bite that was masked by the oats when I first poured it."
"Drinkability: Very good. I'd find this one again."
"My experience went downhill after the aroma. I am very disappointed in this VERY bitter Imperial Stout."
"O: Great beer. Might be even better if the -OH mellows with age. Going to put some away."
"I would love to try a version of this that has truly been barrel-aged. Add a little more head and a little more complexity and we might have a big winner here. Otherwise, the drinkability characteristic will still keep it on the list of recommended stouts."
"Drinks pretty easy for the style & abv, another great dark bruiser from Southern Tier"
"Drinkability: holy high alcohol content, Batman! 11%? where is it? I didn't taste it at all. This beer is, like many other oatmeal stouts, quite filling. I wouldn't drink more than two in a sitting...but it is quite tasty!"
"Pretty easy drinking. Not as heavy as some double stouts. Great coffee flavor if your into that. Just lacks in depth and complexity for the style. Maybe it's just the age on it. Nicely priced though compared to others in the style."
"Drinkability: A good and solid, but not great oatmeal stout. Because of the high abv, one per sitting is the absolute max. This is a sipper. It hits the flavors just right, but I was not as blown away by this one as other Southern Tier beers."
"Sometimes I just think people like to hate Southern Tier based on the fact that they make very unconventinal and unique beers. This is one of their more mainstream efforts, but it is nothing short of great. Age definetly adds to the greatness. Another Southern Tier classic."
"Drinkability: Actually pretty easy to drink despite the 11%. However, it is a little simple for an Imperial Stout and definitely too boozy. Actually, every ST Imperial beer I have had is too boozy. I don't think it is worth paying for them anymore."
"Not all that drinkable because of the alchol, but I would like to finsih the bomber tonight. We'll see..."
"Notes: There are better examples of the style out there. Southern Tier remains a good brewery as my recent rating of Unearthly and more remotely Pumking will atest."
"Pours dark brown and nearly black with a modest amount of head that disappears quickly. It tastes of sweet malts with some chocolate and coffee. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly creamy. I really enjoy drinking this one and will purchase again."
"The feel of this beer pretty easy drinking and has a medium body to it. This does have a bit of a kick but it an Imperial Oatmeal Stout. A really great beer."
"M/D: Very viscous yet smooth. Alcohol comes on a bit strong, taking away from the drinkability."
"Under-rated."
"Pretty darn delicious overall. And again, I'm not a stout guy."
"drinkability is crazy even with the 11%abv - this is one of the better impy stouts i have had in a while"
"Overall a remarkable beer. The mouth feel is very silky and creamy, but not too syrupy and viscous. The alcohol packs a punch but is still well hidden. Chalk another one up to Southern Tier."
"D- Nice roasted flavor with a well hidden alcohol burn. Worth getting again."
"Drinkability is quite nice, though the alcohol is still certainly there. This isn't even close to some of the fire-breathing dragons that some RIS' are, but it's still packing a bit of heat."
"This is an excellent interpretation, and my one real criticism is the same one that applies to all Southern Tier's bigger beers - after a while the sweetness starts to become too much. in fact this would have been excellent in a two-thirds pint glass. Nonetheless, another impressive stout from the blackwater series."
"D: Deeply enjoyable but most definitely a sipper and really heavy enough so that its one and done."
"Drinkability: I would have this again but on another night because of the high abv and I definitely recommend this to try."
"Tastes of candied dark fruits, candi sugar, dark roasted coffee doctored with loads of sugar. Quite sweet, but lots of highly roasted malts in the background, and plenty of tasty dark fruits and a bit of ester to go along. Very tasty. If you like sugar with your coffee, you will like this. If you take it black, maybe not. Full bodied, not the thickest beer, but the oats make it super slick on the palate. A treat. For me this is a great drinking stout, as I can take mine dry or sweet, in this case a bit sweet, but plenty of balance still. Yum. Question: why haven't I ever had barrel aged Southern Tier?"
"This is rich as a stout should be and malty. The mouthfeel is full, rich, and creamy. Nicely carbonated. This is a nice drinkable stout."
"Bottled in Fall 2008. This poured an opaque dark mahogany with a bit of tan head. It smelled like roasted barley and dark chocolate and molasses, with some coffee and toasted oats and a bit of dark cherry. It tasted like roasted coffee and bitter chocolate, with some molasses and burnt barley. It was thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this wasn't as sweet or have as much oat flavor as I expected (perhaps due to almost a year of age?), but it still had an easily enjoyable flavor. The body was great, and it hid the alcohol very well, so it was definitely easy to drink. Nothing too special, but still a nice solid imperial stout."
"D: Very drinkable for the 11% ABV and thickness. However, it was definitely better split with friends than trying to finish the whole bomber."
"This is the best southern tier beer I've had. An extremely smooth beer. It's not too sweet, inspite of being on the low IBU side of things. I have to think it's tough to make a really balanced beer like this; they are either way too sweet (the greater sin) or too bitter. This is perfect. There was hardly any head despite the clean goblet and correct technique. Carbonation feels perfect - strange... I thought oats are known to help with head retention."
"pored black into the glass almost no head or lace but a total pitch black color. aromas of smoky charcoal, strong coffee, alcohol, all very strong in the nose. taste is complex, sweet, smoky, extremely smooth, chewy full body mouthfeel, taste becomes even stronger as it warms. alcohol warms and blends well with the overall taste. definitely look for it its a great tasting beer."
"The mouth is silky smooth and creamy. Hints of carbonation-bite tickle the tongue, but overall, she's creamy. There's a sharp twang on the first few sips, reminding me of sourdough bread. This gives way to a nice bitter espresso mixed with creamy oats and chocolate flavor that is splendid. The alcohol presence is still quite there after a few years in the cellar. I'm feeling happily buzzed halfway through this bomber. Very good stout. Get some if available."
"This is an awesome brew. Tons of flavor and character, truly enjoyable, but the abv will keep me at one bomber in a night."
"This is a fantastic example of a style I am very fond of. Excellent!"
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. This is from the first vintage - 2007. Appears an opaque dark brown color with about two fingers of dark ecru foam. The foam settles to a thin creamy layer within a few minutes. Aroma and flavor consist of rich roasted grains, both bittersweet and creamy milk chocolate, medium roasted coffee beans, sweet caramelized malt, notes of mild vanilla, alcohol has subsided nicely. Approaching full bodied and somewhat chewy with ample carbonation. Really decent drinkability, richness be damned."
"Pretty well balanced for an oatmeal stout. The only downside lies in the ABV, and the fact that anything this sweet or rich could become overwhelming after too much."
"Drinkability: Moderate - the taste is great and it is very full-bodied. The alcohol content and its sharpness slow it down."
"Drinkability: I'm really enjoying this beer - it's a heavier one so I wouldn't want to drink a ton in a night, but splitting a bomber is just about right. ABV is a little high as well and would probably be a factor. So while it's great in a lot of other areas, weight and 11% will knock this down a little bit."
"I would very much enjoy this with an ice cream sandwich."
"D--Very easy to drink for an 11% ABV brew. A little bit more flavor could have easily pushed the drinkability to a 5 rating...but that's not an easy task for such a high alcohol beer."
"That's one beer down in the Third Unorganized Invite (T.U.I.), and hopefully the upcoming competition meets my high expectations."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very very dark coffe black with a brown thin big bubble head. Aroma was slightly sugary sweet, with roasted grains. Flavor was sweet, a bit milky sweet, almost like a milk/cream stout. No noticeable oatmeal/grain flavors, hence a lower score. Felt great in the mouth. Coated very well, clung to the mouth perfectly. Very easy to drink, went down well."
"This is a good example of a beer that will mellow with age and actually taste better if aged properly. It's very nice and can be enjoyed in any weather (my opinion)."
"Definatly an exceptional brew, even moreso with a little age."
"What can I say, this Oat Imperial Stout is my new best friend, and I'd recommend it to anyone seeking a replacement safety blanket, a constant regular in their fridge, and even breaking protocol would make an excellent session ale in moderation. Most certainly greater than the sum of its parts, however it works beautifully."
"Pours a dark brown in color, nice inch and a half head and stellar lacing. Smells are of caramelized malts, that there oat (grainy), earthy tones of soil. Taste is more caramel and oat than anything, roasted malt all the way. Almost full bodied in nature, the ABV is noticeable throughout, nicely carbonated and stickiness lingering between gulps. Drinkability is right on if you like em big. Glad I got to sample a pint..."
"This double stout is like an oatmeal stout on steroids - not that there's anything wrong with that . Hitting the spot as dessert after some homemade pizza. This is a big beer, so I wouldn't consider sessioning it, but I'm enjoying the hell out of drinking it, and wouldn't hesitate to buy it again to drink as a dessert or nightcap"
"Drinkability: A tasty Imperial Stout that glides across one's palette with sheer ease, though the grotesque hedonist in me is left yearning for a bottle of Choklat, oooh, or even their new Mokah. Still, it's one I recommend."
"This is a great company and I really like their stouts. Pours a dark dark black color yet nice and smooth. It smells of coffee and oatmeal. The taste is very rich and you taste the fullness of the oats. A great beer to sip on. One of the best stouts I've had thus far"
"Overall it's a very drinkable beer if youre looking for a thick smokey stout."
"Slow sipper, but nicely drinkable. Not quite as deep and complex as some others."
"A fantastic beer from Southern Tier. The Imperial Oat pours very dark with little white head, and very nice lacing on the glass. (Poured into a brandy snifter.) The aroma was heavy on chocolate and coffee, with hints of vanilla, caramel and oatmeal. The flavors work your way through the palate with dark fruits, oatmeal, coffee, chocolate, and a tinge of sweetness. Southern Tier does a great job with their seasonal bottles and this is one that I think goes above and beyond the expectations. Great beer!"
"Southern Tier's got a big time winner with Oat. I had moderate expectations, but it blew past them. I was slightly let down by the recent Krampus and Iniquity releases, but this one's easily better. It's everything anyone could want in a big Oatmeal Stout. The only gripe I have is that it doesn't feel as big as it is. Beef up that body a little. Nonetheless, this is one monster stout. Highly recommended."
"Tastes thick sweet with strong hop grassya nd noticable alcohol burn. Carbonation is much stronger in the mouth than during the pour. Malt flavor is burnt and some coffee. Hopsa are grassy and blend with a vodka-like alcohol. Some hop blackberry flavor, so I'd guess Norther Brewer. Syrupy sweet aftertaste with some rubbing alcohol. Thick body. Not very drinkable."
" As with Jahva and Choklat, Oat is the perfect liquid embodiment of it's name. It's oats, cocoa, malt, coffee in perfcet balance. I really can't get over the great actual musty oat flavor in the beer. Same as the other two in the series, I couldn't ask for a more perfect beer based on the one-word name. Southern Tier has astounded me time and time again, and I am scoring based not only on the pure enjoyment I experienced form this beer, but my admiration for the talent of these guys as hopeful future brewer myself. Prost!"
"D: A little on the low side for me, the 11% ABV combined with the dryness of the brew really limit it on the drinkability. Overall, a good beer, just not great for the style. Skal."
"Pours a one finger tan head that fades slowly to a thin layer, leaving some lace. Black color, no highlights. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Chocolate nose. Flavor is sweet chocolate, oats and some caramel. Smooth, hints of baker's chocolate at finish. High ABV is hidden. $8.95 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Pours a rich, dark brown in color with just a little head showing. Not a whole lot going on in the nose, but WOW, Southern Tier has nailed the perfect mouthfeel. This is thick, roasty, creamy and easy drinking. This is so thick it's borderline chewy. This beer is very well done. Didn't even notice the alcohol til about two thirds of the way through the bottle. I started to get that warming sensation at about that time. They used oats in abundance in this thing. Plenty in the taste as well as roasted malts and plenty of bakers chocolate. Southern Tier is doing very well with their ""Big Beer"" series. Keep up the good work."
"This is an excellent beer. Cleanly fermented, rich, and huge, however the sweetness makes it more of a dessert beer that should be slowly savored unlike other RIS's that can be drank at a normal pace. I would prefer it if the bitterness remained the same, and I feel that the amount of flavor and aroma hops are detrimental to it's flavor. However, as those mellow over time, it should improve. Why not just brew it without and make it more drinkable to begin with? Recommended."
"Huge body makes it a little less drinkable, not my favorite, but certainly good."
"mouthfeel is good here and i would even say the drinkability is above average even for being an imperial series."
"Overall - A fine stout. Stouts are not my favorite brews, but if I'm ever feeling like a strong, dark brew that I know I'll like, I'll reach for this one."
"Drinkability: Very high drinkability. I could make a night of only this beer. Absolutely delicious!"
"D-I like this beer. I finished the bomber myself and could definitely tell that this one is 11% abv. Regardless, it's a very enjoyable beer that I look forward to having again (though maybe with a friend, next time)."
"D: For such a big beer, thi drinks pretty easily. A beer with such an ABV seems like it would just kill you, but it really does go down easy. All points of this beer are right on point and that flavor is damned near perfect with its pretty traditional flare. I can really see why Boompah loved this beer when he enjoyed this as his nightcap. It does have a sweetness to it, but its not just a dessert beer. Just fantastic. Prost to you, Boompah."
"All in all nothing that breaks the mold of a good Imperial stout, but a very well crafted offering from southern tier none the less."
"D: super tasty and enjoyable. 12.5% ABV is incredibly dangerous."
"At first glance I thought this would be a typical overdone big American stout but it turned out to be a real treat. To be sipped and savored."
"Very well balanced complex stout. This is a standout beer."
"drinkability: i could drink this so fast i have to watch myself. i don't know the availability of this beer, but i hope it is yearlong because i can see drinking this easily in the summer as dark beers go. 11%?? sure goes down smooth"
"I still can't make any real complaints about the beer (unless you count ""it drinks too easily because it's so smooth and tasty"" a complaint). Southern Tier has accustomed me to super decadent, ultra rich beers (see: Choklat, Creme Brulee) so I naturally was expecting something a little heartier, a little more bold, a little more ""hoarse"" shall we say? Instead, I received perhaps the most composed, smooth and sessionable 11% beer in recent memory."
"It's not often to find an Imperial Oatmeal Stout, but I'm happy to see it. I like the heartiness and depth of the malt, but would like to see more oatmeal creaminess in lieu of the hop bitterness."
"Drinkability is high for me, particularly for the style. A nice roast without being overly bitter or acrid, the high ABV (11.0% ABV on my batch) is very well hidden, and it goes down pretty easy."
"Another solid entry from Southern Tier(who is always pushing the envelope in this blackwater series) & my 2nd favorite in this line up under choklat."
"Overall impression: Another good entry from Southern Tier. They are three-for-three with me now. This would probably be my least favorite of the three (Choklat and Hoppe being the other two), but it is still a solid oatmeal stout and worth seeking out."
"Notes: This is top-notch brew in my book. Insane amount of delicious flavor, enough complexity to keep it interesting, and a mouthfeel that's out of this world! Damn, I wish Southern Tier would expand their distribution out to CA so I could try the rest of their line. If they're anything like this, I would love to have a stockpile in my refrigerator. Highly recommended"
"Taste of dark chocolate and espresso. Nice warming alcohol on the back end as it goes down. Very heave mouthfeel that feels great as it wonders and is chewed. Drinkability is amazingly high for a 12.5% ABV. No doubt about it that this one is terrific choice for a cold blustery winter day."
"Drinkability - for an 11% brew, this is unbelievably drinkable. Fresh, it is phenomenal; aged - we'll see, but not anytime soon. A fine beer to toast the Steelers in their Superbowl XLIII win. Well done guys."
"meh..."
"Overall drinkability was quite good - this beer was delicious. Mentally I'd definitely continue on with a second at the conclusion, but this big beer was a tad filling."
"Solid example of the style, and one that I would seek out were it more available on the west coast. ST makes some damn good beer."
"D: ABV very well hidden. Sure, it's there but it doesn't overpower or make you sip this brew too much. Again, surprisingly light body given the nature/style of this beer. An excellent offering."
"I can't wait till this beer joins the other Southern Tier brews already available here. Nice beer. Worth seeking out ."
"Now to taste. Rich, dry chocolate covers the palate, followed by smoky burnt malt, with a similar bite to scotch ales. If you can stay with me, the mouth feel is very ashy, and has some pleasant bitterness. The alcohol sticks around, but isn't anything too powerful. Sum it up with dried fruit and an unbelievable light clean finish and you have yourself one of the best new imperial stouts I've had the pleasure of consuming. Seems the southern tier is getting raised higher and higher."
"D - Possibly my favorite oatmeal stout, which is why it gets the 5 for taste"
"Very enjoyable Imp. Stout. Probably my favorite from Southern Tier so far. Bottle says 11% abv, so watch out."
"Another brewer that I wish was distributed here in GA. What a great beer."
"This is an extremely drinkable brew. So super smooth and easy to drink. Highly recommended, if you've not had it, yet."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, a little filling, very strong kick, good representation of style, this one definitely falls into the sipper category because of its heaviness and high ABV, but a pretty good beer overall."
"D-To sweet for me to drink all the time but would be a good alternitive to not being able to get the creme' brulee very often and is much more drinkable than it."
"D - Pretty easy to drink and enjoyable for the high ABV. But I not what I would expect out of an imperial oatmeal stout"
"Woody brown in the light as it's poured into a 22 oz. glass. Black with a dark brown glint at the edge. A finger of tan mocha foam, dense and chocolatey. Spindly ring of lace is draped inside the glass. Roasty with a sweet whiff of alcohol. This hides it's abv, but it still shows around the edges. Ashy char and tobacco meets bitter dark chocolate, with a silky texture that seals the deal. Rich lactic feel, mild fusel note that fades fast. Overall a definite winter sipper..."
"M/D - This is one of the thickest RISs I've seen with a great mouthfeel. Being over a year old it still had decent heat on with the high abv."
"I'm not a Southern Tier groupie, but this beer works on some levels. Price was more reasonable on the jug($14) vs. the $7-8-9 that place places charge for 22oz bottles."
"22 ounce bottle from fall 2008. Served in a snifter, the beer pours black with about a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are average. It smells like roasted/burnt malt, coffee, oats, bittersweet chocolate and some molasses. The taste is similar to the aroma, but I also can taste a bit of dark fruit too. Nice mix between sweet and bitter flavors, and it has a dry finish. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's rich, smooth and creamy with good carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it's very easy and enjoyable to drink even with the high ABV. It's probably a sipping beer, but it was hard for me to enjoy this one slowly since I liked it so much. Overall I think this is a pretty good brew, I'd definitely buy this again."
"Although the alcohol is noticeable and gives a nice warming sensation, the alcohol isnt too powerful or powerful enough to ruin the beer. A beer to be slowly sipped for sure, and one that is quite enjoyable."
"(rated Feb 5, 2008)"
"Dark brown pour, but becomes black in the tulip glass, absolutely no head or lacing. Yeah,it's dark, but there's not much else going for it. Aroma of alcohol, charred barley, light smokiness, and coffee, but it's so light, it might as well not be there. Flavor is smokey, hints of dark chocolate, coffee, burnt caramel, nice bitterness, astringent flavors, and alcohol. Big alcohol warming on the tongue and in the throat. This brew is medium bodied and just can't hold up the the high ABV. I'm somewhat disappointed in this beer. Alcohol is out of control. I was expecting a lot more, especially coming out of this brewery."
"22oz bottle courtesy of vwcraig. Bottle says this was brewed in fall of 2007. It smells like it has held up well, sweet stout notes and a little alcohol. The flavor is some chocolate, more stout, no roast or oat but a good beer nonetheless. The only thing I don;t care for is the high ABV, I prefer beers to be under 10%"
"Drinkability: not the most easy drinking Oatmeal Stout out there, but this beer is packed to the ceiling with a ton of delicious roasted flavors. Be careful with this one. It's a sipper. Would I ever drink this Southern Tier beer again. I sure would!"
"drinkability- this is everything an imperial oatmeal stout should be. will dring this one again."
"A little tough to finish. If this beer keeps its flavor and aroma profiles but the alcohol heat backs off with some age, it will be a real winner. Guess I'll wait a bit to crack another."
"Very tasty beer to finish off the weekend. I like oatmeal stouts and this amped up the flavor without getting boozy. Really good stuff."
"Pours very dark, mocha head. Nose is dark fruits and mild roast. Taste- low roast, plum/prunes, molasses. Finish is very cardboardy, seems as if father time has not been kind as oxidation has settled in. Mouthfeel is thick with the oats leading the way and boozy heat. Drinkability suffers considerable from the booze and oxidized taste. Too had as I had higher expectations."
"Notes: Overall, a really well-crafted Imperial Oatmeal Stout. More complex than I expected (a good thing). If it weren't for the ABV I would probably finish off the growler, however, not sure that's possible without finding the floor at the end of it all. Between this and the Jahva though, I think I'd choose the Jahva. Granted, this was an excellent stout and I'd highly recommend at least trying it if you're a fan any type of stout."
"Certainly worth the purchase. I'd recommend this to many friends and even a couple of enemies :)"
"Poured a thick black with no head. Nose is of oatmeal, roastiness, and a surprising amount of hoppiness for a stout. Flavor is very unique - a ton of oatmeal flavor (which ""oatmeal stouts"" usually lack) and good cerealness, balanced with some chocolate malt roastiness and a bit of hop. Mouthfeel is thick, syrupy, viscous and good. ABV very well disguised make it an easy drink that is damn tasty."
"2008. Near black pour, dark cream head lingers momentarily. Roasted malt, grain and coffee aromas. Nice chewy full body. Roasted malts and coffee with chocolate hints, microscopic toffee. Hops are a little more pronounced than I would like. A little bitter in the finish but clean. I could see some aging smoothing this out a bit and bringing out some more sweetness. Pretty straight forward, higher octane oatmeal stout. The Java is better, but this is pretty good as well."
"I am very pleased with Southern Tiers version of a oatmeal stout."
"Generally oatmeal stouts are gentle and docile creatures, approachable, and easy going. But Southern Tier has created something very different, that doesn't sit idle in the corner, but attacks every time you come near. Think of it as going to the pet store, expecting to buy a black cat, only to get home and find out that you purchased a malanistic panther. This one steps up the complexity and makes it more of a Russian Imperial Stout with oats, rather than an Imperial Oatmeal Stout. Whatever you call it, the burnt flavors along with the sweet chocolate and creamy oats make this an enjoyable beer. Highly recommended."
"Serving from a 22 fluid ounce brown bottle on 04 November 2008. Black color with a brown head. Medium to full body with a chewy mouthfeel. Has a dry bakers chocolate flavor with rich, lingering blackened malt finish. I wish there were more words to describe how great this beer is."
"Update 9/24/08: Batch 2008. Definitely not as good, perhaps it needed some age? Lots of hops and vegetables (asparagus). Only a slight hint of roasty malt goodness. Nothing like the 2007 batch. I didn't change my rating but I am disappointed."
"D- Rich and sweet; maybe a good night cap. Not my favorite stout from these guys, but not bad."
"taste is thick, smooth, chocolate, nuts, espresso, oatmeal, vanilla, and some licorice, a sourness to it, ends a little dry and bitter."
"D: Wow didn't realize it was 12.5% until I started rating it. Drinks just like any other stout to some extent--the alcohol isn't overpowering, but the taste, especially the sweet kick at the end keep it from being a great session beer."
"Pours pitch black wih a coffee colored head. Malty aroma of oatmeal, roasted coffee, chocolate and alcohol. Lots of oatmeal and roasted chocolate maltiness i the flavor as well as a noticeable alcohol warmth. ABV not very well masked."
"A: Somewhat viscous looking as evident from the pour, spirals of creamy foam on top, only a hint of light passes through the beer along the top of the glass, the color of an eight-ball - 4.50, S: I'm catching whiffs of the beer from two feet away, thick and malty, smells almost like a dark molasses, a nice hop aroma that manages to get through the heavy malt - 4.25, T: Quite dry on the tail of the beer, touches of the fine coffee grounds that you find at the bottom of the pot, extremely sweet, hints of rum soaked raisins - 4.25, M: Heavy and creamy - 4.50, D: This is my ninth beer of Southern Tier's Imperial series and like almost all of them, I think they've done an impressive job, I seek their Imperial beers out - 4.50"
"Yet another great, high octane brew from Southern Tier."
"Oat is absolutely wonderful. Strap a feedbag to me like the horse on the label, fill it with Oat, and I'll be good. Southern Tier generously throws a lot of ingredients into their ""bomber"" beers, and combined with talent and vision, it results in incredible beers like this. These guys can brew a mean stout, and this is one of their best beers overall. Hail."
"Pours black with a small tan head. Aroma is of roasted malt, chocolate, and grain. Coffee and chocolate are definitely present along with some noticeable oatmeal, definitely more so that traditional oatmeal stouts. Mouthfeel is good, though I would prefer it to be a little heavier."
"almost pitch black with a finger of tan head that disappears quickly. faint aroma of dates and molasses. taste is fairly sweet with some nice roastiness in the background and a nice bite on the swallow. alcohol is well masked. mouthfeel is creamy and quite rich."
"D Drinkable and nice but a touch dry overall, while it helps the taste the overall experience isn't great."
"No head on pour, minor tan ring around the glass with an aggressive pour. Alcohol and malts on the nose, nice heavy stout flavors on the tongue. A slight different flavor with the oat malts, but defiantly good. As it warms, all the excellent flavors come out, easy to drink. Excellent big beer. Thanks to Jwale73 for this one."
"I was drinking my beer as I wrote the review. My beer is done. Now I am sad."
"This thing is pretty delicious, lost of chocolate, some smooth oat, rich roasted malts, starts nice, then does an abrupt about face and turns into an aggressively bitter thing, with a lot of coffee espresso in the end with and its an odd combination. Apart, they're great, but together its confusing. The mouth is smooth, full, the carbonation a little more than your average stout perhaps. A solid beer, a bit odd, but plenty enjoyable to drink."
"Poured this into a tulip from a 22 oz bottle. The appearance is a very black very thin tan head. The aromas are strong chocolate, cherry and alcohol. Taste wise I am not super impressed this is a creamy chocolate back, but the alcohol seems to dominate the flavor for me. This is a sipper I split the 22oz bottle 4 ways and definitely had plenty. I think that a little more time in the bottle might take away a little of the alcohol flavor and mature out th chocolate."
"Had this in Baltimore at the Baltimore Taphouse in Canton. Pint glass; very dark color and short tan head. The aroma was quite sweet with alcohol, with notes of chocolate and some coffee. Unfortunately, I found that the alcohol overshadowed most of the taste. There was some toastiness, some smokiness, a bit of dark fruit like prunes and dried apricots, some tobacco; there was a nice bitter punch at the back end, but mostly it was booze. Body was a bit watery, too. Worth a try, but not a great sample."
"My bottle actually said 11% ABV, this is part of Southern Tier's Blackwater Series, this is a big beer that provides a good bang for its buck, not as good as Choklat in my opinion but one of this brewery's better beers and stouts for that matter, would like to drink again some time down the road, recommended"
"D-Hefty and rich. A complex treat. A sneaky one as the alcohol is so well hidden behind all of that flavour. Another well done brew in the ST Blackwater Series."
"Pours a thin and black 1-finger tan head the receeds quickly and leaves minor lacings. A husky malt smell, with seemingly roasted, toasted and some chocolate malts coming in the smell as well as some oats and coffee malts. Very smooth and sweet but a definitive dry edge is how I'd describe this beer in the short run. Roasted, coffee and dark chocolate malts are a plenty in a creamy medium body that smooths out from oat malt presence, and also tucks in some caramel/molasses and dark fruits with a slight peppery backbite thanks to minor alcohol burn. I liked this beer, but something was a little askew for me and I am not sure if I'll be buying this again - still worth trying if you haven't had it."
"While I said earlier that it looks medium bodied, it certainly drinks heavily, with a creamy feel. The creamy sensation didn't quite jibe with the ultimately sharp sensation. A nicely complex (I did at least like the progression from sweet to sharp) and tasty brew, to my mind it could've used a lower ABV. That would probably boost the drinkability."
"Interesting buy, possibly purchase again, though probably will look for a different brew in the same style."
"And it's damn good!"
"Bottle: pours a dark black with a thick, frothy tan head, aroma of coffee, chocolate, malt, taste is very smooth, some chocolate, malts, coffee and a mellow bitterness in the finish, medium mouthfeel. Glad I finally got to try this one. (by the way, I really hate the stupid word count on this site...why do I have to have a minimum of 250 characters if I don't have that much to say about a beer?)"
"Mouthfeel has that smooth, silky, thick oatmeal finish I was looking for. Drinkability is decent for the style, but I would definitely only have one in a sitting."
"Overall impression: A big, roasty, American stout. Not one of my favorite ST beers but a good one to sample. Worth a try once."
"Overall: Very roasty and burnt quality...more so then any other beer I've had in awhile. Very rich in flavor with a lot of character. I must try in my book."
"D: very easy to drink considering its abv. Not hot at all. great for cold weather"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: For me the mouthfeel of the beer was a bit disappointing. I want my big stouts to be viscous. I like em round and big. This is by no means a sessionable stout. It provides around 85% of what I want in a big stout. As the beer warms up it definately improves. The next bottle of this I drink will be at room temperature."
"Smooth, silky, and full-bodied, Southern Tier's Oat is lightly-carbonated, oily in texture, and a little on the hefty side to drink a lot of. Certainly a delicious Imperial Oatmeal Stout! Thanks again, Lum!"
"Pours a dark color, black as engine oil, but not as thick. Shows a great thick tan head that sticks around until the end. Smells of sweet and roasted malts. The taste is awesome, I didn't pick up any bitterness. A great spiced bread flavors bring the oatmeal through at the tail but not too overpowering, the stout stands upfront on my tongue. It's incredibly smooth too, the texture just rolls past your tongue for a very easy drink."
"Drinkability: This beer is very similar to the Stone 12th Anniversary Bitter Chocolate Oatmeal Stout. Both beers are great Stouts, and I honestly couldn't pick which one I like better. I would suggest you try them both, because if your a fan of this kind of beer you won't be disappointed. This beer might be a little heavy, but it so good you won't even care."
"One very solid stout and nothing short of what Southern Tier cranks out!"
"D: a nice sipper on a cold night"
"I really want to like this beer, but something is missing. I can't quite put my finger on it. Southern Tier is still in my top three as far as breweries, but this beer is just not as good as I expected. Yes, it is great, just not outstanding."
"I'm glad my alcohol tolerance is so high. Southern Tier speaks to me as a beer consumer. I only have to drink half as much when I choose their products. But with how good they taste, I'm tempted to drink the same amount as usual. I'd have to rank this third in the Blackwater Series behind Jahva (technically this scores better due to mouthfeel) and Choklat, but it's no slouch. If you liked any of the others, this will be sure to please. Like most of their offerings, it continues to reveal new things up to the end of the bomber. Drinkability suffers a bit due to the pure strength of this. It says something good about this brewery that a beer this good isn't in their top five offerings, and maybe not even the top ten."
"D= A serious oatmeal stout with an ABV and alcohol presence that is not for the weak hearted. Definitely a sipper and a beer that shoould never be served above cellar temps."
"Overall a very enjoyable brew."
"This is a good beer, but I don't love it. Definitely one that has to be allowed to warm and sipped slowly. I must say that I'm starting to cool on Southern Tier's creations. They just seem to be a bit much more often than not."
"This beer pours a thick used motor oil black. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is milk chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla and hints of coffee. The taste is like the aroma, but with everything a little more pronounced. There is also a lingering, moderate bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is perfect for an imperial stout, or any other stout for that matter. It is full bodied with a silky texture, and appropriately low carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice beer. It doesn't wow me the way Creme Brulee Stout did, but it is good on its own merits."
"D: I loved the chocolate and hops coupling. Glad I have been able to try Southern Tier. This beer just reiterates my desire to try as many offerings from this brewery as possible."
"Overall, this is a great beer for this time of season. This is perfect after spending a cool day at the pumpkin patch with the kids. In fact, that sounds like a stellar idea, I have two bottles remaining, maybe I'll just do that! Definitely recommended..."
"D - A delicious beer, but couldn't possibly do it all night, both for tiring of the big flavors and dealing with the high abv."
"The Oat pours a deep, viscous black color with possibly brown edges if held up to a bright light. It has a thick brown head that leaves great lace and a thin later above the beer. The smell is of brown sugar and roasted malt, sugar, and molasses. The taste follows the smell but a great bitter aftertaste from the burnt characteristics. Dark brown sugar is heavily apparent. The beer has a full body and is very silky. Like a pumkin beer really tastes nothing like a pumpkin but reminds you of it, the Oat does the same for oatmeal. This beer is done in typical Southern Tier fashion."
"Mouthfeel is big and rich and creamy, very full and satisfying. Pretty drinkable for a big beer, enjoy with a maduro cigar and a rich chocolate dessert."
"Pours a solid blackness with a thinnish tan head that quickly dissipates. Aromas of coffee chocolate and molasses dominate the nose. There's a faint dark fruit and a hint of earthy hop aroma as well. The flavor is roast and chocolate with brown sugar, molasses and still a touch of ethanol. Light dried fruit flavor and earthy hop bite. Thick viscous body with a sweet roasty syrupy mouthfeel and a light level of carbonation. This one seems to do really well with a bit of age on it. The flavors seem to have melded nicely and the alcohol while still present has toned considerably."
"A vigorous pour shows a thick, pitch black beer with quickly dissipating head. The smell, predominantly of chocolate and bread, is surprisingly thin for a brew this rich. The taste truly earns the ""imperial"" title - massive bittersweet chocolate (more sweet than bitter), some coffee, oats and lightly roasted barley, with some definite hop spice and slight hop bitterness. The real genious here is the melding of the deftness and relative lightness that is characteristic of an oatmeal stout with the largess of flavor (though not the complexity, it must be noted) of an imperial stout. The mouthfeel is absolutely spectacular - thick and chewy, with nice warming action. As to drinkability, between the ABV, the richness, and the sweetness, good luck trying to knock down more than one of these."
"I think this one is best fresh though, as the bready, toasty, oat character will be fading."
"D: A decent drinkability for this style of beer, but recommended for the cooler months. You will feel the higher than normal ABV after a little bit, so it can be quite warming. However, if approached accordingly, you should be able to handle this one and be fine."
"This is a superb Imperial Stout. It reminds me of Stone IRS, and that is most certainly a good thing. The smell is superb, the taste is rich and complex... it's the perfect beer to warm you up on a cold night. If you're a fan of big stouts you should definitely get some if you can. Highly recommended."
"Cheers"
"22oz. bomber served in a snifter. Poured a deep, opaque black with a thin wispy head. Roasted malts with some fruit and a little alcohol. Full bodied. Deep roasted malt flavor. Not a lot of hop bitterness, but roasted malt bitterness. Long dry finish of chocolate malt. I'm going to put my other bottle away for a while. This seems like it might need a little time."
"This beer poured pitch black and formed a small medium tan foamy head that left latticed lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, cocoa, coffee and a hint of oats. The flavor was of malt, chocolate, anise and grain. The body is medium light and the finish is bittersweet. This stout is pretty good, but not quite as good as some of their other stout offerings."
"I really solid imperial stout overall. The oats make it have that pleasant mouthfeel as well. It isn't the best imperial stout I've had by far, but its pretty good. I'd probably buy it once again, but there are others I'd pick up first."
"D: OK drinkability but there was alot of alcohol at 11% but I was able to do the bottle. Interesting take on the style as always from Southern Tier."
"Drinkability: Better than the bottle in some ways and worse in others. The taste and aroma seem to be dominated less by whatever tastes/aromas you would imagine would constitute an Imperial Oatmeal stout and more by fruity, nutty, and (potentially) some funky off flavors, though could just be my keg. A friend detected sunflower seeds, and I get way too much orange peel. On the other hand, appearance (a perfect pour will do that) and mouthfeel are a little improved, so I think it's a wash. Give it a shot either way. Recommended."
"Pours a dark black body beneath a thin tan head, some lacing. Aromas of cocao, plum, cherry, light roasted barley and malted milk balls. Flavor is semi-sweet cocoa, light coffee flavors and some restrained notes of roasted barley. Full body, creamy texture, soft carbonation. Finishes a nice long cocao sweet."
"Poured into a wide mouthed chalice. Very little head that disipates immediately. This beer has a restrained aroma of a roasted chocolat liquor nose. Once the beer hits the mouth an explosion of flavor is released. Roasted malt, coffee, burnt toffee, and burnt wood flavors envelop the palate. a very silky textured mouthfeel with a long lingering finish with a drawn out bitterness and roasted malt. Alcohol is very well masked. Fully enjoyed this beer."
"HV"
"Taste is quite strong. Chocolate, burnt, malt with a little sweetness yet it is not overly thick tasting. As I drink this beer it seems to mellow a little and is pretty easy to drink despite the strong ABV. Mouth feel has a little bite but is really smooth to the tongue. Overall, a very appealing beer."
"This has aged quite nicely. Fruity, chocolate, oatmeal raisin cookies , Minimal oxidation is present. The palate is a blend of oatmeal cookies, Chocolate syrup, toasted oatmeal, a little bit of coffee and licorice. quite slick on the palate, this beer is moderately sweet and quite enjoyable. alcohol is well hidden. 4/4/4"
"I'm hoping to get this on tap at home at some point. In the meantime, I'm certainly picking up another bottle or two."
"Drinkability: A great beer, and within the same great circle like Stone RIS and Weyerbacher XIII, though the around $9 price tag is a bit hard to swallow. Maybe the economy has something to do with that also I suppose. That said, it took me a while to drink it and I enjoyed every sip. I wouldn't mind cellaring one to see if the sweetness curbs a bit, but it's great fresh. Southern Tier continues to get out of their hole they were in due to the first few brews I had by which I was not very impressed. The last few, however, were pretty great, including this."
"D: Very drinkable considering the ABV, which is well hidden, but compared to the bevy of other imperial stouts out there this one does not stack up as well as many other stouts out there. Not bad but not all that great."
"Pours black as night, shiny, viscous with a thick appearance. A small brown head stays laced across the top of the brew. Roasted grain, chocolate malt, coffee been, and a hint of molasses in the nose. Much is the same with the beers flavor, very roasty, lots of semi-sweet chocolate and caramel malt, a grassy bitterness, a slight hint of alcohol heat, not 11% in the slightest. Not extremely complex but one hell of a quality Imperial Stout. Full bodied but not grainy or thick, a bit sticky but dangerously drinkable. I recommend this one for sure."
"Another great beer from Southern Tier, the Black Water series continues to impress me the more I come back to it."
"Brewed Fall 2008 indicated on the bottle. Served in my brand new Terrapin snifter. Poured just shy of black with deep burgundy highlights around the edges; opaque with regards to clarity. Quarter inch, tan-colored head dissipated into a mere swirl with a tiny band of foam and bubbles around the edges of the glass. Some lacing but no legs. Nose is malt, molasses and a touch of alcohol. Extremely flavorful - chocolate malt, molasses, brown sugar, oats and a light hops bittering to round out the finish. Mouthfeel is medium and chewy without being overly viscous (viscosity is cut by a light carbonation in the background). Definitely a little bit of alcohol heat on this one. Best enjoyed slowly and savored as it warms so as to detect subtle changes in character."
"The drinkability is very good this is a brew to be tried to be sure, Prosit, MK"
"Overall I have to admit this one took me by surprise. I did not expect it to be anywhere near as good as it was. In fact this was downright excellent. One of the best bigger stouts I have had in a long time, and hands down my favorite of the big southern tier beers. I would like to have one of these everyday it would seem. Really go check this one out, it is absurdly good."
"D: The alcohol presence is noticable - but not in a sense that it needed to be 'hidden.' With the other flavours, it's almost dangerously drinkable. A pretty good beer - maybe a little bit over the top (only in America!), but good."
"After having been impressed by this brew so much last year, there was no hesitation on my part to buy a bomber when I saw it on the shelf at Martys in Newton. I poured this one in to my Portsmouth tulip glass at a temperature perhaps slightly lower than cellar. Little in the way of heading, but a small white/tan ring could be seen forming around the glass. Color cannot be stated enough; this truly is black water that light will not penetrate. Burnt coffee bean is the first smell that shows itself, followed by earthy grains, oatmeal, and a bit of lactose sweetness. Taste starts off with a mix of chocolate and oatmeal, stays earthy throughout, and ends on a more bitter coffee note. Feel is robust, yet manages to slay slick on the palate. This one truly qualifies as a meal in a bottle. Try sharing this one with a friend, as the alcohol and overall weight of this beer might be a bit too much for single handedly polishing off a bomber. This beer is my favorite from Southern Tier, and one of my favorites throughout the year. Imagine a beer milk shake, and you might get an idea as to what this one resembles. Despite the steep price tag, Oat might have to be a brew that I cave in, and purchase a case of. Cheers to the guys at ST for creating such a great beer."
"Drinkability is good for an imperial stout; this makes an excellent heavy-meal or dessert drink."
"D : Extremely easy to drink. I had no idea it was 12.5%."
"The mouth is thick and creamy but also manages a bit of an oily tongue coating quality. Pretty drinkable given the 11%. I would have no problem recommending this beer."
"D: Very smooth flavor and the roast isn't too overpowering. I really enjoyed this beer and thought it was very drinkable."
"Oat may not be as superb as Choklat and Jahva, but it's an excellent stout that drinks like a dream. It explodes out of the gate and cruises across the finish line in the manner of a true thoroughbred. This brewery is more than solid. Many thanks to far333 for sending me the bomber."
"Pitch blackness, still motor oil with a decent tannish head. Smell is rich and fairly deep. Some sweet scents of chocolate and oats paired with a roast scent. Taste is alright, though not very well balanced from my experience. Sweet and roast flavors along with a mild hop presence struggle for balance and never really get there. Mouthfeel is pretty enormous. Almost too thick, like I'm drinking something similar to the consistency of melted chocolate syrup. Just a bit overwhelming to enjoy much. Another big dark brew from Southern Tier that doesn't quite live up to its name for me. Maybe Jahva will prove otherwise?"
"This is a big beer. very enjoyable but only one in a sitting."
"D- the most intense oatmeal stout ive ever encountered. something that i could have one of every so often, but no more than one in a night. its just too big."
"drinkability is pretty good. i have only had half a glass and already i feel warm all over and a growing numbness in the back of my mouth. that alcohol is balanced fairly well with a big malt base and sweetness and bitterness."
"If you like Oatmeal Stouts, consider this a bigger, badder version of what you're used to..."
"Notes of black currant, and hints of coffee. Oh, that is hot. Thick and rich on the palette with very relaxed carbonation. Too damn hot - the alcohol is just too pronounced."
"Pours a pitch black color with a redish brown head that dissipated into a light ring. The aroma is of roasted malt, coffee, some dates/figs, molasses and rusty metal. The taste is of an extraordinarily smooth roasted malt, a chocolate/mocha blast, and the ""imperial"" dark cherry/rum/raisin sweetness. The feel is well bodied, with soft/velvty carbonation and finishes extremely smooth and bitter sweet. Though very silky it is also a bit slick and sticky. I wanted to give it a 5 for feel but its too sticky. A hard core stout with robust flavors that are kept in check with the oats. Big beer but nice and smooth. Could be less sticky."
"Pitch black, tan head that dissipates down to a ring around the glass and no lacing. Smells of molasses, sweet malt, cherries, and hops. Oats are noticeable on the tongue, though I don't know if it's the first thing that would have came to mind if I didn't know oats were used. Taste is also sweet with molasses and a little bit of cherries and currants. A little bit of hoppiness comes out in the finish, as well as some roastiness. Thick body with low carbonation. Good beer. This is my second offering from Southern Tier and both have been good beers that I'd get more of."
"I picked up a bottle at Binny's in Lake Zurich, drank it with my wife in Chicago. This beer was way more massive than I expected, easily one of the best (or maybe THE best) oatmeal stout I've had. The beer was very dark brown, opaque, with a thick red-tan foam. The smell was sweet malts, chocolate, and a little coffee. I got a lot more chocolate out of this than coffee in the aroma and taste. The flavors were so strong it got a little overwhelming, making this a real sipper. I can't rate the drinkability as high as appearance, smell, and taste. But that's fine, this beer is top shelf."
"Dark chocolate bitterness and some herbal hops up front. Quickly pushed aside by big malty sweetness. Roasted barley mixes with maple syrup, molasses, concentrated dark fruit sweetness, and caramel. Slightly smoky, peat flavor adds more complexity. Dark chocolate and coffee bitterness pick up in the finish. Some warmth from the alcohol, but deceptively easy drinking. Very full-bodied with a very creamy, smooth, chewy feel. Very nice!"
"Absolutely beautiful as the oil black thick body settles into the glass. hosts a fat foamy chocolate brown head standing in at two inches. Nose is just as big with notes of sweet chocolate malt alchol soaked dark fruit and even fresh baked pretzels. Super smooth and creamy chocolate waves splash over the tongue with first sip. Alchol is noticeable but much like a cordial. It is really smooth as a Imperial but it still retains the qualities of an oatmeal stout. The waves of chocolate keep coming with a ton of malted chocolate oats. Almost like drinking a warm chocolate malt. This really is quite tasty, I think I like it more than Chokolat. Chocolate bitter feel almost turns to spicey dryness on the mouthfeel. Very nicely drinkable for such a big stout."
"This beer poured very dark nearly a black with no head thats I could see as well as no carbonation. The smell was nice mostly of chocolate and coffee. Thetaste was a little disapppointing the flavor of molasses overpowered most everything and made this not the easiest beer to drink. Don't get me wrong this is a finely crafted beer but the flavor of molasses was a little too much for me. The alcohol was well hidden and if not for the overpowering molasses flavor this would be something I would love to drink all the time :) On a side not this didn't have an oatmeal stout flavor to me @ all"
"Pours black with a smallish tan head, minimal lacing, but some interesting swirl patterns on top of the beer. Smell is boozy, chocolate notes, maybe some vanilla bean? Taste is milk chocolate, some molasses, more smokey vanilla taste...nice. Really nice mouthfeel on this...velvety, perfect amount of carbonation. Really an excellent beer. My love affair with this brewery continues..."
"D: This is a huge stout that I would definitely categorize as a sipper or a dessert beer. It's a good but not great stout in my book."
"Notes: Nice stuff, but perhaps a bit too strong for its own good - the noticeable alcohol adds a harsh edge to a style that I prefer to be smooth and mellow."
"The drinkability is also pretty darn impressive for such a thick beer. I had to slow myself down just to savor it. I'll be definitely going back to pick up a few more of these as I think I like this better than Choklat."
"Southern Tier sure knows how to make extreme beer. I'll likely look for this whenever it comes out again."
"D: Fairly drinkable considering its strength."
"D- This is a powerful brew. You wouldn't be able to drink a ton of this but it is very tasty and flavorful. Exactly what I have come to expect from Southern Tier."
"Pitch black with no apparent edges topped by fine, dark brown foam that settled to a thin ring that lasted to the end. Some streaky lacing. Rich aroma - nutty and roasted with chocolate and caramel notes, lots of malt and a bit of alcohol. Strong bitterness barely provided balance with the huge malty sweetness. The alcohol really helped reign in the malt too. Quite roasty with lots of chocolate and caramel, grainy and malty with a hint of licorice. Thick and creamy texture with lots of warmth (a bit on the hot side actually). Good stuff. It seems like a good candidate for aging, especially if the alcohol cools down a bit."
"Drinkability is moderate, hampered by a big alcohol presence (11%abv), but overall great malt profile with a range of complex flavors that will beat you up if you don't watch it, another solid beer from ST!"
"D: 11% abv goes down almost to easy for a beer of this nature and proportions? Drinkability is therefore limited to one but drinks like a full meal. A definite high recommend."
"Poured a black, black oh so black with a mocha tan head that left some thick lacing. The smell is a little sweet fruit over dark chocolate and double shot of espresso. The taste is very intense and there is a lot going on. The dark choco and espresso is right up front with some dark fruits and a little boozy barrel aged aftertaste. The alcohol wasn't overpowering but this did taste a little like bourbon. It makes it even more amazing. The mouthfeel was very thick and chewy which made it more of a sipper but was still drinkable and I could definitely do another bottle."
"What a great brew sent by Hojaminbag, in a very nice trade."
"Drinkability: Very nice and quaffable on a cold evening. Bready and chewy. Complex enought to finish a bottle yourself. Not as good as BORIS though. =-0"
"The mouthfeel was thick and heavy. It really coated my mouth with a big layer of flavor. The carbonation was medium and appropriate for an imperial stout. Drinkability was slightly hampered by the heavy mouthfeel, but still a very nice sipping beer."
"Again big thanks to Andrew! I really appreciate it."
"Thanks Steven for providing a great beer for our mini tasting."
"Overall I'm glad I tried it, but it is not a stout I would reach for in a pack of other stouts. I respect what they did with this beer, but it's just not my cup of tea."
"This is an astoundingly delicious stout. Very rich and robust, yet it belies its high ABV. Try this beer."
"Not a gulper, this is one substantial beer and needs to be savored slowly and with respect to its alcohol content. My only nit to pick might be its lack of carbonation; on a nitro pour, this would be the absolute bomb."
"Another bold and balanced ""big beer", not bad at all."
"Another great bomber from Southern Tier. Seek it and its brothers out."
"Pours dark black with a small tan head that doesn't last even with a violent pour. Smell is of marshmallows, oat, chocolate and a lot of alcohol coming through in the way of acetone, almost. Taste is creamy, smooth, and oily with a great carbonation level. More oatiness, chocolate, roast malt and marshmallowy goodness, but again the alcohol is huge, and is the only thing that keeps this from being awesome in my mind. If they scaled it back to maybe 8-9% or hid it better I'd love this stuff, but as hot as it is, It was just an enjoyable one time beer for me."
"Wow. This was the final beer during an night of alot of impressive beers. This was damn smooth and filling and a perfect nightcap. Higly recommended."
"Inky black with a light brown (darker than tan) head. Aromas of bacon fat and the kitchen at my local pub. Tastes oily and sweet with a deep rich malted milk flavor. Not so much roast as a deep caramelized malty syrup. Well balanced in terms of alcohol, hops, and dark malty flavors. Full body and a used motor oil finish. I enjoyed it with four other people, so it never had a chance to get cloying. Beers of this pugnacious character ought not to be consumed in excess of eight ounce servings - for professional reasons, not masculine issues."
"I really like this one from Southern Tier."
"M/D: Big full body, a little silky, mild carbonation. Alcohol done very well and the big sweet finish is good. Drinkability is fine. Big alcohol and big body make it a sipper but man does it taste good."
"d: Overall, this is really a fantastic beer. I prefer it to the slightly overwhelming Choklat which was also delicious but maybe a little tougher to drink."
"Pours pitch black with a thin tan head. Flavor is very sweet. Almost comes off as a milk stout, and the 12.5% certainly doesn't show up at all. Kind of tangy and I'm not sure I like it. Have had this in the past and I don't remember it being like this. Sure it's smooth, but there are no real strong characteristics moving me here. Feel is smooth and slick on liquid with a low carbonation. Drinkable, yes. Just wondering if this bottle is not at its best."
"definitely a sipper, thick and bold, some of the most amazing body, will probably buy again"
"Overall, an absolutely outstanding stout. Certainly am glad I brought this back from New York."
"This beer pours a beautiful jet black, it looks super viscous like old motor oil. Almost no head at all, with the oatmeal I would have thought there would be at least some head retention. The beer smells absolutely beautiful. Like bittersweet chocolate and espresso, with some caramel and molasses notes. You get a hint of the alcohol, but not too much it just lets you know it is there. This beer smells really fantastic. Taste is a lot of the same. It tastes like black, whatever that means. Basically like dark dark chocolate, espresso, molasses and a little bit of dried fig or prune flavors. The beer is very sweet, but there is a noticeable bitterness in the background. I would have preferred it to be a bit less sweet, it was bordering on cloying. Mouthfeel was viscous. You could feeel it coat you palate as it swirled around, almost like cough syrup. The drinkability suffered a bit do to the extreme sweetness. However, it was still an extremely enjoyable experience. Overall a wonderful beer."
"Pours a thick black, faint dark brown highlighted into my snifter. Great to swirl and watch the viscous liquid try to hold on for dear life to the inside of the glass. No head and no carbonation visible. The aroma is a warm, oaty, malty, chocolatey feeling and smelling beer. The smell gives you a great precursor to hat you can expect this beer to taste like. The first sip is a bittersweet dark chocolate, vanilla, and marshmellow malt. Lets not forget the coffee and hints of toffee amidst this hotly alcoholic beer. Very creamy, warming, and oily palated beer. Great for sipping and swirling."
"Quite smooth with a lot of interesting things going on but that particular combination doesn't agree with my palate quite as well as the choklat does."
"D, notes: This is very good. The type of beer that BAs help move to the best of list."
"Edit: Mouthfeel, as the bottle gets lower, gets a touch thick and syrupy - lowered to 4.0 from 4.5"
"Love this beer, it stays dry when pressure on, difference is, youre not."
"pours a brown/black color with NO head regardless of how hard of a pour you go for, just a thin ring of light brown. smells like chocolate oatmeal, as though such a thing existed but if it did it would smell like this beer. and holy shit the taste, chocolate, oatmeal, malty smooth, not at all harsh from abv. just a fantastic taste, with a mouth-feel to match, velvet, pure velvet, for those who don't get me, subtle crispness/carbonation that tingles as though little flavor crystals just skimmed across your tongue. drinks fairly easy for 12.5%. TRY THIS BEER!!!"
"On tap in Boston new years eve 2006-2007. From notes. goddamn I have about 3,000 beer review notes I've yet to transcribe to this site, and as I'm in a writing mood I figured that I would get started on rectifying that situation. Anyway, this one is an inky, heavy black with not much carbonation. There is a small espresso head though and it can be revived with a swirl of the riedel. Dark roasty and sweet malts intersperse with a nice raw green hop aroma. Roasty chocolate, espresso, raisins, and more abound in the aroma and the actual taste is better still with just a hint of warming alcohol in the background. The roast notes are really nice and filled with an unusual level of depth. However the mouthfeel is a bit thick and cloying for my liking which kicks the drinkability down a notch or two."
"2007, listed at 11% abv. Poured black, and a bit undercarbonated. Thick and viscous with bubbles slow to form. Little head. The initial smell is of alcohol, followed by sweet malt, an underlying bitterness, and perhaps a bit of light roastiness as well. The taste is a little hot as well, also quite bitter, a tad undercarbonated. But there are very good flavors of coffee, molasses, and a roasted graininess. The mouthfeel is smooth and sweet. This beer didn't blow me away. I really think it needs more time in the bottle to mellow and integrate flavors a bit more and to tame some of the sweetness. Not bad now, but probably could be better."
"Heady with a thickness and color of dark chocolate sauce. Well-balanced abundance of malt and hops on the nose. Best-tasting chocolate oatmeal you ever had - overpowering like the thickest blanket on the coldest night of the year; this is beautiful chemistry. Thickness slides down the palate for an enjoyably long finish. Excellent for a nightcap."
"D: The abv is through the roof, 11% per the bottle, making this a one-off night cap. I like what Southern Tier is doing with their Imperial line and this is no exception. A must-try for fans of oatmeal."
"Wow. Pours a thick, slow, black. Slight blackish-brown foam. This brew looks like oil. Doesn't pack a wallop on the aroma, but a distinct molasses-oatmeal scent. Southern Tier has done an outstanding job with this one. It actually has viscosity; you can feel the oats suspended in the ale. I picked this one up after trying their Choklat(unbelievable), and the Oatmeal Stout does not disappoint. Truth in advertising on this one; this is a dyed-in-the-wool Oatmeal Stout."
"Oat pours very very very black, with almost no head whatsoever. The nose is very sweet with some alcohol. The taste is much sweeter than I had expected. This is very good. Sweet sugars, lots of dark fruit with a hint of coffee and a kind of chocolate taste. Very good creamy creamy mouthfeel. Lovely drinkability as the abv does not show up in the least. This is a great beer, I am glad I have three more in my cellar!"
"D - A meal of a beer."
"Poured a very dark blackish brown with a tan head. The roasted character is actually not too high, its more on the sweet, caramel side with some chocolate. The mouthfeel is *thick*. Probably one of the thickets beers I've experienced so far. There is some alcohol that creeps up and stings the nostrils as well, but not too much. The finish is slightly sweet, like oats and chocolate basically. A pretty big beer that you better be ready for before you pour that glass."
"M&D - like a rogue, this beer paid the prowl cost, (any MTG-ers out there), the alcohol is sneaky, hard to taste except at the very very end, otherwise its sneaky sweet, sneaky smooth, and sneaky delicious, well done Southern Tier"
"Poured into my new Ommegang chalice! This brew poured super dark and smelled so amazing! It smelled a lot like a chocolate cereal in front of a fan pointed toward your nose. The taste is nothing short of grand. It reminded me a lot of the 2 yr old Stone IRS I had not to long ago. Its super drinkable with a nice creamy mouthfeel."
"Drinkability- This stout, although huge with alcohol and oily, is still delicious and quite drinkable. I would love to find this on tap."
"This thick black brew slithers out of the bottle to produce a cocoa-brown head that doesn't last. Aroma dominated by dark malts with bread and chocolate. Hops don't even seem to bother, but the alcohol makes an appearance. Taste is rich chocolate and with a thick sweet oaty body that leaves a dark film on the side if the glass if you swirl it. The alcohol level is not as well hidden as in some brews, but it is well moderated. The heavy body is quite appropriate for the style, but its at the sipper end of the scale, far from anything that could be sessioned. A good effort in the imperial stout range with a bit more creativity than most of its peers."
"Nearly straight black with only hints of brown. A very thin dark brown head makes a brief appearance. The smell is sweet and malty, roasted and chocolatey, with dark, fruity alcohol. The taste is sweet and malty. Bitter chocolate along with molasses, dark roasted coffee with vanilla and noticeable alcohol. The mouthfeel is crazy, oily smooth. I think I've tried three of Southern Tier's blackwater series now, and while they have all been good all three have been a bit rough. It seems that ST is somewhat of a beer bully that would be well advised to mellow out for a bit."
"As for drinkability, for me it was just too hot from the alcohol to really enjoy. It is a sipper beer that warmed all the way down. I think maybe a year in the cellar would mellow this out some and allow the flavor of the beer to dominate the alcohol.. or so i hope. I was slightly disspointed in this one after all of the very high reviews but i want the flavor to dominate, not the alcohol burn when i drink beer."
"Pours a deep black color, some carbonation, nice little fizzy dark tan head, which leaves minimal sticky lacing. The nose is malty, chocolaty, toffee, roasty, vanilla, and caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, lots and lots of roasty/chocolate/toffee tones. The alcohol is hidder pretty well for a brew this high. Medium body. A well rounded brew. Very drinkable, another awesome brew from ST, highly recommended. Thanks Joe."
"Overall: I am absolutely blown away by ST. They have really come on the scene in the past year and the beers they are now putting out will rival the lineup of any of the other highly rated craft brewers. I love what they are doing and am excited to see what 2008 brings to their lineup of beer. I am thankful I have BeerTruth up in Syracuse to ensure that I enjoy each and everyone of their offerings."
"Very low carbonation and very creamy mouthfeel. With the alcohol mostly masked, this is a very drinkable beer."
"Very good, solid stout, with perhaps one off-note, kind of a funky bitterness that becomes more noticeable as a I drink it. I don't know that is, almost a metallic tang. Detracts slightly."
"Overall: This is a really big beer in every way that is not for the faint of heart. Although i found it maybe to be slightly less complex than i was expecting, another outstanding extreme stout from the brewers at southern tier."
"D: This is definitely a good beer. A sipper for sure. Makes a perfect nightcap on a cold winter night. However, could be a little more carbonated."
"Drinkability- I really like this one. I havent yet tried Choklat or Jah*va but if this is any indication of how good they are going to be I cant wait. This was a really good Imp Stout and like all the other Southern Tier brews I tried, fantastic. Big thanks again to Greg and Jeremy!"
"Its a hearty brew, satisfying like a fine desert, and it masks the alcohol well. I dont think I could drink two of these filling brews in a row, but every sip was better than the last. Another killer beer from Southern Tier."
"I'll be interested to see how the other bottle tastes with some age under it's belt."
"Notes: Like Choklat (sampled for the first time just 2 nights earlier), the amazing part of this beer is how well-hidden the 11% ABV is. I ended up with a real solid buzz from this, probably because it was so smooth -- I find oatmeal stouts have that creamy smoothness to them that is lacking in other stouts, and Oat didn't disappoint in that regard -- that I drank it pretty fast. Another excellent beer from Southern Tier; I'm curious to see how this one will age. . . ."
"Overall --I like it the oats cover up almost all of the alcohol sting -- not lacking, good beer here"
"D: My first beer from Southern Tier and I am impressed, I'd like to try more of their beers if I'm ever in the Northeast."
"D - Just different enough to separate itself from all the other Impy Stouts out there, something I could see myself coming back to."
"While the aroma is way too one-dimensional, the front part of each sip is quite enjoyable; the rich, textured grain character (of which the oatmeal plays a significant role) accents a delightful chocolate flavor and reasonable espresso flavor. The finish though is overly sharp and roasted; harsh, off-putting and acidic, at best this beer needs five years to mellow. At which point it might actually be quite sublime. If you only have one bottle, I would highly recommend holding on to it for quite some time."
"22 oz bottle poured as if I were draining oil from one of my cars. Very black. Minimal tan head falls quickly to some moderate lacing. Aromas of dark chocolate, coffee, and a hint of black liquorish. Strong aggressive flavors of roasted malt, dark chocolate, burnt toast, brown sugar and booze. Some light pine mixed in there as well. Finishes sweet. High ABV is definitely noticeable, but not harsh. Mouth feel is thick and sticky. Low carbonation. Overall drinkability is fair. A bit too sweet and syrupy for me, but still found it very enjoyable. Worth a try. Cheers!"
"D - A great beer that might be perfect with a touch less alcohol and a bit more body. I went through this one too fast trying to place complex taste after complex taste. The alcohol seemed to build in the taste to the point it truly became a sipper."
"11% abv. Brewed in Fall 2007. Demon-blood black with a thin burnt-orange head that quickly vanishes into a ring. Dark-chocolate-dipped blackberry aromas with a slightly menacing undercurrent of alcohol vapor. The oil-slick texture carries a cacophony of juicy dark fruit flavors: black cherries, burnt currants, earthy and coniferous hop spice, charred grain, and silky booze. The latter is deftly hidden amongst the wall of flavor this stout presents, but its warming effect is nearly immediately noticeable both in the stomach and in the cheeks. A sipper for certain. A solid effort, but less than awesome all the same."
"D: A big, big beer; a pleasure to drink as a single pour, but nearly impossible to finish a bottle. Dessert-like and decadent, this is certainly recommended, but is the type of beer you want to end the night on. Absolutely worth seeking out and sipping on rare occasions when the moment seems right..."
"Bottle courtesy of Jerc: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a dark brown foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma consists of well balance of sweet oatmeal malt with some coffee and bitter roasted malt. Taste is also dominated by a rich creamy texture with some notes of coffee, medium sweet black chocolate and a light bitter ending. I have to admit to being very impressed by this beer that retains some balance while being very extreme."
"Pours a completely opaque black beer with a quarter inch of head that quickly sinks to a slim covering of cappucino colored tracing. Aromas are carried by a strong alcohol presence. Lots of earthy, rich and deep notes come through, mostly chocolate, cream soda, vanilla, a little light oak, and a bunch of milled oatmeal. It's really nothing like any RIS I've had as I would compare it to; not as roasty or chocolaty, but still with some slight port like notes. On the palate, this beer explodes! Minimal carbonation fills your mouth with a heavy slickness of chocolate, oatmeal, some slight lactose like notes. It is incredible smooth as the high percentage of oats would do and the finish is very long, very smooth with some slight roasty bitterness. A little bit of an herbal touch is felt from the hops, columbus bringing citrus and willamette a little floral. Overall, this is an overwhelmingly good beer and I'm scared to rate it so high. My first from this brewery and hopefully the rest will live up to this one."
"A great oatmeal stout and on eof the best around. Nothing out of balance and the 11% is well hidden. Highly suggested."
"...decadent, sinful, and worth the price of the sin."
"Very interesting impy stout...more hops than any other stout I've tried. Very distinct and well worth seeking out."
"* The cherry/berry element is dark but overpowered by the alcohol and the bitter, roasted malt."
"Mouthfeel was satisfactory, smooth and somewhat creamy with a low amount of carbonation in the throat. An acceptable beer, but nothing remarkable. Unless offered as a gift, I would not make a point of partaking of this beverage again."
"Drinkability: These bombers that Southern Tier put out are just an adventure that I am ready to take whenever I see them; another great achievement"
"This is series #2 at 11%, licoricey and chewy. Columbus and Chinook and chocolate and de-bittered black barley from Belgium. A very rich and oily imperial stout that is a meal in itself. A sipper that goes down well with a meal. Very satisfying. Thick black and an aroma that is chocolatey and somewhat hoppy.Mollasses and cocoa."
"D-Right up there with the best of the best....a slight grainy alcoholic feel is the only minor complaint...now listed at 11.0% rather than 12.5% Maybe they are working on that...might be even better at 10%...nevertheless this is a hell of a beer. I'm not sure where the scores will place it but it feels like a top 25-50 beer of all-time for me. (Note: I just checked it is tied for # 72 out of 1302 on my list....about right)"
"Drinkability: Very big beer. Too thick and heavy to have much of. A bomber will about do it. Best enjoyed with something much lighter alongside. Very good beer, with good complexity, and a bit different than a lot of Imperial Stouts out there."
"Deep black in color-not as much head as the label would have you believe. Lightly carbonated-nice lacing as it goes down. Mellow aroma of roasted malts and oats. Quite grainy. Slick and oily oat flavor. Decent level of roasted malts against a fairly heavy dose of hops. Really great slickness to it with the roasted flavor. Slightly spiced-cinnamon and licorice. Perfect mouthfeel-as before with the oilyness. Not a touch of alcohol in there. Almost the perfect brew going on here. A great drinkability. I cant get enough of the mouthfeel on this one. Great, great beer."
"If ever a beer was labeled as a ""meal in a bottle", this would be it. Insanely thick, coats the mouth, very heavy. Light on the carbonation or maybe I dont notice it as much because of the thickness of the brew. This is definitely a sipper and a great winter beer. Very good and highly recommended. It appears that Southern Tier can do no wrong."
"D-This is one hell of a stout, I like it better than their Ja-va. A well made stout"
"22oz bomber into snifter. A: Pours thick as oil, completely black, very little head and almost no lacing. S: Chocolate, thick caramel up front, some citrus notes hidden in there. Hops pretty faint. Alcohol present. T: Very sweet and creamy up front, darker fruit with some citrus, nice biting hops that really come through on the finish. Great balance. M: Very, very thick, smooth, chewy. D: Really enjoyable--obviously very intense, but very drinkable for such a huge abv. I'll definitely pick this one up again if I see it. Really delicious."
"Pours a very thick and oily opaque black, thick and huge brown head forms, massive lacing, good retention. Smell is oats, caramel, chocolate, big roast, molasses, vanilla, bit of wood and smoke. Taste is molasses and toffee, chocolate, roast, oats, sweet lactic middle, coffee with cream, some floral and bitter roast in the finish. Mouthfeel is very thick and viscous, low carbonation, very sweet. At first I had this rated pretty highly, but the more I drank the more I disliked it. It turns sickly sweet and sugary, and if I have this again its going to be split a hell of a lot more than two ways."
"Drinkability: decent but a real slow sipper here. This bottle will last a good part of the evening. One bomber is more than enough though."
"So this is fairly black, with a tan head and really fine lace. The smell is not overwhelming in power, but some nice burnt malts (oats too i suppose), and with time, a fair amount of the sugary booze. Taste is straight forward and sweet, hershey's syrup and coffee liquor, with a slight burnt bitterness. Boozy/vinous aftertaste. Mouthfeel is on the thin side of syrup, low carbonation, silky. Overall, this is a heavy hitter, but seems like it's missing something to me."
"Pours an inky black beer with a small cap of dark brown foam. Lacing is spotty and minimal. The nose is full of roast, chocolate, char and a little smoke. The mouthfeel is velvety and smooth. Body is medium or so. Could use a little boost. But it lends to a lot easier beer to drink, which could be dangerous with this one. Very lightly carbonated. The taste is full of dark oils....anise, tar, black licorice, tobacco and char. It's really quite a nicely integrated flavor profile. Plus there's that flavor packed residue that lingers long after you drink. Alcohol is hidden quite nicely behind all the roast and blackened malts. Roasted bitterness lingers. Quite a nice accomplishment here. A good ""sipper."""
"This is a slow-sipper. Personally, not as impressed as I was hoping to be, but an interesting beer, nevertheless."
"D: A fantastic stout, but one is more than enough."
"Drinkability: DEFINATELY A SIPPER! But a good sipper... I believe that this is my FIRST American Double (Imperial) Stout... I've had a few Russian Imperial Stouts B4.... and I will definately note that this ADIS is bigger than any RIS I've tried!... The alcohol is more present. I will have to grow into these...."
"Bottle bought at some supermarket place in East Lansing a month ago. Not quite opaque, but nearly so. Extremely small head of medium-brown layered onto a black body. Sticky brown lacing. Smells boozy and of chocolate and thick malts. Notes of charcoal, coffee and the other usual suspects. Tase is huge. Oaky thickness with a large coffee presence that's bitter, but in a way that doesn't make you think ""why am i sucking on some old wet coffee grounds?", as some beers tend to do. No, its an obvious hop bitterness that melds well with the rest of the beer and that I imagine would fade as you aged this. Some hints on the finish of oak, raspberry and plums. Tastes delicious. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous, like black olive oil. Chewy, almost, or like a melted milkshake. I think the mouthfeel makes this beer. This might be the first beer from S.T. that I've REALLY liked. I'm a sucker for a tasty stout, i guess."
"Thick, silky body, very full and low carbonation. Alcohol comes out more in the nose and feel as it warms. Very well done, but maybe a bit overwhelming. A 22 oz. bottle of this is good to share. Very nice."
"The only thing that could possibly make this one better is some age. Other than that, it's really tasty. A true winner that I thouroughly enjoyed and will seek out again."
"D: Nice beer. Its the balance that makes this beer a winner. Not too dominant in one direction or another, just a very nice double stout to drink on a cold evening. Very smooth for the high alcohol content."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" dark brown head over the opaque black brew. Head holds steady, with sticky slow-falling lace. Aroma is moderately of malt & dark fruit. Taste is dark sweetness upfront, a shot of fruit coupled with strong bitterness, of both the hops and coffee type, and closes with alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is velvet, but the closing bitterness pushes a bit too hard, with style-appropriate drinkability. A pleasing nightcap."
"d - wonderful sipper. first time i've had this and i loved it. has a little heat to it and it would be incredible on a very cold night. good fresh and might even get better with age. i have another bomber that i'm going to age for a year and see what happens."
"All in all, this was an outrageously rich, complex and unique beer. I was very impressed with the creative liberties that Southern Tier took on this already extreme style."
"This beer is excellent. Highly recommended."
"$9.76 for the bomber."
"Would like to try this one in a bottle to see if its as good bottled."
"Overall: Very nice, robust and big. Not nuanced, but an 11% imperial stout really isn't designed to be, right? Very drinkable given the specs. I'll buy it again."
"Pours an opaque darkness with an impressive dark brown head that fades fairly quickly, leaving behind a full, but light, speckled lacing pattern that resembles the surface of a citrus fruit. The smell immediately reveals the alcohol content within. It has that vanilla cherry oak barrel treatment aroma and the onset reminds me somewhat of the sweetness of a dark chocolate / caramel / oat / coffee Cadbury Easter Egg. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is that classic smooth and syrupy American Double Stout with that widely sought after 'coating texture' only found with premium Double Stouts. The flavor mirrors the nose. At 12.5% ABV, its a good idea to make this one the last one for the road or the first one from the Barcalounger. Really glad that Southern Tier decided to bottle this one! Highly recommended!!!"
"Wait for this fellow to warm up. All of its goodness will show itself when closer to room temperature. This isn't very very special, in my opinion, but it's very good. Considering the very competitive category this holds its own very well. Oat ought to be included in a double stout side by side."
"Mouthfeel is stupendous and is the most fascinating aspect of this beer. Extremely viscous, thick and amazingly smooth makes sipping this beer very enjoyable. Very low amounts of carbonation enhance the mouthfeel. Drinkability is dangerously high for this brew, but I will note that the bottle marks this one at 11% rather than the 12.5% listed on Beeradvocate. Highly recommended stout as we move into the colder months."
"Could this be too much of a good thing? I certainly could not drink this regularly."
"Quite the pleasant and comfortable RIS and one that I look forward to sampling again. Pretty much a top-notch example of the style and one that I would recommend. Add a little more complex flavor and some head and this would be a competitor for the best RIS on the planet."
"Another good brew from Southern Tier. This is from the Blackwater series. Is this the first? And what's the difference from the Imperial series? Is the Blackwater series all stouts? Enough ramblin' I just want to try them all."
"My first sample of this hearty brew came from a 22oz bomber. Upon pouring into a standard pint glass, the color was dark as midnight...no light shining through this baby! The liquid emitted an aroma of coffee, chocolate and a lot a malt. The taste was everything i suspected and more. Very chocolatey, toasted coffee, roasted malt and a little bit of alcohol. The aftertaste was as if I was just sipping on a fresh cup of coffee. The alcohol does kick in a bit after you swallow. Mouthful is very good. Not to syrupy, just right. As far as drinkability goes, it's outstanding. Very good for a glass or two, but anymore than that you'll either be too full or too lit. No sessions here. Good effort by Southern Tier."
"A very good Imperial Oat."
"Overall, a solid oatmeal stout. Interesting combination of barley, malts, oatmeal and slightly spicy hops that seem to change over time and with the beer warming. I was expecting a smoother malt character, and was surprised by the noticeable hoppiness. Certainly worth trying if you haven't had it. When I have an oatmeal stout, I'm looking for something smoother and creamier, but perhaps this is what you're looking for."
"Beautiful inch thick head on the pour from this imperial stout, and the was pour very thick (what's better?) and left a nice lacey tan head after it settled. Smell was very good, a ton of aromas with chocolate and carmel dominating. Taste was amazing, a lot of things going on in my mouth. Very full bodied with dark chocolately malt taste with a hint of molasses. Minor tones of alcohol in the backround. This stout finished clean and I thought I could sense some hoppy undertones at the end, but now that I'm halfway done with a pint I'm not tasting it anymore. This is everything I think an imperial stout should be. Exceptional beer and I recommend it and will definetely drink again. I can't wait."
"Man this is a thick creamy and chewy stout. Very good and again just bursting with big bold dark fruit flavors. So creamy from the oatmeal and a good amount of alcohol in the mouth that does not deter from the taste whatsoever. Black berries, black currant, caramel, mollsses with a hint of residual sugar on the long smooth finish. So much complexity and things going on that I will probably keep adding to this review over my next six bottles."
"D- This has made it to one of my favorite beers out there. The only flaw I can see in it (for my taste) is the bit of coffee in the aftertaste. If this was bourbon barrel aged I doubt you could find a beer as good as this one."
"D- This imperial stout stands out to me as one of the best I have had to date. At such a high ABV the alcohol is not hidden-but it is an important part of the character of this beer and compliments the flavor well. Southren Tier has yet to disappoint me and I am going to continue to try their brews because they always seem to be impressive."
"Drinkability - this is a very good ale, and only its high abv limits sessionability."
"D: An intense oatmeal stout that doesn't let you forget that it's in charge. Despite the price, more of this is needed! More! Southern Tier, we salute you for putting together a fine, fine oatmeal stout."
"D: Hard to drink - I can't say it's refreshing either. It's so thick that you basically have to be hungry to drink it. I'll finish it, but it's going to take me a while, and I think I'll be REALLY drunk at the end."
"D - damn good Imperial Stout."
"drinkability: pretty good"
"All told, this is very good, and probably about step away from the Rapture."
"D - Can't stop sipping this one. Really kind of dig that oatmeally flavor that seems to come around only in the finish and aftertaste."
"Appears a burnt dark black completely opaque shields all and any pigment from the visible light spectrum forms a large thicket of mocha tan head leaves light even lacing as it dwindles down. Aroma is full of burnt roasted malts with dark chocolate cream accented notes with alcohol and ripened fruit blended in. Soft sweet oatmeal girth and a deep herbal minty hop profile express themselves as well. Roasted malt alcohol burn with a chocolate liqueur quality upfront herbal bitterness heavy sweetness raisin and plum galore, as it warms flavors rush the palate even more I have loved every Blackwater Series offering this one is no different loads of flavor oatmeal added with brown sugar sweetness. Mouthfeel is full bodied syrupy thick ass texture, a beer I can definitely bite into carbonation is even carries this heavy body pretty well. Drinkability is great a whole 22oz is my limit but Im willing to share this one next time around, although I might have to track down a whole case."
"This concoction is a battle between chewy, roasted flavors of an Oatmeal Stout and a high octane Strong Ale. Pleasant at times, but unfortunately the abv is too intense even for the Oat's deep, roasted characteristics."
"Bomber bottle, the etched on the bottle label says this one was brewed in the ""fall of 2007""....fresh is good. Pours black and thick, carbonation is fairly low as a vigorous pour only lifted a very minor dark tan film. NIce ringed, fine bubble sheeting. Nose just mildly of some sweetness and then some roasty malts. Nice sipper, plenty of roasted malts, cafe au lait, and hints of smokey, earthyness. The finish here goes on and on, sliky smooth, subtle sweetness, hints of tropical fruits, yeah I taste em...Rich and viscous, more quality, COMPLEX beer from Southern tier. Well done."
"Pours an absolute onyx black with a nice dark brown one finger head that slowly dies down to a thin layer that stays. Stickiness is great, lots of legs holding on all over the sides. Smell is a bit too much in terms of alcohol. Very strong, almost vodka like odors with hints of dark chocolate and espresso. Some sweet oats in the nose as well, but not as much as I would like. Taste is a very dry wood like oat flavor. Super dark french roast coffee flavors mixed with a tiny hint of caramel. A bit of alcohol can be detected on the tongue, but not nearly as much as the smell would lead you to believe. Mouthfeel is not as full as I had anticipated, but still quite thick and chewy with a fair amount of carbonation. I definitely love my Oatmeal Stouts, but this was a bit too much for me, still a very solid brew all around. Southern Tier continues to pump out huge beers, add this one to that list."
"22 oz bomber. The beer is very dark, with just a small hint of light around the edge coming through as a deep deep ruby. A finger of solid milky tan head sits over top and there is a moderate carbonation working up the sides of my glass. I really like the compactness of the foam on this one. The aroma is solid ashy roast with a prevalent oat character with an undertone of solid pine and chocolate, with some fruity esters playing in there as well. It feels just a tad light to me, as I was expecting more force in the smell. The flavor is interesting. I get a strong pine hop and alcohol infusion that blends into a creamy oat that goes to a deep roast that gives ash impressions. It crescendos again with pine hop and a strong but pleasing bitterness. The flavor is bold, with a good bit of complexity. No flavor sticks around too long. I would like to see the alcohol flavors blend better, but I think some time will help that out. Mouthfeel is very thick and a bit slick. This one is distinctly drying to the sides of my tongue. Carbonation is very fine and bubbles are small. This is an enjoyable brew. The alcohol character seems to be settling in a bit as it warms. I think the pine hop is a little strong overall, but again, this would settle in as it ages. I think this one will only get better with age."
"The beer pours a viscuous looking black, with good head retention and lacing. The nose is quite complex with aromas of licorise (quite a bit in fact), coffee, burnt sugar and band aides. If anything the beer is even more complex on the palate, with flavors of sweet cherry cough drop (to the point where the beer is almost cloying), coffee, chocolate, licorise and spearmint. The beer has a pretty good mouthfeel, though the sweetness and abv. are almost overpowering. This is a very good beer, but it's not really very drinkable. A little bit goes a long way and I can't imagine trying to drink a pint of this stuff. Nevertheless, an impressive effort from Southern Tier."
"Pours an opaque black with 2 fingers of chocolate milk head that dies slow. Smells of chocolate notes with roasted malt. Tastes of licorice, bakers chocolate, roasted malt and alcohol. Feels full in the mouth and finishes with a bitterness. A GYNORMOUS and tasty brew indeed though it tastes a little hot right now. A little age would do this one wonders."
"D: Not nearly as good as the Jah-va, but a damn good beer all around."
"I've been waiting a while for this monster and now it's finally here. Served at cellar temperature in a snifter, from a twenty two ounce bottle. Poured a magnificent midnight black. About as black as black can be. About two and a half fingers of dense, coffee brown head formed with a somewhat vigorous pour. Head hung around for quite a while leaving plenty of lace all the way down the glass. Awesome nose on this one! Plenty of chocolate, and coffee like aromas up front, smokey roasted malt, oats, and maybe a bit of vanilla. A little bit of booze was noticeable in the nose as well. This beer was also an explosion of flavor. Tons of chocolate, coffee, roasted toasted malt, and a bit of hops in the background. Had a little bit of smoke and molasses in the finish. The eleven percent ABV was quite boozey and left a quick burn in the throat, but does fit in nicely in the beer. Mouthfeel was oily, thick and almost chewey. Pretty much how any big stout should be. Awesome drinkability despite the high ABV, but it will sneak up on you if you aren't careful. Probably ranks near the top of my list as far as stouts go."
"Not a bad brew at all, but the dryness was hard to deal with."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and slick. Very pleasant alcohol burn. I feel it in my chest. I'm done for the night after one, but I feel really good about it. To bad this is no longer available."
"Part of the Black Water series of big beers from ST,11% ABV per label.Poured an opaque black with a thinner deep mocha colored head atop that left a half ring around my Guinness pint glass.Deep bitter chocolate and espresso coffee in the nose that brought on a bit of earth and fruitiness very deep and entrenched ""dark"" aromas,pretty much perfection on the palate deeply roasted and rich flavors bitter chocolate and molasses dominates up front with a bit of vanilla and dark roast coffee and wood hovers, a big earthy almost leafy presence shows up in the finish.Complex and well rounded the alcohol begins to show some heat after a bit but never intrudes on the flavors,kick ass new ""big one"" from Southern Tier wich I expected."
"A mild dose of hops kicks into the finish along with nothing more than a breath of alcohol warmth. As others have mentioned, a bottle of Oat will be the perfect beer for the snowy, house-bound nights that are sure to come. Fantastic stuff."
"Alcohol is very well hidden in this monster. I cant wait to take some home in the bottle!"
"D- This is a very well built beer with lots of great bold flavor with a nice complexity. It is just delicious. This is a great session beer but at that ABV two is all I can handle before I call it a night."
"Highly recommended; I'll be buying as many as I can get my hands on."
"Pours a thick, black color with a thick and fluffy mocha layer of head that disappears only to leave a faint trace of some lacing along the side. Swirls of brown lacing swim on top of this beer. Smell is dried fruits, black licorice, some dark cocao. Toasted oat malt is present in this one as well, although the traits of an imperial stout seem more present. Taste is rich and full of oat, and dark chocolate with coffee and cream. Slight warming sensation on the chest as this one goes down. The oat malt really makes this a smooth drink in the mouth feeling."
"Picked up this badboy at the brewery yesterday. Pours a complete black with a nice light brown head that leaves ample lacing throughout session. Aromatic experience is mostly a sweet oaty scent with a nice hop infusion. Taste is sweet with nice oat and chocolate mix, slight caramel lingering with a tinge of alcohol, nothing to frown at. A really nice mouthfeel with perfection soothing every inch of the mouth. Nice and smooth. As the bottle says ""A meal in it's self"""
"Black color, with a large, filmy, light mocha colored head, particularly large for being hand bottled. Aroma very reminiscent of Avery Czar; burnt, slightly vinous, with hints of chocolate, roast and charred fruits and fortunately, not flooded with aroma hops like some Imperial Stouts, making it very nice. Big, full, coating body, again, sensational, especially considering it was hand bottled. Flavor is unbelievably rich, with roast, chocolate blanket, charred fruit, and a light hop finish. Beautiful beer. Thanks to my secret santa, whoever you are."
"Draft at MacGregors in Henrietta, NY 4/22/2005. Aroma is sweet and malty, with caramel, coffee, vanilla, and oak. The flavor does not disappoint. Coffee, chocolate, oak, and vanilla. Sweet but not cloying, probably due to a pretty significant hops flavor. No one element dominated, nicely balanced. Huge bodied. Should be savored, but I drank my first so fast I had to order a second. They REALLY need to bottle this stuff. Outstanding."
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a rich, warm black malt scent that is quite powerful. It is full of black patent and some chocolate malts along with a very dry oatmeal aroma. The taste is excellent as well. It is thick and rich with black malts. It goes down slow and warms on the finish. It is really dry and earthy. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great drinking oatmeal stout. It's one you want to drink slow, but it's a good drinker. I have been waiting for the local ""ale house"" to put this on tap for some time now. I was worth the wait."
"If you're a fan of stouts and you happen to find this one, don't hesitate!"
"poured black black black, with little head until I poured it into a big glass and it produced a thick creamy dense tan head that lasted until the final drop. very balanced and smooth aroma with a bit of alcohol. intense concentrated creamy oily mouthfeel and is so smooth. surprisingly little roasted character, would expect some some from a heavy stout like this. oats seem to mellow and smooth out the rough edges on this. so so drinkable despite the alcohol content. don't even think about letting this get pass you with out trying it."
"Had this on tap at Maxie's. Deep black colored beer with a dark brown hue around the edges. Dark chestnut colored head was thick and dense. Aromas of chocolate and roasted malt with a bit of alcohol and some cherry? I swear I was getting a wiff of NyQuil in there. Same chocolate and roasted malt in the flavor along with a bit of marshmallow and some of that astringent oatmeal flavor poked its head in for a second. There was enough bitterness to cut the sweet malt flavors. Mouthfeel was thick and juicy just coating your mouth with flavor. Body was nice and thick. I wanted another one, but at $7.25 for a 12oz glass it was a bit too pricey. I'm glad I didn't get another because that 12.5%abv kicked in about 20 minutes later. Definitely recomended if you can get your hands on it."
