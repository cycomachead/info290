"O: Very lucky to have this on tap without having to fly to Grand Rapids."

"On tap at Oak Cafe in Wyandotte. Best beer I've ever had."
"On tap, the beer is jet black and thick, with a thin, tan head. Aromas of rich cocoa nibs, coffee, vanilla, hints of maple, woody highlights, and a bourbon undertone. Flavors are rich and sweet forward, with bittersweet chocolate blending perfectly with vanilla and maple. Wow! Backbone of subtle coffee, hints of bourbon, and a building warmth. The body is smooth, creamy, and velvety smooth. There is a candy sweet aftertaste of chocolate, maple, and vanilla. It's like an awesome piece of candy. The finish is amazingly smooth, with a subtle roasted coffee and maple linger. This is an amazing beer!"
""
"Phenomenal job by Founders; if only they could make this with more frequency."
""
"Yup. 5's across the board. It dominated kbs in a tethered tasting. Maple flavor brings everything together perfectly. Drink it warm tho. Don't b scared to wait 30-45 mins after the bartender hands it to u. It'll b worth it."

"incredible beer."

"This poured ever so slowly and thickly from the tap and coalesced to a fine brown head. The nose was a bit soft but playful with light coffee, oak wood, chocolate and bourbon. The front end displayed a delicious and decadent chocolate that opened to a roasted coffee. The bourbon is subtle with some added caramel and toffee. The funny thing is that the maple is ever present, never pervasive and blends seamlessly throughout. This is so smooth and velvety that it really lives up to the hype."

""
""
"I had this for the first time today at a specialty keg tapping at The Flying Saucer in Kansas City. I can honestly say this is one of the greatest beers I have ever had."

"O- this is a great beer, & it for sure lives up to the hype... but I wish it had more chocolate & coffee and less maple syrup."
"Overall: so happy I got to try it. Now that I havr I will likely randomly and unintentionally come accross it a dozen more times. Worth the wait but still not the best beer I have add but damn close"
""
""
""
""
"When I first got into beer this was the whale du jour. Never thought I'd get to drink it."
""
"This beer was great. I didn't pick up as much coffee as I did chocolate and a maple syrup flavor. Had a bit of a burn on the lips from the bourbon but not too much. Really hoping since all of these kegs popped up that this will be bottled again this year!"
""
"Mouthfeel: Full bodied and luscious"
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Great far beyond anything else."
"Amazing! Black liquid gold! Find it and enjoy it."
""

""

""
""
"As I sip (and as it warms) new flavors keep emerging, like a good whisky. Sweet but not cloying, bourbony but not overpoweringly so, it is just beautifully put together, like if Mozart was a brew master."
"My god this was a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely not overrated.  This blows KBS out of the hemisphere.  Smooth, coffee, bourbon and maple are all present."
""
""
"Would buy as much of this as possible any time I see it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful beer. The maple sweetness makes you crave it the next day. If I had to be critical, I would say it was just a skosh thin. Well worth the two-hour wait."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amazing. Complex, flavorful, full bodied. Let it warm up to let the layers come out."

"On tap @ Clinton Hall 3/24/15. This was simply the best beer I have ever tasted. Perfection in a glass."
""
""
""
"I was surprised by the heavy Chocolate tones and sweetness of this stout that was on tap. Until now, my favorite stout has been Rogue Double Chocolate Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"These notes of Maple need time to settle. Chocolate is on point!"
""
""
"On Tap. Cornerstone Pub in Barre, VT. 3/20 and 3/21"
""
""
""
""
""
"Nah, no forced reviews today."

"EBF pour. Pours black and viscous. Smells of hearty coffee, burnt sugar and maple syrup with wood. Flavor is very roasty and dense with a bunch of java, chocolate syrup, maple syrup, burnt sugar, and bourbon. Espresso and dark chocolate. The feel is very syrupy and thick. Sticky with noticeable heat and lingering barrel character. Finally got to notch this one on the bedpost. A pretty terrific beer."
""
""
""
"This is it, my first 5! On tap at Cornerstone in Barre. Intense maple like I've never tasted in a beer before. Decadent and smooth, coffee has a velvety feel to it. So very happy to have had this and sad that I may never have it again."

"I am waiting in a 30 minute line for this, so it must be good.  Canada is nice as is coffee and chocolate.  I think this is a good review.  Still in line......if you're reading this give me a call"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Too similar to KBS to even tell apart to me..still amazing though"
""
""
"Its everything i dreamed it would be"
""
""
""
""
""
"It had a nice tan head that left quickly, and this beer was thick and chewy.  I can't think of how a stout could be better."
""
""
""
"Good beer. Lots of vanilla notes especially on back end. Not enough bourbon flavor IMO. Good though."
""
"Just an amazing stout from Founders, was lucky enough to have while picking up my KBS last week.  Perfectly balanced in all aspects.  Hope to have again in near future."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the best stouts I've ever had. The Maple Syrup made it such a unique and great experience"
"I was so disappointed in this after having the KL Summation and SR-71 that I dumped it in order to get something else quicker."
""
""
"more boozy as it warmed, but the maple really showed through.  definitely a very impressive stout that could once have been considered the best, but nowadays has a lot of competition. still world class.  mouthfeel is still great.  a beer worth seeking out but not one that you should abandon everything for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: overall this is what all barrel aged stouts should stride to be. It has all the flavors you would want and more with the added maple syrup 10/10 would drink"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap @Huna Day 2015 poured into taster"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: Amazing!!!!"
""
"breakfast stout that isn't bitter.  Awesome beer."
""
"On tap @ Cooper's in Scranton, PA.   Keg kicked in a little over an hour I'm told.   Came out cold with a beautiful head, pitch black.    This beer is most certainly not meant to be drank cold, so I took a few reference sips and let it warm.    When warmed, this is one of the best beers I have ever had.   Oak, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, and a touch of maple sweetness.   So glad I was able to have this, it is, in my opinion,  the perfect BA stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very solid, top notch beer.  It's really a debate for me where this belongs amongst the cream of the crop of my top beers.  I don't think it overtakes them for overall enjoyment (see sweet front vs roasted bitter back), but it belongs in the group."
""
""
""
"This struck me as a bit of an ""amped-up KBS"" which, I guess it is! Just delicious and highly recommended if you can find it."
""
"Not bad but an incredibly overrated beer."

"One of the best beers ever!!"
""
""
""
"Yeah, as good as advertised. On draft in Vermont after a successful day at Hill Farmstead. I think as far as stouts with maple syrup go, I still prefer Beyond Good and Evil by a nose. Chalk that up to being a HF homer. Still, I was pleased to have this on draft."
""
"Absolutely phenomenal. Grammar notes of chocolate, coffee, and other deliciousness."
""
""
""
""
"Full of maple and vanilla, accompanied with roasted malts, milk chocolate, mild coffee. Rich, full, creamy body. A terrific stout."

"O- This lived up to the hype for me. Delicious stout that isn't actually maple heavy, but it feels maple heavy on the finish with a ton of chocolate and coffee. Altogether, this is a very different beer than Good Morning or Mornin' Delight but I honestly think these are very different beers (coffee, chocolate and aged in maple bourbon barrels vs coffee and added maple syrup) and I haven't had anything quite like this before. Worthwhile and would definitely go out of my way to drink this again."

"A true world-class Imperial Stout. Take one small sip out of the tap and wait. Be patient for about 15 - 20 minutes and let it warm a bit. Take your next sip and the flavors will blow you away."
""
"This beer is phenomenal. Lucky to grab some at a local tap event. Pours pitch black with a khaki colored ring of head. Smell is amazing with notes of maple syrup and bourbon. Taste matches the aroma perfectly. Glad to have had the opportunity to try this."
"I love imperial stouts, bourbon and maple, and don't mind a good cup of coffee either.  So I was pumped to finally get a chance to try this beast.  It did not disappoint.  While the maple was not prominent in the smell, it was perfectly present in the taste without being syrupy.  Mouthfeel was spot-on, and probably the best feeling stout since BCBS.  As far as Founders rankings go, I would put them in this order CBS > FBS > KBS (all behind BCBCS, however)."
""
""
""

"Every beer should strive to be this beer!"

"One of the best stouts from this brewery yet.  Enjoyed the multitude of complex flavors on draft  wow great stuff!"
""
""
""
""
""

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Probably the best beer I've ever had the chance to try."
""
"O: I wasn't blown away by this beer, but glad I got to sample. 10oz is plenty for me."
"O: The hype is entirely missed on me. I just don't understand it."
"On draft at Worthy Burger. Amazing"
"On tap. Worth every bit of $8. A fantastic beer. Will be on the hunt for this forever."
""
"Straight from the Founders tap room, this pour was a dark, smooth, bourbon masterpiece"
""
""
""
""
"Review 1300!"
"Overall (4.5), a really fantastic beer and I can really understand where the excitement over this one comes from. Though this version was not the original Backstage version, if it had been, it would immediately rank ahead of all the other Backstage beers I've had (with Sweet Repute probably being the runner-up). Glad I got to sample this legendary beer."
""
""
"Not as amazing as I was hoping"
""
""
"Taste is dominated by praline and bourbon; very barrel forward compared to the first vintage, which I thought presented more maple than this one."
"Served on tap at 2 locations within a week of each other, little to no maple on the back end predominantly coffee/chocolate like FBS until the beer warmed up to room temperature then maple was the primary flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet nectar of the Gods, this beer is GENIUS! If you have an opportunity to drink this beer TAKE IT. You will remember it until the day you die."
"KBS with a smoother finish - the bourbon is well balanced (mostly comes through in the vanilla aspect), and the maple adds a slightly sweet note on the front and back ends. Lots of chocolate as it warms up. Stellar stout that stands up to its hype."
"Very cloying, worthy of the hype. Very complex and enjoyable."
"In the end, this is very much KBS with maple syrup and the maple sure does help cover up the flaws of KBS."
""
""
""
""
"One of the finest beers I've ever encountered on this planet."
""
""
"O: This beats the hell out of KBS. KBS - especially when fresh - can have a char-dominated flavor and the maple cuts that down in this. Very sweet flavors , but not sugary, which is aided by the coffee and hops. This lives to the hype and is one of best crafted beers on the planet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Unbelievable, decadent beer!  Aroma was maple, toasty, coffee.  Flavor was very similar to KBS, except the maple came through in hints as the beer warmed.  Mouthfeel was fuller and more silky than KBS.  Such a pleasure to drink."
""
"Draft: Subtle maple aroma/taste.  Heavier bourbon on the nose and palate."
"I waited to make my judgement until having 3 pours last night - I have determined, it is better than KBS, but I'm not it is by much.  I left wanting more maple (maybe BBBM ruined me)."
""
""
"Black with a clingy beige head that bubbles up into a ring and plasters some lacing on the glass. Aroma is only slightly hot…bourbon, maple syrup, chocolate, vanilla, fairly mild sweetened coffee, nuts, and light molasses.  More vinous than the flavor and increasingly chocolaty.  Flavor is a wonderful blend of semi-sweet chocolate, vanilla, coffee and cream, and maple syrup – surpringly not too cloying.  Smooth and not too boozy at all, the syrup increasing as it warms leading into coffee beans, berries, oak, cocoa, and pipe tobacco.  Full and creamy smooth, though not insanely thick (which isn’t such a bad thing).  I took the better part of an hour to drink my glass, but it was never a struggle – just something I felt the need to savor."

""

"Wish founders would serve it at a little warmer temperature .... Once it warms up everything comes out in this beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what can I say about this beer I haven't already said about founders. Over hyped."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Let it warm and open up from the tap and it's amazing"
"This beer is really good. I tried it along side 2013 KBS at Founders and there was no comparison. Less chocolate with a maple syrup sweetness than KBS. Really,really good beer but should not under any circumstance be rated higher than KBS. It's  rated higher right now because of the recent draft room releases and not because it is better than KBS. When March comes around that will change."
"Smells like breakfast in a glass. Maple, robust coffee, and roasted oats. Flavor is complex and intense. Maple goes well with the bitter coffee, vanilla, oak, booze and caramelized malts that convey a residual sweetness. Creamy and rich, yet very quaffable. Probably the best founders beer I have had. Didn't totally blow my mind like some other great BA stouts, but very good. Happy to have this tick. The keg at Waldo Pizza cashed out in 14 minutes."
""
""
""
""
"How could it be made better. Booze mellowed as it warmed. Would love to be able to age."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow, found this beauty on tap. Fantastically smooth with a hint of sweetness. Get the maple sugar coming through. No alcohol taste cutting through. I'd say second only to the KBS"
""
""
""
"Outstanding beer.  The maple aroma really comes through.  Tan colored head on first pour that dissipated quickly.  Strong Bourbon notes on the nose as well.  Upon first taste the sweetness and richness of the maple comes out with a nice bourbon feel and light coffee flavor.  The perfectionist in my would like a bit more coffee, but that's just being picky, I felt this beer, with all the strong flavors was well balanced and very smooth."
""
""
"wow. this absolutely lived up to the hype."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On draft. Perfect after warming a bit, but if left too long the maple really comes out and overpowers with sweetness. Really glad I got to try it, definitely worth the trip."
"2014 version on tap. After all the hype, I was honestly a bit disappointed. Started with a nice looking head and great coffee  and maple aroma, but after that it was downhill. Waaaay too sweet and not bourbon forward enough for my taste. So sweet that it overwhelms everything else. Seemed to get even sweeter as it warmed. Still a really good beer and I'm glad I had a chance to try it, but it's nowhere near the best beer I've ever had and I wouldn't go out of my way to have it again."
"Glad I had the chance to try this; thought it was a beer I'd never get the opportunity to have.  Love how the maple sits in the beer and gets really good when its thoroughly warmed up.  May never have it again but I shall enjoy this taste."
""
""
""
"One of the best beers I've ever had and one that certainly lives up to the hype. Never thought I'd get a chance to try this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Worth the wait. A very 'big' but well-balanced BA imperial stout. The maple was just right. Lots of chocolate and coffee and bourbon which I love. Not cloying or syrupy as one might imagine. A beer to be fussed over, indeed!"
""
""
""
""
"O: I almost skipped this tapping knowing it was going to be a mess. However, the folks at the Gnome handled this perfectly. And, this is about as close to perfect gets, with well you know not being such. I was surprised by how balanced it was. I could drink this daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Please bottle again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic beer by Founders. CBS looks like most stouts should look and feels like a 10% beer should feel. However, the taste and smell are top notch. Maple and coffee dominate the nose. I rarely am able to pick up more than 2 flavors in a beer, but this one has 4 easily distinguishable tastes that do not dominate whatsoever. Maple, coffee, chocolate, and bourbon all show up with no heat at all. This is the ultimate breakfast beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"4.35.  Betty good beer. I had it on tap. Get a bourbon and maple taste that is well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great blend of maple and bourbon.  So good!"
""
"O: One of the best beers I've ever had."
""
"Recently had this on tap, as part of a Founders tap takeover and rare tasting event. I had lusted after this longer than any other beer I can remember. But I have to be honest ;  the bourbon was overpowering and it was extremely  cloying. I know Founders does big, bold, in -your- face beers, And I do like some BA beers, but this was too much. Please don't misunderstand what i'm saying here. If you love beers with a huge bourbon flavor, then you will probably enjoy this one. I had BCBS back to back with CBS, and like the GI and plain ol' FBS much better."
""
"Overall: a killer take on the breakfast beer. I really like all the fudge taste that comes through. a serious step up from KBS and FBS, certainly worth tracking down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This let me down. A fantastic beer but seriously not even close to what the hype makes it out to be."
""
""
""
""
"Good job Founders."
"On tap 1/29/14, enjoyed with a fellow BA'er which made for an even more memorable experience.  Barrel characteristics are present, but so much more going on!  First time getting such a nice chocolate flavor that blends so well with a barrel aged beer.  No one flavor dominates, every sip is a new experience.  Worst part was knowing I probably will not be able to have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Fresh from the Taproom today - doesn't get much better!"
""
"Can beer taste better than this?"
"This is a truly standout beer.  Flavors blend perfectly. Nothing overpowers the other flavors. A magical drinking experience."
""
"Wow! So smooth! Need more!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's the unicorn of beers"
""
"Poured at Rustico in Va. Smell is fantastic, mouthfeel is velvety and the maple is present and so delicious it had you smacking your lips for more. Maple syrup is not too sweet. Doesn't overpower the chocolate and bourbon notes. Really lucky to try this"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a world class beer, and I'm glad to have had a shot at it.  Really well done"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the nectar of the gods"
""
""
""
"Tastes incredibly smooth.  Abv is barely noticeable, but the bourbon, maple and chocolate really shine through."
""
""
""
""
""
"Let this beer warm and it'll unlock some pretty amazing flavor."
"A-"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Maple is a bit lacking from what I expected, but it comes with a somewhat more substantial overall flavor than regular KBS. It might be the maple syrup barrels slightly enhancing the experience, but it doesn't come forward as obvious maple flavor or aroma. Somewhat of a letdown given all the hype, but a solid barrel aged stout regardless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"not as much maple as expected, almost just a KBS"
""
""
""
""
"Lives up to the hype. Taste is better than the aroma which is already solid."
""
"So good it kinda ruins everything else"
""
""
""
"Today is March 23, 2015 and I have now adjusted my original review of 4.23 since today I had the chance to have CBS on draught at Cask Republic in Stamford. What a beautiful treat."
"How do I give something over a five??"
""
""
"Stop chasing this beer. Its like a baby BCBS. I lived in Michigan and my family is from Michigan, they don't get out much I assure you. They are hyping Founders and all their beers from their snowed in houses for six months straight to their advantage by now."
""
"2011 vintage...bottle has held up nicely. No signs of oxidization. Maple has fallen off slightly but still subtle hints on the nose and taste."
""
"Love this beer. Thank you Founders!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thought the 100 rating might have been people just hyping it up. Nope. It's just that damn good. 10oz pour, and I could've had another gallon of it and not been enough. Did not want my glass to end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this side by side with KBS and it blew KBS away.  Loved the chocolate and sweet notes from the maple syrup.  My group couldn't even drink the KBS after having this!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Knocked it out the park. Home Run. The coffee and chocolate compliment the maple syrup perfectly. Will never get tired of drinking this nectar of the gods. I would love to just soak in a tub full of this stuff."
"Had it at Closed for Business in Charleston, SC, January 14, 2015.  While it is very good, it's not my favorite BA beer.  It's a bit too sweet for my taste.  It is not over-hyped, though and does deserve its place among the zymurgical elite."
"Excellent beer, but KBS is better..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I was happy that the hype was met. This is a delicious beer!"
"You know you've got a good beer buddy when he offers you his grower fill leftovers, and it's 16 ounces of this stuff!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Outstanding!  Smooth and silky mouth feel.  Taste has sweetness(maple,chocolate) and a hint of whiskey.  Great balance of the two.  Worth the hunt to track this down."
""
""
""
""
""
"Finally, I thought I lost my chance back in 2010/2011!  Initial taste was absolutely phenominal.  Kind of tasted a bit more adjuncty (not in a good way) as I sipped/let it warm.  Still, really awesome."
""
""
""
"O- Worth all the hype and didn't disappoint. Great beer."
"Holy shit, delicious.  I only docked it from a 5 because I hold out hope that the best beer I've ever tasted still exists or is yet to be made.  Until then this was it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had the unbelievable luck of trying this at black rock in chicago on vacation. Pours pitch black with a small brown head. Smells of bourbon, vanilla, syrup, and chocolate. The smell is so balanced it was almost impossible to wait any longer before trying it. Spoiler: it tastes just like it smells. So smooth and balanced and this beer definitely lives up to the hype. A light alcohol burn (whisky flavored) with medium carbonation and a chewy mouthfeel. Overall this beer is fantastic and greatly deserving of its legendary status. So glad I had the chance to finally chase this whale down!"
"Would be better score but more recent bottles had significant fall off"
""
""
"Incredible. Served cold. Very boozy and thin. As it warmed it opened and became incredibly luscious and flavorful. Beautiful mouth feel. Silky smooth. Huge maple and coffee. A super and special brew."
""
"Overall, this beer has huge expectations to live up to, and for the most part it does. The maple flavor is a great addition to the base stout's delicious coffee. I wish there was more of the bourbon flavor to go around, but that's just my preference. In the end, this is a very, very good beer, but it is not mind blowing."
""
""
""
"Overall very solid.  However there were sky high expectations for this beer, and it's not on the same level as the heavy hitter BA stouts.  I found it similar to '14 BCBCS, only sweeter, in a good way."
""
""
"Recommendation: No matter what it takes, every fan of craft beer needs to try this at least once."
""
""
""
""
"WOW!  Unreal!  Enjoyed the 2014 release on tap and it was killer!"
""
"Absolutely awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I can't call it perfect because I don't think I'll ever find that beer."
""
"Please make this again Founders!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've had the pleasure to have this and KBBS. I give KBBS the advantage. It didnt have the think viscous mouth feel that KBBS had, the maple flavor just wasn't as prominent. I know I've filled this review with negative thoughts in comparison to KBBS(best beer I've had), but don't get me wrong this stuff is outstanding and worth hunting down. Amazing flavor profile and an outstanding beer. 4.90."
""
"Overall: A very smooth beer with rich, dark flavors of coffee, maple and chocolate."
""
""
"I had not reviewed this beer but have had it a few years ago in bottle and on draft during the same release.  It is a amazing stout with the flavours of Canadian whiskey barrels abounding.  We got to drink from a sixtel and I had five pours in one sitting.  Fortunately I lived down the street and was given a heads up about the release in advance.  Thanks Travis!  Just wanted to check this one off for posterity.  Hopefully will have it again and be able to give it a more through review."
""
""
""

"Top to bottom, lives up to the hype and then some. As this stout warms up many layers are revealed, with a great interplay between the dark chocolate, coffee and bourbon notes with a delicate yet pertinent maple syrup sweetness that brings this all together. There are touches of caramel and vanilla that open up during warming. Nothing is overwhelmed here, all pieces add up to an exceptional barrel aged stout. Deep dark in color with a thin tan head, the nose invites you in to enjoy."

"O: Hype is a letdown; seek out a beer because you want to, and because you’re a fan of the genre. No hype here just a complex, very well executed, delicious stout"

"This has got to be the best imperial stout i've ever had. Beautiful aroma of chocolate and coffee with the perfect sweet smell. The taste is very rich and flavorful. The chocolate really stands out in a great way. Its a MUST HAVE for imperial stout lovers."
""
"Poured thick and sits with almost no head. Smell is a kick of sweet maple, dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon. Taste is exactly the same, it's sweet, maple candy, coffee, bourbon, vanilla, some brown sugar, and dark chocolate. Texture is plenty thick, coats your tongue  and lingers for a long time.This beer is seriously amazing, a sweeter upgrade from kbs, which is already damn amazing so that's saying a lot! So glad I got lucky enough to try this at the taproom, a memory that I will never forget."
"O - awesome.  About as good a stout as I've ever had."

"Extremely sweet. Would have liked more maple to have come through for as cloying as it was. Lots of burn from the bourbon as it warmed. Not a bad beer, but not even close to being a top tier bourbon barrel aged stout. Absolutely does not live up to the hype."

"O- Certainly the best beer from Founders I've had and a big improvement on KBS, although I'm led to believe they are two different base beers. A prefect beer for Christmas time, you just want to curl up next to a fire and enjoy this stuff. Definitely a beer that lives up to the hype. I can see how some might find it a bit sweet and not more adjunct heavy (chocolate, coffee, maple) than barrel heavy but I think all aspects of the beer are well balanced."

"On tap at the Founders tap takeover at Coopers in Madison. Poured thinner than I thought it would. Dark body with a creamy head. Sweet caramel aroma. Not much coffee smell. Sticky sweet taste. Lots of maple. Very smooth. Never really had a beer like this. Some chocolate and coffee tastes. Very delicious!!!!"
""
""
""
"Thick and dark with a lasting brown head. Smells of sweet chocolate and coffee. This beer drinks like a chocolate milkshake. The maple is forward and sweet. Chocolate fudge brownie, coffee and light bourbon flavors follow. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. This is an ideal dessert beer. It is sweet and decadent. Alcohol, what alcohol? Despite some bourbon flavor there is nearly no heat. Overall it's a little too sweet but I'm very happy to have tried this."
""
""
""
""
"On tap.  Truly fantastic, and much tastier than KBS. Not quite as flavorful, nor as complex, nor as smooth as Panther Cub or Founders' best product ever, Curmudgeon's Better Half, which had more of the maple present.  I compare them because the three beers have similar aging, in the bourbon/maple syrup barrels."
""
""
""

"Bottle, black pour almost flat. Aroma is weird, stale air, like a dense wet cave. Taste is completly different, lots of coffee. Cant find the bourbon or maple."

"Overall - Okay, I'm just going to say it. I've recently had FIS, KBS, and now CBS. And honestly, I would put them in this order: FIS, CBS, and finally KBS. Yes that's right, FIS would be first. CBS is a fantastic IS, but honestly after this bottle I would not seek it out again - I truly feel that FIS is a better beer, and thank heavens, as I can get my hands on this at will. The maple here is very flavorful and interesting, and the balance and complexity here is incredible. I can't knock this beer by any means, but I won't lose any sleep knowing that it is retired. Now if they retired FIS, then we would have a problem... cheers :)"

"Had to change my rating after having this 3 times on draft during KBS week.  The first review was based on having a bottle June '14 that was incredibly sweet.  This was one of the best, if not the best, beer I've ever had.  The aroma did not knock me over so I'll ding that a little to prevent this from being a perfect 5."

"I'd liken CBS to falling asleep in a humidor flooded with cocoa. This is a huge, baroque stout. I hear tell that fresh, this brew was dominated by coffee and maple. Those seem less present in this bottle, but I loved ever sniff and sip of it. I couldn't drink this every week (which I definitely could with KBS), but I'd love another snifter of it sometime. Fat chance, that happening."

"Deep black body with some lighter hues on the surface when swirled. You can smell a bit of the maple still on the nose and it lightens up the bourbon scent. Very warm and inviting scent that is well rounded. This beer is very smooth. The slight maple flavor combines well with the vanilla, oak, and light bourbon flavors. The body is well made and slightly thinner than a bourbon county. It is very much a full and richly flavored beer. Some said that the beer has not gained anything with age. I have no base to compare it to. I would say this beer is currently drinking very well but the maple is not acutely strong. You may want to set up a bottle share and get on this one."
""
"Many claim this beer is over-the-hill, and I suppose since I never had fresh CBS, I wouldn't be able to tell personally. However, I can tell that this beer is definitely not ""over-the-hill"" and that while the maple flavor may has eroded over time, this is still a very good beer."
"Overall: My first time with this gem. I hate the 5/5 review but this beer deserves it. I could be more lengthy and masturbatory with my review but this beer speaks for itself. Worth every dollar I spent."

"I enjoyed this brew last night with my brother and brother-in-law (who's actually from Canada... Edmonton, Canada, born and raised). We all agreed this ale was delicious from start to finish. Popping the cap, you take in the coffee, chocolate, maple syrup, and bourbon aromas. While pouring, you notice the deep, dark color with a head to match. I wish I would've opened this one a little earlier; however, Founders still came through. Some of the flavors weren't as strong, yet still very bold. As many have said, this is a great beer and I'd definitely recommend this one!"
""
""

"Not much I can say. according to my untapped app. I have tried over 600 beers just this year and CBS is the Best beer I have ever had hands down. It is pure perfection from the mouth feel being as rich as it is, the maple coffee, wood flavors. This is what everyone that makes beer should aim to do. This is the beer that sets the stage. If you get a chance to trade for one, do it. There might not be as much life in it at this point but it still has to be good."

"O- this was a special occasion beer, and I must admit that I was quite giddy to try it. It's hard to say whether it stood up to the hype I had built up, but I feel like the fact that it's the 500th different beer I had made it feel special... Besides, I prefer my KBS with some age on it, and I thought Better Half was a bit strong in the maple department when I tried it fresh. That being said, I would have liked the opportunity to try CBS fresh, but that's not how it played out..."

"A few other thoughts: It tasted basically nothing like what I expected it to, and I think it has peaked. Many people talk about the maple flavor really falling off after a couple of months, and I think that was the case here. It was so much funkier than I imagined— I got a lot of the oak of the barrel, as well as sort of anise and licorice flavors. As it warmed up, it got much more interesting— too cold out of the tap, it was hops, booze, and tobacco in one big slam. I keep thinking about how distinctive it was, but I am not sure that means I loved it. Basically like reading the Iliad."

"Trade at the Swamp Head release from burg3. Poured and enjoyed in late spring 2013. HUGE thanks and still feel the need to send some additional studf his way soon. Pours from the 750 ml thick, black and viscous. A one finger brown creamy head forms at the top and lingers for a good while. Big bourbon vanilla aroma that mellows into bittersweet chocolate and then earthy spicy coffee. Taste is big up front chocolate syrup and slight bourbon followed by maple (did not fade in this bottle as others have said), and ending with spicy coffee beans. Earthy mocha lingering on the palate with the maple sweetness. These flavors blend together so seamlessly. Mouthfeel is thick thick thick with lowish carbonation. The bourbon is there but doesn't take over and the coffee ite keeps this from being too sweet. I was worried about being disappointed with this but I am not. What a world class brew."

"now to today... in the past month i have opened 2 bottles, one from my stash, one from a friends... the maple has pretty much, i'd say 99% fell off and is damn near gone... and that is what but the C in Cbs... not saying that this thing went bad or anything of the sort, but be advised, the syrup is damn near gone... so if you have a bottle, open the damn thing, or sit on it for eternity."

"O- This was a very good stout that lived up to expectations but is probably a little bit overrated. I never had this fresh but in my opinion comparing it to both the '12 KBS and '13 KBS (CBS outdates '12 KBS by ~4-5 months) it is falling off a little bit. Like the '12 KBS the coffee seemed to have faded a little bit and there was a little bit more bitterness to the chocolate then I was expecting which was similar to how the '12 KBS compared to the '13 KBS. Overall like the '13 KBS I think I might have enjoyed this a little bit more when it first came out. That being said it was still delicious and well worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
"O - Tastes much better than the nose. Nose is way more boozy than I was expecting. Also, I think this is bit too sweet for me- simply too rich. Too much maple- almost taste a rum flavor. Love the smoothness, mouth is excellent but not is nice as KBS."

"Yet another of the Top 5 knocked out by Redbird. In fact, I'm pretty sure all of the top 5 beers I've had have been from Redbird at this point. Big ups to him. CBS pours black with a finger of head that quickly drops down. The aroma is very sweet, with big bourbon notes shining through a dark fruit and roasted malt base. On the tongue, a smooth maltiness, vanilla, and dark fruit comes through first, then a bit of anise, chocolate, and the faintest hint of coffee on the middle that transitions gloriously to the thing that I can tell gives CBS it's reputation. That awesome, fantastic lingering maple and bourbon aftertaste. The mouthfeel is actually a little lighter than I would have expected. Overall - CBS wasn't my absolute favorite big stout - but I can forgive it, it's a little bit old at this point. It's still very delicious and worthy of the hype."

I've heard all the stories of faded maple, but I can definitely taste it throughout the course of the drink and that extra element makes me like this that much more. If it's even sweeter with more syrup character, I might like it even more. The bourbon dominates here, but that extra maple dimension adds to the complexity nicely. Well done."

"Picked this up in a great trade with Evan! Really thick pitch black pour with a one finger caramel colored head that fades quickly with great lacing. Huge complex woody nose. Tons of roasty coffee and maple up front along with plenty of dark chocolate and hints of bourbon, vanilla, and caramel. The taste is just as big and is also dominated by the sweet maple syrup, roasty coffee, and bourbon. Also getting hints of licorice, bitter chocolate, vanilla, molasses, caramel, and toffee. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with a subtle creaminess and a touch of booziness on the finish. Overall, this is just a tad bit too sweet for my taste. And it fell a little short of all the hype. Would love to try it fresh and see how it compares. Still an awesome beer from one of the best!"

"The beer pours a jet black with almost no head. The nose is distinctly woody and sweet with a touch of bitter chocolate. I'm intrigued...the taste is a punch of distinct maple with a bit of licorice, chocolate, and roasty malts. I don't get the coffee as much as in a bottle of FBS. The mouthfeel is rich and flavorful, fudgy and slightly bitter, with a lingering roastiness. This is one of the most distinctly flavorful stouts I've had, but it doesn't pop with flavors as I'd expected. It's definitely a unique experience, but I'm not sure it's worth the tremendous hype trying to get a bottle unless it's re-released and consumed fresh."

"Date: April 9, 2012 Mode: Tap Source: Tilia Description: Opaque black pour with some head and great lacing. Aroma bourbon, chocolate, maple and coffee. Starts with a slap in the face of bourbon that lingers as the chocolate and coffee come rolling in, the bourbon then gives way to a sweet delicious maple that is not too strong, before finishing with some more bourbon. Founders how do you do that voodoo that you do so well? Wow, this is amazing, lives up to the hype and then some!!!"

"A tasty beer, and credit for that, but I tell you up front coffee and maple syrup, both in huge abundance on top of their regular breakfast stout, is not my preferred choices. I would rather tuned up chocolate. Lots of true coffee, even the taste of creme (though I understand no real creme used). Very filling, the maple syrup seems added in. Above average mouthfeel,, though not as thick as one could imagine. Thanks to Mike at Champane's for putting this one aside for me."

Great flavour all around - the highlight of the anniversary party, end up having about half a dozen servings of this."

"Finally!!! World Wine and Liquor in Mentor Ohio during Cleveland Beer Week Broke out 1 of my Most anticipated big beers I have yet to try. Thank you Brendan. Unfortunatly only a 5oz. sample, Pours jet black with a fluffy brown head. Smell is largely like the Breakfast Stout or KBS, with dark malts, brown sugar, and coffee, with just a hint of maple. The maple really comes on more on the finish, balancing out the roasted malt and coffee for a memorable Beer. It’s a ""Touch"" too sweet, it’s not too bitter, But it is fantastic."
""
"O: This is definitely one of my top 10 beers, but I honestly slightly prefer KBS over this. Maybe I got lucky with my bottle, but maple aroma and taste was still there, although very subtle."
"Despite the naysayers I firmly stand by my decision to hang on to this for a year. Yes, the maple syrup has faded but so has the bourbon and that allows all those other flavors to shine through. It also feels creamier and a little thicker. Rich, sweet, complex and outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown with medium creamy tan head leaving sticky lacing along the glass. The aroma is a light roast vanilla oak and caramel. Medium mouthfeel with sweet malt and light roast and sweet finish. Hides the alcohol very well making it easy to drink. Really enjoyed this one, a very impressive Imperial stout that definitely lived up to the hype."

"I've had this fresh out of a bottle and now aged in a keg. I prefer the fresher variety, though my scores would not move up much. All-in-all this is a great barrel-aged stout, but there are better examples of the style out there, including from Founders itself."

"On tap @ TPT. Poured a deep, dark brown- one shade away from black- with a nice, lasting head of dark tan foam. The aroma was loaded with fresh bourbon spiked coffee- lots of heavy roasted notes, and also a subtle woody sweetness of maple syrup. The flavor was also heavy on the coffee, just like the regular Breakfast Stout. Complimenting this was a smooth vanilla-maple sweetness, oat creaminess, and oak woodyness. The bourbon, coffee, and chocolate are so bold, that the maple really adds some nice depth and contrast. The mouthfeel was full-bodied and had light carbonation. Sweet, sticky, smooth heavenly viscus liquid. Damn."

"O- Pretty good. Is it the best stout on earth? Idk. I've had KBS, Abyss, Bourbon County, Stone, and Speedway. I truly think that Goose Island's 'Bourbon County' is the best out there, but thats my Opinion. . . Man. Still a Really good beer (4.5)"

"D/O: This beer exhibits powerful sensory qualities, even for an imperial stout. It is also a bit of a mess, although the end result is palatable. Founders KBS can be wildly inconsistent from bottle to bottle; this value-added rendition comes across as an average effort on the KBS scale--neither a disappointment nor a home run."

"O: This is nearly perfect; one of the best beers I have ever had; so many flavors but they work so well off of each other"
""
""
"O - Best beer I have ever had. I have two bottles left and can't wait to open them up and enjoy them, but only for a special occasion."
""
"This beer is fantastic. I probably won't try to land another bottle as it cost me an arm and a leg, but I am very glad that I sprung for it just this once. Highly, highly recommended. And if you have the ammunition to land a bottle, fucking do it."

"Love this beer. One of the main reasons is that it is just so seamlessly integrated- no one flavor dominates, each element of the taste is smell seamlessly flows into the next and plays well together. The pour is black, with a thin head and lacing. Nothing special there, but nice enough. The aroma, however is lovely. Nuanced notes of vanilla, Bourbon, chocolate, and a finish of Maple syrup. Each aroma is noticeable, but it makes a whole greater than a sum of its parts. Sweet, yes, but also complex. The taste is equally enchanting. What strikes me most again, is that each flavor is layered with the others to make a delicious whole. This time, it starts off with a bourbon and maple hit, with the bourbon flavor growing and sharpening into the long finish. The last note you experience is a nice chocolate note that picks up where the bourbon leaves off. Silky smooth, this beer just disappears, only the complex flavors make you linger to contemplate. An exemplary beer."

"O: Good, but not living up to the expectation. Don’t get me wrong this beer is amazing but not worth the frenzy that it seems to have attained. It can’t hold a finger to bourbon county. I really expected more maple notes and they just weren't there."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer poured deep black with no light coming through. I poured vigorously and got about ¼” of mocha head that slowly dissipated. There is some residual lacing throughout the entire time I was drinking this beer. I drank it in a blind taste with KBS and I was surprised by the amount of head compared to the bottle of KBS. Very nice aromas and the sweetness from the maple syrup shines through. I can’t taste the maple syrup but it is definitely sweeter than KBS. I was pleased with the amount of carbonation of this beer and overall it was very good."

"O: A good and solid Imperial Stout. I'm a bit disappointed however because of the relative lack of complexity in this beer. I prefer KBS."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: No doubt this is a fantastic beer.  The aroma could be stronger but the palate profile is absolutely fantastic.   The maple syrup is much more subtle than I anticipated/hoped, and it seems the syrup aging in the barrel has mellowed out the bourbon characters and allowed more of the oak from the barrel aging to come out.  The degree of maple syrup is too subtle to make up for the subdued bourbon character present in the KBS, so I think I actually prefer the KBS.   That being said, KBS is one of my all time favorite beers so being slightly not as great as KBS is a huge compliment.   This is still fantastic and up there with the best stouts/beers I've had."
""
""
"Poured deep black with no light crossing any boundaries here. Off white head that lasted a few minutes before becoming a thin streak. Very nice aromas of burnt toast, caramel, toffee, roasty coffee and a bit of chocolate. Vanilla, cream, and the slightest hint of wood. It's quite good, but I hardly get any maple from it. In fact, it was a bit underwhelming. A decent body with appropriate carbonation, but a bit thin. I'm glad I was able to try this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I can see why people really enjoy this, but it doesn't really go beyond that level for me. Then again, I'm no fan of FBS, and I'm not a huge fan of KBS, so I was expecting to be nonplussed. So it was nice this is a very good beer, but it's not something I imagine I'd seek again. Founder's RIS reigns supreme, in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: incredible BA stout; worthy of the hype (though there are other BA stouts worthy of equal hype)."
""
"Overall: An amazing beer with amazing flavors, I would for sure get this one again. Glad I only shared it with my gf and gave her baby pours so I could have most of it :)"
"this beer is GREAT!!!! In fact it is one of my wife's favorite beer (and that says a lot. Pouring from the bottle into a snifter it is black and viscous with a very thin carmel brown color head. The smell is of bourbon and maple syrup with some coffee and roast to it. Taste in incredible, so much going on. Good thing I only split this with my wife because I love being able to have 2 big glasses of this one!!!! The taste is so smooth and the bourbon is not hot the sweetness of the coffee and maple syrup really round out the beer. This is a world class beer through and through!!!"
"Fanastic. You can set your bar for imperial stouts right here. Founder's knows how to brew a stouts...KBS..breakfast stout..imperial stout.. there is simply no argument here. In the CBS, maple and bourbon elements add layers of complexity to the already outstanding Founder's stout recipe without being overly sweet. Black gold. Holy grail. More please."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is better than FBS and is now the best beer I've ever had by far."
""
"O: not a super crazy beer by today's standards, but a well balanced beer. The coffee is certainly faded, so it's probably not going to age - I should have drank it already."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a really great beer. Very flavorful and rich, and at its best it had a lot of great complexity and balance. Now, it is still delicious, but I wish the coffee and maple were as strong as they were fresh."
"Overall: Every last bit of what I was hoping for and have heard about. I will look forward to this beer again! Might make this a tradition. DLD and CBS! Does it get any better!"
""
"Beer pours black with an off-white head and very nice lacing. Smell is a great mix of coffee and maple with some oak as well. Bourbon really takes a back seat to the other smells, but it's really not missed. The flavor here has incredible balance - there's some bourbon, oak, chocolate, roast and maple all coming together fantastically. Compared to KBS, which I had earlier in the night, it's not quite as bourbon-y, but the maple comes through in a fantastic way. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and very smooth. Overall this beer is damn good. I swear it's tasted a bit different every time I've had it, but it's been great every time. This particular one has more maple than most."
""
""
"O- Everything is pretty well in balance. Didn't smell as good as KBS but CBS wins on mouthfeel."
""
""
"O - One of the best beers I've ever had. It certainly lives up to it's hype."
""
"Ok, it's good. It's very good. I managed to snag one bottle when it was released and I'm content to sitting here and enjoying every last drop, but I'm not sure I'd be as happy if I'd gone through all the hoopla of trading my first born for it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: Incredible stuff, definitely lives up to the reputation as one of the best stouts, and finest beers around. I'll have to track down a bottle of this for myself now!"
""
"Definitely lives up to the reputation, if not the hype. Don't chill this at all. It's actually really drinkable as well."
""
""
"O-hands down, the best beer I have ever had. This is now my third time trying it, and every time I do so, I am more certain in my belief. It's the most perfectly balanced beer I've enjoyed, and achieves everything it sets out to achieve. I find it hard to believe i'll ever find such an ambitious beer so well made ever again."

"I finally had this coveted Founders beer. Being a huge imperial stout snob, I was so thrilled to receive a bottle of this stout as a Christmas gift. The appearance is very black, but when held to the light it appears a dark cocoa brown. When I sniffed, I immediately smelled dark chocolate and bourbon...which I expected. What I didn't expect was how smooth the taste was. I have had Founders KBS before and the bourbon taste/smell was very overwhelming...in a good way though. This tasted more like chocolate than anything else. I would highly recommend this stout to chocolate beer lovers and those who love their high quality stouts. Maybe for those more adventorous than I...enjoy it with some maple syrup covered bacon or sausage for breakfast."
""
"O- This beer is a prime example of how flavor can change based on temp. I change my review midway through and had this beer written off as a dissappinent first, thought I may have had a bad bottle even. Would love to try on tap. IMHO though, after having this, though awesome, KBS is better."
""
""
""
"Edit-had it on tap and it was the same. Really wanted to like this, but O'well!!!"
"O: All in all, this is a smoother version of KBS, as smooth as KBS is. Picture KBS with a heavier sweetness to it and a little more subdued on the roasty / coffee notes. Definitely try this if you love KBS, or just love sweet stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I do like this, like everything else from Founders. Ultra complex, but ultimatly that seems like the downfall for me. To much going on for me to really sit back and enjoy. Very much in the realm of Black Tuesday and even Utopias. Like those beers, one I don't really crave that much."
""
""
""
"O: Another great beer by Founders"
""
""
""
""
"O: I think I had this beer a little to late. It's a good beer but I wish I could of had it fresh off the tap when founders released it. I just don't see how it is the number 3 beer on here. It did not blow me away and It doesn't seem to hold up after time. This is one of those beers you need to have fresh or not at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was such a treat. I've wanted to try this beer for quite awhile. I didn't think I'd ever get a chance to procure a bottle much less have it on tap. Excellent stout!"
"O-Great complexity with a long non-bittering finish. This feels like a breakfast beer, would go great with a hearty breakfast or pairs well with dessert. This was a fun beer to try."

""
"cheers."

"11/25/11. 750mL bottle courtesy dfclav! Tasted alongside the regular BS and a KBS, both 12oz bottles also courtesy dfclav. Thanks, man! The pour is an opaque jet black with a small light brown head that cuts to a ringlet but sticks and laces a bit. The aroma is bold coffee followed by a touch of bourbon/alcohol, wood from the barrel, and a distinct sweetness... but I can’t say I’m getting tons of maple syrup. The difference between this and KBS for aroma seems to be that the bold woody vanilla aspect is replaced by sweetness. The flavor again packs a bold coffee punch at first, followed by loads of milk chocolate, a bit of ash, char, woodiness, and bourbon. The secondary flavors develop into chocolate milk, sweet maple syrup on pancakes, and lingering coffee and bourbon. Compared to KBS on flavor, there’s less of a bourbon punch as well as less of a roasted, bitter coffee punch. Smooth, velvety mouthfeel as always. All in all - pretty good shit! I’d say I still like BS the best, followed by KBS, then CBS."
""
""
"So ultimately an excellent beer, . . . but . . . is it better than Lawson's Maple Barrel? I don't think so. Unfortunately, I 'only' got to have 4-5oz of Lawson's, whereas I'll be drinking these for years to come, so its something I can kind of half assed revisit in terms of comparison. Plus, I have a bunch of real good homebrews that taste eerily similar to this beer."
"Pretty difficult to find fault with, although I'd personally prefer the coffee to be wound back a notch with a corresponding increase in the maple syrup. Totally screams dessert beer."
" Quite overhyped as out of balance"
""
""
"O - S0 happy to have had this compliments of Jason, but everything being said, I would be just as happy to more easily obtain a 4pack of KBS than lose your nuts chasing this. I would gladly have it over and over again, but will be sure to do a side by side with KBS next time to compare and contrast."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I've already gushed over this beer, but need I go on? This is a beer that you will not soon forget. It is a truly memorable beer that is worth every penny. Though I'd take a FBS on a daily basis, it is because this beer is too special for daily consumption. it is meant for special occasions and memorable moments. I certainly will never forget the first time I had it. And I can only hope it won't be the last. Thank you Founders for your dedication to brewing excellence!"
""
""
"Yep, that's right. I dare someone to call me on this. If there were ever a more perfect marriage of flavors it was surely not a beer. The combination of dark chocolate, bourbon, and maple syrup flavors produces feelings in my brain that only one other activity can. It is liquefied sex in a barrel. I had the distinct pleasure to enjoy it at the brewery so it was at its very finest and it is something I'll remember forever. Try this beer, find it and try it as soon as you can. Or let it age and see what wonderful places it's likely to go."
"-unlike any other beer, one i am glad to have been able to try"
""
""
""
"O - This is the Founders beer that is the hardest for me to decide on how I feel about it. Is it good? yes. If I had to choose between only having this or KBS for the rest of my life, I'd probably take KBS. It is also definitely one of the most unique flavor profiles I've ever had in a beer. The syrup and vanilla are definitely present and add a unique complexity to the beer."
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a smooth feel that is modestly carbonated. Awesome arrangement of flavor. This is super easy drinking, I would have it regularly if that was possible. I would of had zero issues killing the entire bottle and looking for more."
""
""
""
"Overall : I really respect Founders and there beer. This beer delivers the goods and really lives up to the hype. Very well done bourbon aged brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A really good beer, one of the best I have had, but I think I prefer KBS which we consume side by side. I was hoping that the maple would come through a little stronger, but still a great beer nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Impression- Very happy I got to enjoy this one on tap! Not as much maple syrup as I found in the bottle version but still an AWESOME 2x Stout! Would recommend finding this on-tap if you get a chance."
""
""
""
"O-This beers is ridiculously quaffable considering all that’s going on and the high alcohol content. As mentioned above, there are a lot of complex flavors going on here. Nice big roasty coffee presence, chocolate, malts, oatmeal, and a very nice bourbon presence all wonderfully balanced by the sweet maple syrup flavor coming from the additional aging. I could drink this beer all day and I’m going to pursue this beer all day so that I can try it again soon."
""
"Ejyoung said he can’t get past the flavor of black jelly beans; ottovon said it’s thinner and less maple-heavy than he remembers; I think there’s too much of that acrid coffee flavor. Bottom line: it’s not world-class, at least at this point. Has the maple dropped off that much? I still think it’s a very solid brew, but lacking the special qualities that inspired people to give up so much for it."
""
""
"Thanks, SourNotes!"
""
""

"O- Easily one of the best beer's I've ever had, the flavors are excellent, subtle and well-blended, this beer is unbelievable, seriously is there anything Founders can't do?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is every bit as good as KBS. On draft, there are times where I think it is better. The maple is much more subtle in the bottled version. Again, it could be the age of the bottle. Regardless, there is no doubt that this is a world class barrel-aged imperial stout. Founders knocks another one out of the park."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a bit sweet for my palate, but very complex."
"O: This is the best beer I've ever had in my life, it literally embodies everything that I could want not only in a stout, but in a beer period. I scoffed at the ridiculous trade value of this brew and its hyper-inflated price on the bay, but now that I've had it I can see why. Believe the hype."
"Sweet maple malts, coffee, a bit of baking vanilla and it all just blends together. Its so smooth and full of flavor. This is quite possibly one of the best brews I ever had. I really do not give a 5 on taste, but this absolutely deserves a 5 - id give it a 6 if I could."
""
"M/O - Very big body with just the right amount of carbonation. Very easy to drink despite the high ABV (not detectable to me). It's a little sweet-forward to me for an imperial stout but that doesn't mean it's not a fantastic beer. Glad I have more to share in the future!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is good to very good but not mind blowing. Maybe the maple faded too much and its better fresh. It has some nice complexities but not in the super top tier for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Scent is initially maple syrup with sweet chocolate. A LOT of chocolate. Perhaps some marshmallow? Vanilla and oak with just a bit of bourbon. A little anise as well. A fantastic nose on this beer! Taste is somewhat of a letdown however. Don't get me wrong, it's a very tasty beer, just had my hopes set higher. Initially sweet chocolate and coffee. Then I get bitter chocolate with some maple syrup and light vanilla. The maple syrup is more noticeable as the beer warms. Finishes slightly bitter with some black licorice. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with a syrupy finish. This is a big beer with ABV well-hidden. Drinkability high. Overall, I'm so glad I got to try this"
"O – All I can say is I wish I had more than 2 bottles and I can’t wait to crack into the other one!"
""
"This must be the most unbalanced beer I ever had. My fillings jumped out of my teeth because of the sweetness. No depth, just sugary maple syrup with the smell of 5-day-old coffee. Reminds me a bit of Peche Mortel on a bad day with diet sugar in it. I’ll take KBS over this overhyped stuff any day! After Darklord, Darkness and KtG, another huge overly sweet letdown from the USA. Drain pour. Hype hype hype"
"I did not realize that this beer had 10.6% ABV, and you wouldn't know it when drinking. The mouthfeel was more smooth than a baby's ass, for lack of better analogy. It was unbelievable, and it's certainly one of the best stouts I've tasted in a long time."

"Overall: The bottle went in a flash. With a party of 4 we could have easily went through a couple of these. It left you wanting more. It was hard to restrain myself and sip and savor. This is definitely one beer that lives up to the hype. I’ve tried Dark Lord, The Abyss, KBS, Breakfast Stout, AleSmith Speedway Stout, as well as several others and I have to say this ranks high in my top 5."
""
""
""
""
"O - Really good. A bit on the sweet side, but super smooth and complex. There were a lot of flavors that I couldn't quite place in the middle, but I loved the coffee domination at the end."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"I love barrel-aged beers and I'm not aware of anyone who does it better than Founders. How can I best summarize what it's like to drink this beer? As I was walking back to my car, I was thinking to myself ``If I die on the way home tonight, I will take solace in the fact that this was the last beer I ever drank.''"
""
""
""
"Pours thick and black like motor oil with a creamy tan head that sticks around for a while before attaching to my -stache. Smells of coffee and chocolate mostly with bits of earthy hops in there that try in vain to balance the sweetness on this bad boy. The maple aroma is very subtle but there. I pick up little to no barrel aromas. Taste is sweet with tons of coffee chocolate and caramel malts with again faint maple and some earthy spicy hops trying to cut through the sweetness. Thick body with a sweet creamy silky smooth mouthfeel and a light level of carbonation. This is a great beer, but the maple seems very subtle. I remember having this a couple of years ago and thinking it was over mapled. If it didn't cost my first born and require swapping spit with the beer store guy I'd add a few of these to my basement."
""
""
""
""
""
"And here's the kicker: the last few times I drank CBS, I kept wishing it were Breakfast Stout instead. If nothing else, CBS helped me appreciate how stellar FBS is. But obviously, YMMV. Cheers!"
""
""
"Been sitting on this bottle for a bit, thought today would be the day that I experience this beer. The appearance is black as night, motor oil comes to mind, tan mocha colored head that fades away quickly. The smell is BIG on coffee and oak, hints of bourbon and chocolate, don't get too much maple that I expected. Tastes just like it smells, but with a bit more of the oak and bourbon characters. This is a big beer for sure. Very similar to KBS in my opinion. There is a slight hint of the maple sweetness at the end of the taste, the alcohol is very well hidden (drank this bottle to myself.) Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, just as expected. Perfect carbonation for the beer. Overall, I wish I had this on tap first, so I could have done a comparison of the two. Either way, this is a HUGE beer and if you're able to land a bottle, crack it open and enjoy. It's definitely a beer worth trying, currently crossing this off my bucket list."
""
""
"O. Having this beer on a clean palate has given me a better understanding of it and I must say I am impressed. It is massive in both flavor and mouthfeel. That said, a small amount (5 or 6 ounces) is plenty for me in one sitting. Is it worth the $15 I paid for it? Yup, but I really have no need to revisit this beer anytime soon. Glad to have tried it but now please, pass me a FBS or FIS."
""
"Delicious, delicious, delicious. I'm a grown ass man dawg. I ain't about to call another dude Delicious! Personally I think KBS is better but this is still delightful. Maple flavor is right on and not too sweet at all. Definitely in the top 10, maybe top 5 that I've ever had. If you like beer at all, you'll probably like this. Good luck finding it."
""
""
"I also had the 2010 vintage on-tap at the same time. It was good but lost a lot of the maple syrup flavors I thought made the 2011 standout. A wonderful beer made incredibly well, believe the numbers this one is killer."
"O-a rich and complex Imperial stout that is every bit as good as billed. Can't wait to try it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"An unreal drink. So powerful and sweet. What is amazing about this beer is that all of the decadently sweet, desserty flavors are never cloying, tiring, overdone, obvious, misrepresented, or off, in any way. This is, very seriously, a treat. All of these ridiculous sweet-tooth flavors are gently wrapped up and showcased in a seriously manly brew. All I can say is that I should have bought the other bottle when I had the chance. CBS is big-time awesome! Score one and savor the flavor!"
"Overall: Very well done brew. I was expecting more maple syrup in the taste. I didn't get any maple from the aroma. Did this with a side by side with KBS and FBS. All 3 are fantastic brews and are always wanted. Cheers."
""
""
"Overall: Amazing stout. Almost perfect. Breakfast of champions. Canadian Bacon Stout. It's just ridiculously good."
""
""
"OVERALL: This beer is definitely worth the price of admission, as are all of Founder’s imperial stout brews. Whether this one is better than KBS is a matter of personal taste, as both brews are complete works of art. This one is definitely a masterpiece, with a menacing pour, a big, complex nose and a taste profile to write home about. The maple syrup was done unbelievably well, meshing seamlessly with the bourbon barrel and the base beer. Very glad to have had the chance at this one and would absolutely love to drink it again. Thanks again to everyone who made this Founders lineup possible. This was outstanding!"

"O - Did I say Wow yet? Wow. This is a fantastic brew! An array of sweet malt flavors combine with toasty coffee and maple syrup, and then takes a bourbony turn in the finish. Vanilla throughout, a little heat, and I am in heaven. Its almost like choicolate milk with a kick... But it's so much more! I would definitely seek this out again! I would recommend drinking this soon, only because I feel that everything is in perfect balance at this very moment,"
""
""
"O- Easy to see why this is rated so highly. Going into this I almost thought that all the flavors would clash (chocolate, coffee, maple syrup, bourbon)...seems like it would be easy for this to taste muddled. Thankfully that was not the case. Founders made a truly special brew."
"O- an awesome and complex beer that lives up to the hype. I don't think it is as good as regular FBS but still a winner in my book."

"O: A very good Imperial Stout, though I suspect the maple has already started to fall off somewhat."
"Thick and syrupy and rich on the palate. Slightly bitter roasty notes throughout, but big and sweet at the same time. Dark milk chocolate, coffee, mildly fruity syrup, alcohol in the background lingers. Finishes off-dry, with an earthy-leafy hop note. A decent beer."

"Overall: I had the chance to try some of this on tap at EBF and it blew my mind to the point where I tried it several more times.

With that said, this is still a fantastic beer, but given the insane hype and hell it created, I'll stick to KBS unless one of these falls in my lap."

"O) This is one of the best beers I've had in recent memory. It satisfies all of the senses involved in beer consumption. As far as I'm concerned, this will be my personal gold standard for any barrel aged stouts moving forward."
"Very dark, with a 1 finger mocha head. Lots of chocolate and coffee in the aroma, didn't pick up much maple. Tastes rich and sweet and delicious. Coffee is the primary flavor when cold, but as it warms it reveals chocolate, caramel, whiskey, and maple. Really easy drinking. It's sweet but not syrupy or heavy, and the taste lingers forever. Very happy to have gotten to try a bottle of this."

"O - OMG! Best beer I've had... Period."
"A great beer that lives up to the hype. I wanted more and more. It's sweet, dark, roasted, hopped and everything else it can be. Top class!"
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good. The aroma offsets the taste. I'd like to try this on tap--and I wouldn't mind trying it again--but I'd rather have KBS or BORIS."
""
""
"Overall: Very tasty. The chocolate is very prevalent. The maple and coffee come through as it warms."
""
"O-a wonderful beer that lives up to the hype. Unique and well made. Great beer from probably the best brewery in the world right now. Lucky to have had this one."
"O - Wasn't sure I would like this more than KBS but I think I do. Glad to score a bottle of this, and the Candian version is perfect for those who like a big stout without a burn or overly roasted finish."

"I found this CBS not as good as the KBS, i loved the KBS with all my heart and the CBS lost it on the taste..."

"CHEERS"
"Legendary for a reason, I believe it lives up to the hype."
"Smell was wonderful, slowly filling the room. The taste was boozy on the front and smooth as silk on the back. I am thankful I got to get ahold of this phenomenal beer, by far the best Imperial Stout I have had to date."
"I haven't been this impressed with a beer in a long time. It has elements of everything in the beer but the flavor is greater than the sum of its parts as everything is balanced almost perfectly. Utterly complex and drinkable at once...the stuff beer dreams are made of."
"O: A little surprised. For as hard as this beer was to get a hold of and as much as it was hyped, it did not meet expectations. This beer was great, but I think I would rather have a KBS. That said, the flavors were great, but the maple additions were a little hard to pick up. I am very interested to see how this beer ages."
"Holy grail, Shmoly shmail. This swill ain't all its said to be. If you boozehounds like booze, you might like this junk. Its got plenty of maple's sirrup and barrel stink and you soak up that stuff with a bit a high caffeine joe with some pancakes and boy-bin in the side car. The biggest gripe I's got with this paint thinna is that its too damn boozy. You got betta options out there, so get 'em."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I need more of this. Holy crap. I can't thank Marc enough for this bottle. Worth the hype and I'd say worth trading through the nose for in the future."
""
""
""
"On the whole, my first experience with the legendary beer that is CBS was an amazing one. It definitely lives up to all the hype surrounding it and that is an increasingly rare feat in the world of craft today. Many, many profuse thanks to Founders Brewing for bottling this gem and allowing so many more of us enthusiasts the opportunity to sample this."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer lives up to everything I had heard. Count myself very lucky to score a bottle here in Colorado."
""
""
"This is a special release beer that is truly worth the anticipation."
""
"O: Very complex, sweet, smooth and easy drinking. I was a little disappointed at how light the bourbon, vanilla and oak came through compared to KBS. The sweet maple syrup on the other hand replaces it nicely."
""
"O: This was well worth stalking three beer stores near me for nearly a month to get my hands on. Wonderful flavors that was remarkably smooth. I was very impressed with the little twist that the Maple gives it over the KBS. Well done Founders!"
"Overall- Not really good at all. Not interesting and too ashy for my taste. Very one sided. Drain pour. 2/5"
""
""
""
"Overall, this is rounded and sweeter variation to the ever stable KBS, with maple sweetness that shares the stage with coffee and bourbon. Complex, yet simple and bold and yet it greatly succeeds. However, I am torn on this beer. I really love the flavor profile but it lacks the depth and complexity I was hoping for. Is it really good, heck yes, is it mindblowingly delicious and complex to make it one of the top beers on the planet, I have my doubts there. Definitely recommended and worth a go, but don't go too overboard to acquire."
""
"Cost: $7.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle."
"Pours deep black and with a tan finger head that leaves some lacing. Aromas of coffee and then some maple, vanilla, spice and malt in the backround. Tastes much of the same but more intense than the smell. The maple shows up at the back end of the sip and then the taste of coffee lingers. Palate is as smooth as the other Founders Stouts which is great! Overall it's a great beer that may be a bit hurt by all the hype it's been given."
"Update 07/29/2012 : lucky enough to have 2 more bottles saved. Much debate that this should not be aged. One legitimate point is that the maple will fade. Yes, but it's still in the profile, and man is this freak smooth. Drinkin like a milkshake. Awesome."
""
""
""
"this beer pours a dark brown to almost black color with a fairly small mocha colored head. the smell is slightly oaky with a very small hint of maple and bourbon. there was really a lot less bourbon and maple than i was expecting. the flavor is very smooth lightly roasty a little sweet with hints of maple booubon and oak. the mouthfeel is smooth and lightly carbed. overall this is a good beer, i just don't think it quite lives up to the hype that was surrounding it. My friends and I enjoyed it, and I was glad to have a chance to try it."
""
"Easily in my top five of best beers I've ever tasted. Just an outstanding beer that lives up to every once of hype."
"Overall, this is just too sweet and becomes cloying deeper into the bottle. My first experience with this beer was bitter disappointment: from a plastic cup out of questionable tap lines. My second was after running a marathon and turd soup may have hit the spot. I enjoyed it much more then. Tonight, this is a very solid stout but I'm not sure it's near as good as KBS if you're even making comparisons from the same brewery. Not quite the world class stout that many pimp it as, but worth the opportunity to try."
"Epic beer! This is truly a masterpiece - a real luxury. The perfect stout in my estimation. This is the gold standard by which all imperial stouts should be judged."
""
""

"D: This beer lived up to the hype. It didn't have any noticeable maple flavor, which was surprising, but the scent and taste were still super complex and exceptionally delicious. Reminiscent of Huna, actually. Very balanced with little noticeable alcohol, so super easy to drink but worth sipping. The body was weak, but this is otherwise a top beer. Not sure how it would age, fresh was a delight. Highly recommended."
""
"O - A superb RIS. I will marry anyone who will give me a crate!"
""
"O - CBS lives up to the hype. It may very well be the best beer I've ever had. I didn't think FBS could be improved upon, but the maple and bourbon do it. If you can find this, get it. It would get a 6/5 in my book."

"O. Ok. Is this the best stout in the world? If its not it is definitely in the heavyweight title fight. This takes everything that KBS is which is already a phenomenal beer and makes it a touch better. Maple, vanilla, coffee, molasses, and chocolate.... I mean come on how does it get better than that. So this year has been a big one for me in terms of the big daddy stouts. Had Vanilla BCBS to celebrate Moriah's birth. The Abyss for my birthday. And CBS on Xmas. Here is hoping 2012 is just as good."

"Overall: This beer is perfect. The richness is great and the bourbon so well integrated. I love KBS but this is a step up. Really truly great. Very sweet but I love it. Fantastic :) Thanks Adam (splax23)."
"A very well done stout in the big picture of stouts, though for one of very few in which maple syrup is incorporated in some way I was expecting a bit more of an emphasis on the maple."

"this was delicious up and down, easy to drink, never got boring. only flaw was a bit too sweet."

""
"O: I love KBS and maple so I thought this would be the best of both worlds. It's a damn good beer, but I think I prefer KBS and I'm not a big coffee guy."
""
""
"The bottled version seemed a bit more complex to me than the draft version did, and I'm wondering if this beer wouldn't benefit from a bit of short term aging. This is a fine beer, no doubt, but it really didn't show as well as I was expecting during the tasting at finewinemike's."

"O: This is what I expected KBS to taste like when I first had it. It's amazing how different barrels can make a beer 10x better than it's counter part. The coffee, maple, and barrel notes really play well together and make a great beer. I didn't want to believe the hype but now I'm glad I traded for this one. Definitey in my top 5 beers of all time if not my top 3. Thanks to Brian for the trade and opportunity to try this long time want!"

"O- this is a great stout and if you're lucky enough to find it in on the shelf you should buy it for several reasons. However, overall I have to say I feel it has been over-hyped. To me, this tastes like an aged FBS with a higher ABV. It had much more coffee flavor and much more bite than I was expecting. Maybe a beer rated this high can't live up to the expectations, but I wasn't blown away and I expected to be. KBS is better."

"750 ml bottle courtesy of myspoonistoobig. Thanks Michael. Pours a very dark brown close to black with a small darkish tan head that has good retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The is big coffee, some dark chocolate, some vanilla and a bit of bourbon, oak, and some light alcohol. Quite awesome. The initial taste is sweet with dark chocolate, then comes a lot of coffee. A decent amount of oak as well as a bit of vanilla and some bourbon. The maple is there as well, but not overpowering. The finish has a decent coffee bitterness. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Great beer. A substantial improvement over KBS. The coffee is quite strong, and the maple sweetness is not overpowering, which I was slightly worried about."
""
""
""
"I had this at an EBF a few years ago, and it blew my mind into pieces. Perhaps my tastes have changed, but I think there is a lot less maple and a lot more wood in this bottled iteration. It could use some more balance. Honestly, it's a little better than KBS, but if I had to pick... I would pick Founders Breakfast Stout. And I wouldn't have to kill anyone to get it!"
"Overall: The final verdict? I was incredibly excited (and fortunate) to get to try two highly-sought after stouts this year: Darklord 2011 (thanks Alewatcher!) and CBS. After hawking three stores in town, I got 3 bottles: one for my wife and I, and one each for my father and father-in-law for Christmas. The grand total? About $50. And a whole lot of time. So, the question is, was it worth it? While I was horribly disappointed by Dark Lord (hey, that just means I don't have to drive to IN this spring or...well...ever) this is honestly quite good. Nice sweetness, fairly restrained booze, wonderful aromas, and interesting profile overall. Was it enjoyable? Abso-floggin-lutely. Is it an A+ beer in my mind? No. The flavors, while awesome, don't show the incredible depth/definition of the very best. Would we buy it again for $16.00? Well, that depends. If it was a fairly readily-available yearly release, we'd probably pick up a bottle every year or so. Would I go to the ends of the earth for one or trade my cellar away for it? Probably not. None of this ought to take away from this beer. Founders did a great job, but when a beer is hyped as much as this one is, it's almost impossible to live up to the hype."

"Overall; imo, there are two ways that stellar imperial stouts can go. Layered and complex, or solid & well balanced. This is one of those solid well balanced ones and I loved it!"

""

""
""
""
""
"In the end this beer just didn't live up to the hype. I would have expected to be savoring every last drop, but it wasn't that amazing. It's a nice stout overall, but the lingering sweetness was a bit too much. I can see why alot of folks would rate it higher, but for me it needs more complexity and balance to make it top notch."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Founders CBS is arguably the most complex imperial stout I've ever had.. and certainly worth the hype. I can't wait for the third release in the backstage series."
"O- Was a little let down by this bottle, I had it a couple months ago for the first time and remember it being better and more roasty. This bottle was really rich and sweet, the maple syrup notes took over. Still an excellent beer, prefer KBS in the long run."

"Severed in a snifter it pours a nice dark mocha colored head that linger that leaves great lacing, near the edges it isn't exactly a very dark color its almost a dark reddish brown. I smell a good coffee flavor, boozy smell that I would contribute to the bourbon barrel, and very disappointingly a very faint maple. The coffee flavor is good not great, and the bourbon flavor is good but the maple flavor is very muted almost like the coffee over powers the maple flavor. The mouth feel is good its slick and slightly oily. I had this beer a year ago at the brewery and it was the most fantastic beer I ever had, this isnt that beer. I don't know if they changed the recipe or something but I was very let down by this in a bottle. Dont get me wrong this is a solid beer but I can think of several other stouts that I would much rather have."
"Canadian Breakfast Stout pours pitch black. The foam, which is past caramel and halfway to milk chocolate in color, billows up to about four fingers in height. The lacing left around the glass is gorgeous, sheetlike for the most part. Head retention is very good, but just a bit short of perfection. Coffee is the first thing that that jumps out about the nose (which is heavenly), although rich milk chocolate and maple aromas are also present. Everything is so well integrated that it takes a while to pull apart all the different components. The flavor, and I wasn't sure it was possible, is even better. Creamy milk chocolate and a splash of maple syrup swirl together at the front end of each sip. A mild bourbon note that gives a slight warming sensation fills the mid palate, before a strong coffee flavor comes in to close things out. The carbonation is spot on, nice and low. Meanwhile, the body, while being both silky and creamy, could stand to be a bit more full/sturdy. Any qualms I have with Canadian Breakfast Stout are minor, as this is truly one of the top few stouts being brewed in this country. I got up at an obscenely early hour to hunt down bottles of this, and I'd do it all again without hesitation."
""
"Very well might be the best beer I've ever tasted."
""
"Pours pitch black with a slight coffee colored head. Really deep and dark looking. Smells incredible. Huge fresh roasted coffee beans and well complementing vanilla and chocolate notes. Flavor begins with the huge, tasty coffee notes. So fresh and pure. Awesome touches of vanilla and chocolate give it a silky smooth middle before the finish that is off the charts. Great maple syrup flavor blends with the flavors and gives this one the best finish in a beer I have ever tried. The flavors are perfectly crafted, nothing gimmicky, just pure great flavors throughout. I didn't think CBS could live up to the hype, but I could drink this beer all day everyday."

"One damn complex beer in all the right ways!!"
"O- a tasty big double stout worth the hype ,what struck me the most was how creamy drinkable it was so smooth and tasty"
"O - i tried as hard as i could to make this last! so good, you'll find yourself drinking it too quickly. Not sure if it's worth the grey-market price of $100 - but for $50 or under it's certainly worth it. Special stout that is a full-fledged dessert. To this day, I have not had a beer that has as pronounced a finish as this one. You will taste the beer long after you swallow. If you do get your hands on a bottle, do yourself a favor and only share with one other person."

"CBS is a very good beer, deserving of many of the accolades it has received. This is a big beer but manages to remain rather drinkable. The heat and booziness never become too abrasive. With everything that is right about this beer, it is a bit too sweet for my liking. Despite my personal opinion this is a beer you should try if you are ever presented the opportunity."

It is just an all around world class beer. I highly recommend trying this one out. I would definitely pick more of it up, and I would love to try it on-tap.

"O: Good lord. All aboard the hype-train - this beer is the real deal. Easy the best, most complex stout I've ever had. World class for sure."
""
""
"Stand alone an amazing beer. Great mouthfeel. Had a much higher sugary/sweetness content compared to KBS and a much shorter finish. May be attributed to the 8 months more age on the KBS. I hate to say it, but I honestly would choose to drink KBS over this CBS, although I covet both of them more then any other beer. I am lucky enough to have two more bottles of CBS that I can lay down for some time and do this again."
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a dense 3 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a small cap. A nice latticework of lace sticks to the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, coffee grounds, cocoa powder, dark chocolate, and maple syrup. Taste is of dark roasted malt, maple syrup, coffee beans, dark chocolate syrup, and a bit of alcohol. There is a nice roasty/cocoa bitterness on the finish that lingers on the tongue and a slight alcohol burn in the back of the throat. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is an exceptional beer that completely lives up to its hype. Hands down, one of tne of the best stouts I have ever had."

"O: I think this is my first commercial stout brewed with maple syrup and am pleasantly surprised. Tasted great - the maple syrup wasn't overwhelming in it's contribution to the sweetness and the chocolate/bourbon/coffee were well represented also. My only complaint would be no noticeable bourbon character or oakiness, although I may have already been sufficiently intoxicated by the time this was pouring :)"

"Pours a very dark color, blackish mahogony. Head is frothy, very mousse like, dark tan-brown color. Head is very creamy, aromas of maple and coffee creep up out of the glass nestled in cocoa and a bourbon heat. Flavor is spot on, although this beer doesnt really shine until it has warmed up completely to room temp, I would't even refridgerate this badboy. The maple is slightly subdued and the coffee roast and chocolate take the forefront. Finishes with a slight bourbon bite, but it is mellowed with the slight sweetness of the maple that just barely pokes it's head out. Overall, this is a sexy beer. I think that a lot of this b.s. about maple fading will be proven wrong with this beer. I predict the coffee mellowing first and allowing the maple and chocolate sweetness to shine. Only time will tell."

"Overall: This one fits the bill and delivered on the hype. I was a little unsure how it would all come together without clashing, but it is a marvel in that it tastes great, but is extremely nuanced and evolves with each taste."
"O: Well, this beer is really really good. The maple tones are subdued with initial tastes, and then initiate their subtle bellicose intents to compel my idle hands to guzzle. Good shit, I expected it to be sweeter, and was pleasantly surprised. I am grateful to have been able to try this one. I would love to have again, and wouldn't pass up an opportunity. A perfect dessert for this accompaniment would be a hot fudge sundae with peanut brittle bits mixed into a rich, high quality vanilla bean ice cream...After which I would probably be sick to my stomach from such a degree of extravagance."
"An oily thick viscous black pour glugs out of the bottle and into my snifter. A healthy brown head appears and then turns into a nice halo on my glass. Aroma is immediately of maple and chocolate. Taste is of sweet maple, brownie batter and some oaky-vanilla.As it warms the coffee flavor shines through. What I like is it doesn't taste like the burnt coffee flavor I got from the FBS. For as thick and syrupy these flavors sound this beer has such a nice light drinkability... even though its flavors coat the mouth and linger quite long. This beer is amazing but the availability of it drives me crazy. I wish I could get it a little easier... but that might take away from the experience. Overall this is a perfect stout and I would change nothing about it. (except its availability)."
"Divine."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall this a really good beer. Coffee, some bourbon, some maple. Pretty good. Not better than BT or VB DL, but still very good."
"WAAAY too hot on the back end. (and bear in mind, I like big stouts. I'm not some BMC guy on his 4th review)."
"Finally....I got my hands on one of these bad boys and I didn't even have to pay 50+ bucks for it on e-bay! Pretty good overall. Poured like motor oil with little head and lacing. Good nose to this one, I picked up more on the chocolate rather than the coffee, maple syrup, or bourbon. Big heavy SWEET beer. This thing was a dessert beer for sure...It tasted like a shot of hershey's chocolate syrup. Alcohol was hidden very well, considering the 10.6% EtOH content. Overall it was a good beer BUT I'm not big on big sweet syrup beers so...I am glad that I can say that I've tried it, but not my fav. Cheers!"
"O: A truly decadent and rich sipper of a beer. There are few imperial stouts that I would put above this one (although there are one or two). This beer is definitely worth the hype. Thank you so much for the bottle, Jay."
"Overall: I did not expect that this beer would live up to its reputation. It is the best stout of any kind that I have ever had; period (blew KBS & FBS away with ease). I don’t know if I’ll ever get the chance to have it again but I’m glad I was lucky enough to get this opportunity."
"Aging is not recommended."
"So glad i got to try this. Aasher made sure i didn't miss out on buying this, and it did not fail in the least bit."
"o - certainly a great beer, but i don't understand the hysteria. i would definitely not pay more than $30 for a bottle of this, and that's pushing it. i did a side by side with kbs at founders black party last year and found the differences to be minimal (cbs being just a tad sweeter)."
"Overall: Amazing beer and really grateful that I got to try it. I would rather have a 4 pack of KBS but as a treat I would certainly enjoy a CBS."
"Worth the hype? Yeah, it was pretty much worth having to lean up against something in the bar because all the seats were occupied. Makes me really upset that I missed the KBS tapping now."
"O - Incredibly rich, sweet, and decadent. It absolutely lives up to the hype. This is one of those rare ""Wow"" beer. When you take the first sip you can't help but blurt out""Wow!""."
"I don't think that I fawned too much over this beer. This Wale lived up to its billing. I hope that I can someday get another glass someday."
"Pour is Dark and thick. At first sniff, Coffee and espresso come out first, followed by vanilla and maple. A few swills and she comes to life. Small to medium caramel colored head and huge coffee notes. Lacing is thick and sticky. Wow, this beer taste amazing. Coffee followed by chocolate, vanilla and maple. Big balance of the hops and malt. You can tell that there is A LOT going on in this brew. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy. Not as heavy as I expected but extremely balanced. The alcohol is hidden as the coffee and roasted malt pack a huge punch. Finish is smooth and long. I really enjoyed this brew, although I don't understand all the craziness and drama surrounding it. It's just A BEER. Meant for sharing and drinking. If you get a chance please try one of these with some close friends! Cheers!"
"Overall: I am happy I got a chance to try this limited release, but I don't know if all the hype is as good as it is made out to be. Bottles were near impossible to get around me and the keg tapped out in 9 minutes where I had it. No doubt this is a great brew but I can not say it is out of this world compared to more readily available barrel aged stout. Good Job Founders just dial in the distribution better in my opinion, maybe 12oz bottle will go a lot farther."
"O: This is one I have been wanting to try for a long time. Once the announcement of bottling came out I got really excited...then I saw the fiasco behind the release and had kind of given up on try this one. Really glad I've now lined up a bottle for myself."
"Overall: After seeing once presumed good, honorable men turn into dire savage beasts over this greatly hyped beer release (in the same manner the Rings of Power created the Nazgûl), I was half expecting it to fall a bit flat, but, no, it's really quite wonderful."
"Managed to get one of twelve bottles at Abe's on the day of it's release. The beer poured out as a very dark black color, nice and thick oily looking body with a brown colored head on top. The head lasts for a little bit and fades in time. The smell of the beer is sweet and lightly roasted with some maple, chocolate and coffee aromas. The first sip is sensational, I couldn't believe how great this tasted. The blend of maple and coffee was fantastic. Such an interesting flavor it's hard to explain. The mouthfeel of this brew is creamy, thick and rich. Overall this beer is great. There isn't many other ways to explain how good this is. Makes me wish I could have gotten more. So glad that I got to try this beer finally."
"Overall, I wasn't sure what to expect with the maple-bourbon barrel aging. This is a very heavy and thick beer with alot of sweetness. The combination of the maple and bourbon flavors seems to turn into a sort of caramel flavor. All the flavors you expect from Breakfast stout come through with the addition of the bourbon and maple syrup flavors. This is an exceptional beer, not only very interesting but very well done for the style. Incredibly smooth with lots of different flavors. I was very fortunate to get my hands on this one."
"Overall an amazing stout with subtle complexity. "
"I was lucky enough to get two bottles of this, and wow, did I enjoy them both. Really rich aroma with a hint of sweetness which completely translates into the taste. You can take multiple sips and each time get different hints of chocolate, coffee, maple or bourbon, depending on what you focus on. Simply an achievement of a beer."
"Overall – What to think…I felt this was just too sweet. It is a solid imperial stout, no question. However, it just didn’t really do much for me to be perfectly honest. Obviously this is quite subjective and everyone’s experience will vary, though I just couldn’t get past the sweetness. I like a bit more char/roasted character throughout. To be honest, I would take KBS or FBS over this if I were enjoying a stout. However, if I were to share this as an after dinner beer I would choose this over the aforementioned beers. I suppose it boils down to my not liking overly sweet stouts. Would still love to try it again and as stated, for what it is, it is fantastic. Glad I was able to try a couple glasses on tap."
"O- Obviously almost perfect."
"I couldn't think of a better beer for 250th review."
"I was hoping for some more maple presence but it's an excellent beer nonetheless. I'm glad it has lived up to the hype (unlike some other beers like Westy 12). I wish this was more readily available. I'm looking forward to next years version of CBS."
"Try it if you can but don't kill yourself for it."
"O: I had this beer yesterday, and I think this is the only beer I can’t get out of my mind, at least to this extent. It lives up to all the hype it gets and it is truly a special thing. Hands down my favorite stout and easily top 5 beers of all time. It might be a long while till I have this beer again, exclusively because of the price and availability of it. I was lucky enough to enjoy it on tap at a bar 2 blocks from where I live, many people search and search for this beer. The price is to say the least very high I’m unsure about how much people are paying for a pint of it (I think its quite high), but at Crunchy’s it was $8 for 6oz, and only one per customer. Anyways I would recommend this beer to anyone who enjoys trying good beer (this is just not a beer I would start someone unfamiliar with good beer out on, I feel they would feel disappointed about paying so much). I wish I had the money and resources to find and have this beer multiple time every winter, I keep picturing myself sipping a sniffer of this while seating in a leather recliner chair beside a toasty fire watching the wintering weather outside."
"O - This is a great beer. My first few sips were not great if I'm being honest. It wasn't until about 6 ounces in that I began to really like this beer. I don't think it would fare that well at a blind tasting. Unique as well with the maple/bourbon barrel. It could also benefit from a better aroma. Would I seek this one out again? Yes. Would I recommend it? Yes. Would I go to a special release for it? Most likely. Would I follow distribution trucks/vans around Indiana to buy it from every store? No, those people are idiots."
"KBS is one of my top 5 beers ever probably, so I'm not sure if this is quite that sublime, but it's close. Fantastic stuff."
"O- A pretty sweet stout with the maple syrup being noticeable. There is an odd bitterness (from the hops?) that lingers on in the aftertaste that hurts the drinkability overall. I'm very glad I had to chance to try this, but I prefer KBS."
"O - This is creamy, smooth, complex, but not overwhelming. It's like your best buddy beer - being everything you want it to be and more. Having a sad day? No problem, sip on a glass of CBS and watch your worries melt away. This is chocolatey, coffee, maple syrup, burbon aged perfection."
"poured into a tulip. beer pours a dark brown head with decent lacing down the glass. The smell is one of maple and a touch of bourbon. The taste is fairly sweet and taste reminds me of pancakes with syrup on them. there is chocolate and maple as well as some tannins from the oak. A beer everyone should try have a chance to try as it is very tasty."
"Pours a dark brown with a thin tan head - lots of lacing. The smell is very sweet, with note of coffee and chocolate and just a faint twinge of bourbon. The taste is (as a friend described it) ""milkshake beer:"" super sweet, though with some nice roasted notes from the coffee; chocolate flavors predominate, with a hint of maple; not much from the bourbon here. It's thick and creamy, with mild carbonation. All in all a nice beer, easy enough to drink for what it is. Glad to have had a chance to try it with friends."
"[Edit #2] Tons of bottle variation in this. Score is more or less an average, but the bottles I've got to try have ranged from around a 3.5 to a 5."
"Overall: The rare beer that truly lives up to the hype. It's nearly perfect - the lack of maple in the nose is the only thing holding me back from perfect 5's across the board. All of that said, it's only a baby step ahead of KBS. Given the difficulty of acquisition, I'm happy to have tried a bottle but I will be sticking with regular KBS in the future unless more CBS falls into my lap."
"Reviewed from notes, poured into Orval goblet. Pours black with brown edges, no head, small bubbles are the only evidence of carbonation. Smells like coffee and burnt sugar, syrup, light bourbon. Taste is great, much better than I remember it being on draft. Sweet, balanced coffee bitterness, thick sugary syrup flavor, a hint of bourbon and oak, bitter chocolate, finishes sweet. Body is a bit lighter then I would like but still thick, light carbonation. A very good beer overall."
"Thanks again Kevin for the chance and Kyle for the chance of sharing this guy with some age!"
"O: A fantastic beer with many flavors and layers that somehow work and blend perfectly. One sip it's chocolatey, the next it's coffee-forward, the next the bourbon and maple shine through. Absolutely delicious."
"(D)- I absolutely loved this on tap all those times I had the pleasure of trying it, but having it this fresh out of the bottle just further reminded and confirmed to me, this is simply one of the best stouts on planet earth. Sweet, malty, and a velvet-like creamy smoothness. Simply put, no other stout tastes like this one does."
"Drink- Again going back to back with Topper I was a bit spoiled by Kzoobrew. I cant thank him enough for these two beers but my return box will surely try. I might need to trade for another bottle of this because even worth the premium people have on this bottle it will be well worth it."
"Dark, inky coffee grounds color with a creamy and lumpy head of dark cocoa foam that leaves sheets of lace on the glass. The aroma is amazing, fresh ground coffee, black strap molasses and malted milk with a very mild oakiness. I rarely find a beer that lives up to it's massive hype but CBS does. The flavors are simple and delicious, rich cocoa and maple syrup with dark roasty coffee and mild woodiness from the barrel, the bourbon is in the background and fits perfectly. Full bodied and velvety smooth with a smooth, fine carbonation. World class beer from a truly great brewery."
"D: This hits on all marks. Love how all the flavors come together and create a remarkable beer. Worthy of it's praise (trade value is another story though)"
"Overall very enjoyable and very satisfying. Extremely happy we got so many and were able to share with everyone we could. Definitely worth the time and effort."
"O. Excellent desert beer. I believe this comes off as a little too much chocolate and sweetness in comparison to kbs."
"Seek it out and find out for yourself."
"Black pour with a nice brown head. Retention is lacking a bit. The smell is so balanced. Bourbon, sweetness from the maple, roasty and chocolate. The taste follows the smell perfectly. It's just so damn balanced. Bourbon, maple, chocolate, coffee, roastiness. The taste is deep, balanced, delicious. Very heavy body, carbonated well, warming alcohol and dry finish. I love this beer. Delicious."
"D - It's not quite there. KBS has better balance and complexity across its flavor spectrum. I think the sweetness needs to be cut a tad and underlying characters need to be enhanced. Ideally age will do this. Still worth a try, but seriously not worth the effort required to get it right at bottle release."
"I've had this beer on tap twice in the past and I'd say this bottle was my least favorite of the three samplings but still wonderful none the less. The flavors were tame by comparison to the last two samplings. The first draft sampling was more roasty than this one and very restrained in maple syrup profile like this bottle. The second draft sampling had a similar roast profile but a much more vibrant maple syrup profile than this bottle."
"Thick dark pour with thin tan head. Aromas of maple, bourbon and milk chocolate abound. The taste follows suite, adding a bit of cold coffee to the mix. And then a charcoal, burnt woodiness that I find very off putting, and was arguably not in the first bottle I had. This astringent like flavor kinda ruins this for me. Beer has great mouthfeel, coating the palate with creaminess and a little heat from the booze."
"O - A very layered and delicious beer, one that lives up to the hype."
"O= Is this an amazing beer? Yes it is. Is it mind blowing and tasty. Yes it is. It is still another amazing imperial stout among a sea of them however. I dunno if they hype lives up to the beer but the beer is amazing. I think this one was just a little too crazy for me. The beer itself should not be deducted for what people have made of it however and it is one hell of a beer."
"Thick mouthfeel, but surprisingly drinkable with all the flavor and the abv. I get very little alcohol. Another superb stout from the kingdom of excellent stouts - Founders."
"This is a very complex beer that should be enjoyed slowly as it comes up in temperature. Starts off with a rich chocolate/vanilla taste as undertones of bourbon and maple syrup come through and finish more pronounced. Coffee flavor is present throughout. This brew becomes more balanced in taste as it warms. It is thick, but not in a bad way. Overall, I very much enjoyed this beer and I hope to have another chance at trying it again soon...hopefully on tap."
"O: Amazing stout. My previous all-time favorite was KBS and this somehow topped it. I'd rate this all 6s if I could, nothing outside of KBS even comes close. Absolutely decadent and delicious on all levels. A must try for any beer lover."
"Oh my goodness. I’ve never experienced this level of anticipation with a beer before...I was even shaking a bit when I was getting out the bottle, glass and opener (yeah I’m a geek). Thankfully it lives up to the hype. Another magnificent barrel-aged creation from those geniuses at Founders. Damn. Can they do no wrong? Seriously! This is a masterpiece! Kudos Founders!"
"Pours black with a nice cocoa head. Looks great. The smell is big coffee and chocolate with a slight maple sweetness. Smells fantastic. The taste is insane. Huge dark coffee tamed by a nice underlying maple sweetness. Those flavors mend amazingly with the mild bourbon. An occasional boozy flavor pops up, but then is quickly quashed by the maple coffee flavor. This is undoubtedly one of the best tasting beers I have ever had. Intense, but reasonable. The mouthfeel is big and velvety with a nice light carbonation. Overall, this is easily one of the best 10 beers I have ever had. Impressively drinkable and flavorful. Not sure how this beer will work when the coffee fades, or maybe the maple. To me, this is a drink now brew. Enjoy!"
"This beer is outstanding. I know I am not breaking any new ground there. What suprises me is the drinkability. While you do get the bourbon notes at the end, it is not overwhelming but complimentary. Hopefully this becomes more widely available in the future."
"mouthfeel - amazing body, so thick. and for that the carbonation is amazing. oily sticking in the mouth."
"Overall: Was it a great beer? Yes! Did it live up to all the hype? Well, it probably would have been impossible for a beer to live up to all the hype/buzz that's surrounded this one. Is a bottle worth $100? I don't think so. $75? Probably not. At the same time, I don't want to be one of those ""meh"" guys who doesn't give a great beer like this its due credit. If you can get your hands on it in a reasonable trade, or by paying $40 or less, though, I highly recommend it!!!"
"Plus, KBS is better."
"Overall: Damn near perfect!"
"On tap at Mike’s Bar and Grill during Cleveland Beer Week. Huge thanks to Founders for bringing some kegs of this this week. Just awesome. I have been searching for the perfect beer for years. I found it last night. The guy next to me said he had this last week in a bottle and tonight was his first time on tap. He said it was clearly better on tap. I have only had this once. On tap. Last night. So this review is based on what I enjoyed last evening. Pours pitch black with a slight tan ring around the edges. Looks like what I would expect. I put the glass up to my nose and whiff. Whoa. Layers of aromas. First I noticed a stickly sweet maple, then a touch of coffee, roast, and wood made a noticeable note here as well. I smelled this a few times because I was surprised by the complexity just in the aroma. I took a sip. My first thought was ""Holy Fuck"". An explosion of flavor hit me. Upfront their was a strong sense of coffee, followed very closely by a touch of maple sweetness, then a touch of dark roast from the grain bill and a slight note of vanilla with some booze notes that was not at all hot. The booze flavors were hid well by the way this was barrel aged and melded perfectly in the finished product. There really was no booze as there was just a note of it and it made for a perfectly rounded beer. The finish combined all of the above ever so slightly. There was no cloying sweetness. Nothing over the top. Everything in this beer was perfectly represented from start to finish. I honestly never thought I would give a perfect score to any beer. Until now. This one for me goes beyond the hype and was worth every sip."
"This isn't a normal Appearance,Smell ,Taste ,Mouthfeel,and Overall review. There is nothing I can say about this that hasn't been said. Believe the hype. This is the best beer I have ever had. Perfect. I know I am a MI/Founders homer, but this is for real and legit."
"O: Just a good, solid, delicious beer. The only breakfast stout that really tastes like breakfast."
"Taste is sweet, lots of maple candy, the chocolate and coffee is really subtle here. Oak and creamy dark malt is awesome. Very good, creamy and tasty."
"Overall: This is quite simply barrel-aging at its finest. Not sure if this or The Abyss is my favorite Imperial Stout - Abyss is more about the Stout backbone, while CBS is all about the barrels. A side-by-side would be fun, but very unlikely to ever happen."
"O: This was a very good beer. However, I feel regular KBS may be a bit more enjoyable for me. I think it might have benefited from a year in the cellar as the heat was a tad more than I like, and I do enjoy a hot beer. The hype train on this beer is a bit unjustified, it is very good but not worth the presidential ransoms some people are asking for it."
"other note - decided to sit on my bottle for at least a year, i was spoiled with 12oz (more like 18 from the pours) will report back once it is opened, once again probably my favorite beer to this point"
"O - Definitely not as fantastic as I remember it, and definitely not a top 3 stout.... The alcohol really started to show up after it passed 65F as well, which just seemed weird."
"Overall an amazing beer, one that's a candidate for perfection."
"Pours pitch black with a fairly big dark brown head. Smells of coffee and bourbon. Maple taste is huge upfront then relaxes and gives way to some mild coffee and vanilla like bourbon tones. Mouthfeel and carbonation are everything a great imperial stout should be. Overall amazing beer so worth getting up at 8am for."
"O - Overall this is an amazing beer that is so masterfully ochestrated. It needs more maple syrup though. Alot more. This is still a great stout, just, not up to par with the on tap verson."
"O: No doubt about it, this beer is superb; the maple tastes just add to the richness and complexity. I’m glad that I finally got to try it, so again, many thanks to Village Bottle Shoppe. There’s something special about a beer that’s this hyped, and luckily, it has the intensity to back it up. In all, it was one hell of an experience. You keep releasing beers like this, Founders, and Grand Rapids will no doubt become my second home."
"(M)"
"O - stunning beer. I love how mellow it is while still being complex. To mimic others it's well worth the hype and seems to remind me of a mellowed, sweeter KBS. so good."
"Overall- Something about the way the maple lingers doesn't do it for me. It's a really good beverage, but that lingering sweet maple is off-putting. I like a little stronger heat, bourbon, vanilla and I was not getting it. I'll take a Bourbon County any day of the week, but that's just me. Glad I got to have it this year, and glad I didn't have to run over an old lady to get some."
"Overall this was worth the 20$ price tag. Although I do prefer the kbs, its still highly recommended"
"O: I thought this beer pretty damn good. The sweetness is high, but not overpowering. All the flavors are spot on, and they really blend nicely. I'm really glad to have tried it, but I would choose 2 bottles of KBS over a CBS."
"D: This beer is VERY drinkable. It's warming and comforting. Wonderful beer."
"Overall, an amazing beer in balance, flavor, body and aroma. Abolutely delicious."
"this is an exceptional stout, definatly unique. love the coffee flavors, but maybe lacked a touch on the maple. i hate to say it considering the hype and all, but id prolly take a KBS over this. had this right after my very first kate the great and they were about even for me, even though my scores may say different..."
"Edit: After having both this and Wide Awake It's Morning, I'm sure the two are related. It makes me want to try the Maple Bacon Coffee Porter to see if it's in the middle."
"Very bold with plenty of outstanding flavors. The FBS, KBS, CBS line is just fantastic. I prefer the KBS to the CBS because the CBS is a bit too sweet and kind of overpowers the bourbon."
"Honestly, I'm not as impressed as I thought I would be. I mean, it's pretty good, but I just didn't get that ""wow"" I thought it would. It's still a solid brew though."
"Overall a very nice fun beer but the hype may have elevated this being crazy."
"Without a doubt, an excellent beer.  What was it worth the hype?I'm not so sure.  Anyway, I feel lucky enough to score a bottle , but a little ashamed at how much I paid.  All in all, trying different beer is a perfect metaphor of   life for me-  be in the moment, experience as much of it as you can, but try not to take it too seriously."
"Is it possible to be impressed and let down in a way at the same time? It was still extremely good, but the alcohol showing the way it did was bothersome. This probably needs a little bit of time to fully balance out"
"O: A beer like this deserves an addendum, an ""I'm with you in Rockland"" postscript. Each sip is so complex, so flavorful, that words can barely do it justice."
"Overall its really damn good. I'd place it behind KBS and FBS, but not by much. I get why there has been such hype even if I prefer the established greats better."
"O - There is no doubt that this is one of the best out there. The sweetness is strong but still manageable and even with the high ABV I could still drink a few of these no problem. I still plan to seek this one out on-tap at some point but this was a great introduction."
"Pours with a nice big head that dissipates to a nice coating. Here comes the maple. Drinking right next to kbs and regular and the maple is nice and noticeable. Big coffee mild bourbon and some nice sweetness. Flavor has a bit more of the maple with a smooth bourbon flavor with a little bit of heat. Maple, coffee, coco, mild sweetness. Holy crap this one kills it. Mouthfeel is not too syrupy not too thin, good mild carb, perfect. This is why I love founders. Great beer, great experience. Kudos to founders for bottling this beer that ive been chasing since I heard it existed."
"Nothing more needs to be said than has already been."
"Outstanding. Light years ahead of KBS, and worth the hype. *** A+"
"Overall: The difference between trying this fresh and trying a batch that is almost a year old is like night and day. The bourbon, molasses, and maple flavors are so much better defined, while the beer is full and viscous enough to make it drinkable. Truly a phenomenal beer. One day I will get to try a full carbonated fresh batch and it will probably be a near perfect score."
"O - ok so it's super good. Nothing deserves hype like this, but this lives up to it. A marvelously good beer"
"Side note - This paired well with a BLT."
"P. S. - Hey Dan, you jelly?"
"O - Outstanding beer, certainly worth the hype and steep price. Worthy of an A+. Will be hard to top this when it comes to Imperial Stouts."
"O- can't say enough amazing things about this beer. Being a huge fan of Founders and having tried almost everything they make (even the special brews) this is definitely the best beer I've had so far, and imagine it will always be one of the best. You owe it to yourself to get a few of these every fall! Can't wait until next year!"
"O Definitely an amazing beer, wish there was a little more lacing and more diverse aroma would be nice"
"Overall an amazing experience. I am incredibly happy I obtained these beers and decided to sure them with friends and family instead of asking for someone's kidney in return for the beer. We found the whale, stuck her with a harpoon, and got everything we could out of her (scrimshaw anyone?)."
"o - overall, this beer is NOT overated. it rightfully earned the respect it has. this one is no joke."
"Perhaps the best beer I've had in a very long time. Maybe since my last KBS? Maybe. Really good stuff. If you can find this beer, and that's a big IF, consume as much as you can. It's incredible."
"This is a very tasty stout with a fantastic mouthfeel. It's too bad there's so much hype surrounding this beer. I'd love it to be more readily available."
"O- Overall, this was one of the best beers I have ever had. It lived up to the hype. The flavors were so well-balanced; nothing dominated to any degree. I wish I had more, but I am glad I got one bottle (and even happier that I got to share it with my friends)."
"O: This is a really great beer, but just a bit sweeter than optimal for me. KBS and FIS both outrank this guy, but I am really glad to have had the chance to give it a run. It is very unique, and a lightly smoked ""bacon"" or ""Canadian bacon"" version would be a great permutation to try."
"(O) This was so good I didn't want to finish it. Just fantastically crafted and well made. I love KBS and FBS and this is the best of both worlds and then some more. It's delectable. Worth the hype."
"Of course this beer was over-hyped, but it is an awesome beer. Everything I'd want in an imperial stout. Beers are like Dark Lord are impressive with the amount of flavor, but this is still a balanced, complex, flavorful stout, that isn't too alcoholic or sweet."
"Overall: Viscous, vicious and voracious Canadian Breakfast Stout is simply wonderful. It's almost everything that a barrel-aged stout should be and more. Part of me wishes I could go above and beyond 5s on some these measures. Believe the hype, CBS is that good."
"O - Yep, this stuff is awesome. Lives up to the hype, although I didn't expect it to be as crazy as it is. Way tasty stuff and something that I really enjoyed. Glad I got another bottle hanging out to try again in the future. Believe the hype..."
"A phenomenal beer. One of my very favorates. Do not miss this one!"
"If you like big American imperial stouts you will love this beer."
"A truly excellent beer, but I have to say that I prefer KBS a bit more. KBS is less sweet, less bitter, with more bourbon, and it's more balanced with just as much flavor as CBS."
"CBS on tap (fresh) is exceptional. Much more maple present than in any of the bottles I have had. My recommendation-Don't seek out bottles, just wait until it shows up on tap."
"Criticism: My only criticism is that this one may be trying to do too much at the same time, and it may be too sweet for some barrel-aged elitists. Some will definitely find the KBS and the BS to be better than CBS because it (one) does not try to do as much ""flavor packing"" as CBS does and (two) the maple syrup adds sugar in a way that may perhaps prevent it from being a palate destroyer like KBS or a bit too overly rich juxtaposed to the BS. The maple syrup may perhaps be overkill for many. But CBS is an extreme beer. CBS in an extreme beer for those who enjoy extreme tastes. Is CBS the best beer in the world or even in the US? It might be. But, to absolutely make it the ""king of beers"" is to take the mystique out of craft beer and buy into the BMC marketing bull**** that a brewery like Founders refuses to buy into."
"BOOM! This beer is exactly what they say it is. Sharing a bottle with friend Patrick. Pours with a fine, tan head that lingers and some lace. Color is an opaque brown black. Aroma is roast, malt, coffee, a little cocoa, maple, and hint bourbon. Flavor is like nose but mammoth! And add in there a little fruit. Body is luxuriant and excellent carbonation. Finish is like flavor and very long and warming. A work of art."
"O - really impressed. Lived up to the hype for me. Sting coffee notes of fresh FBS w thr bourbon notes of KBS, then all dipped in maple."
"Serving type: bottle"
"O: I went into the tasting thinking there was no way this beer could be as good as people say it is, but boy was I wrong! This is one of the best beers I have ever tried. The smell, taste, mouthfeel all are top notch. I could only imagine how it would taste on tap. I hope to get my hands on another bottle of this soon. If you have the pleasure of trying this brew consider yourself lucky!"
"What a treat!"
"Overall, this one is solid, up there with the other ""Breakfast"" stout offerings though different. The smell is definitely the best part. Subtlety (as far as barrel-aged stouts are concerned) is what sets this one apart for me. Bourbon and coffee are definitely much more mild in this beer than KBS. The maple is a nice touch but not as strong as other reviewers seem to indicate. This is the third beer I've had from these barrels (kaiser curmudgeon and Cashew Moutain Brown) and I've never gotten a strong maple presence. Definitely digging this nonetheless. The definition of ""smooth."""
"O: Incredible. This is my favorite aroma of any beer. The taste is nearly equally amazing. I had serious doubts about this beer because of its god-like status on BA, but it delivered. Thank you, Founders. This beer alone made my night."
"O - very very good. go get some."
"O- Absolutely no let-down here. While incredibly smooth days after purchase, I'd love to try some with a year or more on it. I'd also like to do this as a nightcap on a chilly evening. While pricy, I feel it's worth every penny. I got to a point with this where I was looking hard for a flaw and the best I've got is slightly poor head retention."
"O: This beer lived up to the hype and more for me. It's a shame that everyone is making this a whale, but I know I'll be able to have it again soon."
"O- This was definitely one of the best barrel aged stouts I've tried. I'm not sure if I can hold off the bottle I have, but I want to try this next to KBS & FBS soon."
"Overall: In my opinion, this is nearly perfectly balanced, but allows the chocolate and coffee to shine just a bit more than the other components. Let this bad boy warm up a bit before drinking so that all of the aroma and flavor can come out. This certainly isn't an after-work refresher, but instead a rich, decadent dessert that I'll choose over cake (and I love cake) any day."
"Had this on tap a few times, but the first from the bottle. This beer pours pitch black with about 1-2 fingers worth of a beautiful brown colored head. The smell is bourbon right away followed by coffee and vanilla. This beer taste great. Right away I could taste the massive amounts of coffee followed by the bourbon kick. After that theres the taste of chocolate and vanilla followed by the sweet taste of the maple. This beer leaves a nice creamy texture in the mouth and a nice slight burn in the throat from the bourbon. This is a great stout."
"overall i have to go A+ here. hype or no, IMO there's no denying this is just a delicious, flavorful beer. fantastic; if they ramp up the bourbon a bit (production numbers would also be nice) i think i'd have a serious contender for overall favorite beer. hell, i might have one anyway."
"O – I am very impressed. This is great fresh, but it would be a good candidate for further aging. If there is a better imperial stout, I have yet to find it."
"I drank this out of a standard English pub glass. It poured blacker than dirty fucking oil. I LOVED THE APPEARANCE. OH SHIT!!! The smell was of coffee, some chocolate, some vanilla, some bourbon, some sugar maple syrup qualities. AMAZING!!! Taste was like taking the breakfast stout, and putting it on steroids, and then aging it in maple syrup-bourbon barrels. It was titty. The mouthfeel was fucking smooth. I could drink 124 of them, though I would probably die, but it would be well worth it because it is better than anything. I love it more than anything, even more than my girlfriend, and I broke off our marriage because of this fucking beer!!! I just love it, and Founder's, I love you as well. Founder's if you are listening to this. Please reward me with more CBS for free. Much appreciated. Overall. If you didn't drink this, you are fucking stupid, and don't fucking talk to me you fat fucking piece of shit. I would pay $50.00 for a bottle of this. I love you Founder's. The End."
"Overall: A+ beer. Yes. For sure. YUM!!!"
"O - A very good beer. Glad we had a chance to try it. I will definitely seek this out again. It also makes us want to try other maple infused beers as well as experimenting with it in our homebrew."
"Pours opaque in hue with cinnamon head that leaves light mist over top. Smells of bitter chocolate, dark coffee, earth, cinnamon, and bourbon. Tastes of dark chocolate, maple syrup, cappuccino, slight cinnamon. Heavy body but smooth. Delicious and quaffable."
"[It is worth noting that my bottle stated the ABV was 10.4%, not 9.4% listed on BA]"
"o- Incredibly balanced and delicious, as well as innovative and different. It's unfortunate that this beer isn't more available, I suppose it just adds to the allure. My only complaint is that I can't get another bottle without thoroughly punishing my checking account."
"O: This is a more refined version of KBS. More please. Maybe with bacon next time? An egg?"
"Overall I was fotunate to try some and glad I did. It is a great beer dark and worth trying."
"750 ml bottle. Served in a DFH snifter, the brew pours dark brown/black with about an inch light brown head. The head stays around a little while, and there's a good amount of lacing left behind on the glass. The aroma is wonderful, it smells like chocolate, coffee, maple, roasted and charred/burnt malt, vanilla and bourbon. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but with the chocolate, coffee, maple and roasted/burnt malt flavors starting out the strongest, and the bourbon/vanilla flavors getting stronger as the beer warms up more. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's rich, creamy and coating, with a moderate amount of carbonation. It's very easy and enjoyable to drink. I think it's an excellent overall brew, it's easily in my Top 10 favorite beers. I'm just glad I was lucky enough to get a bottle of this, it really is a great beer."
"O: I have to say it's one of the best beers I've ever had. Founders really knows what they're doing when it comes to -bbal beers, and CBS is no different. I wish it was easier to get ahold of, but I am glad to have gotten to try this titan of the beer world."
"Overall, an amazing beer and an experience. When I had the first batch last year I was not impressed, I think they really upped their game this year, one of the tastiest brews from them, about even with KBS though I might prefer this one. Awesome."
"O: One of the best beers I have ever had. I love sweet, low hop imperial stouts and this is certainly one of the best."
"I was at Founders for the CBS release on 10-1-11, was able to buy two bottles that day. I still have not opened them as of this date, but I drank two glasses on-tap that day and it was fantastic! Even though stouts are not my favorite style of beer, it was one of the best beers I have ever had. Everything about it was great. The total blend of coffee, maple, and bourbon melted in your mouth like candy."
"D/O - Drinkability is high. I never got to try this on tap before, so this is my first exposure to the famed CBS and I have to say it has lived up to my expectations. The adjectives that immediately come to mind are ones of high praise, from decadent, to gourmet, to incredibly rich. While FBS and KBS tend to be somewhat bitter, this beer is actually quite sweet, so that's probably the major difference between this one and its predecessors (besides the maple), which is worth noting. Plain and simple, this is excellence in beer form and is worthy of any and all praise it receives."
"Notes: This beast is full-bodied, complex, and one of the easiest-going stouts of this caliber that I have ever tried. I can truly see what the hype is about. It has everything going for it. Smooth as all Hell, but I think a few months in the bottle would do this beer some good. Glad I had a chance to try it."
"D = high drinkablilty. Overall, this is a phenomenal stout, the sweetness is a great touch, not too sweet, but enough to hide the alcohol and make it really dangerous if it were available more readily."
"O - Amazing beer. Just slightly above KBS for me."
"Drink and overall: Well, the CBS definitely lived up to the hype. Was it worth all the effort to get one bottle? Sure, I'm glad that I tried it. Great product. Very drinkable for being over 10% A.B.V., and having so much going on. Really a quality brew, deserving of the high praise it has received."
"O: A world class stout! I would love to have this again and consider myself truly lucky to have gotten a bottle. Wonderful!!"
"Overall - Superb, a great beer. Admittedly, the issues I ever had with KBS seems to be ironed out so well in CBS. The maple provides a perfect balance to this beer. Overall, an amazing beer."
"overall: this beer lived up to the hype. getting this on tap at a bar here in milwaukee, i feel like im one of the luckiest BA's right now. imagine the KBS with maple syrup flavors and a little less boozyness to the beer. its perfect. absolutely stunned by this beer. i really can't wait until they mass produce it and everyone gets to try some that wants to. its a beer that no one should miss out on having."
"A very rounded and sweeter variety to the ever stable KBS with maple sweetness that shares the stage with coffee and bourbon. These offer a part of a distraction and a complex note all at once. Complex in its sheer proportions of relatively few dominant flavors, yet simple in its intent. Coffee- Cocoa- Malt- Maple. And it succeeds at every faucet. It has earned its way onto the worlds greatest beers and rightfully so."
"-Cheers"
"O - This beer was great. It is definitely not over-hyped IMO. They should make this regularly. Very smooth and creamy. Well balanced because its not too sweet and not too roasty. Perfect balance and perfect mouthfeel."
"O: This is now one of my favorite beers, great flavor and balance, deserves the hype. Another great one from Founders."
"Overall: Needless to say, this is exceptional (as in, ""5"). Because they dare to use such a thing as a maple-syrup barrel. Because it is so tremendously well balanced. Because it is so disgustingly tasty. And because it has got no trace of booziness despite the hefty ABV. CBS!!!"
"Not bad. Very complex flavor. Just sweeter than I like my stouts."
"After calling 25 (yes, 25) local and not-so-local stores looking for a bottle of this today, I finally stumbled upon one. This is a beer that had always eluded me, and I was thrilled to finally get to try it. It pours with a glistening thickness that immediately sticks to the side of the glass, smelling of fresh coffee that's been bludgeoned with mocha and maple. Absolutely delicious. The taste brings all that's right about KBS with a sweet blanket of additional smoothness brought on by the maple. The flavor is simultaneously restrained and bold, mild and audacious. The mouthfeel is reminiscent of excellent stouts like Bourbon County Rare, slick and oily with only a bit of a carbonation and alcohol tingle (but I don't mean that in the creepy undercarbonated way - this beer tastes fresh and well [correctly] carbonated). The best beer I've had to date, period. My first 5."
"O- Excellent brew. Worth skipping work or paying some crazy premium? My palette says no, the taste just does not match up to the hype for me."
"O: I understand why this beer has the following that it does. So glad Founders bottled it and I got to try it."
"I was very happy to have gotten a taste of this given it's limited availabity. Also saw it mentioned that Churchkey kicked it's keg in 12 minutes to I consider myself lucky. Now if I can just find a bottle...."
"Poured into a snifter. Small amount of tan/ reddish head formed, bubbles are extremely tight. Black and viscous; thick. Definitely get a lot of the chocolate and coffee, right up front. The maple syrup is a bit more subtle; took a lot more warming to pick up more clearly. It was noticeable in taking a bit of the edge off the finish of the ale. Over all extremely nice. The smell has a dark fruit and bitter chocolate aroma that is heavy. The alcohol picks up a bit as the brew warms, its absolutely a warmer. Wow this is really a big puncher of chocolate and syrup as the brew gains some temp and matures. Overall amazing!"
"Serving type: on-tap"
"O - This is really an outstanding beer. It delivered upon all my expectations."
"Got this on draft after the release. It was jet black like you would expect. To be honest it tasted similar to other breakfast stouts. It was hard to pick out any maple syrup. It is best to give this beer some time to warm up as it really opens up nicely. It is a very good beer and worth trying to get your hands on."
"O: Amazing beer, deservedly hyped and incredibly balanced - especially given the bold nature of ingredients used and flavor profile! One of the best beers I've ever had."
"Certainly deserves its place among the best."
"Enjoyed in a snifter on tap at the 2011 bottle release event on October 1, 2011 at Founders. Reviewer allowed the beer to reach near-room temperature. Pours a deep black with virtually no head save for a few bubbles of creamy brown. A slight stickiness allowed CBS to gently coat the sides of the glass with a mild yellowish film. The aroma wafts up easily and little effort is required to discern the moderate bourbon notes. Inhaling a bit more brings forth a hint of something sweeter lingering in wait; possibly the maple syrup or wood. Initial taste jumps forward with dark roasty malts covered in a bourbon shell with a mildly sweet maple syrup finish. The aroma while drinking brings the coffee into subtle play. Subsequent tastes confirm that the alcohol is noticeable, but not overtly present. There are thicker stouts, but the extra weight here would feel out of place. Instead an exceptional balance of the flavors, alcohol warmth, and trailing finish ensure that this beer can be sipped slowly for a long while."
"On tap at release party. Jet black, little to no head. Smells like KBS. Strong bourbon. Sweet chocolate. Some booze. Coffee in the background. The taste was so well balanced. The maple really cuts the bourbon and the beer benefits from it; though, I did not think the maple came through as strongly as some had told me it would. There was a definite sweetness and it had a maple character to it but the flavors were perfectly balanced. The beer's ingredients live in harmony. No fighting for first position. Very similar to KBS but a notch above. Booze is hidden. Had two and a half glasses. Could have easily drunk more but was driving an hour. Well done Founders."
"8 oz. pour into a snifter at the brewery today (10/1) during the release party. Appearance is flawless; black with little to no head. Smells solid; malt and wood are both present, and you can catch a scent of the whiskey in it as well. Tastes great. All of the aforementioned items are present. This was my first maple imperial stout, and I enjoyed it. The maple wasn't too prominent, but it mellowed the flavors of the wood and whiskey nicely. Mouthfeel was great for a beer of its abv. This is a GREAT beer. Very excited to have waited in line with my wife (twice), and to have scored 8 of them today while getting to drink it at the pub too!"
"Appearance is black with a thin tan head...looks good. I take a whiff of CBS and I note vanilla, maple syrup, roasted malts and chocolate. Its` taste has coffee, more chocolate, a little maple syrup and very tasty in general. No aspect of it is too extreme, the flavors are very well balanced. The body is rich and has a light carbonation level. After hearing quite a bit about this beer, it was great to finally try it. I have not tried as many imperial stouts as some BAs on here, but this one was quite nice."
"Pours jet black with a small light tan head. In the aroma, maple syrup, bourbon, and a nice roast. In the taste, oak, dry bourbon, maple syrup, coffee, and a small alcohol presence. A smooth and big bodied mouthfeel, with a dry sticky bourbon in the aftertaste. WOW, is all I can say!"
"O: One of the main reasons we hit up Fat Heads this Sunday was to try this brew. It certainly did not disappoint at all. Nice complex flavors that are balanced perfectly. Again, this was aged one year, I would be interested in doing a 2010 and 2011 tasting to compare."
"livid head. Aroma of coffee, booze, syrup and chocolate. In the taste, aggressive bourbon, roast, coffee, oak and a pronounced alcohol burn. The stout qualities are there, with a black roast flavor and boozey barrel notes. At the end of the sip there is a sugary residual sweetness due to the maple syrup, along with an astringent bitterness from the hops, coffee and bourbon. Mouthfeel is full bodied and well carbonated. Overall, a treat of a beer and worth seeking. Enjoyed at Fat Heads Brewers Brunch 2011."
"D - This is a wonderful brew to have and I can't wait for its release soon ! It's what you would expect it to be."
"Cheers!"
"From notes 8/5/11. RB Review #1000! Huge thanks to beddachedda. Brewery-filled 12 oz bottle. This beer is so damn good and one of the best stouts that I’ve tried. The maple flavor is absolutely wonderful and blends into the chocolatey stout perfectly. I tried the Founders imperial stout lineup together, and CBS was head and shoulders better than the rest, though I’ve never been a KBS fan, to be honest. The pour is black and thick. It has an awesome dark brown head, not quite Hunahpu dark but close. The aroma is a perfectly meshed combination of barrel and stout flavors. Chocolate and maple are the strongest notes, but coffee, roast, vanilla, bourbon and oak all play significant roles. The taste is pretty much perfectly sweet to complement the stout’s flavors. I had to stop myself from drinking my entire glass in one go. It’s a great beer to sip with its big, round mouthfeel and wonderfully complex interplay of flavors, but it was so delicious that I had to force myself to slow down. The syrup flavor fits with the beer even better than I could have hoped (and to be honest, my hopes weren’t set all that high). It has all of the best flavors of rich, dark maple syrup. It reminds me of a test batch of bourbon barrel-aged maple syrup that I tried at the S. Burlington farmer’s market. I found out recently that Founders will be bottling this stuff and I absolute can not wait for another round. Thank you to Founders."
"D: This is as close to a perfect beer as you can get in my opinion. I'm very happy to hear that they are bottling this soon."
"The best I've tried. Certainly worth the effort to taste, but come on, let's get this bottled and on shelf!"
"-GFunk"
"Overall, there's a bit of disappointment after chasing this one for so long. Its a very solid beer but certainly not up there as one of the most memorable imperial stouts I've ever had. I'm a huge fan of maple infused stouts though and this one's a great example of that if anything."
"The mouthfeel is somewhat thin and somewhat hot. It does have a dryish finish however and is not all that cloying. A great beer perhaps but not as great as it is rare; like many rare beers sadly. Still to say I am not psyched to have tried this would be a lie."
"0-great beer. I mean great beer. Hyped a little to much. but still good. Knock on the hype train"
"I had this at DLD, but my brain and palate were pretty much shot by the time it came out. This was a nice surprise to find so close to home. I have and continue to enjoy this one (at least for a few more sips)."
"This is fan-freakin-tastic!! By far the best of the Founders’ stouts. Joan Jett black pour with a small tan head. Aromas of whiskey, coffee, and chocolate. Big mellow whiskey, sweet maple, chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt flavors. Glad I got to experience this wonderful beer..."
"what a glorious beer. i love FBS and KBS, so this isn't exactly earth-shattering, but this is by far my favorite of the founders breakfast stouts. i was worried that it'd taste like syrup, but the vanilla and maple syrup is only lurking in the back. one thing it DOES do is help take away the heat that was around in KBS '11. all the flavors come together perfectly: vanilla, maple, bourbon, and breakfast. i want it bottled NOW!"
"O. Very drinkable. It was not heavy at all and it did go down really easy. I would not have stopped at one. Or two. Or three. But... I was forced to. I have had the Kaiser Crum. and it was a bit too sweet and I was afraid that this would be a sweet KBS. It wasn't, it was its own beer."
"Full bodied, milder carbonation, thick syrupy consistency, soft and smooth on the tongue. Absolutely delicious from top to bottom, although I think I prefer KBS."
"M&O: The mouthfeel is what surprised me the most. It was very very creamy and medium bodied. It went down so smooth and it was the epitome of what I would look for in mouthfeel! Overall I would recommend this beer to everyone, to at least try once even if the price tag is quite high."
"EDIT - Had this again as part of our local group's Founders beer brunch including this, KBS, FBS, FIS, and the BLiS syrup used to age this one. KBS was the slight winner for me but this was excellent as well."
"So privileged to finally try this much elusive beer. Worth the hype, but not sure if the $12/8 oz. tag was justifiable. Nonetheless, the stout was incredibly tasty. Huge thanks for the RnH family and Founders for making this happen for me and other BA's."
"O: The beer is extremely easy to drink considering its strength because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste."
"O: Good beer, but after all the hype it has received I expected to be knocked flat on the floor. The lingering sweetness knocks this one down a bit for me. It would be interesting to see how it would age in a bottle."
"It's a very good beer for sure. But it's similar enough to KBS in my opinion that it's not worth the hype to hunt down CBS. Now with that said, I'll probably be the first one running to the store if it's ever bottled. Sigh."
"O- overall this is truly a great beer and deserves all the hype it  gets. Cant wait to have it again in the future."
"Creamy and smooth on the palate, never giving a hint of alcohol on the palate. This artfully crafted beverage gives an all-over warmth to the lucky consumer, and leaves him thirsting for more. I can't wait until the next CBS tapping."
"O: Great beer. I'm going to have to try it with KBS side-by-side sometime to really hammer down the differences for me. Try this if you get the opportunity!"
"O: This is a really great bourbon barrel aged stout, but I actually preferred both the '10 and '11 KBS. A little too sweet, too much maple, not as much depth as the KBS (call me crazy, but that's what I felt), and a little too boozy. If you have the opportunity to try this, of course do so, but don't necessarily expect it to be the most amazing thing ever or way better than KBS."
"O- Hard to really put this beer into words. At its simplest, it tastes like KBS with maple syrup added, but it's much more complex than that. The bourbon and the maple syrup coexist beautifully together and I could easily drink this all day, every day. A beer that honestly and truly lives up to the infamous status that surrounds it. Believe the hype."
"This beer is everything I had hoped it would be. I'm so glad I came to the Black Party."
"God damn. A blend of so many beautiful flavors in a stout that I could drink many glasses of."
"This pitch black ""loggers-breakfast-in-a-glass"" is a masterpiece. From first sight of its obsidian color to its perfectly laced trail left behind, this was truly one of the finest beers I have ever had."
"Ticket #69 so I knew it would be a good night. By the time it made its way to my table the head had dissipated to a thin, light brown ring around the edge of a pool of blackness. No light penetrating this bad boy. Aroma of dark chocolate, vanilla, coffee, maple syrup and whiskey is marred only by the cloud of cigarette smoke I am sitting in. I honestly wanted to take my beer and drink it outside. But this is the price I pay for the oportunity to taste this gem. Taste matches the aroma with sweet maple syrup taking more of a supporting role than I expected but just enough to balance the bitter dark chocolate and bourbon warmth. The complexity of flavors go beyond my ability to describe all of them but my overall impression is that this is as good if not better than KBS and I would not hesitate to seek it out again in the future. Thanks to Liberty Tavern for holding this event and Chris for the heads up."
"O: One of the best beers I have ever had. Well done Founders."
"Serving type: on tap"
"O: Thick and viscous, I think one taster was probably enough for me anyway. I'm sure I could have enjoyed a 10 oz snifter, but that would be it for a beer of such a style. It just wasn't that drinkable, even compared to the KBS a little bit later. Also, the alcohol burn wasn't there at all in this or the KBS but it was prominent in the Imperial Stout."
"D: I like this better than KBS because of the maple addition. I'm a sucker for maple syrup, and it shows when I compare these two beers."
"Cheers..."
"Much more in your face bourbon and oak than KBS or FBS."
"wouldn't necessarily drink as a substitute for breakfast stout or kentucky -- unless i really was out of syrup for my pancakes."
"D - Good beer, but not great, was hoping for more given how long I'd seen it on the top 100. I like it alright, but prefer KBS."
"This beer is decent, but original KBS stout is a lot better. This is too sweet. Overall, Founders Brewery makes some of the best beers I have tasted anywhere. Three Floyds and Bells are some other top ones to hit if you are in that region. Jolly Pumpkin also has good restaurant and good beer in Ann Arbor."
"With apologies to regular Breakfast Stout, this is what breakfast should smell like: chocolate chip pancakes with maple syrup and a pot of coffee. All that's missing is a side of bacon. Flavors are nicely integrated, with only a surprising bitterness and strong coffee disrupting the general smooth, sweet flow. Just enough roast to keep sweetness, maple and otherwise, in check. Medium-thick and pretty smooth. Good stuff."
"Drank all day Saturday at the '10 GAGF, had no reason to try anything else. I love KBS and I love CBS. They are both near perfect. Both just lack a bit of complexity through the finish. However, I'm not sure CBS is any better or different than KBS. Perhaps a bit of fresh maple in there, but not much else noticed. Like KBS, a near perfect stout that is only enhanced by the coffee and whiskey barrels. Viscous pour, silky espresso head. Huge flavors, very well balanced. Full creamy body."
"Go Steelers!"
"I had this at the Founders tasting at Big Hunt in DC in November 2010. Canadian Breakfast Stout (CBS) was pretty much completely black and maintained an excellent laced head. The smell was a mixture of roasted malts and whiskey; it smelled a lot like Irish coffee. The wood aroma was noticeable too. The taste was malty and delicious, with noticeable sweet coffee. There was some bitterness in the middle with a tiny amount of smokiness. The aftertaste was very smooth with the main flavours being sweetness and the whiskey. This is a very full bodied brew (thick, foamy, creamy) and when coupled with the bourbon flavour, it made CBS seem very... intoxicating. Delicious. I wanted more than the two glasses I had."
"D: Absolutely sublime."
"Edited 10/19/11: On tap at Big Hunt in DC twice in 2009 and 2011. Pours pitch black with a big, super thick tan head that recedes slowly to a small cap and leaves lots of lacing along the sides. The aroma is stunning. This big coffee aroma, bourbon, and dark roasted malts from the underlying beer is still dominant, but the reason it's world class is the maple syrup sweetness. The Breakfast Stout is still easy to pick out with the heavily toasted dark malts and freshly ground coffee. But the maple syrup and bourbon takes over midway through the taste and leaves a lingering sweetness after each sip. The mouthfeel is as smooth as any beer I've ever tasted in this particular FBS category with soft but noticeable carbonation. It's not full bodied, but close. Something about the maple syrup seems to balance the coffee perfectly. This is my favorite BS in addition to KBS."
"D: One of the most drinkable beers I have had that is over 10%. There was no noticeable alcohol, and every sip left me wanting more. I polished of two 4 ounce servings in about 20 minutes and wish I could have gotten more."
"This beer is extremely complex but not overwhelming. The sweet and full taste of maple and bourbon are present. The texture is thick and smooth with light carbonation. The best beer I have every tasted. It pours very dark brown. The nose body and finish are excellent. I would drive across the country to get this beer."
"Overall:4.5 Nice and complex just like I remembered! This beer will age nicely! I will always seek this beer out. One of my favorites fresh or aged! I liked it a little better when its was aged. But Fresh is still world class beer! Founders always brings it!"
"Drink- For being so sweet and viscous it is quite easy to drink, good carbonation is probably to credit here."
"CBS looks very similar to KBS, but with a lighter, less fluffy head. The foam was more of a tan/off white as opposed to the brown of KBS - there was a half finger head that didn't stick around too long. The smell of CBS is what sets it most apart from FBS, KBS, and other excellent stouts. I get fresh coffee, brown sugar, vanilla, chocolate, maple syrup, and honey in the nose - seriously. Wow. The taste is fresh roasted coffee up front with maple and honey in the middle, rounded off with some bitter roasts in the finish. Drinkability is out of this world. No EtOH burn, not too sweet, not too bitter. I could easily drink 24 oz. or more."
"Poured a dark black with a small head, not a lot of carbonation with this one, but it did produce a lovely brown head that retained and laced extremely well. Sweet nose with hints of maple syrup, caramel, and some oak. Many of same notes as KBS, with chocolate, oak, hazelnut, and cherry-vanilla, very well balanced. The feel was silk like, very smooth and was easy drinking even though there was a medium to full body with this one, the alcohol is also hidden very well. Overall an outstanding beer, but if had the choice I would choose KBS"
"Reviewed on 6/27/2010. On tap at Founders. Pours black with a ring of tan head. Aroma of bourbon and sticky sweet roasted malt. Flavor of bourbon up front and lots of sweetness. Much sweeter than the KBS which must be due to the maple but I don't actually taste the maple sugar specifically, just a general sweetness. The bourbon also stands out more to me in this one. I had high hopes for this one and thought it would be better than KBS but it wasn't for me."
"*Spinal Tap reference so you KNOW it's good."
"Flavor...WOW. Out of this world. This beer did not disappoint! Great thick chewy mouthfeel, chocolate, toasted malts, and thick sweet maple syrup! I'm not sure if this is so chunky due to it being bottled...but it's a little unusual. Regardless, it doesn't scare me away. Thick, low carbonation, chewy, malty, sweet, lightly boozy mouthfeel. Delicious! This needs to get bottled more often!"
"Was it worth the hype, yep, pretty much so. I would have to say that it was maybe the best, non-coffee stout that I have ever had fresh. Only aged BCS or aged Abyss does it better for me. Very good stuff!"
"Thank you Founders."
"very good drink ability. its so rich that I don't think I could have drank more than the 12oz's of it that I did but a world class beer will absolutely have it again and try and search it out."
"Poured a dark black color with just a hint of some off colors at the top next to the dark tan head. Smell is dark chocolate, coffee and some light whisky type aromas. The taste is what just kicks you in the teeth and makes you want more. Mouthfeel coats your tongue awfully thick, and makes you smack your lips. Worth the wait, and wish I had more."
"J"
"Pours a deep black color with a one-finger mocha colored head. Head retention is decent and lacing is very nice for a big stout. Aroma is dark chocolate, burnt malt, and toasty oak with a substantial maple component and a very subtle coffee note. The taste is much smoother than the regular FBS, which is the base beer for CBS. Like the aroma, the taste is led by dark chocolate and deeply toasted malt with considerable toasty oak barrel and moderately sweet maple syrup flavors. The flavors are very well integrated and smooth with a lingering bourbon heat and a much diminished coffee component from FBS. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with moderate-to-low carbonation and a mild lingering alcohol warming. The drinkability is fairly high for the abv. The moderate sweetness balances out the toasty and bitter malt and coffee notes very well, and the complexity is great. Overall, this is a great beer that definitely lives up to the hype. However, after trying KBS and FBS (and Black Biscuit) side-by-side with CBS, I slightly prefer FBS and KBS. Here's to hoping Founders bottles this gem in the near future!"
"1/4 finger tan head, medium-slow dissipation in small nonic glass with above average lacing. Dark brown/nearly black opaque body, couldn't see any effervescence, even when held up to the (limited Big Hunt) light. Taste is ultra-complex, coffee, some bittersweet chocolate, toffee more than molasses or caramel, with some vanilla from the barrel but I didn't pick up any maple aromas, noble hops. Taste mirrors the nose, with a dry finish due to the oatmeal. The barrel aging certainly tamed the ABV which wasn't very noticeable, decent but not overwhelming effervescence, slight bit of stickiness. Despite relatively high ABV quite drinkable. A high standard in the art of brewing, one of the best beers I've ever had-I came back the next afternoon for another glass! Worth seeking out at all cost, along with Barley Brown's Havoc one of the best AIS I've had."
"I had the pleasure of sampling this at a relatively recent kickass Founders promo at...where else in NYC...The Blind Tiger Alehouse. Into a tulip glass, it poured black with little visible evidence of carbonation, yet one finger of brown head that retained and laced extremely well. Very sweet nose, with caramel and maple syrup coming to mind, but also many of the essences similar to KBS...chocolate, oak, hazelnut, and cherry-vanilla. The taste was just a tremendously balanced mix of the aforementioned, tilted toward the sweet end of the spectrum, with a maple/caramel/chocolate sweet finish. The feel was like liquid silk; no carbonation and medium to full thickness. This was an excellent beer that went down WAY too easy, with such a well-hidden alcohol content."
"Served from tap into a goblet at the Founders event at Duckworth's. Poured pitch black with a minimal tan head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, smoke, wood, molasses, and slight alcohol. The flavor was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, coffee, alcohol, and a smokey note on the followthrough. It had a heavy creamy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this beer blew me away. This might be one of the better Imperial Stouts I've had to date. I loved how the mouthfeel on this one was both heavy and creamy at the same time making is scarely drinkable. This brew had an awesomely well balanced flavor and nice aroma to boot. Seriously, what else could you want in a beer? This is a must try if you have never had it before and if you have and are like me, you want MORE!"
"Sessioning this would be fun...in a kind of sick way."
"Update: smell got way stronger when this warmed up a bit. Maple notes also became more proeminent. I also saw this beer being poured in a proper glass and it looked way better with persistent head and nice lacing, so my rating is going up in that department."
"A whale captured. Another top beer that is far from overrated. A creamier version of KBS. On tap at Blind Tiger. Pours a black color with a caramel colored foam head. Has an aroma of chocolate, coffee, roast, and bourbon. Has a sweet chocolate start, with coffee spice on the back end. A nice velvety chocolate finish. Medium mouthfeel. Despite what the great Damico says, CBS is better than KBS. It is creamier which tempers the abv. You'd think one adverse to boozy beers would agree."
"Overall, while Alan J. is away the Tigerites will still obey - respect beer!"
"I will be getting some KBS Sunday at the end of Cleveland Beer week, thus making the circle nearly complete. I am really hoping KBS is heavier on the coffee and less on the sweetness compared to CBS."
"Huge thanks to Thirstybird for sharing this one. Served in a tulip. Pours one shade shy of black with a thin, tan-colored head that dissipates into a sudsy swirl around the edges. Nose reveals bourbon, with a trace of maple syrup towards the back. Taste follows nose - not complex, but incredible balance. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light carbonation - smooth and silky. Incredibly easy drinking. Not at all cloying considering the dominant flavors being bourbon and maple syrup. Having had this at EBF last year, I have to say that there was surprisingly less maple syrup in this one and have to wonder if there might be some variation in vintages. An exceptional American Double/Imperial Stout."
"D. Very drinkable. Not overpowering. I'll be there for a tapping anytime this comes near - truly wonderful."
"I was really impressed with this beer. Even though the addition of maple syrup did little flavor-wise, it really helped to mellow out the roasty bitterness in this brew."
"Drinkability: This is by far my favorite version of the Founders Breakfast Stout. If this was available even seasonally, I would spend all of my beer budget solely on this."
"Poured a very near black with a small head. Aromas of coffee, maple syrup, roasted malt, with a touch of vanilla. Taste was coffee, maple syrup, roasted malt, and bourbon. I hope to try this again on a clean palate as I was hoping/expecting more from the hype: good but not great in my humble opinion."
"D As good as advertised, the 6 oz pours were enough to get a feel for this highly acclaimed beer. Very drinkable to the point taht it could sneak up on you Would of liked to try it out of a snifter and let it open up a bit, but I wont complain that I had a couple tastes of this. Cant wait for the next time to try again."
"D - This is pretty easy to drink. A little warm, but otherwise I could put down quite a bit of this. World class for sure."
"John Host from Founders explained to me why CBS will never see bottles. It uses barrells that had Bourbon and then were used to age a Bourbon Barrell Maple Syrup...which is obviously,a very limited production gourmet treat. CBS can only be produced in the quantity the supply of barrels permits,and that's just enough to do this sort of tasting,not even enough to have full kegs sent to all the bars who'd like to have them."
"D: Hells yeah, but not quite as awesome as I would have thought. Mellow, smooth, and delicious."
"edit: just checked. I rated this higher. It appears I know what I'm doing."
"Bottle this please!"
"Very drinkable and enjoyable. It is hard to pace myself because it is so tasty and goes down so easily. Probably the best of the three breakfast stouts that Founders makes. This is a world glass beer all the way and is absolutely recommended."
"D- for one of the boldest and interesting beers I've ever had and as complex as it is you can sit and enjoy it very easily. Fabulous stuff and never disappoints."
"Dangerously drinkable for such a thick, heavy beer. Incredible."
"Drinkability -- Disclaimer: I think KBS is good, but not great. Now that's out of the way, I have to say that I really enjoyed CBS. The sharp bourbon that I dislike in KBS is a lot smoother, more malt sweetness comes through (only 45 IBU's; nearly half that of KBS). The maple is noticable, but not even as pronounced as the chocolate. This beer is very balanced and much more easy-drinking than KBS. Big win for Founder's, and that's saying something!"
"Strong roasted malts and coffee on the nose. A hint of wood but not too different from breakfast stout. Taste is a mellow blend of roasted malts, coffee, and oatmeal with definite woody undertones. onts of maple underlie the whole thing! Very tasty but not all that different from KBS"
"The best stout I have ever tasted. Period. This is amazing. Will definitely be trying to track down more. The thought of this being left on a sidewalk makes me cringe."
"Poured a very dark brown, nearly black with a small lingering brown head. Aromas of oak, bitter chocolte, espresso, light vanilla and a hint of maple. Palate was medium bodied, smooth, with flavors of roasted malt, coffee, maple syrup, oak and bourbon, with a smooth warming finish."
"Smooth overall. Feel is a touch light for style, yet at 9.4 it's easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Except for the high abv that prevents it from being a session beer, this is a mighty tasty treat to enjoy fully."
"Awesome. Really similar to KBS with a nice maple sweetness as well. Also, not as raw as quite KBS."
"This is the best stout/porter I've ever had! I tried Founders KBS at the same time. The taste, balance and complexity of the CBS were clearly superior, but then I am not a fan of bourbon which is a bit more pronounced flavor component in the KBS"
"D: perfectly brewed beer, more drinkable than kbs, impressive beer, founders one of the most sold breweries around."
"D: Hands down the easiest drinking big stout I've ever had. I thought KBS was unbeatable. I was wrong. I had no problem polishing off 3 8oz snifters of this stuff. I could of had more if it weren't for my stinking job I had to wake up for."
"I loved this beer. It's scary how good it is."
"5.0 D: Excellent beer. I ended up getting 2 pours for myself at the bar and I'm drinking another nearly two pours after my failed attempt at a handbottle trade. I'll put it this way...after nearly 40 oz of CBS today, I would still like another glass."
"D - always a treat to get this one...feel like this year's version but a little weaker than the past, with a thinner mouthfeel and less of the delicious maple syrup flavors making its way through (we got some of the syrup again too, its heavenly). drinkable and hard to find a better way to start the day."
"Flying Saucer wrapped up the first ever Raleigh Beer Week in style by tapping this wonderful beer! Served in a tulip glass a deep motor oil black with a nice tan head that diminished to a thin layer and left a few spots of lacing on the glass. The aroma was very fragrant roasted malts with hints of oak and cocoa. The taste was a wonderfully complex amount of roasted malts, smooth sweet maple, and mild espresso, even more tasty than I had hoped! The beer was very smooth and enjoyable, there is a bit of alcohol presence, of course, but it is very well hidden. I have to say, I had high hopes for this one and it did not disappoint, one of the best beers I've ever had, hands down."
"D: This beer is pure ""man candy."" No need for syrup, I think I'll just pour this over my waffle!"
"Pour motor oil dark with a thing, mocha head. Very strong aroma, lots of burbon and coffee. Chocolate, toffee, coffee, maple, burbon, and an overall roastiness. nice complex taste. Shifts between the coffee and bitter chocolate flavor, to a burbon with a ending hint of maple. full bodied and very silky smooth feel to it. Very enjoyable drinking it. was a pleasure, but next time im going to the hospital 1st"
"Served into a goblet shaped snifter. Dark beige head, oily lacing, moderate retention. Aroma of chocolate, coffee, some malt sweetness, some alcohol in the nose and no doubt some hop notes hiding behind the roasted flavors. In the taste, the alcohol is surprisingly well hidden But still warming and the feel is creamy and very smooth. Coffee and roasted malt flavors dominate with chocolate nicely in the background. Overall, hard to find anything in this beer undesirable and it certainly is worthy of the great reputation it has."
"A: Thin layer of espresso-like head, some spotty lacing, deep ebony in color with a hint of ruby - 4.50, S: Smells solidly of maple syrup and double fudge brownie, medium whisky aromas, strong sugary mocha - 4.50, T: Like the nose the maple syrup is loud, there is also a heavy dose of both dark and milk chocolate, at the tail end of the beer a little citrus charm shows itself through all the malts - orange is the most prominent, sweetness is a little brash but not cloying, quite a bit of vanilla and whisky, the whisky and maple syrup meld together quite nicely, an amazing flavor profile - 5.00, M: Extremely smooth, almost velvety with just a hint of grainy grittiness - 5.00, D: A mind-blowing beer, in a world of extreme beers this one pushes the bar up, dangerously drinkable - 4.50"
"Overall, an excellent beer that I would not hesitate to try again. If you have the chance to try this beer, do not miss out!"
"Draft at Mackenzies for ABR. Poured a very dark brown color with a reddish tan head that quickly settles to a slight collar. The aroma is more coffee and leather than I remember with slight chocolate aromas as well. Nice coffee taste with dark chocolate bitterness. Again, I really don't pick up major maple flavors at all although it has a pretty malty sweet taste although as it warms but you do get a slight maple aroma as it warms. Medium mouthfeel, wish it was a little heavier. Pretty drinkable. Lingering bitter coffee flavor."
"Drinkability is really impressive considering the magnitude of the beer. I like it much more than KBS; I find it has better integration. Highly recommended if you come across it. Columbus BAs - get it at Bodega while you can."
"D - Well I had no issue downing 30 oz. of this delicious beer during happy hour so I'd say it's a heck of a drinkable beer for what it is. You wouldn't want to slam them all night or else you'd probably get sick, and you wallet would be empty (rightfully so). It's a beer that you'll rarely have a chance to try. If you see this on tap, pick up a glass, and don't be hesitant to order another. By the way, I DEFINITELY prefer this to KBS. Much more pleasant and I don't get the liquor and heat that I got from KBS."
"Very dense dark black oily pour. Aroma is sweet with some slight maple notes, but this maple aspect comes though much more strongly in the taste. Sweet maple, dark chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, oak, coffee - its all here and more. Simply delicious. SUPER smooth and remarkably easy to drink - this one is dangerous! Will cherish every sip if I ever get to try it again. Fantastic brew."
"If you know your going to have a chance to drink this, bring pancakes."
"D - Drinkability is pretty good. Alcohol almost gets in the way but consistently stays just a notch under hot. The flavors come together to make a really tasty libation. I must say though, one pint is probably enough. Any more than that, and I see the maple aspect getting a little cloying. Still a highly recommended brew if you get a chance to try it."
"I really had high hopes and expectations for Canadian Breakfast Stout. Founders certainly didn't disappoint. This is great beer. Personally, I don't like it quite as much as KBS, but that's just my preference. I don't think the maple flavor adds that much. It's good though, and it certainly doesn't hurt things. More than solid-all around otherwise. If you have the opportunity to get out and try this one, you certainly should. In typical Founders fashion, it's excellent."
"I loved the body of this beer but the finish to was too bitter with coffee. More maple and vanilla please."
"Ends very evenly on the palate. Could never call it dry, but it rounds out, and stays mellow. A definite nightcapper, something to settle down with, and close down your evening in style."
"On tap."
"This is why the CK is the baddest-ass bar in the District. Greg, there are no words, baby. This guy pours an Elvis painting black topped by over a finger of lovely dark tan (bordering on actual brown) foam. The nose is loaded with everything good found in big stouts: bourbon, oak, caramel corn, vanilla, maple syrup, molasses, roasted malts, light coffee, chocolate, and brown sugar-cinnamon. What's more interesting is that I could distinctly make out each of these components. Clearly. My 'strils haven't been this happily busy in a long time. And my tongue was not left out of the action. For fear of being overly redundant, everything I listed above came back, in some form or another, in the taste. In addition to a bit more bourbon, some burnt biscuits and heavy dark chocolate notes join in on the fun, while the maple syrup doesn't appear quite as strong as before. Damn, this is some tasty shit! The body has plenty of heft, with a heavy moderate carbonation and a thick, gooey, chewy feel. Overall, one of the best bourbon barrel stouts I've had the pleasure to sample. Believe the hype. 'Nuff said."
"D - Incredibly drinkable. A stout like this at only 9.4%?? Makes it that much more amazing to drink. My palate was quite wrecked however due to the strength of the coffee and chocolate bitterness."
"Easily my favorite of the 3 stouts released by Founders. Pours a dark brown, almost black with a decent tan head. Sweeter than the other two breakfast stouts, with strong maple tones and the standard coffee/vanilla/chocolate notes found in a Founder's Stout."
"A very good stout. I am not giving it a 5 for flavor because as I noted earlier, though there was good complexity, the flavors were not quite as intense as I'd like, and for an American double stout, I want strong flavors. This was certainly better balanced than the regular and KBS versions. I almost wonder if the maple merely served to smooth things out and take away the cofee's bitterness, rather than imparting much of a flavor itself. Then again, other people taste the maple, so who knows?!"
"4/4.5/4.5/5/5"
"D: Fantastic beer and worthy of hype. I hope to enjoy this again, maybe even in bottles? Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Sippable, in small quantities, this beer is a treat to behold; one day it would be interesting to pair the BS, CBS and KBS together for a side by side tasting"
"It was a great beer and, to me, worth the $13 price tag to try."
"D: A little hot for only being around nine percent."
"Drinking this beer was an experience from beginning to end. Thanks to AC for acquring it. A true double rainbow all the way."
"Special thanks to Stef and John for putting together this fantastic event!"
"This beer is well worth the trip to Grand Rapids."
"Overall I was a big fan of this beer but I have to say that I enjoyed KBS more. If I had to choose I would go with KBS, CBS, and FBS. The coffee flavors are more muted in both KBS and CBS however the bourbon flavors that I love are obviously more pronounced in KBS. Whichever you choose you can't go wrong."
"The beer pours black with no head. There are a few tan bubbles floating on the surface of the beer. The aroma is great. I get notes of maple syrup, oak, chocolate and roasted malt. The flavor is equally impressive. There is a lot of maple, vanilla, chocolate milk, coffee, roasted malt and the slightest hint of soy sauce. Low carbonation and medium to thick mouthfeel. A great beer that lived up to the hype. Hopefully I will get to try this again."
"I can now rest happily having gotten to try this. Only thing now is I want more..."
"D - Wow. Easy drinking for the ABV. I would drink this again any time the opportunity arose. A simply phenomenal beer. Love it!"
"This beer is definitely of the same blood as KBS. It has the same coffee, chocolate, vanilla, smokey flavor, but then has an added maple sweetness that smooths any harshness out. Absolutely phenomenal beer. Glad to have tried it, but now may be even more tempted to open up the bottle I have."
"This is one of the best beers I've ever had. Hopefully our paths will cross again someday."
"FBS was already one of my absolute favorite beers of any style, and this basically takes it and...well, to put it simply, makes it better. Any stout fan needs to seek this one out."
"I've had this on 2 occasions now, once from the batch last year, and now this time. Taste is definitely a lot more balanced this time around. I enjoyed the higher level of sweetness of the first batch, but this is a better overall beer. Pour is very dark with a tan head. Aroma is chocolate, roasted coffee, and a background of oaky maple sweetness, pretty subtle actually. Taste is very smooth. Flavors are all well integrated: all of the regular breakfast stout flavors but with the added maple sweetness, and oak from the barrel. As it warmed up it became even better, and the chocolate definitely takes the driver seat. Stellar beer, and easily put away two 12oz snifters. I love Founders."
"drinkability - at 9.4%, this one shouldn't be as drinkable as it seems - I'll be having a second, but it's going to require me staying on this stool for a good while afterward..."
"This is the third time I have had this beer. The first time it was unbelievably sweet, the second time almost having no detectable maple syrup aspect. Founders really seems to have it nailed down here."
"CBS' flavor more than makes up for what the aroma 'lacks'. A delicious mix of dark chocolate, toffee, earthy hop bitterness, Grand Marnier, and sweet, sweet maple. The syrupy sweetness never becomes cloying, however, making this beer surprisingly quaffable despite its big, complex body. The mouthfeel helps the drinkability, too, as Canadian is light on the tongue (heavy in the stomach) and almost fluffy with carbonation. All in all, a superb beer clearly worthy of the hype (a rarity these days)."
"D - One of the best beers I've ever had, I could drink only this for the rest of my life and be perfectly happy. So complex yet balanced, just an amazing offering from Founder's."
"D: I said it to someone while drinking it so I'll write it down. Every sip is like the first one again and again. I love how the beer somehow disappears after that huge flavor upfront. while I feel its easy drinking compared to beers with higher gravity (BCBCS) the booziness is about the same so I cant give it a 5. I drank two glasses and I wanted a third but not because of the rarity, it was because it was good."
"It was a nice surprise to see this up on the chalkboard and ordering one was a must. Jet black, mocha colored foam rim around the slick surface. Coffee, oak, vanilla flavors mix in with sweet notes. As it warms up the maple presence comes out more and more. The alcohol is pretty undetectable, I think this is more complex and balanced than the KBS. The carbonation cuts the thickness for a slightly less than chewy feel. CBS is a great beer, one of my favorites, I want some waffles with this next time."
"D: I was shocked by how quickly this brew rocketed to its place on the best of BA list, and decided that it must be had. When o found out that it had been tapped the other day, I decided to wake up early in case the keg got bum-rushed. Fortunately, I made it in time to experience this delightful brew. I highly recommend it, as it rivals any other RIS in quality and flavor."
"This is, from start to finish, a very well made beer. Ridiculously complex, perhaps bordering what is possible with beer without it collapsing in a mess. Here, instead we get great balance and integration. I must say that I find it interesting that the barrel aging made its mouthfeel so full compared to the regular Breakfast stout. Well well, to sum it up: this might be the best barrel aged imperial stout I've ever had."
"I may have to move to Michigan!"
"D-This is a sipper, but well worth every sip and worthy of its high top ten rating...bravo Founders!"
"Overall an amazing beer that I am glad I have more of. Can't wait to drink this again."
"Finally got to try this - visited the Monday after the Black Party. Had it on tap, of course - 8 ounces served in a snifter. Pours an oily blank with only a thin right of lace. Very light aromas of maple syrup, with touches of chocolate and cocoa bitterness, hints of some wood. Very rich taste, too: maple syrup, slight twinge of alcohol, sweet but oaky, with a slight bitterness in the finish. The maple syrup sweetness grows as the beer warmed up a bit, and to my taste it became a little unbalanced. It's smooth as all get-out. This is a super drinkable and amazingly delicious beer. And as an added bonus, one of my co-drinkers, who hails from Vancouver, BC, declared the beer ""Canadian approved."" Need we say more?"
"D - This one is a sipper for sure. I was hoping for a bit more maple syrup flavor going on here but it's one damn good beer! Like I mentioned, the barrel aging is all over the place but never gets out-of-control."
"Lucky to have this again at Stoutfest this year, as good as last years was this years killed it. Way more maple presence without being overpowering, awesome balance of flavors. When the beer was gone my glass literally smelled like a syrupy pancake had been in there."
"Served in a ten ounce chalice, the beer appears a black opaque color with a deep beige colored head that is quarter inch high. A chocolaty fragrance with a touch of whiskey a wood and coffee scents follow. A rich chocolaty flavor, with coffee overtones, then the sweet woodsy flavor of whiskey that comes through at the halfway point across the palate; a maple syrup sweetness blends itself into the flavor that gradually grows to at the soft flavor of a grassy bitterness. A thick oily texture, that begins with a heavy water feel that grows in weight. A mild burn of alcohol on the throat, but it does not last long. This is an easy to drink stout you have no idea that this beer is ten percent. The dark and rich inviting color, with an intoxicating aroma, along with the beautiful and wonderful taste and finishing with a sticky and oily texture makes this a great beer"
"Drinkability is based on style. In terms of what it is this baby is smooth as silk. Goes down real easy almost to easy. Unlike its cousin KBS, this one is not nearly as hot. It still is a sipper, but hey the longer it takes the more time to savor. This is worth driving to the brewery for if its on tap."
"Draught at Capone's. Pours jet black, mocha head. Sweet maple aroma with touch of coffee, oak and caramel. Very sweet up front, nice caramel-maple aftertaste lingers with a slightly dry coffee bitterness. Incredibly smooth and far too drinkable. Agree with previous rater: 9.4% ABV is COMPLETELY hidden. Not much could improve this."
"D: I am so glad I got to try this legendary beer, I can see why it's in the top 10. This beer is incredible, on the short list of the best stouts I've ever had in my life."
"Consumed: 3/19/2010"
"Got to enjoy a pint of this while in line at KBS day at founders. Such a beautiful tasting beer. So damn smooth, its like maple syrup!! Well kinda anyways. Such a thick stout too. It was incredibly easy to drink. Definately one of the best stouts I have ever had. So glad it was on tap at the brewery today. Just beautiful."
"The beer pours black, with a beautiful thick, dense brown head, leaving a little bit of lacing down the glass. Looks great from the start. The smell is amazing. You can really smell the sweetness upfront, the maple syrup really enhances that, and it blends and mellows well with the bourbon smell, the charred, roasty, toasty, oak and dark malt combinations, also bringing out a bit of vanilla, and the coffee is in there too, almost getting lost in the incredible mix of smells. A really great smelling beer. The taste, to but it briefly is incredible. This is one of those beers that you hear so much about, you just can't believe that it's true, I actually wanted to like this less than I did. It starts out creamy and chocolatey, the sweetness, combined with the roasty flavors, make it like drinking a coffee and chocolate milkshake, but it's not cloyingly sweet - which may be in part thanks to the oaky-bourbony taste. The syrup isn't necessarily easily picked out, but this is definitely reminiscent of syrup, even so much to make me crave pancakes as a start to dig into it. The vanilla of the barrel really comes out in the taste as well, and I still can't say enough about the rich creaminess, jsut balanced perfectly with the dark roastiness. I mean, it's possibly one of the smoothest (I know that word is a bit lame, thanks the AB) beers I've ever tasted. Just perfect mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, to let you know it's there, but not slow you down any. The drinkability is great, though it's a heavy hitter. I mean, I could barely stop drinking to take notes, but the ABV caught up with me by the end, making the last few sips a little slow, but I really, really loved this beer."
"D - Alcohol really doesn't make itself known very well. There are so many wonderful sweet and desert-like flavors swimming around in this stout, the alcohol might be consumed among them. This really is a fabulous beer...if anything, I feel like it's missing a bit of the maple I remember (but maybe I'm romanticizing my first experience with this beer), but it hardly matters. Excellent American imperial stout...highly recommend doing whatever it takes to try this beer...hope Founders finds it within themselves to bottle this as some sort of regular seasonal offering."
"Notes are scant, so I'll just bang out the highlights. Jet black stout w/creamy head. Smell is phenomenal with vanilla, maple, booze, wood all pouring out. Taste is shockingly good. Especially when tasted alongside KBS and FBS. The other bottles actually cowered and ran off in the Canadian's presence. We've got maple syrup, serious sweetness including vanilla and chocolate perfectly balanced w/roast and some slight bourbon/oaky character. Mouth is thick w/the sweetness making it a true breakfast-worthy beer. Highly recommend. Lived up to the hype for me and then some."
"D-Why is this beer so drinkable? I could drink it all night, but Founder's has far too many other great beers on tap to stick with just one. I will have as much of this beer as possible while it is available, and I look forward to trying KBS in a few weeks to compare it."
"8 oz pour into a snifter at the Founders Taproom. Pours deep dark brown (not black) with a medium tan head. Delicious looking beer. Smells of coffee, rich chocolate, maple and a bit of alcohol. Tastes like something you would get at starbucks like my buddy said. Almost reminds me of a mocha frappucino. Milk chocolate, mocha, bitter coffee, maple, oak, lots going on here. Mouthfeel is thick, lush, creamy, warming and comforting. All I can say about the drinkability is that I watched my buddy put away his 12 oz pour like it was a pale ale. Its really high. I could drink this all night but there are too many other beers on the tap list I want to try. Absolutely amazing beer, my only gripe is I wonder how different it really is from KBS. I'd really like to try them side by side. Maybe I'll have the chance on the 13th at the KBS release party."
"The feel of this beer really well balanced. There is a nice sweet flavor that smooths out the alcohal feel in this beer and hides it well in some great flavor. It goes down nice and smooth and is very enjoyable."
"D: Not surprisingly, this beer had a fabulous drinkability. I never thought that the sweetness of the flavor overpowered my palate, and there was no alcohol detectable. This beer was so flavorful and rich. Founders really has a good thing going with their Breakfast Stout line and I can't wait to try the Kentucky version soon!"
"D: This beer was a little bit of a letdown for me. It was an excellent beer for sure but I expected more. I enjoyed KBS much more than this and it was slightly ahead of regular breakfast stout. That being said it would be a nice addition to their bottled offerings."
"Counterpressure-filled bottle/growler courtesy bret27 at Woodshop 5.0. Pours darkest brown with a nice tan foamy head and some syrupy legs. Aroma is black roasty malts, coffee, maple syrup, smoke, and caramel. Pretty nice, but not as good as the flavor, which is absurd. Chewably thick body, tons of roasted malts and dark chocolate tempered by a smokey maple syrup note with wood, sweet bourbon-like accents, espresso, faint berries. Incredible. Dry and slightly bitter, no astringency, full bodied, epic."
"Drinkability: Huge for such a powerful beer. This was such a treat and its perfect with rich dishes as well as by itself. Creamy, balanced, focused through the whole session!"
"Overall this beer certainly lived up to its hype for me and is yet another expertly crafted Imperial Stout from Founders. Highly Recommended."
"D: Drinks dangerously well for a brew bordering on 10%. I heard the first batch of this was even better than what Founders brought to NoTB this year. However, I doubt it could have been much better than this already is. A truly exceptional stout."
"Smell is heavy on the coffee, with dark chocolate and maybe slight maple mixed in. Taste is delicious: a strong coffee blended with dark chocolate syrup. Maple is present, but unless I knew that was the defining characteristic of the beer I probably wouldn't have picked up on it. This has a perfect balance between sweetness and bitterness from the coffee. Alcohol is nearly unnoticeable.. making this one of the most drinkable imperial stouts I've tried. This lived up to the massive hype that has been placed on it."
"This is a silky smooth combo that leads to a very drinkable stout. I want more!"
"D: Not mindblowing, to be honest. Another case of an A+ beer being due to rarity and expectations vs. how the beer actually delivers. The sweetness and booziness actually detracts from the perfection of Breakfast Stout. I'm glad that it avoids being too cloying and hot with alcohol, but it's nowhere near the complex and perfectly balanced original."
"Side note: mix 60% CBS with 40% Utopias for a real treat"
"The beer pours a dark black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is out of control. It has the regular Breakfast stout scent; chocolate, coffee, oatmeal. It also has a kick ass bourbon aroma with a complimentary maple syrup character. I was told by the owner at EBF that the barrels it aged in were former bourbon barrels soaked in maple syrup. The taste is incredible. It has multiple layers of complexity. The rich chocolate and oatmeal flavors along with a stiff, bitter coffee character, followed up with bourbon and maple syrup flavors. Damn, this is an incredible beer; because of the different tastes involved it's open for folks who don't normally care for dark beers. The mouthfeel is near perfect. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is maybe the best beer on the planet. The KBS was my pick before, but this may overtake it."
"D - Excellent, alcohol is entirely hidden. Delicious beer."
"Thank you to the drunk guy outside of the Toronado barleywine festival waiting to grab the # 22 bus who decided to share this with me. Haha."
"Just may be the best stout ever. Well, at least the best breakfast stout. Wonderful hints of maple syrup, but nowhere near overpowering. Really ties the chocolate and wood notes together into one super smooth package. Believe the hype."
"Absolutely delicious."
"D: I cannot say enough nice things about this beer. I'm absolutely thrilled to have had the opportunity to try it, and I would drink more of this again in a heartbeat."
"Did it live up to the hype? Yes. Yes it did."
"Everything I'd hoped for, one of the better surprises I've had recently."
"Church Key/$9/10 oz"
"overall this has to be one of the top beers I have ever had and probably the top stout to date. I was expecting coffee and maple to have a stronger presence and instead it was chocolate that stole the show. Awesome, so glad I got to finally try this one."
"If/when CBS is re-released, I will be drinking it until I run out of money. World-class in every sense, this is what beer is all about. If only it wasn't so hard to come by..."
"I've had this one 2-3 times at the GTMW and at The Peach in downtown Muncie. If you want to come close to this one just take a Breakfast Stout and stir in a tablespoon of maple syrup. This is an interesting beer and I am glad I had the privilege of being able to try it.Founders does some amazing things with their brews and they never leave me disappointed. So if you've had a breakfast Stout just imagine the same thing with a maple syrup addition!"
"Canadian Breakfast Stout has low to medium carbonation, which has been well-preserved from this hand bottle. Extremely drinkable and just a very pleasant beer. I would drink this everyday if I could and hope that the rumored future batches are as exceptional as this one."
"Aroma is very similar to KBS, but not as boozy or coffee forward. Dominated by sweet notes of vanilla, oak, maple, sugars, etc with a mild coffee background. The maple is as strong or noticeable as the vanilla or bourbon and oak aromas, or as expected going into the beer. That's not a bad thing, as I prefer this aroma over KBS. Mouthfeel is very nice, thick, chewy, low carbonation, not overly boozy, very silky smooth. Flavors are similar to KBS but a little sweeter from the maple and a little more mellowed out. All the same notes from the aroma and the finish lingers forever. In the end I still prefer the KBS for the stronger flavors and less sweetness, but this is a very complex and pleasing beer and hopefully this will continue to make regular appearances on tap."
"F: Finishes slightly bitter from the stout charred malt flavor to the spicy hop addition. It also is semi sweet, which the sweetness up front on the taste has dried off quite a bit to a nice finish. More roast follows late, or hangs around at least, with a little more of the smoky flavors. Definitely a Canadian Breakfast in a bottle... er growler. Thanks again Mikey."
"This was very drinkable."
"D. Actually more drinkable in quantity than the Kentuck version. Not miles different. Would have preferred to actually taste the vaunted maple. I can't say I prefer Canadian Breakfast stout, but I did quite enjoy it. In the top 15 beers on BA? Nah... but this IS killer stout. Drink if ya can."
"D: Canadian Breakfast Stout is absolutely fantastic. Definitely among the top 10 beers I've had. Really glad I had an opportunity to enjoy this one."
"Notes: This is hands down the perfect beer for me. I loved KBS when it came out, but found the bourbon character to be a tad stronger than I would have liked. CBS has a toned down bourbon character, and as stated before, it is perfectly balanced."
"I was very excited to drink this and I like it better than the KBS but to me this is way overrated. There are so many better beers let alone better RIS that no way this is deserving of a top 10 ranking. The rarity really must bump it up."
"All of the other complexities remain. This is a very good beer that I was happy to be able to try, but falls short of being ""exceptional"" in my opinion."
"I'm really happy I finally got to try this, but I do believe I enjoy KBS more. I'm not saying this beer wasn't delicious, but the hype factor totally killed it for me. The $10 pour was a little rough too."
"D: Well, it's about time! I've been fruitless in my quest to try this beer for the last six months, or so. This absolutely deserves all the hype that it receives! Absolutely masterful!"
"Drinkability- Like its little brothers (KBS and Breakfast Stout) it's just a f'n phenomenal beer. It may have a tinge more sweetness than both but it's fairly minimal and really not that intrusive. I do wish it was a bit more different than KBS but that's my only minor complaint. Great shit!"
"Another outstanding stout form one of America's truly great stout brewers."
"This beer lived up to the hype for me. If you ever get an opportunity to try it, do it. Its amazing."
"Feel and Drinkability: Smooth and velvet like on the palate. Low carbonation is perfect for this one. Body is thick and heavy, slick on the palate. There is nothing I'd do to this beer to make it feel any better. I don't think that there's anything that could be done to make if feel any better. This one is easy to drink, its so damn good that each sip is as good as the previous, makes a beer like this very dangerous, but I like to live dangerously...haha...no but I do like the beers that are dangerous like this one. Flavor just lingers too, it stays with you for a while. I mean this is already my second growler. Now I did share the first one with some friends, but this one I filled today is all for me, it was too good for me not to review it, too good for me not to go back to. Such a great beer, I hope that this guy will end up in bottles at some point. Really one of the best Double Stouts I've had in a long time. Really quality, if you can get your hands on some then do so. Its well worth the 14.99 I paid for a growler. Actually I'd say its worth much more than that, making this a real good deal."
"Thanks to Wespatrick for sharing."
"WOW!!! Full bodied and creamy...the roasted coffee, chocolate, caramel, woody vanilla, and maple syrup...Founders Brewery are certified Geniuses! Superb nose, can smell just about everything but the kitchen sink! Extreme light mouthfeel, one can fall into the trap of drinking way too many without realizing the 9.4%ABV may knock you on your a**. I wish I had a KBS next to this to compare flavours!"
"D- Alcohol is well hidden and a sheer joy to drink as it's not bitter like the original."
"I would have to say that this is the best Imp Stout I have ever had to this point in my life. Very grateful for having the opportunity to try this amazing beer. Would HIGHLY recommend everyone try this beer is you have a chance."
"D - More please. I was only able to get 8 oz, but I would love for them to start bottling this."
"I wasn't able to have very much of this great beer in what was my first, best and probably last chance to sample it. I'm so glad that I was able to drink what I did. Remarkable balance, tasty flavors, what's not to love? I haven't had Kentucky Breakfast Stout to compare, but its hard for me to see KBS being much better than its Canadian brother."
"Overall- Smooth and thick but not overly sweet or sugary. Solid."
"Update: Sampled again on 6/6/11. Nose greatly improved and definite notes of maple syrup present. Taste had a touch more sweetness then I could recall. Overall better experience the 2nd time around."
"The taste is bittersweet up front, a beautifully expressed maple syrup flavor lending sweetness and contrasting the dark roasted coffee. Roasted malt provides a nice bitter backbone, and the sheer viscosity is impressive. KBS and BS seemed thin in contrast. The coffee flavor begins to take over mid-palate, leading into a bitter, semi-dry finish. As rich and sweet as this is, it never gets cloying, and this is coming from someone that doesn't like most sweet beer. Phenomenal stuff, I'm hugely disappointed that there are no plans to rebrew it. This beer is light years ahead of KBS."
"Nice. A great take on the legend, but I must say that I vastly prefer the KBS."
"D: Wow, I'd love it if they would release this in bottles. This beer is just fantastic."
"D-Tasty stuff indeed. The maple flavour is not very prevalent but it does poke through here and there especially upon warming. A bit smoother than ""standard"" KBS and just as tasty in a different way. Another fine barrel aged breakfast stout from the folks at Founders."
"Thanks again Eric for going out of your way to bring this beer to Boise.... truly appreciated.... You're a good BA. :-)"
"Very good, but not quite upper echelon."
"Thanks for Fatheads for bringing this in, and thanks to Founders for another wonderful brew."
"Is it the 10th best beer in the world? No. Is is really fucking good and worth making a weekend of? Oh, yes. kudos."
"Tap at the 2009 Founders Black Party. Only the 2nd beer I've ever given a perfect rating to. This stuff is incredible! Black as black can be pour with a nice dense brown head. Notes of oak, vanilla, bourbon, maple sugar candy, and nuts. All in excellent balance. Thick oily mouthfeel."
"D - Don't get me wrong. CBS is a very good beer, no doubt about it. However, in the eschelon of Founder's Breakfast Stout brews, this is clearly on the bottom. While it is a fine brew in itself, it is the lesser Breakfast Stout, in my opinion."
"UPDATE 9/19/09: largadeer got a new growler that was perfectly hermetically sealed, and it was PHENOMENAL. Huge lasting tan head with great retention and lacing. Flavor is just incredibly complex with a lot (but not too much) of maple syrup. Nice lively mouthfeel. This destroyed both KBS and regular BS in a side-by-side. This is flat-out one of the best beers I've ever had."
"I could drink this beer all day and I'm looking forward to trying it again soon."
"The beer is full bodied with low carbonation and a full, viscous, and sticky mouthfeel. This is a good beer, but I was expecting more maple character considering its purported presence. I believe regular Breakfast Stout to be superior."
"I drank this again last night at the Church Key opening and found it to be quite hugely different. The coffee was lower in the mix, with an absolutely stellar blend of maple syrup, coffee, chocolate and bourbon. Exceptionally balanced, this is noted on the palate too. The finish is an excellent contrast between a coffee bitterness (and almost an espresso-like tartness) with the maple and bourbon. I drank about 5 glasses of this, truly wonderful stuff. S,T,D+0.5,+0.5,+1"
"Has this on draft at Tersea's Next Door 08/23/09. Poured into a tulip glass and had nice dark appearenace with small tan head. Gave off a sweet aroma, but not overpowering. Good balance of carbonation and flavor. It's impossible to write about this beer without comparing it to Kentucky Breakfast Stout. CBS finishes with a sweet aftertaste probably from the maple syrup wheras KBS finishes with a strong alcohol flavor. This makes CBS much more drinkable in my opinion."
"HV"
"I have drank a fair amount of the Breakfast Stout line from Founders, so for me there is no question I tasted the maple right up front. Others seemed that they could not really taste it, I for sure could. This is a solid beer, but for me the KBS is much better. I love KBS so much and for me is the perfect blend of sweet and roast. This one bends a bit more on the sweeter side, not my bag. Still a very good beer that is rare as hell and I'm extremely happy I got to try it."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have another because of how enjoyable the flavors work with each other."
"Very, very drinkable - in fact, I continued with two other imperial stouts after this one."
"Overall I like this a lot -not really deserving of my top 10 of all time beers considering I kept going back to KBS while having it side by side and seemed to like that better still excellent and just as good as any of the stouts in Founders repertoire to me."
"d: I did enjoy this, but even if I see this again, I doubt I'd order it. Nothing off with this one, the coffee and the maple sugar flavors just don't go well together."
"The stout appears a nearly opaque dark brown color with about a finger of creamy ecru foam. Aromas and flavors consist of a nice caramel sweetness, notes of vanilla, roasted coffee beans, dark and bittersweet chocolates, a pleasant maple note, mocha, milk chocolate. The stout falls somewhere between medium and full bodied with more than ample carbonation. Really glad I had the chance to try this one. Seek it out if you can."
"A very nice one, and IMHO, an improvement over their other breakfast offerings. Smoother and better balanced."
"Smell was strong coffee with light hints of wood and maple syrup. Taste was fresh brewed coffee with an extra sweetness from the maple, although I can't say I could have pointed out that it actually was maple if I didn't know already. This is like a slightly less boozy, slightly sweeter version of KBS. Overall, I found to to be almost equal to that beer. This is a full bodied beer, but not quite what I would call creamy, and I was left wanting more and more. I can't say I find this to be any more exciting than KBS though."
"Pitch black, pours like engine sludge with a heavy finger of dark brown head. Some spotty lacing speckles the pint as the glass disappears. Espresso beans, woodsy oak, fine chocolate and alcohol are all right up front. I just wanna sit and smell it. Belgian chocolate, espresso, more oak, black currant, and plums are all present and accounted for in the taste. Some dryness from the oak tannins. Rich and chewy, some lingering bitterness, think espresso. This is a very enjoyable sipper, not too sweet. Honored to be able to savor this beer."
"A modest 8 ounce pour yields a chocolate brown head that is only a skim, rather typical for a tap pour of this sort. Body is a dirty rusty blackish brown that really looks like used motor oil thickness. Nose is still very coffee dominant with only hints of vanilla and bourbon. Maple is only in the background like fresh pancakes with a bit of syrup on top. Oh so sweet and smooth as you take first sip. Bourbon isn't as evident as KBS as a vanilla character comes into play and almost a creme brulee coffee sweetness is developed. Wonderful desert like sweetness is soft yet rich and bold while it paints a very thick coating feel on the tongue. Wonderfully drinkable brew that is nectar with it's tasty sweetness."
"A++ offering, great job Founders!!"
"D: I'll definitely have another, and definitely worth the hype. Great drinking stout. Despite the ABV this will disappear from your glass quite rapidly!"
"D: Be careful! Nice job in hiding the ABV, which is about 9.5% according to BA. Damn! I'd have several for breakfast any day and would probably be joining AA as a result (LOL!)"
"I had three pours, 2 paid for by the Founders rep Mike Bell, who bought the first round for the whole house!"
"Poured out of a growler courtesy of Jcb890. I wish there was a procedure to replace my blood with this beer. It is epic. Pours as any stout should. Jet black color with a dark tan head. Head retention is good as a thin layer of foam remains throughout the glass. Vanilla, coffee, caramel and a sweet maple aroma dominate the nose. The taste is incredible. Very complex beer that gets better as you get deeper into the glass. Starts off with vanilla/caramel sweetness. The coffee notes come through in the middle, followed by a bit of booziness. The maple comes through at the finish, although it's mixed with a nice roasted character. This is one of the smoothest beers I've had the pleasure of drinking. Almost a creamy quality to it. After taking a sip it seems like it coats the tongue. Despite being a stronger ABV it is surprisingly drinkable. All said and done, this is probably the best beer I've had to date. If you ever have a chance to try this, please do it, even if you have to drive to Africa."
"- PS/Update: just finished off the growler... I would trade my soul for more of this."
"Very full bodied and velvety smooth. Had I had more time I think I could have enjoyed way to many of these. I kept thinking of the KBS during this drinking experience and how I would love a side by side tasting. The problem with this beer is founders may not make it again which would truly be a shame."
"Good beer, the best of the Breakfast Stout series Founder's has released. That said, it isn't a great beer, and certainly not one of the top ten beers in the world. I have always felt that limited, on-tap only releases tend to hype beer and inflate scores. This is a good example of that theory in action."
"Overall, it is delicious. Does it get anymore amazing than a beer that was aged in a mine in barrels that held both whisky and maple syrup? Unbelievable stuff. There are layers of flavor and the last two to three sips probably could have their very own review. I feel privileged and lucky to have had a glass."
"As a big fan of both Founders and barrel aged beers I was pretty excited to get to try this. Served in a smallish goblet type glass. Stout black appearance with a small and tight dark brown head. Malty nose of coffee beans, chocolate, with a hint of whiskey. This beer is so well rounded. I'm pleasantly surprised that it's not too sweet - just a nice melding of strong flavors. A bit of vanilla and oak accent a deep rich and roasty malt base with a nice subtle presence of maple and a hearty smack of whiskey flavor. Deep leather flavors and almost smoky. Soft velvet on the palate - just uber smooth and soft. So delicious. Hard not to take giant gulps of this, as it's highy quaffable despite the booze. I might like this better than the Kentucky. A real treat for sure."
"Moderate roasted barley and coffee notes up front. Sweet mixture of dark fruits, toffee, vanilla, and molasses take over. Light smoky twang throughout. Full-bodied, thick creamy feel into the finish. Finish is the most maple syrup-affected part of this beer and it works very nicely. Reminiscent of KBS, but minus the bourbon, and plus the sweetness. Delicious and would buy a case of this if it were ever bottled."
"Enjoy..."
"if i had to pick out one thing about this beer,it's how incredibly smooth it is.the maple whiskey barrel aging complements this as well."
"D: Like the other Breakfast stouts from Founders, I find this one enjoyable but hardly transcendent."
"D. If you would tell me this is a 9.4 I would tell you no way, even after seeing the label. Great beer, would probably rate in my top 10."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, velvetty, warming, n chewy."
"Poured a dark black color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of woodiness, earthy, some whiskey, chocolate, nutty, vanilla, and maple syrup. Tastes of chocolate, the same woodiness, lighter whiskey, vanilla, roasty, and chocolate. Lighter alcohol in the finish, but overall well hidden. This was pretty damn good and glad I had a few glasses of it!"
"This was awesome, one of my top five beers ever. I want to drive to Michigan and hijack any they might have left."
"D - I didn't believe it was 9.4 until I re-read it. Amazing, I could drink this stuff until I passed out"
"D: Decent high abv but drinks real easy."
"Overall, a near perfect brew."
"Had this on tap at Kelleher's Irish Pub in Peoria. Was served in a snifter. The bartender was pretty awesome and knowledgeable and told me this one was tasty and she even compared it to the Kentucky Breaksfast Stout for me since this was my first time having it :) The appearance was pitch black with a nice big tan head. The head pretty quickly went down to almost nothing within a few minutes. Despite this happening it still left some, not much, but some lacing down the sides of the glass. Looks very good. I didn't get to much out of the aroma but from what was there it was some coffee and some chocolate as well as some roasted malts. Could have been just me but all the smell was pretty faint and not there but for what was there it was good, like I said was probably just me. The taste, oh my god! Pretty much incredible. Lot's of chocolate in the taste which I wasn't expecting but it was quite the pleasant surprise. There was also some coffee present and some roasted malt. I could also pick up on the bourbon/whiskey flavors and the oak, very nice. The taste was incredible. I've only had the regular Breakfast Stout which was extremely great but this one was amazing! Pretty thick mouthfeel which was just perfect. Drinkability was high especially considering the high ABV and the alcohol was hidden so well. I went in knowing they had this on tap only to have one and ended up drinking three it was so delicious. By far one of the best beers I've ever had. The regular Founder Breakfast Stout was amazing enough but this one, wow, I could drink this every day all day. Like I said, one of the best I've ever had!"
"D- a treat that i wish wasnt so rare. glad i got to try this one. check it out if given the chance. i would have probably gotten a second glass if i was able to."
"D - This was an excellent beer-it is so rich it has to be a sipper. I couldn't have asked for anything more. This was a delicious treat and I am very glad I was able to try it."
"A top-notch Impy stout from Founders which I consider myself lucky to try. Enjoyable in a St. Louis summer. I can only imagine this in the heart of winter."
"drinkability is good. great balance, nice complexity. not sure how much variation there is batch-to-batch, but the maple in this seems more subdued than the taste i had at DLD this year. good stuff."
"Served a little on the cold side, which probably took away from the appearance and smell categories. Poured black and syrupy with a thin light brown head that dissipated fairly quickly. The thin head left a sticky lacing on the side of the glass. Aromas were weak, but pleasurable - coffee, vanilla, and bourbon mainly. Mouth-feel was incredible! Thick and syrupy with balanced carbonation providing excellent coverage of the palate. tastes were complex and delicious as well - sweet like fresh honey with notes of coffee, bourbon, vanilla, molasses. The maple was slightly present, but not as bold as I anticipated, which actually aided this beer to be more subtle and smooth in comparison to KBS. Also finished sweeter and more complete in comparison to its counterpart. What a treat to have tried this rare gem! Absolutely world class!"
"This was a fantastic drinking experience. A true standout beer. They need to start bottling this stuff!"
"D: Crazy good. I would love to start and end every day with a glass of this. One of the best tasting beers in the world no doubt about it."
"Mouthfeel is rich and creamy with a nice smoothness and mellow carbonation. Goes down pretty damn easy considering and doesn't have the strong bourbon kick of KBS. I wish I could have got more than one glass but the keg blew in an amazing 15 minutes. A great brew by Founders and I hope to run across it again someday."
"Overall this was every bit the beast I thought it would be. I will be honest as I thought the maple would be a bit stronger, but in looking back I think it was nearly perfectly placed. This is a great thing they have done here. Taking one of my favorites and making it irresistible. I would have no issue at all with going for this one again any day."
"One of the best balanced, most divinely flavourful beers I've ever had. This falls in the (very select) class of beers that I could drink all day, every day in place of any others."
"thick black with a brown head quickly dissipating into a nice collar of lace. chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and maple syrup in the nose follows through to the taste with a round, supple entry. sweeter than KBS, but manages to not be cloying. alcohol is well hidden. full-bodied and viscous but not overly so, this big beer managed to still be quite drinkable. damn tasty shit."
"Overall, a fantastic beer that I am glad I tried and will probably never get to try again. One of the best I've ever had."
"Amazing drinkability, but you certainly can't session this big beer. Believe the hype on this beer and seek it out. It now sits among the top beers I've rated. Just love it."
"Extremely drinkable. This is a fantastic beer that exceeded my expectations"
"Worth the hype and drive."
"This beer is a delicous blend of roasted coffee, chocolate, and caramel. Some noticeable booze., and a bit of vanilla and maple. Very complex flavor profile. Lots of bitterness from the roasted malt and coffee. A little sweeter than I would prefer, but not too bad, just brings the drinkablility down. Not as much maple flavor as I thought there would be, but it doesnt matter, this is a great stout."
"I'm glad to have had the opportunity to try such a limited brew."
"It's an extremely smooth beer and on a day where I had the BA Imperial, Sweet Darkness on nitro and BA Red's Rye... this one stole the show!"
"Pours a dark and opaque brown/black, some dark reddish highlights in the edges, thin brown head forms, quickly settles to a thin collar, some lace spots stick. Smell is real nice, coffee and chocolate, maple/caramel sweetness, lightly woody, alcohol, dark fruit, very intense roast, touch of vanilla, very nice. Taste is similar, maple and caramel up front, nice rich sweetness, some brown sugar, buttery smooth middle, wood, molasses, chocolate, very intense roast and butterscotchy finish, touch of vanilla as well, real nice. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, some warmth going down, quite smooth. Had an ""accidental"" snifter of KBS before this because the server heard us wrong, oh no! CBS is smoother, not as roasty, but still pretty damn good. Nice stuff!"
"Expensive stuff... the rep said it cost the bar $188 for 5 gallons!!! Wow..."
"D - Wow. It was pretty good."
"Tap at Chumley's. The pour is Black with a rich brown head, as usual. I got to do this side by side with the KBS, and I perfer this one because the bourbon is much restrainded. I expected more maple. I think that maybe there's a second batch and a second use of the barrel. Full body and lightly sweet finish. Really pretty good."
"Sampled at the Milwaukee Beer Barons World of Beer Festival. Pours a brownish amber with a nice amber head. Aroma is vert nutty, caramel, whiskeyish and strong strong coffee. Flavor is really more of the same although the alcohol seems more pronounced and a bit of the Canadian whiskey comes through. Texture is oily and full bodied. Really very similair to KBS with a hint of Maple Syrup. Yum yummy good!"
"Overall, this is one ridiculously good beer and I'm glad I had the chance to try it. Not the most drinkable (especially on a warm Sunday evening) but so good. Please bottle this!"
"I had this on tap at the Founders brewpub, my first choice after looking at a chalkboard full of good choices. Dark brown-to-black color with a thin mocha colored foam. The beer smelled like fresh Breakfast Stout, lots of coffee and malty sweetness with a hint of maple syrup (much less maple than I expected). The beer tastes the same as Breakfast Stout too, again with just a little maple. Delicious and addictive. Based on everything I've heard (and now tasted) I'd say this is almost identical to regular Breakfast Stout, a very close variant."
"Drinkability: only a 5 oz pour but I really tried to make it last long, but it didn't. Great easy drinking stout. I would want to drink a lot more of this if it wasn't so expensive."
"Post-script: downright bizarre that anyone considers this inferior to Breakfast Stout, which is obviously inferior to KBS, much less CBS."
"A little better then the regular breakfast stout but not as good as KBS, IMO."
"D: Woah. When I finished it screamed ""Well that was damn good, now get me a glass of water."""
"D- I wish I was not driving as I would of had another and probably another. I sipped this gem throughout my meal and it worked both with the entree and as a desert beer. This is the real deal and fingers crossed that more gets made soon. Get on this if you have the chance."
"totally a sipper for sure...changes can be found as the beer warms so no need to pound it down...very balanced and almost begs you to order another...i only had 1 tonight but could have easily drank 2 or 3 more"
"This was a fantastic beer. One of the best in the class, if not the best, that I have had to date. Founders, please, for your own sake and mine, start making this beer on a regular basis!"
"Overall a very good beer. Personally I'd take the regular Breakfast Stout or KBS over the CBS, but glad I had a chance to try it, & if it shows up in the Cities again, I'll go have another glass."
"Still, I got a small glass and it was a tasty treat. No, it'd didn't change my world or light up my tastebuds like my favorite beers, but I'd easily say it's near the top of the style. You've got a hint of maple syrup with bourbon and vanilla oak, all paired with rich, delicious coffee - and that's before you even get to the malts. The malt actually just provided a gentle, dry dark chocolate flavor behind all the bigger dessert flavors. A heck of beer and very drinkable for the style, but not a best-in-the-world beer in my opinion. Still, very, very good. I can't stress that enough."
"Drinkability- well good for the style. Really enjoyed this one."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer. I wish I could have this aged but alas, it's not bottled. Oh well good job on raising the bar Founder's!"
"D - I would rate the drinkability as high even considering the high ABV. Is it worth selling your house to sample this beer - no. However - I believe if you can get your hands on some it's quite enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Moderate to good - almost too sweet for the style; keeps it from going down too fast."
"Drinkability: Moderate. The flavors are nice and pretty much what I would have expected from this offering, but the sweetness gets to be a bit much and the mouthfeel gets a bit disconcerting because it doesn't feel like a ""beer."""
"I was thrilled to see this rare gem on the ridiculous guest taps. This was probably my second favorite beer behind '09 VBDL. Deep, rich black center with a very dark brown edge. The aroma suffered being served in plastic, but not at all with the flavor. This had even more of a ""breakfast"" feel to it with maple syrup note that came across much drier than expected. The roasted malts brought an excellent smoky, charred note that brought to mind its stablemate Kentucky Breakfast Stout. Wow, it just seems like Founders can do no wrong with the style. CBS, KBS, Breakfast, and their Imperial are all beers worthy of the hype and I find myself compelled to buy them every chance I get."
"Fantastic, get out to founders and try it."
"This is a standout beer."
"This beer is fantastic. The apperance is similar to KBS, pitch black with a nice tan head. The aroma is distinct and divine. You can tell there is some maple in the nose. The taste is wonderful, it doesn't hit you in the face with Bourbon like KBS. It's more complex, definite sweetness from the maple syrup barrels. Epic. For a stout, it doesn't get much better or complex than this. The alcohol is non existent. The drinkability is incredible for as much as there is going on in this thing. Wow, what a beer. If you can get this, don't hesitate."
"Only drawback thus far is the intense grain scents from the brewing operation throwing off the aroma from time to time."
"I was really impressed with this beer. Even though the addition of maple syrup did little flavor-wise, it really helped to mellow out the roasty bitterness in this brew. Definitely seek this one out, if you can find it!"
"I want more, please!"
"If there is ever one truly great thing which we, here on BA.com and as advocates of great beer in general, may hope to do for the universe of beer... it would be getting this beer released for real, if only in short supply. It was truly, the greatest beer I could even imagine."
"Pours very dark brown in color. There's just a ring of froth around the perimeter of the glass. Smell is black roasted coffee, some cocoa and a very nice, rich maple smell. The maple flavors really shine in the flavor. It takes the edge off the harshness of the black coffee and really sweetens it up and smooths it out. I actually am thinking that I prefer this to the regular breakfast stout. Still huge and somewhat cloying in the mouthfeel. Very good beer. Very happy I got to try so many one off crazy beers this year. I consider myself lucky."
"Looked much like KBS in the glass, a thin cap of dark brown creamy mocha foam that gently stuck to the sides. Black oily liquid. Fantastic maple aroma that took the edge off the raw coffee roast, and sweetened it up ever so slightly. Smooth and supple feel, low carbonation, almost slippery. Rich chocolate & bitter coffee elements from the stout, soft maple traces, and buttery vanilla from the barrel. ABV was well hidden, and I had no problem finishing the 10+/- ounces that were combined in one cup. The maple syrup/bourbon barrel really added a nice extra dimension to it, without too much additional sweetness. This was the only guest tap I sampled at DLD, and I felt lucky to try it, though that doesn't factor into the score."
"Wow. Now this is a Breakfast Stout! Not only do you get coffee but now you also get maple syrup covered chocolate chip pancakes! Seriously, this stuff was just damn tasty, easy as hell to drink for the size, and honestly, I think that I prefer this to the KBS. More please!"
"D- A totally awesome brew just add this one to the list of awesome Founders brews. I hope this one keeps coming year after year and hopefully bottled sometime down the road."
"I shared my glass with a number of attendees, why the *hell* were they not in there getting some of their own?!?! But proof positive that Founders needs to find a way to get this brew bottled and distributed."
"My favorite founders stout(and michigan brew)."
"Overall, this is definitely my favorite from Founders. I would gladly take this over the KBS and Breakfast Stout."
"I want more of this! I love the KBS but this brew is absolutely killer. The KBS needs some age to soften up the bourbon heat, but the CBS is nearly perfect right out of the gate. I'll definetely seek this one out again."
"Great Beer Here."

"D: This would be my imperial stout for good if I could have this beer forever. Just delicious!"
"D: Absolutely sublime. Much better than the standard Breakfast Stout, and I dare say also significantly better than KBS. Hands down, this is the best-tasting beer I've had to date."
"D: Zero drinkability, but definitely an experience. The maple sweetness backs up on the pallet where you have to drink a water in between. Full flavor."
"Drinkability is crazy, it gets more drinkable to more you have. They wouldn't let me get a growler of it, but that didn't stop me from drinking a growler's worth of it."
"Had this on tap on KBS Day. Appears like their other Breakfast stouts, pitch black, although not much head and very little lacing. Smell was awesome, lots of rich coffee, whiskey, chocolate, and a bit of sweetness in the background from the maple syrup. Taste was also great, lots of coffee and a nice touch of alcohol to it. The maple syrup gives it a sweeter side compared to regular Breakfast Stout. Mouthfeel was thick and smooth, almost chewy. Drinkability was good, I had to fight to not take a huge swig of it, although the high alcohol content makes it a little too much to have a lot."
"I think this one trumps KBS just a tad. I would love it if they bottled this and distributed it!"
"A great variation on an already great beer. Hope this makes it out of the brewpub at some point."
"Malt flavor and coffe punch on the finish. Major aroma down to the very last ounce."
"This is tasty as hell. The maple adds a whole other layer of complexity. Adds a bit of resudual sugars that go nearly perfectly with the coffee and chocolate of the original. Thick in body and creamy as well. Possibly the most complex beer I've had to date. Absolutely delicious. Some dried dark fruits coming through as well. The finish is forever."
"This stout was creamy in the mouth, bitter in the finish and sweet maple syurup in the beginning. The beer had lots of dry coffeee flavor and some maple chocolate sweetness. The color was coffee black.The head was spare, I tried it mixed 3/4 canadian to 1/4 cherise cherry ale, and it was like a chocolate covered cherry. The guys at founders take alot of pride in their product and the beertenders are well versed in their profession."
"This is a fantastic beer, I think it may be slightly better than the original since the maple balances out the acrid character of original breakfast stout."
"I don't think I've had a more delicious coffee beer in my life. This beer pours unholy black with a thicky tan creamy head. Aroma is basically of the most delicious coffee you could possibly imagine. Completely irresistable. Tastes follows the aroma up with pure coffee and roasted/chocolate malt. The flavor is so good but almost so intense that it turns you off. As good and as pure as this beer is, it's almost like tasting the most delicious coffee grounds in the world. You know it's the best coffee in the world, but it's still so strong that it makes you choke a bit. A mixed blessing."
"On tap at Founders. A nice dark black color pour with a light brown foamy head.Aroma is nice sweet maple,brown sugar,coffee and a hint of alcohol,smoke,and grain. Flavor is huge roasted coffee molasses,vanilla and maple syrup,with a hint of smoke, a nice alcohol flavor/bite at the end,and the maple sweetness stays on your lips after the sip. Thick body,soft carbonation, a little sweet and thick to be called sessionable but wow what a good beer,you swear that you are going to taste or smell bacon next but never quite do. Very Very good."
"This version is really enjoyable and maintains the majority of the characteristics of the regular BS. However, the maple syrup cuts down on some of the more bitter elements and replaces with a smooth sweetness from the maple influences. Mouthfeel is a little bit smoother and mellower than the regular version. Overall, just as enjoyable and really enjoyable version of the regular great beer."
