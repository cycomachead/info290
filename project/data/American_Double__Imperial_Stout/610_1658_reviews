"Just slightly bitter finish, but ever moment before was greatness"

"o; A very good chocolaty stout with a nice higher-octane balance between flavorful malt and hop bitterness."
"Overall: As i seek out highly rated beers, and stouts especially since its one of my favorite style, this offering falls short for me. I find this a bit far from an A beer. Its heavy on the odd dark fruit/sweet, wine-like tannin notes and light on roasted malts/coffee/chocolate. Furthermore, the mouthfeel lacks that thick, chewy body that makes you savor every sip. I wouldnt recommend this stout as there are countless better ones on the market, nor am i going to seek this out again. I find this beer overrated to say the least"

"Mediocre but priced reasonably cheap. Have no idea why this is rated so high."

"My favorite from Bear Republic, and one of the better stouts I've had. Dark, sweet, and smooth"
"Pours nice enough. Black with a small head that sticks. I agree with other reviews I've seen on this one, the alcohol comes through strong in this one, as if it were barrel aged. Not a bad thing per se, but not something I was expecting from a regular imperial stout. I get lots of deep roast and caramel but any other complexities are blanketed by the alcohol. Does go down smooth and lingers on the tongue. I'm not sure what to think of this one, not my favorite in the style but not terrible by any means. Eh."

"Pours pitch black with a finger width, brown foamy head.  Head retention is mild.  Lacing is moderate.  Dark chocolate, coffee aroma with slight black licorice.  Nice, smooth roasted coffee with a chocolate aftertaste.  Nothing much to say here.  Just another excellent offering from Bear Republic."

"Big, bold, black and roasty . . . typical of the style. Hope to see Bear Republic back in my neck of the woods soon."

"Very pleasant stout. I see now how it received such high numbers and reviews!"
""
""
""
"Bottle.  Looked okay.  Smelled a bit fruity, light on coffee and chocolate.  Not so rich.  Feel was on thinner side and taste was consistent but nothing special.  The alcohol was definitely present.  Expectations were high  based on overall reviews and scores but results very disappointing.  Will try again at some point just to see if maybe one of us was having an off day!"

"I'm not happy with this supposed to be an Imperial Stout. Drinks more like a Porter to me. Very thin on the taste. I like a creamy stout, but that's just me.  This that's like a hoppy beer, although I love hoppy beer..... I DON'T want my Imperial Stouts to taste HOPPY!!!! If I want a ""hoppy beer"" I'll drink an IPA,  thank you!!"

"Tried on a whim and am quite impressed.  It gets much better as it warms up.  Rich, roasted malts, chocolate, some espresso and nice little kick."

"O: Bear Republic has nailed it again. This is a very approachable stout, but still drinks right alongside the best of 'em! Highly recommend this one."

"01/10/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Word has it that this needs to warm to room temp for flavor to develop. While still chilled the flavor is pretty intense. Nice balance, but not Black Ops or Bourbon County level. After letting this temper I was not that impressed. Good, but not great. Not sure the ""Great Bear"" applies, and of course ""Good Bear"" is way less impressive. I'd do it again, but...."

"Deep black pour with a crisp tan head. Tons of chocolate and tobacco in the aroma with hints of leather and plumb. Very rich yet smooth taste. More chocolate and plumb, with a fair hop presence and deep roasted malt flavor. Rich mouthfeel without too much carbonation."

"Poured pitch black with one finger of tan, slightly fizzy head. Left some lacing. Aroma is malty with notes of chocolate and coffee. Taste was big, with roasted malt in the forefront. There is also some sweetness and a little alcohol bite. Mouth feel is a little slick with hints of carbonation."

"Although I was expecting a bolder beer (ps. this is not very young), this is a very tasty and balanced imperial stout. Its complexity improves dramatically after it warms up, but it is never overpowering."

"O: Delicious and drinkable. One of the hoppier stouts I’ve ever drank, quite burnt and bitter at times. Although it’s not one of the most balanced stouts I’ve enjoyed, it is rather delectable. I wish the viscosity were increased slightly, but other than that this is a high quality beer"

"A little hard to score as it's more of a 1.5x stout now... but it's good! Pours a very dark reddish brown with emissive edges, two fingers thick of dense tan head, sparse splatter of lace. Smell: roasty...wood smoke, dark fruit, caramel. Taste: fleeting syrupy dark chocolate, pine, roast, caramel, fig and raisin, brown bread, thinning out to a pine and date + raisin finish. Tasty, easy drinker."

"This is solid, but it's somewhat boring and not as bold as I was hoping for. It's crazy that it's 2014 and this is my first time trying this beer, so I had some high hopes. It's not bad, but it's nothing too special."
""
""
""
""
"So as a IS this is a pretty good beer, a good combination of cocoa, dark fruit and malts. Has a certain creaminess that makes it easy to drink. Being a IS I was expecting more in the hops bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good stout, killer price."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep dark brown with a finger of head that dissipated at a somewhat quick pace. The nose has the quality of roasted malts. The flavor profile is deeply roasty and the finish has a nice dry bitter roast quality. The body on this offering is perfectly hearty. I could enjoy a few of these anytime. Excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an exceptional beer and I cant wait to pick up some more."
""
""
""
""
"pours into tulip, . getting a lack of real crazy flavors. but a beyond perfect balalance and drinkability. it does have faint notes of all kinds but it doesn't hit me as especially roasty, sweet, boozy, smokey, just a nice subtle meld. at 8%abv it's almost sessionable"

"a pint bottle for only 5 dollars i will defiantly be buying this again"
""
""
""
""
""

"O: This is a good stout, but definitely overrated in my opinion. It's just kind of boring. Recommended, perhaps best if it's fresh (maybe it's supposed to be hoppy)."

"Poured from a 650 ml bottle. Pours black-brown colour. Not huge on the nose. Subtle notes of chocolate and molasses. Tastes very smooth and hides its alcohol well. There are chocolate and dark fruit notes toward the back of the palate and the finish is nice and bitter. Medium- to full-bodied, but not too heavy. Very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"O: For $5, this is one hell of a deal for a bomber. I will certainly grab this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The malts are roasted and there is a quick lingering hop finish. But for 8.1% ABV the alcohol is well integrated."

"Overall - This is one large, bold, kick-ass beer. At what point does an ale become a barley wine? This stout is a fine product but it's a little gnarly for my palate. Enjoy carefully."
""
"Overall not bad, just very average for the style. I noticed a few people giving this brew a pass by rating it as a regular stout, or Euro. But, when rated compared to it's peers as a Double Stout or RIS, it's just out classed."
""
""
"Great looking brew, easy 2 finger head that slowly settled leaving nice lacing down the glass. Nice malty, molasses smell. Very balanced taste, one of the most enjoyable glasses I've had in a while. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy and very smooth. I need some more of this, it falls right in with what I enjoy most, a good stout or a Belgian Dark Ale."

"Overall: Extremely balanced for a double stout. I can enjoy a couple of these here and there. Very delicious and tasty."
""
""
""
""

"D) Really good, well-balanced imperial stout. This is a case of less is more. Recommended."

"Draft poured into a Pilsner, no big head, but lovely lacing. It has the dark brown-black color of used motor oil--I love it! My nose is not so discerning, but I detect malt, hops, and a bit of fruit in the aroma. The flavor starts out very bold--hops, coffee, figs, some malt, very well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium to thick. Overall this is an iutstanding stout. I think this one has even more character and complexity than Sierra Nevada Stout, which I really like."

"overall a great stout!"

"Overall I am enjoying this a lot and would buy again. It's less complex than some of the really bold imperials that throw a ton of different flavor notes in them.. This is simple, well balanced and very drinkable"
""
""
""
"Overall- Doesn't have the strong, flavorful malty backbone that many superior Imperials have. Too many better options out there to ever buy this again."
""
"O - 4.0 - good beer, just not great. Its a good beer i would buy again if I wanted a bomber of stout for 4.50."
""
""
""
""
""
" O- get it if you can, a sweet stout, very sweet to me! Not bitter, but leaves a little bite for you to consider it ""well balanced."""
"I was pleasantly surprised by the beer and it is surely better than Yeti. I would drink a lot of this regularly as it really exemplifies Imperial Stout flavors without messing around."

"Big Bear is black with a light brown, creamy head. This beer smells of roasted malt, caramel, some definite hoppiness and a hint of vanilla. Deep roasted coffee-like flavor full of roasted malt, burnt caramel and some hops. All in all incredibly balanced in terms of flavor. All the flavors really blend together very nicely in this imperial stout and make it quite drinkable. The 8.1 abv is hidden quite well. Goes down smooth, thick mouthfeel with just a bit of some alcohol and hop bitterness. Fairly light carbonation. Overall: an absolutely delicious big beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Wow, here's another winner from Bear Republic that gets absolutely no hype because it's readily available. This is just a smooth, tasty, and extremely drinkable big stout. I'm not sure if I've had a stout of this ABV that's as drinkable as Big Black Bear is. The mouthfeel is just so perfect, it compliments the creamy chocolate, roasted malts, and leafy hops this beer has to offer."
""
"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 7/26/2011. Pours pitch black color with a small dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light char, toast, toffee, molasses, dark bread, floral, light pine, raisin, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark and roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, toffee, molasses, dark bread, floral, light pine, light raisin, and roasted earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, toffee, molasses, light raisin, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of roasted and dark malt flavors with light fruitiness; and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial stout. All around nice balance and complexity of roasted and dark malt flavors; and very smooth to drink for the gravity. A very enjoyable offering."
"The texture is perfect. Soft texture with low carbonation, like drinking velvet."

"Overall- Can't believe I waited this long to try this. For the price I can't think of many better, a very delicious and drinkable imperial stout."
""
"Overall where this beer impressed me is in its drinkability. Up front chocolate turns to bitter coffee, im not blown away by anything in particular, but im able to finish the pint easily; I don't feel like im drinking an 8. % beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's quite tasty, which is what all of Bear Republic's beers have been that I have tried so far. For the price it's a damn nice bomber of stout too."
"closer to an English style stout or porter (IMO similar to St Peters Porter), very drinkable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a great stout. Pours a clear dark brown with minimal head. Taste and smell is a good balance of malt, molasses, and a little bitterness. Perfect carbonation and viscosity. Paid 5.99 for a 22 oz bottle. Will definitely seek this one out again."
""
""
"would drink again"

"I've always been a huge fan of Bear Republic. This stout did not disappoint me at all. I wish there were more Stout's of this caliber coming out of San Diego and SoCal in general. Racer 5 is my all time favorite beer by Bear Republic; however, this is a very close second!!"
"(O)- It really is a classic RIS for sure. Nicely balanced and smooth."

"O: I was unsure how to grade this one. As an imperial stout, it's rather meh - but as a regular stout, it's damn good. For better or for worse, this drinks like a 5% single stout...except that it's really 8.1%. Since Bear Republic doesn't call it an imperial stout, I'm grading it as a single. Ergo, I'm willing to overlook some of its flaws and appreciate it as a decently priced (for a bomber) everyday drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: A solid stout with some real deep rich roast barley flavors. Lots of dry roast coffee and ashy charcoal. I think the mouthfeel does fumble a bit and it is definitely not your thick Impy. More along the lines of a Double Stout which to me offers more quaffability. Factor in the very reasonable pricing and year round availability however and the Big Bear Black Stout is pretty hard to beat."

"Bear Republic Big Bear Black Stout ---4.5/5"
""
""
"This is one solid American Double stout. Very likable."
""
""
""
""
"O- I wish I had more to say about this beer. Good. Simple."
""
""
"Overall a nicely balanced imp. stout. At 8.1% it is dangerously sessionable."
""
""
""
"As usual, another fine beer from Bear Republic. Also, considering the fact that the price is relatively low, this is definitely something I can see myself purchasing more of. Bear Republic continues to release excellent beer that doesn't hurt my wallet."
""
""
""
""
"The value on this beer is hard to beat. 3.99 for a bomber that tastes great."
""
""
""
"Overall - Despite the higher ABV it's still very drinkable and not too in your face. A great mix of flavours and well crafted. You can tell it's made from quality ingredients."
""
""
"Lots of bitter coffee and chocolate flavors... vanilla syrup, oily mouthfeel but pretty dry on the tail end. Tasty. Thanks Joel!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very ""light"" imperial stout. Though immensely drinkable and enjoyable for what it is, I think it should be labeled as simply an American stout."
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm surprised I can taste the alcohol at only 8.1% ABV. Not a bad stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad stout, a solid example of the style. Nice gamut of roasted malt characteristics and pretty mellow and balanced overall. Nothing in particular stands out in a positive or negative fashion. It's just plain good."
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Coles. Dark dark almost black pour. Looks like a black bear. Smells like dark chocolate, hops, coffee. Not like a bear. Not a super heavy body, but full flavored. Chocolate, coffee aftertaste, and hops. Great balance. Makes me feel like a bear."

"O: Overall a decent stout. Flavor and smell are a bit small for my taste but it's to be expected considering the low price. Good value buy, might as well try it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very, very rich stout to spend some time with. Has a lot of good components to sift through. Very rich. Alcohol is hidden pretty well."
""
""
"Very happy to see another quality Bear Republic beer here in Central Texas. This is one I'm sure I'll be picking up quite a bit at that consumer friendly pricepoint."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste follows the smell with strong flavours of over boiled coffee and chocolate. The taste gets more bitter and drier towards the end of each gulp and the alcohol is well hidden by the body strength and heavy flavours of the aforementioned coffee and chocolate."
"O- I enjoyed drinking this beer, but it wasn't very impressive in terms of a stout. It was way too thin bodied and could have been a lot more robust. I liked the overall flavors but there was a lot that could have been improved. I would maybe drink this again, but there are a lot of other imperial stouts that I would prefer."
""
"O - A good stout that falls in line with the ""no frills"" of other stouts out there. Seems like this one would deliver time & time again no matter what."
"overal- definitely a good beer. i really enjoy the sweet start to bitter finish and the low tones of the roasted malts. very pleasant drinking beer. i wish it was a little bit more of a sipper than it is. all in all easily worth the $5 i paid for a bomber"
""
""
""
""
"O - Not a bad stout, but the balance feels a little off and it's a shade too sweet for my taste."
""
""
"O-this is a tasty stout and a very good value, easy drinking"
""
""
"I actually had this as a Foreign Export rather than double. Flavours not massive."
""
""
""
"This brew is a true labor of love."
""
"O-very well rounded and easy to drink. Definitely needs to warm to reveal its complexity. I would have it again"
""
""
""
""
""
"very rich dark stout that smells well , a nice smooth bitterness , quite tastey for a stout, can not tatse the alchol heavy but not to over done more simple. The stout needed more flavor from hops and maybe coffee would have been nice overall i would pass on this beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was half way into my glass thinking already in my head this beer has to be rated somewhere in the 80's I am surprised that it is rated this high considering what I consider to be ""world-class"". Factoring price and how easy this brew is to get, maybe it makes more sense. Good beer that takes a little time to break in, Salud!"
""
""
""
""
"O- A pretty damn tasty stout. Lots of bitter dark chocolate and cocoa nibs. Roasty, nutty, caramel malts, and some funky, dank hops. I'm kind of disappointed with the bottling date and can't help but wonder if this brew would have been better fresh. It's my fault though for not taking the time to research where the bottling date was, prior to the purchase."
""
""
""
"Overall: Good but not a standout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the first time I’ve had this beer, but I’ll seek it out again. Reminiscent of Stone IRS. Wonderful example of a big standard stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Bear Republic is one of my favorite breweries - I ADORE Racer 5 and Hop Rod - but this beer is a disaster as far as I'm concerned. I'm not even going to bother going into where this beer could be better because it's a synopsis that is a couple paragraphs long. In short, this is a mediocre beer that was rained on and left outside mistakenly overnight. Wouldn't recommend it, and I wouldn't get it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T/O Holy crap!! Honestly this beer swept me off my feet. The flavor profile is absolutely monstrous. Each sip bounces between delicious malts/chocolate/coffee/licorice/plum? other deep fruits/alcohol and the occasional bit of strawberry. More amazingly, the profile is remarkably balanced making each and every sip a new exploration in flavor. I can't believe it has taken me so long to find this!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a solid American stout."
""
""
""
"O: A very good stout, nothing mindblowing about it though, just a solid roasty but drinkable stout. And that isn't a knock against it. Too many stouts are crazy coffee stouts or imperial stouts that wreck your palate. This is true to the style."
""
"O: Very solid. I see this bottle everywhere and finally pulled the trigger after enjoying their rye and indian pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Honestly, not as good as I'd hoped. Its a decent stout, but not exactly what I prefer as far as nose and flavor. Glad to tick this one though."
"O- Good, solid, hoppy stout."
""
""
""
""
"Big roasted malts and some hops? Bear Republic did it first."
""
""
"O: Solid. This particular bottle had a bit of age on it which might have toned down the hop presence mentioned in other reviews. Overall however, a very good imperial stout."
"Had this a few times before and it still stands up as a go to Stout."
"Overall I just don't dig big hoppy stouts; I want my stouts to be creamy and chocolately, not bitter, acrid and citrusy. This is almost like an Imperial Black IPA (another style I distaste) and really became a chore for me to finish because the flavor profile just didn't gel for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was expecting big things from this beer, and unfortunately it didn't deliver. I will openly admit that I generally drink English / Irish / Australian Stouts & Porters, so maybe I am not used to the U.S. versions yet. Will have to try a few more then revisit this beer later."
""
""
""
"Scoring this beer is a challenge. It really feels more like an American Stout than American Double/Imperial. It has a ton of flavor, but it's mild compared to what I would expect in the style. The mouthfeel, too, feels decidedly non-imperial. But this doesn't take away from the fact that this beer is awesome."
""
""
""
"O- Great stout. I would recommend it to all. Not an everyday beer in my opinion, but it is interesting with a great nose and vibrant taste. If you want an exceptional stout for a reasonable price grab a bottle or two."
""
"o: tasty tasty. so easily available yet so overlooked for other harder to get stouts."
""
"There are aroma of cocoa and vanilla lending their complexity to the roasty notes. The flavor is dominated by roast notes with some sweet vanilla and dark cocoa. Rougher than I remember, and rougher around the edges than I enjoy. Would be interested in trying this with some more time on it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is dark almost black that supports a dark tan head without dissipation leaving fair lace. Smell of rich roasted and caramel malt with a faint alcohol and dark fruit aroma. Taste has that roasty toasty richness of the malt that has a good balance with the hops leaving a bitter roasted aftertaste. Mouthfeel has a fair fullness with good carbonation. Overall a nice enjoyable one to sip on."

"Caramel sweetness up front followed by roasted malt and coffee notes. Then a slight bitter herb hop flavor. Finishes with dry plumb, raisin notes. A very tasty drinkable beer."
""
"O: Very enjoyable and easy to drink for the style, where the alcohol is well hidden from the smell and taste. A great sipping beer with good complexity."
""
""
""
"Drink- Its a very good stout. Has a lot going on and layers it very well. The price on this makes this one hell of a deal."
""
""
""
"Overall - Not too stouty. Light in stout character and hefty in hop character. Tastes good, but I question the label's assertion that this is a big stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a thick black color with slightly off-white head. Smells of roasted malts and slight hop bitter. Taste is of bitter roasted malts, coffee, and hops. Its super thin and almost ale-like. Its actually too thin for me; its very close to a black IPA or black ale but without the flavor. The abv is well hidden but its just not for me...there are way better Imperial stouts out there; but at $6 for the bomber, its not horrible."

"Middle of the road...nothing too impressive."

"Overall - I have to tell you, there are definitely some hoppy flavors long into the finish here. This seems like a hybrid of stout, porter and black ipa - all rolled into one - a very interesting and unique stout for sure, and one that may win over fans of black ipa's for sure - try this one for sure."

"O: A heavily hopped imperial stout, loaded with caramel sweetness, startling fruit, and pleasant bitterness. Highly recommended and very enjoyable. Will have again."
""
""
"Overall, a very drinkable beer. Quite nice."

"Watery chocolate-colored appearance with soft and bubbly lacing. Thick molasses, syrup and milk chocolate with hints of brown sugar, roasted malts and wheat. Lots of wood with molasses and cocoa on the first sip. Malty, thick mouthfeel with lots of dark fruit, coffee grinds and syrup throughout the body. Sticky, bittersweet and dry finish. Moderate carbonation with a medium sized body."

"Another great beer from Bear Republic and a great Imperial/Double Stout. I think the next step is to drink it next to some of its counterparts."

"Great!! I found this my liquor store for $4.49 22oz. I only had 5 bucks and all the other stout deuce deuces $4.99... so i drank it.. wow not bad at all, actually better than most i've tasted. So their you go a top ten stout! I think i can make a top ten list now!!"

"Overall: very good and remarkably drinkable, there are some minor flaws with the flavor which prevent me from thinking this a world-class beer. Still, I do like it quite a lot."
"Chewy malt aftertaste, with burnt malt coming in late."
"O: though not the best in the category, this is an interesting beer that bends the style a bit to show off for those California hop-heads, I enjoy my stouts hoppy, so I do like this beer, but would probably reach for Storm King over it, still a solid beer from Bear Republic"
""
""
"O: Quite drinkable, bitter and toasty."
"Black color, nice head and mouthfeel. Drank at 21st Amendment, San Francisco (01/21/2012)."
""
""
""
""
"For an 8%+ beer, this is VERY drinkable as I found the body to be more on the medium side rather than full. Carbonation is lower than expected, but works to it's advantage - not distracting from the experience. Overall, this is one helluva stout!"
""
""
""
"O: Slightly above average American Double/Imperial Stout. I can use just a bit more in a few categories, a bit more aroma, a bit more boldness in the flavor, and a bit more body. Highly drinkable and would never guess it has an 8.1% abv. It's a solid brew and a real value at $6 a bomber."
"O - This is one of the most drinkable high ABV beers I have come across. The flavors are subdued and the alcohol is non existent on the palate. Bear Republic makes very good beers and this is no exception. You would be hard pressed to find another American Double Stout of this quality at under five bucks a bomber."
""
""
""
""
"A decent Imperial Stout overall, and would do in a pinch to satisfy a craving for one, but nothing too memorable in the large world of Imperial Stouts."
"Overall: wonderful taste and value for your buck."

"Overall: complex, nicely done beer. Just my taste, I would prefer the taste to match the wonderful nose."
"Overall I do not usually like very hopped beers but this one is pretty good. A good amount of roasted malt helps balance the hops out"
""

""
""
""
""
"The caramel really comes out the most in the taste, but after there is a subtle smoky quality that finishes off the beer nicely. This would be very easy to drink, if the sweetness didn't overwhelm in the last few sips."
"Looks good but feels too light and crisp for a ""big"" stout. Big Bear Black Stout is black as night with a quickly receding soapy mocha colored head. The taste overall is smooth, malty, with a light smokey flavor that hits at the ends and lingers. Not a bad beer but so many better options in the imperial stout category."
"Dark chocolate is prevalent here. Bitter to add to the earthy hops. A good feel to this one. Bity and smooth. Caramel is baked, almost charred. Toffee. Raisin. A bit of leather on the almost-end. Roasty throughout. A very nice beer. The abv is well hidden, easy to drink."
""
"Pours flat black with a two-finger very light white head. Good lacing. Surprisingly hoppy aroma for the style... faint citrus. Hints of coco and coffee. Flavor starts off with the same hops. Light notes of bitter citrus rind. Creamy, soft chocolate malt and hints of sweetened coffee gives this beer an excellent balance. Soft is the word that keeps coming to mind, nice soft malt bill, which is a compliment. Very tasty and easy to drink. Excellent creamy mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
"to me this one falls somewhere between a black ipa and a stout. it pours jet jet black, with a nitro looking 2 inch microbubble tan head. smells a little burnt, hoppy, and some dark roasted coffee. flavor is quite hoppy, especially at the end when the dark malts combine with it to form a really unique finish. the 8.1% abv is well hidden, and its excellent bang for your buck at under 5$ a bomber. body is full but this feels drinkable to me, just enough carbonation, and smooth as it goes down. an excellent stout, and a good first impression from bear republic."
""
"O - Nice flavorful, silky Imperial stout, this is REALLY good, try it."
"Overall went in expecting a world class stout a got a fairly hoppy one with decent stout like qualities. If I ever got it again I would serve it colder or with a few months of age."
""
"This is a really great beer. The flavor profile outstanding; bold, rich, smooth, highly drinkable. This is a stout I will come back to for sure."
""
""
"Pours a dark, opaque, brown with a dark tan head. Head is big and bubbles up quick and disappears almost as quickly, doesn't leave much behind. Smell is dark and roasted malts, a bit underwhelming. Roasted malts are also prominent in the taste as well as dark fruits and lots of dark chocolate with some faint hop notes to round things out. Mouthfeel is disappointing, much thinner than I had expected. I expected better from Bear Republic, just kind of a mediocre stout in my humble opinion. I felt it was too light in every possible way."
""
"Pours very black just about opaque. Nose full of burnt malts, an almost smoked beef quality, tobacco smoke, a little boozy chocolate. Very smooth feel with the same smokey burnt qualities on the palate. Big, full, rich and creamy going down. Very drinkable. A hint of chocolate and coffee in the aftertaste, but mostly sticks to its burnt ashy characteristics. A big beer that isn't zealously brewed to acheive astronomic abv levels, yet packs the complexity and feel of some of the biggest double stouts. Had this pretty warm, probably mid to high 50's. Corked some and drank it later much colder, a lot more chocolate on the palate"

"Big Bear Black Stout is quite a good stout at a very nice price ($4-5 a bomber). Lately I've been revisiting the entire Bear Republic line-up and I have been quite impressed. This one is definitely worth a try at some point."

"o - supremely drinkable and very enjoyable. the fact that this bottle was only $4.49 only adds to the awesomeness. definitely going to be picking up more of this."
"This beer had a great appearance in the glass. Very dark with a caramel coloured froth. The flavour was strong - but not overpowering. There was a small hint of caramel but it could have been a touch stronger. The consistency of the beer was fantastic - not watery and not overly thick. The only downside is that I drank ti too fast."
""
""
"Overall, this is a very good beer from a very good brewery that will not disappoint. A must-try for every stout lover and comes highly recommended. Cheers!!!"
"Notes: Robust, full-bodied, and extremely flavorful. Very well-balanced and at 8% ABV, it's quite easy to drink. Alcohol is hidden very well. A solid imperial stout by all means. Although Bear Republic is more known for their hoppy offerings, they make one Hell of a stout!"

"D: this really does not drink like a double to me. a hearty stout, sure, but a lot of doubles are really over the top lately. not that that is a bad thing. it both drinks and works very well. good flavors, well made, no complaints here, just not blown away."
"O/D-Overall, I enjoyed this for the most part. I did not love it. I like my stouts more bitter and rough. This to me is a smooth, sweet stout. ABV hidden well, and $5.00 a bomber is a good value. Happy to try it but I think I will stick to Bear Republic's hoppy beers from here on out."

"The CPJ"
"Pours black with a one finger cocoa head. Amazing lacing on my snifter, and a true black hole in appearance. The nose is mainly chocolate, coffee, malt, and hops. Very smooth and balanced, although on the weak side. Taste is the same as the nose but slightly better. Feel is super smooth, velvety, amazing. This is a really good beer, and great on cask. Cheers."

"Minimal head. Dark color. Aroma: burnt coffee/carmel. Taste: 1 dimensional. MF: ok. Surprised by the brothers 100 score. Wow."
"Overall- I am usually picky on my stouts as I gravitate towards the classics. This is something different though, sharp malty tones, every sip it feels more dynamic. Great beer. Bear Republic does not disappoint ."

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I would have this again and recommend this for those seeking a solid stout with very prominent roasted malt and coffee flavors."
""
"O - Nice to see a stout like this that isn't sweet, but the intense earthiness reduces the enjoyment just a bit."
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a pretty tasty stout that drinks very well for its ABV. I am tempted to say that I wish it had a bit more roasted character to it, but I think that its balanced nature helps set it apart some from other big stouts."
"O: I really enjoyed this. It's a solid offering on cask."

"overall a nicely done stout, big and bold. i would caution that it is very hoppy for an imperial stout, as that combination doesn't jive with all beer aficionados."

"This is a great A brew any day in my book."
"This is an excellent beer with a beautiful black midnight color with a very dark tan head. Sapsuckers in Huntington, NY serves this beer in a large snifter glass. Allowing the drinker to swirl the beer and get a good nose full of the aromas of dark chocolate, and cocoa. My first feelings on my first sip is thick and which with the flavors of chocolate remind me of hershey's chocolate syrup. At 8.1% ABV it's almost like drinking a chocolate liquor. Though I can drink alot more of this Big Bear Black Stout versus a chocolate liquor."
""
""
""
"Overall: This was a pretty darn good beer that got better as it warmed. A 22 oz. bottle is the perfect size for one night. I would recommend this beer for any Imperial Stout fan."
""
""
"Overall: Probably my least favorite from the brewery so far. I think it is the aftertaste that is throwing this one way off..It is a bit like bitter medicine mixed with Bosco. I like a lot of stouts and appreciate a good bitter one, but this one was a bit of a disappointment."
""
""
"Medium carbonation and a medium body for the style; not too chewy or sticky. I think I’ve actually come to prefer (and expect) a bit thicker and viscous mouthfeel from an IS so while this is certainly acceptable I’d prefer something a little more hefty. Very sensible; not an “extreme” stout by any means. Well-crafted and enjoyable but a little short of top-notch for me. Quite drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, kind of ordinary, but certainly not awful. I guess I was expecting a little more."
""
""
""
"Pitch black pour in a tulip with a light tan fluffy 3 finger head. Some lacing and nice retention. Licorice and alcohol on the nose. Toasty, burnt anise at first and then nutty with some toffee and candle wax with more licorice with a long finish. Alcohol is present throughout. Feel is really good. Medium body and the the very sharp carbonation lingers on the tongue. Drinkability could be better. It is a little harsh. It is good, but it is missing something to make it great for me. Bigger malt and more coffee. A little to anise for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"It leaves a good warm feeling and a lot of noticeable booze as I breathe out of my nose. Aftertastes of coffee linger."
""
"O: I'm not used to a caramel/toffee heavy stout, this is a nice welcome change."
""
""
""
""
"This stout hits all the marks of a great stout. Truly one of the better American Stouts out there. Very drinkable and the alcohol never showed up anywhere."

"O: Such a solid imperial stout; I’m glad this is available year round. It’s rich, creamy, and goes down smooth. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a dark rich color with a nutty brown foam. Smell is sweet and malty with hints of molasses, almost chocolate. This is one of the best tasting stouts I have had. A nice hoppy finish to balance the initial sweetness of the sip. Bear Republic really is top notch. If you can find this, try it!"

"Pours black into a pint glass with a small head. Looks good. Smell is mainly coffee, caramel, roasted malt. Taste is quite good, you can taste the alcohol creep in as you drink it, and it gives it a bit of a smokey bourbon type taste as it warms. This helps bitter out the sweet taste that starts each sip. Well balanced taste. Mouthfeel wise, it's smooth, a bit acidic, but smooth and creamy. This has a good bit underlying it. Overall I rank this quite high, but I could see it having a tab bit less alcohol to give it a little less bite. I feel like it becomes more noticeable as you drink it. Very, very good overall though."

"A very solid stout, quite a nice bang for your buck on this one. Wouldn't mind more of these in the future."
"O: Still going to give 4.0 overall, definitely a tasty beer and enjoyable, but I wish it were a little heavier and thicker."
"Overall I didn't enjoy this one, but didn't hate it either. A great and reasonably priced Double Stout to maybe start your beer journey with but not one you will enjoy well into it."
"This poured out with a nice looking black color with a healthy brown head on top also. The lacing wasn't too bad here. The smell of the beer was chocolaty and roasted much like any stout should smell. The taste of the beer was rich with dark malts and some roasted bitterness. The mouthfeel was above average to me, I thought that the carbonation level was pretty good and the body itself wasn't too thin either. OVerall this wasn't a bad Stout, I'd say it worth having."
"Bought a bomber of this for $3.99. Pours jet black, nice and creamy tan head. Aroma is nice and roasty. Taste is medium to heavy bodied, nice roasted malt and a great hop backbone to it. Awesome mouthfeel, well balanced, and goes down wicked smooth. A great stout, hides the ABV well and is definitely one of the better beers of this style I've tried."
"."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the look, and then the smell. The color was beautifully rich in color, and the head retained forever. The aroma then set things up with full inclusions of everything you would expect. What was really nice was when the beer warmed, and everything calmed down a bit. On the down side, the beer was thinner than one might like, and it really doesn’t give enough substance behind the nice base of flavors and aromas built."
"O- Very glad I picked this one up. Been trying a lot of stouts lately but this one is a much better quality than I've experienced thus far. Great brew, def. recommend."
"O- A good stout, but I found it leaned a bit too much on the sweet aspects of the beer. Still worth a try."
"Overall: An excellent beer that is easy to drink and well balanced. Definitely worth buying again."
"O - Like I began with, just an average stout for me."
"The appearance is a dark brown color with a short tan head. The nose on this stout contains roasted malts, caramel and some coffee. While the taste of this offering from Bear Republic has vanilla, smoke, espresso and black licorice. The mouthfeel is medium with a decent carbonation level. Not a great stout, but a tasty one."
"O: Big Bear was a really tasty and easy to drink stout especially for it being relatively higher in alcohol."
"Doesn't taste like other stouts I've had. This one is medium to full in body, with a certain sourness from a combination of the caramel malts and wood-like smokiness. The sourness has a sweetnes to it that goes well in balancing other flavors of dark roasted malts that sit in as the backbone while those other flavors go to work in making this a very unique stout. The caramel malts through and through become the main character of this beer. They offer a sweetness that outshines other, traditionally simpler stout flavors. Those dark roasted malts give this beer a perfect background on which to other tastes can play around on your palate. Such a unique beer is nothing less than I'd expect from a good brewery. The three others I've had from Bear Republic (Hop Rod Rye being my favorite) have all been stellar. This is no exception, so buy if you see it. Decent price for the bomber as well."
"Overall - I really enjoy this beer, it is readily available and only 6 bucks a bomber. It is my go to cheap good tasting stout. Is it the best stout I've ever had? Far from it, does it still hold its ground in this category? Absolutely."
"Overall: Middle-of-the-road stout for me. The price cannot be beat and its definitely unique, but this is a bit too boozy and hoppy for an American Double Stout."
"22oz bottle. Pours a dark black color with a half inch of light brown head. Good amount of lacing. Aromas of roasted malts, booze, vanilla, some dark chocolate and sweet coffee. There's a lot going on here. Taste is more of the roasted malts, burnt coffee and dark chocolate. Has a surprising amount of alcohol taste for a beer that is 8.1%. A hint of vanilla towards the end. Pretty heavy beer with a small amount of carbonation. Overall, a solid Imperial Stout worth having again."
"Dr: Very drinkable, especially considering the high ABV. A complex stout that's worth trying for any beer advocate. I'm quite pleased, especially for the affordable price."
"O - A classic stout. If you like your imperial stouts more dry than sweet, more espresso than chocolate...meet the Bear. Very nice. Mmmm, with a kick. Impressive."
"O: I like this beer very much. I think this is more like a standard Stout, not an Impy, but the ABV merits it's label. I always enjoy when this beer is on the shelves."
"O - A very traditional stout with all the right elements. No bells and whistles to get you distracted and it is kept simple. A very solid beers that should be included with all traditional stout comparisons. And at $5/22 oz. bottle it's incredibly difficult to pass up."
"O/D: A rather lackluster Imperial Stout. Nothing stands out or makes its present clear. Maybe it's better from a bottle?"
"The taste is boozy as well. There is a bourbon like quality here. Chocolaty, powdery in the feel with mild carbonation. Leaves the palate dry, but not warmed up like a boozy beer sometimes does."
"Highly recommended."
"Deliciously flavoured and refined, with a deceptive lightness that makes it massively drinkable. Possibly my favourite stout around 8%."
"Overall: This is a very balanced and tasty stout. No one flavor really stands out or really blows me away, but this is a nicely done beer."
"A subtle take on an imperial stout. Not my favorite, but would make a nice introduction for folks that aren't familiar with the style. Also, an excellent value, if you're concerned with that."
"O: I good, affordable, easily available stout. Not my favorite in the style, but a solid entry."
"O - I was a little disapointed with the lightness this beer posessed. I wonder if the beer was old, or if that's just the beers flavor profile. It really doesn't even taste like stout, more like a porter."
"O: Nice. I really like this. It is a hot and humid evening and this is going down smooth. I will buy this again."
"Overall: For a 8.10% abv this bear is so very deceiving. Excellent American Double Stout. There's a reason it's rated as high as it is....because it's good."
"Fairly easy drinking hearty stout. Cheap for an imperial stout, I think there are plenty of better ones out there but if you’re in the mood and don’t want to dip into the cellar or drop $10-12 this is a good choice. Flavors are clear with nothing really taking over and a nice hop profile with the alcohol well blended."
"O: A very nice beer, easy drinking with a great flavor profile. Bear Republic continues to churn out solid beers at a great price."
"Overall. Nice big stout. Sweet, but not too sweet. Complex, but easy drinking. Nothing to get upset about here."
"OVERALL: Pretty surprised how hoppy this one was after sitting for over a year. I usually like my imperial stouts a little more roasted and less hoppy, but this one just worked for me. Perhaps the extra time in the cellar has done it some good. This was a great brew that I thoroughly enjoyed, and would think it could hold it’s own against some of the more sought after brews in the style. It might not be as big as some of the others, but don’t let that deter you. Give it a go if you get the chance. Thanks again thetomG!"
"The palate opens with a pleasing blend of fruity, mildly tart cherries, raisins and a mild prune character. This works really nicely with the dark chocolate and cocoa that are present. Mildly bitter with a grainy, mildly dusty cocoa character, the balance of flavors here is rather stellar. A mild coffee liqueur character rounds out the palate. The finish, however, is mildly dull, here. This is where the dulling effect of age and oxidation is most noticeable, with a touch of a papery feel. Mild bitterness, mild cocoa and moderate fruit are also present. Medium in body with moderate carbonation, this is a beer that I'm really enjoying, and will have to have again and preferably fresh."
"PP (Price Point) - $6 for a 22oz bomber of 8.1% ABV, this is a smooth beer, no hint of the ABV, bang for the buck is insane! Seek and destroy!!"
"T: Roasted malts, dirt, espresso, leather, smoke and some charred wood. Very dry, very bitter and pretty good. You definitely have to be in the mood for this one."
"O-A very nice Stout here, you should have at least one of these on hand at all times lol...cant go wrong with its price as well...and for being 8.1 you can hardly tell...nice brew"
"I think I went into this stout with some high expectations, which is why I'm a bit disappointed in it. It didn't really stand out to me in any way and it definitely could have done a few things better. But I don't really regret buying it ($5 a pop isn't terrible) and I would likely have it again in the future."
"Mouthfeel is more on the thinner side of medium, with not much carbonation to be felt and a little slick, oily coating upon the palate. Not a bad stout, but not outstanding overall. Could probably use some aging to have some of the flavors be more pronounced."
"Poured a 1/8"" mocha colored head which faded to lace. Black coffee in appearance. All I get off the smell is mild hops. Taste and body were a big step up. It's thick and rich with roasted malt, some fruity hops, and a touch of raisin. And there's a slightly sour and acidic long finish to it."
"I had over looked this beer many times at my local beer selling establishment... but am very happy I finally picked one up. I will be back for more!"
"4/4/3.5/3.5/3.5"
"B"
"O: a solid (semi-)imperial stout."
"Overall: a pretty solid imperial stout though nothing about it really makes it stand out against a style that is filled with amazing alternatives. Worth a try, especially if you're a Bear Republic fan. Cheers!"
"The note taking has slowed me down a bit and yet I’m still noticing the 8.1% ABV. I’m glad I tried this and will definitely pick up another in the future. Hopefully I can find others brews in this style worthy of comparison. (Any suggestions?)"
"O: Damn good imperial stout."
"O - Enjoyed this beer. A touch sweeter than I like my imp stouts, but the drinkability is surprisingly good despite the sweetness. A winner in my book"
"Beer is medium to heavy in body with a mild sweetness, pleasing, moderate roast, a nice finish with good levels of bitterness. The beer has this fudgy quality to ti that I really like. It took me a while to finish it but it was very good."
"O- A great brew. 8.1%abv is still pretty decent in my book. Alcohol is hidden well. And this is at a great price too. Excellent stout!"
"O: Not a very good beer. Just bland and watery overall with no defining characteristics to set it apart (in a good way) from the masses of other imperial stouts."
"O: This is a nice stout."
"I poured a dense finger of deep-tan head with good retention on this humid late afternoon in early June. They got the species right in that this Bear was Black! I have written in ink that was less black than this beer. It disallowed light penetration in the same way that a black hole sucks up light. If I ever found myself inside this beer, I would be utterly lost. The nose smelled of this morning's coffee, commingled with piney hops. Now, if you think that I am kidding about the roasty coffee aroma, please note that I am a retired US Navy sailor and I take my coffee like I once took my women - hot and black! You have to spoon my coffee out of the pot because it is so thick that it won't pour. I once spilled some over the side and the Coast Guard thought it was another Exxon Valdez. You get the idea. Mouthfeel was medium, but not as full as might have expected from this bear. Lots of coffee and dark chocolate on the tongue initially, but slowly, out of the darkness came the piney hops and just a tad bit of caramel sweetness as advertised. Shit, the f**kin' thing's mauling me, just as they warned me about! More of that confounded truth in advertising. Now, it's sinking its teeth into me! OMFG, I just wanted to drink a bear, I mean, beer, not die. Finish was smoky, chocolaty, roasty and I was finished. Warming, the finish took on a fudge-like aspect, both in terms of taste and mouthfeel. Dang, this was real good and I think they still have some over at my local. Definitely worth revisiting, especially if I bring a rifle and re-read Faulkner's ""The Bear"" ahead of time. You got me on this go-'round, you ursine sonnuva beechnut tree, but things will be different the next time we meet!"
"A good RIS, but a bit unbalanced, and strangely in favor of bitterness."
"Prost!!!"
"must say that is is a very eclectic american double that especial shows in age. has the dimension something between a baltic porter, and english foreign export and an american porter. nice and lean with a mineral harsh tannin hint that rides along with the high alpha acid bittering. a tad oily and grippy. but with a corresponding sweetness. hints of licorice, vanilla and big full bodied grapiness. nose is apple and burnt malt and caramel undertones. hints of baltic mineral and wet saddle sours notes. hits all the bases fantastically."
"O - I believe this is the best 'normal' stout I've ever had (i.e., excluding exotics like Founders CBS). Rather hoppy for style, but not radically so, and with great effect."
"O-Decent brew, but there's plenty of better stouts to be consumed."
"O - Near flawless for a non-barrel aged stout below 9%. A touch more chocolate flavor would have made this beer a perfect 5 across the board but HEY! I'm not complaining. Well done BR!"
"O - Great American double stout. Bear Republic does it again. Price is reasonable and product is as good or better as any of the regular releases out there...and it even beats some of teh hyped stouts."
"O: Easy drinking and good overall but lacking in flavor."
"Overall, drinks like a fairly potent stout, though lacks the oomph! of a Double Stout. Also, not too sure about the freshness. It doesn’t taste stale, but the lack of potency has me wondering how long it’s been sitting in the Whole Foods fridge. Sierra Nevada’s stout packs more punch than this."
"Pours dark, completely opaque brown-black with a rich, full, beige head. Smell is heavy with semi-sweet chocolate and sweet malts. Taste is roasty, slightly earthy, and surprisingly light, with coffee tones and subtle caramel. A small amount of bitterness in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel, light but rich. Highly drinkable."
"O-- Nice little stout. Well hidden ABV and easy to drink. A touch too carbonated but kind of adds to the drinkability to this. Easy to have one or two and be able to function well afterwards."
"Everything you would expect in a stout plus some surprises."
"O: I'd never had Big Bear Black Stout before, and my expectations were high. Sadly though, it seems as if something went wrong with this bottle. I'm guessing it was slightly skunked, though I'll need to try it again to confirm my suspicions. I love Bear Republic, and will definitely give this one another shot. As for this particular bottle....meh."
"Very tasty beer. With Bear Republic moving their bottle line up into Michigan this week this was my first chance to enjoy this beer. I had no idea what I was in for. Hopped to IPA+ levels with the roasted chocolatey flavors of a stout, how can you go wrong? Tremendously enjoyable and very well priced bomber. I may be picking this one up more often in the future."
"Overall this is a smooth, easy drinking Imperial Stout with lots of flavour but all of it being in balance. Great."
"O- A great stout, full of well-balanced complexities. The 8.1% ABV is hardly noticeable and this beer is really drinkable in general. Definitely gonna have to pick this up again."
"Bottle. Poured into a tulip glass a dark brown bordering on black color with a really big tan head of 2-3 fingers. Head is a rich mocha tan color. Chocolate, muted coffee, and a subtle sweetness round out the nose. Sticky tan lace coats the glass. Medium mouthfeel. Slight sweet start that very quickly turns to a robust coffee and dark chocolate flavors with a building bitterness. Some licorice flavors as well. Overall, pretty flavorful but I wish it had a heavier mouhfeel to it to stand up to the flavors."
"A bold well made stout in my opinion."
"O: Overall this is a decent Stout,I would have liked more chocolate flavors in this , and maybe a bit more coffee, Still it's very drinkable and leaves a good toasty malt aftertaste."
"O- Slightly lighter than a Russian Imperial Stout, and that makes it a bit versatile as it goes down very easy. Very drinkable, even on a warmer spring day."
"O - Pretty happy with this beer. Not overly sweet or boozy. Completely worth the price @ only 5.99!"
"It is a superlatively balanced stout: while it possesses a light body, it still boasts some flexibility in the mouthfeel that is neither harsh nor puny. It is, as one girl noted during her adventures with some other bears: “Just right.” The Bear is perfect as a sessional quaff for any cold winter night – or in preparation for hibernation. Another wunderbrau from the folks who gave us Racer 5, a favorite IPA of this humbled correspondent."
"This pours a perfect black with a frothy two finger khaki head that leaves great lace. On the nose the big note is bitter chocolate, but there is also dry espresso and dry roasted malt. In the mouth the bittersweet chocolate is foremost, but there is also a good deal of toasted malt and oats. The toasted flavors are a bit too much for my liking, but others might like it. The feel is medium full and fuzzy, leaving the roast and the bitter chocolate on the tongue for a long finish. I like this beer well enough but to me the taste would be much better if it were balanced like the nose: bittersweet chocolate being further ahead of the toasted malt, which got to be too much for me."
"Pours an opaque black with a nice 1 inch chocolate milk colored head. Smells of dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and spicy herbal hops. Taste is super dark chocolate, espresso grounds, with a bit of herbal hops on the finish. Mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. Good carbonation with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, a good stout that is definitely worth seeking out. The price is also right seeing as it's around $3.99 a bomber."
"The beer warms almost instantly and is careful to be relentless without overwhelming the palate. A must have for any dark beer lovers although I'm certain I'm drinking away any calories burned during exercise."
"Enjoyable beer with suprisingly and tantalisingly clean finish. I could drink this beer. Hell, I would have sex with this beer."
"I'm only hals way through the bottle, but i feel like i would drink several of these if i had them."
"D- Glad I split the bottle, I'll have to lay a bottle down for a year to see if this evens out some."
"An incredibly drinkable stout. While not as complex or even confusing and thought-provoking as some other big stouts, this one does the simple things extraordinarily well. A classic."
"Drinkability is moderate. There is no doubt it is a good beer but it falls short of many of the same style. I won't seek this out again as there are better out there and just as available."
"Overall - Excellent stout. The appearance of this beer is top notch. Very little weakness in this beer."
"Drinkability: Overall an enjoyable stout from Bear Republic, which is a good deal for the price, but with other stouts out there, I'm not sure if I'll make this a regular buy or not."
"Overall Grade: C"
"Atmosphere is great. Dark and intimidating appearance. Nice frothy head, and enough lacing. Nose is full of character. Nice grain profile, woody, and some sweet components. Flavor is well-balanced delivery of grains and bittersweet. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"Big Bear Black Stout pours stout black. The light tan colored head tops out at three fingers in height, while subsequently displaying average retention and solid lacing. The nose is a bit muted. It's heavy on roasted grain, rather than a coffee or chocolate aroma. The flavor is a little bit more vibrant, but suffers from the same issue of bluntness. It's more general roast than any specific dark malty flavor. There's just a bit of anise in the background as well. The body is solid, if just a bit light for the style (which I suppose should be expected, given the relatively low ABV for an imperial sout). The carbonation though is a bit overdone, and mutes what should be a malt forward beer. Big Bear Black Stout is a decent beer, but there are many top tier imperial stouts out there that would command my money before this one."
"D: Amazing full flavor and fresh tasting. A testament to the ingredients and the brewers. Such a great example of the style. Smooth aftertaste makes it easy to want more. Try this beer if you love stouts!"
"A good drinking stout but not something I would have more than two glasses of."
"M/D)Medium to full body, low carbonation. Nice, creamy texture. Very drinkable, but not quite sessionable. A very good dessert beer."
"Black pour with some light getting through on the edges, tan head with good retention and attractive lacing. Not the in your face aroma that I expected - some smoke, a pinch of dark chocolate and that's about it. Starts off with a small amount of carbonation and malt sweetness which slowly creeps along towards a slightly sour & bitter finish. You'll find the aroma elements mirror flavors on the palate. Medium body, moderate carbonation, minimal alcohol warmth. Nice Imperial Stout overall."
"This beer is good, but I'm not sold of hop centered stouts."
"D- definately could drink this all night. Nice balance of flavor and smooth on the lipslips"
"D: At just 8.1%ABV and the alcohol completely hidden, it isn't hard to plow through a bomber, but the heavy hop presence slows things down. I'm not a big fan of Stouts with hop bitterness (not to be confused with roast malt 'bitterness')."
"TICK!"
"I love Racer 5, Hop Rod, and Red Rocket to death, and was hoping for great things from Bear when it comes to an RIS. This was a bit of a letdown. This is not a bad beer by any means, but when I want an RIS, I want richness, some sweetness, some body. A decent brew, but I just cracked open a Ten Fidy, and comparing the two was like the difference between drinking a diet coke and a chocolate malt. (even accounting for the differences in ABV) Enough people really love this brew, and I'll give this a whirl again simply due to my love of this brewery, and hope that my tastebuds are simply off tonight."
"poured an impressive and thick head, full 1 1/2 inches out of the glass while holding firm. laced and retained well throughout. smells hoppy, woody and has a roasty/sweet quality as well. taste is at first quite hoppy, with near burned caramel malts and some chocolate. also getting a sour graininess. not a super aggressive stout for an imperial. got much sweeter as i forged on to finish the large bottle. almost too sweet. finishes fairly clean for the style and semi dry. mouthfeel is just ok, creamy, but just a little low on carbonation. full bodied enough, though flattish and not really that ""bite"" i was hoping for. drinkability is ok. nothing spectacular. many better imperial stouts out there, but this is also better than many."
"Real clean, super drinkable big porter/big stout. Highly recommended."
"Very nice Imperial Stout although not as big as others in the style, but this helps the drinkability as this goes down really nice."
"This brew pours a jet cola hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a two finger head and sporadic clingy lacing,the smell is quite nice with hints of mocha,smokey embers,charcoal and a light tinge of bourbon,it has a nice easy bodied nicely carbonated mouthfeel to it with tastes of blackberries,mocha,dark smokey malts,milky coffee an finishes with a dark fruit hoppy bitterness that rounds it out quite nicely,overall its a decent drop without being adventurous i mean its very easy to drink but there is no wow factor in there to make it truly memorable."
"D - At 8.1 abv, i was expecting more of a boozy effect, but other than the smell i'm unable to find the 8.1. Its very drinkable, and for this style i really appreciate it. I can easily enjoy this one on my own and not feel like i need to split it. Also, at around $4, you cant go wrong. Thanks Bear Republic for making and awesome, accessible beer as always."
"The body was far thinner than I look for in the style. Drinkability was decent, but that weird finish cost it a half point. Overall, a decent beer that's not really that far away from being great. Worth trying."
"Pours a deep pitch black color with a thin brown head and barely any lacing. Has some ruby hues when held to light. Smells of coffee and roasted malts. Tastes of coffee, chocolate, and tons of roasted malts. A little too much malt. Almost no hops here. Mouthfeel is thick and has very little carbonation. Drinkability is medium."
"high drinkability"
"Not your normal stout. Pretty big hops here make this an interesting departure from traditional stouts. If you like stouts and hop driven brews you should give this a go."
"D: this is a great imperial stout...loads of the roasted flavor I love with a big malty backbone. Great price too."
"Good beer but doesn't stand out as excellent. Drinks like a non-imperial stout. Very well done and evenly balanced. Tasty and easy to drink."
"O: Absolutely what I think an American Imperial Stout should be: hopped up. Though in my mind a notch below Old Rasputin, it's way up there on my list of favorite American Craft brews. Totally worth the $4-5 you see this for at most stores in the Midwest."
"D- Kind of on the lower ABV for a RIS, however this is very good and quite enjoyable for being on the lower spectrum of an RIS."
"Overall- Good beer, but to hoppy for my preferance* for an imperial stout. Borderline dark IPA. I would definitly drink this again and again, but not for the typical big stout qualities."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Fairly heavy and pretty smooth drinking overall. This beer is certainly worth a try for stout lovers. It is different and unique. Very nice effort."
"D: I used to this was the sweetest stout on the face of the planet. I can't imagine why because this was a very disciplined and well put together stout indeed. Also, what a bargain for only $4.99. I've never had a bad beer from Bear Republic."
"Drinkabilty - Its bold and strong enough, the 22oz is enough. One fantastic stout for its taste, smoothness, and boldness. Would love to try this oak or whiskey barrel aged, wow. Killer winter beer here."
"Frankly exactly what the style embodies. A robust, chocolaty, Coffee infused stout. An outstanding beer!"
"D: The beer is rather easy to drink compared to others in the style because any traces of alcohol are well hidden from the taste."
"This is the stout that got me into stouts. Very mellow compared to other stouts. A good session beer but at 8.1% you might forget you're drinking a beer since the alcohol is barely noticeable. A definite recommendation for anyone starting out in stouts. One of my favorite Bear Republic beers."
"D- Sits a bit heavy but that's expected from a big stout like this. I would like to put this away for a year to see how it develops."
"D - A very nice beer indeed. I'll try to get more."
"D: All around a great west coast stout. The perfect amount of subtle hop spice to give a kick and make it stand out. I returned to this beer after having a positive drinking experience before, and I was not disappointed. Recommended!"
"D: A deep, dark and delicious RIS from Bear Republic. The 8.1% ABV isn't even all that noticeable with such deep character and balance going on. Would pair nicely with roasted meats or just simply enjoyed on its own to bring the warmth back to your internal organs after being out in the snow in the winter."
"Just starting to try these stouts. This being my third I was really impressed with this beer. This is a good one for novices to start out with. Not too strong or weak. It pours black as night and leaves a nice head. I didnt detect an overwhelming dominance of malt, coffee, chocolate, or hops. Its balanced really well. Ill drink this one again."
"Sextremely drinkable. I'm going to be paying for this 8% later, but it will be well worth it. The only other ""hopped"" stout that I have had was the Black Sun Stout from Three Floyds. This kind of reminded me of that, except you don't taste the hops as much in this beer. Basically I'm trying to say that if you like that beer, try this one. And vice-versa."
"One of the better stouts."
"M/D: Nice body, it had a good creamy texture to it. However, seemed a little lacking compared to some of the RIS I have had, not bad...just not what I was expecting. Still a good beer worth trying."
"Poured a very dark brown with brown highlights that had a half finger of head and left somw frothy lacing sticking to the glass. Surprisingly the nose was quite hoppy alongside caramel, chocolate, slight coffee, and some roasty notes as well. Upfront on the palate it was also quite roasty with chococlate, slight hoppy, caramel, and coffee accents. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, slight astringent, and mild hop bitter bite. It drank good and drank the majority ghetto style straight out of the bottle."
"This is one of the most drinkable RIS's I've had. A solid drink in which I would gladly have again."
"Very smooth for a beer this big in ABV. Nice full body, but still ""thin"" in Guinness terms. Excellent beer, very drinkable and I will definitely go back to this one in the future."
"A fine example with the complexity so well layered the alcohol all, but disappears."
"D: Quite easy to drink; I could drink quite a bit of this, though the ABV is high enough that it wouldn't be a good idea."
"D - Easy drinker. Not sure if this should be considered a Russian Imperial Stout though."
"Pours a dark brown brew with a beiege medium crown. Full carbonation, thick body. No alchol scent present, sweet malts, roasted caramel with some pleasant cocoa hints. Starts you up with the roasted caramel going on to the sweet malts, then turning towards some chocolate and dark coffe at the aftertaste. Very refreshing, nice drinkabilty. A superb balanced brew. This RIS is my 3rd brew from the BR and so far the ones I've tried are top notch. This Big Bear B Stout aint the exception. Highly recommended for the RIS lovers."
"Pours black with red highlights around the edge of glass, with a thick and extremely persistent tan head. The aroma is Sweet and creamy, with Dark chocolate, espresso, and roasted malt. Really smooth and creamy, a little burnt caramel with a nice long finish, and a slight hop fade. Really a great stout with plenty of flavor, nice mouth feel and a lasting finish. Bear republic is 4 for 4 with great beers....next is the Brown ale."
"Good carbonation; light and creamy but I could have handled it a bit thicker."
"A solid RIS, almost a breakfast stout."
"D - Not one to drink more than a snifter or two for sure. I was very impressed with this beer, such a rich smokey brew for a nice cold day. God I gotta get more of it! I highly recommend this indulgent brew to anyone! It's worth stocking up for sure. Cheers!"
"Although BR is known for Racer 5, Hop Rod Rye, ect. This beer is not overly hopped or overly bitter, it's just right. I could drink this anytime, but of coarse, the winter season just adds to the experience. Top notch beer."
"D-Smooth and tasty. 8.1% abv is already low for the style, add in the fact that's well-hidden, and one of these bombers will disappear quickly."
"Pours solid midnight brown with big, foamy cloud-like head that stays with a lacing that splotches the glass in alluring patches. Caramel roast scent draws you in. Great balanced, sweet hops and malty smoothness hides the 8.1 ABV amazingly. Extremely drinkable, could be"
"An excellent hoppy stout. If you like your stouts with tons of hops you'll like this one."
"D- the ABV is hidden well...this is a real easy drinker. Great beer"
"D - Very drinkable for this style. Plenty of flavors but not stodgy about it. Good beer."
"- Overall this is a killer stout... I can see why it has the great grade it has. So smooth..."
"Cheers..."
"drinkable enough - though 1x bomber will be plenty."
"D-This is a very drinkable stout. I rated this as an American Stout per the brewer's website instead of a Russian Imperial Stout here. Not as rich and robust as an RIS, but a very fine American Stout."
"D: high - good drinking beer"
"D - Pretty good brew but isn't as big in body or flavor as I would hope for a RIS. However it does have an enjoyable hop presence. I would pick this up again if I was in the mood and the beer is really reasonably priced. However I would not go nuts trying to get this one."
"D - Solid stout, could easily sip on this for a while. Very flavorful, yet balanced, and an absolute steal at under five dollars for a 22."
"D - I could drink a beer like this repeatedly if it weren't for the 8% octane -the flavor hides it so well, but I tend to go for cask beers in succession that are slightly milder in strength. I don't think you could find many cask American Stouts that are easier on the palate for the abv -this is a truly quality cask brew, sad to see it go."
"D: A really nice stout, a easy sipper that hides the ABV very well. A brew that I could drink a few of. The complex flavors only develop as brew completely warms, making the complete drinking experience, just that, complete. This is a friendly bear of a stout."
"D - would do, but not as first choice."
"This was a very thin/watery brew, very light bodied for a stout. Drinkability is low because I just wasn't all that impressed. There were another three or four stouts on tap that night (one a Jackie O's Black Ryno) so I couldn't justify getting a second. Not bad, and I'd happily drink it if it were the only stout and that was what I was in the mood for. However, ultimately this one fell a little short for me."
"D- Awesome. Thick, but not filling. I could easily make this my late fall/winter session if it did not have the high ABV. I am thoroughly impressed and highly recommend this beer."
"goes down well, alcohol is integrated decently. pretty flavorful and well crafted."
"overall - dark flavor, but a west coast brew for sure due to the bigger hops. very good."
"D: Not too high ABV and goes down very smooth. I finished the bottle with ease and wished I had another."
"The mouth is wonderfully smooth and delicate. Great for the style. The flavors are mixed well and complement the scent. I get a little more char and burnt flavoring than expected. Some mild sweetness noted, but the bittering roasted quality is the main aspect. Pretty good beer. Not as great as expected, but I'd have more for sure."
"Overall, a good stout with some really solid flavors. Nothing here stand out too much though. Just a really solid offering thats definitely worth the money."
"Pours a deep, dark, near black. Cap of tan head, diminishing quickly but nice rings of lacing. Scent is of dark roasted coffee, roasted cocoa, roasted grains with a hint of char and smoke. Also present are some notes of dark carmel and dried dark fruit. Taste brings the heavy roast flavors of coffee, cocoa and grain, hints of char and smoke, but the taste is completely smooth. nice smooth carmel and dark dried fruit on the back end. Fuller side of medium bodied, smooth, not sticky and no linger flavors, slightly dry. A very nice RIS that doesnt go overboard like many extreme beers in the style."
"Poured from the bottle into my snifter. Great black appearance with a slight tan head that dissipated quickly to a nice crown. Wonderful aroma of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts. Bitterness is slightly present in taste with chocolate and coffee primary flavors. Great feel with ample carbonation that tickles. Really a good stout and very enjoyable taste and a great feel."
"Drinkability - Smooth finish with a fantastic taste ... it is way too easy to plow through several bombers. Though it is +8%, it is not very noticeable. A fantastic interpretation of the style; I will certainly be going back to the store for more. Simply put, this stout is a Big Teddy Bear ... strong in character with a soft and subtle character. Fantastic."
"M/D- medium bodied, low carbonation. easy drinkin stout. for me, did not live up to the hype i've heard about this beer."
"This is a wonderful stout. Black as night, fluffy tan head, lots of lacing. Smells of slight hops, roasted malts, hints of bitter chocolate and coffee. Taste is similar with a bit of hops with a deep roasted malt backbone, coffee, and chocolate. The only real complaint I have with this beer is that it is just too thin... I don't buy that this is an RIS...if this was just an American Stout, the thinner body would be suitable, but it's just not on an Imperial Stout. Regardless though, this is an amazing beer and should not be missed. It's great and very affordable considering the size and style of the beer."
"M-D: As stated in the taste, the flavors just explode once they touch the tip of your tongue. Its a good dark beer with an exhilerating taste that leaves you ready for the next sip!"
"Aroma and flavor are similar - primarily a strong amount of smokey/roasted malts with hints of molasses and caramel. Some bitterness and a slight twinge of booziness in the finish. The bitterness takes away some of the drinkability on this one for me, but nevertheless this is a nice stout."
"Would have again, but not seek it out."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is slightly thin, but very smooth and slightly creamy. Very drinkable stout which will be disappearing from the my glass far too quickly given the abv."
"Pours a thick black with a small amount of tan head that laces thickly around th etop of the glass. The aroma is an overwhelming amount of sweet malt with hints of caramel and toffee with a smaller amount of hops present in the nose. The taste isn't as syrupy sweet as I would have thought with a hefty amount of hop bitterness present, especially in the aftertaste. Well balanced and very easy to drink if a little thick. A great taste with very little hint of the large amount of alcohol present."
"Overall, Big Bear is a good stout but not a big one. I've enjoyed this bottle without a doubt but it's just a bit on the light side to really qualify as a great RIS. That said, it's a very drinkable and smooth beer and I would happily drink this again. This is the third offering from Bear Republic that I've had and they've never failed to impress me."
"Notes: I had higher hopes for this one, but it is still good, and really drinkable. The flavor is a little watered for me...I guess I am moving away from stouts in general. But at $5 a bomber, I'm sure I'll revisit this."
"D: Smell as outstanding. More drinkable that many of the style."
"Drinkability was excellent, as this was awesome and tasty.I really enjoyed this beer. Will definitely seek this out again and highly recommend it for any stout lover who likes IPA's."
"Pours a luscious opaque sable with a thick, frothy beige head - most inviting! Rich, oily aroma has tones of molasses, coffee and unsweetened chocolate. Flavor is malty with tones of coffee, molasses and licorice and just a hint of cinnamon. Texture is tingly and fairly smooth, quite pleasing. Worth a try."
"D: Mediocre at best, I'm not sure why this one is so beloved. Complexity is there as well as a nice, hoppy stout aroma, but the mouthfeel leaves something to be desired and as a result, doesn't allow the flavors to meld quite right. I'd have this one again to give it another shot, but as it is, there are better RISs out there."
"Hard to find anything to fault in this beer. Maybe my new favorite stout."
"d - A decent RIS. It smelled very good but wasn't the biggest fan of the bitterness in the taste. Willing to try again."
"Really enjoyable overall, the snifter went great with my food and went down easy, even after drinking so much at DLD the day before this was a standout beer. Worth the trip, but I could do with less rain next time!"
"Pours an opaque black with red around the edges, medium tan head, good lacing on the glass. Roasted malts are right at the front of the nose, some hop presence is noticeable behind, with a sweet fruity aroma as well. Taste is dark fruits, roasted malt, chocolate and coffee, like a souped up version of their Tribute Brown ale. Nice and hoppy, with some fruitiness near the end."
"This pours practically black, with a nice dark brown head on it! The initial smell is that of lightly smoked chocolate! A very interesting nose on this one. As you sip this beer you primarily taste the smoked chocolate and coffee with a nice barley finish. The mouth feel is a little more carbonated then i would prefer...but that is probably because all the stouts I have been drinking have been years past vintages or barrel aged brews. Over all this is a great beer to finish off the evening with. Pick up a bottle if you see one or order a pint if possible! Give this one a solid 4.5 as well!"
"The drinkability is good, but if you don't like hops in your stouts, this thing could get old after a while. That will certainly NOT be the case for me, as I can't seem to put this thing down, but I could see how some may see it as a bit overwhelming. Either way, Big Bear looks good, smells good, and tastes good and I'm loving every sip of it. Another solid brew from Bear Republic."
"Has a light to medium bodied mouthfeel with too much carbonation. Has a sticky feel to it, with a bitter burnt aftertaste. It is a decent beer, but not even close to being my favorite Russian Imperial Stout."
"D- A really different RIS, not really what I expected, but still a nice beer."
"The floral profile is a bit odd for a stout. It's nice, but it doesn't necessarily fit what I expected from a stout. I like it anyway though."
"Notes: It's nice, although I feel it could do with a broader range. And I'm ambivalent about the hop, floral profile... On the one had it is a touch too assertive for the stout, on the other those touches of perfume give it a rather special range."
"D: Very drinkable, this is a rich velvety full flavored and full bodied beer that is a joy to drink."
"Overall, great beer, I definitely recommend it to any fan of the dark brew family. Another awesome offering from the bear republic brewing company which has yet to let me down in terms of quality beer. I mean, it's big on flavor, bear of a smell, black on sight, with the mouthfeel of a stout...Big Bear Black Stout, yes I do believe it fits!"
"Pours, big, black, and bearish. Enormous beige head rests up top. The head here takes a while to calm down. Stays great-looking the whole time, you barely see the top of the beer the entire time. Leaves crazy thick lacing. Smell is a bit weak (gets a bit stronger once the head shrinks a bit), chocolate, caramel and a bit of dark fruit. Also a strange smell that resembles old leather? This stout isn't quite as ""hefty"" as I remember. Definitely much easier to drink and watery than your average RIS. Subdued tastes of roastiness and light chocolate sweetness combined with some hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is a bit too watery for me and the tastes don't really stand out except for the amount of hops which is unusual in a stout. The highlight here is drinkability, one of the easiest-drinking RIS's I've had, good taste, no alcohol taste whatsoever and good price."
"Notes: A very drinkable stout that delivers a good punch and satisfies that craving for a complex and flavorful stout."
"A nice imperial stout, but not my favourite. Still enjoyable to try."
"Drinkability was good. No signs of ABV and a nice balance of flavors."
"Pours very dark, opaque, with a chocolatey colored mocha head that laces every glass. Smell is malty/chocolate/lightly of dark fruits/and some hops. Taste and mouthfeel are good. Malty overhaul with some same notes as the smells, mostly chocolaty/biscuity/malty with a touch of hops. Mouthfeel is halfway between medium-full bodied and coats the mouth without being overwhelmed. Drinkability is great for a stout. One that I have loved since the first taste."
"So easy to drink for an IS. The hopping makes this a refreshing version. At $4.99 for a bomber, it's hard to think of a better deal for this style. It's not outstanding, but it is absolutely solid."
"D: Absolutely drinkable. Alcohol is very subtle, though obviously, the ABV is a bit lower than most of the Russian style. All the flavors meld well together, and I'm a huge fan of the vanilla."
"Second review: Had it on tap at Hollingshead. And while I'm mentioning that, if you are a Packers fan, and in the OC, and like beer, you MUST go here during a game. Opener, even better. Anyways, solid, solid stuff."
"The aroma of hops was the first thing I noticed about this brew. Yes it from the west coast. It sort of reminded me of a great Divide is a lot of ways in the flavor department .It had a medium feel in my mouth with good carbonation. A easy drinking stout not bad at all and for the price a good beer."
"22oz bottle $5, not bad. Color was pitch black, looks pretty standard for the style. Smells nice, roasty. Easygoing taste, rich but not cloying, no alcohol burn but a good warming in the stomach. This is not my favorite stout but it is very well done and a great value for the price. Very easy to drink the whole bottle myself."
"Very drinkable with good (not great) flavors that hide the 8.1% ABV well. Will buy this one again!"
"I love this beer. While Yeti is still king, this bear is a scrapper and ready to challenge for the throne. Whatever the heck that means!"
"Drinkability - Extremely drinkable for a stout"
"Stouts are my favorite beer, but when they resemble too much bitterness, it kills it for me. This one flirted with that line. At first, I picked up a licorice or bitter chocolate, followed by hoppy bitterness that was strong and lingered for a few minutes. There wasn't much sweetness to compliment the bitterness. Medium to thin(for a stout) mouthfeel. Crisp and carbonated, another opposite of great stouts. Booze was pretty well hidden while cold, became more pronounced as it warmed up to room temp."
"D: Another big, impressive beer from Bear Republic. A robustly hoppy, fruity, brown-sugary stout that drinks like a liquid brownie. A wonderful blend of chocolate, roasted malts, and hop flavors. Also a relative steal for $4.50."
"Overall a very good version of the style. It isn't up there with the very best but it's certainly a worthy addition to the Bear Republic lineup. I'll be sure to pick up more next time I see it on the shelves."
"I love the lower level of alcohol in this compared to others in the style, which makes it exceptionally drinkable, almost dangerously so considering this is still far from a session pint. A very well-crafted beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and good. Alcohol is well hidden with the flavors. Very nice for a cold evening."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a tulip glass. No freshness information on the bottle. Pours a jet black, with a one finger caramel head. Recedes quickly, minimal lacing and retention. Roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee notes all blend together. The taste is incredibly balanced, good amount of malt vs hops. The finish turns just a touch bitter, very well done. I wish the mouthfeel were just a touch thicker, but the medium carbonation is spot on, IMO. As a fan of rich stouts, I won't have a problem finishing this bottle at all. This beer was also a great value, definately one that will stay in my regular rotation."
"D: A simple and straightforward RIS, the Big Bear Black Stout's drinkability is top notch. Another high quality offering from a consistently great brewery."
"D Not really that good. This remains a big beer with the roasted malt/bitter hops bigness and the elevated ABV. I will finish the 22 ounces but would not consider reaching for a second one. I probably should have shared this with someone else. 2.0"
"Strong floral hop aroma that overpowers anything else that may be in there. Beautiful obsidian color with a thick, rocky brown head that last beyond the final drop. Flavor of sweet caramel, roasted malt, bitter chocolate, and a slight alcohol tinge. Full bodied with soft carbonation and a long, bitter finish. This is a fantastic stout that's dangerous in its smoothness and high alcohol."
"D: One of the easiest and smoothest drinking imperial stouts I have ever had, simply delicious."
"This one is nicely drinkable. The 8.10%abv is well-hidden, but I have a feeling that it would sneak up on you, rather easily. It's big on the roastiness, so if that isn't your thing, then stay away."
"It's a decent stout, and a great value for the money. But there are plenty of better tasting stouts out there."
"D: Russian Imperial Stouts are definitely stronger than the American Style Stouts I'm used to, but I still wish a had a glass large enough to pour the entire 650ml bottle into. Not a session beer for me, personally, but I wouldn't hesitate to split a bottle with friends."
"Overall, Amazing! This is not a Russian Imperial Stout. This beer is wholly American. The roasted malts are done to perfection and followed by crisp sprucey hops that can only be American. Great beer for the price(22 oz. bomber: $4.95), flavors, ABV, and drinkability!"
"pours a completely black color with a big brown head, the smell is incredible, has a great malt aroma to it and is reminiscent of dark chocolate. taste is really awesome, had a full body and has a phenomenal roasted malt flavor, it really is a great beer. mouthfeel is full and rich and syrupy, just an awesome beer."
"M/D: Smooth, but thin. Fairly high carbonation, and very resinous on the tongue. The hops add a nice prickle. The alcohol is completely hidden, and I had two of these before I realized I was buzzed, so be careful with this one. Bear Republic does it again!"
"M/D: Surprisingly dry finish is the most striking characteristic. The malts move from sticky to dry as the flavor develops. The finish is smooth but not creamy. There is a lot going on in this beer, and it isn't too heavy or overwhelming. It is very enjoyable and well crafted, with a perfect balance of flavors."
"Notes: A multidimensional beer that has so much going for it. And, one of the finest values in beer that I've seen. Fabulous!"
"Drinks very well on a cold night."
"I'll swear allegiance to the Bear Republic. This West Coast brewery often goes overlooked in the discussion of great American micros and it's a wonder to me why that is; I can think of few breweries that offer a more reliable, first-rate lineup of regular releases than Bear Republic. Big Bear Black is one species you should most certainly hunt down."
"D- This was a tasty beer and best enjoyed when not rushed."
"D: A very good RIS and drinkable for what it is."
"22oz bomber pours jet black. Smells of roasted malts and a hint of coffee. The taste is suprisingly sweet up front compared to other imperial stouts I have had. Has that roasted malt taste, with a hint of coffee, but a nice blend of hops mixed in too. Very interesting. Quite easy to drink and the abv% is well hidden. Kinda wishing I picked up a second bomber of this. Pretty damn good beer."
"Drinkability is pretty nice. It goes down nice and smooth and has a pretty good flavor. All in all one of the better examples of the style I've had but not the best but I certainly wouldn't mind having it again."
"D - Extremely drinkable. The really strong aftertaste detracts, but it's quite tasty."
"Drinkability. Meh, this is the last one I'm having of these. At least it was just $5 for a 22 oz bottle."
"Taste is very strong and coffee with a lot of roasty bitter ness. Quite tasty but it's a bit watery, still very drinkable."
"The taste follows suit. The beer is thick, creamy, nourishing, but it has a bit too much ABV presence. There are some charred notes, in addition to the chocolates and roasted dark malts. The warming alcohol and ABV just diminishes what could have been a better imperial stout. The beer is thick on the tongue, full bodied, and there is some ABV throatiness and charred remains in the aftertaste."
" ~ This is a solid stout. I'm not sure if I've ever had a Russian Imperial Stout before but I must say, I'm impressed. Thanks Mike and Ranee."
"Easy to drink. Big bomber went down super-fast. The best thing about this was that the bomber was just under $6.00. How can you miss? Terrific."
"The mouthfeel is full and creamy. Leaves a pleasant roasted bitterness on the tongue."
"Dr. This one goes down way way too easy."
"D. Way drinkable. This bomber went down faster than most other high abv stouts."
"This beer came to about $5 and it was totally worth it. I loved the taste it is the epitome of a Black Stout, B-E-A-utiful."
"Just a big great stout."
"Bear Republic has skyrocketed up my personal brewery rankings, and this one might but them at number one. I have yet to try a Bear Republic beer that isn't fantastic, and with this entry into my favorite style, they have come out again on top. Delicious chocolate smell with a fine crisp finish, this beer comes on strong but doesn't make the mistake of some of other stouts of being overbearing, particularly in aftertaste. The beer is dark and fairly pungent, and you can hold it on your pallet and imbibe with a feeling of delight, followed instantaneously thereafter the thirst for another sip."
"Would only have one of these bad boys in a sitting."
"This is a very nice stout; I only wish I could have it more often."
"Overall, a great beer. I would certainly get this again."
"Medium bodied with a smooth and creamy feel. An all-around great RIS. Once again, B-R delivers another winner. This is one I know I'll be enjoying again soon."
"I can't believe it took me this long to try this bear, I had paid more attention to the Hop Rod and Racer 5. The appearance is impressive, inky black with a tan head that reduces quickly. The smell is espresso, dried fruit, and licorice. The taste is the same, with a little dark chocolate and raspberry. The mouthfeel is silky and satisfying. Great drinkability, for as long as you can last."
"D: A rock solid brew though I'm not sure if it wouldn't be better classified as a Double Stout rather than an RIS. Good to see that Bear Republic has got a great width of expertise beyond just hoppy brews, an impressive brewery. This is nice sipping beer for a long autumn night, enjoy it as such. It might be just short of a must try, but this is pretty solid brew and one most BA's would enjoy."
"Overall, a solid offering. Just lacked a little here and there, enough to make a difference in the end. Still, for the price this is definitely recommended."
"First A+ I've ever given!!Black colored beer with a rich creamy head.Aroma is rich chocolate.Taste is cream,chocolate and sweetened coffee.After over 300 beers I've finally found the perfect brew!!Like swallowing liquid silk.Great job by Bear Republic,this is something to be truly proud of!"
"The hop aromas, flavors, and balance against the malt all suggest a California or at least ""west coast"" signature take on the RIS. Not quite what I look for in a stout, but I can understand someone rating this very highly if their tastes lean more in this direction."
"Conclusion: This mouthfeel and basic flavors of this are awesome; it's bittersweet and highly drinkable as well. The only real problem here is that there doesn't appear to be a ton of depth here; what's here is really tasty, it's just not as complex as a lot of imperial stouts are."
"I expect more from Bear Republic. This Impy lacked the complexity and intrigue necessary for a good RIS and comes off as a cheap and touristy. Boo."
"D: Very drinkable for a Russian stout, but too strong to make a session out of the experience."
"Dark ebony, thin mocha head, soapy lacing. Nose-chalky mocha, stewed fruit, hops. Taste- cola, dry burnt roast, sweet milk chocolate and dark fruit. Finish- dry from roast and bittering hops. Little heat detected. Very drinkable. classic american impy."
"Overall, this was very disappointing, even for only spending just under $5.00 on a bomber. I was expecting much more. I wish I had of spent a couple more dollars and tried something else. Even in its price range this doesn't compare to other RISs such as Storm King and Old Rasputin, which blow this away. I rarely say this, but I do not recommend this RIS unless you are trying to branch out into the style and do not want something too overpowering."
"Opaque and black in color with a red/brown head. Head was very thick with nice retention. Very inviting. Aroma was obvious, but not jumping out of the glass. Nice balance of bready and roasted malt notes. Flavor began with a nice roasted malt and included notes of coffee and caramel. This sweetness was nicely balanced by some hop bitterness in the finish, which was not overpowering and did not linger. Body was medium to full with medium carbonation and very smooth. Overall, while this beer did not seem to have anything unique about it, it is solid with a wonderfully balanced flavor and nice mouthfeel. A nice representation of the style, which I will definitely have again."
"Drinkability- One is enough at 8%, but its very tasty."
"Poured black with a modest brown head that quickly dissipated to the barest of collars. The aroma was understated, to me, chocolate and coffee. The taste came through with bitter, dark chocolate dominating and coffee in the background. This changed as Black Bear warmed, to a less bitter chocolate and more coffee, I did like the warm up. I read one BA's observation that Black Bear was best served at room temperature, I will try that. Feel was rich, creamy and satisfying, full bodied. Drinkability was above average, but remember to respect beer, it is an 8.10 ABV."
"D- Really hits the spot at the right temperature and the right time of day."
"drinkability - Nice drinking, stout. Was decent, above average. Worth a try."
"D: This beer is very drinkable and tolerable. Altogether a very well made Imp stout. I am thoroughly enjoying this one."
"I'm afraid to say that this beer could just lose itself into the burgeoning Impy Stout market. It needs perhaps a recipe tweak to make it a really stand-out A+ stout."
"This is phenomenally smooth beer, despite the strong hop presence."
"Poured from the bottle to a pint glass. Pours black with dark red highlights if held up to the light. With the pour comes a nice big light tan head. The head quickly retracts to about a one finger head that is nice and rocky and frothy and leaves great lacing down the glass. The smell is what I was expecting as it's an Imperial Stout, chocolate, coffee, roasted malts. The chocolate stands out the most to me in the smell. Despite the chocolate being upfront in the smell the coffee dominates the taste. The chocolate is still there and the roasted flavor is pretty apparent. Theres also a bit of a nut taste in there. Pretty good stuff. Mouthfeel is kind of thin and creamy, not bad but I was hoping for something a bit thicker, still not bad. Drinkabilty is good. Not to high of an ABV but not something I would drink all night, still easily drinkable. Overall a good stout for a cheap price. I think I paid under $4 for a bomber so not bad. I'll pick it up again."
"Drinkability: As other reviews have stated, the 8.1% ABV is deceiving. The light mouthfeel combined with the incredible sweetness do wonders to mask the high ABV. The slight scent isn't close to enough to be off-putting, and the other properties of the beer more than make up the difference. This is definitely an RIS that will become a winter (and sometimes summer if it is cool enough) staple in this house for years to come."
"Drinkability: This is a sipping stout with lots of complex roasted malt and hop flavor so that one serving at a time is fine, but it is definitely a beer to return to again and again."
"Pours black with a small/medium tan head. Nice lacing. Aroma is very nice hops with roasted malt. Very nice and balanced smell. Taste is big roasted malt with coffee notes. Significant hops in the finish add some freshness with a touch of citrus. Bitterness from roasted malt and hops. Full bodied but not too heavy. Very balanced and drinkable, more so than many other imperial stouts. Overall this is a very nice imperial stout."
"22oz. Pours black with a tall, pillowy tan head that holds decent retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. Aromas are roasted malts and coffee, with some dark chocolate hints. Mouth-feel is medium bodied and coats the palate well. Tastes are similar to aromas - very roasted and robust - bittersweet chocolate, black coffee, and molasses. Also some mild ripened dark fruity esters, but nothing overwhelming. Alcohol is completely concealed. It's somewhat sweet, but finishes nicely balanced with the roasted malts providing some bitterness with the hops. Overall, solid recommendation for the style. It's nothing outrageous, but very satisfying."
"It's the second beer from Bear Republic I've tried and both are excellent."
"Poured a nice, opaque black with a coca-cola esque head. Aroma is pretty awesome: roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and caramel. The taste is even better: chocolate cake, coffee notes, sweetens towards the caramel at the end and finishes with a wonderfully balanced hoppy bitterness. Also, some slight bits of nuttiness and maybe some dark fruit. This is good stuff! Mouthfeel is full-bodied, wholesome and hearty, yet deliciously smooth. For the style, this is very drinkable -"
"This is a treat. Not too sweet like some stouts, this Big Bear Black Stout is right on the money of what a solid stout should be. No gimmicks. This is a beer lover's brew."
"D - ABV isn't as high for a RIS but still up there. Good choice though."
"Pours a jet black, with ruby highlights when light is shone through. Smell is of coffee and sweet malt. Taste is surprisingly hoppy, nice piney, earthy hoppyness, with solid malt backbone. Roasted bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is rich, nice, low carbonation levels. Drinkability is quite good. A good pick from Bear Republic."
"Pours opaque black with a light tan head that sticks around and leaves moderate lace on the glass. The smell... oh my goodness, does it get much better than this? Chocolate, coffee, berries, molasses, vanilla, lots of roasted malt, obviously, and a vague hint of the 8.1% ABV. All are present on the tongue along with a bitter finish. A very light and delicate mouthfeel for such a big beer. This is a very well made stout. I only knocked half a point off the drinkability because of the ABV - I'll always do that for relatively high-alcohol beers, no matter how good they might be, because they're not for knocking back all evening."
"D: The big bitterness in this one makes it a bit of a slow go for me, but it is by no means a struggle."
"Thanks again, Russ."
"This is one tasty, easy drinking RIS."
"This is a drinkable RIS. It's stronger on the hop & roasted malt bitterness than a lot of stouts but still really good."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The stout appears a deep dark brown color with at least two fingers of lingering dark ecru foam. The head leaves a decent lace on the glass in it's wake. A great looking pour. tastes and smells of rich deep roasted grains, highly caramelized malt, medium roasted coffee, floral, earthy hops, a touch of citrus, notes of bittersweet cocoa. Bordering on full bodied for the style with adequate carbonation. Tasty and still sort of cheap."
"Pours thick black, like a typical American Stout. A bit of lacing, nothing to write home about. Not much on the nose either, more hops than anything. A bit of dark malt. Taste... well, this tastes more to me like a dark IPA than a RIS. The hops prevail here. Not deep, dry rich hops, but pretty bitter kind of wet hops. Not too impressive to me. The dark malt tastes a back sweet, and the roastiness and sweetness takes a back seat. When drinking this I figured it to be a standard American Stout. It lacks the gravitas it needs to be a big rich RIS. It is nice and creamy though, so mouthfeel is good. Drinkability suffers because of the bitterness. Overall, next time I will pass on this one."
"Flavors and basic appeal is also somewhat restrained. The body and flavors are not complex and are light simple malt/stone fruit but not very big and not very assertive and certainly not real complex. This is a basic ""ok"" drink. It was a treat to try the 2006 in 2009 but not something I'd go out of my way for again. All in all a bit thin in all respects. Not what you would expect in a ""quality"" craft stout."
"Bomber courtesy of washburnkid. Thanks for the extra, Judy! Pours a dark brown color, almost black in the glass, bright ruby red highlights when held up to the sun. Very nice roasty smell, plenty of chocolate and light coffee caramel notes. Taste is full on chocolate and heavily caramelized sugar. Some bitter roasted coffee notes are on the back end. Creamy, silky, 8% is completely hidden. I actually haven't been feeling the best today (not sick, just not feeling right), so it was tough to finish the whole bottle, but it was very delicious and was an awesome extra."
"Not a bad beer, but not more of a chocolate stout than an Impy, and for that, I'll take Rogue."
"overall a very nice stout."
"I'm not giving this great scores across the board even though I really enjoyed drinking it. Still, it's not a stout (like the bottle says) or an RIS (like this site says). No way. My biggest beef with it is the color/opacity. It's a really deep and dark amber. And not opaque. I mean, with ""Black Stout"" in the name I'm waiting for something that's really black. No chance. I hold my glass up to the light and I see color through it. Besides, the beer is dark reddish brown. Not black. Low head. Big IPA nose. Big old ale taste - tons of smoother, sweeter dark malts. Caramel. Hints of chocolate and coffee (but only hints). Alas, with a thin and watery mouthfeel. More like a normal stout, I suppose. But with that big sweet flavor and all of those hops (which I didn't mention but which are everywhere) I expect more from this one."
"Hmm, it doesn't seem like much but it's drinkable enough to where you should give it a try. It's a basic, but well-done RIS."
"D: This strikes me as a slightly lower-octane version of Old Raspy. If you like that beer, you'll almost certainly like this one."
"D- This really is an easy drinking beer. Alcohol is hidden well."
"D- The 8% is hidden well. This is a great stout but that dryness and bitterness is overbearing."
"d: Not as rich as others in the style, but not a task to drink as some are. With so many getting bigger and bigger, it is great to experience an easier drinking, but still very enjoyable Russian Imperial Stout."
"overall i was disappointed in this offering from bear republic since they put out good ipa (racer5 hop rod) but some breweries cant do every style"
"You can't beat a beer like this for the price!"
"MF&D - Velvety smooth. Can a R.I.S. be a session beer? I think it can! This is a must try beer!"
"Very good beer. If there was such a thing as a session RIS, this would be it. Another winner from Bear Republic, I need to start delving deeper into their catalog."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very dark dark opaque brown with a off white 1 finger head. Head clung to the side very well and lasted about 5 minutes. Smell was a bit of pina coloda smoothness with strong coffee aroma, and bits of chocolate. Taste was clean, slightly sweet, a touch of milkyness, with some bitter oatmeal bread. Over time, the flavor developed a very strong dark chocolate taste. Felt very good in the mouth, coated extremely well with the right amount of carbonation. Very pleasant to drink, ABV hit a bit fast."
"Overall Impression: Mellow. The beer is well balanced and the flavors are lighter that I would expect for a Russian Imperial stout. The 22 ounces went down a quickly and easily."
"Overall, the beer was good and I would definitely buy another; however, for the ratings this beer has received, I was a little disappointed."
"Good brew though."
"Drinkability - Dangerously high. I do not detect alcohol flavor at all. This is smooth, deceptively non-alcoholic tasting, and possesses a warming quality that would be most welcome in winter. If there's such a thing as a sessionable RIS, this is it. I ordinarily split my bombers with a friend, but I ended up polishing this bad boy off myself while my buddy sipped on some Stone RIS from the DLD haul they brought."
"Pours black with nice yeasty residue. Head isn't as thick and rich as expected and doesn't last too long. Smell is great: rich, roasted, malty and chocolaty. Taste is smokey roasted grains and chocolate with a slight hoppy after bite. Mouthfeel is very disappointing thin,thin, thin. I really expected it to be thicker. Goes down pretty well, but I wouldn't make a session of of this. Pretty good beer from Bear Republic."
"D: average, it's hard to get good drinkability in such a big beer, so average to me is good."
"D: Highly drinkable. Good all around stout. Very, very highly recommended to any hophead who is looking into branching out into RIS's."
"Another standout from Bear Republic. They are slowly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"D: Very drinkable for a RIS, but not at the very top of my list."
"D = It drinks very well. At just over $4, I could put too many of these down in a sitting."
"i am very impressed with this beer. i am not a huge stout fan but i drank this one like it was oxygen! the taste is smooth and the mouthfeel isnt too heavy (one of the problems i feel with most stouts) but isnt light either. it pours a consistent black with a light head. the price is right and it is a must try. not much else to say."
"I must admit, I'm actually a little disappointed with this one. While still a *good* stout, I personally don't feel it is a *great* stout. Here's why: I wouldn't want to wash down a big bite off of a Snikers bar with a bottle of grapefruit juice, and I don't like stouts that have these big chocolate and coffee flavours in their malt profiles that use Cascade and Centennial hops for the same reason. I don't care for *fresh* Old Rasputin or Yeti, and I find that this is very similar. Nice, super dark body with beige coloured head. Nice lacing. Mouthfeel is heavy, almost oily, as it should be. But I simply cannot *truly* enjoy a big, bold stout with this kind of hoppiness. Sorry guys. A sturdy, very well crafted stout that simply isn't for me, personally."
"Thick in texture with a bitter, oily finish. The dark malt and dark fruit flavors are there but the Californication is heavy, maybe the hoppiest stout I can remember having. Tasty and different but not my favorite RIS."
"The aroma is sweet with toasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and a small amount of hops. The appearance is almost black with a large head. The flavor is hoppier than the aroma but is dominated by the same elements from the aroma. The palate is a bit thin. Overall a drinkable beer that is to style but is nothing special."
"Drinkability- This thing has sat way over a year and it still has a nice hop bite. It must be close to a Black IPA fresh. The 8% is nowhere to be found either. Just a solid solid Stout that everyone must try."
"Overall, wow, this is a pretty darn good RIS, would like to do a blind or at least side by side tasting with this and Old Rasputin for comparison though."
"Great beer."
"Quite a tasty american impy stout, reminds me very much of Old Rasputin with the citrus hops, smooth roast, and reasonable body/alcohol. I don't have anything bad to say, and the hopping is really well done, but it just doesn't have a whole lot of depth, so I can't justify a really high rating. Probably not an entry level beer, but quite approachable for someone ready to take the next step."
"Overall - One would not know the ABV was so high in the beer. I really like this style and this is one of the better ones, especially for a bottle. I will definitely buy this again."
"D: very enjoyable and accessible for an 8% beer. Commendable craftsmanship if that's their goal...but nothing special."
"D: This beer has an incredible balance. It doesn't overwhelm with coffee malts, and has a warm (but not too boozy) character about it as it warms. A stout for a hophead, perhaps? I look forward to trying this beer on tap someday."
"Not my favorite R.I.S., but definitely a recommendable, enjoyable, solid, well-made stout. One of very, very few robust beers that I'd ever say this about, but it might fare even better barrel-aged."
"Pours a very black body, brownish on the edges. Tan head, big bubbles, lastingish. Hoppy alcoholy aroma, little dark malts like coffee. Alcohol off the first sip, watery. Nuttiness & some coffee. Sweet, almost like a sweet stout."
"Many times Russian Imperial Stouts can be cloying or terribly unbalanced. This is not the case with the Big Bear, as Bear Republic, who don't seem to be able to do any wrong, have made another near-perfect brew."
"Dark and dry. A slow drinker."
"Pours a dark black color. One and one half inch head of a dark tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, good hops aroma, slight alcohol, and slight roasted malt. Fits the style of a Russian Imperial Stout. Mouth feel is very smooth, slightly thick, and has an average carbonation. Tastes of slight roasted malt, then hops come through nicely, then sweet malt, some alcohol throughout, and the finish is a blend of sweet and roasted malt. Very refreshing and easy to drink RIS. This is definitely worth a try."
"Pours a thick, black body with one-finger tan head that leaves lace ring around the glass. Mostly roasted malts. some toasted, in the smell along with caramel and hints of coffee and something else (molasses, honey?). Man this is a real smooth and creamy beer, and for a RIS w/ 8% alcohol they hid the alcohol well and were able to to still balance it between caramel and some minor cocoa w/ roasted and coffee malts for a great blend and a dry finish. Even has a minor citric hopbite on the backend as well. A great sipper that's dangerous b/c I could drink it all night."
"The mouthfeel is nice, perfect amount of carbonation and it is just heavy enough to make this a solid beer to cap your night off with. I highly recommend it."
"The body is moderate and would like a bit more depth for a 8+ beer. Some creamy notes up front and astringent notes on the back end. Carbonation is a bit light but ok. Overall a good beer with some minor problems but very nice to drink."
"Very VERY drinkable."
"A tasty and not overpowering imperial stout, not too big for a bomber."
"D: not a bad showing and hop fans will dig this in a stout. Has nice finish and maintains a rich flavorful body"
"Drinkability: This is a beer I could get used to having around for when I'm in the mood for a RIS, and at a very good price."
"Drinkability: Well, at first I wasn't won over by this beer. Don't get me wrong, it had nothing wrong with it, but based on the reviews I guess I was expecting more. I took my time drinking it and glad I did. This is a stout that should be allowed to warm over the course of consumption. The flavors really open up and there is actually some complexity that I believe would be lost if you were to skip this (vital) step. Great, affordable, accessible beer that I will definitely be keeping in frequent rotation at home."
"Best Russian Imperial Stout I have ever had. So smooth you would never notice the 8.1% abv."
"Overall: Great imperial stout....I'm really enjoying this. the flavours are all I expect in a strong stout. Typical Bear Republic hoppiness and great smooth chocolaty maltiness."
"Overall: The mouth feel is slightly carbonated and the body is medium full. The finish is medium and a last for a few moments on the palate. This a very nicely balanced RIS, sadly it is not as deep, complex and full body like a great RIS. Not to be sad on this, this brew is not bad but really really good. Up their with the great. This beer is complex rich but not as full of a body as I would have like to see. A really good beer none the less."
"Hides the ABV really well. This is really nice stout, not a big body but somewhere in the middle - right where at some point you forget you're drinking a big beer and regret it later. Maybe a bit too heavy on the bitterness without some other flavors to balance it out, but overall - good beer!"
"The Big Bear pours thick and dark, you can almost see the thickness in the body as you pour it from the bottle. With a semi gentle pour i got about 1-2 fingers of latte colored head that receded to a nice surface film. The aroma is very clean, the main scent is of malts and light hops, perhaps a hint of coffee. The flavor is very bold, a lot more hops up front than you typically find in a russian imperial, but a welcome flavor for sure. Continuing the glass you get everything from chocolate to currant and a bitter sweetness. The mouthfeel is a little on the bitter side, but this is probably the only negative thing I can say. I am going to be bummed when this bottle is done, this has just vaulted way near the top of my list of favorite imperial stouts."
"D: Supposed to be 8+% ABV? Doesn't taste like it, after this bottle it may feel like it."
"Dense two finger head which bursts into large popping bubbles across the top, leaves a good lacing down the glass sides. As one would expect from the name, pure black in color with only the smallest suggestion of orange around the outside. The nose is actually somewhat lowkey, doesn't force the coffee bean, carob, toffee on you and leaves sufficient room in your nostrils for things to move about, delivers green grape, red cherry fruit scents, whatever orange citrus might be there mostly drowned out, overall clean over complex. Medium-bodied, same demeanor in the mouth, presents suave coffee, dark chocolate, toffee and licorice nuances without any bitter or toasted archness. Allowing for this, the hops do create an erect gait and contribute to a dry mouth feel. Less fruit here and more dried fig or golden raisin. Can't find fault with the carbonation level. Tapers off at the end, not greatly, yet enough to get you reaching prematurely for a replenishing next sip. I suppose it's a question of expectations of this beer style versus intentional brewery stylistic expression."
"Overall: A solid and delicious RIS. Although not my favorite, I will definitely buy more."
"Like syrup but without feeling like molasses. All in all a very solid, one of the easier RIS out there in terms of covering the alcohol. Feel but did not taste."
"Notes: In case you haven't noticed yet, I love Big Bear Black Stout. It's a deeply roasted, powerful stout that'll satisfy your sweet tooth while providing all of us hop-heads with our bitterness fix. It's your all-in-one dealer! Another great beer from Bear Republic. Highly recommended"
"Drinkability- If the bottle didn't say 8.1 ABV I'd think it was 5. Smooth and very dangerously drinkable for the style."
"I probably would skip this one again, but it was interesting to try this time."
"great drinkability for an imperial stout!"
"poured this bomber into a stout pint glass where it threw up a head that overwhelmed the pour - tight and meringue like - the color here was a coffee brown with with a lot of particulate matter visible - don't know what's up with that but it still tasted real good -i'll need to get hold of another to see the sediment/particulate re-occurs"
"Pours black into a stone RIS glass with substantial head that lingers and eventually fades to a lace that lasts throughout. Smell is thick, roasted malts and hops. Slight alcohol finish. Taste is toffee, burnt malt, and lots of coffee. Strong hops and light alcohol finish. Great, full beer."
"D - This is a great RIS. A little more on the hoppy side, but it is very enjoyable nonetheless."
"Drinkability is good. This isn't my favorite stout but it is good. I could drink this paired with some nice barbecue."
"22 0z bomber. Black pour with a nice dark tan frothy head, which lasted the entire mug. Some light lacing. Roasty aromas of coffe and malt, some earthy hops. Dark chocolate and heavily roasted/burnt malt, finished rather clean. Quite drinkable. Somewhere between a RIS and a dry stout. A bit too dry to me, which is saying something because I enjoy a dry stout, but still good."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bottle..Pours a deep black with a creamy light tan head that sustained and left some lacing. Aroma was a mix of citrus hops followed by a nice roasty/chocolate malt balance. Really liked how the hops and roast came together in the nose on this one. Flavor of cocoa, roasty, coffee, lingering hop bitterness, some caramel."
"Poured a very dark brown with red on the edges of the glass when help up to light. Head was tan that didn't stick around long. Smell was surprisingly hoppy. I was expecting a stronger malt aroma which was overshadowed in my opinion by the hops. Taste was also hoppy and bitter. It wasn't the bitterness I was anticipating or wanting. Tastes sweet with a bitter finish with modest carbonation. This was not as enjoyable as I was expecting and I won't be rushing back for another. Certainly there are better versions of the style that are just as available."
"D- a great beer that's commonality makes me overlook it most of the time. Easy to finish, but I don't think id want to attempt a second bomber. The price makes it something I should pick up more often than I do."
"Solid beer. I know if I could restrain myself for another 15 min to let it come to room temp, it'll only get better, but its already gone as I type this last sentence. As always, Bear Republic delivers."
"This is a standout beer."
"Mouthfeel was silky smooth and a nice aspect of the beer. I also found the beer fairly drinkable, but then again, I sipped it for quite a while. If you enjoy hops in your RIS, you'll probably enjoy Big Bear."
"A good beer, but not up to the competition in the RIS/Imperial Stout category. For that reason, I'd be reluctant to recommend, despite a good review."
"Drinkability: very high for an RIS also for an 8.10% beer very well hidden"
"Poured form a 22oz bomber into a pint glass. Appearance is nearly pitch black with a frothy tan head that sticks around for a while. Smells of dark roasted malts, chocolate, hops. Tastes of roasted malts, a bit of coffee and chocolate malts. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy smooth. This beer is very drinkable especially for the high 8.1% abv. I would definitely recommend this stout to anybody."
"D: Good drinking stout. I think bombers of this are going for about $4.00 here in NJ. It would be hard to find a better stout at a better price."
"D: if I had another bottle, I have a feeling I would have no problem drinking that as well...I think RIS's are really growing on me..."
"A dark brown to black color, with a quater inch head, that is light brown in color. The head slowly dissolves away. The deep scent of roasted malt hits the nose, but soons fades, and is followed feintly by combination of fragrances. The scent of coffee and chocolate, with dried fruit come through, but are very weak. A malty taste, hearty, with chocolate coming halfway. Then it blends itself to a mild grassy bitterness, that grows to a earthy bitterness at the end. A rich medium bodied feel, that thins out very quickly and brings the strong feel of carbonation across the palate. This stout has great look, hearty flavor, but the aroma is rather weak. The feel, may be the weakest and thinnest stout I have ever had."
"Pretty thin on the mouthfeel for an RIS. Finishes crisp and clean and very roasty. Superbly drinkable. In fact, dengerously drinkable."
"D: For an RIS, this goes down so easy. Its heavy on the palate or in the stomach, and the lack of ABV heat makes this one dangerously close to a chugger. Just so easy to drink. I know that this beer is not crazy dynamic by playing with crazy flavors, but it is simple and almost perfectly balance. I have been wanting to try this one for quite some time and it sure did not disappoint. Awesome brew."
"Overall, I do feel that the weakness of this beer actually makes it a bit more drinkable. I would enjoy it when it is available but will likely not be searching it out."
"At $5 for a bomber, this is a good beer and a great value."
"D - its muted flavor makes it as easily drinkable big beer."
"This beer pours very dark with a dark tan head with lots of lacing. The smell is very robust of coffee, chocolate and licorice. The flavor is nice, not an over the top one with mega flavors but what is there is nice, lots of flavor from the toasted malts along with the coffee and chocolate flavors. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy with a very slight dry feeling. For 8% this is a highly drinkable brew and for 5$ bombers this is a good fallback for a night out :)"
"Recommended: To all"
"Taste hit me with vanilla right off. This thing is incredibly smooth and milky. Has nice chewiness and soft finish. This beer does not slap you in the face with flavor like some RIS's, but it is incredibly drinkable... maybe dangerously so. This is a very delicious brew."
"Drinkability: Good, I like Ipas, though. It would be a tough pint for a non hop lover."
"Pours with a medium dark brown head. Medium carbonation. Color is opaque, pitch black. Aroma is quite roasty and coffeeish, hops definitely noticeable. Mouthfeel is somewhat sticky, medium body. Starts chocolatey, dry and is roasty throughout. Finishes with some burnt toastiness but pleasant. Alcohol is warm, not overpowering. Body, mouthfeel and alcohol all seem on the low end for an imperial stout."
"After numerous times saying that I was going to pick up this brew I finally decided to, pretty dumb of me waiting this long I suppose. Well this brew poured to a pitch-black color with a good sized dark tan head that had very good retention and left a ton of thick lacing at the top of the glass and then rings down the side. The aroma is very inviting with its very dark roasted/ astringently burnt malt that also gives strong impressions of chocolate, coffee and berry like fruit. Also lurking is a slight alcohol aroma that you knew would be there with this brew weighing in at 8.1. The flavor is nice, the astringent malt comes out quickly but that breaks down to a nice mixture of chocolate, caramel and a slight sweet berry flavor. As it warms more of a coffee/espresso flavor comes out mixed with a clearer alcohol warmth. Has a dry finish that adds a little bit to the astringency. This is a good brew, can't have many of these in one sitting as you will get in trouble quickly but a nice sipper, especially as the flavors do change a bit as it warms. I should not have passed this brew up and will try some other offerings from this brewery in the near future."
"Also, Big Bear Black Stout is great name to go with this warming West coast stout."
"this beer pours a very dark, opaque brown with a thick 3 finger, rocky tan head that has excellent retention ad leaves come nice thick lacing on my glass. Aromas of strong northwest hops come to mind with a touch of peppery spiciness (jalapeno possibly?) with hints of chocolate, coffee, and caramel on the nose. Taste is of some nice dark fruit up front with a highly enjoyable subtle hop presence throughout. Finish is quite chocolaty with a slight spicy kick @ the end. Nice roastiness from the malts on the linger as well. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with a very nice amount of carbonation (not too much!). This beer has a mouth-coating finish that is cut nicely by a good amount of crispness and a touch of spice. Finally, despite its relatively high ABV, this beer is quite drinkable. It goes down smooth and its spicy crispness prevents it from feeling too heavy. The alcohol is certainly present but NOT overwhelmingly so. An excellent buy which I will surely be buying again in the future. Overall a truly remarkable stout."
"D: This is a fantastic brew! Heavy, thick and malty, but the hops balance things out very well, drying the palate for the next sip. Alcohol makes itself known through a spreading warmth, but it is not forceful."
"D - This Imperial Stout is one of my favorites, especially since we do not get much in the way of craft down here, the only complaint is the body, but nothing to stop me from really enjoying this beer"
"d - terrific beer and it goes down way easy."
"That aside i love this beer, great taste, the hoppiness is a great suprise and it hides the abv quite well."
"D - I like this but I wish the hops weren't so fragrant. I guess I enjoy a stout a little more on the malty side."
"1/29/10: 1-2 year old bottle with no bottling date purchased about 10 months ago from Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA). Poured into a Duvel tulip. Exceptional appearance -- completely opaque black, amber-ruby edges, and a healthy 2-finger beige head with staunch lacing. Aroma is way less hoppy than fresh with more chocolate malty tones and a cola-like aroma. Flavor is surprisingly malty considering how hoppy the fresh version is. WOnderful strong dark sweeter malt presence with milk chocolate and light roasted coffee bean. Hops are minimal and mainly provide a subtle leafy, bitter tobacco counterpoint to the sweet, chocolatey maltiness. The finish has a slightly stronger coffee flavor with a bit of char that carries to the aftertaste and hits on a bit of anise/licorice. The feel is still a little lighter than most imperial stouts, but I think it has increased in heft a little -- or maybe decreased in carbonation. A wonderful beer with about a year on it, and definitely a unique, hoppy stout fresh. A great value at $4.49 a bomber. I wonder how well it will hold up at 2 years, but at that price, there's definitely no harm in finding out. Stellar brew both fresh and with a year or two on it."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is very full at fridge, cellar, and room temperatures -- very impressive! The mark of a well-made stout. Maybe the ""Imperial"" designation gives me pause simply because the beer hides its alcohol so well. This beer -- even if it's not as flashy as stouts from breweries like Southern Tier and Stone -- is extremely pleasant and drinkable, and I wish I could get it in six packs. As it stands, carbon-footprint-related considerations might prevent me from buying it when I'm not visiting people out West, as other Eastern breweries, like Victory with their Storm King, also do the sub-Imperial Stout pretty well. Still, a great beer from a great brewery!"
"The drink is rich and fullish in body with excellent carbonation and a not-so-subtle belly warming factor. It's a big bold beer, for sure, but like its much-maligned namesake, it's no monster. A cuddly Teddy-type bear of a brew it isn't, but I remain unafraid... I'd tangle with the Big Bear anytime."
"8/5/6/3/14 (3.6/5)"
"I think it's tasty, big, and balanced."
"Not that hard to drink as it seems smaller than it actually is, but the fact that this beer seems nothing like a RIS makes me want to look for other options to get my malty, coffee, boozy fix."
"Drinkability: Thought this was just a standard RIS when I started, but as it warmed it got better and better. Still not a great RIS, but very smooth and pretty damn drinkable."
"(rated Feb 5, 2008)"
"When I tasted it i was extremely surprised, so smooth, all around my mouth and finished wonderful. Notes of coffee and burn malts but not nearly as heavily done as other imperial stouts i've had...this just tastes like a really wonderful balanced stout. So good, and it tastes like there is a little hop bitterness at the end too, which I enjoy. Great beer!"
"D - Another solid beer from Bear Republic a good RIS thats worth trying"
"I don't know why I waited so long to try this, but it was well worth it. Black viscous pour with a tiny tan head. Aroma of toffee and caramel with some toasty malts. The taste is big. Lots of bitter chocolate with some coffee and hops to keep it from being sweet. Nice malt back and dry finish. Well balanced and the 8% taste never comes through."
"Overall- A good warming stout with just a tad too much alc. and sweetness present. Give it a shot."
"Pitch black with creamy head. Tons of lacing up and down the glass. Nose is malty with notes of cocoa and coffee. Taste is sweet up front, then subsides to a bitterness only to return to a sweet finish. Taste is roasty with notes of chocolate with a pinch of molasses. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy just as a stout should be. Dangerously drinkable."
"A must try RIS. Almost too easy to drink."
"Pours a dark brown with thin coffe colored head. Aroma of roasted maltiness, chocolate, caramel and toffee. Flavor is dominated by sweet chocolate maltiness. Caramel, toffee, and brown sugar. Dry slightly bitter finish."
"This may very well be my current favorite domestic stout. I'll just have to try another to make sure."
"Sample at the Super Terrific Stout Tasting on 02/16/08. This beer pours a nearly opaque black color with a medium light brown head that burns away slowly. Rings of lacing on the glass. Aroma of chocolate malt and coffee at first, with some vanilla in the background later. Rich, creamy body with toasted malt, chocolate and coffee flavors. The finish is somewhat dry with an espresso flavor that leaves a moderately bitter and lingering aftertaste. Pretty solid from start to finish."
"Notes from 5/5/05"
"The alcohol wasn't noticable and good taste makes this something I would pick up again"
"From a 22 oz. bottle purchased locally. Aroma is plums, coffee, and maybe a hint of orange. Color is a jet black with a nice tan head. Flavor fruity, malty, a little sweet, and roast comes though in the end helping with the dry finish. Some hop flavor, but plays backup to the malt. Thick and smooth, yet drys well. A slight hint of alcohol. One of my favorite stouts. It's Imperial from the strength, but is not as heavy as most of it's other Imperial cousins."
"Overall I am very impressed with this beer, and I hope that Bear Republic makes their way to GA soon. Be sure to give this one a try."
"A moderate ABV and medium body, along with a reasonable price tag, makes this a year round option in the R.I.S. department, particularly here in SoCal."
"The mouthfeel was quite pleasant. Smooth, light carbonation, rolled over the tounge quite nice."
"Pours dark, ink black with a creamy mocha head. Opening the bottle i quickly got a whiff of some nice yeast and hoppy aromas. It's not until you get a taste that you get the wonderful roasty malts. Hints of chocolate and a slight oily aspect, but not really. After a we bit of letting it sit, some sweetness comes forth that leaves a nice flavor in my mouth. The pour i did gave too much head (HEHEHE) so exploring the aroma in the glass was a bit hard. The bottle didnt give much either. This is really drinkable. I think it was a good decision, if it could be even made, to not make this stout huge. This is easier than some of its big brothers. A nice sipping beer for the cold weather to come. This one could sit for a bit, but it doesnt have to."
"D - Not the most drinkable brew ever but for being a big black stout, it's nice. The 8.1% isn't noted in the taste at all."
"D: Very easy drinkability, dark, yet very smooth in character with a rich, yet very even roasted feel makes this an enjoyable drink to down."
"Drinkability is fairly high. The alcohol is relatively moderate and the flavors are tasty which make for a really easy to consume RIS. My reservation is that it's not as malty as I think RIS's should be. A solid beer, interesting for the style, but not quite there. It's a really good beer, but it's all hops and it's not appropriate for the style."
"Drinkability is good. I had the 22 oz bottle myself and enjoyed every drop. Another 12 oz would have been nice, but thats about pushing it. A good RIS, not as dramatic as some but tasty and inviting."
"D - Sweetness limits this one, but at only 8% this one is an easy drinker."
"This is a big, dark stout. A definite sipper. The flavors are good, but has a menacing, charred feeling that lingers."
"undated bottle from Total Wine Fairfax...with all the hop-centric beers BR brews, I'd really like to see some dates (not such a big deal for this impy stout, though)"
"A big stout - a hoppy version, though roasted maltiness does well. Very rich. Delicious! Certainly recommended for those interested in a hoppier, less traditional, take on the style!"
"A Tiramisu with tropical fruit reduction would pair nicely with this beer."
"The taste is similar, rich caramel and roasted coffee, stewed dried fruit, roasted malt in general, hints of chocolate and red wine. It has good sweet-bitter balance, greatly adding to the smoothness and it's a bit oily yet not too heavy in body."
"A decent beer but probably not one I will be buying again."
"Pours a dark brown, almost black color with a beautiful cascade effect forming a large, sticky brown head. Bright brown highlights shine through the bottom of the glass. Brown sugar and sweet chocolate malts shine through the most in the nose. Big bready character immediately follows the sick onslaught of big roasted chocolate malts, maple syrup, bakers chocolate bitterness, smoke and caramel shine through as well. Big full flavor with a lighter than normal body, still lots of good chew, and dangerously drinkable. I recommend this one. Bear Republic is 4 for 4 in my book!"
"Big brown frothy head covers blackness. Good retention and globby lacing. Aroma is a little faint. Burnt malt and zesty hops, and a bit of alcohol on the nose. Big taste of roasted coffee and high hop bitterness that is welcome but can become a little astringent with time. Mouthfeel is a little thin and the alcohol peeks through, especially after warming. Overall though, Big Bear Black Stout is a great imperial."
"Pours a pitch black, with a large off white/tannish head that is a slightly rocky, decent overall retention and thin retention throughout, and laces in sheets. Aroma is enormous, with a lot of chocolate, coffee, caramel, and a generous dose of hops. Flavor is equally large - tons of chocolate, middle becomes more coffee like, and ends with a very big and tasty hoppy bitterness. Full bodied, amazingly flavorful and complex - definitely one that works best in a cold cold glass."
"A top-notch beer, not just full of character, but full of intelligent character. Well balanced, well rounded and well conceived."
"D- The higher ABV mixed with the bigger bomber limits the drinkability of this brew, it is one bottle and I am done."
"Not the best Imperial Stout I've had the pleasure of knowing, but a quality brew that deserves to be checked out."
"D - I am glad I picked this as a desert for the evening."
"It's not bad, but it's not one I'd buy another of. I tend to like my russian imperial stouts very, very rich and hearty however, so that may have knocked it down a bit in my review."
"D - Maybe still a tad bit young, but not too bad otherwise."
"Pours black as a panther.. or a black bear. Whatever. Perfect head. Lumpy, lots of different size bubbles working away in there, a solid half inch sits there for a few minutes after the pour. Aroma is of light raisins, cereal, ripe plums and oranges. Taste is a little milky and sweet. A definite alcohol presence but not burning or overly grain alcoholy. Kind of soda like in its carbonation and mouthfeel. Almost a little bit of a cola flavor in there as well. Goes down easy, but don't drink it too fast or you'll be on the floor!"
"Drinkability: 8.1% ain't nothin' for an RIS, and this one's nice and complex, despite it's relatively low (for the style) alcohol. This one's not crazy complex - there's chocolate, coffee, anise, all your traditional notes - but it's nice for what it is: a light, surprisingly refreshing, and very drinkable RIS."
"E: This beer is intense, but somehow works."
"Great. The alcohol content can come through a bit hefty and get one unaware, but it is a great stout if one wants to get a bit hazy and do it enjoyably."
"Remember this is a really good overall day to day stout. That's right you can drink this everyday and feel good about it!"
"D. One of my favorite beers. Cant go wrong."
"Overall Impression - This is a very nice stout. I've been looking forward to being able to try this for sometime now, and it didn't disappoint. A little lighter than other Imperial Stouts, but still an intense beer. The alcohol is completely hidden in every way in this beer, the combination of the aromas, and flavors is wonderful. This is one of the more complex stouts that I've had, and will definitely make it into my regular rotation."
"M,D: The mouthfeel is a bit thick and creamy, but the drinkability is exceptional, I could drink a few of these"
"Opinion: This is a really good beer. I like the overall flavor and aroma presentation, and it still stays really drinkable. This beer is rather dangerous in that I want another one, and I am still warming up from the first. I like this, and would like to drink more. I would recommend this beer, no doubt."
"dark black body topped with an inch of frothy, tan bubbles that linger on and on. smells like molasses and toast. taste is smooth. sweet, rich and roasty with a hint of bitterness in the back end. goes down so easy for an 8% abv beer. this is a great RIS, it's exactly what i want in the style, more of everything good about a stout, but without going too far. i could put down a couple bombers easily."
"EDIT: After having a few more, I find the flavour of this stout undeniably awesome. It has a nice balance of coffee/chocolate with a perfect hint of hops."
"I'm writing more in this review than I need to because I have to meet the minimum of 250 characters but let me say I read this site quite a bit but have only written a couple of reviews. No need to go into details here. This is the best beer I've ever had in my life and I've tried hundreds."
"D - A terrific brew that goes toe to toe with the heavy hitters. I will certainly come back to it again in the future."
"Mouthfeel is creamy but not as thick as some imperial stouts, and the drinkability is very high. Pretty good RIS."
"Prosit, MK"
"D - d here is all about delicious LOLz. As a result of this awesome flavor, amazing smoothness, and hidden ABV the drinkability of this beer is off the charts. Bear Republic rock the casbah again (and again). These dudes rule so much. Start distributing in GA ASAP PLZ! Highly recommended."
"Pours midnight black, some dark brown highlights around the edges when held to light, big rocky/foamy tan head fades somewhat slowly, leaves a foamy film on top of the beer, a few stray big bubbles floating around, just a few spots of lacing on the glass. Big roasty smells just pop out of the glass, dark chocolate, strong coffee aroma, dark fruits in the background, and just a hint of alcohol. Taste is burnt coffee,, molasses, bitter dark chocolate covered espresso beans, spicy alcohol on the lips. For me, it's just the littlest bit over-carbonated, but it's a minor complaint for such an outstanding brew. A total classic, one that will be enjoyed in my house for years to come."
"One to savor."
"Flavor is packed with an initially smooth hoppy and sweet chocolate blend, and transitions quickly to a finish of smoked malt, dark chocolate, and resinous hops. The mouthfeel is a bit thin and overly carbonated for a big stout, but the bitter chocolate aftertaste is a nice touch. I remember liking Big Bear Black Stout a whole lot more the first time I tried it. Nevertheless, it still lives up to the Bear Republic name, delivering a complex, tasty stout that I'll be sure to have again."
"One of the best stouts out there, period. Fans of stouts must try this."
"I am not a big fan of the soy sauce flavor. Other than that, it has a fairly bland taste. Overall this is not a beer that I will get again."
"Heavy bodied,chewy with a good bit of cloying,filling not a beer i'd want to drink more than a couple of. Was a cross between a stout and an ipa with the big hoppy bite and lots of malt,interesting beer.Would make a good winter warmer for me,i'll give this one another try again since i recently became avalible in my area. Thanks to Sudsdog for the send."
"A bit disappointing, I must say. This wasn't bad, don't get me wrong. I was really expecting to be blown away by this and I just wasn't. Sort of an average RIS..."
"Drinkability- Very nice beer, I will revisit it one day."
"Not too bad. I'm certainly enjoying it. I'd probably buy this again as long as the price was right."
"Attempted to pour this vigorously into an imperial pint, but only got three inches of beer before the head rose to the top of the glass. Huge thick head that was sticky and lasted for quite a while, and left lacing from top to bottom. Black liquid with dark cola color around the edges. I smell chocolate right away, nice. Nice thick, but not to thick mouth feel. Kind of a rich malt, chocolate taste, maybe a little coffee, with hops noticeable. Oh so good. very smooth as all the carbonation seems to have left after the pour. Will buy again."
"Poured totally black with a nice 1 finger tan colored head. Lots of coffee in the aroma, but with a nice dose of roasted malts as well. Very nice so far. Flavor was full of coffee, licorice and ripe fruits along with chocolaty notes in the finish. Spicy hops were a little evident towards the finish as well. Mouthfeel was medium-full in the palate, but the beer went down fairly easily anyway. I could probably down two bombers of this stuff in one sitting. A great stout that I hope will one day be available in North Carolina. Recommended."
"D- I could easily put a few of these away if the keg was next to my couch, instead of a 5 mile drive away."
"Overall: I was expecting a sweet, coat your tongue, can only drink one of these type of Stouts. Quite the contrary: Absolutely easy drinking, with little after taste, and one of the best IMP Stouts around!"
"Taste is oh so smooth. Its way too drinkable for being over 8%. The dryness is there in the finish but before that comes a lot of deep dark sweet malt tastes. The sweetness really draws you in and the strength is hardly noticeable. Lots or roasty, smoky tastes as well. Love it. Excellent beer."
"D - Solid stout... A little too hoppy for my liking... One or two per sitting... 8.1% ABV bites by the 2nd glass..."
"This is another success from Bear Republic. Simplistic approach to a stout and a really solid beer, all told. Price was right, too at $4.69 a bottle. Word up."
"A hoppier and fruiter RIS in comparison to others. In fact much of the time, I though I was drinking a dark IPA. Sweet lemon, some hop juice, and minor notes of fruity esters were more dominant than the traditional roasted cocoa flavors. Easy to knock back and a different viewpoint of the style, being it's lighter and fruitier."
"D- Overall a very nice stout. A tad on the sweet wide. Something that I may not session but nice with a cigar or smoky bbq."
"Into a pint glass, this beer is quite dark, with just a slight ruby tinting when held to the light. The head is small but thick, and tan-colored. The aroma is rich in soft cocoa and caramel malts. Excellent malty complexity in the flavor: An initial start of sweet milk chocolate gives way to lightly roasted coffee and dark chocolate notes with enough bitterness on the side to drive the sweetness into the background. Nice resinous hoppy taste as well. Soft and creamy texture, and surprisingly light for the alcoholic strength."
"What I like most is how drinkable it is. I can enjoy this with a grilled delmonico and spicy arugula salad or after dinner with creme brulee. Its highly drinkable all year round. Its going on tap at my bar."
"Ok, I buy the style characterization. But the beer does hinge on the gavity of an American Stout. Very drinkable and enjoyable for either because the beer emphasizes the intensity of flavor over gravity or feel. This beer is cramed pack full of strong cocoa flavors that will rival Rogues Mocha Porter. Balance that with a strong coffee (nearly espresso) flavor notes that also complement the sharp, American hops that do resemble the younger American Stout. Fresh and intense describe the flavors well. The body is full for a standard American Stout, but not chewy or dense enought for a RIS. I don't seem to care, where it drops off in thickness, it makes up for with drinkability. Still I keep comming back to that intense cocoa / coffee / nutty / toasty blend that makes this beer work for me. Another hats off to Bear Republic for another world class beer. By the way, this beer could win beauty contests with it's appearance that I just didn't describe very well."
"Pours a thick black with a small tan head. Smells of heavy chocolate and slight coffee. There's some hop aroma mixed in there too, but it's in the background. Mouthfeel is somewhat heavy, but not syrupy. It coats your tongue and delivers a heavy chocolate flavor that lingers there and warms up the mouth. This thing is a fabulous dessert. I don't know if I'd call it an all out imperial stout, but if it were categorized by BJCP standards, it's probably my favorite American stout. The hops are restrained, it's not overly sweet and the flavors are all balanced perfectly. It's not an extreme beer, so it's approachable and delightfully drinkable. I'll take 2, please."
"Served in my DFH snifter. Pour was brownish-red, but appearance was cola-colored in the bowl. Half-inch khaki-colored head consisted of tiny dense bubbles and a cap speckled with ringlets. Scent of malt and a hint of cocoa; metallic smell presented itself as brew warmed. Head was replenished with each pour. Sheets of consistent lacing with lots of leg. Taste consistent with nose, but a lightly charred coffee flavor is presented up front, as well as a lingering hops bitterness at the finish. Similar to the nose, I also detected a faint metallic flavor at the back. Mouthfeel is fair; somewhat watery and a little too effervescent, which is not what I consider to be characteristic of an RIS. Mild astringency experienced under the tongue and along the sides. Alcohol was well-hidden, and brew was reasonably priced. Faint metallic presence keeps this from being '4's across the board; a decent brew nonetheless."
"It could just be me because of my inexperience, but when i first took a sip it tasted a bit like soy sauce lol. Later on I detected other roasted flavours, but thats all. Maybe if I were to give it time I might get use to stouts. I know that guiness is really only watered down with some sweet roasted characteristics, but this one is too complex for me at the moment."
"Bomber. Poured an attractive black color with nice tan head that lingers a little while. Aroma is of chocolate, coffee, and molasses. Flavor is very similar to the aroma. The hops balances the malt nicely. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Alcohol is really hidden well in this one. Excellent beer."
"Fine beet-very enjoyable."
"Overall, I really like this beer, one of the most easy drinking RIS I've had. Has a decent amount of hops without being overly hopped, which is a little surprising to me coming from bear republic. I'll be getting this one again."
"Nothing more here than a damn good beer at a damn good price. Recommended."
"This is an excellent beer. Very, very tasty. I highly recommend it, and it will probably become a go-to tasty stout. But it's not an RIS."
"D- Recomended"
"As my first RIS review, I do have to give Black Stout and Bear Republic high marks. A solid offering."
"Same goes for the mf, very good. All this combines to bring the drinkability up to a perfect 5. This is perhaps a more approachable RIS than some, I'll definitely enjoy this again!"
"A very enjoyable beer, near the top of my list and a high quality RIS. I would buy again and recommend to others"
"Very drinkable and smooth, not too rich like chocolate cake - which some of RIS's remind me of. Alcohol is somewhat present, but a nice bitterness is the most prevalent aftertaste. A great brew that is easy drinking for an RIS."
"Recommended..."
"A very nice RIS, definitely worth a try."
"Got this one cause I've been consistently impressed with everything I've tried from Bear Republic. This one pours a pitch black color with a light brown head that leaves fairly weak lacing. Nose is amazing: breadiness, sweet cookies, roasted coffee and light citrus hops. Lots of dried fruit. Taste doesn't quite live up to the nose's promise. Surprisingly hoppy - drying, bitter roasted malt rolles right into the citrus hop backbone. Short, hoppy aftertaste. Light sweet cookie malt. Not nearly as sweet as the aromas suggested. Body is medium and creamy. Good, not great. Overall, a really solid brew, although honestly a bit of a disappointment. Not quite on the same mind-blowing level as their IPAs. Next I gotta get my hands on that Racer X..."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer with a robust taste. You should keep in mind that, like other beers of the style, it is pretty heavy. Excellent, though."
"Split a big bottle into a snifter glass. Poured dark black with a slight tan head. Lots of thick lacing on the glass. Nose was of bitter chocolate, slight fruits, and a touch of alcohol. Initial taste is of sweet malt and bitter chocolate. This one finished creamy and smooth. I expected more bitterness but it didn't have as much as I was anticipating, which was good. This is a perfect example of a solid Russian Imperial Stout. Overall quite tasty!"
"Poured from a 750oz. bottle into a snifter. Nice looking stout. Black with a nice size tan head. Sweet vanilla and malts with a spicy alcohol and coffee on the nose. Taste is creamy and sweet. Very nice! Stays malty in the middle until a little bit of the coffee biterness comes through. Doesn't have a bite to the end. Stays smooth and sweet all the way through. Damn fine stout. Just started getting it down here in Baton Rouge. At 4 dollars a bottle it's a great freakin deal! Will make sure to clear space in my beer fridge for a few more bottles."
"Sweet tar molasses aroma ... black as midnight ... lacing is all the live! .... definition of an imperial stout ... very sweet libation ... alcohol is quite well hidden ... this is a perfect beer to celebrate ones birthday but make sure not to celebrate to hearty, can be a sneaky brew!"

"Drinkable is a definate, alcohol is noticeable but subdued. Complex so I want to take my time."
"Flavor presented with an abundance of deeply roasted malts, charcoal, molasses, dark chocolate with a touch of caramel/brown sugar sweetness. Presents a long, semi-dry minerally and somewhat bitter finish. Alcohol is well concealed under the hefty flavors and body of this great Imperial Stout. Easy drinking stuff here."
"Pours out a dark ruby that is almost black. Head is thin and of a chocolate mousse color. Leaves some nice lacing. Aroma is of pure chocolate, fruity, light roast coffee, cane syrup, honey, almond extract, a hint of raisins and some earthy, woodsy hops. Alcohol is kind of prevalent in the aroma, but it kind of works here. Flavors are all very well-layered between the chocolate, roast, fruity esters, alcohol and herbal, leafy, floral hops. Very enjoyable, however, as it warms up, the hops get a little too forward. Mouthfeel is moderate to full with some buzzing carbonation. I really enjoyed this right off the bat, but the bomber gets to be a challenge as the hops come out more when warmed."
"Pours thick with moderate heading, light-dark copper hue head. Smell really only contains some black licorice, chocolate, and some tree bark. Very light footed creamyness, that glides perfectly along the palate. S`moreish flavor profiles that are extenuated at the finish with the light roast style that doesn't overpower any aspect of this incredibly drinkable RIS.The alcohol isn't noticed at all. The beer is somewhat one dimensinal, although the flavor is perfect and its VERY hard to find a RIS that actually has BALANCE! I love this beer."
"IN the mouth it was pretty thin for a stout. Overall a pretty solid stout in which the 8% was well hidden."
"Tastes of chocolate, bitterness thanks to a healthy hop profile, fruits and brown sugar."
"Not what I expected from this beer. I knew it would be good, but this is closing in on exceptional. I have to say it is creamy yet refreshing sweet but with a nice bitterness. Believe it or not its now in my top 5 of RIS or stouts in general."
"Poured a jet black with a nhuge tan head with mucho carbonation. Smell is very subtle slght roasted smell but nothing pronounced.Taste was rather flat. Not to much going on besides roasted malts, disappointing. ABV was well hidden but I would not buy or drink again considering Yeti is out there."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a light tan head that was nice and frothy, and, stuck around for a while. Aromas of deep roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, spicy hops, and maybe some caramel. The hops dominate the front of the taste, which are followed closely by the deep malts that come in the middle, turn very candy like, and finish the end. The mouth feel starts out bitter, is middle to full bodied, and dries out in the end. Overall a very easy drinking RIS of the ones Ive had."
"od, love the creamy head and addition of hops to a traditionally unhoppy stile, works really well"
"Overall: I love the Bear Republic brews as they tend to be hop heavy. This stout has the perfect amount of hops without going over the top. The chocolate and coffee flavors are big and bold making for a wonderful tasting/drinking brew. It's a winner."
"This poured an opaque reddish brown with tan head. It smelled like licorice with dark chocolate. It had a unique and very subdued flavor of heavy dark chocolate bitterness and oaky malt. It was thick and sticky with no carbonation and a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was the least coffee-flavored stout I've had. I wanted to like this more than it let me, since the flavors were all so good but weak."
"Drinkability: This one drinks nicely, thanks to a lower 8.1 percent ABV that is virtually not noticeable in the flavor. An above average RIS in my opinion. I've yet to be dissapointed by Bear Republic."
"Fairly black beer and lighter around the edges than most others I've seen. Semi-sweet chocolate nose and light roasted malt as well. Very fresh flavor of roasted malts and dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is almost full-bodied and the finish is somewhat bitter from the hops and astringency of the roasted malts."
"Notes: This could be one of the best RISs I've had. I think they did a nice job of not over hopping, like a lot of the other ones do."
"Drinkability: Quite complex, but well crafted as it hides the alcohol well."
"D-Very...almost a session stout..but at 8+ ABV hardley! This is a totally solid American stout."
"D- The light mouthfeel and no detection whatsoever of alcohol make this a very drinkable brew. I was quite surprised when I looked at the bottle and saw the ABV. This is a nice hoppy west coast stout. I wouldn't call it a RIS."
"D - This is a very good RIS. I wish it was available closer to home."
"D: Very easy. You almost want to say session beer? But you will get rocked. This beer is strong!"
"Overall, this is a fantastic beers. One of my favorite beers that i have tasted. Once again, thank you Nitrogen!"
"This is one of the top RIS for me. Easy to drink. I wish I didn't wait so long to try it. This is definately worth geting and enjoying. Bear Republic has it dialed in."
"Had this 22 oz. bottle in my cellar for about 8 months, and cracked it open this past weekend. Poured it into two crystal stemmed beer glasses. The color was a shade of mahogany-black darkness. Pours with a tan head that lasts the entire time, and lacing that stretches from the top to bottom of the glass. The smell was full of roasted malt and coffee. Taste-wise, this was one of the best RIS that I have ever had. It was sweet and roasted all at the same time. All I could think of was caramel and chocolate covered coffee beans. Delicious. For an 8% abv beer, this one went down very smoothly. It's one of those beers that you think that you could easily drink 3-4 bombers. Not a bad idea. This is one of my new favorite beers from Bear Republic."
"Hoppy goodness is all about it here. Pours your typical dark stout with a decent one finger, light brown head in a pint glass. Smell is super hoppy which I wasn't expecting in this stout. Taste had the same bitter hoppy notes and was light on the tongue, not a heavy drink. Slightly roasted malts were barely there, but the hops really took control on my palette. Went down easy and was quite enjoyable in the session."
"Great stuff!"
"Pours an overall opaque black color with some brown highlights towards the bottom of the glass. Big fluffy, tan head is formed with wide open bubbles; this is a sign of things to come. In the aroma, I wonder if someone dropped some squid ink in an IPA, this one is hop forward, very floral but there is also milk chocolate and a slight roastiness. On the palate, it is simply too hoppy. There isn't an overly roasted feel to it, it is closer to a hopped up brown or porter. Following that it is also overcarbonated for style, and a too thin body. Drinkability is low because when I want a solid RIS, I reach for a BCS or Expedition, not this hopped up monster. Besides, Storm King is already out there and this one seems like another clone."
"Pours black with ruby hints at the edges and over two fingers of luscious, pillowy brown head that exhibits excellent retention. Aroma is quite good, roasted malts are dominant with coffee and dark chocolate notes. Also present are some restrained citrusy hops as well as brown sugar and molasses. Taste is, at first, a bit sweet then predominantly malty. As we near the finish the roasted malts make their triumphant return as some subtle dark chocolate mingles with more powerful coffee flavors. Bitterness and some faint hoppiness then join the party. The bitterness is well rounded, not at all harsh, and definitely from both the roasted malts as well as generous hopping early in the boil. Mouthfeel is quite good, medium-full body that is velvety and not quite chewy with moderate carbonation. The 8.1% ABV is masked incredibly well and the only reason that I noticed is was a gentle warming sensation that I felt when I was about finished with the bottle. Overall this is one heck of a brew. I felt that this wasn't really an RIS (well, maybe a very American interpretation of the style) but an excellent American Double Stout. I highly recommend this brew."
"All told, decent, well-made stuff that's definitely drinkable if not a little unbalanced."
"This one is bold and complex, but still delivers a great amount of drinkability. This one is hard to put down. The alcohol is well hidden as well, although it's not as strong as other beers in the style. Recommended."
"Pours a solid black wit faint ruby highlights if held to the light. Creamy off white head slicks around for a little bit then laces the glass. Aroma come through with some smooth chocolates and some hops. Taste hits with a bit of chocolate then some roast then some alcohol then a bitter hop finish. Aftertaste of roasted malts and hop bitterness. Nice thick stout creamy in the mouth. Great stout, a bit hoppier than I like, but solid stout nonetheless."
"Black pour with lasting tan head and some lacing. Smell is of lots of hops actually, some alcohol for sure, and some roastiness. Taste at 1st is big hop bitterness that fades after a bit and finishes fairly cleanish. As it warms becomes less bitter and roastier. Good Imperial Stout"
"D- Not a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination, just not my favorite for this style."
"Thanks to wkcyr4 for this one. Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a pint glass. The beer poured a very dark black color with a creamy two finger head that seemed to hang around for quite a while. Nice aroma, with a hint of roasted malt. The initial taste was very sweet malt, which then turned to a roasted malt and slightly hoppy finish. Very low carbonation which was right on for this beer. Mouthfeel was very full and thick. The alcohol content was not overpowering for a beer over 8% ABV. Would definitely have this one again."
"The beer poured an inky black color with a creamy, rocky head into a pint glass. Not much aroma, just a hint of roasted malt. The taste was initially of sweet malt, but morphed nicely into a roasted malt and slight bitter hop finish. The carbonation was right on target (low, that is), making for a thicker, more syrupy mouthfeel. The alcohol content was nicely concealed (would never have known it was over 8% ABV), making it an immensely drinkable ale."
"Hats off to this brewery making beer in wine country!"
"I was visiting the Houston Flying Saucer from out of town so I made myself move on to other beers after this one but I could just as well stuck with this all night. In fact, I think I should have. Now I just have to find it in NC."
"This is a really good Stout (Duh!) from Bear Republic. Tons of deep warming flavor and a well hidden ABV make this one highly drinkable and complex RIS. It definitely went down easy on this cold, winter's night."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied with a nice creamy smooth carbonation, which just increases the drinkability. Wish I had more."
"This is one of the most drinkable Impy's I've ever had. It's a little lighter than most, which is probably a big contributor to the drinkability, but the flavor is extremely smooth and very tasty. Very nice, recommended brew."
"Pours an opaque, oil-slick jet black with a big, durable tan head that never completely goes away. Smells of dark chocolate, vanilla, dark-roasted coffee and booze. The taste is a winner  again, bitter dark chocolate, creamy vanilla, pungent coffee and what seemed like bourbon and buttered rum notes. Additional creaminess as it settles  an overtone of what almost seems like Ghirardelli hot milk chocolate. Delicious. The mouthfeel, on the other hand, keeps this out of the Hall of Fame. A little thinner and watery than I would have anticipated. Still a wonderful evening sipper  paired great with 80% cacao Belgian dark chocolate after a hearty dinner."
"Overall, fantastic stuff. I have only positive things to say about this beer. Excellent price, too."
"The beer feels nice on the tongue, full but not too viscous. I think this is nice brew but when I think Bear Republic I think of their hoppy offerings and will continue to do so. Still this is a very balanced imperial stout. Try it."
"Had another on 10-21-2010 and its not bitter at all. Enjoy."
"This experience really felt like dessert in a glass. I would gladly repeat it."
"Pours the color of a black bear with red highlights in the bottom of the glass. a BIG furry brown head accompanies. The smell is dry dark chocolate, powdered cocoa, fresh ground coffee and sweet citrus hops. Crisp and dry for a stout yet the mouthfeel remains creamy. The taste is of bitter dry roasted coffee along with sweet cocoa beans and loads of orangey citrus hops. While this was not quite what I was expecting out of this beer; it is quite tasty and unique. I would happily enjoy this one again."
"Notes: Admittedly, my introduction to stouts... perhaps being somewhat critical, but have come to have a little more expectation for a big brew. Still quite tasty, nonetheless, but I suspect there's better."
"Feel is a bitter film on the tongue. Not hard to drink; smooth. Just thick; chewy. It's a middling stout, all things considered. Pleasant enough, a little too saccharine sweet. Not bad, not amazing."
"Pours jet black with an amazing dark tan head. Smells of sweet chocolate. Just the look alone of this beer in a full pint glass is impressive. First sip is delicious- somewhat sharp but many flavors(chocolate, malts, coffee??) all hit my palate at once. So far so great! Enjoyed this beer and was very upset when the 22 oz bottle was gone. Does not taste as strong (8.1%) as it says. Perfect smoothness- not too malty, not to sharp or bitter- just right and very drinkable. Cant wait to pick up another bottle."
"Very nice version of a RIS - not among my personal faves, but very good nonetheless. Try this one!"
"Mmmm, hops and chocolate. Seriously, this is like an imperial black IPA, were that a style. Crazy? Hear me out. It's got rich cocoa and espresso malts with lovely citrus hops in a balance of big but complimentary flavors. We're talking a pretty tasty stout here and I'm not a huge RIS guy. Like Old Rasputin, but more drinkable. A little thick but there's no hint of alcohol, reminds me of Surly Darkness in that sense."
"Pours a very dark brown with a thick, frothy beige head that left sheets of drippy lace on the glass. Strong aroma - sticky, brown sugary malts. Caramalized sugars, toffee covered fruits, and semi-sweet chocolate. Big hefty mouth full of flavorful richness. Oh yes, there's plenty of flavor here. Sugary chocolate and toffee...mostly sweet chocolate though coating some fruity hops. Oh my, its like drinking chocolate chips. Thick and smooth with not a whole lot of bitterness. It might be a little over the top with the sweetness, but one glass is pretty damn good."
"Excellent bottle of beer."
"will do"
"Pours almost opaque with a big tan head off a strong pour. Nose is mildly malted. Flavor is smooth with a touch of sweet that morphs into a roasted and hearty flavor. What is left afterwards is a strong, earthen flavor on the tongue. Feel is good. Great carbonation and highly drinkable. Pretty damn good stuff."
"D: An absolute joy to drink. It's even extremely easy to drink."
"Pour pitch black, huge foamy white head that stick around for quite a long time. Rich burnt caramel and roast caracter aroma also quite hoppy, not what I come to expect in a stout. Taste is rich toast/burnt flavor, a bit of star anise, coffee, alcohol and... a bitter taste of hops. Not a cloying ale high gravity ale, very drinkable, this would be something I'd have a couple of pints of if It was not drinving anywhere."
"Bear Republic is one of my favorite breweries and I've been waiting all afternoon to try Big Bear Black Stout. It doesn't disappoint. The beer is big and black on the pour with a moderate head of chocolate-colored bubbling foam. There is a strong aroma of molasses, brown bread and caramel. The malt strikes first on the taste, with roasted flavors, licorice and espresso. There is a hint of hops at the outset that carries over strong at the finish. There is a much stronger hop presence that a traditional stout but it appeals to me even though I don't like getting hit over the head with hop bombs in other brews. Big Bear is a stout that I could drink all night."
"Notes: Really like all beers I have tried from this brewery,,,, expecially this one and Hop Rod. I am now a huge fanof BEAR REPUBLIC."
"Well balanced and quaffable. Good pub beer to go with a burger or fish and chips."
"The style is Russian Imperial but the taste is your average stout. Don't get me wrong, this is a nice brew, probably better on tap. I wasn't bowled over but I did enjoy the offering. I just felt this one was a little wanting. I seem to recall enjoying this on tap at Hop Devil, so I'll look for it there again if it's available during my next visit to NYC."
"This Russian Imperial Stout pours a completely opaque black liquid. An initial half inch head dwindles quickly to sparse foam patches. No lacing at all. Smell is heavy toasted malts, burnt coffee. Hints of sweet vanilla become more evident as the beer warms. Some dark fruits are evident. A slight hop bittering. Mouthfeel is simply a thing of beauty. A crisp creaminess evaporates quickly leaving the palate clean and refreshed. Very smooth, alcohol content is disguised beautifully. This is my second beer from Beer Republic, and I am thoroughly impressed."
"Drinkability: Very nice. I will easily be able to drink this whole bomber by myself. It is not a great beer, but at $4.99 for a single bomber, is pretty damn good! In a world of price escalation, this one is a true winner. If you live anywhere west of PA, you should be able to get this one pretty easily. Nicely done."
"Pours an opaque darkness with a full finger wispy tan head that fades fairly quickly. Some lacing observed. The smell is solid roasted malt and unsweetened chocolate without being real aggressive. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is medium-full bodied. A tingle from the alcohol, the 8.1% ABV is also present in the swallowing breadth. Full flavored, the taste roasted malt and coffee taste is slightly more bitter than my favorite RIS and the aftertaste lingers some. Not my favorite by any means, but a good drinker and worth a try."
"D- Another great product from Bear!"
"This beer is very nice and easy to drink. Well craft RIS."
"d: I'm glad for the chance to try this, but there are much better RIS's out there. I doubt I'll try it again."
"4.99 for the bomber."
"I will be picking this one up and would call this a session beer with training wheels."
"Poured into a Boston Lager glass a nice deep opaque black with a decent tan head that slowly diminished and left spotty lacing. The aroma was roasted barley with some mocha aspects as well. The taste was dominated by roasted barley with dark cocoa and burnt espresso right behind. More hops than you would expect come through as well, especially in the finish. The beer is medium bodied with somewhat hidden alcohol. This is a very enjoyable Imperial Stout that I would love to see here in NC."
"D - a bit heavy, but drinkable none the less."
"Drinkability: Good beer. Nice and creamy and sweet, without the bitter hoppiness that some stouts like to add in. The best stout I've had in some time. Definitely worth a try."
"D: The alcohol hinders the beer a bit in this category since it's so strong, but it's not bad. It actually goes down pretty smooth, but I like quite a few other stouts better."
"Not as black as promised, but a truly remarkable beer. Very drinkable at 8%. Smell is the only characteristic of this beer that is not outstanding. Flavors of dark chocolate & coffee mingle with the perfect amount of hops. Mouthfeel is sexual, thick and warming. Alcohol isn't shy by any means, but doesn't overpower a perfectly crafted flavor. I won't hesitate to eat this beer again, ever."
"Really good stout."
"Big bodied and creamy in the mouth. This is a real nice evening sipper. I split the bomber but I could have sipped another glass after mine was gone."
"D- This is a well-balanced IRS that is not too overwhelming at 8%abv, overall this is a good, solid entrant is this category that falls short of some of the top dogs but would be good in a pinch"
"D- a solid great stout"
" The 8.10% ABV can be felt here, but it's not an overwhelming wallop. Most heavy stouts would be on my to-drink list after a strong meal, but in this case, I'd rather have it for a snack with some biscotti or the like. It's different from what I've had before, but not bad. I just wish it was a little more filling and robust. It's only worth a try for someone new to this style and wanting a light introduction..."
"Slightly thin in mouthfeel, and the head and carbonation started ferociously and were gone relatively quickly. Still, at 2.99 you won't find many better stout bangs for the buck (except for deschutes obsidian stout)."
"Two finger brown head that fell pretty fast off this style of beer.Impenatrible black body with some red highlights to it.Bitter chocolate taste and some sweet chocolate in the nose and some fruit also.Creamy mouthfeel with the diffenet taste and feel of alcohol,it burns your throat.Not much lacing is left if any.I dont know if this impy stout ranks up there with the other ones Ive had.There is a berry taste somehwere in there as well.Ide like to have this beer in six months to a year and see how it mellows.There is also a smell that im not familliar with when I dring the glass up to my mouth.There is also some licorice in here also.Not a bad beer but not a impy stout that I will come back too since I have better choices.I think there is bakers chocolate in there and some sort of a hop."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easy, a little bit filling, good representation of style while adding a very nice twist, good kick, as I stated earlier, its not your typical RIS, which is exactly what I like so much about it. Its definitely a sipper and not a pounder, but its a very good beer."
"Beautiful texture and great Imperial Russian from Bear Republic"
"This is, as suggested, a big bear of a beer. The relatively high ABV (8.10%) makes it a great fall or winter sipper. It's better served cold and allowed to warm up to room temp, as the nuances of the aroma and taste really emerge as the beer warms up. Another fine beer from our friends at Bear Republic."
"This bottle was aged for a year before drinking. Pours black with a relatively thin head and decent lacing. Smell is complex. Licorice, prunes, sweet malt, soy sauce, caramel. The taste is very smooth and mellow with a slight roastiness and similar flavors as the smell. The finish has a slight earthy hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth and soft. Very drinkable."
"(I've been looking for a good stout to use to try an ice cream and stout float. This is the one I'll try first; I think it will work perfectly.)"
"Bear Republic makes damn good beer, in case you haven't heard."
"Even though its taste is not my favorite, it is easy to drink."
"Pours a dark black with a rich and foamy tan head about 2 inches tall that quickly fades and leaves minimal head and lacing. Smell is hoppy with some dark chocolate aroma, as well as fruit, such as some bittersweet cherry. Taste is a little different from the smell, and not as impressive. The taste is mostly bitter hops, and I can't taste much of the cherry or chocolate. Mouthfeel is creamy, and smooth and no carbonation. A very promising beer but I take a sip and expect a little more in the flavor department."
"Pours a dark opaque black with a chocolate milk head that takes its sweet time. Smells of hops for a stout, roasted nuts, coffee, chocolate. Dry in taste, coffee grounds, bakers chocolate, nuts and some hops. Finishes bitter with alcohol throughout. Feels medium in the mouth with minimal carbonation. Drinkability is medium. A delicious offering from Bear Republic."
"D- I was kind of torn with this. It is really rich, but it is not overwhelming by any means. This is surprisingly refreshing on a very hot and humid day in Michigan."
"Medium body. Not bad, but too hoppy for my taste."
"D - Given the price and the quality of the beer, this one is one of the best you can get. $2.99 for this beer is truly a steal and boy do I feel like a bandit!"
"D- For an IRS this is extremely drinkable."
"Nice big head with a light tan color. Smell has hints of coffee and chocolate. Taste is nice roasted flavors with a great hoppiness that sets a good stout apart. Great complexity that makes this a serious drink. These same factors reduce the drinkability a bit."
"D: The lessened mouthfeel adds to the drinkability, making this probably the most drinkable RIS that I've ever had. A very good beer by Bear Republic, I would definitely drink this again."
"Overall, a fantastic experience. A huge beer with big flavors and big balance. I'm very glad I picked some up in Ohio. Highly recommended."
"Poured black as night, as any good stout should, into my glass tankard. The head required a vigorous pour and was a pleasing brown/red hue, but this faded quickly to a thin layer on the surface of the brew. Aroma was slightly sour and of coffee; more like espresso perhaps? Delicious. Thick and malty flavors are constantly swapping with the bitter coffee and roast tastes while the beer is in the mouth. This fades once swallowed to a pleasantly herbal taste of hops on the back end. Once adjusted to the intense quality of the malt flavors, some esters of dark fruits and berries can be detected in the nose and appreciated on the taste buds. A beer this strong in alcohol and character is not the most drinkable because you cant just knock it back. However, its not as boring as many beers that you could just knock back. A fantastic beer."
"Drinkability/notes: A very well-crafted example, with an obvious bias towards the hops. Would benefit from aging, or perhaps a slightly restrained use of hops."
"Aftertaste is dry, maltbitter and roasted."
"Overall, a decent imperial stout. I've had better, but this is a good, respectable stout. Good carbonation, no bad aftertaste. Could be more exciting, but not by much."
"On tap in NE Ohio. Pours a black color with a thick, dark head. Sweet smell, most likely from the molasses. Enjoyed the taste, less malt than expected, with a hint of hoppiness. I like the alcohol content. Finishes bitter and lingers slightly. Interested in more of the Bear Republic selections."
"This is one of those beers I've been waiting a long time to try. A nice 3 finger carmel colored head erupts on top of the deep black body with a bit of brown on the edges when held to light. Leaves decent lace. Nose is a sweet zesty malt with deep dark fruits and cordial candies. Not as sweet as expected as it enters the mouth, bitter blackness paints the mouth. It is sharp and long but nicely integrated and very even. Sweetness does develop a bit more with some warming. Mouthfeel is of burnt malt. Alchol is well hidden. Wow! What a drinkable masterpiece. Well worth the wait. Now I cant wait to find some more."
"This is an exceptional (imperial) stout. Delicious and rich; to be sought out."
"D - Overall I think this is my favorite Bear Republic beer I've tried, and among my favorite RIS's. Excellent beer and a must try if possible."
"Drinkability - This is a very drinkable stout. The alcohol is hidden very well so be careful. This is definitely one of my favorite Bear Repulic brews. Get you hands on it if you can!!"
"When poured in the glass, it was on the verge of being black, but had a deep reddish hue when looking up at the light. The smell of roasted malts was very evident with a fair amount of chocolate in the nose. The taste was of roasted malts and bittersweet chocolate. It was thick, bittersweet and very tasty. Just love this Bear Black Stout. The flavor and aroma was not overpowering, but, very pleasant."
"Good dessert drink or if you in the mood for coffee or chocolate."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied. Very, very smooth and drinkable. At 8.1%, it's strong, but not overly so. It works well for this beer. Overall, this is a fine stout. Definitely recommended."
"D- lack of balance hurts this beer some age may do wonders for this beer."
"D- Very good, if it weren't 8.1% ABV, it might be an everyday beer."
"Thanks for the bottle Talisker."
"black body with a lumpy, cushion-y brownish-tan head with accompanying lace. nose is chocolate cream, citricy hops, molasses, and coffee. taste is quite good, surprisingly hoppy with roasty-toasty malts, chocolate, and, well, reread what i wrote for the smell, though, a bit sweeter than i would have guessed. mouthfeel is a solid medium body that seems to waver above and below the line between sips, quite a smooth finish, and a long one i might add. very drinkable, not as big as other stouts, but it holds it own quite well. this was the second time i've had BBBS, and i still like it! then again, i don't think there is a single bear republic beer that i don't like..."
"D: Excellent, I wish I had bought more."
"D: A very drinkable IRS, the alcohol is incredibly well hidden. It is very smooth, easy to drink and flavorful. Another solid offering from Bear Republic, one of my favorite breweries."
"I have been waiting for just the right moment to try my 22 oz bottle of Big Bear. I have been real impressed with what Bear Republic does so I have really been looking forward to this beer. It looks initially as if splashed in my glass like it was black used motor oil , but when held up close to light you discover it is really a very rich red. The head is fairly large and was the color of coffee with cream. Huge chunks of lacing were left as it settled. Overall the appearance, for a dark beer, is simply outstanding. The body and mouthfeel are not as heavy as its appearance would suggest but are velvet smooth, and both on the teeth and tongue are a sensory delight. The nose is roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, spicy fruits, hops, and a touch of alcohol. Flavors are a mirror of the nose, but are even more intense, with the roasted malts and chocolate dominating. After all this, the finish surprisingly has a nice little bitter twitch. Overall it is very well balanced, and remarkably drinkable. I consider this at the very top of all the imperial stouts I have tried. It lived up to my expectations and more."
"D - The lighter-than-normal body attributes to the drinkability. In no way is it filling or overwhelming. The flavors don't consume the mouth, but slide around to hit every part of it, which I like. The alcohol is very light, if noticeable at all. I love the roasted characteristics of this brew. A very consistent and well-rounded Imperial Stout. Where some heavy IS's can have a lot of variables, this one stays true to the style. Heavy IS's may also not be for every beer lover, but I think Big Bear is an incredible example of this style and a great IS for anyone, be it the first time IS drinker or a seasoned veteran. I don't think Bear Republic can brew anything but an amazing beer."
"22oz. bottle poured a dark brown with a large tan head that leaves a few specks of lace around the glass. Smell has some chocolate and roasted malt notes with a faint scent of alcohol. The feel is a little light which isn't bad but surprising along with the fact that I can see my fingers on the glass though this brew. The taste has some dark roasted malts a bit of chocolate and a slight after taste of alcohol. I could easily drink this bomber but I can't help to think that this brew is a little bit on the week side and would probably make an excellent session beer if it was on draft."
"D: Great stout with typical West Coast hop focus. Very drinkable - hides its alcohol well."
"D - Awesome, is the only word that comes to mind. This was extremely drinkable, and even at 8.1%abv not a hint of alcohol was to be found anywhere in this. Not too heavy, but no where near thin, perfect drinkabilty, even on an abnormally warm early spring evening. A+"
"Notes: I'd consider this to be on the ""lighter side"" of Russian Imperial Stouts, but it's heavy enough to meet the style. Nicely blended profile of sweetness and bitterness, along with a smooth feel, makes this one a keeper. Enjoy."
"Highly recommended. A must try."
"Certainly a very drinkable beer though more than one or, at most, two would be enough with the ABV."
"Into a goblet, pours midnight black, dark as can be, with a huge tan head of creamy froth, lacing that falls down the glass but doesn't stick. The aroma is just under hefty, plenty to smell, but also a little fleeting. There is lots of coffee and espresso, chocolate, molasses, black sugar, and a faint leafy hop. The taste is much like the aroma, but even better. Boundless chocolate and espresso, roasted malts play prominently, but there is that leafy, earthy hop profile that makes this one stand out from the crowd. Combine that all with a mouth thats smooth and creamy, light and underplayed carbonation, and a perfect alcohol warming, with none of the bite... and I could sure use another.... please? no?... damn... A wonderful beer, very very good."
"I could drink this all the time. I will say I think it may feel a bit more like an American Sout than a RIS due to dryness and hoppyness."
"D - Quite possibly the best all around stout I've ever had, and I've had quite a few. If your a fan of stouts and porters, I HIGHLY recommend that you try this bad boy"
"Smell is deep and rich. Dark molasses with light roasted notes, hints of chocolate, cream, and the somewhat solvent-like booze that is expected with this style. Taste is rich and deep, but not so deep that it gives me a headache. Excellent. Milk chocolate, molasses, mild caramel, and some nutty almond qualities. It's deep but well rounded and somehow, quite light and easy to drink. Between this brew and Racer 5, I'm really starting to like this company."
"Overall, a very good RIS. Not the best, but definitely one of the better. Bear Republic manages an excellent balance between the malt and hops characters of this ale; that said this is definitely an RIS for hopheads. I've bought it before, and I'll buy it again. Recommended."
"Drinkability: This stout hits most of the high points although I wouldn't characterize it as a RIS; it's really more of an American Double Stout in my book."
"Drinkability is pretty good. It is easy to drink and offers solid flavors throughout."
"D: Overall, a very drinkable stout. I think the mouth feel drags it down in the end, but still pretty tasty. If your in the mood for a tame, somewhat hoppy, tasty stout, then this is your beer."
"A superb stout. Maybe a bit too tame to be considered a superb RIS, but a wonderful beer nonetheless."
"drinkability is good. alcohol is balanced well, but the bit of astringency takes away from the drinkability. it comes across more burnt/ashy than just roasty."
"D: Highly drinkable for the style. Lacks in complexity for the style but more than compensates in overall balance. The alcohol is well hidden and each sip leaves you craving another. A must try!"
"This was poured into a pint glass. The color was opaque with a large thick, foamy, tannish head that stayed intact for awhile. The aroma was some coffee, but a lot of a strong hops. The taste was a clean bitter bite upfront and all the way through. The stringent coffee taste was cutting through the roasted, choclatety malt. The bitterness numbs the mouth completely. The beer goes down smooth and the taste is unique."
"Poured out a very very dark brown, opaque, with a tight, bubbly tan head. The nose has a big dark fruit character, malt and balanced hopping, cherry, alcohol, and prune. The taste is creamy, smooth, with light coffe and chocolate notes, malt, caramel, buttery. An extremely clean mouthfeel. This is far subtler than expected, with a super clean, somewhat creamy finish. One notable characteristic is how well it hides the alcohol. The downside is a lack of character, or complexity. I let this warm up a bit, and some bittnerness starts to come through, but nothing new in terms of taste."
"For the style, this is a very drinkable beer. I look for more balls in my RIS's, not necessarily with abv, but more beastly flavors, more complexity, and better balance would take this one to the next level. Having said that, drink it up because its good! Cheers!"
"Taste was well balanced -- sweet malts (chocolate, roasted caramel) with decent, fruity hop backbone. Dry and relatively bitter for an IRS throughout. Sour cherries and dark cocoa in the aftertaste. Hard to go wrong in this style, for me, and this one is right up there!"
"A most excellent stout. I wouldn't get tired of these flavors and would enjoy sipping one after another."
"Another great beer from Bear Republic and a nice RIS that is a year round standard, not a special release. Worth a try if your a Bear Republic or RIS fan."
"D- alcohol just about undetectable, even when warm, flavor really shines as brew warms. Definetly for stout lovers, i'd love to have many more of these. Yummy, very much so."
"Overall very good beer and a good bargin. I will definately continue to pick this up in the future. Very similar to, but a little better than, the 8 Ball Stout I had a few nights ago."
"Drinkability, don't know. Can't get it around here. If I could, even at 8.1%abv, I would still drink a lot of this stuff. Great all around dark beer here. mmm"
"Drinkability - A fantastic, extremely well-balanced RIS. Great flavors, great mouthfeel, and looks like everything I'd want in an RIS. Of course, there is that 8.1% alcohol that I didn't notice at all, which could make some trouble after a while."
"Cheers!"
"I bought this bottle in Chicago about 3 months ago now and i think its high time to drink it. Pours surprizingly brown (as opposed to the expected total blackness) with a puffy head and lots of little bubbles. Nice filmy lacing. Odor is fairly wonderful mix of chocolate cherries, hops and a hint of boozy booze. Taste is amazing. Full-bodied chocolate, lightly bittered. Hops, mochachino and dark cherries....all blanded together into an orchestra of flavor. As it warms it becomes magnificent. Velvet mouthfeel, not particularly heavy for the style, which is welcome. A great beer. Holds up to the hype in every way and very inexpensive as well."
"D: Tasty, smooth,and with a $3.99 price tag, this stuff is deadly. Quite possibly the best bang for the buck I've ever had."
"This is a beer that is simply a joy to drink, despite the fact it never wows or astounds. The winding progression of flavors lulls one into a comfy, happy trance, and it speaks to a sage blending of top-notch elements. The ABV is gutsy, but it's also nicely incorporated and willing contributor to a warm, drinkable presentation. This Big Bear Black Stout is a big bear of a black beer."
"A 22oz bottle from Kappy's in Malden, MA (great beer selection; try it). The beer was almost black with a thick mocha head. It had a sweet chocolate aroma, but tasted more dark chocolate and espresso. Very smooth, a drinkable beer. I'd buy this again."
"Amazing, absolutely amazing stuff. Under 5 dollars at Premier Gourmet in Bufallo. Worth every penny if you like big, very rich stouts."
"Bottle courtesy of Beerandblues2: Poured a light black color ale with a nice brown foamy head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of roasted bitter malt some discernable hops. Taste is dominated by roasted bitter malt with a bitter hoppy finish. Body is more watery then I would have expected for the style with no alcohol being discernable. Overall, I found that this one was way too dry and bitter to really please me."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch creamy tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like roasted malt, coffee, some citrusy hops, and bittersweet chocolate. It tastes like roasted malt, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, molasses, dark fruit and also an earthy taste. More of the taste comes out once it warms up a bit. Mouthfeel is medium, and it's smooth and creamy. Drinkability is very good too, the alcohol is barely noticable so it's pretty easy to drink. I think this is a pretty good beer, I like it a lot."
"Mouthfeel was creamy and smooth. Body was full to medium density. A very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability was pretty darn good for a stout this thick. And available at a good price too."
"22 oz. bottle - color dark black  thick coffee color head - nose of coffee bean , anise , pine hopps , earthy , and coco  taste of chocolate , pine hopps , bitter baking chocolate and - body creamy , gummy and sharp  aftertaste of chocolate , earthy , and hopps"
"Dangerously drinkable. For a full-bodied stout, this is extremely easy to consume."
"Pours a deep mahogany into Guinness tulip with a dense, slightly red, head with little to no carbonation. Aromas of sour dark fruits and chocolate are very prevalent and intoxicating. The taste delivers everything promised by the aroma- and more! I couldn't put this down! The flavor was so good and developed more and more as it warmed turning to sour cherries and coffee. Unbelievably, this beer was very light mouth feel, making it soooo easy to drink. And this is 8.1%? Where's the alcohol hidden? Dangerous! I could drink this all day and be happy with it. Incredible."
"Mouthfeel- Very smooth and very mild for an RIS. But still a top contender for all others to follow."
"Pours deep black ruby in color with a tall and frothy dark tan head that dissipates in chunks leaving behind a rocky lace. Chocolate malt dominates the nose with additional aromas of cappuccino in the background. Taste begins with milk chocolate quickly followed by a burnt maltiness and unsweetened baking chocolate as well as a peaty earthiness. Turns a bit acidic and astringent towards the end with a lasting bitterness in the aftertaste. The alcohol level is well hidden."
"Another very solid offering from Bear Republic. Very good RIS and a good value too."
"Cheers!"
"Bear Republic seems to hit most of the styles pretty well. My opinion is they are an excellent brewery."
"Overall: Great stuff. Hoppier than I was expecting, but not overly so; it still has a good balance, and a distinct malty sweetness. Reminds me a bit of Rogue's Imperial Stout, but mellower than that, and not quite so rich or complex."
"This is another well done Bear Republic offering... certainly worth a try."
"Not a bad beer at all, though it could use a little help in the mouthfeel department. If I didn't already have Old Raspy, Thor's Thunder, and Poseidon within attainable distances, I'd probably be more impressed by this beer. If I didn't have to go to work soon, I'd have a Poseidon next to compare the two. Alas, there's no time for such a comparison."
"A fantastic impy stout from Bear Republic. I find this to be one of their more balanced beers, and is very enjoyable. Highly recommended."
"Would recommend and will seek out more Bear Republic beers."
"Drinkability: Like I said above, the alcohol detracts and it's like there's a war in my mouth with every sip. I can see some people really enjoying that, however."
"Good carbonation and medium-full body. Nice balance mouthfeelwise, but the over-the-top hops don't really do much for me. I'd like to see what this tasted like if it were more malty."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking stout. An ample, respectable brew, but it lacks the complexity of other Russian Imperial Stouts."
"drinkable?: yep, nothing to stop you."
"Dvery good, not crazy about the smell, but the taste outweighs it, its a sipper for sure and one I will return to again"
"Drinkability: Amazingly drinkable for an IRS. Very complex, very good."
"Pours black with a huge tan head, with good retention. Smells of raspberry, sweet chocolate, and dark roasted coffee. Taste is of sweet chocolate and roasted espresso initially followed by a strong showing hops. Very hoppy for a stout as others have noted. I like it. Mouthfeel is pretty good. This is a very drinkable stout that shows no signs of 8% alcohol."
"22 oz bomber from Capital Market, Salem Very nice looking beer, black with the brest hints of mahogany round the very edge. Large light brown head, creamy and thick. Bold malty/burnt aromas.Dark coffee in aspect Complex malt driven taste to this one, some good hopping in the middle of the tongue levels it out a bit, then a slightly sour berry finish followed by burnt malt bitterness and a finishing hop makes an appearance. Very nice on the palate, smooth and with little carbonation, goes down well, alcohol is barely noticed. Good Imperial Stout, easilly drinkable but perhaps not top of the class more like a ""B"."
" This is a very good, bold, stout. Nice and crisp but also creamy in areas. Great carbonation. Two Thumbs Up!"
"Poured out hard and got rewardedwith a hyge tan/brown head.Looks very thick black and nice.Smell is very subtle slght roasted smell but nothing pronounced.Taste surprised me being very astringent and dry.Alcohol hidden nicely.Nice mouthfel to it.Wasnt very impressed due to taste,,i actually pourd out the last few sips."
"Picked this up across the border in Wiscoland. Even after looking at other reviews I just can't identify the smell of this beer. Taste is pretty straightforward, maybe not as complex as some other imperial stouts. An interesting beer."
"."
"A fantastic stout from Bear Republic, another great California brewer. This is a no-nonsense stout that is true to its style, in my opinion. Strong flavors and a full, heavy body make it a great example of the RIS. Highly recommended! A must have!"
"D - Considering the mouthfeel, I would say it is very drinkable. Personally I think it would make good as a session brew."
"Top-notch RIS, thank you very much to Ken for the sample."
"GET MY BUZZ ON-y"
"Pours a nice black body with a brown head that isn't rententive nor does it have very much lacing, it does have a little lacing. A slight vanilla flavor with coffee, cocoa, and molasses. The taste is great with some vanilla and cocoa with raosty flavors, it was very nice. Mouthfeel is good and smooth. Overall it was very good and I can't wait to have another."
"The mouthfeel is huge and creamy. The alcohol is slightly warming but not bad by any means. Many thanks to Boolshot for this beer."
"D: I wish, I wish I had another bottle. The unique flavor profile here is addictive and delicious."
"Poured into my Duvel tulip glass, this beauty of a beer is the essence of darkness. Inky, darkest-of-night blackness. Sucking the light in, perhaps. A toffee-colored layer of thick, long-lasting, and lace-producing head remains perched atop the ink below it. Aromas are heavenly...a mixture of milk chocolate, espresso, caramel, roasted malt. The flavor carries all of this as well. Splashes of chocolate and caramel initially, the middle sees some of the chewy grains, with a co-op of ABV and choco-bitterness at the end (what a finish!). Surprisingly, it was slightly on the less-than-big side in the mouthfeel. Still, this is one mammothly drinkable beer. A nice nightcap to a busy day."
"I wouldn't be drinking many of this one. A bad batch?"
"Deep motor oil texture pours into the glass with a medium tight capucino head. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of dark chocolate and earthy flavors. A touch of fruityness in the aroma also. Taste begins with a baker's chocolate type sweetness. Gets a bit deeper with molasses and maybe some butterscotch flavors. A nice bit of earthiness and hoppy resiny flavors counter the sweetness. Darker chocolate is controlling. Some slight espresso roast is in there. Finish stays a touch sweet but has a nice warming and hoppy flavor. Too drinkable and too complex to sip even though its up there in abv. Must get more."
"Overall: A nice RIS, this one was a bit on the sweet side, though it was still very good."
"Finish is big on the toffee malt again, but after several seconds it is a little astringent."
"Pours a dark black color with a moderate head. Smell is faint and sweet, a bit like chocolate with a hint of hops. The taste is huge, and pretty dynamic. The first taste is a bit fluffy, with a chicory-like flavor added. Next is a syrup-like toasted-malt mixture. The tail has a bit of alcohol, but its wonderfully balanced by the hugeness of the rest of it."
"Great beer, interesting, hides the alcohol well...Bear Republic is the SHIT!!!"
"Is there anything Bear Republic can't do? Currently 3 for 3, this may be my new favorite brewery."
" Thoroughly enjoyed this one after supper. Sweet enough to be served as a dessert beer. FIND THIS, and give it a try!"
"Drinkability: One of the best versions of the style I've ever had, hands down. A bomber is extremely easy to finish (you can call that good or bad, though I say the latter), and an extremely fine treat indeed."
"This pours a jet black with a huge tan foamy head. Very impressive looking. The smells include coffee, chocolate,and a small amount of dark fruit. The taste is awesome with coffee and chocolate dominating this beer. The high alcohol is well hidden and there is a hidden sweetness in this beer, mollasses? I think the thing I like about this beer the most is that coffee and chocolate and not dark fruit dominate the flavor. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing very well. An excellant beer that I will savor. I got the growler at Half Time in Poughkeepsie. Cheers."
"The enjoyable and sustained excellence of the look, aroma, taste and feel makes this one of my favorite big stouts."
"D - Drinkable. I believe this is my first RIS, not bad, different than a regular stout. Would recommend though."
"This may be a little dry to drink a lot of, but still a very fine beer."
"Drinkability: The ale is smooth without a killer hop profile. The vanilla hints are very nice, as well."
"Overall, this is one very good beer"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is very smooth and creamy. The alcohol is well masked in the taste and smell. The beer is just shy of being full bodied. The beer is a dam fine beer drink by many of my standards. The beer is missing a certain unnameable something that would make it great. I will definately give this beer another try some day."
"drinkability: pretty good"
"Dark brown, near black with a generous tan froth. Strongly hopped aroma. Light an fruity. Coffee flowing over Cascades. Tastes slightly sour like powdered cherry drink mix. Lemony with a healthy dose of java, chocolate, brown sugar, and caramel. Light to medium body (for style). Very hoppy yet extremely drinkable. Not very typical for an RIS but quite nice none-the-less."
"This beer pours an opaque black color. The head is three fingers in height, rocky, and tan. Lacing is thorough. The aroma is wonderful: chocolate, toffee, cream. The taste is like the aroma but with a little more toffee than chocolate. The mouthfeel is nearly full bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a really good stout that I would certainly drink again if it were available in Minnesota."
"overpowering. You should be able to drink a few and enjoy them all."
"I loved this beer, as I love most of Bear Republic's beers. Writing this makes me want to go to BevMo and pick up more Bear Republic. I will definately have this again."
"Drinkability - goes down well, and is very good ale. Rich and satisfying. Could go for two bombers in a session if I'm offsetting my beer with food, and not drinking beyond that, but if not, then one per session would suffice, although I'd be eagerly looking forward to the next session to enjoy more of this in that case."
"Mouthfeel is mildly fizzy and filling in a medium-heavy way."
"Very rich and creamy brew, a good sipper with the 8% abv. Im impressed with Bear Republic, and look forward to some more Black Bears."
"A great food beer. Solid enough to stand on its own in the style, but not overpowering the food. Very drinkable for an Imperial, which I suppose is my only ""criticism."" I'm not normally a fan of Imperial stouts, because of that ""bite."" This stout smells more like an imperial than it tastes like one, which makes it VERY drinkable. Glad I have a bomber so I can top of my glass halfway through."
"Excellent RIS."
"Built on a sturdy backbone of deeply roasted malts, this stout offers a palate-pleasing mouthfeel and well-hidden abv."
"This is a very good beer, but for the style, it is only somewhat above average. It pours near black with a thin, foamy head. The taste is very nicely chocolately, as opposed to coffee. There is a smooth creamy mouthfeel, but it is a bit thin going down. I like the richness of the taste, but as good as this is, there are better RIS's out there."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I loved this one. Familiar and unique all in one."
"D: Not a bad beer but I wouldn't search it out."
"Ok, I liked a big head on my beer but this was a tad too big (3 inches or so). The body is every bit as black as a stout should be and the head looks like Cappuccino. Nose is a weird milky sweetnes that I don't really care for. Taste is slightly sweet chocolate, big sweetness kind of from out of nowhere, roasty coffee and a tinge of hops. This was the first Imp Stout that really blew me away in my early BA days. I still think its good, but a little too sweet for my tastes now. Mouth is pretty spot on for the style. If this was on tap, I wouldn't need my arm to be twisted to make a night of it, though as I said, the sweetness might get to me."
"Jen: I am very impressed with this stout. It starts off with a nice toastiness to it with hints of chocolate and coffee. It is followed by a mouthful of malts and roasted nuts that is quite delicious. It ends with a bit of a hop bite, but nothing too overwhelming or detracting from the rich malts. It is creamy and smooth with a good balance of a good thick body and a vibrant finish. This stout is a bargain and is definitely necessary for a stout lovers fridge."
"Drinkable, yes, most definitely. Although one is more than enough."
"Drinkability: This has a very clean and dry finish, so even though it's fairly heavy and high in alcohol, it's very drinkable."
"22 oz. bomber, served lightly chilled in a big chalice. It pours black with a 1 inch khaki/yellow head of variable-sized bubbles that leaves big pits as it recedes. It looks quite majestic and retains a cap of foam that leaves moderate lacing throughout. The smell is more hoppy than malty, with a big grapefruit/pine hop resin aroma that overtakes that malts. The hops also dominate the flavor, with citric/pine being the most prevalent, but there are also lots of roasted/coffee malts and notes of chocolate and caramel malts to balance the big bitterness. The body is medium to thick, which isn't thick enough for my imperial stouts - I want to almost chew on them - but that is about my only complaint with this beer. Overall it is a pretty good example of the style and I didn't have any problems finishing this one myself."
"Medium-full body, doesn't seem highly carbonated, but it's got just the right amount. Smooth, very easy drinking stout...great flavor, not too strong, not too weak. Well balanced, and easily the kind of beer I would drink again and again."
"D - moderate, great on hops and bitterness, could be too bitter for some, very tasty IMO, but as i said before, needs a stronger hint of sweetness"
"Overall a pretty decent Imp stout."
"This is a different take on an imperial stout. Not as hearty as expected. Sweetness prevails. Still this is an interesting and tasty treat."
"Not a session for me...but, oh, I love it."
"WOW is a good way to start off with this brew. Black as black can be in color with a deep dark brown/black head. Nice and thick is the head and it did stay for some time before finally fading to a thick lace. Nice! Deep dark roasted malt hits the nose, chocolate and coffee, the deep dark roasted type hit the nose. After you fight your way threw this, a hint of alcohol is at the end. Thick and sticky in the mouth with the deep roasted flavor and the 8.1 is well hidden. This beer is well worth looking out for and will be on my list of beers to enjoy again."
"mos def enjoyed it. they're big on IPAs at BRBC so it's nice to have a changeup"
"Dark, charred yet barely translucent blood; crater-pocked 33%, cotton candy textured, beige foam cap. Cherry cordial aromas dominate a struggling earthy pine hop scent. Sweet roasty malts. Big sweet date sugar cherry flavor all floating in a chocolate infused bourbon. Vinous middle yields to a roasted malt finish, almost coffeeish. Alcohol apparent for most of the swallow and lingers in the aftertaste, which is predominantly sour. Super sticky lacing. Slick mouthfeel, medium body. Roasted malt quality expands as the beer warms. A bit on the sour side, but the roasted malt quality is magnificent. Another fine offering from Bear Republic."
"At Stout, NYC in bottle. Excellent head, chocolate in the palate, strong finish. Highly suggest trying if you enjoy rich, full-flavored stouts with robust and clean taste. Didn't wait long to enough to check for hoppy finish if warmed, however, this one is smooth enough where it will go down without having the opportunity to let it go warm. Highly suggest trying if you are interested in robust, full-flavored and delicious stouts."
"Judging by everyone else reviews I think I got a bum bottle, hopefully when I get another some day this beer will redeem itself"
"Overall, well done and a great stout but not very drinkable in my opinion. I love this beer but I can only handle so much at a time."
"D - A nice RIS. A bit too much of the sour bitterness in the middle for me but still enjoyable. I would definitely try it again."
"Pours a nice deep black with a creamy tan head. The head sinks to a nice thick film that holds nicely and leaves nice lacing. Smell of sweet caramel malt with a nice roasted background. Also some cherry smell. Taste gives a much more bitter blast than i was expecting from the smell. The roasted flavors come through especially strong. This bitterness hangs in the aftertaste. Full cloying mouthfeel. One of the nicer stouts that i've had in a while. Bear Republic puts out another winner, wish they were more available in the area."
"Drink it chickenheads!"
"Absolutely worth coming back to again and again."
"tasty as hell. if this was local I would definitely buy it more often. I get Old Rasputin and Perkuno's Hammer readily and enjoy them a hair more, but I would not be averse to picking this one up sometims as a change up in my standard RIS. A little thicker or creamier and this would slay. All in all a great example of the style, this one drinks too well also for the ABV, and isnt a total killer ABV compared to some. what can I say? I enjoyed this one a good deal."
"I'll probably give it another try someday based on its category ranking and the aforementioned peer reviews, but I'd go for something else if I wanted sure satisfaction."
"This is a pretty good strong stout."
"Definitely a tasty stout, worthy of a try."
"This was the first brew I tried from Bear Republic, and I am pleased. Very solid brew, and one I could see myself drinking quite often if it was available to me."
"Pours black, tinged with dark crimson highlights. Leaves a big foaming, bubbling mound of creamy head. Roasted smelling, coffee beans and dark chocolate all over the place. Taste is all smooth rich chocolate, malted sweetness, and roasted coffee goodness. Finishes with a crisp hop bite. Very nice, way too easy to drink for a rich, roasty stout that weighs in at this abv."
"The drinkability of this beer is very good. So tastey that you just want to keep drinking it and you could because the 8.1 is nowhere to be found...until it creeps up on you. This is an exceptional beer and I cant wait to pick up some more."
"The mouth feel was light to medium bodied with a full mouth of tiny bubbles. Over all, the dry coffee notes were a bit much, but the dynamics were fantastic. At $3.99 a bomber, this is a steal."
"Picture perfect jet with a tiny-bubbled head and loads of coating on the glass. Coffee and dark roasted barley all through the nose. Creamy dark chocolate and coffee flavors with a nice balancing hop presence to keep things from being too sweet. Mouthfeel is creamy and full. Very drinkable for the ABV. This is a keeper."
"The mouth is sturdy and substantial The sweetness cuts in to the drinakabilty a bit, but still an enjoyable beer. My wife really liked this one!"
"Overall a pretty good stout. I am not a stout fan in general, but this is a good one!"
"Pours very dark but not a slow as some Imperials. Looks flat at first but the head takes time to develop becoming a dark tan crust on top of the beer. The smell is not overly strong, with aromas of coffee beans and hints of chocolate. The taste starts out sweet with chocolate ovetones, then dry roasty coffee flavors come though in the finish. I'm not noticing much bitterness. Thick, full body, but not real chewy- it is quite smooth. Carbonation is great. Good enough to drink a few of these... Cheers..."
"D - This one hits me hard. Bottled, I remember it being more deceptive. Here I can taste the 8.1%. Almost couldn't finish my pint. Delicious, but something to savor in small quantities."
"I've really, really enjoyed Bear Republic brews so far and this one falls a bit because it's one-sided. This beer would be totally great with a bowl of chocolate ice cream, but it's unbalanced by itself."
"a really good, easy to sip strong stout. unfortunately, with the brashness of the competition, it may leave this one easily forgotten. but what do i know, it is in the top 100 afterall."
"A smooth and easy drinking beer, but a bit too far off the mark for an Imperial Stout. I doubt this would age well at all. The good thing about it was that the 8.1% ABV was certainly nowhere to be found in the taste. Went down easily."
"Drinkability: nice drinkability, could easily substitute for one of my three meals of the day."
"Beer is good. Happy hoppy RIS traded beering."
"D - Not bad. Since it is predominantly bitter, would work well with food. I wouldn't want to session it though."
"The finish is very clean for how full and chewy the beer is. Creamy, sweet, roasty goodness. A great beer and a great stout."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/2"" dark brown head above the almost opaque dark brown brew. Head lasts very nicely, with delicate lacing. Aroma is coffee, chocolate, and light piney hops. Taste is well-balanced, with mocha giving way to moderate hoppiness. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth, and drinkability is great as well. Don't know how I've missed this one this long, but I'll have to revisit again soon."
"taste doesn't disappoint. malty, sugary chocolate with a bittering aftertaste of piney hops and dark chocolate. incredibly drinkable."
"Drinkability is as good as any of this style. 2 bombers would be better than 1. The bitterness/hoppiness is not a barrier to drinkability as some can be."
"D- This beer has nice big rich dark grain flavors. There are no real dark fruit or lighter grain notes just big dark grains. The hop bitterness is mild but it lingers in the finish balancing the grain."
"(22 oz.)"
"This is like an amped-up Shakespeare that loses only a bit of its drinkability along the way. Bigger body and caramel sweetness, but certainly wonderful. One of the best stouts."
"Mouthfeel is chewy- very chewy, and full, and creamy. Just good. Quite drinkable for a stout, which is hard to do- good."
"Poured a very deep brown, almost black color with modest tannish head. Smell is a tantalizing mixture of coffee, cocoa, roasted grains, and a dark fruits. Taste is also very enjoyable with dark fruits (cherries, figs, dates, prunes) making themselves known along with chocolate and coffee. A nice hoppy bitterness arises at the finish along with an alcohol note. A very drinkable beer for 8.1%, almost too easy, because the alcohol sneaks up on you."
"Drinkability - Outstanding!! Long bitter finish. Smooth. Excellent as the beer approaches cellar temperature. Thanks to BA tryemall for the sample as this beauty is unfortunately not available around these parts."
"Full bodied and the immense amount of crystal malt gives a nice rounded, smooth finish. Very drinkable and very delicious."
"Ahem... this is... er... really, really fucking good..."
"Too bad I split the bomber with my girlfriend. Maybe I can snatch the rest from her. Anyway, the mouthfeel is a bit thin, which works well with the easy going flavor here, but I feel that it's just a tad too watery for my tastes. Very clean finish with only a little lingering hop bitterness to go along with the dark chocolate bitterness. It's nice to see that some brewers still emphasize a little restraint within this style, and that this beer is great despite not being way over the top."
"Very dark color with soft tan-colored head that is thick and foamy with excellent retention and even better lacing. Aromas of sugar and cocoa are most apparent. The taste is interesting and complex with a profile that contains a fair amount of hop bitterness. A lovely bittersweet finish that leaves behind just a slight sourness. Despite the high ABV, this beer is very easy to drink."
"Perfect drinkability here. Tasty and so easy to drink a Budweiser fan could drink this. This is basically a terrific chocolate beer milkshake. I love this stuff and will buy much much more."
"overall: pretty good double stout, but i'm not too sure what all the hype is about. everything about this beer is better at close to room temperature. mouthfeel is lacking, but improves with warmth. pretty good aroma and flavor. excellent try and i won't turn one down, but there are better out there. thanks a bunch to mlh1227 for sending me this."
"Thanks MDS!"
"Slàinte!"
"Drinkability. Wow. Very well done, perhaps now my favorite of the style, whatever you want to call it. I could get into a lot of trouble with this seemingly innocent 8+% stout. Yum!"
"Picked it up at Chicone's Liquor in Hudson with getting New Glarus Belgian Red--I'll pick up another bottle of Big Bear the next time I'm there."
"22 oz bottle. Pours a viscous, oily black, thin tan lacing recedes from a fluffy head. Sweet chocolatey aroma blends with a fresh floral hop aroma. Sampled after only about 30 minutes in the fridge, this is quite the complex stout. Black coffee, bakers chocolate...sweeter butterscotch in the finish. Vanilla. Lingering hop bitterness. Very roasty with notes of espresso. Alcohol is well hidden, carbonation is mild. An excellent American Imperial."
"The mouthfeel is thick, not too syrupy. Has a dry moderate alcohol finish. This is a great example of the style, and I'm sure I would drink another, but not consecutively; afterall... I wouldn't want to get mauled, as the label says."
"Drinkability: I was hoping for a gigantic stout when I got home from work today, and I was happily appeased."
"The bomber was gone before I knew. Big alcohol that is disguised well."
"This bomber is going down way too easily. Wish I had a second one..."
"Pure black with a brown head, which diminished quickly for an imperial stout. Aroma of coffee, molasses, and brown sugar. Thick, chewy mouth feel. Flavor is malty, with brown sugar and molasses sweetness blended with bittersweet chocolate. Moderately hopped for the style. I could drink this all night."
"Super effort, doesn't quite hit all the notes to get full marks, but will drink any chance I get!"
"Overall Impression: The grapefruit is a bit much, but overall the beer is very drinkable. Thanks to Weedchugger for sharing the bounty of his great state."
"As the name implies, this beer pours a beautiful black color with a thick tan head. Excellent lace. The smell and taste of coffee abounds with hints of chocolate and lots of malt. One of my favorite things about this beer is its thickness in my mouth. I can feel the thickness as I role my tongue through it. A great beer that will defiantly be in my future beer experiences."
"under 4 dollars for an amazing imperial stout like this? Fuck the 7 dollar great divide Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout. This is mine."
"Opaque black with a small tan head and nice lacing. Roasty aroma of chocolate, big time nuts, and light dried fruits. Very chocolately and roasty with some nice hops for balance. Very drinkable here as no alcohol is noticed. A very nice stout, thanks Eyedrinkale!!"
"Flavors of Chocolate, caramel,molasses and dark roasted barley. Dark fruits (prunes and figs) and some esthers with a good finish of lingering hop bitterness. Medium body and a dextrinous mouthfeel. Big Bear Black is a delicious well balanced. A must try."
"Not the thickest stout I've ever had by any stretch but just fine attention to detail. Coffee with slight chocolate taste . slightly oily mouthfeel that is pleasant and it actually finishes a perfect malt then cleansing..."
"Holy (explitive)!!! This is my 1 year BA aniverary review too."
"Mouthfeel is tingly on the tongue throughout the entire sip, pretty round, but could be a little fuller for my tastes. Pretty drinkable, a great sipper. Thanks to cvschaller for sending this one my way."
"A great beer, but maybe just a little rough around the edges. I had it on tap before and it was much milder all around, which seems to be typical of my past experience with tap versus bottled beers. I love Bear Republic. It falls in my top three breweries that I would love to see move into Kansas."
"Drinkability is pretty good. I enjoyed this brew."
"Pours black with some fiery amber highlights when held to the light. Nice 3/4"" creamy tan head that fades to a swirly coating with some decent lacing. Nose is more subtle than I had expected - dark fruits, some bittering hops, and faint coffee at the end. The taste is also much more subtle than I would have thought -dark fruits, some citrus, mild hops and the faintest choco/coffee roastiness to balance out the hops. The alcohol is almost not noticible on the palate, a very well-hidden 8.1% abv. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, but still refreshing along with solid carbonation on this ungodly hot Wisconsin night. I can feel the alcohol warming me, which I don't really need at this point, but I'm still enjoying this beer. Not mind-blowing, but very solid."
"Overall impression: A highly drinkable stout that is deceptively strong. Nice balanced flavors make this a joy - now off to finish off the bomber with a cigar!"
"Well, after two crappy beers tonight, Im ready for something decent. Bomber provided by Eyedrinkale ala BIF20. Thanks much for the opportunity. Pours a brown/tan one-finger head over a very dark liquid. Dark brown-red edgings when held to light. Smells potently of coffee/roasted grains that are countered by a sweet toffee. There is also a sour (from black patent). Tastes sweet and of rich chocolate, some coffee, and the sour of cherry that indicates a heavy hand of black patent. During the swallow, hop aromatic begins and there is an alcohol sting. Aftertaste is phenomenal. Waves of caramel and coffee rising on a backbone of chocolate. Thick creamy mouthfeel and mildly carbonated."
"The only semi-complaint that I have is that the mouthfeel is a bit thin for something with a flavor this big. I feel like it could stand to be a bit thicker to stand up to the big taste and ABV. That said, it's an incredibly drinkable stout for its power, and part of that is probably due to its light mouthfeel. I don't love this one the way I do BR""s Racer 5, but it's a good stouf."
"Very dark brown, basically opaque, topped by a huge, light brown, creamy head. Great lacing and excellent retention. Rich, malty aroma with lots of chocolate and some molasses. Roasted and nutty provide some depth as well. Ripe fruit and alcohol are just noticeable. The flavour is big and malty, as expected, some dark chocolate, roasted and a bit of burnt under it all. Bitterness and hop flavour are present, but mainly provide balance to the malt. Finishes with mild alcohol warmth and a nice balance of malt and bitterness. Creamy texture, full body and medium carbonation. Very slight astringency from the dark malts. Great drinkability, I could drink this all night. Another great beer from Bear Republic and an excellent beer for my 300th review."
"The head and lacing on this brew are fantastic. Tiny bubbles race up the sides of the glass. This nose is big and chocolatey with its fair share of coffee and molasses. Now don't get me wrong this is a big stout, but the mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy, not as sticky or oily as most double or imperial stouts. The hops taste fruity and compliment the milk chocolate and java very well. Now allegedly this stuff is 8.1% abv, but I wouldn't mind drinking this like other people can throw back Guinness."
"Pours an opaque black with red around the edges, medium tan head, good lacing on the glass. Roasted malts are right at the front of the nose, some hop presence is noticable behind, with a sweet fruity aroma as well. Taste is dark fruits, roasted malt, chocolate and coffee, like a souped up version of their Tribute Brown ale. Nice and hoppy, with some fruitiness near the end. Excellent stout, very very smooth and creamy, very excellent. Thanks DrJay for the import."
"This beer is good, it pours out dark black with a brown head. It smells of chocolate, coffee, and a faint nutty smell. The taste is spectacular! It tastes of coffee, caramel, dark fruits(plum, black cherry, chocolate dipped raspberries). Def one of the best stouts I've tasted. Would pair well with dark chocolate fruit such as strawberries, def a dessert beer IMO."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and thick. Coats the mouth well. Filling like a stout should be. Drinkability is good to boot, a good thick heavy feeling that probably wouldn't dissuade most from finishing the bomber."
"Drinkability- Can't taste the 8% for the life of me. Had to share the bottle, but felt none of it after 12oz or so. Wishing I had the whole bottle to myself. Awesome stout I will be having again for sure."
"Pours a pitch black with a solid two fingers of coffee colored head with good retention and lots of lacing. Smell is of dark chocolate, roasted malts, caramel, and hops. Taste has a very strong assertive roasted malt backbone, with hints of coffee, almond, and chocolate, and just a little hint of the alcohol. Medium bodied with a medium/low carbonation and a very dry finish, this beer has a very nice feel. This is an absolutely wonderful double stout---enjoyed every moment of it, could easily drink these all the time."
"Very drinkable for the style."
"Overall, a good imp stout. It reminded me of Left Hands Oak-Aged, but wasn't quite as good."
"Too bad flavor didn't live up to the aroma. Good nonetheless."
"Definately a nice find for the price."
"D - I could drink this for breakfast everyday and not feel guilty."
" This brewery has yet to fail me."
"Big Bear is certainly not a brash bear. Black Stout dominates its territory and gets the job done without being tearing up the local palates."
"This stout is a rare Imperial much like Stone's that has all the huge flavours come together in a silky smooth slighty vinous melange. No one note pops its thorny head above the others but rather the whole is greater than the parts. Complex, way too drinkable, this stout is one of the best."
"This is an easy drinking well balanced stout. It hides the 8% alcohol very well."
"This is a solid beer, but I have to say I like their other beers more. Maybe it's just me but this beer seemed just a little too sweet or flavored. Anyway... as suggested by the label the beer pours big and black, with a foamy brown head. Decent amount of hops in there for a stout, but this is mainly a malty explosion. Lots of flavors in there, and I guess I'm nitpicking but it as I said it was a bit too sweet and a little to coffee-ish for me. Slick and kind of flat mouthfeel. A solid but not exceptional beer."
"Big Bear Black is great beer, but would benefit from being more classically stout-like. Even I need a break from overwhelming hops once in a while. As hard as it is to believe, sometimes I just wanna be 'mauled by malt', to paraphrase the BR website. Can't decide between a hop monster IPA and a darkly chocolatey double stout? Bear Republic has placed both in one bomber for your convenience and your drinking pleasure."
"Pours out very dark brown with a tan head. Roasted malt aroma with chocolate and a good amount of hops, which I always like in a stout. Flavor pretty much follows from the aroma. There is a crispness to this beer that is not found in most stouts. Medium mouthfeel. As some reviewers have pointed out, this is not an Imperial Stout. It is very tasty, and went well with some chocolate."
"Pours a dark crimson, burnt black color with a tan colored fizzy head. Smells of chocolatey malts, espresso, spicy hops. Taste is very chocolatey and bitter from the black malts and spicy hops. Taste reminds me a lot of a porter. Taste is very smooth, kind of light on the mouth, but this stout is so decieving. I would never be able to detect the 8% alcohol. Because of the light mouthfeel and decieving alcohol content this is probably the most drinkable stout of this caliber I have ever had."
"Thanks again skyhand!"
"Drinkability and Overall: This is an exceptional beer. I don't agree that it's a stout, but who gives a shit. All that matters is that this is a well balanced and damn tasty brew. Labels and styles only go so far, but at some point you have to drop all that and just let the beer speak to you. And when I did that, this beer left me breathless. Thanks to GClarkage for the brew. Truly above and beyond the average beer."
"Deep black in color. Very small tight tan head that is gone instantly. Low aroma-burnt currants,some chocolate and toffeeish. Big upfront and assertive flavor-roasted malt,some anise and a very slight smoke flavor. Good body. A damn fine beer-double stout? Dont see it-certainly not imperial but Id call it a stout and leave it at that. Well worth enjoying."
"Bottle. Very classy stuff. Full mouthfeel. nicely chocolatey, with and off-dry finish. Decent amount of hops in there, but pretty well balanced. One of my favourite beers on my US trip. Rich, yet quite soft as well, exceptional stout, probably one of the best i've ever had the pleasure of trying. Extrememly yummy."
"This beer pours like oil. Very black with a brown thick head. The head fades slowly leaving a moderate amount of laces. This beer smells strongly of hops. It smelt quite floral. It also had a chocolate smell. It tasted like coffee and burnt malts. The hops are apperent. There is a slight caramel and toffee flavor to it. It also tastes sweet. It is quite a robust beer. It is full bodied with a good amount of carbonation. This beer might not be the best session beer. It is not too high in alcohol, for a stout, but the flavor is a little off for a night of drinking. In small doses this beer is very good. It could maybe use a little less hop aroma though. It is a stout, not an IPA. Definately worth drinking though."
"Burnt raspberry jams, rosemary, molasses. A bubbly numbness settles in. Burnt vanilla bean bread, or is that a dark chocolate milkshake? Man, it's good. Finishes with jams."
"Poured black as night with a 3 inch tan head that is leaving a splotchy lacing down my glass. Nose is of caramel malts and a hint of coffee. Taste is a caramely coffee with just a dash of bittering hops at the finish, extremely smooth! Mouthfeel is full and refreshing. This is brewing perfection in terms of drinkability. No evidence of the 8.1 ABV, extremely smooth, with just the right amount of hops. If you are a stout fan you have to try this one!"
"This seems almost too light and soft in the mouth. On the other hand, that probably helps out with the drinkability, which is very good."
"This stout pours a nice dark color. There was a very nice large foamy head which lasted for a relatively long time. The smell was pleasant: nice and malty aroma. The taste was a bit disappointing, with limited flavor. It is slightly above average in drinkability. If you enjoy a stout then you should certainly give this beer a try, perhaps your palate will enjoy it more than mine."
"Notes: The label has the words ""black"" in big bold letters across the front, this is no lie. I am glad that on the label the brewery makes no claims of the superiority of this brew. It is only a ""black stout"" until you pour it out and taste it. this is a fine example of stout beer."
"Poured out black, black, black...did i mention this was black :) When held to the light i could make out some very slight ruby tones and the head was a decent 1/2 inch. Smell was big roasted malts with hints of coffee and very slight caramel tones. Taste was all roasted malts up front with a slightly bitter-sweet finish and left a nice sweet after taste that lingered. As it warmed i could feel a bit more of the alcohol in the throat but it was well hidden overall. Mouthfeel was fairly robust and I would say full body-ish. Very easy to drink and a pleasure at that. I would definitnely pick one of these up again. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
"Deep black color with a thick tan head that settles quickly to a light lace on the side of the glass. Sweet aroma. Toffee, and chocolate in the nose in addition to the roasted malt. Same flavors that I found in the nose along with a bit of hop flower and a pleasant tartness. Slightly oily mouth feel along with a nice warming. Good drinkability. For the 8% punch that this beer packs, it is remarkably balanced. Another great offering from this brewery."
"Largely black in hue and basically opaque but when I held it to a light I could see some ruby highlights. The color of the liquid is lovely. The head was russet in color, about two fingers in height at its highest point. Head retention was very good; it slowly faded to a clumpy, bubbly cap that was fairly thick around the edges. This cap lasted the entire consumption. There was plenty of sticky, unorganized, subsequent lacing. The lacing was akin to tattered wallpaper. The appearance, on the whole, is excellent. The nose doesnt really contain that massive thumping, boastful roasted malt. The roasted malt is more secondary, it is found in the middle and it offers some char and coffee vibes. Upfront is a soft arrangement of cream and brown sugar. At the back are stiff notes of alcohol heat, kisses of molasses too. The hops are vaguely noticeable every third sniff or so (I wasnt really counting a ratio but I didnt smell them every time). Soft. Rounded. The nose does not impress me, there are plenty of muted yet pleasant aromas but this isnt very boastful for a stout of this sort. Dont get me wrong the bouquet is inviting. The palate does offer more than the nose but not enough for me to consider this beer great, very good at best. The creamy, espresso infused with milk flavor is a bit too strong; I wanted a louder, truer roast. Oh well. This softness makes me believe this beer is weaker than need be. The palate is very mellow, heavy on chocolate milk, light on bitterness. Hell, it is light on astringency too. Not much from the hops. There were some random influences of dark fruit. The abv is very well hidden, I could smell a tickle of alcohol in the nose but I dont taste anything. Amazing considering the 8.1% abv. I do feel the alcohol in my belly and on my brain. Mmm warm. Overall the palate is mellow and relaxing. It doesnt remind me of the typical Double American Stout. I wonder if only the alcohol content is truly big enough to be considered a Double Stout. Even if I looked at this beer as just a Stout it wouldnt be that big of a beer. Regardless this beer is tasty but Im not impressed. I like it but Im not wowed. Somewhat fuller than medium in body, the carbonation is moderate but appropriate for this beer, I like the mouthfeel it is kind of lazy but its not sluggish. It allows the flavors to lie on my tongue so I can soak them in. Satisfying. I do see a time and a place for this beer. If I wanted a tasty but mellow stout Id gladly drink this. If I didnt want to rip my tastebuds to pieces but I wanted to enjoy a good (and simple) quaff, Id drink this. I enjoyed my bomber with some Colby cheese and light crackers. Simple food, simple beer it was a tasty combination. Easy enough to enjoy but its nothing special, I like it fine. Yummy. I purchased a bomber in Milwaukee, WI. Worth a try."
"Taste is so creamy and smooth, its hard to believe this beer is 8.1% ABV. Awesome stout. I'm impressed...recommended"
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for sharing this one. Pours a very dark color with almost no head, therefore it doesn't leave any lacing either. The aroma has a lot of coffee and dark baking chocolate. The flavor was very similar to the aroma - chocolate flavors with a bitter coffee finish. Mouthfeel was very thick, as expected. Nice brew."
"Really nice."
"22 oz. bottle conditioned bomber. BR Big Bear pours opaque and sits in my glass like a pristine black beauty. The silky smooth liquid produces a rocky pock-marked head that fades to a tight, persistent layer. The lacing is thick and chunky, outstanding. Dark roasted black malt, molasses, freshly roasted coffee beans make up the aroma. Translate those aromas to liquid form and add a healthly dose of leafy, earthy hops, a touch of dark semi-sweet chocolate and presto, there you have this rich black nectar. The perfect brew to take this chill out of the recent coldspell that's beset the Northeast. A bit of warming Christmas cheer indeed."
"Drinkability - the alcohol is hidden quite well and the beer is superior on all fronts. Worth having again."
"Roasted malt, caramel, and cocoa aroma. Decent, chestnut colored head leaves a couple specs of lace. Dark cola colored beer with a ruby hue. Lots of dark malt in the flavor, a bit roasted/burnt, seems dry at first, but the beer is mildly sweet. Definitely some hops in there, kind of reminds me of fresh storm king. It's got hoppy chocolate marshmallow finish to it. Body is fairly thick, the flavors stick to your tongue yet it still goes down quick. I think the finish is the best part. By the time I put the beer down I want more!"
"This beer poured a deep brown/black wtih no head or ring. The nose was dark chocolate with hints of coffee. Smells nice. The flavor started a nice chocolate and finished coffe, with a good residual bitter that was not offensive. The feel was moderate to thick, what I expect for the style. The beer was overall, very good. I really enjoyed the bitter bite at the end of it."
"Reflection: This is an average American stout. If you know someone who is just starting out trying different styles of beer, this would be a great one to throw at them for a stout."
"Head is a velvety, toffee brown and bumpy. Swoopy, sheety lacing. Clear, dark brown beer. Lots of powdery cocoa in the nose plus caramel, chocolate and some milk. The front is milky sweet. Milk chocolate in the foamy, creamy middle. Bitter, bitter chocolate and some peas in the finish. There are some nice, roasty nuts in the aftertaste and a little charcoal. Imperial or Double? Dunno. But it's a nice, sweet stout. The alcohol is completely buried. Good."
"I've been keeping one of these babies in the cellar for about a year and decided to crack it yesterday(Thanksgiving). Pours pitch black but allows just a little light through which is strange for a ""double"" stout. Smells of roasted grains, dark coffe, and bitter-sweet chocolate. I was told this was a hoppy stout but this is not evident in the smell. Tastes as good as it smells. Full of roasty, toasty malty goodness that we love in a good stout. Hops are more evident in the finish but are subdued due to a year in the cellar. Alcohol is well hidden--maybe cuz all I've been drinking lately are crazy-strong barleywines and my taste-buds are fried!"
"This dark beer pours black with a fairly thin brown head. When held up to light, the faintest amount is able to pierce through creating a few ruby highlights to break up the darkness. The aroma is chocolate with a bit of roasted malt. These 2 aromas are brought along by a nice blast of hops aroma. This smells like it will be a good one. The taste certainly doesn't let you down. Initially there's bittersweet chocolate with a subtle sweetness. Shortly, the sharply roasted malts join in with an exquisite bitterness. This bitterness from the roasted malt is shortly joined by a small amount of hop bitterness. The finish is dry and very clean. The alcohol makes itself known as it warms your stomach. The aftertaste intermingles all the flavors and adds a touch of espresso. The alcohol also coats your tongue a bit along with a bit of astringency. The mouthfeel is nice and full. The carbonation level is fairly light, just right for the style. This is an easily drinkable imperial stout. Very tasty, very dangerous."
"Drinkability is high. Goes down very smoothly. Afrementioned combination of flavors and feels produces a really enjoyable beer."
"Pours with a nice micro-bubbled tan head that settles on top of opaque blackish-red liquid. Nice dark fruit and roasty nose. Flavors of bittersweet chocolates, sweet malt, light coffee and a good hop bitterness. Can't say I can taste/feel any alcohol here. Finshes chocolatey and roasty in a long drawn out lingering finish...lip-smacking good!"
"Drinkability: It depends what you like. If you like a sweet, mild stout, this ain't it. If you like your stouts bitter and robust, this is a star. Biting, hoppy, a bit crisp, maybe a tad rough, but good stuff."
"A rich, deep, earthy stout with a great coffee-flavored finish. It poured black in color with a thick stubborn head I head to wade through to get at the beer. Where the light was able to penetrate through the beer it shown a rich, chocolate brown. The flavor had hints of chocolate, hazelnuts and coffee. The coffee flavor lasted through the finish and was also very present in the beer's aroma. A great slow-sipping beer that I enjoyed on a cold autumn day with my BBQ ribs."
"Pours black with red highlights with chocolate tan head. Aroma is sweet chocolate, expresso, molasses hints with light alcohol and citrusy hops. Nice sweet and roasted smelling with enough hops thrown in that you know it will have a decent kick. Taste is smooth creamy roasted malt, coffee and chocolate flavors flow around the taste buds imparting sweet nectar followed by a fruity hoppy flavor leaving a lasting bitterness. A drinkable stout that is smooth and creamy but doesn't seem to heavy strange. Mouthfeel is not bad smooth but seems a little to light for some reason. Drinkability is good nice example of a great style."
"Pours a deep dark black with a mocha colored creamy head,big hop presence in the aroma for the style zesty and nutty with a little moch a coffee thrown in very nice.Wow where to begin on the flavors in this bad boy very creamy feel in the mouth, drier than expected some unsweetened chocolate and nutty earthiness with a background of zesty,spicey hop.Alot going on and way to easy to drink for the alc% every flavor u could want in a beer with a smooth creamy mouthfeel,just awesome."
"I have had stouts that are able to pull off a rough mixture of flavors, but is not one of them. Its crudely flavored and one-dimensional. Bottom line: I was so unmotivated to finish this concoction that I gave it to my dog (the one that likes beer). She liked it, and does have a discriminating palate for a pooch."
"Ursus americana is a formidable drinking parner, pours a dense, black-brown body with a think tan head (most wild bears have a black head). Smells of mmmm....roasted barley, sweet rum-raisin pudding, chocolate, and bitter northwoods cabin percolater coffee. Shit! He just took a swipe at me with his delicious, frothy, yet dangerous paw! Tastes of sweet, roasted malt, accented with raisin juice and rummy alcohol. Turns bitter quickly with obvious, does-a-bear-shit-in-the-woods hop presence (cascade?). The effect is of strong espresso and bittersweet, dark chocolate into the finish. Full, chewy mouthfeel. Very hoppy stout, like SN and Rogue IS, and very well made."
"long burnt coffe finish."
"of the five bear republic brews i've sampled, i expected at least one to blow me away. while all very good, very solid brews, none did, but the big bear (along with maybe, and surprisingly the xp pale ale) came the closest. this one pours a nice dark brown colour with hints of amber shining through. the head was big, creamy and foamy with nice sticky qualities. if anything, i thought this one looked a bit thin for a double stout, but still fine nonetheless. the smell is of sweet chocolate, malt and hints of coffee in the back. maybe a touch of alcohol too. very basic, but very good. the taste and mouthfeel were really outstanding. a creamy chocolate goodness stretches throughout. a touch of roasted coffee and malt is present, though nicely subdued. alcohol can barely (and i mean barely) be detected. you wouldn't think 8.1% abv if you didn't know. this one is just so smooth and creamy. it's quite a delight to drink. like i said, a tasty brew that wasn't far from blowing me away, but also wasn't quite there. easily recommended."
"The color is very dark. The aromas are a boozy blend of coffee, chocolate, dark rum, nutmeg and charred fruit pits. On the palate it is rich, slick and inundated with flavors of rum-soaked raisins, roasted hay, ancho chiles and sweet alcohol. The finish is dry and punctuated with charcoal bitterness. I doubt freezing did any damage to the specimen -- the worst thing would be its effect on dissolved gas, and that does not seem like a problem here. In any case, the excess of raw and burnt grain combined with simple sugar and alcohol flavors prevent this from earning top scores. Not bad; and certainly a ""big"" beer, for those who obsess about such things."
"22 oz. bomber. Pours deep brown with some ruby highlights around the edges of the glass. Fluffy tan head. Modest dark grain aromas, dark chocolate, toffee, and chicory. Surprisingly, I'm picking up a lot of grassy and piney hops, too. The finish affirms this, there is a boatload of West Coast hops in there. Most of your roasty, malty, caramelly sweetness is up-front, smoothness (a touch of oat?) in the middle, but the oily, high-alpha dry finish keeps this monster drinkable. Higher ABV is masked quite nicely. One of the better stouts I've had recently."
"Wyll-"
"Pours the usual stout black with a moderate coffee colored head. Good lacing. Smells so nice. Lots of molasses and cherry. Really wonderful even with my seasonal allergies. Tastes like the stout fairy cam to town. Big gobs of sweet caramel, cherry, molasses, coffee and fig blow up in your oral cavity. The sweetness borders on cloying at times so I couldn't give it huge marks for taste, otherwise it's really well done. Mouthfeel is large and drinkability is high. Alcohol is extremely well hidden. Get you some."
"Finger and a half of tan head - very tight knit. Ruby light shines through in the thinnes part of the tapered glass. Nothing else visible but pitch black. Very sweet nose and wine/stone fruit. Raiseny, resinous. Nice hop smell behind the sweetness. Sweet first draw with the impression of ash smells and tasts in the mouth. Smokyness lingers after sweetness recedes. Hop aste present but hidden behind the sweetness. A little sweet for me, but a nice sipper. Mouthfeel is great - full and creamy."
"stout hopped up.and chocolate malt and very bitter. . Quenched the thirst and then some. Astringent, great with meat and salad. Had on tap a year later and licorice aroma prevalent. Beautiful black appearance. Good carbonation. A top notch stout and a top notch brewery.."
"One of the best I've had. Several different flavors are blended together very well. Wish I'd bought more."
"This is a great stout, pours a ruby dark oil black with a caramel tan head that is amazing to look at, also hop sediment lingering in the glass. The smell is of wild hops are coffee beans with hints of dark ghiradelli. The taste is wild, hoppy, very hoppy, unusual for a stout but works well with the chocolate/caramel sweetness. Espresso hints warm the soul. Very good, medium bodied, highly drinkable, I love the hops."
"ng"
"There are elite versions of this style and then there are somewhat great versions. This beer is at the lower tier of the elite."
"This is an exceptional stout! It poured a very very dark brown with a small brownish head that soon settled into a creamy layer of foam leaving slight lace down my glass. The smell was great with a great roasted maltiness and hints of carmel. The flavor was stunning and sweeter than I was expecting, but it all worked wonderfully. The roasted malt flavor created a great semi-sweet flavor and there was a slight smokiness in the finnish that really topped it off. The mouthfeel was smoothe and creamy and there was absoloutly no hint of the %8.10 abv. Another winner from Bear Republic!"
"Black with a moderate tan head that quickly dissapates and leaves a nice lace. The aroma is coffee with subtle hints of chocolate. The taste is coffee with semi sweet chocolate. Very malty. Very smooth. This is perfect for a cold day. I had it with dutch apple pie and it worked perfectly."
"Pours black, true to its name, with a hoppy aroma mixed with roasted malts. There's also an odd touch of a sort of sea salt aroma. Very well attenuated, not much of a thick body for such a strong stout. Lots of bubbles, but didn't foam too much. Finish is quite long with some mammoth bitterness played against some burnt chocolate bits and espresso like flavors. Wow, what a long finish! It's more delicate up front, almost sweetish, but the bitterness kicks in not too soon after and it's scorched earth (or should I say scorched malt) not much later. A bit harsh, but fortunately I like the bitterness. It's almost over the top with espresso flavors and bitter hops. Could be more complex, but a decent stout.. It's almost like a Guinness on steroids; has the body of dry stout but the strength of an Imperial."
"It pours an opaque, deep dark, black with a ligth brown head. The aroma has a lot of roasted grains and chocolate and some caramel. It is robust and full bodied with coffee and chocolate notes. It is sweet and malty and finishes with a sligth citrus bitterness."
"Well, I must admit that if I look at this as an Imperial stout, it seems a bit underwhelming. But I'm reviewing this on its own, and this is a fantastic beer, and that's what's important! A nice richness, and this is a beer that I would absolutely have again."
"22 ounce bottle."
"Pours with a two-finger brown head that fades slowly and leaves a good lace. Black as midnight. Good carbonation. Nose is coffee/caramel. Strong hickory flavor, nice beefy stout but not as dry as a Guinness. The high ABV is not noticeable. $4.60 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"22oz brown bomber. This pours a nice opaque black color with and excellent tan light brown head. The head slowly fades away leaving a lacing about the glass. The aroma is very rich with a roasted coffee and dark chocolate scent that is mouthwatering. There is also the smell of a slight sweetness. Its starts off tasting of coffee and roasted malt with a touch hop for some balance. Then has a dry dark chocolate finish with a slight bitterness. There are also notes of dark fruits to be had in this brew, no traces of alcohol in the taste. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, you couldnt really ask for more. This is an excellent imperial stout that is highly drinkable and I would love to try on tap. I could defiantly drink more of these than I should with the high alcohol."
"Another top notch beer from Bear Republic."
"Poured black with a rich tan head. Wonderful intermingling of hop and malt aroma. Tastes of roasted bitterness, subtly sweet malt and a warming alcohol. Exceptionally balanced and drinkable. I'll be ordering a few more pints of this for sure."
"The beer pours a deep black color with a thick tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich dark malt scent that boasts of black roasted and chocolate malts. It smells sweet with a dry finish. The taste is good. It has an intense black malt flavor and dry malty finish that leaves a black type aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. It goes down smooth and warms the throat. This is an excellent stout with great flavor; a good sessions brew."
"A good Imperial Stout of brash hops but enough malty goodness to balance. Good drinkability is par for Bear Republic yet again."
"This is an excellent stout for a hophead. It drinks like a champ too."
"Very nice looking pour with a rich bronze head. The nose is lightly roasted . Great taste of dark chocolate, roasted malt and hints of vanilla bean. Smooth coffee notes with nice hoppiness showing its face on the finish. A very rich, smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Excellent stout."
"This is an absolutely beautiful beer. I could drink pint after pint of this. The alcohol is exceptionally concealed. In many ways it reminds me of Old Rasputin, with it's wonderful complexity and exquisite balance. The flavors are perfectly in union here. This brew has everything going for it...wonderful look, aroma, taste, mouthfeel and drinkability. Dangerously drinkable and highly recommended!"
"It pours thick and black, with slight reddish tinge. The aroma is full of an intense roasted barley character. Coffee and licorice smell with a hint of alcohol and piney hops. Resinous and only slightly sweet. From the mid-taste through the finish, the beer is dominated by west coast hops. Full, fresh, and moderately bitter. Somewhat dry. I could drink this one all night long."
"Be careful."
"This is an exceptional brew! Appearance was extremely inviting...black with a very nice head. The smell was of coffee and smoke in a beautiful balance. The taste was outstanding!!! Smoooth....coffee,,,burnt malt...ending in a great hop dryness. Equal parts of each made it a sensory experience. Mouthfeel was full-bodied and rich...abv very deceiving. The nice dry finish made me go back for another glass. A definite Top 50 brew."
"This Imperial Stout poured an opaque black color with creamy, brown foam that persisted but eventually settled. The smell was a lightly sweet malty and roasted barley aroma; nicely pungent. The taste was rich and malty with flavors of caramel and coffee and roasted barley and with a hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel was smooth, creamy, and rich with full body and moderate carbonation. This was a great Imperial Stout! Not ""over the top"" in any way, but just all around very good."
"drinkability...good bear...grrr."
"Pours a dark black color that is crowned by a prodigious thick, creamy, deep brown head. Strong aromas of coffee, treacle, chocolate, a floral hoppiness, and perhaps some citrus. This has a great thick, creamy mouthfeel, yet it still is light and smooth at the same time. The beer finishes sweet with roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee flavors. This beer is so silky smooth as it goes down. The roast character, that is here, is missing all of the harsh astringent flavors that are often found in a stout, and this is a good thing. This is a very well integrated, very well balanced beer. I must say that Bear Republic continues to impress me."
"This beer is very good when compared to every beer but compared to Imperial Stouts, especially California Imperials, it is mediocre."
" This was a beautiful stout to stare at in the glass, from beginning to end. Robust, and smooth, with the surprising flavors of tart cherries and smoked almonds joining the roasty coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and standout, funky, hops appearance. A wonderful brew here, that should be a ""top twenty"" selection."
"d tasting, thanks Hopsrus Very dark body wearing a film beige head. Aroma is of restrained intensity, lightly hoppy, resinous and piney with mild coffee notes. Mouth entrance hits you with a little raw sugar moment which is swiftly followed by brown sugar and caramel maltiness. Again, rapidly, cascade hops take control leading to a dry hoppy finish (resin, pine, coniferous) paired with a classic slightly citric acidity. Body is medium with considerable carbonation for the style. Straight to the point west coast stuff."
"Served a deep dark black with a thick tan head. Mouthfeel is thick and wonderful just like stout should be. Tastes big and malty, with some wonderful roasty thangs going on. Overall a solid stout on tap and worth every penny."
"Nicely labeled 22oz bottle. Pours a dark opaque glass with a pretty robust head for a stout. Coffee and malt nose. Taste is strong. Dark chocolate, strong coffee, burnt, pretty hoppy some sweetness through all this. Good balanced mouthfeel. Alchohol is not noticible. A little strong and bitter for me, otherwise a good beer."
"Pours a very, very dark amber. Light only peeks through if you make an attempt to see it. Head is low and tan, settling easily. Smell is mostly of black patent malt, I think, but there is also an intriguing kind of sweetness present. Taste is fairly straightforward, and infinitely enjoyable. Nice roasted malts over sweet caramel malts. A very nice, smooh, dark flavor prevails, leading to a subdoed hop flavor. A bold brew, but delicately balanced, and for that reason it suits any occasion. The alcohol content is hardly noticable, despite being 8.1%."
"This is a muscular stout with lots of lace trailing behind an enduring head of thick tan froth. A spike of bitterness defines the middle palate where a few intermittent off notes threaten to poke through. On the whole though, Black Bear is eminently drinkable. A pleasure."
"Full creamy smooth body, Astringent coats the mouth with a roasted taste. Would go great with BBQ or smoked food."
"Bomber bottle, this one was enjoyed at near room temp. in a goblet. jet Black with a frothy dark head. Gobs of rich malty, coffee odors in the nose. Chocolate, caramel,toffee, roasted malt, dark bread flavors in the first few sips. This a rich and chewy brute of a beer. Bittering comes along late in the profile, but smoothes things out and joins in the fun towards a long and flavorful finish. Full body, lots of flavors and complexity.Coating mouthfeel and sumptious in every way. This is to be savored and enjoyed over and over. I'll be buying more of this stuff next chance I get."
"Nice chewy ""mouthfull"" is rich and creamy. Easy to drink, but like these guys say: easy to get ""mauled."""
"Flavor is smooth with a light sweet caramel up front but the coffee takes over and leaves a slight bitter coffee taste in my mouth. I dont want to attribute this to hops since I get coffee first and foremost. This is a big robust stout that is very tasty and smooth."
"22oz. bomber poured into a tulip-style glass. Pours a deep black color with two fingers of medium tan head. There is a fair amount of lacing left. The smell is very hoppy for a stout. The floral hops really jump out at you. There is plenty of rich roasted malt in the smell to keep it all balanced out though. The taste starts with burnt malt, toffee, and a little coffee. Also a hint of chocolate and brown sugar in there as well. The finish is fairly hoppy, maybe cascades? The mouthfeel is fairly thick and heavy. The drinkability is fairly good as well for an 8.1% beer. A damn good imperial, and a great bargain!"
"Finally had a bottle of this and it is my favorite Imperial now. Black as night with a lasting tan head that left solid lace. Aroma is subtle roastiness with chocolate malt. Exceptional smooth roasted tast with solid malt, a bit of alcohol can be detected, but not overpowering like some others. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side but does an Imperial have to be like drinking 30 weight oil? This went down incredibly easy and didn't fry me. I have to find more!"
"Drinkability: A great benchmark for the style. Hits the right notes, I think there are better imperial stouts out there (SK and BBCS spring immediately to mind)."
"A solid 'A' in my book."
"Drinkability: A very good stout, but a bit underwhelming IMHO. Not as big as I was expecting. Worth a try if you can find it."
"On tap at the Lucky Lab in Multnomah Village. Arrived with an espresso-foam colored head. The brew itself appear to be only nearly black, not quite black as the name implies...I know this conflicts with the previous reviews, but this is what I observed. It smelled mostly of roasty chocolate malts, with a tad of floral hoppiness to top it off...promising. The taste was big, with dark chocolate and smooth cola flavors with a bouncy bitter finish rounding it all off quite nicely. The stout was full and satisfying. The drinkability was good, due to the smoother cola tones. The alcohol was completely hidden. Overall a very good and kickin' stout, for big beer lovers."
"Maybe a little hoppy for a stout, but good complexity, and still goes down pretty smooth."
"Great smell of roasted coffee beans and chocolate. Really nice light brown head with good lacing. Man is this one rich and delicious. First flavor that I got was packed with espresso beans and dark roast coffee. Then a wave of bittersweet chocolate takes over. Lastly a really nice juicy hop finish cleans the whole thing up in a strong cup of espresso with lemon rind kind of way. This stuff is straight forward and awesome. For as velvety and rich it's mouth feel is it still has good drinkability because it is not to sweet and hops do a good job of cleaning up after each sip."
"This is another excellent brew from Bear Republic, man is this one kick ass brewery or what? This brew pours our an opaque dark black colour with a huge espresso/tan coloured head. The aromas are a bit subtle to my nose, but I get some nice floral hop notes, and some great chocolatey roasted malt notes. The aroma is very clean and fresh for an imperial stout. The taste is a wonderful blend of cascade hop bitterness, and floral hop goodness with some citric hop notes in the finish. This is very well balanced for such a big brew, and the 8+% Abv goes unnoticed. The mouthfeel is actually quite light and thin for this stout, but it actually works quite well here. The lighter body and well balanced flavor of this big bear give it a '5' in the drinkability department in my book. A new classic."
"Jet black with a tan-coloured head. Not big with aromas, but on the tongue there is a good mix of roast, chocolate, malt, and hop flavours from this full-bodied strong stout. Quite rich, but doesn't really drink like a beer over 8%; a session on this one could be potentially dangerous. A well-crafted beer, but one which belies its strength."
" The brew is pretty full in body and it is just oh so smooth. The flavor is big and bold. It starts hoppy, floral at times and it is also citrusy and bitter. It has a nice bite at the start, and they balance a bit later. Roasty grains and coffee flavors jump in next only to be met with sweet chocolate shortly after. It gets roasty again near the finish and then dries out with nice coffee flavors and touches of hops. The complexity of this beer is incredible, and it maintains such a great balance through out. Although it is a pretty big beer, it seems like it would not scare too many people away. I could definitely sit down with a few and not regret it a bit. This is a great piece of work."
"The alcohol and sharp sugars come out much bigger after a year in the cellar. I especially enjoyed the malty tang that almost seemed reminiscent of a barrel-aged stout. This beer is great as is or layed down for a year."
"Pours a pitch black, with a large dark tan head that is a bit rocky, mostly lasting, and laces in sheets. Aroma is enormous, with a lot of chocolate, coffee, caramel, and a generous dose of hops. Flavor is equally large - tons of chocolate, middle becomes more coffee like, and ends with a very big and tasty hoppy bitterness. Full bodied, amazingly flavorful and complex - definitely one that needs to be consumed above fridge temp. I'm going to have to do a side-by-side with some Storm King since they are both amazing brews."
"All I can say is where did this beer come from? Wow. Beautiful to look at, smells great and tastes just as amazing. All the flavors are in your face but just perfectly mellow at the same time. I didn't even know it was 8% till I came here to review it and looked the %, it's so well hidden. Not as complex as Victory Storm King, but man.. this beer definitely gives it a run for its money."
"Notes: Where the hell is the 8.1% abv? So deceiving and very drinkable, very well put together. Id say I would make this a session beer but I would not last too long "
"Appearqance: Deep black with a tan thin head massive beer deep dark and robust thin lacing. Aroma: Deep caramel notes with roasted chocolate coffee notes what a wonderful rich spectrum of aroma. Taste: Slight hop character wonderful layers of roasted malt and coffee notes rich and syrupy goodness milky sweet and big. Mouthfeel: Full body stick to my gums good wow. Drinkability: Still incredibly drinkable wow just about one of the smoothest creamiest beers I have ever tasted."
"Mouthfeel is very full and creamy...flawless. Drinkability is insane as the 8.1 ABV isn't even noticeable. The perfect beer IMO."
"Liam"
"As imperial stouts go, this one is a wonderfully complex, well balanced example. The alcohol uses concealment well and can easily outflank and ambush the unwary. Definitely one I'd come back to again."
"This is new on my list of heavy favorites. Pours a heavy black-hole dark liquid with a creamy head and wafting an equally dark black malt aroma with an obvious hop spice. The thick heavy body supports the flavor of chocolate and patent malts with a bold rounded bitterness that sits upon the palate like a 500 pound gorilla. The presence of a heavy-duty caramel sweetness and alcohol warmth flow through the brew and last into a heft thick finish. Very well-balanced and complexly flavorful."
"Possibly the most beautiful looking and smelling beer I've ever had. A rich dark beer with a creamy khakhi head. Tremendous, comprehensive lacing. Semi-bitter tasting (like good chocolate). Noticeable toffee flavors as well. Dusty but robust feeling. Loved this bomber. Please O please, come to NY, Bear Republic Stout!"
"This stout is meduim in body. It does not feel as thick as others. It has a crispness to the mouthfeel. A smooth drinker for sure. Drink it slow, enjoy the journey."
"Deep brown with reddish highlights, this ber is topped by a thin tan head. Slight amount of sediment from the bottle started to slide into the glass. Very rich aroma, with strong chocolate and dark fruity notes and a nice coffee component as well. The taste is very heavy on the dark chocolate notes, with some milk chocolate in there as well. Very noticeable coffee flavors as well, followed by excellent roasted barley. While most of the taste is sweeter, a nice bitterness finishes it up and leads to the bitter chocolate and coffee aftertaste. Gets a little sweeter as it warms. Mouthfeel is very thick and rich, yet doesn't get too heavy as to make drinking it a chore. Man I like these imperial stouts. Is this as good as Old Rasputin? Maybe. I guess I'll have to break open a bottle of that real soon. But I'm glad this is a 22 oz. bottle. No problems killing this one tonight. This one went down way too easily. Big Bear is a Big Beer, and now a Big Favorite of mine."
"Thanks to xlperro for the bomber!"
"theaftertaste was thick and curranty almost medicinal. Nice bold Brussels lace. Everything was fine except the aftertaste. Its ok but there are better out there. Mackerson is smoother and not quite as bitter"

"A very tasty stout, that despite its elevated alcohol content,still is very drinkable. It pours deep black, befitting its name, with a slight creamy tan head that collars to the inside of the glass. The aroma is malty, with roasted barley dryness and slight hop spiciness rounding out the nose. The taste is malty sweet, but not cloying, with a generous bitterness from the roasted malts and barley and hop load. As other have noted for an imperial stout, the body is not overwhelming, which makes the beer easier to drink than it should be."
"This brew looks good, smells good, and the flavor is good. However, the mouthfeel is a bit lacking. Measured against other imperial stouts, it falls short in that category. As a regular ole stout or foreign extra it would be adequate. The color is opaque black with a light tan head that leaves plenty of lace rings. The aroma is milk chocolate, a bit of coffee and some molasses lurking in the background. The flavor is of bittersweet chocolate, coffee, caramel, with some roasted barley bitterness rounding out the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly chalky (gypsum?) and a bit thin, not the least bit syrupy like other imperial stouts."
"If there is one style of beer that I think is the most overrated, it's the American micro (imp) stout. I can appreciate the strongest versions, which have a good balance of malt AND hops (like Expedition), but the thinner, bitter versions don't really float my boat. This beer reminded me of the Victory and the Rogue. Mostly hops, somewhat dry and thin. Pours nice, smells nice, tastes nice. Overall, a pretty good drinking experience. How beers like this end up rated in the top 10-20, however, I don't understand. As is the case with the micro IPA's, they start to taste alike, IMO. If you like the Victory and Rogue, you'll like this. I still prefer the Samuel Smith, with it's balance and smooth taste and body."
"Alcoholic content is also a kicker, and seems to get stronger, darker, more wicked as we go. I save a small sample as a pick-me-up in the morning, throughout the day, when the man's getting me down, anytime's the right time."
"Dark black color, small head. Big coffee and toffee aroma. Roasted and toasted. A big bold stout. Big full bodied stout, but not chewy. Blast of complex flavors; Caramel sweetness, chocolate malt, coffee, toffee and a hint of vanilla. AND A WHOLE LOT MORE. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter that lingers a round a while. No alcohol bite, despite an 8.1%. Great stout."
"Imperial-style stout..."""
"Each beer I try from this brewery makes me want to find more. This is simply an outstanding stout. Big, hearty and ... smooth - sounds like an oxymoron, but it is true. The first mug was pretty cold - muted aroma of bittersweet chocolate. Creamy dark roasted malt, just the barest touch sweet with a clean finish. Smooth as silk. The second mug was allowed to warm, and a bit more bitterness emerges at the back of the tongue, still smooth. This beer seems to blend elements of the dryness of and Irish stout, the malty heft of an English sweet stout and a touch of the hoppyness of an American interpretation. KO's Young's Luxury Double Chocolate from the top of my sweet stout list."
"This has to be the best stout I've had in recent memory. Pours dark black and I could see no light coming through. Creamy dense head that is light brown in color and lasts the duration. My first impression when I opened the bottle was that this is a hoppy stout. After I poured it the aroma was sweet with chocolate, roasted malt and caramel standing out. Also a definate hop presence. Extremely smooth and drinkable despite its 8.1% abv. Flavor is an excellent marriage of malt and hops. Sweet, robust and displaying a complexity not often found in this style. It's no wonder it's a gold medal winner."
"540"
"Drinkability: Make no mistake...this is a big brew, in body and in alcohol. This is a great beer to slowly sip and enjoy, alongside a good book. I wish this one was available in my part of the country..."
"This beer poured jet black and formed a huge medium tan foamy Guiness like head that behaved like a float as it subsided, leaving lattice lace coating the glass as it subsided. An aroma of malt, chocolate and coffee. A flavor of malt, coffee and chocolate. A little lighter than I thought it would be, but a fine stout nontheless. It's a shame I have to go to Kentucky to get this or Liquid Solutions. Come on Bear Republic, visit Ohio sometime."
"Mmmm....beer. This is quite the good stout! Black as night with a nice thick head about 1/2 inch thick, lovely. Chocolate and earthy roast permeate the air as I bring the brew in for my first taste. A sweet, caramel flavor with chocolate roasted taste infused for my pleasure. The roasted flavor of sitting on my patio drinking a coffee in the morning. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer."
"I say....Voluptuous!"
"Approaching black, with clear, glowing, ominous deep burgundy hues when held to light. Creamy, well retained tan head slowly settles into a tight, one fingered layer that leaves quasi Belgian lace. Wafts of rounded carob and nutty brittle hit the nose upfront, then are ensued by rich, smooth buttery milk chocolate and black licorice. Roasted barley sharpness and heaty ethanol emerge as the nose adjusts to the pronounced chocolate presence. Cocoa dusted caramel upfront in flavor is ceded by a bittersweet combination of molasses sweetened melted bakers chocolate and burnt barley. Prune laced sweetness emerges mid palate, then is immediately contrasted by tangerine tinged hop bitterness. Mellow diacetyl butterscotch undertone complements the dark, chocolate malt overtone, lending an agreeable yeast byproduct and roasted grain balance. Moderate in body with a dextrinous, lightly sugary, lactose like mouthfeel. Suggestion of bourbon macerated figs dipped in semi sweet chocolate emerges late. Finishes long and disparate, with maltose like sweetness and lingering hop bitterness uncontesting each other. Big Bear Black is a delicious stout, and is nearly the perfect hybrid of a sweet stout and robustly hopped American imperial. Unique, balanced and highly drinkable."
"Another ""must-try"" for stout lovers. Big Bear pours black in color with a thick rising creamy tan head. The nose consists of chocolate, caramel, coffee & cream, roasted malt and hops. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and slightly sharp on the tongue. This Bear has bite, which mellows as it warms. Up front the sweet flavors of cocoa powder introduce themselves. There's a hoppy bite to the finish which contributes some of its effect from the alcohol. Finish tastes of sweet chocolate and has a roasted malt bitterness. The alcohol for the most part is veiled rather nicely behind the complex finish."
"The Darkness breathes out."
"Pours nicely black with good tan head. Malt is very roasty, little of the chocolate. Beer was harsher than it's chocolately brethren but the harsh roasted malt seemed to be needed to balance out the surprising hop bite. It was dry and comes across as being a turbocharged dry Irish."
"Opaque black topped by a full, foamy, dark tan head that drops but keeps a thin 1/8"" surface covering and leaves nice lace throughout the glass. The nose displays a gently fruity (currant, black raspberry) dark chocolate, coffee, and sweet cocoa. The medium body teams with the very fine and moderate carbonation to create a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is of a creamy sweet caramel and fruit-tinged toffee with a roasted edge. It starts with a bitter espresso note and warms into more softly roasted cocoa notes. Some alcohol is apparent but unobtrusive. It finishes drying with a lingering bitterness, mild roastiness and soft notes of mocha. Exceptionally well balanced. The bitterness builds on the palate throughout the serving but never goes out of bounds. A really nice stout with a very good drinkability. Well worth trying."
"Bear Republic puts out some consitently great beers. I always enjoy them. the appearance of this stout is amazing. great color of dark rubyish brown with a slightly under the weather head, due to a weak pour, but what was there stayed the entire time. the head was a tan to sandish color that left rings of lacy after every sip. the aroma was that of sweet chocolate, nut and burnt malt. the burnt malt smell gave it a nice little kick. the taste was very similar to the aroma, minus the nuts. it was sweet chocolate, burnt, charred malt, coffee, which gave it a sort of earthy tinge to it. it must be those beans that landed on the ground. slightly fruity, little stale marachino (SP) cherry, as coffee is the pit of a cherry. the coffe flavor gave it a nice little bitter bite to it. after a little while it mellowed out in the coffee bitter. it is full bodied with a great mouthfeel. amazing how it hid all the alcohol."
" Sweet milk chocolate, coffee, malted grains make up this incredible nose. Milk chocolate sweet at the start, the top thick and rich, the finish mildly acidic, the hops pleasing to the palate with a long lasting bitter aftertaste, also one damn fine stout and a must try for lovers of the Dark."
"Pours black, with a quickly-dissipating thin dark tan head. Aroma is roasty malt, with light toffee notes -- not as big a nose as some of the other stouts out there, but pleasant. Flavor is roasty and coffee-like, with a nice finish combining bitterness from grains and generous cascade hops. Very smooth and creamy, with a fairly full body. Dry finish, and a slightly bitter and cocoa-sweet aftertaste. The most impressive thing about this beer was the way it hides its alcohol. In retrospect, I can see that the higher ABV allowed for a nice complexity to the flavor, but I never would have guessed this was an 8.1% brew while I was drinking this."
"Dark ruby-black color, roasted caremel and coffee aroma, sweet plum-caremel flavor, creamy smooth and full mouthfeel. Nice tan clingy heas, leaves a nice lacing in my glass, nice stout, I have yet found a bad one from bear reublic, love it."
"Pours a deep dark brown, with a decent lingering tan/light brown head.  Dark roasted malt flavors, chocolate, coffee, a little caramel,  all the tastes I love in a Stout or Porter, really smooth for 8.1 abv.  Thanks to Xlperro!"
"Just another Californian Black Stout? Definitely Not! This Bear hunts alone."
"It's inky black with a good-looking tan head.  The smell is hops, coffee, molasses, and a subtle hint of licorice.  The taste is a bit roasty yet sweet and very satisfying.  The mouthfeel is chunky and appropriate for the style.  It's very drinkable and can easily sneak up on you if you're not ready for it.  It's a top-notch stout."
"Big Bear Black... A blessed experience.  So easily quaffed, you must take care or without realizing it you will have slammed the bottle down in complete abandon.  Powerful cocoa, molasses, roasted notes on the nose and palate.  Rich malt profile.  Exceptional all around."
"Nice creamy brown head.  Very opaque.  Smell of burnt malts and molasses.  Light body for a stout.  Some toffee undertones.  A bit of coffee too.  Very solid stout."
"Good stout, not too sweet. A bit of caramel sweetness and a deep raostyness. A very good all around stout. Easy drinking and well balanced."
