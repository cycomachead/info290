"Absolutely fantastic beer.  Should be #1 overall in my opinion"
"This Bourbon County was quite elusive until a couple weeks ago when I was able to have it on tap. Delicious, wish I could have bought some bottles."
""
""
""
"A hint of vanilla and oak. Warm finish With hints of fruity coffee. F: heavy mouthfeel but not syrupy. Delicious."

"2013 is drinking beautifully right now"
""
""
""
"It's a stout you have to have at some point. Completely lives up to hype."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Perhaps the best stout I have ever had. The first sip was so amazing- with so many flavors coming forth. The coffee isn't overpowering. Chocolate and roasted goodness shine through. A beautiful beer in a distinguished bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: the freshest one is easily the best of the bunch as I expected. that said I'm not to impressed with it. the coffee already tastes slightly stale and only gets worse with ages. the coffee takes away the complexity of dark fruits and sweet malts that stand out in the standard version."

"Buddy of mine opened a 2011 bottle.  Unfortunately the coffee fell off and as a result it was pretty boozy.  I wouldn't age this one guys..."

"Review of 2014. Tasted along with 2013"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"And I thought the stout was amazing. Wow. Definitely deserves the rating."
"Got to try a 2013 bottle that I had aged for a bit  over a year.  The coffee is still so prominent with a nice bitter bite but just a fantastic smooth sweet finish.  The 13.4% ABV has mellowed out but is still present without distracting from the great flavors of this beer.  Very, very well done."
"one of the best beers i have ever had"
""
""
""
""
"Deepest coffee richness I could find in a brew. Mouthfeel is thick, sweet, and slick from the  oils of the beans and the roast lingers in the best way."
""
""
""
"O.  I love reg BCBS.  But this takes the cake.  That coffee really hits it off.  Everything is perfect besides it should have a better appearence and aroma.  dont get alot of coffee there. But nonetheless if there is a beer that deserves almost a perfect it's this. One of the best stouts i've had!"
"Beautiful dark black"
""
""
""
"(2013) Perfect.  I love you Heady, but BCBCS is the best beer out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great stout. Very drinkable, although any beer that tastes more like coffee than beer is not going to get higher than a 4 from me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good, but definitely not top ten worthy. Vanilla rye is way better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thick, complex, full of coffee. A bit boozy"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is full and coats your mouth with a rush of coffee, chocolate, chewy brownies, and a slight touch of Bourban. Alcohol is hidden so you would never think you were drinking a beer that comes in at almost 13%. World class and a beer that must be on every stout fans top 5."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A truly great Barrel Aged Coffee Stout. Great blend of coffee, chocolate, and bourbon barrel flavors with a body that is thick but still drinkable. Glad to finally try this after striking out on the bottles for the last few years."
""
""
""
""
""
"Recommendation: The only true annual-release variant, this should be on every craft beer lover's bucket list."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellence at its finest. The coffee and bourbon is perfectly balanced and should age very well."
""
""
""
""
"2014 edition - Pours almost black color with a very thin tan head.  The odor is powerful, with notes of coffee, sweet chocolate, toffee, vanilla, dried fruits, plum, raisin, bourbon, rich, whiskey, woods, slight resin, earthy.  The taste is velvety, chocolate, bourbon, woods up front.  Then very fruity, fig, dates, raisin.  Very coffee towards the back as well as dry woods.  Barely any bitterness at all, very easy drinking."
""
""
""
"'13 was better than '14 in my opinion. Coffee was too fruity in the 14. Still real solid tho"
""
""
"Much coffee on the nose and the initial taste is similar, then quickly gives way to the bourbon.  Warmed to near room temp and this didn't change it much."
""
""
""
""
""
"Had high hopes for it but it absolutely disapointed me, tastes almost like a bitter cold coffee. Too bold for me."
""
""
""
""
"2/15/15 - Another excellent Bourbon County - I liked this even more than the standard stout. Poured thick, with an excellent aroma of coffee and a hint of chocolate and fruit. Great taste, and loved the carbonated feel, the strength of the taste and alcohol. Strong, but easy to drink. Not as bitter as the standard stout, I will definitely seek out this version, and I look forward to trying others in this great line of beers! Well done Goose Island!!!"
""
"Overall- Halfway through I had to take to bed and show it proper loving. This is one you take home to Mom."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I stepped into it 2 weeks ago when someone got me a growler of BCBCS.  It is the best coffee stout and probably beer of all types I've had.  Unfortunately, I haven't figured out how to find more!"
""
""
"Huge barrel character comes directly to the fore, but intense coffee and chocolate stand up to the barrel and combine for a well balanced yet potent masterpiece of a beer. Dark fruit comes into the mix as it warms. The coffee bitterness is a nice complement to the sweet, vanilla bourbon of the base beer."
""
"O: Amazing. I was lucky to try one of these and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. Nicely balanced but still very bold in flavor."
""
"2014 tasted on 2/3/15 at Link's in Chicago, 9 oz. pour in a snifter. I am a fan of bourbon and stouts, so this line up from GI suits me well. The Coffee Stout lives up to all the hype for me. It has a better balance overall than the regular BCBS (which I like as well). I like that the coffee taste does not overpower, it seems to offset some of the sweetness of the regular BCBS. Highly recommend!"
""
""
""
""
"Although I don't like stouts, you can appreciate the amount of work that went into this beer. The coffee mixed in was amazing and it definitely is a sipper, I'm sure if you like coffee stout you will love this."
""
""
""
"2014 release, tasted on 1-9-15.  While this is still a nice BA beer, I was unable to discern any coffee(smell or taste), so was disappointing in that regards.  Leads me to assume that for the coffee aspect, this is best fresh."

"Incredible beer. I personally like the coffee stout more then the original bourbon county. Of course smell of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, aged bourbon. Tasted incredible, just enough coffee to blow your taste buds. The high alcohol is hidden. Overall the beer was delicious all the way through, 10/10"

"awesome smooth great high alch but not strong"
""
""
"Overall: This is probably the best coffee stout I have had I wish I had access to more!"
""
""
""
"I was lucky enough to grab three samples of this at Brrfest this weekend.  Totally lives up To hype.  Top 3 beers I've ever had!  My wife even enjoyed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good imperial stout. Huge hints of coffee very smooth so sad I only had one. Need more"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Found this on tap finally.  You get a strong roasted coffee aroma.  Reminds me of the old percolator coffee pots I had growing up.  It gives off that certain fresh strong coffee smell.  The taste is fresh brewed coffee.  Hints of oak and coffee grounds.  Smooth bourbon finish but not to sweet.  Amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer, still like the base BCBS a tad more."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good beer, I like it."
""
"unbelievably amazing...all it's cracked up to be (and more)"
""
""
"Even after 5 years, the coffee is noticeable. Age has melded the flavors nicely."
""
""
"Thanks to a very generous fellow BA I got this (2013) as an extra in a trade. Pours a pitch black with very little head and even smaller amount of lacing. I do feel as if the coffee flavor had faded a bit but the taste was still a very smooth, sweet malt, dark fruit,toffee,molasses, and a hint of milk chocolate. No heat and a little oily but very enjoyable. The taste of this was very similar to Parabola. Love this and need to find more."
"Simply phenomenal.  The blend of the bourbon, stout and coffee is seamless and delicious"
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at the Pine Box, Seattle.   I had this alongside Abraxas and Berserker, as part of their Strong Ale Fest, and it was interesting to compare these three Imperial Stouts.  At first taste, the BCBCS seemed a little in the shadow of the other two beers, both of which have quite a few more strong flavors competing for your attention.  But over a forty-five minute time drinking all three beers, BCBCS really came to the fore.  It's so smooth, so perfectly balanced.  It's just the right combination of an incredible stout, with coffee, vanilla, and whisky flavors all blended together harmoniously.   It's got a quiet intensity and great depth.  At the end, my wife and I both agreed that it was our favorite among these three exceptional stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not a huge fan of stouts, porters etc. so it's hard for me to be completely objective.  I definitely see this beer has something special about it.  I guess it could sweep you off your feet if it was on draught.  I had it in a bottle.  I thought it was a very good beer, but I would be surprised if someone told me it's # 2 on the list.  Goes to show you, what do I know."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have had this the past two years and still don't understand the rave about it. It's to maltie! Maybe I need to let it sit longer. Don't know but for the price I can name two dozen beers I would rather have."
"Great beer. Coffee flavor is wonderful. Worthy of the hype."
""
""
""
"Draft @ Harry's Hofbrau RWC on 1/9/15.  Aroma of predominantly coffee with booze, hints of roasted malt and vanilla.  Pleasant mouthfeel and tastes of coffee, roasted malt, bourbon, chocolate, and vanilla.  Very solid for the style…could drink several more of these."
""
""
""
"I'm not much of a coffee drinker so I was not sure how much I would enjoy this extremely coffee-forward BA stout.  To my surprise, the taste surpassed BCBS.  This is almost a perfect beer in my opinion, its too bad it is so hard to come by."
""
""
""
""
"Is this really the #2 beer on BA right now. Wow. It's good, but there are a whole hell of a lot of beers I'd rather have than this one. It tastes like coffee and bourbon. Watch out."
"O:  Great beer."
""
"Wow. This was my first and hopefully not my last. I was prepared for this to be over hyped, but it's not. This beer takes the extremes of the beer world and mashes them together. Imagine a cross between the sweetness and creaminess of a really good milk stout with the viscosity and complexity of a Russian imperial stout. That is BCBCS. Flavor was deep, sweet, rich, oaky bourbon, tons of chocolate, vanilla and coffee. Perhaps there was a hint of amaretto too. Incredibly complex. The texture was oily, thick, and barely carbonated. I split a 12oz bottle with 3 friends and it was incredibly satisfying. I could have drank a little more, but the full bottle would have been too much for me. I need more of this stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's an excellent BA stout and lives up to the hype."
"2014 Version a little boozy still"

"I had a pint on tap at a specialty beer bar in Vermont. I was caught off guard by the black color. It was poured with very little head. The taste was surprisingly sweet I thought. I would recommend this beer. It is definitely a beer for beer enthusiasts only. My girlfriend who doesn't drink beer much did not enjoy it. I thought it was very tasty and different. I would buy it again!!"
""
""
"O.  Did not disappoint.  Wish I had a 50 more.  I'd drink em all.  World class brewery and world class beer.  Thank you!"

"Drinks incredible smooth, not particularly creamy, but outstandingly silk, with calming, earthy notes to it, providing an intriguing interplay between milk chocolate and slightly sticky toffee. The Bourbon is big in this, without getting too boozy at any point, while producing a pleasant, oaken warmth with vanilla notes in it, complimenting to the slightly bitter coffee, as well as the scorched, earthy malts and sweet milk chocolate. The coffee becomes visible on the palate, paired with slick caramel and cocoa nibs, while a wooden earthiness adds to the subtle coffee sting, resulting from the harmonious, convenient integrated Bourbon. Finishes with sweeter toffee, as well as molasses and hints of coffee, while smooth, slightly sweeter milk chocolate represents the foundation of this beer."
""
"Perfection defined.  I'm a big fan of craft coffee, stouts, and whiskey, so this was a dream come true.  Layered, complex, and a bit soupy (what do you expect?).  Keeping it local with Intelligentsia was a great idea.  I believe this is what they drink in heaven."

""

"Seems thinner than regular bcbs. Dark black body. Wonderful coffee shop aroma. Sweet chocolate taste. Smooth velvety mouthfeel. Tastes like an excellent mocha latte!"
"Overall- Incredible depth of flavors. So roasty and yet so creamy rich and smooth. Barrel characteristics are out of this world, and coffee just adds a perfect finish. Coffee is interesting as it brings a pungnant pepperskin aroma which adds some heat. A beer to be savored and sipped, truly world class."
"The best beer I have ever had."
""
"Mouthfeel is silky and smooth, a little graininess. Overall, an excellent beer. Happy to try it. A bit sweet, if you want more than a few ounces of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Best beer ever? Maybe not. Best beer I've had? Probably so. Seems perfectly aged and perfectly balanced. So glad that a beer so great arrived in time to make my #500."
"A perfect beer in every way. Perfectly balanced, wonderful aromas complement the coffee undertones and hints of oak and vanilla. Complex, yet smooth and integrated with an impossibly long lingering finish. A great effort and a year of bottle age seemed perfect."
"I'm not good with all the fancy descriptive words, but it tastes a lot like those coffee-flavored hard candies."
""
""
""
""
"Tasted 2013 vintage against 2014.  Both were fantastic, but the freshness of 2014 blew 2013 out of the water."
"amazing all around everything about it is amaszing ."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2013 vintage. Very similar to bcbs up front. Nice syrupy bourbon flavor with a charcoal backbone. The improvement of this over the original is the coffee aftertaste. It rounds out the beer so well. Fortunate to have had the chance to try this.  Merry Xmas!"
""
""
""
""
"Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect"
""
"O: Typically my favorite BCS, I drank this immediately following a 2014 Vanilla Rye, which was magnificent but far less boozy than the 2013 Coffee I was drinking. Maybe 2013 was a boozier year for BCS?"
""
""
"Pours thick viscous dark black in color with a rich mocha tan head that retains nicely. Smell is incredibly rich with decadent aromas of coffee, chocolate, fudge, sweet vanilla, with hints of cherry, toffee, graham cracker and oak in the end. Taste follows the nose with rich flavors of bakers chocolate, charred malt, espresso, vanilla, cherry, oak and bourbon in the finish. Mouthfeel is thick rich semi sweet mildly carbonated and incredibly smooth."

"It's a good beer. But.. I think it's way overrated on here. I bought 2 four-packs, due to the hype. However, I wouldn't buy it again. There are many other beers out there that I would recommend over it. Anyways, it's all opinions; no facts here. My final opinion is Overrated."

"I could go on and on about this one, but simply put, it's the perfect combination of coffee, bourbon and general beer awesomeness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Had it at Chuck's on 85th on 12/3.  Very rich and strong coffee flavors, but without being overpowering.  Sweet but not overly so, with wood and roasted malt.  Thick, almost syrupy, and a huge mouthfeel.  I wish I could get my hands on a bottle!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the best stouts I've ever had. Really intense flavors but still somewhat smooth and enjoyable to drink. Prefer this slight more then the standard BCBS."
""
""
""
""
"O  A kick in the pants for tastebuds. So much happening in this beer that impresses at first, but then becomes gimmicky. Bourbon, coffee, and chocolate were all present but without any balance."

"world class stout from the mouth feel to the lingering coffee. can't go wrong here"

""

""

""
""
"Like getting cracked square in the mouth by Juan Valdez as he drunkenly stumbles out of a Kentucky distillery holding a fist-full of roasted coffee beans! Even after a year, this is a massive coffee/bourbon sucker punch... but, in a good way. A glorious coffee, dark chocolate and bourbon bomb. World class and near perfection."
""
""
""
""

"2013 bottle poured into a short tumbler.  Smelled of strong rotten potato and moldy cardboard.  Surprisingly did not taste very bad, but the overpowering, pungent smell on this beer was disheartening.  No coffee notes came through.  I'm sure this was just a bad batch, but what a letdown :(."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This stuff is pretty good, but not mind blowing.  The bourbon is just overwhelming and it does not manage to taste balanced or subtle in any way.  I think the folks who are gaga over this just haven't tasted the competition."
"Unbelievably good.  Thick with just a touch of bourbon."
""
"I find this to be the roughest of the three Bourbon County beers, and consequently my least favorite. Just get the imperial stout, it's easily the best of the bunch. Looking for a superior coffee stout? Try Terrapin Wake N Bake."

"Had a chance to try the 2014 vintage at the West Coast Barrel Aged Beerfest this past weekend. I've never had any other vintage. This beer has a certain spiciness to it (cayenne?). The spiciness isn't overwhelming, but it is enough to distract from both the coffee and bourbon that I was looking forward to. The 2012 vintage of the normal BCBS was being poured as well, which was phenomenal."
""
""
""
"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours pitch black with a 1/8"" light brown head that dissipated to patches, but with light lacing. Aroma of sweet dark toasted malt, bourbon, chocolate and light coffee. Flavor is well melded lightly sweet toasted malt, dark chocolate, bourbon and latte coffee. Finish is coffee, chocolate and a bit of bourbon burn. Heavy bodied with a pleasant creaminess. My first of the many variants of the original BCBS, which has always been a favorite. The coffee is blended well with the other flavors and adds a surprisingly smooth new dimension. Like the base version, a world class imerial stout. I'd buy this again, but will never spend the time or gas required to get a single bottle of this. Delicious but too hard to find."

"Dark black in color with a decent tan colored head. Alcohol and coffee aroma is strong. Big roasted malt flavors with coffee, vanilla beans, alcohol, and a decent bitterness create a flavorful and slow sipping beer. Smooth mouthfeel."

" I am blown away by the finesse of this, right from the beginning the coffee is noticeable and yet subtle enough to support the incredible base with this being an unrivaled Imperial Stout with coffee and bourbon -the richness are preserved well even with over a year of age. The 14.3% does not seem realistic based on the taste, so much complexity and flavor this was certainly memorable"

"O: Just epic.  My favorite bourbon county and probably my favorite stout period.  Can't wait to try it again."
""
""
""
"Pulled a 2009 out of storage last year and I can't even begin to describe it. Most memorable beer of 2013...left an indelible impression."
""
""
""
""
"2013 served on tap and was more of a coffee bomb.  High quality coffee flavors on the beer base.  Nose is 95% coffee.  Same dark tan foam, dissipating to a swirl in the glass.  Flavors emerged more as it warmed a bit."
"Drinks like an imperial milk stout with coffee.  A tad too sweet in the finish."
""

"One of our favorites in the lineup. Much more mellow than the rest but still a lot of bit bold flavors. Awesome beer."
""
""
""
""
"2014 pours deep brown with a thin khaki head. Minimal to no lacing probably because of abv. Nose is deep coffee. Smells like fresh ground beans taken from a grinder. Cocoa and mild caramel undertones. Taste is coffee, tobacco, cocoa but evena little vanilla on the back end. Boozy heat gives the viscose nature of the coffee a break.. Ultimately I'd say it's all its hyped up to be flavor wise, although I feel like this shouldnt be so hard to get.."

"O- The hype is well-deserved.  Definitely one of my new top 3 coffee beers.   The flavor is perfect, everything I look for in a coffee stout.  There's room for improvement in the aroma and mouthfeel IMO but overall it's truly a fantastic beer."

"2013- If possible, even better a year older. The coffee has mellowed, leaving a balanced drink that is actually a little like beer. Chocolate nose is more pronounced, and actually comes through in the flavor. Slightly less boozy, still very warming. Overall, flavor is more mellowed and balanced. Phenomenal."

"Almost black in color with a dark tan head that quickly disappears to leave just a small amount of lacing.  Big coffee and roasted malt with sweet bourbon and chocolate in the smell.  Taste matches the smell, roasted malt and espresso and chocolate with a bourbon finish.  Full body, silky smooth, medium carbonation.  Excellent beer, so smooth for such a high ABV."

"This beer is the fourth. BCBCS is a universe of complexity. The oakiness and bourbon shine but are not overpowering. The coffee sits extremely well in the middle of the taste. The body is perfect: not watery and thin, but not like motor oil. I enjoyed this beer until the last drop. If you can, PLEASE get a hold of this beer. I didn't think beer could be this exquisite."

"Overall:  I liked the brew.  In the class of high-alcohol Imperial Stouts (well, I guess there really aren't any low-alcohol Imperial Stouts), it is certainly a stand-out.  Nice complex flavor and the coffee notes were just about right.  Good finish; the product is well-rounded.  Definitely a beer to sip for special occasions, and not something I'd put on a ""go to"" list, even if it was easier to find.  Despite this site's notes about smoking and tasting, I fired up a ""1990 Vintage"" Rocky Patel for the last third of my glass.  The beer holds up well to a good cigar, which in my experience is unusual."

"2013 Edition: It poured a deep brown to black with a slight to no tan head. The aroma hit me straight out of the bottle of coffee, heavy stout and bourbon. The taste was otherworldly. A perfect blend of the base stout that exuded bittersweet chocolate and a deep roasty flavor with the coffee and the bourbon barrel characteristics. As it warmed the bourbon booziness came out as well as a stronger coffee tone that was akin to espresso. Hints of vanilla and charred oak emerged and really capped off a world class beer."

"this is the best coffee stout on the market, hands down. Amazing depth of smell, taste and mouthfeel. If you love coffee you will love this stout. World-Class and #1 in its class by far, in my view. I will have to discipline myself to leave one bottle to age for a couple years and see how much of the coffee fades over time."

""
""
""
"O: Quite possibly the best representation of its style. Like a cup of rich coffee, this tasty brew is best enjoyed one sip at a time."
"picks me up while putting me down, caffeine and booze always gives me a strange sensation, wouldn't be my first choice for a night cap. A great mix of barrel and dark roasted coffee, I'd love to be able to get my hands on this stuff on a regular basis."

"Bottle date 11/15/13. Pours pitch black with a 1/2 finger caramel-colored head that dissipates quickly. Nose is coffee spiciness/bitterness combined with sweetness from the base beer. Just a phenomenal nose that evokes the finest coffee liqueur imaginable. Taste is sweetness & coffee beany up front. Spiciness all around, particularly toward the back of the mouth. Oak in the mix too, of course. The finish alone has more complexity than the entire experience of most beers: coffee spice, bitterness, sweetness reminiscent of maple and molasses, oak. So many flavors that fit together so well. Mouthfeel is a thick, almost syrupy consistency. Well-carbonated. Overall it's a phenomenal beer that never fails to impress, year after year. Regular Bourbon County Stout is awesome, and it's hard to believe anything could improve upon it. But that's exactly what coffee does: substantially improves upon a near perfect beer."

"O: Good for sure, but I'm not completely wowed by any means. While none of the Bourbon County beers would be noted for their subtlety, I was surprised at how much the coffee flavors were beaten into submission by the other huge flavors here. NOTE: Had the '13 version a few days later from the 12 oz. bottle. While substantially the same experience, the coffee was more noticeable from the beginning, the bourbon was more integrated, and was on the whole a better drink. Scores reflect the improved experience."

"Serving type: bottle"

"Tasted very much like the smell, the coffee overpowering but still tamed at the same time, I would like to try this after letting it age for ~3 years to let let coffee mellow out some. Malty, chocalatey and notes of bourbon followed. Simply delicious and surprisingly did taste as hot as I thought it would but you could still tell it was north of 10%."
""
""
"O- An awesome beer for sure. Again my only complaint is the very strong bourbon presence, but this is what you get with most Bourbon County beers as well as a lot of other BA beers. I plan to try it again with a few more months on it to see if the booziness melds in a little better with age."

"Not much more I can say about this beer that hasn't been said. I've had it fresh and every couple months since then and every time I'm still blown away. Awesome coffee bourbon bomb fresh and even 6 months later all those flavors are still there. Will save my last bottle to try at a year. Can't find anything to knock on so perfection for me."
""

"This is the only BCBCS I've had to date. Pours thick black with only the slightest bit of deep brown around the edges when held in the light. Thick and a touch oily for sure. Slight brown head with very little retention. Intense coffee in the aroma. You can easily pickup the strength of the alcohol in the aroma, strong bourbon, hints of vanilla, and tobacco. The coffee is up front as I was hoping for. Still very sweet but a bit toned down from BCBS, which is a huge positive for my taste, just the right amount to round out the flavors of anise, vanilla, oak, and raisin that dance and marry very poignantly.  Serious viscosity here with very little carbonation, you can almost chew on this beer. Was not disappointed in my first BCBS variant!"

"The 2013 edition of BCBCS. What else I can say that thousands of BA users already haven't. The quintessential bourbon barrel aged coffee stout. An amazing BBA stout brewed with an awesome coffee could only yield a beer such as this. To put it in layman's terms: COFFEE BOMB"
""

"Popped a bottle of 2013 for my first bourbon county coffee stout experience ever. This beer left me speechless because it was so delicious. I tried this beer right after I had a Kbs and I thought this was so much more balanced and was more flavorful as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall it is a quite wonderful beer that lacks only in the carbonation. I would gladly buy this beer again, and would happily recommend it to others. There's precious little to be said about perfection, but this does quite well in embodying it. Bourbon lovers, stout enthusiasts, and coffee scrutineers will all be proud to have a bottle of this close by."

"This beers pours darker'n a black steer's tookus on a moonless prairie night with a short dark mocha head that dissipates quickly leaving minimal lacing. The nose is strong and mouthwatering and is dominated both by rich malt and boozy bourbon with notes of chocolate, espresso, vanilla, toffee and nutty oak. On the palate is big bourbon and malty toffee/caramel sweetness, dark chocolate and loads of coffee/espresso. The mouthfeel is very round, smooth, velvety and huge on the palate. I didn't know what to expect and have been dissapointed by coffee stouts in the past, but this one is just fantastic."
""
"I poured this one (bottled Nov. 2013) into a Bourbon County snifter. It's dark with the thinnest of heads. A bit foamy at first, but the head is gone, never to be seen again, after about 5 minutes. Looks oily and viscous. The nose is incredible: roasted espresso beans that have been soaked in bourbon. Heavy amounts of roast, espresso, and sweet bourbon vanilla. My god. Taste follows the nose, then hammers it out of the park: equal parts iced espresso and bourbon. Both flavors are there, and neither overpowers the other: complementary. Am I drinking a bourbon-spiked espresso, or a bourbon with a shot of espresso in it? It's both of those things, and something else entirely. The booze is definitely there, warming me up but not knocking me out. Lovely vanilla marshmallows round out each sip. Mouthfeel is thick, viscous, and smooth. So luscious and decadent. Simply astonishing: the balance between the roast coffee, the heavy bourbon, and the luscious mouthfeel is out of this world. The finest beer I've ever had. I've got one BCBCS left, and I'll be enjoying it on my wedding night. It's that kind of beer. Cheers!"

"Dark as night and impenetrable to light. Brussels lacing. Not much to speak of in the way of head. A minimal amount of dark khaki colored foam is barely present. I've had Founders Breakfast Stout but this coffee aroma is so strong it nearly has a physical presence. The body is thick and sticky and carries a certain weight to it. The front of the palate is brutally intense coffee and deep dark malt."

"O: I'm really glad I was able to try this. It's rich, it's dense, it's over the top, it's full of coffee, and I love coffee (especially Intelligentsia), far more than beer if I had to choose. But it's not as amazing as I'd hoped. Sure, the Bourbon County line sets a new bar; they're the most extreme barrel aged stouts. But perhaps they're not the best, the most nuanced, or the most complex."
"This smells great. Wood, chocolate, coffee, alcohol, cinnamon, tobacco, maybe fig or something like that, and some other good stuff I can't pinpoint. Tastes something like a oaky, coffee, less-sweet port wine or something. I'm getting frustrated that I can't pick out all the scents and flavors, but it's pretty damned good. It'll probably come to me later. I'll finish here and continue to sip."

"A well-balanced beer can exist in any style, and here we have a well-balanced massive imperial stout brewed with coffee beans and aged in bourbon barrels. Very tough to beat this experience. Really a well crafted beer and exremely drinkable for a beer that exceeds 12% abv. Best beer in the world? Mmmm...getting closer."

"12 oz bottle. I'd just missed this beer so many times that I couldn't contain myself when I got it. Anyway, this pours a pitch black color, barely any head or carbonation. The smell is strong with chocolate, coffee, and a good amount of booze. The taste brings all of the flavors together - starts with coffee and chocolate and finishes with vanilla and oak. No flavor really dominates, which makes this really smooth and drinkable. Overall, this is one of my favorite beers ever. It's a truly magnificent creation"

"2100th review! 12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 11/15/2013. Pours dense pitch black color with a small fairly dense dark tan head with decent retention, that reduces to a ring of lace that lingers. Minimal lacing on the glass. Aromas of huge dark chocolate, roasted coffee, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, oak, clove, light char, and roast/oak earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge dark chocolate, roasted coffee, cocoa, toast, roasted malt, caramel, vanilla, toffee, oak, clove, bourbon, light char, and roast/oak earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, coffee, cocoa, toast, roasted malt, caramel, vanilla, toffee, oak, clove, bourbon, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great malt/barrel flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic BA imperial coffee stout. All around awesome complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
"Edit: had 2014 and 2013 back to back in a snifter on 1/3/15.. Both poured black as night, with limited head and light lacing. Smell was dominated by dark fruit, vanilla, coffee, and dark chocolate. Taste followed suit. 2014 had more raisans, plums, and dark chocolate, while 2013 was silmilar, but had more coffee and dark chocolate bitterness. Definitely a great beer. I liked the fresh version a little more though both were great."
"People need to relax with this beer.. This beer is not rank #2. Bourbon beers are strong.. Great to have with a steak.. But most of the Bourbon beers taste the same.. I'm not hating on this beer.. It's probably the best Bourbon beer I had.. But I'm an IPA, Double IPA, Double Pilsner type of guy.. Again great beer BUT come on.. These Bourbon Beers are close to hard liquor..NOT really a beer to me"

"Overall this beer holds its own with the best of them. Rich in smell, taste, and body, very hard to find a coffee stout that rivals it. Unfortunately it is becoming harder to find but I look forward to hunting down a couple bottles every year."

"I definitely prefer 2013 to 2014, though both are stellar. Cellaring beer is a gamble. It’s experimentation, not investment. One year has, in my opinion, improved 2013 BCBCS. I know the conventional wisdom is don't age coffee beers, but I’m saving another bottle of each vintage to drink in 2016, because even if it’s potentially falling off, who knows?"

""

"Overall: I can’t hide my disappointment at this. Would be curious to try it again with a little age on it to mellow the rough spots out, but as it is, fresh (bottled January 11 2012) it is not my thing. I got really drunk and didn’t love the taste/feel. Not exactly drinkable, too alcoholic, the balance is not there."

"A great beer, no doubt, but not what I expected at all. It's very flavorful and provides a bitter and spicy punch to a beer that's typically far sweeter in nature. Nevertheless, while it contains a little less heat and barrel sweetness overall, I daresay that's the main reason that I enjoy BCBS to begin with. Still, any self-respecting beer geek would be crazy to not seek this out - it's by far one of the most memorable coffee infused stouts I've ever had. This vintage would not benefit with age, in my view. It will get progressively earthy and lose its coffee profile. Without any of the spiciness, it won't be as thrilling. I'm absolutely curious how the 2012 vintage is drinking right now - will post an update as soon as I get around to trying it!"

"Overall- another great beer in the series. However, if the temp is too warm, the tastes dissipate.Best at 50-55F. Possibly start at 48F. A snifter works well for this beer."

""

"Overall I thought this was a very good beer and a very good example of a strong barrel aged Stout, the coffee had a really nice flavor to it and it for sure lived up to the name of Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout and I feel that the Coffee was showcased in the beer, it helped the beer in some ways, but it also hurt it in other ways. This beer had nice drinkability, it's a sipper, but not as much BCBS, it's fairly smooth, rich, a little sticky, a little filling, lightly boozy and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, I might contemplate drinking two of these, but just like BCBS one might be the perfect amount for me, and it males for a great beer to a sip on a cold winter morning. What I like the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, I think the coffee caused it to not be as sticky as BCBS and I really liked that. What I liked the least about this beer was that the coffee was just a little too dominating in the taste, if it was dialed back a notch or two I think it would allow some more of those chocolate and bourbon flavors to come through while enhancing the pretty light coffee flavors that BCBS has, I would for sure buy this beer if I ever saw it, I haven't seen BCBS around here so I doubt I will see the variants, my friend had to get this one shipped to him from North Dakota. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Coffee Stouts, especially if your a big fan of KBS. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, i do think it could be balanced just a little better,but other than that I think it's pretty close to being world class and I might even like it a little more than KBS, I would have to have the two side by side to figure it out. BCBS is still my favorite of the series so far, but this one came fairly close. Great job guys, this was another great beer and I'll be on the look out for the other variants, keep up the kick ass work."

"Purchased at Wegmans of all places. Appearance is dark as night with a brown head. Maybe the best coffee stout I have had. Great aroma and rich coffee flavor without being too sweet. Alcohol warms the palate but does not overwhelm you. Just a really enjoyable beer. As it warms up this beer really is a mouthful of coffee flavor."

"Yes, this is all that it is cracked up to be. From the initial pour with creamy coffee colored head to the last luscious sip at the end, this comes very close to the perfect stout. I have had the pleasure of having this at various times and have never been disappointed. The aroma is stellar, the taste is what you would expect and more from a world class coffee stout; full, rich, coffee/cocoa flavors mixed with vanilla and leaving the taster wanting more. This is not a ""down the hatch, gimme another"" beer...this is a sipping pleasure."
""
"Black beer, dark brown head, fair retention. Big coffee aroma, lots of roast and malt, booze, caramel, nutty. Really sweet, but this was needed to balance the booze. Sturdy bitterness, but not that prominent. Lots of roast and coffee, caramel, woody, tannins, alcohol. Low carbonation, heavy body, smooth was plenty of alcohol warmth and a bit of astringency. I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
"O: Is it the rarity of this beer that makes me want to have it on the specialist of occasions? If I had 2 cases of this sitting in front of me right now, would I feel the same? Not sure. May never know. All I know is I don't want this beer to end."

"Literally the best beer I've ever had the pleasure of tasting! The perfect stout taste hits you, and then the chocolate from the stout, and then the perfect coffee taste hits you, and then each flavor stays around just long enough to blend with each other creating the perfect balance of flavors and an orgasm in your mouth. I bought two four packs, one to drink immediately and one to age. This stuff is ridiculously good!"
""

"To be fair, this was strong. Really really strong and not something to be messed with. This wasn't cheap but the price was well worth it as the strength of the bourbon-like booze and the underlying woodiness of it reminded me that this was no ordinary beer. It's pretty rare to find something so varied as this that also felt so harmonious at the same time and even more rare to find a beer that reminded me at the time I drank it of how impressive a ""liquid bread"" can be. The truly great beers make you feel at the time of their consumption that you're damn lucky to be alive in a place and time where sheer happiness is obtainable and thankfully, this was one of those beers that reminded me of why I love beer so much. If you can find it, ignore the price posted and just get this. All 5 of your senses will thank you indefinitely."

"Got to try this beer at the ACBF 2010 and all I could say is holy crap! This beer is wonderful, it was just overly flavorful. The color was black with a pretty good head for something so strong. The beer was thick and complex as hell. The bourbon screams out in this brew, there are flavors of coffee, vanilla, and lots of booze. This beer reminded me a little bit of Sam Adams Triple Bock but much better. This beer deserves another try, if I ever see it again I'll surely pick up some."

"O- Jesus himself descended down upon goose island and had a coffee. He then pissed in some oak bourbon barrels and hence this beer! Lives up to the hype"
"O- this beer deserves every bit of the hype that it receives, it's in your face and leaves a taste in your mouth long after consuming. My bottle was about 14 months old, and I wonder if the coffee would be more prevalent in a fresh bottle. A little more coffee presence would have bumped the taste up to a 5, so I'll have to find a fresh one for comparison. Well done GI"

I haven’t given a perfect 5.0 rating to anything because I figure I haven’t found it yet and don’t know what’s around the corner, but this is as close to perfection that I have found so far. Do yourself a favor; if you like stouts… seek this beer out. You won’t be disappointed."

"The Bourbon County line of beers has grown into something truly wonderful. This year's stout and barley wine are also excellent. I can't wait to see what all three do in my cellar for a few years. Three years from now (when Elizabeth Warren is hopefully President), I'm going to taste all three from 2013 and report back. This 2013 class is setting the standard for barrel aged stouts. The gauntlet has been thrown."

"Allowed my mom, dad and sister each a sip or two. They all have an appreciation for beer, but are nowhere near the enthusiast I am. Said my dad, ""That might be the best beer I've ever tasted."" My sister: ""Mmmm... I LIKE THAT."" My mother: ""Wow. That is good."" There you have it, folks. This is why Bourbon County is the king of barrel-aged beers."
"Overall, the best stout I've ever had. The balance, mouthfeel, and coffee make it the most outstanding beer that I've ever had the pleasure of partaking. Heady topper is outstanding, but the complexity of this astounds. BCBS is amazing, but this takes it to another level."
"O: Quite a treat. But it's so massive that it's almost exhausting to drink. Should have split it with someone. A bomber to myself was a lot of work. What else needs to be said? Really happy I was able to drink this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I've been seeking this out for a while, and it definitely lives up to the hype. The flavors play off each other so well. Usually a BA stout is a bourbon bomb, this one uses the bourbon flavors as a compliment and not the focus. The coffee flavors are not bitter, but smooth. Again the coffee flavor is a compliment and in no way over powers the beer. Add in the sweet vanilla, caramel, dark fruit, and other great compliments and you get a truly world class stout."
""

"Very nice overall. Unlike most beers so its hard to compare it to others, but a very tasty drink."

"Moderate carbonation, thick in the mouth (but lifted off the tongue by carbonation and clean alcohol sting), and has a lingering warming. An acidity associated with the coffee is a bit to astringent for my preferences."

"This meets all expectations and may be one of the best beers I have ever had. Incredibly smooth. Not much heat from the bourbon barrels, and a solid mix from the coffee. I am sure this would be good with age, but it is great now. Age it too long and I think it would lose a lot of the coffee flavor that makes this a great beer."
""
"O-amesome stout even thou I don't like coffee, hinds the ABV well. A must try!"
""
""
"Overall, just an amazingly decadent and worthwhile beer. It's one of the best coffee beers I've had, and if you further narrow down to best barrel-aged coffee beer, it's probably THE best. It's amazingly smooth and rich, but still has some bite from the coffee and ABV. This is one I'd have over and over again i it were easier to procure."

It's one of those beers that I would love once or twice a year, but I think I prefer BCBS for more frequent consumption as it seems less sweet overall. Still, BCBS Coffee is an exceptional beer."

I've torn through this way too quick... good on them for resisting temptation to put out a weekly batch of this - they could be bagillionaires...."
"This beer made sweet sweet love to my mouth. Not a violent thrashing, but like a satin sheets order room service in the morning sort of way. On par with KBS although this offering is slightly better than the 2012 KBS that I have in my beer fridge. I can't even deduct points because it's owned by Budweiser! The vanilla and toffee tones are outstanding. The high alcohol is well hidden. Cheers to Goose Island for living up to the hype on this one. Now if only they could make a decent IPA..."

"Inky black pour, initial foamy khaki colored head that settles after a while. Aroma is the highlight of this one with some sweet tiramisu note, whiff of bourbon and the smell of a coffee grinder as it is grinding your dark roast coffee. Big bold flavor with a bourbon front end onslaught, some strong espresso notes hanging around in the back end."
"I've been reviewing beers on this website for 8 years now with 1,544 reviews and this is my FIRST beer that I have rated a perfect 5.0. I can go back and forth with Bourbon County Barleywine and Stout debating which is better. They are both great in their own unique ways. However, Bourbon County Coffee Stout is on another level. This beer is damn perfect with a ton of coffee and bourbon notes in the aroma and taste to go along with roasted malts. Overall, this has to be my favorite beer I've every tried. HIGHLY recommended! Cheers!"
""

"Big espresso and dark choc bitterness with great cocoa and vanilla sweetness and a great smokey quality attributed to the barrel aging. Plays off the base stout and bourbon barrels fantastically. Noticeable alcohol presence but not overwhelming. Excellent mouthfeel. Full bodied and slick. Just a fantastic beer!"
"My Christmas present to myself! Poured from bottle into pint glass, with minimal head notwithstanding intentional efforts to render big foam with an aggressive pour (perhaps I served it too cold). Lots of tiny mocha bubbles in deep, dark background. The view is like looking into an inviting black hole, enticing the viewer to leap into the abyss. The smell is off the charts, like the love you lost in college. And that first taste reminds me of my first hint of eroticism...mystical and captivating, yielding pangs of guilty pleasure (somehow, I know what I am about to do must be illegal). The coffee flavors are almost too intense and overpowering, but not quite. Toffee, vanilla, espresso, and caramel all appear here. And the finish is so silky smooth and sweet that I didn't realize the entire experience was over, until it was. Alas, BCBCS will tease and intrigue forever, and I shall continue touts for her now more than ever. One taste is both my original sin and my eternal condemnation..."

"O: I could sip on this for daaays, but alas.. my only bottle. Huge Stout with a chocolate/vanilla/caramel forward malt bill with a subtle barrel character mixed with a great espresso/coffee flavor, how could you go wrong."
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-heavy to heavy in body, with medium-low carbonation, leading to a slightly fizzy, then slighty foamy and smooth mouthfeel with obvious ethanol heat and burn. The ethanol is felt across the palate, as expected for an ABV of this degree, with modest heat in the nostrils. Closes dry, with substantial stickiness lingering on the palate."

"Definitely a sipping beer. Tons of flavor and alcohol. It's a bit of a Catch-22 beer. It should be cellared for a while to mellow the alcohol, but if you cellar it the coffee will fade."
"Thanks GI."
"O - This is the most coffee-forward beer I have had. With the exception of coffee, and bourbon, I'm not picking up a lot of other flavors. This leaves me feeling like I just had a strong cup of black coffee. This would probably be amazing with some age on it, mellowing the extreme coffee, and the alcohol burn."

"O - An amazing coffee stout. So coffee forward that it tastes like espresso beans laced with chocolate and bourbon. There is moderate balance to the beer but prepare for mostly a bitter coffee profile with dark chocolate and fruit characteristics that finishes roasty and dry. Well done!"
"Midnight black, thick pour with a quickly receding finger of head. The aroma is to die for, like sticking your head into a bag of fine, fresh roasted coffee beans. The flavor opens up, beginning with powerful espresso notes, and segueing seamlessly into deep, dark chocolate, followed by vanilla beans, and finally, lovely bourbon. The body is syrupy and rich, although perhaps a bit thinner than regular BCBS, due to the coffee infusion. The finish may also be a tad less lengthy, but the intensity is greater, as it positively envelops the palate in a crescendo of flavors. This is, hands down, my favorite coffee stout, and perhaps my favorite stout in general. Well worth the hunt."
""
""
""
"Make no mistake about it. It's a World Class beer now, but if age integrates the base beer & Bourbon into the coffee over time, another year may make this 2013 vintage the beer that deserves it's current rating....for my palate at least."
"O- This is the first time I've gotten to try this beer. A phenomenal beer truly one of the worlds best beers. It seems to be hard find and with the wider Goose Island distribution less of it is coming to local places and I only was able to get one bottle. But I feel lucky to have this one bottle for it is an amazing beer."
""
"My first experience with this bee is with this 2013 release. I can understand the high appeal of this gargantuan dark ale if past releases have been similar. Flavor is king to me, and this one deserves a rarely given “5” in that department with color (ok, so there's no sub-category for color, but it was near perfect as far as appearance goes) and aroma scores up there, too. If only the head would have been thicker and longer lasting, or even traces of lacing on the glass, and some of my lower “4” ratings may have gotten bumped up a quarter or even half point. Ah, but when you have incredible taste overall, these minor gripes are just that. Think I'll pursue the rest of my glass with an eye-rolling satisfaction while jazz tunes float in the background..."

"O:This beer lives up to the hype and worth the chase.Now I understand why it is the top rated Stout on BA.So far the best stout I have encountered to date.It is masterfully crafted to blow your mind and seduce your palate.The only thing to regret here is that I should of bought a case of this for myself to holdme off till next year.If I had four hands I would give it four thumbs up."

"The beer pours an inky, midnight black, much like regular BCBS, a dark tan head briefly forms and then fizzles away to a scrim; the head is slightly lighter than the head that forms on BCBS. In body, the beer is thick, viscous, and opaque, and when swirled, the beer leaves a brief set of alcoholic legs on the glass. On the nose, the beer shows its departure from regular BCBS. Rich fruity coffee buffets the nose with just a trailing hint of spicy solvent and alcohol. The coffee smells of a beautiful medium roast, moving from cocoa beans, to touches of vanilla, dark chocolate, earth, cinnamon, nutmeg, and even a touch of chili powder as the coffee interacts with the spicy alcohol. This beer has a truly delicious nose to it, reminiscent of sticking your head inside a bag of fresh coffee beans. The stout beneath the coffee does get a little confused in the richness of the coffee, blending in places, and muting in others, but I’m not all that disappointed by that as I see this beer’s nose as a vast improvement over the boozy BCBS. The barrel is light in the nose, but seems to be contributing to the vanilla notes, and perhaps also the slight boozy notes. On the tongue, the beer tastes richly complex, blending fruity coffee, rich bourbon barrels, and boozy stout. Sweetness pairs well with the bitters of the coffee, creating a nearly chocolaty sweetness, while rounded tannins lightly touch the finish and provide mild structure in the mouth. Coffee acidity is also present, giving the beer a slight tingle. In flavor, this beer is far superior to BCBS at this age. Rich, fruity coffee beautifully blends with the barrel as the beer touches the tongue bringing fresh medium roast coffee, prunes, earth, and rich dark chocolate flavors. Vanilla and soft oak dance alongside the coffee notes as faint roasted malt character is sensed along the edges of the flavor. As the beer splashes over the back of the throat, hot alcohol does come through, providing spicy notes of cinnamon to coincide with the rich coffee flavors as the coffee is slightly muted. The finish is briefer than BCBS, bringing notes of raw coffee beans, and then freshly brewed coffee, as well as spicy alcohol. In the mouth, the beer is full and slippery, feeling thinner than BCBS but still full with a silky mouthfeel and weak carbonation. The beer remains chewy and luscious, though the coffee has certainly diluted the initial fullness of the beer. Alcohol is smooth and warming, with just a touch of bite. Overall, I like this beer more than I like BCBS. I’ll admit that part of that is how the coffee hides the alcoholic bite in this beer, but I’m also a coffee-lover and the coffee flavors found in this beer are rich and complex, beautifully blending with the barrel aging. This beer is not KBS, however close it might come, and does still carry some booziness in the finish. I wouldn’t age this bottle for more than a couple months, seeing as how the awesome coffee flavors will die out, but I would certainly advise picking up a bottle and trying this puppy out. Good stuff."

"O: A decadent treat to be sure. It isn't so much about complexity as it is a seamless melding of a handful of delicious and comforting flavors. The hefty malt body is silky smooth, and tempers any bite that the bourbon barrel brings. This is a very big and sweet beer, but still highly drinkable. It is this ease of drinkability that sets it apart from other beers of its ilk."

"Overall one of the best beer I have ever had the pleasure of having in my life if you have not had one find one its amazing...."
""
""
""

"Pours as dark as can be with no head. Smell is very strong of coffee, overpowering anything and everything else that the base has to offer. I love coffee, but this is a bit much. Taste is similar, but I do get a little more of the delicious chocolate and bourbon that I love so much about BCBS. Mouthfeel is slightly higher carbed than I expect for such a high ABV. Overall, I'm slightly disappointed in this based off of the hype and total rating. I do my best not to have raised expectations based on what everyone else thinks, but I did have high hopes for this. I like coffee, and I do like a handful of coffee beers, this is takes the coffee a little too far."
""
""
""
""
"O- Best of the Bourbon County series that I have had to the pleasure to drink. Love the bitterness of the coffee, I wish I was able to get more of this!"
"The only parts that weren't 5/5 were the appearance and the feel. A tad bit of a thicker head and more lacing on the glass would improve the appearance of the beverage. While the mouthfeel may not be as full-bodied as some would like from this, the creamy silkiness makes up for it."

"Having this by the way with the actual coffee used, Los Immortales, is an incredible experience. I would say I prefer 2012 though."

"like a morning cup o' joe . . . . thought I would not like this one because I don't like a whole lot o' coffee in my beer... but this is darned good. very syrup-y, a little thick, very coffee-flavored. great stout, the coffee stout isn't as good as the regular stout but it's a nice twist, especially as most stouts seem to have a little coffee in them. glad I got to try this one...."
""
"Overall? The best beer I have had to date by a rather large margin. I'm actually upset that I only have 1 bottle to enjoy for now. This is about as perfect as beer gets for me as of 12/8/13."
""
"O: Wow! what I great beer! I have waited patiently for a few years hopeing to get my hands on this. Idk how it compares to previous vintages, but I don't see how it could get much better. I have not had the regular BCBS yet because I thought the coffee may die quicker in this one and at 14 ABV, I think I may lay them down for a little while. Can't say enough good about this beer. Happy I can look forward to this every year from now on. InBev better not F up such a good thing! Overall its a five and I can't wait to try the BCBS and BCBBW I have waiting!"
""
"Overall, an excellent beer worthy of the hype bestowed upon it. If more easy to get a hold of, I'd drink this regularly."

"O: Fantastic beer, and to me, slightly better than the original. I honestly expected a bit more coffee, but this was still great and did not disappoint. I just wish I had more bottles!"
""
""
""
"Oh my lord, this is utterly fantastic, and I think the only time I've ever even considered giving a perfect rating to a beer. There is simply nothing that I can even fathom that would make this beer one iota better. Silky smooth, deep, complex dark coffee in every sip and sniff and warm bourbon throughout. The absolute epitome of what a coffee stout should be. I cannot even do it justice trying to describe it so I will leave it with simply this: One of the best beers on the planet. Period."
"Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout ---5/5."
""
"No head on a jet black body. Very simple appearance, not much to it. Aroma is dominated by coffee but like the base beer its a bit mild for what I want. Aroma has coffee, dark fruits, Smoked malts and little else. This basically smells like a freshly opened bag of dark roast. Flavor is much better and much more dynamic than the aroma. I am getting vanilla, lots of dark roast coffee of course, some milk chocolate, little booze for ABV and peat/roasted malts. The coffee competes with the bourbon making it slightly less apparent than the base beer which is too bad. The body seems lighter than the base beer to me having had them back to back but still full with light to moderate carbonation. Still though the feel can't get better. excellent combo of stout, coffee and bourbon. Doesn't get much better."
""
""
"Overall, I prefer this to the original BCBS. The coffee is a nice addition. I don't know if I'd necessarily call it mind-blowing, but it certainly is a great stout. I wish I had been able to get more than 1 bottle so I could try it with some age."

"o; Excellent coffee stout. Surprisingly light mouthfeel for a stout. Seems the main contribution of the bourbon barrel aging besides the initial aroma is the higher ABV."
""
""
"Pours a motor oil black with a thin chocolate head that fizzles away rather quickly. Almost no signs of lace along the sides of the glass. The aroma is of strong coffee with a slight hint of boozy bourbon. This aroma would be comparable to taking a big whiff of a bag of fresh coffee beans. Taste is right in line with the smell, strong notes of fresh coffee with the slightest touch of bourbon and vanilla. Perfection. Super warm mouthful from the 13.4% ABV, but is smooth and well balanced. Wow, this is a prime example of how a coffee stout should be. The base beer is amazing, but with the addition of coffee beans this beer jumps up to the elite standards."
"O: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easy, not too filling, very strong kick, excellent representation of style, this is definitely one of the best coffee beers I’ve ever had."
""
"O - If the coffee was this prominent after a year, it must have been really strong at first. This is such a lovely beer to drink. This is one of THE top coffee stouts ever."

"O-This is probably the best coffee stout I've ever had. Is it a top-5 of all-time? I don't know about that, but it is a damn good beer. The smell and flavor are pretty incredible...complex, smooth, intense, and well-integrated. The look is a little odd; a bit like actual coffee instead of beer and I was a little underwhelmed by the feel, which is on the thin side. These are pretty minor criticisms, however. I would happily drink this again. And again. And probably again."
"Re-re-review: Cracked open a 2014 vintage bottle today, 12/1/2014. Poured into an original Bourbon County snifter. For the most part, this beer is as it has always been. Rich bourbon, milk chocolate, more bourbon, balanced out by a nice clean acidic coffee flavour. Better as it warms up. Gets more barrel flavours as it warms up although when it gets room temperature warm, it's not quite as good. So I would enjoy it at cellar temperature when possible. Good mouthfeel, a bit thinner than my memory of previous vintages, but slick and with no heat. Fantastic coffee stout, the best one out there, really."
""
""
""
"The 2013 version did not disappoint. Great Coffee Flavor with a good mix of Bourbon taste. I can't wait to taste this again down the road next year and the year after. It should Age really well. The only real knock I have is that when it's poured, it really doesn't have great legs in the glass. But the Flavors more than make up for it!"
"Same color and appearance, much more coffee and bourbon this go around on the nose and in flavor. Way better fresh on this beer. Gotta bump my ratings up now..."

""

"T: A rich blend of espresso and heavily roasted coffee with bourbon and chocolate syrup. Chocolate cake, caramel, slightly charred barrel note, baking chocolate, mocha and some burnt brownies. Slight dryness on the finish from the alcohol, but it's really well hidden. This beer is awesome."

"O- I've had every vintage of BCBCS so far and none of them have disappointed so far. They easily set the standard for coffee beers. While they age nicely, I prefer them slightly more fresh. The different roasts each year bring out their own individual characteristics. The ""Los Immortales"" this year brings out a nice sweetness while lending a slight bitterness and acidity on the palate."

"O: Really great beer. I enjoyed it a little less than the standard Bourbon County Brand Stout. In fact, I thought it was overall extremely similar other than the slightly higher emphasis on coffee in the taste. An amazing treat!"

"I was advised not to let this bottle go too long (dated 11/12/12) as the coffee flavors are reported to fade despite the label stating ""Develops for up to 5 years in the bottle."" This was the 2012 release w/La Tortuga coffee beans. Smooth and rich, bold and boozy, this is a BIG stout that has a lot to offer and comes highly recommended if you can get your hands on it."

""
""

"OV: A very good Stout, though not the mind blowing experience others have stated about this beer. Not enough coffee flavour for me, though you can usually cellar high octane brews like this for 6-12+ months, I've heard this one can lose some of it's coffee flavour past 6 months of bottling (this is probably at 11 months right now) so wonder if this is the case here. I've had FBS nearly a year old that tasted no different than one less than a month old, so no excuses for this beer. Very good, but not the coffee infused milk from angels' teets."

"EDIT: my above review is of over a year old version...recently had the 2013 version and the coffee was definitely more prominent. Bumping up the rating accordingly."
"This ranks up there with Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Proprietor's Stout. Got to share this awesome Coffee Stout at a Alchemist Heady Topper tasting that I did in Chicago on 6/5. After the Heady Topper was gone, the guests dragged out and a couple of 12 ounce bottles of the Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Coffee Shout and a bomber of the Bruery's Black Tuesday. I rated both beers the same score, and both were top of the line brews, but I would have to give the edge to Black Tuesday. But I might have flipped the edge if I had the Black Tuesday first. Both were just a total joy to consume; especially with all my new friends that came to share my Heady Topper Tasting."

"This pours pitch black color with a slight brown head. The aroma is a mixture of coffee, bourbon, and sweet caramel malt. There are so many complex flavors that your taste buds are overwhelmed by the taste. What else can I say other than it is some sweet, coffee stout, goodness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-fantastic stout, a yardstick by which other barrel-aged stouts can be measured"
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a jet black coloring, oily consistency, with a light tan colored head, thin and filmy. Aromas of earth, oak, booze, vanilla, molasses, chocolate, roast and hints of char. Very rich and robust nose. Flavors of booze forward, with a heavy bourbon/vanilla rich and sweet follow, rich molasses and roast caramel blend in the backbone, bitter and roasted coffee notes, and some oaky/earthy notes. Amazingly and delicately balanced on a rich, smooth, dense body. The aftertaste is boozy, with a rich vanilla and coffee blend giving sweet and bitter characteristics. Smooth, creamy finish, with a bittersweet linger. Amazingly drinkable, but the warmth and booze builds quickly. This is tasty!"

"22 ounce bomber into a Goose Island tulip. 1/11/12 bottle date. Small beige head, low retention. Black body. Aroma includes marshmallow, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, bourbon, some alcohol and some of those wafer cookies. Taste follow suit with some molasses notes and brandy. Thick, viscous and rediculously good."
"Pours black and rests beneath a half-inch thick layer of brown, frothy head that resides for a couple of minutes. The aroma is of bourbon, oak, ground coffee, a bit of espresso, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, and a touch of almond and hazelnut towards the end. It tastes of bourbon, vanilla, coffee grounds, hazelnut, oak, maybe some cedar (or other dry wood), some nuts (almond, cashew), and chocolate with a nice roasted malt finish. Mouthfeel is lively, yet thick. It readily coats the mouth, but the carbonation keeps it from leaving a sticky residue. Finish is clean, but I wouldn’t call it dry. Overall, this is an impressive stout. The base beer is wonderful in its own right, and the addition of coffee adds a whole new dimension."

I can't wait to try the bottle of cherry rye that I have sitting in the cellar, to see how that compares to this."

"I experienced this brew back in the winter of 2012. I was at a nice restaurant at Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut. This beer has very high ABV and I don't mind that, but my thoughts they didn't do a very good job hiding the alcohol. Much too strong for my liking as the alcohol takes away the flavors of the beer."

"O: This is definitely one of my favorite beers. It slightly hedged out the KBS, primarily because of the MF. It was silky to the point it gained a 5.0 MF - perfection. This beer is defiantly worth hassle."
""
"On tap at a local fundraiser, the stout was a deep black color with a small mocha head. The aroma was quite boozy with notes of dark fruit and burnt malts in the aroma. On the initial taste one first notices the booze. After this, one notices a chalky texture filled with dark chocolate, cherry and chewy malts. The coffee seems fairly masked in the overall scope of the beer. In the aftertaste, the warming of the alcohol comes to the front. In addition, the burnt malts and chocolate continue to make an impression. While I enjoyed this one, I did not find myself as impressed as some people. Still, this is a way above average stout."

"Oh wow. Coffee like no other. Intelligentsia's Imortales beans are INTENSE! Not just any coffee, you can tell this is premium beans with its distinct aroma and flavor. 2013's BCBS is hot to begin with, and everything blends perfectly. Caramel colored head that dissipates rather quickly, just the right amount of carbonation to open your tastebuds. Compared to 2012, this blows it out of the water. It might blow every other BCBS this year out of the way. At the tasting, the beers included BCBS Barleywine, BCBS 2013, BCBS Coffee, BCBS Templeton Rye, BCBS Backyard Rye & BCBS Proprietor's. I saved a small and equal portions of each for a grand cru.. and this still came out prevalent. I don't think I even want coffee anymore, I just want this. The perfect coffee stout to me so far."

"Pours jet black with a small ring of dark brown bubbles. Smells like a chocolate covered roasted marshmellow, with a slight alcohol presence. Taste starts off with some faded coffee and tons of chocolate and ends with a nice warming bit of bourbon barrel. Carbonation is soft and mouthfeel is on the thicker side. I have had this beer fresh and it was probably a 4.5 overall but with a few years on it an amazingly complex beer has devolped, glad I held onto this one."

"This beer is awesome! If you love coffee and bourbon, this is your beer. The BCBCS is a strong one for sure. It's aroma is the perfect blend of black coffee and a good bourbon. Very thick, really sweet to the taste. Bourbon dominates the coffee in flavor but there's still enough there to make it the perfect combination."

"Very very good. Glad I am finally trying this. I have not had it fresh, so I am not sure where the coffee character should be, but if I believe the critics, fresher is better. I'd say coffee was less prominent than I anticipated. Overall, excellent beer. Cheers."
"Jet black, ring of tan head, no lace and fairly thick bodied. Smell is a mix of roast and fresh coffee beans, bourbon, vanilla, oak and chocolate, big fudge cake notes as well, milky chocolate mixed with bakers, just outstanding. Taste is like the nose great mix of bourbon, coffee and roast, chocolate, fudge, vanilla, bitter coffee finish, oak in aftertaste with chocolate and coffee. Lightly carbonated, full chewy body, big thick mouth coating feel. Absolutely incredible stuff here, such a delight to drink, takes BA coffee stouts to a whole new level, very impressive stuff here."

"O- Just a world class BBA imperial stout, and the coffee brings it to another level! One of the best variants of one of the best BBA stouts in the world!"
"Overall: My favorite Goose Island Beer to date, a truly excellent example of a bourbon barrel coffee stout."
""
""
""
"O- All in all, im very glad I saved this one several months to enjoy on my birthday. But having had it, I don't think my willpower will be the same next year. Having just had an extremely comparable beer, KBS, the other day, I can attest to this beers superiority all though they are both world class. This is the best in the business."
"The coffee was a bit more subtle than I expected but this is still a very tasty beer. Definately glad to try it and hopefully I'll be able to get more in the future."
""
"One of my favorites beers yet! Shared with great friends for the celebration of my first child's birth."
"This my favorite of all the BCS. I did notice on this I had that the coffee is starting to fade which I wasn't to happy about. But at the same time it was subtle. And whats the worst thing when the coffee fades. It just turns into regular BCS which isn't the worst thing in the world. But fresh is best with this one."
""
""
"O: I expected more coffee out of this vintage. This also has a quality I don't recall from the 2010 vintage, and as such, it's good, but it's not the best of the lineup. Still worthy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I know this variant seems to be more limited, but it is worth seeking out. Try drinking it earlier in the day as this late night version had me wired with the huge coffee presence. Great beer indeed."

"Overall, this is a fantastic brew. This one could have probably aged a bit longer to suit my personal tastes, but without a doubt is impressive at any age. I think in it's current state, the coffee tends to move the alcohol flavor too forward for me. That being said, I don't think I'd pass up a chance to drink this again."

"Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout is simply incredible. A coffee-stout lover's wet dream in a bottle. Just a maniacal explosion of coffee beans; roasty, bitter, creamy, and sweet all at once. Crazy oak, bourbon, vanilla, and cocoa tones with a nearly perfect balance. Sweet and warming with such an amazing delicacy. Insanely drinkable for such a high ABV. I battled over and over in my mind if I liked this better than the original BCS (especially the '08 vintage) and it took me a while to decide, but I believe this is top dog. Nevertheless, if its got Bourbon County on the label, you really can't go wrong."
"Overall, this is an amazing bottle of beer, and remarkable for not only how flavorful, nuanced, and potent it is, but for how utterly smooth and drinkable at the same time. Many high ABV beers end up being vodka or bourbon bombs, but this is so highly polished that it slides seamlessly down the throat, and is dangerously quaffable. One of the best bourbon-barrel-and-coffee beers on the market."
""
"So thick, so sweet, so boozy, yet amazingly sooo drinkable…this beer let me down at first because there was basically no major coffee presence, but after I got over that point I realized that this is one of the best beers that I’ve ever had. A “Top 5 Beer” for me, which is making typing this difficult because the ABV is kicking in, but this review is worth writing to boast about this unbelievably complex and tasty beer that hides the ABV perfectly and goes down easier than it should. A very high recommendation, buy a bottle of this if you can. It will be worth every penny spent."

"O: This is a fantastic beer. Yes, the coffee has faded. But, it is still there and adds a little something. Having had this fresh on tap at Top Hops in NYC, it is a very different beer. The 2012 was hugely coffee forward, and the bourbon was even more present. It was abrasive, but in a great way. I do believe that is what the brewers intended for this beer. Having said that, the 2011, even with the faded coffee, is an awesome beer and super drinkable. I would drink this often, but for very different reasons than BCBS and fresh BCBCS. It's a different animal. Loved it. Thanks again, Brad!"

"this is a very nice stout but a little bit TOO sweet for me. it makes sense since i always take my coffee black with no sugar. a nice effort at least, but i've had way better coffee stouts leaning more towards my liking."
"Honestly couldn't tell this apart from the '13 fresh bottle. Same Intelligensia aromas, same texture and flavors. Loving the fact that it's been consistent so far."

"What an incredible beer. If I didn't have such a sensitivity to coffee beers, I would have drunk the entire bottle. The appearance, aroma, and mouthfeel were great. Beautiful and creamy, just a smooth and delicious brew from Goose Island. They are really coming into their own, and this beer is further evidence of that fact."

"I think this beer is at its perfect stage. Any longer and the coffee might fade, but it still crushes regular BCBS!"
"O: Quite possibly the best coffee stout I've had. My favorite BCBS variant so far, surpassing Vanilla and the legendary Rare. I'll have to try Cherry Rye and Bramble soon."
""
""
""
"O: A giant sipper, my personal preference liked the non coffee version better. This is a beer to savor, and savor I did. I loved it till the last drop."

""
"O: Overall this beer isn't what I was expecting, but not in a bad way. I thought there would be a lot more coffee going on, but instead it just tastes like a more complex version of the base beer, BCBS, which is absolutely awesome. This is a true sipping beer, what a decadent treat. I'm tackling this bomber alone and it will probably take me near two hours to drink all of it, but I'll savor every sip. Huge thanks again to my good buddy Nick (durb777) for sending this to me. Hopefully I'll get to try BCBS Cherry Rye one day, but for now I'm totally happy just having this, and knowing that I have a few bottles of plain BCBS in the cellar. I don't give a shit about Goose Island being owned by the ""enemy"" as long as they keep producing mind blowing beers like this."
""
"overall - my absolute favorite beer. as a lover of stouts, bourbon, and coffee - it doesn't get any better than this. Glad they put it in 12oz bottle this year. Only was able to get a single bomber last year. Got 3 12ozers this year so great to try one fresh, then try the next two after 6-12 months"
""

"D: There wasn't as much coffee as expected, with coconut character from bourbon barrels dominating. But it still had an amazing scent and taste and body. The finish was really smooth, and the alcohol was decently hidden. So it was surprisingly easy to drink, but should be sipped. With not a ton of coffee character already, there isn't much to lose by aging. But it's not really necessary to sit on this brew, since it's already pretty amazing and drinkable now. Yum!"
""
"After missing out on previous varietal offerings of BCBS, I was able t get ahold of this year's coffee - in spades - after 6 bombers and 2 growlers since it hit the shelves here, I feel very fortunate - It's as good as everyone says it is and lives up to the hype - the coffee flavor is slight and it elevates BCBS to another level - incredibly smooth and easy drinking, especially from the growlers (so watch out!) - great stuff!"
""
""
"Pours black like some nice, inviting motor oil with a nice mocha colored head. Aroma offers all the same characteristics of the original (bournon and its barrel, chocolate, a little roastiness) in addition to some coffee beans, which are there but far from being as aggressive or bold as I expected and hoped for. Flavor offered everything the original offered, though perhaps a touch lighter on the bourbon and its barrels, and just a touch of some subtle coffeee. Honestly, were this a blind taste test I do not know if I could have differentiated between this and the original. A great beer but I docked points because I was hoping for a hopped up coffee version of BCBS and I didn't find that here in all honesty. A full, creamy, velvety mouthfeel. Overall, this a great beer. BCBS is a great beer too. I'll take the original version over this as I liked that it has more bourbon and its barrel character than this, but also (and probably more importantly) when you put 'coffee' in the title I go in with certain expectations for the beer (big, bold coffee flavors) and personally felt that this did not deliver in that respect. Still, a fantastic, fantastic beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a terrific barrel-aged coffee stout. I didn't know how the coffee and bourbon would interact, but neither overpowers, and they work together seamlessly."
""
"Really loved this beer. Everything from the appearance to the smell to the taste was amazing. I'm a big fan of Coffee stouts and BCBS and this brought everything together in one place. Really pleased. Hard to find in NoVA, but what is new? Happy to grab a bottle at Chevy Chase liquor in downtown DC."

"O: Wow – great imperial coffee stout. A nice sipping beer @ 14 % alcohol by volume."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is great in bottles but turns into a huge coffee bomb on draft. Black with gorgeous crimson and brown highlights as the glass empties. The aroma is so thick and rich with coffee, starts slowly but really opens up as it warms. Coffee, bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, roast, and finishes dry, sweet and more coffee. This was even better than the Cherry Rye and the best beer Ive had. Im amazed how much better this is on draft. Did I mention coffee?"

""
""
""

""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is really excellent beer. I have stated again and again that I like stouts with more of a burnt/roasty flavor to stouts that are sweet and stone fruit forward. The coffee in this beer cuts down on the raisin flavors of regular bourbon county, but it's still just too sweet for me to absolutely love this beer. But, with that said, I'd drink this again in a heartbeat."

"O- I am extremely surprised how much I enjoy this beer. The coffee is extremely fantastic, but doesn't hold well. This is my second bottle of this years batch, and honestly I can already taste a difference from the last bottle I drank a few weeks ago. Drink it now! After my first bottle I had to find more, and was lucky to get a couple more 4pks. Lastly, for those who don't like coffee beers, you may not enjoy this beer but I feel like you would be able to appreciate a taste and how complex this beer is without being overburdened by the coffee like prior years."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is extremely enjoyable but should definitely be thought of as a big beer - intense flavors, aromas, and high ABV make this a beer best enjoyed by slowly sipping throughout the evening. The coffee addition really makes this beer great, even better than BCBS - which is quite an accomplishment."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Of the three BCBS beers that I’ve had (BCBS, Cherry Rye, Coffee), this is definitely my least favorite. It’s a little too sharp for my tastes- some might find that appealing though. It’s a complex sipping beer that is worth meditating on, but odds are I would not seek this out again. Glad I got to try it though, and it definitely gets better as it warms"
"This beer is outstanding. The coffee notes only enhance the Bourbon County experience. It shines through and allows the bourbon, vanilla and roast to come across as it normally does. Well done."

"Rating is highest score of all vintages."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a pretty good coffee stout, however there is nothing here that you can't get with any other well made coffee stout. The only thing that really stands out about it is how smooth the coffee is. Worth picking up if you see one though as its still pretty good."
""
""
"Overall: Truly an excellent beer, but ends up a bit unbalanced with the bourbon/vanilla onslaught and the overly sweet finish. Definitely more in-your-face than, say, a KBS, but could really use some balance. Still a truly excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is exactly as expected, it is excellent. Huge flavor and alcohol, yet so smooth and delicious that you could sip on it all night and not even realize you are drinking a massive 14% beer and you probably won't be able to feel your legs when you stand. This is by far my favorite GI BCS (haven't had my Rare yet, so for now it will remain), the addition of the coffee beans really does this beer well."
""
"This is great. The coffee aroma and flavor is great. The only thing stopping me from rating this higher is Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout... This is awesome, but slightly less awesome. The bourbon notes are still quite strong. A lovely sipper, to say the least."
"Damn good, but not the most standout of the variants. Although, matching Vanilla and KH is almost impossible. Fresh is next."
""
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
""
""
""

"O: Wow so this is a great beer definitely an upgrade to the regular BSBS and i really like the addition of coffee taste as it blends quite well with the bourbon taste. The only thing that I will say is that I wish there was a little more balance between the coffee and bourbon but that is some serious nit picking as this is a truly phenomenal beer."
""
"Overall, an amazing beer. So glad I finally go got to try it. Would definitely have again and seek out. Glad I got 2 bottles so I can see what some age does to the other one. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"O- This may be a bit better than the 2012 original BCBS. Completely ready to drink. Do not age. Definitely better than the original batch of BCBCS a couple of years ago that everyone went bonkers for."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of my favorite beers ever."
""
""
"Was looking forward to this for some time and it did not disappoint. The smell was perfect. Coffee and a hint of bourbon. Taste and mouthfeel was perfection. Based on this gem I look forward to trying the other selections from Goose Island. If they are anything close to this I won't be disappointed."
"Expectation and hype were fulfilled in a tremendous offering from Goose Island."

"O- my first glass of goose bcbs brand ... does not disappoint, lives up to the hype ... and I want more! Seriously I want more"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- this beer totally lived up to the billing. Great coffee on top of an almost perfect base. Delicious."

""

"Pours black as black can be, with small tan head that dissapears quickly. Great nose, lots of Bourbon, a lot like regular bcbs just with a light scent of coffee. Tastes litterally identical to bcbs, but with a wee bit of coffee up front, and a bit of a burnt coffee aftertaste, but in a good way. Lots of bourbony goodness, but never overpowering, and a great stouty base. Moutfeel is almost perfect, but if they could take the mouthfeel from Baudenia, and replace it with this, it would be perfect. Overall, great beer, and the third installment of the Bourbon County line that I have had the priviledge of tasting. Only complaint- could use some more coffee, otherwise, it just kinda tastes like the original... which is fine."

"Keeping it simple folks, really the buck stops here...best in show! IMO the best coffee stout in North America. GI, hands down, has set the benchmark for greatness. Priveleged to obtain on-tap."

"been waiting to crack this for awhile now and finally the time was right. the pour was lacking much carbonation, but thats to be expected from the barrel aging process. dark dark brown murky liquid, not as thick or syrupy as i was anticipating, and just a thin rim of moca lacing. the nose is wonderful, this beers best feature i thought. lots and lots of fresh coffee flavors, like just used espresso grounds, minus the acid. i really dont smell too much alcohol either surprisingly, just a lot of roasty malt with the coffee. the flavor isnt as coffee heavy as it smells, and i thought that was a bit of a let down, i was kind of hoping for a coffee bomb, and this is a lot more refined than that, well done. no acid at all, and plenty of vanilla and charcoal rubbed off from the barrel, it all really comes together. again, the alcohol is amazingly well hidden for such a big beer, even when its warm i dont feel too bad a burn for 14% abv. the coffee has no acidity at all, which is a delight as well. mouthfeel is a little thick without much carbonation at all. i dont remember the regular bourbon county being so flat, but that was from a tap and this was bottles, so who knows. still velvet mousse texture, really lovely and artfully done. this was a gem, equally delicious as the standard edition, but in a lot of ways i liked this better. worth every bit of the hype in my opinion!"

"D: A deceptively easy drinker. 14.3% will catch up with you. A simply phenomenal brew, but definitely what I'd expect from a BCS variant. Seek it out if you can!"

"O- Just a great beer. Huge bourbon and coffee."

"While not as coffee-forward as I'd have liked, BCBCS is a tremendous beer, every bit as worthy as its reputation suggests. I'd give it a very slight edge over BCBS."
""
""
""
"Overall is this is an excellent Imperial Stout with a great blend of coffee and roasted malt with a nice touch of bourbon. I was pleasantly surprised that at 14% ABV the bourbon didn't overwhelm the taste. I trul hope I will have an opportunity to enjoy this beer again in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an above average barrel aged stout. Just a little too much coffee."
""
""
""
""
"O: The coffee adds a nice layer of complexity to an already very complex beer. Of course a little pricey, but worth it. Recommended"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Easily the best coffee stout I've ever had. This is the beer I wished KBS would be. Huge coffee and chocolate. Perfectly balanced barrel presence. One of the best BA beers I've had, probably only behind Bourbon County Vanilla and Bourbon County Rare. Amazing."

"A very good take on the BCBS and absolutely worth a try."

"This was a 2011 vintage, so as expected, the coffee presence took a little hit, but it's still there, and it all balances nicely together. One of the best stouts I've had."
"Overall: It took a nearly a year, but I finally have my first perfectly scored beer. The only real fault that this elixir has is the lack of immediate bitterness to balance out the extreme (yet not cloying) sweetness. It improves upon 2012 BCBS in every way, and is simply as close to perfect in every way as is possible. If more of this is what will come of GI’s purchase by AB/InBev, I, for one, welcome our new macro overlords. 20/20"
""

"22oz bottle with a Bottled On Date of 11/12/12. 14.3 ABV according to the bottle. Pours a pitch black color with an inch of thick, brown head. The aroma is a big whiff of booze along with roasted malts, chocolate and vanilla. Not noticing much coffee. The taste is bourbon upfront followed by the coffee. Sweet and boozey but not cloyingly sweet. Vanilla and coffee towards the end. Warming alcohol finish. Honestly, there isn't a huge difference between this one and the regular Bourbon County. You can taste some coffee but there isn't a whole lot. Heavy mouthfeel. $20 for 1 bottle compared to $24 for a 4 pack of Bourbon County makes this a one time buy; maybe pick up a second for the right price to age. Overall, its a damn fine beer but just isn't a major change from the Bourbon County."
""
""
""
"O - I'm glad to have tried it, but for whatever reason it is very similar to its base beer. Still an awesome beer but temper the hoopla accordingly."
""
""
""
"O-I really enjoy the Bourbon County Stouts. This is my first time trying coffee and wish I picked up more of the coffee flavor. Could just be me. Thought it wasn't quite as thick as regular, but still very nice. Overall, still a damn good and very well balanced barrel aged stout."
""
""
"O- A good variation of BCBS. Not as much coffee flavor as I would have liked or expected but it didn't disappoint. I definitely overpaid for this beer at $25 before tax but it was definitely an awesome beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"MF- Not quite as full as I was expecting, but just as silky smooth as it should be. Incredible. Again, not as thick as I thought it would be, but the texture is fantastic and the flavors linger for a long time!"
"O- I've had RIS' with slightly better mouthfeel, smell and legs... but none have really tasted as this little piece of the ""Hall"" genious year after year. What they started, and has continued without them, is just a drinking experience like no other."
"O - well, it doesn't seem as thick and syrupy as regular BCBS, and that may or may not be the only knock on this beer; the coffee infusion is remarkable...perfectly balanced; there's plenty of flavor and it develops well after a pour and rest; I am really looking forward to seeing how this ages and imagine the heat, and unfortunately the coffee, will subside a bit. Amazing beer."
""
""
"O: This should be illegal in the lower 48 it's that good on the palate. Like I said in the taste comments, it's hard to fathom that this is a 14% beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Got this anticipating another great one like the bcbs but it was a disappointment. Very little coffee aroma or taste. I'm getting some raisin and molasses flavor. Great dark black color and tight carbonation formation that dissipated quickly. Not bad, but for $20 I just cant see it being worth the price. I liked Big John better. Smaller beer but for the price I thought it was a better value and had more coffee flavor, aroma, and not as hot. Too much hype over this beer."
"O/D-This is an exponential improvement upon the normal Bourbon County Brand Stout. Bourbon County Coffee is just so much more finely tuned and trained. I am very grateful to have tried this artisanal creation. Easily one of the best Stouts I have ever laid lip to."

"Another great from Goose Island. Very similar to the original BCBS with slight coffee character. Worth the money and hype, pick some of these up before the shelves are empty."

"Update 12/17/2013: Drinking the 2013 version and I'm getting much less bourbon barrel character and it's significantly more coffee forward. Still an amazing beer, but a small step down from the 2012 batch."
"An excellent example of its' style that should age fairly well over the years. I'd put a bottle away for aging if I were you."
"O: I didn't think this would be much better than BCBS - but I was wrong. Even though it's quite boozy, it's one of those offerings where the intense flavors render that problem moot. I'd even say it lives up to the hype. Good luck killing a bomber solo if you've already had a few drinks tonight, though...my body is saying 'no' but my tastebuds are saying 'fuck yes!'"
""
""
"The taste was a combination of bourbon and coffee with some vanilla and sweet candy mixed in. It was a very sweet beer and I wish I could specify the sweetness a little better but it was just a really good general sweetness."
""
"O - outstanding. The coffee element adds some nice complexity to this excellent barrel aged stout"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Oh yeah, full flavored and tongue bruising. Tasty and warming. Obviously a world class Impy Stout. Worth the premium price over the standard Bourbon County? NO."
""
""
""
"O- BCBCS is amazing. To make a brew that treats every property as an enhancement to the brew is amazing. I will give one negative.... NEED MORE BLACK COFFEE FLAVOR. It would then be a 5/5"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Delicious. The coffee is well integrated with the base. About what you would expect for a coffee version of BCBS. Drinkability is just so-so, as with regular BCBS, since it's so rich and full."
""
""
"Overall: This takes BCBS, which is great in and of itself and the addition of the coffee really rounds everything out so that there is only the mildest hint of alcohol in the taste."

"O: A much better beer than the standard Bourbon County Brand Stout. Now, is it worth $20 a bomber? I’d say no. But for a one-time experience, this was great – chocolaty, thick, and with impressive ranges for the coffee tones. A must-try."
"medium low carbonation, rather smooth on the palate. coffee flavor really comes to the forfront on this one just like the bourbon does on the normal one. there is also some bourboniness to this one too, (I was nervous about this at first but its really great) the coffee lingers then you get this awesome explosion of bourbon in the aftertaste!! Then comes that indescribable warming effect on the esophogus and into ye ole belly.... as Veruca Salt would say in the original Willy Wonka ""I can actually feel it""...ahhh nevermind. this one is COMPLETLY PERFECT in EVERY manner!! (I know i said that about the original one.... but this is even better!!!) buy this if you like coffee and bourbon, buy two... or leave them both for me!"

"O: I had this after trying BlAck Tuesday for the first time and I preferred this one. Just as flavorful but the creaminess and roasted coffee make this flawless. I rarely have beers i consider 5s but i dont really see how this could improve. If there's a better coffee stout out there someone please tell me about it. so far ive had the base beer, the vanilla and this and I think my new favorite is this. I'm happy I have another bottle to crack in a few months."
""
"I also tried at NOTLA on cask (notes not reflected here) and loved the gravity-fed version."
""
"Overall: This may be the best beer I've had so far in my beer drinking life. Super complex and the sweetness of the bourbon works ridiculously well with the coffee flavors. Now I know why this is so hard to come by. Off to the liquor store to buy more of these. Amazing!"
""
""
"O: Good drinkability. ABV is well hidden. Awesome, world class beer."
""
"O - If you have the chance to get this ... you absolutely should. I was very impressed with the true coffee flavors and aroma from this beer. I have had many coffee stouts and this one is a true winner."
""
"Overall: A really nice variation of teh regular Bourbon County. The chocolate cake and huge heat from the base are tempered by really smooth coffee. Extremely balanced for the ABV. The fresh burst of coffee is really well done. The execution is pretty flawless. As good as this variation is, the heat, barrel, and huge malt bill feel a little covered up. Really excellent fresh. I don't see this improving much with age. Certainly an excellent beer and a fast favorite. Still behind Rare and regular aged Bourbon County for my favorite of the series."

"O: Fantastic beer. Notable improvement over the regular Bourbon County Stout."

"Shared a bomber: pour my portion into a snifter. Pours really dark, viscous liquid with a small amount of tan foam, mainly around the perimeter of the glass. A lot of activity on the nose: bourbon, of course, plus a raisin sweetness, and a general dark chocolate roastiness. The coffee has faded a significant amount, but all of the other flavor blend together so well: just a roasty, dark chocolate, decadent treat. It reminds me of drinking a glass of flourless chocolate cake that has been soaking in booze."
""
"O: Just about as good as the regular BCBS. The coffee is integrated very subtly and adds some nice details to an already complex sipper. I would have thought there'd be more coffee here, and more to differentiate this variation from the regular version, but it's still an amazing beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: As a fresh brew, I have to admit, I like this better than regular BCBS. In the cellar after a year or two, I'm sure they go toe to toe. However, I feel that the added coffee in this variation subdues the Bourbon you taste, even though it's still there, and balances the beer so damn well. Can't imagine how good this will taste in a year+. KBS, beware!"

"A Perfect combination of sweet richness and strong bourbon flavor, topped off with a good amount of mellow oak smoke. I have been frequenting Goose Island for over 25 years, and this one is my favorite. One just needs to get lucky and be at the bar when they tap this monster."

""

""

"This is a great beer. It's hard to say that something is better than regular BCBS, but I feel I enjoyed this more. The coffee notes make it much more drinkable to me.

"In November of 2012 I gave this a 4.75. I haven't given any beer a 5. Today I drank a bottle of 2011. In a word, ""Wow."" Coffee, wood, bourbon and malt harmonizing like John, Paul , George and Ringo."
""
"O- Easily the best coffee stout (BA or not) made. I look forward to this one every year and wish I could get more than one bottle! 4.5"
""
"Edit - I lucked out on a fair amount of the 2013 release. On first try, holy lord. It's a lot more in-check and balanced than 2012 with a better coffee taste to it. The newer vintage really shines."

"Poured a muddy black-brown, viscous, with a thin skein of rich mocha head. Smell was all about chocolates and coffee beans roasting at a coffee house. Lightly boozy. Taste follows the nose with cocoa and French roasted coffee, vanilla, raisins, coconut, dark fruits. Rich, complex and decadent without being sweet. Bourbon notes are ever-present but in the background. Perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness. Velvety mouthfeel and body. Really enjoyed this one and not much more to add except this is a world class beer."
""
""
""
"O: Very little coffee in this guy but its still a very good bourbon-barrel-aged stout, as one would expect from a GI BCBS variant. Looking forward to trying this one more fresh."
"Black pour with a large tan head. Aroma is lots of vanilla, coffee, and toffee. Flavor is up front stale coffee, chocolate, banana, vanilla, molasses, and caramel. Big boozy finish, very rich. The coffee was pretty bad up front but worked well in the finish."

"651mL. Whoa whoa whoa. I used to dislike normal BCS- now I'm a huge convert. Before though, normal BCS was just not for me. But this I loved. Pours a near pitch black with a thin, red mocha head that refuses to stick around and leave any lace. Vanilla bean and coffee ice cream in the nose. Taste is full on creme brulee, kahlua, spicy alcohol. Oily, viscous mouhtfeel. The 13% here doesn’t batter the palate as much as the normal version. Bitter on the palate after some spicy intense coffee liquor. Silky and rich. 6/7/2010 8/4/9/4/17=4.2"

"Brilliant beer. Cannot imagine there are more than 10 beers in the world better than this guy."

"Overall. Just a perfect stout. Perfect amount of bourbon and coffee."

""

"O:	Decedent. This is a very rich beer that is improved by warmer serving temps. It bridges the gap between beer and bourbon nicely, all while incorporating the nice roasty finish of coffee. The alcohol burn is pleasing to this fan of scotch and whiskey. It is a great sipper and great to share. There is no way I could finish an entire bottle of this one by myself. The coffee is a nice touch, but not OVERLY present. Perhaps it is because I engage in coffee tastings regularly, and I was looking for some more assertive flavors, but it is still tasty none the less. This is a very well crafted brew and a real treat to split among friends."
""
""
"O: Very smooth with complex flavours. Do yourself a favour a make sure this aged stout is not served cold in order to experience all the dark fruit flavours that the yeast has to offer."
""
"Overall: Had the opportunity to try this side by side with KBS, and I actually think I'd pick KBS if I had to choose between the two. Both are right on point and have some of the best coffee flavors you'll find in a beer."
""
""
""
"O: This is a monstrous stout. Absolutely huge. Thought it would be bigger on the coffee, regardless, this is one of the best beers I've ever had."
""
"O: This is the bourbon barrel stout to beat at the moment. Great beer to end my long shitty week at work."
""
""

""
""
"O - Another amazing beer from the Bourbon County Series. This beer has all the similar BCBS qualities you get from the series but still stands out on it's own. One of the best beers I've ever had. At 14% this is a great brew to take down by yourself or share with a friend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Oily and boozey palate from start to finish. This is a HOT beer. Not to say that it's not enjoyable to drink. Chocolate, black, espresso coffee with some creamy buttermilk in essence. The alcohol has a hot, lip singe of a finish. But tha reminds me to drink this for a prolonged period of time. Its oily smooth and hot, once the beer gets to room temperature. Nice sipper, glad I got to try this beer."
""
""
"Verdict: This is a magnificent beer and definitely my favorite of the recurring variants. The coffee adds such a nice elements of roast and char to the beer so it doesn't get overly rich and decadent, but has a nice bitterness to it. The alcohol is almost completely hidden at 14% which is almost unheard of. This beer definitely warrants its praises and is a must try for anyone who loves a good stout, bourbon or cup of espresso."

"O- simply amazing beer! I don't think there is any better coffee beer in the world, and if there is ISO."
"D/O: This powerful stout bears a strong resemblance to its un-caffeinated brethren, but is hindered by textural acidity in a way that many imperial stouts are. Coffee is not defining, instead joining other qualities in a nearly seamless collection of barrel-aged sensory experience."
""
"Served sightly below cellar temp, this beer pours a deep black with a loose, dark tan head that leaves a slight, oily lacing. The head falls flat quickly...and remains down for the count. This beer has an incredibly bold nose with intense notes of wood and vanilla followed by a rich toffee sweetness. The alcohol fades in the nose faster than expected allowing for more of the other flavors to come through. I'm reminded of maple syrup and molasses while drinking. The same bold flavors present in the nose get down and dirty in this syrupy malt base. It's definitely a slow sipper, although the coffee acidity on the back end helps balance out the beer's intense sweetness. To be honest, the bold coffee flavors and aromas I was expecting are not present; instead the coffee helps build body and balance. Overall I wouldnt say that this beer is extraordinarily different than BCBS, except it has greater chocolaty smoothness and drinkability. I'm always blown away by how drinkable this beer is, but I woud have preferred more roasted bean aroma and flavor."
""
""
""
""
"O - a very good example of the style."
""
"I find the coffee to be a little too assertive for my preferences, but this is still a fantastic beer."
"Pours pitch black with a medium sized Tan, quickly diminishing head. Smells of chocolate, dark roasted coffee, only a touch of Bourbon and vanilla. Sweet flavor of roasted coffee, bourbon, dark chocolate, vanilla and roasted malt. Full bodied. Syrup/oily texture. Roasted and slightly malt bitter finish. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Same look as before. Smells strongly of coffee, too much for me. Below, when I seek it out, the bourbon and stout characters come through, but it's too much work. Flavor is richly coffee'd and with a solid sweet stout accented with bourbon. Full bodied and fleeting carb similar to the '10. I'm not a big fan of this one, although my drinking buddies dig it quite a bit. 3/2.5/3.5/4/3.5 - 3.33 (this is the grade that is recorded)"
"O: A must-have for the coffee stout lover. The coffee doesn't take over the beer but it's still very strong and tasty. I am not a coffee drinker and I think I'd prefer this with at least a year on it to let it settle down a bit. In fact I do have last year's batch as well which I will have to add to this review at some point. I find that I prefer regular BCS over this. Coffee sort of drowns out the complexity and balance of regular BCS."

"I was able to sample this for the second time this weekend. Pours a thick dark black with a frothy creamy tan head that sticks around for a bit. The aroma is dominated by the coffee but also has some chocolate and a caramel and hints of barrel to round it out quite nicely. The flavor is thick and sweet with a sugary mix of caramel chocolate and coffee. The addition of coffee seems to round out the bourbon and oak of the regular version quite nicely. Thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet creamy sugary mouthfeel. This is a big thick sweet monster of a beer that I thoroughly enjoyed. Too bad these are so hard to get."

"O: (2010 version) Didn't try this one fresh, was a year old when I got to try and review. Some complex flavors going on with chocolate and coffee. Vanilla/Bourbon came through nicely in the finish. Best version I've tried! 4.75/5 overall. In my top 5 favorites!"

"super glad that my buddy who lives south of Chicago was able to get one of these and was willing to share it with my last time I came through town. opened the 22oz bottle and poured it into a snifter glass. The smell is GREAT love BCBS and with the addition of coffee it adds another level to the taste. The beer is like black syrup with little to no head. The smell is of bourbon and espresso orated coffee (huge coffee nose on this one). The taste is outstanding I love what goose island is doing with these beers. They are some of my favorites, it's just a bummer how heard it is to get them."

"EDIT: I much prefer the first two vintages to the 2012 vintage, which has less coffee flavor and is much boozier."
"O: Overall, a simply fantastic beer.  In the top handful of beers I've ever had.  Absolutely world class.  "
"O- Wow, this is really damn good. One of the few beers I've had where are no faults I can find. This is one of the best beers I've had period. Have had this fresh on tap and bottled and the bottle was the clear winner."

"Overall, my goal in the future might be to seek out rare beers, just so I can trade them for more bottles of BCBCS."
"O - Such a ridiculously over the top and amazing beer, so glad I finally cracked into this bad boy. I kinda want to try it fresher now, may need to track down a 2011 version."
""
""
"The smell of coffee was great in the beginning but as I continued to drink it I felt as if it was too much. I did enjoy the bourbon taste. Overall very smooth and tasty if you drink it in moderation. I can image that having it with a desert could help in making it more enjoyable."

"This beer is amazing. It is probably the best beer that I have ever had...EVER!"
"O: amazing stout. This is my favorite stout so far. Just ridiculous in every category."
""
"(D)- This needs some time to age to smooth out its boozy edges. My biggest disappointment actually is where did all the coffee that is supposed to be in this? It is good, but I would not touch this again for another year at least considering how hot this is right now; shows promise for the future. It will take me awhile to finish this on my own.(3)"

"This is my first BCBS and I really need to get my hands on the rest of these beers. Goose Island just jumped up into the ranks of my favorite breweries."

"O - So nice and smooth, but with a bourbon kick to the chest. I need more."
"Overall Impression- While I have enjoyed many (3) of these in bottle form this year, the kegged version was very respectable as well! I highly suggest enjoying on-tap if you get a chance. Not sure the availability of cask/tap offerings of this brew are but try seeking it out."
""
"Pours an opaque black/brown with a dark khaki head that fades to nothing. No lacing on this one. Smell is of dark roasted malt, coffee beans, cocoa, roasted peanuts, and bourbon. Taste is the same with an alcohol kick on the finish with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good barrel aged stout but I think regular BCBS is better."
"similar to regular bourbon county, the coffee didnt really jump out at me, but an amazing beer non the less. amazing complexities. bourbon county really is the king of barrel aged stouts IMO."
""
""
""
"O - Overall a brilliant beer. An improvement over one of my absolute favorites (BCBS), and a beer that simply must be sampled. You need to drink this beer fresh. I had a 1 year old bottle a month ago and it was not even close to this beer. It was still fantastic, but tasted more like standard BCBS, but a but worse because the coffee had a stale character to it. This beer, consumed fresh, is one of my all time favorites and a must-have. I will be searching for it at every future release."
""
""
""
"O-- Tough to drink and enjoy unless have had several beers already. Just a task to drink and overly massive for the sake of being massive. Will avoid the base beer when possible as too sweet for me."
"O: This is an A beer for sure. I am a BCBS fanboy, but this one did life up to the hype. I only wish the coffee was more pronounced on the nose"
""
"Overall, this is just another damn good beer by GI. Despite its name, coffee was rather mild possibly due to the aging as the GI brewers recommend to consume this one fresh. It is a very heavy beer but the drinkability is ridiculously high. Definitely deserves the hype."
""
""
"O: A big beast of a beer that very well deserves it's high regard. Not something I could have very often but this is a beer to rock your socks off once in a while. Not much else I can say about this beer that hasn't already been said. Get you some!"

"O - A very good beer that hits what it is aiming at. Everyone really enjoyed this, but I would put it right up there with the Vanilla. Awesome."

""
""
"For me, personally, I think this beer hits its sweet spot when it's about 5-7 months old (that is, after it has hit the shelves)...just enough time for the coffee to mellow out, but not fade away."

"Pours a dark near black, coating the class with sticky brown liquid, hard pour brings a cap of dense brown froth, gone quickly. Scent kicks off with a cup of dark roasted coffee, more brewed than bean, solid notes of vanilla combine with semi sweet baking chocolate, solid notes of whiskey and bourbon, some oak, coconut and dark fruit to boot, nicely layered scent but needs to be a bit more aggressive. Taste brings an initial hit of vanilla, sugar and cream before the dark roasted coffee and semi-sweet chocolate hit, strong whiskey and bourbon notes almost take over the palate, but beer smooths into a well layered and blended drink with additional notes of dark fruit, oak and coconut. Full bodied, not as dense despite the stickyness of the beer, lingering sweetness and booze. Overall, quite impressed with the well layered and blended notes, quie concerned that drinking so fresh would cause the bourbon to overpower, but that wasnt the case."
""
""
"Wow. This is one of the best stouts I've had. Definitely the best Bourbon County I've had. Simply amazing."
""

"O: An amazing beer. The coffee flavor is fantastic and distinct enough that I can actually appreciate the nuances of the beans. All the flavors meld perfectly. Quite possibly my favorite beer."
""
"I remember having regular 2008 BCS fresh and I was not a big fan. Goose Island must have tweaked and perfected their recipe over the next 3 years, because I recently had a 2011 BCS and now this and they both floored me."

""
"wow. pours black as can be with a barely-there coffee-with-cream colored head that disappears right away. aromas hit the olfactory before i'm even done pouring the first glass. right away, i am reminded of the best, most rich, bourbon laced chocolate cake ever. scents of deep, rich chocolate, batter, chocolate icing, bourbon, vanilla, real coffee, almonds, dark fruit, oak and more waft through the air. intensely complex. in the taste (as well as the nose actually) the flavors of bourbon and coffee are integrated extremely well, coming off as one huge, new, multi-layered taste rather than a hundred things at once. big bourbon, chocolate, vanilla flavors. the coffee seems to fit right in, and the bitterness it provides amplifies just right. full, full body with a hot finish that for once, isn't unpleasantly hot. only down side to this one is that it is so big, it is hard for me to drink more than 6 ounces or so. it is so flavorful, it seems enticing to overindulge, but the heat and richness gets me. one of the best big beers i've ever had. goose island kills it with this one."
"Definitely up there with the best stouts and coffee beers, if not the best going. I felt everything was pretty well integrated, and the coffee, roast, bourbon, vanilla, oakiness, toffee and booze hung together beautifully."
""
""
""
"Glad to have finally tried this elusive personal whale of mine. But I was surprised to find that the coffee wasn't more of an incorporation into the BCBS, but rather, almost like a masking of it. The amount of coffee was way more than I had expected. Kinda wished it didn't overtake the beauty of BCBS. I think some age on this year's bottles would definitely help mellow things out a bit more."
"Pours a thick, viscous black with a slight coffee colored head that quickly fizzles out. Sweet and boozy aroma. Nice bourbon notes, wood, fresh coffee grinds and molasses. Quick roasted, bitter coffee notes to start. Not as prevalent as the name suggests, but present. Really sweet thick molasses flavor and what seems like maple syrup as well from the bourbon barrel. Awesomely smooth flavor and free of any hotness. Great chocolate fudge notes as well. Absolutely huge flavors that work awesomely with each other. A huge, excellent beer. Very thick and creamy mouthfeel."
"O: I had previously had this brew from a bottle and still have a few in the cellar, but the draft is even better. The coffee is a bit too forward for me from the bottle, while on draft it becomes an essential component that complements the other characteristics of this stout. Truly fantastic!"
"O: I love BCBS with a little age on it and this just takes it to a whole 'nother level. This is easily the best coffee stout/beer I've ever had and definitely one of the best beers I've ever consumed. I'm glad I've got one more in my cellar. I can't wait to try the Vanilla and Rare."
"Overall, a nice brew that is not quite worthy of the asking price or demand. You'd be much better off with a couple more regular Bourbon County stouts- more bang for your buck. Especially if you want the bourbon flavor to dominate."
"O - The appearance and mouthfeel are what keeps this one down. The flavor is actually reminiscent of BA DL, but with a lot more coffee. Great beer overall. Somewhere between a 4.0 and 4.5 overall, but I gave a 4.5"
""
""
"O:Every taste is the same, it doesn't fade off. Need more, best beer I’ve ever had. A+"

"My beer buyer set a bottle aside for me and was looking forward to trying this one out as this particular beer has received 100pts World Class rating via BeerAdvocate even though I am not a coffee drinker. Poured from 650ml bottle (bottle label reads that this can be developed over 5 years) into a snifter glass. Pours black with a very thin dark brown head that disappears very quickly. There is almost zero lacing throughout. Nose picks up 100% coffee grind, faint oak, and some bourbon. Flavor consists of strong coffee which would have been a coffee drinker’s paradise and the bourbon is extremely well-hidden. Dangerously drinkable at 14% ABV! Mouthfeel is thin with some boozy back finish towards the end as the beer began to warm up. But, wow did the beer become it’s absolute best and finest when it hit 50-55 degrees!? Very nice brew and probably the only coffee beer I ever gave above a B+ rating!"
""
"O- Even fresh, this stout is the pinnacle of rich coffee taste, sweet cocoa, and just enough bourbon. Infallible. Legendary. Perfect."
"In the end, BCBCS is a very good take on what has become my favorite beer. Is it as good as regular BCBS? No, but it's damn fine in it's own right and certainly a worthy tick."

"O- It amazing Goose Island did not let me down, i loved it and im glad to have another bottle in the cellar"
"Tried a year old KBS immediately after and it felt numb to my palate. Tried one again the next day and it still didn't stand up to what I remembered...either the BCBCS is waaaay more bold or I need to drink KBS fresh all the time- I think probably both are somewhat true, but the latter more so."

""
"It was good just not there best."
""
"Cost: $26 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle at the bar, $15.99 in stores."
""
"O - Lived up to the hype for me. All-around solid coffee stout - huge flavor, a little heavy but of course it's going to be heavy!"
""
""
""
""
"Great beer. I suppose some bourbon would be nice in there but I'm not complaining. Get this while it's fresh!"
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Very good stout but I must say I am a bit disappointed. I was expecting much more coffee flavor. This seems to be much closer to the base beer than the other variations. Definitely had other porters or stouts with more coffee flavor."
""
"O - I remember liking the 2011 version a notch better. Still, this beer is excellent. Light espresso notes then lead into the symphony that is BCBS. Love it!"
"O - Very good beer with the addition of the coffee. I may have been a tad underwhelmed by this because my expectations were so high. A great beer for the barrel aged stout lover. I may have a hard time finishing this bottle myself but will give it a college try!"
""
"D - Great drink; not for the faint of heart, but for those willing to expand their drinking horizons and finish off a meal with a espresso and beer mixed into one delectable drink"
"Wonderful beer and glad they released it again. The coffee serves as the perfect foil for the bourbony sweetness making it well balanced and easy drinking."
""
"O: This stuff is incredible. It's a shame its so rare and only available once a year, but on the other hand maybe its a good thing. After drinking it I could probably go a year before I have it again. It's so decadent and complex I couldn't have it all the time."
""
""
"Poured jet black. Small head that lingered the entire way. Tons of coffee on the nose. Smells fresh. Like it was just brewed now. Such an amazing nose. Taste is coffee heavy, but there's the underlining stout. Bourbon at the finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and full, and amazing. Overall, this blows Vanilla away. Just amazing. The coffee is unlike anything I've ever tasted. So full, so fresh. Amazing stout. The barrel aging does add a complexity, but it's the coffee that makes this beer. Just overwhelming. My wife isn't a stout lover at all, but she's a coffee lover, and she loved this beer. Cannot stress enough how much coffee is in this beer. Very awesome, perfect scores for sure. Good job GI!"

"Buddy of mine got his hands on one of twelve bottles for our region! This beer poured black with no hint of color except for the slight ring of dark brown bubbles that hung for just a few seconds on the edge of the glass. Smell was roast, coffee, dark chocolate, bourbon alcohol burn and sweet roasted malt. Taste is desert for a beer lover bourbon chocolate sweet malt crisp bourbon alcohol finish that just hangs in the mouth. This beer is delicious! Mouthfeel is super smooth very little carbonation and not a super heavy mouthfeel. Overall I would highly recommend this beer to anyone looking for a world class stout!"
""
""
""
""
"Props to GI for crafting yet another world-class beer. Seek this one out; you won't regret it."
""
"Overall: I didn't think they could top BCBS, but they did it. Amazingly good beer and just one step above BCBS in the complexity department. Buy it whenever you see it and share it with someone dear to you. Outstanding!"

"O - This beer was incredible for me. The smell is definitely the best part. It is also incredibly drinkable for the ABV. I love bcbs and this is just adding an awesome complexity."
""
"A world class beer that I lucked into finding. Looking to having the second bottle I found soon before the coffee fades."
"O - A great coffee stout and one that must be drank fresh as the coffee drops off surprisingly fast. The coffee does add a nice wrinkle to the beer and mellows out the bourbon a bit. This is one of those beers that is worth seeking out."
""
""
""
"Pours a jet black with thin tan head. Lacing is pretty minimal for such a big beer. Smell is a great mix of bourbon, coffee, oak and chocolate. Flavor is heavy on the coffee up front, but the bourbon comes on towards the end and combines very nicely with chocolate and oak. It's not nearly as sweet as the regular BCBS. As it warms up the coffee mellows out and blends in with the other flavors better. Mouthfeel is pretty full-bodied and a little bit sticky. Overall, this is a great Bourbon County variant, but I prefer the regular BCBS better. The coffee adds a little bit of acidity to it that disrupts the bourbon/chocolate/oak flavor I love so much."
"O: I preferred regular BCBS to this. The coffee is nicely integrated and definitely takes a back seat, but there isn't enough new or interesting in this for me to sing its praises over regular BCBS. It's a great stout, just a victim of its other siblings."
"O: Worth the hype, but drink it fresh, before the coffee fades. For now, the really intricate aspects of coffee are still prevalent. It'll be fine in five years, but it'll just be BCS then."
""
""
""
""
"O- Really outstanding. I had a very fresh BCBS a while back and it just wasn't ready, or I wasn't. Very different experience with this one. Smooth and sippable. That coffee works wonders as well as this being a bit older."
"This is an incredible example of a coffee marriage of great whiskey barrel accents into a beer. Easily the best coffee stout I have had to date."
""
""
"O-this is borderline perfect. The only bad thing is the abv. It tastes phenomenal but I can only have so much but this beer is ecstacy."
"Wow. What a brew. Being a relative novice in the craft beer scene (1.2 years and counting) I sometimes miss certain elements of the beer or don't consider other factors, such as mouthfeel, to be as important because I lack the perception. Well, after drinking this brew, I can say I now know the feeling of a great mouthfeel. I have had bc vanilla, bc regular 11', king henry and now this. Bourbon county coffee blows them all away. The nose is rich with bourbon sweetness, a little heat and some subtle coffee and vanilla notes. I am not blown away by booze from the nose which invites me to take a sip. Now, solely comparing the three I have tried, this is by far the best. Smooth as silk, coats the mouth like the vanilla did, but with a wonderful complexity and relatively easy drinkability. the taste rapidly changes almost as it warms each degree. I get smooth bourbon, nice subtle blend of coffee and chocolate. it is not cloying, rather smooth and luscious. When I swirl it in my mouth, huge coffee notes are unleashed at a ferocious rate. It is big, undoubtedly, but it is everything I could have ever hoped for in a bourbon county. Smooth, drinkable, great mouthfeel and a whole lot of flavor"
""
"This beer was rich and decadent, sticky and chewy with flavors of coffee, dark chocolate with some booze that I happen to love. I have yet to taste the perfect beer, however this one is damn close."
""
""
"This isn't better than he bourbon country stout, but perfection is hard to replicate."
"Poured dark brown with brown foam. Dissipates quick to a ring, no lacing. The smell is wonderful roasted malt, caramel and coffee. Taste is also great. When still chilled there is more malt with a coffee finish. As it warms the beer sweetens a little and you get more caramel and coffee, vanilla too. Mouthfeel is unusual. Sort of thick but creamy or foamy. More carbonation than I expected. Over all outstanding."
""
"O: Delicious. While I thought the nose wasn't up to what I wanted it at the taste more than made up for what the nose lacked. Wave after wave of flavor is so well layered in this beer, and the steps the taste takes you on are great. Nothing dominated in the flavors, just a very well balanced beer. The ABV is hidden so well it's insane. Chalk up another winner for the GI barrel program."
""
""
"2011 bottle. Pours black with a larger, more fizzy head than the regular Bourbon County Stout. Nose still has that super rich, gooey chocolate brownie found in Rare and the better BCBS batches. Fresh roasted coffee beans, a pleasant and well integrated bourbon character. Mouth is sweet, more bourbon forward than the others I believe, roasted coffee on the finish. Hot on the finish. Too much residual sugar in this, which is weird because I believe this is the same base batch as the amazing '11 BCBS which was super well integrated and not overly sweet at all. Nice, solid barrel aged stout, but not in the same league as the '11 BCBS or Rare."
""
"O: Overall just wow, truly a remarkable beer."
""
"Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, the consistency of heavy cream really. Very low carbonation is right for the style. A beer not for beginners and one (at 14% abv) that you should definitely split with a friend, but another outstanding Bourbon County Stout from Goose Island."
"Very thick mouthfeel and only a small notice of the alcohol for such a high abv. I was stoked to finally land a bottle of this version of the famous Bourbon County series. It does not disappoint."
""
""
"O: Definitely a sipper and even better when it warms up. I would throw this in the Russian Imperial Stout category. A definite try if you can find it."
"Overall: Wow, just fantastic. Easily one of the most complex beers I have ever had. There is so much going on here. The bourbon comes through first and provides a great backing. Next, the coffee notes come through a little more subtle but endure and provide a great aftertaste to compliment the burbon. The consistency is spot on. It's only (minor) drawback is the nose. I really wish it was a bit more pronounced or floral. The nose is complex and is a great teaser to the beer but just not as strong as I would have hoped. I really can't wait to enjoy a couple more bottles of this stuff."
"O-This is an amazing beer, but I enjoy this year's BCBS over it at the moment. I guess they are not kidding when they say ""Ages for up to 5 years."" I am gonna give it some time and see how it develops."
""
"This beer is truly an experience. While I wouldn’t go apeshit over it, I think it’s definitely one of the best brews I’ve had."
"Deuce to oversized tulip. 2011 Release. Looks good; black with no head or lace whatsoever. Smells good; the coffee's there, but the bourbon is still pleasantly noticeable. Taste is very good, but I feel like the coffee and bourbon are fighting each other instead of marrying. That being said, it will probably come with age. Mouthfeel is good, but I'd personally like a bit more carbonation (maybe it's just this bottle). Overall, a great beer that I look forward to shelving my extra of and revisit in two years."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good beer for sure, but if you have the 2010 vintage, drink it now - not a beer to be aged. The coffee has faded (and will continue to do so). However, for being a year and a half old coffee stout, this is still drinking very nice and smooth. The fresh stuff is absolutely amazing though, so start chugging the 2011 stuff too!"
"O- This might be as close to a perfect stout as I've ever tasted. The flavors are incredibly rich and just melt seamlessly into each other. I'm just totally floored, this is easily one of the best beers I've had."
""
""
""
"The appearance is abyssal black and pours super thick, there is absolutely no head on this beer what so ever, but it finds a way to make me forget about that pretty fast because once I smelled it god-damn was that wonderful. The aromatics off of the beer were the obvious notes of coffee and sweet bourbon, but even beyond that there was a candy like sugar smell and rich sweet milk chocolate aroma on the nose. One of my top beer smells ever. The aromatics amplified my enjoyment of the taste as well. The flavors were of a bourbon dark chocolate syrup to the point were I might consider this a dessert beer. The coffee is smooth and dosen't add really any bittering notes to beer what-so-ever. For something with dark chocolate, bourbon and coffee beans that is considered able to age for up to 5 years, this is smooth as heck right now. If it wasn't for the high ABV, I would have no problem drinking this all day long. Overall it was a great beer one of the best I've ever had the good fortune of trying."

"I get it's not the most exciting thing to read in a review initially, but when you think about this style and how much is going on you will soon realize how impressive of a feat that is. The smell is the only thing I scored under 4.5 mostly because I was hoping for a bit of a stronger coffee aroma. I smelled the sweetness of the aged bourbon more than the coffee especially as it warmed. This isn't necessarily a bad thing and still warranted a 4.0 because it smells amazing. When I finally decided it was time to taste this beer I was overwhelmed by what was going on. You get a great coffee note up front. This blends its way into an almost vanilla like bourbon sweetness. The back end is where the barrel really shines and you can taste the bourbon and wood with some lingering coffee taste still peeking though. It's definetly not as strong of a coffee flavor as one might think. Get your hands on a bottle and please drink it fresh! I see far to many year old reviews of this beer where people talk about its lack of coffee... this isn't something to age unless you have had it fresh once and want to see what it turns into."
"O - So happy I was able to try this so fresh. The new coffee choice is even better than last year IMO, and has improved on what was already an amazing beer. They increased the alcohol to 14% this year, and I still get no alcohol burn. I suspect the bourbon flavor hides it, but either way, it is impressive."
"Overall, I don't give out 5s too often but this brew is a perfect candidate for best beer consumed, EVER. Full of amazing flavors that are perfectly balanced between one another and just quality all around. I WANT MORE!!"
""
"Best. Beer. Ever. Without a doubt."

"O: The coffee was all but gone, but it left a smooth, rich, dessert-like stout in its wake. Absolutely delicious. I know there are many who prefer coffee stouts fresh, and this was certainly great as a fresh beer, but I am not disappointed that I aged it at all. Incredible, and one of the best beers of the night."

"Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout pours total black. Nigel Tufnel might say that it could be none more black. Three fingers of mocha foam rise up to crown the beer. Head retention is very good, but lacing is pretty much nonexistent. The nose is absolutely fantastic, I don't think I could ask for anything more. Rich milk chocolate, fresh brewed coffee, and smooth bourbon each jump out of the glass, no aroma dominating, but all of them quite pungent. The flavor doesn't quite live up the expectations set by the out of this world aroma. The milk chocolate aspect of the beer appears at the open, but fades quickly. That leaves the coffee, and a bourbon flavor that has a bit more bite than the nose would have led me to expect. The body is very full, with a perfectly subtle carbonation. The mouthfeel just doesn't have that creamy edge that would have completed the picture though. Almost two years later I'm impressed by how much coffee presence is left in Bourbon County Coffee Stout, and I'm looking forward to the next batch of this excellent bourbon barrel aged stout."

"Overall - I don't think the coffee adds much. It adds a slight dimension. I do think it it's smoother, but it's my understanding that this has had a bit more time in the barrels. A delicious beer, but I think it's still rough around the edges. Tough not to be rough at this level of beer, though."

"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a medium size dark brown foamy head with average retention and some lacing. Aroma of coffee, light vanilla notes from the bourbon and some peppery notes which don’t necessarily fit the style. Taste is mix between some astringent coffee notes with some vanilla and coffee a strange peppery feeling at the end. Body is quite full with nice creamy texture and good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Good though definitely a notch below the other GI stout treatments."

"The beer pours pitch black. The color of used motor oil comes to mind. Light doesn't penetrate at all. A thin coaster of light brown bubbles manifests itself atop the beer, then dissipates leaving a thin ring around the outside of the glass. The nose is coffee and char with some malt sweetness poking through. Taste opens with sweet roasted malt flavors. Coffee and oak follow in copious amounts. Caramel and vanilla, presumably from the barrel, fill out the flavor profile. Finish is dry with a very nice coffee aftertaste. The beer is full bodied. Thick and viscous with a low level of carbonation. This is a great coffee stout. The barrel has imparted a wonderfully complex melange of oak, vanilla, and caramel which compliments the coffee and roasted malt perfectly. Booze is almost undetectable, and at 13% that's saying something. Really enjoyed this one. Recommended."
"Overall: Again just an exceptional beer and I give it a higher score than the base beer because the nose is so much better"
"some of my beertasting friends here in Belgium always love it when I pop up a bottle of those great American Stouts. This is one of them. We enjoyed it with a couple of enthousiast, and came up with about 30 different taste descriptions. The reviewer below me sums it up quite nicely and most important, it's taste profile is unlimited... Amazing beer, and I really dig that thick lucious mouthfeel. Hope to get some more bottles in some trades, cause this one was a knock-out to end the tasting."
"Just a great complex monster of a beer here. Burnt toffee really resonates, sweet milk chocolate, fudge, mocha, mollasses, prune, hints of raisin, caramel, vanilla, coconut, oak, black fruits, fruity botanicals coffee, deep and toasty, bourbon, AMD more. Creamy sweet with creme fresh like flavors. Amazing beer."
"D - Adding black cat coffee to my favorite beer is a recipe for success."
"On tap (2 variations) and bottle too. This ale pours black with dark brown edges. A thin brown head sits for a moment then recedes quickly and leaves little lace. I don't use OMG very often but OMG! My glass smells amazing- bourbon (obviously), coffee, vanilla, dark fruit (fig), raisin, and a fresh bread-like aroma. The taste is equally amazing. The flavors blend well together and the coffee is far from overpowering. Well balanced if not a tiny bit too sweet. Full body and the usual low carbonation found in GIBCBS."
"Overall this is one of those perfect bourbon barrel beers were the barrel and beer support and complement each other. The coffee adds an amazing componet and is integrated rather well. Although I believe it has toned down with age."
"D: I loved this beer.  Despite the ""size"" of the beer, it was pretty darn easy to put down.  The bottle was split four ways, and, although I wish I had some more of it, a fourth of a bottle was really enough to meet optimal satisfaction.  It wasn't work putting it down like some other big stouts, but might had become that if I had consumed any more.  Definitely my favorite of the BCBS lineup that I've tried thus far. "
"M: Very viscious but not as thick as the other BC brews."
"Well played. I will seek this out fresh and actually drink it next time."
"Poured from bottle dated oct 2010 into duvel tulip. Pitch black with creamy thin brown head. Nose is full of dark chocolate, booze, roasted coffee. The taste is pretty hot still, still a good lot of alcohol, coffee is very subtle, and surprising amount of chocolate. Mouthfeel is soft, carb is easy, good since its still hot. Overall, very impressed with it. If the burn went down it would be godly imo."
"Overall: Pretty damn good, wish I could've had this fresh. The BCBVS beat this at our tasting but this got second place. So fantastic."
"O - One of my favorite beers (Top 5). I prefer the regular BCS to this one but it is still awesome."
"Thick and coating, the visual legs on the glass translate to a dominating mouthfeel, nearly chewy in consistency. Big by every measure, this is too much beer for a 22oz bottle (unless you're sharing with a small crowd)."
"Pour is pitch black with small khaki colored head. Looks like coffee in my glass. First smell is of sweet dark chocolate, bourbon, and slight vanilla. Coffee makes itself present at the end and aftertaste..but has faded quite a bit..as expected. Body is medium to thick and still carries just enough carbonation. I had another bottle of this about 6 months ago, and the strong coffee presence went perfectly with the sweet vanilla bourbon flavor. Still a great beer but I would recommend drinking this with about a year of age under it's belt. Fantastic beer, can't wait for the next release."
"D - Wonderful, Would drink it often if I had it. Great to share with friends."
"O: I love this one. I think I still prefer the regular BCS or Rare, but I will still seek this one out when it gets released again. It will be interesting to see how a different coffee affects the taste."
"This was a real treat and the group was impressed by this wonderfull stout."
"O - Very good but the alcohol over powers the coffee very easily."
"Pours black with a very small tannish head. The nose is huge dark coffee thrown atop BCBS (bringing bourbon, booze, chocolate, molasses, roast). Wow, this smells great. The taste is fantastic. Again, it is substantial dark coffee flavor integrated perfectly into the base beer and elevating it. Very dark coffee overlaid on the boozy bourbon helps bring the booziness down a touch, intermingled with chocolate, roasted malts, molasses. Yum. This integrates really well. The mouthfeel is really huge and viscous, with lower carbonation. This is really a fantastic beer. Try to make sure you get it fresh though, as I have had a sample of this not so fresh and the coffee fades."
"2010 Bottle - Opened by inflatablehair, thanks!!! - Pours a dk dk brown, thick, with a small tan ring of head...aroma is massive cocoa, espresso, vanilla creme and barrel...flavour is pretty well integrated, it’s a mouthful of brute force, but tastes pretty darn good...very hot, mocha and vanilla, astringent coffe, bitter burnt wood, massive barrel...quite bitter and hot, but finishes creamy...wasn’t sure what to expect from this one given the fanfare, don’t go looking for nuance..."
"A gusher, head shot up out of the bottle right after openeing, strange. Poured with a huge head, nicely carbonated. Deep black color with a fine hazelnut mousse. Very sexy brew. Smells were faint, mostly chocolate and hints of bourbon on the nose, very subdued. Flavor was decadent, rich roast and chocolate, very creamy and rich. Melts on the tongue, very nice coating of the palate, very delectble brew. Coffee notes were very subtle, I wouldnt have known it was a coffee beer had it not been for the label. The bourbon has really integrated well with this beer, lush silky mouthfeel with minimal heat. Awesome beer, always a pleasure. More coffee please?"
"Okay, I love the texture of this beer. It's velvety, almost glassy if you want to think about it like the aforementioned Oil Ocean. It's rich, viscous...I'm reminded of the syrup chugging scene from Super Troopers. Unfortunately, no big, brown, beautiful lips here, so I'm left to just sip this one, which I'm perfectly happy with, because it is definitely a sipper. The 13% ABV, while not nearly as harsh as a year ago, is still very present. I'm definitely feeling a little warmth as I drink it. A great way to spend a couple of hours. Wonderful brew."
"Bottle thanks to pantanap. Black pour with foamy brown head. Aroma of vanilla, scotch/bourbon, molasses, sea salt, some coffee notes but they are very tame. I thought the aroma were closer to a nice scotch from the Islay than a bourbon. Taste is sweet, molasses, some anise, a bit of coffee - to me it tastes as though the coffee bitterness just takes the edge off the bourbon sweetness BCS usually has. Palate is rich and smooth, nice alcohol warmth. Excellent."
"Had this alongside a similar sampling of BCVBS. Pours very dark with almost no head. Aroma is amazing, good hints of coffee and bourbon. Taste is great, amazing how much coffee there is in the front end. The bitterness mixes well with the bourbon notes on the back end. It feels very smooth on the mouth compared to regular BCS but is still a little hot due to the ABV. Loved this! What a treat to get to try it during St. Louis Craft Beer Week"
"O - Damn this is still one of my all time favorite coffee stouts. The combination of rich coffee and warm bourbon is just so damn good together. I am glad I still have a bottle of this one in the cellar."
"O - Excellent beer. I will be seeking this one out again very soon."
"6/26/10. Bomber shared by degarth at the Tally Tasting 2010, meaning I got to save my bottle, bwa ha ha. Honestly, the aroma is basically a toned down BCS... BA characteristics with some nice roast and chocolate going on. The flavor however, has an amazing coffee finish. Love it!"
"It pours a thick black, with a good half inch creamy mocha head, however this fades quickly to leave a slight ring. It looks pretty well carbonated and lively, with a constant stream of fine bubbles. The first thing that hit me was the bourbon, the smell is strong boozy bourbon with lots of woody vanilla. I got a bit of that roasted coffee bean smell but it is much more subtle than I was expecting. The first taste was a bitter dark chocolate, with the same heavily booze bourbon that was on the nose. Towards the end the coffee begins to assert itself with a fairly mellow medium bitter taste. There is definitely some vanilla sweetness in there and a slight toffee flavour. It produces a nice warming whisky-like alcohol finish, which I find the best part of all the Bourbon County Brand Stouts."
"Bottle. Halloween black cat pour with a small tan head. Big boozy aromas. This kitten has a bite. Chewy and rich with expresso, bourbon, vanilla, and dark roasted malts dominating the palate. Between this, BCS, BCVS, and BCRS Goose Island is keeping my cellar full..."
"D - very drinkable. Perfect all around. This has to be my favorite stout."
"Highly recommend this brew."
"I would like to try this fresh. Regardless, it's enjoyable."
"EDIT: Had to increase the score a bit because the 2013 vintage is just so freaking delicious. One of the best coffee stouts ever. Much more prominent coffee profile than I remember."
"O: Fantastic."
"If I had access to this beer all of the time it would be one of my favorites to drink over and over. The alcohol is very well hidden and the beer is exceptionally smooth. It definitely lives up to the hype!"
"rving type: bottle"
"I would say this beer is one of the finest stouts I've tried. Worthy of all praises it has received, I recommend this beer with highest enthusiasm."
"O-Good stuff, but a little goes a long way."
"Taste was quite nice. Bitter dark chocolate up front, followed by sweet malty chewy coffee with hints of vanilla. The alcohol was very warming but well integrated, and the bourbon flavor was subtle and balanced. The mouthfeel was thick and rich, creamy with low to medium carbonation. After finishing a drink it really coats your mouth with a wonderful residual deliciousness. Overall, a pretty outstanding beer that I wish I could have tried much fresher."
"O: Its fantastic for what it is but I am not a coffee stout fan."
"Overall: I would rate this one very highly, the only issue I had with it was how boozy it still was even after a year. I also think the bourbon over powered some of the other flavors a little."
"I know aging will kill off some of the coffee, but I'd love to see how it blends compared to the BCS non-coffee version. Hopefully I will get my hands on a bottle next fall."
"First off my favorite beer I have had to date. Everything a big stout should be. And one huge thing I love in a stout is big coffee presence, this beer has it. Pitch Black with a great tan slight slight head. Coffee, few dark fruits, coffee, coffee, some vanilla, and little bit of booze smell. Tastes of Sweet coffee up front, followed by the little hint of fruitiness, and finishes with a sort of vanilla booze. Goes down pretty darn good for its 13 percent abv. Definitely recommend sharing this gem with a friend as it can creep up on ya. If you get the chance get this beer is well worth it. Got one more that I'm aging for a special special occasion."
"EDIT - Shared a bottle of the second batch last night. The nose was incredible. Bumped up scores to reflect this."
"O - This drinks deceivingly well for a 13% bomb. Overall this is a real bourbon and coffee gem. Let this baby warm and you'll reap the rewards tenfold. Yummm"
"O- Great beer! Coffee is fading but it is still a great beer!"
"Drink- Its still a pretty tasty stout but some flavors just left me a bit put off with the fade. Glad I got to try it though. Wouldnt mind a fresh bottle at next release."
"Overall: I didn't particularly enjoy this one, rare is great and vanilla is decent. This one fell flat."
"This ale pours black with dark brown edges. A thin brown head sits for a moment then recedes quickly and leaves little lace. I don't use OMG very often but OMG! My glass smells amazing- bourbon (obviously), coffee, vanilla, dark fruit (fig), raisin, and a fresh bread-like aroma. The taste is equally amazing. The flavors blend well together and the coffee is far from overpowering. Well balanced if not a tiny bit too sweet. Full body and the usual low carbonation found in GIBCBS. I didn't think the original could be improved but this beer was quite noteworthy. I want more!"
"O- Even though the coffee notes have died down, giving this time to have the overwhelming bourbon tones of the base BCS blend together made this beer infinitely more appealing to me. I still have a Vanilla and Rare sitting in my cellar, so I'm excited to compare those to this. A superbly well made brew."
"O-good beer but the other variations are better"
"I was never a big fan of coffee stouts, but BCBVS really stirred things up quite a bit. It pours a dark chocolate black, with a small head that quickly dissipates. It smells of coffee(intelligentsia black cat, one of my favorite coffee beans), vanilla, bourbon, and slight oak. Tastes like a regular BCS, with the exception of a faint coffee wave in the back of your palate. Also get to taste the vanilla and the boozy bourbon/oak. When drinking, BCBCS leaves a sheath of oily bourbony coffee-y(now i'm coining that!) goodness in your mouth. Very easy to drink, not too hot at all, for the big beer that it is. Excellent stuff!"
"Taste is smoother than I would expect of a fresh BCS. The coffee is more noticeable and grows on the aftertaste. Tons of vanilla pops out as it warms; and the bourbon is plenty big with mad woody undertones. Very cool beer, but a bit of a paradox for me as far as aging is concerned...less coffee but smoother brew? Either way I suppose you cant lose with this tasty beverage."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Between medium and full bodied with fine carbonation, and is pretty creamy overall. Overall, the flavor is the highlight of the beer for me without a doubt. The coffee is a nice addition to the base BCS."
"Had during a recent Goose Island Bourbon County Tasting in Charlotte with marine1975, boodingo, CarolinaKevin, HopDiggityDawg, and GehenHerzog at Mike Brawley's house with Budweiser sign blazing! Big thanks to cpetrone84 for sending me this one in a LONG past trade! Served from bottle into a Southern Tier tulip. Poured pitch black with a one finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and coffee. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, and toffee. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty tasty brew. As hinted by others some of the coffee aspect has definitely faded on this one sitting in my cellar, however, with me not drinking coffee at all it is still definitely present for myself. I really liked the toffee aspect I got on this one to add a little sweetness to the roastiness you get with the dark chocolate and coffee present. Really glad I got to pull this one out of the cellar for the tasting I was planning on doing myself someday, but getting to share it with some awesome BAs at the same time. This one is definitely worth picking up still, but I would do it in a hurry if you are concerned about the coffee fading."
"(22oz bottle courtesy of jcnd9803!). Pours near black with tan head. Aroma has major dark roasted coffee along with some sweet bourbon notes. Taste follows suit with coffee and bourbon. Full bodied beer with an oily/sticky texture. Finish is dry. This is a really nice beer and has if you like coffee this one will not disappoint!"
"Overall - great, great beer. Top notch."
"O - This beer is overwhelming good and drinkable. I was a little worried about losing some of the coffee as it is almost a year old. I think the little time in the cellar helped to mellow the bourbon and coffee a bit and allow the background flavours to come out. Absolutely awesome beer."
"Pours pitch black, tan head with minimal retention. Leaves a collar of head. No lacing, but has legs for days. Nose is bourbon, dark chocolate, oak, a hint of vanilla but not a significant amount of coffee. I suspect it has faded, over a year since it's bottling. Taste has some warming bourbon, oak, vanilla, more oak and more friggin bourbon. Finishes dry and roasty, and the chocolate and espresso notes don't really come through until late in the finishes. Layers upon layers of flavour and complexity here, just unreal. More keeps coming through well after the sip is over. Alcohol is mellowed and the body is so full. Low carbonation, minimal alcohol burn and aids in its drinkability. A real sipper, but drinks like a charm. Extremely impressive, and I'd be very curious to try this fresh with more 'coffee.' This set a new bourbon barrel standard for me."
"Overall the beer is still great, but I prefer Rare for sure and even kind of like regular BCS more, especially at this point the 08' vintage."
"Overall this beer was all it was cracked up to be, although I have to believe the coffee has faded. The smoothness associated with it remains however, and it hasn’t turned bitter as happens sometimes with older coffee beers. I’d recommend drinking yours now as I can’t imagine them getting any better, but be assured you’ll still enjoy them even this late in the game."
"D - For 13 % abv, this drinks really nicely. It is really flavorful, but at the same time pretty well balanced. The coffee flavor is an excellent addition."
"Overall I'm thrilled I have a few more in the cellar for sure."
"O) Without a doubt one of the better beers I've had. I think the one year on this worked very well. But still I wonder what this was like fresh!"
"Pours an oily/slick black with a thin tan head that persists throughout. Very dense/thick beer. Nose is mostly bourbon and burnt espresso. Flavor is what I expected. Dark chocolate covered espresso beans, vanilla, roasted malts, caramel/brown sugar. Very sweet (but not cloyingly) and rich. I would drink this over other bourbon/coffee stouts any day of the week, if it came in a 12 oz. bottle. Glad that this was split 4 ways."
"O: Overall, the best of the Bourbon County series that I've had (better than regular or vanilla versions). The coffee is unfortunately undetectable and I probably would not have even picked up on it at all had I not expected to find it somewhere. Really the only way I can tell that this beer has coffee in it is the fact that it's not quite as sweet as its non-coffee counterparts. I know the coffee may have faded some, but I've had other bbal coffee stouts with a year of age and could still detect the coffee. The bourbon again dominates the flavor and the nose like it does in the other Bourbon County series. Not a bad beer, but I would need much more balance in it to call it good."
"Overall this is one of the best beers I've ever tasted (out of near 400 different beers). It is both strong and flavorful and an excellent representation of an imperial stout. I would highly recommend this to anyone who can find it. I'm under the impression it's release was limited and that the beer was very hard to find. I grabbed two bottles for aging and will try them again in another year or two"
"Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout is full of amazing complexities. Each sniff and sip offered something entirely new. If you have any 2010 bottles in your cellar, I would recommend drinking them as soon as possible. I simply cannot imagine this getting any better. All in all, one of the greatest beers I have ever tried."
"O: A great beer; this one goes down very easily despite the high ABV, thickness, and richness in flavor. I could definitely have a whole bomber of this by myself- hoping that Goose Island brews this again soon, so I can try it fresh, maybe the coffee will be even better then."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, thick, viscous and syrupy. Perfect for the style and helped by the warmth the booze provides. Drinkability is awesome as well, especially considering the 13% abv - it's only evident taste-wise and never by heat or in any unpleasant manner. A burn present at the back of the throat at the end of sips kind of goes against the silkyu mouthfeel and drinkability, but its fantastic nonetheless. Can't wait to have the other varieties of BCBSs."
"D - This reminds me more of the Rare Bourbon County Stout than the normal versions as it hides its alcohol so well. I would never guess that this was a 13% beer. Incredibly bold and flavorful, and the coffee does so many good things for this beer."
"O: I like the Vanilla Stout better than this one, but it is still better than regular '09 Bourbon County Stout, and especially the '07. Neither are on the level of Bourbon County Rare, however."
"D: this is very drinkable, especially for the ABV. I could drink a lot of this."
"This is now one of my favorite imperial stouts."
"D - Best Coffee stout ever? It's hard not to say yes."
"Cheers!"
"D - Yum! This beer is so delicious. I wish it was a year round offering or at least a seasonal. This is better than their regular BCBS. The ABV is deliciously and dangerously hidden."
"D - Blows my mind that it's 13 percent. So smooth and no alcohol burn. An amazing balance between the coffee, bourbon, and malt."
"Drinkability is awesome. I want Goose to brew this every day and have it as a regular. This beer lands in my top 3 stouts. If you have a chance to trade or try this jump on it now! I will be looking for this beer in the future."
"Honestly, I haven't been very impressed with any of the BCB series, too much alcohol and not enough flavor to mask it. This may be better with a few years on it, but by then the coffee will have dropped out."
"Overall, a bit hot at the time of tasting, but still very flavorful. This should age pretty well, though the coffee is likely to fade."
"As if regular Bourbon county wasn't good enough. This is just amazing. The coffee they use is my favorite espresso blend in the Midwest so it was delightful to try this at the map room last August. This pours a super dark black with jet engine gasoline mocha foam. Aromas are all fresh espresso, booze, oak, chocolate, dark malts and slight green hops buried way in the back. Taste is more of the same with a coating mouth feel and really fresh coffee, booze, and vanilla flavor. Drink ability is great but not a perfect 5 as I couldn't drink this one all night. It's just too intense. LOVE this stuff!"
"Overall: The most impressive part of this beer is the balance between bourbon & coffee; also the fact that it was not a coffee bomb. The best coffee stout I have ever drank hands down; this is an epic beer! I am on the fence about which beer i like better between BCBS Rare or BCBS Coffee. Goose Island has stole the show when it comes to making amazing bourbon barrel aged stouts."
"D: For a 13% ABV beer this has very high drinkability, and overall is probably my favorite coffee beer. I look forward to trying the 2011 version when it comes out."
"Up for review is a 22oz bottle of Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout. Poured into a snifter at room temp. Always been a fan of the regular BCS, lets see how this goes. Great poor, excellent head. The coffee really adds to this beer and mellows out the whiskey a bit. Body a bit thin in the finish."
"An excellent beer with hints of coffee-bourbon on the nose. A dark beer, with a medium coffee colored head. Hints of bourbon on the taste buds with a strong coffee flavor but no bitterness. Very smooth with a slight sweetness. One of my top ten beers."
"Drinkability: This one is very well balanced. The bourbon dominates, but the other flavors come out well. Love it!"
"had a 22oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Color was a dark deep black with small brown/tannish head that quickly dissappeared. first smell was of sweet bourbon, given some time to rest had notes of roasted expresso some licorice and toasty malt. Taste was that of a nice bourbon with underpinnings of coffee, chocolate and malt. mouthfeel was mildly thick with the feeling of drinking your coffee with a bit of spirits. Overall, it was a nice sipping stout, one that I definitely enjoyed and will gladly drink again."
"Man...this is a tasty beer...especially if you are a bourbon fan. I poured a taste for a few non-BAs and their face told me all I needed to know...this isn't for everyone. I had no problem finishing the bottle however!"
"Update 1/26/13 - Each vintage of this beer continues to remain stellar in nearly every attribute. Bumping up the overall score as this is one of the best barrel-aged stouts I've ever had, even after sampling tons of other beers since this original review was posted."
"D: Ehhh amazing drinkability! I could drink this all night and ask for more the next day. I honestly dont think I could get tired of this one"
"Needs some more time to mellow, but an excellent beer all around."
" Still, between Nightstalker, BCS, BCBVS and itself, it was the least favorite at the tasting."
"Drinkability - THis is a sipper but after you finsh it you want more, I couldnt drink this fast but if I could I would drink 2-3 bottles."
"D: was a slow sipper for me becuase of the up front burbon i was still getting from it but cant wait to try one again when it is a little older becuase i think it is going to be unreal."
"Pours a very very dark, thick viscous motor oil like black color with a small, almost non existent tan head. There is a very evident alcohol residue coming down the sides of the glass after swirling. The aroma is big bold vanilla and mocha aromas. some bitter espresso notes and some bourbon, but much more subdued bourbon than the regular bcbs. This really seems balanced and i can pick up the coffee easily. Great caramel or toffee sweetness on the aromas too. The taste is simply balanced. Really nice coffee integrated into the deep malty and chocolate body. Great bourbon integration and not a smack over the face with the bourbon this time around. Great dry finish on this, though it does have some serious booze coming through on the back end. Not perfect, but near perfection on this bourbon barrel aged stout. Mouthfeel is great to. It has a nice level of carbonation that really works well with this brew as its low carbonated. This is a definite sipper, though it is something that would be better shared than drank on its own, its still easy to put back. Worth seeking out for sure."
"Drinkability: A good, make that very good, barrel-aged stout but to my palate, this beer has been over-hyped; perhaps it had more coffee character when first released but that has faded now; I love Intelligentsia's Black Cat roast and am disappointed that it has become lost in the shuffle with this beer"
"Anyways, in summation, lots more vanilla, espresso and cream than expected, less coffee flavor. All melded together to be a decadent beer, regardless of my expectations."
"D: This beer is definitely one that needs to be sipped given its strength; the intensity of the aromas and flavors will definitely wake you up. The addition of the coffee flavors makes the beer slightly more drinkable than Bourbon County Brand Stout."
"only second to the rare"
"D: Just as tasty as the regular BCBS, with the added dimension of coffee coming through nicely in the finish."
"Overall I need to get my hands on some more of this. It's an awesome beer. The appearance needs some work for sure but the taste is so awesome you kind of forget about it. Get some if you can."
"Great beer. Coffee character is not strong. I'm told it was stronger when it was fresher. But the bottom line is that this is an amazing beer, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to try it."
"Overall a simply fantastic beer worth trying."
"Drinkability- a bit too bitter to be that drinkable but very nice for the alcohol percentage"
"Very slow sipping but still delicious. Smooth and like a dessert in a bottle. I wish I had a case or two of this."
"Overall drinkability is mid level due to overly boozy qualities."
"Pours a deep black with thin bubbly tan head. Nose is coffee and bourbon, hints of vanilla, chocolate. Sip reveals a smooth complex beer; taste is of bourbon and roasted coffee. Hardly bitter, warming sensation on the palate in the finish. Heavy mouthfeel, creamy. Certainly a sipper and being a pint, respect and enjoy, take the time to drink."
"do your self a favor, if you find this guy definitely pick one up, its worth a try. if you cant find it definitely arrange a trade, i know im glad i did. (lets hope the rest of 2011 continues!)"
"Or at least until I'm dancing to ""Walk Like An Egyptian"" again."
"Very good, and definitely worth trying, but I'd honestly prefer a regular BCS."
"The 13% ABV is a bit more noticeable and hot than I found in the regular BCBS. Though as it warms, it really becomes more balanced and enjoyable."
"dirty dirts!"
"D - pretty good i drank a whole bombe by myself without a problem"
"I've drank many wonderful beers and this has to rank in the top 10 without a doubt. Thanks Jeff(seem to be saying this a lot lately.)"
"Pure silk as this one is sipped. Thick coating of the palate. Warming all the way to the finish. The coffee isn't as pronounced as I would like in flavor, but as I've read, this may have faded over the last 8 months?? Too bad. Still some hints of it, but not as bold. Lots of creamy milk chocolate, huge roasted notes. Some oak and vanilla tannins. The bourbon is also tamed a bit, which is fine by me. The original of this is too boozy for me, but this one comes across more balanced. I really enjoyed this one. Glad I have another to sit on for awhile. Interested to see how this one develops."
"D - Much more carbonated than how it poured, making it very easy to enjoy."
"I shared this bottle with a friend it was a perfect amount."
"edit: just wanted to say I returned to this bottle which I corked several days ago. For some reason the coffee flavor and aroma is much more pronounced now. Real nice."
"[D] A bomber for one would more than suffice for the evening. For a barrel aged Imperial Stout, this is a sipper. But I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Notes: I didn't think this beer could be as good as the original BCBS, but it turns out it is really friggin' awesome. I'm a tough critic on coffee beers, usually finding them acidic or having ""integration"" problems. But this, this right here, is epic. KBS has nothing on this beer!"
"If it weren't for the abv I could drink this all night long. This is a wonderful beer and I am quite happy I've had the opportunity to enjoy it. Excellent!"
"Great to get my paws on a few bottles of this gem.Poured into a nifet jet black with a minimal mocha colored head.A mix of vanilla,dark roast coffee,dark sweet choclate,and molasses,the mixing of the boubon barrel age and coffee are great together.Full oily mouthfeel,it coats and slides down way to easy.Flavors are sweetish upfront with vanilla,dark fruit,and dark chocolate flavors,the heavy roast coffee flavors and oak really balance this beer out alot and make it great.Its a sipper but its one to savor,this is an amazing beer worthy of its high status."
"The mouthfeel is thick and rich. The flavors coat your mouth and seem to never let go. While the coffee does start to balance out this beer it is still a sipper."
"overall - holding up well, but coffee is for sure fading."
"I would say that this is not better or worse than regular BCBS, but different."
"Honestly this one is getting better and better, I don't know where the peak will be but I can't imagine it is too far away. Drink'em if you got 'em."
"D: What a terrific brew, very nice now and (I hope) able to mature over the years. I have a spot picked out in the cellar, no worries. Pretty boozy now, and at 13% I don't expect that to taper off all that much. If you like bourbon AND coffee in your Imperial Stout, seek this one out."
"Drinlability: Somehow the addition of coffee tempered this beer and made it even better. Just a perfect way to end a night. Superb."
"D - This was awesome. I just sat and smelled my glass in a daze until I realized I had to use the rest of my tickets. It was very easy to put down 4oz of this one. I think this test batch is an improvement on the bottled version and I hope this is what they use in 2011."
"Thanks to goodstrongbeer for this one. The pour is jet black, and oily. The head is thin and tan, light lacing. The aroma is wonderful, lots of coffee, vanilla, and of course bourbon. The first couple of sips have lots of rich coffee flavors. Unfotunately the coffee fades, but there is still a ton of oak, vanilla, and bourbon. It has a lingering hot bourbon finish. The body is full, and chewey. The carbonation is light. A great beer, IMO better than the original."
"Pours a pitch black, thick viscous liquid with a small tan ring. Head is very creamy and sits at the edge of the glass for the remainder of the beer. Smell is amazing - fresh roasted coffee, sweet bourbon and vanilla, some dark roasted malt undertones. Taste is earthy fresh coffee, coffee bitterness that balances the sweet vanilla and bourbon flavors that dominate the standard version of this beer. Milk chocolate, a hint of coconut, very light oak, and a touch of alcohol round this one out. Mouthfeel is spot on - thick and chewy, coating but not cloyingly sweet. Light carbonation. Drinkability on this beer is perfect for an imperial stout. The balance of coffee and bourbon makes me want to get as much of this as possible. Sadly, I am sure the coffee freshness wont last. I have always thought KBS was overrated due to its lack of body - this is what it should be. Best beer of the night for me."
"D - I could drink a bomber on my own, easily. The alcohol is still a little present, so give this one a bit more time and it will be liquid gold."
"(37th)"
"Mouth feel is smooth and sexy. Medium-heavy body with average carbonation. An awesome tasting beer, but I regret not trying it when it was fresh to fully appreciate the coffee flavors, which have faded to just about nothing. Still a bit on the hot side...since the coffee is already gone, sitting on this for another few years would only allow the bourbon heat to blend a little better."
"I like it, it's nice, but how did the hype machine go so crazy on this? I guess, I'm great dissenter...ooo, ooo, ooo-ooo..."
"M- Nice heavy body with very little carbonation"
"had this again side by side with the regular, vanilla, and rare BCS, and this one stood out as the best. it had the most head, a more vanilla-ey and softer (less boozy) aroma, and best mouthfeel (more co2) of the bunch."
"Bottle courtesy of hoppymcgee served in my Old Stock snifter. Pours one shade shy of black with no head, just a thin band and some small dollops of lacing dispersed across the surface. Some lacing, but weak legs. Nose reveals booze, molasses and brown sugar - it just smells like a sweet malt bomb. Taste expresses booze, bourbon, vanilla and coffee notes. As the brew warms, the coffee character becomes more suggestive of coffee grounds. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a carbonation that starts out as being just short of lively, but dissipates nicely, resulting in a pleasant, silky mouthfeel. This is a truly exceptional beer. Tasty and quite drinkable with a well-hidden abv. The coffee element really lends itself nicely to this beer and has really piqued my interest about the other variations to the Bourbon County base."
"Says on the bottle that it will continue to develop for 5 years, I'd recommend sticking to that advise because in 5 years it will be much better. I'd say it took me about 4 hours to drink the entire bottle because this beer is such a sipper, probably broke my previous record from Darkness."
"Decent drinkability for this monster stout. Glad to have tried it."
"Got this in an EXTRA BOX thanks to the incredibly generous Translucent. Poured into a tulip. The beer is black, with very thin layer of head that dissipates into thin lacing. This however simply looks rich. Smell that bourbon! The nose is right up front with a big bourbon, hints of caramel and vanilla and a rich aroma of bitter espresso. The smell is very balanced, the bourbon and the coffee have really compliment one another, still not overpowering anything and letting other aromas shine through. The taste follows the smell wonderfully, starts nicely with bourbon and finishes with a nice bitter coffee flavor. Dark malts, caramel, oak and vanilla entwine themselves in the mix. The mouthfeel is heavy and chewy with a silky texture and subtle carbonation. A bit of a sipper, but certainly something I would enjoy again. I think I like this better than the regular version."
"This I a great brew the one snifter was plenty for me but I will say I wanted more. A great stout but I even enjoy the bourbon one Goose Island produces so it wasn't a hard sell for me."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, which leaves some nice oil slicks and some minimal sticky lacing. The nose is malty, with lots of chocolate, toffee, coffee notes, vanilla, bourbon. The taste is awesome, malty, sweet, lot's of dark stuff, nice bourbon note. Full Body, a very complex brew. Very Drinkable, this is an exceptional brew, highly recommended."
"This is a highly delicious, deep and complex beer. Very glad I had the chance to try it."
"This poured a Nice black velvet color with a tan head. Aroma was lots of espresso coffee beans, some light dark chocolate notes, some some bourbon and alcohol notes. Flavor was creamy espresso with some vanilla and dark chocolate mixed in. Mouthfeel was almost like a milk shake, very creamy but not too cloying either. Awesome experience...."
"D: This is a big, bad mofo that I will certainly enjoy tasting again. However, I do think the sweeter flavors of the beer overpower the bitterness a bit too much. I will be quite interested to see how more age affects the taste."
"I would recommend only opening one of these when another person is around."
"Huge roasted malt and bourbon flavors up front. Sweet vanilla and caramel. Rich espresso and coffee flavors. Some chocolate as well. Reminds me a lot of KBS. This is amazing. Sweet vanilla and bourbon up front. Nice oak flavors. Rich espresso and coffee. The caramel and chocolate flavors are more subtle but add a nice layer to this beer. Smooth, warming, and a bit creamy. Pretty full bodied, but not that thick and chewy. Medium amount of carbonation. Ends warm, bourbony, and slightly dry."
"Drinkability... Well, this is about as subjective a category you can get when it comes to judging a beer like this. It's gigantic, ridiculously rich, has tons of bourbon flavor, high in alcohol, and you can taste the alcohol. In that regard, it can be somewhat of a challenge to drink quickly, but then that's not the point. The point is to enjoy this beer slowly over the course of an hour or two, lingering and appreciating every sip. In that regard, it makes perfect sense and has very good drinkability. Although, I would suggest finding a special friend when you crack yours. I have a feeling I am going to be quite inebriated by the time this bottle is empty."
"Overall, cool to have tried this a half year later to the day, and am excited to see how this beer develops (for 5 years in the bottle according to GI)."
"Pours a thick black with light brown, small head. Scent is very sweet chocolate and candy molasses. Also hints of bourbon, but not as much as regular BCBS. Bit of coffee as well too. Not as much as expected though. Taste is chocolate and sweet boubon followed by coffee. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel is nice and thick with good drinkability."
"As the beer warms the nose livens up, gets boozier, hotter... rawer... more complex even (is that possible?). As does the palate... rich, raw but so damn fun to drink. This beer is great right now but it can only get better with age. Stored properly I am betting this beer has 5 or 7 years easy of maturity before it peaks. There were high expectations about this beer and they were met in spades. Goose Island tinkered with BC Stout and lived to tell about it. This beer is an absolute must try. Get a friend because it is 22 ounces of one BIG beer. Highly recommended."
"It had a lot less soy sauce than BCS, was a little less cloying and definitely not HOT at all. Very smooth for its weight."
"Pours black with a small head and some lace. The aroma couldn't be more striking, it's like the aroma you get when you walk into a coffee shop and they're roasting, the coffee is that fresh and vibrant. There is some dark chocolate and a mild sweet maltiness shows through as well, but this is really all about the coffee. The flavor is roasty and has a fair bit of dark chocolate, some maple syrup, some bourbon, and tons of coffee fruity earthy coffee, the booze is there but it's fairly well concealed. This is pretty damned remarkable, and considerably better than I thought it would be."
"OVERALL: A nice variant of the Bourbon County Brand Stout. The coffee flavors mesh well with the regular base brew without dominating or overpowering in any way. Like the regular version, a heavier palate would perhaps help push things over the top, but that is a small critique on what is otherwise a fantastic beer. One worth checking out if you get the chance. Thanks again guys for sending me some of this brew!"
"D: hands down one of the best"
"Drinkability: I defy you not to like this beer."
"Ah so delicious, def one of my fav beers now. Just wish I could have gotten more of it. I'll sit on my last bottle for a while now to let it develop for ""up to 5 years"" as the bottle even states. I'll also be enjoying this one all night, even after it takes me an hour to drink myself (not because of poor drinkability but because I'm just enjoying it too much and want to savor it), but also because it'll be attached to my tongue all night."
"Drinkability: This beer is still drinking remarkably hot, and I'd tend to believe the label that it could develop well over the next 5 years. The coffee has faded somewhat, as others have noted, but it's still very prevalent, and it still helps make this beer of the most solid offerings from GI. All in all, I love the way this beer rolls off my tongue, and I'm excited I have several more bottles aging in the cellar. Can't wait to crack them open over the next few years!"
"Thanks to Paul and Josh for sharing! Bottle pours black with tan head. Aroma is coconut, vanilla, booze, and some booze. Medium mouthfeel. Flavor was chocolate, booze, vanilla, booze, coffee, dark roast, and more booze. I am a big fan of some of the booze bombs, not all. This was a great one. Thanks Paul!"
"One of my favorite beers I have ever had!"
"Cheers..."
"This beer in one word: Consummate."
"Overall, this brew is almost the perfect stout. I may have rated it the same as KBS, but I still hold KBS as my personal favorite. Thanks Augustiner719"
"D: This is one huge beer that tried to entice me to continue sipping. At 13%, how could anyone say that this beer had a perfect drinkability factor..."
"D: this one is was made to savor. one bomber and a relaxing night."
"The mouthfeel is thick and silky smooth. Carbonation is moderate to low. Drinkability is very good, it has such a great mix of flavors to it. As good as the regular Bourbon County is this one is better. The bitter coffee really helps balance out all the sweetness in it. Fantastic beer overall and one of, if not the best barrel aged stouts I've had."
"Overall, it still maintains its bourbon qualities. So much, in fact, that it doesn't seem all that different from the standard (non-caffinated) version. I was really hoping that the BCBCS would showcase the coffee in a more pronounced way. In that sense, it's a little disappointing but overall still a fantastic beer."
"D: One hit from the sledgehammer was enough for me."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, pretty chewy, with low carbonation, warmth going down. Pretty nice stuff, coffee lends a neat character to an already fantastic beer, but I may prefer the original more. Thanks Scotty!"
"A bomber by oneself can become somewhat of a chore, despite the wonderful interplay of flavors. After time, the sweetness of the coffee pushes to the forefront, making a big time sipper."
"D: The beer is not very drinkable due to the oak monster and the overwhelming bourbon flavor as it warms. Overall glad I tried the beer but it needs more time to age. Its hot so if you have one age that shit. big thanks to TK5150 sharing this one with me"
"This is a sipper for sure, and hard not to compare to KBS. Overall KBS is definitely a superior brew, but this is a pretty tasty bourbon aged coffee stout that I would never turn down the chance to drink."
"D: The ABV is well hidden and the finish is long, pleasant and invites another sip. Awesome beer."
" D- This beer has great depth with big bourbon on top of a big stout that is all mellowed and unified by the espresso. The more I sip the more layers of flavor come through."
"While a bomber is certainly more than enough, this is one I would go back to if not for the price. It was easy to enjoy and the booze was held in check. Very good beer and worth a look."
"I have to say, this is probably my new favorite imperial stout. I will now be seeking out more bottles, as I would like to see how it ages over the next year or two. I know some people were claiming the coffee is dying off fast. I find this to be a very false statement. The coffee level right now is perfect and still quite strong. I feel that this should still improve over the next couple years. Once some of the heat dies down, this beer will be perfect. I feel like this is the only hyped up imperial stout that truly deserves all the attention it gets."
"Overall, a great beer that just misses being one of my favorites."
"I think they use the Intellgentsia coffee company in Chicago, the same as Darklord?"
"D- Jesus Christ on a cracker. Absolutely stunning. It may be rich, but the alcohol is mildly noticeable and the carbonation keeps it right light enough on the palate. I am curious but skeptical as to what more time would do to this beer. My mind is blown. KBS has a rival."
"Overall this beer is one of the best, if not the best Imperial Stout I have ever had. I would give it a slight edge over KBS, but just barely."
"To date, this has to be one of the best brews I've had. Hands-down. Can't wait to see what comes next in the BCS series..."
"D - This beer is still a very good tasting libation overall, it just falls short when viewed against the original. Perhaps it will age well, though I am not sure the pungency of the coffee will survive an extended cellaring."
"D: Goose Island took an already impressive beer and made it even better. Liked this a little more on tap - the coffee and bourbon came out a little more - but this is still a fantastic beer. Slow sipper and 22oz was ultimately a little too much in a sitting. I can only hope this is brewed again"
"D: At 13%, I need a nap after finishing off the bomber. Despite the strength (and the punishment that would come in the morning), I'd gladly sip my way through another bomber if I had one."
"drinkable - at 13%, i think i'll stick with the single bomber... but i'm not sharing."
"Overall this is an excellent beer. But in my eyes, it is a beer to be searved as a nightcap, or as a dessert after a nice meal. This is a beer that demandds your attention."
"*From notes taken on 6/28/10 special thanks to Chris from the blue dog"
"Pours ink black with a very thin tan head that seems to just float on top. Smells are booze, bourbon, coffee and sweet roasted malts. Tastes are caramel malts, coffee in the middle with a nice heavy boozy finish. I am so glad we split this, I'm not sure how long it would take me to drink an entire bomber of this. Very, very good."
"All in all a fantastic beer. I didn't think it could get better than KBS the first time I had one, but it did. This is hands down the best coffee stout I have had."
"D: Very good stout IMO. This is a great sipper! If you are a fan of coffe and bourbon you should seel this beer out."
"I wasn't sure about this beer beforehand because I haven't enjoyed the last few vintages of the original BCS, but this is really good stuff -- one of the best imperial stouts I've had this year, right there with Beer Geek Brunch Weasel and just behind Parabola."
"D - Had no problem putting down this bottle. Not a lot of heat from a 13% beer. I only wish that I had it fresh, because I did not get alot of coffee out of this one. Reminded me of a slightly sweeter version of BCS. IMO."
"drinkability is great. great balance. great barrel character. nice balance with the barrel and the alcohol. great integration of the coffee. a damn fine brew. now if only it wasn't so damn hard to find!"
"Light carbonation, full mouthfeel - this is one of those ultimate dessert beers that you enjoy immensely in small quantities but if you try and drink too much it will only make you sick of it. Much like its little brother, it probably needs some time to mellow out a bit."
"I truly appreciated this one timmi!"
"Reviewed from my notes. Split with BlessedBeBeer. The BCBCS is a dark brown beer. It has a great brown foam head; very thick and pretty. There are a lot of scents in the aroma. I can detect sweet malt, dark chocolate and bourbon. It also has a very complex flavor. I can taste two kinds of chocolate, milk and dark. Ther eis also a lot of bourbon. The alcohol provides a very sharp finish. This is a full-bodied, creamy beer. It has medium/high levels of carbonation. There is a hot alcohol burn when you swallow, but it's pleasant. Personally, I like that trait in a good bourbon barrel aged stout. For what this is, it is pretty drinkable. Some age on a bottle would temper the heat from the alcohol and would probably improve this already great beer. Consuming the entire 22oz bottle would not be difficult, but I wouldn't want any more than that in a sitting. Still, this is a great one to share. Try it if you can."
"D - This is a damn fine stout thats very enjoyable and very easy to drink despite the abv this is worth hunting down to try"
"Honestly, I wish it were just the 2008 BCS. I'm not personally a coffee drinker, and I had a bottle of the 2008 a few days before trying this and it was exquisite. The best part of that beer was the wonderful vanilla bourbon notes. Here the coffee covered that up somewhat, which is a shame. Still, this is excellent, whether you like coffee or not."
"O - Amazing beer. I love this, need to get more to age. Its hard to not inhale whats in front of me."
"Man this one is excellent. The bourbon was a little off putting at first but really grew on me about half way through!"
"Drinks: like second-best. As bourbon-aged coffee stouts go, I'd still rank KBS above this guy, but this beer's still pretty damn solid, with a great blend of flavors. It's definitely Bourbon County Stout, but with an added interest and complexity."
"D: Ok"
"Drinkability - I don't think I could ever drink a bomber of this by myself (nor could I of regular BCS). I will try this side by side this Christmas with a 2008 BCS (since the coffee version was aged longer it would be more similar to the 2008 than 2009 BCS imo) to see just how different they are. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and at such a high ABV, it invites one to share it with good friends and family. I am glad I have eight more in my cellar to age over the years to come. A very good beer."
"O - Like I said before, I'd like to have this in the morning in place of my coffee everyday, if I could somehow. This is an incredible beer, maybe in the top three that I've ever had."
"On a side note, this makes a great beer for a beer float. I had it with the chocolate rain ice cream @ The Bruery a couple weekends back."
"A: Thin layer of brown tightly packed head, the beer moves in the glass like a warmed maple syrup, serious legs are visible in the beer, black with only a tidbit of light passing at the edge of the glass - 4.75, S: Intense nose, tons of thick molasses and latte-like sweetness, the nose oozes a pureed raisin smell, coffee is thick and with a milk mix, alcohol provides a slight burn, faint vanilla - 4.25, T: Like the nose - the best word for the palate seems to be 'intense', loads of dark fruits such as dates and prunes, whisky also plays a huge part of the flavor profile though it is reined in by the huge layering of malt, lots of coffee and chocolate as well as some vanilla, alcohol burn is evident but less noticeable than expected on a 13% beer, sweetness borders on being cloying but is placated by everything else going on in this beer, again - an intense beer - 4.50, M: Thick and velvety texture, mouth feel is quite heavy - 4.50, D: Bourbon County Stout has been one of my hallowed beers for a while and I figured adding some coffee could only improve on that beer, and I can say I am not disappointed, very drinkable but only in moderation - 4.25"
"D - Heat from the alcohol is not abundant or overpowering but is something that builds over the drink. It becomes slightly numbing to the palette but it isn't a big deal."
"Mouthfeel has quite a bit of carbination, more then i expected, which goes well with the viscosity which is massive."
"No way I could I polish off a bomber of this and why would I people need to try this beer, it's really good but not my favorite coffee stout. It's a sipper for sure, BCBCS demands respect."
"D- for a beer of this stature and flavor to be this drinkable is a crime. Its way less hot the an 08 bcs I had a few days ago. One of the best beers I've ever had."
"Dark brown/nearly black opaque body, no visible carbonation due to hue. Minimal tan head, medium dissipation with minimal lacing. The nose is very, very boozy, coffee buried by the alcohol, does get a bit sweeter as the beer warmed. Taste is too boozy, alcohol subsumes the coffee, bourbon barrel notes come through, a bit sweet, not picking up too much hops. Mouthfeel is pretty hot, a bit astringent and filling. If you can cut through the booziness this taste pretty good, but too young and hot, needs another six months to smooth out the alcohol heat, I'm sure this will be better down the road, but it was too boozy right now. Needs some time, check bottling date before consuming."
"Drinkability: I will be seeking out more of this, as the couple of bottles I have left, might not last too much longer. An absolute joy to drink this amazing beer. Can't wait for the Vanilla version."
"D- A sipper for sure. The coffee adds a nice layer. I would have to say I will prefer the original. I am wondering what some age will do to the coffee flavor."
"Glad I was able to finally get hold of this one but I would love to have one fresh and have another to age for a year. If you like the style, you probably will love this one."
"D--I really feel this beer is pretty much a 5 all the way around. I think this is certainly in my top 5 beers for sure. Seek it out, its a must try."
"Notes: Nice variation on the BCS flagship... But while it is rather nicely done, drinkability feels a touch shorter next to the original version. I´ve enjoyed this version tremendously, and I really liked the coffee edge, but felt a bit too long towards the end. Really recommendable in any case."
"D- Surprisingly drinkable and smooth. Leaves a pleasant warm feeling that can only be achieved through the magic of bourbon"
"D: For what it is, it's pretty sippable; a damn good beer"
"The alcohol is fairly well masked, but still makes sure you don't forget about it. Good drinkability overall. Not a huge improvement over Bourbon County Brand Stout, but the coffee adds some bitterness and balance to the mix."
"I will say that one thing my dad and I agreed on is that there really isn't anything wrong with this beer. Try as we might, we just could not fault it for anything, except maybe lack of lacing. We both thought it wasn't like, shed-a-tear good; but fresh, I could well imagine this beer would have been like, top 3 or 5 ever. ISO:2011 bcbcs"
"Suggested pairing: Fresh baked (I mean like 15 minutes fresh) chocolate chip cookies. Oh yeah."
"Aroma of big freshly roasted espresso beans, cocoa, dried pasilla pepper, marshmellow creme and subtle bourbon to tied it all together. Crazy complex taste. Hoppy note first then crazy robust roasted java. Subtle cinnamon, spiced dark chocolate, vanilla. Irish coffee. Bitter deep coffee prick on the tongue. Yet all velvet at the same time. Vanilla, creamy marshmellow velvet smooth mouthfeel. Dry bitter cocoa finish. Touch of peppery bourbon at the end. And oddly enough, a dollop of whip cream on the roof of the mouth. Exceptional drinkability...even more so than the regular BCS."
"Overall chalk up another bad ass American Imperial Stout. Boozy and full of flavor. Perfect sipper for cold midwest winters."
"D: Massive alcohol kick on this one, somewhat filling, aging for a while may have worked better to take some of the heat off this one."
"Edit: I've had this one about 6-7 times now, fresh and aged, and I think when fresh BCS Coffee is the best of the variations. Aged it fades to the same as the normal BCS, but if you can get this fresh it is the best of the BCS beers."
"Drinkability: Damn, that's delicious. Quite strong but quite good. I recall the label mentioning something about aging it up to five years, but I dare say it's fantastic and ready now, unless you want to engage in an exercise in sheer willpower."
"pretty amazing over all however the ABV is what brings this down. way too much booze in this and it REALLY heats up. it would be a great candidate to age but then the coffee would potentially fade. bummer."
"I did not want to believe the hype, but this is so much better than BCS and one of my favorites now."
"D: A good beer. Would have liked to seen this one be a bit more aggressive on the coffee flavor and the sweetness toned done. However, there is an interesting complex of flavors going on, resulting in a quality drink that I have slightly mixed feelings about."
"D- Very awesome brew for sure. I think this one lives up to the hype."
"Not sure how much better this is than the regular GIBCS, but there's no denying that it's pretty damn good. I think I like this version, as the coffee tends to tone down the booze just a bit, while retaining most of the excellent bourbon flavor one gets in the regular version. Regardless. This is a very fine RIS from GI."
"A friend of mind has said before that whenever he's drinking Bourbon County, it's his favorite beer, and I can't help but agree. While this one falls just short of those heights, it's still a truly great beer."
"d- excellent. can't wait for it to be back again, maybe to have a fresh bottle. gi rules."
"MF/D: a gentle fizz that dissolves into a smooth cascade of delectable flavors that fall down the throat. a shame we could only find one bottle. looking forward to GI's october and november releases (if i can find them!)."
"As a person who loves coffee and appreciated a fine bourbon before discovering the finer things in beer, this brew is a homerun. I cannot wait to see what some time will do to the other bottles I have. While I am sure some of the coffee flavors will drop, it will be interesting to see what nuances have a chance to shine through once this brew as a whole starts to mellow out."
"Flavor is delicious! Thick and heavy mouthfeel, very low carbonation, and huge booze factor. Compared to the original, coffee added to this beer makes a great characteristic! Lots of bourbon, thick sugars...molasses, coffee, and even a slight vanilla present(I think). This is indeed a great beer, fortunate to try...and can't wait to try this aged!"
"D - I actually think the BCS is a better beer. Not saying I wouldn't try this again, but it really needs to age in order to reduce the warmt."
"D - A truly amazing beer that lived up to its hype. I will hunt this down annually."
"d- good stuff that you love to sip on, but anything more than sipping is a bit of a stretch. big beers like this one are not to be messed with. luckily it's super tasty stuff or it would just be too much."
"I could have easily finished a bomber of this myself considering the high ABV was barely noticed and so damn delicious. Good thing I split this one up with 3 others and was glad to share. This great stuff but wish I had it fresh so as to distinguish it more from the regular offering."
"Unlike the regular BCS, Coffee Stout has a less alcoholic taste to it. I love BCS, but this is much more drinkable. Pours a dark black with little to no head. A touch of alochol bite up front, with a nice chocolately finish, real smooth. I really didn't taste the coffee as much as I thought I would, but it didn't take away from the quality. Overall a great beer."
"Produced no head and poured a pitch black color, seriously dark beer.Smell on this one is serious bourbon followed by coffee and vanilla. This beer smells awesome.The taste is intense, big alcohol bite at first followed by coffee and chocolate and malt. The mouth-feel is bubbly and rich. drinkability is quite high for a beer at 13 percent. Over all i would definitely get this beer if i saw it in stores, its Awesome!"
"D - very drinkable for 13% this one could get you into trouble"
"o - overall, ANOTHER winner in this series. you just can't go wrong with BCBCS and this year is as good if not better than any other vintage fresh. cheers to GI for keeping it real. i just LOVE this beer."
"Poured a dark as night black that look like motor oil with a thin tan head that left good sticky lacing on the glass. The aroma was really nice with coffee notes that weren't over powering the nose. There was roasted malts, vanilla, dark fruits, oak and hints of bourbon and chocolate. It also had faint booze presence in the background. The flavors on this beer were amazing and complex consisting of chocolate, vanilla, and roasted malts with a good amount of bourbon that was well balanced in the mixture. Dark fruits, booze, and coffee were faint but still added accents to the overall taste. Very delicious beer. The brew was full bodied with a fair amount of carbonation that had a sweet creamy rich and roasty finish. This beer really knocked my socks off. Goose islands regular bourbon county is very good but this one is off the hook its amazing all around I hope I can get my hands on more."
"Whew! Sarious baar. These guys don't mess around. The coffee is muted but there. Masterfully blended characteristics. Poured with a small, fine, light tan head and no lace. Aroma is heavy malt, licorice, light on the coffee, vanilla, bourbon, Flavor's like aroma with the coffee coming out more, super rich complex blend of the vanilla, bourbon, oak, roast, dark, ripe fruits, and on and on and on. Body is luxurious and velvety. Finish is like flavor and surprising not as boozy as you'd think. Unbelievable beer."
"D - Goose Island did a really amazing job on this one. The bourbon is not too much, nor is the coffee. It is just a really delicious imperial stout with crazy good flavors."
"The best beer I've ever had. Done. There's really not that much more to say. I had this the same night I got to try Westy 12 for the first time and this blew me away more. An absolutely mindblowingly good beer if you like your bourbon barrel ages but not exceedinly bourbon-y. Liquid gold. I would make love to this beer if it was feasible."
"Overall, this is an excellent bourbon stout. Goose Island does great things with their barrels. Having this fresh, I'm not sure if it's much better than the regular Bourbon County, but the coffee does add another dimension that is quite good and could possibly aid in the aging of this beer. I'll probably crack my other bottle about 3 years down the road from now. Good stuff."
"Poured up like you'd expect from the BCS. Scents of raisins, licorice, coffee and bourbon (in order of ascending presence). The coffee does wonders for adding a little complexity to the beer, BCS is real heavy on the bourbon flavor while the coffee flavor cuts it a little bit. There's some brown sugar and vanilla that come out as the bourbon is subdued. I thought this was delicious and it was nice to have a beer that more or less met expectations, I've had a lot of misses lately. This was great, split 3 ways I wish I had a little more. Overall really nice."
"Overall, this was one of the best beers I have ever had. i'm glad I didn't have to share the bottle and had no problem putting it away during the US. vs. England game. Well done, GI!"
"Big thanks to Dan/ATLbeerDog for grabbing me a bottle while he was in Chicago recently. Pours an ink black color into my snifter, with a thin dark tan head. Excellent lacing, and dense looking body, no surprise given BCS well deserved reputation. I'm a bit disappointed by the aroma, it's good, don't get me wrong, but I love a powerful (and delicious) coffee aroma in my coffee stouts, and while its there, this beer is just so big, it doesn't come through the same way some of a big favorites do. A heated alcohol somewhat masks the coffee... not to mention bourbon. The taste certainly falls in line with the aroma.There is sweet molasses and chocolate sweetness up front with bourbon and coffee (nicely paired with with some heavily roasted malts) coming out more as it warms up and primarily in the finish. Much like BCS, the mouthfeel is thick and creamy, wonderful. Excellent beer, I wish I had more than one, as I'd love to age it, but I fear further loss of coffee in aging, so I had to drink it reasonably soon. I would love for the intense heat to subside, so that some of the other characteristics could come through further. Just not sure if that is going to happen, since in my experiences, coffee fades, much like, but maybe to not the same degree, as hops."
"Overall: Better than BCS, but not by much. A must try. Cheers!"
"Major League psyched to randomly find this one 'round my primary bar! Let's delve in, shall we? It pours a beastly pitch black topped by about a finger of fizzy, dark tan foam, which, sadly, dies away rather quickly. The nose comprises oak, bourbon, coffee, light vanilla, and nothing else. Period. For something this big, I expected more than this. The taste holds notes of dark roasted malts, a shit-ton of bourbon, oak, chocolate, light vanilla, light coffee, and a tiny bit o' bitterness. Honestly, I felt that, like the normal BCS, the bourbon was kinda overpowering, and, in this case, the coffee was strangely, haphazardly tossed into the trunk and forgotten until a few days into the vacation, by which time the sunburn is so bad that the sunscreen in the bag has been rendered pointless. You know what I mean? Simply put: too much bourbon, not enough coffee; good, but disappointing to say the least. The body is a heavy medium, with a moderate carbonation, a slight oral coating, and a very smooth feel. Overall, a tasty beast, but definitely not what I was told it would be."
"Overall I was HUGELY disappointed with this beer. This beer is basically a Bourbon County Stout with added sweetness to it. The espresso in this beer hardly came through and needed to play a more dominate role, instead what you got was another bourbon bomb. If you truly want to try a good espresso based beer, I would rather recommend Great Divide-Espresso Oak Aged Yeti."
"If you can get your hands on it, do so. It is one of the best tasting barrel aged beers I have ever tasted, and hopefully you feel the same."
"Full bodied and creamy mouthfeel. BCBCS really is impressive. So complexly flavored and I love that the coffee character can stand out amongst all the bourbony goodness. It is quite rich so I certainly can't drink much of it, but really who cares?"
"Notes-I got this bottle at the insistence of my local distributor, according to him they barely managed to get a case of this and due to their limited supply and the beer's popularity were only selling one per customer. I was wary of getting it as to be honest I'm not really a fan of the regular bourbon county stout, I find the bourbon notes of it too overpowering but he insisted I grab a bottle of this while I had the chance. Thankfully I took his advice and now I'm glad I got the chance to try this excellent beer; should you ever see it around I say grab it."
"Drinkability: A step up over the classic GIBCS? Perhaps. A different take? Certainly. It's a little cleaner, fresher, more rounded, and more ""full"" than the original GIBCS, if that makes sense, with the coffee addition doing a lot of good - smoothing out the body, filling in the malt base, cutting down on the alcohol heat in places - but also necessarily having its downsides (the increased slickness and thinning out of the body foremost, in my opinion). Definitely worth seeking out, though I wish they offered it in the 12 oz. bottles like the original - 22 oz. is tough for this one, especially if you're doing it on your own! A sipper, or one to share with friends or pair with a rich (and large) dessert. One of the best beers I've had in a while."
"Drinkability is pretty great. The high ABV doesn't stop this one from going down smoothly, and it manages to be creamy and not very hot. Pretty surprisingly good in this category and would probably be delicious aged. It drinks more like a 6% than a 13%. Nicely done."
"5.0 D: As far as bourbon beers go, this is the king of the hill. Awesome taste and mouthfeel contribute for a great drinkability. No signs of off flavors, just smooth drinking throughout."
"D- This is a good drinking beer. Overall I must admit that I prefer Bourbon County more. Interested to see what becomes of this beer when it gets a year or two on it. Goose Island has been making some standout beers lately and this is no exception. Good job guys! The only downfall is the higher ABV doesn't make this a big drinker."
"Overall, a first rate beer. Performed well against KBS, though I will say it didn't blow it out of the water as much as I was expecting. That being said, very much enjoyed and try it if you get the chance."
"Pours a dark black vicious liquid with a thin caramel colored head. Has an aroma of bourbon, coffee and subtle hints of chocolate. Starts sweet with a chocolaty coffee flavor. Alcohol comes through. Very boozy. The coffee spice adds to the bite. Notes of licorice mixed in. No. 3 on BA (at the time of tasting) is a bit high. KBS and Old Raspy XII are better IMO."
"D - Very, very good Imperial Stout and definitely on par with the standard version. Definitely a contender for one of the top coffee stouts out there. Yum!"
"Bottle pours a dark black with creamy caramal foam. Smells very bourbony up front. The taste follow suits with intensity of bourbon and coffee flavours lingering. I find this more hot then regular Bourbon County. Pretty good stout overall though and glad I got to try this. A bigger fan of the regular Bourbon County and Night Stalker from goose island, though."
"D - Having this 22 with dinner...holds up well throughout, but not sure I could have much more in a sitting. Flavors are intense and really good. Alcohol level is high, definitely noticeable too. This doesn't detract from the experience, even enhances it, but makes it hard to drink a lot of. Probably a good idea not to push the limits with this one."
"I've had better, but not many. Good stuff."
"Mouthfeel is great, smooth and creamy. Carbonation is nice and low. A bit thinner than I remember regular BCS being, it could be my imagination. Excellent taste makes this more drinkable than a 13% stout should be."
"6/4/2010"
"The beer clings to the glass much like Ten FIDY, is full bodied, chewy, smooth, and has decent carbonation. The alcohol is not well hidden, but I did not expect it to be. This is a very nice Imperial Stout,and keeps getting better as it warms in the glass."
"Give it a go."
"Congrats to Goose. You knocked it out of the park on this one! And congrats to the Hawks. Now I just need my Cubs to pull it off..."
"D: Wonderful stout. The espresso and bourbon play wonderfully into this beer. The heat is the only limit to this beer's drinkability."
"Practically perfect as a young beer. Can't wait to see how it ages in my cellar!"
"Overall: well done. I don't feel that I'm lenient towards barrel-aged imperial stouts. This one really earned its score."
"D- at 13%, the drinkability goes down quite a bit. for the alcohol I would say its pretty good, although pretty hot at the same time. again, wish there was more coffee. slightly disappointing given the hype for this beer. i would like to do a side by side with same year the regular bourbon county stout to see the difference."
"Pours a dark coloured body, with a little head. Looks thick. Aromas of coffee up front, only fainter bourbon. The taste was cold coffee with tons of milk and sugar up front. Something I do not drink. As I kept drinking samples, and with food, the coconut taste (and the lactic acid) more than the bourbon accumulated.I finished 300 ml. but 750 ml. was just too much."
"Poured from a bomber and split 3 ways. Dark black, not the thickest imperial stout ever but its pretty viscous stuff. Medium brown head. The aroma is lots and lots of bourbon, oak, coffee, raisin and bitter chocolate. I was worried after the nose that the bourbon barrel would overpower the other flavors but it did not. The main progression of flavors was fairly linear to me with a few subtleties that are harder to place. The main progression goes bourbon, dark chocolate syrup, bitterness from the hops, then coffee followed by a lingering coffee aftertaste that's nearly indistinguishable from the aftertaste of a good cup of coffee. Subtleties throughout of anise, oak, and some dark fruitiness that is raisin-like as in the nose. Feel is creamy, thick, and warming but just not quite thick enough for a 5. While probably not a good idea I would have no problem polishing off an entire bomber of this stuff, something I don't say too often about big beers like this. The past few weeks I've had a handful of highly hyped beers that turned out to be letdowns so it was really nice to be blown away again by a great beer."
"Taste has way more coffee than the nose would leave you to believe. Almost light on the front of the tongue with carbonation, but is medium to heavy bodied overall especially when it warms up. Getting some bourbon flavor as well vanilla. Has a nice coffee bitterness to it. A great beer no doubt."
"Overall I'd call this an excellent stout and I certainly won't pass on the opportunity to enjoy another."
"D- If you have read my review up to this point, you probably are going to guess what I'm going to say here...Yup u guessed it, just to boozey and hot. I'm anxious to revisit this brew in a year or so."
"M: Perfect for the style. The lower carbonation gives the beer a creamy feel and its not overly viscous."
"The mouthfeel reminds me a bit of 2% milk, very smooth. It's not too high on my drinkablility scale, due to the richness and alcohol presence. It's a splitter and a sipper that demands respect, control, and attention. Deservedly so. In my top 5 without questions. Why did I not by more of this when I had the chance? Why?"
"Overall this is certainly a great twist on the original classic. Another fine stout from Goose Island. Highly Recommended."
"An excellent example of an American Double/Imperial Stout."
"I truly was excited to try this beer. Anything that reaches the top 10 on BA is a must try. But this really is a massive disappointment. Choke the hype. This beer is almost more overly hyped than Patrick Rue's 18% bourbon RIS. The pour was expected. Gorgeous dark stout with tight mocha carbonation that disspated quickly. Best part about this beer for sure, however everything on was total crap. Aroma is straight bourbon. Nothing complex what so ever. At least bring some complexity into this. I thought this beer was brewed with top notch Intelligentsia Black Cat Espresso. Taste is of more bourbon with slight creme'd sugar and lactose. Can I get some toasty malt or some hops in this, please? Taking another whiff of this, I get cheap vanilla extract with more milk chocolate (hence the lactoce again). The body is rich and full without any stickyness. Finish is one dimensional with bourbon straight through. I hardly want another sip. Luckily I'm splitting this beer with a friend or else I'd drain pour at least half the bottle. I'd say if one is looking for a coffee infused RIS done the right way, search out the Mikkeller Beer Geek Weasel (BA'ed one if you can find it)."
"D: There is a bit of heat that comes through (as there is with regular BCS), but it is covered up quite nicely by the vanilla and coffee. Still, this is one to drink with a few friends."
"Pours very dark and is black as a coal mine in the glass. One inch of mocha colored head that had very good retention. Thick coating of lacing recedes back into the liquid after each sip. The aroma is everything you hope for in a coffee infuses, barrel-aged stout. Each element is equally balanced. I smell whole bean, freshly roasted coffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, chocolate, and alcohol. The flavor is almost equally awesome. It only falls short because of the alcohol heat. Coffee flavor that is almost the best I have had in a beer. The barrel-aging lends bourbon, vanilla, and woody notes. Still a substantial stout under all the other flavors and that is very important. Awesome thick, chewy, and creamy body. The best of Goose Island stouts is still evident in this beer. A great beer that I will need to find another bottle and age for awhile. A relatively good value as well, I could see several local breweries selling this for $10 more a bottle."
"EDIT: Split a full bottle with fresh palate and updated the review. Moved up with smell and taste, a bit down with drinkability."
"The beer is very thick body and viscous. It actually tastes feels like it was boiled down or thickened, but that is part of the fine appeal of this classic brew. There is a nice little zip after you taste it. The flavors linger on the tongue for sometime. The alcohol does not overwhelm you. It is not up front but I am sure it will let me know as I drink this. This is definitely one of the best stouts I have had. This puts Goose Island on the map as one of the fine breweries of the world with this accomplishment. I can't say enough about this beer. Truly enjoyable with every sip, I mean small sip."
"Goose Island has made a masterpiece"
"The mouthfeel is so silky smooth with just the right amount of warming alcohol burn considering how bourbon heavy this beer is. Carbonation is perfect; it is present in the taste and has a nice scrubbing effect but not overdone to be distracting. The drinkability is good considering the ABV and the richness but it is such a thick calorie ridden beer I don't think it can score higher than a 4."
"I hope they make this on an occasional basis as this is a damn good beer. I had a sinking feeling I would not like this since I didn't particularly like KBS but this takes what KBS is about and melds it with BCS to make a beautiful beverage. Highly recommended!"
"My only regret, is not getting another to take with, so I can try with a cigar. A simply amazing beer,that is worth the hype. For me though, I think I prefer the regular BCS. I'm not a a huge coffee drinker, but that didn't negatively affect my opinion. Just a great brew that I would purchase frequently if it was available."
"D: Not real drinkable. This one needs to be laid down for a bit. My only fear is that the coffee will fall out a bit. I will take my chances though as this one is way too boozy as is."
"A fantastic beer that I will revisit whenever possible."
"A decadent and delicious titan that is well deserving of the hype."
"D - Simply outstanding, and completely deserving of all the hype received."
"Could this be the ultimate dessert beer? You've got yourself some chocolate soufflé, a shot of espresso, and a little nip of bourbon all rolled into one. The only thing missing is a fine Montecristo to puff on afterwards. My only issue with this, and it's the same one I have with the regular BCS, is that the bourbon is still a little to hot right now but put a little age on this sucker and it's going to be sublime in a couple of years. This is just the definition of a decadent beer."
"Body is fairly thick, but seems a hair lighter than regular BCS. Overall, a delicious drinkable stout. I cracked this open on a full stomach on a day where the high temp exceeded 80 degrees. And I'll have no difficulty working through my glass."
"All of the coffee's faded except for a fruity, creamy coffee character, but the base beer is present in all its glory. Moderate booze, vanilla, coconut, caramel, bourbon all along with a lot of roast and some Amaretto. Dessert-like, this beer is full in body, sweet, boozy, creamy, mildly coffee like, buckwheat honey. Yum"
"This is a heavy, dense powerful libation. In my opinion, the drinkability is hurt a bit by the strong boozy aftertaste. On the other hand, I really like the fact that the coffee is nicely balanced. I have had way to many beers that are just coffee bombs."
"Very smooth mouthfeel, though not overly creamy like some stouts. I actually didn't know what abv this was until part way into drinking it and saw it was 13%. It doesn't seem boozy at all, so I was a little bit surprised. I was easily able to finish off the bomber of this and I was a bit dissapointed to learn it was the last bottle at the brewpub at that time. I'm glad I went back two days later to get (yet again) the last bottle, but this time I took it home with me to enjoy later."
"Overall I was not impressed. I was expecting more of a coffee flavor like an Abyss or Breakfast Stout but it was just not there. This thing is pure bourbon, and the only saving grace was that the alcohol was kept in check and didn't also affect the drinkability. It was just too sweet without enough complexity. I believe aging would help this beer some, but overall I don't think it will ever live up to the hype."
"Taste us spot on to the nose. Original BCS with just a wonderful dose of coffee. I was worried this would have too much coffee but its just the right amount to compliment the dark, sweet notes of BCS. Dense and rich, it coats the tongue. Not 'drinkability' but, 'sipability' earns it as close to a 5 as I can get."
"D- This is an awesome well put together, well balanced stout. Its still a bit too hot-but it will probably be unstoppable with 1 yr on it."
"Drinkability is appropriate for what GI was going for, which appears to be decadence of Wagnerian proportions. They succeeded. But it's a little disappointing when something tastes really good and you can barely finish your half of a bomber."
" This is right up there with ORF, KBS, Abyss and other barrel aged stouts I've had. I need to have one big ass bourbon barrel stout tasting to see which is really my favorite."
"Lovely in an extreme sense!"
"D: Like I said before, I'm not sure how this beer could possibly be better. This proves that limited availability does not = better flavor. I could have this again and again and not be tired of it and in fact, can't wait to see what a couple of months will do to this. Immensely smooth and complex, this is the best of the best. Seek it out, it won't dissapoint."
"Drinkability: Pretty good despite the high abv and strong flavors."
"Creamy mouthfeel, though perhaps not as thick as one might expect. It's a rich beer, but not overly palate wearying."
"D-this has a great balance, quite coffee forward and a lot of sweetness. the barrel is light but still present. very good beer and hides the huge abv quite well."
"DB- The $13 bottle was more than worth it. If this beer was able to be mass produced I would probably get a case every month. An amazing balance of the popular barrel-aged stout flavors. I can dream of this being on-tap someday for me to try."
"IMO, this beer didn't meet the hype. Maybe with some age the alcohol wouldn't rear its ugly head."
"All in all, I tell ya what, this is a very good brew. This, to me, does not deserve the #3 spot on the top 100 beer list. This to me is more of a #20 at best. Very good to try at least once, but slightly overratted in my opinion."
"Beer Hype!? Not Here! I received this beer from a trade, and didn't know much about it. I watched it climb on the top 100 for about 3-4 weeks before I even realized I had it sitting in my cellar. Needless to say I was excited to try it. I love the regular Bourbon County so this has to be better right?! Yep, it sure was. This was a true pleasure to drink. The mouth feel was on point, the taste were all distinct in their own. Strong Chocolate, Espresso, Bourbon, and hints of Vanilla. I would drink this beer again and buy this beer again. While I am not sure it is worthy of #3 in the world or higher. It's Pretty Damn Good!"
"D - this is a solidly crafted imperial stout. The bourbon is more subtle than the regular bourbon county stout, making this more of a fudgy coffee stout. I had to split this with my family, but I wish I had more to take down. This is a different beast than the regular bourbon county."
"Pours into a snifter an extremely viscous, thick oily pitch black. Hard pour produces a light tan thin bubbly head that quickly fades to nothing and no lacing as expected for this style of beer. Aroma is primarily composed of cocoa and bourbon and not quite as much coffee as expected though that becomes stronger as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is near perfect as expected from experience with the original BCS. Extremely thick, chewy and smooth with light carbonation and an endlessly lasting finish. The flavor has a much strong bourbon presence than expected, but it is much smoother and balanced than a fresh bcs is and the coffee becomes more obvious as the beer warms and the longer you savor the taste on the palate. Flavor also gains vanilla and molasses like sweetness that lasts long through the finish. I was expecting much more of a coffee presence from this and from this sample I'm much more optimistic about aging this beer. Regardless, I like forward to revisiting a larger sample very soon once I get a bottle of my own."
"J"
"Jet black pour with minimal tan head. Incredibly intense aroma with bourbon, smoke, vanilla, charred oak, big bitter espresso and boozy dark fruit. The flavor is a little cloying with notes of strong fermented dark fruit, loads of molasses, heavy char oak, smoky bourbon, soy, vanilla and alcohol. Creamy full body with soft carbonation. This is probably one of the best new bottles of the year!"
"Bottled 3/26/2010. The beer pours dark brown with a tan head. The aroma is ridiculously complex with notes of chocolate, soy sauce, oak, bourbon and coffee. The flavor is chocolate, coffee, toffee, a tad bit of soy sauce and some nice sweetness. Thick mouthfeel and low carbonation. I really thought this beer would be over hyped as new releases often are, but it wasn't. A great beer and one of the best stouts I have ever had."
"D: So smooth, this drinks like BCS at 18 months. I would not be surprised if this beer had been aged before the addition of the Black Cat Espresso."
"It does not seem ready, though, and like the Speedway Stout, I think has a lot of aging potential and should be excellent in 3 years. My opinion, of course. Dark Lord still reigns absolute in my book."
"D: One bomber was definitely my limit, and that was pushing it. Good to the last drop, but my tastebuds were burnt out by the end."
"D: Intense, yet very balanced and drinkable. Goose Island's sense of balance without sacrificing intense, delicious flavours never ceases to amaze me."
"D= I found the drinkability of this to be even higher than regular BCS. An all around success and a beer that I will happily drink more of."
"D: This beer is very good, but right now I believe it is over-hyped and being over-rated. Tasty stuff, but certainly not top 10 in the world."
"Mouthfeel is dense, rich and heavy. A big, bold brew all around that will warm the stomach for sure. A great twist on the already amazing Bourbon County. I have to give big kudos to Intelligentsia as their Black Cat Espresso is awesome and really helps to make this brew what it is! Cheers to Goose Island and Intelligentsia...now can we just get this in 4packs please?? A bomber is a tad much in one sitting."
"A great beer to celebrate 300 ratings with! Here's to the next 300 and thanks to all the great traders I've been lucky to swap with! Cheers :)"
"Upon first sip the viscosity is immediately noticed, and then flavors of milk chocolate, coffee beans, and a perfectly balanced medley of vanilla, caramel and tannins from the bourbon barrel. The coffee character is restrained, plainly noticeable but at a moderate level that adds depth without overwhelming the base beer. Alcohol becomes apparent in the mid-palate, at a harmonious level with the rest of the flavors, lending a sharpness that balances the initial sweetness. Chewy, almost syrupy from front to back with a long finish of coffee, caramel and warming bourbon. This is outstanding, one of the most memorable beers I've had this year."
"Drinkability- Really really love this one. Honestly it was a bit of a disappointment from what I remember at Dark Lord Day, but about the lamest disappointment ever because the beer is still REALLY delicious. The coffee doesn't seem quite as potent and realistically in a year when BCS really gets good the coffee will probably be all but an afterthought. Better than regular BCS? Yes. Could it use more coffee? YES!! Seek this out though, very good beer."
"Great full body, carbonation is good. There is a slight creamy edge. Alcohol is present, but not overwhelming. Some sweetness, but it too seems to be the right amount. Yes, this is a little young, but feels top notch to me. I can't imagine how wonderful this beer will be in a year or two. Fantastic."
"Hmmm....beer is sweet and some of the bourbon edge from the regular version is missing here. Perhaps the addition of coffee some how mellowed the liquor character of the beer. Unfortunately, that's why I drink bourbon county, for the hot liquor flavor. There is some bitterness to this version, greater than the other, not as dry, coffee flavors in the back. I've had several vintages of the other BCS and on draft and I enjoyed the non-coffee more. A great experience to try this though for sure. Hopefully the wife will love it."
"I oblige, and am happily met with an onslaught of roasted coffee, dark chocolate and darker fruits (fig, currant, raisin). Almost instantly, the barrel-aging lashes at the tongue with a boozy heat that screams of wooden tannins. The carbonation level is bit too high for my liking, and makes the body feel thinner than it should. Still, the medium-thickness glides effortlessly across the palate, and never becomes overly chewy or vinous. All in all, a great beer worthy of the BCS name. Thanks again to hopsleeroy for the share, and congrats on the wedding!"
"So glad to get a crack at this one as I've drank a good amount of GI since it showed up in the Boston area. The pour is great and aroma is like sticking your nose in a bag of fresh ground coffee. The mouthfeel and drinkability are off the charts without the alcohol burn that I get from fresh BCS. A great beer to share a bomber with friends with and one I don't think needs to be punished to the cellar for a few years. Rivals the 2007 Abyss as the most complex beer I've laid lips on and no reason to doubt that this beer deserves the accolades that it has been receiving....unless you live in California:)"
"Very heavy and silky smooth body makes for an incredible moutfeel. The only place I can mark it down is the drinkability, because of its sweetness and 13% ABV. It's not my favorite beer, or even my favorite imperial stout (Abyss enjoys that honor), but it's definitely top 10, and worthy of its world class ratings."
"D= Awesome... it really is! I can't think of anything that would make it better!"
"This beer being #3 and Nightstalker being #98 on the best of BA is just stupid. Perhaps people give it a higher score because of its rarity?"
"D= Wonderful brew. The regualar BCS is one of my favorite stouts and this one is just as great. Very similar to the regular while being just a little different. I really look forward to the Vanilla version. This is world class but I can think of a few stouts I've liked more."
"Bomber bottle from DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY. Bottled on 3/26/10. Pours black, darkest of heads, with staying power, going to a thick collar and a tiny bubble film. Nose of sugary espresso, vanilla, and roasted malts. Big and chewy. More coffee grounds, huge notes of coffee, vanilla, brandy, and dark and sludgy goodness. World class Double Stout, tasty and delicious, what else can be said"
"Drinkability is superb. I could sip on this all night."
"This is a quality beer. It is worthy of most of the hype and makes me excited to try the vanilla and rare versions rumored to be coming out in the future."
"I am a big fan of the original BCS, so I jumped on the chance to grab some of these. I am blown away by how good it is. Easily the best bourbon barrel aged beer I have had. Deserving of all the hype and high ratings."
"D - Ideally, a 22 oz bottle would be split about 5 ways. I can hardly hold that against this beer, but I can wish it was also bottled in 12 oz form so I could enjoy it more regularly. Oh well..."
"D - Like I said above I had to seal the remaining bottles so that I wasn't tempted to drink them. This is by no means a two or three bottles in a night beer. It is a sipping beer meant to be savored with a good friend and a good movie."
"Chewy medium body with lots of silky dark chocolate malts, hot bourbon, deep roasted coffee/espresso bean, toffee and nut. Very roasty up front with a prominent roasted coffee/espresso flavor followed by the silky dark chocolate notes and a very prominent bourbon presence that lingers into a long sweet dry finish. The heat from the beer is mostly from the bourbon barrel and overall, at 13% the ABV is decently masked. The bourbon barrel also gives off a touch of vanilla that adds to the silky chocolate notes, balancing out the hot bourbon/alcohol and deep roasted coffee notes. Very well balanced and very tasty but this beer is just a bit too hot at this stage and will only improve with age. Recommended!"
"I hate to join the stampede, but hell, this is a great beer. Harnessing the bourbon of the original, cutting it with just the right amount of evidently quality coffee, & doing who knows what else to it. Darn near perfect. I will seek out more of this, tomorrow."
"D: I don't know what's in the water over on Fulton Street, but I hope Greg and his crew keep drinking it. This is, hands down, the best, most fully realized beer I've had in ages!"
"Amazing beer overall, not sure I would prefer it over some of the beers it's currently ranked above (it's #3 at the time of this review), but it's still awesome and I would love to have it again."
"Tastes even better than it smells, nicely rich with some great but subtle coffee taste. Get the bourbon and vanilla influence in the barrel. Goes down like a smooth, syrupy, thick beer that coats the threat and leaves some stickiness in the throat. I destroyed the bomber so I guess that makes this a 5. Love this beer, want more of it."
"Find this, Drink this, Enjoy this."
"d. way to go goose island, this is your greatest accomplishment. I hope they decide to continue production on this brew next year. sorry dark lord but....bcbcs is better"
"I've been waiting for this beer for some time, time not wasted. First off I am a huge fan of BCBS, wow what a beer. This is better, I hope Goose Island continues with this one. This beer pours pitch black with a beautiful dark tan head. The smells of Bourbon and Coffee are simply fantastic. This beer is extremely similar to BCBS, it is however smoother, cleaner. BETTER. Definitely something I will buy more of as it is available. WOW. Thumbs up Goose Island, keep this beer alive."
"Thanks to chefmikeanderson for the split. Poured from a 22oz bottle into a wine glass. Poured oh so dark and with a very dark head, about 2 fingers deep. The smell coming off of this beer is incredable! Roast malts, burbon, vanilla, and coffee dominated. It tastes just like it smells, and the burbon is better balanced by the coffee than the bcs. The combination of oaky/vanilla, burbon, coffee,with such a great stout is amazing. It's not too heavy in mouthfeel, but it sticks to your mouth and that great flavor lingers till the next sip. For 13% the alcohol is pretty well hidden even as it warmed to room temp, and with some more age this beer will be incredibly drinkable. Can't wait to get some more of this!!"
"If you like BCS, believe the hype on this one."
"D/Overall: Absolutely outstanding. Takes everything that makes BCS a world class beer and improves on it. Listen to me: believe the hype."
"This is truly one of Goose Islands finest they have ever produced and am hope they continue with their fine crafting of these fine stouts for many years to come."
"Consumed: 5/11/2010"
"D- this is the current ""it"" beer. its not that limited, its sold in several states. this is a totally solid beer all the way around. give it a shot if you get the chance. theres a reason its climbed its way to the top so fast. it wont stay for long in the top 10 (currently 6), but itll have its place in the top 100 for some time. seek this one out."
"I liked this one enough to go back and buy the rest of what the store had. I am not a huge coffee stout fan but this was superior beer - reminded me of Dark Lord but just a notch below in taste and complexity."
"I have never been compelled to write a review before, but this is my favorite beer of all time. It is perfection. The coffee flavors are huge and balance out the bourbon really well. I am not even that crazy about BCBS, but this is just amazing. I think it could benefit from some aging, but it certainly can be drunk right now."
"As a coffee beer fanatic, this one doesn't exactly knock my socks off, but as a beer lover it's fantastic. I can't say that it's a major deviation from the base beer but, why mess with a good thing I suppose."
"Pours a thick, oily black color, with a thin cap of mocha foam. Initial aromas of dark chocolate truffles, bourbon, vanilla and dark fruit, although rich coffee aromas become more prominent as it warms. Flavors of bourbon and oak, chocolate covered espresso beans. Nice creamy mouthfeel, with perfect carbonation and a lingering warming alcohol presence. An outstanding beer."
"Overall, yes, this beer lived up to the hype. Simply amazingly and complex. Curious to see what time will do to this wonderful beer. I would highly recommend everyone try this if you can."
"D: I plowed through my 22oz bottle way too quickly for a 13.00% brew. Very pleased with this offering, I hope it makes a repeat appearance every year. Now lets see if I can sit on my other bottle for at least a year. Its going to be tough."
"drinkability: requires a liter of water to be consumed with it, otherwise the burn and sticky nature might overpower me"
"Very drinkable because it is so tasty, I do hate the format, I wish it came in 12oz 4pks like the old Bourbon county, 22oz of this is almost to much, but I did finish it over the course of night. Otherwise Excellent job Goose."
"Regardless, I'm ecstatic with what Goose Island is doing with the BCS brand, and the coffee version completely surpassed my expectations. This is an incredibly enjoyable, intricately detailed stout, and any fan of the style owes it to himself/herself to try it. Seek this out at all costs!"
"More of a liquor than a beer. Just like the regular BCS. Maybe a little more coffee, but it is hard to say. If I had the two side by side, it would be hard to tell them apart. It is a very enjoyable big beer. Though, for what it is, BCS is still king."
"D: For such a massive flavored beer it goes down amazingly smooth. The flavors are so upfront when first sipped and then slowly disappear making me yearn for one sip after another. I would have absolutely no problem downing the whole bottle."
"This is good, but will be better. (ala KBS)"
"D: the 13% is hidden very well, until you get about halfway through a bomber and start to feel that warmth in your belly. ha. definitely recommend this beer. is it the 5th best in the world? probably not, but very good nonetheless"
"I had no idea there was as much surrounding this beer as there is. I was lucky enough to snag a single bottle of this today at Bermans in Lexington; thanks for setting it aside for me. With a motor oil like consistency, this beer pours out pitch black with just a lacing for heading. Nose is very rich with coffee, espresso, chocolate and molasses. The taste is pretty much the exact same, and when I say rich, that is exactly what I mean. Very slick on the tongue, and again, like motor oil. The alcohol is masked somewhat by all of the big flavors, which makes for an interesting drinking experience. Is the hype deserved? Yeah I suppose so. Get your bottle today if you see some."
"Drinkability - This is a one and done. And I don't just mean on a session basis. It was interesting to try, not something that I'd re-buy. It is just hard to drink something this hot, thick, and and sweet."
"This beer is a masterpiece. Worth the hype and praise. An absolute contender for the BA #1 beer in the world. I never in my life thought I'd give a 5.0 but here it is. I'd buy cases of this if they kept making it. A truly special beer that I'm thankful I went out of my way to find."
"drinkability - very good - i hope they bring this back in 12oz sometime down the road"
"And it just goes down so easy, and I want sip after sip, and if I had to pick one beer for ever and ever it would be this. I'm so glad I have never given a perfect score to any beer before, because none comes close to this. I first sampled this at WhiskyFest in Chicago, where there was no shortage of extraordinary beverages, and this one blew them out of the water. It helps that the alcohol presence is incredibly mild for a beer this strong. As someone who likes the regular BCS better fresh, I can't see enjoying this a great deal more with age. Glad I still have a few bottles to savor. Completely deserving of my first perfect score."
"D: Right now I am praying to the beer gods that Goose Island will make this a year round brew. If it weren't for the limited availability there would be almost nothing else in my cellar after tasting this."
"I salute you, Goose Island."
"P.S. Bong the sauce."
"Awesome all around beer that lives up to the hype. I have two more bottles, but may need a couple more for aging. For a 13% beer, it drinks so well. Don't miss out on this one!"
"Drinkability - BCCS and BCS are certainly different, but it's by no means night and day. It is certainly more mellow, more nuanced, and more drinkable. Good stuff!"
"Cheers"
"This beer is absolutely phenomonal. I picked up a few bottles and am looking forward to enjoying this one through the aging process."
"D: This is one heavy, intense brew. A bomber between 5 people was more than enough. Very tasty, although I imagine it'd be hard to finish even a 12oz. bottle alone."
"This beer, in little more than a week and a half, has surpassed Dark Lord on the BA Top 100. Will it stay? Hard to tell, but with ratings and reviews like mine streaming in, it's hard to see it becoming forgotten a year from now. If you live in the Chicago area, track down one of the few remaining bottles. If you don't, set up those trades now."
"Overall, this is a solid beer and I am glad I have access to it. It reminds me so much of kbs. Doing a side by side would be awesome. This beer is very drinkable and 11 oz is not enough for me. This beer is legit. A must try."
"Drinkability is where this beer really shines, I have never seen such a big beer (13% ABV) with such great drinkability."
"Drinkability: I could sip this all day and all night. There is enough complexity to keep the whole glass interesting, but the smooth construction makes each sip wonderfully simple. I just had a revelation."
"Rich and bold in flavor. Not much charred smokey quality, but plenty of chocolate, bourbon, dark fruit and coffee to keep you coming back for more. If you like big boozy stouts... this is a must try."
"D- Again, for 13% this is a great drink but definitely a sipper and one to enjoy. Better as it warms in my opinion."
"Overall this is mindblowing. One of the best beers I have ever had by a mile. Insanely good. Please go find this one, it is worth every last second of your time."
"Overall a simply fantastic beer worth trying."
"For a sipper, this one is good. The alcohol is quite assertive in the smell and taste, and the bourbon presence is very heavy. I think this one will mellow out with some age though."
"I can't wait to crack another one of these open and try to continue pulling out all the nuances this has to offer."
"D: This is a beer that borders the line between a spirit and a beer. The bourbon is very present which i enjoy, but the alcohol is definitely noticeable. Maybe chilled a bit under room temperature would help"
"WOW! Blown away by this one...not usually a huge fan of any beer that has ""coffee"" in the title...I did not taste much coffee at all in this beer, all I tasted was a regular Bourbon County Stout tuned down a notch with incredible aroma, taste and feel, the drinkability is through the roof compared to regular BCS. Incredible beer, that's all I can say...pretty sure this is my first perfect score in 100+ reviews...it deserves it..."
"I really hope they make this again just so that more people have the chance to try it. OUTSTANDING."
"2011: Anjilanaka... wow, they topped the subtlety of the first batch with a straight up toasted marshmallow/melted dark chocolate/deep roasty coffee BOMB. Rich as all hell, sticky and decadent. Awe inspiring..."
"Overall, an amazing experience"
"Reminds me ever so much of KBS or Devil Over a Barrel on steroids. Lovely looks, beautiful taste and perfect mouthfeel leave me looking forward to the rest of the bottle and the others that I purchased. Can't wait until Vanilla BCS makes an appearance later this year.... =)"
"Thick and smooth... perfect. Just too strong to be considered drinkable. Enjoy what you have, because pound for pound, this is right up there with the best. If you're like me and think the regular BCS is too strong, give this a try because the coffee balances this out more than I could imagine!"
"I don't taste the 13.00%abv, but it's not hiding it's effects. This is extremely smooth, well balanced, complex, and highly drinkable. Just be careful with it!"
"There's not much that I can say about this beer that hasn't already been said. Had it at DLD and it's absolutely phenomenal! The coffee really cuts down the bourbon sweetness of the regular BCS without being overwhelming or cloyingly sweet, and makes it much more drinkable. Makes me a little more eager for the Rare BCS and Vanilla BCS later this year."
"Overall, wow, what a beer. Highly drinkable, as downing this is just a heavenly experience. ISO more bottles!"
"the drinkability is fantastic, I would have no problem demolishing an entire bottle. my glass always seems to run dry very fast."
"D: Goose Island hit the jackpot with this beer. This is my favorite variant of BCS yet (EDIT: after trying Rare, this is now my second favorite variant). Considering its rich nature, I would prefer if this beer were sold in 4 packs. But bottom line- this beer is solid!"
"Exceptional flavor. Roasted goodness. Bit of licorice and a lot of espresso... wonderful slight bitterness to set off the sweet."
"This is the petron of beers, the Marissa Miller of beers, the Jimi Hendrix of beers, etc. End of story, you need to drink this... now."
"MandD: yes, please pour me another."
"D: Like I said this beer is near perfection. I will never really understand what exceptional means when it comes to the appearance on a stout, I feel like it's more of a judgment call/ depends on how you are feeling that day when it comes to beers of this caliber. A bit hot in the finish, can't wait to see how this beer develops. Love love love the fact that this beer is readily available and is not hoarded like KBS, easily on par and maybe even passes it in terms of coffee barrel aged beers. A beer to be sought out for sure!"
"This beer is awesome, a great play on bcs, can't wait to get some age on this."
"Overall, this is the best new beer I've had in a while and possibly the best ""readily available"" beer in the market right now. I put readily available in parentheses because once everyone gets a taste of this, every case in existence will fly off the shelves quicker than you can hop on Beer Advocate and plea with people to ""STOP HOARDING ALL THE COFFEE BCS"""
"I'm definitely going to lay one down for while."
"D - Extremely. Drinks like a 7% beer. 5.0"
"D - Very good balance and flavor to this BCCS, but with it's young age the alcohol is a bit too harsh, especially with the first few sips. I can't wait to try this beer with age on it! The coffee flavor is fantastic and could use more bringing out."
"M/D- Wow, this beer is one of the best I've ever had. Brilliant work by Goose Island."
"D - Could do the bomber, which is a hell of an accomplishment considering how rich and high ABV this is. Could possibly go for more, it's a great slow slipper to take up some of your time, as it gets more interesting as it warms up. I honestly think this is the best beer I've ever had."
"Overall, this is a solid beer. It doesn't blow away the normal BCS, but it's definitely good, and I'd give it a slight edge due to how smooth it is, how the alcohol is hidden even before aging, and the excellent coffee taste."
"Of course the beer is strong and physically limits how much one can drink, but for the style, the drinkability is great and I could drink it for as long as I could afford it. The flavor and thickness doesn't detract from the drinkability. I could drink more than a bomber myself and enjoy every sip of it as much as the first."
"Mouthfeel is heavy, smooth and syrupy, fantastic."
"It's crazy to talk that the coffee bean aging could possibly improve the Bourbon County Stout. I'm not sure that the Coffee Release is better but it's certainly not any worse."
