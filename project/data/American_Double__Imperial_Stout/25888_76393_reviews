"O: Really good stuff. Lots of great elements at work on the nose and the flavor profile, but those elements tend to clash against -- rather than complement -- each other. So not as complex or outstanding a beer as Huna, but very enjoyable nonetheless."
"On tap @ Clinton Hall, NYC on 3/24/15."
""
"Had it rated right below Hunahpu as the #2 beer on the planet until I tried this year's batch. Now I would rate it equal to Hunahpu in the world of special craft imperial stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I did like this one more than Huna, now after almost exactly a year the 2014 Huna I drank might have lost some impact, this bottle is not as old, they came out in (early November?) I believe so it has held its adjunct impact pretty well in that amount of time, now after a year in bottle like Huna I may be saying the same thing. I really need to revisit Huna as soon as I can to give it a more thorough analysis. So far, however, I still like the heat and earthiness of Bomb the best of the ones I have tried from this style. This is a close second. Love the cinnamon impact, goes really well with the combination of flavors they are working with."

"Taste is mostly milk chocolate with a nice soft burn from the ancho chili throughout -- a little stronger on the finish. Chili provides a nice dryness and savory spice to the feel."
""
""
""
""
"Nice body with tons of great cinnamon flavor and finishes with a little peppery/spice from the ancho chiles.  Picked up on some vanilla which pairs well with the cinnamon. All around great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Unsure if this bottle or if this is usual taste. Very good imperial stout with all the usual characteristics of a very well made IS. Met the hype. Thought it might be in vein of Hunahpu...but no. Found flavor unbalanced with cinnamon  way too dominant. Ended up being a ""spiced"" IS more lent to Christmas than otherwise. Will keep remaining bottles to age for the holidays."

"Perfect stout for enjoying on cold winter day"
""
""
""
""
"This beer is great. I full bomber might be a little much but this small pour left me wanting a little bit more."
""
"Overall just wow. Like a molé beer. Very Aztec. Or Maya. Not sure which. Ingredients are pure and clean, and work so well together."
""
""
""
""
"Seek it out on draft. If you want to rave about the other chili spiced stouts, visit the granddaddy of them all."
""
"Delicious, full bodied flavored stout. Lots of cocoa nib, some vanilla, I don't really get ancho chile and I get a pinch of cinnamon. Very good. Almost like a beer milkshake."
""
""
""
"World class stout. Enough said."
""
""
"Went head to head w/ Hunahpu! Very close. More boozy/vanilla, more foam, slightly thinner but not a thin stout, more carbonation, slightly bitter pepper aftertaste. Super tough to choose a favorite. Pluses and minuses. Slightly different. Both Awesome."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  just an amazingly delicious beer.  Massively drinkable for its size.  Awesome."
""
""
""
"Wow, is all I can say."

"Very good beer. You can taste the cinnamon in the after taste very smooth and delicious"
""
""
""
""
"Truly a unique stout experience.....has made myself a fan of this style."
""
""
""
""
"Big stout share. Huna blew ir away."
"Side-by-side with Hunahpu's and Bomb! this finished second to Hunahpu's."
""
""
""
""
""
"Can't believe the ratings on this beer. It's a very average stout. Far from perfect. Yet again deceived by the hype."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A very nice stout from Perennial, definitely puts the select ingredients in the spotlight. Nice balance and interplay, simple in that there isn't a lot going on beyond those adjuncts, but impressive in how complex they can feel and how nicely they go together."
"Only spicy chile on the nose. Strong taste of vanilla and even more cinnamon with some restrained chile spice at the end... Probably the best beer I've had including Chile (it's often overdone)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I think my overall impression of disspointment is not a result of the beer but not living up the hype.  Also, the competition is pretty stiff in the pepper stout category.  I would love to give this another try and do a head to head with Bomb, Dark Lord, and Hunahpu."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Glad to finally check this off my list.  I'm not a huge fan of the style, and can really appreciate when I encounter an Imperial Stout that is so complex and balance.  This is the best imperial stout I've ever had."
""
"O - A delicious take on a Mexican Stout, and a great beer in its own right.  Compared to Hunahpu (still the gold standard for the style in my mind) the cinnamon and chili notes are bolder, but have slightly less integration."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All in this is a genius beer in both formulation and execution. It deserves its standing as a top of the heap beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The chili spice, sweet vanilla and chocolate and slight bitter finish works so perfectly in the beer.  A must have for stout and big beer lovers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really nice. 1 notch below Huna."
""
"It's a great stout, and I'd love to find bottles around Seattle some day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So many flavors.  Slightly sweet, slightly spicy and ultimately outstanding.  Almost a great meal in a glass.  I can't wait to try this Barrel Aged."
""
"Good but not in the same boat as other stouts in the same category"
""
"Really really really really really good imperial stout...that's all I have to say."
""
"Sort of in the Hunahpus and Xocoveza league but this one falls a bit short of them both for me. Great profile of dark roasted character with all of the fun stuff added."
""
""
""
""
"This is quite possibly one of my favorite beers right now. The chile on the nose is sometimes a little overpowering, but the overall taste is just incredible. Enormous chocolate malt, vanilla, cinnamon and chile provide a crazy, and oddly complementary combination of flavors."
"Holy Cinnamon and Ancho Chiles. Its got a good aftertaste but its pretty strong on the front end. You almost have difficulty swallowing between the ABV, cinnamon and the chiles. Body is great, head is also very nice but it's a little unbalanced on the sip."
""
""
""
""
""
"crazy how accurate the description of what this is brewed with comes out in the nose and taste."
""
""
""
""
"O -  It's a crazy beer.  The chili aspect was a nice curve ball, from the smell/nose and lingering long after I took a drink.   The body/flavors/alcohol compliments each other so well.  I can't wait to try my other bottle in a year or two and see how this beast changes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Strong notes of cinnamon, taste is the same.  Heat from chilis is very subtle.  Really nice balance with the spices.  Very good and well crafted, but not super drinkable for m - 10 oz was more than I needed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Awful! Last years Abraxas was great, but this year's bottle was terrible. No carbonation what so ever, waaaaay to spicy, overly bitter, and just complete crap in evey way. It taste like they threw a bunch of random shit into a brew kettle without measuring and didn't give it any care throughout the brewing process. I want my $20 back."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a damn fine stout that I was surprised and delighted  to find on tap in my neck of the woods.."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An impressive beer, no doubt, but the richness was almost too much of a good thing.  Even so, this is a delicious beer, and one I was happy to try at long last."
""
""
""
""
"May have gotten a bad bottle, didnt impress me at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- Well!!! This was a long time coming and so good!!! This beats out Bomb! The removal makes the flavors pop more and creates more lushness and richness. A bit more vanilla would've been nice. I ain't mad at you Perenial!!"
""
"Top level chili stout..not as much heat as Mexican cake and not as warm/full bodied as huna..but more cinnamon than either..well worth seeking out"
""
"O- My first beer from Perenial and it is a good one!  Wish I had a second bottle, this is a great beer, very well put together."
"On draft at Chuck's 85th.  This is really an exceptional beer.  Pours murky dark with a tan, frothy head which dissipates quickly.  Aroma of vanilla caramel, cocoa, cinnamon, raisin, roasted malt.  Sweet on the tongue, some earthy notes, followed by some fire from the alcohol and peppers.  Very creamy, full-bodied, lightly carbonated, huge and long finish.  Truly a pleasure to drink."
"Earthy, toasted malts and bakers chocolate build the foundation, with sweeter malts on top of them, including molasses, cane sugar, syrup and a hint of dried dark berries. The uprising sweetness gets balanced by creamy milk chocolate, cocoa nibs, cinnamon and spicy, then peppery, burning, herbal chilies. The chocolate qualities get complimented by a noteable amount of bitter coffee, which got a dry note to it. The taste of this beer in general is extremely versatile, it begins silk and creamy, and while it remains throughout smooth, it gets quite a bit heat to it, resulting from the chilies, acting as a convincing counterpoint to the upwelling sweetness, while accentuating the earthy malts and pleasantly bitter coffee. Has a very long finish, beginning right after the chili bite, along with a coffeish bitterness and an earthy note, as well as a toffee glimpse, while the chili burn warms up the belly. Every single flavor is put outstandingly well into this brew, all components unfold on the palate in an enjoyable way, while none dominates the taste on its own."
""
""
"It's a good witches brew"
"So, for me, like Mexican Cake, this is a perfect beer and I have no hesitation in giving it a perfect score. Rich, sweet, spiced stouts hit the absolute heights of my taste preferences, and what beer hits that profile more dead-on than this one? Like a boozy mexican hot chocolate. Spices integrated perfectly. Just the right amount of heat from the peppers. Dreaming of the BBA version. Five stars out of five."

"Abraxas is a beer that I have not been able to get in Colorado but found at a local restaurant on the bottle list.  I was extremely surprised.  I have drank but not rated a lot of stouts before this.  This ranks as one of my favorite ever.   Smooth, rich, creamy and the cocao nibs follow through.  This beer is extremely balanced and a must have for stout lovers if they get a chance."

"O:  This beer is fantastic.  It is a great blend of chilies and cinnamon such that both elements compete against one another, with neither gaining the upper hand.  Definitely worth the praise it gets.  The complexity this beer brings to the table blows other beers out of the water."

"Just returned from Abraxas Day 2014.  Outstanding event.  Abraxas is an outstanding beer.  Cinnamon, Chocolate come through nicely.  I have heard that it fades in time over bottles, but I tasted 2014 next to 2013 (on tap), and 2013's flavors resonated stronger.  Might just have been the recipe and process that year.  Both excellent though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2014 vintage, on-draft at Abraxas Day 2014. Cocoa, brown sugar, molasses. The vegetal character from the peppers is noticeable, but the capsaicin burn is almost non-existent."

"Update: Had a bottle that was accidentally aged a while back and didn't think too highly of it. Getting huge chili pepper skin and cinnamon sticks in the nose. Bitter coffee and dark chocolate, black strap molasses, more chili pepper skin and a decent amount of cinnamon on the finish that makes it super dry. Very minimal, boarding on nonexistent chili heat. This is heads and shoulders better that the aged one I had. Drink fresh.  I would still go with MC > Huna > Abrax.  Much closer though."

"Overall: This beer is very balanced for what it has going on, im guessing this beer fresh might be a little over spiced, id like to have this fresh at some point to see if theres more Chile heat. this beer is great , i will be seeking more in the future."

"Thank you Chadwicktorres for your profound generosity! Pours black with a thick mocha head and good lacing. Good retention. Aroma redolent of chiles, cinnamon, and chocolate. Spicy heat on the front of the tongue from the chiles with notes of sweet cinnamon spice. Rich chocolate follows with hints of roastiness. Full bodied with ample carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel. Overall, an extremely balanced offering from Perennial."

"A beer that changed my life when I first had it. Beautiful balance of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon and chili heat."

"Picked this up from a great trade with Evan! Bottled Nov 2013. An aggressive pour yields a beautiful pitch black body with a quickly fading one finger caramel-colored head with minimal lacing. Rich, roasty, complex nose with lots of cocoa up front along with hints of cinnamon, dark chocolate, vanilla, subtle coconut, and the chilies are surprisingly prevalent as well. The taste is big and rich and just as complex as the nose. Loads of roasty cocoa and cinnamon up front with the chilies not far behind. Hints of chocolate fudge, coconut, vanilla, tobacco, and espresso. The mouthfeel is rich and flavorful, thick and creamy, with perfect carbonation and excellent balance. Overall, this was a hugely enjoyable beer and not far behind the barrel-aged version. The cinnamon, cocoa, and chilies were bold, yet equally represented and this was extremely drinkable for a 10% ABV beer. Highly recommended!"

"Sorry, guys. I had this several days ago at a tasting and was so excited I didn't take all notes. Suffice it to say, abraxas is one of the best beers I've ever had. Warm, complex, syrupy stout goodness. Had slightly chilled and room temperature and cannot say anything bad. In fact, I think the beer got better with warmth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I remiss, onto the beer: Rich chocolate and spice aromas on the nose; brown head. Taste also is in waves of rich chocolate, spices and rich dark malt character. Sweet, slightly spicy, reminds me a bit of autumn. A bit bitter mostly from chocolate and possibly from hops, residual and up front. Finishes smooth almost like sweet chocolate milk. Cannot wait to try this again, hopefully even a barrel aged variant."

"Just a real treat and pleasure to drink this one, it's so decadent and complex."

"I first had this and the Abyss around the same time, and while both give you a lot of coffee at the beginning, the other components of Abraxas were what made me come back and give Abraxas a second shot. Excellent, and right up there with BCBCS as the best coffee-forward stouts I've ever had."

"O: As I mentioned, it's like drinking a cookie. Quite sweet, which can get overwhelming as you get further into the bottle. Good complexity of flavor, not as much chili pepper as others I've had. Definitely a bottle you want someone to share with. Someday I hope to the opportunity to try the BA version."
"Bottle from a generous trader. Bottled 11/2013. Pours incredibly thick pitch black with a big dark brown head. Aroma of massive chocolates, a hint of spicy pepper, and a bit of cinnamon. Really nice. Flavor is super sweet chocolate, light roast, a bit of cinnamon dryness, with a lingering dry cocoa powder and light chile flavor left on the palate. The heat picks up a tad as I sip and the cinnamon definitely comes out as it warms. Thick bodied with low carbonation, but not as thick as I was expecting after watching the pour. Pretty good stuff with both sweet chocolate and bitter roast shining through here. Hoping to find the BA version someday."

"The beer is black and viscous with an oily beige collar. Aromas of heavy cinnamon with some peppery heat. Vanilla and chocolate are there as well, but in the background a bit. Really nice flavor, with cinnamon leading the way. Rich, roasted malt with hints of coffee. Thick body with a delicate sweetness throughout. While Hunahpu's still reigns supreme, in my opinion, Abraxas is certainly a delicious and well crafted beer well worth seeking out."

"Overall. Meh... It's a good stout. Not great, but it didn't really dissapoint"
"Much more balance between the adjuncts this year. Slightly more pepper taste on the finish. Great balance between the chocolate cinnamon vanilla. Better than 2012 and 2013. Definitely my favorite year thus far"

"On tap at Hops and Pie, I was glad to get to try this for significantly less than the $20 that bottles are (over)priced at around here. Dark black, tan head, looks good. Aroma is cinnamon and the slightest hint of pepper. Flavor seemed heavier on the cinnamon with discernible vanilla, not much pepper on the flavor. My friend said it reminded her of cinnamon life cereal. I liked this beer but I could never pay $20 for a 750, more like $10."

"$18 for 750 ml bottle"
""
"Overall, expertly crafted over at Perrenial. Love the milk chocolatey base flavor all the others play off of. Even though there was no vanilla brewed into this you get major vanilla notes which I really enjoy. A dessert beer, and one that should definitely be shared as I think a 750 will be hard to manage by myself! Would love to try the coffee version."

"O: very good, if a little on the sweet side.  My initial tastes made me think of Imperial Biscotti Break, but not quite to that standard. I'm interested in the feel, more as an intriguing point than a purely satisfying point."

"Such a good Imperial Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall this is an incredibly enjoyable beer. This beer tastes distinctively different than alot of other imperial stouts. While a lot of other breweries try to spice their imperial stouts with different things, it either A: doesn't work, or B:gets lost behind the chocolate and coffee tastes that are normally prevalent in imperial stouts, or C: is overpowering with one individual spice. But this beer does not fall into those categories. It is complex yet enjoyable. The ancho chili peppers, cinnamon sticks, and cacao nibs are very prevalent but enjoyable. This beer is a success in its uniqueness"
""
""
"A very balanced brew that stands in behind Mexican Cake and ahead of Hunahpu in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Superb and delicious. Can't wait to have again."
"Poured a dark brown, almost black body with one finger dark brown head (so I guess the body is black since I differentiate) that left lace patches and had an aroma of sweetness like chocolate and toffee, maybe caramel, hint of cinnamon, and some roasted, bready malts as well as coffee and chile (although I may pick these up more b/c others say they are in there than on my own without prior knowledge). A thick, almost chewey body that is sticky at times but so easy to drink and so calling for me to drink it. Great balance as I get a lot of chocolate and touches of cinnamon (and I still think toffee or caramel) with a very dry, coffee-esque malt base. Picks up on the end with a little heat so I'm assuming both the alcohol and chile are coming in and thankfully not overpowering me at all. A very enjoyable sipper and another great beer from Perennial."

"as close to perfect beer as you can really get. brilliant stuff. close to black in color, thick looking, and no light coming in at all. a smallish but persistent mocha colored head rests on top. intimidating yet enticing. the nose on this is one of a kind, best use of cinnamon i have ever seen in a beer, its warming and present more in the nose than the taste. cocoa nibs gives it a rich bitterness fully compatible with the heavy dark malt and coffee like bitterness. the chilies give it a little layer of smoky spice, but im not getting heat here. the alcohol is also expertly well hidden. bakers chocolate and earthy charred barley are the first things i taste, but a sweeter chocolate and ancho pepper hit are right behind. the complexity is only beginning to unfold here. layers of dark grain, cocoa powder dryness, back of throat heat, and warming booze all crescendo into a mild cinnamon finish that fades much faster than it sounds like it would. no alcohol, sugar, or heat left on the palate, just a touch of cinnamon and cocoa. its fantastically well made beer worth all of the hype. full body and carbonated just enough, who knew this was all possible in a stout? certainly one of the best beers ive ever had, and one i will remember fondly until my next one. all of perennials beers are awesome, but this one stands out. positively elite brew."

"Dark black body with a reddish brown head with bubbles that remain throughout as well as great lacing on the glass. The smell is complex but I don't get all of the flavors. I get a bit of chocolate and just an overall spice note. The taste is wonderful. The cinnamon shines and the ancho just kicks in right behind it. It never gets spicy though. This beer tastes like an incredible Mexican hot chocolate. The mouthfeel is in perfect harmony with this beer. Thick but not even close to motor oil consistency. It has a nice chew to it to complement all of the flavors that mesh so well together. Easy winner over Bomb! and Hunahpu."
""
""
""
""
""
"The depth alone makes this a beer worth seeking out. I've always been a sucker for the Mexican style stouts and Abraxas is no exception. The ancho works well with cocoa, vanilla, and cinnamon for an alcoholic, dense Mexican style hot chocolate of sorts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I will remember this as an extremely rich full bodied beer that is dominated by cinnamon. The chili peppers are quite muted in terms of heat but make this beer what it is."
""
"O: Very impressive mix of flavors. The texture is brilliant, but the complexity of the flavors is just really well done. Part of me wishes for a little more roast, thinking it could back off the sweetness a bit, but I think letting the chiles and cinnamon do that is just fine. Glad a snagged a bottle. Head and shoulders the best Perennial I've tried. Now if I could only snag the barrel aged..."

"Overall, this is just a top-notch offering from Perennial. Outstanding and unique as a fresh beer, and wonderfully age-able as well. I've not had many different beers from this ""Spiced Imperial Stout"" sub-style that has been popular, but this one is fantastic. Now I just need to get my hands on the BA version..."

"I love this beer. I remember liking Hunapu's more but I would like to have them side by side. Both phenomenal. Cheers!"
""
"Overall, very interesting with a lot going on. Everything doesn't blend real well - the chocolate is a bit too sweet, the roast is a bit too bitter, the black licorice is a bit strong. It would be interesting to try this aged to see if it mellows some. It is a bit pricey at $22 a bottle."

"Overall, this is a great beer on tap. It was served on the cold side, but as it warms, it really develops. Complex and delicious, with the vanilla and ancho flavors being really unique."
""
"Basically this is what I remember it being when the 2012 bottling was about 6 months old. So much cinnamon that comes out even more as the beer gets warmer. I would definitely recommend drinking this at closer to cellar or room temperature rather than chilled. The chili peppers are there in a slightly vegetal manner, with some spiciness on the back end- not a lot like Mexican Cake, but just enough to complement the base imperial stout and the cinnamon. This is easily my favorite Mexican style stout by far, having had Hunahpu and Mexican Cake already. And I will definitely attest to the fact that BA Abraxas is just that much better- just add in a lot of vanilla bourbon marshmallows to this and that's what you got."
""
""
""
"D - I can see why this is a great base for a barrel treatment. It's pretty similar to Hunahpu's but doesn't have anywhere near the same heftyness to it."

"Pours black color with a quickly fading khaki head. Dark Chocolate, chilies, cinnamon, wood, and some vanilla notes dominate the nose. The flavor profile matches the nose with the dark chocolate most noticeable and a nice lingering burn from the chilies and spices on the finish. Cinnamon and spices become more noticeable as it warms up. This beer reminds me so much of Cigar City’s most sought after Hunaphu beers which is why I enjoyed this beer!"

"O - This drinks very easily for 10%. Almost no carbonation so it goes down quick. I could see myself drinking a bottle of this for either breakfast or dessert, really tasty"
"either way an excellent drink and would definite get again"
""
""
""
"O- I have had BA a few times over, dunno why it took me awhile to rate this. Grab it if you can, a great beer. Huna>Mexi Cake>Abraxas>Space Ghost>Copper Kettle Mexican Chocolate Stout. Try them all"

"M: Full bodied."

"The beer pours jet black with a thin dark tan was that fizzles into a thin halo with little lacing (slightly oily residue) and no sediment. The nose is marshmallow-vanilla, chilies, and some bitter cocoa on the back end. It's not potently aromatic, but all the different notes come through in time. The taste is sweet and marshmallowy upfront, but there is much more distinct cocoa compared to the nose. It's full bodied, lightly carbonated, has rich and distinct flavors, masked alcohol, and a slight heat from the chilies in the finish. This is a fantastic stout, with a rich, full body, bold adjuncts, and seductive drinkability"

"A really interesting stout, with some fabulous things going on in the smell. Unfortunately, they're mostly overpowered in the taste by a few dominant characteristics. But all around, it's really good, and quite different from most big stouts I've had (save the Deschutes BB anniversary series I already mentioned)."

"Overall, I was incredibly disappointed with this beer. It seems this has to do with my palate as opposed to getting a bad bottle, as the other tasting group members all really enjoyed it. I couldn't even finish my 4 oz taster of this. I did really enjoy Hunahpu, so I'm not sure why Abraxas didn't work for me, but it's not a beer I would seek to drink again."
"I haven't been a fan of a lot of Perennial's beers and in fact, I feel they're a bit over-rated overall. However, Abraxas is a revelation. The flavor has great balance and complexity, the feel is incredible, and the look and nose are spot on. I wish I'd picked up a lot more of these when I had the chance."

"This one exceeded all of my hopes and expectations by so far. It definitely lives up to the hype it recieves and is worth trying hard to seek out. Could be a candidate for my favorite imperial stout. I loved it!"
"Overall: Really nice and complex flavors though the cinnamon is a bit too strong in the finish; still, a keeper"
""
""

""
""
""
""
"o - Overall I was very excited for this one and I liked it a lot. I think the nose is amazing and complex, and it looks and feels great. The taste is good, though the weak point of the beer for me, as it has a lot of peppers to it. Not a spicy chili pepper taste, but more an earthy bell pepper taste. I would see how a bourbon barrel would mute the peppers and make a very good stout into a world class stout. Would love to get a bottle of the BA version."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This was one of the most enjoyable spiced imperial stouts I've had. I would love to try it next to a bottle of Hunaphu because that might be the only one that can hold a candle to Abraxas (barrel aged stouts aside...)"
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""

"O: A fantastic imperial stout that is almost as good as Huna. Perhaps the BA version of this thickens the mouthfeels and tones down the carbonation. I imagine with that, plus perhaps some barrel, vanilla, oak, and bourbon notes, this could be one of the best beers ever. Definitely would want to try the BA version of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Side note, I'm part Thai, so I can't feel the heat of chili as much.. it came off mild to me, so in my tastes, it's nicely balanced."
""
""
"O: Good. I do prefer the BA version better because it seemed to hide the chiles a but more"
""
"Very well balanced and well made beer. Good complexity throughout. I feel if I did not immediately contrast this with the deliciousness of the BA version, I may score it even higher."
""
"The Mexican inspired stout would make the Aztecs proud- as this beer has certainly earned respect among the best that today's craft beer world offers. The beer is meticulously balanced and doesn't shy away from powerful complexities in addition. It's beautiful in its recipe design, brewer execution, and courage."
""
""
"Similar to Hunahpu or Westbrook Mexican Cake or even Clown Shoes Chocolate Sombrero but with it's own flair. Based on other reviews it seems that the ancho peppers have faded quite a bit in 16 months. Kind of a shame but I'll take the trade off in the form of this smooth cinnamon fudge treat. I'll be on the lookout for some of the 2013 batch later this year to have a go at a fresh one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Although the spicing and base beer seem to have the potential to be really good together, the pepper flavors are throwing the beer off. I think the barrel-aged version is far superior, in part because the pepper flavor seems more subdued."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sometimes extreme beers come off as a desperate plea for help: not so here. This is a genuine work of art, with a great combo of flavors that just beg to be devoured as quickly as possible. I can't think of one reason why this isn't an elite level beer - simply excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This was excellent. My only complaint is that there was a little too much heat which became a touch distracting and also overpowered the cinnamon a little bit."
""
""
""
""
""
"What better beer to pair with some different varieties of bacon than a peppered stout? This stuff pours a straight onyx topped by over a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises earthy peppers, cocoa, roasted malts, and apple cider spices. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some brown sugar and cinnamon and a healthier roast. The peppers provide a steadily increasing, though always mild, heat in the back of the throat. Basically things boil down to this: cocoa-centric mole goodness! The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a damn fine pepper stout, easily superior to the ever-vaunted Hunahpu."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- An excellent chile stout, has some really delicious chocolate flavors as well as great use of chiles and cinnamon, a must-try."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall, this is great. Very reminiscent of Hunahpu's, but just different enough that it works. The chili is more pronounced, and it actually has some heat behind it which I don't recall with Hunahpu. I'm definitely going to pick up some more of these, despite the higher price tag. Going to need to land me a BA one as well, though I'll have to give up a kidney or something."
"Overall: Flat out phenomenal. Chile stouts are one of those styles that I absolutely love trying but am often disappointed with. They either have too much spice, too little spice, too little stout character, etc. This one nails every aspect."
""
""
""
"O: One of the most interesting beers I've had the opportunity to try. The advertised chocolate, cinnamon, and chili are all very easy to pick up on and meld well together. A great take on the style."
""
"Abraxas pours dark and rich as you would expect with a great bronze head. Once poured one can immediately start sniffing hints of vanilla bean and cocoa nibs. The taste is complex. I like to think of the taste of this beer like going to a Yonder Mountain String Band concert. The band plays together beautifully, but when each band member has a chance to solo you can really hear each component. The same is true for Abraxas. A taste of Abraxas develops in stages. At first it is a chocolate but as it warms up you experience more vanilla/espresso taste, but cold/warm it finishes with a chili spice and cinnamon perfection."
"Just an awesome beer and one where I need to try to find another bottle… ISO to be posted soon. For me this was very special… Alex thanks so much for sending. Xenon, happy to share it with you."
""
"9.0/10"
"A heavy name for a heavy beer. Sometimes beer can be so serious and deep that you can get lost as it unfolds with each sip. Complexity meets drinkability with a dull warning of strength. It is beers of this character that further forge what American beer is and represent the intentions of craft brewers. Search this beauty out."

"Pours dark black with a quickly fading brown head. Dark Chocolate, chilies, cinnamon dominate the nose. Taste matches the nose with the dark chocolate most noticeable and a nice lingering burn from the chilies and spices on the finish. Cinnamon and spices become more noticeable as it warms up. Nice thick and creamy mouth feel. Excellent beer!"
""
""
"O: This is how a chili chocolate stout should taste like. This blows Hunahpu's out of the water IMO and I'm not afraid to say it. Perennial killed it on this last batch."
""
""
"Full body, well carbonated, chewy and creamy on the tongue. I LOVE the idea of chiles and spice in beers, but rarely are they ever executed this well. Next to Hunahpu's, this is one of my favorite non-barrel aged stouts of all time."
"O- A really well put together beer. Super integrated, complex and delicious"
""
""
"Had this on tap at Blind Tiger in NYC. Pours jet black with a trace of bubbles for a head. First sip you notice the heavy cinnamon, then the cocoa nibs, then the chili aftertaste. They sure aren't lying, you can taste all that crazy stuff in there. Its a very good beer, but I had a hard time finishing an 8 ounce glass of it because of all the other stuff thrown in there. Not exactly my style of beer, but definitely an experience."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is an amazing beer. Glad 44 Stone had it on tap because I've yet to see a bottle of it in town."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- just a fantastic beer! This is a Melange a Quatre of chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon and chile peppers that works perfectly together. Steep price tag but a must try for sure."
""
""
"Big Thanks to Andrew for this!"
"Overall: complex, great chocolate presence with spicey notes that make this unique and very memorable. Excellent beer, glad I was here for the release."
""

""
"What a great stout. This combination of flavors is just excellent, and I think I'd like it almost no matter who did it, or how. Hunahpu's is still king, but this is a damn fine alternative."
""
""
""
"Poured into Allagash glass. Pours obsidan black with dark brown head. Two fingers of head upon pour, a collar retains nicely, minimal lacing. Aroma is heavy on dark bitter chocolate, cacao, licorice, molasses, and roasted malts. A touch of pepper is present on the nose in the background. The taste is incredibly dry and full of cacao. This features that raw chocolate flavor which makes for a very robust and deep flavor. This pairs nicely with the thick stout base. Notes of licorice and cinnamon come through in the middle and cayenne makes an appearance at the end. The heat is minimal and builds slowly as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is thick and sturdy with moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a tasty, full flavored, and rich beer. Definitely worth a try. Hunahpu's is still the king in this combo of flavors though."
""
""
""
"O- This was definitely an interesting beer. I wouldn't say I completely liked the taste but it was definitely an interesting try that I enjoyed having. I would have definitely toned down the cinnamon a little bit, I found that to be a tiny bit off putting but not bad. I'd recommend trying this if you like unique stouts."
""
""
"Black in color and almost flat. The aroma is almost herbal. Very much spicy, but it has an almost ginger aroma to it, though the chili peppers and cinnamon are there. Lots of licorice and roasted malt, too. The flavor is quite a bit sweeter than expected. Licorice, molasses, and burnt sugar to go with a bit of chocolate. The same chili character with a dash of cinnamon. Certainly an intensely flavored beer."
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This is quite good. The adjuncts are definitely there with the chocolate taking the lead, and nothing dominates or is out of place. This reminds me of a more mellow Hunahpu; perhaps a bottle with a couple years on it. The nose could be a little bolder and adjuncts could be a touch bigger still, but overall, this was excellent. Thanks again for the beers man. I really enjoyed this one."
"Wedding tick: New tick #1 for the week. This beer pours a full bodied midnight black in color with a beautiful, creamy dark mocha head. It looks perfect! The nose is rich and malty. There is a lot of cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg spice in the nose with dark chocolate, bitter coffee roast, and slight fresh, green (in terms of maturity) pepper. The nose changes as time goes on, making this one very complex and more enjoyable as you proceed. The flavors are big and full of bitter dark chocolate and coffee roast. There is also plenty of spice presence, cinnamon and nutmeg. There is also some freshly cut pepper in the finish but it is somewhat subdued (on purpose I would imagine, to satisfy more people). It has nice flavor and all of the ingredients work in unison. It drinks full in body and coats your palate. It's a nice beer and well worth the $19 or so per bottle. This is the closest thing I've seen to Hunahpu yet and perhaps better than current batches."
"Coming from Tampa, FL, the land of Hunahpu, it'll be interesting to see another brewery's taste on the formula. This beer pours out deep black with two fingers of thick, mocha head. The aroma is more heavy on the cinnamon and chocolate than the roast, with a surprising amount of smoked character to it as well. Some of this might come from the Ancho chilis, which don't have a high level of heat, but plenty of spicy flavor. The taste is pretty heavily spiced with the cinnamon and the flavors of the chili. The chili really dominates this beer without contributing much heat at all. There's some roast, coffee, and vanilla in here for sure too, especially in the beginning. The mouthfeel isn't really that heavy, and it goes down fairly slickly. Some more heft on the body wouldn't hurt, but the heavy chili flavor excuses some of it. The drinkability is actually quite good. Overall, it's a good chili imperial stout. Come in expecting chili flavors without the heat, and you'll be happy."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is probably the best beer out of St Louis. Im not sure how limited this supply is but if you can get it do it! I was lucky to get a few bottles. One down and going to try and age the other. I highly doubt it makes it past next week. Its way to good right now to wait."
""
"Oh yeah, that's tasty. Rich notes of bitter dark chocolate coat the palate, followed swiftly by mocha and coffee roast. Ancho chilies add a decadent heat to the sides of the tongue that compliment the mild boozy warmth in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-thick with a creamy carbonation level that's spot-on for the style. Chewy in all the right spots, and just a tad sticky with residual sugars in the finish. Overall, an excellent imperial stout. A slow-sipper, for sure, but decadence with every nip."
""
"O: Really integrated and impressive. Not too spicy but rather the chili compliments the complex flavors. Thanks again Mr. Clean!"
"This is a fantastic representation of the style and a flat out great beer. The pricepoint is high at $20, but that seems to be the direction limited releases are going. This one at least delivers and I'm looking forward to trying more of Perennial's beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed this beer. That being said, due to the price point, plus having to trade/ship to obtain it, not sure how soon it will be until I have it again."
""
""
""
"Overall this reminds me a lot of a Cigar City Hunahpu Lite. Not as intense by any means in any of the flavor aspects that both beers share, but all are present and created a much more balanced beer overall. The wow factor isn't there like with Hunahpu but a really solid beer overall; not sure it's worth the almost $20 outlay but it more accessible than Hunahpu which counts for something."
"Overall: I thought this to be a exceptional example of the style. All the ingredients were well integrated and well balanced. Glad I still have batch 1 in my cellar."
""
"Bittersweet dark chocolate intertwines subtly with mellow cinnamon spice and a vague dark fruit component from the anchos at room temp. Very smooth and chocolaty, the foam itself has a chocolate milkshake consistency. Medium bodied and especially drinkable for an Imperial Stout."
""
"Edit: I think the spices were ""turned down"" because of the age on this bottle (being batch #1). I haven't had a batch #2 yet, so I can't comment on the spices in there."
""
"A unique, delicious, and complex Impy stout from Perennial."
"D - This was really good for 4-6oz, but I can imagine it getting fatiguing after that point. Still, it's quite well done and I would happily try it again. Best beer I've had from Perennial."
""
"overall it was a tasty little treat, complexed and the spice in it was great not overpowering but let it's precense be known"
"A unique and incredibly flavorful, evolving stout."
"Overall Impression- A nice 2X Stout and one of my favorites now from Perennial Ales! I'm glad the St. Louis beer community has grown so much in the past year to be able to enjoy nice ones such as these. The only part of this brew I didn't enjoy was the gritty finish... Would like to age one of these and see how it grows this next year!"
""
"Pours an opaque black with a khaki head that fades to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form all over the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt, cocoa, cinnamon, and chile. Taste is of dark roasted malt, cinnamon, chile, cocoa, and slight coffee beans. A medium roasty bitterness lingers on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an awesome stout with some awesome aromas and flavors."
""
""
"This brew is delicious. Its definitely very creative and has some complex and interesting notes but it is very well crafted."
"D - solid effort by the folks at Perennial. The price is a little steep, but I went out and bought a bottle after having it on tap. I look forward to trying it again. Recommended!"
"Overall: Kick ass brew. There were a lot of highlights this evening but this one was my favorite. I'm left wanting just a bit more body and a little bigger nose. Its probably tricky considering that a bigger nose might make the spice in the mouth a bit too large. Highly recommend this one. If he perfects it, it could win awards I bet."
"O - Overall, a very enjoyable imperial stout. A little pricey at $19 for a 750, but I have a couple more bottles in the basement and am excited to see how it develops over time. I'm also looking forward to trying some of the other offerings from Perennial."
"O: Can't wait to drink again, but not too much as it was $19 a 750ml plus shipping."
""
"Overall – A pleasant surprise! Good mesh of flavors, though I wish there was more chile heat. Great effort, definitely worth trying, and I look forward to trying more from Perennial."
"Not amazing but not bad. Good beer to have. Miss this brewer. Guess ill trade for others."
"I really enjoyed my first beer from Perennial. It's no fresh Hunaphu but it's still enjoyable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an amazing beer that I highly recommend either driving to St Louis for or looking for people to trade with for their 750ml bottles. It's sure to be an highly anticipated annual release from one of St Louis' newest breweries."
