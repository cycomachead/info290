4.54,7.6,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Pours a  deep chocolate brown color not wanting to let any light through. Head is tan and a light chocolate milk color and is plentiful and bubbly. Lacing coats the glass thickly. First hit of aroma is of chocolate milk, milk chocolate and a hint of coffee. Taste is similar at first with a creamy milk chocolate flavor hitting and coating the tongue first, then comes some bittersweet chocolate to balance things out. There is a bittersweet chocolate finish as the flavor goes through the chocolate flavor wheel in just the first sip. Mouthfeel is nice, coats the tongue at first and then bites at it a little and finished pretty clean with just enough chocolate flavor left to make you want more. This is a great Chocolate stout !!","hophugger","Mar 15, 2015"

Flavor is chocolate and oatmeal on the palate, followed by roasted malt and dark fruit.  Finish is refreshingly bitter - like bittersweet chocolate.  Body is medium-full with more carbonation than I expected.   Overall, a very enjoyable beer with the rich chocolate flavor balanced by the bitter hops.","mr-jj","Mar 13, 2015"

Double chocolate makes me think of sweet sweet candy from an Easter basket, this is not that. I had a milk and cookie stout once. Did not taste anything like milk or cookies. Oatmeal stout, where do I begin... Any how this has a nice pour, deep dark look, giant foam head that lasts longer than my first marriage. The bottle is nice. A plain red , nothing fancy. Clearly they wanted more attention paid to what is inside. I'm making dinner tonight while drinking this. A nice thin ribeye sat atop sweet potato fries with blue cheese , with a nice balsamic glaze.  Doesn't that sound nice? Maybe I'm really just eating boiled cabbage. See just like an f'n stout label you have no clue what's real..","weirdohappy","Sep 17, 2014"

Nose of dark bakers chocolate and fresh black coffee like a fine black Bavarian chocolate cake. Taste is much like the nose, chocolate up front with roasted dark grains and a light coffee taste to the background. SOLID offering. Moderate carbonation and creamy mouthfeel round this beast of a brew out with a nice alcohol kick that is so well hidden it is not detectable till after the glass is done. NICE.

Not too sweet but just a nice decent amount of sweetness. The bitterness is very mild. Overall, a typical chocolate stout but a bit of a letdown with the marketing.","Richardbeerlover","Jul 05, 2014"

Aroma is dominated by dark chocolate, bordering on Hershey's chocolate syrup from when I was a kid (I guess there is some milk/lactose or something in there). Not bready but sticky and chewy, full-bodied, wouldn't characterize this beer as chocolate milk with booze added to it but this is definitely a sweet beer that also has a husky, dry bitter chocolate, roasted even, malt presence to balance the beer and give it a dry, warming edge.","clayrock81","Apr 04, 2014"

4,-5.2,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark tan head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, vanilla, fudge, oats, light roast, chocolate syrup, floral, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and chocolate notes; with good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, vanilla, fudge, light roast, oats, chocolate syrup, floral, and roasted earthiness. Light amount of earthy hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, vanilla, fudge, light roast, oats, chocolate syrup, floral, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and chocolate syrup flavors; with a fair amount of hop bitterness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial chocolate stout. All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and chocolate flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 18, 2013"

There's also a good amount of lacing. The aroma is very nice, the brew smells mostly like milk chocolate and malted milk balls, along with some roasted malt and vanilla. It tastes like milk and bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt, coffee and vanilla. Nice mix of both sweet and bitter chocolate flavors. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and coating with moderate carbonation. Rogue does a great job with their stouts, and this one is no different. It's a good brew, definitely worth trying, especially if you've never had it before. $11.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Aug 30, 2013"

4.22,0,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.25,"Poured into 2 pub glasses, this was a treat for my girlfriend. Pacman yeast lends a hand to the mouthfeel of this sweet dessert stout, which sets Rogue ales apart from the rest. Obvious chocolate flavor that unfolds in stages. Chocolate syrup up front rolls into a very rich fudge brownie flavor. A good whiff of alcohol too, but it comes off like a chocolate liqueur. There's also some honey flavor in there, and the malt is almost totally subsumed by chocolate. Aside from drinking, this would be great for baking. It's mighty sweet, but light bodied enough to enjoy a big glass.","PincheNorteno","Jun 08, 2013"

It reminds me of hot chocolate mix or nesquik or something. nice roast, more bitter than sweet on the chocolate in nose and taste. the flavor is really chocolate forward, like a higher end organic dark chocolate bar. its really lovely, especially because its all that flavor with out the sweetness. the feel is velvety smooth, super soft, creamy, and light for the color, although it is full bodied. carbonation is also a lot like a nitro beer, airy and livening. what I like most about this beer is its chocolate intensity without being sugary at all. I think its every bit as good as the regular chocolate stout, and a pretty good bang for your buck. not to be ignored! take it from me.","StonedTrippin","Jun 01, 2013"

The ""brewed with natural flavors"" tagline was also a little disconcerting as this is usually marketing lingo for ""brewed with natural-tasting flavors"". In fact this beer is brewed with real ingredients, no shortcuts taken. I also admit that I was biased against Rogue since none of their beers had wow'ed me. So I tried this one attempting to keep an open mind. Fortunately I had the opportunity to taste this back to back with another great chocolate stout, which is in fact a porter, called Mogli by Cascade. These two beers are very similar. Pours very thick with a tan head leaving rings of lacing, slightly thicker than Cascade's Choco Porter. The smell is KAPOW! chocolate! It's not even subtle. The flavor is deliciously sweet milk chocolate balanced by notes dried fruit and hops on the finish. Also some alcohol heat on the finish. My bottle says 9%, not 8% according to BA. Fully bodied and silky smooth. Not as oily as the Mogli but at the same time not quite as punchy on the hops. I love this style and recommend it without reservation.","Kevin73","Feb 03, 2013"

The taste is much the same. Very strong cocoa taste over whelms the base chocolate malt that is noticable once the cocoa goes away. Mouthfeel is medium, standard for the style.

Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and chocolate syrup. Taste is much the same with a slight tartness in the flavor. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice aromas and flavors.","UCLABrewN84","Nov 29, 2012"

Not much head or anything - not one you'd expect to be that creamy out of the bottle - but the feel definitely comes through. It's a tasty, smooth beer. Not too strong, but strong enough. It's easy to see how this is a double of their classic Chocolate Stout, and I think I give this one the edge.

4.27,1.2,4.5,5,4,4,4,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a Founders Reserve Snifter the brew is near black in color with a brown/mocha head that appears thick but quickly morphs into just a tiny bit of head floating on the surface. The smell is all Chocolate with just a touch of coffee and it smells as if it would be sweet chocolate and the overall taste reflects this sweetness though not coyingly so. The taste is Chocolate of different varieties...Hershey bar, bittersweet, mocha with a nougat center with a touch of spice. The taste doesn't quite match the nose of this one which is a real downer for me. On the tongue there is some bitterness at the end and a smooth but not chewy mouthfeel. Overall this is a very solid brew. If the taste of this one matched the nose it would be all one could ask for in a chocolate stout. For my taste I would rather have Rogue's regular Chocolate stout but I am glad I had the opportunity to try this one.","Nuke77","Dec 01, 2011"

Pours a jet black with but the slightest mocha head that fizzles away and leaves but a thinly veiled layer floating atop the rest of the beer. The nose on this is simply unreal. This smells straight up like a chocolate bar...and not bakers chocolate either. This has a wonderfully sweet bouquet that's just...all chocolate. The taste is over the top on the chocolate side of things. This is one crazy sweet beer. The chocolate melds with a skosh of vanilla and a faint hint of cinnamon. The mouthfeel is real smooth. This has a pretty effervescent quality to it. It's not the thinnest stout I've had, and certainly not the thickest. This leaves a pretty bitter aftertaste on the back of your tongue that lingers for quite a while after each sip. Overall, this is one damn fine beer. I'll certainly look out for more of this in the future.","Retail1LO","Dec 01, 2011"

Opaque black color, very dark brown edges when held to the light, the head was absent, probably just due to the pour. I went in for a sip, but first got hit with an unmistakable aroma of rich chocolate milk. Taste of rich chocolate, Hershey bars, and...more chocolate. A subtle earthiness near the finish, with some roast coming through, but mostly just a one-dimensional big chocolate bomb, and in some cases--like this--that is not a bad thing. Smooth, full-bodied, lusciously drinkable.","Rifugium","Nov 11, 2011"
3.95,-6.4,4,4,4,3.5,4," The flavor is much like the aroma there is a mild cocoa taste which has slight bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt with light bitter hop accent which also augments the slight roasted malt and mild alcohol flavor. The beer is heavy on the cocoa and chocolate malt which pretty much overwhelms the rest of the taste after half the pint is finished. I enjoy the mild yeast fruitiness and light roast in the finish. Overall a pretty intense stout, not necessarily too sweet for a cocoa beer, the mild fruity and roasted finish are good which means you don't have too much cloying sweetness and the alcohol is pretty restrained for an 8% beer. I would order this again if I see it on tap.","Slatetank","Beers"

4.13,-2.1,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Poured from the tap a dark ominous black with a trace of a tan head that stuck to the side of the tulip glass. Smell was heavy with chocolate and liqourice and roasted grain with a hint of alchohol hding behind the grain. Taste was bold coffee and chocolate with a finish of warming alchohol but a nice clean taste of the roasted grain. Alchohol is there but does not dominate the palate and just hides behind the bulk of this beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and dense, not heavy but very nice beer to sip on and leave on the palate. Overall a very nice beer I had this with a plate of jambalay and it really held its ground against the spice of the food and in my opinion comlimented the food well. Nothing like some cajun on a cold day with a great stout. I will definately be trying this beer again.","rpardon7","Sep 15, 2011"

Compared to other chocolate stouts, this one has more of a milk chocolate taste, but its not over-done like some. A bit pricey (I paid $11.75 for the bomber bottle).

The smell of the beer had a good amount of chocolate on the nose and some roasted malts also. The taste reminded me of something along the lines of chocolate milk or hot cocoa. The flavors were very creamy and chocolatey. Not quite as much as Southern Tier's Choklat though. The mouthfeel was smooth and had a decent body to it. Not as thick as I was hoping for.

The beer has initial flavors completely chocolate, but a blend of milk and bittersweet, with bits of dark chocolate, too. There is a foundation of bitter that all of the sweet flavors are able to springboard from. The beer has flavors typical of a dry stout, but the body of a milk or cream stout. The beer is round and large in your mouth, and it completely deserves to be. The flavors are so well blended, yet they transition to a light and creamy finish, with a slight bitter chocolate aftertaste. Unbelievably creamy and flavorful.

I got both milk and more bitter dark chocolate along with a bit of roasted malt. Taste adds a touch of creamy sweetness alongside a tongue smack of chocolate indulgence. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy. Not too alcoholic and certainly not cloying. This sits really well and goes down easy, though I'd say that 8oz or so would be enough.","Thorpe429","Sep 27, 2010"

It's slightly sweet and slightly bitter and it all seems to come from the chocolate. There's a possible hint of licorice and coffee. I'm a big fan of their regular Chocolate Stout and this is just more of a good thing.","yesyouam","Sep 25, 2010"

Comes in a beautiful bright red painted 750ml bottle, which I poured out into two tall glasses. Rich chocolate aromas were immediately detectable. The beer poured with a thick, creamy, light brown head and a blackish brown body with medium carbonation. Excellent taste, easily my favorite chocolate stout, very dark and sweet and almost thick tasting. Definitely a dessert beer, and definitely worth trying if you can get your hands on some.","msmezher","Sep 17, 2010"

4.14,-1.9,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"The Rogue Double Chocolate Stout pours a pitch black in the glass with a thick chocolate mousse like head, pretty good retention, but no real lacing to talk about. On the nose are pronounced aromas of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, chocolate truffle, chocolate cake...needless to say, there is a lot of chocolate. Besides chocolate, I get raisin, roasted hazelnuts, espresso, & cognac. Everything that I got on the nose, I get on the palate with a full & rich texture, full body, & long finish. Unfortunately, there is a definite alcohol presence. Overall, this is a solid beer, but I like the regular Chocolate stout a little better. (more balance, less booze, & half the price) Again, this is a good beer & worth trying at least once. Recommended if you're looking to try something new, but if you're strapped for cash....go with the regular chocolate stout instead.","BevMoAndrew","Sep 08, 2010"

4.12,-2.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Reviewed from my notes. The double chocolate has a dark brown liquid body and a soapy brown head. It smells like a Hershey bar, sweet and rich. The taste has less chocolate than I found in the aroma. I can taste roasted malts at first. Creamy, but subtle chocolate comes. BItterness, but not at the level of some dark chocolates, comes in at the finish and lingers. The beer is full bodies. The carbonation feels like it is made up of big bubbles. It feels creamy in mouth at first, but the aftertaste is a bit powdery. This beer is pretty drinkable, but some will find it a bit strong. If you are looking for a beer with more kick than a Young's chocolate stout, this may be the drink for you. I wouldn't have more than one or two in an evening. It would make a great dessert beer.","ToasterChef","Sep 03, 2010"

4.14,-1.9,4,5,4,4,3.5,"The beer pours a rich, thick, blackish brown color with fairly good head retention and lacing. On the nose, however... wow! This is a chocolate lover's wet dream. It's as if I'm smelling a solid bar of hershey's dark chocolate, that's how intense it is. There's also hints of vanilla and coffee, but the chocolate aroma is INTENSE!!!! On the palate, the beer is nearly as outrageous, with the flavor profile showcasing plenty of chocolate, vanilla and coffee, with a fairly long, hoppy, dry finish. There's a bit of licorise and burnt toast in the finish, which is just a bit off putting with all the chocolate. Nevertheless, this moderately sweet stout is quite impressive. Mouthfeel is fairly full, with long, dry, bitter finish. Drinkability is pretty good, though the combination of sweetness, bitterness and noticeable alcohol detract just a bit. Nevertheless, this is a very impressive stout from Rogue.","John_M","Aug 17, 2010"

I should mention that I believe Rogue's chocolate stout is the best chocolate stout ever made so I'm kinda excited for this one. Taste is very similar to its little brother with maybe a touch more heat. If I had to pick which one was better, I'd have to say it depends on one's mood and maybe the weather.

I want to say that the bitterness is from the chocolate but OldSock told me that they make this with extract so there shouldn't be any coming from there. It could be roasted malt I suppose, it was just way too much. It also finished quite dry which I didn't appreciate with that level of bitterness. As the snifter emptied I realized that there was a thick layer of sludge at the bottom of the glass. It looked really unappealing.
