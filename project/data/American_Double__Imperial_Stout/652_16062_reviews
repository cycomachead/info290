"Not very impressive.. I was expecting more..."
"Overall, a well done BBA beer. Not the most complex example you'll find, but the bourbon isn't overpowering, which is a trait I particularly enjoy. If you enjoy a BBA beer where bourbon doesn't dominate, give this beer a try!"
""
"Aroma is bourbon, vanilla, espresso, malt, and dark fruit. Taste is malt and fruit forward. Bourbon is there, but it feels out of balance to me. Needs more dark roast to balance the dark fruits. Its too sweet with a thin mouth feel."
""
""
"2013 vintage, in April 2015 - pours a very dark brown to black color with a thin off white head.  There is some lacing and a little carbonation.  The odor is strong, fruity, coconut, dried fruits, fig, plum, raisin, sweet, malty, bourbon, woods.  The taste is rich, bourbon, vanilla, woods, malty, fig, dried fruits, coconut, chalky, not bitter, some alcohol burn."

"Good intro bba stout, that's about it. Would not cellar or actively look for it. Solid but nothing special."
""
"2013 bottling, good flavor little thin on mouthful"
"Nice creamy stout-- medium body, semisweet chocolate, smooth but lacking depth and complexity... very enjoyable!"

"overall: would 100% get this again and will look out for it in the years to come. most drinkable BA stout that I've had thus far"
"From taste notes. Appearance: Brilliant black with a 1” tan tinted persistent and lacy foam cap. Smell: slight bourbon, fruit, dark malt, dark fruit – prunes, raisins, Taste: Flavor: Creamy, bourbon and caramel quickly joined by chocolate and then espresso and some vanilla notes. Mouthfeel: Medium full body, carbonation medium but so soft as to suggest nitro beer. Overall: A very drinkable and enjoyable bourbon barrel stout."
"O - I tried this when it was first released and thought it was an average BA stout, now with age, I'd pick this over a BCBS without even thinking twice. Wish I had even more in my cellar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Recommendation: A bit easier to find than you're average BA Imperial Stout. So at this quality, I'd definitely recommend grabbing a 4-pack if you can. It's pretty cheap, too."
"O (4.25) - I really like this beer.  I've been really into these bourbon barrel aged beers, and this is towards the top of that list.  Will defintely buy again, and may consider aging some of them."
""
"Smooth taste with a boozy finish.  Another fine bourbon barrel that everyone should try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours from the bottle a dark brownish black. Nice chocolate aroma, and the bourbon makes me think of warm fudge. The chocolate and bourbon predominate the taste, followed by creamy spice. I really enjoy how the bourbon doesn't overpower the beer. Instead, it compliments it. Medium mouth. This is easily one of my favorite barrel-aged stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very strong bourbon in this one.  A little thinner than I would like given all the bourbon flavor.  Very tasty though."
""
""
"O - Good bourbon barrel stout, but doesn't really stand out to me as especially impressive.  I would certainly have another, but this is a crowded style with lots of really good entries.  An older vintage, so perhaps I waited a bit too long on this one - will have to try a newer vintage and compare."
""
""
""
"Overall - Extremely well put together.  Again, the bourbon barrel is up there.  When they say Reserve Bourbon Barrel, they do not mean they are reserving the bourbon barrel taste for the birds.  Definitely World-Class stuff.  Nice and soft at toward the end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is very smooth, creamy or velvety depending on the sip, with a medium to heavy chewy viscous body and feel that leads to a sweet bourbon infused aftertaste that has a slight bitterness and traces of coffee grinds. As stated above it’s very similar to Goose Island BCBS, but like it’s younger brother that may not have the bad ass reputation but is better looking; this brew is not as strong as BCBS and has more oaky and earthy/peat moss notes, but it’s an outstanding imperial stout in its own right and one I will seek out as well as highly recommend."
""
""
""
"O - Big on the bourbon barrel and kind of lighter in size than your average BA stout, but pretty nice flavors, good to have this in a minus 10% beer as well."

"Great aged stout smooth with great flavors"

"very enjoyable...get it when you can"
"Perfect brew. Have had very few to this standard. Vanilla at the front then very oaky. Chocolate and coffee to finish. Very nice brew to warm you right up after a cold South Dakota day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is one damn fine BBA Stout. I love vanilla in my stouts and this just hits the spot! The sweetness of the vanilla and bourbon are perfectly balanced with the bitter earthy hops at the end. Not as good as BCBS, but very, very close. A little more mouthfeel and this beer could easily be top 3 BBA Stouts in the country."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Somewhat creamy or at least smooth/coating mouthfeel. Good body but not too viscous."
""
""
""
""
""
"O.  This beer is delicious.  Sometimes you don't want something as potent as a bcbs and this is it.  Lil sweeter.  I'm loving this beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
"A fantastically drinkable BBA stout. This is a review of the 2014 release - seems to have a thicker body than the 2013 version. Excellent, full mouthfeel. Pours with a velvety off white head. The nose is caramel and bakers chocolate. Bourbon notes are warm but not overpowering."
""
""
""
""
"Bourbon forward, bot not too hot.  Thin, but a nice balanced BA stout."
""
"64oz growler from Whole Foods in Manhattan. Pours a pitch black color with a small amount of head that disappears quickly. Minimal lacing. Smells great. The aroma is Bourbon with some coffee, vanilla, caramel, cocoa, and espresso. The taste is bourbon, cocoa, coffee and earth. Lots of woody bourbon flavor. Earthy notes. Finished with some more Bourbon and alcohol warmth. I'm surprised that the ABV isn't higher. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style. Pretty drinkable. Overall, really good Bourbon Barrel Aged Stout I'd grab again."
""
""
""
""
"O:  Very nice stout especially if you enjoy bourbon forward beers.  I would be very interested to get another of these to age for a while."
""
""
"Crisp, smooth & un-mistakenly bourbon aged. Smoky notes of caramel & coffee really seem to stand out at first sniff & taste. Alcohol content sneaks up quickly so don't let the clean finish fool ya."
""
""
""
""
"This is one Solid beer!"
""
"O: Starts out really big, lots of bourbon, some stout aromas and flavors but the beer kind of drops off at the end, doesn't blend well. I think they need to bump up the ABV, maybe that will help balance the beer with the bourbon, but not bad at all, would definitely purchase, seems a little raw compared to other BA imperial stouts, but really good, definitely worth a try and I would put this in top 10 of my own personal BA stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of my favorite stouts. Rivals BCS, but resembles a world-class upgrade of Dragon's Milk."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely loved this BBA stout, everything I was expecting from BCBS came through in this. All the things I wanted to have a punch did and all the things I wanted to be subtle were."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle.  Pours black with low tan head.  Aroma is sweet booze and roasted chocolate.  Taste is similar with a sweet booze finish, could use more roast"
""
"Outstanding barrel aged brew. Does everything well. Nothing too overwhelming, just an extremely well balanced bourbon barrel aged brew."
"Too boozey, needs some time to age"
""
""

"Single best BBA I have had. A: black as night, w/ 1 finger head if poured properly. S: harsh, but calming for anyone who enjoys a good snifter of bourbon. T: didn't get enough time to really delve into the individual favors, but it is fantastic. F: The name of the game here is SMOOTH. Unlike BCBS, this starts smooth from sip one without cell wrong. Could be because it's only 9.5 instead of 14 for the BCBS."
""
""
""
"This was the biggest disappointment in bourbon barrel stouts, aromas wrre great but that's about where the show ends.  Thin mouthfeel, very little chocolate flavor heavy on the burnt toast and bourbon, nowhere near Bourbon County and that is what I was expecting"
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the best bourbon beers... Only outshone by CW's other more rare bourbon releases"
""
"Nice chocolate/boozy smell. A little more carbonation than I would prefer, takes away from the silky feel. Still a really good sipping beer"

"It pours almost completely black with a moderate mm or 2 of mocha head that fades into a soft ring around the circumference of the snifter .  The nose is of toasted coconut, bakers chocolate and a little booze.  The taste is chocolate, chocolate, chocolate! Reminds me of eating a toasty brownie dipped in vanilla icing. The body is a little thinner than I expected, but undoubtedly a contender in the world of relatively low ABV BB Stouts.  This is my first CW beer ever and I can't wait for more....got this in a fantastic trade with with jdonahue81.  Cheers to beers!"

"2014 in a tulip glass.  Poured relatively thin for a double stout. Dark brown in color, not very opaque - more porter in appearance IMHO.  Smell is awesome - bourbon, vanilla, roasted malt, a little fruitiness.  Taste is great as well - bourbon is not overwhelming and the vanilla really shines with some nice malty and chocolate undertones.  Very little hop flavor or bitterness.  A little on the thin side vs other similar stouts, carbonation is good.  Overall,a very balanced bourbon barrel stout that seems to be ready now - will be great to see how it ages."

"This is a really nice beer!  I actually would argue that it's almost as good as BCBS."

"Dark brown black color with a decent tan head. Aroma of coffee, bourbon, chocolate, and molasses. Taste reveals some dark roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, bourbon, molasses, hint of toffee and char. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. A solid stout."

"O - Utterly perfect.  Not as big as some (like BCBS), but just perfectly balanced such that no flavor overwhelms or dominates.  The bourbon is done well, but the 1 year in the cellar really is helping to calm this bad boy down and soften the heat.  If you spot this it is a must have - drink a couple if you can't resist but you have to put some down for at least a year.  I have had a bottle with 4 or 5 years on it a couple of months back and for me at least, some of the oxidized notes were too much - my guess is somewhere in the 1-3 year mark is perfect."

"O - great example the quality of bourbon barrel aging has on a well made big stout. Central Waters offers a great stout with this. A more blue collar bourbon barrel stout that is simply well made and oozing quality and drinkability. I took great pleasure in this experience and hope one day I can get my hands on another one of these."

"very solid BB stout look forward to next one"
"Poured hard. Resulted in very dark black body and a one inch brown head with fairly large bubbles that dissipated fast. The body is so dark it doesn't allow any light through. On the nose is a strong smell of fresh oak, bourbon, and caramel. Very sweet taste. Almost like eating a caramel from a nice candy shop. I like the taste, but like the smell more. Also tastes of vanilla, some bourbon, but not really that much alcohol. I love CW’s barrel aged beers. No one does it better, and this one does not disappoint."

"The beer is dark brown with a flimsy beige head. The aroma brings bourbon, malt, brown bread, butterscotch, chocolate, oak, booze. Similar flavor with a delicate, silky feel on the palate. Light touch of butter. Rich and robust. A hint of oak in the finish. Really tasty."

"M/T/O: More of an oak bomb than anything else. Grainy wood notes, spicy peppery finish. The finish was thin, which wasn't the best combo with the flavor at the time. Chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon flavor mid-palate-once again thinner mouthfeel; it was kinda like chocolate soda with a shot of bourbon thrown in. Ok, let' wait 15 minutes and let it warm. Thickens up a bit, and it's an oily oak bomb. Fruity base stands out more, dates and chocolate, but not decadent in presentation. Fruity and sticky."

"O- Very impressed. Flavor profile matched by few, with a body that is matched by many. This went above and beyond my expectations."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. Pour leaves a thick tan head with an immediate aroma of chocolate coming through. After settling down the aroma of chocolate remains, and the bourbon comes through underneath. Taste is on par with some of the heavy hitters in this category including BCBS and Brunch weasel. Not as sweet as BCBS, and not as much coffee as brunch weasel, in all honesty more well balanced than both. Chocolate and bourbon are prominent with tobacco, molasses, vanilla, plum, cherry, and a touch of coffee. Feels slick and syrupy, and allows the taste to linger on the tongue for a delightful amount of time. One of the best of this style I've had."

"O- well done"
""
""
""

"Overall, this barrel-aged stout doesn't steamroll you with flavor or body, but its quite delicious and classy nevertheless. The admirable dark chocolate presence is sure to please those who prefer their stouts with more of a chocolate bent."

"Pours a dark brown with very thin head though it does coat the glass a little as the glass empties. Aroma is boozy and sweet. Flavor reminds me of an Irish coffee with some smoke and maple syrup thrown in. Nice treat overall."
"O: This beer for me was tempering expectations. I had only heard good things, so I knew I was in for a treat. I went in thinking it would be good, and it exceeded my expectations for sure. It's definitely a small dark horse in a world of big whales. I enjoyed it from first to last sip."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A little unidimensional being mostly roast flavors in the taste and smell. The bourbon is very light and only there because one is looking for it. Not in the same ballpark as a Bourbon County but worth a try if you like coffee stouts."
""
"Cannot wait for the next time I encounter something barrel aged from these brewers."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a unique beer. The base stout must be around 9-9.25%, which makes this one of the lightest all-BA stouts on the market. It's better than many special release BA beers that cost twice as much. It's more drinkable than BCBS or Dark Lord, and this year's batch has some extra chocolate flavors to it. CW keeps getting better and better at brewing and barrel aging stouts."
"Bottle from Homer321 in trade as an extra! Big thanks. 2013 bottle poured to a FW Barrelworks Teku. Pours dark brown to black with a half finger of creamy khaki head. Aroma of graham cracker, vanilla, oak, bourbon, coconut maybe, caramel cream. Flavor is sweet caramel, chocolate, sweet anise, bourbon booze, vanilla finish. Mmm. Body is medium, maybe on the thin for the style but doesn't take away much from the nice flavors, with medium carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a fantastic bourbon barrel stout, I'm enjoying it as much as Goose Island BCBS and I'll mark it up some additional points for not being owned by InBev."

"Overall the beer Is excellent. Glad to have it around if I need a good Stout fix. Bourbon barrel was very overpowering and most of the love it gets is what I believe to be whatever actual bourbon barrels they use or the time/process they use. Thier barrels seemed to complement the wee heavy base better than thier stout. This is by no means a bash on the stout. It was an excellent brew but not much stout is in the mix for my taste.."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer has a slightly thin mouthfeel, but very appropriate for the ABV. The beer is relatively drinkable, but still has beautiful complexity of a bourbon barrel aged stout. Very aggressive coconut notes, even more so than Proprietor’s."
"Maybe there's too much bourbon flavor? I'm sure when this sucker warms up, I'll be dealing with a whole new flavor profile. Can't wait!"
""
""
""
"O: This is a really well blanched beer as you can get both the oak and the bourbon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Overall, a really nice brew. I don't picture much happening to it with age, so it's almost a relief to imagine myself drinking these with no guilt over the next couple of weeks! I'm glad I found it in the shop, and I'll definitely buy it again next year."
"Overall - Great Beer. Perfect for slowly sipping out a snifter."
""
"This is a darn good bourbon barrel stout- tons of character to offer and while the bourbon is more forward than some of its counterparts it remains pretty well balanced."
""
""

"O: this was an upset pick of a beer - what at first felt like a ""thinner-than-I'd normally-like"" feel quickly evolved into an elegant drinking experience. The bourbon barrels used readily impart their woodsy, vanilla, and caramel-esque flavors to the nose and tongue, but the dark roasted malt base beneath maintains an integrity of form that is quite impressive. Neither shooting to be ""big"" in the mouth nor trying to appear too sophisticated/elite, this beer nonetheless manages to do both at the same time. Pick some up, you won't regret it."
""
""
"Bottle to snifter. As I poured I could not help but notice the thinness to the depth in this beer. Imperial Stouts IMO should be dark, with no light shining through. This beer was dark, but not dark enough. The light passed through it too easily, something I would expect from a standard stout, not an imperial. The smell was just ok. Faint bourbon, no vanilla, no malt or indentifying nuances that stood out. I'm a fan of bourbon stouts, this beer lacked substancially in comparison. The base beer stands out in no way to me. It's awfully thin and watery. The bourbon barely helps. I like my beers to be big and heavy on the bourbon. This one just didn't do it for me. I appreciate the trader who got this to me. Cheers."

""
""
"Didn't have this one fresh but it seems to have aged nicely. I can imagine that a fresh one would be a bit hot with bourbon. Wish it was a little chewy on the mouthfeel. Hopefully, I'll pick up a 2014 this weekend to see how they compare. Definitely a good value for the price."

"World class sipper, happy to be able to enjoy it on tap, via my growler."
"Overall, I expected a bit more, and just thought the bourbon was over the top here. I'm no stranger to barrel aging, but this guy is more of a caricature of the style, or at the very least, an extreme example. Would love to try the base beer to see if any of the subtleties in this BB stout are still there."

"Overall: There was a fair amount of this around so I picked up a 4 pack. It's a tasty, boozy treat. I'm much more used to bourbon than in the past, so it would be interesting to match this up head to head with GI Bourbon County. My memory of GIBCBS is boozier than this one, but that was a while back. Definitely a tasty beer."

"Central Waters Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout ---4.5/5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a well rounded Specialty Imperial Stout. A great beer on its own, it retains a more complex balance with subtle sweet and sour bourbon barrel flavors. I don't think I've had a more balanced and drinkable beer of this style. Impressive and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm really glad that I picked up a couple packs on my recent trip to Madison. I came back with various BCBS as well, and I will fully admit that those are better, but Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Stout is a very close competitor, while being a totally different beer. Sometimes you want a massive, booze-laden behemoth, and sometimes you want something that isn't so big, but still packs the full flavor. This is that beer. With something like BCBS I feel like I have to set aside an evening to drink one. With this, I can just break one out any time."
""
""
""
"Great bourbon barrel stout! It doesn't beat bourbon county but to be honest, I don't think anything will. My number two behind the bourbon county it has a great bourbon taste that doesn't overshadow the delicious stout flavor. Great mesh of the two. Definitely recommend it! One of my top 5 favorites!"
""

"Overall: Despite it has a ton of bourbon flavor that takes over the stout, it's still very delicious and enjoyable to drink."

"Overall: Very delicious. Very drinkable. I'm gonna stash at least 2 of the bottles in my cellar and see what happens as it ages. Very excited to see where this goes - got another bottle of BCBS stashed alongside this, so I can do a direct comparison."
""
""
"O: Not as big as BCBS and the base beer isn't as complex, but one hell of a substitute. Great clean barrel flavor comes through and the stout is balanced along with it. Can't wait to see how this ages."
"Overall this is probably the best bourbon barrel stout I have had. If you like bourbon barrel imperial stouts I bet it would be hard to find a better one. I would seek this beer out. Will be aging the rest as I have heard this beer gets better with age. This was bottle on 3-25-13."

"Central Water's Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout is an intense and super bourbon-forward brew that smelled simply amazing but lacked a bit of complexity in the flavor profile. Regardless, this is an impressive cold weather sipper and worth seeking out."

"Overall, another solid barrel aged beer from Central Waters. I can say I prefer this to Peruvian Morning. It also has great value at only $11/4 pack, definitely worth the annual purchase."
"I just love these bourbon-barrel-aged imperial stouts and can't get enough of them. They all seem to have their own particular charms and characteristics. KBS is that nice, sweet, well-behaved, well-mannered honor student like your folks want you to marry someday. BCBS is that rough, foul-mouthed, hard-rocking chick that you'd hate to introduce to the folks, but lust after nonetheless. This one is like the cool girl you hang out with for years (because she likes comic books), and then one day you realize just how pretty she is."

"Pours pitch black with a khaki mocha head that quickly dissipates but leaves good lacing. Aroma is bourbon up front with nice oak barrel characteristics, some vanilla, and some cocoa. This is a wonderfully balanced barrel aged stout! The barrel characteristics accentuate big chocolate and roasted notes and leave a nice sweetness on the palate, but not cloyingly sweet. Mouthfeel is a nice medium, full bodied but not sticky and chewy. Worth seeking out as this is an excellent barrel aged imperial stout. I would happily drink this one any day."
"The mouthfeel comes off as two steps lighter than the 2012. The alcohol is much more hidden this year, too. Still viscous and creamy, just not as liqueur-like and decadent as the 2012."
""
"O: This is DAMN good...I'm opening another right after I finish this one! I like the fact that it's different than what you may be use to as far as bourbon barrel aged stouts are concerned. If all the BBAS were the same, then this would be a very boring beer world!"

"Taste has a TON of bourbon and wood notes. The malt is lighter than I thought and the alcohol very smooth. It is a really nice beer. Quite a bit better than the regular CW BBB. The sweetness gives it a nice balanced feel. Vanilla/coconut undertones come out as it warms. Tasty stuff!"

"Overall: I'm more of a BCBS/Black Note guy, but this is by no means bad. It's not as sweet as my two favs, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. I'm just a big and sweet guy(that's what she said). The lack of sweetness lends to the balance of this whole thing and it is good."

"I received this in a trade, I've never heard of the brewery before. Overall I think it's a really good beer. Last week I did a taste test of KBS vs. BNS vs. BCBS vs. Great Lakes Barrel Aged Blackout Stout. This one falls around where the Great Lakes was in that test (BNS was the winner IMHO). It's a really good beer. Is it in the same league as the others, not quite. all the components are there but it seems a little disjointed. At the time I'm writing this I've let the beer warm up quite a bit. At this point the ETOH has come out much more in the flavor and aroma but so have the Stout flavors of Chocolate and Coffee. When it's cold the Vanilla dominates the aroma and flavor but has blended nicely at around 55 degrees. Bourbon flavors and aromas are still the most prevalent but the Stout underneath is starting to come through. It's a very good beer, worth trying if you've never had it."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is definitely a bourbon-forward beer, which plays well to my preferences. I can see how this would be overpowering to those who don't like straight bourbon. I'm looking forward to seeing how my other bottles continue to develop as it's still drinking hot after nearly a year. Overall, a great BA Stout that seems to fly under the radar."

"I agree with several past reviewers - this is a whiskey-forward brew. (If this beer offers ""hints"" of bourbon, then I've been using the word incorrectly for 30 years.) There is a pleasant ""milk duds"" aroma, but I found the alcohol burn harsh on the palate even with 8 months of age. The subdued nuance of a good kentucky bourbon is lacking. It is not as refined as KBS, despite being 9.5% instead of 11.7%."

"Beer is heavy to medium-heavy in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a smooth, moderately foamy mouthfeel. The slight stagnation that the lower carbonation imparts is fitting for this bourbon-like sipper of a beer. Closes dry, with substantial and lingering stickiness on the lips and tongue."
"overall we have a definite winner right here folks. with an exceptional taste and feel, this is a beer that i'd love to return to again and again."

"Overall awesome beer, great flavors, perfect amazing aromas, good dark chocolate and caramel blended with lots of awesome barrel flavors, with just the right amount of booze. I don't know if the age really kicked it up a notch, or it is usually like this, but I really need to try one fresh."
""

"This is medium to lighter bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is boozy and enjoyable but I think there are better barrel aged stouts out there with a little more complexity and body. Not to say this isnt enjoyable, because it is but I would not rush out to buy lots of this. Certainly worth a try though."

"Sampled from a 12ox bottle. Thanks Surge1311! Jet black with no light coming through and a small beige head. This is much more balanced than their BA Barleywine. The bourbon and beer play well together. The aroma tends toward bourbon but the flavor is much more balanced. The bourbon is there but the stout holds its own. Nice creaminess and satisfying flavor. Well done."

"O - All too often I find bourbon barrel-aged stouts high in alcohol and overshadow their actual beer base with an outlandish punch of booze. Central Waters has expertly balanced this Bourbon Barrel Stout to be both drinkable fresh (sans that typical heat) and worthy of further aging. It's incredibly smooth body and robust flavor profile combine for an unrivaled, easy-to-obtain barrel-aged stout experience."

"O - Central Waters seems to know their way around a barrel. This was a fantastic representation of the style. Big aromas and flavors of vanilla, bourbon, molasses, and dark fruits. I enjoyed it more and more as it warmed. Smooth and easy drinking for a big BA stout. I highly recommend this beer."
""
"O-I like this better than last year's release, bravo CW!"
"Not quite what I expected given the high praise I've seen for this. Not particularly balanced and a tad thin. But still quite tasty overall.

"Overall- Very nice in flavor and aroma, with some nice complexities. Very tasty! Not the most inky-black stout out there, and a bit thin...but these factors don't drag this beer down too much. While this may not be the stout to end all stouts, it is definitely well above average and well worth your time if you can find it. Cheers!"

"This poured out as a very deep red color turning black once it's in the glass. The head is tan, settles quickly leaves just a ring around the glass. The retention is minimal, and there really isn't much lacing. The smell of the beer is sweet with bourbon aromas, wood and vanilla, there is some roasted chocolate on the nose also. The taste of the beer is boozy, some strong vanilla and sweet malt with a dry roasted finish. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, gentle carbonation with some heat in the finish. Overall it's a very good beer, the flavors blend really well making this really enjoyable. The beer gets better as it warms. Definitely worth trying."

"Edit 7/1/2014: Mouthfeel is awfully thin. Still, the sweetness is nice. I just think the thin feel makes the barrel flavor seem harsh and kinda watery."

"Full bodied with a blast of bourbon heat that lingers over the other barrel notes and roasted malt into a slightly spicy, dry finish. A bit boozier and heavier on the bourbon flavors th an the nose suggests, but the barrel character remains complex and is nicely integrated into the base beer. Some dry, charred oak followed by a strong sweet and spicy bourbon presence that's followed by a smooth vanilla bean flavor before the roasted and sweet malt notes come in. Not as sweet or dessert like as the nose hinted at but there's still some subtle silky chocolate flavor countering the intense roast. The rost compliments the dry oak and spicy spirit with hints of dark chocolate, burnt toast, oatmeal and espresso bean. Slightly hot with some warmth in the finish but after the palate adjusts, the high ABV is relatively well masked. Definitely a sipper but the complexity and intense flavors make it a very enjoyable drink."
""
"Truly an epic Bourbon Barrel aged imperial stout, at a price point that defies the industry standard. Basically the same componentry as 1414, which won gold at the GABF, this spends a year in heaven hill bourbon barrels, and the result is nearly perfect. Chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and a hint of coconut make for an outstanding beer. Do yourself a favor, get a bottle or two if you can."

"2012 Vintage. Pours black...but appears dark brown when held up to light. Small, light-tan head that disappears quickly. Scent is is bourbon up front with some nice chocolatey notes. Pretty heavy caramel malt aroma with some very subtle oak. As the beer warms up.. a little bit of chocolate cocoa comes through with just a hint of coffee. Taste is sweet bourbon at first. Lovely notes of vanilla and toffee. Somewhat of an interesting soda-like flavor...can't tell if I like this aspect or not. Nice chocolate flavors with just a hint of black licorice. Mouthfeel could use a little more body. Drinkability is pretty high, as the ABV is WELL-hidden. Overall, I wouldn't consider this among the top bourbon barrel stouts out there (Parabola, BCBS, KBS, etc), but it's pretty damn tasty. Needs more body though."
"O: Hmph, tough call. Beer is quite unbalanced, super heavy on the bourbon. It's not so much that the bourbon is so overpowering, it's that the base just seems weak. Having said that, the bourbon flavors are really nice. Overall it's quite nice; it would be amazing with a bigger, sharper roasted malt base to hold up to the bourbon."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- For the style I knocked a couple of points off due to it being a little thin, but the aroma was spot on and the flavor was nice I just wish there was a little more body. In the same breath, it's kind of refreshing to enjoy a beer of this style without committing to such a high abv. Very good beer overall."
""
""
""
""
"This is AMAZING. Simply stunning. This is everything a bourbon barrel stout should be; the bourbon flavors lead the way, but the stout is equally strong and these flavors blend so well with the wood notes to create a sensationally complex, toasty, coffee/chocolate character."
""
""
""
"O: some say that this is comparable to BCS, but this isn't even in its shadow. its a straight forward bourbon and oak brew, with subtle sweet notes that make there presence known just enough that prevents this brew from being off too off balanced. Glad I was able to buy a single of these, bc I can't justifiy the price of a 4 pk"
"O- Not too bad. A tad sweet for me. Think this would be good to make a float with some good vanilla ice cream. Have to give it to this beer as being very unique. It stands alone as far as I can't compare it to any other BBA stout."
""
""

"Still have a few 2013's, and the 14's are knocking at the door.  Make sure you get some."

"O: A good beer with a great drinkability for an Imperial stout. Bourbon adds a nice character to the beer without overdominating the beer. However, I do feel this one is a bit thin, in both the mouthfeel and the flavor, to be truly great."
"O: A really nice imperial stout here. Liked how present the barrel is even after 1+ years."
""
""
""
"O) This is an excellent bourbon barrel stout, and I can certainly say I am thankful to have Central Waters so nearby. They brew some mighty fine beers. This one falls just a little short in the taste and mouthfeel department for it to reach the stratosphere that I personally place GI BCBS. Having said all of that, I would gladly recommend this beer."

"It's a BA stout all right. Pretty good, nothing to write home about."
""
""
"Overall: Very good. I figured this beer would be a light BB Stout and it was in some ways. Could have used some more body but at the same time this was a unique twist. Its lighter body balanced well with everything else going on in this beer. Definitely worth a buy."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I enjoyed the nose the most. Ended up sipping this one throughout the evening after dinner. It's not a difficult BA stout to drink at all. Compared to bigger BA beers like BCBS, the mouthfeel is certainly lacking as the base stout must not have been very thick to begin with. But for what it is, if you're looking for a lighter-feeling BA stout with a good nose and some flavour that happens to be reasonably priced ($11.99 for a 4-pack), this is your beer. (4)"

"Notes: At first I wasn't sure of this as the bourbon flavors were so overpowering (I enjoy bourbon and all, but if I want to drink bourbon, I'll drink bourbon). However, halfway through the bourbon mellowed just enough and the heat died down (not sure if it was due to warming, my tongue adjusting, or the alcohol making the heat less noticeable) that there was a great balance between the bourbon and the stout flavors. Quite enjoyable for the price if you enjoy bourbon."

"O - it's an interesting idea to barrel age a stout with such a low alcohol content. Central Waters continues to perform."

""

"012 vintage poured from bottle into Pipeworks snifter. Smells of roasted malt and oak surrounded by a heavy bourbon. Pours a deep brown with a dark fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Tastes of a nicely balanced sweet vanilla, malt, with a nice bourbon overtone that ends in a slight burn. My only wish was it be a bit thicker in body but at the price they sell for, I can’t complain one bit. Love this beer."

"Well, this is a step up from previous incantations. Supposedly this was aged for a longer period of time in the barrels (I believe a year compared to six months for other vintages). The result is a richer bourbon presence and more flavors imparted from the barrel. I always felt previous years tasted too strongly of cheap barrels. What still remains an issue is that the base beer isn't a very sturdy stout to begin with, so the result of barrel aging seems to take an already thin base and thin it out even further. It's not a mess, or Kate Moss thin - damn did I date myself there - but it's just doesn't quite stand up to the better beers in the field. It is, however, a step up in its personal development....CW BB Stout got her pubes."

"Bourbon barrel stout pours pitch black with a thin line of tan/mocha colored head. The nose is bourbon first with some vanilla on the back end. It drinks with Malty sweetness with a touch heat on the back end. It's pretty smooth as well and pretty easy to drink. This was my first central waters offering and I hope others by them are this good."
""
"Overall: This is an incredibly easy to drink beer. I love the sweet desert like flavors. I would definitely have more in the future."
"Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Stout pours jet black, with minimal mocha foam found at the top of the glass. The aroma features lots of dark chocolate, with a bit of a vanilla undertone and just a hint of a spicy oak character. The flavor profile reveals a more nuanced barrel contribution. The same strong dark chocolate base beer note is here, and vanilla is again what comes through most from the barrel aging. Layers of toasted brown sugar and wood follow, before transitioning into a beautiful marshmallow finish. The body is sturdy, but not overbearing, and the carbonation is just a touch too lively. The end result is a mouthfeel that's just off from greatness. Between the Bourbon Barrel Barleywine and this beer, I've got to say that Central Waters is putting out some of the best barrel aged beers in the country."
""
""
"Overall. Bourbon barrel aging gone right! Tons of chocolate doesn't hurt either. Really liked this one. Thanks again Mikesgroove."
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Dark appearance, no real head or lacing, however. Nose is coffee with a bittersweet licorice. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"A good BA stout for those that like bourbon with your beer. If you're looking for a textbook big, roasty stout, you're not going to get it with this one. Either way, pretty tasty."

"The beer pours a deep black with a razor thin, tan, foamy head that casually blankets the liquid's surface throughout drinking. The tight bubbles leave elegant lacing down the inside of my glass and there is no observable sediment. The nose hits you hard with intense notes of boozy bourbon, coconut, vanilla, and milk chocolate sweetness. The taste is grainy, sweet, and boozy with a lingering bourbon caramel. Its body is a rich and sweet airing on the side of heavy medium, but lacks the smoothness that would take this beer to the next level. The alcohol is relatively well hidden within the beer's intense sweetness, but manages to cut through after each sip. Overall, this was a great extra and an exceptional bourbon stout, but there are better options available."
"This is a tasty little number, but the mouthfeel is a real downer. A fuller body with low carbonation would do wonders."

"overall-decent would probably cellar another to see how it develops over time"

"O- This was a very good BA stout that had a complexity of unique tastes that balanced very well together and was pretty easy to drink. There was a decent amount of bourbon presence, but not as much as in the BA Blackout stout. I thought this was very similar to the BA Blackout stout. The appearance wasn't as nice, but the bourbon presence was a little bit toned down which made the beer a little bit easier to drink, both mouthfeels were very similar- the Central Waters was a little bit less carbonated. Overall I'd recommend trying the Central Waters BB Stout if you are into BB beers, worth seeking out to try however I'm not sure if I'd drink this all the time."
"Flavor has brown sugar, milk chocolate, creamy coffee, vanilla, and roasted malt. This is roasty, warm, a little syrupy on the palate. A good sipper with complexity and depth. Will recommend and buy again!"

"O: I like this beer. So many BA stouts, so little time. This is certainly a solid offering overall, but when you consider the price and excellent 12oz form factor, it's a home run in my book. On the ""value"" scale, I would give it a solid 8.5-9."
""
""
""
"Overall - Bourbon is still delicious, even if the stout doesn't seem to be able to take it. I imagine this base stout would be rather mediocre and the bourbon is making it taste better than it really is."
"Dark as night, and taste like bourbon milk chocolate with a bit of coffee."

"12oz bottle, bottled Dec 2011, poured into a snifter, pours deep brown/near black with a very thin tan head, quick dissipation, minimal lacing. Aromas are sweet, roasty, chocolatey, bourbon, and booze. Tastes are harsh bourbon up-front, hot booze, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, oak. As the ale warms, the flavors meld a bit better and the bourbon isn't as harsh. Mouth-feel is medium bodied - I was hoping for fuller - finishes boozy. Overall, pretty good here, but probably wouldn't seek it out again."

"O: I don't like how this beer feels in my mouth, but it smells and tastes great. It has much less booziness compared to the BBBW. Great brew!"

"Pours a solid black color without much of a head, just spotty bubbles. This smells great! Subtle vanilla and oak barrel notes meld nicely with a lightly roasted caramel and chocolate base. It shouldn't be there, but I swear I'm getting peanut butter on the nose. Bits of bourbon round it all out quite nicely. Taste is roasty and chocolate up front that slowly fades to vanilla and oak. Mild bourbon comes in and lingers with some caramel and chocolate long after each sip. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a slick sweet mouthfeel. Great Stout, and it smells wonderful. Could use a bit more roast and a few more bubbles, but I don't mind it a bit as is."
"Overall: At this price point this is the best value on the planet. I am kicking myself for not buying all I could get my hands on because it's gone now. I only got two or three four packs. I can't wait until next year's release. Central Waters knocked this style out of the park."
""
"Poured from 12oz bottle (2012 vintage) into tulip glass. Pours a bright amber color with a small white head that dissispated righ before you could say awww! Aromas are of ripe figs, sugars, cereal grains, and booze. Flavor was quite disappointing for me (which led me to think it might have been infected) - almost could detect some sweet cereal grains, bourbon yet a little ""watered down"". Grainy with almost a rye bread like flavor as well as some dark fruit flavors. The backfinish was warm and boozy. Mouthfeel is decent throughout. Overall, a disappointing beer despite its high ratings IMO."
""
""
"O - as far as barrel aged stouts go I'd have to put this smack dab in the middle. Being thin and having a boozy character the main detriments."

"O: I liked this much more than Peruvian Morning and it probably would have been rated higher if aged a bit more in the feel/taste areas. Smelled great though. I'd like to try it again after some integration."

"O: While this almost tastes like a light stout with a shot of whiskey dropped in it, it's a bit more complex after you let it warm. I'd love to see it a bit more thick and slightly higher gravity but other than that it's pretty tasty."
""
"D= This is a very very drinkable bourbon barrel stout! The only real complaint I have is the thinness of the body (its really thin). But they compensate for that by presenting only a low carbonation level and it really works. Overall a great beer that is dangerously drinkable."
"EDIT: Just opened a bottle from the same batch (2011). I'm starting to become a believer in aged beer. This one has really opened up and balanced out. Really nice. (changed mouthfeel from 3.5 to 4.0 and taste from 4.0 to 4.5)."

"O: As big and bold as this is, I could drink these/this all night; usually a beer this big is a one-and-done...NOT THIS ONE!!!"

"Despite that, I really enjoy the flavor and aroma here. Wish I could give a 4.25 on taste & smell because this deserves a higher rating from me."
"O: Almost perfect bourbon barrel aged stout. If it was a little thicker, it would be a premier beer."
"O- Central waters hits a homer with this one. Wonderfull done guys!"
"I definitely enjoy this beer. If it were available near me and at the right price point, I would drink this a lot. However, compared to other stouts aged in bourbon barrels, I think this one doesn't quite have the muscles to stand up to the aging...."
""
""
""
"First of all the beer had been aged for 4 months prior to consumption. It poured really well from the bottle but left me wanting something more as far as a head was concerned. It dissipated quickly but left a lingering oil in water appearance throughout the life of the beer. The smell was deep in bourbon with a hint of chocolate. Possibly too dominant for some but fantastic in my book. It develops well from beginning to end and lingers on the tongue. Great beer for a fantastic price. Eager to drink it once I have aged it."

"Very smooth yet thick enough to linger, this barrel aged stout is pretty close to perfect."

"One of the better bourbon barrel stouts I've had and does not hurt the wallet. Very enjoyable. Highly recommendable."

"Overall: A great bourbon barrel stout. I really like this."
""
"Dark brown head, uneven size bubbles, slow dissipation with significant lacing. Oak, vanilla and chocolate in the nose, some dark brown sugar, minimal roast. Taste is chocolate forward balanced by the vanilla, certainly took on the character of the barrel, citrus hops. Mouthfeel on the full side of medium, good effervescence, sticky. A really interesting beer, hope I can run across the bottle version for comparison."
""
"O- An awesome beer, super drinkable for being so sweet, I had to try and pace myself and not just pound it back, this beer is a major achievement from Central Waters and should be on everyone's to-try list."

"a jet black pour from a 2011 bottle (no head) into a pint glass. smells of alcohol, vanilla beans, caramel, coffee, nuts, honey. holy crap this tastes like a glass of bourbon.. kind of dangerous since it's 7am! hints of coffee, vanilla, roasted grains, a tad nutty... basically the same as all the smells i got.. and very boozey! it's a very heavy beer, very filling, and a little rough going down from the burning sensation! this stout has balls, big ones. i've never had a bourbon barrel beer that tasted this much like the inside of a bourbon barrel (does that make sense?), so great job on that. a little bit too much for my taste, i prefer subtle booziness and more robust flavors - however the flavors ARE robust on this one, so i have to give it a high score for that."
""
"overall: a nice, not great, beer for me. perhaps i should have sat on this for a while and developed as i seem to remember having this before. the mouthfeel was probably the biggest disappoint for me, but the taste makes up for that some."
""
""
""
"Overall, a really nice, sublte and balanced bourbon barrel stout. The base beer is a bit light for my liking and doesn't carry all the flavor and body I prefer to be put into a barrel. That said, its tasty and easy to drink. I would definitely get again."
"O: A very tasty brew. Impressive in character and taste profile. Definitely a sneak attack beer to offer your beer geek friends. Highly recommended for the adventurous beer snob"
""
""
""
"Overall: I've had some excellent barrel aged stouts, but all the best ones have certainly been of the peaty or smoky sort. The bourbon sweetness here doesn't appeal to me. Although it's not a bad beer by any means."
""
""
""
"O - A terrific stout that ranks #1 in stouts for me. After having KBS, I think CWBBS knocks it on it's ass to be quite frank. If it had the same mouthfeel as KBS, it would be the absolute perfect beer in my eyes. I haven't had CBS or GICBS yet, and I seriously hope they can knock this beer down a peg, but IMO it will be quite a task."
"O: Very well crafted and executed beer. Outstanding! 4/4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5 - 4.47"
""
"Wonderful display of the power bourbon barrels have when it comes to beer. Standout aroma, one dimensional taste (bourbon and it's counterparts), and the mouthfeel is a bit messy. Nonetheless it's a tasty, enjoyable beer and one that I would likely get again. "

"Overall this is a solid A- in my book. I'd drink this all the time if it was available in my area. Thanks again to StPaulSuds for the trade; if you see this beer, drink it!!"
"This is a decent enough beer and is exceptionally well-priced for a bourbon-barrel imperial stout. I also really like the fact that it came in a 12 ounce bottle. But I don’t know that I would buy it again, it’s just not all that outstanding. I don’t have to have the bourbon barrel all the time…gimme a Ten Fidy over this any day."
""
"Overall, decent bal Stout, I really wanted more roasted flavor and its too sweet for my taste."

"O-- Nice little nightcap. A bit too much booze for me but the flavors work really well. Would like to have had more of the base beer. Barrel treatment works really well though. Base beer needs a lot more though.Something I would want again."

"Best way to sum this one up is a liquid coffee cake drizzled with bourbon icing. Really unique in the world of barrel aged stouts. Very good, but it’s sweeter than I generally like my beers to be."

"O: See a running theme here? Central Waters BB Stout is simply that: a BB Stout. No frills or overt complexity. It's just a stout thrown into a bourbon barrel. If that does it for you, then have at it. For those who like layers and depth to your beer, I'd suggest looking elsewhere."

"This is a very good but not elite bourbon stout. Not overpriced either, but the way. I suggest trying it if you have the chance and have enough interest in Bourbon Stouts to be reading this."
""
"Overall: A really great bourbon barreled beer from the Midwest. I'd drink it again and again if I could. Also, the 9.5% makes it more drinkable than most BA Stouts."
"O: Good stuff, shared growler with friend and wish I would have opened a bottle with it to compare, very happy this is available from Central Waters every year"
""
"O: This beer is absolutely soaked in bourbon, with the wood and liquor overpowering the stout elements a litte bit. Maybe some aging could tone the booziness down a bit. Going to revisit in a couple of months."
"O: Not bad, the important factors in this beer (smell and taste) were there but the aesthetics were lacking. I don't think I'll seek it out again."
"i feel that the barrel aging was done very well, but i find the base stout a little weak which in turn throws the whole beer off a bit. still pretty good, but not something i would ever strive to get again with all the other gems of the style. it does leave me very intrigued to try other beers from central waters however."
""
""
"D/O: Although it seems at times more like a mixture of stout and bourbon, it is balanced and generally very appealing. The flavor profile seems to want for some brown sugar or dark fruit. Such qualities would create a bridge between malt and spirit."

"1/5/2012"
"A very very good bourbon stout, not quite up to the Goose Bourbon County or the Founders KBS but not missing that high mark by much."

"This beer does a nice job of adding a big bourbon element without overpowering the stout flavors, nicely done."

"FANTASTIC; WORTH GETTING!"
"Bourbon Barrel Stout pours a jet black color that is underneatrh a nice half inch of dark brown coffee colored foam that leaves no stick. Smell is vanilla under some bourbon, oak, chocolate, cocco. The bourbon is not a killer but a nice strong contender. Not the most pungent smell, alcohol is there but a afterthought. Taste is bourbon mixed with vanilla and some roasted malt giving off a slight bitter vibe. Some cocco or it could be chocolate. The base beer picked up some nice bourbon tones, not to heavy but enough to taste the spirit. I don't really pick up any alcohol. Feel is smooth and above medium with a light but useful carb keeping things in check. I could and probably will drink a shit ton of this in the upcoming weeks."
""
"(174th)"
"O- If you really want to see what barrel aging can do, this is the beer to try. Tons of oak in the nose followed by the strong bourbon in the taste. Even with the strong barrel characteristics, it is surprisingly not overpowering. The vanilla and chocolate elements balance things out nicely to make this a very successful effort. Overall a tremendous beer that I would be happy to drink year round."
""
"O: Overall this isn't one of the best barrel aged stouts I've ever had but I still enjoyed it very much. Worth giving a shot if you have the opportunity! Thanks again Barry!"

"Poured into a snifter. Dark brown, no foam, light film with a white ring. Minor lacing. Smell is caramel, vanilla and little bourbon. Taste is dark malt and caramel, a good bit of bourbon and some coffee. Slight alcohol at finish.  Mouthfeel isn't as heavy as I expected. Carbonation is moderate and good. Overall a decent bourbon barreled stout. Enjoyable but not a favorite."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. This is the singularly most underwhelming bourbon barrel stout I've EVER had. I poured this into the glass from nearly six inches up, and scarcely got fizz, much less any semblance of a head or crown. The nose is pretty much straight bourbon without any level of complexity about it. The taste is, ok. The bourbon's a little more tempered, yet there's still not much else going on to complement it. The mouthfeel is pretty hot. All bourbon. Fortunately it doesn't linger. This will be the only bottle of this I ever drink."
"This beer pours just a bit lighter than pitch black with a bit of thin white head that recedes to a short film. No lacing. The aroma is more raw oak than bourbon, some vanilla notes, a bit of cocoa, but the oak is right at the forefront. Very nice, but not subtle at all. For me the flavor integrates the oak into the beer better. The oak is still very much at the forefront, but it complements the roast and bitter chocolate in the base beer. There is some nice vanilla as well. Mouthfeel is not sticky or overly thick. Lighter, a bit refreshing, but not at all thin. I would say medium bodied. Good fine creamy carbonation. Very drinkable beer even with the 9.5 abv."
"O: A decent enough quaff, but I am looking for a bit more viscosity and some more stout character in my BA dark beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"This bourbon barrel stout pours black with a moderate tan head that diminished to a skim and left a small but consistent lacing down the glass. The aroma is moderately roasty, bittersweet, a good amount bourbon and a bit of oak. Very nice. The flavor initially hits as bourbon, then chocolaty, roasty malt and finally oak with reemergence of bourbon at the swallow. The mouthfeel is full and velvety smooth with a pleasantly dry finish. Overall a treat, do yourself a favor and pick it up."
""
""
" ~ This is not a session brew. This is a one and done, unless your hanging out at the Art of Brewing Festival in Stevens Point and CW is pouring this tasty treat from a tapper. Then you relax with a pal and enjoy as many as the tenders will allow. If you like beer, you'll love this. Do yourself a favor and enjoy one. It might take you a couple hours but the closer the bottle gets to empty, the better the beer gets. Enjoy. (5)"

"O: This beer is excellent, but I the bourbon barrel is overpowering the stout a bit. I guess you could say this beer is hot. Regardless... I'm enjoying this beer immensely."

""
""
"O: I really liked this one for the style. Hard to pull of the ratio of ""bourbon/presence of alcohol"" in the taste and nose that Central Waters pulls off here. I feel like I could drink 2-3 of these, which is impressive when considering some of the other barrel aged stouts that will completely fill you up after a bottle. Glad I picked up an extra 4-pack to cellar though, would definitely recommend."
""
"Overall - Great beer - very boozy at this point, but balanced and the bourbon doesn't overwhelm the stout characteristics, I can't wait to try it with 6 months to a year on the bottle."
"An outstanding beer. No wonder I've bought loads of it this year."
""
"A really good bourbon barrel stout. Holds the alcohol very well and has a great feel"
"great beer. black, big head, retension, lace. aroma is huge milk chocolate, little bourbon in the background. one of the best smelling beers i have had. tastes milk chocolate, vanilla, wood, lots of bourbon creating a very smooth, creamy, boozy beer. just how i like them. did i say bourbon? and $11.50 per 4, makes this a $5.75 bomber, who needs those $25 bourbon barrel bombers? not me. another superb beer from a very overlooked (at least in my area) brewery. zoom wow."
"Wow, what an amazing and underrated bourbon barrel stout. The beer has a delicate almost buttery texture and a smooth finish. The bourbon barreling is present in the taste adding oak and vanilla flavors to a solid base beer stout. Worth a try if you can get it."
"O: Very tasty little brew and the small price tag in comparison the others of the variety makes it even better.  Nice work Central Waters!"
""
""
""
"This beer pours an opaque black color. The head is a half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of bourbon, oak, roasted malt, and milk chocolate. There is a lot going on in this aroma. The taste is maltier than the aroma with the bourbon remaining in the background. The mouthfeel is a bit light for the style. It is still full bodied, but not as full as I expect an imperial stout to be. Overall, this is a good beer that I would drink again, but there are much better bourbon stouts out there."
"O: Although complex the flavors just are not full enough for a Bourbon Barrel Aged Imperial Stout. The nose is pleasant but the appearance is extremely poor. Good vanilla and dark fruit notes. Not bad for the price but I always expect more from BA beers."
"It pours a medium bodied dark, dark brown with a slight beige lacing around my glass. The nose consists of sweet bourbon, vanilla, and a lot of toffee. The flavors are of bourbon, slight aluminum, vanilla, and it finishes pretty quickly and a little watery. The metallic taste threw me off a bit. Maybe this bottle isn't up to par? The body is a little light for an imperial stout and it leaves an aftertaste as if it had too much CO2. Strange. It's drinkable all things considered but I prefer a more resonating flavor and fuller body in my stouts."
""
"O: Fantastic. Vanilla, milk chocolate, bourbon and coffee all share the stage here. Well balanced and drinkable."
""
""
"This is a quality bourbon barrel aged Imperial Stout that is easy to get, inexpensive and doesn't have the hype machine behind it. More beers like this need to come out. Give this one some more body and we'd have a stand-out beer."
""
"O- This beer has definitely taken on the most characteristics from the barrel, then any other beer I have tried as of yet. It is like drinking bourbon without the alcoholic burn which is absolutely amazing. For anyone who enjoys whiskey in general I would highly recommend this. All the joys of bourbon put in beer form. I was thinking about aging this but Im not exactly sure if I want to anymore. It already seems so perfect."
""
""
"O: Nothing about this beer is great, but it works pretty well together. It's fairly sweet, bourbon-forward, but there is no hint of ABV and there is a good amount of caramel and milk chocolate flavor."
""
"O - I absolutely love this beer and i'm not a huge bourbon guy. I was told if i liked Bourbon County stout that i would love this beer. They were not wrong. I know someone locally who purchased over 20 bottles of this stuff. I am still trying to find it in a store to get some at home. I will get this immediately if i see it on-tap somewhere. It was that good."
""
""
"Flavors blend together better as it starts warming, but overall I feel like it fell short. The flavors, overall, just don't blend like they should. Still a good beer, but I think this beer would benefit from a stronger base beer that can stand up better to the barrel."

"O - a true winner, glad this brewery is semi close to me. Will definitely recommend to every one."
""
""
"O: A quality beer, just a tier below your BCBS, KBS, stuff like that. If that helps. Cheers!"
""
"O: Extremely bold, never offensive."
"Overall: Sort of a beginner's bbl stout. Refined and restrained, but flavourful and smooth. I like it."
""
"I just wasn't feeling this one, especially stacking it up against some of the other -bal beers currently flying off the shelves. It was too hot while not letting enough of the stout come through."
"Smell is some chocolate, a little vanilla, some dark fruits, and some roasted grains. Taste some nice chocolate, great vanilla, a little bourbon really rounds this out. Fantastic!!! Really impressed. Mouthfeel is decently thick for the ABV. Try this beer."
""
""
"D - Aroma beats out the taste here. I like the control of the bourbon and sweet flavors in this, but unfortunately I was disappointed that the chocolate cake prominent in the nose didn't show up at all in the drink. Not a particularly memorable barrel-aged brew but worth trying at least once."
"O: A well-balanced, multi-faceted stout that is drinkable, delicious and well above average now, plus will be interesting to put away and taste again in the future. One of my favorites from Central Waters."
"O: Overall this was a very straightforward, tasty bourbon aged stout. I have another and I am looking forward to revisiting this with a little more age to it."
""
"Pours a very dark brown/black color with only a slight head. The scent is amazing with caramel malts, robust malts, bourbon, and sweet cocoa. Taste is smooth and mellow. Full of rich flavors that can be found in the scent. This beer puts your taste buds to the test! A fantastic sipping beer on a cold night in Wisconsin."
""
"O: solid beer overall, sold at Binny's at $12/4-pack. Worth buying again, very good price point for this beer."
""
"I would continue to drink this beer. But the vast majority of the brewers I've had who have stuck their neck out to try barrel aging a stout have offered something better."
""
"overall: just a flat out awesome brew by CW. i didnt think anything could touch their brewhouse coffee stout, but this is right there. very lucky to live in WI and have this readily available, it can stand up to the likes of other BA brews that are extremely hard to find. and all for only $11 a 4-pack? theres a reason why i bought over a case full of this stuff."
""
"Money. Great flavors, great balance."
""
"This is a good bourbon aged stout, and for the price, you really can't beat it. I'm going to sit two of the bottles down to see how it does with some age."
"This is a pretty good beer overall but probably not in the upper echelon of the style. The nose and the taste have all the elements that make a great barrel aged stout but they didn't really set themselves apart from other middle of the road barrel aged beers."
""
""
""
"O- see above it a good BB stout. i will age the 3 i have remaining as this one will mellow nicrly"
""
""
""
""

"O: A good stout, the bourbon barrel characters are nice, although the palette seems a bit thin. A great cellar-temp sipper, thanks Aaron!"
""
"Still, it's not a miss, and I'm glad I bought it. You should try it and see for yourself."
"D and O: Easy drinking, solid bourbon barrel aged stout. In the ilk of Dragons Milk, very similar."
""
"O- Not bad, but the oak is a little dominant in the taste and the abv makes itself known. Maybe a little aging could help, but I was underwhelmed with this beer."
""
"O: I was thoroughly impressed by this. The taste is wonderfully blended together already and it really doesn't need anymore time in the cellar. Maybe a couple of months if you want no alcohol, but it didn't take anything away from the taste to begin. At $11.99 a 4-pack the value is off the charts. I highly recommend and will be picking more up in the near future."
"Appeared black, opaque, with a thin layer of tan head that laced a little bit. Oaky bourbon in the aroma, roasted chocolate malts. Taste is dark malts, dark chocolate, and yes, bourbon, with notes of oak, black cherries, Sugar Daddies; moderate alcohol warmth. Smooth and on the heavier side of medium-bodied. Not the best of its class, but still good overall."
""
""
"O - Just an outstanding barrel-aged stout at any price, but the fact that a 4 pack costs half of what a 4 pack of BCBS or KBS goes for makes this an easy recommendation. If you see this, grab it."
"D/O- Ridiculously drinkable for being 9.5%, dangerous! Overall an above average bourbon barrel stout. Would drink again, would recommend trying for fans of the style. Thanks a ton 4DAloveofSTOUT for picking this up for me."
"(price based on a $20 max)"

""

"Notes: medium body and a bit too much carbonation for the style, but still very full-flavored with awesome drinkability. Central Waters is another one of those breweries that knows what they're doing when it comes to stouts. Very impressive."
""
""
""
""
"O: Really pleased. For a beer that I walked into a Binny's and bought off the shelf without any effort (i think it was 12 for the four pack, too), this is a hell of a value, esp. in an era where singles of KBS go for nine or ten bucks. I've got an extra 4-pack tucked away for aging already."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are great for the style. It has a good carbonation level and a slight hot bite from the alcohol, pleasant though if that makes sense. Starts sweet and ends nice and warm. You can't really taste the hops, but there is a slight bitterness in the mouthfeel from the hops. Full bodied and well balanced. Really digging it. Big and aggressive in flavor, bold and strong. A sipper with full flavor. I love this beer! Thanks bpfrush for an awesome trade!"
"One of my favorite beers in 2011 and I encourage anyone to grab it on-tap if they're in town."

""
""
"Overall, a below average bourbon stout that is overrated. I will age a bottle to see how it fares."
""
""

"Drinkability: More of one to sip than a session beer, given the style, but this is extremely drinkable and goes down easily and with far less heat than similar beers, and indeed than most beers that I drink in the winter season. Very nicely done, from one of my very favorite breweries."
"O: Great balance between the sweetness and warm bourbon finish. Thin enough to avoid being syrupy, but still smooth and creamy. Excellent beer."
"Overall, this smella damn hot right out the bottle but the flavors and less heated and more packed with deliciousness. Time will help this brew out for sure. Throwin' a 4-pack in the cellar to see."
""
"This is a good barrel aged beer. Nothing spectacular, but definetly well rounded. More like a barrel aged wee heavy. This is a lot like Backwoods Bastard minus the kick of vanilla. For the price $3 a bottle its worth the try."
"O: really nice beer for the price tag. Great barrel aging and affordable. I highly suggest trying this if you can."
"Overall: Very nice Bourbon Barrel-aged Stout. While not one of the absolute best, I was very happy with the price ($10 for a 4-pack). I will age the other three and see what happens."
"I hope with some time in the cellar that the sweetness will mellow out, and everything it is masking, takes a seat at the table. I've loved this in years past, but was pretty underwhelmed by this years batch fresh!"
""
""
"O- This is a solid BA beer, the bourbon is present but balanced with the roasted notes, very enjoyable beer from Central Waters, has to be one of if not the best Bourbon Barrel Aged beer that is easy to get off the shelves and cheap."
""

"Would probably be rated so much higher if it wasn't so easy to get and so relatively cheap. Can't wait for jegross2 to hook me up with some more of these. Very good. Its really become one of my favorites in the world. If you have some of this beer, and you want something from the west coast, hit me up, I trade Black Tuesday, White Chocolate, Pliny, Eclipse etc. . . for this stuff all the time."
"I had last year's vintage on tap about 6mo after its release, and it was better. So this may need a little age on it to mellow out some. At $11/4pk and easy to find off the shelf, this is an excellent value."
"Served in a tumbler.."
"Cost: $12.99 for a four pack."
"Cheers and Merry Christmas!"
"Although a good beer that bourbon lovers should definately try, it simply is not one of the best barrel-aged beers."
"Overall this is a very good barrel-aged stout that I look forward to trying again with a bit of age on it."
"O- very good beer. Love the aroma and the bourbon comes through nicely in the taste."
""

"very similar experience to last year. to comment on the flavor a bit. the barrel is so present in the nose, but the flavor really is velvety chocolate. super smooth and dangerously drinkable. i feel the same if not slightly better about last year's vintage. what a great beer."
"O - I look forward to this release every year. I was a bit nervous given the state of limited releases lately, but was able to snag a bunch - some to enjoy now and some to cellar. While there are bigger barrel aged stouts out there, this remains one of my favorites, and this year's vintage did not disappoint."

"Overall: I love Wisconsin beers and I love Central Waters! This beer is no exception to these rules. Great price at 11.99 a four pack. Straight up...this beer is worth your time if you enjoy bourbon barrel aged stouts! The beer really showcases the bourbon barrel well."
"Overall, I was surprised by this beer. I try to buy some of this every year and in the past it's been very very boozy. This years vintage is outstanding. It's very very smooth, maybe a bit too sweet which will change with age, could use a hint more roasted malt but it's really excellent. The barrel aging gives a nice hint of bourbon with a very obvious vanilla flavor."
""
"Overall a solid example of a bourbon aged Imperial Stout. Not as awesome as I'd hoped, but so long as it wasn't overpowering I could handle it. Worth a try..."
"O: Beautifully balanced beer that is not overly complex like some other barrel aged stouts. Straight and to the point - I like this aspect of the beer. Well done Central! Definitely a most enjoyable surprise."
"Overall this beer was nice but not great. letting my second bottle age a bit before i try this one again,"
"O - I liked this one. The aroma was awesome, and I found myself lifting my glass to my nose more than to my mouth. I wonder what a fresh bottle of this would taste like?"

"Serving type: On tap at Quivey's Beerfest. Best beer of the fest."
"O: Good sipper for a barrel aged RIS, not too hot or strong, and just enough layers of complexity. Thanks to mnbearsfan for this beer, it was the best yet from central waters."
"I got this in secret Hallowenn, thanks Michael. I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter, jet black pour, above average tannish head. The aroma is nice, bourbon, oak, vanilla. A very smooth beer, the bourbon and oak blend nice, hints of vanill, alcohol on the finish, but not overwhelming. The body is full, good carbonation for the style. A BA beer that lived up to expectations."
"Nice tasting stuff. Wish i had more."
"O: This beer was definitely a good bourbon barrel stout. In my opinion it could of used a bit more aging time, but it was still a rich bourbon barrel stout with plenty of oak, vanilla, and definitely sweet bourbon. This stout was definitely a great beer, and I am really happy to of received this in trade from kstrickler. I would drink this over and over again."
"Overall this is a good stout, but I'm disappointed by the thin body and minimal carbonation."

"HV"
"This is a pretty straight forward, really good bourbon barrel aged stout. Black, it is black. It has a light tan head, and surprisingly produces lacing. Lots of lacing. The aroma is better then expected, caramel, chocolate, vanilla, some bourbon notes, it takes alot to tease these aromas out: not a power packed punch. The flavor kicks off with coffee and dark chocolate with roasted barley and deep flavors. The high notes are composed of vanilla, bourbon, caramel and hints of alcohol. A not as thick as expeceted but a fair body to this brew. Overall this is a brilliant example of a fantastic beer that is under-rated and under-hyped because it does not come from a big name brewery. Really a quality brew brought to me by an awesome trader mnbearsfan!"
"O - Another good one from CW in their Brewers Reserve series. I have an 08 so I will see how things have changed with some age on it. Solid Impy stout."
"Overall this is a great brew by CW. The are really doing great things with the barrel at the brewery."
"Overall this is a very good bourbon stout. The alcohol is well hidden and the balance of flavors is nice. Not one of the best I have ever had but very solid."
"D: Absolutely delicious beer.  I was expecting the bourbon to be a bit more pronounced than it is, especially after smelling it, but there is a lot more going on to add great complexity.  Pretty well balanced and really tasty.  Alcohol is hidden pretty well, although there is a bit of heat at the end, which isn't unexpected or off-putting.  A really well done bourbon barrel aged stout."
"O - Just comes together oh so well. Very drinkable, but yet its one to be savored. As it warms the flavor profile gets more and more complex. Just a wonderful offering from what is probably my favorite WI brewery. Cheers!"
"Overall this is a delicious bourbon aged stout that's easy to drink. Though its body is thinner than i'd like for the style, the flavor profile more than makes up for it. This is a top notch beer."
"A great bottle that won't bog you down for being a big stout. Thanks Jon!"
"2010 vintage courtesy of seeswo. Pours the color of cola with a quarter inch khaki-colored head that disperses into a sudsy film and a frothy band. Some residual spots of lacing are revealed after each tilt of the glass. Nose expresses dark malts, bourbon notes, artificial sweetener and lactose. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of dark chocolate and a slight char at the finish. There are also some whiskey notes that come out at the back as the brew warms. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a mild, even carbonation and a slightly oily texture. Not my favorite from this brewer; however, it is a solid, balanced BA stout."
"It was a nice full-bodied stout, though nowhere near as filling as some of the others can be"
"I will have to agree with some of the other reviews here in that this brew packs alot of great flavors and Bourbon character but it just doesnt seem to have the body and mouthfeel to fully deliver. Glad to have tried for sure tho."
"For that many compliments are due."
"Massive thanks goes out to the person (BM me if it was you and I will give you proper credit) who shared this one with the group at the ""Evening Wood"" tasting graciously hosted by cmrillo! 2010 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a deep ruby red brown with a minimal off-white head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, caramel, and toffee. The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, sweet alcohol, toffee, and caramel. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. The toffee aspect in this one really made the beer for me. It coupled really nicely with the hints of the barrel that were present and actually made them stand out more. The aroma was quite nice, but I wouldn't have guessed it had been -bal aged by the aroma alone. Really glad I got the chance to try this one!"
"D – Excellent brew, very easy to drink but not too many at a sitting. Full flavored brew that smoothed over time. More of the body of the brew came out as I let it warmed. I recommend this brew and will have it again!"
"Overall a very good example, not too aggressive."
"Overall- a good brew with good potential. I hope to try one again a little later down the road. When I think BBS I think dark, chewy, rich, roasted stout. This doesn't fill a lot of my criteria-"
"Overall a great bourbon stout that really highlighted the bourbon. The beer was a bit light in body for a stout but I really loved this beer."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Duvel snifter with a small tan head. This is the Central Waters winter seasonal limited release. On the nose I get a really nice sweet, vanilla and earthy aromas. Definitely get the bourbon on this one. The taste hits me with quite a bit of chocolate, vanilla, and a hint of coffee. This beer is extremely well rounded. The mouthfeel has a perfect amount of carbonation for the style, and drinks extremely smooth with a slight amount of dry bitterness on the backend. Overall, I'd have to say this is one of the best bourbon stouts I've ever had, and the price is definitely right."
"M. Lighter in mouthfeel than Bourbon County. Still somewhat syrupy, however."
"O: Perhaps not quite as good as the bourbon barleywine, but still solid, like almost all Central Waters beers."
"O- overall this is a pretty good beer that i think could use some time to smooth out the edges. ill look into getting more of this this year and laying some down."
"Overall this was a good sipping beer. This beer was complex but the bourbon was abit too much and prevented this beer from reaching the elite status of stouts like barrel aged yeti and The Event Horizon. Would like to revisit this beer in a year or so and see if aging smoothed out any bumps in this flavor profile."
"O - Overall a very solid beer. Kudos to Central Waters!"
"Pours a surprisingly thin reddish brown. A touch of off-white head. Smells oaky with a touch of vanilla. There is a touch of hoppiness on the newer batch. The bourbon is a bit abrasiveness on the newer batch. Vry smooth on the 2010 batch. Fairly thin and roasty. Almost more of a porter. Fairly thick for the flavour profile. Overall not too shabby"
"Poured into my bruery tulip. Dark brown with a half finger head which quickly dissipates. Ring of lacing clings to glass. Aroma of bourbon and slight vanilla, not amazing but good. Taste follows nose, bourbon and slight vanilla, finishes with all bourbon. A very good beer just not great."
"I absolutely love this beer, which is the reason why I traded for it again. This beer and Olde Hickory Event Horizon are neck and neck as my favorite beers. If anyone wants to send me more of these, I will not mind at all."
"O: Not a bad beer, but it has the same problem as their bourbon barrel coffee stout in that it tastes much more of the barrel than the beer that went in. It manages to avoid being cloyingly sweet at least, but the beer is not balanced at all with the barrel flavors."
"3.5 D: The base stout isn't bad, but it is middle of the road mediocre. In this case, the barrel aging was done well enough to vastly improve the beer. I usually don't have patience for barrel aged beers that are weak on the beer end, but this just made the cut to warrant a good taste score. However, the overall was used to keep this in line."
"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Pours a very muddy dark brown with a thin tan head on top. Light lace. The nose is full of bourbon, vanilla, oak, and faint chocolate tones on the finish. The mouthfeel is different. It's thin, and the carbonation spritzes a bit much at times, yet, it still feels somewhat ""heavy."" I think that's just the booziness though. The bourbon is still a little hot on this one. Sweet vanilla, wood, cinnamon. There is some creamy milk chocolate on the back end, but I have to wade through the strong bourbon to get to it. I definitely could have sat on this one a bit longer, as I'm sure the bourbon would have faded some allowing this to become more of a balanced stout. But, I'm glad I tried it. A flavorful big stout I wouldn't mind having again sometime. Thanks again, Andy."
"M: Low carbonation and thin. Slightly astringent and definitely warming. "
"Thanks to joshuaseresse for the generous extra!"
"Overall the taste of this beer really trumps its other shortcomings,appearance and mouthfeel. Almost the perfect balance of good Bourbon and good beer. Since I like both I love this beer."
"The taste of bourbon was not as strong this time and it complemented the stout taste quite well. It was still a little too overpowering for me and it drowned out the nice dark fruit taste I usually enjoy in a stout. There was a nice sweetness and warmth with is as well. I now look forward to aging this years along with last years and creating a nice vertical collection for this brew."
"Thanks Levi!"
"D- Moderate. Heavy, took my time, but enjoyed the whole pint. One I would not hesitate to revisit- a tasty -bal aged stout."
"D: This is still pretty fresh, bottled in December 10' so some age will do this well. Right now its pretty low drink because of the hotness. Will have to come back and review this one with aged, hopefully it will round out nicely and other flavors will be more noticeable."
"D - very drinkable. the chocolate and roast might be a bit much for some, but I find it very tasty. will seek out again and recommend it highly."
"D: While drinkable, the didn't seem as put together in comparison to other bourbon barreled beer of its type. Still a good brew worth trying to see if it hits your fancy. Would have another one."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style and carbonation is a little below average. The carbonation fits my tastes for the style pretty well. Drinkability was good, I thought it was a very good barrel aged beer. I really liked the chocolate and bourbon flavors that came together in it. Very nice beer overall."
"D - A good beer but somewhat one-dimensional."
"Scores: Appearance 3/5; Aroma 4/5; Taste 4.5/5; Mouthfeel 3; Drinkability 4/5"
"The flavor does well to present boozy, spicy notes of dark fruit, rum, and sherry sweetness, but the alcohol is really a bit too hot for my liking (even after a year of age). This is slightly unfortunate, really, because after tasting how well Central Waters does with their big-ABV'd Bourbon Barrel Barley Wine, I had high hopes for this stout. It does improve as it warms, however, and the supporting cast of roasted malts and chocolate is tasty. Mouthfeel is heavy on the palate with a tightly-packed carbonation level and lingering, almost sticky finish. Overall, I found this beer to be a little rough around the edges, but still worth seeking out and giving it a try."
"Generally too heavy on the whiskey for my tastes, but pretty darn good. Would probably improve a lot with age - this one was from the most recent bottling."
"d - Overall I really liked this beer. I found the nose amazing and complex; everytime I took a sniff I got something different and equally good. The taste was good, but a little bit of a let down after the nose, but for 9.5%, it was very drinkable. Glad I have another bottle of this one and might have to try and get more."
"December 2010 bottle. Pours a deep mahogany chestnut with a medium head. Nose is mostly a marriage of roasted malt and bourbon with an annoying touch of metal. Mouth is roasted coffee, some charred malt, Irish cream, and a fairly light bourbon. Kind of thin and soda-like at times. Finish is dry and not very expressive. Some good flavors in here, it's well integrated, but flawed and not very exciting."
"There is no ashiness in this at all which I prefer for a stout however It is more of an Imperial Brown ale with Bourbon barrel aging. Very similar Imperial Naughty Goose from Goose Island aged in bourbon barrels and very delicious stuff overall. Easy sipper with medium carbonation and a light mouthfeel."
"Cloudy with a bit of lacing around the glass, it brings a sharp bourbon smell, shooting up your nose and warming up your face. A second whiff adds a slight chocolate sweetness that causes salivation. From the get-go, you can tell that you are in for a heavy beer. This is where the BBS throws you for a loop. A solid bourbon taste along with a chocolate backbone show you that this beer is not heavy, but kicks out some big beer flavors. A sweet and warm chest feel. The BBS coats the tongue and touches the bitter buds. This beer is big, and would compliment a big meal."
"D - This is a nice beer but not a mindblowing one. Slightly thinner than I would like and the base beer seems to be lost a bit in the barrel flavor. That said I enjoyed this one and look forward to opening my other bottle of this down the road and possibly getting more, though I wouldn't go crazy trying to obtain it."
"Overall a very good barrel aged beer from CW. Not my favorite of the 3; Barley wine and Peruvian Morning top this but not by much."
"D: A great tasting, complex beer; the alcohol doesn't slow this one down at all. Quite enjoyable, and I'd love to have another one in the future."
"D - I don't hate this, but the taste is just so disappointing. I'll just take 2 sniffs for every sip and I'll be all good here."
"Slightly thinner body than I'd expect with a little higher carbonation. Drinks well, as the alcohol is under control to the point where I can taste the bourbon without it wrecking the other flavors. A solid bal aged stout, but not quite on the upper end."
"The spirits thin out the body too much for my liking in an imperial stout. The carbonation level is nice though, a bit lively in order to take away from the bourbon. Drinkability is decent but the alcohol flavor really doesn't meld well with the rest of the beer."
"Certainly seems a bit young yet, but this is and will be solid. Can see how this could be confused for some sort of hybrid style at this point."
"d- This beer was really a stunner for me . I really enjoyed this beer and will definately drink another one, but not tonight."
"D - Pretty easy to drink. The bourbon aging is pretty well done because I expected it to be incredibly harsh based on it being a new batch, but its really not offensive here. The base beer (satin soltice) is already an amazing beer but the barrel aging is quite nice. I'm really glad to be able to drink this and have of much of it as I do, and that I live pretty close to the brewery. Seek out its worth it."
"Impression: Whether this is a barleywine or a stout it is completely delicious, and I highly recommend it."
"This beer came in a package along with some others that seemed mistreated and off. I'll definitely give this one another shot simply due to its great aroma but nothing else about it really pleased me."
"D - this is a big beer, the alcohol in the finish helps you pace, sipping one during a football game is pretty ideal"
"This is like a warm wool blanket on a freezing northern WI night that lingers with a perfume of a distant lover. A happiness emerging from the still of the night. Overcoming loneliness. The taste is big with a bourbon hotness seeping through a vanilla kissed, thick malt, dark chocolate slobber. This will be even better next year, but I couldn't wait until then. Two ships passing in the night. Highly recommended, get it while you can."
"overall, i just cannot drink this at all anymore."
"D: very drinkable, very smoothed out bourbon flavor, with only a slight bitter aftertaste."
"The beer is good overall, but nothing special, especially after things like Goose Island BCBS or KBS or any of the other well known bourbon barrel beers."
"This beer is bourbon heavy, to date probably the most I've ever tasted the influence of it. Definitely recommended."
"D - Decent enough for a 9.5%, this is okay, but nothing I would seek out."
"The BBBW was quite the disappointment...hopefully this had better experiences with the barrel. It pours a ruby-tinted black-brown topped by a half-finger of light ecru foam. The nose comprises roasted caramel corn (it blasted me in the face...like opening one of those tri-popcorn tins around the holidays...), oak, vanilla, whiskey, and roasted marshmallows. Strange that the barrels o'erwhelm all else. The taste delivers the expected roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate...then another strong tsunami of bourbon-soaked wood. Still pretty good, though. The body is a strong medium, with a moderate carbonation and a slightly chewy feel. Overall, another disappointment, but nowhere near as deep as the BBBW. It's a pretty good -bal stout (as the West-Coasters would say), but the wood's a bit much for me, smothering the stout-y qualities a bit."
"This beer displays a darkness with a finger of light tan foam. The smell is of bourbon, dark chocolate, rum raisin and butterscotch. The tastes reminds of bourbon mostly with some roasted malts, caramel, and a bit of raisin. The mouthfeel is a tad on the hot side for my liking and could do with some time to age. This drinks pretty well, but still as I said before if aged I would hope that it would mellow. This beer is very good, but has the potential to be much more."
"I find this beer to be pretty good and am interested in trying this with a little bit of time on it (this is the most recent version which literally just came out). A really solid barrel-forward, barrel-aged stout. If value were figured into the review, it would be a solid A, as a 4-pack of this beer is $10."
"D: A very enjoyable big stout from this Wisconsin brewer. A definite buy if I'm ever in the area."
"Beer is nice, it's sweet up front with great bourbon character and has a medium to light body. The finish is a little dry but its a very nice beer. The liquor character is really well balanced into the overall beer. There is a mild tannic character and vanilla from the oak, I really like it."
"Definitely feel the alcohol in the chest and while I like this beer I would be happy only having one. I want to stock up on this and also drink past vintages if anyone has them to trade. This will surely get better with some age on it I gotta believe!"
"D. This is a surprisingly easy drinking Bourbon Barrel Stout. Not as complex as the best of the best, but goes down super easy. A very solid beer."
"D- Its good and very easy to drink. Again my only knock is that I wish it was a bit fuller in body, but overall very excellent brew."
"Chad"
"Drinkability is very high in the realm of bourbon barrel stouts. Though warming (especially by the end) alcohol heat isn't at all overbearing; rather there isn't much heat aside from a little on the the back quarter & finish. Possibly it has mellowed since fresh but this is boasts high accessibility."
"Drinkability is ok. Slightly boozy and the bourbon makes a solid appearance."
"Poured into a tulip. Appearance is dark brown with a slight mocha head and a touch of lacing. Nose is bourbon, vanilla, oak, roasted malt, and molasses. The taste really brings the bourbon through and it is not especially hot, melding quite well with the oak and vanilla. Touch of sweetness. Good creamy feel. Another solid -bal beer from CW."
"D: I'm gradually starting to think that Central Waters makes the best line of imperial stouts of anyone. Satin Solstice, Cherry Bourbon Stout, now this? Every offering is incredible!! Definitely give this a try. Probably one of the best bal- beers around, period!"
"Drinkability:This is a huge bourbon bomb."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style."
"Heavy bodied with low carbonation, creamy and delicious. The bitter coffee aftertaste lingers a bit longer than I'd like, but still a very good beer!"
"D: This was a very nice imperial stout with great coffee flavor and subtle complexities. The body was somewhat weak, but it hid the alcohol well, so it was easy to drink. I enjoyed this better than their Bourbon Barrel Barleywine, and it may improve further with age."
"D: Very drinkable for the genre and ABV. Balanced and nicely done overall."
"Very enjoyable. I was very excited for the chance to try this beer and it did not disappoint. I'm sure some age would make this stout even better."
"D: Overall, the thinness, and simplicity of this beer make it quite drinkable. The alcohol content is hidden well and is not all that high to begin with."
"Excellent!"
"Overall, a very solid ba stout. I am really impressed with CW on this one. Solid BA notes. Pretty drinkable as well."
"OVERALL: A solid brew overall, but it needs to be a little thicker and creamier in the mouthfeel. The balance between the bourbon and the chocolaty, caramel sweetness makes this one worth checking out, however. Thanks for sending one my way oakbluff."
"Finish is all creamy sweet dark chocolate, whiskey and sweet espresso. Good! Note: Still good but fades in the glass a bit with only a little bit of time. Still, a very drinkable stout that's full of complexities and character."
"All the talk about heavy roast and burnt flavors can yield a strongly flavored stout, but this delicate balance of dark beer characteristics show that a careful design and deliberate restraint results in a beer worthy of world class stature. Interestingly enough, I find the bee a little too ""clean"" to garner higher scores."
"This is a very solid bourbon barrel-aged stout. If it looked and felt the part then this would be very well regarded. As is you won't be disappointed if you see a bottle on the shelves or even trade for it. This is like Founders Canadian Breakfast Stout-light. I mean that in the most complimentary way possible."
"This is a drinkable stout, particularly if you love bourbon. The ABV is not covered too well, though, so keep it in mind."
"Overall, though, a very good beer."
"D - The bourbon is definitely too strong, I think overtime it will smooth out a bit but this isn't bad you just have to like bourbon alot."
"haven't had many barrel aged beers that i crave many more than one of. this is one of them."
"This is a tasty bourbon barrel stout that makes for a good sipper on a cold night. The ABV is not too strong, and the vanilla makes this a treat. I highly recommend this and hope to get another bottle or two in the future."
"D: Very nice complexity to this one. Intriguing corn taste adds to this element."
"Dark brown almost black with a light brown head. Smell is milk chocolate, roasted malt, oak, vanilla, bourbon. Taste is milk chocolate, coffee, bourbon, vanilla, and roasted malt. Full mouthfeel, and low carbonation. Overall this is an excellent beer."
"Medium bodied, low carbonation, there is some alcohol burn, but it is not a big deal. Good drinkability. I would not hesitate to buy this again sometime."
"2010 vintage. The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is awesome with chocolate, oak, bourbon, vanilla and alcohol. The flavor is just as good. I get notes of bourbon and oak as well as coffee and a lot of milk chocolate. Medium to thick mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"(D)- A solid to excellent stout. I would be excited to see how this ages, but it is rather good even at this stage. Rich, malty, and sweet. If it wasnt such a potent brew, I could have a couple of these, but one at a time is good enough for me. I enjoyed this one very much."
"D: I think this would improve with six months to a year of aging. Bourbon is a little overwhelming and should mellow a little bit. But this is a solid beer and quite enjoyable to drink. WOuld like to see a little more body."
"Drinkability is great. SO glad I have another bottle of this in the cellar. Can't wait to have it again, really a perfect beer on a Sunday evening as I'm finally relaxing!"
"d- the feel of this one and non-extreme flavors make this one a very easy drinker for a BA RIS. great stuff I'd drink again anytime."
"D- Normally a beer with this much ABV I wouldn't put into a mutiple bottle run but this is very very good and isn't heavy like most stouts making it not as filling. Do yourself a favor and get this beer if you can. You will not be dissapointed."
"In the end, there just isn't too much complexity in the taste to get me excited. Tastes decent enough and goes down easy for the style."
"Overall, a decent bourbon barrel stout, but I find Central Waters bourbon barrel barleywine to be a far superior example of their barrel aged beers."
"Pours from the 12 ounce bottle an oily, midnight black color, topped off with a nice little off-white head. Aromas of oak, bourbon, coffee and dark chocolate. Flavors of bourbon, oak, vanilla, milk chocolate and coffee. A very nice effort. A great beer."
"D: Decent all around, but does not shine in a market filled with this style.. Good. But not great."
"This is an example of a barrel-aged brew that revels in simplicity - & it works, with the result being an excellent brew. Simple, barrel-aged, & drinkable isn't a combo one comes across often. Glad to have more!"
"D - This brew is awesome, and as easily drinkable as a Bourbon-barrel Stout can possibly be."
"Very pleasant and fairly easy to drink beer. One to sip and savor, I doubt I would reach for more than one in a sitting. Central Water has impressed my with their offerings which have been made available to me. Solid beer from a solid brewery, recommended if you have the chance to enjoy."
"Pours a deep dark ruby brown with a light-tan head. Chocolate and bourbon aroma, somewhat boozy, with a honeydew note (???) and wood. Milk chocolatey flavor with the requisite bourbon notes of vanilla and mild coconut, some earthy wood and roasted malt, licorice. A little light for a bourbon imperial stout but it lends a decent drinkability (also helped by the well-hidden booze)."
"Very drinkable, a great overall representation of the style."
"For my 500th BK point I could not have chosen a better local brew, one of the top 100 beers on BA, this is a wonderful example of true craftsmanship. Prost!"
"The body is medium-plus, with enough viscosity to coat your mouth but not too much to cut the drinkabiblity."
"Drinkability is pretty high. A very good bourbon stout overall, but come on, everyone's doing a beer of this style nowadays. I found it a little better on tap than out of the bottle"
"D: wow.. what more could I ask for? A delicious stout infused with the perfect amount of bourbon, and on top of all that, the mouth feel is perfect... this is a great beer!"
"The mouthfeel is awsome. Smooth and creamy. Not too overboard. This is a geat beer that would be perfect with a great meal that you only eat once in awhile."
"As I keep going, the alcohol becomes more apparent. Still a creamy mouthfeel with ample carbonation. A great stout for the price, but would you really expect anything else from Central Waters?"
"Dark brown pour, black in the glass, small dark tan head, patchy lacing. Standard stuff here. Nice bourbon and and roast on the nose, much in the way of oak, but a subtle vanilla aroma in the depths of things. Taste is noticeably more bourbon-esque, with more wood flavors than the nose would let on. Light bitter chocolate, and smooth roastiness bring up the back end. Nice complexity here. Could use a little more body and carbonation, but other another stellar imperial stout from CW."
"Low carbonation, nice medium-bodied brew. But as it warmed it got to be a bit syrupy. I really like the ABV point, being just under 10% is a nice level for a BA imperial Stout. Overall though, this is just a little too bourbony sweet. The first few sips of this were great, but I sipped on the bottle for almost an hour and kept lowering my score in my notes over that hour. Splitting a bottle would be ideal, but I think this one will age nicely."
"Dark brown, near black color, vigorous pour produces a quickly fading thin tan head that settles into a crown with little lacing. Aroma is sweet and boozy, strong influence from the bourbon. Vanilla and roasted malt. Body is thinner than expected with low-medium carbonation and a strong boozy lingering finish. Flavor is very heavy on the barrel aged notes, strong vanilla and bourbon making it difficult to pick up the original beer. Some dark fruits are noticeable, but overall lacking in balance and complexity, drinks much rougher than the 9.5 abv suggests."
"Decent drinkability, but I think I'd only want one of these in a sitting. The alcohol asserts itself enough to make you want to go slow with this one."
"Very much a sipper. I think some aging will help tame this one down a bit and result in higher scores. Tons of character though for an IS from a little known brewery. Barrel aged fans will love this one."
"Well now, this heah's some kinda beer. Mm hm. Served with a small fine tan head and a little lace. Color is an opaque brownish black. Aroma is roasty, bourbon, malt, coffee, vanilla, caramel, toffee, dark ripe fruits, and cocoa. Flavor's about the same but the whiskey stands out along with some bittersweet. Great body and carbonation; perfect for the style. Finish is excellent - medium long and tapered. Really well balanced beer. Rich and yet drinkable. Satisfying and yet intriguing. Go great with a nice mild cigar. Booze is subdued. A masterful beer."
"I really enjoyed this. Dangerously drinkable and surprisingly balanced."
"D: Pretty drinkable for the abv, and the flavor profile is nice so you want to keep drinking it. Pretty good beer, but probably wont pursue it again."
"D: Its good and very easy to drink although not the best BA stout that i have had. It is easier to drink than other stouts but think if th body were a bit fuller it wouldnt be as easy, but would add to the overall experience of this beer"
"D: Again, the bourbon isn't as upfront as some. I'd put it up against many other BB Stouts, this year my favorite is Schlafly's BB Impy stout. This is a worthy brew. Love it. Fine job, guys! Now, distribute this in St. Louis!!!"
"D- Overall a very well balanced beer that is incredibly smooth and goes down pretty easy for the high ABV. I would recommend trying this beer if you get a chance. I have one put away to see what it is like with some age on it."
"Overall this is nice but not standout."
"D: This has some really good flavor and despite having a big bourbon presence, it really isn't bothering me too much. However, you won't be drinking a 4-pack of this in one sitting! Definitely a good beer, and would possibly be great to me if it were a little more viscous."
"D. Highly drinkable for such a rich beer. That said, I would not session this beer. One to slowly sip and savor is perfect. Another great stout from the guys up in Amherst."
"The sourness was unexpected and I doubt it was intentional, but the beer was still pretty good. I look forward to trying this in the future sans the sourness."
"D - At 3.49 for a 12oz it's not bad for a Bourbon Stout. I'd definitely buy this again as long as I have a lot of time to relax and drink it."
"D- Low ABV for a beer of this style means this is a nice capper to a rich dessert. Slightly warming and quite dry makes this very nice on a cold night like this."
"drinkability is good. great balance. pretty nice depth to it. seems like it might be just past its peak and has mellowed out a little too much. still, it's damn tasty stuff that i'm quite enjoying."
"Thanks Russ!"
"Central Waters has another success with Bourbon Barrel Stout. That much is clear. But it could easily be a much bigger success with more malt. That, alone, would probably give it more 'stout' flavor and a thicker body. Those are its most obvious shortcomings. I like this beer, but don't quite love it. It's good, but doesn't quite live up to the standards set by Bourbon Barrel Barleywine or Coffee Stout. Having said that, it's not too far off."
"Vintage - This bottle is from the winter of 2007. So it has 2+ years on it."
"Sample at the Most Honorable SuperHappyFun Stout Tasting. Thanks to MIBRomeo for the trade! This beer is a dark brownish-black color with a medium and foamy beige head that recedes slowly. Patches of lacing on the glass. Aroma of rich malt, bourbon, oak and vanilla. Full-bodied with flavors of malt and butterscotch, bourbon and dark fruits. Lightly bitter hops and coffee in the background. The finish is roasted malt and butterscotch with a lingering coffee and vanilla aftertaste. Very good overall."
"D: Very good. I could easily finish a bottle by myself. Hell two or three if I'm feeling saucy!"
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The stout appears a translucent ultra deep brown color with about two fingers of light ecru foam. No lacing to speak of. Nose and flavor consist of coconut, vanilla, milk chocolate, bourbon, dates, black cherries, caramel, molasses. Approaching full bodied and somewhat slick with ample carbonation. This one has been in the cellar for a bit, so there is very little alcohol heat. Quite tasty."
"Drinkability: I came home from school today looking for a delicious imperial stout; unfortunately, this beer wasn't what I was looking for. I'm glad I got the opportunity to try it, but I can't say I was impressed."
"Thick, and delicious. Central Water knows their stouts and this, of course, is no exception. So complex and full of character. A beer that I thoroughly enjoyed and would not hesitate to purchase again."
"Drinkability- Very flavorful beer that takes on maybe just a bit too much of the barrel and the beer itself is sort of lost. It could probably use another year or so to hide some of that alcohol too but other than that, it's pretty tasty and unique. Big thanks to Steve for his generosity!"
"Body is a bit thin, but well carbonated. Tasty stuff."
"dry, roasty, and warming mouthfeel, medium body, carbonation is light, taste lingers for a little while, could drink this bottle and then some, hidden alcohol for the most part, what is there is desirable and a nice smoothness, would like to drink again, would probably age even more, this was a 2007 vintage, recommended"
"D - This stout packs a punch. I'm glad I grabbed this bottle on a recent visit to Wisconsin!!"
"I was super excited to try this and had to wait to feel better after the festivities to truly enjoy it. Pouring this dark brown liquid into my snifter it turned more black when the glass was full. Not much head appeared or remained after a light pour just a nice tan brown ring to remind me. The raisins, dark fruit and milk chocolate really came out in the smell. It also had notes of clove and spicy tobacco. I'm used to the stronger punch-you-in-the-face bourbon barrel beers. This had a nice combination of coffee and bourbon with port in the background. Pleasant amount of ABV not just a wallop. The weight of a stout on my palette without completely killing my taste buds and a nice coffee aftertaste. For what it is, it's fantastically drinkable and I didn't want it to end."
"Mouthfeel is medium heavy bodied and with a good amount of carbonation, slightly thin."
"The label said to use a snifter type glass, so I used a Leffe goblet. Close to opaque black with lots of suspended yeast stirred incessantly by a slow-boil type of carbonation, all of it below the surface, the top of the head all but still. Extremely small bubbles I feel is always a good sign. One finger tan head had good retention and there was a lot of sheet lacing. Smell of spiced raisin, figs, vanilla, sweetness. Taste follows suit, strong flavourful coffee, roast bitter chocolate, nicely blended; the bourbon presence is noticeable more so in the swallow. Very tasty and very well balanced. With air and warming, there is a rich, nutty chocolate coming out. Superb mouthfeel with creamy texture, substantial body, low astringency yet remarkable flavour. This is well worth going out of your way for, thanks Jan for passing a bottle of this along."
"Overall Impression - Good, almost great. I love stouts and I love bourbon stouts. The flavors just weren't as strong as I had hoped for. The drinkability factor on this will keep me coming back."
"(D) A delicious and well brewed beer. This is a ""savor as you go"" beer. No chugging here."
"D: Bourbon barrel stouts are not known for their quaffability. This one is a sipper, and a great sipper at that."
"Thanks again for letting me try this beer. My friends and I really enjoyed this."
"Overall: Great bold flavors in this! Pretty easy to drink considering the style. The bourbon is very noticeable but the alcohol aspect is not overpowering."
"Deep black color with a very small, tan head. Big bourbon aroma and major oak tones to it. Bourbon and oak dominate the flavor. So much ""fresh"" oak i feel like I am gnawing on a chair leg! Very new and fresh tasting when it comes to the oak character. More bourbon then most beers I have had. Sharp, acrid roasted flavor. Ok body, could be heavier for me. Good beer overall. I was not impressed first sip but it really has come into it's own. A real sipper and the oak is a bit much but still a damn fine effort."
"Eerily reminiscent of Bourbon County Stout, but not quite as huge."
"Overall- This is a magnificent beer, good aroma and flavor with an awesome mouth feel. I wish I had a good supply of this beer."
"A very approachable ""big"" stout. Relatively mild for the style yet still packed full of flavor."
"I remember liking this one alot more.. that said, it is still pretty nice.. I just want a little bit more ""stout"" flavors... Thanks again to NFLMVP.. I appreciate it."
"This is a very good bourbon stout and very drinkable as the bourbon is strong but not overpowering. Tasty."
"Notes from: 12/12/05"
"D - For the style, very. Overall, too big."
"Whoo! Is this beer loaded up with da bourbon and beer - it will probably be too much for some. But for me - two thumbs up."
"The mouthfeel is quite a bit lighter than the average bourbon-aged imp, and along with the lack of heat and the subtle barrel-aging, it makes for a suprisingly drinkable and beer. Great balance-- this is definitely one of the better attempts at the style."
"4.5/4/4/4.5/4"
"Taste & mouthfeel: Mildly acidic initially, followed by a strong roasted bitterness. Sweetness is present more in the form of fruit and caramel than the typical chocolate and molasses notes of this style. The body is on the light side, a touch thin for the style. The finish is oddly tannic and vinous. This one tastes like it's in the early stages of infection."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large medium brown faomy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of vanilla and bourbon is dominating with some black chocolate notes. Taste is also a nice mix between some vanilla and bourbon with some black chocolate but without any alcohol ester. Full body with some oily texture and good carbonation. Very well done and well balance overall."
"D: Fantastic! Drinks like a stout with half the abv. I was afraid that its' booziness would get in the way and affect the drinkability. No sir! The alcohol here knows its' place and does what it's told."
"D:Very drinkable for the style and ABV. The bourbon is well balanced and does not dominate this beer as so often happens. Well done."
"D: Sweetness is too intense."
"This stuff is prized here in Wisconsin, so if you get ahold of a bottle, snatch it up. Strong and rich brown head above a pitch black brew. I drink at room temp with a snifter. Rich burbon, cherry, coffee, chocolate flavors witha velverty finish. This beer should be in every true wisconsinites winter emergency kit."
"This one is nearly pitch black with a creamy tan head. Solid retention and spots of lacing down the glass. Good smell with a warming bourbon, that's for sure. There is a light roast and chocolate. Vanilla and light nutty sweetness. Taste is much of the same. Not a huge roast character to this brew, especially up front. Some good malt balance along with the bourbon. Caramel and chocolate, small dose of coffee becoming more pronounced toward the finish. Big vanilla while bourbon flavor isn't overwhelming. Some dark fruits. Light sour dryness in the mouth along with an otherwise more full feel. Seems like something you'd find in a wine or wild ale. Of course it's on lesser volume but it's still present. Overall, quite drinkable. A unique brew that I'm happy to have tried. Thanks go to MuenchenerKindl for the extra long ago...and you're damn straight I spelled your BA name right first attempt!"
"D: Not sure how old this bottle was, but it really doesn't stand up to similar-styled stouts like BCS in any way shape or form. I'm not even sure I'd call this a stout. There's just this lingering acidity and thinness that kind of lets down."
"D: Very drinkable for a barrel aged brew. I really liked it."
"Nice effort from Central Waters...my second favorite of their stouts (after the superb Coffee Stout) I've tried. Well worth seeking a bottle out."
"Pours thick and jet black as it crawls out of the bottle. Head is an inch and a half of dark tan striped with some darker brown notes. Head has nice retention and leaves a solid crown as it fades. Nose is absolutely delicious with strong tones of vanilla bourbon, coconut, leather and carmalized malts. Sweet bourbon and vanilla notes greet the tongue first quickly followed by a sour and tart bite that twings on the back of the tongue. This turns to a lenghty bitter feel that lasts long on the taste buds. Warms the belly well and has a bit of a bourbon bite twords the end of the palate. The sour feel does tone down a bit as it warms. Nicely drinkable overall. Mouthfeel is a bitter, sour battle."
"Great aged stout. Very drinkable, I will search this one out again. I think you must have at least one in the cellar for when the mood strikes"
"Very dark with deep brown edges and a thin cap of fine, tan bubbles. A few soapy bubbles formed a collar and there was a fair bit of streaky lacing. Smells delicious! Big chocolate, toffee, vanilla, oaky aroma, some hazelnut and bourbon, reminds me of a chocolate bar. A bit of roasted grain is in the background. Lots of caramel sweetness in the flavour, bitterness was present but not strong, plenty of oak and bourbon character. Vanilla and chocolate filled out the middle, along with nuts and a light fruitiness. Finished with lingering alcohol warmth and a flash of drying roasted barley. Faint tartness as it warmed. Nice texture, quite smooth with restrained carbonation a little on the creamy side. Quite drinkable and nicely balanced for a barrel aged stout."
"D - this was a tatse treat indeed. probably 2 for a night and I'm done but a tasty two at that."
"D: The abv is so well hidden that I'd gladly enjoy several over the course of a day, assuming that someone will send me a few more bottles."
"If you're a sucker for dark chocolate and/or like bourbon-aged beers, then you need to find this somewhere."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice creaminess and plenty of carbonation. Not as heavy and viscous as many barrel aged stouts I've sampled, but quite nice nonetheless and it makes it easier to imbibe. Overall, a tasty bourbon stout from Central Waters. It's well worth checking out if you're into bourbon barrel aged stouts. I'm glad I still have another bottle."
"D: A likable big stout, that's for certain - and certainly doesn't seem quite as big as the 9.5% listed here. Not one I'd drink all the time, but very good for sipping and savoring. Cut the acid just a little and this climbs even higher on my list...worth seeking out for sure."
"Pours a good head that has unbelievable stickiness. Black color that you can see through a little when held up to the light. The slight smell of bourbon is soft and accompanied by roasty stout flavors. The taste is lighter compared to the Bourbon County '07 I had an hour ago. More light roasty flavors are what I taste with some bourbon aftertaste. Bubbles are kinda harsh. Really a lot of roastiness with much head and some soft bourbon flavors. Overall, ok, I will try next years once and see if I should've had this one right away."
"Poured into a tulip a black color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tan head, some islands and sticky lacing follows. The nose is big on roasted malts, oak/bourbon, vanilla, and chocolate/toffee. The taste is simply delicious, it hits you right in the face with a big bourbon/malt/chocolate/toffee, with some really nice vanilla sweetness. The warmth from the alcohol comes in next, and leaves the tummy nice and warm. Full body, well-rounded brew. Very drinkable, MAN! I wish this was available in Utah. One of the best brews I've had to date, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
"This beer is both unique and delicious. Highly recommended."
"Pours a complete black with a big two finger tan colored head which takes a while to die down. Stickiness is pretty damn good, holds on and won't let go. Smell is a sweet coffee blended with delicious brownie batter. Good oaky/vanilla smells arise as well. Very enjoyable to the nose, can't detect any alcohol. Taste is amazing. Can't say I've tasted anything like this. Such a sweet chocolate-butter flavor with a perfect blend of vanilla. Aftertaste is a nice smooth bourbon flavor, but not booze like. Mouthfeel is a bit lighter bodied that I had anticipated with a bit of carbonation. Very smooth and creamy, god damn this is a good brew. I'll definitely be looking for this one again."
"Compared to the non'aged version, this one feels less alcoholic, which enhanced its drinkability. It is not a remarkable difference but definitely made it better, so I will be aging my future bottles."
"This is almost overwhelmingly ALL bourbon in its character - more bourbon than beer almost. Also tasted are flavours of anise, roasted oats, and especially hazelnut - although I find much of the nuances in the aroma seem a little lost in the taste. All said and done this is delicious. Thanks Steve, this was greatly enjoyed on a rainy, Sunday afternoon."
"I had high hopes for this, and it's a solid offering. Mud Puppy Porter is still my CW favorite..."
"Pours out black with a tan head that retains well; leaves a nice lacing, especially for a high gravity brew. Smell is splendid. A rich scent of bourbon, vanilla bean, chocolate, and roastiness make up the aroma. This is not overdone like almost all other bourbon barrel beers are; it is amazingly well done. Bourbon taste is strong, but smooth; noticeable, but in no way overpowering. Perfectly blend of flavors. Carbonation is a little higher than medium but does a good job holding this one together. Mouthfeel is medium, with a dry, roasty, bourbon-y, and vanilla finish. BA Dark Lord, Kentucky Breakfast, and Bourbon County Stout are just a few examples of very good bourbon aged stouts; the one that comes closest to this one is BA Speedway. Yes, I did just say that, this is the king of bourbon barrel stouts, in my opinion."
"I'm predicting big things for this up-and-coming brewery. This particular entry would make great competition for Irish coffee. It pours so dark it's almost purple, with a nice head. Phenomenal aroma of bourbon and oak, and maybe even a little peat. Really nice bourbon flavor over a chocolatey base. More oak and bourbon in the aftertaste, with a really nice warming sensation."
"I finished off a growler in two nights. I probably could have in one, but I found enough self control to hold back. It keeps you wanting more and I look forward to Central Waters opening distribution into my area (nudge nudge) sometime soon."
"D- This beer has a big bourbon flavor with a little stout hidden underneath. Perhaps it is age or just to light but more stout would be nice."
"I had this back to back with the bourbon barrel cherry stout. There isn't much stout coming through over the bourbon, though more than in the cherry stout. And although the bourbon element is pretty nice, the overall beer isn't as rich as you'd expect from a double stout. There's a mellower, chocolatey, maybe Russian imperial stout taste, while the aroma is of wood and whiskey. Also reminds me a bit of Magic Hat's Chaotic Chemistry in that the whiskey dominates."
"This is an older bottle (as pictured above) from a trade with nflmvp last summer (many thanks, Steve). Poured into a 17-ounce snifter, it sits a glossy dark chocolate brown, bordering on black, with a sticky, fluffy desert-khaki head. Bourbon aromas are prevalent, along with milk chocolate, roasted filberts, vanilla extract, and dried cherries. But that bourbon scent is powerful and more prominent than any other aspect of the bouquet. Good chocolate sweetness up front that yields immediately to a strong bourbon flavor. This is followed by a pleasant woody pucker, a coffee-ish char note, and a final vanilla sweetness. Quite a ride, and the complexity is endearing for sure. It's a bit boozy at first, but this aspect melds well, becoming more integrated with each sip. Body is medium, with a smooth, but no-frills mouthfeel. No coating thickness or syrupy consistency. Not exactly silky, but smooth enough. Drying with the barrel-induced tannins so prominent. A fine bourbon stout, and a must-try for fans of the style. I just received another bottle today from flyingbison, and I'm glad to have another sample for the future."
"I honestly dont know where to start with this one. First off, this is far from a stout. It is a very watery light brown. Clear around the edges. This is more like a barrel aged dubbel. If it was a dubbel it wouldnt be half bad. Other than being water thin, it has an overbearing sour grape flavor going on. Didnt get much bourbon out of it. Plenty of oakiness coming through. I hope this was a bad bottle, because this is nothing that I would seek again. I was expecting a lot more out of this. Instead this will go down as one of the worse beers Ive ever had."
"Hmm, never heard much about Central Waters before. This beer was very black with a decent tan head that quickly faded away. The smell was very heavy on vanilla with a little char. The taste was hevay on the bourbon but not overpowering. Mouthfeel was a little thin. This was a very solid beer but compared to GI Boubon County Stout it falls way short. Still recommended for you stout lovers out there."
"D: Quite a fine brew. Normally I don't like beers in which the bourbon is this noticable, however, the brewers at Central Waters have found a way to combine the stout with the bourbon barrel so that both flavors compliment each other while still retaining their characteristic tastes. Every sip gets better andbetter. Highly recommended."
"Very drinkable, the 9.5% snuck up on me after a couple."
"Excellent, relatively (that word again) easy to drink for what it is. A very flavorful, complex stout. Loved it!"
"It looks like this year's release is using the brown labels found in the picture for the 1-year aged Bourbon Barrel. However, it does not have a green sticker, so is considered the 'regular' awesome instead of the awesome awesome. Place your reviews accordingly."
"Very nicely done. Delicately balanced. Well brewed. Perfectly aged in oak. If I still ate meat I'd pair this with a slightly charred, medium-rare filet mignon, lightly buttered baked potato, and gently caramelized onions. Certainly worth trying."
"This stuff is awesome."
"I'd like to have a few of these lying around."
"D: A fine brew this is. I see why it's a brewer's reserve. Smooth and subtle flavors all mesh together behind vanilla and bourbon notes to give this brew a wonderful overall taste, mouthfeel, and drinkability. One hears bourbon and thinks boozy--no way on this one! Easy drinking."
"A solid beer and one I would love to score again...a great beer to celebrate my 500th review."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This is a full bodied beer. The beer is loaded with boozey alcohol. For some people the boozeyness of the beer would be a negative. I found this to be a very pleasing part of the beer. I am a big guy and sometimes it takes a big beer to please me. I was distressed how quick this beer left my glass. I tried to make myself hold back. I failed! I think this beer is easily as good as some of my favorite Bourbon Barrel Stouts. This could do the Pepsi Challenge with Goose Island Bourbon County Stout and Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout."
"Good drinkability. This one is a true sipper and really warms the stomach. Hard to have much more in a night but something I'll come back to, especially if the weather ever gets colder."
"Mouthfeel is thick and silky smooth with just a slight acrid bite. A wonderful stout but might benefit from just a smidge more sweetness to offset the powerful bitter profile."
"Nice, bold stout. Quite drinkable considering the big body, and booze content. Lots of layers of complexity in this gem."
"Regardless of the mouthfeel, this one was still a welcome beer in my book."
"Originally reviewed on February 18, 2005. 12 Oz bottle. Dark brown black pour with a wine colored fringe and sticky lacing in tan. Weak aroma of vinous alcohol, with a hint of bourbon and berries. Flavor a weak sour cherries, vinous and charred oak. Some sweet and sour sauce, with a light bourbon cascade, over gentle roasted coffee and oak. Coffee is more pleasent and carries the roasted flavors, but this is pretty weak. Ridiculously thin for the style. Smack and finish are a hard bourbon and light oak. Here, theres just too much barrel and not enough beer."
"Overall one to try but more than that you need to judge for yourself."
"The Drinkability is a little slow from the bourbon but oh so good any how.. Many thanks to NFLMVP for sending me this one. Prosit MK"
"Good thing I haven't seen this in six-packs, even though it isn't the ton of bricks I thought it would be. Wait ... yeah, it is. Maybe as close to souped-up stout perfection as I have run into."
"Taste: Weird, on that initial sip, the body felt weak for about half a second but then it totally glazed my tongue like honey on a ham. Just enough oak for my liking, a tiny bit of an acidic twang and some bitter chocolate, with a hot boozy finish. It might even make me want to rethink my misanthropic views about barrel aging just for the sake of barrel aging...If only for stouts!"
"interesting beer"
"I'm loving each drop."
"2008: bottle sourced from msn during my new year's visit, highly roasted with a great barrel presence of bourbon saturated oak well blended into the other aromas and flavors, dry cocoa and dark chocolate, husky charred grain, on the drier side, smooth mouthfeel a touch on the thin side, leaving my scores the same"
"D: Much more vanilla tones than straight up bourbon in this ale. Quite dilectable and easy to drink. Too bad this one is difficult to get."
"Thanks to Stonecrusher for adding this into an already overflowing box."
"I highly recommend this one if you are ever in the Junction City, WI area it would be well worth it to stop and pick up some of this. I do believe it is limited from what it says on the label."
"If anyone has any more bourbon aged brews that they would like to trade, or sell...please let me know. These always seem to be a sure fire winner in my book."
"Pours black with a tan head, appears to not be bottle conditioned. Sweet and sugary smell with bourbon and caramel aromas, some chocolate and some twangy roastiness. A little sweet chocolate up front gives way to the vanilla-cola bourbon barrel taste. Very smooth and creamy as it rolls on the tongue. The finish shows a warm bite of alcohol. Really an outstanding beer , a great example of a bourbon ba beer. If I had to ask for more it would probably be in the body of the beer as I like them as thick and chewy as possible and thought this one was to the heavy side of medium in body. Nevertheless I highly enjoyed this beer and will look for more from Central Waters."
"Notes: I enjoyed this one. I will hope to see it again in the future. I was a bit suprised at how chocolatey the aroma was. But it made the beer a bit tastyier in my opinion."
"M&D - smooth and savory, an amazing stout, super high quality, great tastes, great mouthfeel, super good, thanks a million times over to nflmvp what a beer"
"Heavy hearted beer, full flavoured for sure. The alcohol aftertaste was a tad too much and took away from this beer, however still a treat to sample and I may look for more. I think aging will mellow this bad boy out some. However I do have to say that I let the last 1/3 of the pint sit for about 15 min and the taste was much more subdued and melded better with itself. Definately worth a try for anyone looking to have a full bodied, strong stout."
"12 oz. bottle, no freshness date. Poured very thick into a snifter, immediately releasing the aroma of bourbon through the entire room. This beer is black, no other shades of anthing, pure black. Thin tan head disappears very quickly. Strong bourbon aroma, along with oak, vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and coconut. Nice roasty malt flavor loses quickly in the battle to the onslought of bourbon. Slightly boozy and warming, oaky with more coconut flavors. Low, soft carbonation fits this well. I felt that the bourbon completely took over, and was a bit overwhelming. In short, this needed a bit more stout, and a little less bourbon."
"Drinkability: While I'm not the biggest fan of CW beers, this one was definitely drinkable and one I would seek out in the future. The price might not commend this over the Satin Solstice, but this is one of the nicer bourbon barrel beers I've tried. There are times when I felt like everything going on in the one beer made this a little heavy on the palate, but this might be sessionable for stout or bourbon barrel fan."
"Good thick creamy mouthfeel but some alcohol burn hurts both the mouthfeel and drinkability of this beer."
"Drinkabilty: Simply outstanding. I can't seem to get enough of this amazingly smooth, yet complex BBS. Likely the highest rating I've given to any beer."
"Dark, not quite opaque with a small head on it. Looks fine and dandy. You can smell the bourbon on the nose along with the expected dark fruits and roasty malts. Tasty beer...deep roasted malt flavor with a sweet bourbon finish. nice and thick. drinkable for sure. one of the better bourbon aged beers....a lot of the time it bourbon takes over and sometimes even makes the beer detestable. not so with this one."
"Big beer but with a delicate touch. Can I keep him, Ma?"
"D - The warmth of the 9.5% makes this one difficult to put too many down but it is a great bourbon aged beer. Not as stout like as I expected but one I will look forward to drinking again."
"Perfect as an after dinner drink, or paired with a thicker stock soup."
"drinkability: good"
"thanks to sully for this. shared this with flemdawg in Fl. poured black with brown head that left some lacing. aroma, wow nice big roasted malts and bourbon, chocolate, plums, brown sugar, alcohol, caramel. flavor another wow the bourbon stayed all the way to the finish along with the alocohol, than came the roated malts, carmel didnt show up but got some butterscotch and vanilla. good beer would like to get more of this"
"This is actually much better tasting than I would expect from this mix of flavors. The oak is just light enough that it is pleasant and not too intruding. All of the notes in this beer are on an incredibly subtle level, if only for an Imperial Stout. I think that it is the subtlety of this beer that makes it work. The flavors meld quite well, with none being so dominating as to drown out the other flavors or be objectionable in and of themselves."
"Dark with abundant initial head, bourbon malt and alcohol aroma, and some stout. Very smooth and refreshing with a regular meal. Some coffee, well malted, vanilla, chocolate, prominent and not overbearing bourbon. A lovely beer, courtesy of Captain Couger in Atlanta."
"This is good and interesting but it's not superior. Enjoyable nonetheless."
"Aroma is, oddly, very pineapple smelling with whiffs of chocolate malt. Color is an off cloudy red/brown. Quite un-Imperial looking. Almost no head. Lot of bourbon/wood in the fore followed by that syrupy sweet pineapple again. The bourbon and wood flavors carry all the way through but this is ridiculously light bodied for an Imperial Stout. Very low carbonation as well. Its flavorful it just doesnt taste much like an Impy. More like a tuned up Brown Ale aged on Bourbon barrels."
"Pours a near-opaque black with garnet highlights and a film of off-white bubbles. Nose is potent, as most bourbon-aged beers are, with smoked wood, whiskey, fresh tobacco and espresso. Taste continues with the smokey bourbon, earthy woody notes, sweet caramel malts, and a cosiderable 9.5% alcohol kick. Mouthfeel is actually a little thin, making it rather drinkable, but a little lackluster as well. This is a complex, potent beast of a stout. Worthy of the world's top 12? I'm not so sure, but certainly a well-crafted ADS."
"Central Waters Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout is as big as its name. If you like both stouts and bourbon whiskey, then you'll love this beer. I really hope this isn't a one-off (since changed to 'winter release'), because I'd hate to think this is the only bottle I'll ever have the opportunity to drink. A huge thank you to Skidz for an incredible beer."
"Quite elegant, yet subtle and not all that flavorful considering its style. Rich, deep chocolate and coffee along with deep roasted malts and a lingering finish of dryness of damp wood, expresso and bourbon. Well hidden alcohol. Quite the treat. Thanks Ernest."
"This is a hell of a brewery and this is one of their better ones which is really saying something...I"
"Get it if you see it!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 3/4"" of medium brown head over the opaque dark, dark brown brew. Head retention is good, laces well. Aroma is of coffee and chocolate malts, with an undercurrent of bourbon, as advertised. Taste is pretty evenly split between coffee and chocolate, making for a nicely balance flavor, dark malt-wise. Some alcohol notes ala the bourbon sneak in at the end. Mouthfeel and drinkability is are high, would want to drink this all day for the flavor and feel, even if my head would rue the day in the morning..."
"Thanks for the goods cokes."
"12 ounce bottle, thanks to Skidz and BIF10."
"I'd like to go back to another bottle of this one, for sure! Thanks go surely to that sweetheart cokes, and I nod, too, to drinkin' buddy tavernjef in whose company I reveled in this fine stout."
"Shared with Feloniousmonk received from cokes - Solid deep, dark brown body, black in most light. Small fluffy light brown head sits briefly which resides slowly to a hazy skim and thickly placed strings of lacing. Aroma is beastly large! Oh, how I love these bourbon barrel lovely aged brews. Damn nice whisky aromamtic nose to be found in this glass. Great oaky twinge. Ahhh and behind each wiff sits some terrific notes of soft and dry bakers chocolate. Taste is full of chocolate laced bourbon, nice little burn and edge of bourbon oak barrel singe of heat and sweetness. Feel is well heated and bourbony, good round body thats just beyond medium. Good warmth within and has a bit of spice to finish off the residuals.One fine drinkin' little Bourbon Barrel Stout, a brew to be taken in slowly, but hard to do when its so smooth. Good stuff!"
"Further observations: I've had a good deal of this recently, and I've concluded that some bottles are ""bourbonated"" much stronger than others. It's a predominant factor regardless, and the stronger spirited ones leave a definite impression, though the weaker ones seem to unfold with more roast, dark chocolate, buttered nuts, and espresso, with the whiskey laging behind until the finish. In some ways, that's a plus....and in other ways it is not. The above review is from one of the most heavily bourboned one's I've sampled. Numbers pretty much stay the same regardless."
"Silky smooth in the mouth, carbonation is dead on. Floats around, spreading extra goodness all over. It's one hell of a stout, flavor is everywhere and I'd like to be able to enjoy this more often."
