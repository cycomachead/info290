"Overall – This is a fantastic brew with tons of flavor!!  Deep and dark, but balanced by some nice sweetness.  It is also bourbon boozy but still very drinkable.  Along with this the beer has loads of delicious coffee.  One amazingly flavorful and delicious brew!!"

"EBF sample. Pours syrupy and black. The beer sticks to my sample cup. Aroma is impressive. Coffee and chocolate, both very bold. Maybe a little bit of dark fruit. The flavor is immense and filled with bitter coffee and espresso along with dark chocolate. Faint dark fruit. It's mostly a big one-two punch of coffee and chocolate but it's done very well. Espresso bean finish. Full, thick and oily feel. Some alcohol heat. Great feel with lingering bitterness. I wish I had this on my radar earlier."

"This beer has nice bourbon notes, great chocolate flavor, and is a rich malty beer.  Balance is great.  Right there with BCBS."

"Release #37.  Dark/brown almost black in color with slight ruby red hues around the rim of the glass.  Beautiful oil like viscosity with only a few bubbles in the middle and spotty in nature lacing.  Aroma of cocoa, bourbon, wood, vanilla, coffee and chocolate.  Tastes of strong bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, some burnt sugar, hints of oak and bourbon plus coffee.  Thick, creamy, and smooth on the palate with just a bit of bitterness and burn in the finish.  I must say I found this to be one of the best Imperial Stouts I've had the chance to enjoy.  Well done Epic!"
"The flavor profile is World Class.  It is intense, richly complex and balanced to perfection.  Simply, it is a brewer's masterpiece.  It begins with a semi sweet chocolate over a mild coffee background.  The middle produces a subtle bitterness comprised of dark chocolate, roast and coffee over a sweet background with rich malt notes.  As the middle fades, coffee achieves its most prominent flavor aspect over declining chocolate notes and an ascending bourbon background.  As the finish begins, vanilla and oak notes make a short appearance.  The finish is a slow fade of coffee and roast bitterness over a rich sweetness that is both malt and chocolate in nature.  The only trace of alcohol is the nice light burn at the back of the throat."

"Batch # 36 ABV = 12.4 % . Very nice Imperial  stout brewed with Cocoa Nibs, coffee , aged in whiskey Barrels !!! This is a great stout coffee forward with smooth cocoa dark flavor . Just got better as , I drank it over 2 hours & the last sip was the best !! Wow I will look for more of this A.S.A.P.!! Epic , very well done great job !! Thanks for brewing A Top A++ Beer that will age well with time !!  Love this beer !!! WOW !!!"
"Disappointing. Maybe it was the name or the description, but this one failed to deliver for me."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow. Reminiscent of bomb! or vice versa.  Either way as a fan of RIS,especially barraged  coca coffee influenced, wow. Stoked To pick up more tomorrow. Batch40."
"This is how it ought to be."
""
""
"Medium bodied RIS, but were it really shines though is the medium-light roast coffee beans and the nibs. It is a great blend with the right balance of the two without requiring a milk stout or being overtly sweet."
"Very coffee forward, not much cocoa comes through."
""
"Superb imperial stout. Heavy on chocolate and coffee tones without overpowering alcohol forward. Very well balanced for such high ABV. Batch #35 is 12.4% ABV"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Exceptional smell and taste of coffee."
""
""
"Shared in red solo cups under the shelter on a beautiful Thursday. Opaque black with a thin tan head. Hard to tell much else. Aroma is awesome, cocoa powder, coffee, dark roast, a bit of vanilla. Taste is good but less of a superstar compared to the nose. There’s whisky heat, cocoa and roasted malt sweetness, and coffee bitterness. Medium body, oily texture, moderate carbonation, some heat and bitterness on the finish."

"O- this is a really good ba stout, love the whisky notes, lately this has been easy for me to find, think I'll find some more"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've never tried any other batch but this one is a total winner!"
"Served at 55, very dark brown with thin mocha colored head, smell is not really there at first but opens up after about fifteen minutes, cocoa nibs make the first impression, start to get the other flavors as it warms, don't get much coffee, whiskey really hits toward the end, pleasant hot finish, body is thin for my tastes but overall very nice brew."
""
"overall if you have never tried this beer expect a nice well balanced stout with no overly strong  or offensive flavors.. to spell it out a nice base stout complemented by mild whiskey coffee and cocoa that is quire smooth for .6 abv"
"Great coffee flavor. It's light on the bourbon but overall I love this beer especially because it is very easy to find for me."
""
"Not a very heavy bourbon ... But a nice strong taste of coffee... Overall a great go too beer"
""
""
""
""
"Tried this one on tap and had to buy a bomber of it...great imp stout!  It hits all the classic notes...coffee, chocolate, hint of bourbon and booziness but what stood out to me was the mouthfeel...it's unbelievably drinkable for such a big stout.  The flavors meld so nicely that makes this thing an incredible brew"

"Overall: Amazing, I would buy again. This was release 45 for those counting."
""
""
""
"Big thanks to @tbadiuk for the bottle. A beauty, dark black with a thick mocha head and decent lacing. The nose and taste are big boasting lots of chocolate, espresso, roasted malts, some boozy notes.  Lower in carbonation, but not to a fault, so the beer is smooth, rich and creamy.  Overall, this is a delious beer with an amazing note!"

"Just a hint of the whiskey barrels with a rich coffee flavor and a finish of the chocolate. Smooth drink. Very much enjoyed this beer."
""
""
""
""
"O - Serve closer to room temp to reduce some of the bitterness. Definitely a winter slow sipper."
"Very chocolately.  Almost burnt or bitter. Interesting. I prefer less chocolate but I'm not a chocolate lover."

"This is a very well made Imperial stout. Very balanced with a good hint of the coffee. Not so much barrel smell and the cocoa nibs....i did not notice them..."
""
""
""
"Bomber. Batch #37. First impression is that it smells like bourbon county coffe. Well as much coffee, maybe not as much bourbon. But as close as it gets to a perfect coffee stout. Taste, although still good, is a bit of a letdown. Mild chocolate, sweet bourbon, coffee (which worked much better on the aroma) and bitter vanilla. Average to maybe on the tho side for such a big beer."
""
""
""
""
"Started out ok - but as it got warmer the taste diminished greatly and the alcohol took over."
""
""
"I'm not usually a imp stout fan but this is very tasty and complex. Kudos"
""
"O – Prominent coffee and dark malts with lots of barrel character.  This beer seems to be exactly what it wants to be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - 4.50 - Definitely an A imperial stout, one of the better ones I've had in a long time. Stuff is a bit uncommon, but if you can get your hands on it and are a fan of the style, I highly recommend buy a couple to set back and age!"
""
""
""
"Great Beer.  Look forward to getting more of this in the future."
"This is one big beer in terms of taste, feel, and effect! Poured black as black can be and thick with minimal head. The 11.7%abv wasn't hidden at all and smacked you with each swig. Notes of roasted cocoa beans, dark chocolate and vanilla(?) were there along with the alcohol. As it got warmer in the glass, the bite got bolder. All in all, I enjoyed this bad boy from the folks at Epic, just glad I was safely at home as this one easily brought out the drunkard in me:)"
"First beer from Epic and it's a big winner.  Can't get this where I live, wish I would have bought a second.  Don't know if all the releases are this good, but you should buy it if you see it."
""
""
""
"Overall- A unique bourbon barrel offering, good but not one of my favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is an excellent beer!  I love the strong flavors of malt, dark chocolate and dark molasses/brown sugar-like sweetness as well as the creamy mouthfeel.  Delicious!"
""
""
""
""
"One of the best BBL Stouts I've had this year. Incredible smooth and rich yet bp very drinkable with just enough barrel influence."
""
""
"Overall: This is a really nice, balanced but big stout. Vanilla is the biggest flavor here, which is interesting considering that it was brewed with cocoa nibs and coffee. Nice balance of sweetness. (4.25)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"From start to finish this beer is purely enjoyable. The aroma swirls between chocolate and coffee as it enters the nose. On the taste, I get chocolate as it transforms into coffee, and finishes with the hints of bourbon and barrel. This is fully bodied and coats the back of the throat. An enjoyable after taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I love how this beer's smell hangs on almost to the last sip. I also love how the taste does not belie the great smell. I usually look for 12 oz version of beers coming in a 750 ml bomber. It may sound like heresy, but  this is a beer that i wish the bomber would be larger. Great balance. Recommended!"

"Thick like cough syrup. Cocoa and coffee. Leads bitter and finishes sweet. Very little/no alch bite. Lovely. One and done."
"best i've had yet, to me it's better than bourbon street. my bottle says release #36 12.4% and cen# 2111 if i'm reading this correctly"
""
"Sweet chocolate flavor. Thicker beer."
""
""
""
""
"This is a solid stout for the money. Coffee forward with chocolate and a notable hoppiness. The whiskey barreling is obvious, but doesn't lead to an overly boozy taste. Sticky consistency that hangs in the back of the throat. Overall, I wouldn't put B.B.B. among the best, but rather one of the better B.A. stouts you're going to find for $$."
""
""
""
"I had this on my wish list for a long time and the wait was worth it.  Batch 44."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cocoa, cappuccino, bourbon, it's got it all. Absolutely delicious."
"The holy grail of all stouts ever created. Tastes like liquid cocoa puffs with just a little bit of coffee and booze. This one went down in just a matter of minutes, it was that good. Way better than any other stout I've had, even better than world class BCBS in my opinion. Will be buying this WHENEVER I see it. Never in a million years would I have guessed that it was 11.5% ABV. almost too easy to drink. Batch #48 I believe."
""
""
"O - outstanding stout, could be a little too much coffee though"
""
""
""
"Espresso, french press and just about any coffee complexity attacks the taste buds with milk chocolate and bitter cocoa notes. The barrel does just enough to make me appreciate it along with the roasted grains but I think the coffee is just a bit too strong here. Damn tasty but you can see how much more could be done."
"Smell is amazingly coffee and taste is out of this world."
""
""
""
"O - Good, excellent coffee+cocoa, 10% is wha?, just wish there was more going on."
""
"Not as complex as I like my BBA but a nice drinkable coffee and chocolate forward stout The coffee hides the high abv well."
""
""
""
""
"I drank batch 27. Heavy on chocolate and coffee. Little bourbon vanilla and dark fruits too. Really good beer."
"Overall, she is someone you would probably lust for."
""
"Very lucky to have tried this one. A friend brought it back from a Vegas trip. Pours black. Smells awesome. Has a charred and burnt taste that is delicious. The coffee or chocolate has been toasted/roasted or something. This adds a very unique aspect to the beer that I haven't had in other stouts. Super thick going down. This is one that I was said when I hit the bottom of the bottle. There are lots of strong stouts that I love but could not have on a regular basis. This one however could be enjoyed regularly because it is so unique and not overpowering."
""
""
"Black as night with no penetration to light.  A minuscule layer of khaki colored foam covers the majority of the top.  Brussels lacing.  I smell very bitter coffee similar to iced coffee.  The coffee flavor is like very bitter iced coffee similar to coffee bender,but the whiskey and chocolate notes are sweet and cut the bitterness.  The mouth is thick and chewy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Looking forward to trying more of this series."
""
""
"Pours black with a 1 finger think dark tan head.  Smells of whiskey, bitter/dark chocolate, dark roast malts and mocha.  The whiskey barrel aging plays a dominant role in the initial flavor followed primarily by very dark roast malts with a bit of burnt/char flavor.  Also has a nice dark chocolate flavor.  As it warms up I get a creamy mouth-feel, some oak flavors, the whiskey flavor becomes a little less dominant, retains a sweet booziness that is not overpowering but still ever-present, vanilla and more complex coffee flavors.  Medium carbonation with a medium body.  Dark/burnt malts in the aftertaste with some more chocolate layers.  Incredible improvement with warming, my rating creeped up from high 3's to low 4's as it sat."
""
""
"O-  I loved this offering, probably one if my top 5 coffee stouts.  It's hard to imagine getting much better than this, but there are just a couple I can think if that rival this.  Outstanding job by Epic and I look forward to this again."
""
"Gives me goosebumps. Not the good kind. Flat."
"Not that good tasting of a stout"
""
""
""
"Deep black body, creamy chestnut head. Nose is spectacularly rich, a candy store of molasses, caramel, toasted marshmallow, and dark chocolate. Give it a sip, though, and you've got a lot more than that...especially first off, as warm, woody bourbon flavors comes rippling over the front end. Keep sipping and you see that the palate stays in that mode, condensed, powerful, but adding layer upon layer as the drink goes on: first chewy, chocolate-covered fruit, then crisp, smoky, and toasty (think chocolate-covered pretzel), and finally finishing with the spice of clove and fresh ginger. In all, this is a gorgeous beer. The only problem I have is that, like I said before, it really doesn't expand. It's a concentrated experience, never quite as full-bodied and lingering as other top contenders in its class. But still, just because it isn't the best, that doesn't mean that what's contained in this bottle isn't pure magic. Overall, this stout is nothing less than extraordinary. Cheers!"
""
"O: Excellent BA stout; I like that the beer does not try to hide its booziness. My only complaint is that it left a slight bitter taste in my mouth; flavors up front were awesome."

"Poured from a 22oz bomber.  Dark impenetrable black with a little head.  Aromas of coffee.  Tastes of coffee with background of dark, unsweetened chocolate.  Goes down smooth.  You do notice the bourbon on the way down or even more in the aftertaste but not overwhelming.  Subtle.  Solid stout but I don't think it is anywhere near a 97 rating.  Very good though."

"Nice stout. Good coffee flavor. Nice beer, but nothing exceptional."
""

""
"I liked it"
""
"Thick dark black pour with no head. Smells like cocoa and coffee beans. Not much alcohol smell at all. Big thick mouthfeel. Tastes like a chocolate covered espresso bean. Minor hints of whiskey. No alcohol taste. Terrific beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
"22 oz  Bomber poured into a 20oz Firestone glass.Jet black color.The smell is mostly chocolate up front.Taste is more Coffee up front with a hint of Chocolate.Nice smooth taste and a very drinkable brew.Can`t say that I think it`s worth the high Rating it gets or the big price tag{14.99} for 22 oz.But if your in the mood to try something new it`s a good one timer.Probably would not drink again because there are a lot of good stouts out there a lot cheaper."

"O: this is an incredible beer. I'll definitely be seeking this out again."
"It's blended very well, allowing the coffee and roasted malt to comprise the bulk of it with some light hints of barrel character lingering in the background. Overall this is very nice and i'll look for it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Lots of coffee and a bit of chocolate. Roasted malt aroma is quite strong.  Pours dark mahogany, cloudy, lost of lace on the sides of the glass.   A bit of toffee.  Sticky sweet to start, then bitter into the finish.  A bit on the thin side.  Lightly carbonated.  A tad dry.  But, it packs a good finish."

"4.64/5: And there we go, I just found my Best Beer of 2014™"
""

"All around coffee-bomb. Super dark roasted coffee flavor drowns out the whiskey-barrel completely! The dark bitter coffee smell is pretty much exactly what I'm getting on the tongue as well with a little bit of dark chocolate goodness and some hints of vanilla. Mouthfeel is chewy with medium-low carbonation. Glad to be a coffee fan or this probably wouldn't be for me. Batch #41."
""
""
""
""
"O: Tons of chocolate and coffee, very dessert like. Put this beer in your mouthhole if you haven’t tried it - it’s a tasty beer for sure just not my thing. Would have liked more barrel and less sweetness."

"O:  A really nice beer.  Nothing jumps out or dominates.  The bourbon, coffee and chocolate are well integrated.  The beer is almost too smooth w/o any high notes.  Can a beer be too well integrated? This opinion might be a consequence of trying Lost Abbey Deliverance two nights before."

""
""
""
""
""

"O - Well balanced chocolate and bourbon.  Smooth and drinkable for such a big beer.  Nice."
"Probably one of the best stouts I've ever had. Thought that the first time I tried it, and now I'm having it again and saying the same thing."

"Winter night, instead I got waves of the classic 'coffee on the burner for too long' then got cold.In fairness, this was an issue with the batch I received (#25) It is exceptionally drinkable at 11.8% would like to try again, it tastes like it didn't stay in the barrel long at all~"
""
"To me this is a great example of brewers using bourbon barrel aging to improve a stout, but not feature the bourbon barrel as an up front experience.  The beer is deliciously roasted with beautiful coconut notes and not a sharp edge anywhere.  Highly recommended."

"Absolutely delicious!  Aromatic, chocolate, coffee, maybe hint of tobacco in the smell.  Taste is thick, creamy slightly chocolatey.  Got just a hint of booze awhile into the glass.  Surprisingly one of the best American Imperial Stouts I've ever had.  Cheers!"

"An excellent stout, combining just about everything a stout-head could possibly want: chocolate, coffee, and barrel aging. They pull it off quite well, too. If this isn't right up there in the top tier of BA stouts (BCBS, Parabola), then it's just a notch below."

"Tried both 2014 versions side-by-side at Epic's ""Tapless Tap Room"" in Salt Lake City. This was my first barrel-aged imperial stout. I see everyone stating that it is a step below many of the greats. Well, I am going to have to try those as soon as possible, because this brew was exceptional. The Cafe Ibis version was mellow, the CharmingBeard coffee version was more intense. Both were the two best Utah beers I have ever had."
"A nice effort from Epic, with some pleasant notes (on the nose and palate) of chocolate, coffee and light bourbon.  While this pales in comparison to the big boys of the bourbon barrel aged RIS world, this was still an enjoyable RIS, and one I was glad to try."
"Review of 2014 version, approximately 1 month old.  Poured 22oz Bomber into a snifter.  Poured a thick dark black, with a thin khaki head.  Nose  was a roasted coffee blast with sweet vanilla, caramel and toffee undertones.  When cold, strong coffee flavor present, but as it warms vanilla, oak and bourbon burn took over.  Caught a hint of raisin and cherry in its sweetness.  Mouthfeel was full, but not syrupy.  Overall a very enjoyable beer. Very complex, but a step below the ""greats""."

"Wow...  This was insanely drinkable for the 10%+ abv...  Complex blend of roasted malt flavor plus cocoa, coffee and finishes with smooth, low-key bourbon notes.  Barrel aging doesn't take anything away from the sum of the parts that make this beer so enjoyable.  Great flavors, with no one component over-played / out of balance.  Dense aroma and great feel, too,  Will try to get this one again, for sure!"
"Overall:  I forgot to write down the batch number, but this had been sitting on the shelf at the store for at least 2 years.  Still was a very tasty big stout that stands beside the bigger names."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It's a good imperial stout, but the coffee and chocolate are a little dominate and there aren't noticeable whiskey or oak flavors present.  Not quite great, but has the potential.  I'll keep my eye on the other BBB releases.  Prost!"
""
"This is like an adult frapaccino...huge coffee and chocolate flavors with a thickness and mouthfeel that is like oatmeal....A+."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the beer that KBS wants To be I know they use different barrels whiskey v. bourbon but The chocolate and coffee and whiskey blend together here instead of being at harsh contrasts.  This is a nice beer but if you are looking for BCBCS this doesn't have the exquisite mouthfeel although leaps and bounds ahead of KBS."

"O- this was consumed with a couple of years aging on it and it's held up just fine.  The aroma was out of this world and the flavors seemed to mesh after some aging.  Barrel notes aren't as pronounced as some BA Imperial Stouts, but this is a very well made beer"

"Overall (4.0), a really nice barrel-aged beer. I'm happy to have been able to try this one, but since it's ultimately no easier for me to get than any of my favorite, hard-to-acquire barrel-aged imperial stouts, I'm not likely to have it much moving forward. At the very least, it has me curious to try some of Epic's other offerings, as this was my first."

"Picked this up from a great trade with Evan.  Release #12, July 6, 20133.  Thick pitch black pour with a one finger caramel colored head with decent retention and great lacing.  The nose is rich and roasty with huge coffee notes along with hints of dark chocolate, espresso, cocoa, bourbon, and subtle smoke.  The taste follows suit, with the coffee once again being the star.  Hints of bourbon, cocoa, dark chocolate, espresso, vanilla, subtle piney hops, and a touch of licorice.  The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, smooth and velvety, with excellent balance and huge drinkability.  Overall, this is one of the best coffee stouts I've tasted.  Definitely in the same league as Founders Breakfast and Bourbon County Coffee."

"Overall. Price was more than right. My only comment is that I felt the whisky taste was a bit lower than I would like... but I like a boisterous amount of whisky with my imperial stout. This is pretty well cut across the board other than the coffee taking the spotlight. Not to heavy not to continue drinking and enjoying, which is great. I would buy this again, hands down, to really break the craving for a solid imperial stout. Apparently ages just fine, too. It may have lost some of the cocoa nib... but it is still excellent."

"Overall: I had one of these fresh, but didn't take notes; my memory is that I liked it better then. This is okay, but I'd rate it behind something like (the admittedly very solid) Stone Espresso IRS. With more barrel presence and less of those slight off-notes, it could be very good, but as it is, it's merely okay."

"O: Outstanding imperial stout. A much different beast than say BCBS but no less enjoyable."
"Big Bad Baptist is an amazingly tasty and complex imperial stout. While most flavor-infused, barrel-aged stouts tend to be high ABV monsters, this beer managed to be surprisingly drinkable yet immensely interesting. Fans of Coffee BCBS should definitely seek this out."
""
""
"Thick, dark pour with hanging lace. Aroma is sweet cocoa, heavy and intense. Flavor is very good; rich cocoa, chocolate, rye, strong coffee, nice whiskey overtones play wonders. Very robust yet remarkably easy to drink. One of my favorite barrel aged stouts, wish i had 12 of these!"

"Release #13. Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is jet black, thick and oily on the pour, with a halo of light brown head. It just looks thick and big. Terrific. The aromas are bittersweet, with notes of cocoa nib, coffee, vanilla, bourbon, woody notes, crème, and earthy highlights. This smells huge and layered. Flavors are very robust, with a heavy roasted character, solid cocoa nib backbone providing sweetness and bitterness, coffee highlights, a solid blast of whiskeyand booze that supplies a building warmth, earthy notes, and a steady flow of spice throughout. This is a beast. Very layered flavor profiles throughout. The body is robust, smooth, almost velvety. The aftertaste is heavily roasted, with cocoa nib, whiskey, and subtle crème. The finish is smooth, with a subtle boozy edge, and an overall dry, lingering feel. Solid, big, monster of a beer. This was a workout! Fantastic!"

"Was a little disappointed with this beer. For a barrel aged beer I didn't get any heat from it. Instead the coffee notes where the highlights in this one. mouth feel was a little thin but the carb was right on. Overall the beer was decent and if the label didn't indicate it was aged in a whiskey barrel, I would have gave it a better rating."

"Overall this is an OK beer. I can't taste ANY whisky as this is supposed to be aged in whiskey barrels. Just does not taste like a barrel aged stout. The coffee makes this stout nice and is the highlight here. I always try to drink a coffee stout soon as coffee fades quick and maybe if it was aged more flavor would have came out from it but this is just not anything like a BA Stout. It's not a bad stout by any means but just not anything special that I would buy again. I heard some hype for this and am just not getting it."

"Big on coffee – actual gives a bit of a caffeine buzz. Huge body, too; this could pour over vanilla ice cream. But the chocolate and whiskey are mostly missing under all that java. A monstrous stout that needs to lay."

"O/D - A little odd. The coffee and chocolate were a bit subdued. Left me wanting more from this beer. Complex and nice all things considered. Barrel took over a touch too much."
"O- robust stout with alot of coffee flavors barrel taste is very faint would have liked more"
""
""
""
"Overall: Definitely a little disappointed here, especially after how much I loved the Imperial Stout from the Exponential Series. This beer is so coffee forward that it stifles everything else going on. And where is the barrel character? Despite those two things this is still a really good stout. Looking forward to sitting on the second bottle I have for a good long while and seeing what happens."

""

"O - One of the quintessential coffee beers of our time, Big Bad Baptist is an exercise in oddly tamed excess - it's over the top but neither cloying nor fatiguing. It's time in the whiskey barrels almost goes unnoticed behind the bold coffee and chocolate flavor but the alcohol hint, charred oak, and wink of whiskey flavor come together flawlessly for an imperial stout everyone must try."

"A big amount of alcohol and whiskey flavor without too much sweetness. This definitely is up there with my favorite barrel aged stouts. It is different from other barrel aged beers with their silky, sweet, vanilla, and bourbon character. This has those complexities, but with more alcohol and a more restrained sweetness. One of my new favorite barrel aged brews."
""
"Also, I really like how Epic has information on their website for each individual batch of beer they do for some of their bigger beers. A nice touch for the beer geeks out there!"
""
"I'd consider this beer almost perfect, but the one thing I have to slightly ding it for is a hint of odd, almost plasticky flavor I get with the lingering whisky. I think it's just a characteristic of the whisky doing something funny and it is only mildly noticeable, but without that, I think I'd give this a 5 in taste and mouthfeel."
""
""
"Served on tap at the brewery in Denver. Pours a pitch black with viscous apperance and dark brown head. The nose is amazing, freshly brewed bold coffee is oozing with light notes of whiskey and roasted malts in the background. Vanilla and chocolate are also present. Taste matches the nose. Coffee up front, smooth notes of vanilla and chocolate with mild whiskey at the end. The barrel aged character is well integrated with the base beer. Mouthfeel is silky smooth with mild carbonation. Overall, this is an under the radar beer for sure. It can be found on shelves pretty easily, but the taste is right up there with many of the beers that never see the light of a shelf."

Nose a rich cream coffee (maybe some mocha) - this review woulda been a 5, but don't want to make a single jump that high.  Taste similar to nose, feel still decent but nothing special, enjoyment high."

""
""
""
"O - One of the most coffee forward stouts that I have had. I have had many and this one is brilliant and well done. I recommend this and it best consumed fresh if you like strong coffee."

"Batch #22. A very nice coffee and chocolate Russian Imperial Stout. What I don't get are any whiskey barrel notes. Unfortunate, as I love those flavors. Luckily, the coffee and chocolate notes as well as the base beer itself are all rock solid- I just wonder how amazing this would be with a real Bourbon note as well. The coffee is obviously top notch, as is the cacao. You het each in almost equal measure, perhaps just a tad more coffee. The base beer itself shows off a nice roasty note. Silky smooth, and beautifully integrated. Very Nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Didn’t get a lot of bourbon in this, maybe a touch in the aftertaste, but I think the roastiness is stronger than the sweet bourbon element you usually expect. Overall, it is a well done dark chocolate coffee bomb. Glad to have the next day off, might want to share this bomber next time."
"Pairing- A juicy ribeye or NY strip. Might overpower a center cut filet."
"A great beer and a must try if you enjoy coffee in your stout. I'd love to try it fresh in hopes of capturing the barrel notes."
""

""
""
""

"O: Still remarkable for its huge scent and flavor, although I remember it enthralling a bit more from the keg."
""
""
"I agree with others below that this was like a coffee stout and not much else. I didn't get any barrel characteristics and it tasted like a cup of black coffee with a shot of scotch poured in. Almost no sweetness and very little complexity. This has nothing on BCBCS or KBS. Founders regular Breakfast Stout is even more enjoyable than this and its too bad because I had high expectations."
""
""
""
"I feel I had to review this just because it seems fairly batch dependant. This was batch #27 and it was a coffee bomb. While I love coffee in beers this was more of a coffee with beer in it, somewhere? So take my end number with a grain of salt. It poured a very nice black with an off white head that was a little too pop like for me with next to no lacing. The smell was the best part of this beer, it smelled like a coffee shop, lovely. Too bad it tasted like a cup of coffee, very little cocoa and no whiskey barrel. it came across a little thinner than I like but nice. Overall this beer was OK. Would try again just not batch #27"
"OVERALL: This is actually a really good coffee stout. As a BA cocoa and coffee stout it is definitely lacking, but as a coffee stout, it's great. The cocoa are way outplayed here and the whisky barrel aging is pretty minimal at best, but it's still really tasty and enjoyable. Take the scores with a grain of salt, as I'm reviewing to the label specification. This is a quality imperial coffee stout, nevertheless. Recommended."
""
"I have had Epic's Big Bad Baptist several times from a bomber, but this review is based on my experience having it on tap at Freshcraft in Denver. I had not been overly impressed with Epic Brewing based on my prior limited experiences with their Brainless Belgian-style golden ale and one of their IPAs; however, the Big Bad Baptist came along and converted me with a spiritual awakening that any evangelical Southern Baptists would envy. The Big Bad Baptist pours a deep dark brown/black with a thin brown head. The smell is reminiscent of freshly brewed dark coffee with hints of mocha and vanilla, but the coffee scent definitely dominates. The taste is more righteous than Jesus Christ himself dressed in his Sunday best. Huge dark roasted coffee notes, espresso, bittersweet and milk chocolate cocoa nibs, creamy vanilla, oak, some faint whiskey notes, and some hop bitterness lingering in the background. It has a medium thickness with some creamy vanilla essence in the body that compliments the bitter dark coffee and dark chocolate notes. A beautiful combination of coffee, chocolate, and vanilla flavors. I would not have guessed that the Big Bad Baptist clocked in at 12+% ABV. One of my all-time favorite coffee imperial stouts."

"Pour is extremely dark brown, almost black, with a small amount of tight light brown head. Nose is quite big, tons of very clean coffee with a faint roast and rich malt backbone. Taste is also strong coffee, clean and virtually no acrid flavor whatsoever. The roast is light and there is a nice malt backbone of caramel and rich fudge. Body is quite full with a strong carbonation and soft palate. Finish has some lingering roast and some scorched barrel with notes of whiskey booziness intermingling down the throat."

"As a big coffee stout, this is pretty good. As a beer that I anticipated to have a nice barrel presence and a shelf barrel bomber at that, I honestly can't say for sure that this beer ever saw a barrel. What's confusing, a perhaps a bit deceptive, is that early vintage listings show barrel aging, but then the barrel designation goes missing. Yet, the bottle still claims it. Is this actually a barrel aged stout? I'm not convinced."
""
""
"Pours black. Medium creamy brown head, fairly lasting with lace. Aroma is loaded with coffee, dense coffee with cream and sugar, milk chocolate, cocoa, sweet roasted malty, just an awesome coffee character. Flavor still has coffee but not as overt, nice sweet whiskey, clean roast, chocolate. Medium to full body. Creamy. Pleasant alcohol warmth. Not quite as complex as I would hope for but stilt very very good. Whiskey barrel character shows up more and more with each sip, especially in the finish, overall stays in the background."

"O- a great coffee stout. I would pick up other releases to compare."

"Overall - Not terribly impressed. Very spicy."
""
""
""

"A very drinkable, smooth and soothing imperial stout. Deep and complex flavors and feel throughout."
""

""

"Overall: This was a bit of an odd beer to rate. I scored this fairly high since it is a very good coffee stout, however I'm a bit let down considering the lack of barrel presence coupled with the price paid for the beer. If you're looking for a good coffee stout, then this is probably worth a try (though there are better options for cheaper), but I can't recommend this as a great bourbon/whiskey barrel aged stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a black body with one finger head that died slow with lace patches. Aroma is standard but contains alot as I get roasted and coffee malts, some bready (or biscuit) malts, dark chocolate, hints of vanilla and woodiness but surprisingly not a real boozy aroma. Notice the same thing in the beer - the alcohol is well-hidden in this beer and never leaks out, not even as beer warms and smoothes. In fact, for a ""double"" stout, this beer is incredibly smooth and easy to drink and has a great balance that seems to actually tip from the dry/roasted/coffee malt notes to the sweeter, dark chocolate, vanilla, hints of toffee sweet tastes (not too complex as I don't get any ""dark fruits"" that sometimes slip in these beers). Since I like my stouts a little less dry/heavy with touches of more sweetness this beer hit the spot."

"This is a wonderful stout. The coffee really shines and can go toe to toe with almost any coffee brew. The coffee flavors makes you forget this was even aged in whiskey barrels. Lots of depth to this one. It's extremely enjoyable. Highly recommended."

"Sweet Jesus Mr. Baptist... Dunk my head in your glorious black pool of yeast splooge and I promise to never tell anyone... so long as you're on tap."

"O- A very good stout and a pretty good barrel aged one. I don't think this is aged long enough to become very complex and, as it is, remains just a great base stout with some added whisky flavor. I enjoyed how it reminded me of an Irish coffee and I guess $12 for a barrel aged bomber is pretty good. Having said that I could probably replicate the taste for cheaper by adding a shot of whisky to a FBS, actually think I'll try that soon."
"O-A bit disappointed in this one. A decent coffee stout, but if it didn't say BBA on the label I wouldn't have know it was. They must have flashed aged it in the barrels. Would try other releases to see if there is any variance, but not this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours out pure onyx with a half finger of mocha head. Straight-up you get coffee wafting towards your nose and your mouth begins to water. When you stick your schozz into the glass you pick up other scents of whiskey/barrel, roast and chocolate. The beer hits the palate with a silk-like quality and the flavors spread quickly throughout the mouth. Despite the 12% ABV there is virtually no burn with the intake of this brew. Despite the fact that I've had several Big Bad Baptists, I think this may either be my favorite batch, or they are really hitting the mark."
""

"Very mellow but enjoyable imperial stout. Definitely smell and taste the coffee notes which I enjoy, but let intense, less bold than other stouts. A very strong IMP stout, but reserved in how bold any 1 flavor could be. GREAT mouthfeel however. Smooth as a beach rock."

"Poured a deep black with a thin ring of tan head. It looked quite true to style, with perhaps a bit too thin a head, but it was fine, still quite nice looking. Scents of rich black coffee upfront, as it warm dark cocoa comes out and combines with the coffee. It's very coffee forward, but it does bring forward some cocoa. It's a very nice scent for a coffee lover. Taste follows the nose. Rich black coffee, some dark cocoa, rich bittersweet chocolate, slight milk chocolate, cocoa nibs, roast malt and faint hints of alcohol. It's very well done, very cocoa and coffee forward, fitting a beer brewed with coffee and cocoa nibs. It's nice, quite nice, though not as balanced as some other Imperial Stouts. Mouthfeel is thick bodied with moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Quite a nice feeling, very much a sipping beer. Overall this is another excellent RIS. It's much more a coffee stout than some others, but it is quite nice, less balanced but very well done if you like coffee and dark cocoa. I recommend it."

"Overall: It runs for around 12 bucks a bomber and well worth it. I would recommend splitting it with a friend. One of the better beers I have had in recent history. The only reason I didn't write more is because I was rating with skyping with a friend and I'm sick of writing things after spending so much extra time writing science grants."

"O- This is a great fall/winter BA stout beer to buy during the holidays. Denver does not get as many as the Midwest does; so I need to stock up on these brews."
""

"O: I really enjoy the monstrous nature of the beer, and enjoy how complex and well balanced it is overall. Despite all that is going on, the beer is smooth for such beast, and really enjoyable. This is definitely a stout worth seeking out, and its cool that it varies slightly each edition."
"O: exceptional brew! Love the slight bitterness from the nibs!"

"Had release #13, great beer with good balance of chocolate, coffee and grain bill. Whiskey barrel comes through with smoothness more than aroma or flavor. Alcohol at 12.2% is present, but not over whelming. A little sweet and buttery on the tongue, but overall a great production from Epic."
""
""
""
""
"The beer is dark brown, nearing blackness. Atop the beer rests a half inch of dense, beige head. Aromas of roast, chocolate, spice, coffee, espresso beans, cocoa powder. Fabulous flavor following the aroma. Strong and potent coffee character without dominating the flavor profile. Medium to full-bodied with fairly low carbonation. Smooth on the palate with alcohol content very well hidden. A top-notch Imperial Stout."
"Pours black with a thin dark khaki head. Dark roasted coffee right up front in the nose. Also lots of chocolate with vanillia, oak, and smoked toffee. This thing has a certain smokeyness in the aroma. The chocolate comes out up front in the taste leaving the coffee to play second fiddle. You get a bit of the whiskey notes in the middle of the mouth, in the form of smokey oak. This thing is very rich, lots of bold flavors. The mouth feel is full bodied. ABV is slightly noticeable, but for the percentage it excellent. This one makes for a perfect desert beer or even a late nightcap. All the flavors are there, they don't blend together very well but instead sit on their own."
""
""
"O-This is a well-done, but not extraordinary, coffee imperial stout. I could use a little less coffee ground scent in the smell, but if you like your java dark and higher in acidity, this brew should appeal. The taste is more balanced, and the milky cocoa and vanilla/bourbon caramel provide a nice counterpoint to the coffee. Nice, heavy mouthfeel, too."
"Pours a black body with a tan, almost caramel colored head. Good retention, sticks around for a bit and recedes into a 1/4 in layer of creamy goodness. Smells like coffee grounds in the garbage. Getting some rotten vegetables on the nose too, seriously. This smells like a trashcan in a coffee shop. Taste is pretty good, getting the coffee, dark malts, toffee, chocolate, but that damned rotten vegetable composted coffee smell permeates the experience. Mouthfeel is good, consistant with an imperial stout. Overall I feel cheated. I'm not sure if I got a bad bottle or what. Flavors were spot on, but the smell was pretty horrible. For now my rating stays, but I want to revist this in hopes it was some sort of terrible mistake..."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a fantastic version of the style, one that I picked up on a whim after my wife suggested it. Hadn't had much from Epic before, coming from the east coast. I was very pleasantly surprised and would happily pay another 10-12 bucks for this. Good on a cool, wet fall night."

"With so much roast character, the sweet malt character could actually be quite a bit bigger here; to be well balanced, either the roasted / burnt notes need to be dialed back or the sweet / residual malt character needs to be increased. Still this is actually quite a tasty brew and I really like how subtle the Whiskey Barrel character is here; it really only plays a supporting role and could almost be overlooked. I am on the verge of getting a cold & this is certainly a good beer to kick off the fact that I am going to be on a self-imposed beer drought for the next week to recover. Despite being aggressively burnt in focus, I am actually enjoying this a fair amount; it could be so much more acrid and harsh than it is & it somehow is escaping that. I really like that this isn’t overly heavy or rich, on the other hand it makes it easier to drink a beer that is 11.1% abv, which isn’t necessarily a good thing either."

"Tons of creamy milk chocolate head is achieved with a vigorous pour (about three fingers actually). Body is the 3000 mile used motor oil standard. Nose is well, Wow! The coffee plays huge here. Really fresh ground coffee of the very fine variety. Fresh chocolate cake is there also, hold the icing. Very nice aroma. With first sip the coffee dominance continues. The coffee is just so bright and flavorful. Rich and succulent just like that perfect morning cup. The bourbon really is hard to find in this beer, maybe it could use just a little more time in the barrels. This may stand as the most pure coffee forward beer that I have ever had the joy of having. Other flavors include molasses, black cherries and bitter dark chocolate. What more can I say, the flavor, the finish, and the feel are just a coffee and stout lovers dream. I may have just found my new favorite morning brew."

"Pours a thick viscous black, very little soapy head, intense sugar, barrel, coffee aroma, flavor repeats and doesn't disappoint. Totally integrated flavors, nothing seems out of balance."

"A very nice beer. I wish I could find a bottle of this to enjoy."

"Pours dark black with a 3 finger mocha colored head. Smells heavy of coffee and chocolate, almost no whiskey scent at all. Tastes pretty much follow the nose, coffee, chocolate, roasted malts. Mouth on this one is good, perfect carb, not too thick, not too thin. Overall this is a good coffee stout, it's just lacking the barrel that I expect to smell and taste on a good BA stout. My bottle has been aged for around 8 months so maybe that has something to do with it. I'd like to get another one of these and see how they differ from batch to batch."

"pours black with thin khaki head, smells roasted malty and strongly of coffee. medium low carbonation, smooth on the palate. Taste overwhelmingly of coffee! Great River's ""redband"" coffee stout is nothing compared to this! tastse like cup of black coffee with no sugar or cream, i wouldn't be surprised if there was 50% or more coffee in this one! no booziness at all or cocoa that i can pick out. the bourbon is also very faint unfortunatly. but the coffee in this bid bad Baptist ballsy beast of a beer is epicly gloriously grand. wow. perfect."

"O - Solid barrel aged coffee stout. It's quite good but it is a bit one dimensional with mostly coffee and bourbon taking over. But it is quite good for the style."

"While admittedly I haven't had as many barrel aged coffee stouts as I'd like, Big Bad Baptist is far and away the best I've tried so far. The coffee is delicious, not too burnt and stays in the forefront while the whiskey dances around it. Very well done and worth seeking out."
""
"A total mind bender. It's hazelnutty, but doesn't taste or drink hazelnutty. Way recommended @ $13/22oz. IMO, this is one beer best drank cold. One of Epics best beers for sure. Cheers!"
""
"O: This is a great beer. The roastiness was a bit much but it was still very enjoyable. I would much prefer it without the peat flavors, there should be a bourbon-only version someday."
"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours pitch black with a nice one finger brown head with good retention and lots of lacing. Nice aroma of toasted and sweet malt, chocolate, nuts and a hint of wood. Flavor follows aroma with toasted and biscuit malt, chocolate, coffee, nuts; boozy. Finishes with smoke, toasty malt, vanilla. chocolate liqueur and grassy hops. Medium bodied with some creaminess. A very nice flavor progression and the rich flavor almost covers the high ABV. One the dangerous stouts, it constantly invites further tasting, but the alcohol requires paced sipping. Very enjoyable and well made."
""
"Overall - Its a really nice beer, the only beer I have had from epic, but certainly wont be the last. Huge malty flavor, loads of coffee and some sugars. As it warms it becomes one sided with the coffee flavor, but that isnt a bad thing."

"O: I think this is the most coffee flavored stout I've ever encountered. Super flavorful, bold, and decedent. A must have for coffee lovers and those that appreciate a coffee forward Imperial Stout."
"Beautiful out of the bottle, nice mocha colored head with that oily look as I swirled the brew around the glass. Dark as night ummm good. The smell was also very nice, little stronger than most stouts I try. Roasty, carmaly, vanilla, and coffee. Very nice nose. The feel was wonderful nice body and nicely blended flavors. Strong coffee flavors and not just coffee but great coffee flavors. Two favorite parts of my day are my morning coffee and my first beer and this had both in it. It has bits of vanilla, carmel, smoke and that milky smoothness I love in a stout. Very nice Another stout I will look forward to having again."
""
"The body is moderate with a more astringent finish. Some fusel/hot notes that is more of a distraction than anything. Carbonation is not present. Overall this is more of a call coffee with alcohol than a beer."

"Slow building head crests at around a finger of dark brown, equal mix of larger bubbles and dense foam, excellent retention which sort of means the lacing gets crowded out, what’s there is isolated chunks which themselves stick well. The liquid as expected is pure black, barely a hint of yellow or orange anywhere, as a result impossible to gauge the carbonation/bubbles visually. The nose is indeed boozy yet also delivers a vast array of sweet scents such as licorice, coconut oil, mocha, café au lait, vanillin oak and a good deal of plum and black cherry fruit scents, produces green apple and floral nuances as well, actually not as punishingly long as it might be and presents itself as gracefully as can be. Full-bodied, average to slightly below average carbonation, not inert but moves like a freighter among ice floes. Loaded with milk chocolate, caramel, butterscotch, coffee ice cream, anise and coconut, it’s like cramming a German chocolate cake down your throat. Not as much black fruit here but also more hoppy bite, on a few sips you sense a latent grassiness struggling to be heard. The orange citrus candied and close to syrupy. Finishes with notes of macadamia and pecan nuts. Lack of carbonation shortens finish but maybe it’s for the best as less monolithic as a result. Excellent beer which just needs some more gym time to loose the flab and tighten up its game. (Release #7)"

"Release #10. 11.4% abv. Pours pitch black with a small brown head. Aroma of some oak, chocolate, and loads of coffee. Sweet but with the perfect bitterness to balance it out. Lots of roasted coffee lingering after the burst of chocolate. Thick and chewey. Prickly carbonation. I do get some oak from this, but little if any bourbon tones. Maybe the bitterness is just balancing these well? In any case, this is one of the best impy’s I’ve had. It’ll keep ya warm for sure. Very nice."
"Overall - I thought this was one of the best Imperial stouts I have ever tried, if not certainly the most interesting and intriguing."

"This beer is awesome! Smell is of coffee, caramel, and sweet malt. Taste is of dark roasted coffee, vanilla, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and finishes with a boozy whiskey flavor.

"Note: Batch #10"
""
"Pours a motor oil darkest brown bordering on black capped by a two finger fluffy tan head. Some retention, which is unusual for barrel-aged stouts, and even a hint of lacing. The nose is wonderful, espresso, dark chocolate, toasted oak, roastiness, and some whiskey-tinged booziness. The balanced flavor of this brew is amazing: cocoa powder, roastiness, rich dark coffee notes, charred oak, some hints of vanilla and integrated whiskey. Finishes smooth with roasted coffee and dark chocolate. Full-bodied, slick and smooth with some underlying creaminess. Overall this brew is a masterpiece and shows a level of balance rarely found in big, barrel-aged imperial stouts. Impressive on every level."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: The coffee absolutely dominates this beer, but that's a very good thing because this is some bomb coffee. Opens with a touch of dark chocolate and roasted malt. Then comes a huge wave of dark roasted coffee. The finish brings just a hint of whiskey, some anise, charred wood and burnt coffee grounds. Mouthfeel is slightly creamy and rich without being too thick and syrupy. Really nicely done."
""
""
""
""
"Overall quite a nice beer. Great coffee, freshly roasted, as well as nice malt base, some hops kicking in with a decent touch, and booze is hidden fairly well. All that with nice barrel flavors and whisky def cuts in but not the best whisky, more Canadian like it seems, or at least seems due to influence from the beer, but can't get any bourbon. Still a great beer and I'm glad I got another one in the cellar."

"O- very good beer. I wish there was more barrel notes but the coffee in this beer is amazing!"

"BBB was a change of pace from the more common bourbon barrel stouts out there. This is very char-heavy without the bourbon derived cherry/fruit flavors. More of a vanilla/alcohol contribution from the barrel. Coffee addition was mild, but very nice. Enjoyable."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of a Imperial Coffee Stout, it had tons of great coffee flavors and it was very smooth, but I think it could have used a little longer in the barrel to balance out all those coffee flavors. This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth and it did a good job at holding my attention, a bomber seems like the perfect amount for me, I wouldn't want to follow it up with another one. What I liked the most about this beer was the drinkability and the mouthfeel they were both very good and better than I expected. What I liked the least about this beer is that the barrel didn't stick out as much as I would like. I would buy this beer again when in the mood for a big Coffee Stout, but I won't be buying it often, I recommend it to anyone who loves Coffee Stouts. All in all I was happy with this beer but I don't think it's the KBS killer that some people told me it would be, it's pretty good, but the coffee is a little too dominating, it lacks the great balance that makes KBS so awesome. For my first Epic beer this made a pretty good first impression on me and I am down to try many more beers from Epic, good work guys, you got me to pay attention to your brewery."

"O - I would definitely buy this again. I put it in the like it but don't absolutely love it. The interplay between the coffee dominance and the hop bittering at the end was interesting. I like coffee beers, and this one was very enjoyable."
""
""
"O/D - An interesting big coffee stout. A bit hefty to the palette, the burnt flavors become very dominant. Alcohol is pretty potent, this one is a slow long sipper - fortunately the beer's style plays that way. A bit filling from its full bodied nature."
"O: This is an exceptional Barrel Aged Imperial Stout. It's very smooth, extremely tasty, and quite enjoyable. I'll gladly have it again anytime."
""

""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: Epic age this stuff in the barrel a little longer and you will have a legend in the making."

"Hit the spot with that coffee flavor. It was strong enough to enjoy, but not too strong. It was rich in its stout manner and engulfed my taste buds in that way that only really good beer does. This brew is definitely going on my Christmas wish list. Hopefully Santa isn't Baptist."

"A/A+"
"I'm not sure what I think of this. I guess I expected a more balanced barreled beer, but this is a one-trick pony: a straight up coffee beer.

""
""
""

"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. I tip my hat to epic brewing company for making a seriously epic coffee stout. The alcohol is masterfully integrated and while the coffee flavors push to be almost excessive and overdone, it is fantastic. I need to try the other batches of this ASAP."
"Pours an opaque, very dark brown color with a mocha colored head. The head dissipates a little too quickly. Otherwise, I would've given its appearance a score of 4.5. I like the uniqueness of the aroma. But, the aroma, in my opinion, just doesn't deserve a 4.5. I note coffee, griddle smoke, and olives. Moutfheel is viscous and slick. Just what I was hoping it'd be. I love the flavor of this one. Greasy spoon exhaust smoke when the griddle catches fire. The smoke begins to yield some to chocolate, but persists, albeit to a lesser degree, throughout the finish. Quite of hop bitterness gets expressed toward the finish, which tends to wake the smoke back up. Just a bit of off plastic flavor that tends to taint so many Imperial Stouts. I hope the smoke flavor in this one was created by the grain and the char of the barrel, not an additive. I really enjoy this beer. It reminds me of Bacon and Eggs from Pizza Port."

"O; I honestly didn't think it was going to be that good and they proved me wrong. Definitely going to look out for more of their offerings."
"#9: This poured out as a rich deep black color with a light brown head on top. There isn't much retention or lacing on this beer but it still looks nice. The smell of the beer has big amounts of coffee on the nose. It's got some whiskey notes as well to sweeten the beer. The taste is big and bold. The coffee is huge here, the chocolate and whiskey note fall into place in the aftertaste. There is a subtle sweetness in there too. The mouthfeel is slick and smooth. The beer is heavy and gently carbonated. Overall this beer is really good. Found this to be a great dessert after a big thanksgiving dinner."
"Batch #9. Just jumpin' right on in: This stuff pours a deep black-brown topped by a finger of dark khaki foam. The nose comprises coffee, roasted malts, light dark chocolate powder, and the faintest hint of whiskey. The taste brings in more of the same, with the coffee taking control once everything else runs its respective course. I've heard other batches have been more whiskey-forward or whatnot, but this batch is decidedly coffee-heavy. This doesn't really detract all that much, as everything is delightfully balanced and expressive; I'm just sayin'. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a generally smooth feel, and a slightly dry finish. Overall, a very nice impy stout, one that shows what moderation can do for a barrel-aged beer. Good times, indeed."
""

"Superb, delicate chocolate aroma. Light oak and roast. Taste is as smooth as anything. Hardly any alcohol heat which is quite an accomplishment considering the abv. And so easy to drink, not filling or overpowering. Fits as a desert beer, accompaniment with dinner, or just something to sip on before bed."

The fact that this beer advertises bourbon barrel aging and doesn't evidence it sucks. What this is is a decent coffee stout. In fact, when I think of coffee stouts, it's up there with some of the nicer ones I've had the pleasure of having. But when I consider this as a barrel aged stout (with added qualities like being brewed with cocoa nibs or with coffee beans) it's somewhat lacking."

"Black with a super creamy beige head on top. Black coffee aroma straight away followed by wood, black malt, dark cocoa, mild creamy vanilla, and perhaps a bit of bread. Mocha, bourbon, dark chocolate, and sweetened espresso flavors. Super smooth, creamy, and heavy. Not overly aggressive with the barrel-aged-ness, which is a good thing in my eyes. Also, not boozy...another plus. I imagine, though, that this could become awesomely, ridiculously smooth(er) after a little time in the cellar. Very nice..."

"O: Decent but not great. I don't go gaga for this like a lot of guys buts a solid BA coffee stout."

"I will pick this one up again."
"O - excellent and highly recommended. Totally underrated, perhaps b/c it's not rare?"
"O - This beer was shockingly good. I tried it for the first time a few days ago and went back the next day to purchase a few more, including the one I am now reviewing. Though different (mainly in the type of whiskey flavor), this beer is nearly as good as KBS, and I didn't have to stand in line or pay $100 to get a 4-pack via eBay. If this is your style, do what you can to get one of these. I can only hope every release will be this memorable."
""
"Mouthfeel is slightly thin. That was my only let down. Overall this was a great beer and I'll probably pick up a bottle soon down the line."
"Drink- Just a bad beer. Wont come back."

"Overall - Its a really nice beer, the best beer ive had from epic so far. Huge malty flavor, loads of coffee and some sugars. Wouldnt mind having this in a 12oz bottle, its alot for one person. Its near world class, kinda one sided with the coffee flavor, and unlike other stouts were i could handle 22oz, id be fine with 12oz of this. Stll, excellent beer, one of the better out there, for sure grab a bottle."

"O: I was told this is an excellent supplement to Founder's KBS. I've not had that, but this is a tremendous beer I hadn't even heard about until I bought it. I highly recommend it for fans of barrel aged anything."
"I have no complaints with this beer. It's big but not over-the-top, looks the part, has great balance, and has the requisite heft to carry all of its complex elements. Highly recommended for fans of this style."

"O= The smell left me wanting something different but this beer is bad ass. A great beer actually. I had written off Epic after being dissapointed by a few of their beers but this one is no joke. I almost can't believe it's the sae brewery. This beer is excellent. Get this and drink them no need to age."
""
"Overall, a very nice stout that downtown get enough props. Coffee and chocolate pair well to make a nice drinking beer for this abv. Most of the barrel flavors evaded me but they may have been masked by the intense coffee flavors. Not much opened up as if warmed which was slightly surprising too. If you get a chance pick this up and give it a whirl."
"Overall: A very good coffee forward imperial stout. Great dark taste. Could of used a little more barrel aging. This might not be ideal for aging as the coffee is a huge element here."
"O- an awesome stout, very well done, this is the best beer by EPIC that I have ever had. Ive had FBS, KBS, CBS and other big stouts I can honestly say this one is just as good!"
"At $13 it is worth trying, maybe not buying a bunch of. Wouldn't mind seeing what some time would do though. It's good, like a big Breakfast Stout, just not quite as all around good as Breakfast Stout, mainly because of the heat."
"Overall: Let me preface this by stating if there were a coffee advocate site I would be a long-standing member. The prominent coffee, the good mouth-feel and the coffee nose work well for me. With the pricing in my area I'll be revisiting this one."

"On tap at hops and pie. Standard imperial stout appearance: motor oil. Filmy head. Aroma was the most glorious coffee beans, so rich with a dab of chocolate. The flavor followed suit and was just as nice. Overall this was a fantastic beer and I need to score some bottles of this stuff or else head back for another glass."
"O: An interesting tasty beer for sure, like Peche Mortel meets Yeti. The bomber price is a bit out there, but a pour on-tap was a good deal methinks."

"O: enjoyable and worth the trying. I will reach for others when spending/considering $12.99 for a bottle. Epic is fairly new to the market here in Michigan and this is my first Epic brew. Overall, it is nothing near ""epic"" in character, rather it is just shy of a ""great"" beer."
""
"O: Lucious and heavenly with a big wow."
"O: Big time coffee bomb stout. A must-have for the coffee lover. I don't even like coffee but the coffee flavor and aroma in this is very rich, fresh and delicious. Not much influence from the whiskey barrels, I think that really could have made this beer incredible. It's quite good regardless, big sharp and strong flavors. I enjoyed it a lot."
""
"O: I think this could be world class if it toned down the coffee just a touch...maybe 10% less coffee. Otherwise it's a damn tasty beverage. If you don't like coffee I'd steer clear of this one as it's basically a nice stout with a double shot of espresso dumped in. I have a Batch #1 someone sent me as well and I may age it for a while to see if the coffee fades enough to bring out more flavors."
"Jesus, man."
""
"Pours a thick, pitch black color with a large, brownish-java colored head that goes down slowly. Scent is...amazing...So much fresh coffee in the aroma. Sweet vanilla aromas with subtle oak. A good amount of bourbon whiskey in the nose. Dark chocolate with more coffee and espresso. Such an inviting aroma. Taste is just as good! At first, I get sweet vanilla and bourbon. A bit of a chocolate liqueur flavor as well. Fresh espresso with a hint of coconut and dark fruits. More bourbon in the finish. High ABV is noticeable, but well-balanced with the flavors. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and creamy. Drinkability is high, especially for such a big beer. Overall, I was blown away by this beer. I haven't been too impressed by all the other offering I have had from Epic, but this one definitely is EPIC (as much as I hate to use that overused word). Definitely goes up there with the BCBSs, Parabolas, and KBSs."
"Too bad this will most likely overshadow all other beers brewed in Utah I try from here on out."
"Pours black with a dark khaki head. Alright retention given its barrel aged. Never smelt anything quite like this and I like. No, I love it. Smells of huge whiskey filled burnt mocha frappucino. Huge cocoa, coffee, and whiskey barrels. Flavor is just as unique; starts off with the whiskey barrels, then some coffee, and leaves with a huge thick, melted chocolate. A medium to fuller mouthfeel. Overall, yeah, this beer is great."

"Amazing brew! Everything the bottle described is in this brew. Has the taste of an RIS with a touch more sweetness and this is where the cocoa nibs come into play with the bitterness matched with the sweet. Color was magnificent, dark black appearance with the rusty grey head. Very much in love with this brew. Shame I only have one bottle left, but I will be saving this one for a special occasion"
""
"Overall: Feels like a cross between FBS and KBS. Delicious, must revisit this one soon."
"The beer pours black in color with a finger of tan head. There is a huge coffee aroma to this. Quite a bit of oak with just a mild vanilla note. Some nice bourbon to go with roasted malt and brown sugar. The flavor has a touch of licorice and molasses to go with vanilla, bourbon, and chocolate. Really solid mouthfeel as well."

"Rich dark pour with an exquisite head and color. Easily mistaken for a rich cup of coffee, the appearance clearly reflects that chocolate and java elements, smooth feel with a perfect complement of carbonation. The tones of java are unmistakable and are perfectly complimented by the settle chocolate hint. Fantastic imperial stout, one that most certainly requires indulging on multiple occasions."
"This is one of my favorite imperial stouts I've ever had. Great body, pours a smooth, deep black color. Beautiful dark copper head. Right off the bat you can smell the coffee and chocolate. First taste is a bitter bite from the whiskey cask aging and the acidity from the coffee. Smooths out with a wonderful dark chocolate finish. I love this beer. Perfect for a cold winter night. Make sure you share, its a big boy."
"22 ounce bottle into snifter, batch 1; bottled 9/22/2011. Pours pitch black color with a small dense tan head with good retention; that reduces to a very thin cap that lingers. Some decent spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of huge dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, toffee, vanilla, whiskey, oak, molasses, toast, and light char. Fantastic aromas with awesome balance and complexity. Taste of big roasted coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel, roasted malt, molasses, toffee, whiskey, oak, molasses, and toast. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, coffee, whiskey, oak, toast, molasses, caramel, toffee, and vanilla on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance of the barrel flavors with the beer; no overwhelming whiskey flavors at all. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a nice creamy, slick, and thick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely fantastic barrel aged imperial stout! Great balance of flavors with the barrel aging; and very smooth to sip on for being 11.7%. This is the easier to find substitute for KBS in my book."
"O - Very glad Greg suggested this one to me...honestly hadn't heard of it at the time and had to look it up. This is one of the better imperial stouts I've had recently...really like the powerful coffee flavors, subtle barrel treatment, amazing aroma. Would really like to get another bottle of this one somewhere down the road."
""
"Big thanks goes out to beeruser for sharing this one at a recent tasting! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller oversized wine glass. Poured pitch black with a half finger tan head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, coffee, caramel, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of roasted malt, coffee, cream, wood, sweet alcohol, and espresso. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. I truly went into this brew not expecting to like what I found. Fortunately, I was QUITE surprised! This thing really amazed me with all the flavors and aromas I got off it. They were so intense throughout while still remaining balanced. This one really wowed everyone at the tasting that evening. If you have constant access to this, I definitely envy you. If you don’t, you need to get this thing on your palate STAT!"

"This beer is a beast! Usually you don't see such grace and balance with bigger Stouts. From roasted, wood, booze and sweetness, it all comes together. Seriously, this one gives some of the more hyped Imperial Stouts something to think about. A true ticker, beer geek, hunter or whatever, should be seeking this brew out."
""

"Edit - Batch #25 (1/18/14) - Heavenly nose that explodes with rich coffee and bittersweet chocolate. The flavor is divine. I can't believe I actually thought this beer was bitter the first time I had it. Wow! So glad I came back to try this beer again after having been around the block a few times. Really delightful coffee flavor. Upgrades to the scores, Holmes! This stuff is da (coffee) BOMB! Very reminiscent of KBS."
"Enjoyable Imperial Stout, chocolate and coffee for the most part, with the body sitting slightly on the lighter side for the style."
"O: This beer is killer! I had no expectations before I opened the bottle, and now I want a case more. This is one of the best/most memorable BA beers I've had in a long, long, long, long ass time. This beer is glorious."

"edit: this has some real variability batch to batch, and while the first one i had was the king of the heap, i have appreciated each one, but liked the first one more than all of them by far. bumping down a few scores just a nudge to reflect that."

"Pours black with a small white head. Then the smell. Holy shit its coffee. Like lots of coffee. bitter coffee and dark chocolate and oak in the taste. Light body, low carbonation, and lots of coffee. There wasnt as much bourbon as I was expecting, but it gets the job done."
""
"A coffee story from intro to epilogue. Black as night, oily texture, sweeter side with chocolate. The coffee wafts, it is much more coffee composition than coffee stouts. Some roasted malt. Good for what it is, it is surprisingly drinkable at 11% abv."
"This was a great stout. The coffee was immense and intense, the alcohol is big and warm, the flavor was profound, but at the same time it was drinkable and smooth. It was all around enjoyable."
"Pours jet black with a tan like head. In the aroma, coffee, chocolate, and a note of alcohol. In the taste, dry coffee and balanced with a sweet cocoa, with notes of alcohol all the way through. A smooth and medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, with a note of dry coffee and small alcohol in the aftertaste. Dry coffee balanced with sweet cocoa, with a nice alcohol presence, very nice."
""
"Overall: I think this beer needs some time to mellow and meld. There are lots of nice flavors that I think will come together nicely. I wish I had one to age. This beer is probably better than my review numbers indicate."
""
"O-I think this is an awesome beer. The coffee and cocoa come through in such a great way. Not overly subtle not over-powering. The whiskey comes through very nicely. It isn't overpowering and is definitely present. In some cases I would like a little more whiskey flavor, but it's still awesome. i think they did a great job. Awesome beer."

"OMFG! Stunning. Sign me up for a barrel. Give me a huge Chalice full accompanied by a Tiramisu soaked in French roast espresso with secret layers of blackberry jam. Amazing."
"I’m usually more of a fan of balance in barrel-aged beers and this beer doesn’t excel at that, with coffee dominating in some areas, sweetness in others, and then bourbon yet again in other areas, but this just worked for me. Maybe it’s because each facet of this didn’t overly crowd the others but I found this to be a quite a pleasant sipper with a killer hidden ABV for 11%. Definitely pick this up though if you like coffee beers, as it is very well done in this."
""
""
"I wouldn't have guessed this was a bourbon stout. I still don't really think so. This is a coffee stout to me, the coffee bitterness is there, the flavors are mostly sweetness up front, malt and a nice coffee finish. I liked it but probably won't have it again."
"O: Where's the balance here? The coffee is untamed and out of control. I don't think aging will do much good, as there's not enough whiskey booze to keep it in check. Not a bad beer, but there's certainly better and more readily available Imperial Stouts on the market."
""
""
"I'm reviewing this beer as a coffee lover and, because of that, it's an outstanding beer. One of the better coffee impy stouts I've had. Even if you're not a coffee fan, you should try this, but if you like coffee stouts, get this. Now."

"On the first sip, Big Baptist coats the tongue with a well balanced mix of cocoa and coffee. The coffee blend tastes like a quality brand was used, very robust and quasi espresso flavors come through. The chocolate was dark, sweet, and bitter. This made me happy, as I prefer dark chocolate versus super sweet in my beers. Vanilla, bourbon, and oak are present throughout, but become more pronounced on the back end of the palate. The mouthfeel is viscous, yet pleasantly light enough. Baptist drinks smooth and easy. I actually wanted more after I finished my bomber. Overall, this was an impressive beer that I rank right up there with The Abyss, but slightly below Goose Island BCBS. I can't compare it to KBS, as the only one I was able to procure mysteriously disappeared a year ago from my fridge. Yes, I'm still crying about that. Baptist fills a niche that I'm fond of; a beer you want when you can't tackle a bigger BCBS type brew. My first beer from Epic and it will not be my last. Very nicely done."
"Pours an opaque black with a dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is absolutely fantastic with dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and huge coffee bean and coffee ground aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt and a flavor very similar to tiramisu that has been dusted with cocoa powder and coffee grounds. There is a nice roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a medium body. Overall, this is a good stout with an outstanding aroma but the taste just doesn't match up."
""
""
"Overall: This stuff is pretty legit, I'm very surprised. It isn't quite in the same league as beers like BCBCS and KBS, but it isn't too far off."
"Overall, this rivals the best coffee stouts I've tasted. The best beer I've had from Epic."
""

"Amazed by this beer, pitch black pour into my Stone R.I.S. chalice, absolutely absorbed all the light in my glass. Big thicket of khaki tan head forms fine even bands of lacing between sips. A perfect breakfast beer, hair of the dog, basically smells and tastes like a coffee bomb with dark bitter chocolate and oak barrel aging effects smoothing things out a good bit. Espresso notes creamy vanilla and charred oak, this was one big complex Big Bad Baptist Imperial Stout that I enjoyed immensely. Body wasn't cloying full to the max with flavor and texture, evenly carbonated...excellent offering. Overall I'm in love and I need to find more I only had one bottle and I need more of this nectar. I've officially been baptized!"

"Poured into an imperial nonic pitch black with a one finger deep mocha colored head atop that stuck like glue to the glass,no light getting thru this even when held up to the light.Mocha java aromas really stick out,wow like a Starbucks mocha java no joke.Heavily roasted flavors with only light alcohol imparted sweetness,faint smokiness lingers,the chocolate flavors are there but dont lend much sweetness just cocoa flavor.Thick and lush in the feel,hey to me Epic makes really really good beers and this is true to form."
"Batch #4. Deuce to oversized snifter. Looks good; pitch black with lacing. Smells good; coffee and whiskey with malty undertones. Tastes good. If I could give it a 4.0+ I would, but I can't, and I can't give it a higher review than I'd call it. I wish it was a little more barreled than coffeed. Overall, a tasty treat, and another great value beer from Epic."

"Both bourbon barrel and coffee stouts are among my favorite styles. This one merges them to perfection in my opinion. I'm not sure why this beer hasn't garnered more attention.

"O: I liked this beer but like a little more presence. It's a good stout but needs a little more body and a little less sweetness. I agree with those that don't think this will age well - the alcohol is amazingly well-hidden and I think the base stout is a little lacking in complexity."

"M/D - Smooth bodied, almost creamy mouthfeel, very little carbonation. Slightly oily body as well. This is very easy to drink and hides the alcohol very well. Too well."
"Nice! Great stout. Dark, deep black, with a smell of strong iced coffee. Tastes as it smells--coffee, syrup, and chocolate notes. Silky smooth on the palate. One of the better stouts I've recently had. Bottle price is a little high, but worth the extra cost. Very nice overall!"

Overall, really a pretty tasty brew."
""
"O: Overall, I wish the coffee was stepped back a bit and the bourbon was more prominent. This beer is top notch, but I'm thinking it needs some age to make all the flavors come together. Not my favorite of the releases, but I would never turn it down. 4"

"Release #2, 11.3% ABV. Very very strong nose of roasted black coffee. Cocoa scents weave their way in and out through the coffee smell. The coffee is dominant through the sip and the swallow, but not in an overbearing way, as can be the issue with many coffee stouts. There is a slight trace of chocolate that is followed by a subtle oakiness. The swallow is a bit hot, no doubt from the whiskey barrel aging, but not uncomfortably so. The rich mouthfeel is complimented by the coffee flavors that wash everything down and stick around on your tongue long after you've finished. Overall this a pretty extreme beer from all angles and it will definitely be too much for some but fans of strong, burly stouts will find plenty to love here."
"Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer isn't as creamy as it is silky. The body is a bit on the light side for an 11.7% ABV Imperial Stout, which helps to keep this beer from becoming overly sticky and syrupy (which it is neither). The carbonation is almost unnoticeable but is definitely doing a fantastic job in the background. This beer really slides over the tongue smoothly while coating it completely."
"Overall the coffee dominates the brew with other flavors coming in softer and subtle. Pretty tasty if you like coffee."

"O: This is one amazing stout! I had some doubts but this one now is number 3 all time! Gonna go back for some more soon and get me a couple of overpriced bottles to stock up on!"

"This was a nice surprise from Epic and definitely worth a try. Excellent price too. I hope they get some more character from the barrel for the next batch. This coud be a good substitute for Bourbon County Coffee."
"O - unsure about this one for the first few sips but it really grew one me. love the bold, coffee-forward taste. making for a wonderful sipper on a cold snowy night. my first epic beer, this one is really well done."
""
"Overall, I really liked this a lot. This is so under the radar of ""Barrel Aged Imperial Stouts out there. It wasn't very cheap and maybe that's a down fall but this was truly wonderful beer. Thanks to Sylvia for getting the last two cases this states going to see."
""
"Overall, the flavors were way too dominated by one element; the coffee. Little to no barrel flavors, bitter roasty coffee overshaddows everything else here. It is not bad by any means, flavor-wise, but I can go get a cup of Joe for a buck at the convenience store. A coffee bomb of a beer indeed, so if that's your thing, not for me though, and I love coffee."
"O: a very good beer overall. Delicious without being overly boozy or strong."
"Overall I enjoyed it, fairly complex with the notes blending well. Grading to style, it didn't hold up to other imperial stouts I liked more, but still very good. I think the adjuncts and (to a lesser extent) the whiskey barrel overpowered the base beer a little, and I didn't really like the astringent finish, but fairly rich and nicely balanced."

"O: I though Grand Teton's Wake Up Call was the most coffee forward until his came along. The barrel is well integrated and sort of lingers in the background to let the coffee and roasty qualities really shine."

"O: I honestly could confuse this with a cold Irish espresso. If you don't like coffee I wouldn't recommend this, but I certainly enjoy it."
"This is a big improvement on the Epic Imperial Stout, but I wish the entire ton of coffee didn't fall into the mash tun. Oh well. Ultimately, a good beer that could use a lighter spin in the coffee washer."
"Pours black as night with an oily, deep brown head. Aromas of charred roasted malts, dark fruits, and alcohol. In the taste, coffee, charcoal, mild sweetness and small hop presence. Bitter almost acrid malt flavor, some barrel presence, providing a nice bite the the beer. Clean alcohol flavors are hidden underneath a strong coffee presence. Full bodied, thick feel. Overall, a beast of a beer, but one thats worth fighting."

"22 ounce bottle, Batch #2, Brewed on June 10, 2011, Packaged November 28, 2011 (says that on Epic's website). Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head that stayed around for a little while. There's also a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is strong and roasty, the brew smells mostly like coffee, along with some roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, and a little bit of whiskey. Taste is mostly like the aroma, there's roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, whiskey, oak and burnt/charred malt flavors all noticeable. The coffee flavor is dominant, but there's more sweetness that comes out as the brew continues to warm up. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy with good carbonation. I think this is a pretty good brew, if you're a fan of coffee beers then this one is for you! $12.99 a bottle."
""
"Medium bodied with some tight carbonation and a very dry, roasted malt presence that dominates the flavor, lingering into a dry finish. Slightly acrid, heavily roasted coffee bean and bitter dark chocolate notes along with some toffee and oatmeal. Barrel character is most prominent toward the finish with dry, toasted oak complimenting the roasted malt profile and faint boozy whiskey sweetness providing warmth in the finish. Whiskey notes are there but subtle, allowing the other flavors to come through. As it warms the richness from the cocoa and dark malts shine but it's still a bit strong in the roast department for my liking."

"Taste is very nice. Sweet and creamy with lots of coffee and mild milk chocolate. The coffee is well done here, not overpowering at all, just nicely there in the background. The chocolate comes through well and it finishes nicely with a lingering sweetness. Feels rich and smooth. A really well done stout but the price is a bit much to drink with any regularity."
"The flavor was dominated too much by one element. For the cost of the bottle I wanted a much better executed stout. The barrel-aging needed to come out more. I would still give the next release another try."

"overall, I had mixed feelings on this brew. the coffee and chocolate flavors were great, but the whiskey and barrel again didnt seem to come out much. it was also a little light texture-wise. if offered again, I would definately have some, but I dont know if i would put in the extra effort to find this somewhat rare beer."
"O - A good imperial stout from a brewery I'm new to. I wish the whiskey/oak/barrel-aging characteristics were a bit more prevalent. The coffee seemed to dominate the other aromas/flavors."

"The charred malt lends a great partner flavor to the bitter chocolate and coffee grounds. One that I haven't come across before. This is a damn fine stout that is welcome in my glass any time. Solid job, Epic."

"Poured from bomber into tulip glass. Pours dark black with a moderate looking viscosity. The head rises an inch or two then settles after a minute. Smell is inviting at first with a rich dark carmel oaky vanilla followed by a bitter coffee smell mellowed by chocolate. The smell of the very strong coffee doesn't appeal to me. Gives off a dark rich roast almost espresso scent. Unfortunately, I am not much of a coffee drinker so you can say this was a bit dark rich bitter astringent. There is a moderate amount of vanilla oak and warm alochol. There is some carmel malt and roasty malt. Mostly coffee mocha and barrel. Light notes of ash, dark fruit and tree bark. There is a lingering sweetness cleaned up by a moderate bitter hop bite. Mouthfeel is medium body with medium carbonation that is creamy. Probably a better beer for those who really swear by coffee."

"I had very high expectations but was severly disappointed. I was hoping for a Big John sort of quality & flavor -- it's certainly not that. The smell is powerful but I'm not sure how to describe it -- musty, perhaps? The taste is out of balance ... incoherent. A mix of flavors, each trying to out do the other, certainly not in harmony. Often even a mediocre beer gets better during a sitting as the taste buds acclimate ... not the case for me with this one. Stay away."

"O - This an awesome beer that deserves some respect. I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes big stouts."

"The alcohol is barely noticeable and the flavor is overwhelmingly complex. Get this one while it last. It's rumored to be a one time brew."
"O: Heavy on the coffee, could be more balanced for how it is advertised."
"The mouthfeel is heavy with carbonation being low. Overall it was a pretty decent beer, but the roasty, bitter, coffee was a little overpowering for me. I liked the coffee flavors, it just overshadowed the chocolate and whiskey a little too much for me. A little more balance would have really gone a long way. Pretty decent beer of the style, but not an outstanding one for me."
"O: This totally blew me away. If you really want to taste coffee AND bourbon in your beer, this is the one for you!"
"Notes: Blasphemy: in the KBS range without the hype, missing the Bourbon barrel, and with good coffee.. not too good a coffee but a fair coffee… Dunno, it is nice but nothing that I would actively seek out."
"O - Very close. There is just something about the flavor palate that is odd. it is like this brew is fighting itself."
"Cheers."
"A stout that's both rich and dry... rare. Incredibly coffee heavy. I can only wonder what aging would do."
"Full body, chewy with lower carbonation. Some warmth at the finish. This is certainly a blast of coffee, with some nice compliments. Very nice."
"cheers"
"As far as I'm concerned, this needs some serious clean-up. Namely, the coffee is out of control and needs to be reigned in. I hate to be the one to police the Hype Pipe © usage that seems is going on here, but this is far from an astounding barreled take on the style. Perhaps it might improve as the coffee fades, but, at this price point, I'm not likely to pick up a second bottle to find out."
"4.5 D: A couple categories could have been a notch higher, so this is the score it gets here. Solid brew."
"O - The flavors are spot on for a mocha stout. However, the alcohol bite takes away from the overall body of the beer. This is still an outstanding brew and I hope I can get another bottle to see how it turns out after aging."
"Overall, it's very much a simple flavored big stout, nothing crazy, or incredibly varied, but just done extremely well. This one is a keeper, this is a winner right here."
"Coffee monster here and delicious, big and toasty with hints of mocha, heavy cream, burnt caramel, toffee, plum, blueberry, very light wood, with some bourbon notes late in the finish. Other brooding dark fruits, coffee tannins galore and a smidgeon of vanilla."
"O- This is one doozie of a beer. I think the alcohol is a bit too hot for my personal preference but aging one might take away from the huge coffee flavors. A very nice coffee forward brew."
"O: This is luscious, rich, and delicious. Everything that a coffee, chocolate, whiskey barrel stout should be. Fine work."
"O: glad I got a bottle of this, easily the best beer I've had from epic. A little more bal character would really help, but this is damn tasty. I love coffee forward beers and this is awesome. Nicely done epic. Nicely done."
"But, no barrel characteristics what so ever."
"O-nice suprise. Very good but very Hugh coffee"
"3.5/5/4.5/4/4.5"
