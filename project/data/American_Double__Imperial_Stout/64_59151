4.34,3.6,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,"this is sensational and something totally different. i cannot believe some of the negative write ups of this beer on here, totally unwarranted in my opinion, which is only as good as the next guys, but i honestly think this is pretty special beer. a nice gift from my girlfriend, who no longer really buys me beer, so i was feeling special myself when she did that for me. this is so sexy in appearance. inky shiny dark brown, plenty of viscosity, and a pillow soft mocha head with nice lace and stickiness as it slowly fades. aromas of tobacco and licorice along with the dark roasted malt. not too sure about gesho root, i have zero experience at all with it, but the beer does appear hoppy on the nose, so it could be contributing the bitterness and slight vegetal aromatic. the flavor is all about that honey with the dark malt richness. notes of jet puff marshmallow, espresso, and chicory are all here, earthy but really sweet too, molasses or some other raw sugar. it doesnt really come across like other stouts to me, there is more going on here, wonderful depth and complexity and nuance. a mild spice in the finish, could be the gesho but i just dont know it well enough to venture there. slight apple wine and marker finish, booze shows through a touch, but the more i sip the more i love this. a unique and wintery glass of ale, made all the better by sharing it with someone who i deeply admire. also, props for the miles davis tribute, his contribution to culture in this country is second to none.","StonedTrippin","Jan 21, 2015"

A very tasty and extremely smooth sour ale that grows on you as it warms up. An amazing beer and its possible its not at its peak.

4.16,-0.7,4,4.75,4,3.75,4,"Mouthfeel is ok, much lighter than anticipated.  Has a strong carbonation level without being over carbonated.  Levels of complexity come out in the mouthfeel.  It's light, smooth, and dry all at the same time.  Since there are so many sweet flavors it's nice then it balances out with some bitterness then ends with a very dry finish like a red wine would.  Very drinkable though, the 9% isn't overbearing, this could be consumed by a beer enthusiast over dinner if they wanted.  Overall a very good beer, not a very great beer, but very good.  I've had it a few times and am impressed with how well this beer (approximately 3-4 years aged) has held up.  Might be slightly past it's prime but still very good.","AndyAvalanche","Oct 01, 2014"

The smell was chocolate and malt with hints of fruit sweetness. The taste was amazing with coffee and dark chocolate flavors starting and finishing with flavors of dates and banana in the middle to even out the heavy flavors. The mouthfeel was nice and thick without becoming syrupy. Overall one of my personal favorite beers.","WhiteHillsStore","Jul 14, 2014"

4.2,0.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled in 2012. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense dark brown head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the lacing cap. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light char, molasses, honey, herbal, light anise, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and moderate honey/herbal spice notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light char, molasses, light anise, honey, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light char, molasses, light anise, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of big roasted/bready malt and moderate honey/herbal spice flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy, smooth, and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome imperial stout. All around great complexity of robust roasted/bready malt and moderate honey/herbal spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 16, 2014"

Aroma is fresh and on the mild side & mellow- cocoa, roast malt, old leather. Flavor's like nose, understated, esp for an imp stout tang & very easy bitterness up front, fairly dry with sweet being residual. Body/carbonation are perfect, a tad chewy, a bit soft, yet not too. Finish is like flavor, longish, and super drinkable. Only the barest suggestion of alcohol. Solid beer","drpimento","Dec 14, 2013"

Absolutely pitch black like a stout should be, but what stood out was the head. it was not the usual khaki or off white; it was a dark, chocolaty brown... Gorgeous! For the smell: bakers chocolate, toffee and espresso, a bit more bitter than stouts usually smell. Taste is similar, not the most complex stout, but there are a lot of good flavors! Tons of dark chocolate, i don't know what "gesho" tastes like but there are some earthy notes that are uncommon. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, mild carbonation. Overall, solid beer, and I can't get over how great a pour it is!","Samuel906","Nov 18, 2013"

I can tell it's a sipper I appreciate. Doesn't feel as thick as I anticipated, although it does possess a nice slickness to complement the sharp aspects of the gesho root (a hop effect). For an unorthodox interpretation of a stout, quite well done by DFH, and as usual. An apt testament to the brewery and its founder, who apparently drafted the business plan while under the influence of the album for which this brew is named. That said, not for everyone (like that jazz), but worthy. Cellaring the remainder.","TBoneJones","Oct 28, 2013"

Due to the density of these types of stouts, I'm not sure if I would dive into an entire bomber+ of this anytime soon again, but that comes with the territory of a stout like this. A single glass would be a Perfect nightcap or after dinner drink. Definitely a beer meant to enjoy, savor, and sip. But for me, the 25 or so ounces was simply too much (too heavy), to still be "enjoying" towards the end. Again, thats not the beers fault. I just wish it were also served in single 12 or 16 oz bottles instead. Great beer.","Haze76","Oct 26, 2013"

Very roasty, chocolaty nose with hints of licorice, coffee, molasses, subtle black cherry, and just a touch of honey, but probably only because I was searching for it. The taste is dominated by bitter dark chocolate, offset by a sweet root beer and honey combination that I really didn't care for. Hints of licorice, burnt coffee, vanilla, molasses, black cherries, and tobacco as well. The mouthfeel is moderately thick and slightly syrupy with medium carbonation and a bitter, slightly sour finish. Overall, this is yet another disappointing beer from the most overrated brewery in the world. I love when brewers go out on a limb and use unusual ingredients, but they never seem to work with Dogfish Head.","beerdrifter","Aug 24, 2013"

4.29,2.4,5,4,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Poured a gorgeous deep black with a thin tan head. Looks quite nice. Scents of black coffee, roast malt and some alcohol. Standard for the style. Flavor begins with dark chocolate and black coffee, moving into those same flavors with a bit of added sweetness and ending with all those flavors plus roast malt and an aftertaste that combines roast malt and black coffee. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy bodied with decently high carbonation for the style. Also a sort of woody, drying quality, most likely due to the gesho root. It's a very good imperial stout, but it's not quite the odd take on the style I expected from Dogfish Head. Very good, but very normal, which doesn't mean it's bad. It's an experiment that worked, if it only did produce normal results. I'd have it again.","Auraan","May 12, 2013"

Bitches Brew is an assault on the senses. But the warmer it gets, the more the honey comes through, both in flavor and mouthfeel. And I have to be honest, I’m not entirely sure what a gesho root is, or what, exactly, it adds to the beer. I’ll assume most of the earthiness and the hints of bitter are from the gesho. Whatever it’s from, it complements the honey nicely, and adds loads of depth to the imperial stout base.","BeerNotes","Apr 21, 2013"

For fans of sweeter beers this one goes way beyond a “must try.” What really makes this beer different is how the gesho’s mild earthy and peat-like bitterness fit very well with the sweet malt and honey. The gesho does only enough to keep the sweetness from going over the top, but still allows all of the flavors come through bright and clear.","Mertzy81","Mar 01, 2013"

Some points are being deducted here, due to the size of the head and its minimal lacing on the glass. With the aroma, on one hand I am getting nice, roasted malts, and on the other, an intriguing presence similar to bittersweet apple cider. Very interesting... After one sip, the taste confirmed this, but the bitterness in that cider aspect was intensified compared to the aroma, and it was more like apple cider vinegar. Not at all unpleasant, though. Some vanilla bean and a very dark clover honey, or molasses flavors are in there as well. The mouth feel was very full, and the finish ended sweetly. A uniquely Dogfish Head style creation - definitely a 'must try' if you are a fan. Don't hesitate to order if you are a general stout fan either!","Neorebel","Feb 27, 2013"

3.99,-4.8,3.5,4.5,4,3,4,"Mostly dry on the palate with a fairly conventional flavor profile for an imperial stout. Dark chocolate, bitter espresso, and licorice all play a part in the flavor. Lots of roasty malt goodness here with alcohol making only a slight intrusion. This would be well on its way to being a solid imperial stout, but the mouthfeel is a let-down. The carbonation checks out way too early, and it's not rich and chewy enough for an imperial stout. DFH takes a fairly conventional course with Bitches Brew and almost hits the mark. With some improvements to the texture, this would be recommended.","gr0g","Dec 23, 2012"

The aroma is of expresso and dark chocolate, there is also a hint of honey. The taste follows suit, there is a coco flavor along with deep expresso. The middle has a sweet dark fruit and honey flavor before the expresso flavor comes back at the back end. The mouthfeel is velvety but not overly slick. It was a nice balance. Overall a very solid beer, the aroma is good and the flavor keeps you wanting more.","goblue3509","Dec 22, 2012"

So, I kept in the refrigerator for nearly 2 years. Last night however, a good friend of mine looked me in the eye and announced that “it was time.” So we opened it. I'll be totally honest with you right now, I think I held on to the beer too long, even in the fridge. It was more bitter than I remember it being when it was fresh. I think the gesho root aged differently than I would expect hops to and it turned pretty bitter. The honey tones melted with and almost got lost in the oxidation process and yet it was still a winning beer in my book! The beer poured a big beautiful brown head and that wonderful aged red-fruit flavor you get from a well aged beer. If you have a 2011 release though, you might want to consider popping that baby open soon and shooting me a comment on how it tastes, I'd be very interested in hearing from anyone that has one.","GoatsUdder","Oct 18, 2012"

3.98,-5,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer pours a dark black with a berry red tint. This beer is a dark one for sure, with a dark toffee colored head of bubbles that dies down into a rim around the glass. Lacing is sticky and ring like with some sliding bits. The beer smells dankly sweet with an almost vanilla hint. The chocolate malt staleness is also very present and lovely with nice toffee hints. Light alcohol burns the back of the nose to let you know it’s there, but it is not overpowering. The beer tastes fantastically of chocolate malts with the light bitters of dark chocolate. The beer is roasty with an oh-so-slight smoke to it. In the middle of the taste there is a slight vegetal sweet flavor that is like vanilla but which must be the gesho root coming through, but the roasted malt work its way back to linger in the sides of the mouth. The honey is not really present in the taste, but more so in the mouthfeel as a slight suggestion. The more I taste it, the more of the beer’s sweet vegetal middle comes through as a little cloying. In the very back of the taste before it runs down the back of your throat there is a hint of fruity esters from the yeast suggesting pear or something similar. Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin but very velvety with only a hint of effervescence. The mouth is left dry with spittle clinging to the sides of the mouth and begging for more beer. Overall this beer is very intriguing and surprising for its style. The mouthfeel is a little weak, and the weird sweetness is a little cloying, especially as you get into this beer. The light mouthfeel also suggests this would be an excellent beer to eat food with. This is also a sipping beer as the alcohol got my cheeks nice and warm. This is another lovely off-centered ale from Dogfish Head and a lovely try for the craftbeer fans.","Maxwell","Sep 21, 2012"

There is some chocolate and honey in the aroma, which is a weird combination if you ask me. Flavor follows the aroma closely. Slight bittersweet chocolate up front, with some honey on the finish. As a whole, the roast and sweet don't meld together for some reason. I’m not sure I like these two flavors together, and it comes through as a pretty thin stout.

4.05,-3.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall a very interesting beer with that unique bittering root. Aging is a must try with this to see how the gesho root and honey transform over time. Honey will get eaten up by the yeast and smooth this out even more.","CloudStrife","Sep 20, 2012"

4.45,6.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured from a bottle to a Guinness special edition pint glass. This beer poured with a nice dark 3 finger head, with smells of malt and smoke, as well as dark chocolate, and honey. This beer is phenomenal, the 9% abv is well hidden by the malty smell, dogfish head really hit a home run with this, one of the more distinguishing factors of this beer is the clean finish that leaves your mouth with very little flavor, unlike most Russian Stouts, the honey probably lends to that. Overall this is one of the best beers from Dogfish Head, and is one of the more unique beers on the market.","3BeerGuys","Sep 19, 2012"

This time around, I was very impressed again. This one has a roasty quality with a balancing honey sweetness and smooth vanilla finish. At $13.99/bomber, it's a bit pricey, but I recommend this beer, highly.","NoLeafClover44","Sep 19, 2012"

Moderate body with smoky malt and dark fruits, chocolate. Flavor somewhat subdued and finish is a bit abrupt and dry with a light hoppy finish. Kind of tame for Dogfish head. I'd classify this as closer to an English stout because of the finish. A nice stout, but not remarkable. I'll age a couple to see if it mellows.","LiquidAmber","Aug 02, 2012"

This beer poured a thick, burnt umber into a snifter and left a two inch chocolate milk colored head. Scent is of roasty malts and a subtle, berry. Tastes of dark roasted malts and bitter, dark chocolate with a hint of tartness. Has a creamy, soft mouthfeel with a soft effervescence. I am searching for the honey but it's not there in an "in your face" sweetness. Somewhere in there is a salty, soy sauce note and a whisper of smokiness. Maybe some chicory root and anise or licorice. As it warms, it grows more complicated and had a dark chocolate with raspberry tone and a splash of coffee. Nicely layered and balanced, this beer does not disappoint. I can see why it's so highly rated. I am going to be sad when I get to the bottom of the glass.","RescueKitty","Mar 18, 2012"

4.4,5,5,5,4,4,4.5,"Overall: This beer not only packs a punch, but is complex and delicate enough to seduce you into drinking more and more. As soon as you pour it you can tell this beer will be a rough Imperial Stout. That is exactly what comes through on both the nose and mouth, but what follows is the complex flavors from the honey and gesho root. The two sides of this beer combine to play beautiful music on your tongue. A true embodiment of the fusion between rock, funk, and jazz that we now know as Miles Davis’ Bitches Brew.","JaredKent","Jan 07, 2012"

3.74,-10.7,5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Medium bodied with a prominent dry, roasted malt character that is countered by sweetness from the dark fruit. The honey adds a hint of molasses and thickens up the body a bit. Slightly burnt/acrid but not too harsh with hints of burnt toast, deeply roasted coffee bean, bitter dark chocolate and oatmeal. As the palate adjusts, the sweetness becomes more evident with more honey/molasses and vinous dark fruit. Hints of grape, raisin, currant and dark cherry counter the dry, roasted flavor. Faint alcohol presence in the finish but the ABV is nicely masked with very little heat. This beer definitely improves as it warms so I would suggest sharing it with one or two people rather than opening it at a larger tasting.","corby112","Dec 22, 2011"

Aromas are strong coffee, both dark and roasted, with some cocoa nib hints, as well. Good effervescence to the aroma, despite the beer's robustness. Flavors are rich, and ride a creamy, smooth body. Good palate of dark roasted coffee, with a hint of dark chocolate and a good overtone of booze. Subtle sweetness lacing throughout the brew helps to lighten the flavors. The aftertaste is surprisingly light, with a creamy chocolate and honey flavor, and only a highlight of the bitter coffee. Crisp finish cleans up the smooth body and bold flavors nicely, and this is an amazingly tasty brew. Dangerously easy to drink at the ABV...could be trouble.

Coffee, chocolate, some smokiness, Some kind of hers, and definitely some other stuff: a complex aroma. This has a very complex taste. Some coffee, roast and bittersweet chocolate up front, then a ton of other flavors. A touch of sweetness and then a touch of bitterness in the finish. Somewhere between medium and full bodied.

Well, despite the admirable balance, perhaps Bitches Brew lacks focus or commitment? Then again, it's growing on me, much like jazz. I'm stretching a little bit, but not too much. It helps that I have the album on in the background as I write. I will conclude that this is a beer that merits reconsideration and will likely change with age.","AgentMunky","Nov 20, 2011"

Smells of dark citrus, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, slight alcohol, slight liquor, hint of yeast, mustiness, and a hint of hops. Fits the style of a Russian Imperial Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, dark citrus, slight hops, hint of chocolate, and a hint of alcohol.

3.91,-6.7,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The Bitches Brew poured out as a dark black color with a foamy brown head on top. The lacing was decent on this beer. The smell was heavily roasted and had a sweetness on the nose as well. The taste is rich and complex, well worth the time sipping it down. The flavors of coffee and some bitter chocolate come through and leave ya with a dry roasted molasses aftertaste. The mouthfeel is heavy and has a decent amount of carbonation.

Interesting yeast and sweet-ish character. Nice dichotomy of smooth/biting interplay as well as a cool balance of dark flavors - hard to describe...I am struggling here. I guess I'll just go with great concept, great execution and a really good beer. Well done Dogfish.","twiggamortis420","Jul 31, 2011"
4.63,10.5,4.5,4,5,5,4.5,"A well balanced beer I think. For an imperial, it sure is drinkable. I'm not sure what the honey and gesho do for this beer. But I guess a more sophisticated pallet could detect those subtle flavors.","Buggies","Jul 29, 2011"
4.45,6.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a pitch black with a huge 3 inch dark khaki head that settles to a nice 1 inch cap. Thick foamy rings of lace form on the glass like a ladder on the drink down. Smell is of dark fruits, dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and cocoa powder. I don’t get any honey smells off this one, but there is an alcohol aroma. Taste is of dark roasted malt, roasted coffee beans, and bittersweet dark chocolate. Again, no honey flavors detected whatsoever. Mild roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. A good level of carbonation makes for a crisp and creamy mouthfeel, Overall, this is a very good stout from DFH but the honey beer part of this blend has all but faded. I should have bought another one of these when I had the chance to see how it tastes fresh.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 24, 2011"

Get a couple bottles and age this for sure, the plant and honey combination will certainly gain complexity in time.","Cavery","Jul 09, 2011"
4.08,-2.6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"O: This is easily the most sessionable RIS I've ever encountered. The lighter body and tone down of some of the classic flavors allows you to go through this at an unusual and very tasty rate.

Scent is earthy, milk chocolate, charred and smoked grain, leather, damp mud, light touches of a powerful spice. Taste brings smooth cocoa before it dives into dark roasted coffee beans, char and smoke, warms to a very earthy and muddy brew. Strong amounts of spice stick out and lingering sweetness sticks to the palate. Full bodied, creamy and smooth with a faint touch of grainyness, no lingering notes on the palate, stradles the line between dry and sweet perfectly.

4.28,2.1,5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"I drank this upon its release at Venti's, on tap, while the bartenders played Bitches Brew all night. That's the ideal way to drink this beer, but, atmosphere aside, a little age has improved the actual flavor immensely. It's not as thick or as powerful as I've come to expect from the alleged style (I say "alleged" because its similarities to a milk stout are still prominent), but, while initially sweet, it's still nuanced, well-balanced, and a novel hybrid of cross-cultural styles. Very drinkable -- the alcohol's not very apparent at all. My only qualm is that the beer became noticeably more tart as it warmed. Nevertheless, its one of my favorite stouts.","Elendinn","May 16, 2011"

It's not your average imperial stout flavor and feel but it's there. It did become slightly acidic and was not the easiest drinking but it was a pleasure to selfishly finish.

Taste has two levels, coffee and bitter chocolate on the front and a heady sweetness of something very earthy at the end. But this is not a sweet stout, its almost savory.

The aroma is interesting...there's a touch of honey, some chocolate character, a hint of wood, and caramel malt scents. It's an intriguing and very enticing scent that I originally found quite good, but that also continued to grow on me...I couldn't get enough of the aroma. The taste is equally interesting...dark malts, roasted barley, more wood character, less honey than in the smell, and an unexpected dryness. The dryness has a touch of chalk to it, but it doesn't become astringent, and seems to keep the beer in balance, since it's not overly bitter. Alcohol is well hidden, but is evident after half a glass (more from effect than from taste). The beer is very full in body, but the dryness still makes it easy to drink.

Of course there's the obvious chocolate stoutiness, with roasted smokey malts with a touch of booziness. But then there's this flavor profile in the middle of sweet wood and earth that's hard to put words to. But it is very delightful. Maybe it's damp firewood and mild herbs.

4.2,0.2,4,4,4.5,4,4," The flavor has a lot of toast and caramel with subtle cocoa up front. As you work your way in to the middle there is more honey flavor and less roast with slight fisherman's friend cough drop accent from the gesho root giving a clean woody and herbal flavor which is complimentary with the honey flavor. The stout is sweeter than most with the floral aspects of the honey giving the feel levity and making it less cloying than it sounds. The flavor strikes me like a toffee/honey candy bar with mild cocoa and light nuttiness from the roast with the honey pretty high in the flavor with the gesho there standing out slightly but not distracting from the stout flavor. I consider this very tasty and interesting in its own right. It has stout elements but for a pure imperial stout it isn't something I consider highly drinkable.

Poured into a sniffer, this beer gave a rich and brown head that dissipated at a reasonable pace, leaving bubbles lingering on the glass. A thin layer remained on top. 9% alcohol they claim; tasted more like five or six percent. There is a distinguished roasted malt taste, but it isn't overwhelming. I would almost call it gentle. The brew is also sweet, maybe a little nutty. Definitely some chocolaty tones, but coffee notes are fairly subdued. The aftertaste lingers on the cheeks as any Imperial Stout must, but its changed just slightly. It's a bit sweeter, perhaps.

The flavor has dropped off a little too, but being a RIS it still has excellent flavor. It just doesn't feature the t'ej like it used to. The honey is now more in the after taste and more noticeable only as you get halfway through your glass. Like most DFH 750s, the mouthfeel is perfect. It's very smooth and soft on your palate. This beer is extremely drinkable. You'd never even know it contains alcohol. I still love it, but as this review shows, it was better fresh and was far more complex.

It's worth the price and effort just for the uniqueness of it, something I'd definitely recommend trying and am so glad I could try, but fortunately considering the price and rarity, it's a a beer I'd only ever want as an occasional treat.","Beeralzabub","Dec 24, 2010"

Ok roasted flavors dominate but the sweetness becomes a bit much. I understand the blend of flavors they might be looking for but it doesnt really work for me. Somewhat of a licorice flavor in the backround. No hint of alcohol. Nice, solid and full mouthfeel. Overall an ok beer for me. I have had this several times on draft and wanted a bottle to really form an opinion. Just doesnt fall into place as a great beer. Love the concept-just not the beer.","lackenhauser","Dec 24, 2010"

At first, the beginning was really sweet, and finished with a roasty vanilla chocolaty malt feel, but about halfway through, the flavors changed up on my, and I was hit with the roast first and finished with the sweetness. I could detect the honey, chocolate, expresso, vanillia, caramel and some serious hop bitterness in the finish.

Nose is an interesting mix of licorice, roast, some kind of floral sweetness that might be from the honey and maybe a touch of chocolate. No real hop aroma. Taste is a decent mix of roasted barley, although light, with chocolate, light honey, and some herbal ,earthy bitterness in the background. Kind of reminds me of a Toblerone candy bar. Could use a little more body and fullness, carbonation is tight. Booze is well integrated but comes out more as it warms. Nice beer, but not really what I look for in an imperial stout.

Taste is smooth and full flavored. Burnt and charred sweet sugars and toffee. Nice big caramel malt core. Some firm earthy hops in the finish. Finish is clean and hoppy.

The "fusion" characteristics that were put into the brew show themselves subtly, though; perhaps a ratio nearer to half-and-half Imperial Stout and Tej would have made it a bit more interesting. Undoubtedly the honey serves to lighten the body and raise alcohol content which certainly adds to the beer's character, and the gesho may be what adds that extra spice-like character, but overall the impression is more of a slightly-tweaked Imperial Stout than anything else. Can't fault it much overall, though, as this is most definitely one bitchin' brew.","superdedooperboy","Dec 02, 2010"

Smoke seems to be the most prominent. There is a slight flash of sweetness and a tanginess throughout the taste. It seems almost salty right before the finish. The aftertaste is bitter and kind of sharp. A dark, grainy flavor lingers. I can taste the tej up in my nose.

The odd thing, the head changed color. It started off dark brown then finished a brownish beige. The aroma has nice chocolatey notes to go along with the roasted malt aromas. Some charred wood as well. The taste starts off roasty with milk and bitter chocolate flavors. There is a vinous character that pops through. Some rust like flavors as well. Not much from the honey unless it added to the overall sweetness of the brew. The beer has a full body, a touch chewy, with soft-ish carbonation. Fairly sweet brew but it does have a roasty bitterness. This is a very smooth imperial stout. The honey beer smooths out the roasted stout which makes it damn drinkable.

Taste was largely similar, roasted chocolate up front, some dryness, followed by a slightly bitter darker chocolate taste, with a first what seems like a weird, indescribable aftertaste, which must be the Gesho sticks and leaves.

3.65,-12.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a solid black with a good sized long lasting creamy tan head that leaves a respectable amount of lace on the way through the glass. Smells of roast coffee and chocolate. This also has a sweet maltiness and an herbal minty aroma that I can only assume comes from gesho root. Mix that all together with a touch of ethanol and you get an unusual and unique aroma. I get the usual stout like tastes of chocolate and roast but this one has a bit more going on. I get a spicy minty herbal character that almost gets to the point of turning me off, but then subsides. I am reminded of the woodiness that I get from Palo Santo Marron. Long lingering roasty and menthol finish. Medium body and carbonation with a creamy/oily mouthfeel. I'm not sure I would call this a RIS, but then again how would you classify it? I was put off with the herbal flavors a little bit at first, but as I polished off my first glass it was growing on me.

I think it adds an earthy herbalness and is a bit sharper than hops. My wife, however, thought it was a menthol-like mess and didn't like this at all. Kudos for the effort. Pours black with a beige head that settles to a ring. Smells chocolatey, and with notes of molasses, and a dusty spiciness. In the taste you get an interesting blend of chocolate, more herbalness, some clean but not too sweet honey notes, a bit of spice, and a fairly sharp herbal finish. Smooth and mouthcoating, with a bite. Quite nice and very interesting.","Georgiabeer","Nov 10, 2010"

Nose suggests dark, roasted malt, cocoa nibs and artificial sweetener. Taste follows nose, with the addition of a honey character, a hint of cardboard and a muted spicy/earthy quality that his hard to characterize but I would assume is attributable to the gesho root. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a mild, even carbonation, a trace of acidity and a pleasant, creamy texture. Definitely one of DFH's more drinkable experimental brews.

4,-4.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Notes: For something built up on provocative fusion this feels a bit tamed, a bit of an exercise in composure, and it does it well.

In any case, it all comes together in nice sync and makes for a good brew, albeit one that I will probably not think much of after this tasting.","Daniellobo","Oct 18, 2010"

The taste is perfectly balanced with roasted malts and an undertone of honey, but very silky and luscious on the palate-Not sticky sweet.

3.83,-8.6,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"D - This is a strange one, it looks extraordinarily dark, but doesn't have the sort of intense roast character that I would have expected. There is a lot of dark, sugary malt and spice in this beer. Molasses and dark caramel dominates the aroma and flavor with some earthy spice thrown in to keep things interesting. It is relatively dry, especially considerign the sugar character, but a bit more bitterness, either from grain or hops would have made this a more drinkable beer. This might improve with age, but it leans more toward sweetness than roast, and to me that argues against it being a beer that will really benefit from time in the cellar.","nickfl","Oct 12, 2010"

Can't quite pin what the spices are, but I'm imagining it's the gesho root. MF was full and creamy (though this doesn't seem to be the consensus opinion--it wasn't especially thick, though, just pleasantly creamy). Decent drink.

The aromas are similar to cocoa nibs and bit of coffee. Other smells I detect range from oak to woodsy characters like maple. I believe that I detect a hint of orange zest as well on the nose trailed by the alcohol vapor. The taste is unbelievably good. The flavors I believe exist are cocoa powder, the hint of coffee, marshmallow, what seems to be the smooth spiciness of root beer, some either molasses or brown sugar as well as some honey mixed it to smooth it all together. Damn, this thing is smooth as silk for being this high of gravity. If it weren't for the alcohol, which you can barely taste in my opinion, I could seriously drink this all night long.

The taste is nearly identical, though the honey lends a decent amount of unique sweetness in there as well. Strangely, the finish is rather abrupt, as though the flavors were flash evaporated (remember all that science-y crap we learned from Armageddon and History Channel shows about the end of the world?). Weird. The body is a stolid medium, with a light carbonation and a very smooth feel (almost nitro-tap smooth). Overall, this beat out the test batch.

Pitch black liquid, full opacity with nary a trace of color. Thick roast to a nose that is otherwise motor oil thick, dark chocolate, chicory, vanilla powder, café au lait, little bit more orange marmalade than pine or flowers, eventually run down by maraschino cherry and raspberry jam fruit accents, eventually becomes so dense you can't parse much more out. Full-bodied, the carbonation has fluff factor and adds to the overall creamy mouth feel. Coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, honey and caramel vivid but actually not that sweet. Comes off more as slow roasted than crisp and toasty. The florality struggles to be heard. Hint of clove, cinnamon stick spice. More brioche than bread or yeast. Loses some palate weight at the end but there's sufficient retronasal action to keep it alive. Impressively scaled, curiously could stand to be sweeter.","farrago","Sep 30, 2010"

It definitely is beginning to taste better and more well-balanced as the beer warms up a bit. This beer has a nice thick feel to it without being chewy or too creamy.

It's a very good imperial stout, but with all the innovation and creativity they cross to Miles' music, I didn't taste the connection. It's a deep brown/ red stout when poured with a heavy cocoa scent.

4.8,14.6,5,5,5,5,4,"It smells very roasted with some sweetness in the background. It almost reminds me of the Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale with the way it smells but this has more sweetness in it. The taste is so smooth and rich its ridiculous. Like I said before it has that taste of the Dogfish Head Indian Brown ale but with less carbonation (if any at all) and less hops. You can tell they not only use the hops but something different to give it that different bitter taste on the back end which would be that gesho root. The honey they use in this doesn't so much give it a honey taste but rounds out the beer by making it smooth, thick and silky in texture. Stouts aren't my very favorite but this to me is the 90 minute IPA of stouts. With that higher alcohol content and richer full body taste. I'm really liking this one and haven't found a limited release or year round release from Dogfish Head that I don't like. I usually wouldn't have many of the flavors and ingredients they use in their beer but whenever I have their crazy recipe beers I always end up liking them because of the blend and the way they use them in the beer.

The flavor is rich and pretty big but not too overpowering. It's a bit sweet, not necessarily from the honey, but it works well and possibly speaks to cellaring potential. The flavor has an interesting herbal/earthy tone, presumably from the gesho. Some licorice and a fair bit of tobacco are also present. Mouthfeel is smooth and fairly thick.

I get more of the same from the flavor, along with some licorice, and pepper. What really strikes me is how smooth and silky this beer is. The flavor profile is also extremely mild, with each taste working with the other pretty seamlessly. The ABV is right where it should be with this one; drinkable but with not enough alcohol to completely knock you out. Overall one of the better beers I have had from DFH in a while. They should make this year round. Also, I plan on holding on to the bottle for the cool artwork. Cheers","jamie2dope","Sep 02, 2010"

4.15,-1,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"D - Goes down quick, so it's damn good! Not the best RIS I've had, but a really nice brew from DFH, who didn't seem to have a mainstream RIS until now, props!","LiquidCucumber","Sep 01, 2010"
4.33,3.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D: A very good beer, very much like the typical RIS but has something a little different. A nice taste and no sign of it being 9%, dangerous as always. Bought two bottles, 1 will be aged. Dogfish has been hyping this beer and it was just as I suspected....delicious.","mavbrew","Sep 01, 2010"
4,-4.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Bitches Brew, a good Miles Davis album, but far from his best. On the other hand, this might be the best Dogfish Head beer I've tried. Black and opaque in appearance with a dark brown collar on top. Black licorice and dark chocolate aroma, sharply roasted and bordering on tarry. Very balanced palate, semi-charred malt hits the tongue for a brief moment, but it becomes sweet and honey-like in the mid-palate. Black licorice, peppery spice, full in body with a mildly bitter and chocolatey finish. Pretty damn good, nice job DFH.","largadeer","Aug 31, 2010"

4.05,-3.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The drinkability was really good, I enjoyed it in my small ass snifter. Went well with a cheeseburger. With that said a bottle would be a chore but would go great at tastings etc. Very true to style with a slight DFH twist, Back to basics.","BARFLYB","Aug 31, 2010"
4.95,18.1,5,5,5,4.5,5,"Attention Dogfish Head: Just because this beer is out to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Miles Davis' album doesn't mean you should just abandon it now that you've brewed it. It's the perfect imperial stout to have in your lineup and you'd be denying everyone of a lot of beer enjoyment if you give up on it now. One of the best stouts in the world - an instant classic.","mfunk9786","Aug 31, 2010"
3.65,-12.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Beer is medium bodied and has no carbonation in the mouth. It tastes good, I guess there's some honey coming through in there but I don't get the other ingredients. I suppose it would help if I had heard of any of them but I suppose that's the charm of DFH, here's a beer that tastes like a food you've never had because it a moss that only grows on the south side of tree bark in the arctic circle. Drinkability is good, very smooth beer. I'd have it again if it were less than a $1 / ounce, otherwise I could do without.","drabmuh","Aug 31, 2010"
4.1,-2.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I think the fermented honey made this beer very special and provided a different flavor profile that allowed the roasted character to come out while allowing other flavors to join in the party.","Soonami","Aug 31, 2010"
4.23,1,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: Really enjoyed this beer. Very easy drinking stout. I had no problems finishing the bottle myself. Didn't get much honey or spice (from the gesho root) with had intrigued me when I first read about it. Worth grabbing if you see it","Brez07","Aug 30, 2010"
4,-4.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability is OK. This is a bit unique beer like DFH is known for. Not sure I will buy this one again. It is OK but I can get Stone RIS for half the price.","Zorro","Aug 29, 2010"

3.7,-11.7,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"D - This would be a very good stout if it wasn't so alcoholic in its taste but right now thats just killing this beer for me maybe after two years or so this will be good","armock","Aug 29, 2010"
4.14,-1.2,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"The appearance was a very dark brown, almost looking like oil in the glass since there was nearly no head present other than a small film. The smell was very nice. Very sweet touching on caramels, chocolate, honey and a smokiness. Taste included a dark cocoa malt with a good amount of honey mixed in. It is full bodied with a creamy feel and a smoky finish hiding the alcohol very well. I feel that it got a much nicer as it got closer to room temperature as it completely removed the small bitterness present while chilled.","Vaison","Aug 28, 2010"
4.6,9.8,5,5,4.5,5,4,"this beer pours black with a brown head and it smells great mostly of a chocolate with a hint of honey and brown sugar. at first there's a mild metallic taste to the beer but as it warms up it completely disappears it tastes similar to a chocolate stout but with a well balanced honey finish, very malty but well balanced in the hops as well. theres no afterbite which makes this beer phenomenal. i wish i had the patience to age this because man could've been my favorite beer but i was impatient. i dont know how many of these i could drink but this beer is awesome i wish it wasn't only being brewed once.","roar1345","Aug 28, 2010"

4.56,8.8,5,4,4.5,5,5,"This was a very tasty beer, drank at cellar temperature, poured for about 5 or 6 people and all loved it. Silky mouthfeel, chocolate and honey sweetness, perfectly balanced bitter cocoa/cacao, coffee. No thin beer here, exceptionally full bodied, balanced with lightness on the palate. A beer that tantalizes the senses. Thank you Dogfish and Matts.","generationmy","Aug 26, 2010"

4.02,-4.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"The flavor profile was dark chocolate and malt heavy which then eased into a nice balance of sweetness from the honey and slight hop bitterness. At the end, however, was this unsatisfying dryness that coated my tongue and roof of my mouth. I'm guessing that it was from the root? Not sure, but it wasn't working for me. The brew overall was quite sweet tasting; I would've liked a bit more complexity. Mouthfeel was typically silky and smooth, but left that cotton-mouthed dryness at the end. Drinkability was fairly quick, as me and a couple friends were breezing through our glasses. Easily a drinkable beer and worth a try of this eccentric brew.","infi","Aug 18, 2010"
4.4,5,4,4,4.5,4,5,"Ahh the big beer-drinkability paradigm, all I can say is that it is what it is. For a 9% sweet Russian Imperial Stout this is extremely easy to drink, but others might say that it was quite a chore so who knows. As far as my opinions on this beer, I loved it and ever more so as it warmed up a little bit which really helps some of the subtle nuances shine though on this complex beer. Sam and Dogfish Head have done it again creating a excellent beer with non-traditional ingredients while keeping the flavor and style in tact. I would say if you get a chance to try this beer go for it because this will be a limited release that you sure don't want to miss.","Bmoyer0301","Aug 16, 2010"
4.2,0.2,4,4,4,4,5,"Impression: Quite a delicious stout, one I'm certain to revisit, though I doubt it's a candidate for the cellar (worth a try though).","cavedave","Aug 12, 2010"
4.25,1.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Large capped bottle from DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY. Bottled in 2010 etched onto the glass. Pours black, very dark mocha head, dense, staying, sheeting, lacing, quality look to this one. Earthy, more mocha, lightly herbal in the nose. This is a super smooth and easy drinking RIS, showing NO signs of 9%. Notes of dark chocolate, cafe au lait, and stouty goodness. Love the smooth mouthfeel here. High quality and highly tasty. Nice night capper or with a rich dessert.","Billolick","Aug 09, 2010"
