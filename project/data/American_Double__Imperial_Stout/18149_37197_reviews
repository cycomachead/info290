"On draft in a Lost Abbey tulip glass. Wouldn't guess that it is 11%. Alcohol very well hidden with the malt"
"Wow! More stouts should use this as their barometer - perfect as far as I can tell."

"Nothing went right with this beer......big mess!"
"And not a hint of alcohol in this monster beer. Master brewing."
"tasted a 1 yr old bottle.  dark brown and totally opaque.  sweet aroma. notes of fruit.  sweetness and bitter on the tongue but very thin.  i like a stout that i can almost chew.  overall, a very good stout."
""
"Overall: This is one big, badass brew. It almost tastes like a barrel aged beer but isnt. Ton of vanilla and smoke. The hop bitterness hides the alcohol well, and i imagine that subsiding tremendously with age, letting the malt aromas come out more. This is one of the better examples iv had, and if not for the hop presence, would be out of this world"

"Not a fan of this one. Two much roast and carbonation. Very dry. Has a big fruity flavor that I didn't like."

"Solid imperial stout. Strong flavor without a burn"
"On draft into a tulip at Growlers, Bella Vista, Philadelphia, PA. Nice fluffy head, 4 cm. great beer."

"Very flavorful, not as dry as many imperial stouts. Would happily drink again."

"Good tasting coffee notes, chocolate is good too"

"O: Love it! I laughed, I cried, my sin nature lashed out and ensared me in a cosmic fall from grace. Totally worth it. Highly recommended for the lover of darkness."
""
""
"O: Very impressed. I've tasted about 4-5 Lost Abbey beers within the last month and all but one has impressed me. Serpent's Stout falls in this category. This is a big coffee, dark chocolate, dark fruit, dry finishing stout. Very drinkable for 11%. Definitely going to pick up  a few bottles to cellar. My only complaint is that I wish Lost Abbey would package their beers in 4 or 6 packs."

"Pitch black look with a four finger head. Lacing is pretty weird. Initial taste explodes my mouth with fruity flavor with a subtle coffee and chocolate taste. I sense some tart fruits like berries and figs. On top of that, the alcohol is extremely well hidden. The only problem is that the alcohol is very present at the finish"

"Overall: Serpent's Stout is aptly named--this beer is both good and evil. It drives itself to the brink of being too sweet, but is pulled back by smoke and fire in the form of roasted malt and alcohol. It's an overall sensation of being so good it's bad--a dangerous pleasure...forbidden fruit, indeed. In the end, it was almost too much to take, but who doesn't like a little walk on the wild side?"

"One of my top 5 imperial stouts. Goose Island, Founders, Deschutes, the Serpent's and then the placeholder which fits in all  the rarer stouts that can't really quantify for lists because they're impossible to get.  This Lost Abbey is doing a great job at my only of the beer categories (I'm allergic to most beers but stouts get by passably).  My wife's a completely different catagory of beer drinker than me and she swears by Lost Abbey's other offerings as much as I like this stout.  Serpent's Tail  warms well, I want it warm enough so the flavors expand horizontally and beneath the tongue... at these warmer temperatures, the viscera of the beer really gets turned inside out: the smokiness moves your intestines, you feel fumigations of sweet fruits and the strong  alcohol burn.  Very rich stout with mellow carbonation.  Drink it slowly enough to last a three hour computer session and the flavors keep on unfolding as the imperial burn intensifies.  One time I was having one of their bottles and my wife kissed me and she thought I'd been smoking and drinking odd brews with shamans in Peru because of my breath.  That's how deep the fermentation goes.  Keep it up Lost Abbey."

"2500th review! 750 ml bottle into snifter, 2013 vintage bottling. Pours dense pitch black color with a 2 finger fairly dense dark brown head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, dark bread, smoke, light char, molasses, raisin, plum, light licorice, and roast/smokey earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance of big dark/roasted malt and light-moderate fruitiness; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, dark bread, smoke, molasses, light char, raisin, plum, light licorice, herbal, and roast/smokey earthiness. Good amount of herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, dark bread, smoke, molasses, light char, raisin, plum, light licorice, herbal, and roast/smokey earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of intense dark/roasted malt, light-moderate fruitiness, and light earthy hop flavors; with an awesome roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and moderately slick/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible imperial stout! All around amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of intense dark/roasted malt, light-moderate fruitiness, and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. An extremely outstanding offering."

"Overall, I was not very impressed. When I read Serpent's Stout, I started thinking of something slithery, poisonous, and big. This brew's name mislead me. If it was named The Lost Abbey Snake Stout, I probably wouldn't be as disappointed. As for being a serpent, :("

"But because of the booze the dark malts and dark fruit tend to get a little buried but this is still an outstanding beer. I should have bought two and tried it 2 years from now when the alcohol bite faded a little."

"Overall: Short review as I feel like a douche on my phone. But this is a really good beer. I'm definately going to have to be on the lookout for this in stores."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very well balanced, big stout. Nice malts, coffee, chocolate and mild vanilla flavors all very well integrated with each other. Top notch stout for sure. Time has mellowed it well."

"The carbonation keeps the body feeling lighter and more of a medium body. Ends dry."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Though everything we've had from The Lost Abbey has been great, this one was a huge surprise. Maybe it was the nearly two and a half years in the cellar that did the trick, but this one was probably the best, straight-up imperial stout we have had yet. A new favorite, and one that would be fun to age more of"

"2013 Vintage corked and caged 750 ml bottle grabbed off the shelves on my visit to Hoboken. Pours pitch black with a massive dark brown head that lingers a good while. Big chocolate and roast aromas, some dark fruits, and some smoke and char. Flavor is big smoke and char, more char, roastC some chocolate covered raisins, then a bitter smokey finish. Not what I was expecting but a nice surprise. Medium bodied with low plus carbonation. Sweetens up as I go. Not bad."
""
""
"O-A solid stout, more on the burnt side but it was not a detraction."
""
""
""

"O-Overall great stout, need more"

"O: A big, roasty stout. I thoroughly enjoyed this one. My buddy noticed some barrel characteristics, but as far as I know this one doesn't touch an oak barrel. Very tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall an average stout. Very heavy on the roast/char. Difficult to tell the malt/hops balance with all the roasted flavor. If you like very heavily roasted stouts this is for you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Its pours totally black with a small khaki head. The nose is all sweet chocolate, chocolate pudding and maybe some coffee. The taste follows the noise closely though maybe some burnt marshmallow thrown in. While it was delicious, it began to be a little much for me by the end of the pour and I found a little single noted as it warmed. It went down thick and easy with medium carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Alcohol is extremely well hidden. Such an incredible stout."
""
""
""
"Starts off like deeply toasted biscuits and ends like dark powdered cocoa. Chewy body. No notable alcohol warmth. Long aftertaste of burnt toast and black coffee."

""
""

""
""
""
""

""
""
"Appearance is thick and black with brown head and nice lace. Aroma starts with nice roast, chocolate, and coffee. Some fruity sweetness comes to the surface from the Belgian yeast. Taste is very well balanced with emphasis on roast and chocolate. Some dark fruits and molasses are present but tame. Mouthfeel is full with moderate carbonation. Overall, very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this for the first time on tap at a local restaurant. Appearance in a pint glass was black as coal. Very chocolaty smell and taste. Extremely smooth going down. Very pleasurable taste and mouthfeel. A great sipper any time as I'm a stout lover. First time with any beer from Lost Abbey. Nice job. I would seek this out again if I ever saw it."

"In the feel, the body shows a fullness without being overly weighty. It's big for sure but not as thick on the tongue as many. Dryness runs all the way through it, but the sweetness keeps up and a certain creaminess lifts it a bit. There's no acridity or harshness, even as the dryer notes hit the palate in the finish."

"Taste is dusty cocoa powder with a surprising amount of hoppy bitterness still. Black licorice pervades and it is not really a stout to my liking. It reminds me of Nightstalker. The mouthfeel is silky yet I wish there was more sweetness. This one just isnt really for me...I had a fresher sample a few times and liked it about the same as this aged version."

"At 11+% this is waaay to easy to drink. Very rich and filling. Almost a perfect dessert beer! I bought this with a year on it, but I bet it could sit for a few more years and gain more character. Fuck yeah Lost Abbey, fuck yeah!"

"What a terrific stout. This one is one to sip slowly and revel in it 's balance. It has a terrific legend on the back of the bottle and some artwork to go with that. It lives up to it's name alright and is the perfect companion for a lazy sunday morning. I can easily spend the day with this."
""
"O: Good example of the double stout style. A lot of roasted flavors."

"O: Wow, gotta say I was surprised. I've had several Lost Abbey beers and they've all been disappointments. Infection, flat bottles, odd flavors, etc.. This one being the oldest I figured was doomed from the start. It was excellent! Just like how I enjoy my big stouts. Big roasted malt character with lots of chocolate. Pretty simple, no adjuncts that I can detect and no barrel aging. Just great roasted malt. Flavors are balanced and super well integrated. No booziness. Goes down so easily. Excellent."
""
"mouthfeel is a category I probably take the least stock in for most brews but I believe it applies for stouts and heavier. this one is great in its creamy texture and feel, and in its heaviness. perhaps because it's my first for the evening and I am thirsty after the salty lunch I had, but this one really hits the spot. 11% isn't even a factor in any way. ranking it against the others of this style, I feel it is superior in taste and feel. they all have the 'chocolate' and espresso and all, and are successful to a certain degree. but this one really seems to blend the features so well without the harsh boundaries."

"Overall: Really a delicious stout, the chocolate flavors were more predominant when the beer was colder, which is unusual. I liked it better before it became warmer, but still enjoyed the beer greatly overall."
"O: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easy, a bit filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this beer certainly seems to have held up quite well with age and is a very good big stout worth drinking for a long time."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - As far as stouts are concerned, it really doesn't get much better than this, if at all. I have never had this until now. Always wanted it, but could never find it. This beer does not shit the bed. I am increasingly becoming more and more of a fan of The Lost Abbey. Easily one of the best craft breweries out of the US. Rich, complex and hearty. The kind of beer Vikings would have lapped up before terrorizing a small village. Definitely pick this up if you run into it."
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent beer overall. I have never had a fresh version but this one was a treat to have. Needs more body for sure. I like the coffee and chocolate flavors but thin and dry. Thanks again for the beer 011x0110."

"D - Great imperial stout. Good overall balance and mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'll buy this again. It's big in a lot of ways, and is certainly unique. Between the toffee flavor and sour backend, you're going to get something different here. It's a refreshing taste from the smooth, caramel, coffee stouts. If you're looking for a quality stout and something different, this is it."

"Overall, an enjoyable very full flavored strong stout."

"Overall a great tasting beer in the stout realm. The most interesting thing was the pattern left with the last glass of beer. It embodied a snake which was very interesting, couldn't figure out if it was left over after barrel yeast and grains but it was tasty. Floated to the top of the glass and was a little syrupy but very tasty."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Big. Very big. Tasty well-made overall"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: ok, so I will admit that I am not the biggest fan of LA. But this is definitely an awesome brew, and definitely worth a try. It lacks the complexity that I seek out in this style, but it is very well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice alternative to the sweeter and barrel aged stouts out there, and delivers straight forward bold roast stout flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"These were going fast at my local beer shop, and I can see why. Big, complex flavors with excellent balance. Excellent brew."
"What a real shelf turd."
""
""
""
"On the palate, rich dark chocolate that takes a turn toward astringency leading to a dry finish. Nicely balanced. Smokey, roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate dominate. Some dark currant. The vigorous carbonation from the bottle conditioning is not harsh but actually quite soft, although the beer is a little too thin. Despite an 11% ABV and the alcohol on the nose, there is little booziness on the palate. A sinfully good stout that's dry, chocolatey, and smooth."
""
""
""
"Overall, an excellent example of the style. I'll buy it again."
""
""
"O- if there was more carbonation in this, it would be incredible. Alas, it's still pretty damn good"

"O: Excellent beer, my favorite from Lost Abbey. Highly drinkable for 11%"

"Verdict: A big, bold, boozy Imperial Stout from The Lost Abbey, and one that is fairly rewarding. The flavors are mildly complex, nicely balanced but the alcohol is still very pesky and doesn’t really let this beer shine the way it could. Definitely one to check out if you like a big rich Imperial Stout."

"Overall: Very good. This beer was bottled almost a year ago and had a very subtle taste compared to a bottle of this beer I've had before. I've always been happy with the Lost Abbey line, never blown away but very happy."

"I must say that I am rather impressed with this one. It's a very fluffy, full-flavored stout. All of the things we love about imperial stouts are there. The malts mesh perfectly. There is just enough hops to give it that dark chocolate/dark coffee bitterness. It's ridiculously drinkable for such a strong beer. After sharing one bottle with a friend, I can't say I can totally distinguish it from other great imperial stouts, but I wouldn't hesitate to grab one again and try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's awesome. I think this beer is ready to drink now and it should improve over age (hoppiness will be toned down a bit). Best $5.99 I spent on beer ever and I have about 16 oz more to finish... (with no help from my preggo wife)."
""
""
""
""
"Shouldn't this beer be categorized as a Russian Imperial Stout? It sure drinks like one. For what a bottle of this costs, I suppose it seems a little over-priced with great stouts like Ten Fidy and Stone's IRS lurking around at lower prices. Still, this stout is exceptional and very pleasant to drink on a chilly night after dinner."
""
"O- I think I wanted this bottle to be better, because it had aged for about a year. Nonetheless, it is an incredible stout and I look forward to having it again sometime! Grab 'em when you can!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - An all around excellent stout. Flavor has everything I was expecting and more - the complexity increases as it warms. Alcohol is barely noticeable. This is easily one of the best stouts I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A good stout but to far on the bitter end for me to really love it."
""
""
""
"Overall, a really nice big, sweet imperial stout that delivers on that regard. The flavors are definitely big but they balance out well enough to be drinkable. I think the age I opened my bottle is pretty close to optimal. The booze is not overwhelming and definitely feels mellowed, but the flavors don't feel muted. I definitely might get this again for the cellar. Very solid. I definitely would like to see a barrel aged variant of this beer available."
"O – This is a great stout. There’s nothing out of the ordinary when it comes to unique aromas or flavors (minus the hazelnut), but it’s extremely well done. One of the most remarkable aspects is how drinkable the beer is for being 11% ABV. I’m really glad I got to try this one. This is going to be a fun night polishing off a 750 mL bottle myself. Thanks, James!"
""
""
"Overall: a very good beer indeed, but I feel like it needs a little je ne sais quoi to reach perfection."
""
"Drinkability: It is a great stout, although bitterness is a little too pronounced for my taste. The Alcohol content is very warming."
"O: this is an excellent imperial stout, thick, delicious and creamy, one of my new found favs in this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A damn good imperial stout. Depth and complexity, well-balanced (considering the relatively high ABV%)."
"Overall a wonderful soild example of the style, and really balanced and not a boozy mess, and very drinkable. Delicious."
""
"Utterly black. Thick, viscous, almost-syrupy. This beer is topped with a dark tan head. Nice appearance. The smell has a smoke and booze quality about it...heavily roasted malt and grain. Some wood and dark-roast coffee notes. The taste, however, really stands out. Bitter, rich, intense, and deep. The coffee and grain qualities really come out. Lots of warmth. I'm having this in the wrong season...it would be great in the winter. Thick and mougthfilling. I sincerely enjoyed this one."

"Review from 7/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark brownish black with a medium tan head with no lacing. Aroma of dark roasted malt and dark fruit. Flavor is delicious chocolate, dark roasted malts, hops and fruit. A bit boozy in the malt and hop finish. Very nicely made."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Good roasty flavors. To much alcohol and not enough complexity. The good side of decent, but not something I'm going to go out of my way for again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is opaque and the color of bittersweet chocolate. The finger of tan head does not stick around very long. Nose is surprisingly weak because the flavor is quite full and bold. There is plenty of roasted malt here - nearly everyone will be satisfied with the roast profile (and then some). The rich body of this offering reminds us that it is a real sipper. This offering finished well with some additional hints of roasted malt bitterness. As this offering warmed, the alcohol bite increased to nearly unpleasant."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.5): Very solid imperial stout. This one gets better with age and I'm glad I have another in the cellar."
"Split a bomber of this on a roof top deck on a hot Baltimore night. Pours thick like motor oil, roasty aroma. Taste is pretty boozy, nice chocolate notes, coffee, roasted malt. Nice and creamy taste. A definite sipper for sure, this one was a bit more heavy on the alcohol than what I would like which kills the smoothness, but overall a nice beer to give you a kick in the pants with plenty of flavor."
""
""
"O: Top 5 in the style in my opinion. Incredible stuff."
""
""
"Pours black with excessive mocha head and residual spotty lace. Smells of oats, hops, coffee and cocoa. A bit resiny for my tastes, reminds me of young 10/50. Chocolate, leather and tobacco come into the flavor profile and ride across the cavity. Nice earthy aftertaste. Medium on thin bodied for the style with hi carb and an off dry finish. Overall nice beer, needs tweaks in the mouthfeel department, but that's par for the coarse there in San Marcos."

"O - Winner. Its hallmark is its richness and depth. Lots of different things going on, not all easily defined. This would be a treat anytime, appreciated."
"Overall, this is excellent stout, the flavors wide-ranging and complex, but working together in great harmony. The extra shot of ash and tobacco at the end of the swallow is a very nice closing touch as well. I did find the high grapefruit notes somewhat counterintuitive to the blackness, and the alcoholic vapors in the aftertaste were a bit much, but even with that, I’d easily purchase another bottle or three of this one."

"O: Very enjoyable. Great use of roasted malts."
"bottled jan 6th 2012, ive been cellaring this one for some time. pours an impossibly black midnight color with a 3 inch darker than mocha head, lasts forever, sexy lacing. smells very very very very dark, bitter to a degree, even a bit tart from the yeast. dark chocolate and espresso are intense. flavor is more coffee than chocolate, a little woody, very alcoholic. booze comes out even more as it warms, almost burning. some faint tobacco notes as well, tar and resin of burnt organic matter. feel is good not great, its full bodied but not heavy really at all. carbonation is a little more than average. feels nice, but leaves a residue in the mouth, this is a real serious stout. i love the writing on the label as well. overall a wonderful stout, nice to share. lost abbey is one the my favorites."
"Lost Abbey Serpent's Stout pours an intimidating black. The three or so fingers of cocoa colored foam that crowns the beer just sits there like some kind of mousse. Head retention is great, and the head leaves plenty of lacing in its wake. The nose doesn't really leap out the glass, but there are some chocolate and licorice aromas present, the former slightly more than the ltter. . The first thing that comes to mind when sipping on the beer is a chocolate milk shake. There's a fairly strong anise flavor, as well as some overly roasty grain. I don't mind those as supplementary/background notes, but thy're just a tad too present for me to truly love the flavor profile. The body here is nice and chewy, with a suitably understated carbonation. Serpent's Stout is far from an attention getting stout in terms of quality, but there are certainly plenty of less noteworthy ones in the market as well."

"O: Its a good beer, no doubt, but its not positioned perfectly in my wheelhouse; I still prefer a handful of other stouts."
""
""
"O- Three thumbs up. A near-perfect imperial stout. This is definitely a must-try beer. I cannot wait until next winter, so I can pick up some more of this. I think that this beer is perfect for aging. The only negative experience of drinking this beer is trying to get the cork out. It's simply a perfect representation of the style, and it will leave you wanting more."
"O: I love this beer. I wasn't sure about it at first, but after letting it warm, it is absolutely outstanding. A very worthy non-barrel aged imperial stout that is certainly worth seeking out."
""
"Cheers."
"Recommended."
"Cost: $11.99 for a 750 ml bottle."

"Overall, I can't wait to drink this again. In fact, I'm getting some more as soon as I feel safe enough to walk to the passenger seat."
""
"O - Really enjoyed this one with my dad, but wish the EtOH was a little more subtle at its 11%, but really nice smokey finish."
""
""

"Overall - What a gorgeous and wonderful feeling sipper! This really opens up as it warms, and is absolutely delicious. A wonderful imperial stout that must be tried and experienced."

"I enjoyed this more than the hop bite in Old Rasputin. Much recommended. I'm so glad I have another bottle in the refrigerator."
"Poured into a 20 oz Duvel tulip, bottle dated 12/29/11. Pours a slick black, no light penetration, with a massive 4 inch mocha head that leaves plenty of lacing, and slowly settles into a solid film of foam. Smell is big expresso, some molasses, smoke, fig, leather,and tobacco. Taste is huge roested expresso, with everything from the nose, but with tiny supporting roles. Body is medium large, plenty of life, a touch dry like you would expect, and amazingly drinkable for its large ABV. This beer first caught my attention at EBF, when it was my favorite beer of the day. Excellent Stout!"

"Pairs well with snickers."

"O: Try it if you are able to. This is one of my favorite stouts."

"O: Thick and rich dark roasted treat that is bitterly sweet with an well concealed alcohol detection that will no doubt sneak up and bite you later like a hidden serpent."
""
""
"Overall: a wonderful imply stout, complex, rich, quite drinkable."
""
""
"O: A true coffee stout. Strong and intense."
""
"Overall, wonderful balance. A bit hoppy, but it works -- very close to being overdone in that department -- pulled back at the last second. Alcohol is present, and moderately well hidden. WOrth a try for sure."
"Definitely grab it while still on the shelves."
""
""
""
""
"O: I appreciate the smoky and bitterness to this stout. Most stouts I've had recently have leaned towards the sweeter/maltier side so this is a nice change of pace. Finally a stout that is both full-bodied but dry."
"Overall- This is a fantastic imperial stout. It has a wonderfully balanced flavor along with a very nice aroma and mouthfeel. Good stuff!!"
"Perfect way to end the day. Poured from bottle to Duvel tulip the beer arrives a deep rich black color with dark brown edges and a nice 2 finger red brown head. Excellent retention and some lacing. A huge bouquet of vanilla, bourbon, roast, dark fruit, earthy hops, chocolate on the nose. Very inviting aroma. The flavor follows suit with a rich and full bodied flavor: Roast upfront with hints of molasses and oak, after wards the vanilla, bourbon, dark fruit and malty sweetness are present to provide a well balanced beer. Mildly bitter. Finishes rich with a linger roast and light bourbon vanilla on the tongue. Very good. Full bodied and well carbonated. Creamy and smooth. Overall, this is a treat. Very good Imperial Stout. I would highly recommend, another hit from The Lost Abbey."

"O: An excellent beer, and a very good imperial stout. Not as stellar as I expected, but darn tasty nonetheless. Recommended wholeheartedly, though for the price I would think twice about buying again."
""
"This is a great stout and one of the better offerings from Lost Abbey."
"Wow, this one threw me for a bit of a loop. I'm usually a bit iffy on LA beers but this one really suited the moment on a cold night after I found out I'm losing my job. Cheered me up like a slice of devil's food cake."
"O: A very well done stout. I have one more so it will be interesting to see how this beer changes over time"
""
""
"Nothing surprising here... Poured a dark brown-black with a small, tan head; moderate lacing and retention. Aroma of coffee and cocoa, light sensation of dark fruits. Taste was roasty up front, flavors of dark chocolate and some coffee roastiness, dark fruit juices, and some warmth from the alcohol. Body was about medium; I feel this beer might be better if allowed to sit/age for a bit. Still pretty good overall."

"Don't recall this one fresh, but it had some borderline barrel aged characteristics to it aged."

"Final thoughts - 11% abv and $10 a pop! This beast is so nice. Can't wait to try an aged one!"
""
"O - A very good stout, easy to drink, great flavor; but beware, the 11% ABV packs a bit of a punch."
"Overall: I think this beer is better on tap, but damn good out of the bottle too. Exceptional? Not quite, but oh-so-drinkable! This was bottled on December 29 ’11 and consumed Feb 12 ’12, and yet no signs of heat or craziness. Smooth, chuggable. And probably worth the price too, since this is as big as a wine bottle."
"one of the better stouts you can find under $10"
""
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice gritty texture that goes really well with the flavor. Overall, I think this is an excellent beer."
"Overall: a wonderful double stout that is a meal in a glass. Slow drinking beer, but nicely satisfying."
"DOA"

"O - A great interpretation of an American Stout, pick up a bottle if you have a chance. It's hotter than most in the style, which really sets it apart for me. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly light maybe that is due to abv level and acid levels present. Overall a great stout"
""
""

""
""
"Overall, I was really glad to finally get to try a bottle of this stout. This was a really good example of the style."
"The Serpent's Stout pours a thick and dark brown with a mocha colored light head. After each joyous sip a signature bite of its strong alcohol aftertaste leaves its quick sting, but a coffee after thought remains on the tongue, reminding me to take another swig before my drink gets too warm. Onto finishing my drink as I rate this: wow!"
"Pours an opaque black with a 1/2 inch dark khaki head that fades to an oily film. Small dots and streaks of lace slowly drip back into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, coffee beans, and some alcohol aromas. Chocolate chip cookie dough aromas come out as the beer warms. Taste is of dark roasted malt, chocolate chip cookie dough, roasted coffee beans, and a slight alcohol kick on the finish. There is a very nice roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a light level of carbonation with a thick and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good stout with some awesome aromas and flavors."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was a phenomenal imperial stout. This was my first Lost Abbey beer and I was absolutely blown away. I'm definitely going to pick up another bottle and see how this one ages. It is worth the 11.99 that I paid. Exceptional!!"
""
""
"O: This beer is quite easy to drink because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste."
""
"O: Easy to drink and paired very nicely with buttery and chocolaty dessert."
""
"Overall a solid stout."
"Overall this beer is amazing and a really a nice treat on a cold night. Cant wait to go back and get another fill of this beer."
"Overall: I was excited to try some stuff from The Lost Abbey brewery and the reputation that follows them. And I must say I was really pleased and happy that I tried something since its new to Jersey. I will pick up some more of this and plan to try their other beers as well in the near and distant future."
"D - This is what I imagine Angel's Share would taste like pre-aging; a well executed stout, though a bit simple. It's a bit over-priced for what it is, but I'd have it again."
""
""
""
"Black as night with a foamy 2 finger head that had good staying power and left nice lacing. Smell is a bit subdued but quite nice, consisting of roasty malts, a little bit of burnt malts, coffee, dark chocolate. Taste is bolder and showcases the roasty malt most of all. Coffee and chocolate are there, as well as some notable alcohol and a little vanilla. Palate is rich, thick, and has a noticeable alcohol warming. Overall it’s quite a tasty one."
" ~ This is the kind of beer that can make a name for a brewery. I've had other beers from The Lost Abbey but I really think this one will stick in my mind. I recommend this to anyone who likes roasty dark beers. This is something that is certainly worth the time it may take to seek."

""
"O - Overall, a good, well-balanced stout from Lost Abbey, which is not a style that comes to find when I think of them. I thought the anise profile in the nose made this one stand out a bit compared to a normal stout"
""
""
""
""
""
"This one poured out as a nice looking black color with a thin tan/brown colored head on top. The smell of the beer was had a good amount of roasted malts on the nose along with some dark fruits and wooden aromas. The taste of the beer was rich with some dark chocolate notes coming through with a bitter aftertaste of burnt malts and caramel. The mouthfeel of the beer wasn't as heavy as I thought it should be. The carbonation was decent and it was still a drinkable brew. Overall it's not most impressive stout to me but I'm glad I gave it a try."
"Overall: This is a rare success in aging beer for me. This is outstanding. I much prefer this to the fresh 2011 version."
""
""
"Though quite dry and efforvescent, the lack of sweetness here allows the brunt of alcohol and burnt grain to reveal the rougher edges that cause slight difficulty in drinkability although the flavor profile sings praises. Unfortunately, heartburn inducing acids limit this beers ease of enjoyment."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: [Drinkability] Very good stout with excellent flavor and mouthfeel. Not being a huge Lost Abbey fan, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this beer. Would definitely order again."
"Some sweetness but by no means unbearable - The high abv% was well hidden , very easy to drink - I would have this again for sure."

""
""
""
""
"o: kept this one in the fridge for a few months waiting for a good occasion. had it with some spicy black bean soup and it was a great way to cut the heat. A good strong stout, and not nearly as heavy as some others, but the sweetness kept it from being a great one."

"Lost Abbey is know for its Belgians, but Serpent's shows that Tomme also knows his way around a stout. It’s an interesting take on the style, and its dense, smoky flavors would lend themselves well to barrel-aging — though the beer has enough whiskey flavor packed in there already that it almost doesn't need it. Probably my favorite of Lost Abbey's regular releases."

"Overall: If this bottle was carbed appropriately, this would definitely be an A beer. But its not. Its badly undercarbed. Still not a bad experience overall. I'll give another bottle a try if I can get one."
" overall this is a very well made RIS! Nice bold flavor,great chocolate notes.I would love to try this barrel aged!"
"This is a medium to full bodied brew that is smooth in the feel. A minor to moderate amount of carbonation. It is easy drinking with the 11% abv well integrated with a pleasant warmth and taste that is not completely hidden. The alcohol really comesnout with the dark fruited quality of this brew and even more so as it warms."
"O- Started rocky but came through to be decent once it warmed to a little higher than suggested temp. Not sure I would seek out again with all these other great imperial stouts out there, but I will not refuse an offer to drink a bit down the road. Again, very bitter, yet a big sweetie too!"
"O: This is a very delicious stout. It did have some high carbonation issues after first pour, but when allowed to settle it leads a full rich mouthfeel, and lot more of the flavor comes out. This is definitely a great imperial stout, which has a lot of great subtleties too it. Definitely a great beer."
"I generally try to avoid finishing a bomber to myself, but from the first glass knew I wouldn't be succeeding in that goal. This beer easily masks the 11% abv, and could probably support another couple percent. Overall, incredibly pleased by this best-in-class beer."
"overall impression: a good imperial stout. something that I will seek out again but a bit expensive."
"O: Good, interesting stout. However, I wouldn't go out of my way for it again given the price point and lack of distribution to me."
"O- I think the alcohol could've been a bit better masked but this is definitely an excellent beer."
"Overall very good beer I wish it was on shelfs by me. Thanks Vince"
"O: Since it was carbonated that made me happy right of the bat. There were some bonus points for that. Nice combination of flavors and the only knock was it was a little thin for me."
"Overall: Very impressed with this Imperial Stout from California. Will have to rank up there with other Imperial Stouts. Should be sharing this with somebody, but looks like I get to have this treat all to myself. Oh yeah and oh boy."
"O: For me I liked how this beer kept it simple, but did it very well. There weren't a lot of complex flavors, but what was there was there in force. Enjoy"
"This beer pours pitch black. There is alcohol,chocolate, roasted malts and vanilla in the nose; the taste is about the same. The mouthfeel is thick and sports a decent carbonation (many beers in this style seem to go for a more flat taste). This beer is huge. Had this on the same night as a 2010 Dark Lord, and Serpent Stout holds its own."
"Another solid beer from Lost Abbey."
"Overall: This was a great reward for a week of hard work around the house - I'd been saving this bottle for a special occasion and decided manual labor was worth rewarding. This is one of my favorites and I will certainly be seeking to trade for this in the near future."
"O- This is a very deceiving imperial stout. For how easy drinking this beer is you would never know that this is a 11% beer."
"Overall: This is a solid beer that has the mouthfeel of a barrel aged beer even though it did not get a barrel aging. really well made beer! Downside of this beer is the cost, but lost abbey has a reputation for high priced beers. So its to be expected. Also had this beer once before and it was much better the second time around."
"Overall, this is a pleasure to consume and is going to make my day at work tomorrow completely miserable. This beer coats the mouth and never relents with thick bitter coffee maltiness and copious drinkabiltiy because of the smooth aged complexity; wow. A very special beer indeed; better shared in my opinion because the intense flavors make it hard to get past 1 glass per evening."
"O: Really good stout. Big malt, big feel; loads of character. Packs a punch."
"O - This is an outstanding stout. Packs a robust flavour profile with a great thick mouth feel."
"Poured a black color with a large creamy brown head that lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy toasted chocolate malt, caramel and alcohol aroma. Heavy bittersweet toasted dark chocolte malt flavor with a heavy bittersweet and small alcohol bite finish of long duration. Full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. This is a standout beer."
"2/25/2011"
"3.5 D: Not a bad beer, but it'd be better if the booze was more in check. It's not that it's more boozy than I'd expect from an 11% brew, but top examples of the style are much less boozy and have the same or higher ABVs."
"Poured into my bruery tulip. Jet black with a finger mocha head. Aroma of oak, dark fruits and vanilla. Taste follows the nose with added coffee notes. Very smooth, hides alcohol well, moderate carbonation. This is an amazing beer that I will seek out and stock up for my cellar"
"Next time you come Sean you can bring some more..."
"Overall an outstanding example of an Imperial Stout. Affordable yet intriguing to the taste buds. Highly recommend."
"D- Very well done stout here. Flavors are nice and bold and have pretty good balance. Nicely done, nothing that overwhelmed but more than solid."
"Kind of strange how this is only $11 for a 750 bottle. . . I guess it doesn't sit in a barrel. Anyways, about the best price/quality ratio from LA."
"At beer revolution in Oakland , a must for us snobs. This beer was a delight. Smells like mocha. A smooth chocolate toasty feel upfront from the malts. You taste the bitter hops which works well with the malt towards the end and at the very end you taste the 11% but barely. The aftertaste numbs roof of the mouth but in a good way. Still tasty the toasty chocolate malts."
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a tulip glass. Pours an opaque black color with medium tan head along with nice lacing that lasted throughout the drinking session. Aroma is fairly roasty, with notes of dark chocolate and coffee, hints of anise and ash, touch of vanilla and dark fruit. Flavor is roasty, nutty, malty, ash, coffee, and a light helping of caramel. There is some alcohol hotness detected towards the finish which is fairly bitter, but tasty. Palate is a bit thick and medium bodied. This is a good imperial stout, but nothing to really make it stand out in an extremely crowded field."
"Overall a great beer that deserves every accolade it gets. One of my new top imperial stouts and worth the price."
"It pours a medium bodied dark, dark brown in color that turns black with a two finger, spongy and rootbeer float esque, dark khaki head. It smells of lightly roasted malts, soft milk chocolate, light coffee, with a light oaky smoke. The flavors consist of sweet milk chocolate, nice light roasted coffee, toffee, with a light bitter chocolate and slightly smoky finish. It's very nice, yet a little sweeter than anticipated. It's a pretty smooth drinker and pretty easy to drink. The 11% has nearly no presence at all. Overall this is a very good imperial stout and a fine beer from The Lost Abbey."
"Drink- I have traded this bottle at least 10 times and never tried it. I am going to have to actually drink a bottle now. Great stout."
"O- Great nightcap beer. I enjoyed it to the last drop and would most definitely recommend it although their are better beers of this style. Drinkability? Well I had the whole bottle and would have gladly had some more."
"Big thanks goes out to Kshock for this one in a past trade! Served from bottle into a Green Man snifter. Poured a massively dark brown almost black with a very minimal brown head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, and alcohol. The flavor was of roasted malt, dark chocolate, nutty, sweet alcohol, and caramel. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. This one was very booze forward without a doubt, so drink with caution. However, this mellows out as it reaches room temperature. Had a very nice roastiness and subtle bitterness to help balanced out the brew. At first the alcohol covered up quite a bit of the subtle flavors but they were allowed to come through upon warming and the dark chocolate flavor becomes more prominent. A definite must try!"
"Oh yeah. This is every bit as decadent as it ought to be, yet never too sweet, never too heavy, never too messy, while delivering bushels and bushels of hearty, rich, rounded US stout bad-ass-ness."
"O - Not as impressive as I was expecting. Not very complex and very coffee dominated. Bump is for its excellent appearance."
"This is a very nice stout. It nay not be the best I've ever had. But I'd certainly pick this up again."
"Overall: Deep, warming, dark, and thick. This stout is wonderful! All the dark stout flavors blended nicely for a very even stout. Not overwhelming, yet certainly not simple. A great choice for any lover of the dark and rich realm of stouts."
"O - Overall not my favorite stout but still a good offering. Good burnt flavors with some nice body to it."
"Overall I expected a lot more from this brew. The typical flavours were there but were very muted and the booze was not hidden very well at all. I have drank stouts that are 18% ABV and were less boozy. Very underwhelming to say the least..."
"o - the first glass was great. but i have a feeling it might be hard to finish this bottle by myself. i might grab another age for a couple years and hope some of that sweetness dies off, but definitely alright in my book."
"O- This beer sat in my basement for a while and it was wel worth it. Fantastic."
"Pours jet black with a light brown head. In the aroma, roasted malt, chocolate, and a sweet oatmeal. In the taste, a nice sweet and roasted malt with hints of chocolate. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry roast and dark chocolate in the aftertaste. Smooth and thinner than expected, but hides the 11% and tasty."
"D: Very large beer that will be a sipper. Age could do it some good but it’s very drinkable now."
"One of my favorites. I look forward to drinking a bottle all by myself. Of course the big ABV means a night of one and done."
"Full body, mild carbonation (no it's not flat), creamy and easy on the palate. Surprisingly easy to drink for the ABV and really nice flavor, a delicious imperial stout, I'm glad I have another bottle."
"O: I didn't know what to expect, but this was pretty impressive"
"O: Great stout, one of the better to date but not the best. I'd definitely buy again next year and compare an aged bottle to fresh."
"This is a sipper for such, but the alcohol level was not the reason, it was just that I wanted this bottle to last forever. Like most Imperial Stouts it greatly improved as it warmed in the glass."
"O: Seems like a good overall beer. Difficult to consume in large quantity but appropriate flavors for the category. Nothing terribly detrimental, but nothing exemplary either."
"O- Very tasty, smooth and creamy; Its drinks really well for such a big beer"
"The 11% ABV is intimidating but in no way a chore to sip. This is quite drinkable and goes down smoothly."
"Perhaps the anticipation was more than I could bare. As it warms and I sip, some of those initial spices are starting to poke out. The licorice is starting to come out. The smell is still amazing, but by the time it hits me tongue, I am still slightly disappointed. All in all this is a great beer, and one that I recommend everyone give a try."
"This is not the most complex nor subtle stout I've had but I am particularly fond of the taste regardless. This seems like a regular purchase type beer for me."
"overall this is a fantastic, well-crafted imperial stout. perhaps not a candidate for world class status, but highly enjoyable nonetheless."
"D: Decent drinkability. Still some booze taste in this one but a fine candidate for cellaring!"
"Overall- I love big stouts, and seem to always give them high scores, and this is one of the best ones I have had. Incredibly smooth beer, with a great depth of flavors. Very impressed, this 11% 750 is going down quite quickly. (Reminds me a lot of the 2010 Surly Darkness)"
"750mL Bottle recently split at a tasting that included the regular, the bourbon barrel and the barrel fermented versions. Pours black with a small tannish brown head. Smells of roast, chocolate and a bit of anise. Nice full body and creamy. The taste is like the nose. This beer has a really nice balance to the flavor, which becomes more evident against the other options. The anise element lingers in the flavor that coats the tongue. Really enjoyable. Low-medium carbonation. Very solid, drinkable imperial stout."
"Pours a deep black with a bit of brown mixed in. Coffee colored one-finger head. Nice lacing and retention for the style. Aroma of chocolate, dark fruits, coffee beans and alcohol. Rich flavor. Robust roasted chocolate, bittering coffee beans and dark fruit dominate. Bit of molasses and hint of cream as well. Some whiskey heat and the dark fruits linger a bit. Rich, decadent, creamy and well constructed."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. It's a big beer, there's no questioning that. I took my time with this beer and didn't even start writing this review until about halfway through my first glass and still have a little under halfway to go. I would love this beer in 12oz, but in a 750ml bottle, the sweetness, thickness, and alcohol really start to hinder its drinkability after a while. Definitely think about splitting this!"
"D - Liquorish is a bit strong. Nice body and overall flavor though."
"Notes: If not for the mouthfeel, this would probably be one of my top-rated Imperial stouts. Right in my wheelhouse in taste and smell. Assertive with great depth of roasted malt flavors."
"Had this on I think nitro tap. This beer pours completely pitch black with a nice one inch mocha colored head. The aromas a rich malty and there are hints of chocolate. The flavor is slightly sweet and roasty the abv is barely noticeable as this was my first beer of the night and I cowshed the pint faster then anyone else finished their session ales. This beer has a smooth as silk mouthfeel full bodied and is very drinkable based on how fast I consumed it. I will definitely be picking up a dew of these to age and might consider trading for chinchillas to try a blends barrel aged version"
"D-Very delicious and very easy to drink despite the alcohol. A very well done stout."
"Not my favorite but I respect it for what it is."
"Alcohol was well-masked and this drank extremely easily. Great balance of bitter and sweet with lots of traditional ""big stout"" flavors showing up to the party."
"D: This is very smooth and shows more anise flavors than any Imperial Stout except Stone IRS."
"D: As big as this beer is, it's very drinkable. Which is kinda dangerous with the 11% ABV. Definitely think this one will get better with age."
"T: Mostly dark chocolate and coffee with a nice earthiness to it. A bit of smoke works it's way in along with some dark fruits. The mouthfeel is very rich without being too thick. One of the better stouts I've had."
"Very good Imp stout. Not quite classic, but very good."
"This is a very drinkable beer, especially for its high alcohol content. I find it very balanced in its flavors, nothing really overpowers anything else. If I had the cash, I'd buy another bottle and age it to see how it develops. Yet another winner from Lost Abbey."
"D: Nice nightcap beer, lots of great flavors here with a ton of chocolate/roasted barley/coffee/dark fruits that really tastes nice. My only knock on this beer, which I thought I'd never say about a big beer from LA, is that it is too carbonated. Other than that, this isn't too darn bad. Pretty easy beer to split a bottle with the girlfriend while watching tv. I'll have to get another bottle next time I find some."
"D: Complex, dark, and deep. The only improvement would be to try aged version over the years. Very, very solid brew."
"D: A sipper... but a rather grand one at that. I would rank this up there with some of the best Imperial Stouts on the market."
"Poured a beautiful black opaque color, the head grew at a delayed pace, forming a picture perfect fine cap on this beer. Seductive aromas of dark chocolate, sweet malt, and booze. Strangely, the boozines is not evident in the flavor, this is a dangerously smooth beer for 11% ABV. Wonderful flavors of bittersweet chocolate with roasted malt and dark sticky fruits at the finish. A glorious beer."
"Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy for an imperial stout. This beer is far too drinkable for 11% abv. Honestly I can't taste the alcohol but my head tells me it's definitely there. Great beer, but the BB version trumps this. Great bottled Impy stout."
"On tap at the Dive Bar in Worcester this past weekend. Served in an 8 oz snifter. Dark brown body, with a creamy looking tan head. Looks irresistible when the bartender put it in front of me. Smell had a nice mocha and caramel aroma to it. Flavor was stellar. Smoky peat, coffee, chocolate, and black licorice all washed over my palate. I loved every sip. Mouthfeel was perfectly balanced between smooth and thick. Even at 11%, it was an easy beer to sip and enjoy; highly drinkable for an imperial stout. Another wonderful brew from Lost Abbey."
"D- Very impressed with this brew from lost abbey, would definitely enjoy this one again."
"Rich, smoky, sweet chocolaty aroma absolutely sent me into raptures. Appearance is fantabulous, too - opaque sable one scratch above black, with a thick, fluffy, fine-bubbled tan head. Flavor - oh, what flavor! Praise Bacchus that this beer is finally available in Georgia! However I pay for my sins in my mortal life, let it be in the realm of Bacchus, pouring beer for the blessed! Flavor is like a top-of-the-line mocha, coffee and sweet chocolate with smoky tones and a hint of molasses - seriously lip-smacking and utterly divine! Texture is silky smooth yet fairly tingly, leaving a sweet and fizzy finish. This serpent is sheer perfection! Again, my thanks to Bacchus/Dionysus for bringing this beer to Atlanta!"
"D- Very well balanced, easy to drink sipper."
"D: definitely was a sipper but was really tasty and is one of my favorites from the year round offerings LA has."
"I like this one."
"Drinks very very well, all factors considered. If it were cheaper, it could be a go-to for me."
"Damn this is some tasty stuff. Damn."
"Great beer from The Lost Abbey, would like to get another bottle and cellar it for a year."
"Overall, the most impressive Lost Abbey offering by far...better than Angel's Share. Every stout lover should give this brew a shot!"
"On tap at Midway in East Atlanta Village (8oz served in tulip). Dark as a moonless night black with small caramel colored head. Smells absolutely delicious- roasted maltiness, dark chocolate, and a hint of rum in the nose. Full taste of roasted malts, some nuttiness with a strong dark chocolate presence and hint of espresso. Medium bodied with chewy, nougat-like texture. Overall, a very delicious roasty, dark chocolate tasting beer- perfect with dessert, or even a dessert all by itself. Wonderful beer that I would love to get my hands on again. As far as imperial stouts go this one is in my top three- highly recommended!"
"Drinkability: A really good beer with great smells and flavors, but a definite boozines and a high ABV certainly puts some limits on this one. A must-sip kind of beer, but one that should be tried by any stout fans."
"Pours near black without any head other than a few bubbles forming a collar around the edges. No lacing to stick. Not a good sign in the carbonation department. The nose is slightly roasty with a good amount of chocolate. Hints of coffee as well. The flavor is pretty good with some roast and chocolate and a bit of sweetness in the background. Mouthfeel is medium without any carbonation to hold anything up. Drinkability is pretty good, even with the low carbonation."
"With barely a pop from the cork (Lost Abbey lives up to the rumors again) the beer flows forth into the glass looking very demonic indeed. Luckily this beer isnt flat, I suspect its just naturally very lowly carbonated. It supports a small dark brown head that fades quickly. The aroma is dominated by assertive alcohol. Plenty of chocolate comes out to give this a nice decadence. There is a woodsy, almost musty yeast aroma. If I am correct, I believe this beer uses Brett in some quantity. The more detailed you get into investigating the aroma you will find lots of chocolate covered raisins and figs with a dash of licorice. The taste is right in line with the aroma. It does, however, bring more sweet chocolate covered fruits than the bouquet does. That is a good thing for someone like me. The sweetness approaches the realm of a dessert beer but is never over the top. Alcohol is no slouch but its managed buy licorice, espresso roast, figgy fruit, and worn leather. A distinct yeasty set of flavors bring on flavors of old wood. Carbonation is much higher on the palate than you would expect. This hurts the overall feel of the body, disguising it as less full than it may really be."
"D- right up my alley for imperial stouts. Keep 'em coming!"
"Beer is medium bodied and like syrup up front but in a good way, the back fo the palate is a little dry with only minimal bitterness. This beer leads with it's front palate flavors and falls off quickly after that. It's a decent enough beer, I wonder if the low carbonation levels in it are indicative of a problem or by design, I thought only their barrel aged beers had carbonation problems. Overall it is a decent Impy stout but I'd be slow to buy it again (or trade for it as this was the case)."
"Nice, but not much that sets this apart from other similar beers."
"Very easy to drink especially considering the 11% abv. Great gourmet chocolate flavors that I didn't consider quite sinful... until it warmed a bit more and added some plum/prune notes. It certainly wasn't mindbending like ""Inception"" (my paired movie of choice) but I do think it was slightly more enjoyable. Perhaps it should have been paired with something more robust and intellectual."
"It's a surprisingly well-balanced brew that goes down on quite friendly terms with my digestive system."
"D: Crazy drinkable for a stout of this size. The tastes are wonderful, and the alcohol is nicely masked. I really wish this was more readily available in Western PA."
"D--This is a another heavy hitter, A love the way this beer transitions as it warms, getting some cherry in the end. This is a very solid beer. It sucks that LA ownership is weak, because when their beer is carbonated, and they are not busy being fools, they make excellent beers such as this one..."
"A very nice beer this one, and one that is incredibly robust and flavoursome. Doesn't have the fantastic balance and complexity I've had from some others, but it's still an excellent beer."
"Poured on-tap at the Port/Lost Abbey Brewery. The beer is jet-black, with a light brown, two-inch head. There are notes of malt and coffee on the nose, giving the smell a very well balanced aroma. The flavors are VERY round and robust. Full tastes of heavy malt, with sweet caramel and molasses highlights. The beer is more on the dry side, without any of the creamy or thick characteristics of other stouts, but not quite a dry stout, either. The beer has aftertastes of nut and spice (red pepper and coriander??), with a slightly sour finish. Decent beer."
"Taste is grain sweetness, roasted barley, coffee, bitter, dark chocolate. Finishes dark chocolate, with a very long lingering sweetness that you can feel on your teeth. Medium to full bodied with a great level of carbonation. Alcohol is masterfully masked. Overall a solid stout that sets the bar for what an Imperial Stout should be."
"m/d-Incredibly smooth and easy to drink. medium bodied and not to thick for the beer it is. I could drink this all day. Leaves a touch of a bitter taste as if you had taken in a small spoonful of cocoa powder. Refreshing for such a powerful style. This is a fantastic beer and I hope to have it again soon."
"D- Fairly high. Very enjoyable. Wow, I'm impressed. I raaarely buy Lost Abbey, and usually it's 'well, I like it but it's too expensive'. Not this one. One I've slept on.. going to have to buy a bottle or two of this next time I go to the store."
"Body is smooth and velvety, way too big to be creamy but maybe something like viscous. Finishes slightly sticky but almost miraculously smooth. I'm ready for another drink as we speak. The Lost Abbey does the damn thing and does it damn well. Pick this, and their entire lineup, off the shelf and enjoy."
"Cheers!"
"The only way I can refuse the serpent's siren song is to focus on the mouthfeel. It's acceptable but is syrupy and thick, knocking this down a bit and bringing me back to my senses. The carbonation that is there begins to dissipate and this becomes a sticky black concoction that only the purest of men can resist. This isn't the most drinkable beer, as the booze certainly emerges more as this warms. A beer full of evil and good, much like the battle in the garden it gets its name from. As the last sip slithers down my throat, I'm convinced that the snake knows the way to paradise."
"D - Wow, this 11% is very nicely hidden behind those dark flavours but is still present on the back. This is a very enjoyable imperial stout!"
"This beer pours a blackness with 2 fingers of thick tan foam. The main aromas are bourbon, chocolate, smoke, char and oak, none of them are particularly strong. The taste mostly consists of the chocolate and the bourbon, but this doesn't work in too bad of a manor with the consistency of the beer. It feels really nice on nitro but perhaps a bit muddled. This is a rather nice drinking beer and I would have no problem having some on hand all night, if it weren't for the fact that it wouldn't take long for me to get hammered."
"D: My portion disappeared a lot faster than guwilliums'!"
"Linger: 3"
"I enjoyed this stout as it warmed up to room temperature. the notes of alcohol were too strong when this was poured right out of the fridge since it is 11% the alcohol dulled when it warmed up even though I could still taste it. This is as black as you can get which is expected for a stout. Not much head but the retention was very high when I swirled it in my glass. I'm not sure if I would recommend this but it was good to try for a first time."
"D - This is so easy-drinking, especially for the style, the complexity, and the ABV."
"Not considering price for a moment, If I'm to measure this against American Double Stouts, Green Flash Double - also from california - just absolutely demolishes this. If I'm to measure this against Russian Imperial Stouts, North Coast Old Rasputen - also from california - just absolutely demolishes this. Now taking into consideration that each is roughly half the price per ounce that this is ..."
"Mouthfeel is thick and viscous but the slight bitterness up front takes away from the overall smoothness of the beer. Enjoyable and drinkable on a cold evening, I can see myself having another one at some point."
"D: Not sure how I feel about this one. I want to like it, but compared to other great stouts out there, this one seems a little unpolished. It's not bad, it's just not that outstanding or overall that pleasant to drink."
"thanks hoser for opening this one it was great introduction to this brewery"
"D: Great Straight Double Stout without any help from barrel aging, additive ingredients, etc. Impressive."
" The stout is a tasty blend of coffee notes w/ gentle charred edge and slight dried fruit accenting w/ mild cocoa and caramel blend. The flavor has complimentary woody hop flavor w/ a slight alcohol and pepper taste which gets earthy and mildly vegetal in a small degree. I enjoy the dry toasted flavor and slight malted chocolate ball that is left resonating. A beer designed to sip, not quaff as the 11%abv should warn, and I can't give it more than a 4 in the drinkability honestly, but it is a worthy stout w/ lots of flavor which equates to drinkable in every other sense except abv!"
"M/D: Full bodied, carbonation is high. Drinkability is pretty good, a very balanced, flavorful stout."
"D: ok, but would greatly improve with age. Needs the alcohol to be more hidden."
"I poured from a 750 ml bottle into a snifter. The pour is jet black with a thin tan head, nice lacing. The aroma is chocolatey, with generous amounts of esspresso and the slightest hint of booze. It taste nearly as good as it smells. Lots of rich chocolate malt and it finishes with a pleasant bit of alcohol. The beer is full bodied and a great sipper. A very good stout."
"Drinkability: This is one of those beers that is drinkable as a special treat. With this complexity and ABV its good for one a night of quiet sipping and enjoyment. I certainly will enjoy having this one again."
"Serving type: bottle"
"tastes... well... not saying it is bad. it is very heavy on the roasted flavors are heavy, but seems like they are hoping that will do it for them. a combination of the rarity and the heavy roasted flovors... seems like they are banking on that, and ignorant people to put it into the MUST have category. it is good, it is not GREAT... after all this time, I was let down. try it once, but only once."
"D- ABV of 11% was totally unapparent to me, and was simply buried beneath mountains of malt and chocolate structure. Only the massive weight posed any limitation to the drinkability, with all other characteristics lending to an all-to-easy rate of libation."
"D - Really drinkable at 11%. I'd have this many more times if it were available to me."
"Serpent's Stout is a contender for my favorite Lost Abbey beer (the other being Gift of the Magi). I poured this 750ml bottle out into a pint glass (the only glass available to me at the time), and it poured a deep black, with a little head that, as others have said dissipated fairly quickly leaving a little lacing. The beer itself feels great in your mouth, definitely one to let roll over your tongue and breathe in. The beer is rather viscous, almost syrupy, and very decadent and sweet. Strong notes of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and raisins. Serpent's Stout becomes truly exceptional when you factor in how drinkable it is, as normally something this syrupy and sweet is hard to put down, especially with as much alcohol as is present (11%ABV), but I had this 750ml all to myself and would have been happy to have another."
"A very delicious bottle-conditioned stout, impressive and drinkable for 11 percent. The more it warms up the better it gets. Malt flavors are really in sync with each other. A must try in our book because it stands out from the rest of the Lost Abbey lineup as being one of their best."
"Overall, starts off promising, but it's just too hot, charred and unbalanced for me to truly like. I remember this beer being a lot more decadently sweet, and liking it a lot more that way."
"2008 bottle, pours a thick black with heavy bubbles rising into a large, creamy head. Nose is low on roasted malts and char, but is quite fruity, focusing on a lot of red berries and cherries. Sweet and a bit chalky. Vibrant and expressive flavors, brings up more roasted elements than the nose, but still plenty sweet with a lot of those cherries. Reminds me of what Churchill's Finest Hour tried to be. This is actually quite good and is probably one of the best beer of this weight from Lost Abbey that I've had."
"Very good. I would buy this one again"
"A: Little to no pop of the cork, the head is quite thin though it has some serious retention and consists of the tightly packed espresso-like bubbles, there are a few signs of very minor lacing, extremely dark in color with only a hint of deep amber evident at the edges of the glass, based on a swirl of the glass there seems to be some serious viscosity to the Serpent's Stout - 4.00, S: The initial smell yields a thick molasses like sweetness as well as quite a bit of espresso and dark chocolate, the faintest hint of grass is present in the depths of the beer and also a little bit of powdered cocoa - 4.00, T: Thick and sweet on the palate with a bit of charring on the tail to keep it from being overly-sweet, there are some strong raisin and tootsie roll flavors, lots of double fudge brownies and a hint of citrus that bites at the end of the beer, alcohol is present but just manages to skirt a harsh burn, all around a very nice double stout - 4.50, M: Thick and creamy mouth feel, almost velvety and with a heavy body - 4.50, D: A very enjoyable and dangerously drinkable 11% beer, the sweetness has the potential to deplete the palate but so far that has not been a problem, unquestionable worth a try - 4.00"
"Syrupy and roasty, but not cloying or astringent. This is a strong stout of exceptional balance. It tastes like biting into a dark chocolate bar, with hints of currant and plums. It smells like alcohol and chocolate. Hops are unnoticeable until right when you need them in the finish when they scrub your palate clean. Carbonation is low, but this might be the best way to enjoy the tremendous flavors."
"This will be hard to drink - I think it lacks the typical Lost Abbey complexity that I was expecting. Plus, you feel the big alcohol immediately. Definitely not my favorite Lost Abbey beer....afraid I'm going to have to be on the left side of the bell curve here. Wow, you know what, I really do not like this beer."
"Drinkability> yes, please"
" Cheers..."
"Pours pitch black into tulip with a light tan head of about 1 inch that shrinks into lacing just around the perimeter of the top of the beer. Not bad. I immediately smell the fruity esters from the yeast during the pour. Further investigation into the smell reveals lots of coffee and licorice notes, not much sweetness detected here. A faint hint of alcohol is also detected. This is one of the nicest smells I have noticed on an imperial stout. The taste is full of bitter roasting and coffee flavors; right up my alley. The belgian yeast works nicely to smooth out the harsh roasted flavors. There is a noticeable alcohol burn that I am okay with, but keeps it from being outstanding. This is a big stout that isn't too thick. Recommended."
"Thanks to my brother Andy for cracking this one. Pours black into a tulip with about an inch of tan head. Nice lacing on this with some dark spots atop the tin layer of head. Really nice nose on this. A big whiff of Belgian yeast, revealing dark fruits and a faint hint of very bitter cocoa. After a few nose dives in this one I've become a bit used to the yeast smell and richer chocolate notes are revealed as well as a faint alcohol aroma. The taste has a big espresso flavor. A very bitter finish. This has a syrupy richness to it with a nice malt balance. The bitter finish balances the richness of this beer nicely. A bit more carbonated than what would fit my preference, but this drinks like a nice sipper."
"D: This was a fantastic stout with a delicious scent and taste. It had good body too, and the alcohol wasn't bad, so it was fairly easy to drink while also being enjoyable to sip. The taste wasn't terribly complex, but it was far from simple. It was very sweet, but also balanced. This beer will probably continue to improve with age for quite a while, but I'm already really impressed with it."
"D: Wow. This is one hell of a beer. A little too much burn (alcohol) and bite (hops) for me, but this is minor quibble. A tremendous brew...seek it out. Share it with friends after dinner or with a chocolately dessert."
"Taste, however, is quite good. Big roasted malts, bitter chocolate, a bit of booze, some fruitiness that reminds me of smoked apples. Delicious and complex, this is a big-time stout. Creamy and smooth, but it might be able to use a bit more body. I sipped it for a while, but I loved the way it continued to change as the pint drained. Worth it."
"I'm looking forward to an exciting, probably tumultuous, and definitely wallet-depleting relationship with Lost Abbey in the future. I have a feeling I peaked right at the outset with this quality brew. Highly recommended."
"After a long time o' gapin' at this guy on the shelf, I'm finally gettin' to taste it. Right on. It pours an opaque black that looks like something that washed up on the Gulf Coast (ah, topical humor...slightly better than topical cream...). Hardly any head in formed, though a small colony of brown bubbles attempts a settlement, only to end up like Roanoke. The nose comprises heavily roasted malts, chocolate syrup, molasses, and a heapin' helpin' o' grain alcohol. The taste follows closely, adding force to the chocolate (making it closer to chocolate syrup) and a fairly strong vein of bitterness. The alcohol now expresses itself as a steady burn, just not too hot o' one. The body is thick and heavy, with very little carbonation and a smooth yet chewy feel. If it weren't for a couple key issues, this would be a ridiculous stout; instead, it's just pretty dern good. I kinda want another one..."
"D: Heavy and intense and very complicated. Alcohol is definitely present. Intriguing stout. Every sip unmasks new characteristics (especially as it warms), but far from sessionable. Sips like a fine scotch."
"Appearance is obsidian black. Not a ray of light is getting through this beer. Carbonation is very minimal. This beer has a very toasty smell. Smells of lightly burnt chestnuts and chocolates. Tastes absolutely delicious! Very nice chocolatey/sweet malt taste to it. A little bit of coffee notes. Hops are present, but barely noticeable. Not nearly as hot as I thought this 11% stout would be. Very thick and full bodied, with a tasty chocolatey finish. A great dark beer to sip on!"
"D: Overall a solid Imperial Stout, but the alcohol is just a little overwhelming right now. I'm sure with a couple years this will taste even better, but since this is kind of Lost Abbey's ""widely available"" IS, I wish it was a little more drinkable fresh."
"Although delicious and one of the best MFs for the style, this brew is way too rich, stong and thick to drink more than 750 of. Those 750 mls are well worth it though. recommended, highly!"
"D - hot alcohol linger makes this a slow drinking beer."
"D: The robustness of Lost Abbey brews really sets them apart, but at times hinders the beers as well. The Serpent's Stout is a prime example. All the ingredients here are fresh, well proportioned and really near perfect, but the brew is just so strong as to render it somewhat of a chore to drink. But it's so good, I'll give it another chance to see if this beer will deviate over different batches."
"D- for 11 abv and as much flavor as this one has I've been able to enjoy a few without much problem. Not an every day beer but once in awhile ill kill a few."
"D - One is enough :)"
"Pours a deep, dark, opaque black, topped off with a good two fingers of mocha foam. Huge inviting aromas of black licorice, molasses, bitter coffee and roasted malt. Deep, rich roasty flavors, mainly dark chocolate, freshly brewed espresso, dark roasted malt and just a hint of spicy hops. Nice warming finish from the 11% alcohol. An outstanding imperial stout."
"Opaque dark liquid with a medium head. Dark sweet and roasted malt with chocolate, fruit. Flavor is dark sweet chocolate with oak and vanilla character. Thick mouthfeel and low carbonation. An excellent imperial that was enjoyed at the 4th Anniversary party."
"Pours a rich, dark, near black, small brown ring of head leaves a little lacing. Smell is of strong melted baking chocolate, medium roast coffee, cream, a touch of sweetness with hints of earth. Taste is a wonderful assertive blend of the scent ingredients, rich and dark. Full bodied yet silky smooth and creamy, excellent on the palate. A great stout that combines great flavor and perfect body."
"Sure enough, magic marker dominates the taste. Then alcohol, then burnt chocolate. This is not good. It's worse than ""not impressed"" and I couldn't finish it. I'm hoping this is a bad batch, but it is still the beer I was drinking. Something went wrong here."
"Not bad, but I had to push to get through it. I'll pass on seconds."
"I enjoyed this beer. It's got a lot of flavor and a nice feel going down."
"D - the high alcohol rating on a 750ml bottle makes this a one bottle brew."
"This one has been in the cellar for about 2 years give or take. A 750ml bottle uncorked and poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The stout appears a dark dark brown color with a good two fingers of ecru foam. Nice head retention with minimal lacing. Nose and flavors consist of dark brown sugar, sweet and sour cherries, blackberries, dark and semi sweet chocolate, molasses, dark roasted grain, caramelized malts, some coffee, plums. Quite complex in the nose and taste. The stout is approaching full bodied with a bit more lively carbonation that I like in my Impy stouts, but still nothing to deter me from seeking this one out again."
"The beer pours dark brown to black with a tan head. The aroma is brown sugar with roasted malt, smoke, dark chocolate and coffee. The flavor is chocolate, oak, vanilla, coffee and roasted malt. The alcohol is very well hidden. Medium-thick mouthfeel and low carbonation. Another very good beer from Lost Abbey/Port Brewing."
"Drinkability: I really like the complex multiple layers of chocolate going on here. I do want this again. This is worth the price and is a really good beer."
"D: Very nice imperial stout. It may not have some of the complexity of a barrel aged or some of the other stouts out there, but this is a solid contended in the straight up imperial stout category."
"This beer is dangerously easy drinking and I wish I had another bottle as I thoroughly enjoyed this hearty treat."
"Overall - An outstanding brew and up with the best of the Americans impy stouts..."
"F: Very bitter again, combination of earthy hops and scorched malts. Lots of roast and coffee lingering, very dry as well with a little biscuity malt flavor and touch of sticky sweet syrup."
"Flavor is awesome!! Full of chocolate and malts. A small amount of hops compliments the sweet attributes of this beer. Creamy, smooth...medium to full body, chewy, viscous, medium carbonation...a great drinker! Another awesome beer from Lost Abbey!"
"D - Very enjoyable stout with a pronounced hop bitterness and pleasant chocolate flavor. This one is quite different from all of the other Lost Abbey beers I've had to date."
"The mouthfeel, is, as previously stated, flat, and it's a little thinner than expected. Drinkability is okay, but it's an 11% stout that isn't all that great, so that certainly limits it here."
"d - I thought this beer looked great and smelled amazing, but thought the high carbonation and boozy taste hurt it a lot. My bottle was from 2009 and it was still a bit boozy. I felt like if cellared for a bit longer this one could be amazing. Would recommend holding onto this one for a bit before enjoying."
"Poured a deep, deep brown damn near solid black, good carbonation and a decent brown head. Nose is roasted malts, chocolate, light espresso. Taste is big roasted malts up front with anice chcoloate backing coup-lked some lighter coffee notes, even detected very light vanilla. Mouthfeel was boozy, cocoa, roasted and a boom, in your face taste. Very good and a hell of lot better on draft."
"D: I liked some of the flavors going on in this beer, but it was just way too boozy. This beer can definitely benefit from some aging."
"Overall: It is not that I don't like it, but the beer is way too alcoholic for the style. The strong presence of the alcohol spoils the others flavors too much. Nice try, but will not drink it again."
"It's an Imperial Stout and 10.5%. This poured a pitch black. This puppy smelled of chocolate, espresso and roasted malts. It tasted like roasted burnt coffee, dark chocolate, a ton of malt and it is extremely dry and bitter- in a good way. You feel the heat from the alcohol but I had no idea it was 10.5 % until I looked it up."
"D: Its good. I was afraid that was going to happen. This is pretty damn well crafted and tasty. It could use a bit more in the nose arena and the ABV could be hidden a bit more, but still it is nice. Its not in that ELITE category of Imperial Stouts but it is close. It was a good deal on tap but the bottles I saw for $13+ were a bit of a turn off. I would have it on draft again, but I can't see myself buying a bottle. Well done."
"Honestly, Tomme Arthur hits every style so damn well, how does he do it? The only potential problem would be the mouthfeel, due to his well-documented low carbonation issues, but this beer is just right. The carbonation is definitely there, but not so much so that it compromises the thick body. Excellent excellent beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium body, slight carbonation, smooth, and easy drinking...especially considering the abv. It's a good stout but nothing puts it above the rest of the other good stouts."
"D - I shared the drink with my wife, who enjoyed it just as much as myself. This beer is a sipper for sure, one serving is enough for me. The intensity, depth and complexity overall is outstanding and balanced well."
"Overall: An incredible example of how to brew with heavy focus on roasted barley balanced out with alcohol spice and warmth. With all the chocolate in the aroma I was really expecting more in the flavor, while it is there it's anything but a sweet stout. Some dark fruit character would be welcome here, and I'd love to see an Oak Aged version, but it's not lacking complexity or body by any stretch. Overall a rich, roasty, full-bodied sipper to enjoy on a quiet evening."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick and creamy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a nice black malt bitterness along with a killer chocolate malt aroma. It's rich and creamy with a bit of warmth. The taste is awesome! Wow, what a great stout! It has a thick and rich chocolate malt flavor with a stiff black malt bitterness and underlying roasted character. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good stout. I'm a big fan of the chocolate flavor; man, what a drinker."
"Certainly awesome.. super dark pour with dark brown head.. very chocolatey aroma with some dried fruit, very sweet.. flavor is very robust, lots dark fruit, cocoa, some alcohol. Mouth is fairly perfect for a strong stout, very viscous and chewy thick. All around very awesome.. I'm very impressed as I tend to like strong stouts much better when they have espresso but this was just an awesome straight up RIS.."
"Serpent's Stout is unquestionably good beer. I've had this bottle for almost two years and I question whether I shouldn't have cracked it sooner. Probably so. I like it, but it seems like it's missing a little something. I suspect that something might be a little hops. The further I get into the bottle, the more I'm convinced that it had more of a hop presence in its youth. I need to try a fresh bottle. The only thing it overtly needs today is more body. Other than that, I like it quite a bit. Easily recommended."
"An outstanding Imperial Stout from The Lost Abbey, Serpent's steered me into The Pig this afternoon for a sample. So glad I did, for this is just what terrific Imperial Stout ought to be--rich in flavor, and very smooth."
"On tap during ""Stout Month"" at the Vine Street Pub. Poured a dark brown almost black with a yellowish-tan head of about a half finger. Alcohol noticeable with some coffee malts and dark fruit. Fruity complex taste with the malts contributing significant flavors of coffee and chocolate. Smooth feel with great tight carbonation and a full bodied feel. Interesting flavors, complex, with drinkability on par with other Imperial Stouts."
"This beer was another home run. The flavors were bold and in your face. I would not recommend this beer to a novice mainly due to cost and the fact that a person who might not be that in tune might miss some of the subtle complex flavors that make this beer memorable from other imperial stouts. As for all you roasty lovin', coffee sippin', chocolate eatin', craft beer drinkers out there: seek this beer out I promise you that you will not be disappointed."
"D: This beer is 11% ?!? Where did it go? Yeah, I'll be seeking this one out again. This beer is just a slight notch below the well-known world class imperial stouts. Nonetheless, I'd be glad to have this anytime."
"I'm thoroughly pleased. I bought it, poured it, and they delivered, as always."
"Pours black with a beige head that retains fairly well and leaves bits of lacing on the glass. Smell is of malted milk balls, earthy hops, light roast and plenty of booze. Taste of light caramel, a touch of coffee, earthy, grassy hops, malted milk balls and fusels. Medium body and higher than medium carbonation. Had this beer a few times and I fail to understand the extremely high ratings. They make other beers I enjoy quite a bit, but this isn't one."
"D: While the alcohol was not readily apparent, this one got a little tiresome by the end of the bottle. Not hard to drink, just increadibly filling."
"I am still trying to figure out if this is supposed to be a ""Belgian Big Stout""... If not, I would like to see this brewed with a slightly fruity Belgian yeast while keeping the mouthfeel and carbonation. Could be out of this world."
"Drinkability: It gets much more drinkable as it warms. The fudge element of this beer is remarkable. If you get one sit on it for a year."
"D: Talk about under-rated. For all the -bal this and limited-release that... this is one fantastically solid beer that is actually relatively available. Flavor is completely off the charts and so ridiculously balanced... with a mouthfeel that ties things together perfectly. Find this beer and have it... cause it'll be better than most of the limited stuff you'd have to wait much longer for."
"D = Lack of complexity in the taste and the alcohol heat hurt the drinkability. Couldn't finish the 750-ml myself, which is unusual."
"A wonderful beer from Tomme and Lost Abbey."
"Notes: It's a beast in a bottle or maybe it's plain pure evil and that's allright with me. Truly a remarkable stout. Cheers."
"Overall this has become a new favorite of mine and certainly one of the most complex Imperial Stouts that I have tried. My Highest Recommendation."
"Almost two years in the cellar hasn't hurt this one any. If I can get ahold of another, I think I will hold on to it a while too."
"D-extremely solid imperial stout, one of my absolute favorites!"
"This is a unique stout. I pick up an almost cocoa something like suntan oil sweetness from this stout.I like the fact that it steps outside the norm of all others with the flavors not being to overwhelming to any one area. Nice balance with roasted malts and seems like there is some added sugar here as well. All in all a great offering..."
"Overall a substantial stout. Flavor is rich and enticing. Alcohol heat brings a pleasant sting to the finish. This is a big beer that is still very drinkable."
"What a powerful stout, drinks much bigger than it is and reminds me of some of the best."
"Drinkability: Excellent beer. The alcohol does not dominate and the taste and mouthfeel keeps you going back for more. Would definitely recommend and drink again."
"Aromas of dark milk chocolate, malted milkballs, vanilla, and cocoa powder. Complex, with a great interplay between the various aromas. Thick and choclately on the palate, turning to bourbon-y oak before finishing earthy and dry. Delicious; this short review doesn't do the beer justice."
"This is a very drinkable stout, almost to my detriment with 10.5% alcohol. The taste starts smooth with a nice cofee finish. Very good stout. This like a sessional stout."
"As for the taste, the alcohol is hidden remarkably well. Chocolate and coffee showing up here as wellas toasted malts. Very light carbonation. After thoroughly enjoying the subtle comlexity of Lost Abbel's 10 Commanments I was hoping for something more complex. Overall pretty disappointing, I'd rather be drinking an Old Rasputin."
"Overall impression: Enjoyable fireside sipper."
"Pours out an incredibly dark color, no light passing through right from the start. And a nice dense brown head forms on top. It leaves a little lacing, but with the drinking speed I had with this, the head didn't have a chance of making it to the finish. Very nice looking though. The smell is mostly raisins, burnt bread, a little roasted malt, some chocolate, with a hint of booze. Smells good. The taste is really interesting. Comes out very sticky, raisins, overripe plums, dark and sweet, but dried out a bit through fermentation. There's nutty grainy bread, and maybe a taste of earthiness. It's very dense, but the booze is immediately present. Very slow drinking. Actually, the carbonation was nice and light at the start, but by the end, there was nothing, just beer and the burn of some alcohol. Very strong in the flavor department, which makes it nice, but any small glaring weakness is intensified by the alcohol, and the intensity of flavors may overwhelm at points. But overall, a very good beer. I just have to say that to call this drinkable, would be a lie, a huge lie, this took me something like 3 or 4 hours, but I can't say I didn't enjoy it all throughout."
"Pours dark and thick, with a modest, foamy, tan-and-brown head. Bears the vanilla, coffee, and chocolate scent one would expect. The vanilla seems to be more present here than in other of its Stout peers. Tastes of rich cocoa and coffee. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, not too heavy. Highly drinkable, with its high alcohol held nicely in check. Another of the outstanding Stouts."
"Overall I think this is a really underrated stout, I would love to try the Port version of it."
"D - Not bad. That lingering alcohol really fouls up a good beer. Reminds me to hold my bottle for a while."
"Drinkability: The boozy quality isn't enjoyable for me and the carbonation is a bit off but the creamy heaviness of this brew is really enjoyable."
"M&D - rich malts make this a thick brew that is still smooth and easy to drink, it hides the double digit ABV pretty well, one of the better stouts i have had in a while. Lost Abbey continues to impress. as if i needed more motivation to move to Cali"
"Very, very solid effort from Lost Abbey. I wonder what would happen if this were thrown into oak barrels for a while. Worth seeking out, regardless."
"75cl bottle thanks to bret27. An unexpected and pleasant surprise at our last tasting. Bret walked two miles through La Selva/Seascape hills to bring this bad boy, and the effort was worth it. The beer poured out of the bottle with a pitch-black hue and had a nice tan head that left lasting foam. The aroma had some sweet coffee and fruity yeast notes. The flavor was on the fruity side with lower bitterness and lots of dark chocolate. It was more sweet up front but faded into a darker chocolate finish. Full bodied and smooth with carbonation at a medium-low level. A nicely balanced and mellow stout with a good flavor combination of fruitiness and dark chocolate."
"DAn amazingly drinkable 10+% brew. This may be my most favorite regular LA offering. Tough to put down my glass!"
"- Fantastic Imperial stout... one of the best... smooth, hid itself well, and left me feeling fine! Whart more could one ask for! Tasty!"
"D: Drinks a bit easier from the higher carbonation but still a big beer."
"D: Great for the alcohol content, but nothing I'm trying to drink really fast."
"Overall an excellent stout. Lots of coffee and chocolate flavors but not too overpowering. The % alcohol of this beer is hidden really well and it tastes awesome for such a strong beer. Will definitely buy again. Give it a try, and if you live near SoCal, visit the brewery on a Fri or Sat."
"Very roasted full body with a lot of dark chocolate maltiness, spicy pepper and anise, coffee, toffee, oatmeal, caramel malt and a nice bitter hop finish. Heavily carbonated up front with a very roasty dark maltiness, followed by a sweet caramel and chocolate body with a very bitter dry hoppy finish. Recommended."
"Overall: Very unique Imperial Stout, delicious beer, however you have to be in the mood for a beer like this one. Best enjoyed in the winter seasons (or fall when it gets cold) in my opinion."
"The Serpents Stout is the true definition of a treat."
"D: I think I was expecting more from this. Still a good beer, though. It's well composed, but it could use a bigger spectrum or aromas and flavors."
"Shazam! One fine beer. Rich. Got this bottle at Sam's in Chicago a few months ago. Poured with a nice tan head and some lace. Color is an opaque brown almost black.... hell, maybe it is black. Splitting pubic hairs. Aroma is divine: chocolate, yeast, burnt malt, toffee, and a hint of fruit. Flavor is all a that and more. Add a touch of black walnut and french roast coffee. Finsih is surprisingly mild and easy. Body is great with fine carbonation. Killer beer."
"D: Very drinkable now, but I think some aging could have taken some hotness off this. I'll have to pick up another one to age, although the price tag is quite high."
"OVERALL: Very drinkable and very enjoyable, despite the higher ABV. This is one I could sip on for quite a while. Well done Lost Abbey."
"Overall great selection."
"Highly recommended."
"D. A delicious brew. Couldn't drink too many, but I thoroughly enjoyed my one... put a nice dent in the wallet too."
"Pours black with a creamy dark tan head that settles to a ring as it sticks around. Heady smelling, with chocolate, espresso, prunes and licorice. Tastes slightly hot, but with nicely developed flavors. Lots of licorice after the alcohol burn, as well as some dark fruitiness that develops slowly and finally some espresso and chocolate flavors on the finish. The alcohol heat makes this a little tough to drink, but that should mellow over time. Very nice overall."
"Conclusion: This is a deceivingly drinkable, burnt, roasty stout...I like the dark fruit here as well and just the hint of barnyard...this is quite nicely done and one I'll definitely try to return to."
"Lighter body with a good amount of carbonation. Some of the alcohol still shows through, though not overwhelming. Good chocolate finish, without being overly sweet. Very nice."
"Just a total chocolate bomb. Layers and layers of chocolate flavors, fudge,cake, icing, fudge, cocoa, bakers chocolate then some caramel, black fruit and hints of bittering hops. Some alcohol on the finish. Very nice."
"Blipped ""Black Snake"" by John Lee Hooker"
"Overall another solid Lost Abby offering I'm sure I'll revisit at some point soon when the mood strikes."
"Review #1000! 750mL corked and caged bottle into a Duvel snifter pours an opaque black with a thin tan head that diminishes to an island of foam and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice amount of fresh ground coffee, cocoa and roasted malts. The taste is an absolutely wonderful smooth blend of powdered cocoa, fresh ground coffee and roasted malts, very complex, smooth and quite easy drinking, especially for a hot summer night. The beer is medium bodied with the stated 11.0% ABV VERY well hidden, the beer is also quite nicely carbonated, especially given Lost Abbey's recent reputation. This is a truly spectacular beer, certainly one worthy of a milestone review!"
"Bottle courtesy bret27. Pours pitch black with a very dark tan head. Aroma is perfumey dark chocolate, a little booziness, some roastiness, brownies, light coffee. Flavor is cocoa powdery with bitter chocolate and a ton of roast in the finish. Booze makes a spicy but not overbearing appearance. Rather dry with some astringency. Another good Lost Abbey beer."
"This is another one that Davey brought back from Portland for me. This is the only thing I have had from Lost Abbey at this point. Poured 750ml bottle into snifter. Poured a chalky looking darkbrown/black color, creamy tan head. Smells nutty, spicy, little coffee, bitter chocolate. Taste a little boozy, It taste stronger than 10.5 to me but we did drink it pretty fresh. Mouth was creamy but still a little fizzy in there. This was good but there are so many better Impy Stouts out there."
"Because of how heavy it is and the unusual aroma and flavors within, I find this to be a bit of a chore to drink."
"Overall, I can't imagine how smooth and complex the flavors would be when this beer gets some age on it. This beer was definitely a bit too young for my liking. One of those beers that I will have to revisit."
"For a sinful beer this was awfully heavenly. Sure it's decadently gratifying and, given the alcohol content and bottle size, gluttonously indulgent, but name me one stout lover who could resist the potency of this bouquet, the rich and bittersweet flavours and the cold, black stare of this magnificent beer! If sensual pleasure and slow, lasting enjoyment is wrong, then I don't want to be right. Huge thanks to MasterSki for answering a prayer!"
"A unique Imperial Stout. I have yet to taste a Lost Abbey brew I didn't think was well made and significantly above average. Definitely worth trying, and i'd love to try it aged a year. Possible my 3rd favorite Imp Stout behind Abyss and Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #5."
"Drinkability= Abv. is not detected, flavor is good, mouthfeel is thick. I would probably not drink more than one, but it is excellent and the bottle didn't last long."
"No date on the bottle so I don't know the vintage, I've had this for about a year. Pours a solid black with a fluffy almost tan head that persists for a while. I got a huge whiff of dark fruits as I popped the cork on this one. Deeper into my nose flows the licorice and sweet chocolates along with some dark fruits and a touch of alcohol. Taste is vinous, followed by some chocolates and some alcohol and roast in the finish. The carbonation is kind of high, Body is medium, mouthfeel is bubbly/oily. The high carbonation messes with the mouthfeel to much, but overall a solid stout."
"Nothing amazing here. Just a solid stout that I'd drink again."
"This is a boozy one, for sure, and took a long time to go through (as expected for the high abv). Sweet to start, has a bitter finish. Not too crazy about the slight sour (in a milk/lactose) way here. An Imp. Stout that's a bit different/unique. A pleasant, slow sipper, overall."
"D: An easy drinking sipper (?)"
"I've had several of the Port beers, but this is my first LA one. It pours a deep dark dark brown with minimal head, and I practically dumped it into the glass. Smells moderately of coffee and licorice. Tastes of coffee (mostly) with a decent dose of licorice. Maybe a slight hint of chocolate, but not much--the coffee and licorice dominate. It's a nice blend of flavors, not RIS-style, but moderate but not overwhelming. Carbonation is a bit low, but this is drinkable as stouts go."
"This is heavy, but my pint disappeared quickly. Very drinkable for a beer this big."
"Serpents Stout pours with a classic, mocha-colored head that releases a whiff of dates and cherries. The mouth feel is slightly more carbonated than its impy bretheren which lends to an initial chalky sensation that disappears when the flavors kick in. Dark chocolate and espresso flavors initially dominate, but dates, prunes and spice show up to provide a little balance and to keep the alcohol at bay. That balance is thrown off a bit by a slightly acidic finish, but, overall, this is a very solid stout that should pair nicely with aged sharp cheddar or a raisin-based bread pudding."
"taste is thick and creamy, chocolate, strong coffee in the back, licorice, a touch of smoke, and some sour malt, end is dry"
"D- this one was a treat, but too powerful to have another one. glad i decided to pick this one up, and ill try this year again when the next vintage comes out. lost abbey makes some solid beers."
"Good brew but too sweet for my palate."
"D- Easy now! Although it tastes wonderful and rich, this beer is well on its way to knocking me out quick. The obvious presence of alcohol slows me down a bit. Quite the sippy drink and one for the end of the night."
"D: IMO big stouts possess big drinkability. The first Lost Abbey beer I have taken the time to review."
"Lost Abbey has been getting some guff here lately, and while this isn't ""Beer Zero," this is a fine example of an imperial stout and the first beer I have had from them deserving of hype. To hell with the red poppies and angels shares, come on home to this."
"My experience is that beer from The Lost Abbey is anywhere from good to great to world-class. Serpent's Stout isn't at the pinnacle, but it's one of the best offerings from one of the best American craft breweries in business today. Bottom line: sinfully delicious and devilishly drinkable. Thanks Tomme. Long may you brew."
"So yes, this Lost Abbey concoction passes all tests. May it be a harbinger of more good things to come out of San Marcos!"
" A thick, full body, big weight, and smooth as hell. This is a fine, big stout...is it worth the $12.99? sure."
"Drinks pretty easy for the style & ABV. Not much to find fault with here, almost worth it's rating IMO, but not quite in the upper echelon of the style"
"4/5 across the board for me. Definitely a huge stout, but at this price level, I was expecting a bit more complexity. Definitely be patient with this one and wait until it gets to be about 55°F or more as this is where most of the underlying flavors came through."
"D - Roasty and delicious, this is a great, classic beer. I was surprised to hear that this was a double stout with how traditional in flavor this is. Pretty strong on the alcohol, so no really sessionable, but very delicious"
"Pours thick, murky syrupy dark brown, almost black. Perky tan head, prototypical big stout lacing and appearance. Smell is baker's chocolate, a bit of coffee, a lot of roastedness. Again, prototypical big stout smell. Taste is absolutely mellifluent, big emphasis on the semi-sweet chocolate. A bit of coffee in there, but that along with a decent but not huge roasted component serve to underscore the main flavor. Also a bit of vanilla, a bit of anise, and almost like an oak-aged edge to it, which just basically reinforces the depth of flavor. Bit of bourboney-boozey kick, but not in a biting way at all, just get some of that flavor. I really want to give this a 5 for taste, just can't bring myself to do it. Mouthfeel shines, this beer is super creamy, just rolls off the tongue, and the flavor lingers just long enough on the palate for a roasty chocolatey taste without being cloying. It really helps to reinforce everything else going on. Average to low carbonation, sludgey heavy body, both very fitting and appropriate to style / what brewer was going for. Drinkability is superb, it's a huge 10%+ beer that goes down like nobody's business, a super easy drink. This is a fantastic huge stout, and my favorite LA beer to date. No matter the publicity they are getting as of late, this beer is fantastic, not to be missed next time around. I'm sure as hell going to stock up!"
"Hot finish + High ABV + Richness keeps this as a 4.0 for drinkability."
"This is perhaps my favorite beer from LA. A great Imperial that I will continue to buy. I would like to cellar a few to see how it evolves."
"D: Lost Abbey has made some solid-tasting beers, but they absolutely fail on mouthfeel. Both bottles of Serpents Stout that I bought were flat. Given how overrepresented this style is on BA, Serpents Stout is pretty much at the bottom of the pile. I'll get something else (or several somethings else) for this kind of money."
"I paid $11.99 for this bottle. It really was a treat. I'd gladly pay that to savor this one again."
"Overall this was a very solid IS in which everything was done very nicely. Certainly worth a shot if you come across it."
"Perfect full, smooth body. I could drink this all day. Right there with Black Butte XX and Devil Over a Barrel for beers that have managed to incorporate some barrel aging into a strong dark beer that doesn't wholly remove the roasty edge but still maintains a smooth, rich, filling, complex experience. That is to say: a favorite of the style. Whatever that is."
"This beer definitely delivers and, like most Lost Abbey beers, is definitely worth seeking out. I need to go buy another one soon myself."
"The body is between moderate and full. But this might be because of the slight sour finish. Carbonation is a bit high but ok for style. The astringency is a bit of a turn off. Overall decent but there are some malt and yeast issues here. For my money, Old V is better."
"D - 4 Not as good as last years, but pretty darned close."
"D- A great ""Belgian"" stout in my mind from all the sweet appeal. The drinkability is great for me, but it's all in the eyes of the bedrinker so that may vary. 11% is alot and i'm not all that big so I took my time and boy am I glad, it'll get you drunk!! If you have an extra bottle save it for a year and reep the benefits."
"Had an epic battle to get the cork off. Pours a ""no light can escape"" kind of black. Thin dark tan head dissipates pretty quickly leaving little to no lacing. Sweet chocolately smell lets you know that you're in for a treat. Some coffee mixed in the smell too, but mostly sweet chocolate. The chocolate dominates the front end of the flavor. The coffee comes through much more in the taste. Also some alcohol in the flavor, but not too hot; it blends nicely. You won't confuse this beer for Ten Fidy. Mouthfeel is thinner than a lot of imperial stouts, although not too thin. Carbonation is fine. Drinkability is good, I actually had to slow down a bit to give it a chance to warm up. Overall I highly recommend this brew. Another great effort by Lost Abbey."
"D - certainly an enjoyable brew. I don't think that it's drinkable in a sense that you'd drink this one after another, but very drinkable and enjoyable that one is very satisfying."
"Overall one of the best I've had from Lost Abbey. All the more impressive when I consider they specialize in Belgian styles. This is a big break from their standard lineup."
"As a note, the alcohol starts to warm you up about halfway through, and comes out a bit more as the beer hits room temperature, but never detracts from the flavors or body of the beer. Still an A+ effort."
"I loved this in the bottle, so it was a real treat to be able to try this on draft at the Lost Abbey. I think I remember hearing our server say to someone else that this really hadn't had time to sit in the keg much, hence the lack of a big creamy feel. Still, the flavors were powerful and complex, just the way I like em' in my Imperial Stouts. Good stuff."
"All in all, a good stout. I would definitely have again... just not for $11."
"drinkability: good"
"After having the Espresso Oak Aged Yeti I was very happy to have this Stout. Poured a very dark color with a very minimal head. Smell was not strong but was of Roasted Coffee and Chocolate. The taste was of a medium roasted chocolate not to over bearing. Chocolate as well as some figs came threw later on in the beer. Alc was easily detectable which wasn't a bad thing, I felt like it hit the mood very well for me. Also I was just relived to be drinking this other then the Espresso Oak Aged Yeti that I had the other night. A much needed break! Alc level made the mouth feel a bit of wear and tear, but nothing over the top."
"An even pour into a goblet provided only a thin head to this dark, espresso-esque beer. Roasted malt, chocolate and some coffee in the nose, along with some detectable alchohol. Nothing overbearing in the taste. There is some char and dark chocolate and then some fruity elements... but what I should really be raving about here is the mouthfeel. Huge body with just enough carbonation to provide good drinkability and silky texture. Balance was on this brewer's agenda. Nice stout!"
"D: A very good stout. A bit on the sweet side but definitely something worth seeking out."
"D - Too many charred burnt flavors for my tastes."
"09 750ml, wanted to enjoy this beer but it was a bit rough for me. Alc was high, didn't get the silky rich mouthfell i was expecting. Have an 08 in the cellar, I think this 09 would benefit from 1+ years in the cellar to come together more. Dark stout, nice flavors, smell. Tried cold, and at room temp to see if it would improve. Have more and hope they get better, also may have been an off nite for me. The 08 should help drive my future purchases in more or no more 09."
"D- At 11% this is a hefty brew and it stays true to its ABV. This brew has a very rich character and its a pretty good brew overall. Its an over-the-top Belgian Stout/RIS combo that just doesn't quite have the balance needed to be a great example. That being said-this is a great effort and something that I would try again...I can see why so many people like it."
"Overall a good imperial stout. Interesting with the very mild fruit component that is easy to miss I think. Must be the Belgian influence on the beer?"
"D- Decent offering and taste. Could see myself drinking it again but one is enough."
"ABV is well hidden nonetheless."
"This was even tastier than I was hoping it would be. Really good stuff and glad I was able to pick up a bottle of this."
"Picked up a 750ml bottle from only $6.50 at Abe's Cold Beer. What a deal. I'm not usually a big fan of strong stouts, but I take exception to this beer. The flavors are a great mix of darkly toasted bread crust with semi-dark chocolate. The aroma has similar roasted grains, and black toast. This beer is made more drinkable by the lack of excess residual sugars and that pays off additionally with a dry, cocoa finish that balances an earlier chocolate sweetness. Yum. Give this a try."
"Drinkability: This one's all over the place. On the one hand, the head retention and lacing are stellar, and the tastes and flavor profile truly impressive. On the other hand, the aroma is way too faint and a little strange, and to be honest, I think it's a little overcarbonated. So I'm gonna put drinkability about smack dab in the middle for this one, despite the relatively high abv%. This one's interesting, intense, rich ... I'm gonna give it a ""recommended."""
"It'd be a sin not enjoy this more than once...just not in the same sitting, or you'll never stand up."
"d- outstanding. i like how easily this goes down."
"Mouthfeel is heavy bodied and thick with a small amount of carbonation, keeping it lively."
"Dark brown, near black color with an espresso head. The nose has roasty malts, chocolate, coffee, molases, dark fruits, wood, bourbon and anise. Really opens up at warmer temps. The taste has a nice balance of sweet and bitter flavors. Full body, but the carbonation is a bit off. Still drinks well. Good stuff."
"D- Fairly easy to drink, and gets easier as the beer disappears."
"A fine and unique example of an American Imperial Stout. Will be gladly buying again."
"A wonderful RIS. Not a style that you would think Lost Abbey would be good at but they've nailed it."
"D: A refined, well-balanced RIS. Was a bitch to get the wax off the cork cage but after that, all was good."
"Drinkability - Holy crap, this is awesome. This has held up amazingly well over the past year. This could stand to be aged even longer, but this is delicious. It has been a while since I have had a stout this good. I could drink this all the time."
"D_The light body while a flaw style wise make this fairly easy to drink. Very tasty."
"D: At 10.5%, this is no pounding stout. I'll be lucky to finish the bottle before it knocks me out."
"I've had this beer before, and I don't remember it being this good. Perhaps being fresh improves it, or perhaps they've tweaked the recipe slightly. I'm so glad we're getting the Lost Abbey seasonal brews, as the regular lineup is a little overrated. Highly recommended."
"D: Very drinkable for a beer of 11% ABV. I couldn't find any evidence of the alcohol at all."
"There are some pretty intense and extreme flavors going on here with a high abv. Put your brakes on, this one is to sit back and enjoy slowly. Considering how big and bad it is, I really had no problems cutting through it."
"review taken from notes, poured into my stella artois tulip glass, poured as black as a cave at midnight with a creamey tan thick head rising to the top reduses to a thin film over the entire top as it settels, the taste is the begning a strong oak age flavor, bitter chocalate, strong alchoal and a hint of coffiee. the middle is ware a tuch of of hops kick in but just slightly also a hint of black pepper spicyness. the finish is like creamy mollassess and sweet burbon. this is an overall smoth well blanced great siping stout that i was luckey to get one of. i am seeking to get more of theese"
"EDIT: Just had the 09. Drinking incredibly well, a lot more bitter roasts and a slight soy sauce taste in addition to everything mentioned above. Other then these changes, everything else in the 08 was the exact same in the 09. Huge thanks to Hophead101 for hooking us up with this bottle. Thanks Greg!"
"7/5/8/4/14 (3.8/5)"
"The last time I had this I was a wee bit hung over, so I didn't fully get to enjoy it. Poured in to a Portsmouth Brewery tulip glass. Color is completely black, and has about a half finger of light tan, rocky looking heading. Sweet, rich dark chocolate and earth make themselves known in the nose, as well as some cigar tobacco and dark fruit. Taste is full on with the rich chocolate, which has multiple layers. Sometimes it resembles chocolate powder, other times dark chocolate cake, and even chocolate cheesecake at one point. The dark fruit (raspberries and strawberries come to mind) also sits in the background to complement everything else. Mouthfeel is perhaps a tad light, but still very good. Drinkability suffers for me only because of the higher ABV. I am liking this beer a lot as I sit here listening to Black Sabbath's first record (seemed fitting). Taste wise, it is like a more subtle, refined Surly Darkness. Cannot complain with this beer. Cheers"
"Pours jet black with a dense brown head of tiny bubbles. Roast malt, leather, cigar, bacon, coffee, chocolate and charcoal in the aroma. Huge is not a big enough descriptor for the roasted malt. It hits like a sledgehammer. Smoked bacon, dark chocoalte, cocoa powder, and coffee are also there en masse. Nice alcoholic warmer at the back. Smooth, velvet mouthfeel. I could drink this all night."
"Elegant smooth sweet beer, quite tasty, I enjoyed this."
"8/4/8/4/17/4.1"
"Notes: While the Serpent's Stout is a tasty brew, the off-flavors really hurt the overall score of this beer in my humble opinion. The sweetness tends to be a little unbalanced at times, thus teetering on the edge of tasting like a ""sweet stout"" at a certain point. Maybe something happened to this bottle, I don't know. But I do know that it sure was tasty enough to try again sometime. Nonetheless, a very good stout that I would recommend to others, for sure."
"Cheers to a great brewery!"
"Notes: Like most Lost Abbey beers, this has one GLARING flaw... the mouthfeel."
"Very good beer. Subtler & better as it warms."
"Drinkability is fairly high. It's a decent tasting stout, and the 11% ABV is very well hidden. I really love the chocolate tones most of all. A solid beer."
"D: This is a really nice stout, despite the carbonation being a bit too high. I really like the fruitiness, it's not something I've experienced in many beers of this style. Coffee is toned down as well, which is a plus for me. Obviously this is a beer to be sipped and shared. Big ups for the smell and taste, but I gotta mark it down a bit because it's just not as smooth as I'd like it to be. Still, among the best I've had in the style."
"This is quite a fine beer, another winner from Lost Abbey. I'd bet it would do well with some age, though, to allow some of the astringency and alcohol to mellow a bit. Tons of potential, but still a good beer right now."
"Not a bad beer but it is a bit on the sweet side for the beer type, quite a lot like Kahlúa."
"Pours a very dark brown in color with a nice inch of mocha colored head. Plenty of chocolate or cocoa flavors in the smell. Very creamy and velvety smooth in the mouthfeel. Plenty of cocoa and slight coffee in the flavor. This is lacking just a bit for me. Port/Lost Abbey is my favorite brewery, but I didn't enjoy this as much as I thought I would."
"Wow! Does this beer have some head. A stronh pour gets more than four fingers of chocolate brown head that jumps over the edge of the glass. No lace is left. Body is black as used motor oil. Nose is full of zesty coco and spicey malt notes. Even has a hint of sweet smoke. Enters tha mouth with a bold, very alive flavor profile. Electric coco notes blend with zesty spice, coffee, burnt malts and sun scorched dark fruits. There is a consistant sweet feel to the palate consisting of bakers chocolate, raisens and pie crust. Mouthfeel is of a bitter chocolate feel, very nice. Very thick, even for a stout. Drinkability, well this is a very enjoyable all night sipper."
"Overall: This beer is great. I am happy to have got the chance to try it. I have a few more bottles, and I am interested to see how it holds up. Another great beer from Lost Abbey."
"Drinkability is pretty good, while it was a little over-whelming at first it grew on me, although is nevertheless a very slow sipper that doesn't call for another bottle. Also, the usual high Lost Abbey price doesn't help."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a medium brown foamy head with great retention and great lacing. Aroma of tar with some light alcohol, some coffee and a huge Belgian style malt base. Taste is also quite different then most IS out there right now and is comprised of a mix between some tar, some light coffee, load of Belgian style malt but no black chocolate note as I had expected. Full body with great carbonation and some light alcohol was discernable. I thought this was an interesting beer closer to Allagash Black then most American style IS out there."
"Pours pitch black with a dark tan head. Nose is a cocoa molasses thing. Kind of morphs into something different as it warms. Flavor is nice. Thick and robust. Massive malts. Massive chocolates mixed with molasses. The alcohol does show itself a bit too much IMO, but it really isn't that bad. Feel is smooth on liquid with a nice carbonation. The alcohol is slightly noticed on this one which cuts down the drinkability a bit. But still, this is tasty. I'll admit this is a less attentive than normal review than normal as I just wanted to sip the beer and enjoy. I'm sure you'd have no problem doing the same."
"D: Really did not know what to expect from an american double being made by a brewery that specializes in Belgian styles. Really nice but they added a little something to make it their own."
"Pours a four finger light tan head that fades very slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Totally black color. Good carbonation and heavy bodied. Malty/alcohol nose. Flavor is molasses and some alcohol. Some dryness at finish. Decent imperial stout. Pricey at $13.99 for a 750ml bottle from Yankee Spirits South Attleboro, Ma."
"Deep deep black with a killer brown/tannish head on top. You could do the head with a spoon trust me. Roasted and mild espresso notes in the aroma. A tad boozey in spots. Yeasty and earthy. Big and bold dark chocolate flavor. Somewhat lactic tang to it that is on the border of being belgian. Big roasted and mocha flavors. Creamy and silky tasting. Good mouthfeel-has a funy sort of dry and flour-like feel to it. Very, very enjoyable beer. Great stuff."
"Deep and dark, with a big billowy head and great retention for a big brew. Lots of chunky tan lacing down the sides of the glass. Smell is pretty nice. A seductive sweet chocolate with roast scents coming through. Alcohol is evident but not overpowering. Taste is great. Much more roast flavors coming through. At times, almost a hint of smoke. Very rich coffee flavors that blend with sweet flavors of chocolate. Similar to sweetened coffee. Just a big of funk added and also a hint of ripe fruit. Mouthfeel is silky smooth, so much softer than I expected. It's very delicate on the tongue and only makes you want to take the next sip sooner. Overall, a treat for sure. Thanks goes to seaoflament for the chance to try this one."
"Thanks for the trade Crushinat0r. Pours a chocolately thick dark brown with lots of attractive dark brown head. Balance is always worth currency, and this RIS has it. Chocolate and roast and not overdone though substantially roasty. Thick mouthfeel. I have had lots of great imperial stouts recently, and this is included in the group. Satisfying and very drinkable."
"Pours a dark black body with a medium brown head and nice lacing. Aroma is lightly sweet with black berry, light chocolate, yeast and cherry. Flavor is sweet chocolate, coffee and just a hint of alcohol. Medium body, creamy texture. Finishes sweet with a slight alcohol burn."
"Pours a lightless black with dark brown edges. Two fingers of foamy brown head have nice retention and leaves great lacing. Smells of citrus, roasted malt, chocolate, raisins, anise, and coffee. Tastes of citrus briefly up front followed by molasses, roasted malt, caramel, chocolate, and dark fruits. Finishes with good bitterness of coffee and licorice. Full bodied with good carbonation. Smooth and creamy, roasty, and sweet with a nice bitter finish and barely any sign of alcohol. Another excellent beer from The Lost Abbey."
"As for balance, flavor, detail, and overall character, this is one incredible beer. I couldn't have told you there was 10.5%abv if I hadn't had a whole bottle to myself."
"D: This is not a good beer. This is a great beer. Why is Cali so far away?"
"I'd love to elaborate on this but the score should speak for itself. This is an elite Imperial Stout, no doubt."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, spritzy, fruity, and chewy"
"Pours a hazy dark brown, some orange highlights, thin tan head forms, drops to a thin ring, tons of lacing, great retention. Smell is wicked, chocolate and roast, toffee, light funky middle, dark fruits, toast, yeast, wood, very earthy and complex. Taste is similar, rich bitter chocolate, roast, toast, brown sugar, dark fruits, yeasty, some sour funkiness, more chocolate and roast, maybe a hint of vanilla and wood, great. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, smooth and easy to drink, thanks a ton Jan."
"Drinkablity- Overall this is a fairly tasty Impy Stout that I enjoyed. It can get a bit cloying at times but I'm sure it'll drink a bit easier with time. I really liked the mouthfeel after some of the carbonation leaked out and this brew doesn't have as much of a coffee/chocolate thing going like so many others do. Nice change of pace. Big thanks again to Adam and Matt!!"
"you know Vinnie just knows its true"
"I've been looking forward to this one for a while... The cork gave a solid pop when the bottle was opened and a giant fluffy cap of brown bubbles appeared on the pour. Clumpy, streaky lacing formed as the foam slowly settled. The beer was basically black with faint reddish edges. Great head retention. Rich aroma, lots of malt and chocolate notes, nutty and roasted, light alcohol. As it warmed, dark fruits and vanilla notes appeared, perhaps a bit of lactose character. Very nice balance and complexity in the nose. Dry cocoa and dark chocolate flavours kicked things off, followed by roasted grains and alcohol towards the end. Lingering dark chocolate and alcohol. Hints of caramelized sugar, raisins, yeasty bread, and vanilla appeared as it warmed. Full bodied and smooth, but with high carbonation that didn't really work for me. As it warmed and the carbonation died down a bit the texture really improved. Significant alcohol warmth. I really liked this beer. Other than the initial carbonation, this was top notch and I really enjoyed it."
"Drinkability - this is hands-down what a double stout ought to taste like. A few knocks here and there on some smaller details, but a great beer."
"I'm not sure how accessible this one is, but it's definitely worth a try if you can get it."
"This pours a dark brown/black with a dense mocha colored head that lasts for some time but leaves little lacing on the glass. It smells of heavily of burnt/roasted malts, followed by dark fruits, chocolate, and booze. Taste follows from smell with plenty of roastiness and chocolate and a warming, bitter, drying finish. Full bodied and easy going down."
"d: Thanks to WeisGuy for this one. I had high hopes, but this one came up a bit short. Overall though, this was a big, full flavored stout that was a lot of fun to drink."
"Poured into a tulip a very nice dark black color, awesome carbonation, huge two-finger plus creamy dark tan head, which leaves tons of nice thick sticky lacing. The nose is malty, with some figs/raisins/plums, nice tones of toffee/chocolate, nice touch or caramel. The taste is awesome, slightly sweet, malty, nice touch of dark fruits, very nice tones of toffee/chocolate, with a nice added benefit of caramel. Full body, this brew is tasty to say the least, smooth, chewy/creamy, the alcohol is hidden very well. Very drinkable, and highly recommended. Thanks Andrew!"
"More licorice on the palate, but not as prominent as in the aroma. Java, chocolate chocolate chip cookie, fig, coffee bean. Very long finish leaves me thinking about espresso and dark chocolate. Just enough bitterness to balance things out."
"Drinkability: This is a very nice Double Stout; consumed young it is nothing special, but with a year of age on it, the flavors have blossomed"
"750 ml bottle purchased at Yankee Spirits in Attleboro, MA in March 2008. Served in my DFH snifter. Dense 1.25 inch tight, mocha-colored head floated on an opaque black sea of malty goodness before eventually settling into a solid layer of foam and tight ringlets. Sheets of thick, but watery lacing revealed with each tilt of the glass left behind some thin trails of foam. Scent of dark fruit, chocolate and malt. Definitely some alcohol heat detectable up front. More dark fruit, cocoa and a mild coffee character supported by a backbone of malt. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied, without being viscous, and lively with some carbonation burn, but also some astringency detectable along the sides of the cheeks and back of the throat before settling into a warming sensation that lingers between swallows. A very fine double that improves as it warms. Another excellent offering from Lost Abbey."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 2"" dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head lasts and lasts, with tons of heavy froth lacing. Aroma is rich dark malts with underlying alcohol. Taste is chocolatey sweetness upfront, coffee roastiness in the middle, and fruity alcohol slowly burns in on the close. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, and drinkability is superb for the style. I look forward to buying this one again."
"Bitterness towards the finish doesn't mix well with other flavors. It doesn't round it out at all. Almost out of place. Hard to drink, even for the style."
"As this beer warms the sweetness from the chocolate malts becomes more prominent and thebeer smooth out a little, but at the same time gets to be a little more warming."
"Black in color, with a nice looking tan head. Inviting nose, with a lot of depth (chocolate, dark fruit.) Flavor is fairly complex, with hints of chocolate and a wide array of dark fruits. Solid mouth feel. Lots of depth. This is a very nice belgian style."
"Very good impy stout overall. Complex in the nose and on the palate and a great looking beer. Here's to hoping this will be at least a semi-regular release."
"750 ml. bottle. Pours near black with a thick tan head. Aroma of chocolate, molassas, licorice, and roast. Taste is much the same with notes of dark fruit. Warming alcohol on the finish. Thick mouthfeel and medium -high carbonation. A big, impressive ,well-balanced beer."
"drinkability is very good. great balance. nice fruity and malty depth. i like the bit of nutty character too. this is great stuff!"
"Pours the typical onyx black with a surprisingly large (for a snifter) two finger brown head that dies down to a full creamy layer of bubbles. Swirling the glass leaves a wall of thick foam on the sides, very sticky. Smell is dominated by dark fruits; dates, raisins, and fig up front. A good amount of booze with some chocolate sauce melted over gooey brownies and toasted oats in the nose. Underneath all that sweetness is a tiny bit of smokey malts as well. Taste is pretty charred up front with a bit of chocolate and caramel malt sweetness. The dark fruits emerge midway with a some oaky tones as well. Aftertaste is a sweet brown sugar and molasses with a hint of dry espresso. A creamy feel that's a bit rough around the edges due to the high level of carbonation. It's a bit chilly in Syracuse tonight for being almost June, this fits well seeing it's a chewy sipping beer that improves as it warms. Decent beer, but there are better double stouts out there for sure."
"D - Great brew! I'm glad I got the chance to try it! Good balance and excellent flavor. Can't wait to see my family in San Diego and make the pilgrimage to pick some up."
"Typical L.A. bomber, caged and corked, w/o vintage nor freshness info (it would kinda be nice to have this info on beers like this one) Pours black, with a very dark tan head, that leaves moderate slippery lace. Espresso mostly in the nose, with whiffs of mocha and vanilla. Dense, deeply flavorful brew. More espresso, layers of cocoa, mocha and burnt/dark malty goodness. Sweetness is somewhat counterbalanced by some fairly subtle and late to the party hops. All in all a tasty and thoroughly enjoyable dark and muddy creation., Highly recommended."
"D- Great beer and can't wait to see how this one ages with so much dry notes in it."
"I could drink this till I had to call it a night. Drinking these it would be a quick night. I want to keep the glass attached to my lips so I can enjoy the flavors overwhelm my palate."
"Drinkability- Sans the carbonation, this was a nice stout. I've liked others better, but this is still a quality one worth trying."
"D- I like this a lot. You definitely notice the alcohol but it is very tasty."
"Enjoyable but never seems to warm efficiently to achieve true balance; the alcohol may be the main contributor. Don't get me wrong, though - this is very good stuff."
"Drinkability: Roasty to the max, baby! A very tasty, highly recommended stout from the fine folks at Lost Abbey."
"D: if I was stuck on a deserted island....this is one of those beer I can drink forever. the 11% abv was delightful and completely hidden."
"Pours a beautiful deep black/brown color with a lager quickly dissipating head Above average lacing and above average carbonation with a smell of sweet roasted dark malts. Tastes of strong coffee, sweet roasted malts, coffee, and toffee. Very Tasty Very GOOD - This one good beer. Drink and Enjoy!"
"Pours a deep obsidian black with a good fluffy tan head, not much lace but decent retention. Nose is full of chocolate and roasted malts and some slight copper. Taste is quite smooth, lots of roasted malt and chocolate flavor, some slight coffee and a little bit of dark fruit. some alcohol. Nice little hop lick on the finish. Mouthfeel is thinner than expected and preferred, but still quite good. Drinkability is excellent for the abv (my bottle says 11%) Overall a very tasty stout from the crew at Lost Abbey. Defenitely one I would pick up a lot if it was local. Would like to see some more body in the mouthfeel here, but other than that, this is a fantastically brewed stout. Excited to try the one in the cellar after a year or two. Great beer."
"Body was thick and carbonated. Pretty drinkable. Would drink it again if it wasnt $11.50."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"D - It would be a winner if not for the mouthfeel. I am still impressed, and hopefully this one will calm with age and become a gem."
"D: A powerful beer, wasn't my favourite RIS of all-time, but certainly a tasty beer, definitely a sipper I'd like to have around Yuletide."
"D: A quite delicious stout from Lost Abbey. I found myself polishing this off far too quickly. Super smooth and super yummy! I absolutely have to grab a few more bottles to cellar."
"Drinkability: Goes down easy for 11% ABV. Not sure if that's a good or bad thing."
"**one thing, though. Lost Abbey should really stop playing games with their ABV. I'm pretty well attuned as to my state of inebration, and Veritas 003 was way more than 8% and this is almost certainly more than 10.5%."
"750ml bottle that is marked at 11% ABV. Solid black color with a decent brown head. The smell is very nice malted milkballs and chocolate. The taste is not far behind, sort of sweet and I am actually surprised that the high ABV is pretty well tucked away. I thought this was supposed to be a belgian type stout but it seems like an American RIS to me. If you are into stouts you will not be disappointed by this beer, recommended."
"Very happy to see that Lost Abbey brewed a stout and quite a good one, this one has some serious againg potential as well, one of the better imperial stouts from the Southern California area, price is a little steep but will definitely drink again, certainly recommended"
"A very good imperial stout. Highly recommended."
"A really tasty Belgian stout."
"Overall - I was really happy with this one. It's one of the better imperial stouts that I've had. I can't wait to try one of these in a year or two."
"Overall, I really have to say that this one was outstanding. I was not sure what Tomme was going to do with this style, but it came out very nice, with their own little twist to it. This was more akin to the Belgian RIS style. Very big with just the right amount of yeast. Very highly recommended, you need to go get this one."
"The drinkability on this one is high. It is a heavy, dark, thick, viscous beer that begs to be drank anyway. I guess that is the point, like the serpent begged for the apple to be eaten this begs for me to drink it. WIth it being 11% it will quickly sneek up on me though. I do believe this one will cellar well, and i have committed a few bottles to my cellar for just that. This is toward the top, IMO, of the lost abbey portfolio, i hope to see it every winter :)"
"I've had plenty of pints of this on tap and find the bottled version to be just that much more enjoyable and should age like a gem!"
"Awesome head retention here and some nice sticky tan lacing all over my glass. It borders on a really full mouthfeel and the carbonation is light but right.The finish has a slight bitterness that I feel is both from notes of dark chocolate and a touch of citrus hops. Wow. This is a really smooth drinking, packed with flavour Imperial Stout and I'm so glad I sought it out. One of the very best that I've tried, for sure."
"HV"
"Amazing ability to convey the heaviness and density of such a rich brew with such lively mothfeel. Man. What a work of art this beer is."
"Bottle from PP bottle shop and poured into a Duvel snifter. Poured a jet black color with a mocha brown thick head, plenty of lacing.( read other reviews the carbonation is diffently a plenty in the bottle). Their is a lot of sediment at the bottom so watch out when pouring.( a quarter sized piece settled at the bottom of my glass but I was careless when pouring) Smell is a mix of dark fruit covered with slight chocolate and medicinal hop smell with a lingering alcohol present. Taste is upfront dark fruit with the chocolate and coffee coming next followed by a mild alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is fullbody but a little lighter than a lot of thicker Imperial stouts out there. The carbonation is a little high for my taste especially when combined with the alcohol feel but by no means overdone. This is a complex high alcohol IS ( bottle states 11% ABV) that isnt a session beer but I couldnt stop sipping until it was all gone."
"Drinkability is high, this is a solid stout with a good balance of malts and subtle hops, alcohol is well-masked, looking forward to try again when the bottles are released"
"Overall, I was actually a little disappointed. This is still a solid stout, but it was my favorite from the tasting night, and doesn't quite live up to my memories. Very sessionable though."
"Served on tap at the brewery during the Ange's Share Bourbon Barrel release. Poured opaque black with a dark brown head. Smells like coffee, chocolate, and smoke. Taste is a sublime combination of the same. Very well balanced and delicious! Initially, the amount of alcohol put me off a bit, but I enjoyed every drop!"
"Drink: This is incredibly drinkable for the strength and the flavors balance so well that one won't dominate and ruin the overall experience."
