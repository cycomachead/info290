The smell is amazing, the chocolate is the first thing that hits your nose, followed by the bourbon.  The taste follows the smell, with the chocolate up front along with bourbon and finishes with a subtle vanilla finish.  I'm not sure how they hid the 19 percent, you will need help, because it is sweet.","skiking70","Apr 03, 2015"
4.14,-8.8,4,5,3.75,4,4,"Very rich and sweet. Smell is absolutely amazing, one if the best smelling beers I've had. Chocolate, rum, graham crackers, cherries. Taste is  good but not extraordinary. Like I said, super sweet. Tons of rich dark chocolate. Figs. Port wine. Feel is heavy but not syrupy, fantastic warming from the impressive abv. Overall very good, but not one of bruerys greats.","Samuel906","Apr 03, 2015"

Aroma of black chocolates with quite a bit of residual sugar notes. Taste is also dominated by black chocolate notes with loads of residual sugar and a spicy finish. Vanilla notes are more subtle but kind of help smooth some of the rough edges of this beer. Body is about average for style with medium carbonation and warming alcohol can be detected. Big beer or sure that need to be split up between a couple of people, but very enjoyable beer nonetheless.","Phyl21ca","Jan 05, 2015"

4.56,0.4,3.75,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Picked this up in a great trade with Mike!  2013 vintage.  Pitch black pour with a quickly fading one finger caramel-colored head with minimal lacing.  The nose is huge chocolate fudge and booze, along with hints of vanilla, dark fruit, dark chocolate, and did I mention booze.  The taste is bold and super rich with once again, lots of booze.  Hints of vanilla, oak, dark fruit, maple, molasses, espresso, caramel, leather, tobacco, and milk chocolate.  The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with low carbonation and a great warming finish.  It approaches cloying, and it's definitely a sipper, but still incredibly drinkable for such a big beer.  Overall, yes, it's hot and boozey, but it's so good!  Much more upside than down.  Highly recommended!","beerdrifter","Dec 04, 2014"

4.58,0.9,,,,,,"Jet black with just a ring of tan head and no lace. Smell is full of chocolate and bourbon, rich roast, vanilla and a bit of liquorice, this beer smells absolutely incredible. Taste follows the nose and is even more of a treat than suggested, chocolate and roast, bourbon and vanilla, sweet but not near cloying, just a bit of alcohol heat but the 18% goes largely unnoticed. Lightly carbonated, full substantial body. Outstanding, I enjoyed this more than Black Tuesday by quite a bit and I really enjoyed BT, would welcome this again anytime.","peensteen","Sep 16, 2014"

4.72,4,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 12/4/2013. Pours nearly opaque dark brown color with a small foamy tan head with poor retention, that reduces to a thin ring of lace. Some slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk chocolate, fudge, vanilla, caramel, toffee, toast, coconut, bourbon, oak, and oak/toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, vanilla/cocoa spice, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge milk chocolate, fudge, cocoa, vanilla, caramel, toast, toffee, coconut, bourbon, oak, and oak/toasted earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, fudge, cocoa, vanilla, caramel, toast, toffee, coconut, bourbon, oak, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Absolutely insane complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt, bourbon barrel, and vanilla/cocoa flavors; with perfect balance of malt/barrel/spice flavors with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is incredible. Alcohol is insanely well hidden with only a light-moderate warming present after the finish. Overall this is a world class imperial stout. Perfect balance and incredible complexity of dark/roasted malt, bourbon barrel, and vanilla/cocoa spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. An absolutely stunning beer all around.","superspak","Jul 10, 2014"

Huge bourbon barrel characteristics with some some slight chocolate on the nose. Medium mouthfeel with more bourbon and some sweetness in the taste and aftertaste which helps cut the alcohol content. Not an overwhelming 18.5% abv at all and believe the cacao nibs and subtle sweetness help. Very little vanilla present if at all. Outstanding brew. Hoping I can move from PS to RS to stock up even more. Curious to see how this would taste with a bit of age on it.","JayPeso","Jun 22, 2014"

Moving right along... Chocolate Rain shows some serious promise but like Bourbon County Stout, I couldn't possibly see myself truly enjoying this beer fresh ever again. If I crave hard alcohol (which I almost never do) I'll pour myself hard alcohol. Chocolate Rain's Tripel Bock-like soy sauce nose is immediately off-putting but slowly opens up to richer nuances, transitioning into a fuller, more rich flavor of chocolate, vanilla tannins, and some trace of actual beer instead of solvent alcohol. I never age a beer I haven't had fresh but I'll count this as a learning experience; The Bruery's Chocolate Rain will probably be exceptional with 2-3 years of sitting in a cool, dark room on it which is the only way I'll have a bottle of my own next time.","BeerFMAndy","Beers"

Hint of vanilla. Flavor as my good friend describes it is more chocolate like than actual chocolate almost like a chocolate typhoon more than a chocolate rain. Obviously dark and milk chocolate dominate with large amounts if vanilla, coconut and brown sugar. The sweetness is really too much. Even as you drink this one it doesn't get any easier to bare the sweetness with the alcohol and bourbon taking a back seat even to how sweet it is. Full body and light carbonation, very smooth. Good but way too sweet for me. Glad I tired it.","kylehay2004","0"

Regardless, this stuff pours a very dark black-brown topped by a half-finger of wan sandstone foam. The nose comprises cheap boozy whiskey, wood, and a twinge of chocolate syrup. The taste holds notes of overly-sweet chocolate syrup, vanilla bean, toasted caramel, and bourbon. I don't ever say this, considering my sweet tooth is as long as an average femur, but this stuff was just way the hell too sweet for its own good. It's cloying, o'erwhelming, and wrong. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a semi-chewy feel. Overall, I don't get the praise this beer receives. I like incredibly sweet things, and it was too sweet for me. The bourbon is only there to color things in a drunken manner and provide an extra jolt of booziness, which itself is completely unnecessary, given the general booziness already pervading the proceedings. It was hard to finish my glass of this, and that worries me a bit. Not a fan.","TMoney2591","Sep 01, 2013"

Big vanilla chocolate nose with huge sweet bourbon and a bit of licorice and woody oak. Big thick mouthfeel, velvety, with low carbonation but not flat. Big burnt sugar and molasses up front, with sweet chocolate syrup on the back end. Bourbon booze burns on the time. Packs quite a flavor punch. Serious sipper with a lingering sweetness that is rather pleasant. Starts great, harsh going down and waaaay sweet, then the linger is fantastic after dinner treat. Age might do this well for that middle portion which makes it tough to deal with more than a small pour (5 oz here). Only two of us, so recapping the rest for tomorrow.","BMMillsy","Jun 20, 2013"

The flavors were awesome, but there were two main things holding this one back from being a top 10 beer for me: it was a bit too sweet, and it was a touch too boozy and hot, especially as the beer warmed up. I guess that's to be expected from a 19.5% ABV beer, right? So maybe I'm being too harsh. But the beer was still damn good and the flavors were on point. Overall, if this were taken down on the ABV level and the sweetness was controlled a little better, it would easily be a top 10 contender.","tectactoe","Feb 24, 2013"

Deep rich caramel and chocolate with hints of brownie batter, roast, vanilla and a fair amount of alcohol. You can tell this is high in abv from the aroma, but it never seems harsh. The flavor follows the aroma but the alcohol is a bit more evident but it really never harsh. Rich chocolate, vanilla, roast, caramel, and molasses flavors melded into a high abv sipper. This would be an excellent brew to sip with a few friends on a cold night with some cigars or brownies. Thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel.

The nose picked up some cocoa, vanilla, molasses, caramel, and paramount bourbon. The flavor profile was really impressive out of the gate. It wasn’t initially boozy, but it was very heavy on the cocoa nibs and vanilla. However, the booze hit quite hard in the back finish which pretty much dominated the rest of my drinking session. The malt profile was dominant throughout – more caramel, molasses, cocoa nibs, vanilla, dark fruits, biscuits, and some more booziness. Sticky mouthfeel with a thin to medium presence.

Since there are currently no Choccy Rains older than a year and a half and the first batch is very hard to get, this beer will take some time before it reaches its peak. When the time comes, I'll be sure to give it another shot.","Dennoman","Aug 20, 2012"

The nose had a potently aromatic vanilla, some deeper chocolate notes, prune as it warms, caramel sweetness, hints of alcohol. The taste has a big chocolatey sweetness and burning ethanol in the finish. The mouthfeel is sweet, but has a vanilla and chocolate presence that cuts through the ethanol (especially compared to Black Tuesday). It's not as thick and full bodied as expected, but the alcohol is well masked, even when it warms. This beer is noticeably better than the base, really drinkable considering the abv and heavy flavors","ThePorterSorter","Jul 29, 2012"

4.13,-9,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Had 2 bottles. Finally just couldn't wait anymore and had to crack one open. Pours dark black, with zero head, zero bubbles at all. The smell is way too hot. Loads of alcohol, as well as chocolate, roasts, vanilla, and a bit of bourbon. Taste is sweet from the vanilla. Not as much chocolate flavor as Black Tuesday, and also extremely hot. Just too much booze. However, once you get pass the booziness, it is blended nicely. Mellow chocolate, sweet vanilla, and balanced bourbon make the flavor have a lot to look forward to. Mouthfeel, once again, just overrun with booziness. Full, and creamy, but the booze is just too much. Overall, I gave this a 4.5 based on how I think this will develop. I'm going to wait at least 2 years to open my 2nd bottle, and I think this will be amazing once the booziness fades. At the moment, I prefer Black Tuesday over Chocolate Rain, but that could change with some age.","1Adam12","Jul 17, 2012"
4,-11.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Shared this bottle with the girlfriend and some friends at Eureka! Burger last night. Pours a thick black color with little to no head. Some tiny brown bubbles. Scent is very sweet and boozy. The booze is very up front in the nose, which quickly switches to sweet chocolate and vanilla. Subtle sweet bourbon aroma with more intensified vanilla. Taste is not nearly as boozy as the nose made it seem. Very sweet though. Intense sweet chocolate and vanilla flavors...like literally eating some rich chocolate cake. I feel like there could have been more barrel flavor to this beer...and possibly a little overly sweet. Mouthfeel is full bodied and syrupy. Drinkability is fair, as long as you are sharing it with a good amount of people. Overall, I enjoyed Black Tuesday a bit more. This is a well-crafted beer that most breweries could not pull off (a 19.5 ABV stout that is drinkable!)...just good in small doses. Glad I tried it.

This and the '11 Black Tuesday were way hotter than I remember the 2010 and 2009 vintages of the base beer. Moreover, the look was sad and the feel simply too light and harsh to really be an enjoyable drink. While the appearance is a lost cause I'm afraid, some time will hopefully let the booze mellow and the feel smoothen out a bit, which will move this in the right direction. There is a lot of potential here, but there's too much "big" in the way. Thanks again for the bottles boys. I look forward to seeing how this one develops with a couple years on it.","Jeffo","Jun 19, 2012"

As far as drinkability goes, this one is a brute and is not something to be drank glass after glass of. It is rich and inviting and something I would like to be able to take in small samples on multiple occasions, not try and tackle an entire 750ml of. Fans of Black Tuesday will love this but in my opinion this is really hot right now. I wish I would have waited a year or more to open this.","stakem","Beers"

The biggest difference I noted was the lesser molasses and fruit element in this compared to BT, and the much larger chocolate and vanilla factor in this as well. This tastes more like a stout whereas BT tastes like a barleywine/stout blend aged in bourbon barrels. Regardless of the differences, this is one big, complex and sweet beast of a beer.

The alcohol isn't offensively hot, but it really creeps up on you (especially when you are drinking it side-by-side with Black Tuesday and drinking it during a large tasting) and the flavors are special, robust, and long-lasting enough that several sips are enough to last you a good amount of time before reaching that glass again. It certainly lives up to the hype and is one of the most unique and flavorful stout's I've ever had, but you need to split this since it is too much for one mere mortal to drink alone.","nhindian","Nov 21, 2011"

4.77,5.1,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Big thanks to heyohhh and mcdiddypop for sharing many fantastic brews. The elusive Chocolate Rain pours with a fairly standard appearance: near-black, with a very slight collar of deep umber froth; the only surpise is that it has relatively thinner viscosity. The nose is pure chocolate deliciousness with a surprisingly lowbrow reference: it is highly evocative of Nestle Quik powder. There is almost no booze to be found in either aroma or flavor, which is truly a feat, given the ABV. And it is quite delicious, flavor-wise, with chocolate-coffee-candy-liqueur notes akin to Black Russians or Espresso Martinis. The body is fairly light for a Stout, and in this case, it serves the brew very well. I am not sure if I prefer this to Black Tuesday, but I am sure that they are both phenomenal.","ktrillionaire","Nov 20, 2011"

The bitterness at the end is light and compliments the sweetness quite well. It drinkable thick and syrupy but drinks well for the size of this monster. Great beer.

The nose is big vanilla, fudgy brownie chocolate, a touch of oak and booze, maybe a hint of coffee. Really, what stands out is the vanilla and the fudge. Could probably sit and sniff this for days. The taste is outstanding - big dessert fudge, chocolate, vanilla, some present booziness, a bit of bitterness like baker's chocolate. Really decadent and quite good. Rich, but in a totally different way than Bourbon County Rare. That flavor was deeper and smoother. This is a bit rough around the edges. The mouthfeel is fantastic, big, sticky with low carbonation.

Not awfully sweet on the flavor - the vanilla really thins out the mouthfeel. Retronasal is straight burn. WTF, this isn’t even enjoyable.

I suspect it will improve over then next 12-18 months, but I long for a bit more roast to my stouts and that is definitely not happening here.

Mouthfeel is really thick and there's some residual sweetness. Along with that, there is a bit of booze in the finish. Nicely done.

Like BT, it displays an abject lack of roast or coffee aromas, this has plenty of caramel to go with the chocolate. The palate is what you'd expect - chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, brown sugar, no tannins and intensely dessert-like. It's good for what it is, sweet and boozy on the finish, a decadent treat.

4.62,1.8,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Review #500!!! Had at the Bruery Reserve Society Party. Served from tap into a Bruery sampler imperial pint. Poured pitch black with a slight brown hue with a half finger tan head that subside to a minimal amount quickly (I blame the ABV). Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass (which was surprising). The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, chocolate, and vanilla. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, vanilla, and alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall impression: Good God this thing is good! It was truly excellent in all aspects. I can honestly see why so many people have been looking for the bottles that were released now. Glad I have one for myself. It hides the massive alcohol present in this one really really well. Kind of scary if I'm honest. This is an absolute must try, whether it be going to the RS Event or pulling out all of your trading ammo to land a bottle. It is TOTALLY worth it. But it is a sipper, so be warned.","thagr81us","Jan 10, 2011"
4.47,-1.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"On tap at the Bruery Reserve Initiation party 2011. Pours a dark black/brown non see through color with a slight dark tan head that collars around the glass. HUGE aromas wafting out of this one with notes of dark chocolate, vanilla, cream, barrel, and a slight warming booze aroma. The first sip yields a nice medium/heavy mouthfeel. The flavors are well blended but the chocolate is very noticeable and pleasant. Other flavors include vanilla, roast, and booze. For being 18.5% this beer drinks very well albeit still a sipper. Probably would be best as a dessert beer. This one was great!","kbutler1","Jan 10, 2011"
4.55,0.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"D - Slight burn, but for the amount of octane this beer has, the burn is every so slight. Dangerously drinkable.","teamizm","Jan 10, 2011"

4.42,-2.6,4,4.5,5,4,3.5,"Poured a very dark brown with maroon brown highlights when held up to the light that had a half finger of brown head and left some good frothy lacing sticking to the glass. Very nice bourbon vanilla and chocolate aromas pop out on the nose with cocoa, caramel, and toffee notes but with some booziness as well. The taste was also very chocolatey like the name says with bourbon, vanilla, and cocoa accents roasty character but did have a touch of caramel toffee plus there was definitely lots of booze but it didn't overpower the overall flavor. The brew was medium in body with a nice amount of carbonation which had a roasty, chocolatey, bourbon, sweet, creamy, and chewy finish. Definitely an amazing tasting black Tuesday hybrid that will knock everyone socks off. I'm glad I got to try it and was a sipper faux show.","Gobzilla","Nov 22, 2010"
4.7,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Drink- I wanted it all day long. It's potent, viscous and big. Very tasty and very pleasant. Patrick and the team knocked it out of the park with this one.","FosterJM","Nov 08, 2010"
4.87,7.3,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"I have gone back for repeated tasters of this every time it has been available for me to taste. They shouldn't mess with this recipe (i.e. Cherry Chocolate Rain). Patrick, please just make more of this and sell me cases of it.","the1DarkLord","Nov 05, 2010"
4.82,6.2,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"D: Heaviness and high ABV make this one to be shared. This would be an excellent nightcap. I enjoyed this more than Black Tuesday and wish it were bottled.","Mooch273","Nov 03, 2010"
5,10.1,5,5,5,5,5,"Pours a dark, dark brown, almost black. Virtually no head, just a giant slick of oil. The smell is chocolaty sweetness. The taste is the familiar Black Tuesday, intensely flavorful and sweet but the chocolate adds another level of complexity without really adding to the sweetness of an already very sweet beer. The chocolate is very evident but not overwhelmingly so and is a wonderful compliment to this beer.","aknight","Oct 31, 2010"
4.67,2.9,4.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"Drinkability - For such a high abv beer (the highest I've ever had) it is "easy" to drink. I had no problems putting my pour down in a relatively short time (okay, perhaps there was a bit of a fire lit under me to try the other beers in the remaining hour I had). Nonetheless, worth the hype. Damn good.","SpdKilz","Oct 29, 2010"
4.62,1.8,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Beer has this creamy mouthfeel from the cask, its sweet and has some minimal bitterness on the back from the chocolate. The forward flavors are like a hershey bar dipped in bourbon, its great, its not cloying or overpowering its just really solid. The finish is nice and not too dry, a little dryer than the regular Black Tuesday but overall its a great beer. I would definitely have it again, only if they would bottle this.","drabmuh","Oct 28, 2010"
4.35,-4.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"D: Enjoyable drink in small amounts, especially on a cold night. I wish I could have a few bottles of this and let it sit for a bit, opening it every winter and seeing how it changes.","antioch","Oct 27, 2010"
4.42,-2.6,4,4.5,4.5,5,4,"D- This is such a delicious beer but its so rich and at 18+% it is one heady beer. I could drink a lot of this though. Oh so good.","domtronzero","Oct 27, 2010"
4.59,1.1,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, this is awesome, and I'm not just saying that because I enjoy sucking down rare DONGs so much. Drinkable for the amount you should be drinking.","nickd717","Oct 27, 2010"
4.74,4.4,4,5,5,5,4,"On cask at Black Tuesday. Chocolate Rain rests a near lifeless opaque brown in my glass, only a few wispy bubbles floating on top show signs of carbonation. It smells like chocolate cake and booze-soaked vanilla beans - the complexity of Black Tuesday's aroma has largely been stripped away and replaced by layers of chocolate, bourbon and vanilla. The palate is equally decadent, and offers a touch more complexity in the form of subtle oak and roast buried beneath the rich dark chocolate and vanilla. This ended up being every bit as enjoyable as I was expecting, hopefully more of it is made next year.","largadeer","Oct 26, 2010"

4.07,-10.4,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"D: A very nice stout. I was a bit underwhelmed as I missed it last year and have been waiting for this moment. Not as good as regular Black Tuesday for me, but in the whole scheme of things it is well made in its style.","Halcyondays","Oct 31, 2009"
4.17,-8.1,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Delicious to sip, but I wouldn't want more than the 4oz I consumed on any given evening. A bit blended with Black Tuesday produced a spectacular brew... returning some carbonation and just a touch more roast balanced the sweetness and deepened the mouthfeel to produce something truly sublime.","errantnight","Oct 30, 2009"

4.88,7.5,5,4.5,5,5,5,"All in all, this was grand. I would have given it all fives, but I just do not like bourbon. If you love bourbon I expect you'd rate this flawless. I would have given the taste portion six if I could have.","ButtWizzard","Oct 29, 2009"
4.84,6.6,4,5,5,4,5,"The deliciousness of the beer is unquestionable to me, but the balance of the original BT gets lost a bit. A beer of this magnitude is usually either incredibly boozy or balanced with things such as malt sweetness, bourbon, or espresso. What Black Tuesday did so well was deliver the oak, bourbon, and malt qualities all at the same time to create a beer where everything is married together in near perfection. The addition of vanilla bean and cocoa nibs (not to mention the factor of lack of carbonation) amps up the sweetness to overpower the oak/bourbon. If you dig syrup, this might be your preferred brew. The feel is thick and despite being still was quite refreshing and very easy to drink. I finished my first pour of this before I even knew what had happened. The alcohol is just about nonexistent in this, which is absolutely preposterous. I had to go straight back for another pour. Then another... then... let's not get too much into details.","vacax","Beers"

4.89,7.7,4,5,5,4.5,5,"The beer has lost balance and become more of a desert beer, but I can't argue with the final product. Alcohol is well hidden. I notice oak, barrel tannins, toffee, plums, dark cherries, and grapes. The sweetness reminds me of brown sugar. Blackstrap molasses is well integrated, and I again detect subtle black licorice notes. The finish is a satisfying recapitulation of all the aforementioned flavors with lingering notes of bourbon, vanilla, and dark chocolate. Full bodied with a silky, sticky, and viscous mouthfeel. The carbonation is low but fitting. This beer is decadent and delicious.","HopHead84","Oct 29, 2009"
5,10.1,5,5,5,5,5,"Drinkability - I could moderately sip on 8-12 ounces of Chocolate Rain all night, as this beer should elevate it's qualities at higher temperatures. The 19.5% ABV is nearly indiscernible, respectively, thus permitting the drinkability at a whole new level.","azagthoth","Oct 28, 2009"
4.92,8.4,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"D - For a 19.5% beer, this is incredibly drinkable, dangerously so...very low presence of alcohol in the flavor (the other beers on tap had way more alcohol presence - Autumn Maple, for one). Should be a slow sipper, but tastes so good, it is hard to drink this slow. This makes a perfect desert beer all by itself.","portia99","Oct 28, 2009"
4.62,1.8,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D - One sip can last a few minutes with all of the lingering notes in there. I don't think it's as drinkable as it's counterpart, Black Tuesday. I wouldn't want to have more than 8-10 oz of this at a time. It's a perfect dessert beer that'll cap your night off with a big smile. But I think it also loses something with 0 carbonation.","Kaiser81","Oct 27, 2009"
4.67,2.9,4.5,5,5,4,4,"D: As I mentioned in the taste portion of the review, the alcohol component is quite prevalent on the palate, and nobody should be surprised by this at nearly 20% ABV. But, it does detract from the drinkability, despite the awesome flavors and aromas. An amazing concoction.","womencantsail","Oct 27, 2009"
4.92,8.4,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Bravo. What a beer. My heart breaks a little every time I've thought of the fact that I may never have this beer again. Makes me want to buy cocoa nibs and vanilla beans and try and make my own out of my Black Tuesday. It's THAT good.","nomomentwasted","Oct 27, 2009"
4.72,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,4,"Amazing, but a brutal monster of a beer that really needs some carbonation. Fortunately, regular Black Tuesday is carbonated and much better because of it.","srroos","Oct 27, 2009"
4.97,9.5,4.5,5,5,5,5,"hands down one of the BEST beers I have ever had the chance to drink. I read a while back that someone compared vanilla bean dark lord to "gods cum" well if thats the case then this is what god was drinking for a few weeks before releasing the vbdl. well worth the hype. in fact I dont believe this beer is getting enough hype.

4.87,7.3,4.5,5,5,4,5,"Just like Black Tuesday, insanely drinkable for the ABV. Now, it's not getting as high of a score from me, as I like to be consistent in my preference for beers with some level of carbonation. While the thick mouthfeel is pleasant enough, I must admit that the pancake flat cask effect could have been enlivened by some bubbles.","Overlord","Beers"
4.92,8.4,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"I preferred this over Black Tuesday. I heard some people say the opposite though. Black Tuesday was really really good, but this was even better for me. The chocolate and vanilla and on cask really took BT to a new heights. Wish they would bottle CR! I found myself struggling to actually order black tuesday over chocolate rain. But I did it anyway, and then got some more chocolate rain taste from a friend.","mikedashg","0"
