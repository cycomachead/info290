"Bam dark chocolate bitterness right away hard. Silky smooth in the mouth, really really pleasant mouth feel. Then the Chilli's come through. Spice. Finish is bitter chocolate with a hint of tongue tingling chili. Wow the chilli. Unique taste but I must confess i don't love it that's on me not Prairie."
"Sweet chocolate pepper aroma. Very sweet. Lots of chocolate and vanilla flavor with a mild peppery bite. Up there with the best."

"Beautiful Beer. Perfectly balanced with all the flavors. Mouth feel is exceptional, silky smooth with slight carbonation. Drink this Beer."
""
""
"Poured into sniffer. Deep brown with minimal head. Chocolate and vanilla notes. Blended exceptionally well. Coffee chocolate upfront with booze on the backend the booze disappeared with the chili peppers. Wow! Let it warm then it transformed. Booze is hardly noticeable at 13%. complex brew well done. Glad I had the privilege."

"Trying my best to taste what all the fuss is about. Although it is impressive that every flavor and ingredient that is described comes through nicely in all it's balance, it's the way the peppers show through that sets this apart in my eyes. To me it drinks like a lot of other very well done imperial stouts. Bomb is a fantastic beer . . . But probably no better than any other more readily available spiced stout in your area."

"O – For everything going on in this beer, it is incredibly balanced and really allows each component to not only be discernible but to shine.  Aging has mellowed some of the bitterness and alcohol harshness, and has subdued some of the chili spice. Excellent."

"Delicious, bold, coffee. Liquid velvet."
"After being completely underwhelmed by Christmas Bomb, I was prepared to be disappointed. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised. Heat is mild and in the finish. No carbination, coffee, chocolate, hint of vanilla."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tasty and very interesting flavor."
""
"O.   An awesome beer.  Very nice flavors that balance well.   I'm really happy with this beer and will be looking for more."
""
""
"Really, really well balanced. Not one flavor is overwhelming here, but there is a lot of complexity going on. Very impressed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet with good body. All around awesome beer!"
""
"Friend brought me back a couple of these from TeXas and I couldn't be any happier. Such a amazing taste to this beer!!!"
""
""
""
"This beer is so good it's stupid. The smell is an intoxicating mix of coffee and dark chocolate that hints at the beer's heavy alcohol content. The taste of the coffee is awesome. I can see why the brewer featured the coffee brand on its label. The rich flavors of the beer hide the alcohol taste dangerously well. While it is a gorgeous rich dark espresso color, there was not much of a head on it."
""
"Overall great beer. Interesting combo with the espresso, pepper, and chocolate executed well. Flavors are bold without being overwhelming and alcohol is well hidden for such a high abv. The coffee and peppers really hit my sweet spot, looking forward to having more of this soon."

"Chili peppers right out of the gate! Followed by the cocoa, dark chocolate and coffee in the nose. Super dark brown color with ruby reddish hues when held to the light. Liquid oily thick viscosity yields a frothy top layer of micro bubbles and spotty patches of lacing along the glass edges. Bold and complex flavor profile is surprisingly simple. Tastes like chilies, then evolving into the sweet chocolate and finishing with the bitter dark roasted coffee. Soft and gentle carbonation allows for each sip to be enjoyed on the palate and finishes extremely well with very little heat from the chilies or alcohol. So easy to drink and no way to tell it clocks in at 13%. To summarize; Bomb! will go down as one of the more amazing Imperial Stouts I have had the privilege to indulge!"
"Was excited for this one. Not a huge fan. Think I feel for the hype."
"Make more of this damn it! Make less of the crap you brew that sits on the shelf for a year... Im talking about you Birra!"
""

"Simply an amazing coffee stout."
""
""
""
"O: Greatly executed beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: This is now one of my favorite stouts. My only complaint is that it is a bit sweet. Other than that it is damn near perfect. I need to get my hands on more of this."

"Expertly brewed and worth the hype. Glad I got to try it. Pricey at $10 for 12oz., but definitely worth grabbing a few and stashing them away for a special day/night."
"Barely any head on it. Smells kind of like a earthy garden. I do smell some chili. Initial taste is cacao and a hint of chili up front, then comes some alcohol taste. The finish is tart but yet mostly of coffee. Overall is it worth the $10 for the 12oz? Probably not. Serpent stout is still better in my opinion, but I at least tried it, right?"
""
""
""
""
"Pours with a small, copper head. Is black in color. Has aromas  of chili peppers, roasted malts, coffee, and vanilla. Initial taste is of chili peppers, coffee, and roasted malts. The presence of chili peppers almost over powers the coffee and and roasted malt flavors. All flavors persist through final taste with the taste of alcohol entering to finish off the symphony of flavors. If alcohol content was decreased along with a reduction of chili peppers used, the beer would go from amazing to phenomenal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Faint heat, the big flavors are coffee and vanilla. Smooth and not too heavy considering the strength, so watch out."

"On draft at the Hourglass Brewery. Pitch black body with hardly any head. I can pick out the chilies in the aroma along with a lot more coffee than expected. Chocolate is also present. The taste is coffee forward along with a complex blend of sweet milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and vanilla. There is a vegetable taste from the peppers that I do not care for. I get medium heat from the chilies and very minimal alcohol presence for the ABV. The mouth feel is very smooth, but I would prefer a little more body. This is a very well crafted beer and I would like to have it again; but I don't care for the vegetable taste."

""
""
""

""

"The nose on this is enough to scare a lot of people off and away. If you can get past that, then it's not a bad beer. Could be much worse. Would be much better to cook with."
""

""

"Chocolate and vanilla up front and throughout, with just enough chile and coffee on the finish to add a ton of complexity. Easily one of the best stouts I've had the pleasure of tasting. Thank you, Craig!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow. Huge beer by prairie. The chili is the perfect amount. Coffee is exceptional. Delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow, a really great balanced imperial stout. The flavors all come through separately the vanilla keeps it sweet and the chocolate isn't bitter like some stouts. The pepper removes the alcohol burn. At 14% this is a great beer. The mouthfeel isn't as viscous as some of the big stouts but it's good. Seek whenever you can"

"I enjoyed this beer on draught at the Beer Trappe in Lexington, KY. It pours opaque black into a snifter. The head is a mocha brown that dissipates quickly. The nose is predominantly roasted coffee followed by rich spicy Mexican chocolate. That's exactly how it tastes, also. Peppery dark bittersweet chocolate predominates over the roasted coffee and grilled breadfruit.  There is very little gas in the mouthfeel which is just right, not too thin or too thick.  Overall close to perfect. I hope to try a bourbon barrel aged version in the future."
"When it first hits your tongue you taste chocolate.  The after taste is when you get to the chili pepper. It's a burn, not from alcohol but the actual chili peppers.  The longer it sits the more flavors you smell. This is one of the best beers I've had. I would definitely buy it again. I recommend anyone to try it if they haven't already."
""
""
""
""
"My first review was bad must have been the oxidation issue. This is Amazing!!!"
"Pours black with a dark tan head.  Smells of dark chocolate, hot chocolate, dark roast malts and vanilla.  Tastes of Dark roast malt, a little burnt, some booziness, dark chocolate, a little pepper spice and vanilla.  Some pepper spice, roast malt and chocolate on the aftertaste.  Heavy body and medium/light carbonation."

"Swag syrup. So smooth. Like the best bowl of oatmeal on top of a scoop of vanilla ice cream."
""
""
"Pretty good beer. I was impressed with the complexity as well as how well the alcohol was hidden considering the ABV. Pours black with what appears to be a crimson lining. Smells of warm chocolate and coffee. I was expected a smoother, silkier mouthfeel, but nevertheless satisfied. Overall a great stout. Not sure if worth the $8/12 oz bottle, but it's only money right."
""
""
""
"Way too much coffee for me, didn't even taste the chilies. Christmas bomb is much much better... I'll try this again in a better setting because i have another bottle, and i'll quite possibly revise my rating."
""
"This stuff is really good. Dark in color with a little hints of the peppers but nothing to overpowering. I really enjoy this and would drink it again."
""
""

"Overall - I've been wanting to try this one for a long time, and it did not disappoint.   I love stouts with chocolate and chilies and this is one of the best.  Always nice to have a beer that lives up to the hype.  4.75 paws."

"Purchase Value – (C) Enthusiasts who find this beer should expect to dish out between $6.50 -$8.00 for the beer on average (Legacy sold it for $6.25 per beer). This is right about in-line with what I would expect for a “world-class” offering. They are hard to acquire and a bit of a splurge, but well worth “bombing” your wallet for."
"I found the balance between coffee and cocoa very nice. Didn't taste the chili peppers too much. Definitely worth the wait!"
""
""
"Overall an amazing stout. I'm anot usually one for chilis in my beer but this one really hits the mark."
""
"Side-by-side with Hunahpu's and Abraxas. I rank it third among the three, however it is far from disappointing! As it warms the flavors become more present. Less spice among the three, which is what I was seeking out. Cinnamon would be a good addition. Great coffee flavors, hints of chocolate and a very mild heat from the chilis. Not overpowering or lingering. The 12oz bottle is perfect for a solo drink."

"Pours a black body with a thick dark brown head. Chocolate first in the flavor as well as dry cocoa. Green chilies come on giving just the right amount of burn without crowding out the other flavors. Found the body to be medium, not as thick as i would have expected but that's probably due to the chili pepper. Very good stuff."
"Had this for first time and wow, this was the BOMB!  really enjoyed this and was worth trying.. liked the hint of the chili peppers they weren't over powering just right amount of kick, lots of chocolate flavor too."
""
""
"Orange wax poured into tulip glass. Alright, nothing great. Heavy pepper taste which I normally like but not digging here"
""
""
""
"A very good beer with tons of flavor.  The spiciness and roasty coffee flavors play off one another nicely and serve to mask the 13% ABV.  It definitely ranks near the top of my stout list."
""
""
""
"2015 12oz. Aroma and taste explode with huge notes of coffee, espresso and chocolate. Slight vanilla and chili peppers, but very very slight. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and this goes down very easily for 13%. Coffee and dark chocolate/cacao bitterness remain in the aftertaste, but it's not too brutal on the palate. A truly great double/imperial coffee stout."
""
"Update:  Wait, the chili creeps up..."
""
""
"Pretty sure something is wrong with this bottle. Rusty cap and there's a ""snot"" in the bottle. Will need to try again."
""
""
""

"I can smell the chili peppers, slight chocolate, coffee and tobacco notes. It tastes mainly of chocolate and coffee. I don't really detect the chili pepper flavor.Very smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is exceptional. Alcohol is entirely masked and I taste every bit of coffee and chocolate. Almost perfect."
""
""
"Very good beer.  The heat was pretty much concealed.  For a alcohol content this high it was extremely smooth to the palate.  Had some interesting spices in it.  Had to be the chili peppers.  Highly recommended."
"Wow , What a nice Beer ; Great job , love it !!!!   OMG...!!!"
"Hate to say it but just a bit too much going on for me"

"Overall: Very balanced beer considering everything that has went into this.  Crazy how you get such strong smells but the taste comes out much difference. Very excited this beer finally is available in my home town."
""
""
""
"Split with my wife, very chocolate nose and taste.  It starts sweet and the vanilla comes in with an almost chocolate and coconut.  There is a slight spice but it hit with the alcohol making both subdued."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Full flavored and complex; all the additions work harmoniously to elevate a strong base beer."
""
"Totally awesome brew. Love the pepper incorporation which hits in the nose and especially in the back. A stellar offering from Prairie!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a thick, dark, delicious looking coffee color with a tan head that dissipates moderately quickly. Visible lacing around the glass. Awesome bitterness on the finish. Amazing beer. Get here"
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bomber into a snifter glass.  It is allegedly the Pirate bomb aged in rum casks.  Definitely looks aged.   Smells of espresso beans, chocolate with vanilla and coconut.  Still pours dark black but I was in a bar so lighting is poor.  Thick flavor of espresso followed by the chocolate, vanilla and coconut.  .  Thick and chewy in the mouth as well.  Goes down more like espresso than rum.  The rum is hidden very well but you can detect it.  Liked it a lot.  High ABV though so beware."
""
"Very well balanced. Would drink again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not sure if I want to age this on as its drinking great fresh, the coffee works well and I'm not sure if I'd want it to fade, not much booze fresh either, oh well I'll find out anyways because I'm stocking up"
""
""
"O: Wildly unbalanced, at least to my tastes, as almost all I got was the double-hit of dark coffee and chiles. I can see where the infatuation with beers that feature one or two huge flavors to blow your face off gets this beer its high marks, but it's probably not a repeater for me."
"Cocoa  followed  by strong vanilla  notes then punch of peppers great combo. Solid 5 for sure"
""
""
""
""
""
"Smells like a warm doughnut fart on a cold winter day. Makes you glad to be there, but sad that you were."
""
""
""
"O: Very-good-to-excellent."
""
""
"Infected bottle? Metallic taste with non-existent vanilla and cacao."
""
"This tasting, however, is with no paired food. Just sipping this on a Texas night with temps headed down to 18F. Not much a better choice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful blend of flavors that work very well together. The chocolate, vanilla and cacao nibs combine and work to enhance the chili flavor which is just enough to enojoy and appreciate the uniqueness but not overwhelm the palette."
""
""
"2013 Blue Wax...chiles have dissipated a bit, but super solid"
""
""
""
"The beer is very smooth.  I have not had a pepper beer before but it complemented the coffee flavor perfectly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: How can anything at 13+% be this drinkable?  Even after it warms, the chocolate, coffee, and other wonderful flavors stay up front w/ the alcohol a well fitting compliment.  Tremendously well done."
"O- anxiously awaited this beer and it does not disappoint. Solid all the way around."
""
""
""
""
"Wow! What a incredible stout. If you like this type of ale definately keep an eye out for this one."
""
"Taste is phenomenal. You cannot distinguish the 14%ABV on the palate. I was skeptical of the use of pepper but post-taste it is the highlight of the enjoyment. This is by far the most enjoyable pint I have had the honor to partake. Thank you Prairie Artisan Ales; you once again shine through in craft beers."

"A very nice beer, and super smooth and silky for the high abv. Very nicely balanced. with the coffee, chocolate, and ancho chilis all contributing nicely. Everything is beautifully done, but a slight knock on the aroma- it's just a little out of balance with the anchos predominating. I like this quite a bit, but not quite as much as Westbrook Mexican Cake, which is the same idea."
""
""
""
"O - An awesome imperial coffee stout.  Up there with Breakfast and Wake and Bake.  Glad to have Prairie in GA!"
""
"Not a bad brew. Much better if you age it for at least 6 months"
"A little pricey, but a good brew!"
""
""
"T: This is the second time I've had this. First was at a beer festival; I was underwhelmed but wanted to give it the benefit. It just doesn't have the elegant, lush, glorious, or decadence that I crave from a stout of this gravity. Cacao bitterness, a little spice kick and sweet vanilla rounds it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is an incredibly well made beer. Definitely lives up to the hype, definitely something I'm going to trade for"
""
""
"Pours black with a small tan head. Aromas of cocoa, coffee, oak and faint pepper. Taste is much more subdued than I expected. Initial flavors of dry cocoa and coffee are upfront...then some of the barrel character across the middle with light vanilla, dry oak and a slight bourbon. The spice from the peppers provides little heat, which isn’t a bad thing necessarily. The thinner mouthfeel for the style, coupled with a dry/slightly chalky impression, makes this beer easy to drink. Good beer, but seems to lack the robust and bold flavors of some of the other imperial stouts."
"O: never thought I could smoke a stout but this is as close as I can imagine. Drinking the whole thing myself where 6 ounces would do. Probably won't look for this again, it wasn't really what I was expecting, but I'm glad to have tried it. 4.0"

"Sweet malt is a bit much, chipotle heat, chocolate."

""
""
"Nearly black, slightly carbonated and beautifully muddy beer.  Nose is reminiscent of a cacao liquor - perhaps Kahlua.  The initial flavor is dominated by cherry and chocolate notes as the pleasant chile flavor sneaks in the back door.  Mouth feel is a bit gritty but strangely seems to work."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very smooth stout for such high ABV. Hardly noticed the booze. Finishes with a nice little chile pepper taste."
""
""
"Most recent brew. No wax. Peppers subtle, but nearly non existent. Big chocolate nose. Perfect mouth feel, and incredible drink-ability given the ABV."
"Solid stout.  Nice smell and really smooth.  Taste is excellent."
"Mouthfeel- a little heavy on the carbonation but doesn't take away from the beer, overall it's two thumbs up in my book. Cheers!"
""
"Reviewed a red wax bomb. This beer was all peppers on the nose and taste. It was extremely overpowering. I have had many beers with peppers that were great.mthis was awful"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"basic stout with adjuncts I don't care for."
"Note:  Try to age this beer for at least a year.  I noticed a very favorable difference between the aged and fresh Prairie Bomb.  The chili peppers are less pronounced in the aged beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I wasn't a fan of this beer, which tastes a lot like what Founder's Breakfast Stout would taste like if you added a bunch of tar and cheap, burnt coffee from the gas station. Given the overwhelmingly positive reviews here, however, I'd be interested in trying it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: quite good. A favorite coffee stout"
"An Imperial Stout brewed with coffee, over cocoa nibs, vanilla beans, and chili peppers.  Very well balanced with a very nice slightly sweet/coffee/spicy nose.  It packs a punch but is not overbearing.  Should be enjoyed at cellar temperature in a goblet."

""
""
""
""
""

""

"By far one of the best stouts that my brother and I have had. Smooth without that usual wet ash tray nose. Plenty of flavor and the alcohol doesn't overpower the beer in any way. Pretty easy to down this one with little effort. My brother who has been shying away from stouts recently was totally impressed with Prairie Bomb, as was I.  This will be one brew that I will continue to try to get more of for sure."
""
""
""
""
"Earthy and herbal smell, surprisingly. Bit of tobacco. Really nice chili and chocolate mix in the taste with cinny. Spicier than mex cake"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Maybe it was the few beers I had prior to tasting this, but every sip offered a different taste. Some were dominated by the cocoa and vanilla while others showed evidence of the chili peppers. Very good, complex beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is one of only a handful of chili stouts I have tried and this one is definitely bold. I could probably drink Xocoveza all the time, this is a once in a while kind of brew. It it impressive nonetheless and I am happy I had the opportunity to try it. Still not found a 5 beer, but this one is damn close. My only complaint is that it was a bit thin on the mouthfeel, not really thin necessarily, but for the alcohol and flavor profile it would be amazing if it was a bit more viscous, I believe it would totally be a 100 beer or damn close, if it were."
""
""
""
""
"O--Excellent stuff.  I was super-impressed with this beer.  So many imperial stouts carrying a 14% ABV are barely drinkable.  This beer is incredibly well done and I would be happy to get my hands on another one.  Well done."
""
""
""
"Mostly a coffee taste and didn't get much of the cacao nibs, vanilla or peppers. I like a good coffee stout though so I was okay with that. There did seem to be a little bit of ""a kick"" in the nose though and that might have been the pepper coming through. Nice and drinkable for 14% abv."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The coffee is infused brilliantly and meshes with the other adjuncts almost flawlessly.  The only thing I would have like to see more of was a bit more heat form the chills."
""
""
""
"Overall: The bomb isn't a dud, but, frankly, I was surprised at its overwhelming reception online. Really, I was thankful it was only eight ounces. Though, that's just one beer monkey's opinion, which is in the minority."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  Disappointed more than anything else.  Was really looking forward to tasting this guy after all the positive reviews.  It was an okay beer, but not really impressed with it.   Smelled promising though. It is not worth the difficulty in picking it up in my opinion."
""
""
"Excellent!!!"
"Solid black with a thin cream head. Smells of malt and other notes. Strong sweet taste that is balanced by dark malts and chocolate. A little chile spice at the end that tickles the tongue. More carbonation than you'd expect but in a good way. A little cloying but in proportion to the abv. Overall excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
"I am typically a sucker for big, coffee-infused imperial stouts, but Prairie Bomb! was a bit of a letdown. The roast in this beer was quite overstated and the chilis were too intense for my liking. Toward the end of the session, I definitely felt a fire in my belly. Since there is supposedly a lot of variation in this beer between batches, I would definitely like to give it another try in the future."
""
""
""
"I have had 4 batches of Bomb!. Batch 6 and 7 were disappointments. Although batches 3 and 5 were great, this recent batch is definitely a sign to me that this brewery is no longer worth my time or money."

"Wow.. The hint of chili's blew my mind. Had it on tap at Torst in Brooklyn NY."
""
""
""
""
""
"Lots of huge flavors brought to the table here and somehow they end up working out together. Chiles are flavorful and a bit warm and integrate smoothly with the massive espresso and sweet vanilla at the end. This is my kind of dessert. Also, insanely roasty... like burnt in a good way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like coffee..."
"Overall: great tasting and absolutely dangerously drinkable for a 14% beer.  I could see getting bombed on this pretty easily."

"O: Definitely glad I found a 4 pack (although a little pricey). I will hold off on drinking the rest for another 6 months or so to let the flavors and heat mellow out."

"Picked this up in a trade with Cisco!  Thick, pitch black pour with a nice two finger caramel-colored head that fades quickly with minimal lacing.  The nose is absolutely huge and complex, dominated by big roasty coffee and surprisingly strong chili notes.  Hints of dark chocolate, cocoa, vanilla, espresso, and leather.  The taste mirrors the nose with all the featured elements sharing the spotlight equally.  Huge roasty coffee with fudgy dark chocolate, cocoa, espresso, chilies, and vanilla.  The mouthfeel is thick, creamy, and mouth-coating with incredible balance and huge drinkability with subtle chili heat on the finish.  Overall, this beer delivers in every way. All the advertised elements were bold, yet equally represented with over the top drinkability.  Right up there with Abraxas.  Highly recommended!"

"Flavor- upfront characters are dark chocolate and espresso. Followd by mild vanilla, toasted malt nights, and molasses."

"Overall, we’ve been hugely excited for this beer, and are wonderfully grateful to have found it when we did.  We were honestly not sure if we would truly ever get a chance to try it, actually, as our timing as of late seems to have been perfect for always missing it.  Alas, here we are, and what a massive beer it is!!  We were actually taken aback here.  From the description of the ingredients the base beer was aged over, and the sweeter aroma, we were so, so surprised at what a bitter flavoring was presented.  If anything, this simply acts to slow the drinker down so that they can savor each sip.  This bitterness is primarily in the form of acidic coffee bean roastiness, cacao, and yeasty metallics.  All of the inclusions blend expertly together, but each of them are powerful enough to stand on their own, at the center of their own beer.  Actually, the chili peppers are rather subdued.  This was likely intentional, so as to produce the most widely marketable beer.  Not just something chili-heads like us would seek out for the heat.  This is a super-duper beer, and amongst the most serious and thoroughly top-quality we’ve ever come across."

"O-  Possibly the best coffee, cocoa, and pepper stout I've had to date.  The flavors are all bold and complex, but come together perfect on the aftertaste.  This one comes highly recommended and is another winner from Prairie Artisan.  Just wish I had an endless supply for the colder months."

"Fresh, on tap. Aroma is roasty, with coffee grounds balancing against red chili pepper, and a dark chocolate base. Flavor is boozy initially, with lots of vanilla and bourbon. Then, the spice and dark chocolate kick in mid palate, with light sweetness contrasting the pepper notes, which provide a touch of heat in the dry, toasted, roasty bitter finish. Very complex brew. Very smooth and drinkable for the abv."

"O- In light of the high regard for this beer, I have to wonder if something was wrong/off with the bottle I got. I let it scale in temp from 45 to probably 65 degrees, hoping it would open up a bit, but not much changed.  If my bottle is at all indicative of what this beer is all about, I'm shockingly underwhelmed. I'm curious if some age could bring this all together, perhaps by dulling the coffee notes, but that would take quite the transformation."

"This is a wonderful Mayan stout, though it doesn't unseat Mexican Cake as my all-purpose touchstone of the style. Nonetheless, I'm keeping my eyes open for this the next time I'm in the OK/TX area."

"O:  I will not be trading for this beer or intentionally seeking it out again, but if I happen to walk into a store and it’s on the shelf, I will very much consider paying $7 a bottle for it."

""
""
""

"O - This is good and if you like chilies you will rate this higher than I did. I also didn't find much of the vanilla in this beer, but the alcohol was very well hidden."

"O: 4.71 - Awesome beer. Being from Texas I naturally (ignorantly) despise mostly everything to do with Oklahoma, but damn that's a good beer. REALLY good beer. It's certainly the bomb! This beer goes for around $25/4 pack in my area, which I feel is just a little steep. It's an awesome beer, though, and I think you get more ""bomb"" for the buck with this over Bible Belt. Good, good stuff. Woo pig."
"This showed up on tap at my local beer bar. It's definitely a beer that will knock you out if you don't know it's 14%. So smooth and delicious without much of an alcohol flavor. Wish I could find this somewhere so I could stash a few bottles!"

"O: Amazing. Honestly one of the best imperial stouts Ive had. Unlike other chili stouts this one is all about balance and delivery an amazing beer not just a different experience. I could drink this everyday. Looking forward to crushing this in the depths of winter."
""
""
"Overall:  I've had this a few times on draft and now I'm excited to crack a bottle to review.  This is perhaps still the only chili beer I have had that I will enjoy to have again.  Upon opening the bottle you are quickly greeted by all the ingredients with aromas of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla beans with all these working in perfect unison.  This is even more demonstrated in the flavor with a blend of all these with a persistent chili spice that is persistent throughout and stays right in the back of your mouth.  Most impressive is how hidden the alcohol is with little to no booziness in the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is very coffee forward, creamy. As it warms up, the chilli begins to come out. Not my thing . Becomes very bitter as well. The chilli is a little too much. Dominating.It kills the vanilla, coffee. The smell is the best thing about this stout. Good, but not for me."

"Has a very creamy, chocolate defined beginning, with earthy, calming malts, which maintain the balance of this brew, as sweet molasse, caramel and pungent tobacco come up, to form a very convincing, smooth start. Then, soon, uncompromising, burned coffee bean notes get detectable, which counter the established, rich, earthy sweetness by adding an almost dry bitterness to the beer, while hot chili peppers lend a hot, spicy background depth. This spicy sting stays on the back of the palate till the very end, altough the beer finishes with great chocolate qualities, blended with bitter coffee tones. Complex, slick and smooth in the mouth, a full-bodied, fantastic beer."
""
""
""
""
"Very good, smooth and drinkable stout. Complex flavor profile, but the peppers come on a bit too strong at the end, not allowing the other flavors to linger as one would like. Still, this is an excellent beer and worthy of its lofty reputation. I have had it on tap and from the bottle. Consistently good and probably the best beer I have tried with spicier than average peppers added. I had it once with food (Peruvian food) and it went very well."

"Smells amazing! Huge chocolate smell, hints of vanilla, roasted notes, pours very little head. A lot of carbonation... First sip taste a nice roasted chocolate, light bodied and the peppers come in full on the back end. Surprising light bodied for a 13% ABV. I do wish it was a bit thicker. Notch below Mexican Cake and I have yet to try Huna. I am glad I have 1 more bottle left"

"The other day I was able to find this gem at a local bar here in Houston. After the first sip of this stout I realized that I underestimated the ingredients. Never have been a fan of pepper added to my beers but this one had the perfect emulsion of pepper, cacao nibs, and a hint of vanilla. As the title explains the flavor, an explosion of flavors graces your tongue with an imperial finish. Nice golden head with a dark chocolate body. Highly recommend this!"

"Very good stout.  The chilies weren't as pronounced as I anticipated (recent batch) but all aged flavors were well balanced.  Good stuff"

"O- This beer is all about a great blend of flavors with the heat of chiles on the backend. It definitely works and the chiles add just the right amount of heat without overpowering the beer. However, when compared to beers like KBS which I recently drank I find it falls short. Still a beer you want to be drinking."

"I gotta say, the mouthfeel of this beer is top notch. Nice and full bodied with lingering layer after layer of flavor. Good medium carbonation level that helps with the balance of the many flavors. Smooth most of the way through, sweet, fudgy, a little earthy with a spicy finish and lingering spice warmth at the end. Nice sipper of a beer. Really good beer, I don't know quite yet if it's worth all the hype, but I'm really glad I got a hold of a bottle. Thanks Matt for a nice trade. I'd drink Bomb! again for sure."

"Pours a nice dark beer. Forms a small dark brown foam. Smell is normal chocolate, coffee, nothing out of the ordinary for an imperial stout. Tastes like a good imperial stout, nice and smooth, not heady at all, lots of chocolate and coffee, not bitter. Then, you feel some heat in your throat, some tingling. The peppers hit you in the back of the throat but not in the mouth. Fantastic work. Body is syrupy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark black with a lucious three finger chocolate laced head and clingy lacing everywhere, the smell is dark chocolate with an underlying chillie smokiness and coffee, the mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth with perfect moderate carbonation and the tastes are simple with the usual lineup of flavours you would expect in a big stout starting with a big dose of milky chocolate, vanilla,cacao and a slight smokiness from the chillies but no heat whatsoever and finished like a coffee with some sugar bittersweet and overall a bloody tasty Stout that will age well but once again its a pricey affair but its off my bucket list cheers."

"Overall, this was a top level non BA stout. A massive amount of flavors. The only thing I would complain about is a bit too much roast, but otherwise I really like this one."

"Pour is black with a creamy mocha head. Nose is heavy coffee roast, pretty clean/not acrid, fair bit of vanilla and a light tinge of pepper. Full bodied, creamy and well carbonated. Taste has more pepper but still light (which I prefer). The roasted coffee is most prevalent and the vanilla comes in nicely behind but not sweet. Reasonably balanced, not sweet, pepper balances with vanilla. Not really chocolaty but a decent stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel has all the trademarks of the style and its uniquely American nature: huge, rich robustness in a thick, extremely full body that isn't thinned by the alcohol and is velvety smooth on the tongue, rolling off just the right amount of carbonation and extremely creamy. The fluffiness building from the carbonation does give it a lighter feel in the middle into the smooth finish, but never much less than full."

"This is a very special stout.Pours almost pure black with a half inch head but I was careful on my pour.Nice frothy lacing that goes away and leaves a little ring around the head.Smell is coffee right away and alcohol to follow.First taste is coffee and then as I swallow here comes the chilis which I am sure cannot be good for my acid reflux but I had to gamble with this one...lol.Mouthfeel is warm and fizzy.This is not my favorite stout but it is definatly different and lives up to the hype in my opinion for at least originality.A bit boozy for my liking but all in all a great stout if you are open minded."

"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Head is minimal but lacing residue apparent on sides of glass. Color is black. Can taste a hint of the chili peppers, coffee and vanilla. Very well balanced and to say the taste is complex is an understatement. There is a lot going on in this bottle of beer. Alcohol content is extremely well masked considering the ABV. An awesome beer."
"O- I was pleased that the spiciness was not overwhelming, and actually almost underwhelming. But I think it was spot on for my tastes. The coffee flavor was superb, but what held it back from being a world class 4.5+ beer was there wasn't much of a third flavor blended in. But overall a great beer and you should try it if you haven't."
""
""
""
""
""

"Chilli lingers a lot longer than other palates elements, and the initial hit is all flavour, leaving a mid hollow palate and chilli afterwards, thus a bit unbalanced overall."

"Just excellently tasty stuff and it's great to have the opportunity to buy this in Sydney. Thanks to Prairie."
"Overall - Quite nice! On average I'd still prefer a nice bourbon barrel stout, but this definitely deserves the hype."
""
""
""
"Overall, yeah, this is another cracking brew from Prairie. I'm yet to have a bad beer from them, and this is probably even pushing up their average despite the average being very high already."
""
""
""
"Overall, awesome stout. Didn't really get much vanilla or sweetness, but the coffee and chiles worked well together and the think mouthfeel gave it a milkshake character. Drinks like a beer with a much lower abv than 14%, which I'm always a fan of."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: 4.25 Probably a bit more going on than Bible Belt, but I think I prefer that over Bomb. It seemed a little richer and the chile was a bit stronger. It also seemed like Bible Belt had a more dry chile flavor while bomb comes off as more of a fresh chile. This is really nice, but for me it comes in at a close second."

"Acquired 1 bottle in a trade via a facebook group. I also got a bottle of Bible Belt in the same trade, I drank the BB first. I found the BB to be much spicier than this beer, which was liquid perfection to me. It pours black as night with a nice head that doesn't stick around too long. Smells of vanilla, cocoa and oatmeal with very light chile. The taste follows the same, the chile hits a little at the end, but it is much subtler here than in the Bible Belt. I loved this beer and I can't wait to get more. The spice of the chiles is in perfect balance with every other flavor of the beer."

"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is jet black, with a frothy, small bubbled, foamy, light tan head that quickly settles out into a halo. Strings of carbonation bubbling throughout the body. Aromas of rich roasted coffee, butter cocoa nibs, subtle pepper spice, smoke and tobacco highlights, woody highlights, and hints of molasses. The smoke and tobacco build the more you dig in. Flavors are coffee and chocolate forward, like a mocha fist to your taste buds. Wow...perfectly balanced and flavorful. The pepper notes are very subtle, but you begin to notice a building warmth in the backbone of this brew. Woody and vanilla notes flit in and out to accent, but never draw attention away from the beer as a whole. The body is smooth and big, yet light, as well, thanks to the carbonation. A coffee heavy aftertaste, with an overall roasted feel. The finish is slick, smooth, and light, with a subtle warmth and bitter linger. This is a great beer. Big characteristics all around, but amazingly drinkable!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good, but I expected more. There are other chili stouts I prefer to this one like Huna, Mexican Cake and Lucador to name a few. Certainly worth a try though."

""

"Coffee dominates the aroma and flavor yet, the other ingredients blend into the mixture nicely. The 13% ABV is nearly undetectable. Personally, I am getting no vanilla in the smell or taste. No matter, this is an impressive imperial stout."
"Overall: I am not sure what to think about this beer, too much going on for me, roasted coffee, peppers, bitterness, heat, complex but I am not sure if this is a good thing. I love stouts and porters with peppers, but I think the flavors in this beer don't mix well, leaves a dry coffee bitterness that lingers on the palate. I was expecting more especially for the price, $9.99 for a 12 ounce bottle."
""
""
"O: Really really tasty. Definitely recommended."
"This is amazing. My first bomb right after a Bible Belt and this blows it away. The flavors are similar but this is so much more balanced and subtle. Nice vanilla coffee cacao and a hint of chili combine nearly perfectly. I thoroughly enjoyed this and look forward to opening my other bottles."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a good beer. 2 fingers of dark kaki head, black as night. Smell is predominantly coffee and cocoa nibs with a subtle spice diced peppers smell. Taste gets a bit more complex with amplified notes of what you smell… No vanilla at all for me, kinda disappointing there. Feels great on the tongue like any good RIS. As I said at the beginning this is a good beer… this is not a great beer. Abraxas is a vastly superior mexican style imperial stout. Maybe this just needs age… will re review in a year or so."
""
" is prominent on the tail end, but it is a welcome break from the intense bitter and earthy flavors of the cocoa nibs and coffee. This beer is incredibly well balanced. It drinks remarkably well for that high of an abv. Cheers on this right here!"
""
"Appearance is that of your typical top flight stout. Smell is heavy on the coffee and a little chocolate. Taste is very solid, but like the smell it was just a little too heavy on the coffee and hop finish. I really liked the subtle hint of chile but its very slight so its added very well. Biggest highlight to me is how this 13% beer is so light and not boozy at all. Feels like an 8% Stout. Overall I highly recommend a sampling but I can't quite put it into that top tier with a small handful of others that I liked better."
"Pours out like old engine oil with a dark brown head which clears quick. Bit of carb noted. Looks like its sprinkling on top of the beer.  Smell is of rich dark chocolate and dark coffee. Smells like a big stout. Raisins and molasses come through as well. Taste is out of this world. Dark chocolate and burnt coffee throughout with the slightest touch of heat at the finish. Mouthfeel is about perfect for me too. Coats the mouth well, tingles the palate and the heat at the end ties everything together. Overall one of my favorite new beers. Gotta have this if you love stouts."

"12oz bottle purchased for $8.99, pretty damn pricy for a non-barrel aged stout. I am always suspicious of these high priced beers from new breweries even if people are hyping them to hell and back. Suspicions confirmed. This was a good beer it was just grossly overpriced, $5 would be much more appropriate. Dark solid black, coffee colored head, looks pretty rich. Aroma was a touch of chocolate and thick imperial stout. Flavor had notes of chocolate but I didn't really pick up much coffee or peppers. This was good but I think Bible Belt was better and it certainly wasn;t worth the price tag."

"In the taste, hazlenut, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, mild spice, wood, char, toast, molasses, and a fair hop bitterness. A little alcohol comes through. Full bodied, smooth drinkable brew. This is delicious. Not much else needs to be said. Overall this is a big beer that is awesome."
""
""
""
"And I just love it's a 12oz'er"
""
""
"O- I wanted to like this more with all the hype, but I wan't blown away. It's very, very good, but not as perfect as I thought it would be. Maybe the flavors have to meld for a while longer... glad I have two more bottles."

"O: Wow.. Lived up to it's name. And I wish more beers with this high of gravity would come in this format instead of bombers. A dangerously drinkable, chocolate filled, vanilla soaked, imperial stout that goes down like silk. If you don't like this beer you probably don't like the style.."

""
""
""
""

"O - This is one beer that is hard to criticize. What else is there to say about this that hasn't been said already. I am glad that I have another in the cellar. This one seems like it can go another 6mo.- 1yr, but it probably won't make it that long. I would be more inclined to drink this fresh as to get all it has to offer before it fades away. Buy/trade for one if you haven't had it! I promise you won't be disappointed."

"I've had literally hundreds of stouts from around the world and this one is hands down top on my list. The appearance is beautiful, the smell is rich, the taste is out of this world and the mouthfeel really sets a high standard for any other stout I might want to try out in the future."
""
"This is a hyped beer that clearly has earned its praise. Pours a pitch black color with a mocha brown head, and barely any head ever accumulates. Smell is muted at first, but as it warms up milk chocolate bursts onto the noise with some coffee as well. First sip is creamy and smooth with vanilla and sweet chocolate melting on the tongue. Then as the sip settles a strong coffee bitterness pops and brings the roasty malts along with a tiny bit of that pepper. Also, at 13% there is hardly any alcohol presence to speak of, to the point where I almost forgot to even mention it here. Mouthfeel is creamy and sticky as it warms up. Full body and mildly carbonated. Overall, this is an incredible beer and I highly recommend seeking it out. Im not usually the biggest fan of coffee forward stouts, but the smooth vanilla/milk chocolate superbly balances the coffee bitterness and roasted malts.And for reference this was fresh, so It'd be interesting to see how this ages. (98/100)"

"This is one of my absolute gold standards for stouts. Poured from a yellow wax bottle into a tulip glass. Poured a thin, caramel head. Aromas of vanilla, roasted malt, coco, and coffee. Taste is so sweet and pleasant with ample vanilla to balance the roasted malt and coffee flavors. Unbelievably smooth with just a minor hint of chile flavor and virtually no residual heat. I could drink this all day/night/day...!"

"My god this is amazing beer... Deep dark pour with minimal head that dissipates to nearly no lacing. The smell is fantastic! Chocolate, coffee and a hint of the steeped peppers. Mouthfeel is perfect. Rich, smooth and with long lingering chocolate notes. Hints of peppers well hidden in the back ground. I honestly can't find fault in this beer. Wish I had access to it."

"Pitch black in the glass with two fingers thick fluffy light brown foam. Rings of delicate 14% lace left behind. Smell: vanilla, milk chocolate, light earthy and caramel espresso. A little chili. Taste: milk chocolate, caramel, sugary plum, vanilla, espresso note - earthy, building chili heat (and then after a while it's no longer noticeable). Medium bodied with light carbonation and very creamy. Easy drinking for the abv. This really showcases the aging adjuncts... I'd question whether the base beer has anything going on, but there's no point in that as the result is very tasty."

"O- Prarie Bomb is an awesome beer that uses the adjuncts nicely to create a tasty beer. While I wouldn't say it is quite as good as Hunahpu it is definitely up there with one of the better 12% non-barrel-aged beers that I've had. This is definitely worth trying even if you don't like chili beers."

"Minimal carbonation and lacing, no bottling date so don't know the age on this one. Smell is primarily coffee, with some vanilla sweetness and there is definitely evidence of the chili peppers. The taste parallels the nose, predominantly coffee, with hints of vanilla and chocolate, and then only a bit heat from the chili peppers on the finish. It is remarkable how well everything comes together in this beer. For as complex of a beer as this is, it is exceptionally smooth. A little too much dominance by coffee for my personal preference, but a highly recommended brew. Cheers"
"This is a stout for big stout lovers who like theirs on the dryer side. This beer would probably age well for a very long time."
""
"O- This beer is awesome, very happy that I saw able to try this. Alcohol is well hidden."
""
""
"Prairie has reached a great balance of adjuncts here. All four (coffee, cocoa, vanilla and ancho chili) play into the overall flavor, contributing to a well executed and flavorful stout. Bomb! is worthy of checking out and I'm looking forward to drinking more."

""

"P.S the ABV is totally hidden!"

"Taste is big vanilla...lots of roasted malts, chocolate, and then ends with a nice bite of heat.  Its not over sweet at all....not over done with the heat...not over anything, its damn near perfect.  Chugable, yet full of so much flavor.  I absolutely love this brew,"
""

"Chocolate, vanilla and chili peppers is a combination that is pure gold, and this goes for more a chocolate forward feel than some of its brethren."

"Another in a line of stouts brewed with cacao and chili peppers. Well done but not in the class of Huna."
""
"O-Overall I nee to first say that I don't drink stouts. I have tried a lot of them but Im just not a fan of them. This beer has changed that. I haven't ever had a stout that packs so much well blended flavor. This beer is so well balanced, every ingredient plays its role to a T. I'm looking forward to getting my hands on this beer again hopefully. Try it if you can you won't regret it."

I get chocolate, a hint of vanilla,a strong dose of coffee,and some roasted malt in the nose. The mouth prickles the tongue between the spices and the chili peppers. The front of the palate is heavy with roasted barley,chocolate,vanilla,and coffee."

"Overall: A family member tasted this and asked the ABV. As I reached for the bottle I answered 9%. I was a bit surprised to see it was 13%. This stout easily drinks like a 9%. The flavors are are so damn seductive and inciting. I didn't want this beer to end. This is a must try."

"Pours a deep black color with a short tan head with minimal/no lace. The nose has a great spice, hot and pungent chili peppers, sweet roasted malts and maybe a touch of coffee. A surprisingly balanced chili pepper stout, a really nice dark, roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee but finishes with warm chili peppers. A nice thick body and standard carbonation, silky, smooth, round."

"Looks the part of an imperial stout. Black, coffee colored head, poor head for that matter and poor retention. This is par for the couse on impy stouts though, especially one of this strength. One of the most remarkable aromas on a beer I've found any time in the recent past. Huge aromas of vanilla, cacao, coffee. The vanilla aroma is wild. So many beers with vanilla in them the vanilla comes across as chocolate, or cacao, but this is vanilla and huge. Love the other subtle aromas too, chocolate, some earthy quality from the chili. Vanilla comes on first wafting over the palate followed by earthy pepper flavor. This all melds with chocolate and cacao. Alcohol pops up here and there but especially the finish, though it is hard to seperate the alcohol heat from the chili heat. Thick, rich, full, what else can you say. Overall the only fault of this beer is that it is slightly hot, but I don't think that could be fixed given the strength. Otherwise so amazing."

"I can smell the chocolatey, vanilla spiciness as soon as I pop the cap. Pours a black, black, viscous body with a chocolate brown two finger head that dissipates at a medium pace. I can also smell all the ingredients: coffee, cacao, vanilla, and chile peppers. Taste is more, a lot more of the same, deliciousness that hit the nose. Overall, I really loved this beer. Really glad I was able to try it, and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a complex stout that blends its flavors with the utmost harmony."

"O - A big improvement over the Vanilla Noir, this stout fires on all cylinders. The numerous flavors blend together rather seamlessly, and the alcohol is incredibly well masked. The only downside to this brew, which is kind of a big one, is the price point... $8 for an imperial stout is more than a bit expensive, and will certainly keep this out of any kind of regular lineup or trading for it more than once in a great while. But with that said, a delicious brew, extremely well crafted. I would recommend everyone to try this at least once."

"I tried Prairie Bomb at the Brass Tap in Round Rock, Texas (a great place by the way). This was recommended to me by the Bar Maid who had an absolutely incredible knowledge of her beers. The taste is rich with coffee / chocolate accents - mouthfeel was as smooth as velvet. I sipped and enjoyed this brew for at least 45 minutes - which honestly - is a long time for me to savor any brew. I've got to testify....this a Mighty Fine Ale!"

"O: Amazing flavors. My buddy wasn't as big a fan as I was. The chile peppers detracted from his experience. However, for me, they were a perfect counterpoint to the rich and decadent chocolate and vanilla notes. I only wish this beer were fuller bodied. It felt a bit thin in the mouth. Overall, though, I consider this an absolutely stellar beer and rank it as my number 1 non barrel aged stout."
"This is 14%?? Really? Holy balls this is smooth as hell with the oatmeal giving it a velvety texture. Im glad the pepper fades for the most part, though it compliments well enough....something I rarely find works for me in a stout. Its like a s'mores with cayenne. I would assume to add alcohol to that, but the ABV is ridiculously integrated to where it tastes more like a Convict Hill than a BCBS. This is my first Bomb, and I was skeptical of the high ratings and the red pepper...but this is one of the best high ABV stouts I have ever had. It is not as complex and fruity as a BCBS, and likely wont develop as much with age, but right now, this is a phenomenal beer."

"Mouthfeel/Overall: Very full mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. Hides its ABV incredibly well. Overall, hard to grade this beer out any less than excellent. It is very complex, showing a lot of flavor components, but still has one elite defining flavor (coffee) that sets it apart from most other beers. One to seek out for sure."
"O: A great imperial stout. I'd love to get a bit more presence from the chocolate and chillies but, overall, it is a very good brew worthy of the reputation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a really pleasant and well thought out beer. The mouthfeel is the only thing that keeps it out of the truly elite Imperial Stouts. The chili element is nicely subdued, though I honestly enjoyed its integration here just slightly less than I did in Huna. Give this a shot if you can."
""
"Overall, a very delicious beer and one that I would love to get my hands on in bottle format to see how much some time would let the coffee and chocolate fade back a little bit and perhaps let the chilis and vanilla come to the front. But as is, it's a wonderfully rich beer that hides it's alcohol very well."
""
"o - Overall definitely a good beer, but a little too much peppers and spice int he taste for me. I still would definitely prefer Hunahpu to this based on the taste (had a 2013 4 days before), and would put this on level with the normal Abraxas, with a tiny bit more spice in the taste. The nose is great and it is pretty easy to drink, and well worth checking out. Would like to try Pirate Bomb now."

"O: As far as chili-stouts go, this one was pretty tasty. It has good complexity and being a chili-head, I enjoyed the little burn that goes with it."
"Bitter roasted malts that were like burnt coffee. Didn't get any vanilla at all, but once the initial bitterness wore off, I got some dark chocolate followed by the spicy chiles. Certainly hides the really high ABV very well. Pretty interesting beer, and maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I were a coffee drinker. Otherwise, for how popular this is, I was a little disappointed."
""
"Overall, I really really enjoyed this bad boy... not sure why some people are saying the newest batch isn't as good. This is freaking delicious!"
""
"Re-review.  Early 2014 bottle poured into a snifter.  Pours a deep black with 1/4"" deep brown head.  Smells of brown sugar, some roast coffee and a hint of vanilla.  Taste is vanilla, milk chocolate, dark roast coffee, and a dry burn from the chilies.  Nice warming chile/alcohol finish.  Mouthfeel is light upfront, but the chilies and coffee leave a nice lingering oily flavor behind. Overall this is still a great beer (especially at it is becoming a shelf beer).  Perhaps not quite as complex as Huna,  but a bit more chile forward.  Definitely a favorite."
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is really nice. Nice head, very little lacing. Nose is a great combination of coffee, chocolate, and chili pepper. Roasted espresso beans, dark chocolate, chili pepper and vanilla all subtly presented and expertly balanced. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"O: An explosive grand tasting brew by anyone's standards. I really appreciate the delicate balance that was achieved with so many variables that were in play. The heat from the chilies help the bourbon create a heating blanket inside your chest. Makes me proud to be a native Okie. Cheers!"
""
""
"Overall - This is an excellent beer and dangerously drinkable at 14%. Would love to get my hands on more"

"Without a doubt one of the best beers I have had. Great initial appearance in the glass with a coffee/toffee head with the aroma of rich coffee and chocolate. The mouth feel was fantastic, rich & full but not overly sweet, leaving a great coating. The taste was excellent with the initial flavors of coffee & cocoa, followed by s light vanilla in the middle with just a hint of heat from the chilies on the end. All in all, one of the bet beers I think I have ever had and one to be savored if found."
""
""
""
"The beer pours an inky black-dark brown topped by a thin, loose tan head that fades quickly. There appears to be decent carbonation, some lace while drinking, but no sediment. The nose is initially cocoa and roasted coffee when chilled - notes of vanilla, caramel, some licorice, and booze come out as it warms. The taste is predominantly bitter and roasty coffee upfront, which is then smoothed out by the cocoa and malt sweetness and finished by lingering booze and bitter cocoa. Chilies? Naw son, don't get the heat, flavor, or scent (though they are possibly contributing to the beer's bitter finish?). Otherwise, the beer has bold, identifiable adjunct flavors, nothing is too muddled. For being 13-14% abv it has reasonably hidden booze, which is no doubt related to its sweet, full body, silky mouthfeel, and generous carbonation. For a stout this big, it's quite drinkable and maintains that shelf-status appeal. I'd drink this again, probably not if I'm out somewhere, but it's certainly appropriate for that day when you're just hanging out in your PJays and decide it's definitely 5pm in the middle of the Atlantic, so why not?"
""
"Pours a jet black with a thin brown head. Smells of milk chocolate, with some clean spicy chili flavor. The flavor begins with a huge vanilla burst, then some dark chocolate, a tiny hint of chili pepper, and finishing with a sweet licorice finish. Massive lush mouthfeel, coats your mouth. Overall an outstanding beer. Super sweet, but not at all cloying, the flavors meld extremely well together. Very proud of this local brew."

"Pours from the bottle a dark reddish brown. Creamy milk chocolate head that lingers for a bit. Heavy lacing. Smells of chocolate, coffee and malt, with a hint of chili pepper. The chocolate and coffee explode on the tongue with noticeable alcohol. The peppers give a nice tingle. There's a nice bitterness to this. Nice and oily, it coats the tongue without being particularly thick. This is a superb beer. I liked the characteristics the rum barrels gave to Pirate Bomb! a bit more, but this is one you grab every time you can find it."
"Pours out pitch black with a thin, tan head. Coffee and chocolate are strong up front with a hint of vanilla. I don't pick up much ancho, as I'm sure its raisiny notes get mixed up with the malty aroma. Chocolate is strong in the flavor, with the vanilla and coffee acting as accents to it. I get a lingering bitterness in the finish, which comes across as more hop than burnt malt/grain. I don't perceive the 13% at all, which is an incredible feat. The ancho warmth is very mild. If I didn't know it was in the beer, I'd assume it came from the alcohol, but it lingers a bit. Carbonation is a bit prickly, but the body itself is full. This is totally different from all the other Prairie offerings I've had (which have been fantastic), but it's equally impressive."

"An amazing beer that is masterfully constructed. I'd like to rate it higher on taste, but I think I'm just not used to these ``Mexican-style stouts'' yet, especially the chili peppers. I just can't find that many examples (believe me, I'd buy them if I could find them). If I could score a few more bottles of this, I think I would get used to the chili peppers and the taste would eventually get bumped up to a 5. I really like the way the flavors of vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and chili peppers all unfold one after another on the palate. Prairie is just an extraordinary brewery. I have been delighted with every beer of theirs I've had. More, please!"

"Pours pitch black with a thin tan head that dissipates rather quickly. Aroma of some dark fruit undertones, cocoa nibs, mild coffee, licorice, vanilla, chocolate and some sweet molasses. A sweet aroma which stays in balance and does not become cloying. Taste is savory and has notes of chili pepper, chocolate, dark dried fruits, raw cocoa nibs, licorice, fruity roasted coffee and vanilla. In the aftertaste you get the spiciness from the chilis which blend in nicely with the roastiness of the beer, but there is something missing in terms of complexity as a result of aging and the “fullness” of an imperial stout. Medium bodied with decent carbonation throughout. This was a dangerously drinkable beer with the high alcohol maskable fairly easy! However, I do have to go against the grain here and give this a rather outstanding rating just below excellent as there were several components to this beer that were missing in terms of complexity and being able to provide for a more memorable drinking experience."

"O - my first from Prairie and what a way to start. While generally I am not a big fan of either coffee stouts or pepper beers surprisingly this gem won me over."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very solid beer but there's nothing here to suggest that this warrants the lofty ratings it gets. I've had far better (but much less limited) coffee based imperial stouts. Definitely worth trying but not deserving of the hype."

""

"O - I'm very glad I shelled out for this, and glad I got a second bottle to age, just to see what it does. This beer has a lot of complexity that really plays with your palate. Very well done."

"With a 14% ABV this beer is not for the faint of heart. I very much enjoyed this beer after a big meal (as a dessert) and hope to see more Prairie Ales on the west coast in the coming months."
""

""

"O- A very good beer. Very easy drinking for 14%"
"M - Full body. Thick and viscous. Light carbonation."

"Pours out dark as night with a one finger brown head with decent retention and nice lacing. Smell is of coffee and what I would describe a green peppers. They just seem to smell very fresh and a almost as forward as the coffee. I certainly smell some raisins and other dark fruits in the background. Seems to be some burnt malts in the background as well. Taste is coffee forward with some chocolate I didn't smell in the nose. I can certainly smell some burnt malt and the more I drink the more I taste nice peppers in the background but nothing is too overdone. Just a hint of vanilla too. This is a really well balanced beer for so much going on. Mouthfeel is actually quite thick for what I expected given the head when I poured it out. Overall this is an amazingly good beer. It's one of those beers that one waits to find but don't find very often to be sure. This is an amazing beer that is well put together that I would recommend to anyone who likes a tiny bit of heat (nothing too much) to round off things and add to the complexity."

"This is a champion of a stout with nice complexity and superb peripherals."
"D - My kind of stout. Huge though. Couldn't have too many."

"Overall: on nights that I have this beer I fall asleep dreaming about the madness this beer would bring if it was barrel aged and distributed - this is a stout to be reckoned with and as long as they keep making this I will keep hunting for it ."

""
""
"There are so many things going on with this beer. The notion of combining so many ingredients is not always ideal, but the kitchen sink approach actually works here. This is nicely complex and definitely memorable."
"Perhaps a hyper fresh bottle would help, but this really came across as a coffee and cocoa bomb. There's a ton going on, but it just never really pulled itself together. Tasty, but not blowing any minds."

"Overall this brew is worth the hype. Very well done with great complexity and flavors. (4.25)"

"There is a lot to like here. I usually can't stand chilies in beer, and think it is a gimmicky fad right now. Here, thankfully that is almost an afterthought. I am also so impressed with the silky smooth body and so easy to drink. Most stouts of this weight are completely overbearing. If there was one Prairie beer I thought would be over rated, it is this. Though, typical Prairie makes another excellent offering."

"Will definitely be seeking this and pirate bomb out again"

"O-A rarity, and understandably so. Although Prairie obviously wants to stand out with more Farmhouse flavors, it's clear they had fun with and tweaked this recipe to near perfection. Balanced and beautiful. A must try if you can get your hands on it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer really lived up to the hype for me. Balanced, delicious, all with an appropriate amount of heat. It brought out the best in a stout and in a chili stout. I can't imagine that barrel aging this beer will improve it. 4.5"
"This is a perfect beer. You can drink it know or drink it later. I can't find a flaw at all in this beer. It was made for my mouth. Huge nose, taste, mouthfeel. Just a great stout. Chocolate flavors that kill the palate in a good way. But also so smooth. You don't taste any of the alcohol from the high ABV. Prairie nailed it with the Prairie Bomb. I have had nothing bad from Prairie and I think they have a very bright future. I can't wait."
""
""
""
"Actually, if you're reading this review and haven't had it yet, then you shouldn't get your hopes up because it was only brewed once. Why do breweries do that? If this was year-round I would have given them hundreds of dollars by now. Oh well, thanks for the memories!!!"
""
"I suppose the hype on this is well deserved, but don't think that I'd want more than 6oz at a time of this thing. It's delicious, and extremely well made to the point of hiding its true decadence and aggressive character. For its low price per bottle ($10, for what it is), this is something that I could buy regularly if I wanted something easy-drinking and wonderfully flavorful after dinner. To me, it reaches the heights that I like over-the-top imperial stouts to be - any further, however, is definitely pushing it."

"Really impressive and diverse beer, that is going to please any stout fan. Just wish this had a bit more body to it, but it's hard to believe this clocks in at such a high abv to match. KBS killer is a possibility."
"MF - Relatively smooth for all of the ABV, a little creamy, some alcohol but not the ABV bomb you might expect at 14 percent. 4.75"
""
"Jet black pour and a bit browner head vs Mex Cake. Smells of coffee grinds and earthy hay. Not blown away on smell but made up for on mouthfeel and flavor. not sticky but coating and better as it warms. Flavor was slightly nutty, semi bitter with roasted coffee. Really enjoyed as it warmed to room temp"
""
""
"Served from a 12 oz blue waxed bottle,it pours out pitch black and rests in the glass with a thick tan head. Head dissipates to a thin frothy cap with lots of lacing. Lots of roasted coffee, vanilla, and chocolate on the nose with a hint of chili pepper on the back end. Outstanding aroma. Lots of coffee and chocolate on the front of the palate. The chili becomes more prominent as it warmed leaving some tingling at the back of the throat. The back of the palate brings vanilla and roasted malt. Mouthfeel is amazing, velvety smooth and rich, it has a full body with faint carbonation. Overall, this is the finest example of Imperial Stout I've had to date, I'll be seeking out more of this!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, vanilla, cocoa powder, dark chocolate, and very slight chile pepper aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa powder and dark chocolate flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip, but I am not getting any chile heat in the throat. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a fantastic set of aromas and a nice chocolate forward taste."

"This is deserving of all it's praise."

"Was shocked at how good this was. The chilis did not overpower as I was expecting. Can't wait to see how this ages. I am not a coffee drinker but still find this beer amazing."
""
""
"T: Layers upon layers of mouth coating vanilla and chocolate. Mocha and chili round it out with just a hint of a burn from the peppers on the finish. Powdery cocoa, dark chocolate, fudge and some marshmallow. Finish has some light char, earthy pepper notes and just that little hint of heat. Tastes about 5%. I can't believe this is 14. Bravo, Prairie."
""

"O - My first brew from Krebs and I think I'm spoiled already! This beer is excellently crafted with waves of flavor and its spicy, lingering finish draws you back for another sip."

"O. This is a great stout with lots of flavor, but maintains strong RIS characteristics. The booze is well hidden and the red pepper is just right, which is very surprisingly. Putting red pepper in beer seems like a dumpster fire in the making, but they pulled it off. The flagship ale from this wonderful brewery."

"unprecedented and miraculous. turns out bourbon barrels aren't required to make excellent stout!? attention beer advocate, this is a public service announcement! rich and elegant as they come, flavorful as any beer out there, cant taste the booze, its close to perfect. motor oil consistency to this one, thick and syrupy and luscious. the color is like good dark coffee, close to black but still showing brown. patchy airy lazy caramel colored head appears. nose is huge, tons of roasty chocolate malt, plenty sweet, fresh and well toasted. the cocoa nibs add a lot aromatically speaking. they give it a buttery vibe and an earthy quality, while the contribution of the vanilla beans in obvious. the chilies are no robust in the nose. the first sip floors me, the texture if this beer is perfect. its so smooth, so soft, so delicate. its abv is impossible to guess, and it finishes long and warm. lots of milk chocolate flavors, and the chili is there just a little. like those good dark chocolate bars with pepper in them, this has that level of refinement as well. vanilla is sweet and dense, but not like the bourbon beers, its less caustic, less charcoal, and even more smoothed out. I cant say enough about this really. its beer drinkers beer, just wish it was more readily available. expect this stuff to blow up to whale status before long, its that good."

"but would drink again if given the opportunity just would proabably not purchase"
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yep!"
""
""
"Overall- I've had this twice now, the first time was more vanilla forward but this bottle seemed a little chili heavy. Both were very good and this is an excellent beer overall. Made a perfectly timed trip to Oklahoma and scored 3 bottles, hopefully Ill be able to pick up a couple more in the future."
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
""
""
""
"In retrospect, this needs some time for my palate. The wonderful nose promises that as the chile dies back, there are going to be lovely complexities to the taste. Right now? Close to a one-note Charlie. Still good, but is going to be great (I think) in 6-12 months."
"Oh my God....I had my wife taste & smell this beer just to confirm what I had experienced. She says she smells, coffee, chocolate and green olives...and tastes all three...I agree with all but the olives....mouth feel is full and chewy....my new all time favorite Imperial Stout...nothing else even come close."
""
""
""
"Verdict: A really fine stout from Prairie and one that uses all the adjuncts well. The vanilla could probably stand out a bit more, but honestly, there is enough going on in this beer to satisfy. The alcohol is hidden perfectly and the balance is quite nice, a definite success."
""
"O - Overall this is a winner! Best spiced stout I've had to date. Prairie really did a nice job with this one. My hat is off to them!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is probably the best stout to come out of the state of Oklahoma! I cant wait to try Pirate bomb! Really take your time with this beer and just sip on it. It is a stout worthy of savoring. I thought that this would be just like CBB Huna, but it seems to have something different about it that I cant put my finger on what it is. Almost all the same ingredients as Huna, but a little bit of a different animal than Huna because it not brewed with cinnamon. I was going to call this ""Huna from the Prairie"" in my review, but I am not sure that is what this beer is... Its got it own identity."
"Woooweee. One deliciously complex, and well-integrated imperial stout. Not too sweet, not too spicy, and definitely not too boozy (in the external sense, at least), rather, a deft blend of all these things, so much so, that this drinks like a regular, if still coffee and chili infused, dry stout. That said, I did my best to slow down and enjoy this, for I won't be able to get my hands on another bottle anytime soon, and of course, the more obvious reason - the 28-proof alcohol. Again, wow."

"O - An amazing beer and worthy of the score, no hype."
""
""
""
""
"O: Great beer, was a little worried about the chili as I don't like spicy things but it was a nice compliment to the other flavors. You do notice the chili a little more once the beer warms. We'll see how this does with some barrel aging, hopefully I get my hands on Pirate Bomb."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I rated Pirate lower, this beer and Huna are the king of spiced stouts IMO. Abraxas and Mexican cake are under them IMO."
""
"O: Thicken the body and you’ve got a KBS killer on your hands. However, a thin texture, coupled with the thinning flavors of metal and spice, make for a flawed beer. Apart from that, though, this beer is excellent: you can tell that it was expertly crafted by brewers who have experience making quality products. Needless to say, I’m excited to see what else Prairie brings to town."
""
"O: Nice flavors and well crafted. The most noticeable deficiency is the thinness of the body. A little more heft would really support the flavors better."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Delicious stout, can't wait to have my other bottle with a friend."
""
""
"O-This is a fantastic beer; one of my favorites of any style. The layering of vanilla, cocoa, coffee, and chile could turn into a train-wreck, but it works well here because all of the flavors are inserted with restraint. Each component mixes and compliments the other components, rather than competing with them. Awesome beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"honestly, i now get the hype. this is a fantastic beer. my first from prairie, and i'm glad i have another bottle to enjoy later on. this one was fresh (the blue wax), and i have a yellow wax to age. can't wait to see how this turns out."
""
"2015: Had a full glass recently, it was ok but not a big fan. Short answer is a by the numbers adjunct stout. Vanilla, chocolate, and coffee gets a little tired of it's not unique. The chilies add a twist and some heat but the overall package is lacking. Thin bodied, it was a one and done. Spaghetti Western was a much better follow up, it had the requisite dry bitterness to balance."
"O: a wonderful beer that has a few things going on, but it's gravy on top of a solid imperial stout. I am enjoying this style more and more, thanks to beers like this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall I enjoyed this a lot! It didn't blow my mind like some hype may have made me expect, but I'd drink this a lot if it were available in NJ."

"Pours a rich opaque black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly settles to a thin cap, leaving ample lacing. Huge aroma of roasted coffee beans, sweet vanilla, big rich chocolate and a faint hint of chili pepper spice. Taste has loads of coffee and chocolate up front. The chili pepper became more pronounced as it warmed and left some minor tingling down the throat. Vanilla notes came on the back of the palate with some roasted malts through the finish. Full body with upper medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is chewy, sticky, and thick."

"O: Fantastic beer. One of my new all time favorites."

"O: This beer is fantastic. It is really a good 45 minute to an hour long beer. Fun to sip and notice the changing flavors. Will age a few to see if they continue to open up, but it is imminently drinkable at present."

""
""
""
""
""

"Honestly, I just sipped on Hunahpu this weekend and this might be drinking better at this time. The pepper here is less vegetable and more heat and everything is just working well together.

"O - great beer. A bit heavy on the pepper which does effect the overall balance/complexity factor. But i love chili peppers so i thought it was quite well done."
""
"O - An outstanding double stout. It is stupefying that this beer is 14%; it drinks like it's 4%."
""
"Not going to lie, I had relatively low expectations for Bomb compared to the others of its style. Perhaps because its brewed in Oklahoma. This is basically Ballast Point Victory At Sea with a ton of peppery spiciness and a better mouthfeel. Prairie is one of these breweries that is going to be a serious player in the craft beer world from here on. Bomb, Hop, 'Merica- everything I've had from them so far indicates an excellent attention to detail and high quality... unlike the Oklahoma Sooners. Sorry guys, your beer is just that good."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I enjoyed this brew very much. The chili is present, not overwhelming, but just right. Could use a little more cocoa nib presence. A BA version would be interesting. Oh, and the 14% alcohol? This has 14%? You gotta be kidding me. I don't taste it at all!! I did feel it though... haha"
""
""
""
"Edit: Initial review was on the red wax. After drinking the pink wax In had to increase a couple categories as it was even a better beer. Wow. Thicker mouthfeel and just bolder all around. Bigger nose and tastes all without one aspect overpowering. Just amazing!"
""
""
"This beer is just like it's name. A bomb! Poured from a bottle into a snifter. You will want to share this beer with some friends. Pours a jet black with a nice head with lots of aromas. Cinnamon, vanilla, the works. You can def taste the alcohol. It has an awesome bite and even better going down. It is very heavy and thick. I would def recommend this beer to anyone who likes big stouts!"
"Pours a pitch black, motor oil color, with a medium mocha colored head. Scent is chili- forward at the beginning. The spicy chilies come through up front with bittersweet chocolate and espresso. A hint of oak, but so much more cocoa and more chili than I expected. I bit of paprika and some cocoa. Taste is dark chocolate up front. It quickly turns to rich chocolate fudge and dark chocolate. The chili peppers come through quickly after and balance out the rich chocolate. This beer tastes like chocolate cake with chocolate frosting, with jalapeno sprinkles on it. So damn tasty! Drinkability is scary high. Overall, possibly the best chili stout I've ever had. The high ABV is well-masked. Such a unique and special beer that I'm happy I have more of."
"O - Outstanding! I came into to this with high hopes and a bit of skepticism. Everybody is coming out with their version of the cocoa, coffee, vanilla, chili (and usually cinnamon) imperial stout...always sounds outstanding, but the execution of these stouts have been hit or miss to me. I was finding it a little hard to believe that this could be as good as people have been saying. In actuality, I think it might be even better than people are saying. Tons of flavor - lot of nuance. Everything seems to work together quite well, even with so much going on. I wasn't particularly impressed by the appearance, but everything else was outstanding. This is a super imperial stout. Definitely will be looking for more of this."
""
""
""
"O: A beer with so much potential but didn't quite reach it. No sign of vanilla and barely any sign of the chili peppers. This is basically a big and wonderful coffee stout with a little chocolate to back it up. If I didn't know it had vanilla and chili beans I doubt I ever would have picked it up. The coffee pretty much dominates the whole brew BUT it is delicious coffee so how can I really complain? I had just hyped it up as more, if I'm honest. One of the times where hypes detracts from the experience, unfortunately. Don't get me wrong, fantastic coffee stout regardless. With just a litttle bit of heat. Super easy drinking for 14% with no sign of booze."
""
""
"O - I didn't do much to acquire this bottle, so it had nowhere to go but up. I realize it's one of those 'it' attainable beers right now, but it pretty much lives up to the hype. I see the comparisons to Huna, and they're warranted. Huna may have this slightly beat, however. That said, Bomb! is really good shit and brings the coffee flavors to the table. I'm pleased with the complexity and drinkability and wouldn't for the life of me, if I hadn't known, guess this was a 14% beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This bomb has lots of flavor, especially coffee flavor, and it combines that with a nice heavy body. The alcohol is amazingly hidden. From the smell, I was hoping for a little more chocolate, vanilla and pepper in the flavor but it is still very nice, especially if you are a coffee lover."
"Appearance is pitch black with brown head, lots of lacing and a collar of head left behind. Nose is vanilla forward paired with strong espresso and cacao. Smells bold and rich, not much pepper in the nose. Taste is smooth with heavy coffee and roast followed by a strong presence of vanilla which mellows the intensity of the roast. Right at the finish is when some heat begins and puts an exclamation on all the flavor. Delicious. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth wih mild carbonation. Overall, this draft version blows the bottled version I recently had out of the water. The bottle seemed thin, earthy, and forgettable whereas this glass pops with delicious flavors."
""
""
"The beer is near black with a dense beige head. The aroma is silly good. Vanilla, chocolate, chiles, oak, roast, coffee beans. Seriously, this is amazing. What a complex and delicious beer. 14% abv hidden gracefully. There is so much going on in this beer that one gets new flavors with every sip. Aftertaste lingers for several minutes. I'm in awe. My absolute highest recommendation."
"O - My new favorite Stout. Sets the bar for all future stouts that I taste. Not enough to make other good stouts seem bad in comparison - just at the top of the game. I can't wait to find more of this in San Francisco. Big shout out to Øl in Walnut Creek for having this wonderful beer on tap."

"O - Overall, this beer has been getting a TON of attention. I was very skeptical, but man oh man is this good. Its damn good, and that's without tossing this in a bourbon barrel! The faint (for me at least) lingering smoky ancho chili heat and vanilla wins this one for me. Very, very well done."
""

"This is my first review so please be patient with me. What an amazing beer! Wasn't sure what to think of it based on the name but my friend recommended it and I was not disappointed. It pours like a dark syrup with very little foam. The best way for me to describe this is like drinking a tootsie roll. It has the sweet chocolate flavor while providing a small hint of coffee. As the beer warms, the chili flavor comes through and sits on your tongue. Overall, one of my top 5 beers."
"You know you're conflicted when you want to drop this bottle (due to the name), but you also know that doing so would waste a potentially great beer. ... Anyway, this stuff pours a very dark black-brown topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises dark and lightly-acrid coffee, vanilla bean, light oak, and a good helping of earthy greens. The taste holds notes of earthy coffee, roasted malts, and light dark chocolate powder. The body is a hefty-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, I don't get the love professed for this beer. It's fairly boring in terms of spiced-stout characteristics, and the peppers are really nowhere to be seen (save in adding some green earthiness to the proceedings). No real complexity is to be found. Nothing about this beer brings much in the way of comparisons to Hunahpu (which I'm not even the biggest fanboy of) and its ilk. I mean, it's not a bad beer, in all honesty, but it's nowhere near as good as I've been hearing. I just don't get it..."
""
""
""
"Not exactly sure how this beer is getting the hype it's pulling. I found it to be very simplistic and Dirty. Coincidentally I had this right after East End Coffee Porter and while East Ends beer wasn't overly impressive neither was the Prairie. Comparisons to Hunaphu's is unjust."
"This beer is pretty awesome. I must admit. Very great flavor, not as thick. I would say that's its only downfall. But for the abv, you can't tell this beer is above 7. I'm a huge stout fan and this beer is in my top 5. Awesome beer I hope to enjoy more in the future."

"Overall: Solid Imperial Stout here that I loved, definitely worth getting your hands on"
"Overall: quite drinkable for the ABV, it was rather hidden. Wonderful coffee stout worth seeking out."

"Prairie has absolutely knocked this one out of the park. Each sip delivers a new flavor, a new experience, and new complexion to the beer. I'm happy to see it being considered in the upper echelon of stouts because it rightfully belongs there."

"D - This is awesome stuff. Looking forward to grabbing a few bottles as well as the inevitable barrel-aged version(s). Really impressed and totally up my alley in the chile-stout flavor balance. Might be tough for me to drink mass quantities, but I'd love to try."

"Pours black, effervescent carbonation begins its work whipping up a frothy dense cap about 1"" thick; reminds me of a soy latte poured into a pint glass. Smell is mild coffee, slight pepper, anise, and the darkest chocolate one can find in the store, I'm talking 90%+ cacao. Taste is coffee and chocolate, with a warming pepper burn at the back; the black roast lends a tannic quality that balances what sweetness would be expected from a 14% stout. Man, that pepper burn is sticking- I don't think it is alcohol, this is a lingering, smoldering salsa type burn. The dark chocolate is truly prominent in the flavor profile on this. Mouthfeel is thick without being cloying, the carbonation is fine and works to make this beast more quaffable. I approve of this beer."

"O: Great beer. Too rich and strong for pre-noon drinking, but heavily recommended."

"O - I was stoked when I saw this on the shelf at my favorite neighborhood beer store. I had never seen it before and jumped at the chance to try it. I am so glad I did. I very rarely give otu a 5 in a category, but it is hard for me to imagine a finer smelling beer. The flavor does not disappoint with a powerful blend of chocolate and vanilla bean with mild pepper heat. It's hard for me to believe this beer is 14% because it was gone before I knew it. I appreciate the 12 oz. size as well. Grab this beer if you see it. Among the best stouts, no...beers, I have ever had."
"Bottle thanks to the trade master, Dak. Pours a deep black with small dark brown head in my Hunapuh glass. Aroma is big bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, bitter coffee, and big time peppers. Much more pepper presence than Hunapuh here. Smells rich and creamy until the pepper bite comes through. Silky mouthfeel with lowish carbonation. Super huge chocolate here with a perfect bite from the pepper that blends seamlessly with the earthy coffee. Decedent for sure. Not sure where the vanilla comes into the flavor but it doesn't matter. It is good anyway. No trace of the huge ABV on this one. A great dessert tonight after my steak."

"This beer not only lived up to its hype and expectations but exceeded it in some areas for me. This drinks nothing like 14% ABV. Dangerously drinkable and amazingly delicious. I'm seeking out more right now."

"Prairie Bomb pours a midnight black in color with maybe a quarter inch of dark mocha lacing. The pour was a little light in body for an imperial stout, especially for a beer of 14%. The nose features a healthy dose of cocoa, coffee, and vanilla yet they all team together to provide a soft and delicate dessert of a nose. The pepper is subtle. The flavors are smooth and chocolaty with a nice level of vanilla. The coffee is present but takes a backseat. The pepper is present more in the aftertaste than anywhere else and it does have the ability to linger for a few minutes, which is welcome. It's a nice amount of pepper. There could be more but it does possess more spice than most. It drinks light for the style and really doesn't give any indication of being 14%. This is an impressive beer, especially for the price. I'd compare it to a lighter version of Hunahpu, but with coffee."

"O: An superb brew that if you like the more malty dark spectrum of beers I will encourage you to try. All notes are balanced and the beer is heavy but not like cutting butter. At 14% and no detection this is a desert beer. An excellent choice that I encourage you to buy."

" O - What a wonderful beer. I had thought that Mexican Cake was about as good as it could get with a non-BA stout for me, but this beer has it all. The flavors are blended with skill, it is not boozy for the ABV, and the heat is toned down here, the chili is there just to tie everything else in. Superb."
""
"Aromas of marsh mellow, coffee and mole. Flavor is awesome, tons of chocolate with coffee and some ancho in the end. Mouth feel of this beer is perfect for a 14% stout, so creamy and you would never know it's that high in ABV. Home run here."

"Prairie Bomb is a hot, in-yer-face mess that you can't let go of no matter how wild she gets."
""
"Pours black with a relatively dark brown head. Little to no lacing. Not much in the way of head retention but it's easy to kick up more foam. The aroma is big on vanilla, chocolate and coffee. More of the chili comes out as the beer warms. Fairly sweet aroma but nothing comes across artificially. The taste starts out with a bunch of vanilla and chocolate. Coffee and roast come right behind. Rather sweet but there's enough flavor bouncing around that it doesn't dominate. Mild but noticeable chili burn in the finish. It adds a welcome layer of complexity to the beer. Things would probably get a bit too sweet without that little burn. Nice thick mouthfeel. Very smooth and full. This is an excellent imperial stout. There's lots of flavor and it all plays well together. Great work from Prairie."
"O- add this to my Always Want list. It really is top notch. I was disappointed in the 2013 Hunahpu's that I had, because it lacked any measurable heat or spice flavor to my palate. Prairie Bomb does not suffer the same problem. This had high expectations based upon the buzz and reviews, and it surpassed all hope."

"O: Outstanding work from Prairie. This is the real deal and I'm so glad I've got a three left from the trade. The booze is extremely well hidden and the mouthfeel is spot on for the style. Will have again soon."

"Overall - Impressive. Great flavors and enough of a stout to stand up to them. Bourbon barrel please? Yumm."
""

"This is incredibily smooth & drinkable for such a complex beer. Deft use of chillles really sets this apart from the crowd. Easily my favorite big beer from Prairie, so far... Wanted to wring the bottle out to get every drop. I would love to see a barrel aged version of this, but pretty awesome in its own right"
""
""
"Overall: There is quite a bit of hype surrounding this beer even though it was released for the first time so recently and is already out in most places. And every bit of that hype is warrented. One of my absolute favorites to date (thank God I have 5 more!)"
""
""
""
"It has a nice coffee/chocolate smell.. The flavor of the coffee/chocolate flows all the way through the beer down to the last sip. The vanilla and chile are slight at the end to give it a rounded finish. Ageing this beer will just melt everything together and develop a rich full flavor that I can hardly wait to taste..."

"Chukar cherries in Washington state makes Dark Chocolate Chipotle Cherries that are stupid good. This beer is those cherries crossed with a Vanilla Coke.(except all artisanal or whatever)"

"This beer is exactly as described on the label. Each flavor is apparent in every sip which really makes the beer taste superb. I was skeptical about the chili pepper but turned out I really enjoyed the chili pepper hint in each sip. Very full flavor with a great look and feel. Highly recommend!!"
"This is by far Okla's best beer to date. The coffee flavor is apparent up front but not overpowering. Then the vanilla takes over to smooth it out , ending with a very slight spice (which is not spicy, but you can tell it was aged with chili peppers). I couldn't believe how well they hid 14% abv. This is one of the most impressive beers I've ever had. The only down side to this beer is the fact that it's a one time brew."
""
"Overall - This is an extremely solid stout, and is the best PAA beer I've had to date (which is saying a lot). It's incredibly smooth and flavorful, and really hides its 14% ABV. With so much going on, beers like this risk being unbalanced. However, here, the flavors all complement one another and all are expressed adequately. I can't wait to see how this ages."

"I-as good as it gets for adjunct coffee stouts. Unbelievable..."
