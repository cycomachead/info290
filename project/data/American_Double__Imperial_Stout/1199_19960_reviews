"Absolutely stellar. Full bodied and a finish that you wish would never end. World class for sure."
""
"Second year in a row that it didn't live up to the hype for me... nice body and creamy feel with burnt chocolate and some coffee flavors... but lacks complexity and bourbon sweetness--- much prefer bcbs as my staple stout."
"Overall - Worth the hype"
"2015 release, only sat for 3-4 weeks"
""
"Overall this brew goes up a notch or two compared to FBS.  The barrels used lend a nice easy touch which is appreciated.  Epic brew, I understand why the craft beer geeks chase this down after enjoying it today!"
""
""
"Just awesome!! Lucky enough to find it on tap@ Penning's Warwick NY"
"This lived up to the expectation!"
"Simply put, awesomeness in a bottle!!"

"Rating is for 2015.  Seems lighter ten previous years.  Not the motor oil as I expected.  Usually get it in draft though."
"Been waiting to try this beer for over a year. I am not really a stout fan. This beer is deserving of a 5 rating. It's everything I was hoping it would be."
"A nice experience. Vey much recommend."
""
"Just an exceptional barrel aged stout. Hides the heat of 11.20 abv very well and all the flavors of breakfast stout shine through the barrel aged flavor. Love it!"
""
""
"I am aging three bottles from this year  and will update with a review at 6 months, followed by a side-by-side comparison to next year's version."
""

"Nice rounded bourbon  taste through the mouth. Very apparent bourbon  presents. Finished  Carmely"
""
""
"2015 lacked the mouth feel of 2014 . What happened? It is till in class of  stouts by itself other than  Founders Russian Imperial Stout which I feel is better."
""
""
"April 2015 / 12oz Bottle. Got a really strong bourbon taste and smell, but a bit underwhelmed by the beer, coffee and vanilla notes which was described. Decent mouth feel, but slightly muddled flavor. Might have been over excited for this one."
"Cream of the crop in 2015..."

"If there is a God, he created this beer."
""
"Thick, big, and beautiful - this beer is everything you've heard about and more."
""
"Fantastically strong stout. Very strong bourbon taste."
""
"Just had it on draft, came home and had a bottle.  Bottled, this year, is way better than on tap.  Everything would have been about .5 lower if rating the draft.  Coffee was way more forward on tap.  This bottle is fantastic and a perfect balance of the coffee, chocolate, and bourbon.  Wish I had more."
""
"Certainly no bcbs... Was definitely hoping for more with all the hype this receives"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Wow. This is my first crack at this beer and I must say it was worth the wait. It's so rich and complex with flavors popping in sync through the duration of the ride. The coffee is fantastic and I really enjoy the huge bright vanilla/bourbon mix that jumps out. Is it the best BA beer I've had? No that probably still goes to Bourbon County Coffee but this deserves the praise and is one outstanding world class brew."
""
""
"I've had this beer many times- finally getting around to making some comments. Hype train is huge with this one- for many it might be their first BA coffee Stout. The coffee character is bitter and peppery, and the whiskey character is a bit harsh. Bourbon beers and coffee Stouts have come a long way since this beer first made the scene. Can't compete with the likes of BA Speedway or CBS for that matter."
"This was my first KBS.  Poured into snifter, jet black, small head that dissipates quick, strong lacing throughout.  Heavy bourbon in the nose.  Taste was more mild than expected after smelling, at least with the bourbon.  It was present for sure in a big way, imparting a smooth, almost vanilla-like taste.  I didn't get the roasty, coffee presence FBS brings and I was actually glad for that.  This was a sipper but a very smooth one.  Very much enjoyed my first KBS."
""
""
""
""
"Syrup taste makes each drink more enjoyable.  Bright Tasting stout that could make or break your day."
""
"O - 5 - There are very few beers in the world that I have taken my first sip of and was left just simply smiling and speechless for a minute. Not to get poetic in my review but, it was everything I had hoped it was in my mind and, for me, completely lives up to its hype. This is the IDEAL, perfectly balanced bourbon barrel imperial stout, and you'd be hard pressed to find one better."
""
""
""
""
""
"I waited an hour in line for two bottles! hype hype. what more could you want chocolate, coffee, bourbon,and  tobacco  flavors come out. thought it tasted best at 55 F"
""
"The strong oak taste opens with notes of chocolate and coffee follow. The after taste brings the bourbon characteristics along with some tobacco and leather."
""
""
""
"Solid brew once again, prefer 15 over 14. Good barrel flavor. Pour into snifter, need to let this brew come up in temp."
""
""
"Tried this for the first time yesterday; loved it!"
""
""
"The only reason I'm docking some PTs is because I sampled this head to head with CBS. Otherwise it's perfection."
""
"Thanks to Kyle for sharing this during the NCAA finals. Pours a dark brown with small, brown head. Aroma is chocolate, coffee, coconut, booze. Taste follows the aroma. It has a bitter finish and a distinct alcohol burn. Thin mouth feel. Decent beer, but not worth the trouble to seek it out for one bottle limits."
""
""
""
""
""
"Love the depth Of this beer"
""
""
""
"Overall, great beer."
""
""
"$22 for a 4 pack. Good stout with a big kick. Poured a deep brown with a nice head. Whiskey aging was not overpowering like other examples."
""
""
"I absolutely love this stout. It's like drinking a chocolate/coffee/vanilla milkshake with a shot of sweet sweet bourbon in it. Absolutely fantastic and well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Edit: I have recently had a beer with the most phenomenal feel I have ever had and therefore feel the need to knock the feel portion of this review down.  Still my favorite beer so far though."
"O: This is an excellent beer, i'm glad to have finally tried it…it's a perfect 5 to me…the first beer i've ever given such a high mark!! Kudos to you Founders!!"
""
""
""
"Overall: An excellent brew, but not worth the effort to obtain.  Certainly world class and worth the places at the top of the lists, but not worth the hunt for me."
"Simply amazing... I don't think words can describe this stout so I'm not going to try."
""
""
""
"This is so good I will need to check my notes of other brews to make sure I did not over-rate it. I will look very soon to see if there is any more at the store. Awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely love how beautifully the bourbon melds all the flavors together. Best stout of my young drinking career!"
"Honestly, this beer is overhyped and shouldn't garner the high score it currently has with BA but it could just be that this years batch (2015) just isn't as good as the original version. Tasty but not one I would spend time searching high and low for again."
""
"It really is as good as it gets folks. If you can manage to land it, get it. It's fantastically made. Bourbon, tobacco, chocolate, coffee... it finishes with some vanilla bourbony notes that play well with all the other flavors. You really have to taste it to believe. It's one of the highly acclaimed beers that truly lives up to its reputation."
""
""
""
""
""
"2015, on tap and in bottle are both amazing (No hype required). I won't compare it to the other bourbon aged beers because it has its own unique way of doing things. To me the bourbon is present but it is more subtle and doesn't overwhelm the other flavors of chocolate and coffee.  I do love the bourbon heavy beers as well, but KBS is much smoother and refined imo. Had a chance to meet Jeremy K. The brew master at a local seminar and local tapping. Smaller town in MN and was not crowded at all.  Very laid back and humble about all his beers. I haven't rated a lot of good beers that I should have. I would say, don't pick a favorite. Also just because it's new and super rare and you got some, doesn't make it better or worse than those who have been perfecting their style and can make more of it. Beer isn't a hipster fashion trend it's been around a long time and will be for a long time."

"Overall a well rounded imperial stout that masks the high abv well. Thin for an imperial/breakfast stout. Bourbon really comes through."
""
""
""
"Been waiting to try this for quite awhile.  Poured into snifter.  Perfect black, opaque color.  Perfect head and lacing.  The smell is predominately coffee and chocolate.  Can smell the bourbon but it isn't overpowering.  More highly carbonated than I expected.  As to the taste, I expected more bourbon. It's an incredibly smooth blend of coffee, chocolate, and toffee with a somewhat bitter finish.  It's also a lighter mouthfeel than I expected.  Overall, this is a very fine stout but I can't justify the hype.  I actually like Founders Imperial Stout better but that isn't a criticism of KBS.  Perhaps my expectations were not reasonable given the difficulty in finding this stout.  I'm going to age a couple of bottles and I might change this rating based upon the results."
""
""
""
""
"Btw.  I love Founders Breakfast Stout to the point that I currently have a 1/4 barrel on tap at my house.  This is a very different beer.  Not just bourbon version.  Lighter body but even more complex flavor profile."
""
"Drinkability: Wish that I had enough of these to assess drinkability but happy to finally try this fine beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Still and excellent brew and worth waiting in line for."
""
"Tasty but a lot of work to get a little bit."
""
""
""
"Very good but it doesn't live up to the hype around it."
"O: this years was the absolute best I've ever had. I have never really liked this beer because of the explosive heat from the bourbon and the watery mouthfeel. This year was a complete 180 it was just fantastic. I was very surprised how soft the barrel characteristics were this year, it really complimented a great beer versus taking over the entire taste."
"All i tasted was rich chocolate and bourbon.  Never had this until now, I will seek it out every year.  Soooo good!"
""
""
""
"2015.  Marked improvement over 2014.  Big coffee punch, blast of hot bourbon booze.  Roasty chocolate.   A few months will probably do this bad boy some favors, but a nice return to form."
""
""
"Boozy smell up front but overall creamy goodness."
""
"Interesting beer. Some bourbon barrel stouts make you forget that you're drinking a beer and force you to drink this lighter body bourbon with less burn (BCBS), and that's fine and all, but it isn't a beer. I'm drinking '15 KBS and I'm hit with the coffee up front, then it fades to sweet chocolate and vanilla notes at the end. It isn't as nearly as boozy as BCBS (though doesn't have as high alcohol % either). As per which is a better ""beer," 2014 BCBS or 2015 KBS, I'd say the KBS. I'm excited to try both with some age on them!"
"Feel: A bit light. wish this had the feel of yeti"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The nose on this beer is incredible, bourbon, brown sugar, maple syrup, coffee, chocolate and oak.  Bourbon forward on the palate, but well integrated, lots of wood as well, cocoa nibs, roasted coffee, plum, dark fruits, oily with a dry tannic finish, alcohol is incredibly well hidden.  Really enjoy this beer and see why it is so highly regarded, if I had to nitpick I really would have liked the mouthfeel to be fuller, it was a bit thin."
""
""
""
""
""
"Surprisingly light on the palate.  I thought it would be cloying but this is a very easy drinking beer.  I can see why it is rated so highly."
""
"Our first go at KBS.  Got  2 bottles and with a heroic effort of pure willpower, one bottle will be aged for a (short) vertical tasting in '16."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Did a side-by-side tasting of the 2014 and 2015 at Timmy O'Tooles in Chicago (couldn't believe my luck that their kegs lasted until I got there a couple days after the release). I liked the 2015 better--super chocolaty with a nice bitter kick at the end. The 2014 was a lot smoother, but I like the 2015's kick. Lovely beer overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As much as I enjoy Backwoods, the booze is a little too forward for my tastes. Founders gets the combination just right, however, in KBS. As it warms, the bourbon takes a more prominent places in smell and taste but never overpowers the delicious chocolate and coffee. Worth the hype, effort to find, and money to buy."
"Overall – Is it worth the hype? No. Is it amazing? Yes. For a beginner BA drinker, this is the way to go. The dirty tobacco taste is almost completely lost from Breakfast Stout in the aging, but is there in the after taste. CBS is definitely better."
""
""
""
"When I manage to convince the guy at the beer store that I am worthy, and he comes out of the back room with the KBS, I am very thankful.  I thank him completely and unabashedly in the hope that he will find me worthy the next time.  What a system.  I'm not that this is how beer, or the free market,  is supposed to work."
""
""
""
"5/5 all day long. One of the best stouts out there for Bourbon barrel aged!"
""
""
""
"Poured a bottle of the 2015 into a snifter. This is a creamy, medium-bodied stout with a very nice bourbon touch mixed with an equally nice cocoa taste. Interestingly, I find Founders' imperial stout stronger bodied, and I agree with a past comment that the Epic BIg Bad Baptiste is remarkably similar in feel and taste, without the struggle to attain. Still, it's a good stout."
""
""
""
"O- Overall, by far the best bourbon aged beer I have ever had. The only word that describes it is wonderful. I have had BCBS from Goose Island, and everyone raves about that, but in my opinion, this is far better. BCBS is too heavy on the bourbon. This allows the bourbon to come through just enough to give it some oaky vanilla/bourbon accent that really enhances the experience. Well done Founders. If only this was easier to find."
""
"Unlike anything I've ever had.  It's super rich with heavy coffee and chocolate flavor.  Honestly, I don't detect ""bourbon"" or ""barrel-aged"" as much as I expected - it's there, but a distant back-seat to chocolate and coffee.  Nevertheless, grab every bottle you can get yours hands on...its rare and very tasty."
"It looks like a typical stout but everything else is not typical.  Great bourbon, vanilla nose.  Warming bourbon taste without overpowering the chocolate, coffee vanilla, coconut flavors.  Nice carbonation - not a fan of stouts that are almost flat and this one has mild, but lively carbonation.  This beer has converted me to bourbon barrel aged stouts!  The bourbon component in the nose and taste is so well done compared to others I have tried.  Fantastic!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good BA stout... But, I still don't get the hype.  Compared to the class of it's genre: BCBS, Parabola, even something like Big Bad Baptist (much easier to get)... This just doesn't make the cut.  Flavors are all there ok... It's FBS with a faint oaky bourbon on the finish.  The mouthfeel is what really hurts this beer.  It's very thin... I love the thick oily mouthfeel of some of the great BA Stouts out there.  A good BA stout overall.  One I would go pick up and drink from time to time.  But, not worth 24+ a 4 pack and not worth standing in line for."

"2015: pretty boozy, good chocolate and coffee flavor! definitely more chocolate than last years"
""
""
"Just had my first today...Best Imperial Stout I've had to date. Super happy I got a case!"
"Overall one of the best tasting beers of 2015 so far."
""
"Great beer, chocolate and coffee up front with vanilla and bourbon in the background. Not at ""meaty""as bcbs but equally as good."
""
"Exceptional.  Best beer I've ever had.  So incredibly smooth...."
"2015 release. Coffee flavored stout with that boozy kick and after taste of vanilla bourbon as it goes down your throat. This year did not disappoint at all and i'm already trying hard not to drink the rest in one sitting!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall. An Excellent Stout, one I want to savor after dinner. It's smoothness makes it a great night cap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Silky smooth, the coffee and chocolate flavors dance on the palate perfectly in unison. A nice hit of bourbon at the end."
""
""
""
""
"You certainly get the barrel in the taste, but it isn't over powering.  Excellent beer. Found it to be rather smooth."
""
"Absolutely the best stout ever"
""
""
""
""
"The KBC 14 is aged and more mellow than the 15. More vanillaey. The 15 is sharper and holds more of the bourbon sharpness."
""
""
"2015 release bottled on 3/4/2015. Wow wow"
""
""
"Great Beer, pours dark black and finishes smoothly"
""
""
""
""

"Great brew. Fresh you can really taste the barrel but if you'll wait it out and let a few age they are better with time. Very enjoyable!"

"best Bourbon Barrel stout I've ever had"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Excellent bourbon stout. Big founders stout fan. Better than last years. With that said it is still not as well rounded or as complex, bourbon rich as BCBS. Just way over hyped under produced bourbon stout by founders."
"O:  had for the first time this time last year.  I remembered it being one of the greatest stouts I've ever had, which I still think it is today.  One OF the greatest indeed.  I too firmly believe goose island nails this particular style.  Let's see what age does to her.  Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Recommendation: No matter what, everyone needs to try this beer. It's a classic and is the face of Founder's. Find it, drink it, love it. Just don't expect to get your face blown off."
""
"Overall: Lives up to the hype of being one of the best stouts out there. I love breakfast stout which is much more available, and the availability factor of this one makes it a rare treat, but it was really damn good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very hard to find, even in MI. Goes from $8-15 a bottle from stores. On tap in very select locations. I paid $10 for a 10oz draft."
""
""
""
""
""
"2014 - 12oz bottle into snifter - Was hoping for more from this one. Still a great BA Stout and had lots of coffee / cocoa on the nose and in the taste. Barrel was there but didn't highlight the other flavors. Improved as it warmed."
"Well it's official. KBS is the greatest beer of all time, ALL TIME. It's like breakfast stout and dragons milk had freaky circus sex. Nine months later had a kid. Then that kid spent a year in a cave learning how to be a ninja and that ninja kicked the s**t out of my taste buds."
"Poured into a 12 oz glass, dark Carmel-chocolate color with very little head.  Taste of coffee and chocolate both are present but neither are over bearing on the palette.  By far one of the best stouts I have had so far !"
""
""
""
""
"Taste had a boozy roast flavor. Burns the throat and leaves a coffee flavor on your tongue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is utter and pure perfection."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ok but not great.  There are better, smoother, and more enjoyable versions of the style out there.  I usually like founders beers but think this one is overhyped"
""

"2015 KBS has a heavy coffee and chocolate flavor. Not as boozy as previous releases. Very enjoyable."
""
"This beer is the 2015, and is fresh and delicious. Strong nose and flavors of coffee and chocolate. The mouth feel is chewy and rough. There is some substance to this beer. The barrel is perfectly balanced with the coffee-chocolate backbone."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Had I heard no hype about this beer going in, I'd have thought it was a solid beer, and would have rated it slightly below an ordinary, unbarreled Breakfast Stout. However, given the hype this beer receives, I'm left with the question of why. It's solid, it's good, and it has been matched and surpassed by many other stouts out there. If you can get it without serious effort or resources, it's worth trying. It's assuredly not worth standing in line for."
""
"Fantastic stout with great bourbon flavor. Definitely going to be on the look out for this one in the future"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This one is as good as advertised. Amazing nose, taste, and mouthfeel. Lots of chocolate and really well balanced."
""
"So if you are lucky enough to grab a bottle, enjoy it now, or at least within the first year."
""
""
""
"T: Dark chocolate coated orange dusted with espresso.  Sweet bourbon mash. The age of the btl has broken down the darker fruits into the ubiquitous port and tannins; the acidity counters the sweetness. Light oak and smoke, cherry cordial.  Hints of clove and nutmeg spice."
"Great beer, changes character as it gets warmer.  Get some."
""
""
"Went back to the hotel and cracked open a bottle and poured into a tulip @ slightly below room temp. It was everything I hoped for. All the reviews say more than I could but suffice to say I have the coveted KBS and will be going into storage for those special occasions."
""
""
""
"Being from Michigan I gave the luxury of getting about 2   bottles each year if I'm lucky. This is last year's release with a year of age. Awesome and worth the effort of hunting this down. Drink slowly and let warm to room temperature to fully appreciate.  Molasses chocolate and vanilla flavor. As good as it gets. Can't wait to get a few bottles next week to replenish for the cellar."
"Let me just say that I hate the after taste of bourbon. This beer starts to give you that aftertaste and then pours on chocolate to mask the bourbon and make it delicious. I'm nervous to say this but KBS is probably the best beer I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Awesome.  I think this is one of the most balanced barrel aged coffee stout I have had to date.  Where some have been to strong in bourbon, coffee, etc, I thought this was the most balanced tasting beer I've had, I hope they eventually increase production.  Only critique would be I don't feel it has full of a mouth feel as the breakfast stout, different beer though."
"O- overall, i always did want to try this but never wanted to spend the time, energy and money to hunt it down in stores... Plus, as I mentioned I'm not a fan of coffee flavor d beers. This being offered at the bar was a perfect scenario for me. The beer was blended extremely well, yet it was so complex. There were so many flavors mixed in and none really stuck out or outshined the other. A very solid BA offering that is ready to drink. I wouldn't age this one. I think it would risk losing some of those great subtleties and undertones. Plus, I think with time some of the other flavors may fade bringing the bolder flavors forward, thus destroying that perfectly balanced liquid harmony that currently exists!!!"

"Found on tap at World of Beer in Tucson, AZ. This review is purely speculation as I was drunk as fuck when I ordered it. Im basing my score on how pumped I was to finally get to try it. Yolo."
""
""
"12oz bottle poured into red solo cup for the short-notice share with Justin and Morgan in FL. Black body with a thin brown head that fades to a wisp and ring. Aroma is as advertised, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, coconut and char from the barrel, solid roast malts. Flavor is excellent as well - sweet coffee and cocoa, moderate coffee and roasty bitterness. Medium-plus body, creamy, thick texture, soft carbonation, boozy bitterness on the finish."
"This bad boy was on tap at Olive or Twist (Baton Rouge, LA) and was absolutely phenomenal.  May not be worth searching far and wide for but definitely one of the best beers I've had."
""
""
""
"One of the best when its available!"

"Good! Nice basic ale. Hint of coffee is very, very faint. Not too heavy."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle.  Pours pitch dark chocolate black.  Little to no head which concerned me.  Not even a finger of head.  I see other reviews speaking of head so I am worried I have a bad bottle.  Let it warm up for 10 minutes before drinking.   You can smell dark roasted malts - almost burnt, strong espresso or dark italian coffee, hint of vanila with a slight aroma of bourbon.  I do smell oak.  It is thick in the mouth much the way it appears.  Medium body though - would have thought it would be heavier.  Tastes are all above with bourbon underlying most of them.  I tasted more dark chocolate and coffee than anything else.  ABV is very well concealed.  However, this beer has been so hyped to me it was doomed to disappoint.  Hoping I just had a bad bottle.  I will try it again.  This particular bottle was above average but nothing outstanding.  No Surly Darkness, 3 Brothers Resolute, etc."
"Was afraid of the hype, but very surprised by how great it tasted, I was only given 6oz but man it was good!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A little mild on flavor. It is creamy and had a thicker feel. Minimal lace. Got 3x as good as it went from cold to warm. Chocolate forward. Good stout. Just not sure if its the best. Going to have to try this again. Better the second time for sure."
""
"This legendary stout is solid. The difference from the non barrel aged counterpart is subtle, which doesn't take the taste overboard like some other barrel aged attempts."

"Can anyone comment on this?"

"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. I was gifted this bottle on my retirement, and I'm very excited to try this legendary stout. Pours pitch black, with the consistancy of 30 weight, with a thin, light brown head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt with a hint of char, drip coffee, hints of vanilla and nuts; no noteable bourbon. Flavor of toasted, charred malt, boiled down coffee, vanilla, bitter chocolate, hints of bourbon and oak. Malty to start, with coffee flavors developing to finish with the more light acidic flavor of coffee and oak. Nice medium to heavy bodied with light creaminess. A well made coffee stout with a good balance between the coffee and malt, with perhaps a bit more coffee than expected, but the fresh coffee flavors have faded in the barrel, which left surprisingly light bourbon flavors. ABV well covered. Glad I got the chance to try this classic."
""
""
""
"Strong black coffee, dark chocolate, moderate bourbon presence."
""
""
"Good, not great. A little too sweet -- the coffee and chocolate are stronger than the bourbon-barrel taste. Founders is incapable of making a bad beer, but considering that this is 11.2% abv, I would go with the Breakfast Stout, which is edgier-tasting and easier on the blood system."
""
"Bit too boozy and hot fresh, but when aged for about 8 months its phenomenal what this beer turns into and how it mellows."

"Draft versus bottle is so different, didnt age the bottle a week but it was much much worse"
"Very good but compared to CBS it is a little weak"

"O: I was not sure what to expect from this beer, it's different from other BA stouts I have tried, the bourbon is not big up front but the other flavors make up for it. It has not a nice coffee, chocolate, vanilla bitter sweet flavor that I think makes this beer unique from other BA stouts, it almost seems as if this Founders Breakfast Stout barrel aged, even though it's not. I think it could use a little more bourbon presence but it's definitely a world class stout. If this was available every Spring in CA, I would definitely buy as much as possible."
""
""

"This beer is damn near perfect, the only regret I have is probably not waiting so long to drink it. It was unbelievably smooth, and I would have liked to feel a little more of a kick. I recommend aging it for only a year."

"Overall- Excellent barrel aged offering, the bourbon is definetly up front but its not overpowering. A real sweetness to this beer from bourbon and creamy vanilla/chocolate rich flavors that is counterbalanced well by bitter elements of roasted malts and coffee. Flavors are bold but smooth and rich, wonderful sipper, warming."

"Pours dark with a very thin head.  Aroma of roasted notes, coffee and vanilla.  The taste is roasted malt and slight sweetness with coffee on the back end.  The alcohol was not overpowering.  Overall I loved this beer."
""
"O:  A good beer, however by no means great.  Would have again if it was offered to me or I had ready access to it, but would not go out of my way to purchase it."
"Very overrated. Very thin mouth feel. Tastes like backwoods bastard. The barrel is definitely the same. Shocked at how high the rating is"
""
"Dark almost black with a small tan head that fades fast and leaves some lacing.  Big oak barrel aroma, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, coffee, toffee and some smoke.  Taste is much like aroma, coffe, chocklate and bourbon up front.  Vanilla, oak and bittersweet chocolate mid palate.  Finish brings a last push of oak barrel and bourbon, smoke and some earthy notes.  Super smooth mouthfeel, finishes dry and carries the bittering flavors perfectly.  This is a remarkable barrel aged stout.  Better as it warms and a touch rough around the edges but big flavors make it forgivable."

"Can't add much that hasn't been said.  2014 vintage, perfectly black, bourbon and chocolate to the nose.

Just fantastic - everything I was expecting!"

"Someone gifted me a bottle of this years release yesterday. Couldn't take it any longer and cracked it open today. Poured like the old oil out of my Toyota. Smells like a dream. Coffee, Chocolate, Bourbon and Vanilla explosion. The coffee takes the front seat on the taste. There is just enough chocolate and bourbon there to compliment things. The alcohol kick is fabulous and changes as the beer warms. I sipped this one as long as I could."

"This is a barrel aged stout, but it acts more like an IPA, it's great when it's fresh, but after a few months, it falls of a cliff.  I've never experienced a BBA Stout that fell off so badly after a few months.  Although it is very tasty fresh, there are better, cheaper, more available options out there."

"2011.  Hard to rate vintage to vintage but this is the best beer I've ever had. Had a 2012 as week and the aroma and the bourbon were not as present. The balance of the malt, hops and bourbon is amazing. Tons of vanilla and oak. Ridiculously good. Glad I saved one. But wish I had saved it ;)"

"Been searching for this beer locally for over 2 years now. Finally found it at a tapping party in KC. The beer was served very cold and was a disappointed. The first taste I was a little disappointed because there was not a much heat or bourbon taste as I expected but as it warmed up I realized that the slight burn of it is was made it so great. No reason to age it. After ordering food and letting it warmed up I realized the great notes of bourbon, vanilla  and coffee.  Overall couldn't be happy and understand the hype of this beer."

"Begins with toffeish malts and a pungent bourbon bite , followed by a gentle wooden note and a supportive coffee infusion, accompanied by smooth, creamy milk chocolate. Vanilla provides a delicate peak to the foundation of the beer, which gets perfectly along with the sweeter, toffeish part of the brew, while also calming the alcohol burn. The coffee falls off soon, as we paired the '14 version next to the '12, developing in a very pleasant way above the sweeter notes, followed by a hint of Bourbon. The older version, while missing the coffee, blends the different flavor directions more carefully, adding many layers, which are related to each other to the taste, also the Bourbon is more recognizable. Finishes with wooden, sweeter malts, still extremely smooth on the palate, while the recent version adds a slick, well integrated coffee bitterness, among a sharp boozy echo."

"In my opinion, KBS is overrated. It tastes entirely like bourbon with no real detectable beer. I like the idea of bourbon-barrel aged beer, but the bourbon flavor should be more subtle and not overpower the beer completely. Don't get me wrong, I'd drink this over and over again from a shot glass. Quite heavy alcohol flavor as well. But for a beer? Nah. The funny thing is, for all the hype, when I admitted to the guy at work that gave me his last one that I didn't care too much for it, he confessed to not caring for it himself. Ditto for a few other beer buddies at work. I'm a huge fan of most of Founders' varieties. Their porters, stouts, IPAs, scotts and pales are all among my favorites. I'll probably try this again, because I'm not one to give up on something after one taste, but for now I'm not a fan."

"Looks is amazing, what a stout should look like.  Smell was subtle bourbon, light roasted coffee and dark chocolate.  Taste was slightly bitter, I didn't get much barrel and slight roastiness from the coffee.  As it warmed it became very creamy, which I like, with a dark chocolate taste coming forward.  This was the 2015 version and I enjoyed it more than 2014."

"Absolutely perfect beer.  There isn't another on the market that can replicate this.  I have tried in homebrewing but can't come close.....but who should expect to get close to such a great brewery?"
"Drove all the way to Grand Rapids to try some. Was able to come home with some bottles. Poured very heavy, giving a small tan head. Dark thick body. No light comes through. Smell is very minimal bourbon with lots of coffee. Some wood smell. Taste is coffee with more bourbon than the smell. Very good. One of the best beers I've had. Poured the beer somewhere around 55 degrees."

"Finally had it at - on tap at Jerry's in Andersonville. Couldn't believe my luck. It's got the color of black silk and the mouthfeel fulfills the promise of the look. It is super smooth and elegant. The nose was somewhat subdued, coffee, licorice and a hint of bourbon. Taste had these and a bit of tobacco but all in much more distinct ways than the nose. I expected a big monster of a beer but this was smooth, subtle, and nuanced in flavor. Did it live up to the hype? How could it? But it was one pretty amazing beer and an astonishingly well-balanced one."

"Pours black with a mocha head. Aroma offers some nice bourbon and oak, nice roast, chocolate, coffee, and some vanilla. Exactly what you would expect from the description of the beer and as good as you would expect it to be. Flavor follows suit. A medium bodied mouthfeel, not too active to allow the flavors to stick around in your mouth. Overall, an absolutely phenomenal beer. Exactly what I hoped it would be. Right up there with Big Bad Baptist for my favorite barrel aged coffee stout --> I'll take Big Bad Baptist when I want the emphasis to be on the coffee, I'll take KBS when I want the emphasis to be on the barrel. Either way, can't go wrong. This beer is elite."

"Served in a tulip glass. Dark brown/black with a tan head about three fingers thick. The nose is molasses, chocolate, and roasted coffee, but the molasses is the highlight. The taste is slightly sweet. There is a good balance of hops and roasted barley. The alcohol is there and you feel it after one. A great selection anytime you can find it."
""
"Overall - To each his own, but I'm truly not impressed. FBS is head and shoulders above this beer, and this isn't in the same universe as BCBS, which I rated last night - it got all 5's. This is a good solid beer, don't get me wrong. And with all the discussions and history of this beer, you MUST try it. But in my humble opinion, this is above average at best. The flavors are good here, but not bold enough. The bitter and the bourbon carry the day. The nose on this beer is incredible, I will give it a 5 - but this does not carry over into the taste. And the mouthfeel I felt was somewhat lacking - almost watery. But this is just my personal rating. There are those that preach this as the gospel beers. As for me, I am not a believer."
"Overall, really well-done BA stout - not much to say other than that it's awesome and worth seeking out!"

"Bottle poured into tulip glasses and shared at a bonfire in the back yard. In the dark it was hard to tell the exact color but I'd say deep black with a quarter-inch tan head. Aroma is beautiful - the tell-tale Kentucky bourbon followed by chocolate and roast malt. Taste is phenomenal. The bourbon is there and is unmistakably Kentucky mash. An additional complex range of flavors pass over the tongue - chocolate, cherries, hints of dried fruit, roast, wood. This is an amazing beer. Now I understand the hype, but I sure wish it was more obtainable."

"O: Is there some overhyping of this beer? Sure. Are all of the detractors correct? Absolutely not. This one is complex enough to reveal itself in different ways to different palates; to me, it's not as enjoyably complex as, say, BCBS. I'm not sure this belongs in the top 10 on BA, but it's definitely not outside of the top 20."
"I really love this beer. Its hard to find though. I drink these in the morning. This is one of those beers you start to drink cold but it warms and it still tastes just as good. color is perfect. Smell is incredible. Tastes like bourbon and i like that. Mouthfeel is like a party in your mouth. You gotta love this beer. Pick it up when you can."

"Overall it is a very good coffee stout, and I enjoyed every last ounce of it. But it left me wanting for more refinement that perhaps longer aging will help. The coffee is noticabley similar to Black Xantus, but Black Xantus gets really really good after two years of cellaring and perhaps this would also. I'm glad that I could have a chance to drink and rate it. After letting it warm it does improve and becomes more blended and refined. I would wait for it to warm for 15 to 20 minutes to get maximum enjoyment."

"I've tried this beer a number of times from a bottle and the vast majority of the time I have been somewhat disappointed with the lingering bitter aftertaste. Almost burnt-like from the coffee / chocolate. Still a world-class beer but I don't know that I'll go out of my way to grab multiple bottles of it next time around. Perhaps I should try it on draft and see if that makes any significant difference."

"O - Amazing, lives up to hype. Best beer I've had. Get it if you can."

"When it comes to any certain style, a jaded beer drinker is many times tempted to say if you've had one you've had em' all. But half the fun is found in the seeking and finding of beers of distinction. While KBS may not be the absolute finest example of this style, it compares well to its peers and should be rightly defined as a beer of distinction."
""
"love this beer the only thing that gives me pause it that it tastes a bit like Dragons milk which i have problems with, But having said that i am a big fan of this beer mouth feel is so chewy and sticky and the head in this tap poured beer is a thing of beauty as well as the heady rich nose, love the way it lingers on the tongue for a good 3 minutes"
""
""
""
"O - It lives up to the hype, just wish that I could have found more than 3 bottles. Will be aging however many I manage to not drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Though this is only my second KBS, it is certainly turning up to be my favorite RIS along with the Parabola. It completely lived up to the hype for me and cant wait to get to the remaining 6 I have left in my cellar!"
""
""
""
"In closing, I gotta say that I really like this beer! It reminds me of Parabola, but maybe a little rougher around the edges with it's roastiness, and not as much barrel presence. Super easy to drink for a big beer, and the 11.2 ABV is expertly hidden and just the right amount IMO. I will buy this every chance I get!"

"My overall impression is that this is a good imperial stout, but lacks balance. I found it to be over the top as far as bourbon character is concerned and there is a very noticeable alcohol burn."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yay beer!"
"So, this beer is quite well balanced, sweet stout, bourbon, and bitterness. On this day, the bourbon seemed to play a slightly larger role than I recall. The beer also just seemed slightly thin in body. And as usual, letting the beer come to temp helps a lot. I think I still prefer BCBS and I need to re-review Ten Fidy, but this deserves it's place near the top."
""
""
"Bottle poured into a torst wine glass, short stem. Bottle date 3/23/2014. Pour is deep dark opaque black, silky looking like oil. Head retains caramel color and foaminess relatively well. Smell is intoxicating to me..deep dark chocolate, cigar, light molasses or brown sugar, coffee. Flavor follows the nose...dark chocolate malt and cream. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy...you really get the chocolate taste in the aftertaste which is extremely pleasant. Reminds me of an old school Italian pastry dipped in dark chocolate..very concentrated. Overall I must say I am impressed. All it's cracked up to be and more..wish I had more than just one!"

"O- Such a treat KBS is. It was overly impressing. The fact that these are always special released and harder to come by, make it that much more of a treat when you land them. I will revisit these as often as possible. Great job as usual by Founders."
""
""
""
""
"O: not bad but not great. dark chocolate is the dominant player here, which is kind of a shame. kind of hard to detect the barrel in this year's batch, and coffee also took a backseat. i hate to be that guy who says it was better last year, but it was better last year…or at least i remember liking it a lot more last year"
""
""
"O: This beer makes me happy and surprises me with every taste. It's the best bourbon barrel aged beer I've tried, without adding an overwhelming bourbon flavor but still infusing the beer with sweet and complex whiskey notes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Hmmm. I like this - a lot actually - but I'm honestly not blown away. I think my expectations were too stratospheric for this one. After having the ""Big 3"" of barrel-aged imperial stouts (this, Parabola, and BCBS), I'd put BCBS 1st, Parabola 2nd, and this one 3rd. But to dismiss this beer entirely would be folly: it's more (dare I say) 'elegant' than the other two, every bit as complex, and well balanced with a delicate bourbon character. Like I said, it's just not extremely exciting: BCBS is over-the-top in the best way possible, and Parabola - despite its incredible harshness - is loaded with a metric ton worth of twists and turns. This just seems a little muddled and unexciting in comparison. I'd definitely drink this again. I'd still buy this again if I got so lucky. But I wouldn't chase trucks just to get my hands on this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'd call 55 the perfect temp for this beer, and, should I find a place pouring at 55... I'll be happy to sit drink until they cut me off."

"O. A perfectly balanced bourbon barrel aged stout. Has everything I like about these beers. I'm a fan of their breakfast stout and imperial stout as well, and I think this really fits in their line of stouts. It is ranked very high although I often see it critized on the forums. I think it lives up to it's name, although there are a lot of stouts further downwards on 'the' list, that don't have to bow their head for this one. But it sure is good!"
""
""
"Overall: Great stout. Not as great as last year's edition, but still worthy of being one of the top beers. Good to cellar, especially to keep for the winter season."

"O - Wow. I think that sums it up."

"O - An absolute pleasure to have had the opportunity to try, and certainly a fantastic example of the style. Definitely a sipper, but a perfect brew for any celebration."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was lucky enough to have this on tap three times, which is good since the kegs only lasted less than a day. What more can i say abouth this except that it is nearly perfect. Hints of chocolate, coffe and carmel are perfectly blended to give this stout an amazing taste. the best thing about it is that it does not have too much smokey aftertaste."
""
""
""
"o: An amazing flavored stout, hits all the right notes, although the coffee is rather predictably overpowered by the extended bourbon barrel aging. But then the Founders blurb does say it is lighter on the coffee than their Breakfast Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It lives up to the hype. I feel like the bourbon overpowered the coffee too much, but it is still simply amazing."
""
""
""
"After a hard pour into a pint glass, I inserted a thermometer and let the beer sit until it reached about 55 degrees Fahrenheit. The beer is black with a huge khaki head that settled into a ring of lace around the edges with a light spotty cover over the top. The lacing was sticky and and residue remained around the glass as I drank the beer. There is minimal lacing. I drink bourbon and the booze is apparent in the smell. This brew tastes like it smells. The taste of dark malts, chocolate, coffee and the barrel are impressive. The mouthfeel is smooth. For me there is some rawness to this brew, maybe because I love bourbon and it is a unique taste. I sipped and savored this beer for over an hour. This is an excellent beer that I will search out more often, after I drink those I have, since it unavailable in my region. A masterpiece."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured an inky black with a slight red tinge around the edges and a solid one finger of thick tan head that receded to a thick cap of tan leaving abundant lacing down the glass. An excellent looking Imperial stout. Scents of oak, vanilla, rich chocolate, notes of bourbon, some faint coffee and a hint of alcohol. A wonderful, enticing, rich, strong aroma profile, that is amazingly executed and extremely appealing. Flavor begins with a rich hit of roasted black coffee, mingled with some dark cocoa and roast malt flavors and hints of bittersweet chocolate, moving into more abundant flavors of rich bittersweet and dark chocolate, cocoa and now notes of bourbon and alcohol, alongside some oak and vanilla. Finish is heavy on oak, bourbon and alcohol flavors, with roasted coffee and cocoa notes present as well. Aftertaste is roasted coffee, cocoa powder, bourbon, alcohol and notes of oak. An amazing flavor profile that is rich, bold and wonderfully balanced between coffee, cocoa, chocolate and bourbon flavors. Simply fantastic. Mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation and a pronounced alcohol warmth with a smooth and somewhat silky feel. An excellent mouthfeel that is both smooth and warming and lends it self well to sipping. Very well done. Overall this is an amazing stout with a fantastic aroma profile, a wonderful flavor profile and an excellent mouthfeel that aids the entire experience. Well worth having."
""
"this bottle is from 2013"
""
"Had this one a number of times, but my favorite was on tap on 5/16/14. Served in a tulip glass with a 2 finger head that I could just bury my nose into. Smooth bourbon on the nose with lovely aromas of roasted malts. Creamy mouthfeel and delicious roasty bourbon and even chocolate on the sip. The coffee flavors come through so well as it hits the back of my tongue. The I breathe out and catch all of the great flavors again. Bravo."

"Wow, what a thick, full-bodied beer this looks like. Virtually no head or lacing and only slight carbonation. Aromas of coffee and chocolate are most prevalent and some bourbon too. The taste is wonderful: again, coffee, chocolate, and bourbon. So smooth to drink and almost perfect in every way. Really glad I found this and that it lived up to expectations!"

""
""
""
""
"overall, I really like this. one of my top brews/stouts. up there with the Eclipse and Bomb! although different in taste. rich and decadent indeed. it may not have scored as highly as some of my other favorites, but then, we score these at different times and our palates and perspectives change over time, right?"

"A bourbon stout done perfectly. Aged in the barrels for a year the bouton really come out and complements the beer perfectly. The breakfast stout by founders is one of my favorites by itself. This is definitely the best bourbon stout in my opinion. Maybe my favorite stout period."
"I am not as astute as some people that give descriptions. But I do know that I absolutely love this beer. If you can get it, do. It's an amazing beer and well worth all the fuss. The mouth feel is smooth. I have had this on a few occasions and like it better each and every time."
""
""
"Had this on tap, cool beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Maybe not as flavorful as the Firestone's Parabola, but probably more approachable. Great beer, though I can't help thinking I'd rather have a Founders Imperial Stout in it's stead. The more I drink, the more I realize these BA stouts just don't quite do it for me. That barrel aging really thins out the brew and kills the depth in roasted bitterness; two qualities that I look forward to greatly in Impy stouts. Oh well, this wasn't my first, and it won't be my last."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – in this BA’s humble opinion - KBS definitely lives up to the hype. I wouldn’t say its my all-time favorite, but I would happily trade for it again or go out of my way to get it when travelling."
""
""
""
"O-Overall both beers were excellent the 2013 had more bourbon in the aroma and taste however the 2014 had the better head and lacing. I can't wait to compare them to my Parabola and GI BCS!"
""
""
""
"Pours a deep black, good opaque depth in it, and decent sized head of brown bubbles. Nice lace. Nose was my favorite quality of the beer with some very seductive bourbon dark-chocolatey notes, and roasty aromas. Big body on the palate, heavy dark chocolate, and plenty of bourbon booziness. Perhaps too boozy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really love this beer but I won't be chasing trucks for it. It's great, complex but if I'm going to be chasing anything it won't be this. Maybe I'm just putting it up against the Black Tuesday I had today. They are almost 8ABV between them but this just doesn't even come close to that. I guess I would have rated this higher if I didn't have that other beer today. Amazing how an amazing beer can make you think another amazing beer isn't as good. I guess I got spoiled today. Still an amazingly complex beer that demands respect."
""
"This is incredible. A friend of mine picked up a 6er of bourbon county brand stout. Gonna try this soon and compare."
""
""
"Overall: This beer is super complex and tasty. Matches the hype. A sipper that gets better as it warms up. Outstanding. Only negative is it is extremely hard to get and most stores limit you to one or two twelve ounce bottles. Cheers!!"
""
""
""
"Love stouts and had high expectations for this one. The smell of coffee is very overpowering on this one. For me this is a little too bitter and the taste tends to linger longer than I'd like. Also, seems like very little if carbonation if any. I hope the coffee stouts are just a trend, there seems to be too much focus on this niche."

"O: Fantastic beer, but didn’t quite live up to the hype for me. The nose was epic but the taste fell a little short of what I expected. Despite my lofty expectations this was still a fantastic beer, with the balance of flavors making up for the lack of expected intensity. Glad to have tried this one."

"O. This is one of the more chocolate forward beers that I have ever had. The coffee isn't as prevalent as I had expected. The heat is a bit much, so I'm hoping that with some age it'll mellow out. All things considered, this is a tasty brew and is something I'd like to drink again."
""
""
""
"Ironically, goes well with Breakfast. Best enjoyed in a cabin with good friends. My first review to BA - enjoyed on 4/19/2014 with sausage gravy and biscuits made on an old fashioned stove.

"Had this beer at the Extreme Beer Festival. SErved in a taster glass, cool. pours a black brown body and a nice hot chocolate like head. Smells like a pancake breakfast. tastes, smooth with wonderful notes of syrup, roasted malt, coffee with enough hop bitterness to balance. No strong alcohol flavor. Thick and wonderful without being cloying. What makes this work so well is that no flavor is overpowering yet easily layered and distinguishable. Just perfect."
"Great beer overall! It pours a beautiful coffee black with a tan head. Aromas are dark chocolate and coffee with hints of bourbon. This is a rich tasting beer with hints of chocolates and vanillas. A smooth beer with a great aftertaste! This beer definitely lives up to all its hype!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is indeed a damn good beer. But it is nowhere near worth the hype. To be worth the hype, this beer needs to be at least twice as good as it is. I'd probably like it more if it were a beer I could find readily available throughout the year. The real scandal here is that I believe Founders Imperial Stout to be a better beer. This is also my first time trying it. If I'm able to score another bottle in the future, I will age it to test out the difference. A few people have told me aging does wonders with this beer."

"Overall: Good, no doubt, but I've got easy access to plenty of brews (like FW XVII or Stone Southern Charred) that put this to shame. Tasty beer, but people need to keep things in perspective."
""
"O: Genious. The hunt for this beer is part of the allure. However, it is a 5 category stunner."
""
"Overall, this beer just, KILLS IT! Definitely worthy of your soul. What else can I say,... well if I were you I'd do whatever it takes to get your mouth on this one."
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel: The beer is medium full. Oh so creamy in the front a little viscous in the back. This beer has the profile of a double fudge ice cream shake it's that smooth and wonderful."
""
"Very good bourbon barrel aged beer. I have had a few that are just too overwhelmingly powerful with a whiskey/bourbon taste that it ruins the flavor of the beer, but this one is perfect. The hype around the release of the beer every year is very crazy too. I got a free t shirt this year."
""
""
""
""
""

"Taste impression is big, like opening an alcohol soaked barrel and finding coffee, with chocolate rolled in vanilla, and all lightly burnt. Still, it's silky smooth, and retains a superb balance with being boozy, chewy and sweet near the end..with a sticky choco-marshmallow-like sensation. Big, dense and complex. Worthy indeed. My lasting impression is that yes, this is a world class imperial stout. All the flavors I enjoy about the style are present, and balanced perfectly in such a high abv. Although I've had great stouts well above this strength, KBS would benchmark that game for me. Over a week later I have a lasting impression of the KBS flavor. Unique, and damn tasty. Deserving."

""

"Overall: This is definitely the best brew i have been able to get my hands on. Considering I am just starting to explore the immense world of craft brews, this beer still comes out on top. If you have the chance to buy Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout, get as many as you can!!"
""
"O: Hot Damn! I was honestly scared to drink this, worried about the hype and my preconceived notions. This beer lived up, completely. I was pretty enthralled with the FIS, but this is something else. The bourbon is so forward and so delicious – I wasn’t getting the BA craze, but this makes sense. I likely won’t cross paths with this beer again until next year, but I will now seek out any BA stouts I can find."

"Enjoyed on tap from a snifter at Plan B in Simsbury, CT.  I didn't want to go right out with all 5s for this review, but truthfully could find nothing to critique that wasn't on-par and expected in the style.  It poured black as pitch with a cocoa-colored head.  The nose is complex with coffee and vanilla notes right up front preparing my palate for deliciousness.  And delicious it was, with all the roasted coffee at first, followed by the sweetness from the bourbon-barrel aging and malts.  An outstanding stout, worthy of 100 rating."

"I've been eagerly anticipating my first taste of KBS and goddamn was it worth it!!! Maybe the best beer I've had to date. The pour is an inky black with a very small and short lived tan head that leaves a slight lacing but lots of legs. The aroma is a perfect blend of(in order of dominance) coffee, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, oak, and a little hops. The mouthfeel is as silky and smooth as any beer ever made. The flavor is an incredible smooth bomb of coffee, bourbon, chocolate, oak, vanilla, butter, hops. Simply fucking delicious and amazing. I'd sell my soul for a whole case. J/k....not really."

"I looked to trade for this beer for a long time and finally got a four pack of the 2014 release. While it is a great bourbon barrel aged stout, I personally thought both bourbon county coffee stout and founders breakfast stout were better. I can't wait to revisit this beer every six months until I run out to see how it matures."
""
""
"Breakfast Stout is one of my favorite beers and I love how KBS shares some similarities and adds some of the benefits of barrel aging. The end result is very good but it falls short of my high expectations. The flavors are big but aren't well integrated. The thin body combined with the astringent boozy finish kill it for me until I take another sip of the chocolately goodness."
""

""
""

"This has to be the most overrated beer I've ever had. I've been waiting a long time to try try this beer. I was very disappointed. I asked the bartender to check the keg to make sure it was KBS. He knew exactly what I was talking about and agreed with me. Zero bourbon flavor. If this beer was aged in bourbon barrels, then it wasn't for long or the barrel had been used several times. This beer tasted like an iced coffee. The mouth feel was thin. If you think this is a great beer, I suggest you try a goose island bourbon county stout. Everyone around me said the same thing. I enjoyed the beer, just did not live up to the hype."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer is the only beer I would go broke for. It only comes once a year, and it is by far the most consistent and satisfying beer that founders currently produces. If you get a chance, enjoy this beer with a friend, but beware, you may never experience something this good again."
""

"So I tried three bottles at three different temps over three days to get all the possible flavors I could out of the beer. First off this beer does a great job masking the alcohol at 11.2 %. Started with refrigerated bottle into snifter which gave off vague bourbon tones (good thing) but had to wait tor the dark chocolate and coffee tones to become more present as beer warmed. Second day poured room temp into pint glass. Chocolate and coffee tones more present in smell which becomes sort of an oatmeal cookie (again good thing). Third was cellari-sh temp and followed more like the second tasting. Overall very smooth and rich, the best BALANCED bourbon barrel aged stout I've had but I've Only just begun..."

"Grabbed this one at House of 1000 Beers. Had it on tap along with other Founder's Brewing Company Beers! This was a delicious stout! Poured a dark brown with a tan head. Smelled of coffee beans, a hint of chocolate, and bourbon. Once it hit my palate it was a nice and smooth body and tasted great! Tasted of coffee, chocolate, bourbon, and a bit of vanilla! Founders Brewing Company you guys did good! Two Thumbs Up!!!!"

"O - I was astonished by the complexity and balance of this brew. None if the flavors dominated and instead they worked together in harmony to create a splendid beer. Even my fiancée, who usually does not like barrel-aged beers, thought it was great."
"Overall, this one will be in my top 5 BBA brews for a long time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely worth the hype. I was able to secure three bottles (2014) and paid dearly for them. I would do it again. Very complex and inviting stout. Almost perfect!"
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""

"Over all an enjoyable experience. Though given the hype I have been hearing over the last few years I was expecting a bit more."
""
""
"My buddy at the liquor store was able to hold one bottle for me. It took more than a year to finally get my hands on it and it sure did not disappoint. It was definitely worth the $20 I paid for it. And that was a bargain considering it sells for $30 and it takes years to even get."

"Edit: re reviewed fresh 2015. After expanding my pallet, this beer is definitely one of the top stouts. Will re review with a couple aged bottles next year"
""
""
"The hype machine on KBS runs on overdrive but its a worthy beer to be sure. Maybe not ""quite"" as marvelous as the beer geeks would have you believe but for the money I can't name a better stout."
""
"O- By far one of the best stouts, BA stouts, chocolate stouts, coffee stouts, beers and beverages period. This is best fresh, trust me, no need to age hoarders."
""
""
"O: KBS really shines in its chocolate and barrel flavor balancing act. Its extremely drinkable not overly sweet and has a nice body. Theres not much out there as well brewed as KBS, a shame I could only get 2 bottles this year."
""
""
"Thanks again, Core42, you are a true Beer Advocate, my friend!"
""
""
""
""
"edit: had this next to BCBCS 13 and KBS 14 was hands down a better coffee stout"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2013 and 2014 Vertical pours at Yard House, Lynnfield, MA. 2013 has mellowed nicely with with subtle bourbon and coffee notes. Mouthfeel and body is slightly thinner than expected, but doesn't disappoint. 2014 is a little hot, but delicious none the less."
""
""
""
"O: Doesn't cut any corners, for better of worse. Those chocolate notes are incredible- I think they snuck a bar of chocolate into my bottle. Those alcohol/whiskey notes are lifelike- I think they isolated pockets of straight ethanol in my bottle, too. Very well rounded stout, tons of flavors that I can honestly say I've never experienced before (coconut) or at least not with such clarity. The expectations were high, no doubt, and while it did not live up to them it still surpassed nearly every other stout (and most beers of any category). Try to avoid any hype and simply enjoy it for the fantastic beer that it is."
""
"O- Wow. Fuck all the haters that say ""It was better last year, the year before, the year before..."" This is a premium BBA stout. While the coffee isn't as prevalent as expected, I've had enough BBA stouts to know this is one of the best. Killer drinkability, incredible flavor and feel."
""
""
"O: an amazing well balanced beer but not up to the hours finding and extreme hype. Worth a try but have enjoyed other BB Stouts that surpass this. Hopefully it will aeg well."
""
"O: Definitely hyped, and for good reason. This is an amazing barrel-aged coffee stout that I'm glad I got to try. If you like barrel-aged beers, coffee beers, or big stouts this is a must try."
"O: The hype of the beer was lived up to. I have heard so many great things and I wS fortunate to try it for the first time this year. The bourbon could be a little more mellow, however I thoroughly enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
"I liked this more as a vanilla bomb. I don't get the coffee as much. I get the malt. I get the chocolate. The classic bourbony/ vanilla flavor i love so much. Black, smooth, creamy. No charring. No bitterness. I probably prefer the regular BCBS, but this is still phenomenal. Definitely worth a try, even if it is $10 for 6 oz."
""
""
"Bottle poured into a snifter"
"O- Great beer with complex flavors. I'd like to taste more coffee though. For such a high ABV, it's very easy to drink."
"Good friend had snagged one of these and held onto it to split with me and my beer guru. What can be said, awesome beer, smell could be rated above 5 and with the ABV so high it gets an overall as almost perfect. I would love to track down some more of these."

"Went to a Founder's Tasting at Woodstock Hops & Barley in Woodstock Vermont and had samples of Founders Centennial, Reds Rye, All Day IPA and KBS. Decided to buy a growler of the KBS to take home to share with my brother and friends. KBS lives up to all the hype."
"prefer the fresh bottle. if you can get more than one bottle, its worth aging one just to realize your preference. my preference is to have this within a month of attaining it. In fact, I think everyone should have it fresh at least once. it shows you the full flavor profile. THEN age one, and decide. Just my suggestion!"

"Poured from 12oz bottle into snifter. Pitch black color with about 1/4” of mocha-colored head. Swishing the beer around leaves an oily residue and spotty lacing on the sides. Smell is an intense mix of chocolate, coffee, bourbon, vanilla, cinnamon, etc. Taste is equally complex, and includes all the aforementioned; heavy on roasted malts. A mild wave of bourbon heat shows up in the throat after every sip. After the first taste it's hard to restrain myself from downing this in a minute. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy and palette-coating. An exceptional beer."

"Utterly fantastic. Worth the chase. Great notes of chocolate, oatmeal and brown sugar. Bourbon barrel aging adds great complexity. Strong through the mid-palate and smooth on the finish. Tasted at a tap takeover in Boston in a tulip glass. If you are able to find it on-tap, you won't be disappointed."

"O: I had a small sampling of the 2013 vintage this year at EBF and was a little underwhelmed, but this bottle was truly great beer. Now I need to find a few more..."
""
""
"This makes for one amazing Spring afternoon back porch sipper. Most compare this to BCBS Coffee and I can see why. I feel that this trumps that particular version of the BCBS series simply because of the balanced profile. Just my opinion though."

"From previous tastings I'd say it peaks at about the 6-9 month mark. Very mellow and balanced. The coffee flavors are well balanced (not bitter like when it first came out)."

"Had this on draft at the founders event at tap and mallet. Dark black with no head. I am not usually crazy about stouts but this is incredible. Dark chocolate, coffee, coconut flavors. A little effervescence at the end. I can't believe how great this tastes."
"The Kentucky Breakfast Stout is the second best stout I have ever had next to the Bourbon County Coffee. Nice flavour all the way through and is remarkably smooth. Although the alcohol content is high, the taste is really light. This is a stout I could drink a bunch of as opposed to the coffe which is more if a one and done."
""
""
"O - definitely lived up to its hype! I would love to compare '13 to this years batch. Though I was not disappointed! Awesome stuff!"
""
""
"Ive been on the hunt for this beer since ive got into crafts. i was worried that this would not live up to the hype. For those who are worried, it did. ive drank other bourbon aged brews and no other are able to complement the flavor profiles. Everything in this beer seems to complement not overpower. I can with certainly say this is the pinnacle of my beer drinking to this point. i will be dreaming of this beer again. outstanding Founders, this make me feel doubly proud to be a Michigander."
"Had to bribe my local craft beer store to actually sell me one of these. Enjoying it as I write this. This is by far the best I've had from Founders and definitely up there with some of my other favorite beers. It pours near black with a creamy brown head. The smell is fantastic, like chocolate milk and vanilla bourbon. I've had many stouts flavored with coffee and chocolate before but this one definitely takes the cake, far and away. The first thing that hits the palate is the oak and the bourbon with a little bit of coffee bitterness. You can definitely tell that this beer is 11.2% alcohol; it warms the throat but in a very pleasant way. The aftertaste is very forward on the chocolate with undertones of coffee. It was mildly carbonated, and I enjoyed it more as it warmed up. Overall, fantastic beer. I will try my best to find another before they all sell out, and I recommend that you do too!"

"O: When I had this beer last year, I claimed it to be the best beer I've ever had. Since that time, I've been fortunate enough to try the likes of Heady Topper, Pliny The Elder, Goose Island BCBS, etc...Gun to my head, I'm a stout guy, and because of that, I still lean towards this offering as one of the best beers out there, if not the best. I know it's hyped beyond belief, but maybe-just-maybe it's worth it? Yep."
""
""
"Got one from my beer guy today. Cracked it open tonight. Pours a midnight black with a small head. Smells nicely of chocolate. Slight coffee too. The coffee comes out a bit more with the first taste. Hmm. A bit tangy as well. Just the right amount of booziness. Mouthfeel is incredible. Thick, smooth, creamy. Overall a fantastic beer. Not quite as high in alcohol as ones like DFH120 or as boozy as BCBS, which, in my opinion, makes this one more enjoyably drinkable. My first perfect score."
""
""
"Anyway, did I like this beer? YES. Would I buy it again? NO. I would rather have a good Dragon's Milk at half the price than wait and/or beg for a single bottle of this when its made once a year. Good it is, but that good, it ain't."
""
""
""
""
"O - Solid brew, though I am recalling last years batch a bit more fondly."
""
""
""
"O: I remember more stout qualities in the past, even when i tried this years when it was first released. I like the balance of the bourbon aging and imp stout qualities that KBS usually has and this one is lacking that. It is very sweet and very flavorful, incredibly smooth beer with no burn at all for a hgh abv beer. Was expecting more stout, got more bourbon, and founders did excellent, because i'm not dissapointed in the slightest. Just have to throw in when the alcohol shows itself, it tastes like delicious chocolate bourbon with a smooth subtle burn, basement temp is the way to go with this beer. Excellent job prost!"
""
""
"This is always one of the most hyped/limited beers out there in my area (RVA). I even went to the big box total wine the day it was supposed to be delivered and the manager told me they were only getting 1 case (1 bottle per person). imagine my surprise to find it on draft at Brew (chester, VA). Now I know what all the hype is about."
""
""
"Overall, one of the best barrel aged stouts around. A enigma for some and a legend to others."
""
""

"Also, drink it first. You’ll only get a full appreciation for this beer if you start drinking it sober. This is not a nightcap. It is an event, and should be treated as such. I’ve made that mistake before, and it is the worst mistake you can make."
""
""
""
""
"My 1st experience with KBS. Looks a lot like Coca Cola in my snifter. Almost no head, more of a film that dissipated quickly. Smells near perfect for what it is, lots o' coffee & chocolate not getting the vanilla that others have mentioned. Tastes almost exactly as it smells, pretty damn good. The mouthfeel is smooth but kind of bores me they way most non-carbonated beverages do. Overall, this is fantastic. I like the lower alcohol/booziness of the regular Breakfast Stout, though I know they claim this is it's own beer. That said this is an amazing stout."

"An astounding beer. Although incredibly hard to find (Researched and went to four stores before I found one that would reserve and sell to me.) it was well worth the wait. The pour is as thick and black as motor oil with a toffee colored head. The smell was divine with notes of caramel and coffee. The taste had more bourbon than I was expecting but the sweetness from the barrels combined with the dark chocolate and coffee flavors was heavenly. An absolute triumph of beer. If you are committed enough to find and acquire a bottle, buy it without a second thought."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Dark appearance and full mouthfeel, although slightly thinner than expected. The barrel is apparent but not nearly as in your face as something like BCBS. However, the beer is probably more balanced. Chocolate and coffee come through just enough to balance this beer perfectly. Very easy to drink given the style and ABV. Can't wait to get it again!"

"Re-review (2014 vintage): Picked up a bottle of this perennial treat on KBS Day yesterday, 4/1/2014. Poured into a Founders' etched snifter today, 4/2/2014. Essentially, it's very similar to last year in terms of my tasting notes. However nose-wise, I feel that the coffee is very subdued, and the bourbon is a bit watered down. Not as much vanilla (from the bourbon/oak) or oak presence here. The bourbon really doesn't hit me in the face as much as it did in last year's vintage. Flavourwise, plenty of sweet chocolate flavours, dark malts, milk chocolate, some coffee which is clearly not as noticeable as BCBCS et al. On the backend, there is more of a solid straight bourbon flavour that is initially sweet and a bit ashy, but the barrel contribution is relatively minimal. Good mouthfeel, viscous but a bit hot, leaves a nice warmth in my stomach as I drink it. But overall this is a slight letdown for me considering how much I enjoyed last year's version. It could very well be palate evolution or bottle variation."
""
""
""
"O - Definitely an amazing brew. Really happy to have gotten the chance to try. Would like to see how it ages alas I was only able to get one 12 oz bottle."
""
""
""
"Overall, excellent. I would say it was a little shy of breakfast stout itself. That is a very high standard though."
""
""
""
""
"The taste also has the same sort of dark fruit, dark malt character with a modest bitter finish. Everything merges together well but I am not sure if this lives up to the hype. Of course this was the first year I had it."
""
"Finally got my mitts on this one- stands up to its immense hype. Beautiful dark color with nice foam and retention, fragrant coffee chocolate and booze, taste is perfectly balanced and incredibly rich without any cloying mouthfeel whatsoever. It's really good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer lives up to expectations and it surprised me how sophisticated and balanced it was. Flat out expertly crafted beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hype may have done this one in a bit for me. This is a very well done brew, but I found it to be a little too boozy to the point of overpowering all but a little coffee. I'm aging a bottle so hopefully it'll settle a bit and will review again then."
""
"It comes out viscous and black, like motor oil. Looking around the edges of my snifter glass, there's a -little- bit of reddening in the light, but not much. There's no head to speak of but some khaki bubbles around the rim. The nose is bold with chocolate , vanilla, coffee beans, and wood from the bourbon barrel aging. These notes are in harmony with each other -- each comes through in a big way but nothing overpowers the rest. When tasting it, the sweetness of the vanilla plays off the natural bitterness of the coffee and chocolate for a balance of flavors, putting each ingredient on a pedestal to speak for itself. The oak and bourbon lend a secondary profile of woodsiness, burned toast, and molasses to make this beer an absolute pleasure to drink, and it all goes down creamy and smooth. The alcohol is absolutely undetectable. I wanted to age my other bottle, but I don't know if I can keep myself from cracking it open."

"O-seek this beer out. Imo doesn't matter what style of beer you are into this will be a treat. Cheers from Denton, TX and Oak Street Draft House!"

"How does Founders so consistently come up with such distinctive beers?"
""

""
""
" O very good and strong beer. Glad I got Tue chance to try it. Had in a large snifter at OSDH in Denton."
"O. This is an excellent ale. Big time. Worth the hype. The freshness adds a complexity that is not present in aged bottles. Particularly the coffee presence and bite. The roast is a little too much because it overpowers the bourbon."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- overall a perfect barrel aged stout. It is exactly what I'm looking for in one. Nice bourbon but isn't over the top like I feel like goose islands bourbon county is."
""

"O: My first time trying this and it's worthy of the hype. Fantastically complex and every flavor is so pure. Incredibly balanced. I only wish I had been able to buy more than one to try it with some age"

"Had the 2014 release of this at HopCat during their release date. The bar got packed up and pretty hectic for a while. This beer is fantastic. Warmed it up in the hands a bit to bring out some of the other flavors, as it was too cold to taste of them when first poured. Can't beat drinking this with the actual owners of Founders!"
""
"I was lucky enough to stumble upon a bottle of 2013 KBS. It went down to Florida with me and was tasted by 5 of us. I've had FBS, but never KBS. I have to admit, I was a little disappointed. I really expected something great. It just seemed like a stronger FBS. I really didn't get any of the bourbon in it. I will get a bottle or two of 2014 and probably drink one fresh and age one. However, this did not live up to the hype for me."

"O: A very delicious beer! The hype is a little crazy, but if the beer consumers allow for it you can't really blame breweries for capitalizing. I went to two tastings around Grand Rapids and both co-founders of Founders were at each with a beer in hand to chat with people. Pretty awesome."

"O: Definitely the best BA stout out there. I've had the pleasure of having these beer three times before: 2010 Nassau, NY beer fest, 2011 Nassau NY beer fest and 2012 in a bar in Rhode Island. Completely missed out last year; until now. On my yeary visit to my undergrad school in Wilmington, NC, I came across a few bottles of 2013 KBS at my old beer store, Lighthouse Beer and Wines (Wrightsville Beach, NC). I hadn't been there in over 3 years and all the staff remembered me, so they just happened t mention the hidden KBS behind the counter. I couldn't appreciate it more. Glad I have a few 4-pks of KBS lined up for this year. Founders does it right!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The story behind my trying this beer made it worth it even more. While visiting some friends in Kalamazoo, MI, several friends suggested making a trip to Grand Rapids to try the seasonal release of the KBS from Founders. We arrived around 5 am in the morning to find people wrapped around the brewery almost twice over. By the time noon rolled around, we found out that cases were no longer being sold because of the unanticipated number of people in queue. 30 minutes later, 12-packs were no longer available, and eventually by the time there were less than 50 people in front of us, we were informed that there were no longer any bottles available but the taproom still had plenty. We went in and I bought a pint and was immediately impressed. For a stout-drinker like myself, it was the epitome of perfection! It is slightly sweet from the higher-ABV, but otherwise a world-class beer!"

""
"Overall, excellent stuff. An extremely well done BBA stout."
""
""
""

"O - This is a great beer, but I think a little bourbon flavor would make it even better. I remember more bourbon from the times I've had it before, but who knows if my beer memory is reliable. Honestly if ""kentucky"" wasn't in the name I'd probably be blown away by how good of a coffee stout this is, but since ""kentucky"" is in the name I think it's missing a little something."

Perfectly balanced stout. When you drink it the heavens of your senses open up. No too much or too little of anything. Coffee.... Vanilla.... CHOCOLATE.... Simultaneously"

"If I could give this 6's all around I would. let me start off by saying that this is not in my typical wheelhouse. I'm a hop head through and through but this was one that I couldn't pass up. I was up in Waterbury VT for a beer release this past weekend and was fortunate enough to find myself at the Prohibition Pig - one of my favorite taprooms I might add. They had a keg of KBS from 2012 that they tapped. Immediately with your first sip you get notes of coffee but before you know it they are taken over by chocolate and vanilla. This is one of the smoothest beers that I have ever had. There is just no bitterness to it. If it wasn't for the ABV north of 11% I could drink this all night. This is the second time I was blessed with trying this beer. The first time was in the bottle."

"A solid representation of a barrel-aged imperial stout - strong dark chocolate, espresso, and bourbon on nose. Big bodacious malts, some cacao, and coffee on the body. A little lingering heat, but the finish is surprisingly thin though, which keeps this beer from being out of control tasty."

"Founders KBS is an American Imperial Stout aged in oak bourbon barrels in a cave under Grand Rapids for over a year~ With a heaping 11.2% ABV, she pours about jet black, with a thin and light look~ Aroma is Chocolate, Coffee, Smoke, Milky, Espresso, Bourbon, Vanilla and Oak~ Feel is rather light to medium considering what's in this beast, smooth as aged glass from the pacific, almost unlike any texture I have ever had, just cascades and almost seems to 'Disappear' as it gets swallowed, tingles a bit and it satisfying, mild burn~ Taste is... Oh here we go, Just like heaven~ All the for mentioned stuff in 'Aroma' Chocolate, Coffee, Smokey, Milk, Espresso, Bourbon, Vanilla and Oak~ Also, over tones of Brown Sugar, Cinnamon, Raisin, Dark Fruit and Mocha~ This Stout lives up to its name, overall very rich, complex and smooth... Many flavors can be picked up, however its the strong... Coco, Oak, Vanilla and Mocha paired with just probably the smoothest creamiest cascading texture I have ever felt that make this a superior brew that easily lives up to the hype, factor in a HUGE 11.2 ABV that only leaves a faint burn at best and you have what I believe may be the (or at least top 3) of the universes greatest beers, A new reigning champ in my book~ Overall: 98"

"Overall - One of the best Imperial Stouts I have ever had. The chocolate flavours are very rich and you can tell they used high quality ingredients. It's bold yet well balanced and the alcohol is incredibly well hidden."
"Poured into a chilled pint glass. Deep dark, almost black color, with thin beige head, lots of tiny bubbles, and strong, consistent lacing throughout. On the nose, strong scents of chocolate, caramel, toffee, and butterscotch jump out of the glass. And I think I smell a hint of cinnamon (or some other peppery spice). The bourbon/alcohol is not readily apparent until the first taste, and them BAM! On the palate, the bourbon announces itself, draped in a silky smooth chocolatey/coffee awesomeness. Yowza! Incredible balance between the rich, velvety malts and the balls to the wall bourbon bonanza. When I die, please embalm me with this nectar of the gods. The mouthfeel is full, lush, and absolutely chewy wonderful. Before KBS, I would not have considered myself a huge stout fan. But now? Sell the wife & kids, burn down the house, empty the 401(k), and move to Buenos Aries with a truckload of this shit (if you can get it)! Hallelujah!!!!"

"The 2010, pry off bottle, is almost the reverse of 2009. The bourbon takes lead, and while the chocolate is present, it by no means is dominant. I also detect subtle vanilla as well in the flavor. Carb level is still appropriate, and very similar to the fresh 2014 batch."
"O- One of the best beers made in the world easily compares to BCBS. So glad I have another bottle. Was afraid getting this at 9 months old the coffee would die down but it's a force in this one. Just an amazing beer."
""
""
""
"Great sipping beer, and better when the temperature warms. I'd suggest letting it sit for 10 minutes outside a fridge before consuming."
"O: Overall, this was a pretty damn good beer and an interesting experience. However, I not sure if it was worth the price I paid, I mean, I thought it looked incredible and smelled incredible, but it didn't taste incredible, it was good but I guess it just didn't fit the bill for my definition of a divine beer but it was good none the less."

"Full bodied and lingers but the carbonation keeps it from sitting too heavy."

"Dear me, I can see why people buy these by the case in several parts around the country every time this is released. Contains all the aspects I love in a stout, as well as oak forward characteristics I enjoy in oak-aged beverages. What's so impressive is how restrained and subtle so many of the flavors are. And, dare I say refreshing? It's a premier cigar beer, no doubt, but I could have this any day of the week, regardless of the occasion. It's complex, but extremely easy to approach. All of the elements are well thought out. I, however, feel the roasted coffee character is the highlight of the beer, and it's unfortunate that it probably wouldn't age as well as others of its league. Nevertheless, this is a world-class beer that should be tried by everyone, whenever possible."

"O- '12 - This is a very good beer. I probably could name a few coffee BA stouts that I would rather have than a one-year old KBS. I really enjoyed the '12 though! I am not trying to crash the KBS party. Great base beer!"

"12 oz bottle, split. The appearance is a beautiful black with a red-tinted head. There was pretty good lacing that faded with time. I get a lot of coffee and chocolate in the nose, along with some more subdued bourbon aromas and a hint of alcohol. I was blown away by all of the flavors that were going on - strong coffee and chocolate to begin, with oak and vanilla on the tail end. There is also a pretty decent alcohol bite. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Overall this was a nearly flawless beer, much as I expected it to be. I do think the alcohol bit just a bit too hard, although that's to be expected with an 11.2% beer. This one definitely delivered on the hype."

"Beer is medium-heavy to heavy in body, with low carbonation that makes this slightly foamy (1/5), but mostly smooth (4/5) on the palate. Appropriate for the style and this beer in particular. Closes dryly, with moderate to medium-heavy stickiness lingering on the palate."

"KBS is a delicious looking beer, dark and murky with a mocha head. The nose has a massive chocolate and coffee character with lots of sweet malt and dried fruit notes. The flavor is very complex but is dominated again by chocolate and coffee. There are notes of deeply roasted malts, brown sugar, raisins and ending with a hoppy bitter finish drying the taste out. There is a nice bourbon flavor, but it does not dominate (or mask) the other flavors. KBS is pretty boozy and has some hot alcohol. The finish is very long and dominated by the bitter characteristics of the brew (bittering hops, burnt coffee)."

""
""
""
""
""

""
"This is a great beer with some age on it. I think that it taste actually pretty bad when it is fresh. Kind of like Bourbon County Stout. But with a year or two on it, it is an amazing stout. The color, mouth feel , and nose even surpass the flavor in my opinion. Don't get me wrong the flavor is amazing but that is how good the other components are."

""
""
""
"Worth seeking out! Definitely A top beer."
"O - A damn delicious beer. Search it out. The only way this could get better is with a little less booze (for me). Some people seem to enjoy the booze. I feel this would be fun if it had a Huna/Abraxas/Mexi Cake treatment and had some chili's and/or cinnamon thrown in. It's a huge beer in a small bottle. Every time I've had this previously has been at the end of a tasting, with a wrecked palate. It was still good, but now, after having it by itself, I believe the hype. Well done Founders!"
"4.75/5.0…what’s really perfect?"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I have tried many great beers and this one is at the top of that list. Best thing about it honestly is that it lives up to the hype which for a beer this highly rated is difficult to do. My biggest knock was not enough coffee to balance the sweetness. Alcohol is dangerously hidden"
"O - This is a phenomenal beer. It blurs the lines between a fine beer and a fine liquor. Even though I think this is a great stout, it would not be my go-to stout. I would save this one for special occasions. I have to say, my favorite stout continues to be Breakfast Stout."

"O - An incredibly warming beer. Recommended after a full meal on a cold night. Nothing bashful about it... high ABV, but flavor complements incredibly well. I am not a bourbon fan, but I can appreciate the complex flavor palate. Highly recommended if you are a fan of bourbon and can actually get a hold of one of these rare gems."

"O - KBS is a consistent highlight in a man's yearly beer calendar. It's as good as the first bottle I ever had the pleasure to experience. What Founders has produced is the ultimate perfection of the American/Double Stout style. I will look forward to this year in and year out. As a Kentuckian I know the best bourbon and I know good ales aged in these barrels and KBS is an absolute out of this world brew. It has everything and lacks nothing. Ill buy this every single time I get the chance and never think twice about it. It is the platform to what a barrel aged stout should be."

"O- I've had this beer a few times now and when I first had it I was pretty disappointed but slowly I've been able to look past the hype of this beer, in both finding it and the high ratings, and appreciate how well crafted it is. I still prefer BCBS and Black Note to this one, the coffee and chocolate are a bit too much and kind of covers up the barrel too much as opposed to working with it, IMO. Still an amazing beer and worth seeking out and maybe waiting in a not too long line for."
""
""
""
""
"KBS pours like a typical imperial stout: thick and impossible to see through. The head lasts for the duration of the beer. The notes of chocolate and coffee are strong, and the bourbon really hits on the back end of the beer. Because of the beer is so infused with bourbon, this is not a beer to drink quickly."

"This beers reputation is well deserved. $7 well spent. We get most of this brewery's product in NH but the stouts are an extreme rarity. Breakfast can't be sold in bottle due to its label depicting a minor and KBS is like Sasquatch or Cubs WS appearance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On the whole...what can I say that hasn't already been said? KBS honestly lives up to the hype. Rich and robust while still displaying remarkable subtlety and complexity. I can't wait to be able to try more than a small sample of this beer...but for now, a sample will do very nicely."
""
""
""
"Overall I think the hype is bigger than the beer but it still is a great beer. So much to offer in complexity. There are a few beers I may like better for wow factor in flavor and drinkabilty but this is hard to beat. For the price it is definitely worth it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Amazing. Outstanding. Should you try this? You know you should try this. You don't need my recommendation"

"What can I say this is the best stout ever. Thick, heavy, delicious, complex, may cure brain damage, water on the knee, and if made in large enough quantity, may be the conduit for world peace. Praise the lord and pass the KBS. More words needed, but words will only keep me from waiting for the first week in April when KBS is sold for all of 5 or 6 days."
"Thanks to the mind. This is a very dark, thick, rich bourbon stout. The smell is excellent and the taste is outstanding. No burn, all pleasure! Founders Breakfast stout is one of the top beers of all time on my list. Add in bourbon barrel aging and it is knock out. I must have more of this stout next year."
"O: Excellent drinkability. Masterpiece"
""
""
""
"This stout is near perfection. The quality of the stout itself and the bourbon barrels used to age this beer make it one of the best stouts I have had the pleasure drinking! This stout pours almost black with a nice brown head. The flavors of chocolate and coffee are outstanding. The bourbon flavor complements the overall taste."

"Had a bottle just the other day. Poured it in to a pint glass and it was immediately a beer I knew I would love. Came out dark brown, beautiful frothy head, and the smell was instantaneous. The beer lives up to the hype. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Picked one up for my friend as I needed to share the love while it can still be found in NH."
""
"Fresh 2014 bottle dated 3/14/14. Pours a dark imperial stout black. Unfortunately for this rating, i am continuing past the appearance. Aroma is coffee, but not the most pleasant coffee. Reminds me of the subpar coffee at Munster donut. Kinda stale. Taste is even worse. Stale coffee with a bit of roast and chocolate. Some might say the flavors are balanced. No the stuff is just weak. That's like complementing Budweiser on the water and piss being perfectly balanced. Mouthfeel is thin. This stuff has the body of a coked out Olsen twin. Overall, this is a subpar bourbon imperial stout. I used to think this stuff was really good. I don't know if founders has dropped off in an effort to crank out more of their most coveted annual release or if everyone else has caught up to and blown past. Either way, this stuff is highly overrated and really only serves as trade bait. Don't believe the hype."

"Bottle at home in London as dusk approaches to cap a rather pleasant Sunday. I drink this beer as the ceremonial 4000th rating, but also to celebrate an anniversary. The beer pours black-brown with a sturdy, creamy and tight beige foam head. Lots to take in on the nose. Dry coffee hits first, followed by oak chips, dark cocoa, alcohol, mild roast, a bit of tobacco and earth. Great flavor, very rich, very sweet. Lots of charred malts, brown sugar, vanilla, chocolate cake, oak and straight burnt wood, some mild earthy bitterness. Full bodied, lightly chewy with fine carbonation. Warm finish with lots of dark sugars, licorice, molasses, dark chocolate, light coffee, mocha, vanilla, chocolate syrup, light peat, burnt grass, burnt wood. Certainly lives up to the hype. It’s a robust, nicely nuanced beer with plenty of punch. I love it. A great way to commemorate this happy day."

"I won't break it down like some of the pro guys do on here, because I really don't drink a beer like that. The drinkability of this beer is just like that of the breakfast stout, so easy going down even at such higher ABV. It feels like you're drinking frothy thick tasty heaven. Most of the larger stouts I've had with this high of ABV lose that frothy mouthfeel and feel more like syrup without suds, but this still has it. So good, finally got to try this beer and it has raised my stout bar even higher. I think I gotta go back to the store I bought this at and stock up with even more."

"O – This beer is fantastic and everything that I dreamed it would be. It looks fantastic, has one of the best aromas I can remember, tastes heavenly, and has a great mouthfeel to back it up. It comes close to perfection and is by far my favorite bourbon barrel-aged stout that I’ve had so far. I love bourbon but I don’t want it to overshadow the beer when the two are blended. I think Founders absolutely nailed the blend. The bourbon flavors and aromas are present without any boozy sting. I really wish this beer was more readily available because it’s too good to only be able to get a bottle or two via trading. Maybe my luck will change in the future and I’ll be able to find more. In the meantime, thank you SO much, Jared, for the chance to try this wonderful, wonderful beer!"

"O- Very impressive brew that can be quite difficult to find out my way. I was hoping some aging would take the edge off some and bring out more of the chocolate flavors, but it could have probably used another 6-12 months. An outstanding breakfast stout none the less."
"2012 version. Pours black as night with a quarter finger of a dark mocha colored head that dissipates very quick and leaves an extremely thin ring of lacing. Smells of lots of roasted coffee, some bourbon, oak, vanilla, roasted malts, some dark chocolate. Taste starts with coffee, dark chocolate, some oak, and roasted malts. Then the middle brings more sweetness. Notes of molasses and carmel join the darker coffee, chocolate, and roasty notes. The finish is just fantastic. Strong, yet not overbearing notes of bourbon, vanilla, and oak come into the picture and meld with the now stronger notes of roasted coffee and dark chocolate. The bourbon, oak, and vanilla get stronger as it warms; yet it does not get hot at all. It simply makes the beer more complex and flavorful. Surprisingly thin for a beer of this magnitude. High medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Not enough good things to say about this beer. It’s smoothness makes it stand out from a lot of other barrel aged stouts. Extremely well done."
""
""
""
""
"I cracked my bottle open for my birthday after aging it for around 6 months. After a night of drinking great beers this clearly stood out head and shoulders above all others. After a little aging it mellows the bourbon taste, but this is unbelievably smooth. Incredible flavor, pitch black color, wonderful aroma, this is truly a beer fit for a king. Well worth any hoops of fire and obstacles you may have to jump through to get. Words can't express how amazing this beverage is."
""
"To me, this year's version is better than 2014 and well worth the crazy search. Even better with about 6 month aging."
""
""
""
"O: Truly a great brew. My only complaint is with the mouthfeel, which is a little thin and lacking for the style but still not a major hangup. Not quite as good as BCBS or BCBCS, but it's right up there"
""
""
""
"O: The flavor and fanfare is everything this beer has claimed to be; a stout richly layered with balanced flavors of roast, chocolate, coffee and bourbon barrel aging. The alcohol is well hidden under all that is going on but the warmth"

""
"Pours stout black with a little tan head. Aroma is big on coffee and what smells a little bit like rye. Some bourbon traces in there as well. Taste brings much more strong coffee and roasted malts, with some vanilla interlaced. Decently thick on the palate with a bitter coffee finish. While I do enjoy this beer, I think the original Breakfast is better."

I taste chocolate and coffee right off the bat. The fact it is aged in an oak barrel and has a high alcohol content gives it that extra flavor you don't find in most stouts.

"2012 vintage poured from bottle into Founders snifter, now with 4-5 months on it. Thin dark chocolate coffee brown head which fizzes out quickly leaving an extremely thin layer around the inside of the glass and on top of the body; some chunky lacing left behind, I think more so now than fresh. I thought it would smooth out a bit more, creating ""legs"" with the bourbon, etc. Color almost black. Coffee aroma has dissipated somewhat at this point, leaving sweet and boozy chocolate with some oak. Taste is similar; less coffee, more sweet vanilla and bourbon coming through now. Sweet bourbon is prominent. Mouthfeel seems to have balanced out a bit more, both bitter and smooth now, I'd say a tad less creamy. Light carbonation. Going to let this one sit and breath for awhile. Still, it's one of my ""special"" beers, glad I have 5 or 6 more to enjoy in the future. Cheers."

"O - Love this beer. It was the first time I was fortunate enough to have one. Its like no beer I've ever had. Very smooth with all kinds of flavors going on. I'd describe it as a chocalate custard shake with a shot of bourbon in it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Outstanding beer. Very complex. Coffee, chocolate, and bourbon are your primary flavors, as they're advertised to be. Truly an outstanding beer. I've had other barrel aged stouts, but few can match this level of balance between the various flavors."
""
""
""

""

"Overall: This beer just isn't my style of bourbon imperial stout. too much coffee not enough bourbon. the bitter level is pretty good, but i'd like to feel more kick. i'd take black note any day over this."
""

""
""

"Beer is straight solid, absolutely enjoyable for breakfast. Only point to ding it on is the thin mouthfeel. It's surprisingly odd since KBS coats the inside of the glass, but it comes across as thin. Otherwise it would be 4.5s all around."

"2013 Vintage. Poured from a bottle into mug, the beer is jet black, and pours heavy, with no head and only the slightest dark brown ring of film around the surface. It literally poured like motor oil, and it looks delicious. Aromas of wood and earth, with a backbone of rich chocolate and touches of smoke, highlighted by booze. Flavors are robust, with a smoky, woody forward flavor followed quickly by dark, bitter baker's chocolate and rich, full, roasted coffee. Wow, this one is layered, and it is unbelievably smooth. Smoke and roast fills the senses, as well as the palate, throughout each drink. Creamy vanilla highlights, with a warming sensation from the heightened ABV. This is tremendous. Smooth, full, and creamy in mouth, with an almost velvet feel. Roast and coffee on the aftertaste, with hints of booze. Dry, roasted finish, with a smoked and woody linger. This is a fantastic brew, and I can only imagine it would age very, very well."

"Overall.... my unicorn of beers is down and to be honest I was let down. I am going to eventually try it again but to me we had a bad batch or something. Maybe cause I had it in June (out of season) and it's no where to be found anywhere else, I doubt it... but you never know. It was way too boozy/barell-y taste for me. I've tasted 10,11,12 percent abv that tasted like there was no alcohol. Alcohol was very prominent in this one. It was excellently balanced and good but in my opinion not top 10 worthy... in fact I tasted 5 other beers that night and KBS was the 4th best I had... Definitely try it... age it.... buy it... but don't get your hopes up."
""
""
""
"Very delicious, as usual. This year seemed distinctively more chocolate-forward and less bourbony than in years past. Nonetheless, it is a very well-balanced and delightful brew. Not quite a top 10 beer, in my opinion, but still very very good. You should drink it."

"O - very good beer, not my favorite of the BA stouts, but very glad I got to try it."
"Overall (4.25): This is a very, very good beer. Is it excellent? Maybe. Is it the best imperial stout I’ve ever had? No. That might actually go to (at this date) Founders Imperial Stout. But this does bourbon barrel aging better than 95% of other such beers, which I’m thankful for (’cause a lot of ’em can’t balance their shit very well). But this is a very, very good imperial stout with excellent chocolate and coffee components and a well-played barrel component, too."

"One of the best balanced and complex stouts out there. Nothing over the top. Just a perfectly executed stout. A perennial favorite and worthy of the hype it gets."

"O- An unbelievable balance of lots of booze, flavor, and smooth drinking. This beer is outrageous! I'll begin my vertical cellaring with the rest."

"The mouthfeel is very thick and smooth, just what you would expect. The drinkability is obviously pretty low, which is to be expected from a brew of this type, but doesn't detract from my score.

"O - It's really hard to go wrong with bourbon. Founders hit the sweet spot with this one. I'll probably rate it just below bourbon county. KBS is more finesse where BC is in your face aggressive."

"A few other thoughts: KBS is by far my favorite of the Breakfasts. It was SO smooth and velvety, and hid its 11.2% ABV remarkably well. It’s sweeter and creamier than the CBS, and has none of that licorice funk that I found in its sibling. It’s just an amazingly balanced, practically perfect beer."

"After missing out on this beer at the store and several local tap houses I caught it at the oldest beer bar in town. It was well worth tracking down and making the trip just for a glass. Very dark, served in a large tulip glass the aromas shifted from a hint of bourbon to chocolate. A smooth full body mouthfull. There where so many flavors coming accross that it took a long time to get through them all. It reminded me of the scene from Charlie and the Chocolate factory where the girl takes the gum and new flavors come to her as she chews. This beer was like that, every sip brought a new flavor and insight. When this gets bottled again I won't be missing out. It is well worth hunting for."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pitch black with a very thin cap of mocha head. Moderate slick lacing. Nose is a lot of bourbon, with a hefty helping of coffee. A bit of chocolate and a slight vanilla note with some caramel and malt. Mouth is very roasty and sticky. A lot of coffee with a bit of bourbon. The chocolate is present again, but it's more of a bitter/dark chocolate. alcohol is well hidden on the aroma, but a little hot on the tongue. As expected, an awesome beer."

"a huge thanks to drlovemd87 for making this a reality. he is a gentleman and a classy BA. the holy grail here, it pours a chocolate brown color, dense and creamy looking, with an inch or so of espresso colored head that doesn't budge. the nose is awesomely coffee heavy. not acidic, but bright and mellow at the same time. some mild dark chocolate notes, a ton of roast, but not bitter at all. the flavor really features this coffee, somehow with a neutral ph. the ultra roasted barley gives an almost smoky flavor, while the chocolate stays in the background. I am most blown away how I taste no alcohol at all in this beer. the founders imperial is hotly alcoholic, in this beer, its totally hidden, even though its stronger. some bourbon hints with char and vanilla come through, but this beer isn't sweet at all. not teeth coating, not heavy. its remarkable how drinkable it really is. the coffee feature is as good as it gets, almost weirdly refreshing, like an iced coffee. the depth and complexity of this fine ale is second to none, and the perfection of its craftsmanship is mind boggling. I cant remember a beer so highly hyped that delivers as well as this gem does, save pliny the younger. its that good. thanks again to drlovemd87, youre a bloody legend mate!"

""
"O - As a newcomer to the beer world, this is one of the greatest beers out there! Not because of the hype, but because of what it is. I've written about wine for 2 yrs and understand complexity and balance. Possibly one of the best stouts I've ever tasted! Thank God I have 3 left in the cellar."

"D - A huge stout with about as much flavor as you can possibly pack into one brew, but I'm not so sure it was worth the hype. It certainly had a massive bourbon and coffee flavor, but I think in the end it lacked a bit of complexity and depth. Great beer, and I couldn't be happier to have tried it, but probably not worth all the hype, in my honest opinion."

"Final Thoughts: I was very lucky to snag a bottle of this year's release and thoroughly enjoyed KBS. Founder's proves time and again that their seasonals are some of the best beers available. While KBS probably won't break my top 10, it is still a phenomenal beer that every beer geek should get the opportunity to try. Would I drink it again? Yes."
""
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely love this beer. Got it on tap at the Founder's release party and it was just as delicious as it was talked up to be. I also have one bottle I am saving for a special occasion (I lied to someone and told them it was my birthday to get the bottle)."
""
""
"Walked in there is only 2 people in the bar and thats good. My 8 oz pour listed at $7 was only $5 and thats better. Beer looks real good, smells just ok (which does get better as you go), hints of chocolate, coffee, bourbon. First taste blows me away, nothing like the bottle. Big chocolate, coffee flavors mixing with a beautiful bourbon barrel in perfect harmony. Finishes dry, stout like dark fruits. Really impressive balance of flavor, thick and rich. 3 pours later I had my 24 oz bomber equivalent for $15 now thats what Im talking about. Something to chew on and contemplate this rainy, quiet, Monday afternoon. Founders you have finally impressed this Bourbon County lover. I will never care to have just one bottle, but this was a real treat."

"The beer pours black like motor oil, black and almost sludge-like. The beer pours with a small khaki head that fizzles away to just a ring around the glass. The head leaves a lacing of thin dry velvety bubbles in root-like tendrils. The beer is properly impenetrable to the eye, like the infinite blackness of space. On the nose, the beer smells of meaty roasted coffee, creamy dark chocolate, a little touch of charred oak, and even a hint of sea salt chocolate. Bourbon is pretty weak in the nose, which is not a bad thing. What does seem to be there, from the bourbon scent is blended beneath the thick roasted coffee notes, but does show a touch of booze. On the tongue, the beer tastes smoothly sweet and then bitter with a slight savory touch, a lasting wetness from acid, and a final light burn of boozy alcohol. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet roasted coffee with touches of creamy dark chocolate, and boozy bourbon hiccups that add a sticky sweetness to the beer. A dry roasted bitter from the coffee flavors sits through the second half of the taste and into the aftertaste along with touches of tannic oak barrel. The finish is sweet with bourbon and smooth milk chocolate and the aftertaste is slightly bitter but sweet with chocolate and bourbon lingering. In the mouth, the beer feels like heaven. Thick and creamy with a carbonation of velvet softness that caresses the tongue beautifully. This is the best feeling stout that has ever sat within my mouth. It leaves the mouth slightly dry and sticky with lingering sweetness from the booze and malts. Overall this beer lives up to its hype. It feels amazing in the mouth, and carries the perfect amount of sweet bourbon and oak characters. The coffee and chocolate flavors are much more prevalent in the flavors. This beer is excellent, and by far the best bourbon stout I’ve tried to date. I only wish I could actually get a 4 pack of it in my area…"

"O - Perfection. Beg, borrow, or steal to get this beer; it lives up to the hype."

""
"Overall I really didn't think this beer would meet the hype , I was wrong , it met it and beat it. For 18 bucks a 4 pack this is the best beer I have had in this price range. If you can get some , I recommend strongly you get it , do not pass it up. I am not one of the huge stout fans in this world , but this just became my new favorite beer"
""
"O: Expected to be overrated but is not. Consistent with very high ratings and definitely one to try."
""
""
""
""
"O- KBS is easily one of my favorite barrel-aged stouts, the only slight complaint that I have about it is that it is a little bit on the bitter side for a stout. Other then that though this beer is very good and the barrel-aging on it is almost a perfected art. I wouldn't highly suggest aging it as the coffee fades letting the bitterness from the chocolate come out. The '13 was definitely better then the '12 which had a little over a year on it, I can say what further aging would do. If you haven't had this before it's definitely worth seeking out, I just wish it was as readily available as the regular Breakfast Stout instead of a once a year release."
""
"It bears repeating that its degree of balance is astounding. Each sip is like a soft journey through it's flavorful layers. Going forward I will take whatever steps are necessary to have this beer each year, however inconvenient. Find it and enjoy as much as possible!"

"This highly acclaimed stout pours a smooth, pitch black color with very little head. The aroma is rich with chocolate, coffee, and bourbon. The taste is explosive and delicious. Deep robust flavors erupt on your taste buds as the alcohol warms your stomach. It finishes with a oak, bourbon flavor. This is smooth, delicious, and just as good as expected."

"overall a world class bourbon stout. also, I've had it before in bottles but its significantly better on draft. nice!"

"O: Absolutely phenomenal. Drinks like liquid luxury, alcohol is so well masked with the exception of a welcoming warmth going down. Wish i had a few more bottles, but thankful to be able to have tried this one."

"But that does not mean it's not an absolutely terrific stout! As it is absolutely wonderful!"
""
""
"Overall: Well worth all the hype, honestly. This was my second bottle this year and I enjoyed this one exponentially more than my first (which is why I held off on reviewing it until I had this one). It is a must try for all of you fine people. At about $5/4 pack more expensive compared to BCBS, I'd have to say it's worth the hike in price. I love BCBS, but this beer justifies the extra $1.25/12oz IMO."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The best aspects of this beer are the perfect mouthfeel and the wonderful balance of all the flavors. The only things lacking are the coffee flavor and the overall aroma. This year's KBS is a lot more chocolate-forward than years past, and definitely less boozy (especially considering it was bottled only a few weeks ago). It is typical for people to age barrel-aged imperial stouts, but this one is drinking great right out of the gate! I would recommend drinking it at cellar temperature (around 50-55 degrees), and consider pairing it with a piece of plain cheesecake. Overall this was a great beer!"
""
""
"M&D&O - hype met. KBS is an incredible experience and I am very glad it finally made it to New England. I hope some local watering holes got some logs of it as well. It tastes like it would be even more amazing on tap. Rich, thick, layered, complex and utterly flavorful. Try it."
"Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout) ---4.5/5"
""
"Deep chocolate colored body with some brown head if poured vigorously. It quickly leaves. The nose gives cocoa powder, latte/espresso, and some creamy/lactic notes. The taste is slightly oaky and loaded with vanilla. This tastes like a vanilla latte with cocoa powder sprinkled on top. There is a hint of bitterness from the coffee. Loads of vanilla bean on the front end. The backbone seems like an oatmeal stout and has that level of viscosity. It might not be thick enough for some, but it makes it easy to drink. Very little booze on the nose and the taste. I really love this beer."
""
""
"O - Pretty much met all of the hype, bourbon/alcohol and vanilla sweetness really dominated this one for me. The dark fruits were very much in your face initially, the warmth brought forth more vanilla boozyness."
""
""
""
"I don't know if it is worth the $7 for a 12 oz bottle. Goose Island BCBS is much more intense. Central Waters BS has much more of the bourbon barrel notes. Overall, this is a very good imperial coffee stout."
""
""
"I don't really have much more to contribute over what's already been said by more experienced palates, but KBS is absolutely phenomenal. Poured motor oil black into an oversized wine glass with a modest creamy mocha head. Hints of mahogany when held up to the light. Scintillating aroma with a lot going on; roasty and sweet. Taste is elegantly layered, like a dark chocolate coffee cake in liquid form, revealing hints of caramel, vanilla, and oak as it warms. Muted bourbon character that isn't overpowering but comes together well with the other flavors. Incredibly balanced and nuanced. Mouthfeel is moderately thick but thinner than other big stouts. Dangerously drinkable, luxuriously smooth, and not as hot as you would expect for the ABV. Definitely one to sip and savor. A real treat. A shame this is so much of a hassle to acquire."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'd definitely buy some again, but not something I'd buy every day, especially considering the price."
""
""
""
"notes: so this is KBS! I was afraid the beer couldn't possibly live up to the hype, thank God my fears were unfounded. Aroma, mouthfeel and taste are all perfect or nearly so. The only minor blemish is lack of lacing and head retention but that may just be a result of the barrel aging. The Bourbon flavor is blended in to the beer very well so it is not a hot mess. This is one of the best beers I have ever had. I hope to be able to get another bottle for Christmas!"
"Seriously smooth and velvety - vanilla and caramel and sweet sweet bourbon. The aftertaste is a sweet burn from the bourbon barrel. Delicious and very sippable - the intensity of this beer makes me recommend not chugging it! It is also incredibly rich. So happy to have been able to try it on tap, would love to compare it to the bottle!"

"Serving Type- 12oz bottle poured into a large tulip"
""
""
""
"Overall: This one deserves the praise. I love how balanced this is. The bourbon can actually compliment the beer instead of overpower it. Chocolate, vanilla, coffee, bourbon ... what's not to love?"
""
"overall - sort of a bummer that the first time i saw this beer on the shelf this year was in mid-may. at this point, im ready to put any and all winter warmers behind me and transition to more ""sessionable seasonals"". i wonder why they wait until the spring to release this one. either way, the beer was wonderful and very much true to style. i like that the bourbon characteristics were obvious but not overwhelming. i've had bourbon-minded beers in which the boozy-bourbony elements were overpowering and ruined the experience as well as my palate....sometimes subtlety is a virtue. i'll probably age this one a bit and see where it goes."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is the KBS I remember and it took me back to a better time in beer 5 years ago. When this beer was fresh and the carbonation was there this beer was a lush monster, this rich and lush monster is what built the reputation and high score for this beer. If the carbonation was there that once was this would get a much higher score. The KBS now is only a shadow."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"KBS takes the already delicious Founders Breakfast Stout to the next level. It's a smooth, luxurious blend of chocolate, bourbon, and coffee in equal measure, and pretty much on par with the reputation that precedes it."
""
""
"Overall - Many beers fall to the hype once the hype gets to a ridiculous level. KBS is not in that class. This beer stands on its own and speaks for itself."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This was my first encounter with the esteemed KBS, and I have to say, it didn’t disappoint. I was drinking several very good beers in a flight while waiting for KBS to be poured at a local establishment’s Beer-Fest KBS party, and when compared side-by-side to KBS, the other beers definitely fell a bit into its shadow. In a special class, KBS is well worth the effort of hunting it down. I’m sure I’ll be doing the same when it releases again next year!"

"O: This is a truly EPIC stout in almost every way. Is it worth $5 / bottle, for 2 bottles once a year? Sure. Would I pay that much every day?, no way. Continuous battle of hype, expectation, scarcity and quality. But a great beer in any case."

"Overall - In my humble opinion, there is simply not much to improve upon. It is so well-balanced and well done that there won't be much that is better in this specific genre of beer. I'm not going to sit here and pretend that I'm vastly experienced with bb stouts, but I know a great beer when I drink one. This is a great beer!"
"Yet another great beer from Founders! It isn't something you could drink a lot of, but still remains a tasty beer. I don't think it's the best beer that Founders makes, but it's 100% worth trying and I would definitely drink this again. It exemplifies the signature barrel aged smoothness and bold character that I come to expect from their beers. A must try for barrel-aged beer lovers."
""
"O - Does not live up to the hype, plain and simple, partly because there IS so much hype. It is, however, a good stout, but as far as bourbon barrel stouts go, there are countless better examples."
""

"O- KBS is a solid BA stout. It says on the bottom of the label, ""Is good for everything a stout ought to be good for"" and it certainly is. I typically like my stouts with more of a vanilla characteristic to them (something KBS and CBS certainly lack) but it's a fantastic beer nonetheless."

"O- This one was as fresh as it gets so it was a bit boozy, but you can't go wrong here."
""
""
"O- this beer is amazing. The flavors compliment each other perfectly and there is a lot going on at one time. Along with the obvious listed flavors, you get subtle cinnamon, marshmallow, lactose, hint of smoke, some boozieness. Can't wait to do a side by side with my 2012. This is a perfect example of the style. Make sure to drink this just under room temp to make sure you get to enjoy every aspect of the beer."
""
""
""

"O. This is the best stout I have tasted. Its unfortunate that it is so limited. If I could get regularly, this would be my go to beer. I will be cellaring two of them and trying in a couple years."

"i was able to get one bottle of this by chance and the graces of the dude @ the beer store. i didnt even know what it was. i know what it is now. kbs is one of the best stouts i have ever had. it pours an opaque black and is pretty thick.the smell is not to strong. i get a little creaminess in the nose. the flavor is rich and complex with a nice bitter that maintains from start to finish as the of background flavors move from coffee- to chocolate by the end. now im pretty sad b/c this isnt around for me to buy all the time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful deep brown with a foamy medium brown head that leaves chunks of lacing on the glass. Smell is sweet chocolate and bourbon with a touch of coffee. Taste is mostly chocolate with some coffee with the bourbon all in the finish. This has a heavy body, but is not boozy though there is a pleasant warming from the alcohol. Overall this is the best bourbon aged beer I've had and was well worth the trouble it took to hunt it down."
""
"One word...SMOOTH. Everything layers into the other. The bourbon, coffee and chocolate all mold into a mellow bouquet of flavors. Seriously a world class stout and a world class beer to boot. Well worth the wait and so glad I have 4 left t enjoy over the course of the year."
""
""
"Overall: I don't know that any beer can live up to the hype that surrounds this or the work that it can take to obtain a bottle. With that being said, it's still a world class beer and worth seeking out."
""
""
"A giant in the category, the best I have had so far. I am curious to see how Dark Lord tastes in comparison."
""
"O - This has a much more roasty taste than anticipated. Flavors are excellent. Mouth is incredible. As in, I don't think it can get any better. Aged fruit makes appearance after substantial warming. This is MUCH different than Black Note and BCBS- but in my personal opinion, not as good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is mostly of coffee with hints of vanilla, chocolate and bourbon. The mouthfeel wasn't as thick as I thought it would be and although the alcohol was very noticeable, it wasn't as overpowering as BCBS. I have read some reviews that have people rating this beer better with a year's age on it. I will put a few bottles away and see what has happened to them come 2014."
"I am still a major fan of Founders, but even with the high ratings that KBS gets, its just not the one for me."
"Overall, the 2012 was way better. Much smoother, much more developed flavor, less of a sharpness, and smoother. I will definitely be aging my other 2013 until next year."
"O: religious, sexual. interesting that the roasted malts stand out the most after a year. tastes like discipline."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a tulip glass....Jet Black with minimal to no lacing. The smell is very coffee forward with a hint of Oak and Vanilla. Taste, there is a bit of bourbon up front; as this warms the bourbon is more noticeable, coffee comes up as well as a bit of vaniila and some chocolate. Alcohol is certainly well hidden. Mouthfeel is very smooth. Awesome beer!"
"O- I was more impressed with the smell than the taste. I will have to try a fresher bottle to compare."
""
""
"O - From personal preference, I dont see eye to eye with Imperial Stouts, this does have some great flavors, and is incredibly smooth, the 11.2% is masked almost completely, but it tastes like nearly every other imperial stout i've had. I'd much rather take your average stout against this, but I've had it."
"1st review! Might as well start with a big boy. Had this puppy alongside a bourbon county. Honestly, the bourbon county blew it away. Not to say the KBS was at all bad, it was delicious. Great blend of chocolate and coffee with good lingering taste. Good mouthfeel. Not flawless but would be nitpicking to mention anything serious... I thought it would have a more complex taste but still absolutely delicious. If you find this rare gem, pick it up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This and BCBS are the stouts that I covet. I feel lucky to have been able to get a 4 pack my first year looking for it. I'll make sure to take off work in future on KBS day to land some!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, definitely a solid stout, unfortunately, I don't think it belongs on the top 10, or even the top 20 beer list. The bourbon was nice, but the vanilla undertones weren't pronounced enough. Hate all you want, but FIS and Siberian Night were both better than this."
""
""
"You really had to try and find something to thats NOT fairly perfect about the beer.. For an RIS its much much all you could hope for, though it does have a few slight drawbacks in its drinkability considering the boozeyness which becomes reminiscent of sort of an after-dinner liqeur and the weight of it which develops.. its almost like a milkshake towards the end.. Its not a solid 5's across the board, but its definitely an A+"
""
""
""
"Combination of chocolate, bourbon, coffee at forefront. Not overly complex. Drinks like a milkshake. Mouthfeel is awesome with low carbonation and nice aftertaste. Alcohol smell very very prevalent but no alcohol burn. Incredibly delicious. Cant wait to try it with a couple years of age. Lives up to hype."

"Overall: This is definitely one of the best beers I'll ever drink. Upon tasting the original breakfast stout, there was no doubt in my mind that KBS could and would top FBS. I hold both on a pedestal and I love the fact that there are big differences between the two. I believe Founders did a great job making KBS and FBS stand by themselves. It would've been quite easy for Founders to just throw FBS in bourbon barrels but they didn't. I'm glad they did because it would've been quite easy to view FBS as the base beer of KBS, but since Founders brews a completely different stout for KBS it allows us to appreciate both for what they are. Barrel aging and adding coffee to their beers are what Founders does best and KBS is a prime example of this. This is a top 5 beer, but it might be my personal all-time favorite."
"This really is the top top tier of the ever-growing world of coffee/ barrel-aged imp stouts. Beautifully balanced, burly yet perfectly drinkable. And really really delicious..."

"O - I was actually not expecting to like this beer as much as I did. The barrel aging does not contribute a heavy bourbon flavor to the beer (if I wanted bourbon I would order bourbon). FBS is still the top double imperial stout for me, but I can now understand all the hype and rush to buy this beer."
""
""
""
"o- my son was able to get his hands on four bottles of this great stout and I""m afraid I'll be craving more , has to be in my top five. I recommend this to everyone ...but... I'm not sharing, sorry"
"Finally got myself a bottle of KBS. I won't go on too long, because we all know the hype is real. Can't compare it to past batches (I've read this year's batch is slightly different than previous batches), but this beer absolutely blew me away. Nose was a bit timid, but decadent and perfectly balanced. Taste is spectacular and really showcases the rich chocolate and vanilla from the bourbon barrels without being overpowered by alcohol. So amazingly smooth and silky. Planning to snag another bottle tomorrow - it's that good."
"It's been a long time a coming, but I finally got to drink this beer. And believe me, it was worth the wait. While it starts out with a pretty forward bourbon taste, it really mellows and balances out as the beer warms. If I could make this beer stretch out for an hour, I would. But it tastes too good not to drink it on down. I have a bottle that I might age a bit, but I'm not sure I can wait. This was rich and delicious from the start, but it only gets better as you continue on. Wow."
"O: Well worth the hype!!! A+"
"Really happy I got to pick up some of this. Absolutely a must try if you like stouts at all. The complexity is incredible."
"O-Absolutely exceptional. Worth the money I paid for, however the bourbon presence was a touch too strong. Very complex and smooth, and I wish i could have bought just more than one."
""
""
""
"Not my favorite BBA RIS by any means, but still a nice treat on this first decent day of spring in NY. Nice and chewy, a decent blend of coffee/cocoa/bourbon. It's really too bad that this is so limited. I think that's why this one is so damn hyped. A damn fine RIS. Plenty of other better ones that are easier to find, but if you've never had it and have the chance, by all means grab it. I'd love to try this on tap sometime. That must be something else altogether."
""
""
"I was excited wife scored a four pack for me. Not gonna go through a full review. I had it smelled like coffee and alcohol. But the taste I just couldn't take it. It taste like bourbon spiked cold coffee. And I don't like coffee. Don't take this wrong I know coffee notes are part of having a stout but usually chocolate is too and didn't get that anywhere in this beer. If ever have again it would be one and done, then go onto another beer. Sorry but this beer is overrated, Or maybe not just to my liking."
""
""
""
"O - A lot of people comare this to BCS, but to me it's a whole different animal altogether. You can tell that this isn't just a bourbon aged stout with coffee added, it was made with those flavors in mind, producing an extremely well-balanced beer that retains the complexity through every last drop. I was worried that I was too hyped for this beer, but it proved itself worth of the rarity and praise it gets. One of, if not the best beer I've ever had."
""
"O -Superb offering from Founders. Does it live up to the hype? Yes. Does this dethrone BCBS as my favorite BA stout? No. It will be interesting to age for 6 mo or so to let the coffee subside just a little bit. It was definitely more prominent than my pallet is accustomed to, not going to say this is a bad thing, just different. I had 2011 BCBS coffee around Christmas time and I would prefer KBS over that, I have not had fresh BCBS coffee though. Makes me want to bust out my 2012 now for a comparison. This was well worth the effort to seek out. glad i have 5 more bottles to savor!"

"Revision after second tasting 4/28/13: Compared side by side against breakfast stout and drank over the coarse of 1.5 hours. After about an hour the beer reached a temperature which allowed all the oaky, vanilla, bourbon nuances to emerge. The flavors also seemed to blend and harmonize. This brought the taste and overall score up for me and I recommend this sampling technique. Overall, every bit as good as breakfast stout with a little more flavor that tackles a slightly different style and both can be thoroughly enjoyed depending on the mood of the drinker"
""
""
"12oz bottle. 2013 Vintage. Pours a pitch black color with no head. The aroma is a nice big whiff of bourbon with some coffee and chocolate. Earthy with hints of vanilla. The taste is bourbon upfront followed by coffee and the chocolate. Fairly hot. Vanilla near the end with a mix of coffee and more bourbon. Dark chocolate aftertaste. Surprisingly drinkable. The bourbon presence is fantastic. Heavy mouthfeel. This one was a pain to get a hold of but I'm glad I finally landed one. I'd say Goose Island Bourbon County and the recent batch of NebCo Bourbon Barrel Aged Stout Trooper are better than KBS. That being said, this is still a fantastic beer I can't wait to have again."
""
""
"O: pretty much everything I had been expecting, a phenomenally deep and well balanced beer from the geniuses at founders"
""
""
"O: There are alot of people trying to do big oak aged stouts, alot without success, but that is not the case with Founders. This is a very drinkable big barrel aged stout, that will probably improve with a little age, but is also quite good at this age. Too bad it is so damn limited."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Yep, it's KBS, it's rare, it's delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- After trying many barrel aged stouts this year, (bcbs,bcbcs, peruvian morning, cwbbs, parabola), this falls in the middle of the pack. Nothing spectacular for me, but still a very solid beer. Something everyone should definitely try once, but if you miss out on it, don't feel too bad."
""
"Overall-I've been waiting for this one for awhile and I must say I'm not disappointed. It reminds me a lot of founders imperial stout in feel, which isn't a bad thing. It's hard to get but I have a feeling with all the expansions coming to their brewery product should increase. While its not the most bourbon forward beer out there (founders own backwoods bastard is more bourbon forward) it is the most balanced barrel aged beer. 4.75"
""
""
"O - I am enamored with this beer and don't regret a minute I spent pursuing it. I am so grateful that I got to try it."
""
""
"This is absolutely a 'must-try' beer in my humble opinion."
"Overall: Easily (and unsurprisingly) worth the hype. KBS is everything you might have heard it is. It is worth the day off work that people take to hunt it; it is worth $20 per four-pack; it is worth the race to the liquor stores in a fifty-mile radius around you. Nearly everything about this beer is perfect. This is the first bottle I have ever had of it, and it was absolutely worth the wait. It is worth trading for if you missed it this year. Bottom line, as mentioned way too much in this summary: KBS is worth it, whatever “it” may be to you."
""
""
""
"Overall - Incredible. I was expecting to be let down, but it lived up to the hype completely! I feel the balance of bourbon with the other stout flavors is much more refined than with BCBS (a beer which i absolutely LOVE). The only thing BCBS has on this beer is the mouthfeel, but KBS wins in every other respect. Just incredible."
""
""
""
"O- After trying to get this beer for 2 years. My time has finally come. This beer lives up to the hype. A well blended and surprisingly balanced stout, It remains bold in the flavors and goes down ever so smooth. Love it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours midnight black with a mocha head that dissipates pretty quickly to a thin ring around the edge of the glass. Aroma is of roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and sweet bourbon. Huge notes of chocolate and coffee up front give way to sweet and then bitter bourbon note that coats the mouth. This is my first KBS, and here is where I think Parabola edges this beer out: at this point Parabola explodes with a huge chocolate malt creaminess whereas KBS seems to fade out on the bourbon note. That being said, while it doesn't exceed my expectations of this super hyped beer, KBS at least meets them."
"O- Very good stout but not worth the price tag. Great buzz after one beer, it will make you take back things you never stole"
""
"This beer isn't doing it for me this year.  I noticed a fall off last year as well but I'm noticing that the big in your face flavors are gone.  My taste buds going away?  Possibly.  Other close friends have said the same thing.  It's no longer a beer I actively seek any more.  I'll try it and be done with it.  My rating is going down for this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A solid, enjoyable beer. Well worth the $19 for a 4-pack that Founders charges. But I can't say it's worth the massive upcharge that most local liquor stores in the Chicago area are charging. This bottle cost me $7.99 + tax. I can get 4 regular Breakfast Stouts for just a few bucks more. That's a no-brainer. If you can find a single bottle for $6 or so, it's well worth it!"
""
""
""
"I love bourbon. I love stouts. I love barrel aged alcoholic beverages... which includes bourbon, scotch, wine, and so many other drinks. I love this KBS. But I struggle to reconcile this drinking experience with anything I've had before... which is probably besides the point. This is a very enjoyable beverage. It comes off as heavy and cloying at times, but it is a brew for a specific time and place and although this is my first time drinking this, I am a fan. Big, not terribly elegant, but delicious."
""
"Finally got a bottle of this at Martha's Vineyard in GR. Served in a pint glass. Poured an opaque brown-black color with two finger widths of tan head. Great lacing on the side of the glass, Smell is mostly coffee and chocolate, but with notes of bourbon as well. Taste is remarkable, starts with a heavy burst of coffee and then follows with bourbon flavors, but it all fades quickly, leaving virtually no aftertaste. This really helps the mouthfeel - this is a full bodied beer but it feels light on the tongue. Very different from the regular breakfast stout from Founders, very unique flavor, absolutely delicious."

"Shout out Dommys Pizza in Vandergrift, Pa! Aged a year on top of barrel age! Poured a opaque black color with a coffee head that came late and fizzled quick. Smell is heavy on bourbon with some vanilla that is trying to get through. A lot of alcohol present on nose. Tastes a lot better than it smells for sure. Smooth and toasty coffee and bourbon shine in this special selection. Roasted malts stick to your tongue while the bourbon warms the sides of your mouth. At 11.2%, I thought I would have trouble getting it down but that was not the issue. Mouthfeel is thick and warming and flavor is popping everywhere. Overall a lot better than I thought for high gravity stout. Tons of robust flavor with some whisky reminding you to drink it slow!"

"What a huge stout, tons of things going on, and a beautiful display of how bourbon-barrel aging can turn beer into a work of art. KBS was an excellent beer, and while I certainly think it might be a *touch* overrated in the sense that there are many other ""just as good or better"" beers of the same type that aren't nearly as hard to get your hands on, it's still a fine beer, regardless - there's no denying that."

"KBS pours blacker than black with next to no head. There is a ton of bourbon in the nose, along with a strong roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and some vanilla from oak. Smells great. But the real judge is on the tongue where KBS really shines. The barrel and the base beer are in absolutely perfect harmony, letting enough of the bourbon barrel shine through to flawlessly compliment the notes of the stout. Everything works in lockstep all the way from the strong vanilla-bourbon start to the roasty, oaky and slightly boozy finish. The mouthfeel is rich and velvety, with just the slightest tickle of carbonation, and the drinkability is exceptional. Overall, a superb barrel aged stout that is masterfully aged and blended. Highly recommended."
""
""
"Beer pours tar black with about one finger of dense brown head. Head dies fast and leaves a nice sticky lacing. Smells unbelievable. First sweet chocolate, which hit hard. Next, bourbon (and a lot of it). Finally, dark coffee and a little black malt. Phenomenal nose. Flavor is rich, complicated, and smooth. The attack is sweet and bourbony. Almost no heat, but I know there is plenty of alcohol hiding. There is a huge coffee flavor and a little bit of vanilla. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, medium-low carbonation, and extremely creamy. I wish there was a little more bourbon, a thicker mouthfeel, and a little stronger head/retention."

"Why even reveiw this beer after soooo many have done it before, and have agreed over and over that this beer is nothing less than incredible? I couldn't help myself. I won't waste my time descibing this beer's perfection. If you get your hands on this magical brew, just take the time to caress it. Sleep with it on your pillow for a few days. Practice beer abstinence a few days prior to having this baby. And in return, this beer will reward you with one of the best beergasms you'll ever experience.. Enough said.."

"This is my first KBS and I have a few left to rifle through. Anywhoo, overall this is top-notch. Being critical though--I did not pickup cocoa on the palate and the alcochol, not the bourbon, is a bit distracting for me. Also, the aroma was very intriguing, that kinda did not come through on the palate. I find BCBS a touch more complex overall. Nonetheless, I would definitely keep this in my rotation at all cost and I look forward to seeing how it ages. A very splendid stout indeed!"

"Had this beer many times, so I figured it's probably time to review it since it's one of my all-time favorites. This is the 2012 version. Super thick, jet black pour with one finger caramel colored head that fades pretty quick but with excellent lacing. The nose is simply amazing! One of the greatest smelling beers of all times. Dominated by the bourbon, but not far behind are the roasty coffee, chocolate, and oak along with hints of vanilla and booze. The taste is just as stellar. Perfectly balanced with the bourbon, coffee, oak, and chocolate once again the stars. Hints of toffee, vanilla, and dark fruit round it out nicely. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy and smooth as silk with a wonderful subtle, warming alcohol burn on the finish. The influence from the barrels is absolutely amazing. Huge woody character much like I get when drinking a good oak aged wine. Overall, this is as close to perfection as you can get for the style. And it's consistently spot on every year. Truly world class from the best brewery in the world!"

"O: This is a beer that has loads of character and depth. There's some really huge chracteristic tastes battling for recognition and I'm a bit impressed that they pull it off as well as they do. But I would say the coffee tends to dominate a little too much and alongside with the alcohol being able to see it's way through this maze of tastes and smells I would not rate this a fiver. I would appreciete a tad more subtle chracters for it to blow my mind completely. Still a world-class beer that's very memorable."

I think it is unfair to try and compare FBS and this beer due to how completely different they are. Both are two of the best beers in the world for very different reasons. Founders is the gold standard of Stouts in my opinion. Don't call it hype anymore, this beer is just that good."

"O- I don't get it...all the hype and not even close to FBS for me. I don't like all the booze here. An IPA and a snifter of B&B would please me much more. I feel that my ratings could be even lower, but the rest of BA can't be wrong. I gave it every chance, oh, well."

"O - The benchmark, by all other beers should be judged. Many have tried, but no one has come close to Founders barrel aged beers. The first and probably only perfect score from me. A true classic. Worth all the hype and then some. Cheers !!!"

"KBS poured a deep, dark, thick, jet black with virtually no head. Vanilla, bourbon, and touch of chocolate fill the nose. I could smell the bourbon when opened the bottle. Thick mouth feel that coats everything it touches, but extremely smooth. Bourbon heat up front then, then vanilla, all balanced with some sweetness. Overall a great beer. Founders does some of the best barrel aged beers IMHO and KBS doesnt disappoint."

"Honestly, I think I appreciate this beer more as I've tried so many others. I feel that all the other bourbon stouts hit you with tons of bourbon taste upfront. And what separates this from the others is that somehow Founders creates a very even taste all the way through. When drinking the other top bourbon stouts it seems like it all hits you at once rather than creating a unique balanced flavor. There may not be a wide variety of flavors here, but the ones that are here are so craft-fully blended and there really isn't another beer I've tried that can accomplish this. World class, and this is the reigning champion of the beer world as far as I'm concerned. If you really separate yourself from the hype and concentrate on the beer, I defy anyone to find a bourbon beer as well balanced as this. It's worth the drive to Michigan for the release every year."
""
"O- I can't say it failed my expectations. Pretty much what I expected after having Backwoods Bastard a few times, and being a BIG fan of regular Bfast Stout. An excellent beer in every sense."
""
"This is how a BA stout is made, it is amazingly balanced and hides the ABV pretty well."
""
""
""

""
""
"O: this beer is amazing... Delicious at all stages of its lifespan... As I have been lucky enough to drink several vintages over the last three of so years. It seems to me I like it best at about 6 months old... When the coffe has mellowed enough to really let the burbon shine through. But at the same time i do miss the coffee now that it has fallen off. A great beer no matter how you slice it..."
""
""
""

"From the Smell to the Mouthfeel, it is all Coffee and bit bitter dark chocolate. very subtle bourbon here and there is a slight creaminess. no alcohol presence so it drinks quite nice. But this years doesn't cut it for me."

"O - A fantastic beer that tastes similar to a CBS, less the maple syrup."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Everything I ever hoped it could be and more. I'm really can't wait to try it fresh and see if some of the bourbon burn and coffee bitterness are more present, or if the same flavors I'm getting now are just brighter. Kind of hoping for the second option, as having one of these sit in my cellar for a year would test my will power."

"Poured into a DFH tulip. Beautiful jet black with almost no head. The nose is a hint of bourbon with the sweet dark chocolate coming at the end. I have some 2010 and 2011 in the cellar, but I wanted to see how a 2012 would do 9months after bottling. And what do you know, it's amazing. Just the perfect amount of bourbon gives way to dark chocolate notes, followed by notes of oak, vanilla and toffee. Such a smooth velvety mouthfeel. Just wow. I love every bottle of this beer I drink."
""
""
""
"This beer poured dark brown/black with some nice lacing. It smelled like bourbon and vanilla, which was what I was expecting. However, the taste was simply amazing. So smooth and alcoholic. It reminded me of sipping some fine scotch. I was pleasantly surprised. Founders really wanted to emphasize all the deliciousness of the imperial stout. If you are looking for a coffee, bourbon, vanilla tasting beer, try getting this. It really worth it!!"

"T: Where can I start. Fresh, it's got a huge bourbon blast at the start. If you like the bourbon portion of BA beers, then enjoy this fresh. Bourbon is complimented nice with the traditional cocoa and coffee flavors so familiar in traditional Breakfast Stout. Aging it will produce probably the best flavor I've experienced in a beer. There are so many things to compare it to. At six months, I've used the words milkshake, chocolate milk, Jamocha Shake from Arby's, etc. It's such a wonderfully balanced ale at that point even though the bourbon has dissipated slightly and still packs the whopping ABV punch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pitch black color. Aroma is full of dark scents including chocolate, coffee, vanilla, a hint of bourbon, dried fruits, and quality alcohol. Flavor is just like the nose. Coffee, chocolate, vanilla, dried fruits, bourbon, and quality alcohol. Hop bitterness is present and in balance with the rest of the beer from beginning to end. Very smooth, very drinkable, delicious. I am going to drink this one slowly and enjoy it!"
"Wow! Not a stout fan but this beer is fantastic! Taste is excellent for dinner or breakfast or anytime before or after. Mouthfeel is very smooth almost like drinking breakfast milk. If you have the chance to try this - go for it!! Now if I could get my hands on some CBS!!"

"O - 4.5 - This is a mature beer, and no pun intended. It's a grown-up stout that doesn't lean heavily on syrupy sweetness. A number of the big stouts are like drinking pudding, which I like a lot, but which can make them seem more like rare, special occasion beers. And sometimes they really make you work, making you go slow lest you be punished with too much intensity. This one is robust and rich yet with a drinkable body. You still want to sip it because of how well it is made, but its body and balance put it more in the category of normal beer that you'd like to have anytime, not just when clearing out the schedule for a special occasion, even though it's definitely special. One of the top 5 beers I've had to date. 2013 tasting - Very nice, very enjoyable, very mature, very distinct, very memorable. It's one of the top beers for good reasons. The coffee fades over time and it seems to come across thicker with more age. Still one of the best and most memorable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of my favorite beers of one of my favorite styles. This really did live up to the hype and I can't wait to get my hands on another. Next time it will be drank on Christmas eve by the fireplace with dreams of sugar plums and bourbon casks in my head."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A very tasty beer and one that is well worth a try. While it is fantastic with its wonderful roasty and bourbon flavors its reputation precedes it some. I actually think Founders Breakfast is more balanced then the Kentucky. While with this said however, the Kentucky is definitely a beer to try if you have the chance."

"O - An incredibly balanced and flavorful imperial stout. The mix of bourbon, vanilla, and roasted malt give this beer a very distinct and pleasurable flavor. I wish this was available year round."
""
""
""
"I've had this on-tap and in bottles, both fresh and aged one- through three-years. KBS' defining characteristics drop significantly the first two years, leveling out by year three. I usually prefer beers like this aged, but for me KBS is best fresh as it becomes just an average barrel-aged beer the older it gets."

""

"Overall this is a very good beer. Smooth, balanced and complex with a high enough ABV to make an impact. It can live up to the other whiskey/bourbon barrel aged stouts I've had and it certainly confirms to me that this substyle of the imperial stout is one of the greatest things in beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The pour is a thick black with a nice dark brown head that dissipates to a small head with tons of alcohol legs. The aroma is a deep roasty richness with bourbon, oak, chocolate, and tons of coffee rushing to the nose. Big aroma that hints at a decent amount of alcohol heat as well. The flavor is not as big as the nose, but it is just a beautifully well rounded beer that touches nicely on the vanilla oak bourbon and chocolate before going to all coffee on the finish. Really enjoyed this, though it wasn't a top 10 or so beer I've ever had. Still that is a silly standard to hold this too, and I really enjoy this one."
""

""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas."
""
""
""

"O: had 2-3x in the past on tap but this was the 1st time bottled; perhaps because it had some additional age (no way to tell at this point) this was even better than remembered. An excellent big beer; very rich and complex, and a bit boozy in manner most may find appealing."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste of this beer is heavenly! Vanilla,chocolate,prominent bourbon on the back end with deep expresso notes..There is a warming effect much like whiskey on the way down to your stomach. There is quite a bit of boozieness to this beer which is expected with the high abv...This beer has more than a hint of Bourbon to it, it tastes like the barrels were filled with some whiskey before the beer itself was poured in to age..This is a huge beer and i personally love every aspect of it! Founders does it again!!!"

"O: One of the best beers, period. The complexity and balance of flavors along with the strength is just stunning. It's got sweet and bitter elements. Bourbon melds in perfectly. Super creamy and smooth and the drinkability is insane for such a big beer. The only beer I've ever had better than this is CBS, which just had better lacing and legs and a slightly more complex flavor with the maple. Any stout fan should make it a point to seek out this beer, it's THAT good. If you get your hands on this, drink it fresh. The flavors are slightly sharper and even better. I will have to add an aged review at some point as well."

"Poured very dark to a wine glass, a fingers width of tan head slowly dissipates. Smell is slight bourbon, Some roasted coffee, and Vanilla. Taste is great, so well balanced and delicious. Vanilla, caramel, bourbon, oak, chocolate and coffee.. Everything you think you'll taste, you will taste. Super easy to drink with a rich coating mouth feel. Looking forward to trying a couple aged variants in the coming months."

"Missed several opportunities to get my hands on this beer. Finally found it at a new bar tonight. Ok beer. Would rather have a CBS, Founders Imperial Stout, Founders Breakfast Stout, Hoppin Frog Oatmeal Stout, Stone Imperial Russian Stout, Old Rasputin, ect. KBS gets a lot of hype, but seems everyone out there is just conforming to popular opinion. Tasted like a bad bourbon. There are much more enjoyable stouts out there. Definitely did not live up to the hype."

"Overall KBS is a superb example of what a bourbon barrel stout can be. This bottle is about 5 months old and I feel the flavors have mellowed a bit. I enjoyed the fresh bottles ever so slightly more. the bottles on date is smudged and I can only make out 02/../12. Either way the coffee and bourbon blend together to create a profile that everyone should try."
""
"O: This is a very, very hyped beer, and after trying some, I can see why. Luckily, I live close to the brewery and have a generous brother-in-law who gave me this bottle, as, although it's fantastic, I'm not sure I'd go through the hassle some do to get it (I personally don't want to go through that hassle for ANY beer). That being said, I don't want to minimize it as it's probably the best beer I've had to date. Founders again hits the nail squarely on the head!"

"overall this is a solid barrel aged stout. i have no complaints. i can understand what the hype has been all about, finally! however, i do recommend that the people who can't get ahold of it - try their luck with some central waters peruvian morning or bourbon barrel aged stout if they like this style. it's hard to say which is better - but this kbs reminded me a lot of them."
""
"Wow. The darkest pour I think i've ever had, almost zero head, so hardly any lacing. Smells very strongly of bourbon, chocolate, and herbal extracts. Taste is incredible and quite strong, definitely one you need to take slow. You can taste coffee, chocolate, at first - then malt and bourbon, especially in the aftertaste. The flavor profile has several evolutions in your mouth and the mouthfeel is thick and balanced. Its a little less sweet than their Breakfast stout, though more complex. It was pricey, though i'm very glad I got it, this is one of the last bottles in MI. One of my all time favorites, can't wait for next years batch."
""
""
""
"O: Definitely enjoyable, but I'm not sure I like it more than something like Peruvian Morning."

"O - This beer is one of the best, it's so sad that it is so hard to get. Founders once again does an outstanding job with an outstanding brew."

"Taste-Ahh, where to begin? Bourbon bon-bons, silky chocolate, Irish coffee with cream, all perfectly blended, with a ghostly minlging of hops in the balance. Super-smooth and dangerously drinkable. ""Tingly"" mouthfeel lets you know something good is happeneng here. Superbly crafted, sip slowly and try not to smile. Makes you warm and happy. Believe the hype. Wow! Profound."
"O: This is one of the best BA stouts I've had. Will seek this again."

""
"KBS is definitely not as sweet as CBS but it is very good. Doing a taste side by side really magnifies the sweetness of the CBS."

"#BOTG 67! A pretty special one...2012 KBS! My triple header ending of tonight, something to sip on for sure. Poured from bottle into my CBS snifter. Pours a pitch black motor oil thickness, brown tan head that bubbles up like a tarpit from the glass. Beautiful. A tan ring settles around the circumference of the glass. Smell- amazing. Sweet molasses, caramel, honey, chocolate. Just absolutely decadent. Maybe a little bit of cinnamon. Taste- buttery caramel, molasses, spicy tobacco reminds me of Red Man from my HS baseball days. Sweet bourbon, espresso roast finishes the end. Wow. This is absolutely mind boggling good. This is so smooth, the bourbon flavor is absolutely present, but this shows no booze at all. I'm glad to have had the chance to taste this (thanks Eric!), and will seek it out again. World class, lives up to the hype. This is a home run, a perfect 5.0."
""
"WHALE ALERT!!"
""
""
""
""
"KBS lacks the sweetness of CBS, but is great stout in its own right. Unlike some in this mold, this stout is more than malt with a hint of whiskey. The myriad of complex flavors make this a reference point for others that follow."

""
""
"originally reviewed: 03-18-2011"
"o: This is a sipper, if only to enjoy all the nuances. A great beer and one I'm glad I had a chance to try. Kudos to Founders. That being said it's not the holy grail it's made out to be sometimes."

I'm, obviously, absolutely impressed, and will be looking forward to opening my last bottle for some special occasion. In the mean time... anybody reading this who wants to hook a brotha up with a bottle or two... give me a shout. I'll give up something good for it!"

"What a glorious beer, delightful, dessert like, excellent complexity and stellar quality."

"Good dark brown color and tan head not much head but as expected due to the barrel aging. Great rich sweet aroma that definitely smells like molasses and caramel, slight hint of bourbon. Flavor is amazing, great balance, sweet, complex. Chocolate mixed with caramel and coffee, ever slight oak/smoke to it that just makes the balance perfect. Not much hop to this one :) Fantastic bourbon and malt pairing, one of the best."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Im no fan of hard liquor but if I was burbon would be my choice of poison, just love the influence the burbon barrel aging on beers, especially a hearty stout. The alcohol is no slouch here, a heavy hand helping that compliments the thick viscose stout nature. Burbon and burnt chocolate works well together delivering a blast of bitterness to the taste buds. One bottle is memoriable, fulfilling, and worthy the wait."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have been hunting this for years - and finally got to try it at the Holy Mother of Gatherings! It pours a deep, opaque sable with a thick, fine-bubbled tan head. Rich aroma has notes of molasses, caramel and semi-sweet chocolate. Flavor is DEEE-LISHUS! Smoky with tones of quality coffee, molasses, chocolate and caramel, and a hint of - is that bourbon? Thick, smooth texture is quite fizzy."
""
""

"O- Lives up to all the hype. If you can get your hands on this try it."
"The notes were in fact muted but I liked it a lot."

"M:"
"O - This is a delicious brew; especially if you like a forward bourbon flavor. Quite the sipper that gets better and better as it warms from 45 degrees to room temperature. Interestingly, the more it warms, the more it leans towards a rich, chocolate flavor. Get it if you can. On-tap is extra good."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very impressed with this beer, I almost like it as much as BCBS 2010. I loved it overall, I would drink this anytime no matter the season. The flavors all go amazingly together and its funny but I swear I feel the alcohol after one beer. Great Job!"
""
""
"Overall: Finely crafted with a bold aroma and taste. The strong abv and noticeable scent had me expecting a much more boozy beer, but it was super drinkable. I want to get my hands on a bottle with a couple of years of aging and have it go toe to toe with BCBS."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
"I really enjoy this beer, but I can't help but feel like it's a little bit unbalanced. The bourbon really dominates. Of course this is my first beer of the style, so keep that in mind, but the bourbon is really intense."
""
""
""
"Overall: I prefer CBS and FBS over KBS and I wasn't as blown away as I thought I would be but this is still a world class beer and one of my favorites ever."
""
""
"Drinkability: If I had to trade breakfast for liquid for the rest of my life, all I would drink are Founders KBS, CBS, and regular breakfast stout. Such a smooth well mixed beer."
"A bourbon aged beer done right. Not sure if it's as good as the hype suggests, but a very good stout."

"A great breakfast sipper. Would gladly trade for more."

"Pours near black with a small foamy head. Decent lacing for a high abv. brew. Aroma of coffee, bourbon, vanilla and a bit of chocolate. Taste is much the same, with a touch of alcohol. Full body. Rich and creamy with a nice bite. The bourbon doesn’t over power anything in this. I got a bottle and held on to it for a year, Damn good beer."

"More of a chocolate, coffee, and vanilla bean taste compared to the bourbon I remember from last years batch. I can feel the alcohol earlier then I remember. Lots of dark chocolate in the nose."

"Another great beer from Founders!!"
""
"O: This beer is good, no doubt. My problem is with the bal presence. Here's the thing, if you want to have a coffee beer, have a coffee beer. If you want to have a BBA beer, have a BBA beer. If you want to have a BBA/coffee beer, learn to balance them. I can't say I will pursue this as aggressively next year. It's just not that great. Good yes."

"O: This beer is outstanding. I would go out of my way to find it."

"O - Brilliant beer that is well worth the hype. Stop reading review and buy/trade/find this beer. All-time favorite. ""5's"" in categories are reserved for the best, and this grabs a couple."
"Will be looking to see how this one tastes with some age on it."
""
"2015 has improved on the mouth feel but every other quality seems like it has taken a step back. Drank this following a Weyerbacher SMS, and it's just not as good. Definitely a little more bourbon than the SMS, but for a beer advertised as brewed with coffee and chocolate, definitely lacking."
""
"Beer pours a pitch black with a medium tan head, more head than it's non-barrel aged little brother. Smell is just incredible here, the bourbon takes center stage, but it's mixes fantastically with oak, coffee and chocolate to make an amazing aroma. Bourbon, oak and vanilla really stand out in the flavor here with the coffee really taking a back seat (especially compared to the original). It's got a nice chocolate-y finish and is extremely smooth. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, I've actually always felt this beer was a little overrated, but this particular bottle that I'm reviewing is excellent (maybe it's always been excellent?). It's a little more bourbon-forward than I remember, and I wonder if that's a product of drinking the original next to it. A great beer that really blows away most of the brewery-only whales that people go nuts for."
"D - World class, alcohol is tucked away nicely."

"O: I'm not sure why it's QUITE so well-rated, but it's a solid Imp Stout. I think I've had better, though."
"O: A nicely balanced imperial stout. For such a strong beer, pleasantly drinkable. This is one of the best RIS I've had. However, RIS is not my favorite style so my ratings reflect that."

"12 oz. bottle, February 2012 batch. Rich black pour with a fairly small, dark brown head. Nose is rife with vanilla, bourbon, wood, sweet molasses, espresso, and semi-sweet chocolate, along with some rich chocolate ganache. Flavor is heavenly, with delightful chocolate truffle, dark chocolate and cocoa nibs, roasted coffee, vanilla, almond, candied pecan... just outstanding. Rich palate but with quite nice carbonation. Awesome stuff."

"Very nice bourbon barreled stout, well balanced and complex. Not a 5, but close. I have probably been ruined by Peg's G.O.O.D. Rare D.O.S."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled 2/17/2012. Re-rate from last year. Pours thick pitch black color with a small 1 finger fairly dense tan head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some slight spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla, molasses, toffee, espresso, roasted malt, bourbon, and oak. Fantastic aromas here with great balance and good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, caramel, molasses, vanilla, toffee, espresso, bourbon, roasted malt, oak, biscuit, and slight herbal hops. Almost no bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, molasses, oak, and roasted malt on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance, without the bourbon being too overpowering; and no cloying sweetness at all. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with an insanely creamy, slick, lush, and super smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol is extremely well hidden at 11.2% with only a slight warming after the finish noticed. Extremely easy to drink, but is still a sipper. Overall this is definitely a world class barrel aged imperial stout. Big balanced and robust flavors; with an incredibly smooth and lush mouthfeel. This is definitely at it’s best when fresh."
"Overall I really wish I had the beer on tap, other than that nothing I would change about the beer. Its great when a beer exceeds the hype. There were times when drinking when I was thinking is this coffe, beer or bourban? Keep it up Founders."
""
""
""
""
"Pours near black with a one finger dark beige head. Light lacing present. The aroma is a mixture of bourbon, coffee, chocolate, with a hint of vanilla. The taste is much like the aroma with slight bourbon upfront, coffee and chocolate join in and a smooth finish includes bourbon and a slight roasted malt and espresso bitterness. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. KBS is truly a work of art. A classic and unique brew that is a worthy representative of the best that American craft breweries have to offer."
"O: Awesome (but not the best)..."
"O: This is the standard for bourbon barrel aged stouts for a reason. Differentiating factors include the strong coffee flavor profile and the amazing balance. One of the very first beers that lived up to the hype for me and well worth the effort of tracking down."
""
"This is a must for beer geeks, but certainly not for the casual observer. My only recommendation is (as I have read) that this beer is to be enjoyed poured in a snifter glass at (or just below) room temperature. I'm certainly happy I have a few more bottles on hand to savor."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm very glad that I was able to re-visit it and have a few to sit on. This is one of those beers that you wish you could drink all the time, but you're almost glad that you can't. It would take away from the beer, in a way. Anyways, totally awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I was happy to get a few of these and tonight decided to finally try one. I was very impressed with the strong roasty aroma which I found to be a complex blend, the likes of which I have never smelled. There was a ton of barrel in this one, with the bourbon and oak flavors dominating. The complexities in the flavors developed as the beer warmed (although it started at ~55*) and I enjoyed it more and more with each sip. It is an amazing beer, but not my top beer ever."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Wow, this is one amazing beer! Lots of layers and lots of complexity. The bourbon and coffee flavors really compliment each other and make this beer dangerously drinkable at 11.2% ABV."

"This beer is truly a work of art, is all I have to say! Simply amazing beer! (my first perfect score!)"

"O: This is a beer I've been waiting a long time to try.  I was like a kid on Christmas opening up the trade package today and seeing the big ""KBS"" letters.  Even with all that hype and expectations, I was not the least bit disappointed.  Is it my all time favorite stout?  No, I think that still belongs to Peg's Rare DOS, but its neck and neck with the Abyss for number 2.   A world class brew.  "
""
""
""
"I have a bottle of 2011. I will give this a shot soon."
"O- It is a complex and flavorful big stout. Great silky smooth mouthfeel. It is a good beer with a little more heat and alcohol flavor than I like in a beer. I would love to have an aged bottle on this, but for the rarity and price I am not sure I will seek this out every year. There was not much coffee taste or aroma in this beer."
""
"http://instagr.am/p/JF_SQ8SgLy/"
""
"Overall, amazing beer. This is a great example of how a great beer can vary between serving types. Excellent for both ways. Leaning towards the bottled version more because of the prevelant bourbon notes."
"A full-bodied, delicious beer, one you have no excuse not to drink. Go get one."
""
""
"O- One of the best. Although I do feel there are better, even within founders own line up, KBS is a beautiful stout every year. The traditional flavors that one expects in a barrel aged stout are all present and well represented. I will and always have been a fan."

"o - great beer that does live up to the hype. even after sitting on this one for 2 years it was more boozy than i thought. i think 5 years of age would be about perfect for this beer. i like goose island's bourbon county stout (since those 2 are compared so much) just a little bit better."
""
"Overall: I do not read any reviews before writing one, I don't check number nor anything else I just buy a beer sip a little and already have in my head what I think about. I think you and most real beer drinkers will not be disappointed. This beer is a true beast, an animal in it's own right. Complex, strong and incredibly satisfying. Salud!"
""
"I'm not going to camp or pay $50 for a bottle of this but I wouldn't think less of someone who did. This beer is one of a kind and is simply amazing."
"Great drink. A+. Thanks, Maximum12. Also, since you are not a huge fan of this, you are dumb."
""
""
""
""
""
"Feels packingly-full with light prickle from the carbonation and light burn from the alcohol. Sticky sweet, like a glaze upon the lips, but the feel and the swallow are smoother than granite. A lovely sipper."
"O-this beer is very very good and lived up to the expectations. Just a slight bit boozy for me but still delicious."
"O: Overall, great beer. I am glad my husband did a trade for this. As much as I love Abyss and Darkness, so glad to have tried KBS and even more glad we have two more bottles! :)"
""
"O: A truly awesome beer. This is an excellent campfire beer. I need to compare to a newer version because I am curious if it comes across as well integrated when it is new. One of my favorites for a number of years, I am surprised I never reviewed this before. Anyone who likes stouts and bourbon should have this at least once."
""
"This was a fantastic beer. It has a great mouthfeel, a robust, intense flavor, and is absolutely enjoyable."
"O. A very very good beer that I wish was more available and a little bit lower in price, but it is a must try and get it if it is available."
""
""
"Poured into a 16 oz snifter. Pours the most amazing black, with a half inch, of patchy head, with some spotty lacing. Smell roasted coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, and some molasses, in the nose no bourbon yet. Taste is that, extremely balanced, with a hint of the bourbon in the taste, but very well blended barrel aged stout. Body is thinner than you would expect for its size, nice amount of life for its size, a little dry, and very drinkable. This is amazing and perfect for my 200 review."
"O - Great stout as all the reviews say. I think I would prefer this with 1-2 years on it as the booze is a bit overpowering right now but not by much."
""
""
""
""
"This is really great. The coffee comes through nicely when fresh."
"The body is full and robust. Very silky and smooth with soft carbonation. Overall this really is to tier. Really tough to be this stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"A bourbon, booze forward sipper of a stout. The chocolate and coffee come out as the beer warms, and it evolves constantly as you drink it. A nice bourbon barrel-aged stout, though, a bit too bourbon heavy for me...will be happy to age a few and see how they end up."
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A pretty sensational stout from Founders. One of my favorites to sip on after a long day or after a great meal, it makes for a fantastic desert beer. The barrel treatment adds the perfect amount of flavor and warmth without hijacking the beer."
""
""
""
"O: A delicious stout. All the typical offerings from a bourbon barrel aged imperial stout done really well."
"Pours black, with thin off white head. Smells of strong bourbon and slight black coffee. has a good feel on the mouth a bit of carbonation but not much. taste of bourbon very apparent and very pleasant (if you like bourbon.) leaves mouth warm almost like taking a shot of whiskey, almost as if someone dropped a shot of bourbon in my stout! The a.b.v. is not masked at all even after a year of again it's still pretty hot!! leaves a very dry after effect on the palate."
""
""
"Great sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the full package and I'm impressed that this isn't a bourbon bomb like so many others. The chocolate and the coffee are then free to express themselves on equal footing."
""
"This was very underwhelming. It appeared very thin and taste quite one-dimensional. I will know not to age this anymore.. :("
""
""
""
""
""
"Still a great Imperial Stout and may really benefit from another year of aging. I was able to get six bottles and dont plan on touching another one until next nov/dec at the earliest."
"M- On the tip of the tongue you get the chocolate, the sides of your tongue are taken back by the coffee and bourbon mix. The aftertaste is a hint of bourbon, like one would get from a bourbon on the rocks."
"Overall: completely lived up to the hype, overall just an amazing beer so glad I got my hands on a bottle."
"This beer was pretty much what I expected it to be: gone far too quickly! The flavor is wonderfully tantalizing and complex and demands that you sip in complete silence with your eyes closed (!), yet the beer is so smooth and well-balanced that I had to fight the temptation to take huge gulps. While the nose was not as pronounced as I anticipated, the taste more than met my expectations. This was the very last beer in Founders' regular, seasonal, and specialty lineups that I had never tried. As such, it marks the end of a wonderful beer journey that every beer lover should try to make. Thank you Founders!"

"This is a very good beer in it's category."
"That being said I will still seek it out every year. Next year I just wont try as hard."
""
""
""
"O: This is just amazing. Delicious, creamy, layered, and very easy-drinking. Its hype is very much justified, though I wish I could get more."
""
"O: worthy of the hype: if you're lucky enough to get your hands on one, a must have. I was lucky enough to acquire 3. This stuff ain't for sharing."
""
""
""

"T/M: Initially I taste nothing and notice mostly a subtle and smooth texture, it then blossoms richly into tastes of chocolate and malt with an alcoholic bite at the end"
"Wonderful beer! This one of the best I've ever had in my life!!!!"
""
""
"O - If it wasn't so hard to find and Founder's made more batches, I'd make this one of my go to stouts. This is now my new favorite bourbon barrel stout. It is crucial to let this one warm up to about 50-55 degrees to experience the full range of flavors in this beer. It has a great mouthfeel, is complex and as balanced as a bourbon barrel stout can be given this beer styles strong bourbon flavors. I look forward to next March and will hopefully be able to pick up a 4 pack before its all out."
""
"O- this beer lives up to all the hype it is given. It is definitely one of my favorite barrel aged stouts!"
""
"overall: its beers like this that make founders the best BA brewery in the country, hands down. i look forward to having this every year in march, and every year i am not let down. its too bad it was very hot off the shelves in bottles this year, but im very glad i got to have this on tap."
""
""
""
""
"Drinking two bottles back to back...a 2009 and '12. Lucky me! First time trying what I've considered the holy grail of stouts. Both pour black holes. Flavor profile similar between the two. Huge chocolate/nibs. Smell the coffee in both but just picking up a bit of iced coffee in the aftertaste (and my burps). Nice bourbon layer in both, much smoother in the '09. Both go down well, the '09 is much mellower and doesn't carry the slight bitterness of the '12. The '12 is a little alcoholic, the '09 went down sooo smooth, almost too easy. The aging flexes itself nicely. Of course they are both fantastic but a little aging does benefit the style very well. It's making my ears pop. Get it if you can."
""
"O: I friggin love it. I love stouts, I love higher ABV imperials. I love bourbon too. This beer is fantastic. I really wanted to not love it, the hype, the hard to find, the price gouging. This beer is flat out great. It's everything rolled into one and just works. I would bathe in it, and still drink it."
"Bottom Line: If you see it...buy it! World Class!"
""
""
""
"Being a fan of Goose Island BCS I might be a little biased against this, but its still a well done brew. I just wont go through the trouble next time. If its there when Im there I'll buy it, if not, so be it...."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"my recommedation would be make it thicker, more available, and in 4 paks everywhere and i would get one every year. but i wont have one again until that happens."
""
"One of the most balanced BA beers there is. I get more wood and whiskey alcohol flavor this year than in the past 3 years. An absolutely brilliant beer but what was once an immaculate example of a Bourbon barrel aged beer is now only a bench mark for these categorically extreme beers."
""
""
""
""
"O: I have never been a huge fan of bourbon barrel stouts but this one is very drinkable. the flavor of the vanilla and chocolate really come out as it warms making me like it even more. the bourbon is still there but just adds to the warming."
""
""
""
""
""
"(side note, drank this in a bottle the night before and I must say its more richer and thicker in bottle form!)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a monster of a good beer and is right up there with the CBS. It may be hard to appreciate if you don't love a good imperial stout, but if you do then it is entirely worth seeking out. Another extremely well-crafted brew from Founders."
"Phenomenal, I can't wait to crack a bottle here in the near future and see how it compares."
""
""
"O- Absolutely perfect. Had to force myself to take this one slow and really just savor this one."
""
"O: One of the best Bourbon barrel aged stouts that I have had to date. In my opinion this beer stands much higher than CBS. I felt that all of the flavors mended together extremely well; all of the ingredients are showcased in such a well balanced manner. Despite the strong chocolate character in the nose, I felt that this beer was perfect, hence the score I gave it."
"O: Sweeter than fresh with the chocolate a little lessened and with the coffee all but gone. The upside is that the bourbon dominates the back to finish in an outstanding way. If I'm looking for a bourbon-y stout, I'd go for an aged KBS. If I want totally integrated choco-coffee stout with the slightest hint of bourbon, I'd go for fresh KBS. If I want a bourbon-dominate beer, I'd go for BCBS."
""
"In conclusion I found the beer to have an amazing aroma and a damn good taste when fresh. Great coffee and bourbon notes. The mouth feel was a bit too thin for me though. At a year old its lost most of the coffee flavor but has retained that coffee bean bitterness. Seems like its at an awkward phase in its life. At two years old all the coffee has left the building as well as that awkward bean bitterness. Its become a delicious sweet chocolate stout with bourbon notes. Similar to BCBS but with a lighter body. Two years seems to be the sweet spot for this beer aged. I don't think I would go through the trouble of aging it though as it seems to defeat the purpose of a Kentucky breakfast stout."
"This was simply an experience. Had on tap at spring beer fest. Poured a viceral inky black with a small coffee colored head that was gone in seconds. Scent was overwhelming. Huge vanilla and bourbon notes, flooded my nose. Taste was a remarkable balanced blend of vanilla, bourbon, char, and some butter baking chocolate. Bourbon was the dominant element. Mouthfeel was smooth, creamy, not too thick. Not much to critique here, world class."
""
"O - This is definitely one of my favorites for imperial stouts. The bourbon has a strong presence, which I like. Not too sweet, very well balanced, one of the best beers I've had."
""
""
""
"Update: I'm still drinking the same beer and suddenly realized I needed some water. I never needed a chaser for a beer before :) I recommend it though as it refreshes the taste buds and improved my enjoyment of this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Always love when this beer comes out every year. The increase of quality bourbon beers in our market has slightly diminished this beer's value but it is still true to form."
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle……..and on tap later in the evening"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't really wish to put down a highly regarded beer but I feel this one is very overrated. I think it is unbalanced and tastes more like someone dropping a shotglass of bourbon in a stout. I could almost not notice the coffee or chocolate properties because of the overwhelming bourbon taste. I know most won't agree with this but it was a drainpour for me."
"For comparison, I had saved a bottle of Backwoods Bastard. The BB is sweeter, lighter in color, and not as big. It really isn't fair to the BB to compare it to KBS, but if you want to know what KBS is about, there is no substitute."
"Very drinkable maybe not sessionable but I could definetley have another one. In the end is it worth it? I would say so very happy to have tried both on tap a few years ago and now bottled. I do prefer this one on tap."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers"
""
"Alright. Now hitting up the 2014 version at the Tipples Rare and Barrel Aged Beer Tasting on July 13, 2014. Current year's version. This is coming off much better than any other KBS I have had. Lots of coffee on the aroma, chocolate, and even vanilla. The flavor is much more bold on the coffee, vanilla, and chocolate than previous vintages I have had, and the bourbon is not as harsh. Creamier mouthfeel, and plenty of body to this one. Really nice and the rating here is now for this vintage."
"This is my first time having this beer. I'm not sure if it lives up to the hype, overall, it's is a great bourbon-barrel stout."
""
"O: This is a really fantastic stout. Very balanced and smooth, really great thickness and carbonation... drinkability suffers a bit from the barrel character, but this is still a great beer."
"Taste was great. A little boozy, but very balanced. I don't really know what else to say about this...if you can get it, give it a shot--you won't be disappointed!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Well it is the famous KBS, much hyped, although not as much insanity to acquire as CBS , BCS and Bourbon County Coffee. Managed to get my hands on some, despite avoiding the price gauging of other unnamed establishments. I believe it to the best best stout I have ever had. Mountains of complexity, bourbon, oak, coffee, vanilla, awesomely smooth and delicious, but not overwhelming on the palate in terms of mouth feel . easy to drink, could have it everyday. it has so much going on but not that intense, giving it a nice smooth taste with so much to savor. I hope founders lives up to its promise and produces 3x as much for 2012."
"For me this one lives up to the hype and more. I see the similarities between this and original Breakfast stout, but this one just takes it to the next level. The bourbon is so subtle in its application, and only accompanies the other flavors already present. For me a perfect beer."
""
""
"O-As good a beer as I've had. I'm partial to all things bourbon barrel aged and this is as good or better than any. KBS is worth the effort and wait to get it."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall - don't read this, get this is you can. Founders did it again...between GI and Founder's barrel work, theres no need to move from the midwest! Stunning world class beer"

"Cheers to KBS! To Founders! What a beer."
"O: This ball is outta here!!! I think I could only drink one due to the viscosity, but without question; this is thee greatest beer I've ever had... peroiod."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is way overhyped. It just doesn't strike me as anything more than a slightly above average BA imperial stout. It was my first real ""top tier"" BA stout a couple of years ago, but either it's gotten worse or I've had a lot better. 2014 just isn't doing anything for me."
""
"O- This is a pretty fantastic beer, definitely lives up to the hype for me, one of the best bourbon aged stouts I've had, I could seriously live on this stuff."
"Overall, almost as outstanging as I remember from previous tastings. The only thing I might adjust a bit is the alcohol. If it were slightly lower in alcohol content there would be less burn and the sweetness would come through more however, this is true to the style with the alcohol warmth and the strong roasted malt and coffee flavors. There really is no one flavor that overpowers the others. This is just as good as everyone says, absolutely worth a try if you're lucky enough to get some."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A much better beer than it was 12, 9 & 6 months ago! I remember it as coming across too hot and hiding many of the flavors. But this really is an outstanding stout. If you see it on tap, drink it now. But if you have a bottle, age is what truly makes this shine. "
""
"It's unique. I can't honestly think of another beer to equate this with. Musty oak with mellow bourbon, ground coffee, medium chocolate... it doesn't really get muddied up with the other nuance flavors that sneak into most beers like this. It's the coffee, the chocolate, the barrel."
"Overall: A really nice beer, but honestly I’ve had better bourbon imperial stouts. I wish I had bought more so I could have aged this for another year, that could have mellowed out some of the harsh edges. Worth the hype? I had better have a few dozen more before I decide."
""
""
"Overall: I waited in line for a while to get some of this in Atlanta and was only able to get 2 bottles, but having had it 'm grateful for what I was able to get. Absolutely outstanding."
""
"O - I was looking forward to trying this with some age on it, and it has held up very well. One of my favorite beers of all time, and it probably always will be. I'm mad that I drank it too quickly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a GREAT beer, but not my favorite that Founders puts out. I guess it does beat any other barrel aged stout that I have tried to date though."
"KBS is an amazing beer, but honestly I enjoy Backwoods Bastard a bit more. Mouthfeel is great; smell is full of chocolate notes, coffee, and beer. First taste is fantastic, but the alcoholy burn at the end is what pulls the score down for me. I wish I could've gotten a bottle to age it a bit, however I'm glad I could experience the last keg of KBS of the year"

"O - This is one hell of a great beer....but I have a hard time with the fact that it is so hyped up. I actually prefer the breakfast stout to this any day of the week. I wonder if it wasn't so limited in supply if it would be so hyped up? Do you get the people that see that it is so highly rated and feel that they have to judge it that way just because they are supposed to? Don't get me wrong, I think it is incredibly smooth and would keep this in my regular rotation (if supply permitted), but I just don't see the hype surrounding it. Founders marketing folks are absolute geniuses."

"O: I prefer a bourbon barrel aged stout with heavier notes of vanilla and caramel. This was more bitter than expected and kind of disappointing (especially after waiting out for 13 hours for 12 bottles of it). $5/bottle...."

"Drinkability – Just a bit too much bourbon to be super drinkable, but it's a great bourbon beer nonetheless."
"O: To my surprise I was not as impressed as I thought I would by. Do not get me wrong, KBS is a top notch BA stout that I would love to have again, but the hype may have let me down on this one some."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A fantastic beer that really hides the high ABV very well. I look forward to this beer every year in the late winter and this year again it does not disappoint. Great complexity to the smell + flavor and a great balance between the sweetness + bitterness in the flavor. I wish I could get this one more easily."
""
"O: An incredible beer, but then again, with real cream and full fat, what's not to like. I am pleased with the barrel ageing aspects of the beer, and I'd like to explore more along these lines. I love Palo Santo Marron, and this easily ranks in the same class."
""
""
"O - Easily one of my favorite beers out there. I could drink this all the time. Definitely worthy of its huge score. And then, there is CBS, which is just slightly better."
""
""
"2012 batch is awesome!! This was bottled 2/17/12. This will be a hard beer to beat! Way to go founders for and amazing batch!! Thank you!"
"Overall, this a terribly good beer. Honestly, I was a little let down after hearing so much about this beer. That being said, it is still among the best I've ever had."

"This beer was so well balanced, and while there wasn't anything specifically complex about the taste, it was unbelievably satisfying. This is as good as it gets for an imperial stout IMO. As a side note, while I enjoyed the BCS along side it, KBS blew it away. It's pricey and hard to find, but well worth every penny."
""
"Edit (5/4/12): I had a relatively fresh one to compare as my last review was a year+ old KBS. The coffee is obviously much stronger in the fresh one, though a bit raw and bitter. Not quite enough sweetness to balance the strong coffee flavors, I prefer this one with some age on it. I normally like my coffee forward imperial stouts fresh, too. Still a delicious beer no matter the age."
""
""
""
""
"O-another great RIS from Founders with great flavor and balance"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer, but really expected a creamier mouthfeel and a thicker stout than what it was. Taste was spot on, as the mingling between the sweet malt combined perfectly with the bitter hops and espresso towards the end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm revisiting this beer and remember why it was the first high end craft beer that really turned me on to the culture. Man is it good! and the 11.2% ABV is nice too. This is the highest score I've given to a beer so far."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Low carbonation with a silky smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The depth of flavor on this brew is unmatchable. Very well rounded and bold. This is one of the best beers I've ever had. Incredible!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Incredible disappointment here... Not to say it was bad, but I was led to believe this was something mind blowing, rather it is a pedestrian BA beer, which sadly let the bourbon take over (maybe it was just this year's blend, who knows... BCBS is definitely better than this and I enjoyed Boulevard's RIS more too..."

"O: Quite simply, if not my favorite beer, this is one of my favorite beers of all time. Every time I drink it, I am blown away. In all honesty, if a brewer can make a better beer than this, I don't believe I have had it. Deserving of the all the hype and praise it receives. Founders absolutely kills this barrel-aged imperial stout."
""
""
"Overall it's a great beer. Nowhere near CBS IMO but I'd be happy to have this in stock at all times."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Is this 11% ABV?! It's so very well balanced and smooth I couldn't tell at all. This is probably one of the best beers I have ever had. Absolutely could not fin anything wrong with it. This brew does nothing but a whole lot of right! Cheers."
""

""
""
""
""
"overall i really liked how the flavors really faded from one to another and played off each other"
""
""
""

"O - This is hard to beat. I love all of the stouts that Founders makes. Getting that great Founders stout experience with a little bourbon thrown in is really a treat. I truly savor every drop of this beer each time I have it."
""
""
""
"Jet black colour, one finger of dark tan head, some lace around the top of the glass. Smell is of roasted malt and coffee, bourbon, vanilla and oak, chocolate both milk and dark, fudge with some nice bittersweet notes. Taste has a big roasted malt flavour, bourbon follows close, oak, vanilla and chocolate, roasted coffee beans, nice build up of flavour here, chocolate and vanilla aftertaste. Lush mouthfeel, light carbonation, full body and quite silky. This was simply outstanding stuff, incredibly complex but nice balance of flavours, this is with out a doubt one of the best imperial stouts I have ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer deserves all of the accolades it gets. Can't wait to get some more this March."
"O- There are always reasons for people to go crazy over brews. Factually, KBS deserves exactly that. This warming imperial stout takes some many different properties and creates an unbelievable tasting experience. KBS is hands down the best stout I have experienced"
""
""

"Founder's is awesome"

"I'm not going to break it down for you, describing all the intricate flavors and complex tastes...no I'm just going to tell you to go out and find some, try it, love it. The 4 pack I got came from eBay. My best bud tracked it down and paid $15 a btl...so that's $60 for 4 12 ounce bottles of this stuff!"
""
""
""
"O: FBS is better. This being released how it is and in the quantities it is, I wouldn't seek it out again."
""
""
"Overall: Good, but not great. This is the second bottle I've had and I haven't been impressed either time. (I wanted to give this a second chance since I first had it when my palate was a bit less far along.) I suppose it's fair to mention I don't much like FBS for the same reasons as mentioned above, and I can see how people would like both of these for their their balance. But I would search for Founders Imperial Stout instead."
""
""
""
""
""
"O. A good beer, but I liked the '10 a lot more. The evening I had this, we did a full flight of KBS from '09-'11 and I feel like the more you age this beer, the more the tobacco comes out. Fresh it is a little hot, but I believe the '10 is still my overall favorite of the most well balanced beer. A good beer and always worth a try whenever you can get it."

"I am glad I was able to attend the 4th Ave. Pub's tasting of all the Breakfast stouts. The CBS was still a bit boozy for my tastes, but he KBS fit my bill a bit better. It looked like a solid imperial stout, with a very dark, almost black body with a thin dark tan head. It smelled of bourbon, vanilla, roasted malts. All in good portions. The taste was great, but I missed the maple that CBS had. There must be some perfect middle ground for the smoothness of KBS, and the sweet notes of CBS. Maybe my perfect Founder's beer is the yet to be released Curmudgeon's Better Half. I am very interested in picking up some bottles of this and seeing how it ages. Overall, kudos to Michigan, Founder's, and the bourbon barrel, who without this beer would never be possible."

"O: This is definitely the great beer that the hype would suggest it is. Add in the fact that it is ~$4.50 a bottle, and you have one mighty fine value. Just a pristine example of a bourbon-forward BA stout."

"Perfectly balanced and really drinks like a 6% stout. I couldn't ask for much more except some more Kentucky bourbon. This may take away from the balance though. Simply delicious!"
""
""

"Speaking of Whiffs! The reveal: KBS. Wow, did not pick up the barrel or bourbon at all. I have had this beer many times and have always enjoyed the boozy, bourboniness. Thanks again Alewatcher for another fantastic beer! This beer was either perceived completely different from any other time if had it or this was a batch I've not tasted."

"A Dark and Darker, 1/2"" solid head, legs too. Rich This pours a black-ruby complexion with a thin lacing of foam on top. It has an aroma of toffee and espresso, with a bit of smoke. It’s tasty, with some smoked malt, lots of dark chocolate and dark roast coffee, sweet bourbon notes and a long, smoothly boozy finis"

"Overall, what can I say, this is a great beer. The flavor profile is obviously great and second to few. The problem is how hard it is to get this beer now-a-days. Beer geeks are stalking this like it is the best beer on the planet, which I do not think it is, so unfortunately I will only be able to sample this via trade or trade extras going forward. I sample CBS a few nights ago for the first time and I can say I enjoyed it more because the sweetness helped to balance the coffee bitterness that I found to be slightly (slightly) too much for my tastes here. Is this great, yes, recommended, yes, a necessity to check off your list as a beer geek, yes, is it my favorite, not by a long shot, but to each his own."
"2011. I had my doubts about thia one before i tried it, but it was awesome! Very dark, thick as mud. Complex and easy to drink with lots of complexity. Plenty of vanilla from the barrel ageing, not to mention some licorice flavor. This is a sip and savor beer for even the most hard core beer drinker. This is the type of stout I love trying and there are few of them. Well done, and cant wait to have another."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the best, if not the best, beers I have ever had. The combination of the ingredients is flawless. Huge coffee notes with the chocolate and bourbon give such great flavor and feel to this beer. A shame it only comes out once a year. Will always buy this beer, as much of it as I can."

"Overall, like everyone else, I absolutely love KBS. When fresh, I love it for the coffee elements that blend with everything but it's almost a little hot for me out of the gate. At 1 year, though, I think I prefer it more overall because it is not as hot and the bourbon/vanilla notes are significantly smoother and have melded well into the beer. You can't go wrong either way, but I would rather have this with a little age on it."

""
""
""
"O: Fantastic imperial stout - Founders has done a great job balancing all the flavors to create such a robust stout. Finishes very smooth, I feel like I could drink multiples however at 11.2% it might get me into some trouble!"
""
"Overall: This is just a great beer. I highly recommend it."
""

"Overrall. Really nice beer here. The flavours are all nicely balanced and just a hint of sweetness which makes this beer fairly easy to drink despite it's enormity. Then again, why would you want to drink it any fasster than you would have to? This one is to be savoured."

"Pours a jet black with a small chocolate head. Good lacing on my snifter glass. This beer is definitely a black hole, and looks fantastic. The nose is sublime. Espresso, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, and cigar smoke is what I get in the nose. Super smooth (probably due to age), and simply perfect. I wouldn't change a thing. The taste is out of this world! Bourbon, vanilla, bourbon barrels, coffee, cigar smoke and chocolate is what I get. This beer is really complex, and just a pure dream to sip on. I don't get any of the alcohol either, other than a tiny bit on the aftertaste. Feel is perfect. Full bodied, and so smooth you can't believe it. Great balance of dryness/maltyness. Overall, this is as good as it gets for the style. Thanks, Matt for the opportunity to share this! Cheers."

Was able to get this at 3 Floyd's Brew Pub, to my surprise. I went there for all their beers, but had to try this one before all the others."

"Pours a thin pitch black with a quickly receding small beige head. Smells of bourbon and booze dominate as much of the coffee has long faded. First taste is heaven – with bourbon and dark chocolate and a big splash of strong coffee all blending to make one of the finest beers ever. Thin bodied but well carbonated. The excellent carbonation makes up for the thin body to combine for an overall great mouthfeel. The 11.3% ABV is well hidden. What a great beer!"

"100% guarantee...This will always be in my top 3 beers ever!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I think this was actually a bit dissapointing to my tastes. I don't think I was expecting so much bourbon flavor. To me it's the dominant characteristic of this beer. The roastiness and the mouthfeel are inarguably top notch, but they are in a distance second...and that faint dustiness in the aroma is offputting. I would consider this a hybrid of an imp stout and a scotch ale. I'm not trying to be a hater, cause I LOVE Founders, but this is just slightly better than Backwoods if you ask me."

"Overall: Very subtle for a huge barrel aged stout. Lots of interesting spice and roasted malt notes. Easily drinkable."
"The hype around this beer is pretty well justified. As it comes to room temperature more complexities emerge, with a warming bourbon kiss on the finish that's quite nice and doesn't overpower the other flavor characteristics of this beer."
"Appearance is opaque black with a nice lacing of tan head. Aroma is immediately bourbon followed by vanilla and caramel. Taste is of caramel, bourbon and mocha. Mouthfeel is thick, resinous and viscous. Overall a great bourbon barrel stout that i wish i could try on tap."
"12 oz bottle courtesy of myspoonistoobig. Thanks Michael. Pour a black that is cola brown at the edges when held up to the light. A small light tan head disappears pretty quickly and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma chocolate, coffee, some roast, bourbon, and some light char. The coffee is still pretty strong. The initial taste is sweet chocolate, followed by coffee, some light oak, bourbon, and a little bit of char. The finish has a decent bitterness to it and leaves some lingering coffee flavors. Medium body. Relatively low carbonation. This is a very good beer, but there are several barrel aged imperial stouts that I enjoy more."
"This might be the best stout I have ever tasted. The beer pours black, with a short lived mocha head that leaves a little lacing. The smell is vanilla, bourbon, coffee, chocolate and cream. The taste is similar to the nose, but with the wood from the barrels shining through.The mouthfeel is full and rich, with just enough carbonation to give it lift. Overall, a stellar example of a bourbon barrel aged stout."
"Just opened a bottle of this that I bought in June 2010 and split it with a friend. I found this to be even better now after some time has passed. The smell and taste of the beer is much better overall I think. Just a great beer for sure."
"This is a delicious stout, it did not disappoint. I can understand why people look hard for this beer and I'm happy to share it! Next on my list is the coveted CBS, which will come eventually to complete the ""founders stout series."""
"O: I'm not happy with the amount of booze heat there is in this stout. In my mind after a year or two this could turn into a truly amazing beer. Parabola at this same age had a lot more smoothness to it's character and so itstill ranks higher for me but overall a great beer.."
"Now this is my third year on this beer. I swear it'll change. I swear I'll change. I thought taking notes on it this year for review would change my opinion some, scrutinize something. It seems as though something will happen, and I'll be jaded. It doesn't. It hasn't. I really tried to not rate it with 5s across the board, but what can you do? I really couldn't help it. This is The KBS."
"OA: I need more of this. Brings warmness to the cold days to come in the winter. Not nearly as over powering bourbon like some others but is gooodddd."
"D/O: The barrel treatment is a process that is all about refinement, where value is added to a product. Amongst barrel-aged stouts, KBS is a relative bargain even after emerging from the oak, but its qualities appear amateurish at times, compared to its contemporaries. Flavors find themselves mostly at odds with each other early, but become passably simpatico during the latter two acts. Challenging textures in the mouth do not help, yet there is still something appealing about it--compared to bourbon it is basically the same taste, but easier to tolerate for the non-spirit drinker. I can appreciate why this profile would appeal to so many, and it does qualify for an extreme candidate of the sub-style."
"This isn't really a very complex beer, but damn is it good. I'll let my other bottle age for a bit."
"O- I can see myself dropping an entire paycheck on this beer once it becomes available in the spring. The best beer I've ever had in my life so far"
"This a real nice stout with lots of big flavor and nice subtleties. If it wasn't so expensive I would revisit this more often."
"o: very impressed with the balance of this beer. i was expecting to be doing shots of bourbon but this is so much more."
"O) I have not consumed many barrel aged brews, but I found his to be quite enjoyable. I can understand now, why this is such a sought after beer. I've had folks tell me the alcohol is hardly detectable in KBS, however I would disagree. I found it quite detectable, but not in a negative way. Again, this may be my own inexperience with barrel aged stouts. In the end, this is a pretty complex brew, that is well put together, and a pleasure to drink. After one bottle down the old hatch, I'm feeling pretty good, and pretty relaxed. Looking forward to cracking one of those bottles of CBS. Thanks Founders..."
"O- Bought 2 single bottles, 1 each from two different shops back in April or May?? Initially did not understand the hype. After 7 months, I think the somewhat aged bottle tastes way better?? Kind of tired of the Founders hype and lack of availability...but this stuff is DAMN F-ing tasty!"
"Edited a third time as a result of drinking this multiple times over the course of two days. Side by side, it's better than Black Note."
"Taste- wow. The sweetness of the bourbon blends beautifully with the chocolate and slight scorched butterscotch tastes. From sip to swallow, a wonderful experience. This is a must taste for any big stout drinker."
"This one's a profound ale -- swirling with big, definitive, and distinctive flavors. An ultra-sensory experience, here. Wow."
"Very nearly black with a quickly dissipating head, minuscule lacing. Wonderfully dark, dense and gentle, not blatantly upfront about any of its 11%. The wood, vanilla and coffee are all here, well-balanced and mutually coalesced. Yes, the appearance and mouthfeel may be somewhat lacking - both are, ultimately, perfectly reasonable, just spartan and slack - but the taste makes this a non-issue. It is well-rounded, extremely drinkable and elegantly indicative of its various components. An almost ideal Imperial Stout."
"I'm glad I have a couple of bottles laid down for later. It was worth the trouble to get it. It is funny that I had to get my brother to bring me bottles from Philly when I work around the corner from the brewery."
"O: Very good. Extremely good. If I could get this in a 4 pack at my local beer spot this would be quite dangerous. Kudos to Founders!"
"O - One of the better imperial stouts out there, could maybe use a little aging."
"M - so smooth, low carb, minimal alcohol burn..."
"O: An amazing beer. Ages very well. I look forward to it's release each year."
"Overall, I have to say as much as I enjoyed this, I actually prefer the original Breakfast Stout. The bourbon seems to overbear the subtle nuances that are more apparent in the regular variety that make it my personal favorite stout, but this is still certainly a world class beer. Cheers!"
"O - Just a great brew that more than lived up to expectations. I haven't been surprised by a beer's complexity like this since Veritas 009."
"I love this beer so much I can't stop drinking the homebrew clone that tastes exactly like it. It's so well balanced, it is well worth the hype. The bourbon aroma and notes add such a great complexity, but are so well hidden that the ABV is quite surprising to be so high. Can't imagine how good this would be if you let it sit for 6 months or so. The body is nice and thin which pairs well with the taste. This is worth the effort to find a bottle even though it's becoming near impossible."
"O: totally get why this beer is so highly-rated. It comes out once a year in limited quantities and then its gone. Buy whatever you're allowed to when you get the chance."
"O: Great beer, I'd like to keep a few to drink occasionally. Very accessible, goes toe to toe with the FW beers and Bourbon County amongst others."
"O: A+ rated beer. It's definitely a sipper on a cold night or in this case one for the night cap. But I'd drink this year round, if I could get my hands on more!"
"Poured Deep black"
"Served on draft into a 10 ounce snifter glass. Body is dark brown, teetering on black with obvious brown highlights. Thin tan head forms a ring once it settles out. Big bourbon, wood, coffee, chocolate, vanilla and roasted malt on the aroma. Same on the taste with lots of bourbon coming at the end. Lots of chocolate and coffee are the focus but the wood aging adds nice layers of complexity. The feel could be a bit thicker but overall this is easily one of my favorite bourbon barrel stouts."
"O: Let this beer warm up! I served it a bit cold, but its transformation to cellar/room temperature was a pleasure. It's true that they say this beer is dangerously drinkable. It lives up to it's hype. It's complex without being overbearing. Its flavor is smooth and well-rounded but diverse and really takes you on an adventure. 11.2% ABV? Could have fooled me. Now, how to get more..."
"Get some. Store some. Drink many."
"O- Unbelievable. I had only tried current-year KBS on tap and this blows it away. It starts and finishes with an unparalleled deliciousness. Now I can't wait to open my bottle of 2009 that has been taunting me for over a year!"
"very very good. not as much bourbon as expected. very smooth with excellent flavor."
"O: I prefer stout with less burnt character but this is very good, super smokey, unique"
"O: My favorite RIS, just beautiful."
"Overall: This beer is fantastic. I love the way that the bourbon is so well integrated into the base beer. It's just near perfectly barrel aged. Great stuff...I need more. Thanks Adam!"
"O: This stuff is fantastic. Not much else needs said, this beer sets the bar very high and many don't come close. I just wish I didn't feel like Arnold in Jingle all the way when this comes out; Founders causes mayhem."
"O: As many before me have said, this is a fantastic beer. Certainly one of the best I have ever had the pleasure to taste. Seek it out and drink it up over and over!"
"This beer is a terrific, well crafted RIS. Definately one of the better examples of the style. Founders has achieved just the right bourbon presence while still being amazingly drinkable. Good stuff."
"D: pretty easy to drink. A complex bourbon-centric beer that somehow smooths out the rough edges I often associate with the style. Further proof that Founders is among the nation's elite breweries."
"O - An incredible beer that I am glad to have gotten a hold of. I had worried from the aroma that it might be on the sweet side, but Founders have done an excellent job in achieving a perfect balance. I'll be searching for this after the next release, I'd love to see what a longer time aging this would produce."
"I've waited many days to drink my bottle of KBS and it lived up to the hype! Outstanding imperial stout from one of my favorite breweries. You can count on me in line on KBS Day next year!"
"Pours a thick solid black with a thin off white head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is heavy on the coffee as would be expected. I also get some chocolate, tobacco, ash, and dried fruits. Complex aroma really, but heavy coffee. Taste hits with roast then chocolate, and then comes the coffee on the attack. Finish with some vanilla, and some bourbon that is oh so subtle. Awesome complexity!! Creamy full bodied mouthfeel. Excellent brew, I wish it was more available! Another well done brew from founders."
"This is the beer that sets the bar high for all others to follow. Sublime in every way, I hope they continue to brew this for years to come."
"Pours black as hell with a finger width brown frothy head that didn't stick around for long. Light moderate lacing. The smell upfront is bourbon whiskey and butterscotch with coffee, and sweet creme hints. Smells rich with dark chocolate aromas. Tastes bourbony too! Also, lots of coffee and chocolate flavors. Light vanilla flavor but I didn't get much oak. Espresso! At times the sweetness is a bit much. Tastes rich like a fudge brownie. Feel is fairly viscous. This is great!"
"O: Excellent double imperial stout. I'm very impressed with this beer and extremely happy that I tracked down a case of it earlier this year."
"This was a beer that I was very excited to finally get to enjoy! It was dark and full of complexion. But not overly powerful as some stouts can become if not aged appropriately. This was a wonderful beer. Great Aroma. Nice smooth mouth feel, creamy almost. Just a delight!"
"Overall - I am very impressed with this beer. Some people might crucify me for saying this, but it's not my favorite bourbon barrel aged beer. With that said, I really do like this beer. I can't imagine the bourbon flavors have faded a bunch since bottling, but I'd still like to have this really soon after bottling. Either way, I completely enjoyed this beer. It's fantastic, complex, and just one of those beers that everyone should try. Thank you SO very much to Tom/trxxpaxxs for sending this to me (among many other goodies) in the N00B BIF 5! Unbelievable generosity on his part!"
"O: Wow. Not over hyped one bit. Meets every expectation I have. Just lovely. Heard it only gets better with age. Don't really know how that would be possible, but luckily mwcullnane sent me a 4 pack so I have one for the next 3 years. A must have for any beer lover."
"This beer does deserve a lot of hype it gets but if I were you stay away from the 2011 vintage, I feel it is lacking."
"A standard bearer of the style, it's a shame this has become a hassle to procure in Boston. I was so happy to send my bottles off this spring, and only now can I see the folly of my ways."
"Overall: If you can, buy it, if you can't trade for it."
"Overall this is one of the best beers I have ever had, and the 12oz format makes it that much better. The only problem is I don't think I will have enough to make it until next March!"
"O: Pure bliss. Not overwhelming. Not too big. Didn't even notice the alcohol. 5"
"Overall this beer is worth all the hype and all the praise. It's a great sipping stout for a cool night, and I'm glad I got to try it this year, having had my first FBS back in January. And perhaps I'll be lucky enough to try CBS in the bottle this year too..."
"One of the best beers I've had in my short beer drinking career. A truly great stout that I'll be savoring as it warms up a bit in my glass."
"O: With about a year and half on this one in the cellar, it is holding up quite well. Things seem to be leveling out a bit and finding a smoother balance. It's hard to think of improving on this. Just the best barrel-aged stout I've ever tasted."
"Overall- I think only one word can describe this beer; amazing! It deserves all the hype and score that it has here on BA, this is easily one of the best stouts in the entire word. Everything about this beer is absolutely stunning, from the initial kick of the bourbon in the tastes balanced perfectly by the coffee, chocolate milk, vanilla, and woody flavours to the amazing smells right down to the feel of it on the palate. This is a world class beer for a reason, all other stouts take notes because this is what you should taste like, and hides the big ABV extremely well. Will always search this one out and drink it every day if I could, there’s nothing more to say, 5/5, A+ all day everyday."
"damn nice beer, wish it was more accessible on the left coast."
"Overall, I think this beer is one of the top of it's class. It exhibits the sweeter imperial stout qualities while including the coffee and chocolate 'breakfast' flavors."
"This is a good beer, but so overly burnt oaky, that it is tough to finish alone."
"Folks, the big trio that Founders makes, CBS, KBS, and FBS are all so good, each differing and excelling in their own ways, that to miss out on any would be doing oneself an injustice. Superior stout from the masters."
"O - Been waiting to try this beer for a long time. It definitely lived up to the hype. Another great stout from Fonders."
"WORLD CLASS, GET THIS BEER!"
"This beer absolutely blew my mind the first time I had it. When I had it again (the source of this review), I was less blown away but still impressed. This is such a solid beer. There are very few beers that do bourbon-barrel aging better."
"I'm not a big stout drinker, but I certainly enjoy this one. This kind of beer is something you would want to drink slowly either by itself or with a nice dinner."
"M - Heavy with perfect carbonation. Like drinking a liquid breakfast."
"on tap at Buster’s on 28th. They had two choice 5oz or 10oz. NO BRAINER, I got the bigger one. This beer was jet black with no head. Smell was sweet and coffee. Taste was bourbon and roasty with a lot of coffee. The beer is super smooth and very easy on the palate. This is a must have for everyone."
"O - I was first introduced to Founders via their Breakfast Stout at many a Michigan Beer Night in Mt. Pleasant during my more formative College drinking years. After being made aware of KBS I've spent a long time tracking this beer down and was ready to be disappointed simply because of the build-up. Fortunately the beer did not disappoint one bit and my patience was rewarded with a great tasting beer. Would love to find this beer in the wild (i.e. bottled) next year and see how some age treats it."
"I do admit that the sheer size of flavors in here will prove a hindrance to many, if not most beer drinkers. As for me, I've just found a new favorite stout."
"Future outlook: This brew did very well after 2.5 years of hibernation....would like to see how one would withstand even longer...but alas, this was my only sample, and the hassle to getting another one when they come out and stowing it for 3+ years...."
"Simply the best beer I have ever had."
"Amazing beer overall. The bourbon flavor is outstanding and the balance of all flavors is second to none. It is a big, bold beer that I could drink all night."
"KBS. The notes on BA say this is NOT a barrel-aged version of the breakfast stout. Too bad. I love their breakfast stout. This? Not so much. It pours oily black with minimal tan lacing. No head, really, but none is expected. The first pour stirs up fresh coffee beans and toasty-smoky malts. It is very inviting. Later on, aromas of chocolate and dark fruits emerge. Finally, I start to smell the vanilla. I am encouraged to dive into this beer. But...I am amazed at the disconnect to the taste. There is a bitter sourness that permeates each drink, like I am licking an oak cube. There is a mysterious bitterness that keeps butting in. I keep looking for flavors in the glass and end up furrowing my eyebrows in disappointment. A hot alcohol burn ends up carrying the day. It reminds me of 100 proof cherry brandy. Think of chocolate covered cherries with a grain alcohol center and you get what I'm tasting. Yeah, I like chocolate, and I like cherries, but c'mon, this is too much. Maybe some time in the cellar will do this some good."
"One of the top beers for a reason. This is how I like my stouts!"
"I'm very glad I bought this guy's three friends as well. In fact, I may go back tomorrow to buy a few more. One of the best beers I've ever had."
"O- I love this stout. It has all the classic stout flavors one could want, and handles them in a very smooth fashion. Slightly difficult to come across, but if I see this again I'll be buying lots of it."
"KBS pours pitch black with a finger of mocha colored head. No light penetrates it. The nose is a delightful melange of chocolate, oak, bourbon and vanilla. Taste starts out with sweet roasted malt accentuated by notes of chocolate, coffee and vanilla. A very nice bourbon presence asserts itself in the finish, warming things up a bit. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous with an excellently low level of carbonation which lends a smooth, creamy quality to the beer. This is one of my very favorite barrel aged stouts. The different aspects of the beer are melded together with such skill that the advertised 11.2% ABV is completely hidden. KBS is absolutely delicious and should be enjoyed at every possible opportunity. Highly recommended!"
"One of the world's finest beers."
"The smell is all over the place bourbon, coffee, chocolate basically smells like roasted goodness with bourbon. Pitch black with minimal head actually looks like dirty motor oil does. The taste is all over the place all the smells come through along with nice caramel and vanilla notes from the bourbon. There is also a bit of alcohol burn on this that can direct from the above but not enough to affect it."
"Deep, deep brown in color. Beautiful, brown head. The bourbon barrel aging gives this beer a nice smooth feel in the mouth. Even with the high alcohol content you hardly notice the taste. All around great beer. One of my favorites. I'm saving one for next year. Excited to see how it tastes after it's had some time to mellow."
"The mouthfell is everything I love out of a stout, its thick, silky smooth, and just all around delicious. The bourbon taste starts to come out even more as it heats up, amazing beer if you can get your hands on it it's a must have."
"Final score considers both offerings."
"12oz bottle (2009) into a snifter. Pours deep black with shimmering brown when held to the light. The small head is dark leather brown and dissipates quickly into a small ringlet. The aroma is honestly comprised of mostly a big dose of fresh roasted coffee. Underneath this is a small helping of nice bourbon and oak characteristics including a lot of vanilla and a touch of wood. The sweet aroma of whiskey touches through but not much. A drink taken in while inhaling starts quite sweet and flows into wood and vanilla mixed with a touch of citrus. The mid is all added coffee and this is definitely what lingers with undertones of very dark chocolate. As it warms the chocolate comes out more and more. There is a nice carbonation that mingles perfectly with the silky mouthfeel. This is honestly good but I was expecting more bourbon stout and less breakfast stout."
"Notes: Drank in sam adams pint glass on a hot an humid summer night. Cautious use of oak and serious grain bill most appreciated. 2011 release."
"Overall a great beer. it is clean and it has a great collective flavor. however it did not blow my mind. regardless I would love to have this beer again."
"Long over due review from notes during Philly Beer Week. I had this on draft at Capone's in Norristown, and lots of it. This poured a beautiful jet black with an espresso-like crema at the top that was a few millimeters thick. Heavy nose of coffee, bourbon, and chocolate. So smooth, you'd never have a clue it was over 11%, even with the noticeable bourbon-like burn that went along with each swallow. I bought 4 bottles from the bottle shop, and still have 3 left. Can't wait to get a case, regardless of expense."
"O- Very good beer. Had this in the spring and for some reason it didn't impress me, but glad I was proven wrong. The barrel aging gives it so much more complexity then the original breakfast stout."
"Narrative: Claire Murkmuggins didn’t mind the delta. Shoot, half her family couldn’t tell you the way rightside out of the delta. In fact, she kinda liked its murkiness, the way the cool silt ran through her toes when she was fishing for crawdads. The deep black nights where the bayou water looked like shimmering oil, ignited by the moonlight. I mean sure, she liked all that just fine, but what she really aspired to do, I mean, someday of course, Claire wanted to take over the family Chocolate Milk dairy. She grew tired of harvesting coffee beans all day with all the youngins, she had that dark capitalism spirit and she wanted in on that chocolate empire. Sometimes at night she’d sneak into the old cocoa refined and push her slender arm deep into the 70% dark chocolate and feel a secret power in its stickiness. She was refined but poised, in control, but sprightly. One day, she too would revolutionize the stodgy old chocolate milk world."
"O: A great beer that I have been happy to try on many occasions and one that I would never turn down"
"Has a sweet chocolate/vanilla aroma. This beer pours a deep black with a small amount of head. It has a nice amount of lacing around the glass. I can definitly taste the chocolate and vanilla in this beer with a slight amount of bourbon at the end. This beer has a nice amount of thickness to it, but not too thick. Overall this is a very enjoyable beer. It would even be better with a good cigar."
"O- Very good, glad the bourbon is an accent to the beer versus a completely dominating attribute. Also glad for just a hint of vanilla, I'm always scared when vanilla is used as a descriptive flavoring, as it is usually used in excess. Over all a solid A"
"#3 of 9."
"Full bodied which leaves a fairly strong coffee taste in the mouth. I have not been able to drink beer for a week due to a surgery and I’m glad I made this one my first."
"O - Time would do this brew *wonders*... I can't wait to try my other in a few years... The coffee flavor need to mellow significantly. Right now, I'm significantly underwhelmed by this brew. Thanks for sharing djeucalyptus!"
"O - Overall, this is one of my favorite beers to date. Lots of alcohol burn at the moment but it works well. One of the most complex beers I've had."
"Overall the beer is fantastic. By far the best bourbon stout I've tried and so happy I got my hands on a bottle. I'm going back on Friday to see if I can get another."
"Overall an absolutely incredible beer. So glad I got to try it!"
"O This is a great great beer. The more it warmed up, the more I enjoyed it. It's crazy good."
"O: KBS is worthy of its worship, I think that can't be denied. If you're talking about classic flavors of bourbon spiciness, chocolate, coffee, and a little roast, I don't think you can put those flavors together any better than it's done in KBS or deliver them in a better mouthfeel. I will say though that if you're looking for not just a perfectly executed version of a classic bourbon barrel aged stout and instead are looking to be surprised with new and bold flavors, that KBS might disappoint you. Besides the balance, blend, and excellent execution, I'd argue there's little here that's very original or new to an experienced stout drinker. Anyway, my hat goes off to founders for this one. Great beer."
"11.2% jesus christ, it's pretty restrained considering the ABV, but Walows thinks it needs some time (he says eight months) and I'm considering not even drinking my 2nd bottle, since someone else will love it much more than I do... I MUCH prefer FBS. It's just better! (to me)"
"O - Outstanding barrel aged stout, perhaps the best of its kind. It's certainly a sipper and one to enjoy over the course of an hour, perhaps more. However, with that said, the booze might be slightly too hot at times, especially as it warms. Luckily, I have the good fortune of possessing a four pack. I'm looking forward to testing this one in stages. See you again in a few months KBS..."
"O: A wonderful beer. I have to restrain myself from flying through a 4 pack. The only thing I could request more of from this stout is a little more bourbon."
"12oz bottle poured black as a steer’s tuchus on a moonless night. The smell of bourbon and coffee permeated the old nostrils. When first sipped the bourbon dominated the show, but as she warmed up a bit the coffee, roasted malt, and chocolate slowly oozed into the fracas. Personally I find KBS and Nemesis a little too heavy on the bourbon. Perhaps a coon skin cap and a musket would improve my demeanor..."
"M - Smooth as can be. The fact that this is 11 percent is shocking, and the carbonation helps to cleanse the palate for the bourbon aftertaste."
"KBS is not quite as thick on the feel as it appears, though it certainly still holds a bit of chewiness nonetheless. Overall KBS is KBS. It will always be amazing. However, I must say that be it the freshness over the 6-7 month old keg I reviewed from last year, or simply the 2011 batch, the bourbon is really hot here vs my last sampling. Also, this year I have been especially floored by the really rich chocolate and vanilla flavors."
"Everything about this beer is amazing. When its fresh it is delicious and has amazing coffee, chocolate, and bourbon all balanced against he oak. When its aged it gets even better and id say it peaks when its around two to three years old because the slight alcohol taste when its fresh completely goes away and the beer becomes even more balanced and delicious than it already is."
"O-Overall the 10 was awesome. It had a wonderful bourbon flavor that was strong but not over powering. The 11 had too much of a coffee taste. i think give it one year and the bourbon will come out just as it did in the 10. Overall this a brew i will buy a case of EVERY year."
"D: Absolutely outstanding! Definitely deserving of a world class title. Once again you didn't disappoint Founders!"
"Very balanced for what it is, but must be enjoyed slowly. I am not disappointed."
"Overall, what else can I say. This is phenomenal beer that deserves all of its accolades and deserves to be as sought after as it is. Find a way to get more than one so you can share this with another BA or just a great tasting partner. Thanks to aandresen for this trade."
"3/30/15-2014 bottle aged at least a year; smells of cocoa, peat moss, oak barrels, molasses, bourbon and coffee grinds. Tastes sweet, but with more complex woody and bourbon flavors that allows coffee, vanilla, cocoa, herbal and earthy notes, caramel and the booze to come through much nicer than the other 2014 bottle I had last year. Much better aged, this was smoother and not as abrasive as the fresh bottle a year prior, really nice with the age. There is no masking the bourbon, it is in your face, but it's tamed after the extra year mellowing and lets the chocolate and cocoa add better flavors."
"This is a 2011 KBS I am drinking from an eight ounce snifter. No light shows through this dark abyss of flavor. A thin line head holding a dark caramel color; the foam dissipates into slim ring around the glass.  The smell is boozy with strong characters of dark chocolates and coffee. A very strong bodied stout. The coffee dominates the front into the middle but is overtaken by chocolate through the finish. All the while a very subtle bourbon underlying backing up both predominate flavors, but every drink surprises me with flavors I can't describe. "
"   This is not something I would recommend to bourbon lovers, though it is still a very well rounded stout.   As always I am impressed with Founders' stouts and I can't wait to try this after it sits for a year. "
"Damn fine beer and lives up to the hype unlike others I've had."
"D: This is truly a world class beer. Breakfast Stout is good enough but this kicks it into another gear. The flavor is outstanding, well balanced and very smooth. This is not just your typical ""beer on steroids," it's perfectly done, what a beer! Great job once again Founders."
"O- One of the best for a reason"
"Velvet mouthfeel; tongue coating and heavy. A fine sipping dessert beer, that would be fantastic with some age (~2yrs)."
"Serving type: bottle"
"O-Great, great beer. Definitely lived up to the hype for me."
"Overall: Smell could be more intense but this is merely my opinion and should not come at a cost to other attributes. Taste is superior to Bourbon County and Dark Lord imho. I find it hard to give any beer a 5.0. This beer could only get better if it were allowed to age for a while. That's why I got a case when it came out :)"
"Allowed to warm for a few minutes now in the glass, it's clear that this is a very special beer. I don't want it to end but I can't stop sipping. Well done, Founders."
"Thanks to a77cj7 for a generous BIF box that included this KBS!"
"KBS is a benchmark in the world of bourbon aged stouts. There is justification to how sought-after this beer is. Do yourself a favor and seek a bottle out. Even better, spring for the entire 4 pack. Drink one fresh and age the remaining three. It will be worth it."
"i've had KBS '10 and '11 on tap, and '11 in bottles. overall, they're similar - a perfect breakfast stout with delicious bourbon. '11 is much hotter than '10, but not in a bad way. it's hot in the same way Rare BCBS is - in a delicious enjoyable way that lends the beer to sipping. this remains one of my stalwart favorite beers, and something i will look forward to yearly. the oatmeal/coffee/chocolate work so perfectly with the bourbon."
"O - In my super humble opinion, 2011 is a weak year for KBS. That said, this stuff is still fantastic and I will still continue to only open these up on special occasions. Tonight's occasion: oreo and his girlfriend decided to split up. LOL!~~~~"
"Notes - This is my first time having this, and I am absolutely blown away. The flavors that are present are HUGE, but rather than compete they just completely meld together. Really incredible experience."
"D - maybe not a session beer but certainly enjoyable."
"O: It took me a while to drink a 12 ounce bottle, and one was enough. This is a well designed beer, and the flavors are well integrated."
"Overall: Surprisingly smooth beer with a clean taste although heavy on the chocolate, but not overly sweet. Honestly though, I was a little disappointed. This is one of the highest rated beers, and this one was cellared for 2 years, and although not my favorite style, I was expecting more from this beer. When comparing it to other beers in the style, I find others like Southern Tier richer. I find this beer does not deliver the goods like “lesser” brews. The alcohol taste is very strong and not balanced well against the chocolate (These are personal preferences though)."
"D - Interesting to sample on tap after enjoying in bottle form on many occasion... Still an elite and must try for all BAs, but it barrel aged competition seems to be gaining a bit..."
"Overall: Man, if this had had a decent head, we would have found ourselves a 100%-er."
"Better than CBS. Easily."
"A beer that has tastes of black coffee, M'n'Ms, smoke, oak, bourbon, booze, raw meat, chocolate, grass, tobacco, fabric, dark fruits, cacti, hops and blood. Interesting beer. Smooth but whatever. Had this beer four years ago. Still like it. Still want more."
"This is my second perfect score. Not sure if that's over-use or not but I just can't imagine this beer being any better. Like a great work of art, nothing should be added or taken away."
"Pours pitch black in body with a light coffee head, an intimidating potion. Smells of bourbon, subtle coffee, chocolate, wood. Beautifully smooth: flavors of chocolate syrup, cocoa nibs, bourbon, booze, some cigar, hop dryness towards the finish. Amazingly refreshing with light carbonation and a heavy body that leaves cocoa cloying on the palate. Elegant, powerful. Top 10 best beers I've had."
"I have to review taste and mouthfeel together because, in my opinion, this beer overwhelms both at the same time. This stout had an unbelievable silky texture that coated my whole palate with a chocolate/bourbon fusion of stout! One of my most enjoyable, relaxing, and thorough beer experiences."
"Fantastic, i feel like the bourbon was stronger than i remembered when i tried last years. But i'm not complaining, a very good beer."
"Overall I think KBS is an excellent Stout and one of the best ones I have ever had. I have always been a big fan of barrel aged beer, but this one takes barrel aging to a new level, I really love how all the subtle flavors of the bourbon came through and they blended with the base breakfast stout nicely. This beer isn't that drinkable, it makes for a nice smooth sipper, but if I had another one it would be hard for me not to drink it. I liked everything about this beer, everything seemed spot on and balanced very well. There is tons of hype surrounding this beer and it lives up to it gracefully, I see why so many people drop what they are doing and rush to the stores to get some before it is all sold out, it's just that damn good. A little part of me was hoping I wouldn't like this beer that much so I wouldn't have to go through the madness each year to get it, but since I like it so damn much, I guess I am just going to have tough it out and scour my city for any available bottle I can find next year, damn you Founders, this must be all part of your master plan. This is a must have for any true beer lover, it's not just a beer it's an experience. This has to be the best beer I have had from Founders and now it has a place as my favorite barrel aged stout to date. I can't say enough good things about Founders, and with beers like this, you don't have to, you just let someone take a sip and watch the smile form on their face. I couldn't think of a better beer to celebrate 200 reviews with, heres to 200 more. 2014 Edit i aged one for a year and I found out what I already knew this beer is best fresh, but still good when aged."
"This is one amazing beer, word class."
"D: very enjoyable, the high alcohol content is well hidden, great sipping beer"
"D: Tasty but strong! A sipper for sure, but I'll definitely order again and actively seek it out. I'll save the second bottle for sharing when the family visits from out west."
"I was saving something special for my 200th beer review, what a treat this was."
"thanks buffs9"
"Since I have never had this beer and heard many great things, I was hoping it would meet expectations--and it did. This is a quality beer and would like to give it a taste after some maturity."
"O- A top notch stout. If I had not tried an 09 BCBS, the batch 1 of the boulevard RIS, and GI Big John from this year, I probably would have rated this A+, but those stouts impressed me in overall quality and flavor, thereby raising the stout bar. From what I remember from last years KBS, it would have held it's own much better. I just feel that the 2011 batch is a little bit thinner."
"Overall this is a great beer...as enjoyable as The Abyss and probably better. I would drink this one again...any time any place. Outstanding"
"Amazing beer."
"O – Hard to not love this. It’s really a wonderful stout, well balanced and not overpowering. Great mix of flavors. If you are a bourbon fan this will be an epic tasting and even if you are not its just subtle enough to make you a fan."
"Overall- Wow so far my favorite stout. KBS was nothing short of amazing for me. After having a not so great time with Abyss (I'm not a licorice fan) I was hesitant towards big bal-aged stouts, but not anymore. I wish I was closer to Michigan so I could get this goodness every year. What a beer."
"From a bottle. Pours a velvety black with a brown head that didn't leave anything on the sides. It smells of coffee with some barrel, oak, and bourbon. Has a nice roasted character with wood and huge coffee and chocolate. This beer feels and tastes great, can't think of much that could make it better. Glad I was able to get some bottles this year."
"Overall:"
"Here’s to fifty more like KBS!"
"O – I poured myself appx 4oz to do this review and had to go back for seconds before I was finished. So much going on with this one. Not sure if I will end up preferring this one fresh or with some age on it, but I’ve got a second bottle so I’ll find out eventually. Really loved it!"
"It pours beautifully with a short dense light brown head. It holds onto a nice little film of foam which leaves lacing down the side of the glass. Really exceptional aroma. Huge coffee notes, with mild mocha chocolate and light bourbon in the background. The taste is the same, with a mild pleasant alcohol burn. It is chocolate, coffee, creamy, and a very small dash of bourbon to add character. As a matter of fact, I was expecting a bit more of the bourbon -bal or oak in here, as i thought a touch more vanilla would be really nice with the other flavors. As such, it is extraordinarily balanced. The mouthfeel is creamy and full bodied. Really happy with founders on this beer. Delicious beer."
"Bottle poured into a snifter. Very strong nose of oak. Taste is a good balance between coffee chocolate and bourbon. Bourbon is on the lighter side compared to say a Goose Island or Angels Share Bourbon Barrel. Has a really sweet aftertaste of molasses. Very Good!"
"The most impressive thing about this beer was how the complex flavors blended and complimented each other. The deep robust coffee lended a bitterness against a sweet caramel and bourbon smoothness. Nothing overpowered or dominated. Great chocolate undertones and smokey, woody notes finished it into a superb and mellow drink. It was creamy and full bodied. This is a beer to be sipped and savored. The bourbon flavor lends a sweetness and the booze burn was subtle and blended. Awesome beer!"
"O- Great slow slipper for a cold winter night. A classic that lives up to the hype."
"O- My only complaint on this beer is that I wish I had more of it. It was great and worht all the praise it gets. I highly recommend trying this one if you can get your hands on it. If you cannot get it in your area, trade for it. I think you will be satisfied."
"O--This lives up to the hype. One of the best imperial stouts on the market. If you can get it, try it!"
"The first time I had this beer, I got only the strong strong coffee taste out of it. However, as I grew in my tastes, I got a much more blended taste of coffee, a little sweet, some good alcohol burn, and a great beer. I really could see myself drinking this at any time of day, an extremely drinkable beer that lives up to its trading value."
"Overall: Superb barrel-aged imperial stout! I had two from the 2011 bottling and will eagerly look for this again. Thanks to StLThrash for one in a trade and Steamhead for saving me another."
"O: The more I have this beer, the more I love it; I can sincerely say that this is one of the best beers in the world! I advocate hitting the Founders brewpub to see if you can get fortunate enough to get this on nitro, or other remarkable beer."
"O: WOW! This was my first KBS and it didn't last long. This is by far the best beer I've ever had. The complexities of this beer are outstanding: the roasted malts, bitter coffee, sweet chocolates and vanilla, finished out with the wonderful hints of bourbon and the oak make this an incredible beer. I hope every BA gets a chance to try this beauty at least once."
"This is a great beer with a very dark color that allows very little light to pass through it. A very chocolate colored head greets the drinker along with aromas of Hershey's chocolate and hints of bittersweet chocolate. The mouthfeel is very thick but creamy. The taste is very chocolatey with a slight hint of vanilla and bourbon giving this beer a strong flavor that is enjoyable by itself or with BBQ. Had it at The Lark in East Northport, NY."
"Pour looks like used motor oil with some head. About a one finger head of light brown foam. Rings of lace down the glass, not a lot of pattern, but good cling where it settles. Color is a 40 on the SRM beer color chart. Black as coal, even in a shot glass it is black. Smell is very intense, aromas of coffee, raisins, caramel, semi sweet chocolate, and plums. Taste is rich and complex, with flavors of roasted coffee, dark chocolate, dates, raisins, plums, caramel, oak aging, and lemon zest. Warning, the demon alcohol, which is masked by the wonder flavors, comes like a thief in the night and hits you the side of the head...wow. Mouthfeel is velvet cream, moderate zing, and a slight dry feeling in my soft palate. A touch of maple syrup aftertaste lingers in the back of my hard palate. Not for chain drinking, although I would like the flavor to go on for a month. Breakfast, well maybe with waffles covered with chocolate syrup. A wonderful treat anyway you look at it."
"Overall - I feel these big beers win ratings for alcohol content. The alcohol is a bit too much. Though it may mellow out with aging. I've been getting into single malts and small batch bourbons/whiskeys. Barrel aged beers tend to be too reminiscent of sweeter low quality whiskeys. I was attracted to this beer for the time and care listed in it's preparation. I would try it again, but am glad I only got a bottle for now at $6/bottle in NYC. Would like to age one and see how it matures."
"Had on draft at Twains. Oh my God. Go for it. Seriously you are losing out. Bourbon and chocolate. They go to the courthouse and get hitched. Have a baby named Yummy and live happy ever after. Ok, they have a couple of babies, but they are all pretty."
"Overall - Overrated! Very disappointed."
"D: great sipper. glad i got my hands on one of these. looking forward to trying it with some years on it."
"O. This is a beer to savor and remember, I wouldn't have more than one of these in a sitting as the supply isn't abundant enough for me to want to just drink them away. The high ABV is also a deterrent in this. Definitely a sipper, but it still has a lot of drinkability."
"O: This is really good but I was expecting a bit more, especially on the bourbon side. I had no clue it was more coffee heavy. Seek this out if you love coffee stouts because you won't be disappointed but if you are a Bourbon Barrel fan, this is not a must."
"Overall, wow."
"The smell is powerful, a mix of bourbon, rich coffee, dark chocolate. Taking a small sip and I taste charred bread, dark chocolate, bourbon, raisins and roasted malt. The body of it is full and has a certain syrup quality to it. KBS is a big beer, that has a good complexity and quality to go with it. It would be perfect for putting alongside some vanilla ice cream after a hearty meal."
"This beer lives up to the hype! Smells of bourbon, chocolate and molases. Taste like a bourbon chocolate bomb eploded in your mouth! Crazy good! I would drink this beer everyday and twice on Sunday if I had that many KBS in the cellar! It is a pain to get but well worth the effort."
"This tastes like the people who make Baileys Irish Cream made this. You have to like bourbon to like this, though the bourbon isn’t overpowering…it just takes this “beer” into almost non-beer territory…with flying colors. A great sipper, highly enjoyable, and it went very well with high-grade, bittersweet chocolate. Every beer geek should get their hands on one of these at some point in their life."
"O/D - This is a bourbon bomb. The bourbon is the dominant characteristic in the flavor profile. I would have liked a bit more depth of flavor in the beginning taste notes to balance out the strong bourbon character that comes after. But that's being picky. This is a great brew overall and I can't wait until I can enjoy it again."
"Getting a lot more coffee in the aroma than before. Lots of chocolate and bourbon too. Super-smooth and velvety, like their porter and Imperial Stout. So much chocolate and bourbon come through in the flavor, I am surprised that the coffee isn't as pronounced as the aroma. This beer is so nice I wish I could get a four-pack like I did in 2011..."
"O- Overall, this was the biggest disappointment of the day. I had a hard time finishing this brew. A bad batch perhaps? Trying this brew again is a MUST. With all the hype surrounding this beer, it has to be better. This was the hardest beer to obtain and was the biggest letdown. As of this review, I have two 4-pack for trade."
"Got this 2011 in a recent trade with Jedwards, thanks man! Dark black color with a bit of a brown head. Smells like really good coffee to me, nice. The flavor was also really good coffee, not overwhelming, a hint of booze but the alcohol was well hidden. Overall I can see why people like this beer so much but given the price and availability I don;t really have any incentive to get this again."
"O- Considering the abv this is very drinkable and very smooth. I can't say I'm a huge fan of the bourbon flavor but if I was this would be the perfect brew! I'm very glad I came across this one; just not too happy about the price I paid for it ( $40 a 4 pack!?) I highly recommend this to any bourbon barrel-aged stout lovers, still a must try even if not. Can't wait to age and compare this one!"
"Overall: Good? Yes. Amazing? I am not sure I would go that far. Given the hype, the insane ratings, the high price, and the insane measures gone through to get it, I was hoping for one of the best beers ever. Instead I was met with a very strong flavored and bold beer that did not quite pull it all together as I hoped it would. I feel like it will do great with some age. Dont get me wrong, I enjoyed the beer, but given all the other factors it did not leave me one hundred percent satisfied. Not worth the insane hype around it. I will certainly drink it again and wouldnt mind trading for it in the future but I will not go through extensive measures to acquire it again."
"Medium body with some good small bubble carbonation to move the flavors along. Definitely a slow sipper with the alcohol making this burn a bit. At this point, this really is a bourbon lover's type of beer, but I would like more of the beer to come through. Curious if I should open the '10 bottle soon and see how it compares."
"Poured a 2010 bottle into my bruery tulip. Dark black with a 1finger mocha head that dissipates quickly. Nice lacing that clings to the glass like its glue. Aroma is coffee malt and light bourbon. I thought coffee fades out of beers quickly, I guess the coffee in KBS doesn't follow the rules. Man this beer tastes smooth, it follows the nose but is more balanced with a year on it, less hot and booze. I like it fresh but I love it with a year on it. Fantastic brew!"
"Overall - This beer is amazing. Easily the best beer I've drank, though I have other favorite types. If you like these flavors, you have to try this. It's never appropriate to pay some of the prices I've seen for it or any beer, ($60 a 4 pack? Please.) but this stuff is great."
"O- Good, but not my favorite Stout."
"Finish: Long and thick... quite complex and beautifully layered with flavor. The bourbon influence is really present here."
"O-Fantastic beer. well worth the ratings it has! Lives up to the hype!"
"Overall- Impressive! Can't believe this is my first time having this one! It seems like there is a bourbon additional flavor here like the Dragon's Milk by New Holland OR it was aged in bourbon barrels. The drinkability is low (which is why I gave it a low score towards the Overall category), but still is enjoyable! Will be wanting a bottle or two to age in the future!"
"O: This beer blew me away. I had it and a westy 12 at the same time and I felt like I was in heaven. Too much to drink on a nighly basis but a great beer when in the mood."
"Overall: This is an incredible beer! There is no doubt that next year I will attempt to trade for at least a 4 pack. Truly world class, one of the best beers I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. It easily lived up to the hype and surpassed it."
"Notes: No true beer geek can really pick a favorite beer, but if you put a gun to my head, I might have to pick this one. I'm a sucker for a great bourbon barrel aged stout, and this one is king. Mouth watering in taste and smell, and very complex. Now, having said all of that, this year's release seemed a little different than past iterations. The mouthfeel seems a bit thinner than I remember, and the bourbon flavors were a bit more dominant, though I didn't feel that they ever became too hot. Could just be my palate changing, but I would have had trouble giving past releases less that straight 5's."
"O- Very nice drink here! Could sip on this anytime, anywhere. Can't wait to let a couple bottles age over the years and see what happens. Very enjoyable!"
"O - A great bourbon stout saving another one to age to see if it mellows the alcohol."
"It was great having both Breakfast and KBS back to back. This beer has everything Breakfast is missing to make it amazing. Smoother, richer chocolate, oats, and even some quality bourbon now b/c of the aging process. I wish we could freeze it into ice blocks and skate on it and melt it in the spring time and drink it!"
"I just tried this 2 days ago for the first time. I was amazed with the complexity of it. First drink was full of coffee with subtle chocolate notes and a flavor of bourbon. As i made my way through the glass the chocolate notes jumped out more and by the time i was at the end of the glass the bourbon flavor was stronger on my pallet than at the beginning. The aftertaste lingers quite awhile and keeps you wanting more and more. Today via trade i acquired 2 more bottles of KBS, one to enjoy now, and one to sit on to enjoy later. I can't wait to see what it tastes like in a year!"
" i hope there is no mad rush for these bottles scattered about, so please make them limitless. i hope i see a cartoon smell in the air of the nose of each beer lifting me up and carrying me to each 5.5.5.5.5. bottle."
"Overall a very complex, rich stout. Surprisingly drinkable at 11.2% ABV, but one is enough in a session."
"Overall, one of the best beers in the style."
"Pours black with a mocha head that disappears pretty quickly leaving spots of foam on top. The nose is pretty serious. Bourbon, coffee, chocolate maybe some caramel or vanilla. The taste is just as complex, all of these flavors working on different levels. If I could pick one out that overpowers the others it would be the coffee, a bit sharp but still delicious. You get the booze but it's not super in your face. Great beer, glad I got to try it."
"very complex, and very special. it definitely lived up to the hype for me."
"O- All of the problems really bring it down overall. Individually it shines in areas, but it never works as a team player. What happened? It definitely is better than I remembered, but surely I would never buy it again. As long as this review sticks around..."
"M - Thick, dense, and filling like a dark fudge brownie with a hint of cream. This one has the perfect amount of burn going down that you can respect the bourbon and the neutralizing chocolate/coffee notes that pull the entire beer into nirvana. Lives up to hype x10"
"O- what a winner, I don't taste any of the alcohol but you can feel the strength a quarter of the way into the glass...believe the hype it's awesome "
"Overall - Exceptional - easily one of my favorite beers. I wish I could drink this everyday."
"I'm looking for some level of balance in a beer, and then there is a beer like KBS that achieves this in showboat-like fashion. You don't typically get contrast/balance like this in imperial stouts and this makes it remarkably drinkable relative to the style. With that in mind, it has the complexity that makes you want to drink it slow."
"Really hard to beat at this price point."
"Great beer."
"This beer is fantastic either fresh, or aged for a year or two. It is always hard to keep my hands off them."
"Overall this is one fine example of a breakfast stout and I look forward to seeing how this fine stout ages in the upcoming year or two. Enjoy!!!"
"Overall, an exceptional beer. Sophisticated, complex and delicious. Glad I got a chance to enjoy one of these."
"O - if i were to ever move to Michigan all would be ok because of this beer, bottom line. all the hype is always annoying to me for any brew and it causes me to become extremely critical daring it to stand its ground. KBS lives up to everything, i would love to get a case of this one day. I can't wait to find something i think is better, could be a long time. i cant thank D enough for sharing this one. absolute appreciation"
"Taste is smooth and oaky with a fair amount of bourbon. Mildly sweet, just about right for me. Light raisiny fruitiness adds some complexity. Coffee has died down quite a bit, as has the heat - bit of a tradeoff I suppose. I like this better at one year old than fresh. Much smoother and well integrated...a delicious beverage to be sure. I would seek this out again, no doubt. Although I must say (probably in the minority) that I enjoy the standard Breakfast Stout more than this."
"O - A monster of a stout and the best that I have tried to date."
"Pours oily black, no head but a dark tan lacing exists from which I can infer what a head would look like on this. Smell is complex; tootsie roll chocolate, coffee, green pepper like vegitation, vanilla. Taste is complex as well; chocolate, slight coffee, greenbeans, just the right amount of a hint of bourbon (not overwhelming like Backwoods Bastard), vanilla, roasted malt. Mouthfeel is a tad thin, just chewy enough without going overboard, not so thin as to allow the bourbon and alcohol flavors to be too brash; drinkability is good, I can already feel the latent alcohol burn and I'm a quarter way through the glass. Definitely a decent stout but not really worth the hype."
"alcohol is hidden most of the time, but becomes very prevalent at the bottom of the beer. Always a great feel going down though."
"O- Easily one of the best barrel-aged beers I've had, and does not disappoint in its complexity and well-integrated flavors. A very hyped up yearly release that delivers in every way."
" Grade A+ Purchased at Stoney's -- $5.99 each"
"Definitely inferior to the '08 batch."
"D/O- Consider me impressed. For all the ""hype"" surrounding this beer I feel like it does a good job delivering the goods. The best I have had of the style, Imperial Stout aged in bourbon barrels, including GI BCS...less boozy, goes down smoother. FOUNDERS."
"difficult to find each year, oh well I've got a 4 pack to age."
"T: Bourbon and roasted malt on the front end. Middle shows some dark roasted coffee, toffee and caramel. Finish brings some charred wood and a nice hint of heat. Such a great beer and one I'm really glad to have found again."
"Overall: This beer has so much complexity, one can't help but slip into a relaxed, contemplative mood. Lots of great things going on here. The noticeable booziness is not overwhelming, and will probably soften over time. Next time I'm lucky to get a hold of one of these, I think I'm going to cellar it for a few years."
"The more Founders beers I have, the more I'm convinced that they're probably the most talented brewers in America today. KBS is a triumphant bourbon barrel aged imperial stout, and a further testament to the brewery's greatness... and I'm trying hard here to temper my gushing about how amazing this beer is."
"O-One of, if not the, best stouts I've ever had. Just a great blend of flavors on the nose as well as in the mouth. I'll have to keep one of these 2011s around for a while to let it age."
"O: This is a fucking amazing stout. I was afraid this would be too hyped up, but this is one of the best stouts I've ever had. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great stout, and if you have to go out of your way to get it, it's well worth it."
"Slick consistency, low on carbonation, but exactly how I want the beer to feel in my mouth. Ya, perfect mouthfeel. So the beer doesn't look too great. Like a glass of used motor oil, but who cares? Smell it, taste it, feel it tickle your beer geek G-spot like no other, and sit back an enjoy."
"O-A very good dessert drink."
"O: Top-tier beer. Worth seeking out, even at 7-9 bucks a bottle."
"Overall: This was a very delicious and great tasting beer. I would recommend this beer to anyone and happy I got the scoop about this special log of beer at the Union Brewhouse in Weymouth."
"Ending notes: This beer is definitely not for the feint-hearted. it packs a punch at 11.2% ABV. It is a good sipping beer. Definitely not sessionable. I had to take my time with this one. Personally, I prefer the regular Breakfast Stout by Founders. I find that the bourbon was a little too much for me."
"Pours a super thick pitch black color with a tiny 1/2 inch dark chocolate colored head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Wow, this beer smells absolutely fantastic. Chocolate chip cookie dough, sweetened coffee, cinnamon, with a whiff of the oak bourbon barrels. Taste is extremely rich and decadent. Cocoa powder, cookie dough, sweetened coffee with creamer, cinnamon, vanilla, coconut, with the woody bourbon taste coming through on the finish. Mouthfeel is very thick and creamy on this one. Mild alcohol burn in the throat after each sip. I have been wanting to try this one for a long, long time and the hype and all the good things I have heard and read about this beer are all warranted. This is an exceptional beer and it's no wonder this one is super hard to find."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how creamy, frothy, and oily the mouthfeel was. The brew pours as I would imagine a glassful of the chocolate waterfall from “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” would pour. While the bourbon wasn’t starkly present throughout, as the beer warms it becomes very boozy, and by the end, was a bit much. All in all, the feel alone was enough to bring this into the “great” category."
"Pours into a Founder's Snifter black with a thin dark tan head. Spotty lacing is left on the glass. Nose is bourbon, dark roasted malt, notes of dark coffee, vanilla. Taste is robust and complex; not an overwhelming amount of bourbon taste thankfully, but still enough presence to dominate. Bitter and dark coffee flavours are heavy and delicious. Mouthfeel is heavy, leaves a dry sensation. Overall, unsurprisingly, Founder's really hits it out of the ballpark with the KBS. It's what a bourbon-barrel aged stout ought to be. A wonderful world-class beer from a favourite brewery. Must-try."
"O: This is absolutely a delicious beer. That being said, I was honestly hoping for the bourbon to dominate a little bit more, and I feel that this could have been a better beer had it taken on different characteristics from the barrels."
"O- A great beer, an excellent stout. Lives up to the hype."
"Fresh (which I have had on tap and not reviewed) would score high, but not quite as high. This is tremendous with a couple years age on it, really brings out some complexities and tones back the booziness a bit to bring more flavor to the forefront. Beautiful."
"O - still a really good beer. The bourbon overwhelms the other flavors and a aromas a bit but this year the bourbon has got that great caramel note to it so it makes up for masking other ingredients."
"Chocolate, vanilla, coffee..everything is there. A beauty that needs no further description."
"For me that was the highlight of this beer, the taste is big coffee, oak, maybe a bit of dark chocolate. The flavor reminds me of cold burnt coffee (i personally did not get any bourbon barrel). It seemed a little simple for a world class stout, and with all the hype i must say i was disappointed."
"O - Worth the hype. Taste pokes its head above the rest of a very strong pack of Imperial Stouts. Smell is divine. Dark as night. Rolls across the tongue and down the throat without a fight. As Founders advertises, ""Good for everything a stout out to be good for."""
"O: Really a great beer. Its not overly sweet or burned or boozey. A great balance of everything. More bitter this time than I remembered but didnt hurt it."
"O: Please sir, may I have another? Was fortunate enough to have this both in bottle and on tap, no drastic difference. Only thing that would keep me from having more is price and availability!"
"Notes: I was lucky enough to pick up some bottles at Citywide (South Bend), and then a few weeks later at Belmont on S.B. Ave. This is a very rare and sought after beer every year, running around $7-8 per 12oz bottle. Fiddler's Hearth on Main St. in South Bend also has a keg of this every year shortly after its official release. This is a really great beer, aged in bourbon barrels for an entire year before it is released. If you missed it this year, mark your calendars for the beginning of March next year and pickup a bottle or two... just make sure to leave me some."
"Overall: This is a great offering to be enjoyed on a very limited basis. I enjoyed it, but wouldn't have more than one glass at a sitting (took me about 40 minutes to get through it). Prefer it to the local offering, Goose Island's Bourbon County Stout, and have high hopes for the Breakfast Stout when I try it."
"O/D: It's a beer I wish I could have more of, but at the same time...it did not live up to the hype. It's delicious, but where's the bourbon?"
"O: After drinking this beer I finally understand all of the hype that goes along with it. Its a complex, bold, rich, fantastic, wonderful, delicious, viscous mocha bourbon latte and I cant thank my trading partner enough to have sent more than one. Its one of the best beers I've had to date with out a doubt. Cheers bitches"
"Overall: Thank you Tribepride. I owe you one; I think this is one of the best beers I have had all year. I am going to nurse this experience."
"M/O: thick motor oil texture with just enough carbonation to cut the sweetness. I would drink the whole 4 pack if my liver could take it. Loved this brew, have yet to be disappointed by any Founders product."
"Overall - A Dantastic beer, but I can't help but think it will be much better with some age behind it. Nevertheless, it's still a great beer that will impress your friends or reveal that they have no idea what a great beer is when they gag after tasting it. That can be the sign of a great beer."
"After have drunk two previous bottles before reviewing, I changed my mind about the stout and would say that it ranks well with the Old Rasputin."
"Man, this is freaking delicious. The bourbon swirls in with the chocolate and vanilla along a coffee spine. A few quick sips and I realize the trouble this one can cause. It's a damn dessert and an incredible beer."
"This is really pretty spectacular, but it's not something that I'd seek out. I randomly got a bottle of this from an extremely generous BA and am glad that I got a chance to try it, but there are plenty barrel-aged stouts that I'd prefer and will go out of my way to get in the future. Either way, it was mostly enjoyable."
"o - i mean damn, thats good. no wonder everyone raves about this one. just like the description says, this is NOT the standard breakfast stout. this is a whole nother' ball game. a much more serious, not fucking around, kind of a stout."
"Overall, I had this beer last year and went through the effort to track it down again. I feel like I can say this with most Founders beers but this is one of my favorite beers."
"Pitch black with a two finger espresso crema colored cap. Nice. Nose is of toffee popcorn, smoky bitter chocolate, wet burnt oak, spiced coffee and a wisp of hops. Taste is breakfast stout kicked up a notch with a strong hit of bourbon laced oak and caramel, sweet corn, oak vanillin, chocolate espresso bean, finishes with a drying bourbon finish. Very drinkable but you can tell the abv is up there but remains balanced with a nice carbonation level insuring thats its not cloying. Very enjoyable and truly world class, though i drank this at about 60 degrees and fill it would have shown better a touch cooler."
"O=DEFINITELY did not dissapoint one of the best stouts I have ever had and a great birthday present to me"
"Overall: Very complex and smooth beer, the abv is pretty high but its surprisingly easy to drink. Great to sip on for a while after a meal."
"Simply put, this is one of the best beers I have ever tasted. I was able to snag a bottle, and I'm very glad that I did. It doesn't pour like your average stout, perhaps a little thinner. Aroma is big on vanilla and bourbon, and the taste is balanced by the dark malts and hops. Mouthfeel is super-silky and stays with you for a while. KBS is definitely a beer to cherish and savor. I only wish it was more available, as it took an act of god to secure one bottle."
"I walked into a store that i go in from time to time and found a whole case of this beer for 19.99 a 4 pack."
"The initial smell and taste of this beer reminded me that this beer is not for the faint of heart. Right from the get go you can taste the fact that this beer was aged in bourbon barrels for a year. However, after the initial feeling of sipping a bourbon subsides, you get the real treat. This beer finishes sweet, creamy, and with just the right amount of chocolate notes. This beer was a real find and well worth the hunt and the $6.25 draft price."
"Beer and Whiskey have had a beautiful marriage in the aging process and now I get to drink it's golden baby."
"OVERALL GRADE: A/A+"
"this is a very smooth and drinkable beer. It pured out great, with about an inch and a half of head. I would reccomend to anyone."
" This is my favorite beer hands down.It is very well balenced and complex.At 11.2 it is very drinkable.Founders did an amazing job here. They always continue to impress.A absolute must try."
"A BIG MAHALO goes out to finewinemike for the opportunity to try this!!!"
"Much like how humans dream of flying like birds, if it were possible for your average stout to have dreams, this is what it would dream it was. Take a bow, Founders, you done good..."
"O: quite excellent. A very tasty and drinkable imperial stout."
"D - Drinkability is high. I don't get any sense of 11.20% ABV in this beer and the flavors keep coming with more twists and turns as it warms. Very good beer, but unfortunately the hype-train behind this beer left me with only 2 bottles at a price of $8 each..."
"O: World class. Quite possibly my favorite beer ever, we definitely have a winner here. I'm not a big fan of drinking straight bourbon, but I really, really love this. Wow, enough said, I'm going to finish savoring this masterpiece of a brew. Once again, I tip my hat to you Founders."
"OVERALL: Technically, this is one of the best beers I have ever had. Near perfect balance and flavors that make it one of the best representatives of the style out there make this beer delicious, but I have tasted one better Imperial Stout and it's name started with Bourbon, ended with Stout and had County in the middle."
"Wow, so lucky to have found this one available at The Lower Depths in Kenmore Square after the Sox game yesterday. Pours a dark dark dark chocolate brown. Nice mocha colored head. Aroma is boozy warm and inviting. Smells of vanilla, coffee, and bourbon goodness. This is the best balanced boubon aged beer I have tried. The booze is nice an mellow and sweet, and compliments the malty coffee flavors very well! Its like the best alchoholic coffee drink you have ever had. Even as it warms the flavors still remain solid and the booze does not take over. This beer is everything you have heard about it and more!"
"O- This beer is really quite amazing, noticeably better on tap than I remember it being the half a dozen or so times I've had it out of the bottle- which I also thought fantastic. An epic concoction with copious amounts of malt. A no holds barred concoction that I would liken to a bag of dark chocolate, thrown into a bag of coffee, thrown into a bourbon barrel- but that would be only the beginning. The resultant mixture must be tasted- heaven in a glass."
"O - Distinctly better on tap than in bottle."
"Overall an excellent beer. Great balance and easy to taste the individual flavors. Can't wait to drink this again."
"2010- Much more rounded than the 2011. Less bourbon heat and more chocolate and vanilla. Still sticky sweet mouthfeel. Maybe even more so. This was wichsbrew's favorite of the two. I prefered the 2011."
"This is one of the most well balanced brews I have ever had. The barrel aging didn't come on too strong like some,probobly because of the strong coffee notes.Would have liked to notice the ABV a bit more though.I will definitely get another from next years batch.I think this tasty treat should be enjoyed fresh because no carecteristics need to mellowed."
"O - One of the best. That said I think FBS is a better balanced beer. KBS is almost too much bourbon. I think BCBS does a better job of accentuating the bourbon flavor without losing the best parts of the underlying stout. KBS is a bit too much bourbon for my taste. Even still, it is beyond delicious, especially with some age on it."
"This was a 2 year aged bottle."
"I personally love bourbon, so this is about the best stout I could ever hope to have. It definitely has more of the ""bourbon' to it than any other bourbon stout I've had."
"D - I may actually have another, this is so good. Remarkably masked alcohol, and it is just plain delicious. Plus, I have a DD!"
"O: This is absolutely the best beer I've tasted to date. For being over 11% ABV, there's absolutely none of it in the taste. It's not too bourbon-y for somebody like me who had a bad experience with Jack Daniels in college, but not so light that it doesn't make a difference. And what a difference this makes. I will absolutely buy every bottle I can get my hands on in the future, and probably trade none of it away regardless of the asking price - it's too good to not drink myself."
"O: Best beer that I've ever had. The complexity and overall quality of this beer are unmatched."
"Cheers..."
"O - I tried to be so objective on this beer given the scarcity in New York and the praises KBS gets. It really is a top tier stout and about the best one could hope for. Have it with food, by itself, but share with others. I will cellar a couple to see what age does to the profile."
"Great job Founders, excellent beer."
"O: a great treat, would love to have this around more often, I can only hope production increases as the demand for this beer is well deserved, and it is the perfect serving size for this beer."
"2010 vintage poured into the trusy ol' shaker (again). Poured a very dark black with no head whatsoever (NOT flat, however). Aroma of coffee and booze. Taste was wonderful: a smooth bourbon (MUCHO better than the '09 vintage), chocolate, a hint of vanilla, and coffee. After being quite disapointed in the '09 vintage I got at DLD '09, this vintage is QUITE tasty."
"Overall: An amazing barrel aged brew. Great balance and very smooth. Lives up to the hype."
"Though some would say the drinkability on this brew be hard because of such a high ABV at 11.2%. But once you get a few sips in you hardly want to put it down. I finished, and wanted another. This was a great, no an amazing brew. Founders has done it again. I will be sure to get my hands on this as much as I can."
"o - this beer lives up to the hype."
"M: Very smooth and creamy with a medium body. Carbonation doesn't appear in the head but it's definitely there and perfect for the beer."
"This beer pours nearly pitch black With a very thin mocha colored head that quickly dissipates. The smell is heavy on the bourbon with hints of vanilla and a hint of coffee, there is also a strong roasted malt character to the nose. The flavor is bourbon and slightly boozy a lot of roasty bitterness too barely a hint of vanilla a little more coffee and no residual sweetness. The mouthfeel is thin and lightly carbonated. Overall I was not as impressed by this beer as I thought i would be, the body was too thin there was no residual sweetness and to me it felt like the bourbon and roasted malts were just butting heads."
"D: MOAR"
"Smell and taste are identical, and everything that is promised... coffee, vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, oak. I was happy that the oak is a subtle background flavor as I find many of these barrel-aged beers to have overpowering wood notes. Mouthfeel is nice and thick but very smooth. For such an intense brew it really goes down easy with the alcohol nicely masked. KBS does not disappoint, a must try."
"O) Very good beer but not sure it lives up to the hype. Very nice flavors and wonderful aroma. Very enjoyable. Highly recommended."
"O - This is definitely an excellent beer but there are things that could be improved."
"O - Though you can smell alcohol the taste of it was absent. It went down super smooth and would love to have another one. Definitely one of my top favorite depending on the season and time. Hit the spot just right"
"It's a lot to handle, a thimble would be enough for an evening. Enjoy Responsibly."
"Overall: great beer that lived up to the hype. This is one of the best barrel aged beers I've had. It doesn't overdo the bourbon and leaves enough room for the other flavors to come out. I'm definitely very glad that I had a chance to try this and will hope to score some every year that it comes out. Founders, thanks for coming to New York. You've made my life that much better. Canadian Breakfast Stout, here I come! Cheers!"
"4.5"
"O- I could drink this for breakfast every day of the week."
"O- great stuff that lives up to the expectation. I had some at the EBF but was already 3 sheets."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I had to do some driving as well as some smooth talking just to score a couple of bottles of this. Quite honestly, as good as this is...I don't think that I'd do it again. It's fantastic, but so is FBS, Founders Imperial Stout, Heresy and Ten Fidy among others. If it's easier to get next year, I'll definitely pick some up."
"Overall this might be my favorite beer, period...at the very least it is in my top 5. What really differentiates it from similar styled beers is the sense of blending. The bourbon isn't overpowering and flows beautifully with the chocolate and coffee notes, none of which I feel dominate. It is smooth without feeling heavy and slightly sweet without feeling sticky. You can not be a fan of bourbon and still enjoy this beer.... which says a lot, to me anyway. Get this beer.... but then again you already knew that."
"Into an 8 oz. wine glass this appears the expected black or the darkest brown color with a ""chocolate milk"" tan color head and a consistent lacing. The nose is a lot milder than I would have expected but it's still an attractive one with light notes of coffee bean, cocoa, and vanilla cream. A smooth and creamy malt mouthfeel with a mild and crisp carbonation delivers into a deep and earthy fudge chocolate ice cream noted finish. Caramel also lightly echoes on the palate. As I neared the end of my third and final glass, I also sensed the warming quality reminiscent of a whiskey drink or a cool sipping rum. These were going down so smoothly with such a cleverly hidden abv that I could have had a couple more...Very nice brew and I can't wait to cross paths again soon..."
"It was really an incredible beer, but it's extremely hard to find and a little pricey. I can't argue that it isn't worth the price tag, as it definitely is, but my only complaint is the availability. It's probably better for my wallet that I can't find this everywhere."
"EDIT 2 - Had this, CBS, FBS, FIS, and BLiS syrup as part of a Founders brunch with the Missoula crew. This and CBS were different flavors of awesome together, though for me this won by just a nose."
"Delightful! One of those beers that practically brings tears of joy -- it's that good. Smells great and tastes even better. Beautifully balanced flavors of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and a hint of bourbon. It pours thicker than most and presents a delicious looking head. Founders has a real winner here."
"o- very good beer. i can see why people love it soo much. i will definitely seek out more sometime in the future, good think i got a few more, i bet next year this guy will be great as well. founders continues to impress me with a solid line of beers."
"2011 bottle poured into nonic. Color is black with brown edges, a bit light in color compared to most double stouts, and a tiny mocha collar. Smells strongly of oak and bourbon, chocolate, some vanilla, some coffee and a bit of alcohol. Taste is mostly oak and bourbon, some chocolate and coffee, roasted malts, light alcohol, very little hop presence, an unfortunate old cardboard taste in there as well. Harsh oak in the finish. Mouthfeel is very watery for the style with a low carbonation. I know people love this beer, but i think it is average at best and would prefer many other stouts, especially at the price."
"O: Best stout to-date that I have tried. Very lucky to have found this beer on tap weeks after it sold out in the stores the day it arrived."
"D-well, this is the greatest stout i've ever had. this beer will put you in such a great and happy mood. i'm so sad this is my only bottle of it.i'll be savoring this for awhile. the i drink it, the more hints of vanilla and spices i pick up."
"O: I'd have to say that the CBS was better once it warmed up, but the KBS was solid through and through. Perhaps I should have realized that the CBS needed some warming up to do, but this beer was reminiscent of the bottle version, only with a smoother finish and less of an alcohol bite, but not as good on the smell due to the serving vessel."
"Overall - I was certainly glad I came out to the event and got to try this elusive beer, and now want to try a fresh version."
"O- I try not to give such high ratings but this beer exceeded my expectations. I was a little worried at first that this would be good but fall short, and did not do so in any way. This is very drinkable, and I'm ever so grateful to have tried this due to its limited availability in PA. I can't imagine it being much better fresh as people say but I'll gladly be a test subject any time for that."
"Poured into a snifter. Dark and heavy with minimal foam. The initial smell was not very exciting. Dry earthy coffee smell with some malt that improved as it warmed. The taste also improved as it warmed up. The first taste was upfront coffee and roasted grains with a alcohol finish. As the beer warmed up the alcohol disappeared and was replaced with a nice coffee molasses finish. Not as sweet as I expected but overall excellent. Deep dark burbon and coffee. As good as it gets."
"D - This is one hardy beer, definitely not a sessioner, though a big RIS fan could certainly kill a few of these based on the high quality. One of the best beers I've ever had."
"O - This is a very good bourbon stout, but lacking any other complexity besides a bourbon profile."
"Overall- This beer does not mess around. Truly one of the best beers in the world. This fresh is better than BCS, it is not harsh at all, and the bourbon flavors are melded perfectly with the imperial stout base without needing to give it time to ""mellow""."
"O- Heavy, not a session beer but a few glasses would be very enjoyable"
"Notes: I've had a couple vintages of this brew over the years, and my real complaint with it is about texture. It reminds me of really strong coffee that has some grounds that snuck out of the filter into the pot. I'd like to see more of the bourbon flavor which is fairly understated in this brew. Tasty, and fairly dry for the style standard. Not my favorite bourbon barreled stout though."
"poured into a 25 oz snifter. typical black with chocolate milk colored head disappears rather quickly. smells like cocoa and booze. seems like the alcohol is present right from the getgo. It's pleasant, but I didn't expect my nostrils to flare like that. the taste is a lot smoother than I expected from the smell very tasty. less coffee than a FBS, this one has more of a chocolate taste to it. Hints of vanilla start to show as I get toward the end of the glass, along with the bourbon I felt was missing in my first few sips. It's understood that FBS is not the base beer, but want to note it tastes more like a barrel-aged FIS. Definitely weaker on the bourbon, which some may think is lacking, but for me this is better. Mouthfeel is chewy and thick. very nice, and slightly creamy. Drinkability is incredible given the ABV, it's very nice and smooth and just an awesome drink. I had previously reviewed this one with about 9 months on it, but after having it a few more times and finally getting it fresh, I'm letting this review stand as this is what it should probably taste like."
"O- Definitely world class, definitely original in terms of Bourbon Barrel aged beers, this brew has tons of complexity and flavors to pick out. One needs to sit on this one and contemplate all it can offer your palette."
" ~ There's a reason this beer is so highly regarded. Its because all its characteristics are so well played. This is a beer you must try. Even at $23 a four pack, this beer is worth the cost."
"This is a grade A+ #1 Bourbon Barrel Beer. Exceptional in flavor and Quality. What a great brew from Founders. Try this for sure it is amazing"
"i couldnt ask for a better impy stout. complex, rich, creamy, nothing off about it. the coffee is what really made this for me. this definatly lives up to all the hype."
"O: I'm glad this beer comes in 4 packs. It's not a ""1-bomber beer."" This is one you would reach for every time at the liquor store if it was always on the shelves. I've heard people buy cases of this stuff. I don't blame them. Unfortunately I could only get hold of two this time, and I always look forward to more as extras."
"This was the big winner at ThirstyFest - a craft beer festiva sponsored by the Thirsty Monk. The keg didn't make it through the day. Nothing real unusual about it - its exactly what you would expect. A coffee-heavy Russian Imperial Stout with Bourbon barrel aging. There are no curve balls. What distinguishes it is that is such a fantastic example of this style. The bourbon flavor is definitely there, but not overwhelming. This is just a great beer. Drink one at any opportunity you get."
"At least if I and any of my 4 friends here have anything to say about it."
"Often, such a hyped and highly rated beer turns out to be merely a very good beer that is hyped and has high ratings. That's not the case here. An incredibly complex and well balanced bourbon barrel aged stout that doesn't hit you over the head with the fact that it's barrel aged."
"Overall this is a very fine beer. Complex, smooth, great taste. Very enjoyable to sip and ponder it's complexities. It is not the best in it's class, but it is pretty dam close."
"D - Nice, smooth sipper. Its good to split with another person or just enjoy by the fireplace. Pretty delicious barrel aged stout, but I just wish it wasn't so expensive. I know this will age very nicely since I have a few bottles from last year in the closet. Lives up to the hype, but compared to some other usual barrel aged stouts (BCS) it is just pretty good."
"-Cheers"
"D-One of the best I have had, I felt like everything was incorporated very nicely, and the ABV is hidden very very well. I recently had Peruvian Morning (great beer, don't get me wrong) but I feel like Founders did a much better job using the coffee to add complexity, rather that just adding another ingredient. This beer truly lived up to the hype."
"Overall, this stout does not disappoint. Thick and syrupy, black as night, and delicious. I'm glad I scored some this year, looking forward to cellaring a bottle or two!"
"Drinkability is excellent. The bourbon makes this a little boozy but it really enhances the flavor and the nose. Wish this wasn't so limited and expensive."
"As I had my last sip of KBS I kept thinking to myself that I am sooo glad I have a second bottle in my fridge."
"Overall, this beer is very well balanced it may be a little boozy for my taste but that is what your getting into with a bourbon aged stout. It's Founders Breakfast Stout with added complexity. Really Good!"
"Overall, this is one of the best bourbon stouts I have ever had. It's hard to get my hands on them, but this one still stands out amongst the others that I've had."
"This is an excellent stout. I've had a few of Founder's other offerings and so far this is their best."
"O: Gets a bit heavy and syrupy, but smells amazing, and is still a delicious beer... wouldn't drink it all the time though... we have Breakfast Stout for that."
"Pours black with a one-finger dark chocolaty brown head...looks delicious! Lacing is amazing on this...once again looks delicious (mouth waters). Awwww bourbon! But not over powering, very well balanced with chocolate and coffee. I love bourbon, it's right up front on this one but no heat, ""awesomely"" balanced...followed by sweet chocolate, malts, and a bitter coffee... soooo delicious! This is so smooth and velvet like. Overall drinkability...well I'd consume a shit-ton of it if I had access to it...for me it's out of area and I paid a fantastic beer store in NJ a premium to ship me 2-4 packs (average cost per bottle $11.29 incl. shipping)...it's worth it to me once a year. Highly drinkable...hard to find, worth the extra yes."
"Good but i still go all hands down by price , taste, smell, and appearance to bourbon county"
"O- Awesome beer and a great sipper. A little hot, but in a good way. I would really like to see what this would be like with some age on it."
"Pours a very deep, deep black with a one-finger dark brown head. Traces of the head stick around and the lacing is above average for the style. Aroma of bourbon mostly, also hints of chocolate and coffee. The bourbon leads the flavor profile. It's definitely the highlight. Really nice. You get the bourbon flavor without the alcohol heat. Awesomely integrated with the vanilla, chocolate and coffee flavors of the Breakfast Stout. The vanilla, chocolate and coffee play second fiddle, but are there. Really smooth and again, just very good overall flavor."
"D: Not an everyday drinker by a longshot, but its damn delicious. Its rich yet rough from the bourbon taste. All around its an amazing flavor experience."
"This one easily lives up to its billing, no small task given its well-established reputation and that of Founders. KBS has, for me, joined the long litany of Founders legends and is also ensconced at the top of my favorite stouts. This beast is the stuff of legends; simply amazing."
"D- 4.5 One thing I love about this complex, beautifully crafted stout ale is that it really isn't that complex to decipher. All of its flavors are pronounced in their respective ways as it is balanced perfectly. It is definitely high in volume and flavor... And unfortunately, price. At $23.99 / 4-pack, it lost some of its ""drinkability"" for me before I was able to snag it off the shelf (or should I say from the employee who brought it out to me from the back room of the last store in town to have it stocked). Honestly, it is just so limited, so expensive, and so powerful that I couldn't see myself drinking more than one (maybe two on a special night). I'd rather hoard it! I'm wishing now that I would have saved one from last year to compare it with vertically... I'll be sure to do that for the 2012 batch! Excellent beer."
"Overall: You know this is a big beer. Costs a ton, aged a year, and as Van Halen says ""everybody wants some.", and after this first tasting session I know why. It's statement of the obvious to say this brew has a huge personality. There's a a ton flavors that float around in the background...vanilla, oak, cocoa, oatmeal...go on and on. The sweetness doesn't seem to be malt, but from any of dozens of dark fruits and brown sugar variations. It's presence in the mouth is almost 3D, creamy and oily. And if you like the taste of whiskey fire, buddy this is your beer. Some might argue it's not the best brew in America, I think it's in the running. And, it shows the strength of the mid-west's dominace of the american whiskey(bourbon) barrel aged brews."
"So glad that I found this beer. Not much to say for the head or for lacing but the full body flavor makes up for it. Deep dark color has a nice creamy ring around the top but not much else. Alcohol smell is a little noticeable in the nose but not to an extreme. Roasted Malts and vanilla show through on this one. Great stout And I would recommend this to anyone."
"Overall: Great beer. The heat is acceptable for an 11+% stout. Could I drink this every day? No, but this is a fantastic beer to go to on a cold spring day."
"In the end, I thought the 2011 would be far superior, but it's very close. Trying to pick a favorite is like trying to pick a favorite child. I think the fresh bottle has the slightest upper hand in the aroma, though I think I prefer the 2010 by just a hair in the flavor department for allowing more of the dark chocolate flavors to shine through. Regardless, I would take either vintage over any other imperial stout I've had any day of the week. I cannot say enough good about this beer--it truly is my favorite beer and I am someone who generally has difficulty listing my favorite of anything. Absolutely phenomenal."
"Overall: No doubt, this is a great beer. The flavours are complex and strong and the bourbon is perfectly attuned. That being said, where I come from, beer drinkers draw battle lines over the best bourbon barrel beer. I fall on Goose Island's side. As good as KBS is, it doesn't reach the level of BCBS, especially considering it was twice as expensive."
"O- Wow, thought this might be a booze bomb, but is incredibly well balanced and dangerously drinkable. One of the tastiest and most unique beers I've had in a while. Have another bottle to age and hoping to grab a couple more bottles."
"O - Yep, this stuff lives up to the hype. Just stellar aged stout. I look forward to aging my other 3 bottles!"
"O/D: This is a very drinkable high gravity stout, with great flavors and smooth body I could drink a couple of these. Seeing as it is ""highly acclaimed"" and treated like gold, I can see why now. Great brew."
"Oh, LT, it was pretty alright."
"KBS is a great beer. I'm not going to say it's over-hyped because it's an excellent beer. There's no denying its' complexity. It's definitely a treat."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, I've been waiting for what seems like an eternity for this beer, and I'm so happy I finally got it. If you can't tell....I'm a huge fan just like everyone else. Believe the hype for this beer. Incredible."
"Great job Founders - another great beer."
"Drinkability is good. Such a smooth beer but the bourbon has a little to much pop after the coffee has faded. The 11.2 ABV is fine with me as I like to get a boozy kick after a half glass; it lets me relax and really lets me enjoy all that this brew has to offer."
"An all-around standout imperial stout. Great balance of bourbon, coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts (in that order), in both the nose and the mouth. This one lives up to its billing. I could drink quite a few, if it wouldn't knock me out. And btw, where's the alcohol? I don't even notice it."
"Definitely one of the thickest beers I've ever had. This is like a coffee and chocolate milkshake with bourbon in it. Lots of bourbon. For its high ABV, I'm very impressed by its drinkability. Give me this over most imperial stouts any day."
"D- The beer as a whole has a very rich flavor and should not be drank as a session beer, but rather a sipping dessert beer on special occasions (unless you were lucky enough to get more than a case). Very worth seeking out if not available in your area."
"In the past 3 years, I preferred 2010 > 2011 > 2012."
"I've had this a number of times and am just getting around to reviewing it. While I do like this beer and think it's great, it's just never been world class to me."
"This bottle cost almost as much as a six-pack of Schlitz and it was completely worth it."
"O: Does this live up to the hype? Absolutely. I can honestly say this was even better than I imagined, and I had high expectations. Probably the most perfectly balanced bourbon barrel aged stout. When I first tried a BCBS, I thought it we be perfect if the heat was turned down (in a year old bottle), the bourbon was less boozy and overpowering, and with a little more depth/complexity. KBS is the beer with those improvements, in my eyes, the perfect balanced bourbon barrel aged beer. It's like a moist, chewy espresso chocolate cake soaked in bourbon with vanilla ice cream... but way better!"
"Dind't know if this would live up to the hype. It sure did for me."
"D: I will drink many more."
"I really wish I lived in the Midwest just so I could pick this up off the shelves, although many haven't been able to do that anyhow."
"KBS lives up to the hype. There's just so much going in a glass of KBS. It really leaves you wanting more and feeling like you'll need a fix soon. If it were more readily available I'd have it on hand all the time. RESPECT THIS BEER."
"O: This tastes like a lil' chuck of vanilla fudge bathed in bourbon then covered in a thick layer of dark chocolate and dipped in bourbon again for good measure. I'm so glad there's snow on the ground to look at while I drink this. I'd welcome a few more inches just so I could run outside to shovel and crack my second bottle as a reward. Spring sucks."
"planning on aging at least one and doing a side by side next year, i planned that last year too and it didnt work out, only time will tell"
"drinkable - who cares ? I'm having another."
"O (D) - This beer tastes great. It is something I want to drink. It's got a high ABV and is a big beer. It's expensive. I would buy this regularly if I could, and even though there are issues with it, overall I think it's quite excellent (taste trumps)."
"Easily the best stout I've had. I've only drank one so far, and plan to share some with friends but I'm already bummed that I won't be seeing this again any time soon. I can't think of one thing to improve here. Just perfect."
"D - Incredibly drinkable. Absolutely no ABV presence, not even when room temp. Honestly, I feel like the slightly-thinner body contributes to a higher drinkability for this particular brew. It doesn't drink like any other stout I've had. It wasn't really necessary to sip this one beyond trying to savor my 6-7 oz."
"O - I love the taste of whiskey, and had been let down by other beers touting ""whiskey barrel"" before, but this one delivers exactly what it was billed as. If I ever want a beer that has a heavy whiskey presence, I'll grab this one first (if I ever find it again). Otherwise, you really have to be in the mood for this sucker!"
"Drinkability: I love this stuff. In 2008 you could walk into a bottle shop and buy a half case 2 weeks after release, now I'm glad to get 4 bottles the day it comes in. Letting it sit for a year is a challenge, but its worth it. Its almost perfect fresh though."
"This is probably one of the best stouts i've ever had..a great sipper!! Only problem with this beer is it's availability, but well worth the price tag!!!"
"Overall: Definitely top 3 stouts, probably #1. Wish I could be more descriptive but its just so damn good."
"Sweet fancy Moses, I could bathe in this stuff. Just great. My remaining three bottles are surely special occasion-type brews, and I'd love to shelve at least one of these suckers for a couple years to mellow them out a bit. But fresh, it's still phenomenal. Off the tap must be heavenly."
"MAKE MORE of this beer already. Struggling to get a four pack or two once a year really sucks. I have not been the biggest founder's fan so far, but this one I would buy all the time if I could."
"Two BIG thumbs up - seek this out."
"O: Overall this was a treat to drink , goes down easy considering the high abv%,very well balanced and blended beer,the flavors come together nicely my taste buds squealed with delight.."
"Overall some serious intense craft and quality while drinking this. This is magic right here, and some great feel. Just for the record the high abv on this is dangerous cause I feel like I could just pound these back like no tomorrow. Part of that stupid drinkability, besides all this sophistication and time put into it, is that it feels like a kids morning chocolate breakfast drink, such as Carnation Instant Breakfast drink. Does this beer taste like bourbon... NO. Emphatically no giving way to a good magic that is masking the alcohol.. It is just a great tasting beer and very unique and done superbly."
"D- This is a big beer, very complex, so much going on when it hits your mouth, another gem from founders."
"Side note: Recently had it on tap with CO2, and it was even better. No notes from that, but it was fantastic."
"D: KBS is an excellent beer, one that I have looked forward to every year since my first taste in 2008 and I will continue to look forward to in the future."
"Overall outstanding. Strong flavors and thick feel, booze is there, but not a booze bomb."
"The mouthfeel is medium and silky smooth. The alcohol is hidden very well by the abundant flavors. I saved a bottle from last year's release and am looking forward to a comparison. I'm certain this only gets better with age. Do your best to get this if you can. Highly recommended."
"Overall: Very nice but also very strong. It opens up quite nicely as it warms, making it a very very good sipping beer."
"Overall: Way to drinkable for a beer of this strength. This was my first tasting of KBS and I can say it was worth the hype. I am super excited to see how it changes in a year."
"in the final analysis this is a truly great beer, the hype and rarity factor notwithstanding. sure does make me appreciate the accessibility of bourbon county stout."
"D: I'm not that much of a fan of bourbon barrel-aged beers, but this is one where the hype is warranted. I'm sure it'd be even better after about a year."
"O: More drinkable than the regular tapped 2011, so good!"
"O: These are both phenomenal beers, but I liked the aged version better in almost every aspect. I do think the coffee was too understated in the 2012 batch, and that the bourbon should be more prominent in every batch of KBS, but overall it's a wonderfully thought out beer. I hope the increase in batch size next year doesn't hurt the quality because I hope to enjoy these for many years to come. (5 / 4.5)"
"Once poured, the brown head faded after a minute or so. None more black black. I get bourbon, a coffee and vanilla hint on the nose. Coffee, chocolate, and slight bitterness toward the end of the sip, which I am guessing could be from the bourbon barrel aging. I didn't expect the bourbon barrel aging to be so subtle. I am usually not the biggest fan of ba's, but this one doesn't even remind me of one because its so balanced. Good carbonation and medium to heavy body. I would drink more than one, but they are so limited, I am lucky just to have this bottle. Overall, I'm glad I got the chance to finally try this one, especially on St. Patty's day. I will seek this one out every year."
"Overall - I thought the beer was very, very good, and indeed deserving to be called a world-class beer. But I was a little disappointed in the balance, I felt like the bourbon was just a little too much for own tastes. Great beer though."
"Excellent brew. I am fortunate to have 2 more bottles left to enjoy this year. This is an amazing stout and if you have the chance to get any of this, you should."
"I just wish this came out more than once a year."
"Very worthy of the hype, and is in league of its own."
"But be careful, this delicious, dessert-like brew will come out of the backwoods and knock you on your ass. Worth the hype and every penny too. Seek it out and sip slowly, this beer is for indulging and savoring. A year on this would make this beer epic."
"Poured into a 10oz. snifter and immediately underwhelmed at the light flooding through the pour and the thinness of the pour. Once in the glass things took a dramatic upturn. Filled the glass black with a slight hint of brown around the edges and a thin head that left some very nice lacing. Smells of heavy roasting, smokey, woody, coffee, chocolate and booze. First taste was bitter heavily roasted coffee and soon the flavor of the wood started to come through along with the bourbon. Despite my wife's disapproval I am a swisher. Every few sips I like swishing around and with this beer I got some tingling on the gums but going back to first impressions I thought it was a little thin for a stout but still very good overall... For the hype and the price I would refrain from going in search of this again but I would casually pick it up if found randomly somewhere and is a great treat and hope it ages well..."
"O: Easily the best stout I have had the pleasure of drinking. If you can find it, buy it."
"I've got to say I'm all in favor of fresh KBS. I like the bite it has & although it isn't as smooth, I think the older bottle was just a little too chocolate & sweet for me - not enough coffee. It's still a spectacular beer from either year & I've still got 1 2010 left to do a 3 year vertical next year but I gotta say - drink it fresh!"
"This should be more of a sipper than it is. The smoothest and most disguised AD/IS I ever recall drinking, with an amazingly complex nose and flavor up the wazoo. Well worth the wait and the money. I feel like I am ripping THEM off."
"After numerous phone calls and a bunch of stops at different bottle shops, I slowly pour into a snifter. Black as night color, giving way to chocolaty head which quickly dissipates and leaves slight lacing. Aromas of chocolate, wood, bourbon, and faint malt. The taste is second to none, bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, oak, with a cohesive coffee flavor pulling everything together. The booze is apparent but melds well with the other flavors and definitely adds to the enjoyment of this beer rather the detracting from it. Mouthfeel is exactly like I remember it to be, silky, creamy, with a touch of carbonation... Overall this is one exceptional stout and well deserving of all its accolades, I just hope I can find some more because I see myself wanting to revisit this one very soon."
"Wonderful beer that lives up to the hype, and around here, there was a lot of hype."
"This is definitely not a beer for a hot summer day, nor is it a beer for a dorm party. Instead, this is a beer that loves to be slowly sipped on and wouldn't mind a thoughtful pairing with a fine cheddar or a strong cigar."
"O: This beer did not disappoint, despite my high expectations. Breakfast Stout with bourbon flavors... what an outstanding idea."
"O - Overall this beer is one of the best I've ever had and it is certainly the best I've had of this style. I thought all the hype might raise my expectations too high, but this beer really came through...well worth the effort and I am ecstatic that I was able to obtain a 4-pk. !!!"
"This brew is exceptional. The best stout I've had bar none. This beats BCBS in almost every category. I paid $25 for a four-pack, and it has been worth every penny so far."
"Truly an outstanding beer, and well deserving of the praise heaped upon it. One of the rare beers where in reviewing, I really had to question whether each category deserved a 4.5 or 5, even going back to reference 10+ of my older reviews for comparison purposes. A case could be made for 5s across the board here."
"D: This is very good but not quite what it is cracked up to be. On the plus side, the bourbon plays more of a supporting role instead of a dominating one."
"Pours a solid black with a thin brown head. Nose is a wonderful combination of coffee, chocolate, caramel, and alcohol. Taste also focuses on the heavy coffee, bitter chocolate and vanilla with some boozy flavor. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Absolutely incredible beer."
"I love FBS and was hoping KBS lived up to the hype, it does in my opinion."
"D: I am really digging this beer and it was worth the wait. Is this the best bourbon aged stout I have ever had? No, that would be left for Goose Island Bourbon County Vanilla Stout. The main difference is that this beer isn't as complex, but again, for a straight forward bourbon aged stout, this is an absolute gem and worth the $20/4 pack"
"Fresh 2011 bottle. Pours black with a cocoa head that fades quick. Does look really good. The smell is fantastic, chocolate, cocoa, well-integrated, not boozy vanilla and bourbon. Just an amazing smell and one I went back for more than seconds on. Chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, booze, this is a really good tasting barrel aged imperial stout. The mouthfeel is medium with reasonable carbonation. Not as heavy as some imperial stouts, but in a good way I'd say. Drinkability is quite high for an 11% barrel aged beer. A very good beer that gets a slight bump from the 12 oz bottles."
"WOW! this beer pours a dark sexy black and leaves a mocha head about two fingers. whafts of sweet delicous malt and coffee/chocolate fill the air around me. I dont think ive ever been so excited to taste a beer like this before based on apprance and sent. yessss! this beer taste better than it looks and smells. Now I can justify all the hype that procedes this beer.KBS just moved in to my all time top five beers. Worth every penny and then some. good work Founders, can't wait to try Canadian version."
"I enjoy KBS no matter what form it is in and this glass is no different. If I had to choose between only having draft or nitro the rest of my life, I would probably take draft KBS. However, if I see nitro available I will surely go for it as delicious and hard to find treat."
"Cheers!"
"Smooth and balanced, this is one heck of a barrel-aged beer. Bourbon can often be overpowering in beers of this type, but here it plays a supporting role, and does an excellent job in doing so. It's obvious why Founders has such a classic on their hands. Amazing fresh, this may have some cellaring potential, but it seems best enjoyed as it is."
"D-Superb!!! For its high abv, it is easy to get into trouble with this stout. I had more than I should of since it was so easy drinking. If you can get this on draft do so immediately and plan to get a taxi because you will want more than one (or two or three) CHEERS!"
"I must say, after waiting nearly two years to try this beer I am not disappointed. Well worth the wait. The coffee and chocolate mix beautifully with this brew. The bourbon while muted is very present and pleasant. I have a case to last me till next years release, I hope it makes it."
"D - Pretty good. Even with the high ABV. it is still very drinkable. The dark flavors can wear on you over the course of multiple servings but it is worth it. I look forward to this release every year and while I like this beer out of the bottle, I love it on-tap. Can't wait to sit down with a draft and see how it shapes up."
"d. very very very very lots of ""very""'s drinkable. its just overall so enjoyable and pleasant that there's no trouble at all taking down a couple bottles, as im doing. there's nothing difficult about it, its pleasant (instead of pungent, strong, intense...), and to me, that's the main appeal."
"D- I stayed at KBS for five drinks over a couple of hours and had two. Probably would have had more, but the abv convinced me to hold off. It is also rich and wasn't sure if my stomach could handle any more. Would gladly drink one every month."
"Serving type: Tap at Founders"
"Mouthfeel is much lighter than I expected. Having trouble scoring it b/c I think it should be thicker, but it works and makes the drinkability great. The drinkability is outstanding, I wanted more and more. By far the most drinkable stout I've had."
"Overall - I am not a huge fan of this beer fresh, as I always find the coffee overpowering. However, with a year on it, this is just unearthly."
"Coffee is the dominant flavor but is very balanced against the background vanilla and oak. It felt very full but not particularly heavy. This KBS was easy to drink, and benefited from slow warming as I drank. If you are hesitant about coffee in your beer, beware, but if you appreciate the flavors, jump right in."
"Drinkability: This isn't a bad beer by any stretch. Given the choice though I would reach for Ten Fidy over this every time. The beer just doesn't balance it's flavors well, it's too boozy and it's best attribute is the finish, rather than it's taste on the palate."
"Holy hell this is good, words can't do it justice. This coming from someone who isn't big on bourbon beers. I recommend doing horrible horrible things to get your hands on some. Drink one now and save some for your wedding/birth of your first child/other life milestones."
"Nope. Sorry, not my style but I can see why some folks love it."
"d: it's a sipper, that is for sure. while you wouldn't want to drink a bunch of these, that is only because it is a rich beer...to be honest with you, you'll only need a few with the high ABV. However, one is VERY drinkable...past that is just not needed."
"Drinkability: Sip worthy, but I want to drink it like a milkshake because its so chocolatey"
"Totally black under a thin, bubbly brown head. Rich dark chocolate and sweetened, oily coffee bean aromas. Light char, a smooth oaky vanilla note, and a whiff of bourbon. Heavy sweet cocoa flavor. Fudgy coffee and bourbon, vanilla bean, sugary espresso. Heavy and silky smooth. Very rich, but damn tasty."
"Two year old bottle is incredible smooth - almost too smooth. All of the warming bourbon heat has vanished from the brew, and the boldness as seemed to have mellowed. An amazing beer, but I think I prefer it with a little bit more heat actually."
"Overall, this was a great vertical tasting with friends with a world class beer. There is a reason this beer has been in the top 10 of the top 100 on BA for a long time now."
"Whoa, right from the first sniff loads more bourbon than I remember from the bottled version. Roasted malt and coffee are no match. Come sippin' time, the bourbon once again drops the hammer. Coffee's actually pretty strong as well. Dark fruit and chocolate are overwhelmed by the bourbon/coffee 1-2 combo, and roasted malts are mostly an afterthought. Holy mackerel this is boozy. Kinda like Bourbon County Stout randalized through chocolate chips and espresso beans. An intense experience, but not something I'd seek out."
"Notes: The first time I got to try this beer was a sample at the Extreme beer fest. Now it's from a twelve ounce bottle and dam it's amazing. Cheers."
"D- This beer is delicious and goes down surprisingly well for this style. I also like that it is not terribly sweet for this style. It IS on the sweet side, but not as cloying as some."
"2010 vintage on-tap during Flying Saucer Raleigh's 11th Anniversary. Served in a tulip glass a deep opaque black with a thin light tan head that diminishes to a ring and leaves slight lacing on the glass. The aroma a nice amount of oak, roasted malts and vanilla. The taste is loads of vanilla and oak in front of roasted malts, cocoa, Bourbon and mild licorice, wonderfully complex. The beer is medium bodied with mild carbonation, very easy drinking for its high abv. This is certainly a wonderful beer, one that lives up to the hype and ages even better!"
"I don't want to write anymore. It is time to sit back and sip this with my eyes closed. Cheers!"
"I cannot wait for the 2011 release!"
"Okay so this was my initial reaction to the beer. I was drinking the KBS outta the fridge, and the FBS outta my cellar. I let it warn for about 20 minutes, but now that it is warmer, so much more flavors are coming out. There is some smoke present, and the warmth has brought out a really terrific roasted coffee and chocolate flavors that weren't as present was it was a little colder. The alcohol is a little more present, but that brings out some more of the strong bourbon barrel notes. Overall, a wonderful beer and I def recant my statement that FBS is better. "
"This beer lives up to the hype!"
"It was very rich, coating and creamy. Carbonation was close to spot on to my liking - not too much, not too little. This was a very superb and drinkable beer."
"D: Extremely smooth, delicious and balanced! Goes down a little too easy. Yes, it lives up to the hype."
"I have had these ranging from fresh to 2 years old. While the beer evolved its character over time, every bottle was excellent."
"Drinkability - By far my most favorite beer, but very hard to get. Stock up if/when you can!!!"
"If I had access to this beer, I would have some on hand when I felt like a great coffee stout."
"All in all, the hype here is definitely justified, and I hope to try the bottled version soon for comparison."
"The beer feels excellent on the palate, but has no head presence. The very full body makes this a meal in a bottle, but a highly enjoyable one at that. Despite the full body, I could probably drink many of these, and would probably pass out very quickly at 11.2%. The alcohol really comes out from the bourbon, but does not take away from the overall flavor. This defines the style of Bourbon Barrel Stout. All beers of this genre should aspire to be at this level. Worth the hype for any doubters out there."
"This is one where we can all agree, the KBS and isn't just for breakfast any more."
"Pitch black with a dark tan head. Lacing throughout. I smell vanilla and oak right off the bat and then some bourbon to follow. Not much roastiness. The bourbon and oak are very present in the smell of this beer. I taste a lot of roasted malt and a little vanilla and oak. The alchohol is a bit intense so i would like to see how this mellows with age. Mouthefeel is extremly creamy. I love it.reminds me off a rootbeer float but with bourbon."
"Living in Oregon, I've grown intimately acquainted with The Abyss. KBS is an entirely different beast -- not even remotely as sweet, with emphasized flavors of coffee, bourbon, and wood. It's also a bit more boozy. Nevertheless, it's a welcome change; the roasted coffee flavors are blended exceptionally well with the sweeter elements and the delicious, almost subversive flavors of bourbon. Drinkability suffers a bit because of the bitterness and booziness, but it's not supposed to be guzzled, it's supposed to be sipped and savored. The Abyss still takes first place in my book, but this beer puts up an honorable fight. I'd buy it frequently if it were readily available, as it fills a niche that other stouts don't. If only I could drink this at work..."
"May not be for everyone, but it is definitely worth trying."
"Notes: As I understood it, the bar owner aged this vessel of KBS for an additional year before tapping it a couple days ago. I could be wrong."
"D- This beer is delicious and goes down surprisingly well for this style. That said, how many 11% ABV stouts do you want to drink in a sitting? This beer would be great with fruit or chocolate deserts. I also like that it is not terribly sweet for this style. It IS on the sweet side, but not as cloying as some."
"Overall - I'm really glad I tried this beer. It is definitely unique and extremely well crafted. I don't think I will be searching it out in the future as the bourbon is not entirely to my taste."
"Very drinkable."
"Loving it. Glad I got to try this classic and it was a good score on my first trade. Thanks for hooking me up John. Will cherish the 2nd bottle for some other special ocassion. Like being particularly awesome ;). Highly recomended."
"Truly a standout. Not much else to say, but as it says on the bottle, this beer ""is good for everything a stout ought to be good for."""
"If I had to pick one beer to drink for the rest of my life, it might just be KBS."
"D: This is a great sipper for a snowed in day, should be the sign of a good night to follow. This is one that is better as it warms slightly, but I find if you wait to long it ends up a little thin and disappointing. Its no real worry though, these go down fairly quickly even sipping."
"The flavor here is quite complex, deep, and rich. A remarkable stout that stands outside the box of other barrel aged stout. It is smooth, drinkable, and has an overall palette-pleasing element. A standout in the world of imperial stouts."
"Re-review from 2011 batch: Love this beer fresh, beautiful lacing throughout, definitely a nice sipper once brew approaches just slightly above room temperature!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Mouthfeel is probably going to be my biggest knock on this beer. It's slightly under full bodied, which is fine, but carbonation is quite low and the resulting feel is pretty slick. It seems to accentuate the bourbon/alcohol component in this beer more than the base flavors. If the malts/chocolate/coffee clung to the palate a bit better my score on this beer would be even higher. That being said, this is still an excellent beer. A good one to sip on and savor."
"Overall this beer is one of the best stouts i'm yet to have."
"Truly a great beer and easily one of the best stouts I've ever had. As far as bourbon barrel stouts go, this gives the Abyss a run for its money. The bourbon character is there but not too strong, which is just right for my taste. I imagine this will hold up quite well for years to come. Very highly recommended."
"Lovely, I thought, as I drove back home."
"D: I would drink these one at a time."
"D: Four a bourbon barreled stout, it is incredibly drinkable. I enjoyed savoring it but could drink it more in a stout/IPA fashion. If you like coffee, vanilla and bourbon flavors in equal amounts, then this is your beer. My taste buds slightly prefer a little more bourbon but liked the sweet bourbon in this one also."
"It tastes fucking amazing with Bourbon upfront and tons of chocolate at the end. The alcohol is present but isnt overbearing. It has a aftertaste of some Bourbon but more chocolate This is my ideal Bourbon aged stout. I wish I could get it more frequently in San Diego. Its very drinkable but I would pull a session with these one, seeing how it would only take one or two to get a good buzz."
"D - this beer is over 11% ABV and it just seems to evaporate in my glass i'm drinking it so quickly. Fantastic job of hiding the alcohol. This beer is worth buying a case at whatever the cost, because if you have one you won't want to stop at that. Wow..."
"D- Amazing for a barrel-aged beer. So smooth and delicious. This one is right at the top of the list"
"Highly drinkable, decadent, enticing. But don't try more than one at a sitting."
"D- This has a good bit of heat still and needs calm down a bit but I still love it"
"D- It's a sipper and there is no contesting that. A nightcap alternative that many people would be hard pressed to beat. I think you could turn a bourbon drinker into a KBS follower pretty easily."
"Cheers!"
"Went down very nice after a long day of shoveling during a blizzard. Warms the body nicely."
"The CPJ"
"Drinkability: This is a serious stout. The high ABV is well hidden by the overall well balanced design of this beer. Definitely a stout to savor. One is great but several would be better"
"This is a medium bodied brew that is surprisingly lighter than expected. It is modestly carbonated presenting just enough bubbly on the tongue. This is a bold and tasteful brew that was enjoyed on a cold snowed-in day and is equally enjoyed as a nightcap or by the fire. Don't let it fool you, for all the beers that are out there that masterfully hide the amount of alcohol they have, this one is bold and out in the open. However, what makes this brew stand apart from the rest is that the boldness of the alcohol works perfectly with the other flavors included. Awesome stuff."
"Altogether a pleasant drinking experience and I'm looking forward to the next serving!"
"I have had this beer on many occasions at this point, and everytime I have it I always say to myself: This is the beer I could drink for the rest of my life. The smell is really what makes this beer stand apart from many others. It is of rich coffee, chocolate and bourbon. I wish they made scented candles that smell like this beer. Also for something that is over 11% ABV I could drink it as fast as I want. Truly deserves the recognition that it gets."
"After this many reviews, I can't say much that hasn't been said already. Simply stated, this is one of my top 10 beers. I find it more drinkable than most beers above 10% and pick up more of the flavors than other beers...both of which can be attributed to the quality of the beer. Love it and cannot wait for it to be released again. Look forward to having it on draft sometime."
"D - This beer is phenomenal , definitely will be aging some bottles."
"This beer is pitch black with the slightest dark brown edging against the light. Brown head was not retained well but that wasn't surprising. Smell was a nice mixture of roasted malts, chocolate, bourbon and vanilla. Taste was much the same with the chocolate and bourbon fighting each other for dominance. The vanilla and some molasses do make an appearance later on, which is nice. The subtle nuances of this beer come out as it warms. Heavy in the mouth with some burn, but in a good way. Absolutely delicious beer and I can see how some age brings out its different components."
"D = yes, all night, no probl3m"
"12 oz. bottle from Beer Baron - Livonia (bought it in March 2010). Snifter. Pours deep black with very little head. Nose of vanilla, coffee and alcohol/bourbon barrel. Very balanced taste. Smooth and creamy mouth-feel with a nice bourbon finish. Great beer!"
"pretty drinkable for its high abv and richness though definitely a sipper."
"Hot damn, I love this beer. I can never get too much of this stuff."
"Overall this is the best stout i have ever have and really can't see anything about it I would change for my personal taste aside from the appearance, wish there was more head. Some burbon lovers would probably prefer more bourbon flavors. But this us just how I like it!"
"D: Love this beer. Probably would not session it, but wonderful to have when you just want something amazing. Quality not quantity is the idea here, especially since I can not even get this is NY."
"Drinkability- off the charts for something this high in ABV. Very well balanced and easy to put down for a barrel aged stout."
"My only regret is that it's taken me this long to try this beer. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants and exceptional stout."
"(review from notes)"
"Obviously this beer is awesome. Period. I kept thinking about pouring it over pancakes."
"A stout lovers dream! I think this is fresh (thank you iowahawk for gifting it upon me), and will likely get even more smooth with time. But this is certainly one of the elite imperial stouts, even without age on it."
"Best Founders beer IMO and has found a permanent spot on my WANTS list."
"Drinkability- Definitely something one can finish, moving onto a second one right after might be tough. This is a beer to enjoy at the end of the night."
"Full body, lower carbonation, ultra smooth on the tongue. Probably one of the best drinking bal aged stouts ever. This is exceptional fresh and with age, either way."
"D- this is a definite sipper but it is one you want to savor forever, this beer is perfect in my opinion and it has only gotten better with age, it is extremely hard going back to other stouts after having this a couple of times, founders' best brew hands down"
"Deep, viscous black liquid fills my tulip, topped with a long lasting light tan head. No lacing, but I can almost see legs on the side of the glass. Rich vanilla and oak wafts through the air, maybe a touch less intense than expected. The chocolate and roasted barley is somewhat muted but there is definitely some coffee and cream. Flavor is bursting!! Very nicely done. Initial sweetness of toffee, caramel, and vanilla is followed quickly with a hint of burnt toast and leather, then bourbon rounds out the end adorned with a nice dose of freshly ground coffee. Wow. Exceptional smoothness and perfectly carbonated. I am truly impressed. Alcohol sneaks up on you... afterward haha. Please sir, can I have some more?"
"D - glad I tried it once. Left me never wanting another."
"After trying this beer nearly one hundred times, I must say that this is not only one of the best barrel-aged stouts, but one of the best beers I have ever had in my life. Simply terrific."
"Conclusion: an excellent bourbon stout but it ends a little too harsh"
"Well I am very thankful that I now understand the love that this beer receives, though now I only want more! This was incredibly well balanced, and hid the 11% ABV extremely well."
"Completely different than the Breakfast Stout. A behemoth of a beer. Absolutely awesome. One of the most intense beers I have had if not the most intense. Only need one of these and you'll have a buzz. Can't help but appreciate this beer's superior flavor."
"I NEED MORE!!"
"Overall: a very good beer but I was sort of disappointed because of that bitter finish at least in the bottle I had."
"A commoner, rather than imperial stout."
"Drink- I was thinking of giving a buddy a bottle for X mas. F that all 4 are mine. If you can grab one by all means do it. Give up something to get something GRAND!!"
"A very complex but smooth big beer that I could have a few of in one sitting. Surprisingly drinkable. Great brew!"
"D: Alcohol isn't completely hidden, so is a sipper at first. But at 11%, the more you drink, the more you can drink. Would do these all day long."
"It's hard to overstate how terrific this beer is. KBS is worth bending over backwards for and for that, I truly appreciate Jeff including this."
"Overall, I was blown away by this beer. Im a big fan of the regular breakfast stout and IMO this stuff is even better... Id love to get my hands on some 4 packs of this..."
"I waited to review this again after the last batch had the intrusive peppery notes (which some others in my group didn't get) that gave it a less than stellar showing. This is from a different batch, and is distinctly more pronouncedly green (and noticed by all) to its deteriment. Have to assume that it's a characteristic of this beer, and it's not to my taste."
"M/D: Full bodied, but very smooth and extremely easy drinking. Sits warm in my stomach. One of my favorite beers so far."
"T-- This is what I want to wake up to in the morning when camping, or, well on any occasion. This is GOOD. Bourbon in the right amounts and keeps the essence of what a good stout should be. ABV is scary hidden. Even once it gets warm it is just very well hidden. A sipper in every way but this is world class. To me captures what being a cowboy was in the 1890's and pouring a cold coffee that has had a touch of bourbon in it from the night before when he woke up and is getting ready to drive more cattle."
"Very drinkable at 11.2%, a sipper without a doubt..."
"D: Believe the hype! This brew is truly on of the best in the entire world IMO. At the beginning of the session, I was wrapped up in a blanket in front of the fire watching TV. At the end of the session, the blanket was off and my body was totally warm. The brew warms the body, heart, and soul!"
"Drinkability: for this style incredibly so no flavor kills another but w/ this abv will make you reign it in. Value: it takes great ingredients to make a great beer and you will pay more for it. There are many reasons this is limited."
"I really do wish this was readily available around me because I would definitely buy and drink this regularly. I'll admit, I had very high expectations going into this brew, and it met them handily. I just wish there was more to go around! Definitely deserving of its spot in the pantheon of top tier beers."
"Dammit, KBS. I'm going to have to make a shift in the ratings here on account of 2 of the 3 bottles now that I've had not being at all up to the amazing record. Only the middle bottle has been outstanding. The first was crazy over the top coffee, this one currently is bourboncentric. Those two were from the same trade. Zany, yes."
" Fortunately for me, Matt had many other top notch offerings that did not disappoint!"
"D: Alcohol is prevalent so it may slow down the drinking a bit. Otherwise, if it wasn't for its 11.20 ABV I would be downing these like no other."
"2009 edition"
"I can't get this in Oklahoma, and at 11.2%, i don't think i would want to drink very often if i could. This is definitely an interesting beer to try, but probably not one i would want to drink again and again. Thank you Beerwolf for the opportunity to try this beer."
" I wanted to."
"Side note: I want to make KBS and Brooklyn Black OPS into creatures and watch them fight."
"Opinion: I would drink this everyday if I could, especially now that its winter. Sadly though I am stuck half a country away from the nearest distribution point. =( I miss you already KBS."
"D: Definitely a sipper. Yet I find it difficult to hold back and just sip and savor it, it's so delicious. Kudos to Founders for putting this in a 12oz-a bomber would be too much. Very happy to have a few if these, as I'm excited to see what some more age does for this beer."
"Verdict: Really in a class of its own, this is unique, robust and a must try."
"Into a tulip glass, it poured black with one finger of brown head that retained and laced extremely well. Smelled of oak, chocolate, chocolate milk, hazelnut liqueur, modest licorice, and cherry-vanilla. The taste was a fantastically balanced mixed of the aforementioned flavors, with a cherry-vanilla/modest alcohol-presence finish, and leaving a spiked chocolate milk aftertaste. No carbonation, and medium to full thickness...like liquid silk on the palate. This is another one of those beers that you would think could not be sessioned, yet it goes down extremely easily. Absolutely outstanding beer."
"Pours extremely dark brown/black, with two fingers of dark tan head that leaves a beautiful lacing.  Smells are bourbon, coffee, oak and brown sugar.  Tastes are brown sugar at front, bourbon, coffee, slight vanilla, man there are a lot of flavors going on here.  Mouthfeel  is pretty chewy, drinkability is a sipper for most, but I could drink 2-3 by myself."
"Enjoyed for the second time and man could I drink this every day. Pours dark as night with a hint of brown and nice smooth tan head. Nice lacing which held to the last sip. Aroma of bourbon, sweet chocolate and booziness. Hits the tongue and burnt coffee and dark chocolate come first followed by just the right hint of bourbon and caramel or toffee and very slight booziness which is masked so well I could easily drink 3 more. Just slightly better than GIBCS with respect to drinkability but both are hard to beat when it comes to BB aged stouts."
"Served from tap into a goblet at the Founders event at Duckworth's. Poured a deep dark brown basically black with a minimal tan head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, bourbon, brown sugar, and molasses. The flavor was of roasted malt, spices, bourbon, and molasses. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this is and always will be quite an excellent brew. This one that we had could use a little age on it to help mellow out the bourbon flavor some as it was quite hot. Still great regardless of this fact with a pretty awesome flavor and nice aroma to go along with it. Glad I got to try this one on tap."
"bye"
"This one lives up to the hype and then some. Great beer that should be enjoyed now...and later. Another Founders beer that has me wishing for distribution in CO."
"I could (and would if it were distributed in my area) drink several of these at a sitting. This might just be the best imperial stout I've ever had. For me the high alcohol content would limit its drinkability and is the only non-5.0 rating I've given this exceptional beer. While I couldn't taste the heat of the alcohol, I certainly could feel it."
"Pours pitch black, less than half a finger of DARK brown head, leaving some bubbles and a collar in its wake. Lacing is trace. Nose is wonderful: loads of dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon, a general lovely roastiness, more coffee, a touch of alcohol. Taste is bourbon sweetness upfront with some molasses and licorice, melds seamlessly with lots of coffee and some lesser chocoalte. Lingering alcohol burn in the throat; long, long finish. Nose and flavour alternates between being dominated by either bourbon or coffee as it warms, pleasing everytime I raise this to my nose. Very warming, smooth, creamy and sweet in the mouth with some stickiness. Excellent drinkability for the ABV."
"Linger: 4"
"Perhaps I've matured into appreciating (bourbon) barrel-aged beers much more than I did a few months ago. After revisiting, there was no reason this deserved a score so low from me. It's one of the best barrel-aged, carefully crafted Imperial Stouts out there."
"Was definitely glad to have this one. I've been looking forward to it. It was good, but not my favorite of this style. I wish it was BCS, frankly."
"Pours the blackest of blacks with a nice very dark tan head that dissipated quickly, leaving some nice lacing on the glass. The smell is great. It smells of Dark malts, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, oak, and coffee. Tastes awesome. Coffee and chocolate, with the bourbon taste coming through well. There is also a nice sweetness to this beer that seems to stay in your mouth for a while. The mouthfeel is great for this type of beer. Very heavy body with low carbonation. Coats the mouth very well and really lets you taste the beer very well. The drinkability is very good with this beer even though it is definitely a slow sipper. It took me a long time to finish my glass of this, I had a great time doing it though. I really loved this beer and I think founders did a great job making it. This will be the perfect beer for the middle of winter. Great job founders. Cheers."
"Overall - I have had KBS many times. New. Old. Fresh. Aged. Honestly, this beer is over-hyped and under-performing. It has complexity but nothing meshes together, and I fear too much would put my in a diabetic coma... A decent (not great) beer that is nowhere near Founders best offering."
"O: Worth every single penny. Fantastic. The hype is deserved."
"This famous beer has come out of my cellar for a taste 6 months later. The pour was black with a multi toned tan to dark brown head that falls to a thin line of foam with large legs and some irregular lacing. The smell is awesome complex, coffee, boozy overtones and a bit of roasted malt and sweet hints of some malt somewhere out in the beer. i found the taste to be complex (understatement) and strong. I taste a hint of chocolate at the front of my tongue. I then am smashed with the collage of coffee, booze, and roasted malt flavors. i also tasted a hint of metal flavor from the extreme amount of strong coffee flavors. The mouthfeel is exceptional and that is all I am going to say about this. I have one more from this year in my cellar so it will remain fro another 6 months to a year. Good beer"
"Pours a dark coal with almost no head. It smells of oak and bourbon with a little coffee and hints of dark sugars. The mouthfeel is not quite as full and bready as I expected. It's sharp and bubbly on the tongue, sticky and fairly warm, slightly bitter. The taste is very complicated with the obvious bourbon. The alcohol is fairly strong. Slightly malty with a hint of coffee and chocolate. There's definitely a lot to this beer I don't know how to describe. Kind of a burnt caramel maybe with some vanilla undertones. I quite like it and this beer seems to improve with every drink. What a fantastic brew! It's pretty strong, so I don't know how many I could drink, but I'm pretty sure I'd like to find out."
"All in all, a great sipper. I consider it a pretty ""hot"" beer, with a little too much ethanol noticeable in the flavor even for 11% abv. But I love the depth and flavor progression and the way the coffee fits in with the rest of the beer."
"Drinkability - I could drink more than one of these at a sitting but because of the availability I have to conserve my bottles. I only have 8 left for the next 4 months L"
"Ii'll definitely be on the lookout for this. But it's a little difficult to find and the alcohol content is kinda high. Would be hard to have often. I will definitely go outta my way to get this however."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Smell was amazing, and what I expected after wanting to try it for some time. Smell of chocolate and roasted malts swirled throughout the glass. Oaky and and slight bourbon floated on the palate. Genuine beer lives up to its reputation. Small head lingered for the first few sips. Great beer to chill to. Smoother and sweeter as it cooled down. Great 'til the last sip. Savored every moment."
"The KBS pours an absences of light topped with a nice sandy brown finger of foam. The aroma is most notably similar to well aged bourbon whiskey. The main difference is there is a wonderful bouquet of coffee, chocolate, bourbon, oak, vanilla and smoked malts that create a splendid melange of aromas for the nose. The taste is quite similar. There are the distinct flavors of a really good mocha coffee and bourbon whiskey to warm the cockles of the heart. Oak is one of the most prominent flavors on the tongue followed by hints of vanilla and butterscotch. The chocolate flavor works really nicely with the whiskey. The mouthfeel is interesting. The alcohol and bitterness which are indeed flavors are only preemptive of the smoothness that follows. This is a sipper by nature but goddamn if it isn't tasty and velvety smooth. I only have 2 thumbs to put up, but I wish I had more to tell you how good this beer is as a recommendation."
" Good beer? Yeah. Over hyped? For sure. Would love to try a version with less or without coffee."
"D: I could sit and sip on one of these and not get tired of it for quite some time, very drinkable but I wouldn't drink to many with the price of over $6 for a single 12oz bottle."
"Pours an oily black with a nice tan head that disappeared almost instantly. The aroma is strong coffee, light bourbon, alcohol, roasted chocolate, roasty all around. The flavor was also strongly coffee, chocolate, light bourbon again, alcohol is well contained, vanilla extract shows. Different taste for an impy, not quite as sweet. The palate is smooth and rich. Alcohol finishes warm and creates a mild warmth in the stomach. Excellent beer."
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable beer. A completely different beer than the Breakfast Stout. Definitely seek this out when it is available."
"Smooth and creamy mouth feel, not the thickest stout I've had, but about what I would expect from a barrel aged stout. The heat has gone down a little in the six or so months since KBS came out earlier this year, but it's still a little on the hot side. Definitely a sipping beer, but one that I enjoyed every drop of."
"Lived up to all the hype it gets. Excellent brew, got to get my hands on to some more of this stuff."
"D - would've been a 5, but it's still pretty hot. I'm sure it would be outstanding in a year+, but I just couldn't wait."
"Drinkability- two glasses in and loving it :)"
"Overall, an amazing beer. So complex and wonderfull."
"D - If this were readily available It would be a wonderful go to beer to always drink."
"This lived up to the hype, although I would have difficulty pairing it with any meal ... even more so than bourbon, as this would not work at all as an aperitif. This beer is so strong, and so lasting that the Old Rasputin I drank an hour later didn't make a dent in my mouth. **** me."
"One of the most hyped beers I've had the opportunity to try, and this doesn't disappoint. Nearly perfect on every level."
"D: Amazing at this high of an ABV. But I don't care about this review anymore. I have someone special waiting on me to finish this. We need our alone time."
"D: Love it, a great beer, couldnt drink too too much of this at once though."
"had this at a beer bar near by. Was way over priced but had to try at least once. Was quite good and the alcohol was never there and could drink a few. For the price, eh not so much. The beer was good, but would stick to something else though even though this is quite good."
"D - Glad I got to have this, but I feel that the huge bourbon character in the aroma and taste overpower any other complexities that may be in it."
"Id def get more of these if they were not so pricey"
"Overall - A total sipper beer, meant to be Enjoyed slowly with each drink. Smoth, yet strong, only issue with this beer is the price and avaibilty. This jewel should be made year round, and it it was, it wouldnt hurt my thoughts on it, just add to how many times a week id drink it. One of thee best beers on the planet!"
"M: Silky smooth, leaving little to ask for. Carbonation is lively, but does not kill the flavor. The finish is medium. It could benefit from a bit more body."
"When I had it first, I thought it was the best beer I ever had. Still belongs in my ""all time best beers"" category and for a beer of this kind, there's only one that comes close or equals or possibly exceeds it by a tiny bit: Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout. Can only be determined in a side by side tasting, yet to come. KBS is good for everything a stout ought to be good for."
"D: The booziness is wearing down my palate. It's a good, interesting beer, but the hotter bourbon notes are tiresome. Maybe, if I had more appreciation for bourbon, I'd feel differently."
"D- I would always keep these around if I could. I hear it's inexpensive, if you can get it on the shelf. Very good."
"On an unrelated note, this is a great experience for me. When I first was getting into good beer, I tried a KBS and though it was OK. So glad I had another to try and I appreciate it ten-fold. Phenomenal."
"I can see why this beer is so highly ranked it tastes great, truly one of the better tasting beers I've had yet. A big thank you to MasterSki for sending this one my way"
"D: Overall, an excellent beer. The fact that it's not all that hard to come by in the Midwest is a major plus. I probably would have given this a slightly higher overall score, If it only wasn't for the bourbon barrel plead the fifth I had last week that was out of this world."
"The more I drink the more I suspect this beer simply will NOT age, so drink fresh like an IPA and savor it."
"I recently had the pleasure of drinking this fine beer. It has one of the most complex flavor profile's I've tried. It is a very strong coffee smell and taste along with some nice caramel notes. I'm reminded of Kahlua and cream. I loved this beer and yet again am proud that I live in MI with so many fine breweries."
"Thanks Jeff for giving me the chance to try this one!"
"Bottle. Pitch black pour, almost no head. Aroma is really strong I could already smell the coffee while it was pouring. Strong coffee notes, bourbon, booze and tobacco. Taste is a potent mix of espresso coffee and bourbon. Palate is actually dissapointingly thin with huge bourbon/alcohol burn on the end. Good, but still, generally dissapointing. Very hard to drink."
"Over all Founders KBS is an almost perfect stout. Compared to the big boys of the top 100, KBS IMO stands out as the reigning champ. This brew would make good ol' Jim Beam proud."
"Drinkability:This beer is amazingly balanced, and very complex, founders did an great job this year. Delicious."
"D: it drank pretty damn good considering the ABV on the beer and was really living up to all the hype. I have to say that it is a beefed up regular breakfast stout and is a brew you definitely have to share with friends."
"Overall, great beer...I can't wait to try this again and hopefully buy more of it next time."
"M - Thick and creamy. Bourbon coats the mouth."
"Pours like ink. Black body with a small and quickly leaving brown head. Alcohol legs and good lacing. Aroma of black coffee, chocolate, dirt, minerally, and light bourbon. Taste is bourbon, chocolate, and dark coffee. Syrupy mouthfeel, little lively bubbles and a long finish. Good beer, but does not live up to the hype for me."
"I love KBS. There is no way around it. I consider it worth double the money I paid for it and would recommend this brew to anyone and their mother. World Class indeed!"
"M: Smooth, supple and with good carbonation. Feels like a stout. It is sticky though!"
"D - Slightly too alcoholic to have much more than one bottle; however, it is very enjoyable."
"Overall, one of the best beers in the style, deserving of all the praise that it gets."
"D. This is an exceptional stout. It is so smooth and well balanced. It drinks like a beer of 5% abv. Founders puts out some excellent beers, and this one is top of the list imho. Delicous!"
"Definetely a classic, and always a welcome bottle in my cellar. I will update this review with the review of an 08 and 09 soon."
"Overall, a truly gorgeous beer in many ways. Complex, balanced, and flavorful. Definitely deserving of its place on BA. That being said, it is not my favorite bourbon stout. Still highly recommended."
"A real one."
"D - Sharing with friends would prolong my ability to consume these, but fairly average drinkability for the style."
"Exceptional brew that makes me glad that I live in MI."
"Finish: Great glass of bourbon, thicker, richer, and I won't say cheaper but yum how sticky it is on the lips"
"Great job Founders."
"Looking forward to keeping my eyes peeled for more KBS in the future."
"OVERALL: This brew is definitely worth the hype. The nose had me expecting a bit of an overly strong bourbon stout, but the taste profile is extremely well balanced, going through several stages from start to finish. Great stuff. I had to force myself to slow down. Definitely worth standing in line to get some of this every year. Given how much I loved their regular Breakfast Stout, I guess it's no surprise that this one was right up my alley. Thanks again for hooking me up with this world class brew gents!"
"Overall, one of the most unique drinking experiences of my life. I love this beer and recommend it for anyone who is a fan of the style. I will save the other bottles for special occasions."
"I wish they sold these here. Deserved hype. But these small bottles are definitely enough for me..hiccup..."
"Can't really beat the mouthfeel factor on these big stouts, thick rich and luscious and chewy. I mean yeah the alcohol is hidden pretty well, and it drinks well but how many of these are you really planning on drinking in a sitting. I forgot how unique this beer is."
"Incredibly smooth and creamy. Oak tannins. A bit hot, especially as the beer warms. This beer is certainly world class to me. Plenty of drinkability; very complex, a pleasure to taste."
"a 5.0 was not given for drinkability because i could only drink a couple. if ""deliciousness"" were a category this beer would receive a 5.0 in that. as for any other numbers that might surprise people: i could sniff this guy all day (and sip it) but it's really not all that refined. if i am to evaluate this with the same criteria as I am to evaluate a belgian, KBS just lacks delicacy (though i will say that the bourbon barrel element is subtle)"
"D- This beer is amazing with coffee and light bourbon flacors coming out. Oh such heaven."
"Poured into a small sampling glass this brew is thick like chocolate milk with a dark chocolate color and a nice firm tan head settling into a solid cap. This brew has strong hints of chocolate, burnt caramel, and light vanilla. The taste is thick and oily with nice burnt malts and a slight chocolate finish. The taste lasts long after the last drop and ends dry. This gets more complex as it warms and was delicious. Must have on a Saturday for breakfast when not working."
"My first KBS! Bottled in February 2010. Pours an extremely dark black. Even when light is brightly shown behind it, it remains pitch black. Poured aggressively to get over an inch of a very tan, almost brown, thick, frothy head. The smell is very lovely with so much complexity. It seems so well-balanced just by the aroma. Some mixtures of bourbon whiskey, dark chocolates, light coffee, and sweet sugars. The taste is just as complex and smooth as I was hoping for. When fresh, this beer blows a fresh BCBS out of the water IMO. Not too boozy whatsoever. The bourbon flavors are present, but not the slightest bit overwhelming. Some amazing chocolate, coffee, and vanilla notes as well. Amazing taste. The beer's mouthfeel is just as I expected...maybe even a little lighter. It is thick and a bit syrupy/oily, but EXTREMELY drinkable. Outstanding beer!"
"This is a fantastic stout fully deserving of all the accolades it receives."
"Kentucky Breakfast Stout is very very brown almost black, with a very thin light brown film on top that lasts all the way. It smells of VANILLA , alcohol and espresso, With an emphasis on the vanilla. The aromatics are pretty powerful, so I was wondering if it was going to be over the top. But the body was really good. It was mellower than the nose would have suggested. KBS is very creamy and smooth going down. Definately a sipper, but one that can be enjoyed in the finest of moments. Every founders beer I tried so far was really good, but for some reason I prefer the original Breakfast Stout. That's not to say that I wont be trying this again in the future."
"d- the drinkability isn't great here just because of the strength, this is a huge beer and definately a sipper. definately glad i had the chance to try this, and pop a couple in my cellar to see if they will age well."
"D - A lot easier to drink than I expected. The bourbon flavor in this is noticeable but mingles well with the other flavors rather than dominating them for a pleasant taste. I wish I had bought more of this when I had the chance but the lesson was learned. Great beer. Worthy of its accolades."
"D - This is absolutely one of my top three beers. I've had quite a few of these, both from bottles and on tap. In my opinion KBS fully deserves the accolades it receives."
"What's this? A Bourbon barrel aged Stout that allows the barrel influence to do it's work without drowning out the base beer? What a concept! Founders never seems to disappoint and this is among their top offerings I've tried so far."
"D - The only reason this rating is so low is because you have to drink it at breakfast. You just have to. Any other time of day and it wouldn't be a breakfast stout. However, the kind of mornings for which you need a breakfast stout are limited so the drinkability is necessarily a bit low. Definitely not gonna give you the same buzz as a cup of coffee."
"Amazing, complex beer nonetheless. Epic, yes. But there are so many better ones out there."
"This is the ""best"" bourbon barrel aged stout I've had to date."
"Found this at a 10th anniversary celebration for a bar I frequent. Poured a very dark brown/black with light head and a strong vanilla/coffee aroma. Taste was intense, largely of vanilla, and bourbon. Definitely something you sip as opposed to full on drinking. If you can find it, definitely worth a taste."
"D: My first KBS, I'll let the rest mellow out a few years. A solid drink all around."
"Notes - I was actually expecting this beer to be over hyped and not as good as described...I was very happily proven wrong. I think this beer would be fantastic with dessert or as an aperitif, but my pairing preference would be tiramisu."
"D- I love it! The 11.2% is well hidden, but not so much that you forget that you are drinking a monster stout - the king of imperial stouts. This beer is awesome....there is no doubt it stands up to the hype! I only wish it were more readily available."
"I'm a very big fan of Founder's and KBS is no exception. It is a great beer, however, given its high price and limited availability you can do better. Old Raspy, Peche Mortel, Yeti, and Founder's Imperial Stout are all more readily available, easier on the wallet, and arguably as good or better than KBS. Don't get me wrong, I rate this beer highly and I'll continue to pick up some of this every year. I just feel that this is one of those beers in which rarity plays a big role in its lofty reputation."
"Well balanced and smooth. Goes down pretty darn easy to say the least."
"D: This is not a session beer by any means, but for what it is it's hard to imagine it being any more drinkable. Highly recommended."
"One of the few beers where I truly feel you get a new taste with each sip you take. Even while pouring this great-looking black beer, I picked up coffee and vanilla hints. As I took my first sip, those flavors were in the forefront. The next few sips brought out more of a coffee flavor, followed by more of a bourbon hint. This truly is a great beer. I just wish it was a tad easier to come by."
"Still very drinkable, even at the higher ABV."
"Sip and enjoy this one at an appropriatte slow pace. This one requires some time to earn the full respect and complexity it deserves. Ok... I now think I need another one to fully do it justice."
"Highly sipable, one to enjoy slowly."
"Drinkability: Delicious, but intense. I think I might be able to have two of these, but beyond that I think it might get to be a little much."
"This is strong, but in no way off-putting. 1 is everlasting in a night, despite it's desirability."
"drinkability - very big and complex beer, alcohol is intense, flavor is intense, incredibly enjoyable"
"D - I could live off this. I fell in love on first sip, easily one of my favorites of all time. Just an amazing beer, and one that holds a special place for me as my big gateway into the world of craft beer."
"Drinkability: it packs more of a punch than I would have though, but it was good."
"Poured into a delirium noel snifter from a 12oz bottle. Color is jet black with an initial one finger light brown sugar colored head whose consistency reminds me of the foam present on hot cocoa. Smell is bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, and malted milkshake upfront with undertones of coffee. Taste has coffee burnt sugar and unsweetened chocolate present with toasty malt in the background and the finish is a bit too bitter for me for a stout like this. Mouthfeel is pretty light for a beer that markets itself as this big, although drinkability does take a hit due do the bitterness and the alcohol presence."
"Drinkability-One bottle of this is fine for me in a single night of drinking."
"D: Somehow, with all that is going on with this beer, it manages to stay highly drinkable and not too filling. Use discretion at 11% ABV, but this tastes so good, you might as well have another because you aren't going anywhere. Kudos. Best Imperial Stout I have had."
"D: Alcohol is masked making this surprisingly drinkable; great beer"
"The best imperial stout I've ever had. Too strong to drink a lot, but I would do it anyway."
"wow. What's there not to like abaout this beer. So many in this style all taaste a like. Definitely different than the rest. While a strong coffee aroma, the taste was not as strong in that area. Sooo nice and smooth with a good bit of chocolate. The high alcohol content does not present itself. Many other in this style leave me with a headache even after just one, but not this one. Is really at the top of my list now."
"I would most definitely drink this again - morning, noon, or night."
"Screw it, let's go bowling."
"D- its 11.2 abv and a beast in the flavor department but even with all that taken into account its an amazing brew that is worth all the hype."
"Ladies and gentlemen I am happy to report, much to my enjoyment, that KBS lives up to and firmly lays the smack down on the hype. This beer is for real."
"Excellent sipper and on fantastic beer overall. You can't have more than one in a sitting but it's one you'll definitely go back to"
"I had huge expectations for this beer but not really my thing when it comes to drinkability. glad I tried it for novelty sake but not something I would have on a regular basis. trying not to ding the rating too high but I am not a huge fan of the breakfast stout"
"Personally, I love the hot taste that these have and age would mellow them too much for me."
"D- VERY strong flavors, but DAMN are they good. You have to be careful with the burn near the end...but christ, this is amazingly good"
"At around $5 for a 12oz. stout of this caliber, its a pretty good deal. I think I like it more than Abyss, but then again, Abyss was so easy to get out here, whereas this, I have to go back to my Milwaukee homies to hook this up. We'll see how future tastings (got 2 more to go) work out. As far as my first, excellent, and could easily be the world champion stout. Of course, I still have some Speedway, Hunahpu among others aging right now, so who knows, but I can say with conviction, this is the best barrel aged stout I've ever had."
"This is a must try offering from the folks at Founders."
"KBS pours a melted dark chocolatey oil into the glass with literally not a single speck of foam or carbonation. It smells like a wicked combination of chocolate, rich coffee, and bourbon barrels. You can smell the bourbon from a couple feet away. It tastes absolutely delicious. My friend next to met said it ""absolutely perfect"". It's the perfect mix of rich chocolate, freshly brewed coffee, and alcohol. It can be a little sweet though. It's how you would want your coffee to taste in the morning. It's extremely smooth and milky. It again is just perfect. It's so drinkability due it being amazing in all of the above categories. Of course, the 11.2% abv is the only thing that could slow you down from these, or the cost of near $6 a bottle. Regardless, it's a great drink and one of the best beers around."
"D: Easy does it with this one, slow and steady. This beer offers so many levels of flavor each and every sip that it needs to be enjoyed slowly. Appreciate its complexities with a good book or just as a great night cap! I am also tempted to try one of these in the morning instead of my morning cup... Great beer all around."
"Thanks to jammapamma for the 4 pack - 3 more left!"
"SkÅL!"
"Again thanks to Hoppymcgee for the trade, i hope you like whats coming!"
"Simply an amazing stout. The bourbon character makes this beer so unique. It warms my insides as does good whiskey and scotch. A+ without a doubt."
"D: a premium breakfast stout, very delicious, would definitely try again!"
"Glad to split it, a full bottle would be a pretty intense experience."
"D - A truly amazing beer. Lived up to the hype."
"Pours jet black with a nice dark tan to brownish colored head. In the aroma, bourbon, oak, and just a hint of vanilla. In the taste, coffee, oak, and big alcohol presence of bourbon. A small alcohol bite and big bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry, lingering bourbon flavored aftertaste. Quite a big beer, a good sipper, huge bourbon flavor, small hints of coffee and vanilla, but over taken by the bourbon."
"Really an incredible stout, deserves its reputation."
"D-amazing i cannot say enough good things about this beer it definately lives up to its hype"
"modern masterpiece. Quintessential example of what American ingenuity can do vis-a-vis beer. Worth driving to other states to experience."
"Aromas of dark chocolate and bourbon, this drinks incredibly well. Great mouthfeel, smooth and creamy with a crisp bourbon undertone. Can't wait to revisit this one in the wintertime. A must try for stout lovers."
"If you see this on draft, do not pass it up. It is certainly interesting to see the differences between the bottled version and the version on draft. Simply a phenomenal beer and still remains one of my favorite barrel aged beers."
"Drinkability: This sipper rarely comes around these parts on tap. A stronger version of the bottled counterpart, this beer is simply phenominal."
"Well there is no real intro for this beer, it is what it is. It is KBS. Poured dark, and smelled lovely. The Beer attacked the palate like a planned out bank robbery, actually no more like the robbery from the Oceans movies. Matt Damon, I mean the Bourbon, was really well balanced in this, not over powering all the other players. There were hints of coffee that left a nice roasty quality, and then the vanilla. Most Bourbon Barrel Beers have an off flavor of vanilla, Founders was on point with the amount of vanilla in this beer. It was just enough to get you coming back for more. Great Beer!"
"D - like it a bit more from the tap, but still one of the best beers out there. wonderfully robust and intense, yet complex. one of those beers that doesnt need a special occasion, as every time you have one is special enough."
"Poured from a bottle and boy did the aromas explode without hesitation as I filled my glass. Dark as night with a one finger head which slowly dissipated. Nice deep cream color to the head and a bit of lacing left with every sip. Smells of rich espresso, dark chocolate, hints of bourbon, and other complexities. Tastes like it smells, only better. Lots of chocolates, coffee, and just enough bourbon to complement and hide the ABV yet it does not overpower, which I liked. A tinge of alcohol taste as it finishes but the 11.2% ABV is definitely masked well. Full mouthfeel and super rich. One or two of these on special occasions every once in a while sounds just about right. It lives up to the hype!"
"D: A great American stout with huge, varied aroma and flavor profiles and superb mouthfeel and drinkability. Deserves its high regard."
"Drinkability -- The bourbon character is very sharp, so much that it burnt my sinuses. Mind you, I enjoy barrel-aged stouts, and Founders Breakfast Stout - what is essentially the base beer - is a favorite of mine. However, I just couldn't fall in love with this one like everyone else. A noble brew to be certain, but I may stick to my tried and trues in the future."
"After keeping an eye out for many months, I was finally able to land a bottle while eating dinner at Hawthornes in Philadelphia. It didn't feel right drinking this straight out of the bottle, so I ended up pouring it into the jar that was supposed to be my water glass. It was jet black without very much head. The aroma is a very nice blend of coffee, roasted malts, and a little hint of the oak. The taste was an intense blend of the coffee and roasted malts. The mouthfeel was rather light considering how heavy of a beer this is, which would made it very easy to drink a few of these. Anyone who likes coffee flavor in their beer would absolutely love this."
"Very delicious imperial stout. Pours a dark black color with a caramel colored head. Has an aroma of bourbon with hints of coffee, vanilla, and malt. The alcohol comes through on the smell and taste. This stout has it all sweet and malty on the front, bitter and biting alcohol on the back. Thin mouthfeel. Notes of vanilla and coffee which linger on the tongue through the finish. This is most definitely a snifter worthy stout."
"Taste is just straight up comforting. I'm all about whiskeys and the bourbon variety is no exception. Chocolate and coffee come up first with some of the classic oak-imparted flavor. Bourbon comes heavy in the finish providing a sweet and boozy sensation. There is no mistaking the alcohol in this one but it works for the benefit of this beer, I think the warmth adds to the experience of this. Its carbonated nicely, it wouldn't hurt to be thicker but I dig the balance of KBS. Founders rarely misses the mark with their beers."
"D - What to think... Really an amazing brew that I guarantee at least an A in this reviewers opinion. Strong flavor and high ABV with expected high price tag. May have it again if I hit up the brewery."
"D. Excellent. I might have to pop another one of these when my bourbon drinking buddy gets back to town after my exam. That said, I might have to drop $25 on another 4 pack of these at my local beer store in celebration."
"Hardly a chugger, although the smooth body and delicious flavors are constantly pulling you back for more."
"The initial smell was a delicious blend of coffee, chocolate malt, and bourbon. I also really enjoyed the first taste. But overall, I'm not a big fan of this beer due to its overwhelming Bourbon flavor. I'm sure it's great if you like bourbon, but I really don't. It's a well made beer, but the bourbon flavor is too much for me. The appearance was a beautiful deep tarnished black, however. The mouthfeel was intensely thick. I could never drink more than one of these, and at the price, I probably won't be drinking it again."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer. The coffee and bourbon play really well together. The only suggestions for improvement I could give are in the way of mouthfeel. This beer was lacking in body to me, but the aromatics and taste more than make up for the slight shortfall. This beer will definitely hold up to age. Excellent beer."
"D - I consider the KBS experience the top of the pack, the pinnacle if you will, I had three of these and as strong as it is it still seems balanced and not at all like an 11% stout. The barrel is used deftly as an ingredient and adds to the delicious tastes of the stout, coffee and vanilla without intrusion, the flavors are all melded together expertly and I think the draft is ever so slightly more drinkable than the bottle."
"D: very glad i went to find another 4-pack, very drinkable."
"overall i'd expect a richer bourbon flavor. in comparison to BCS it has less bourbon hotness, more coffee. shoulda picked up some BC coffee stout when i was in chicago./"
"KBS is a sure-fire top ten beer with a ton of complex nature flavor and a great mouthfeel. It serves perfectly as a dessert, a meal, or a late save-the-day experience. Have I mentioned it's remarkable?"
"One of the best beers ever. I've been on a roll lately when it comes to stouts, and I don't want it to end. Along with Dieu du Ciel, Founders is making the absolute best stouts [and beers, period] in the world."
"Thanks to Mike Bell and the guys at Founders for creating such pleasure."
"D - it is a bit too strong for more than one, but you do want that one..."
"D-this is extremely tasty! great flavors and fantastic job on the barrel aging. top notch beer!"
"I stumbled on this by losing a bet...and now I cannot get enough of this. I don't know what it is ... the bourbon taste? the smoothness of the entire pour? It is something spacial! Definitely one of my favorites and I would recommend this to anyone who wants a different tasting stout."
"MF/D: Super (I emphasize super) viscous body- one of the biggest I've tasted. Alcohol is very well hidden, and the bourbon is not boozy at all, rather complementary. Low carbonation. This is the closest-to-a-5 beer I've reviewed."
"My label is different than the one pictured and says KBS instead of Kentucky Breakfast Stout."
"A very impressive stout, worth seeking out if you love bourbon and black coffee."
"Drinkability: a sipper, however, were it readily available in keg form, I'd probably drink it non stop - I could probably hit this beer like the glaze curtain at Krispy Kreme. Beautifully crafted. A great standard in the bourbon barrel aged imperial stout category."
"Tastes like a ton of smoke, like I am licking the inside of a fresh barrel. Bourbon is there too. Has a fresh oaky/coffee twang to it. Creamy mouthfeel, not super thick, just creamy. Some chocolate and reoasted malt flavors. This beer has a lot going on. To age or not to age that is the question. Good stuff, wish it were readily available."
"Found singles for sale in central MA a couple months back, and decided to drink one tonight. Poured into a DFH oversized snifter. The color of this beer is black as tar. I have not seen a beer recently that was this dark. Thick, caramel colored head forms at the very end of the pour. Nice lacing on the glass. Smell is intense. Lots of vanilla and aromatic coffee notes, with a hint of smokiness. The smell is boozy and sweet, but the flavor is dry and balanced. There is a definite bourbon flavor, but that is matched equally with a coffee liqueur counterpoint. An amazing amount of flavors that don't overwhelm each other, but all are in harmony. Mouthfeel was probably one of the ""chewiest"" beers I can recall. At first, it reminded me of syrup or pudding. But it mellowed out to be more stout like. I actually preferred this beer cold right out of the bottle. It seemed to lose some of the mouthfeel and flavor as it warmed up. Call that odd, but it seemed to be the opposite most times as true for me this time. Took a while to drink this beer, due to the viscosity, the abv and overall size of this beer. One serving was enough for me, but that one bottle was quite a journey. A great brew."
"Note: It lived up to the hype for me. It is much more enjoyable than the regular version of Goose Island Bourbon Stout for the fact that the bourbon flavors were not as astringent as GI"
"Overall, I'm not unimpressed. The only thing that seems odd is how the flavor profile changes so dramatically from the start of each sip to the finish - it comes across as two beers in one. KBS is the mullet of beer: kempt & presentable in front; unruly & rowdy in back. It doesn't matter how well it can blend refined & extreme; at the end of the day KBS is still ""that guy."""
"Lots of bourbon, oak, vanilla, graham cracker, and chocolate with a little coffee. Really, a dessert in a glass. Very tasty"
"One of the very, very few that has lived up to the advance billing for me. So creamy soft, so smooth and slick on the tongue, enough carb to interest my palate but otherwise get out of the way. I sip it slowly but savor each taste. Spectacular beer, and borderline personal Top 10."
"Served in a flute glass at Lord Hobo. KBS pours an absolute, all encompassing black. There's an impressive creamy milk chocolate cap, 2-3 fingers, that just refuses to go anywhere. Almost 10 minutes later I still have a solid 1.5-2 fingers of foam on top. There's a beyond ridiculous amount of gorgeous lacing left behind as I (all too quickly) empty my glass, especially for a beer of this size. The nose is great, a hearty mix of bourbon and coffee, heavier on the latter. I'm a little let down though because I don't find any vanilla or anything else in the nose, I was hoping for a little more complexity. That complexity I was looking for? Well, I found it even in my first few sips. There's an opening blast of coffee, supplemented by rick dark chocolate, before the beer transitions to a wonderful vanilla sweetness mid palate. The bourbon comes on strong (but not too strong) to close things out. KBS goes down absurdly smoothly, with a fine amount of carbonation. For a beer this big and flavorful, I found the body to be just a little bit thin (but this is a minor quibble in the grand scheme of things). While there's definitely a bourbon kick to this beer, there's no hint of any alcoholic heat, which for a barrel aged stout clocking in at over 11% ABV is absurd. I'm firmly convinced Founders sold their soul to the devil to be able to craft such an exquisite beer."
"As much as I didn't want this bottle to end, I couldn't help but drink it on the fast side for an 11% barrel-aged stout. This was one of the best beers I've had in months, and it definitely lived up to the hype!"
"Overall, a very good and solid brew that I enjoyed a lot. Did I enjoy it $6 a bottles worth? I'm not sure. With Old Rasputin and Old Stock Ale, both from North Coast, available for $9 a 4-pack, KBS wouldn't be a regular purchase for me, but I'd have a couple a year. Certainly a worthy beer."
"I was only able to grab one of these during the extravaganza in Chicago, and it's killing me that I'll likely have to wait another year for more. I want this in my tummy at all times. I've found my unicorn."
"d - I loved KBS. I'm a huge fan of bourbon stouts and this might be the best one I've ever had. I thought the coffee, vanilla, and bourbon in the taste was perfected balanced and that the mouthfeel was perfect for a stout. It's a touch hot, but I still really enjoyed it. Would love to get more of this one."
"This is a fantastic beer! Well worth all the hype. I need to find a bottle to compare, but hard to imagine it getting much better!"
"Overall, drinking KBS is as pleasurable and comforting as sitting in front of a dying fire in a wood-paneled library of a mountain cabin after a fresh snowfall as you drink fine whiskey and slowly drift off to sleep."
"This is wickedly drinkable. Nice depth of flavors and incredibly easy drinking."
"What an enjoyable half hour."
"couldnt be thicker in the mouth. sticky and lipsmacking."
"Overall I much preferred the 2008 to the 2010. The alcohol has mellowed nicely and the bourbon and coffee have a nice balance."
"O- This is an amazing stout. Its just missing a bit of carbonation and a few notes in the taste to be called perfect."
"D-Really, reallly, really easy drinking for the ABV (did I emphasis really enough?). KBS goes down way too easy. Based on Breakfast Stout (being the base beer) and Backwoods Bastard (another barrel aged beer from Founders) I was really expecting not to like this one as much as I do."
"Very impressed with this beer. I am a big fan of stouts and especially bourbon barrel aged stouts. This did not disappoint."
"Pours an opaque jet-black color with no appreciable head. Thin rimming of bubbles form a tan foam that pools on the surface in paisley islands. Enticing aromas of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, malted milk, and bourbon. Smooth and silky mouthfeel. Light-bodied with understated, yet active carbonation. Taste mirrors the nose with precision. Opens with broad strokes of coffee, chocolate and malted milk before moving into earthy undertones of vanilla and bourbon. Alcohol is well buried for the extreme ABV. Finishes with a tang of black licorice. One complex, smooth and satisfying sipper."
"This one may need some time to age to let the alchol mellow out and let the other charecters peak. Look forward to trying another bottle in a year or so. As is, decent offering."
"-fantastic beer. KBS surely brings it."
"D: Amazingly good, I could get myself into some trouble with this beer."
"D: This is my first time having KBS and this is great stuff. Going back to the regular Breakfast Stout after this is gonna be tough. Incredible beer. I will savor every one I that have."
"I have previously used the term kitten puncher to describe big, dark, almost evil stouts. This beer is all that but so, so decadent. It's a sexy kittenpuncher."
"This beer had a lot of hype but I was not disappointed. When I'm not a poor college student I will have this again for sure."
"This is one of the finest stouts on the planet. The local good beer bar had one keg of this and decided to have a founder's party and have nothing but founder's beers on tap. KBS was the prize of the night. It goes down very smooth with a very strong coffee overtone with a vanilla and bourbon after taste. The alcohol is hidden very well. It took me at least four glasses to even tell how strong this was. Overall fantastic. Best BBS stout to date."
"Without a doubt, KBS has to be one of the finest stouts I've had to date. I understand there's alot of hype with this beer and sometimes I'm a little skeptical because of it. However, this is an exceptional beer and lives up to its reputation. I understand Founders added a few more tanks to the brewery so I hope this means KBS will at the very minimum be put in the brewing rotation twice a year instead of once. I'm packing two bottles away in the cellar to see how it progresses over time. This was a memorable tasting."
"Drinkability - A massive sipper for sure. I am enjoying this with some Trader Joe mini chocolate peanut butter cups. They go amazing with this. I am extremely grateful to have this, being able to try the normal Founders Breakfast Stout earlier this year. Very enjoyable on this slightly chilly Southern California night. Thanks again to erikkoppin who is an amazing and generous trader."
"'10. Pours a nice dark brown/black with a quarter inch head, typical for Founders stuff. Nose is a lot of espresso, some minor notes of bourbon and vanilla. Taste is more of the same. Not sure how people describe this as a bourbon bomb, in fact it is quite the opposite. This is a coffee stout to me. It's all espresso on the tongue. Must say it's a bit disappointing. Mouthfeel is a tad fizzy. Definitely not a top 20 beer."
"Big fan of Founders Brewing overall. Cheers to them for creating this awesome brew."
"I will age the hell out of my last bottle and hope that it may change my opinion but as of right now there are a handful of coffee stouts/porters that I would say are better then KBS and even more of the barrel aged variety"
"Anyway you cut it, I do not believe this to be a drinkable beer. Even though the alcohol is apparent in a pleasant way, it limits consumption. Boozy is a very appropriate word. The belly feels fire, one can get their whiskey fix, and enjoy a well crafted beer for likely no more than 12 ounces."
"Overall, this is a top-notch stout. Right now, it's too boozy to enjoy all of the complexities of the bouquet and flavor, but I can't wait to crack them open in 3 to 6-month intervals over the next couple of years. I've had too many good KBS experiences over the past couple of years to mark this down in any one category, but aging will improve the current batch, without a doubt."
"This is an awesome, although quite boozy beer. Good for a nightcap, but more than that will cause trouble. It is an exemplar for a craft brewed stout. Every swallow is a delight."
"i live KBS but this needs to age to REALLY enjoy what it is capable of doing. i enjoyed 1 pint but 2? probably not. it is way too hot."
"overall - so glad I got to try the '07. Booze is almost undetectable. very mellow."
"D - OK, I am sure this is where my rDev is going to dip, but I think that anybody who rates the drinkability of an 11+% beer in the 4+ range is out of their mind. This is a very strong beer and after just one, I was feeling every point of that ABV. It is also rich like cheesecake and I couldn't just sit around eating piece after piece of cheesecake. It took me close to an hour to drink a 12 ounce bottle. Enjoyable - yes, drinkable - 3."
"D: This is truly one of the best stouts I've ever had. Definitely a slow sipper right now though. The bourbon is a little overpowering currently, but damn I can imagine this being fantastic in 6-12 months. Glad I have another bottle stored away"
"D: The recipe change threw me off a bit last year, but the 2010 vintage is amazing. I enjoy this more than Peruvian Morning (another bourbon coffee stout), and more than some other competitors in the style. Really top-notch stuff, and it amazes me that it's so plentiful and relatively cheap. I should get a case of this or something."
"Overall, an amazing beer. So complex and wonderful. I'm guessing this beer with change a lot over time and I'm looking forward to it."
"It's hard for me to say if I like this beer fresher, with the coffee and vanilla popping, or if I like it more with some age and all of that bourbon and wood showing itself a little stronger. Makes me wish that I had tried a glass of the 2009 next to it. Always the tough decisions to make on these ridiculous pre-DLD trips to Founders in the wake of the Black Party the weekend before..."
"Overall I thought this was still a phenomenal beer after a few years on it but I was a bigger fan when it was fresh. The bourbon flavors are much bigger although it is boozier when fresh. In any even, it's worth a shot fresh or aged."
"D: As I said earlier, this batch is a little hot (maybe a funny bottle, I had it around Easter and remember it being pretty well balanced as always). But overall pretty mellow for a beer at 11%. If this was more accessible and readily available throughout the year, I would drink it all the time. Have no problem consuming a whole bottle. One of Founder's best and always worth seeking out."
"D: This is a fine sipping brew with a complex flavor and a high ABV. Sit back and enjoy."
"I was honestly surprised at how light the mouthfeel was for such a big beer. Very easy drinking for a bourbon barrel ages 11% stout. I'm gonna keep this on my want list."
"This is deep black with a reddish brown head that disappears into bubbles. Coffee is the first note that hits the nose followed by milk chocolate, light maple syrup, bourbon, and a bit of oak. I almost don't want to drink it because it smells so good. Almost. The bourbon is not shy in this. Comes out right away in the taste, but smooths out into oak-hinted toffee, creamy chocolate, and roasted coffee which lingers and bitters a bit with a mild whiskey burn at the end. A little chewy with a sweet malt feel and a little carbonation, but velvety and well-blended--a great libation. The label disclaims any remedies, but this is a cure for all that ails."
"Overall I found this beer to be very drinkable and quite tastey. This beer can defiantely creep up on you and I look forward to purchasing this each year when it first comes out. Well worth the hype"
"Big thanks to Eric for the bottle!"
"Poured from 12oz bottle into snifter. Pours black like oil with a thin brown head. It smells of coffee, chocolate, slight toasted malt slight booze. The taste follows with vanilla and bourbon. So delish! Let this warm a bit. This ale is full bodied- almost syrupy but in a fantastic way. I would love to drink 4 of these but the ABVs remind me to consume slow. This will only get better with age. My second favorite beer of all time."
"Very boozy. Wonderful bourbon aroma. Black as night. Thin head. Not like Founders Breakfast Stout (one of my favorites). This is a Fabulous beer! Better than Bourbon County Stout from Goose Island. I am going to lay this one down in the cellar to see what it does..."
"D: Very drinkable, very tasty. Comes pretty close to living up to the hype."
"d- it's a very rich beer even for a RIS. rich and delicious though. I'd never let a drop be wasted. I'd drink it until I passed out and is well worth the $20/4pk"
"D- Easy drinking if you like chocolate milk, loads of flavors, creamy, smooth, dry finish. Never noticed 11.2% alcohol."
"Overall, a decadent beer that is unmatched. Cheers Founders!"
"2010 vintage. Poured a deep, dark, opaque black, impervious to the light. A surprisingly decent amount of chocolately brown head formed initially, but receded to the edges fairly quickly. A big nose on this one, with loads of freshly brewed coffee, along with bourbon and dark chocolate. The bourbon presence is dominant on the palate as well, along with vanilla, oak, roasted malt and chocolate covered espresso beans. The alcohol is very well hidden in this one, making it dangerously drinkable. After being unimpressed with this one last year, I am extremely glad I got a couple more this year. A truly outstanding beer."
"Summary: Founders does an awesome stout and the KBS is one that you have to try to believe!"
"I did like this beer a lot. The smell was a signal of the taste with a strong coffee, vanilla, chocolate and sweetness like from molasses. Had not enjoyed a bourbon barrel breakfast stout before, became a fan. A little bit of alcohol in the mouth and not quite as smooth as the tap version of course. Overall a beer I would definitely drink again as an after dinner drink. Wish I could try it on nitro like some of the other posters."
"This years release will not disappoint if you havent had it yet & are wondering the quality of the batch. In fact, it may just be better than last years. Simply a delight to drink & enjoy, I didnt want it to end."
"Bottle pours a dark dark black with a decent amount of caramal foam forming in the Duvel tulip glass. Smells of dark chocolate and roasted coffee. This taste follows suit with some bourbon and oak lingering in there too. Its very smooth overall and a very solid stout. Its easy to drink for the 11.2%, but it does catch up to you after a couple. Still prefer the Canadian Breakfast Stout over this, but its still pretty good."
"D: Kentucky Breakfast Stout is way to drinkable for an 11.2% brew. Dangerous as it may be, it's well worth the risk. I prefer the Canadian Breakfast Stout over KBS, but not by much. This is an excellent brew from start to finish."
"Pours a jet black with no head. Nice lacing with cocoa colored rings forming as you drink. Smell is very sweet with strong coffee and chocalate smells. This thing tastes insane! Totally blows you away with intense chocolate and to a lesser extent coffee. The Bourbon adds the perfect burn and sweetness to this beer. It's so smooth and effortless to drink. This is a top rated beer for a damn good reason! What an experience."
"Very drinkable. One of my favorites."
"With the high abv and full body, you'd think this would be a sipper...but this beer went much to quickly for me. Overall the alcohol is hidden pretty well. Lots of complex flavors are really well balanced. This is a real winner."
"D-Overall this is a world class stout. It's definitely deservng of its accolades and it's complex and enjoyable."
"Ive never had anything but fresh KBS. Each time I have this I wonder how older vintages are drinking - probably alot smoother. I have 3 bottles left... and I only have to wait a couple years."
"Drinkability: Its a sipper for sure, but is surprisingly drinkable given the high ABV. The alcohol is well disguised in my opinion and isn't super boozy like the Goose Island BCS. I like this beer more than the BCS. I will age a few bottles and see how they taste later."
"M/D - Slick, oily mouthfeel that covers the entire mouth and never fully washes away. I love Breakfast Stout, but KBS takes it to another level!"
"First off, not a fan of the double imperial stouts so don't listen to me, but the hype surrounding this opened my eyes. On that note, putting this in perspective with it's peers, this is pretty solid. Big dark pour, bourbon smell carries throughout, finish was big booze, with booze on top. I liked this, not so much drinkable, but one of the best imperial stouts i've ever had, complex and huge in every sip."
"D - Like a normal KBS the bourbon is rather large but still fairly drinkable due to the nitro introduction. I'm really happy that I'm sharing this one. 6 oz poured into a snifter would plenty to nurse though a cool evening."
"Drinkability - An excellent brew, and quite drinkable considering the 11.2% hidden within. That being said, one is probably sufficient."
"A buddy of mine picked this up for me, I've never ben able to find it. Pours like 10w40, it is just BLACK, smell is alcohol at first, it's overpowering almost, it smells like whiskey hence the aging. Taste is very whiskey heavy, it doesn't really taste like a normal stout, but that is what makes it so special. Mouthfeel is very thick, one of the thickest beers I've ever had."
"09 (08?, the one that was released in Spring 09) vintage at Stoutfest. Same basic review as my bottle on with some improvements. The aggression is gone. Pitch black with dark tan head and cloud. Good lacing for aged beer. Taste and smell of cocoa, bourbon, vanilla, roast malts, big coffee, alcohol. Balance is amazing with an extra year of age. Smell is of great strength. Cocoa, coffee and barrel whiskey rules in balance. No more overaggressive alcohol, oak and bourbon. This beer needs age! MF is thick, warm, and low carbonation, very good. Drinkable besides the price, so amazing with age."
"I poured this Highly Acclaimed Founders KBS hard, and got an initial inch of dense tight bubble foam. Tan colored head with a liquid shade of dark black; opaque. Initial smell is fantastic. Dark roasted chocolate, coffee, and bourbon. The odor is incredibly rich and highly enjoyable. Large whafts are like breathing liquid chocolate. Taste is no let down from what my nose revealed. Liquid chocolate, bourbon silk. Slight sweetness that is the perfect complementary touch. Slight notes of smooth coffee and only a pleasnat lingering aftertaste. An eighty ounce glass would be just fine. This highly acclaimed beer booze is too good. An infinite supply of this brew would be great beer wish. Mouthfeel is a perfect medium dense, tight bubble, low to moderate carbonation. Sticky sweet residue lingers on the gums and only encourages further drinking."
"D - Dangerously easy drinker but a bit too filling for me."
"This is better than FBS, if the bourbon wasn't so loud. I wish there was a way to make bourbon barrel flavors complement better rather than dominate."
"I can't say the same anymore. On tap and in bottle, the mouthfeel seems to have thinned. The aroma is still great, but not as powerful as before and the taste just doesn't seem to be there. Overall, it seems like a much less hearty beer than before. With all of that aside this is still a great beer but I cannot judge it as a A+ (world class) beer anymore. I now would rate it a B+."
"I enjoyed this more than the KBS I had on tap at EBF 2010. I'm not really sure what the difference was, but this one had much more bourbon character and heat than the several draft tastings I had at EBF."
"D: I seek this beer out every year when it comes out, mainly based on it's reputation and scarcity in the market. It's very different and very good, but also very pricey, and I think just a bit overrated -- the bourbon and coffee flavors mixed together just don't do it for me -- I'd much prefer a Goose Island Bourbon stout. I'm not saying it's a bad beer, or I don't like it, just that when I rate it objectively it's not on on my list of top 10 beers in the world."
"D: A very good beer. A sipper for sure, but also a pleasure to drink."
"Pours a very dark brown...lets just call it black. Above it sits a finger of rich, dark tan head. There's a nuttiness to the smell along with vanilla, bourbon, and coffee. The taste is quite good, as expected. You certainly are aware of the alcohol, but it is very smooth. There's vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and bourbon. I also got a maple syrup note. Creamy, sticky feel was a plus. I really like high viscosity beers. I found this quite drinkable, yet my wallet says otherwise."
"Overall very drinkable, really is one of the best beers I've had so far."
"Big thanks to BEERchitect for hooking up such a generous trade."
"M/D: Thick and chewy with lower carbonation. The finish is a bit dry due to the high ABV. More of a special occasion beer and a definite sipper. But wanted to keep going back for more."
"Edit: 3.16.11...This beer is definitely better fresh. I just did a vertical with this years, and last years. The fresh KBS is much smoother, and has better balance than the year old bottle."
"D: Highly drinkable just because it tastes so damn good and is so enjoyable. I used to dream that the best tasting stout would be like sweet liquid chocolate, but I was wrong. Founders upped the alcohol taste, but instead of masking it, they used it to their advantage and balanced it perfectly with the best ingredients."
"Notes- Must allow this beer to warm up if you want to get the full taste of the beer. This is a waste if you try to drink it quickly or too cold."
"D: A true score. Any time you can find it...buy it."
"Cheers!"
"D: This is a beer to sip to appreciate all of the flavors come through as it warms up."
"D - after a few of this id be drunk."
"I will buy again... for breakfast tomorrow. Imagine this beer with bacon and waffles... Has anybody made bacon beer yet???"
"Drinkability: Its got a slight dryness on the backend that makes this a slow sipper. Worth the 25$ 4PACK sticker price but it will be great with age."
"Overall, this one is a drinker's drink. The characteristics of a top shelf stout blended with the aging in bourbon barrels has created something to be sipped, savoured, and sought after. Also , reminds me of an Irish Car Bomb (Guinness, Jameson, and Bailey's)."
"D - Great stuff. Seems like a perfect beer for winding down at night. Malty, rich, smooth, and strong enough to make you sleepy."
"O: An excellent offering from Founders. It has some obvious differences over their standard breakfast stout. It's a nice change of pace but I'm glad to have the traditional breakfast stout around all year with this to bring a nice surprise once a year. I actually prefer the Canadian Breakfast Stout which I was lucky enough to try last year. The drinkability is low but honestly, who wants to drink this all night? It's decadent and a perfect one-off."
"I've been wanting to try this one for a while. Pleased as punch it made it to MN."
"D- Excellent! The 11.2% ABV doesn't show at all. I could drink this until it crept up on me and kicked my ass."
"I literally dumped this beer in to my Kasteel glass knowing it wouldn't foam over. Color is a nice deep black with a golden tint around the edges of the glass. This beer has to be served slightly cool to be truly appreciated, when served under 65 degrees its nose and palate become muddled and not as pleasant. I poured this beer at about 45 degrees, I let it decant and warm up to about 65 degrees to room temperature. Wow! opened up and warm this beer shows how amazing it truly is. The nose includes nuances of vanilla, cinnamon, caramel, bourbon, oak, sweet oatmeal, cappuccino and chocolate. All of these characteristics follow on the palate, absolutely delicious with a lingering aftertaste that please. The mouthfeel is full bodied but not chewy or oily. Great beer I can't wait to get some more."
"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3orLEUx2k5E"
"M/D: I could actually drink this all day. Considering the high ABV (11.2 thanks Jake for the quick response) its amazing. This is what they serve in heaven, because CBS is even hard to get there, maybe someday..."
"I first sampled this last year when I first picked it up and it was much 'hotter'. It has definitely dissipated quite a bit but is still a little on the hot side. With that said, this is a very well-done, big stout. I still have another '09 to have, along with a couple of '10's. Another gem from Founders!!!!"
"A truly exceptional beer. I'd buy a case if it were distributed out here."
"Wow!!! World Class from the first sip. Not overrated at all. Poured deep dark black and has a nice full body with loads of coffee flavor and some good barrell aged oak flavor."
"Decent head, great aromas. Tons of tastes going on, very complex. First hits with the chocolate, then the coffee, with hints of vanilla and oak. Then the bourbon hits, which I didn't enjoy so much. Was a bit too boozy tasting for me. Overall good, but a bit of a disappointment."
"Thank you."
"I think I'll stick to Breakfast stouts and Bourbon barrel stouts seperatly. More for all of you :)"
"Its not hot, moderate in body, finishes nicely. Sweet up front, not a lot of bitterness in the back, highly drinkable in the palate. Second taste, chocolate, slight, hint of bitter this time in the back, like coffee. Overall an exceptional beer truly."
"D_Definite sipper but more than one isnt out of the question."
"12 ounce bottle, etched on the bottle, ""Bottled 2/08/10"" Pours black, plain and simple, the head is dark mocha, on the loose side, stays around for a good while, leaves scattered fine bits and some blobs of lace. Bold nose with waves of chocolate, dark coffee, vanilla, and some wood. Rich and thick, a double expresso, mocha, chocolate shake comes to mind....with 11% alcohol tossed in to boot! Simply yummy stuff...dark, flavorful, complex, smooth, cheewy, heady stuff. Hope I can get some more of this stuff soon...Stout lovers rejoice and go get some."
"Finally got to try some KBS. I think I will like it more with a little age on it to take the edge off the boozy flavors. Maybe the underlying stout would make more of an appearance with some age. Quite tasty!"
"D - Good overall. I was hoping for more malt complexity and aroma/flavor hops. Nice that there were no traces of alcohol."
"M/D - Very tasty imperial stout, smooth tasting, very easy to have more than a couple but then I wouldn't remember much and have a massive hard alcohol hang over!! I did only have the one and have one more to try with some more time on it. A see why it came and went so fast, wished I would have gotten more of these!!"
"D - 11.2% Holy Shit! I don't feel any burn at all. I might need to wake up to a KBS every morning to start my day off right! I would have again, wouldn't mind aging one of these beasts for a year or so and tasting again."
"Pours a beautiful silky, dense, black that absorbs all light. A thick, creamy head forms. The nose is firmly chocolate, bourbon, smoke, layered with notes of vanilla and dried fruits. The palate is rich with a medium-full body, with intense lingering of bourbon, chocolate malt, smoke and vanilla. Attractive lacing. This stout makes me smile. Definitely moreish! Reverence and dedication to sensory exploration is a must. This is not a quaffing ale but a serious sipper for pondering and reflection. The alcohol is hidden behind the richness. With dessert or after dinner or whenever you have time to spare and enjoy."
"Color is very dark, darker than tenfidy. Aroma is amazing, i think the best part of this beer. Carbonation is great and the flavor is very good. Maybe slightly sweeter than I might like but not too hot and I could really taste the oak."
"The beer tastes thick and is very complex, changing with almost every sip. It also hides the booze well, especially as compared to other bourbon stouts. This beer got better with every sip and it takes a lot too keep it to one beer a sitting, trying to make the supply last."
"Drinkability- Not that drinkable. The flavors did not drop me to my knees in appreciation and the high ABV, combine to lower drinkability. This beer did not live up to the hype for me, but I can understand how others would thouroughly enjoy KBS."
"Definitely one of those beers that lives up to the hype and high regard, if not surpassing it. Tremendously smooth and easy drinking for an 11% beer, such great flavor and complexity. This was the 2010 version on tap, I enjoyed it much more than the 2009 version both bottled and draft...but I'll probably say the same thing next year about the 2011..."
"At first glance this stuff is like motor oil, black and viscous. The head is nice and thick and creamy with a dark tan color to it. My first aroma I got was the bourbon, then dark chocolate and a fresh cappucino smell. The taste of this stuff is just amazing. I almost feel guilty drinking it, it's so decadent. Huge cocoa up front with a nice bourbon finish. The bourbon flavor is well balanced with the coffee, just enough to let you know it's there. This stuff is potent, although the alcohol is well hidden. I gave it a lower score in drinkability only because I had trouble finishing my second pint. I guess if I were a bigger man, it would have been easier."
"Still- and much like breakfast- this is, by all means, and at the most, a one-a-day sort of thing."
"This is a fantastic beer. I rated the original very high and have refined my palate. This is right there with some of the best. The only reasons I don't rate drinkability higher is because of the high ABV and strength of taste that does a number on your palate and cognition. Yum!"
"Pour a slick black color, brown around the edges, with a tight any creamy brown head that left some sticky lacing. The aroma is that of Kaluha, nice chocolate scent with hints of coffee and booze. I would swear that this was Kaluha if blind folded. Not much bourbon pick up. The taste is of Kaluha with more of a coffee bite and vanilla presence. The bourbon is subtle but noticable and goes extremly well with the chocolatey flavors. Some light fruit tartness in the back end as well as another blast of roasted coffee. Full bodied and slick but does have active carbonation that breaks up the heavy flavors. Some stickiness in the end. Very smooth and the ABV is nowhere to be found. This is a crazy drinkable beer, great flavors but none in excess all working well together. Glad I bought an extra 4 pack."
"Mouthfeel is thick & sticky-icky. As I swirl it in my snifter, it coats the surface of the glass with an oil-like slick. Carbonation is very mild, just enough to tickle the tongue, but doesn't distract from the creamy mouthfeel of the beer. Compared to some of Founder's other bourbon barreled aged beers, I found this one to be the most balanced with the bourbon flavors. The bourbon is there but it melds perfectly with the characteristics of an amazingly well-crafted coffee stout. KBS is full of complex flavors yet remains well balanced. While I wouldn't recommend drinking more than one or two, all I know is I can't wait to crack my next KBS in a few months!"
"The beer pours a thick black with a brown head. The aroma is bitter coffee with some chocolate as well. The flavor is very complex with bourbon, oak, chocolate and coffee. The aftertaste is heavy on the chocolate with a strong warming from the alcohol. Thick mouthfeel and low carbonation. An outstanding beer overall."
"All in all, this is a great beer with, perhaps, a little too much hype surrounding it at times. I would still recommend any BA to try one or two of these but don't go trading one-for-one for a Westy or vintage DL or anything. This is a grade ""A" beer but it shouldn't be a white whale. This is another great offering from an already solid brewery that finds it's beers as regulars in my cellar."
"D-This beer is awesome. I could drink this beer again and again and again and again and again and again. O.K. You get my point. Despite the ABV, I will drink this beer anytime I have the chance. I do have 5 more chances because I own that many more. I will have to limit my intake if I do not find anymore. Please let more of this perfect beer fall my way!!!!"
"I've drank two bottles of this years KBS purchased from two different locations, and they proved to be a bit different, so I scored them based on the better of the two. The difference seemed to be in the mouthfeel and the alcohol presence, with one being thinner and boozier that the other that was thick and has less bourbon presence. I'm curious to see how time will treat these..."
"My impression of this beer is that it is a very good stout and deserves the praise and hype it gets. The only thing I would have though was that it would have a more prominent bourbon flavor as others have mentioned."
"Maybe the best beer I have ever had. Only beer at the LI festival I went back to for seconds. The pour was inky black with a bit of a tan head. You could smell rich chocolate and coffee. You could definitely taste elements of the bourbon oak barrels. In addition to the chocolate and coffee you could taste some vanilla. None of the flavors were overpowering and you could taste the different layers of flavor in each sip."
"gd this beer is good."
"Drinkability - Very slow sipper, very filling and rich, but I would be happy to nurse this all night."
"D: From what I've read this one goes down very smooth. For me, the bourbon takes a little out of the drinkability. Warms up the stomach and nose during consumption."
"Worth the hype."
"D- I could easily drink a 4 pk without even thinking about it. I'm sure the ABV would creep up on me though."
"D: If you define drinkability as how many you can suck down in ten minutes then cross this off the list. For me drinkability is synonymous with enjoyability. And this one's up there. Its a solid A beer, Its not my favorite beer, and I can't see drinking it all the time but it definitely deserves a spot in the cellar... vertical serious would be real cool."
"Poured into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass. It poured a deep black color with a slight amount of deep brown head. The aroma was all bourbon and all coffee. The taste was powered by bourbon. It had a nice balance of bourbon playing off the dark malts. The coffee was a little subdued compared to the aroma. The overall complexity of the flavor was incredible. As I mentioned the bourbon was in the driver's seat, but there were so many flavors present it was hard to comprehend. Overall an incredible brew. I was a little worried because of the hype that I would be disspointed, but it lived up to the hype."
"* Have had this many times now since my original review, all with anywhere from 2-8 months of age on it and I gotta say, I prefer it fresh."
"On draft at Monk's. Pours jet black, small mocha head. Rich bitter chocolate and coffee aroma, vanilla and bourbon. Unfortunately, flavor is very boozy with a bit too much bourbon. I may be in the minority, but this is my least favorite of the three (Canadian, regular, then Kentucky)."
"D- High, ABV in mind. A delight to drink, worthy of its place in the top 100 and all the buzz surrounding it. A perfect bourbon beer."
"This deserves a spot on the boards."
"Very drinkable for such an enormous beer. Not going to lie, this ranks very high on my list of all time favorites."
"Overall, a very good barrel-aged beer. However, I don't think I could have done more than one of these. Also, it is worth noting that I had this against the BB Imperial Stout, and I greatly preferred the latter. This is definitely worth a shot though and would probably benefit from some aging."
"KBS is slightly different on tap but no less delicious. Founders knows what the Hell to do with a stout, that's for sure."
"EDIT: Changed ""drinkability"" score to reflect overall score, which is much higher. This was done with a live review on 03/16/11."
"Very, very appealing. I see why everybody goes crazy for these. It is not hard to drink at all. The mouth feel and body was not as heavy as I thought it would be. This is a top stout, hard to beat."
"Amazingly drinkable beer for such ABV. I think I will go get more of this, 8 (now 7) may not be enough."
"D - Breakfast? What about lunch and dinner? Not to mention snacks..."
"This is the perfect beer when kicking back at night on the couch, but one or two will be the limit."
"D- This is an 11.5% beer and it feels it. It's definitely a beer you want to savor while spending the evening sitting in your favorite leather chair thinking about how good life can be."
"I'm not a huge fan of coffee in my beer, but this one hits the spot. It's so perfectly crafted, how could I not love it?"
"Considering the strength, this is a very drinkable beer. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 is the bitterness in the aftertaste. I am not a fan of a lot of bitter flavor, but that is personal preference. Overall this is an amazing beer, layers of flavor, and one of the best I have tasted."
"Founders makes some impressive looking stouts and this is no exception. Jet black with a dense, thick, dark brown head with great retention and lacing, this is one gorgeous beer. The nose is similar to my experience with this beer out of a bottle, but a little different. There's copious amounts of coffee and chocolate, with plenty of roasted malt, but there's also a more pronounced bourbon character, with a pleasant, welcome booziness and some vanilla. Caramel character is low. The palate is quite the whopper. Big coffee and chocolate up front with plenty of roasted malt bitterness. The coffee is big, with plenty of espresso character, and coupled with the medium-full body, it just feels like one. Bourbon is quite prominent as well, with heat and vanilla present. Bitter chocolate and coffee are present on the finish, along with a boozy heat. Pretty solid stuff, I drank about 20oz of it and could have gone for another glass."
"This beer is excellent, but the price is off-putting. I may enjoy this extremely, but there are many other beers for much less that I also enjoy extremely. I've seen some wallets pillaged for 14 dollars a bottle at the Dirty Truth in Northampton. The price and the hype don't make this beer any better than it is, which is good to keep in mind."
"Drinkability - I would love to session this stuff but it is a tad expensive (but worth it) and it may be hard to walk after a few. This is something to save for special occasions, excellent beer!"
"Overall, this is probably one of the best, if not the best bourbon stouts I have had. Instead of knocking you over the head with bourbon, Founders does a really great job of balancing the barrel aging with the rest of the flavor profile. Lots of stuff going on with this one. This beer lives up to the hype and is worth the price. It will be hard to resist the other three I'm trying to age in my cellar. Once again, great job Founders!"
"D - First of all, it's delicious and fairly easy drinking considering its potency."
"Drink these fresh people."
"Seriously. It was that good. Smooth. Complex. Drinkable. A piece of art."
"OK, call me a homer, but this is good shit. Make this a year-rounder Founders! On a side note; this makes me want to try another of my cellared Expedition stouts and do a re-rate."
"I could drink this until my vision blurs and the world goes dark around me. Realistically, one ought not to do this, and the price tag would prevent any frugal man from indulging in more than one per sitting. If I had to choose my last meal this beer would help wash it down."
"Overall, a fantastically flavored concoction destined to seduce my senses!"
"What cliches haven't been mentioned? Who couldn't love this beer? This is the perfect example of a beer living up to the hype, and the mythology surrounding it. Just beautiful, and the finest beer I have ever drank."
"D: Very good drinkability. Can't really enjoy more than 1 due to alcohol and sweetness, but still very good."
"Clearly, unless someone is in the mood to kill their liver and brain (not to mention their wallet), don't have a bunch in one night. I'll be aging one or two. I can see some complexity coming out and it would be good, but if you like it now, there's not a reason not to drink it if you've got more than one bottle."
"I struggle to find the better beer. I can't decide as to which is my favorite stout. There are too many variables involved. This is what I have decided. I love this beer. Sometimes you have to put away the note pad and sit back, relax, and enjoy. This is one of those beers that will make you do that. I can't scribble enough on my pad to even remotely come close to doing this beer justice. Pours black chocolate with Bourbon, chocolate, coffee, and alcohol on the nose. 100% velvet with the bourbon coming through just enough and then slowly fades back into a bitter chocolate and soothed over with malt sweetness. I can't say enough and I do not have the skills to properly do this beer justice. This is an extremely complex beer. It is above me."
"Bottle poured into a goblet. This is a fantastic beer. Very dark beer with a this tan head. You have to force pour it to get a good amount of carbonation release. The taste is coffee first, chocolate second, with bourbon throughout. I think that as the beer warms, the coffee fades and the chocolate becomes more prominent. The alcohol is present throughout. This is a fantastic beer! Is it my favorite imperial stout? I'm not sure, but this beer deserves all the credit it gets!"
"Drinkability: Wow. Are you kidding? This is one awesome beer. Of course, with it's high abv one is the limit. Besides, you want to stretch out this four pack as looong as possible."
"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of a tan color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of coffee, roasted malt, sweet malt, alcohol, and slight hop. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. There is also a strong bitterness from the roasted malts. Tastes of strong coffee, strong alcohol, bourbon/wood, and roasted malt. Overall, great aroma, great blend, good body, but appearance was lacking."
"No hype here. This is an amazing stout. My new favorite in fact. Too bad I have to cellar my last one for another year before I can have it."
"Over all, it was great and well worth the price"
"Pours an impenetrable onyx with a thin brown head that doesn't retain well, but this stuff is over 11% ABV so I didn't expect much head retention. The smell has a really nice mocha turtle brownie thing going on, with a bunch of cocoa, bourbon, coffee and caramel aromas meshing together very nicely. The flavor is also quite good, with a big cocoa presence upfront, followed by espresso, vanilla, bourbon, caramel and burnt bread. The mouthfeel is full and thick, but not sludgy. Carbonation is appropriately minimal, and drinkability is remarkable considering the style and ABV. An unforgettable stout, very complex and extremely delicious, lives up to the hype."
"Overall, I was expecting a little bit more from this beer. For better or worse, I compared this to Goose Island Bourbon County Stout. While being much more drinkable, I have to say that Goose Island has the ultimate upper hand in this match."
"Both beer and movies have their ""fan boys"" (you know, the kind that love eye candy movies like The Matrix and Star Wars and will give movies like that a high rating simply because they are supposed to like it), and this beer will be praised by biased drinkers and will try to tell you it is the best thing ever. I disagree, this is truly an overrated beer but, it's not bad. For the price, Yeti and Storm King are a much better value and you don't have to wait for them to be released."
"This is surprisingly smooth for being aged in bourbon barrels. I really enjoy barrel aged stouts, with it being a current trend, and this one does it the best. I have a hometown alliegance to GI BCS, but must say that this passed it on my list. The two things that separate this from the pack is the unique coffee angle and keeping the bourbon flavor without the burn."
"D: Founders blows me away again. While not as full and robust as CBS, this is arguably more complex and shows the great benefit coffee can bring to a beer, I love it."
"Overall: This is a really, really nice imperial stout. It has an incredible taste... but it's a bit extreme and not an ""easy to drink"". But considering the price, ABV, and limited availability, you're probably going to sip this slowly and infrequently... and that's how an intricate beer like this can be really enjoyed."
"D: well this review is on the last bottle of the four pack, so i drank the whole thing, luckily i have 2 four bangers left."
"This was my first KBS, and hopefully will not be my last."
"D-Its really drinkable for a big beer. Many of these would certainly be doable, if I don't end up falling off my chair ;)"
"Founders is known for making extreme beers and stouts and the Kentucky breakfast is no exception. Simply put, this beer will kick your ASS! I do not recommend this as a session beer. One is all you need to enjoy. After finishing the beer, I lit up a Makers Mark soaked Cigar that was an excellent cap to probably the best beer I have ever had."
"D: A well-hidden 11.2 percent. It's hard to stop at one but an easy candidate for cellaring."
"CHEERS! FOREVER YOUNG"
"Bella. this is a fantastic beer. i'm very satisfied i got as much as i did."
"D: This beer, despite how big it is, is actually very easy to drink. It will be interesting to see what this tastes like after some cellar time. There isn't a bad beer yet that I have had from Founders, and this one is truly the crown jewel. Hands down, the best Michigan beer out there."
"overall again it lives up to the hype...i think this years is a better package than last..a little more refined kind of like backwoods bastard this year vs last...i dont know how founders will top this next year..top notch"
"D = The easiest drinking 11.2--percent I've ever had. Just fantastic and delicious, and deadly drinkable. This is a young beer at this point, and I can't even imagine how it well it might age out. Seek and destroy this one."
"Feels medium to full bodied with low carbonation, which is proper for this beer. Very smooth and creamy. Very drinkable. I am glad I was able to pick up several more bottles of this."
"D: Out of curiosity to figure this beer out, I could definitely have another. However, the high a.b.v. and the bitterness in its current form lend me to say the drinkability is only good. I think I'll be updating this review in the future when the beer has had plenty of time to do its bottle-aging dance."
"Taste is really deep, sweet dry, slightly dry and a cloying but it's really nice and easy drinking. Great beer and much better than the regular version"
"The price tag slowed me down here, but my curiosity won in the end. Am I ever glad it did. One of the rare beers which actually exceeds the hype surrounding it. Truly world class."
"D - Among the best stouts I've ever had, and the flavor profile is definitive. Glad I got as much as I did!"
"Alcohol is toned down for sure from the fresh bottle, but still a little hot for my tastes. The chocolate and coffee are really intense, and balance out the bourbon nicely, tastes linger on the tongue long afterwords as it writhes from the madness. Smooth oily mouthfeel, low carbonation, feels a bit thin to me though. Very roasty and strong. Too hot for me to consider it one of the best stouts I've had, but undeniably excellent flavors here. Overall I did prefer the aged bottle to the fresh one."
"poured from bottle into poperings goblet ..it poured a black oil color with a small head i thought it was flat but alas here comes the bubbles and black cherry ring it has lots of sticky lacing on side of glass but a minimal head..the smell is vanilla bean and chocolate with smooth coffee mixed with bourbon and oak ..the taste is a smooth very smooth with roasted coffee/chocolate taste that hit the taste buds with vanilla bean /malt mixed with bourbon and hops in the background then i taste some fig and some caramel /raisins this is a nicely balanced and smooth stout..founders put alot of work into this especially with the aging process i bought a 4-pak and will drink 1 more then i will cellar the other 2 for a year if i can..what strikes me most about this stout again is how smooth it is and oh so drinkable"
"... 20 min later... just swilled the KBS bottle with 1/2 a guinness stout and poured into the same snifter... added 1/2 oz Irish Whiskey 1/2 oz Irish Creme for a ""car bomb."" The tiny amount of KBS made it the best one I've ever had... try it!"
"D= Let this one warm up a bit for sure. This beer is good but I just don't see it living up to the hype that it recieves. Good impy stout but not quite the most amazing thing ever. Great beer but I'm gonna put some age on it and see how it does."
"D: Big beer. Top to bottom filled with flavor and alcohol. Smells as complex as it tastes and has a great mouthfeel."
"Sorry to go against the grain, but this is merely a B+."
"D - I could drink these all night. There would be no way to guess this is 11% if you couldn't see it printed on the bottle."
"D: This is an exceptional beer. Definitely lives up to its name. I'm glad I picked up a 4-pack because this will age well. Will be nice to compare it in years to come to the newer batches. I still think the Goose Island BCS is still my favorite for the Bourbon stouts. This comes in a close second however."
"Lives up to the hype. Fantastic. I only managed one 4-pack.. I had planned on putting at least a couple down for a year, but I really don't know how I'll manage that."
"d - surprisingly drinkable for something so rich and strong. founders clearly put some love into this brew. got a bottle of this in the beer fridge that i'm gonna try to sit on for a while, this should age pretty well."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer, and deserves to be ranked as highly as it does. This beer would truly be great sitting by a fire on a cold evening."
"Overall, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, especially being such a fan of the ""ordinary"" Breakfast Stout. While I'm not entirely certain it lives up to hype, my score certainly tells a different story. I can honestly say that I think it's the best stout I've had. However, I think I still *prefer* to drink others."
"D - This one lived up to the hype for me. Surprisingly drinkable for an 11% beer too."
"Phenomenal stout. This thing is huge in every sense of the word."
"Drink: This is a big, thick, coffeyey son of a bitch. Drink this quickly and yous a fool for a number of reasons. This deserves to be sipped and appreciated. And its pretty boozy..."
"Drinkability: Fantastic cross between an Imperial Stout, coffee ale, and Bourbon-aged beer. Never before have I finished a beer over 10% abv and immediately wanted a second. Too bad I have a kids to get to sleep and can't pass out before they do."
"Conclusion: I had high hopes for this, and they were well-met. One of the best coffee (and bourbon-barrel, for that matter) stouts I've had to this point. Well-done Founders. I don't know if it's sharper and more intense when it's fresh; I'll have to wait until the bottled 2010 comes out in two days; what I will tell you is that with a year of age on it this is great."
"On this St. Patricks' day, I am proud to be from Michigan. This is stout ale. This is real American beer."
"D-Excellent sipping beer. I started at cellar temperature and allowed it to come to room tempature as I sipped and enjoyed this one for over and hour. I can't wait to crack the next one!"
"D- This beer is a sipper for sure but it is smooth and rich. I would have no problem having a consecutive glasses of this. I would have to say this is more balanced that the regular Breakfast Stout and not as bold of a coffee flavor. Should be interesting to see what a little bit of age does to this beer."
"M & D - Nice oily and creamy mouthfeel with a full body. Nice CO2 balance. Great beer. Drinkability lowered because of ABV but I would definitely have more of this as time goes by."
"Pours the way a big, bold stout ought to: deep pitch black (or is pitch ""KBS-black""?) with a quarter-finger of burnt sienna head that dissipates into a flat cloud lingering on the surface. A slight bit of sudsily-ringed lacing is left behind. The nose has a seemingly unhealthy amount of wood in it, almost as much as a small forest. There's also some bourbon, maple syrup, molasses, dark roast coffee, and charcoal smoke, making this one of the darkest-smelling brews I have ever had. That said, the coffee, wood, and bourbon o'erwhelm the other notes a bit, leaving me an iota unfulfilled. The taste marks a second manifestation of the nose: heavy wood notes, bourbon, molasses, vanilla, smoke, nutmeg, dark roast coffee, toffee, and a hint of chunky peanut butter. This is a fair improvement on the nose, and leaves very little to be desired. The body is indeed pretty hefty, but not too much so. The low carbonation, thick chewiness, and spitefully smooth feel all lead to a high drinkability, though this brew is clearly not a gulper; rather a highly enjoyable deep-sipper. Definitely lives up to the hype!"
"D: This beer is ridiculously and dangerously smooth. Well balanced, quite complex, flavors play off one another, and great representation of the style!"
"Different brews but pricing, hype and quality considered I´d take Goose Island Bourbon Stout ahead of this any day, or even some underrated brews like say Schlafly Reserve Bourbon Imperial Stout... Sorry KBS, it's me not you."
"And, in my opinion, it just doesn't get any better among imperial stouts. My favorite."
"This beer certainly deserves all the praise it receives."
"Appearance 3.5, Smell 4.5, Taste 4.5, Mouthfeel 4.0, Drinkability 4.5, Score 4.25"
"KBS is very thick, so the first thing I thought of was chocolate syrup. Some burnt sugar, bourbon, vanilla, and ice cream round out a thick, boozy tasting beer. The carbonation is really low, accentuating the creamy mouthfeel of this huge beer. It's not something I would like to have very often, and a half bottle was more than enough. I remember having this fresh last year and was not impressed. This needs a year at least for my tastes, as I'm not a huge bourbon fan."
"Overall maybe the easiest drinking barrel aged beer I've ever tasted. I would have no problem polishing off afew pints of this. As long as I have a ride home."
"6 mo. update. There is a lot of molasses on the nose. The coffee has faded a little, as well as the bourbon. The vanilla really pops. All of the flavors have started to fade together to form a more unified beer."
"Very, very drinkable. Excellent, well-balanced taste that isn't too rich or too heavy on the bourbon. And again, the alcohol is expertly concealed."
"D: 5 stars. I might venture to say that the bourbon is rather subdued (the extra year of age no doubt) but this is not a problem for me. All the right ingredients in this one. Now I have to have the regular release of KBS and I have the feeling I won't be disappointed."
"This stout is chock full of flavor, but in the end I find it a bit raw and rough. A big beer that just might be too big. Given this stuff's reputation on BA, it seems that many of us love being slapped and/or punched in the face with flavor. Umm... not me. I like big beers, but this one's unbalanced. Sorry!"
"M/D: Not overly drinkable, mouthfeel is smooth but it is a bit harsh on the finish. Still a very good beer that lives up to its reputation."
"D- An absolutely wonderful beer. I like it better than Depth Charge, and that's saying a lot. This is what I expected Depth Charge to be. It's a perfect mix of all ingredients. The warmer it gets, the more I taste the bourbon."
"D- For a beer at 11.2% abv this is a very smooth beer that I could drink very easily for a while."
"D: well i just slammed half the glass just trying to figure out how good it is. i keep wanting another sip. its super smooth and doesn't feel like 11% and i can only imagine how nice it will taste in a year"
"This beer is a big, complex, sweet, sour, bitter, hot, and creamy but it is so good it goes down like candy and it is as drinkable as a 11% RIS aged in bourbon barrels gets."
"A rich, full bodied brew. Drinks smooth though and the booze never overpowers the beer. Well balanced. Drinkability is a lot higher than I expected for 11.2% ABV. Glad I had the chance to try it."
"As this beer warms, it attains a chocolatey decadence with a boozy backbone. This does warrant a ""Wow!"" Let this stout warm a bit after taking out the fridge."
"Overall Impression: Another beer that lives up to the hype! Simply amazing across the board. I was expecting more bourbon and less coffee. Regardless, it's one of the greatest Stouts ever!"
"The taste took multiple sips to even begin to separate all the complex and intriguing flavors that radiated throughout. An initial blast of thick cream, toffee, and burnt brown sugar kicks you in the mouth as a whirlwind of dull-sweet chocolate malt and toasted semi-sweet chocolate dances haphazardly on the tongue. The bitterness up front is well-performed and the booze never becomes overbearing or a note worth forgetting. The bourbon, though, is the outstanding element in this beer. The bourbon flavor arrives early to the party, hangs out strong all night, and doesn't leave until the last cigarette is consumed and the last partier is ready for bed. But he never gets obnoxious or annoying; he's the one you never want to go. The only drawback you can even begin to have with this beer is the density and the complexity-it's almost too much at times. Oddly enough, as the beer warmed, I began to like it a little bit less. This really is one to have slightly chilled to catch every last highlight."
"Find this beer. Find it and buy it and enjoy it. It really is that good."
"D - Can really only do one bottle, pretty manly brew, too heavy to do tons of. Fantastic beer though."
"This is my favorite beer of all time. Founders is just making extraordinary beers and this is on the top of the mountain. Seriously try to get your hands on this if you haven't had it or if you have had it."
"Overall this beer certainly lived up to its hype for me and is yet another expertly crafted Imperial Stout from Founders. Highly Recommended."
"For me, this is the gold standard of beer. I've had at least 35 of the top 100, and I would take this before any other beer."
"The feel of this beer is a bit heavy for a beer I expected to have some mellow flavor but was kicked hard. A bit of a heavy feel going down but a great tasting beer."
"D: Tough to give a high drinkability for an 11.2% beer but this is pretty drinkable. Smooth, creamy and not an ounce of harshness from the booze or bitterness. Would love to have this on hand at all times!"
"Pours syrupy thick and black with close to an inch of brown head. Retention is moderate, with a fine ring of bubbles sticking around the edges of the glass. Smells of brewed coffee, cocoa, chocolate cake, and alcohol. The flavor is much more rich than the aroma, with loads of cocoa, fresh coffee, chocolate ice cream, chocolate cake batter, cookie dough, an opulent warming spicy finish. Chewy thick and warming with low to moderate carbonation. The nice flavor and fantastic finish make this an easy drink despite its strength. Definitely a great stout and I would lavish it with more praise, but I will reserve that for my love affair with Canadian Breakfast Stout."
"I should mention first that this is the '09 KBS, i've had one bottle laying around for a while and realized i never reviewed it. It is probably the most opaque stout i've seen, just a deep rich black with very minimal head despite a vigorous pour (probably due to age). The aromas are as complex as most beers' taste, you get a heavy roasted malt with the sweetness of chocolate, vanilla and coffee, and also a faint hint of the bourbon in the background. All of those flavors come back in the taste, just a wonderful melding of everything a good stout should be. The mouthfeel is very nice as well, there's almost three stages as an upfront, a mouth coating and then an aftertaste, each with a seemingly different effect on the flavor. The only thing that keeps me from rating the drinkability higher is the abv, i've made the mistake of drinking a KBS later in a sesh and it's basically put me to sleep. Definitely worth the hype and praises, this Founders offering stands right at the top of the imperial stout class."
"Just a great beer to sip over the course of an hour or so and see all the flavors develop and change. I feel it's best a bit fresher when the bourbon presence is felt more. I cannot wait for KBS day to arrive so I can get some more for the coming year. Definitely seek this one out!"
"Overall an excellent beer. Breakfast stout is already an amazing beer and the barrel aging really adds to it in this case making it more complex and delicious. Can't wait to buy this here in VA this year."
"D: Goes down very easy, i could drink a few easily. I only have one more left, damn Founders for leaving SC! Now i need to go on a hunt for this in a month."
"Founders may be the best in the biz when it comes to big cofee stouts and this is no exception."
"This is a monster of a stout, though I'm not a coffee fan the flavor in this beer just explode on the palate and mingle with each other perfectly thus creating a highly delectable beer for my palate."
"Please try to discover Kentucky Breakfast Stout, no matter what it takes. I think they release the new vintage on or around St. Patrick's Day. Additionally, I think they tap a keg of it once a month, and it probably lasts about a week. Grand Rapids, MI. I took a day off of work to drive three hours up there. It was worth it. It is an inspiring work of art more than it is a beer."
"Out of a bottle this legendary beer struck me instantly. As soon as I poured it out and inhaled I wrote ""wow"" in my notes. It was as dark and rich looking like used motor oil with a visibly viscous texture. The collar of brown foam was thin, the retention rather weak but the lacing quite good. The aroma was of coffee, chocolate, wood, alcohol, molasses and whiskey. The flavors offered all of the above along with tar, pine sap, leather, bourbon (specifically because of the sweetness as opposed to just generic whiskey), hints of dark fruit and burnt coffee and burnt bread. Despite the bourbon influence the alcohol was well blended in. The mouthfeel was rich but not heavy, the body medium/full and the carbonation perfect. Smooth, complex, demanding, gratifying and surprisingly drinkable. One of the finest beers I have ever enjoyed and absolutely deserving of every praise that is heaped upon it. To quote the equally legendary Ferris Bueller, ""If you have the means I highly recommend picking one up. It is so choice."""
"When I think about drinking this I could see myself sitting back and enjoying a few of these through out the night, sipping at my glass as it slowly disappears. It really is just a sipping beer a small sip many, many times over until you are disappointed because it is all gone and you still want more."
"""It tastes just like it smells...delicious"" - Tyrone Biggums"
"All in all, surprisingly balanced. Not the big bourbon bomb I thought t would be. For a beer this big it's very easy to drink."
"I can only wish a beer with this much character was released earlier in the winter. This is such a great beer to buy as late in the year as you can and hang on to it until it gets cold. Such a wonderful aroma as you open the bottle. It is heavy, but a good heavy. Don't try to eat dinner with it, just sit by the fire or in your ice shanty and enjoy."
"Pours black, with very little tan head. Initial aroma is a hint of bourbon, but not much else. As it warms, the bourbon scent becomes very strong in addition to coffee and roasted malts. Mouth feel is very smooth with little carbonation. Flavor at cellar temperature was a nice subtle blend of vanilla, bourbon, roasted coffee beans, and a touch of hops. As it warmed the bourbon and vanilla flavors got to be very intense, probably too much. I had a tough time rating this one. At cellar temp, the beer was wonderfully balanced, but once it warmed, the bourbon barrell flavor just overpowered everything else. NOTE: Re rated 8/27/06. Tap. Bourbon flavor seems to have mellowed a lot since it was first bottled. Flavor is much more balanced and enjoyable now."
"D - This beer is remarkable, hands down one of the best crafted beers I can think, while I can really drink a lot of this, this bad needs to be on everyone's want list"
"EDIT: I wrote this review over a year and 1/2 ago, and I would like to adjust it. The 2009-2010 KBS that I have tried were in all actuality, the best beers I have ever had. The way the vanilla and the oakiness of the bourbon barrel merged with the vanilla and almost malted milk ball like flavor was hard to top. Now that I have an opportunity to try the 2011, I must adjust my score. It seems to have a roasted coffee dominance that clashes with the high alcohol presence and over carbonation. Will adjust the score accordingly next year. Not horrible. Toffee just isn't my favorite flavor."
"This is undoubtedly one of my favorite brews and I'm anxiously awaiting it's arrival in a few months. Great job Founders!!"
"Halfway down the glass, I'm continuing to be impressed by the mouthfeel of this beer. There's a definite heft and creaminess to it, but it doesn't get over-bearing. Also, unlike other barrel-aged stouts I've had, the bourbon aspect is quite mellow, and doesn't crowd out the rest of the beer. A+ for drinkability."
"M&D: Good carbonation and a heavy body are great, but what really impressed my is the mouth-drying bitter feeling you get. The mouthfeel blew me away, I've never had anything like it. It's pretty drinkable for the abv content and it's not too heavy. I could probably do a couple bottles."
"A good beer and would like another, but probably won't seek it out via trades. The chocolate is very heavy but is balanced out nicely with the bourbon."
"Definitely want another, but have to drive to Thanksgiving dinner!"
"D - Very easy to drink despite the high abv. This is an incredible stout, and I certainly wouldn't mind getting my hands on more of this stuff!"
"All in all, this brew is fantastic. I can't believe I took so long to try it. Definitely one of my faves! Founder's has a great thing going here. Recommended for craft beer-aholics and people looking to expand into craft brews alike."
"This beer isn't that complex. Maybe I've been spoiled - maybe it's not aging well with the bourbon notes mellowing and bringing out the coffee... I just know that it didn't live up to my expectations."
"An excellent beer, both in general and within the style. Must acquire more..."
"D: This one is a heavy hitter but surely enjoyable. Has mellowed a little since my last taste in March 2009. Very good I would say great stout overall. I think it is a great beer that I will look forward to reviewing against this coming years version."
"The first time I tried this I didn't quite buy into the hype, but now I am a believer. This is one of the best all-around beers I've tried."
"Overall, this is probably one of my favorite beers of all time and I am glad I finally had the chance to try this on tap and have a couple glasses as well. Well done, Founders!"
"Met expectations, which were pretty high. Deserves it's ranking. A beer I would always like to have around. If you like the whiskey barrel, and you like coffee stouts...pull up a chair."
"I was very excited to finally get my hands on this, but after I did I came away very disappointed. Its not drinkably, not complex, and just not a great RIS."
"Taste is slightly sweet and full of smooth coffee and bourbon flavor. Quite strong and tasty vanilla flavor with a tasty chocolate and bourbon aftertaste. Smooth and never bitter"
"Heavy vanilla, coffee, choclate, raison taste. Not as sweet as a Dark Lord(Three Floyds), but similar in the raison/coffee taste. Very heavy, almost like watered down syrup in consistency. Even more flavors as beer warms up. Very solid Imperial Stout!"
"Consumed - 11/24/2009"
"D: The drinkability is surprisingly good for such a strong beer. The beer is not ""hot", and the flavors are absolutely sensational. I'm glad that I have another one of these to enjoy."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again and I would definitely recommend this to those who enjoy the Breakfast stout but better, maltier and richer in flavor."
"D - 1 was my limit on this, I've had more than one of both of the others, I didn't enjoy this beer the same way as the others, it was in the finish."
"Mouthfeel is silky smooth with substantial body. Bitter taste with astringent bourbon impressions very pronounced, bakers chocolate and burnt coffee, chocolate almond biscotti, some nuttiness. Very complex stout with a huge taste, velvet feel although just a touch too astringent... I could live with a steady supply of these!"
"Should be a sipper of a beer, but it makes you want to sip frequently. Outstanding beer, give me more."
"It's my birthday and I did nothing but work for 12 hours. I came home and fell asleep for two hours, so technically, it's no longer my birthday. Be that as it may, I got up and decided to hit the beers. I'm getting a kegerator next week and my refrigerator is currently loaded with 200+ beers. Luckily I'm a chef and can bring food home, because I sure as hell have no where to store it. Irrelavent. Drank many other beers. Decided to have a special beer for the occasion. Good God this is good. I'm not a scientific rater. I'm not going to break this down to categories. What I will say is that I hate coffee. I also hate bourbon. And if I could, this beer would flow from every tap in my home. I went through hell to procure just one 2007 bottle of this Felix Felicitas, and my advice to everyone is: If you find it, buy it. All of it. Elbow people in the face if they get too close before you get it home. You will not regret it. Cheers!"
"Oil can black color with a thin tan head. High ABV keeps the head down and there is no lace. Smell of bourbon with some coffee and burnt malt in the background. Taste hits you up front with the bourbon and then the coffee and burnt malts slip in. Some dark fruits and raisin flavors slip in there too. Very full mouth with very litle carbonation. Some major burn in the finish. Overall this one is exactly what you would expect. Big, in your face, full of alcohol. Well done Founders."
"d-the heat did distract me. not the mildest 11% I've had, however I did not have a problem finishing the bottle."
"D- Powerful beer, but tastes great enough to drink a few glasses. As great as this is, I may have liked the Canadian Breakfast just a little more. Just a hair."
"D: This is Founders Breakfast Stout but just better in every way that it could be better. More chocolate, deeper coffee, and overall more complexity and character. An amazing experience that I can't wait to have again."
"w-o-w. pours midnight black with an almost nothing beige head. aroma is deeep, dark chocolate, black coffee, kentucky bourbon, and maybe some more black coffee. taste is very strong of coffee, with some chocolate and an alcohol finish. very thick, roasty and full of coffee and chocolatey goodness. one of the best beers i have ever had in general, hands down."
"This beer is almost indescribable. Jet black body. Aroma of dark chocolate, vanilla, coffee, bourbon. Flavor - more of the same. Unbelievably complex but no odd flavors. Mouthfeel - extremely rich. Drinkability - even at 11% ABV I want to drink this all the time. Next year I need 2 cases."
"Nice smooth mouthfeel. Minimal carbonation makes this one slick and oily, and the bourbon warmth coats my palate with each sip. It could use a bit more carbonation, but nonetheless it was still a joy to sip on for an hour or so. The drinkability is out of this world for the ABV, but with another year on it I think the bourbon heat will have mellowed out and this one would be just about pitch perfect."
"J"
"Poured into a snifter with a very little carmel colored head. Appears pitch black, this beast is thick. Smells of dark chocolate and coffee, i am not really smelling any of the bourbon. Taste is like a dark chocolate truffle, wow this is tasty and the alchol burn is very mild as well which is nice. Mouthfeel is creamy with bubbles from the slight amount of carbonation. If i was able to drink more then two i would. Best stout i have had so far with blackout stout being a close second. Recomended"
"Drinkability- The texture of it was great, and it went down smooth, up until the after taste."
"Cheers!"
"I'm extremely fortunate and glad to get a chance to try this mammoth of a beer. It completely deserves it's stature among the best in the world. I would really love to try an older bottle to see the differences and changes with this beer. Thanks, Sean for the chance!"
"One of the best imperial stouts out there and a must try if you haven't already. I can't wait for the next release."
"D = A little strong in strength of flavor and burn to rate perfectly in drinkability. You don't just want to quaff this. On the other hand, it is really good, I really want to keep taking each sip and look forward to the next time."
"Was served out of a bottle. I recently talked with a Founders Rep and he stated they have it on tap currently. I'm going to try and hurry in for some. I guess they also have some great habanero beer. Can't wait."
"Overall: Amazing drinkability!! So many huge aromas in the smell, it made me think this would be difficult to finish... until I tasted it. Despite the huge coffee flavor and roasted malt this beer is so smooth!! The sweet character combined with the bitter roasted/coffee/chocolate flavors and oaky bourbon keep me very interested. Quite complex and smooth... just what I was hoping for!"
"Founders has really perfected balance with this beer. All of the flavors are pretty evenly represented. Nothing is too much or too little. I think the bourbon flavors could have been easily over the top for me since I'm not really a hard liquor fan, but it's evenly balanced with coffee and chocolate. Just plain delicious!"
"Tom and Analise"
"A drinkable beer without a doubt."
"This was poured on tap into a snifter glass. The beer was black wtih a brown head. The head was big and fabulous. There was a definite chocolate aroma (which is a bit of a surprise). The taste was super chocolately and you could feel the bourbon barrel but not overwhelmingly so. The alcohol was noticeable and had a bit of a bite on the tongue (I imagine before aging it might have had a lot more bite!) Drinkability... I never know how to rate drinkability on a high ABV beer, it's drinkable, yes, only to a point!"
"D - Pretty good for a bourbon barrel imperial stout."
"4.0 D: Alcohol is less pronounced than I'd expect and that is great. Like I said in the taste section, the coffee and bourbon competes rather than complements. I probably won't be having too many more of these since GI BBS is a much better bourbon barrel brew and the regular FBS is a much better coffee stout."
"D - Well the bottle version wins out over the tap version in my book. The extra aging gives the flavors and textures a bit more time to mellow out and blend together. The subdued boozyness increases the drinkability. The only attribute that was less desireable was the appearance due to lack of full head and lack of coating."
"Edit: The Patriots came back to win with :50 left in the game, 2 hours later, just as I was finishing up the KBS!"
"Its more than drinkable, its an easy addiction."
"D- Gotta slow down, but this one is epic. I love it."
"D: This russian imperial stout not meant for summer sessions; but rather long, cold winter nights."
"D: The smoothness of this brew really blew me away, I didn't think a beer of this size could be drunk that easy. Probably the best bourbon barrel aged brew I've had as the bourbon flavor was perfectly balanced with the other flavors. I've been sold on Founders for a while, but this brew is a further testament to their greatness. I still think their Impy Stout is better, but if you're a fan of Founders try this beer at all costs."
"D: I would definitely get more when it becomes available again."
"I was really excited when I smelled this beer but the flavor really came up short for a bourbon aged beer. I didn't think I'd say this but I think I prefer Bourbon County Stout to this."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is great! I am a coffee and burbon fan, so this one is just about perfect. This is a must have, and worthy of its place among the best beers in the world. Skal."
"Pours pretty much flat black: no head, a little white lacing. The smell is whiskey, dark dried fruits, toffee, cocoa. The taste is burnt malt, chocolate, whiskey, more chocolate, of the salty, bitter, unsweetened variety, in the aftertaste; coffee taste is mild but throughout. It's viscous, low in carbonation, nicely filling. Too easy to drink: the alcohol is not apparent."
"M/D: Extremely thick, as I mentioned before. Every bit as thick as the pour indicates. Almost no carbonation at all. The texture is silky, smooth, and creamy. The complexity is the most amazing part of this beer. I have never experienced so many flavors in such even and well- balance proportions. A bit too heavy for more than 2, but an absolutely phenomenal beer. I am so happy that I was able to enjoy this."
"D - Bourbon barrel aged beers take on lots of different characteristics. This is probably my favorite of these beers. The aging gives lots of added flavors making this beer taste great. The big trick is obtaining the complexity without the heat - something this accomplishes very well. I want to feel like I'm drinking a beer (albeit a strong one), not a shot of bourbon. Given the strength of this, it is extremely smooth and drinkable...just great for this style."
"MF&D - the one real redeeming factor for this brew is that it is very very drinkable despite the high abv. one hardly (sadly) taste the alcohol or whiskey barreling process. aside from that, the body of the beer is too thin for the style. american doubles are supposed to be thicker than an ris, but this is barely cutting it for that. it has a heavy body, but one at the far light side of heavys. not something for which I would dish out the money again, much prefer the regular breakfast stout."
"Designer dark chocolate bars and booze-soaked bourbon-barrel planks fight for the tastebuds, with the alcohol eventually winning the rights to the back of the tongue and throat. The finish is sticky with a warming booze and bitter with earthy hops, but neither in a harsh way. Few beers completely coat the lips, tongue, and roof of the mouth like KBS. This. stuff. is. THICK. Thankfully, there's enough carbonation to keep this behemoth afloat, as the mouthfeel is equal parts velvety smooth and spiced with booze. Founders manages to both set trends in the American craft brewing industry and simultaneously raise the bar, and as such, KBS deserves its place among the top of the the category that is ""Extreme Brewing""."
"Bottle. Pours black with a small light tan head. Aroma of roasted nuts, chocolate peanut butter, coffee, and a touch of bourbon. Flavor is a touch more bourbony with more chocolate and lots of coffee. The bourbon is light but definitely present in the flavor. This is s good beer! Better than the original? Maybe..."
"12oz bottle thanks to bret27. Black with a tan head. The aroma has dominating coffee, mixed with plenty of oak and alcohol. Hot flavor with a little bourbon, wood, and coffee. Medium-full body with some tannic, woody astringency and alcohol burn in the finish. A blast of flavor, with a cool mix of coffee and bourbon that works a little better than in the aroma. The mouthfeel definitely brings it down though, with too much astringency and alcohol. This is one that I can see liking a lot better with a good deal of age on it to soften things."
"Overall: exceptional very delicious imperial stout."
"This one reminds me a lot of the GL BA Blackout Stout. Bottle pours black with an aroma that makes me want to keep smelling and drinking it. Smells of dark coffee and some bourbon abound. Head is a dark tan, almost milk chocolate color. Head does not last very long. Tastes like roasted coffee and bourbon from the first sip to last. Mouthfeel is velvety silky smooth with some occasional hints of oats. This is simply an outstanding brew and is easily of my favorites."
"D: Well since I only bought 2 I cannot really say, but I want another one, just not going to pay the mail order price, but these 2 were damn fine beers."
"The drinkabllity is right where it should be for a beer of this class. After i drank this beer i wanted another, even though i know that one was plenty! At almost 12% this beer goes down easy. I enjoy sipping and savouring the beer, but i really want to drink several in one sitting. If you in joy stout u owe it to yourself to get this beer!!!"
"This beer is definitely a sipper. Not very session able but a few of these would go a long way. The barrel aging was apparent, which was nice. Only wish that the alcohol was dialed down a bit. Cant say I agree with the ranking of this beer on best of BA but still a great stout"
"Sooo good. To the no I won't do it. Too damn good. Luckily I have a lot left. My favorite I've tasted but i know I'm gonna love CBS since I looove maple syrup."
"it may be slightly over-carbonated, but it has the ""motor oil"" thickness so essential to the mouthfeel of great imperial stouts. drinkability is hindered by the on-the-verge-of-overwhelming alcohol presence."
"D - This is one beer session my friends, any more than one is a waste. Hey take your time with this one is all I can say. So I lowered the score on drink ability. You will not crack this one open after mowing a lawn, but if you definitely like to end the day on a high note this one will do."
"It's exceptional that a beer that is pretty readily available (at least during March) maintains such a high level of quality. One of the few stouts in the top 100 that isn't overrated."
"Overall, for a stout coming in at 11.2%, this stout is as drinkable and delicious as I have ever had. Glad to have another bottle, going to need to trade for some more and stock up for winter."
"KBS is black with a tan head. Very little retention or lacing. Aromas are all vanilla and bourbon. They are heavy but most definitely inviting. Despite being hot (this is the most recent release and it's still very strong on the alcohol), the flavors are smooth, going down like a fine bourbon should. Vanilla, spice, and a bit of coffee bean. That is all, but that's not to say there isn't complexity. Everything here is so finely layered, while also pulling together to effectively create a delicious imperial stout that demands to be sipped on for dessert! Big body and low carbonation. I look forward to trying this again after a year or two. Age will do this beer some good."
"CHEERS!!"
"D- Overall a huge brew with a nice bourbon flavor that wasn't over done."
"This is a creamy, rich beer that is way too easy to drink. 12 oz is the perfect size for a beer like this. If I had to pick one stout to drink for the rest of my days, I think this would be it."
"D: Not too bad at all definitely a sipper but so worth having."
"Notes: What a great experience. I am glad that I spoke with the guy at Warehouse Beverage to score this one."
"I don't know if it's worth the hype necessarily, but it's a good beer."
"A great stout that lacks a bit in body and malt to be world class. Still very good and well worth a try!"
"Regardless KBS is a great beer. Viscous black with good lacing. Lotsvanilla caramel coffee and char smell and flavor. It seems like KBS has everything a beer can have. Theres dark chocolate and bourbon notes as well. Incredibly easy to drink for such a big beer. It is still a little hot but overall there is not much to complain about."
"D - I really wish this was more than 12 oz. I'd like to taste on a 750 ml all night."
"Pitch black with a finger high dark tan head. Very strong coffee ground aroma, a bit of vanilla and toffee. Flavor is coffee, dark chocolate, toffee, vanilla, and a just a tad bit of bourbon, but that is a stretch even. Amazingly hides the alcohol almost completely. Dry, slightly sweet finish with a little bit of carbonation. Thick and almost chalky, not quite. Very enjoyable."
"D: I love this beer every year and I will drop the $20 a four pack until they don;t make it anymore."
"This has been a favorite for a while now though I prefer it on draft (also fresher for me) but borderline incredible nonetheless and a must try for fans of big stouts."
"I'm wading into mouthfeel territory now, and it's difficult to separate the two. The beer's complexity gives rise to a tasting experience in which I taste a bourbon stout while I feel an oaky ale. I've yet to perfectly rate a beer, and perhaps it's ridiculous obstinance at this point. Still, as I enjoy this cold beer that I poured (gently) into my Flying Dog pint glass, I wonder if only serving style is what's holding this back. Next time, I'll serve it slightly warmer, in a snifter. Ah, next time...."
"D= No matter what the epic nature of this fine ale's ABV caused me to believe, the flavors and aroma combined to endear it to me forever. I would gladly give whatever the bar-maid asked to have another glimpse of this in my glass and dare I say I would do so multiple times of an evening. Highly recommended...huzzah!"
"Good mouthfeel, good drinkability. An excellent example of the style. Glad I have another 5 backed up in the cellar...will be nice to see how these age."
"M-"
"D: Just friggin' awesome. Thank you, Founders, for making this."
"D - Great."
"Drinkability? Eh, I think this is my last beer for the night."
"D: Fairly easy to drink, if you like bourbon, which I happen to. Yes it is indeed completely different than Founders Breakfast Stout, and IMO much better. This beer is a solid punch to the mouth of malt and bourbon, which adds up to everything that it is claimed to be, it just is a little thinner than I had hoped for. Would pair nicely with a cigar. Nice beer, and I hope to acquire some more somehow. Thanks Ben!"
"Drinkability is fantastic one of those beers that you buy a four pack and sit on it every 4 months just to enjoy it. Great tasting Michigan brewed beer that has kicked this style up a notch and created many other folks' inspiration."
"Pretty drinkable beer, it really masks the high ABV well. A good one overall."
"This is as close to a ""5" as I think I have ever come to rating a beer, and as it stands, is not only the best stout I've ever had, but the best beer I've ever had.  The only downside, if there is one, is its hefty price point and rather spotty availability.  Still, this stout is so good that if I were to come across a 4pk at my local bottle shop, I think I would turn a blind eye when it rings up north of $24.  In any event, I would definitely suggest you seek out a bottle or two. I can only imagine that cellaring would elevate this beer into the rarefied air of ""sublime.""  What an exemplary, barrel-aged treat Founders has given us."
"D: Ultra smooth with no hint of alcohol. Amazing!"
" Good drinkabilty, but I don't see why you'd want to drink more that two in one sitting. Three at the most. Maybe four. Hahaha. Kentucky Breakfast Stout was so good, I felt guilty afterwards."
"Truly mind blowing. A beer I will not soon forget, and one that I will now be seeking out with ravenous desire."
"One of the best Barrel-Aged Stouts I've ever had! The appearence is dark as dark can be with a beautiful creamy dark head. Smell very nice, Bourbon for sure! The taste is spot on. Exemplfies the style! Smoothe oily mouthfeel makes you yearn for the next sip!"
"A wonderful beer, I am glad I got to try a 2008."
"D- This beer makes me want to keep drinking more and more but it is definitely a sipper and the high ABV (and price) would make it hard to have more than one in a night."
"Had this back to back with Canadian Breakfast Stout. Actually preferred CBS, although both are excellent world class offerings."
"D- one and done, maybe it's just me, but it ended up as drinking as a lightly fermented bourbon."
"Edit: This was an 08 bottle cellared by Derek hoppymeal. Thanks for this whale of an extra. By far one of my new favorites."
"Mouthfeel: Very thick, chewy almost. Motor-oil like. Very viscous."
"this is definately a dessert or nightcap for me personally, it is very sweet for the style and a bit to heavy on the java."
"In conclusion, it looks nice, but smells like liquor and tastes like liquor."
"I am going to hide the bottles I am aging, or they won't last very long!"
"I loved this beer far more than I expected to, and disagree with the sentiments that this is overly bourbony. As zminor said: ""This is the beer Bourbon County Stout WANTS to be"""
"This was my first BA top 10 beer and I figured it was as good a beer as any to do my first BA review. It was really good, and very unique, but it made me really want to try the regular breakfast stout as the bourbon presence in this beer was so strong that I can barely fathom what it would be like if it were missing."
"I had really high hopes for this beer. I love the Founders Imperial Stout and the Breakfast Stout, so I was really excited to try the KBS. The KBS poured a rich black color. To me the smell was a little overpowering. This seemed more of a sipping beer and not a gulper. The alcohol taste was too overpowering to enjoy and it nearly masked the hints of coffee and chocolate."
"Overall this is an awesome beer, and if you find it somewhere, DO NOT pass it up. Pay the high price tag, it is worth it."
"Had this at the Founder's brewery about two weeks ago. Poured into a snifter. Pours blacker than a cow's inside. A light head just sat on the top. Wonderful aroma of chocolate and coffee combined with bourbon - wow what a combo. The taste starts with chocolate and coffe and then the bourbon kicks in with awesome caramel and vanilla flavors. Very smooth, thick and syrupy, the way it should be with a nice throat warming finish. A great sipper and cigar beer. I had the nitro version which I liked way better than the normal version because it tasted a lot smoother. Great beer."
"Edit2: Changed a few things for the fresh 2010 batch. Nothing too major."
"Overall, a good beer, but the dominating alcohol taste really prevented me from truly appreciating this beer as the alcohol masked a lot of the other flavors associated with this beer."
"If manly beers are your thing, this is the one for you. As soon as you think you like aggressive beers, try this. I hated it four years ago when I first had it. It was just too much. Now, my palate has matured. Yes, it's still a bit much, but I appreciate what Founders has done. This beer doesn't apologize for what it is. If you're lucky enough to find this beer, I suggest letting it sit for a while until you graduate from other imperial stouts."
"Drinks incredibly well, zero alcohol bite, the smoothed roasted character."
"Very smooth drinking beer that half a bottle of was definitely plenty to enjoy."
"www.theviceblog.com"
"Pours a three finger dark brown head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Black color, no highlights. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Sweet roasted coffee nose. Flavor is sweet roasted coffee, don't detect the bourbon barrel, high ABV is hidden, almost burnt coffee finish. Nice stout. Pricey at $6.95 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"also poured about 1/6 of the bottle into a glass with some ice cream and oh boy this beer works so well"
"One of my favorite beers since getting into craft."
"This is the ultimate sipping beer. The flavors are complex and demanding. Peat, bourbon, vanilla, roasty malts, a dry hop finish. Warming alcohol in the back. Much more demanding than CBS which I had before and more rewarding. The dry finish helps it pair well with more options and it doesn't have that overwhelming sweetness. Smooth carbonation."
"D - Better than good less than exceptional as if you drank this one it might be very hard to drink another."
"A: The color of ebony, only a hint of light passes through at the edge of the glass, lots of sticky foam on the glass, noticeable body - 4.75, S: One whiff and I'm in sensory overload, whiskey in upfront but not overpowering, loads of vanilla and chocolate, coffee is also present, some minor signs of charring - 5.00, T: A massive palate, lots of chocolates malts and even more espresso, some pureed burnt raisins, though there are hops they are overpowered by the huge malt base, like the nose there is a solid presence of vanilla, one tasty beer - 4.50, M: Thick and silky, lingers on the tongue - 5.00, D: One of the most impressive beers I've had to date, a true gem, but as I say that I will concede that I still think Goose Island's Bourbon Brand County Stout edges it out, as a side not the beer is now labeled 'KBS' instead of Kentucky Bourbon Stout - 4.50"
"This beer is very very good. Is it worthy of all the hype? Personally, I don't think so. Founders Imperial Stout is superior to this, In my opinion. But you do get a massive complexity, even for an Imperial Stout. If you can find it, pick it up. But, I think there are better Imperial Stouts out there that are much cheaper and more widely available."
"A lot of the same flavors come through in the taste. Alcohol just slightly present- enough to let you know its there. But not intrusive. Such a full, coating mouthfeel of chocolate and roasted coffee beans. As drinkable as could be for a monster of this ABV and style. Overall, I liked this release a lot more fresh than the 2008- the slightly tweaked recipe was definitely an improvement. It will be interesting to see how this one develops with a little age on it."
"D--Definitely a slow drinker here due to the intense flavor, but at over 11% ABV what do you expect really? Definitely a beer for those who adore brashness, although perhaps not quite refined enough to be truly drinkable. 6 oz. served at nearly room temperature would make for the best drinking experience with this brew."
"D: This is a sipper. A delicious, delicious sipper. The only negatives are the price and the fact that it is pretty boozy. I went to kiss my girlfriend and she said, ""You smell like coffee and booze"""
"I didn't think KBS could get better but out of the nitro-tap, it is!"
"This is a great brew and worth all the accolades and posts it gets. Once again a big thanks to Dan for getting a case for myself and a friend to share. I have traded quite a bit of it away for some other gems to various local buddies. I am pretty sure I am going to keep the rest of it for myself."
"The beer is robust, with low carbonation and a creamy, grainy mouthfeel."
"The alcohol presence is a little too strong to drink more than one of these, but as a sipper this is definitely a very pleasant experience."
"Very good beer, but I gotta be honest, I prefer the original Breakfast Stout. Ah well, to each his own..."
"D - Amazingly drinkable for 10% ABV! This is simply an awe-inspiring beer that needs to be sampled on tap. Definitely one of the most flavorful stouts I've had the pleasure of drinking. This is an amazing beer to say the least!"
"D: High ABV limits the D on this, but, a fine sipper."
"O: This is the finest stout I have ever had and if I ever see it on the shelves again I will surely pick up some more."
"overall - A definite winner. It's sharp, bitter chocolate and coffee contrast oh so well with the sweet, heady, smooth vanilla and bourbon. The notes are simple, but so well executed. A joy to drink."
"Second time having this beer it was much, much better. Pitch black sludge with a dark mocha head. Incredibly scent of dark coffee, sweet bourbon and coffee with a deep, robust flavor of the aforementioned. Fantastic."
"Edit: I've recently had this beer both on tap and on nitro-tap. Tap is the way to go, nitro-tap is least preferable actually. The alcohol really came out in a bad way for whatever reason on the nitro tap"
"This is really a great beer that is deserving of all of its praise. The only way this could get better would be to have even more bourbon hitting the nose."
"Been wanting to try this for a long time finally got a chance to drink it. Thanks to Davey for sharing this one. Poured 2008 bottle into snifter. Pours a Opaque black with a dark thin head that faded pretty fast. good lacing on the side of the glass. Smells like the breakfast stout but with some vanilla and bourbon in there, more bourbon than anything I think. Taste was pretty hot, I was surprised how hot this still was after a year of settling down. Still a very very tasty beer. Oily and creamy mouthfeel. I wouldn't be able to drink more than one of these in a sitting, in fact I'm glad a shared a 12 oz. with someone."
"D- Man this stuff has so much more bourbon flavor, which is good in my opinion, when its fresh. I could happily have 2-3 of these."
"very good, but not sure if it lives up to the hype."
"Notes - A sipping beer anyone should be happy to enjoy. At this price thank goodness it is only around once a year. Better than the regular FBS."
"D: This is definitely a drinkable beer. One of the best imperial stouts out there."
"You could have more than one but you probably don't have more than a few."
"Yes, it's strong but if you don't like that, there are plenty of other brews out there to try. Normally, I get repeated tastings of a beer to see if my first instinct was right but since this was in such short supply, I only got one bottle. No matter, while the aroma and pour were a bit understated, most everything about this was excellent. So good in fact, that this would fit in before, during, and after dinner. Kudos to founders for upping the ante on the versatility of beer and for brewing this; every brewery should have an offering on this level in their portfolio!"
"After an aggressive pour, a dizzying aromatic displays unfurls from the glass that calls to mind one of life's great pleasures: standing in a bakery in the morning when the air is filled with freshly brewed coffee and hot pastries are coming out of the oven. The minimal head looks like a dollop of dark chocolate mousse while the body shimmers with the blackness of a Betty Page costume. The first taste is as shockingly rich as you can imagine. Vanilla beans dance on the tip of the tongue. Exquisite chocolate coats the palate followed by an intense impression of coffee and finishing with the smoky char imparted by the sweet bourbon barrel full of brown sugar and wood tannin. Just picture Ghiradelli fudge brownies by a campfire followed by a sip of your favorite single barrel bourbon. '09 seemed slightly hotter this year, but I am sure with time it will settle in to its world-class self. KBS is a fitting tribute to the Bluegrass!"
"D: This is a big beer but it is nicely drinkable. You proably don't want to drink too many because of its size and the fact that it is a bit sweet at times. Still, its a pretty damned smooth beer that has amazing qualities. The aroma is amazing, and the flavor is not far behind at all. My only gripe is that I can't get more of this at the store. Founders, bring this beer to a store near me. You buried it in the back of the net with this one and I am glad I chose this beer to celebrate tonight. Awesome beer that surpasses the hype."
"overall this beer is one the the best i have had really clean finish im really happy i got my hands on a few of these cant wait to see how these age"
"The pour on this particular brew amazed me. Motor oil black poured in to my glass with only a hint of brown showing where the beer was thin while being poured. To see a beer this dark was great. The head was a little hard to form but not bad and came out a very brown foamy head. that disapeard after a couple of mins. The flavor of this Double Stout was complex and not for me. The flavor of dark chocolated and roasted coffe were up front and strong. These two flavors blended and balanced extremely well, so well that I swore there was a new flavor every sip. Behind the major flavors I could swear to have a new taste with each sip. The mouth feel was perfect. The brew was smooth and nothing in the beer killed my taste buds. The drinkability for me has to be about average, as I owuld probably think twice on a secound and pass on a third. The flavors are very intense coffee and I just personally slowly enjoy these brews. This beer will always have a place in my fridge and tummy."
"dense black color with a minimal tan head and lacing. love the bottle label. dark dried fruit, chocolate, coffee, vanilla in the nose with just a hint of whisky. fortunately this does not smell boozy despite the barrel aging, no small feat given that and the abv. taste is lots of the above with big sweet dark malts mingling with not-overdone roastiness and just enough bitterness. again just a touch of the whisky character. big and lush mouthfeel and veeery smooth. looong complex finish is semi-sweet but manages not to be cloying. light creamy carbonation is perfect for this style. this was some amazing shit, what i liked the best was that it was not overly whiskyish or boozy. this was like having a decadent chocalatey dessert that managed not to be overly sweet. get you some."
"Hours black into a tulip pint glass with a slightly thin, brown head. Great retention that fades to a patchy lace once halfway through. Smell is strong oak, vanilla, and slightly bitter dark chocolate (this was a surprise to me). Taste it extremely complex particularly for a stout. It begins with a slight hoppyness that is joined quickly by the bourbon. This lingers until the sweet vanilla shows up and a surprise appearance of chocolate. This all fades to a very nice coffee flavor that almost completely hides the alcohol. What is amazing to me (even more so than the complexity) is the crisp, clean after taste. I feel like most stouts that end on a coffee note have a lingering aftertaste. Not KBS- it's very clean and that makes it waaaay too drinkable! Lastly, the 'thicker side of medium' mouthfeel and carbonation level are matched perfectly to the taste. I love thick brews but the rich, creamy texture is what makes this brew exceptional to me- I love it!"
"This is the King of the bourbon coffee stouts."
"This is a very good example of the style. However, I should have aged it for a while. Still quite drinkable while young and it doesn't take away from the potential that this beer has. The aroma is intact but the taste needs some age."
"D - At 11.2% alcohol, this is remarkably drinkable. As with most great bottles, I would like to have this on Tap!"
"Taste was just the same with to me much more dark chocolate than coffee, full but not distracting alcohol from middle to end and certainly nice warming effect throughout the finish. Coffee is there as is some vanilla, raisin. Very smooth mouthfeel and the bourbon aging comes through nicely without taking away any of the other notes. Drinkability will always be low at >10% ABV but truly I could have had another if it weren't so bloody hard to find. I rarely give a 5 for taste but this is an exemplar for the style."
"Overall I think this beer is just a bit more drinkable on draft, as it was soooo good. This is a world class beer folks, don't ever pass it up if you get to try it. Wonderful, one you will remember. Founders does it again."
"She knew Him. Now He's all I have. Put down the drink, I must go back to battle."
"I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from trying KBS, but it's not the bourbon-aceous miracle I'd been led to expect. Give it a try, but don't expect a ton of bourbon character -- for that, look to Goose Island Bourbon County Stout or Founders Nemesis 2009."
"Drinkability- tastes way to strong of liqour, i hope my other kbs tastes way better aged big freaking let down a terrible beer as of now that tastes too much burbon to be called beer, could never drink more then even one of these overerated beers, in my opinion had much better stouts"
"This is definitely an interesting and tasty beer. The flavor is much more balanced than the standard Founders Breakfast Stout, which to me seemed like a pint of cold coffee. The 10% alcohol is hidden pretty well and sneaks up on you before you finish off one bottle. Definitely give this beer a try if you can find it."
"EDIT: A second bottle was even better. Granted I gave this one a pretty stellar score, but my second bottle was on par with the normal Breakfast Stout. The bourbon had mellowed slightly and the flavors had layered more. I'm thinking that holding on to one of these for a long time might be REALLY amazing."
"Yes it is 10%ABV, and you get an indication of that when drinking it. But the flavors are so wonderful and it is so smooth that you tend to want to overlook that part and just drink another."
"I have to say that I'm so much more impressed by the draught version of this beer. The flavors were much more well-blended and balanced and the alcohol was better contained. In the bottle version I really felt like the bourbon came across in the nose and taste waaay too hot and seemed more like rubbing alcohol. I'm hoping the rest of the 4 pack I have aging comes out like this growler did."
"This is an excellent beer, def worth trying if you can get it. Not something I'd drink a lot of but it's a really nice beer."
"One hell of a big brew. Looks kinda flat then the head appears at the end of the pour. Nice rich Bourbon nose. Taste you have to experience. If you like Bourbon or whiskey in general you'll love it. Exceptional in every way. Loses a few points for drinkability because it's so damn dominating. A one at a time brew, but it's also priced that way too. A can't miss if you like world class stouts."
"when we got this into the store me and the guys had to try it. the aroma is light coffee with a hint of chocolate. the body is thick and rich. the flavor is is full of coffee and chocolate with a nice lacing of bourbon in the finish. In my opinion it is worth every penny you pay"
"The finish is powerful and the whole experience is warming and beautiful. A classic beer that is worthy of any quest to find it."
"Drinkability: Hell. Yes. What an amazing beer. All of us were blown away. It takes smart and talented people to craft such a beer, and thankfully Founders has done it. Glad I finally got a chance to try this. Worth going out of your way for."
"D- I split a bottle with my father and it was not enough, drank at cellar temperature and even as it warmed to room temperature it was just as good, simply an outstanding beer."
"Another great brew from Founder's. Thanks to sarahspat for this awesome trade. Poured it into a tulip glass and man was this a thick beer, black as night, with a very small brown head. A little bit of lacing makes this one look promsing. Smells of smoke, coffee, oak, almonds, and definitely vanilla. The taste is unbelievable roasted malts, hinting at espresso beans. So incredibly delicious. This one is creamy and thick like a good stout, but with a kiss of carbonation that cuts through it and gives you a pleasant break. Simply a magnificent beer."
"This poured pitch black with dark tan head. It smelled like bourbon-soaked oak and roasted coffee, with some vanilla and oranges and cream. It tasted like roasted coffee and milk chocolate followed by strong bourbon and oak, then a bit of smooth brown sugar and cooking vanilla and fresh oranges. It was thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a lasting smooth and bitter oak aftertaste. Overall this had a fantastic flavor that was bold and complex, yet delicate and easy to drink. It hid the alcohol well, to the point that you really have to be careful drinking this one. It had great body that was silky smooth. I couldn't get over how well the different flavor elements were blended together. Simply delicious. This is a great beer that meets the hype!"
"Drinkability is over the top here. I could and would drink this more often if it were possible. Between the rarity and cost this is a rare treat for me. I did enjoy it greatly. If you get your hands on this one and you like coffee you will love this."
"I was a bit confused at first due to a label change - my bottle was only designated ""KBS."" Pour was an amazing, thick used-motor oil black (only a beer geek could find that description appetizing). Aroma was dense with caramel, oak and vanilla. First few sips were almost overpowering, with a silky-sweet dark caramel, tinged wiht bourbon. Alcohol hit hard at the end, with an off-putting rubbing alcohol burn. As the beer warmed and I acclimated to the flavor, the sharp pepper of the alchol diminished, but never went away. The imbalance of the alcohol was the only detraction from an otherwise outstanding beer."
"Recommended for any beer drinker even if you don't drink stouts because it's awesome. Complex, flavorful, delicious, even refreshing which is odd to say."
"Overall, this is a far superior beer to the standard breakfast stout, and one of my favorite beers to boot. Aging this has really improved it. Awesome stuff."
"The special additions and ingredients really shine. Layers of chocolate and dark roasted coffee with a little cream and infused with subtle but noticeable bourbon. I really really like how the bourbon isn't overpowering like it is in GI BCS. Hints of vanilla hide within the bourbon flavors, but want to be noticed. No hop bitterness. Even the coffee doesn't add much bitterness. Fairly sweet all the way through. Nice warming sensation from the alcohol. Rich, velvety and creamy. My only complaint, not enough roasted malt flavors. A sipper, but with the alcohol pretty well covered, a possibly dangerous one."
"drank on: 04.24.09"
"The pour is absolutely amazing, wonderfully dark with a minimal head brown head that slowly rises. Smells very strongly of oak and coffee, and a little bit of dark chocolate. Taste is not quite exceptional but great nonetheless, reflecting the smell with a subtlety of bourbon that adds complexity. Its silky smooth and tastes almost frothy, but the carbonation in my bottle was almost nonexistent. Its a wonderfully tasty beer (moreso than the wonderfully boozy BCS), but I couldn't fathom having more than one of these in a session."
"D: I could drink this beer all night. It goes down great; the flavor leaves you wanting more."
"D- If you can handle the bourbon and like stouts this is for you. So smooth and well balanced and maintains a great complexity."
"Tastes like Quick with a little smoke. OK, not quite so sweet. But pretty close. Ah, OK, it's bitter, too."
"This is a drinkable beer. Very complex. Watch out for the ABV as the most recent batch is 11.2 percent."
"This is a well crafted beer. I like it much more than FBS but I am unsure if this beer warrants all the hype, especially given its high tariff. I give Central Waters Peruvian Morning the nod over KBS."
"I have a few bottles, so I am glad I will get to revisit this beer, as it was completely unimpressive looking, but such an amazing, great flavor."
"Cheers!"
"D: Enjoyable. A real treat to drink. High ABVs would keep my lightweight ass away from downing more than 3 in a sitting, but a very good sipping brew. I guess I am still blown away by Goose Islands BCS."
"edit: and with this beer I retire this glass..."
"Overall this one lives up to the hype. A really nicely balanced stout with that extra kick of the bourbon barrel really complimenting and enhancing the flavor in all the right ways."
"The woody, oak-y, and coffee aromas and flavors are the standouts here, and according to the gentleman who brought this to me, it's among the last of its kind. Too bad, I want more."
"I fancy myself a cynic and a skeptic when it comes to beers as hyped and talked-about as this one, but it won me over in the end. A quite delicious brew that melds its flavors beautifully. Sip and savor. While I shall refrain from gushing endlessly about its merits, this is a beer that won't disappoint, provided you like some coffee flavor in your brew."
"Overall, a great beer. I just tend to prefer a bit less coffee and a bit more bourbon, so hopefully laying these down for a little while will help with that."
"Served: in a tulip glass."
"Trying my favorite beer on tap at the Founder's brewpub. Served in an 8 oz. snifter. Board says 10% ABV. Appearance is oily black with a thin tan head. Smells of the barrel and charred wood, coffee, chocolate, maple syrup, and alcohol. Tastes are dominated by chocolate and coffee bitterness. Very smooth mouthfeel, almost a little syrupy. Very drinkable, but keep it slow because of the high ABV. An exceptional beer!"
"The taste is totally different though, the first thing I'm getting is smooth oak, vanilla, and bourbon flavors followed by the bitterness of the coffee. This stuff is superbly balanced nothing really overpowering just tons of awesome flavors all perfectly blended. Mouthfeel is spot on very smooth and creamy and it goes down nice easy. Amazing stuff, wish I could have gotten some more of this stuff."
"Excellent beer! Very reminiscent of what I expect out of a stout. It has the bitterness that I initially learned to love drinking Guiness. Of course, I do believe this beer is much better than Guiness, but I as my introduction to the style, I always compare stouts to Guiness. The taste was very complex with that sense of bourbon barrel aging. Not as sweet as most imperial stouts I've had and it makes this beer much more tasty and more drinkable. Maybe the coffee helps calm the sweetness. Overall, this is a beer I will seek out again, probably the best imperial stout I have ever had."
"All in all Founder's never ceases to amaze me with their beers. My roommate on the other hand never ceases to amaze me with his chugging skills when he doesn't like a beer."
"A great beer for a special occasion and potentially the best stout I've ever had."
"Overall, an American-made masterpiece, and I can't wait to see how this ages."
"After coming up empty handed in my search for this brew, I was delighted that Greg at the Trion had secured a few for his frequent customers to try. Poured an intimidating dark red, almost black with a milky chocolate head that retained forever. Aroma was bourbon, coffee, chocolate and roast malts and it was good. Same with the taste, this is a monster of a beer. Dense and chewy, with all those stout flavors amped up to an incredible level. As it warmed the tastes continued to change with coffee, bourbon, and the malts being front and center at different times during the experience. It was a little sweet and I can't imagine having more then one of these. Honestly, to me, I like the Founders Breakfast Stout a little better, just because I find it more drinkable. If I had to have just one more sip of a Founders Stout, this would be the one, but if I was to have one to go back to over and over again, the breakfast stout would take the day."
"thank you HIGHPA"
"Even pouring it straight down the center of the glass there's close to zero head and, as one would expect, no lacing either. Completely black, seems to be the ""look"" these sort of beers seek. The bourbon inspired vanilla, caramel evident from the first sniff, the nose also features espresso bean, prunes and black raisins, there's a slight suggestion of flowers but this may very well be more diverse bourbon-inspired scents. Full-bodied, here the trademark Founders smooth carbonation comes in to help you breathe in the face of its sheer density and mass. Avalanche of roasted coffee, bitter dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla bean and burnt grains, followed on by black licorice, orange glaze. There is a noticeable alcoholic burn but it only distracts in a minor fashion. The prune, plum, raisin fruit a touch buried here. As you'd expect, you'd need a hose to wash this out of your mouth, long finish not close to describing it. A testament to intensity and depth more than to complexity."
"D-10% ABV---who cares! Bourbon infused chocolate coffee....d'uh, how could this get much better? A sinfully delicious beverage that most certainly could get me into serious trouble. Plus, to have it on nitro, nice touch Brass Rail. As far as I know only the Founders pub also served it this way!"
"Overall, this is a very complex beer and I can see why it's rated so high though if you're not a coffee fan (I'm not) then it may not totally be for you."
"I am consistently impressed by Founders and, while this is no different, it goes to the top of the list in my opinion."
"I have been saving trying this one for a month or so. Easter was the day. Poured a very dark black with no head. Definite whisky nose with some coffee. Great flavor, coffee, chocolate. Very thick mouthfeel. Was a sipper for sure and I think one at a time is enough. Thats good for me since I paid so much for it. Great RIS!"
"This is a great beer. Well worth the 5 hour drive to get a case. Funny though, I remember previous years relieving my neuralgia."
"For comparisons sake, I found the younger bottle of KBS much less ""Kentucky"" than Breakfast Stout."
"D - I really like this beer, but that's the difference between this and some other top notch imperial stouts I've tried. This beer makes me want another sip, but at the same time leaves me wanting more. I actually enjoy the regular Breakfast Stout a lot more."
"I'm not a big fan of hype. I've sought out beer after beer, only to be let down and depressed. This is not the case here. This one is worth it. I'm about 5 ounces in, and I've got a nice warming feeling going on. I can't wait to try one of these in a year or two, although I seriously doubt that I will be able to wait that long. Cheers!"
"Notes from a 2010 bottle: A bit more oak and bourbon in the flavor, and it seems a bit more mellow. Nice nice. I don't think this years is as thick, no need to change it's scores, but very nice overall. Glad I picked up this years model. 4-7-2010"
"drinkability: i'm not sure if i could drink an entire 4-pack in one sitting due to the complexity of this brew. but i really enjoy this. this is an ideal brew to have while sitting inside on a cold, snowy night. no doubt if i'm able to get this one again i11 will not hesitate to pull the trigger. yummy!!"
"Overall, fantastic. I don't care for the roast coffee bitterness that lingers, and there is a little too much alcohol warmth, but those are minor criticisms to an otherwise amazing beer."
"wow, everything I thought it would be and more. no need to go into the fine details, you can read that amongst the other reviewers. buy this beer if you get the chance. i thought $5.95 a 12 ounce bottle was a bit steep and though I will not buying cases anytime soon, worth every drop. buy for a special occassion. not sure if i will be able to keep my second one for another 6 months. drink up"
"d: Surprisingly easy to drink given the ABV."
"Drinkability - Such an exquisite beer, but one that could take quite some time to throw back if you were to drink the whole bottle yourself. I shared mine, and it was more than enough. What a beer! I've got four more to drink as well! This one is best enjoyed if you kick back, sip it, and let the whole experience wash over you."
"Drinkability: The drinkability is high. This is everything its advertised as. Its definitely packing the bourbon punch. This is not for the casual beer drinker. Actually this beer is way to harsh for most people. It's extremely unique and oh so tasty, but you better split it with a friend. Either that or do not operate heavy machinary after drinking. This beer will knock you on your ass."
"This is a very complex brew, as any RIS, eisbock or barley wine could be. A brilliant beer that must be experienced."
"D: This beer is good as a sipper. I dotn think I would enjoy more than 1 in a sitting. Overall I feel this is a good beer but not worth the price tag. I bought a few extra bottles and plan on letting them age 6-12months."
"This is such a treat to run across. Got a few bottles at the Buckeye Beer Engine's Wood Aged Beer Festival (all of the stock they had was gone within the first hour). Took a few home, but had one at the bar. The pour is dark black - not as much of the toffee colored head that the non-barrel version has, but a little nonetheless. The nose has a ton of chocolate, with bourbon and vanilla coming to the forefront as the beer warms and relaxes. A bit of coffee roast in there as well. Taste is chocolate, coffee, and the nice bourbon kick. This is heaven - there are other BB stouts I enjoy a bit more, as I am a bourbon in my beer guy, but this is so balanced and smooth. An world class offering from Founders, and a treat that anyone should splurge for if given the chance."
"Drinkability: While it's outstanding, I don't think I'd want to sit through more than one of these in a night. It's a bit heavy (as stouts tend to be, duh...) and the ABV is pretty high. A very nice accompaniment to a desert, or may even just be a great desert on its own."
"The appearance was thick, dark black and almost oily. Poured without much caution straight down into the glass rendered no head, and not more than a few tiny bubbles. The crisp coffee flavor made the brew a bit more drinkable and helped to overcome the extremely thick mouthfeel, as did the refrigeration. I would like to try this at room temperature on Friday if they still have some, to see if that makes a difference."
"I wouldn't purchase this beer again but I'm really glad I had the opportunity to try it. Founder's remains one of my favorite brewers and this is certainly a very well executed beer... just not the one for me. I'll stick to their porter, thank you."
"An excellent offering by Founders. I was expecting this beer to be highly overrated, but I feel that it lives up to the hype."
"This is a fantastic brew but as a friend told me, I suspect it will only get better with 1-2 years on it."
"Drinkability: Definitely drinkable, but not something you can drink mulitple glasses of. You'd be drunk and broke in a short period of time!"
"Overall, one of the finest, if not the finest beers I've ever had."
"Drinkability: this beer goes down really smooth, but at the high alcohol levels it limits you in a session. But this is a treat that should be enjoyed slowly. The high cost will also limit your intake, but it is worth the money for this beer."
"Big and rich in the mouth, full of body yet spirit like with it's high alcohol. The bitterness lingers and the warmness grows long after the swallow. Supremely drinkable...possibly the best bourbon BA Imperial Stout ever. I even prefer it to the also great GI BCS. A must try if this is your style preference. I want more!"
"Overall, I have to say I enjoyed the regular breakfast stout a bit better, probably because it was more easily enjoyable. However, I appreciate this creation and look forward to an aged taste. This is one intense beer."
"Mouthfeel is thick & satisfying, like a drink of boozy brownie. As strong as this is, it's relatively low ABV for a bourbon-barrel stout, & I think I could down two of these in a relaxed, stretched out evening. Dunno if it's the novelty of the style, but I love me some bourbon-barrel stouts! I would put this just behind GIBCS, & this one leads in drinkability."
"I almost don't want to write this review since it will break the 666 number of reviews. There's a reason why this beer seems to be advocated by satan. This is the kind of stuff people leave their families for. My buddy and I accidently stumbled on it in Weymouth, MA after looking for the stuff for weeks. It did not disappoint. It pours like crude oil and has a very warm and inviting smell. The complexity of this beer is through the roof. The bourbon barrels give it a beautiful vanilla taste that's mixed with coffee and chocolate. Although it's thicker than the regular breakfast stout, somehow it's smoother and has a mellow but lingering aftertaste. It's really amazing how this beer can be so mellow and subtle, yet so bold at the same time. I only hope I can find more of this stuff. The ABV was 11.3%, not 10%"
"D - A sipper."
"For what it is, it's nicely drinkable. Still, would take the right set of circumstances to really want to down more than one of these giants."
"The mouthfeel on the beer is thick like motor oil, but this adds to the chocolate flavour that lingers in your mouth. This is a beer that can be sipped on all night long, mainly because the flavour is so balanced. Best beer I've had to date."
"A fantastic stout by any measure. It is even more enjoyable if you love coffee. Personally it falls a little short of the hype. Still worth doing what you can to get your hands on some."
"Drinkability: This is definately a sipper.... but ya gotta try this stuff.... just bite the bullet and go for it. (Was I ripped off at 6 bucks a bottle?). I at least had to do it once. I probably won't beat a path to the beer store to pay $6 a bottle again.... but I HAD TO TRY IT. I was glad I did."
"My guess is that there was some bourbon left in the barrels when the beer was racked into them. Otherwise, I don't see how you get this much bourbon flavor in the beer."
"An understatement to call it a sipper, but really nice over a good long session."
" I had this on tap once again at Founders and was offered a sample of the Canadian Breakfast Stout, aged in Maple Syrup Barrels, and found it to be a great twist on the KBS, though a bit sweeter. Still the best beer in the world, KBS is progressively becoming even better."
"This is a really fantastic beer. I'm glad I was able to try it. That said, one is enough. It's delicious, but it's definitely a slow sipper, and the ABV will keep me from over-indulging. Hopefully I'm able to buy another single or two to share with friends, because, unfortunately, the $20 price tag on a four pack is almost out of the question after already buying three of them."
"I had my brother pick up a four pack at Whole Foods in Ann Arbor and Fed Ex it too me. I was very excited to try this beer. Unfortunately it did not live up to the hype. I'm not saying this is a terrible beer, but I just don't think its as good as advertised. I tasted the bourbon, vanilla, and coffee. The mixture just tasted a bit off to me. I""ll take a Bells Expedition Stout or an Old Rasputin any day over this beer."
"If the opportunity allows you...it is worth the price and effort!"
"Eric"
"This is the fourth time I've had this beer in the past year and I'm consistent impressed (including nitro tap at the brewery)."
"Now excuse me while I head over to Applebee's and order a mudslide."
"2009 bottle poured into a Chimay snifter. Pours rich dark color with no head. The smell is full of fresh ground coffee, nice and aromatic. The taste is like no other, best way I can describe it is take a mild IPA, and mix it with an iced coffee, with a smoked wood overtone. This beer is so thick you can nearly chew it. Drinkability is not exceptional for one reason, high ABV and smooth taste, can be a dangerous combination."
"Drinkability: Definitely a sipper, the coffee and raw alcohol are overpowering."
"Drinkability: This is surely a ""sip slowly and savor the hell out of it"" beer. For stout lovers, this is that dusty little wooden cup hidden among all the jeweled chalices. Shamelessly drinkable. Just watch yourself, or you will get sucked into the black hole of intoxication. Which is probably almost as dark as this beer."
"Pours a thick black syrup. Chocolate, coffee and bourbon flavors are perfectly balanced. Alcohol falls just short of overpowering. I doubt my craving for this beer will ever stop. Reminds me of when I had my ""aha"" moment with an IPA. I went on a hop binge for years. I think I maybe on the verge of a similiar bourbon stout binge."
"Pours a viscous inky jet black with very little burnt tan head. Smells of bourbon, vanilla, caramel, molasses, chocolate, and coffee. Tastes of caramel and dark chocolate up front then some coffee and roasted malt character. To follow is some vanilla and bourbon warmth then an espresso bean finish. Full in body with low carbonation. Silky smooth with a nice thick chewiness and a soothing bourbon warmth that compliments the other flavors and doesn't become too overpowering. A fantastic brew, but a little too much to want to enjoy often. Definitely worth breaking out for special occasions though."
"Quite good, but I think this one needs some age to balance it out a bit."
"I'm thrilled to have had this wonderful beer and look forward to more opportunities in the future."
"A nice offering from Founder's, but I am frankly a bit disappointed. As a sucker for bourbon-aged stouts, I expected a bit more out of this one. I particularly would have liked the barrels to mellow a bit of the roasted coffee flavor, but it wasn't to be. I don't think it holds a candle to my personal favorite, Goose Island Bourbon County Stout."
"Also, I got it right from the source, at Founders, about two weeks after release... pretty cool."
"Taste is a creamy, oaky, roasty, coffee, dark chocolate colaboration. Very well crafted, as the ABV is not noticable. Mouthfeel is very thick and smooth. Drinkable as hell."
"Poured a deep, deep brown with a small tannish head. Nose is coffee, cocoa, light hints of bourbon, vanilla, oak and oats. taste is heavy oats, coffee but light on cocoa and bourbon. Very tasty and very, very drinkable. Outstanding beer and well worth a try."
"Overall, KBS has changed form last year. I think the bourbon comes out more adding a different dimension. However, this is a marvelous beer that I enjoyed till the last drop."
"Drinkability is as good as it gets on this beer. I had heard this was one of the best beers available (or somewhat available), but I had no idea how smooth and drinkable it would be. There is a ton of taste and a lot of alcohol in this beer, but none of it overwhelms the drinker at any point. If you can get your hands on one, pay any price to at least try it once."
"Notes from 3/15/09. A super dark black color body with a single finger of brown colored head,lots of lacing left behind. Aroma of espresso beans,burbon,and chocolate.Flavor up front is charred malt,burbon,and chocolate then some notes of wood smoke,tobacco,vanilla and black licorice.Little to no carbonation,a slick slightly oily/creamy mouthfeel with a bitter finish and boozy aftertaste.I would not call this sessionable I guess but very good.For the money and the mess around to get this, I think I like the regular Breakfast Stout a little better than this."
"Drank at room temp. Pours jet black with dark fudge brown head. Lots of lacing. Strong coffee scent in the nose, can't smell any bourbon however. Taste is exceptional, coffee, dark chocolate, hints of bourbon. Perfectly balanced. Alcohol very hidden. Maybe my second favorite stout, it didn't floor me like Kate the Great did."
"Had this on tap at Old Town Ale House is Fishers. Thanks to Matt for getting a keg of this! The beer looked like an oil slick with melted chocolate in it. Very dark, but slightly creamy looking. Very thin head due to 5 oz. pour. Smells strongly of coffee and has slight bourbon hints. The strongest taste is the coffee/espresso flavor. It's a warm punch in the face. At the back of the taste comes the more pointed bourbon flavor. It's lovely. Some vanilla flavor as well ties this stout up quite well. The mouthfeel is amazing. Chews slightly and goes down smoothly. Drinkability is good due to it being a liquid, but more over it is very smooth. Hidden high ABV will knock the crap out of you though."
"D: Very drinkable, even at this abv. It is an amazing beer and I wish we could get this up here in CT. I would recommend it to anyone."
"2008 vintage with the old label and 10%ABV. I'm pretty sure I picked this up at Jessup Beverage Center. Taken out of the DBF and allowed to warm up for about 45 minutes. Poured from a 12 ounce stubby bottle into my Duvel tulip glass. I poured about 3/4 of the bottle, swirled up the yum-yums from the bottom of the bottle, and vigorously poured the remaining few ounces into the snifter. Appears a deep, dark, opaque blackish brown color with a solid two fingers of creamy dark ecru head. The head fades in about two minutes down to a 1/4 inch layer leaving a nice lace on the glass. Smells of bourbon soaked cocoa powder, vanilla beans, molasses, a touch of roasted coffee, and oak/wood. Tastes of bitter baking chocolate squares, smooth bourbon, black coffee, cocoa powder, vanilla, caramelized malts, a bit more bourbon, dark chocolate, and mocha. I'll admit, I was expecting this to be truly full bodied. It didn't seem it to me. It was still rich and satisfying, but just didn't seem as thick as I was hoping for. Medium in carbonation. Alcohol is completely hidden at this point. I prefer ""regular"" Breakfast Stout once or twice a month. I'll save the KBS for a ""every few months"" treat to enjoy, sip and savor over the course of an hour or so."
"Thank You Founders"
"pours completely dark ,,,no light through it...solid middle finger worth of tannish head that dissapates to a halo around the glass...smells of dark mocha coffee and bourbon..wows..almost tickles the nostrils...the taste changes as the glass settles and warms..offering dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malts and fruits followed by that warm bourbon rush...leaves your mouth wanting more..probably a good thing this is so limited as i could see how this would be incredibly addicting!!"
"Pours a thick, midnight black with one-finger almost brown head and some lace. Coffee notes along with oak/wood dominate the smell. Also some bourbon, burtn malts and some residual sweetness in the smell (bitter chocolate, caramel). A mix of coffee and burnt malts and oak/wood lead to a dryish feeling w/ this beer, but overall it is smooth and creamy with a sweet taste thanks to the chocolate and vanilla in there. Even a hint of hops in the backend, although this beer is about the malts. The 10% ABV is not overpowering but instead compliments the beer as it lets it warm the tongue and prickles the tongue on the backend. A quick sipper, b/c I noticed as I took my time the beer started to get a little dryer. An excellent stout nonetheless."
"Thus far, whenever I have gotten the opportunity to try one of the beers in the BA top 25 or so, I have tended to be let down because of the hype surrounding the beer. With KBS though, there is no let-down this is honestly one of the best beers, if not the best beer I have ever had."
"This beer pours like motor oil (in a good way!)This is dark! Loaded with fantastic flavors & notes of coffee, chocolate, bourbon and vanilla. my mouth was watering just watching it pour. The warmer this gets, the better it is. Pour this baby into a beautiful snifter and let it slowly warm while enjoying it all the way through. Don't confuse your palet by having too many hoppy beers prior to enjoying this one. Stick with malty selections for the evening. Bravo! (Although I'm not crazy about them having to change it's name. This is still America right?)"
"I think I like this years version slightly better than last years, but overall they're not as different as some people seem to be claiming. I'm loving the coffee in this one, as the one I had last time was about 9 months old and the coffee had probably faded a bit. I still prefer GI BCS in the barrel aged beer category, but this is certainly one to be reckoned with."
"It's hard to rate KBS' drinkability. On the one hand, this beer is not intended to be a session beer. On the other: is a truly great beer not intended to make you want another one on some level? I can honestly say that, while I enjoyed the KBS I had quite a lot, I did not immediately following its consumption really want another. It was real smooth though, like dark silk gravy."
"If you are within a days drive....hope to see you and Howard there in 2010."
"To sum up this awesome big huge beer i would just like to say...WOW."
"Taste: I was thinking that so far the appearance and smell have failed to live up to the hype but the taste is really amazing. Even a tiny sip gives way to an explosion of flavor. Oak and bourbon are especially dominant on the finish. Bitter dark chocolate provides a nice sweetness."
"You know, this beer is pretty big and bad, but it plays nice. The vanilla and coffee do an excellent job of keeping the booze at bay. With all that going on, it isn't nearly as thick as I would have thought."
"After searching all over the place I finally got a 4 pack of this! Pours a coffee black with a one finger fluffy chocolate milk head. It smells much like oak, coffee, and chocolate. The taste is just insane! It starts off with oak barrels and some bitterness. Then you can taste the coffee, bourbon and malts. It finishes with a hint of chocolate and vanilla. The after taste is a mix between chocolate milk and coffee. This is incredible! The mouthfeel is thick and chewy. It laces the throat on the way down. No wonder this is in the top 10 beers in the world. KBS is just.. (near) perfect. Drinkability, I couldn't have too many of these in a row (and wouldn't want to due to the price OUCH), but I wish I had these around all year long. Kentucky Breakfast Stout is an amazing beer."
"Edit 2010: Drove up to GR for the release, luckily my girlfriend jumped out of the truck & got in line as I got the second to last case. In conscience I couldn't buy the last two cases even though friend was disappointed. Totally worth the trip, KBS on nitro is a dream."
"This is like Barry White - wayyy too smooth for its weight class. For such a high-octane ABV wallop it primes the pump very nicely. Enjoy!"
"Cheers"
"Notes: delicious, powerful stout. pretty intense booziness but not too distracting. great beer, but the mystique lay in its limited availability"
"As for drinkability, the high abv, price, and availability keep this from being a 5. I could actually drink this all day, every day, if I had the money and founders had the production."
"a really superb beer."
"Note: so after the initial tasting, I sat on a couple 4 packs and tried another last night, wondering if a bit of the vanilla had mellowed out. I'm glad I did. Not nearly as cloying as I remember, and after only a few months of aging, the vanilla has mellowed out and blended with the bourbon. Much more balance and harmony. Still, this is on the sweeter side for a stout but much improved over the super fresh version. My advice would be to stick this right in the cellar when you buy it and age for maybe 6 months or even a year if you are patient before you try it. For what it's worth..."
"Overall: I enjoyed this so much more on tap than I did from a bottle. This is a truly unique and delicious AIS."
"KBS is creamy-firm and full-bodied with mild carbonation and plenty of belly-warming booze. It's a wonderful sipper and a truly magnificent beer, but ho-hum-- I'm no longer suprised by anything Founders puts out-- it's all f*cking magnificent and thus it's nearly boring as all hell to keep stroking their egos... stroke, stroke, stroke.... ;)"
"A fantastic beer which I wish was easier to get a hold of. I will drink this at any opportunity in which it presents itself."
"Overall - this is a unique and complext beer. I will keep sipping on it as it warms up, and it is a very good beer."
"Overall, this is a fascinating beer. There are so many dimensions to the flavors and smells. Bourbon stouts are not my favorite style, however this is exceptionally done. It is quite expensive at about $5 a bottle, but I am glad I have tried this."
"Notes: And I thought the BS was amazing, I had no idea a concoction like this existed. Do yourself a favor....Get yourself some KBS!!!"
"I LOVED this beer, not much if any hop profile but extreme on the malt taste!"
"12 oz bottle served into a snifter. This beer pours motor oil black with a very nice chocolate head. The aroma consists of coffee, bourbon, dark fruit and oak. The flavor follows the smell. The initial taste is bourbon and then it is followed with coffee and chocolate. The carbonation is just right and not overpowering. This beer is fantastic and deserves all the praise it gets. This is a must get for anyone."
"I highly recommend this beer to anyone who likes a big stout."
"D: KBS is gonna lose some points here. Don't get me wrong, it tastes great. But the price/availability/abv are going to prevent me from having more than one of these at a time."
"Drinkability: Complexity is the key word here. This beer gets better with every sip, I wish it wouldn't end. Oh, I just remembered...I have another bottle..."
"Drinkability: A complex and tasty stout. The bourbon is very hidden in this one, which is fine by me. I enjoy the flavors of oak and bourbon: vanilla, cherry, etc., but not the overly alcoholic taste. This one has a bite in the finish form its higher ABV, but not too bad. I imagine that would fade with time."
"D - Very complex beer that grows with each taste. A fine way to end the week. Darius75 has is right...A true gentleman's stout. Very glad to taste my first KBS."
"Smelled of coffee, chocolate and oak. Taste was similar but more rich. Through the coffee, chocolate and oak there was a hnit of the bourbon as well, making this very deep in flavors. Mouthfeel was very thick and rich. I almost wanted to chew it. Very impressive. Drinkability, in terms of drinking more than one is not good, as this is an ABV monster that quickly went to my head, despite it's deliciousness. This one is best as a nightcap, or with dessert, not as a session drink."
"D: This is an incredibly well-balanced brew that goes down easy, unlike flavored stouts (coffee, chocolate, bourbon, or straight-up oak) in which the specialty flavor dominates too fiercely. This is a true gentleman's brew. If only they released it more than once a year."
"D - A pleasure from start to finish. I enjoyed this even more than Breakfast Stout - I think the component flavors are much better integrated here. Definitely a beer that lives up to the hype."
"D: Very drinkable for the style and ABV. It's a shame I was only able to pick up two bottles--hopefully I can scrounge some more up somewhere else."
"My tongue just took a KBS bath and now feels like a million bucks. This beer has so much flavor I think I'll still be tasting this beer in a week."
"Tastes reminiscent of Breakfast Stout, but with a boozy bourbon background and a dollop of vanilla. Burn evident as beer warms, but deiselness noticed more in the warmth that spreads through the body than the actual taste."
"Black coffee with a thick finger of badass dark foam. The nose is roasted coffee, oak, vanilla and bourbon with chocolate malt. The taste mirrors the smell but with the bourbon coming more to the forefront. Rich and chocolatey flavors blend perfectly with bittering hops. Big and viscous it pours like motor oil and coats the mouth. The complexity grows with each sip. A world class beer, one of the best."
" This is in fact one of the best stouts i've tasted and i'm glad i got to sample one."
"This beer is exceptionally drinkable, I am extremely impressed by Founders yet again for their ability to produce such fine examples of ambrosia. This beer definitely lives up to the hype, even when its this young...I can't imagine how well it will age...In a few years, this beer will be nothing short of amazing, but even now it is magnificent."
"This is a one and done beer for me. Whereas with FBS I can knock back two or three in a sitting, this beer is a doozy with such boozy goodness. Highly recommended, unless you don't like bourbon or coffee-then stay away from this beer and perhaps you should consider how it is you live."
"Drinkability: This beer is dangerous. It tastes very good, and the alcohol is only evident in the aftertaste - not nearly as much of a sipper as I thought it would be. Very glad I had the opportunity to pick up a few bottles of this."
"This is the best beer I have had thus far. For me it has surpassed the hype. I imagine only the Saints in Heaven are drinking anything better."
"Drinkability: Highly delicious and a special treat, but I have satisfied my curiosity for the moment. You'll never see me kicking this one out of my glass though."
"This beer was incredible. Just as you are ready to say that it is tied with regular Breakfast Stout, just different, you realise how delicious the bourbon flavor really is, and how much it adds by being obviously present in the aroma and taste, but without the alcohol taste to spoil it. And KBS is ridiculously drinkable. Definitely could creep up on you. Enjoy!"
"Additionally: Does it live up to the hype? Yes. Definitely one to seek out if you're an Imperial Stout fan."
"This is the best double stout I have had sans aging flat out. There is no need to cellar this to get what you are expecting. I have several to age, but I'm guessing this will be one that does not change much from age. The Alesmith stouts are the only others I've had that can equal this without age."
"After waiting many months for this beauty to arrive in NC, I was not disappointed. Awesome. Founders continues to impress me with their beers, this being the best yet."
"I'm forgoing the usual format to simply say that this is exquisite. If there is such a thing as ""perfect"" this is it. What else could I possibly add to the legions who think of this as one of the greatest achievements in beerdom? Simply amazing."
"D: Simply delicious. 'Nuff said."
"First flavors are chocolate-y, candied. Lighter than expected. Good Lord, is it good. Complex maltiness, kind of like a fine wine, many threads of flavor which melt together easily. Notes of mellow vanilla. Makes me want experiment with old bourbon...someday. Finishes easy-easy. Slides down the palate like mercury and then keeps on giving. Really too excited to give real due to this fine, fine beer. Founders knocks it out again! Thanks!"
"Very interesting brew. Havnt had anything in comparison to this in a long time."
"At $6.00 a beer, I was a little nervous of being let down. Luckily, this beer is as exceptional as everyone on here speaks of. It is amazing."
"All in all, just about the perfect beer from my perspective. Hard to imagine that this one can get better. Seek it out and enjoy it. It IS that good. Can't wait to try this year's."
"D: With a high APV, couldn't session this one, but the nitro makes it feels much lighter and more manageable then the KBS out of the bottle. I like this version of KBS. A nice twist that might be better than the original? This version does make it more drinkable. KBS is such a huge beer that even though it lost a little with the nitro frothiness, it still is a monster."
"It pours out pitch black, with a thin head. It fades a bit, leaving swirls of bubbles and leaves little bits of lace all the way down. Looks about like what I'd expect, but a bigger head would've really made me fall in love. The smell, it can't get any better. First you get wood, just wonderful wood, mixed in with a brilliant bourbon smell, a bit of alcohol. Then there's the coffee, roasted a bit burnt, but very nice. Then you really smell vanilla and chocolate, BIG vanilla sometimes, and really beautiful dark chocolate others. I mean, there's nothing else I could ask for, and the best part, the very best part, is every time I put my face up to the glass, there's something new, and something great. The taste is wonderful, just like the smell. It's totally different from the average stout, but everything is there. First you get a very woody, earth coffee taste, like bourbon mixed with fresh brewed coffee. Then comes the vanilla, and its very nice as it sweetens, and is almost creamy like good vanilla ice cream, and finishes like a very smooth dark chocolate bar, and just a bit of an alcohol after burn. But the alcohol mostly warms. The mouthfeel is just perfect, smooth and creamy, with infinite complexity. I was just fascinated at every sip, and couldn't put it down. I wouldn't put it down under any circumstances, and is possible the greatest drinker at 10% I've ever had. Really incredible. Really, really incredible. You must find it and taste it. This is exactly what everyone should shoot for if making a bourbon barrel aged stout."
"M - Just thinner than medium bodied with a syrupy viscosity to it, and a little crispness from the carbonation."
"I rated this beer only as a 4 for drinkability, because with any beer with 10% ABV, this is just not possibly sessionable. And after more than one you couldn't really taste or appreciate anything else from the KBS tastebud assault"
"It just doesn't get much better then this."
"Worthy of lots of praise and up there on my favorites, but I don't quite think it lives up to the hype. Top 20 yes, top 5 I would debate"
"Much smoother after the year has passed, the vanilla on the nose is much stronger and the bourbon heat has become much sweeter. I think I would raise the rating on this if you could get ahold of an older, well aged bottle!"
"I sampled this beer at the 4th annual Michigan Brewer's Guild Beer Festival in Comstock Park at the Fifth/Thirsd Ballpark. This lovely beer was served to me in na a 6 ounce clear plastic cup. It was blackish and retained a head of hickory-colored large bubbles. It was thick and delicious with low carbonation and had motor oil-like qualities... In a good way. It was rich like a heavy burnt oatmeal milkshake. It was semi-sweet like a Hershey's Special Dark chocolate bar but also had bitterness and slightly smokey heavy overtones. It was God Damn delicious. I wish I had more than 6 ounces. Sort of viscous and fatiguing to drink in any kind of quantity."
"Overall- This may be the best stout I have had to date. It is extremely complex with an amazing mouth feel and drinkability that should not be able to be attained by an Imperial Stout. Find this beer, Drink this beer."
"Cheers brother, this stuff is effing great!"
"I can unequivocally credit this beer (with the help of one of my friends) as the catalyst that truly started my craft beer experience. Call me biased, but I love this beer. World class. Enough said."
"This is good but I still prefer OPS and Homewood Reserve when it comes to barrel aged beers. Very complex but even after a year of laying down a tad too hot."
"This bad boy pours an absolutely beautiful jet black motor oil with a thin dark brown head that exhibits intermittent shades of burgundy and purplish tints. Nice lacing on my glass and a fair amount of crabonation bubbles as well. The scent is overwhelming with the bourbon but upon swirling the complexities come out. Although this scent reminds me of my Ol' Grandad/Jack Daniels days, I can also detect deep wood, vanilla, coffee and a hint of black pepper. This is truly spicy but also has a mix of syrup and caramel on the initial sip. This turns to mild bitter chocolate and a serious big ass bourbon blast for the finish! mouthfeel is thick, heavy and smooth though not quite creamy. There is no way in hell I would crack a second one of these consecutively, but I do look forward to a time when I can share this with my bourbon afficianado friends!"
"I am so happy to have the opportunity to try this beer. I am hoping that Founders allows some to make it's way to MA in '09... Also glad to have another bottle."
"From the bottle into my Surly pint glass, this one is black with ruby highlights and very little head. Aroma is intense coffee with bourbon, raisin, and faint fusel notes. Powerful smoke and coffee in flavor, in addition to musty, spicy hops. Chocolate and toffee notes appear in the aroma as the beer warms. No real vanilla, this is more of a charred oak, with ash, cola and espresso beans in the flavor. Appropriately thick mouthfeel, but the slightly hot finish hurts drinkability. The oak and coffee might drop out, but it'd be interesting to see how this one ages."
"Awesome! Overhyped? Nope. Very well-done - a great sipper!"
"d: a good american double that is amazingly sweet and complex for a stout with such high abv"
"Now i just need to get this founder's Imperial Stout to get the full spectrum of this brewery's darker selections."
"M/D - Full as can be and incredibly smooth. There is a slight alcohol burn but nothing overwhelming. Incredibly good stout that makes for an excellent evening sipper."
"D_For once the emperor wears clothes and they are of the finest fabric. What a truly tremendous beer. Well done and delicious."
"Drinkability: I am not always a stout person, but I find this excellent for its style. It is what I will reach for in its style..There are lots of layers here..A very complex beer...I could have several"
"Sit back and enjoy everything that winter can throw at you with this beer. Mmm...nice."
"Pours out a deep oily black, with a dark mocha head that slowly fizzles. This sucker has real legs. Looks fantastic. Smells of burnt coffee, molasses, oak and bourbon, and charred malts. Very nice. Taste is heavily roasted malts that transition into smoky bourbon. Some slight alcohol, but mostly just toasty flavors. Mouthfeel is good but it doesn't feel as thick as it looks. Good drinkability as long as you take your time."
"Very good winter brew."
"D - Not really. Not found in Minnesota. Also, because of the high alcohol content, a sipper at best. Just not my favorite."
"D- This is a decent stout, and one I have been looking for for awhile. It is also only my 2nd bourbon stout. It was an honor to try it and if I see it around I will pick it up and age it, but its a little too hot with alcohol for my tastes. Good overall, but there are much better stouts out there."
"I was disapoined as this beer is rated so highly and i find other of the same style to be much better."
"D-It's always tough reviewing these beers that are so highly rated as you can come into it expecting too much....I don't think that is the case here....I think this is a nice tasting imperial coffee stout with very subtle bourbon barrel aged qualities....very subtle...i wish they were more pronounced but there is no question this is a quality brew...I won't seek it out again though and overall this is overrated in my opinion (but not bad).."
"Alcohol is very present, very high ABV, warming, loved this beer and the strong bourbon character"
"D- VERY DRINKABLE!"
"Pours black in colour with very thin coffe&cream colour head which dissapeared almost immediately. Smell - dark chocolate, coffee, alcohol. Taste. Well, this is the first American Imperial Stout I liked. In fact I loved it. Pretty similar to the aroma, alcohol is more hidden, coffee stands out even more, Very complex, smooth, rich, very well balanced. Drinkability is very good for the style. Great beer, thanks a lot to Viggo for this one!"
"Drinkability: The taste really improves as it warms, but I can see how this would really knock me on my ass if I drank too much. I don't see myself drinking more than 2 of these in a night for two reasons: 1.) I can't buy the stuff where I live and 2.) The taste is so rich that I don't think I could handle more than a few."
"Drinkability: Warming ABV takes you where you want to be. This is a fantastic sipper (but FW12 is better)."
"There's some debate between this beer and the GI BCS, I think this one is the winner for me. Too bad I can't get this in California."
"D - This is a great beer but as far as drinkability I don't think I could really drink more than just one with out getting a good buzz but it does taste excellent and is worth hunting down to try"
"Overall, this is one hell of a beer. It's right up there with some of the best I have had to date. Thanks again Brent! Highly recommended. Can't wait until March to pick up some four packs of this."
"Pours nearly black, with some dark brown highlights around the edges, tiny mocha-colored head rises slowly and fades into a thin collar around the beer. Lots of dark chocolate in the nose, spicy bourbon, some black coffee laced with vanilla. Taste follows the nose, some espresso/burnt coffee, some alcohol heat. Really creamy mouthfeel, some belly-warming alcohol, lots of long-lasting coffee/espresso aftertaste. It's delicious, and I need more."
"This beer absolutely floored me, it lives up to the hype. An outstanding beer with all my favorite flavors. Do not pass up a chance to try this treat."
"Bottle brought out as a surprise during Founders event at South Philadelphia Taproom. And what a surprise it was! Pours pitch black with thin coffee colored head. Excellent aroma which is dominated by bourbon and oak but not too much so that you cant't detect the chocolate and roasted coffee. I smelled this beer for several minutes before sampling it. This beer is very smooth considering it's complexity and ABV. Lots of bourbon and oak flavor, roasted coffee maltiness, vanilla, chocolate candi sugar and caramel. Excellent!"
"Simply put, this is one seriously dangerous beer. It is as earthy as can be, it's a coffee addicts alcoholic dream, and the bourbon and oak component gives it a unique and home style feel. The crafting that goes into this brew is apparent every step of the way. While the ABV is very big and bold, the parts come together to lend an eminent drinkability, and therein lies the danger to the unwary. And I dare anyone who loves this style to have just one. I tried, and failed with a huge smile on my face. I made a beeline to be able to try it the first time. Now I'll make a beeline to get it any time I can in the future."
"I had this on tap at High Street Grill. The beer was served in a large wine glass, pithc black in appearance with a larger than expected tan head. The beer left wondeful layers of lacing. This is best smelling beer I had ever had. Mild coffee flavorings are the predominat smell. There is also mild undertone of Knob Creek, the combination is like a shot in your morning coffee. The taste is more complex and subtle than the smell. There is coffee, bourbon, chocolate all in perfect balance. The finish is crisp with a wonderfull aftertaste. A full bodied beer that hides its 10% ABV well, making it easy to drink. I will seek this one out again."
"Overall: There are so many big stouts that just taste awful to me. Often they have a soy flavor or way too much licorice or anise, but Founders has found such a great flavor combination in both this beer and their regular breakfast stout. This is one of few big stouts that I can enjoy. It's good all around. It doesn't make me want to a run out and get as much as I can but a real stout lover might really find this a 4.5+."
"No reason to hold. Very very small hints of oxidation already."
"Why, oh why, do I not live somewhere where I can purchase this? I could drink it all winter."
"D- The 10% ABV is very well-hidden, and this beer is pretty light on the stomach for a barrel-aged stout. I felt like I could easily have two of these in a sitting."
"Exceptional stuff."
"D- this one has earned the hype. id love to be able to have several of these in a sitting. i should consider myself lucky to have picked this one off the shelf today! check this one out if you get the chance."
"Great beer, but not an everyday event."
"Cheers"
"Notes from and tasted on 8/2/06."
"If and when you see buy as much as you can, but be nice about letting your friends in on this beautiful gem of a stout!!!"
"Overall, this is a tremendously wonderful beer, but I wouldn't put it in my all-time favorites."
"Very hard pour, dropped into my 22 oz. tulip. Black creamy pour, that produced a huge reverse cascading head. Nice mocha colored head, that leaves great lacing. I can smell the alcohol in the barrel. I get big vanilla with bourbon in the nose. This beer is complex, nice blend of wood, bourbon, chocolate/vanilla and coffee as it warms. Much better as it warms. I can't belive this is 10 ABV. I love this beer. Thank you Bernie."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer and an excellent beer to drink with some eggs and steak"
"I do still enjoy this. Though I think there is a lot more bitter, and almost acrid coffee grounds in the nose that detracts for me. Much more bitter coffee flavor as well. All things that were absent from a couple of years ago. Still very good, and worth seeking out if you have the means. Though it has changed a little in the years that I first had it."
"DK: This is the closest challenger to the unbelievable barrel aged stouts that Town Hall puts out occasionally. This is damn close. Just not quite there with the Czar Jack and the even more impressive barrel aged oatmeal stout they put out a few years ago. But this one really has great character and flavor and drinkability. I now understand the high accolades this beer receives."
"The perfect beer for my 50th review. This beer pours syrupy black with a frothy creamy head that quickly disappears . Smells of huge coffee/espresso flavors, dark chocolate and molasses. Taste of coffee, bourbon and chocolate. The mouthfeel has a medium body and is creamy and smooth, not as thick as I expected but very smooth. This is the most drinkable high abv beer I have had to date. Truly an exceptional stout!"
"Thanks again Derek."
"Absolutely incredible. Nectar of the gods. Beer like this makes me happy I'm alive."
"Overall: worthy"
"This amazing beer pours opaque brown into the awaiting pint glass. No light penetrates through the inky stout. The initial scent is coffee, no qualms about it. Following the dissolving coffee is an underlying cocoa aroma. The taste is so complex its almost perplexing. Again, coffee is in the forefront. Next, in come the chocolate. Its not hidden, its like a punch in the face, almost syrup-like. The alcohol is well hidden. Its only appearance is at the back of the tongue, just before swallowing. This beer cannot be a session beer by definition, unless your session is one or two drinks. I've been looking for Kentucky Breakfast Stout for quite a while. I am so happy to have found this. This is one of the most amazing beers I have ever tasted. Its so absolutely amazing, words can do it no justice."
"Great sippability on this not to be drank quickly as you can tell If I saw this on a shelf I would not pass it by"
"*definate signature taste. very well crafted brew..I personally love it. i would definatly recomend it."
"This is a very special stout and I will have to seek some more out when I'm back in Ohio."
"D: Love this beer! Could drink it forever and ever and ever and ever! Yummy."
"this beer is a challenge not to drink to quickly, without a doubt on my top five favorites."
"Overall: One of the best beers I've had up to this point. Highly recommend."
"This beer is very drinkable, but I don't know if I could drink more than one in a night due to the heaviness in flavor and alcohol content."
"Let me begin, by stating that this is one of the best beers I have ever had. It poured jet black with a small, dark head. Its aroma was that of coffee, vanilla, and a hint of bourbon. I recall remarking on how I hoped that this beer tasted as good as it smelled. And, it did. The taste was also that of coffee and a hint of vanilla. The bourbon was less pronounced than expected and overpowered by the coffee. This ale was exceptionally drinkable, even at 10% ABV. After finishing the beer, I immediately wanted another; however, at $8.50 a bottle (but worth every penny), there was none other to be had. A more than exceptional beer from an outstanding brewery."
"Well, looks like the UPS man is bringing me another box of Powerball goodness. Yes!!"
"pours up black as night with a big brown head. great lacing! the nose is composed of bourbon, dark malts, oak. taste is oh soooo good! magnificent bourbon, delicious chocolate, secret oak, tastey vanilla, warming oatmeal, a little alcohol spice. full as hell body! perfectly aged! drinking this beer with Tara Reid would be a perfect monday. I just don't want this beer to ever end!"
"D: Tasty, and somewhat candy line in some ways. The coffee flavours might be a little on the artificial side, but definitely taste great. I'd happily have it again, though it's almost sinful."
"An excellent beer. This one is good by itself after a nice meal. Truly deserving of the high marks it earns. A must try for any fan of stout."
"Smell: Coffee, bourbon, and chocolate."
"Drinkability: A beer that's not perfect in any way but really damn good in every way. The darkest/best-infused coffee beer I've ever had - the coffee notes do indeed taste both artificial and real at the same time. It's slightly harsh in places, but wonderfully delicate in others. If you like bourbon, if you like coffee, this one's for you. Just a really nice beer."
"Overall, a truly exceptional beer, solidly worthy of its lofty accolades. Thanks again to shbobdb for this terrific beverage. Memorable. Noteworthy."
"Served at cellar temperature, this beer is among the best I've ever had. I didn't think this beer was worth the hype before, but now I know that it exceeds the hype and then some. One of the best Imperial Stouts I've ever had."
"4.5/4.5/4.5/5/4"
"D: The smooth flavor make me want to drink this beer all day long, other then the 10% APV."
"D: maybe two of these, but the 10% really hits you with the high gravity and bourbon flavors. this beer is amazing and I am not sure there is anyone who would not like it."
"The mouth feel is very smooth and this goes down very easily, despite the alcohol content being high it is not offensive and does not hinder the drinkability, a sipper but a real treat for sure."
"Fairly easy to drink for a huge stout, I don't think its quite the masterpeace that the original breakfast stout is, or quite on the same level as Goose Island Bourban Stout, but a really great beer none the less."
"I don't really have much more to say about this one. It is a great beer and it knows it. Not my favorite imperial stout, but that is no knock on it. Be sure to grab all you can if you can ever find this stuff."
"D- A slow sipper"
"Thanks to my main man in Muncie. Bob you RULE"
"Overall, this is an excellent brew. A nice blend of southern goodness with some eye-opening coffee."
"big thank you to stumac for bringing this over!! ..Dispenses into the glass and you immediately smell lots of tar,bourbon, smoked wood, chocolate... complex from the get go .... wow, this has a big bold delicious complex flavour profile ... vanilla, bourbon,smoke flavours ... complex and fuckin wicked stuff ... a joy to drink .. lots of sweet alcohol but it works so wonderfully!! ..been wanting to try this for years and it didn't disappoint..."
"Great if you love bourbon, I dont like it though. Maybe aged it would be better. For me this beer was like the rape scene in deliverance, some people think its a classic, for me it leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
"I found it to be surprisingly un-viscous considering how dark and rich the flavor and appearance are."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Chimay chalice. This baby pours a jet black with a slight dark tan head that left lacing down the glass. The aroma is huge on Bourbon with mild hints of coffee, vanilla, and chocolate but dominated by bourbon. The taste is right up the same alley. The Bourbon really comes through even giving me a little of Whiskey shudders. Coffee is the next big flavor with it really coming out in the finish and coating your mouth with an espresso flavor. The mouthfeel is full and creamy leaving an oily coating the holds the flavors in your mouth. This is a really good stout, but the Bourbon is a bit overwhelming for me. I wonder with age if it mellows a bit or if the bottle I received was mellow and its always that hot."
"What a flavor bomb, lots of bourbon, lots of coffee a bit of vanilla. I find it quite drinkable especially for the ammount of flavor that is there."
"Huge thanks to Saucya for this extra!! Poured into a goblet. Pours a deep black with small tan head. Oily pour. Good aromas of chocolate, roasted malt, coffee and slight bourbon. i was expecting more bourbon or oak. Tastes like it smells. Great finish on this beer. Makes you want to keep sipping. Great full and creamy mouthfeel. Like smooth silk. Extremely drinkable. I would have to give the edge to BCS, though on overall flavor."
"D- Drinkability is very good. Everything about this brew is impressive. Highly recommended."
"it is a very smooth medium body, not nearly as thick as it looks. lots of strong flavors in there. there is a rawness to the coffee flavor that makes it seem more like grounds than beans, not really a bad thing though. theres chocolate and molasses in there too. the more it warms up the bigger the bourbon flavors get huge. the alcohol is slightly warming in the chest but still pretty mellow. very drinkable."
"An amazing stout, its incredible."
"Had this both on draft at the Founder's Brew Pub at the release party and picked up my alloted 2 cases while there. If you are a big bourbon stout fan this one's for you. This is a totally different beer than the regular breakfast stout from Founder's ( one of my favorite craft brewer's). Bourbon is very present both in the nose and taste with a heavy coffee taste mixed in as well. Just go ahead and throw a shot of bourbon in a cup of day old cold coffee and you get the picture! I personally like the regular Breakfast Stout from Founder's better but that's my personal taste. Try them both and make up your own mind ..Thy are both worth seeking out!"
"Wow...Pours a pitch black with a small tan head. The head died quicklt, probably due to the extras the beer has added to it. Aroma of chocolate predominate with boubon, coffee, vanilla, and roasted malt. Taste is simply mana from heaven. A nice coffee and bourbon flavor, some chocolate, vanilla and barrel aged oak. A very complex beer, sweet up front with linering roasted barley bitterness. Not totally balanced but so wonderful nonetheless. A very big wonderful oak barrel aged stout."
"Recieved this from Ron at Vintage Estates on my last trip to Youngstown ohio. Poured into a taster glass pours a nice pitch black with minimal head. The smell is jumping off the charts dark chocolate, cocoa, espresso, strong brewed coffee, simply amazing smells coming from this beer. Taste is just as good as the smell, I can pick up a nice roasted nut flavor with a chocolate velvet flavor then with an aftertaste of coffee grounds with oatmeal. I could drink this stuff in my cereal it is that good for a mornng bevereage, who needs coffee when you have this giant."
"***Upon further review, this beer is ridiculously good. Kalamazoo please forgive me but my favorite stout is not brewed by Bell's. I swear it is so good I would at least consider naming my first born KBS."
"D: Very nice, extremely well-balanced stout. This is an amazingly-crafted brew, wish it wasn't so hard to get. Frankly, it surprises me this is defined as an imperial stout (and not a Russian Imperial Stout). Glad I had the opportunity to try this one."
"D - I try not to read too much into hyped beers, but this one is well deserving of any recognition it receives. This beer is utterly unbelievable in its complexity; where do I order cases of this stuff???yeah right we all wish.."
"D - One of the best beers I have had. Good complexity and balance. Alcohol content makes it a little hard to have too many, but who cares."
"200th review - Received as an extra from iceicebaby (thanks again Sean). Served in my DFH snifter. Poured a dark, opaque brown. Quarter-inch tan-colored head subsided into a slick of foam with a solid ring around the shoulders. Jagged peaks and valleys of lacing, but adherence is somewhat spotty. Smell is decadent. Lots of coffee and molasses up front with a warm bourbon quality in the background. Dark fruit is revealed as the snifter warmed in my hand. Flavors offer a nice and balanced blend of the qualities presented in the nose. Coffee is roasty without tasting burnt or astringent. Cocoa flavors are detected as well. Bourbon character is complementary rather than over-assertive. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and silky up front; not at all viscous. A little chalky, but not unpleasantly so. Alcohol is fairly well-hidden and quite drinkable. A great brew to celebrate my 200th review."
"Pours a dark dark brown with moderate tan head. Smells strongly of tobacco, bourbon, coffee, chocolate. Tastes as it smells--hard to describe what tobacco tastes like, but mix that with some bourbon, coffee, chocolate, molasses, malt, and I don't know what else, and you've got this beer. Not one you'd drink a lot of, this is more of a sipping beer, but it's a truly great one."
"Pours a thick solid black with a thin off white head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is heavy on the coffee as would be expected. I also get some chocolate, tobacco, ash, and dried fruits. Complex aroma really, but heavy coffee. Taste hits with roast then chocolate, and then comes the coffee on the attack. Finish with some vanilla, and some bourbon that is oh so subtle. Awesome complexity!! Creamy full bodied mouthfeel. Excellant brew, I wish it was more available! Another well done brew from founders."
"Highly recommended. Definitely one of the better imperial stouts out there."
"This is a one and done treat. I am glad his does not come in a bomber because it be to hard to drink in one sitting. Excellent beer that brings a world class flavor. I'm not going to say this is my favorite beer, but it is a pleasure to drink."
"This beer is intense and I can finish a whole one for sure but another right after? I think not..."
"I owe a big thanks to a great pal, SkinnyElvis, for this taste of Blue Grass Breakfast!"
"D : Not sure if I could drink more than 1 or 2 at a time but I would come back to this beer any chance I get."
"I would put this above Abyss, and even above Speedway in my tastings. Though Abyss should age the best and Speedway would be enjoyed more by those who prefer coffee to chocolate. I am still awaiting specimens of DL, Darkness and KtG."
"D- Easy to drink, almost too easy. I'm getting a nice buzz while drinking it. Very delish."
"Big shout out to ""Med"" for sending me this bottle. Blacker than your average imperial stout - barely any light at the edges. There was a minimal tan head, perhaps due to its age (I am uncertain of its age) because I am sure my brandy snifter is ""beer clean."" The aroma is utterly beguiling. An amazing balance of coffee, vanilla, cocoa, milk duds, bourbon and that decades of candy and soda smell from old 7-11's, Highs, or the candy aisle in an old drug store. Also a hint of suburban decaying strip-mall hair/ nail salon with the chocolate/ candy store next door from the 80's. All in balance. I have been sitting here for ten minutes just smelling the damn thing. Flavor is all of the above with the addition of a High's blue Slushie and boozy alcohol. The bourbon/vanilla/ chocolate factor is very forward, and I'm afraid the strong alcohol presence lifts the flavors up a little out of balance and becomes somewhat harsh. Full body with a hot boozy and acidic finish that brings back some bourbon and vanilla notes. Objectively I will say that this is a must have for imperial/ coffee stout fans, though on drinkability I must go low, because I am not going to finish this thing. But damn its good to finally have one."
"I am not sure if my nose is not quite working tonight or what, but I am quite surprised how little of the Bourbon barrel influence is noticeable in the aroma. In the end the balance between roast character and smooth chocolate become really nice, the Bourbon barrel seems to meld into the background such that it supplies a nice complexity; so definitely serves this more towards 59°F / 15°C to get the best flavor balance. Much better and much more balanced than I was expecting; definitely a very good, moderate use of Bourbon Barrel character and coffee if drunk on the warm side."
"All in all this is one fantastic brew. far and away the best of the bourbon barrel aged stouts I've come across yet. I got to find a way to secure a case of this next go round."
"A very good bourbon stout, probably the best I've had. Though perhaps a bit more age would balance it out some more. Probably a bit over-hyped, but still very good."
"Ovr: Really good stout. I was expecting a ton, and I don;t know that it lived up to every expectation I had, but all in all it was a really good example of a barell aged stout."
"This beer is just outright awesome. by far one of the best beers I've gotten the pleasure to try so far. I would love to have this available all the time. If you haven't tried this puppy yet do what you can to get some of this."
"D: I wrote "" Bourbon County Lite"" hahahaa. This is a really great beer. I think the reason I like the other better is that there is simply too much going on in this beer. It is amazing. Every sip really did yield something different. I think the insanity of this beer is why is deserves to be a top nod."
"D: Not a session beer by any means, but I could sip it from a snifter all night like a fine bourbon. I've had it in it's bottle form and wasn't thrilled. Enjoying it on tap opened my eyes to how good this beer really is."
"This beer is interesting becuase it tastes kinda like coffee gone cold, which I hate. But add alcohol and bourbon flavor with hints of chocolate and vianilla and its GOLD, Jerry, GOLD!"
"This is my first one all to myself so I thought I would give it a review. Poured this into my Duvel tulip at a little bit below cellar temp. A nice aggressive pour gives a thick dark brown 1.5 inch head. This beer is dark and viscous, just pouring it out of the bottle looked and smelled like fresh brewed coffee. It has thick full lacing all over the glass. The smell while its still cool is just completely dominated by great fresh brewed coffee and espresso beans. As it warms up I get lots of chocolate and a hint of bourbon but the coffee just completely dominates for me. The taste is just incredible. Perfect balance of roasted malts, coffee, vanilla oakiness, and chocolate. One of the best tasting imperial stouts I have ever had. The mouthfeel is nice and thick and viscous. I could seriously drink this all night at anytime. I definitely see why they call it a breakfast stout with this much coffee flavor but I love it. I never really got that much bourbon out of this but I didn't really care; I also had a year aged one at a tasting about a month ago and the barrel aging was much more evident after aging."
"D- (I dislike this rating system because its so difficult to accurately convey what these fields mean) I could drink a bottle of this over the course of an hour or three and enjoy every second of it."
"Drinkability- The Kentucky Breakfast Stout I had enjoyed in the past was not near as great as this KBS. This could damn well be teh best double stout in the world."
" This is also another beer that i think only one bottle would be my fill since it is so heavy, but i savored it and drank it slow. I wonder what bourbon barrel it was in to get that taste. Maybe a makers mark or a pappy van winkel if we are lucky."
"Drinkability is through the roof for both the style & ABV. Damn near flawless, yum. This damn near pulled a straight-line five, lucky bastards in Michigan that can hoard this!"
"EDIT: I've had this numerous times in the last year or so and I had to up my review a bit. This is one of the best handful of beers in the world. Absolutely phenomenal."
"Alcohol is well masked but packs a whallop. This isn't a beer I'd order a pitcher of (that's a lie...I probably would if I could) but it's easy to drink, and like the label promises, it cured my lame back. I think I did experience some unexpected swelling though (yeah, it's that good)."
"D - a very nice sipper."
"D - I wished I'd had more at the end of the glass, so I can't complain about the drinkability."
"D: wonderful, a sipper for sure, bourbon taste was a little much at first but I quickly got used to it, alcohol is hidden very well, could drink a couple of these easily, still, I might have to say I like the regular Breakfast Stout better"
"Tried this one side by side with Founders Breakfast Stout (i know, different beers, etc). A lot of similarities but this one goes the extra mile. Pours pretty much pitch black, getting almost zero head in spite of my best efforts. What's there is a very dark tan. Smells of bourbon (duh), molasses, pear, coffee grounds, maple, and some raisins/dark fruit. A bit more ""twang"" than the FBS, likely the sweet bourbon soaked fruit and slightly more evident alcohol. Taste shows much of the same but in heavier doses: deeper raisin and prune to the profile here, more pronounced hop bite in tandem with peppery alcohol esters, a lot of oak with a kiss of vanilla. Coffee takes more of a background to the oak here and is balanced out by the bourbon sweetness. Overall, in spite of being heavier in the abv department, this seems to address any imbalance issues that show up in FBS. The mouthfeel is thick and coating as one expects from the style, and its overall a really tasty, nicely layered stout - though I'd say there are more complex out there, particularly Abyss. I'd raid the local if this were available here - top notch. Big cheers to autumnaldave for the bottle."
"Kentucky Breakfast pours black with a reluctant dark cream colored head that dissipates to a thin film and whips quite quickly. This is most likely a result of the high ABV and as I will find out in a minute, the massive fullness of the mouthfeel. The smell is tantalizing. Sweet chocolate malts, faint coffee, and a discernibly oakiness combine with a slight fruitiness to promise a full treat to the tongue to follow. Taking a sip is an explosion of flavor. As mentioned, chocolate, coffee, oak, and fruit, but also a spiciness, vanilla, and bourbon. The mix of flavors is simultaneously infinitely complex and yet amazingly satisfying. As mentioned before, the beer boasts a full body with very subtle carbonation. Just a fantastic beer. While it is a sipping beer with the strength and complexity, it is also incredibly smooth and surprisingly easy to drink. I am not sure if I could ever get enough of this beer."
"Thanks again to tmc for this 4-pack. This is a rare treat that is well worth tracking down."
"On tap at Founder's on release day. Dark black in color with a deep brown head. The aromas were powerful with scents of coffee, milk chocolate, vanilla, oatmeal and bourbon. This continued into a powerful but smooth palate that was complex and extremely well balanced. Not much has to be said about this one other than it this truly was wonderful!"
"D- Oh man, this is something special. I can't rave about this one enough. this is one of the few beers that can really put the booze out there and get away with it, due to all the other rich mingling flavors that make it well balanced. I could drink as many of these as I could, until my liver packed up and hit the road."
"D: So rich and delicious. I can't believe I had no desire to try this beer. I now wish I had more. This will now be added to my Wants List. Amazing flavor and texture."
"This one poured a thick oil-like opaque black with a thin mocha head that quickly dissipated to a thin ring with good lacing. I have been waiting to try this one for a while. The smell was straight up coffee upfront. There was a hint of vanilla and bourbon there and some chocolate as well. The taste started out as strong espresso with a hint of mocha and vanilla. The bourbon came in the finish and there was hardly any alcohol aside from the oak tinted bourbon flavor. The mouthfeel wasn't thick like one would think. It was extremely smooth and pleasing. The drinkability was great but be careful with this one. Overall, I loved it and am looking foward to aging the other bottle I have."
"Thanks to saucya for this one! Poured from bottle into snifter. Very dark with absolutely no head at all. Big aromas of coffee, chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla, with some alcohol underneath. Probably the best smelling beer I've had in the short time I've been a beerhead. Big taste of coffee, bourbon, and vanilla, with a bit of chocolate underneath. Alcohol warms the throat, but isn't nearly as noticeable as I thought it would be in such a big beer. Mouthfeel is right in the middle where I like it. Drinkability is surprisingly high considering the style. This beer definitely lives up to its hype, nicely balancing the flavors from the barrel with the flavors from the beer."
"I had to give this stout the highest ratings possible. There is nothing you could do to improve on this beer short of having more of them! Simply incredible! No hype here, just incredibly well-balanced and full flavored."
"D- This is a sipper but honestly it is the best of the style that I have experienced. I don't put much stock in Imperial stouts but if you are going to try one, this is the one to try."
"I poured this dark oil into a corsendonk goblet.It produced no head at all with very little carb.I have had alot of stouts but this is the first one I had that taste and smell like coffee I mean it has no hints of anything else.Now I did have this at room temp so I don't know if that would really effect it but man when they say breakfast stout they were'nt kidding.This would go great with some bacon and egges.The next time I drink this it will be at breakfast"
"It takes a while to find the proper way to describe it. I still haven't figured out how. And that's a wonderful thing."
"A unique beer, the bourbon leading the charge to what may be an unprecedented extent. Enjoyable, thought-provoking. A perfect nightcap. Absolutely recommended."
"D- Amazing beer. I can't wait til we start getting founders here in NJ on a regular basis."
"Overall, really good, but there's still two stouts I'd put above it. Not to say I'm not happy to still have several in the beer fridge!"
"I swear, I think this beer is perfect. You must try it."
"D-So I've had this beer before on tap and in bottle I love this beer so much I would like to freeze it into ice cubes and skate on it. I could drink it all day/night long. Probably not a good hot weather beer...but here in the cold North its perfect!!!"
"HV"
"Pours pitch black with a big medium lived dark brown head. Smell is strong coffee, mild bourbon and oak. Very well balanced smell and not overly bourbony. Taste is equally as well balanced with rich dark chocolate like roasty malt, a touch of vanilla, stong oak flavor, a touch of bourbon, and bold coffee flavors. This is really nice, and quite a bit more enjoyable than the original breakfast stout. Medium to thick body and moderate to light carbonation. Awesome beer."
"Does not hide the alcohol, it displays it like a work of art. No beer bongs for this beer, but it is very drinkable."
"Overall, tasty... and I'm enjoying it very much. Though if I had to have this or GIBC, I'd probably go for the GIBC."
"Cheers"
"A very nice offering and glad I was fortunate to run across a couple of these gems. Despite my three year old knocking over my glass, I really enjoyed this one. It's not my favorite style but the complexities and unique taste make it really good."
"12 oz bottle. Pours pitch black in kind of that thick motor oil kind of pour. Limited amounts of dark tan head but the head lingered until the last sip. Aroma of bourbon and oak with some coffee and earth sprinkled in. Initial flavor is dominated by alcohol and coffee, with some bourbon noted in there at times as well. Flavor ended with much of the same but almost became sweeter from chocolate and less of the bitter coffee taste. Tons of lacing, very heavy body, very limited carbonation, and the alcohol was definitely detectable in this one. To summarize, have fresh pairs of underwear on hand when trying this, you will need them."
"Can't wait to taste it on tap at the brewery"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily for a beer with 10.00% ABV, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is one of those good big stouts that is worth drinking for a while until the ABV catches up to you."
"D - Alcohol plays a strong role in this beer, both in flavor and effect. Very different from any other strong stout I've had, although I don't think any of those have been aged in oak barrels for a full year. Lives up to the hype, but not a beer I'd want to have everyday with its very oaky flavor. This is definitely a sipper."
"D - Drinkability is good. This is a strong full bodied beer that is very smooth. Everything about this brew is impressive. I would highly recommend the Kentucky Breakfast Stout."
"Very good beer, but not top 10 in the world."
"*Revised for changes in temperature"
"Sampled on tap at Founders...what a great experience. Color was dark as can be, it was served in a snifter but had very little head, I dont know if it decipated by the time I got it or it wasnt there to begin with. Some lacing. Smell was great, incredible amounts of coffee as well as alcohol. At first I was a bit taken back but it quickly grew on me. The taste was amazing. This has to me one of the first 5's I've given on taste. Dark chocolate, coffee, some vanilla, some bourbon, some earth tones...everthing. Wonderfully complex! Thick as all hell though, low carbonation of course. Left a nice warm coating every inch as it went down. Overall I was tremendously impressed with this beer, and I have to say having right at the brewery itself made the experience so much better."
"Mouthfeel is just a bit thin, not too carbed. Very tasty and enjoyable sipper. Many thanks to BuckeyeNation for sending this one my way."
"d- very drinkable if you take your time to appreciate the complexities of this beer. good companion on a cold night, will keep your attention as the flavors change with the temperature of the beer. alcohol becomes more prevalent as the drink warms up, also feels lighter as the sips continue. pretty good beer."
"Drinkability - This offering lived up to what I had hoped for and read about in the KBS. Well worth gathering all you can into your fold. I will very much have to put the other Founders stouts on my ""must have"" list."
"Poured an opaque black with medium off white head that stayed for a few minutes. Smell was unexceptional - whiskey, burnt chocolate, malt. Taste did not have as much whiskey as I would have liked - it was there, but in a fresh bottle, I expected it to be more forward rather than subdued. Nice round mouthfeel and fairly drinkable for this ABV. All around good imperial, barrel aged stout, but I can think of several I like better (see Goose Island Bourbon County Stout.)"
"An outstanding brew from Founders and easily one of my top 5 favorite beers to look forward to every year. Pleasure in a bottle."
"World class. Very happy I finally got some."
"Overall, a nice american double imperial stout, but not the greatest. It has its own particular coffee forward character, but for me, it doesn't warrant such high praise- my own taste leans towards sweeter chocolate stouts (I tasted/smelled very little chocolate in this, despite what others wrote). I do feel the coffee and woody flavor is quite overpowering in comparison to other components- again, more malt and sweetness would offer more balance to this beer. I fear labeling this beer overrated, but on a personal subjective basis, this is not an all timer for me. I do have 4 more bottles to try, so perhaps my view will change, as I think my expectation for something thicker and more sweet may have colored my judgment. In the end, a nice (particularly if you love coffee), but not great beer."
"Love this beer!"
"Pitch black in appearance. Tan head falls to some moderate lacing. Inviting aromas of sweet bourbon, tons of oak, molasses, and dark roasted coffee. Rich flavors of oak, dark chocolate, black coffee, vanilla, and roasted malt. Then finishes with a bit of bitter hops and some oak seems to linger. The AVB is warming, but hidden well. Mouth feel is creamy and smooth. Good carbonation and slightly sticky. Drinkability is fantastic. Very easy to sip on for such a complex barrel aged Imperial Stout. Highly recommended!"
"I was expecting this to be good but not this good. I've heard the hype about this one for a while and couldn't believe that it could be that good. I was wrong. This is, without a doubt, the best Imperial Stout that I've ever had. Not because it's harder to get, not because of the hype. It just tastes, smells, looks, and feels better than the rest. The remaining 3 will be shared by the wife and I and maybe a few close friends as I don't expect to ever have my hands on this brew again. Thanks again, antzman, for making this happen.."
"There is no hype surrounding this beer... It has earned it's legendary status."
"Way to go Founders. Thanks!"
"Michigan beer is wonderful... it's hard to get a grade like this out of me."
"I had possession of 2 of these (thanks ghscash for picking up a four pack and sporting me a couple). I held out for a week before drinking the first. I'm looking forward to seeing what the other one tastes like a couple years from now."
"Mouthfeel - Dry and medium-to-full in body, certainly not the fullest imperial stout I've tried, but very rich in flavor."
"2008 Rating A: 5 S: 5 T: 5 MF: 5 D: 5"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's thick and a bit chewy. Definitely one to savor. Carbonation is excellent. At 10%, it's strong, but still very drinkable. Though probably not advisable, I finding myself wanting more and more. Overall, this truly is a world class beer. No question the best I've had to date. Strongly recommended."
"Got this one in a trade. Have to say that it didn't quite live up to the hype. Poured from a 12oz bottle to a pint glass, the beer was thick and blacker than night, looking more like a reduction than a beer. A small mocha colored head appeared briefly and then faded to nothing. Not a good start. The nose was full of oak and bourbon notes, vanilla, fruit, nuts... but no roast malt. The flavor was similar to the aroma, all vanilla and whiskey, cloyingly sweet (caramel), very little roast malt character. I understand why people like this beer - it's extreme, over the top - but I want to taste the roasted malt, the coffee, the burnt toast. This one was too sweet for me to enjoy drinking, and the bourbon flavors dominated/overpowered the beer."
"D: Amazing. I could keep sipping on this for a long time. ICan easily feel the effects of the alcohol but it never gets in the way of enjoying the beer. Obviously something to take your time with and naturally not an everyday beer."
"D- an awesome sipper"
"Does it live up to the hype? Absolutely."
"Opaque with light tan thin head. Lots of coffee on the nose, with vanilla notes. A little caramel too. Viscous mouthfeel with a burnt (not unpleasant) coffee finish. Alcohol not evident. Great beer, but I don't think I'd want to drink more than one."
"Pours a thick, almost syrupy black. Completely opaque, with a dark brown head that doesn't last long at all. Minimal lacing. Smell is fantastically rich. Smells a lot like Kahlua. Coffee and vanilla are most noticeable up front with notes of oak and bourbon. Taste is huge, sweet, and rough all at the same time. All that was promised in the smell was there and then some. Very earthy. There was also a flavor that I couldn't put my finger on. The flavor kind of reminded me of the way a cave smells. Can't say I ever said that about a beer before! Mouthfeel is monstrously thick. I'll definitely pick up more of this when I find them and see what other flavors may have gone undetected, because I feel that there's more here than I originally noticed."
"D: Delicious. The smoothness really helps this monster go down... the only thing holding this baby back is the flavor complexity... its got a tad too much going on to keep drinking many of these... but thats not a bad thing at all!"
"It was served to me in a snifter and had a nice tan head to it, I liked the complexity to the beer the different flavors that start to come out as it changed temperature. This is a beer I enjoyed but I am not sure I would want to enjoy more than one of at a time."
"Taste is great, very satisfying. High abv makes it unwise to consume a lot, but with every sip I want just a little more."
"D - have to say was really surprised by how drinkable this one really was. The alchy was not at all overpowering and didn't even think of this one as being too much of a sipper either. The smooth body makes it easy to get drink a lot of and the taste are pretty balanced so that you don't feel tired of it or want a change. Pretty happy I could get ahold of some of this and think it would even be better after given a little more age to it though it is already pretty mellow. For a big bourbon stout, it is so drinkable that even my girlfriend found it easy to drink and that is hard to believe since she hates alcohol."
"This is an extremely tasty brew, and I can see why it is so highly praised."
"Peace"
"D: The full body, large ABV, and powerful flavors make this a one or two beer for me. But it is a great, well condition and balanced beer."
"Tastes smooth and rich with a hint of sweet chocolate at the front that strengthens on finish. Light carbonation makes this beer a great sipper and easy to actually drink in the morning. Have with some chocolate chip pancakes and get your Sunday started off right."
"Drinkability: Remarkably drinkable for being such a powerhouse of a beer. This beer is SO GOOD that it can be hard not to just go on and on about how awesome it is."
"D- Bring em on! I really like this beer. I am going to track down a few more bottle for sure. Don't have too many though or you will be falling down."
"This is a fantastic brew. Though the nose is a little too much on the burnt plastic side, the rich, complex, and lingering flavor is outstanding. Definitely one of the elite American stouts."
"Pours a completely pitch impenetrable black. Little tiny tan head, despite a very vigorous high pour. Smell is mostly coffee and bitter chocolate malts. Bourbon shows up more here than in the taste. Taste is coffee, burnt coffee and rich roasted malts. Some bourbon pokes through with tiny vanilla. There is a slightly creamy pinch in the early middle of the taste. bitterness is light through the middle and picks up towards the end but is relatively subtle the entire way through. Coffee defenitely dominates on the aftertaste, but the early finish has sort of a roasty hop bite. Coffee stays on the tongue for quite some time on the aftertaste. mouthfeel is thinner than I would have expected, but quite good. This adds a bit to the drinkability which is quite good. The ABV is GONE!! Nowhere to be found! The are many similarities between this and the FBS, especially the domination of the coffee flavors, but this one is noticeably different. This beer lacks the sometimes unpleasant akward sweetness found in a lot of impy stouts. The thinness is an assisst to this which I find quite pleasant. A very fine stout, and one I will surely trade for again."
"Drinkability: The only thing that would hinder the drinkability of this beer is the 10% ABV. Other than that, this is a great beer and I would love to get my hands on some each time it comes available. Highly recommended."
"I enjoyed this much more than the Breakfast Stout. I could have 2+ of these easy, & I can't say that about FBS. More complex and not as chocolatey. This is going to be a staple on my wants list for awhile. If you enjoy imperial stouts or barrel beers, especially stouts, you owe it to yourself to find this one. Get some if you can."
"Mouthfeel is full and heavy. Very slick and oily. Aftertaste is a little bit bitter and the alcohol hits me in the back of my throat after swallowing. Warms the belly nicely on a cold night. I can't seem to remember who sent this one to me, but thanks!"
"This is a world-class stout, deserving of it's rank on BA."
"A fantastic stout. The roastiness and barrel wood flavors are absolutely excellent. Extremely balanced while not being overly subtle. Great."
"Full bodied, super smooth, a bit chewy, and not heavy or syrupy as you would expect. Too easy to drink - should be a sipper but hard to put down, as it begs for another gulp. Desert, night-cap, or with breakfast, I'd make many excuses for having one. Truly a special beer."
"Incredibly smooth (oats?), not heavy or syrupy, yet it's a sipper. Perfect to sit and contemplate without weighing you down. There's a reason it's ranked so high...it's a very balanced imperial stout, possibly the most balanced i've ever had."
"This beer is a huge beer and may take some getting used to for some but is one of the best beers I've ever drank."
"Bottom line: A world class brew that is worth seeking out again and again. In fact, it's going right back on my Wants list as I write this review...."
"The 10% is very warming, but i wouldn't say hot by any means. It is a sipper, but i can see how it could replace your morning cup of joe on sunday morning (or any morning you dont have to work). Although, at 10%, and so heavy, one at a time is plenty. IMO this is WAY better than FBS."
"The bourbon in this beer is quite subdued and is complimentary to the coffee and chocolate."
"Drinkability is good, I liked this considerably better than the original Breakfast stout which was much more coffee-forward and not as balanced, the alcohol is subdued despite the 11% level, this was definitely a treat, hopefully I can get my hands on more in the future."
"I had a lot of expectations regarding this beer, and I think I may have enjoyed this more without the expectations. The beer pours a very dark brown, with little head. The smell is of bourbon with some vanilla and roasted coffee. The taste is over the top bourbon, with burnt coffee. The taste just didnt do it for me, it was a little too overboard and tasted like a cold coffee and bourbon mixed drink. Given the hype around this beer, I will someday probably come into possession of another bottle and see if my first impressions were off."
"overall this is a great beer, but not near as complex as i figured it would be. even though it got better as it warmed, it still was pretty one dimensional, coffee."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into a New Belgium snifter. Poured black with a dark tan head that foamed up two fingears than faded a minute later. Smell is dominated by coffee with hints of vanilla, chocolate, and a whiff of charred fussel oak. Taste coffee with darkfruit, molasses, and a alcohol warmth. While a great sipper or really drunk start to the day I could enjoy a couple but with 10 abv you might have weird afternoon."
"I feel that this is significantly different in taste but about equal in quality to the regular breakfast stout."
"Really don't see how this is a top 10, but nothing this good is going to raise any kind of serious complaint from me."
"Edit: I drank another bottle that I had gotten at the same time about a week later. The second bottle was more complex and interesting. The aroma had more of a bourbon note to it - I'm raising the score by 0.5 simply for the smell."
"I'm going to try and pick up a couple more if I can find them so I can age them to see how it goes. I can't imagine it not being better."
"Overall- An excellent sipper. This is a great night cap/snowy evening beer!"
"Damn. I love Kentucky Breakfast Stout. What a fantastic kick off for 2008. Happy New Year!"
"2nd review: Bottle consumed 1 day after purchase at the store.... completely fresh. I complained about the bourbon being TOO strong in my past review... not so much this time. It actually seems a little mellowed. Did Founder ship an aged bottle? lol. Smell was still pleasant. Mouthfeel is still nearly perfect except just a bit too much chalkiness... very smooth nonetheless. It's still a sipper and that I did :)"
"All in all, this is a fine beverage, but way too strong and over-the-top for me. I much prefer the ""regular old"" Breakfast Stout. If you want your ass handed to you in a snifter, sign up for the KBS ride and hold on for dear life."
"D - I like it. More hyped than I thought deserved. My stout isn't as good, but it comes close. Still, glad to try it."
"Highly drinkable for 10%. Almost no alcohol to overwhelm."
"Drinkability was excellent. It went down easily, and I could have had another without a problem, although it would have knocked me on my ass. I can't wait to see what aging does to this one. The other three bottles are cellaring."
"I think I had 2 or 3 glasses of this at The Glass Nickle over GTMW weekend. The problem is that my notes were written in Chineese. I managed to be able to trade for a bottle shortly thereafter. Pitch black with a rich lasting brown head. Good lace. Beautiful. The aroma is really blended well. You get all the coffee, bourbon, and oak and such. The aroma is great, but it does nothing for the onslaught of flavor that comes next. Lots of of cold steeped coffee aroma. The flavor is a wonderful blend of chocolate, coffee, soft bourbon, a drop of vanilla, and a good oaky dry finish. Chewy, lush, full body. Very easy drinking. Unbeleivable."
"Wonderfully complex and a true breakfast stout. I find it nice in the cold weather. I don't drink in the morning because I never have a full day off of work at this point, but I wish I would have the oppurtunity to drink one of these in the morning. I want more please."
"Consumed on 7/24/07- bday beer and complements of xav33. Pours out like motor oil. More head than expected-colour of milk chocolate. Nose- bakers chocolate and dark roasted coffee beans. Taste- that is some heavy shit! bourbon, chocolate explosion, vanilla, and so on... Viscous yet creamy mouthfeel and hops have a good bite at the end. Not boozy, not not a beer to be messed with . This bottle took a couple of hours to contemplate as it should."
"d: Big thanks to hoppymeal for the chance to try this one. This is a fantastic beer for sure, but I prefer Breakfast Stout."
"Very well balanced and oh so drinkable. It is an oatmeal infused coffe/beer delight. Could drink this for breakfast any day. Good stuff and highly recommended."
"This is a pretty awesome brew. I like the aroma and flavor characteristics that the bourbon barrels impart in this beer, but they're maybe a weee bit much. This would be all 5's if the bourbon were a bit subtler rather than so dominant. But I'm completely nitpicking. This is a treat for sure."
"Founders Breakfast Stout will probably be a disappointment to me now that I have tried this first, this belongs in the top five on BA, flawless beer that has so much going on, would pay twenty bucks a four pack if this was available anywhere near me, so far this is Founders best brew, I cannot recommend this one enough, great barrel aged beer that is not too hard to find, need more asap, KBS sets the standard as far as stouts go, maybe even beer in general, congratulations to Founders for brewing this masterpeice"
"The smell is heavily bourbon laden with some coffee and chocolate poking through. The flavor is more balanced, but still predominantely bourbon centered. There's also some cocoa, vanilla, and even a touch of fruit in there."
"Pours black and somewhat viscous with a brown head that fades to a thin ring. The overallfeel in the mouth is that it is a smooth beer that is a little lighter than the pour would suggest. The smell is nicely integrated aromas of bourbon, cocoa, vanilla, coffee, and wood. The most noticeable trait of the aroma is how beautifully integrated everything is. The taste possesses that similar seamless integration of flavors, with an herbal bitterness up front and long bourbon and coffee flavors on the midpalate and finish followed by some more bitterness and a final hit of cocoa and vanilla. Quite a bit more finesse and a spot less power than I expected, but still magnificent. Mouthfeel is smooth, lighter than expected given the abv, and amazingly smooth and with flavors that transition easily from one to another. Very enjoyable and absolutely drinkable- no trace of heat at all."
"Well at long last here it is. The fabled and much adorned Kentucky Breakfast Stout. I was finally able to get my hands on this one, and did not waste anytime in getting my review up here. This was one mean beer, I have to say. This one hurt me, mostly because I did not know it was. Poured a very deep dark black, thick like a shake and a full two finger head of caramel brown foam at the top. Nice gradual settle down left behind some very nice side glass lace. The smell was wonderful, full of sweet caramel and lactose sugar with a rich coffee and chocolate undertone, simply to die for as for as RISs go. The taste was so complex and diverse, I did not know what I was trying, this one was nuts to say the least. Full on assault of sweet caramel and chocolate from the very start, as this mellowed some very nice coffee tones. Very full, rich, and robust profile. This was one not to take lightly. The feel was like a dessert shake. Such a warming feeling, with really no hint of alcohol at all. Overall I would have to say this definitely lived up to its hype. It was a fantastic offering and easily one of the best RIS I have ever had. It fully deserves its reputation and its rating on here. A truly top notch beer that everyone should have to try at least once, definitely and whole hearted recommendation from the BA."
"The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. A velvet coating on the tongue with a juicy finish. Low carbonation. Absolutely exquisite. An intense and pleasurable beer experience. Easily worth the drive to Michigan."
"A short but beautiful rich chocolate brown head creeps to barely half an inch. Body is thick as used motor oil and pours almost syrupy slow. The nose is like griding a fresh batch of high end coffee. Soft but distinct backround notes of coco and bourbon notes also exist. As you take first sip you are amazed by the smoothness of this beer. Coffee is nicely roasted and almost creamy. Bourbon feel is noticeable both on the start and finish of the palate. Very dark chocolate notes are softly presented throughout the palate. Drinks nicely as it warms to room tempature. Mouthfeel is like eating a rich truffle, it just makes you want more. Although the alchol is very well hidden it does warm the belly nicely. Drinkability would only be limited by it's availability. A lovely beer worth the hype."
" O...V...E...R...R...A...T...E...D."
"Very glad I got a chance to try it though. Thanks Toby."
"Drink: It could be that I'm getting tired of barrel aged stouts but nevertheless, a pint of this beer goes down quite fast considering its abv. 4"
"Drinkability- Simply a wonderful beer. So easy to drink and silky smooth. The only thing Id like to see slightly different would be a bit more of the bourbon. I thought the Abyss had a bit more of a whisky flavor but this is definitely a tastier brew. Do whatever you can to find this beer. Itll be more than worth it. Thanks again to tpd975 for the opportunity to savor this delight!"
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a warm black and chocolate malt scent along with a beautiful bourban whiskey aroma. It's got a coffee-like aroma that really draws you in. The taste is perfect. This is the best tasting stout I've ever had. It has a very complex palate of flavors ranging from sweet and creamy to earthy and coffee like. The bourban barrel aging really mellows it out and greatly enhances the taste. The mouthfeel is perfect as well. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. I enjoyed this on tap at the brewery. It was the last stop on my roadtrip and was definately worth it. I wish we could get this in NY. This is the best stout I've tried. It's about as close to a perfect beer that you're going to find."
"The feel is full-bodied and goes through several iterations of feel, from sweet to bitter and creamy. I loved this beer and despite the 10%abv, I could drink these until I ran out. As I said, I admit that this lives up to it's hype, and then some."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and chewy. In fact, I would be all about a caramel candy flavored like this. This is an absolutely fan-freaking-tastic beer. It should be on everyones want list."
"I will start by acknowledging that I might be a touch biased with this review. After buying one of these and hiding it away for a couple months before my big going away party (joining a beerless nation for the Peace Corps), my dad threw it down, not even thinking. After racing all over the state to find another one, I finally had it, with a couple hours to spare. So basically, there was no way I was going to dislike this one. And I didn't. Pours a perfect pitch black color, with two fingers of tan head on top that slowly dissolves down to a delicious looking film. Aroma is crazy strong coffee, alcohol, spiciness, and some breadiness. Tons of roasted malt. Excellent aromas. Flavor is fantastic. Alcohol spice works in perfectly with the roasted malt on the back of the tongue. Definite but subtle bourbon flavors. Nice sweet dried fruit and brown sugar on the tip of the tongue. A nice hint of chocolate as well. As it warms, a nice zap of winey liquor at the end. Truly an incredible flavor. Body is creamy and full, with perfect carbonation. Can't say enough about this one. The best beer I've ever tasted, bar-none, and a great farewell to beer drinking, at least for a little while."
"The body is the star of this beer. A smooth silky finish and really makes this beer cloying to drink. A full body for sure but very deceptive in the ease of drinking. A great beer for sure."
"Good beer. I prefer the regular Founders Breakfast Stout but I wouldn't turn this one down. In fact it's time I start searching for another."
"This is a fantastic stout to say the least. The smell was amazing and would certainly be something I would love to smell in the mornings. The taste is complex in a superb way. Its like the best chocolate cereal but instead of milk we soak it with the finest coffee with a little sugar on top. Its like Hersey, Star bucks, and Jack Daniels sexing it up and the creation is FKBS."
"Even on a very hard pour only a thin dark brown cap appeared, then fell quickly to a skim of fine bubbles and a thin ring. The beer itself was black, but with the thinnest of mahogany edges when held up in bright light. Some spotty lace clung to the glass between sips. Assertive roasted coffee aroma, some grounds, toffee and caramel, with wood character in the background. Thick and sweet pretty much sums up the first sip. There was a lot of coffee and roast flavour, but also equal parts dark and milk chocolate along with rich caramel. Oak played a role in the middle, growing into a whiskey barrel, alcoholic finish. Still, it stayed quite mellow for all the powerful flavours. Lots of alcohol warmth, low carbonation and a full, heavy body. Quite viscous and palate coating. Great stuff! Definitely a sipper, but a very nice balance for such a big, flavourful beer."
"Every possible thing I want out of a beer is in this one. Every part of this was good even right down to the package. Its also just getting better with age. The pour looks great. Very dark black with that dark tan coffee head. The smell has breakfast all over it. Coffee and chocolate and sweet vanilla jump out. A lot of sweet bourbon notes up front and then finishes with a dry coffee taste that it leaves in your mouth. Alcohol was not very notable to me. This was my first 5 of 5 after 60 beers reviewed. A kick ass beer."
"D- I think it is good but the coffee is overwhelming and body is a little thin. I still think their Imperial Stout is WAY better than this."
"A magnificent beer and a perfect after dinner sipper. To be paired with chocolate."
" I'm looking forward to giving the regular breakfast stout a try in the near future. I'm a big fan of the style, and of Founder's, and want to check out a more traditional version."
"Pours an opaque soot black with a chocolate milk head and plenty of lacing. Looks like a beauty. Smells of roasted malts, roasted coffee beens, mild hops and some bourbon oak. Tastes like the smell with a hint of vanilla bean and it is delicious. Each of the flavors present themself proud as a peacock with each sip. Mouthfeel is full, a little chewy. Drinkability is amazing. The ABV is non existant which is rediculous, as it hides behind all the wonderful flavors. Definitly savoring each sip."
"Without doubt, one of the best beers I've had in a long, long time. I've been looking forward to checking this beer out for a while now and it surpassed my expectations. Highly recommended."
"D: I wish I lived in Grand Rapids. Enough said."
"Drinkability - this is excellent ale. It is very rich, hearty and delicious, but it really is more of a sipper than a session beer, and the high abv also limits sessionbility."
"Breakfast Stout from your home state will help you Mr. Prine!"
"Drinkability is good for such a big, strong beer, but it's a sipper."
"Thanks to cburian for sharing this rare treat with me!"
"Very well done. From the name of this, I did not expect to enjoy it, but it must be a blend and not 100% from the wood. I wouldn't mind having one of these every so often as a nightcap."
"This is a good beer, and I wish I had more. As far as stouts go, this is one of the better ones out there, but I think I was just expecting too much from this one to possibly deliver. Recommended"
"Overall, a very nice beer but for me not quite worthy of the major status acclaimed here. Perhaps it would be different from the bottle, Maybe I'll get a chance to see sometime, In the meantime glad to have had the opportunity today."
"Poured into a chalice a deep thick black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, some little oil slicks and sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, oaked, slightly roasted, vanilla, bourbon, and some coffee/caramel. The taste is awesome, hit you in the face malts/oak/coffee/bourbon. There's the sweetness of the vanilla that comes through, then a nice little bitterness finish. The alcohol is almost non-existent. Medium body, very well rounded brew. Very drinkable, definitely highly recommended."
"Absolutely amazing stout. This will have to be tried numerous times to fully appreciate it. I think I am up to the task."
"What a great beer for founders. I will definitely pick this one up again. Awesome work!!"
"I don't believe there's a brewery in existence that can match Founders when it comes to big stouts. Breakfast Stout, Imperial Stout, and now Kentucky Breakfast Stout are three of the most incredible beers that I've ever had the pleasure to drink. Never has twelve ounces seemed so much like six. Good thing I have three more bottles to go."
"I was blown away by this beer. One of the best if not my favorite stout i've ever had."
"Drinkability is good an enjoyable big beer that would be good to have on hand for when the mood hits no BCS but very good."
"D - 4"
"this beer is amazing, period. it sets a benchmark for the very deffinition of barrel aged double stout. well worth the price in my opinion. i'm a bit of a beer slut, but i would keep this in my fridge at all times if i could."
"12oz bottle, sampled alongside the Breakfast Stout. Pours pitch black, with a short, light brown head that quickly diminishes to a thing ring of bubbles that hugs the walls of the snifter. Strong coffee aroma; with some dark chocolate, oak and vanilla. The coffee aroma is stronger here than it is in my Breakfast Stout. The coffee again defines the flavor, again with some bitter dark chocolate in the background along with caramel and burnt toast flavors. Bourbon was not as prominant as I expected. More intense than the Breakfast Stout, but still smooth and enjoyable."
"Need more to review ;)"
"The most drinkable 10% stout you will find went down so smooth and easy really wishing I had more. Don't know what else to say other than: ""wish i had more"" A must try beer in my book !"
"What to follow this with? How about nothing. This is a slow mover, one that opens up new things every sip. Glad to have finally tried this heavily hyped cult classic. I prefer the regular Founders B'fast stout, I think it's more drinkable overall, but what's not to love here? Thanks once again to the man, aka msubulldog25, aka Brian. Cheers!"
"This is what a double stout is supposed to be. Much more impressed with this than Founder's regular Breakfast Stout (which is pretty damn good!). A very complex beer, you could spend a long time figuring this one out. I've got a few more in the cellar, and look forward to doing just that!"
"Overall, one hell of a beer. The complexity shows an obscene amount of skill from the brewer, and the immense flavors show a daringness as well. Highly recommended."
"D- This beer is big on wood and bourbon and those flavors increase as the beer warms. Not much other malt complexity to balance out the oak which gets to be a bit to much toward the end of the beer."
"As it says on the bottle: Is good for everything a stout ought to be good for."
"Thanks to Chris at Ebenezer's Pub for this one. Intensely black, with a small cocoa head. It had an aroma of coffee, molasses, and whiskey. The taste followed right along. Very strong coffee, like espresso, the molasses and whiskey more muted but still present. Fairly smooth in the mouth. This is a beer to sip and savor one at a time."
"Got in a trade with BeerBeing - thanks! Since trade not sure the year but notch definitely shows March. Poured from a 12oz bottle into my trusty pint glass. Had a cool label with fake claims of health cures. Was pitch black even when head against the light. It had an average sized dark brown head that settled into a collar with just a little lacing. The aroma was strong! It was coffee, coffee, more coffee and then several shots of bourbon thrown in. Also had a good vanilla aroma in the background. Gotta admit that I'm just not a fan of the bourbon/oak barrel aging of beers. Keep trying em hoping that I'll grow into it but I guess I want my beer to taste like beer and not whiskey. The taste pretty much followed the smell. Was an Irish coffee more than a beer. Got marginally better as it warmed but for me this one is overhyped. Glad I tried it as I like to try new things but this is one and done for me. (3, NA, ML, O?)"
"The flavor is equally amazing perfectly well balanced, just enough bitterness to support the superior malt complexities. I can taste coffee, bitter chocolate and hints of vanilla with a great Kona backend. Even after I swallow I can still smell it almost as if it is seeping out. Mouthfeel is not as thick as I thought it was going to be for strength which makes this even better. I feel like their mash temps matched with other proceeders / ingredients are so well chosen and performed, its like magic, great work, I am so blown away. I could drink this every morning for the rest of my life. This has to be one of the most quaffable big beers I have ever consumed. I now know what all the buzz around this beer is about and it is every bit deserved."
"Overall, not worth the $19 a 4pk I paid at the brewery to drink every day. But don't get me wrong, this stout is very complex, and worth seeking out. Hands down one of the most complex stouts I have every had, and believe me, that is saying something. I'm glad I have 9 more bottles to cellar, I can't wait to see what 6 months to 3 years in the cellar will yield."
"I prefer the Founders Breakfast Stout to the Kentucky Breakfast, but I love both. Your life as a beer drinker is not complete until you've at least tried this magnificent beer."
"Drinkability is quite good, this is very easy to sip. A very interesting and excellent beer."
"Drink it, if you can find it."
"Overall, this was a terrificly complex, flavorful, rich and unique beer. At $20 for a four-pack this stuff is pricey, but I am glad I had the opportunity to try it."
"First taste is of vanilla giving way to a dry chocolate and hickory barrel before the alcohol hits. Amazingly complex beer. Ends with a bourbony finsh that hangs around in the back of the throat till the next sip. This is a great beer Founders had brewed up. Gonna cellar this for a year to see if the alcohol notes (10%) settle down a bit. One of the best, most unique beers I've had to date."
"Picked this beer up from A-Wines in Inman Square. Lets see how it is compared to the regular Breakfast Stout. Not a shred of light was getting through the blackness of this brew. A small tan head also gave way to a brown lace. In the aroma were traces of smooth chocolate, coffee beans, whiskey, and some earth tones. Taste started off slightly acidic, then turned to burnt coffee and roasty bitterness. All the while there is a big background of fudgy chocolate.Mouthfeel, needless to say, is quite big, although the alcohol is not all that pronounced. This is an incredibly smooth brew; very silky, and big on flavor. At this point in the review, I have been drinking this one too fast, I will definitely be slowing down to let more of the complexities of this beer pull through. Although this beer was really expensive, it is so worth it. Definitely liked this one more than the normal Breakfast Stout. Founders continues to amaze me. This goes in as one of the best beers I have yet to sample. Cheers"
"Big thanks goes out to czoch75 for the bottle...this stuff is good!"
"Wish I had a few more of these; truly excellent."
"Pours out black and very thick. The head finally came up after I finished pouring. It grew to about 1/2 inch and then fell into a thin layer on top and almost went away completely. Lacing is strong and very nice. Smell is a slight bourbon with chocolate tones and a light cappacino backround. Taste is bourbon with roastiness and a little aftertaste of chocolate tones. A little warm on the tongue with a harsh carbonation on the palate. Very peppery in the finish and on my palate. Overall, I will let this baby age a little more before opening a new one. I don't even taste any vanilla which I got a nice flavor of from a small sample from MABZ last year. His last bottle God bless him."
"What a brew!"
"Just fantastic. Like no other."
"Wow, I've never had a beer quite like this before. It was pitch black, of course, with a short brown head. The aroma and flavor, to me, were dominated, but wonderfully so, by the coffee. The coffee blended right into the chocolate and roasted malt flavors, which gave way to the whisky. Still, there was a bland spot in the flavor profile just before the bourbon, and because of that, I can't give it a 5 for taste. I found it surprisingly drinkable and hope to find this again sometime."
"A long overdue thanks to the departed AKSmokedPorter/Lhasa/MC Gordon."
"Eat your heart out, Starbucks. A very good stout, but I don't believe it deserves quite the high rating on this site. Recommended, though. Cheers!"
"Nothing but black with this beast that tops off with a bubbly brown head that dies down soon after pour. Swirling leaves spotted lacing and minimal stickiness. Bubbles move so slow, almost like traveling through molasses. Moving on to the smell, so complex, I can't stop putting my nose up to this one. Fresh brewed coffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, dark chocolate, toffee, caramel...everything you can ask for! Honsetly, I hardly smell alcohol at all. I could smell this baby all day long, but my tounge needs to appreciate this one for sure...moving on...starts with a delicious fresh black coffee taste that goes down as a smooth sweet oaky vanilla. The bourbon definitely appears more as it warms up, but I'm lovin' it. So many complex malty flavors of toasted coffee/chocolate/coffee/molasses/coffee/nuts. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light to medium because of the more than expected carbonation. So smooth, so delicious, so true. Drinkability is scary good. Almost makes me wonder if this is alcoholic at all. Gimme more! Luckily I received a second one :) but that one will have to wait. Give up what you need to in a trade for this one, but luckily we have a very generous group of traders on this site."
"I cant wait for another one, but I may hang onto it for a year and see what happens."
"Try it if you get a chance!"
"Served in a snifter, the KBS pours dark brown/black with a very small brown head which went away pretty fast. Lacing is good. It smells like coffee, oak, bourbon, vanilla and dark/bitter chocolate. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but there's also some roasted malt, licorice and molasses too. Mouthfeel is medium/full, and it's creamy, smooth and oily. The low carbonation makes the drinkability of this beer excellent. The alcohol is well hidden, I can't notice it at all so it's easy for me to start taking bigger gulps of the beer instead of little sips. I think this is an excellent beer, it's one of if not the best beer I've ever had. It definitely lives up to the hype, if you ever get the chance to try KBS, you should!"
"Cheers2Beers"
"A good beer, but still not my favorite from Founders. Could probably use some aging to mellow it a bit, but still, this beer is an experience that needs to be sipped slow."
"Bottle courtesy from CBA and Moejuck: Poured a deep black color stout with a small foamy head with limited retention but some lacing. Aroma of coffee and vanilla is well balance and even more so then the regular version. Taste was a nice and well balance mix between some coffee, vanilla and light bourbon. The alcohol was hidden and didnt overpower the beer, coffee was well balance as oppose to the regular version and body was oily with a full texture. I have to admit to being quite impressed with this after having been totally disappointed by the regular version."
"Wow, what an interesting brew! I must thank my girlfriend who gave me a 4 pack as part of my birthday gift. I don't know what to say about this beer that hasn't been said. It is like nothing else yet delicious. Founders really pushes the envelope with this one. If you get the opportunity you owe it to yourself to try this one."
"Interesting anyway."
"Look, this is a fine beverage, but we have to draw the line somewhere. Smirnof Ice is brewed with malt, does that make it a beer? There is nothing beery about this beverage. It is an Irish-American coffee malternative."
"Drinkability - A real sipper. The alcohol is definitely there, but it's not distracting. Now there's something that would be nice to have around"
"Pours an absolutely opaque black, no light visible, thick brown head forms, wicked lacing, settles down to a pretty layer, very sticky. Smell is heavenly, roast coffee, lots of dark chocolate, fruits, toffee, bourbon, bit of alcohol, oaky vanilla, more coffee roast, insane rich and amazing. Taste is insane roasty goodness, like fresh espresso, lots of vanilla, bourbon, oak, chocolate, more espresso, toffee, some dark fruits, tiny amount of alcohol, more espresso and more vanilla, fucking fantastic. Mouthfeel is full bodied, nice and thick, low carbonation, very coating, nice alcohol warming. Easily the best oak aged beer I've had. Captures it perfectly, amazing harmony between the beer and barrel. Way too drinkable, just an insane beer, deserves its accolades and then some. Thanks Derek and Nate!!!"
"This is one hell of a beer. I'm gonna leave it at that. Thanks to Founders for this offering. My first perfect 5 beer."
"drinkability is great. the alcohol is balanced quite well, mostly showing as warmth on the way down. complex and enjoyable. having sampled a 2003 founders imperial stout about this time last year (thanks DrJay!), i can only imagine what this will be like in a few years. i think i'm going to try and hide one away and revisit it in 2010."
"Taste- So many flavors, the bitter sweet chocolate, the tangy hops, citrus and dark fruits, coffee, roasted malt, bourbon. Amazing!"
"I didn't think the '06 lived up to the hype, but the '07 is very good."
"Drinkability: Holy crow - I could drink this all night. It's got such a complex aroma and flavor profile. I just can't get bored drinking this. I could, however, get bored being broke from buying enough to make this a session brew, so I'll dial back from an otherwise perfect drinkability score."
"Drinkability: I just read on BA that ""This stout is brewed with a hint of coffee and vanilla then aged in oak bourbon barrels for over a year."" Hint of coffee? It would have been more accurate if they said it was brewed with 2 pounds of roasted coffee beans per bottle! Where was the vanilla? If it was there, it was completely covered up with the dark roasted flavors and alcohol. Not the cheapest and most available beer out there, but damn if it isn't hella good! I know it's strong, but I sure could go for another bottle. Not after this one, but in the near future. If you got the money, it's worth a try at least once."
"Tasted like old, stale coffee with whiskey mixed in, and alcohol was prevalant. Taste was very disappointing."
"Pours black with a thin brownish head. The smell as almost all coffee with a little bourbon. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and is quite dry. The taste is equally balanced between bourbon and coffee. The bitterness doesn't really kick in until the aftertaste, but it quite strong. Overall this is a great American Double Stout. I've been looking out for this one for a long time and have not been disappointed."
"Oh, my. What a fabulous beer. Small sample pour among friends from a single bottle. Pours a thick, jet-black. Not much in the way of head, but not missing it either. Aroma is amazing... full of aromatic medium-roast coffee, mocha-vanilla and some bourbon-oak. Flavor equally stunning... chocolate, aromatic coffee tending toward dryish/bitter coffee, the sweetish ""creamy"" notes of the vanilla and oak and bourbon like a good ""irish coffee"" perhaps? Feels big and thick, making this a real nice slow sipper of a beer. At $8/12oz this is heresy, but I totally want to do something with this to serve in a dessert dish, perhaps it turns into a ""foam"" to top a creme brulee? or a sauce to moisten a bit of chocolate cake w/ fruit as another guest suggested? I don't know, something. I am having one of those ""god, I gotta use this"" foodie reactions that don't happen all that often, showing my excitement. This was absolute stout heaven."
"Cheers!"
"This is one beer that legitimately lives up to its inflated reputation. Next year, with luck, I'll try one with breakfast."
"Pours inky black with a smallish dark brown head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is coffee, chocolate, and alcohol. Taste is dominated by the coffee, but the bourbon/oak flavor gives it a very nice nuance. Chocolates and vanilla also lurk in the background. I am not a coffee person, but this was pretty good. Mouthfeel was creamy and exceptional. I was surprised to be able to drink the whole thing since I am not a fan of coffee at all, but this was a pleasant change of pace for me. Very nice."
"Nice work Founders. Keep it up."
"Mouthfeel was full with some hops zippiness. This was an easy drinking formidible stout."
"Fresh 07 bottle courtesy of hoppymeal - thanks Derek! Pours a deep, dark brown - almost black and a little oily. A light brown head foams up about a half-inch, but diminishes quickly. Some of it clings to the glass and provides a nice lacing effect, though - something I find in most Founders beers. Similar to the regular breakfast stout in aroma with big chocolate malts and dark roasted coffee at the forefront with a faint smokieness of wood and bourbon in the background. Huge coffee flavor still dominates, but is smoothed out and creamier with hints of vanilla. Extremely balanced, smooth and slightly chewy on the palate with just moderate amounts of carbonation. The bourbon really makes more of a presence as the beer warms, but it still maintains its incredible balance and smoothness. Very, very drinkable and some of the coffee bitterness has mellowed. I really like what the wood did for this one. Definitely a beer that lives up to its reputation. Im glad I have more and some in the cellar from last years batch."
"Cheers."
"A very nice stout. I'm surprised at the smooth blending of flavor. Very tasty. Although there certainly is alcohol, it is well hidden for an enjoyable stout experience."
"D: First sip I wasnt impressed at all. This is one of those beers that definitely grows on you. In all honesty, I could certainly use some more bourbon characterI think it would have balanced well with the rest of the flavors. Its a great stout but I dont think its the best."
"Poured a thick, blackish-brown, but appeared on the syrupy side. Head development was fairly minimal, maybe 1/8 of an inch, but this exhibited a very nice, deep brown color. Smell is malty with a good presence of roasted malt and coffee aromas. Definitely some volatile characteristics owing to the bourbon aging and high abv. Taste is simply exceptional yet complex. Bitter, semi-sweet chocolate and coffee flavors. Hint of vanilla and alcohol. Very good and nicely balanced. While very thick and syrupy, this beer goes down quite smooth. I had to pace myself so that I could savor it fully. Overall, one of the best stouts that I've ever tried and highly recommended."
"This is a world class beer. Not quite the bittersweet candydance of the regular Breakfast stout (and therefore less suited to a morning meal), but still immensely powerful, complex, smooth, and drinkable."
"D: Virtually zero alcohol heat despite it's abv, but perhaps just a tad too much coffee - I could easily have too many of these without realizing it if I didn't know better."
"D: Drinkability if off the charts. Sure it's packing 10% but with the myriad of things going on in this beer, you soon forget all about the abv and just sip and savor this unbelievable treat. Imagine taking everything that's noteworthy about Breakfast Stout and Founders Imperial Stout, tweak the recipe slightly, and adding the extreme goodness of bourbon barrel ageing. This is what you end up with...perfection!"
"I have found solice in say, Bell's Expedition or Brooklyn BCS (the latter being highly reasonable and just as satisfying in complexity) so go out and judge for yourself."
"This beer is amazingly easy to drink. An exceptional beer!"
"Let me start off by saying, ""Holy Hell"" this is one amazing beer! Pours a dark, viscous, dark brown color with minimal head. Smell is of roasted stout with the perfect amount of bourbon aging. Ive had a lot of bourbon aged beers and this is the only one that has hit the blend perfectly. Taste is incredible. A very good underlying stout that features very good coffee/cocoa flavoring, again with the perfect blend of bourbon aging. Its nice to finally experience a beer that is more than worthy of the hype."
"Very well done and fails to disappoint this stout lover! Believe the hype."
"D- Absolutly delicious to smell and taste. The bourbon aspects do bring out the alcohol instead of masking it, but I wish I had more than one bottle to savor."
"D: A well crafted stout. Creamy and rich with a nice complexity that makes this brew interesting. I am glad I got to try this hard to find beer."
"Prosit und Zum Wohl. MK"
"A friend traveling to Michigan picked me up several 4 packs and boy what a treat. Poured motor oil black with a frothy toasty brown head that left great retention. The aroma of bourbon was up front with hints of vanilla, dark prune and dates somewhere lost in the middle and a heavy scent of burnt coffee towards the end. What I smell is what I taste. The body was full almost thick, syrupy and softly carbonated with one hell of a bourbon alcohol feel on my palate. Careful, at 10% ABV this brew will creep up on you as it did to me after my third one of the night. Overall, Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout is among one of the best brews I've had. Thanks and Enjoy."
"Wow, this beer lived up to all the hype for me. Luckily, I have a case, so I'll be able to see how it develops with some age. It'll be hard to improve on this though. I don't think there's any doubt the Founders is the king of stouts."
"This is a very good complex stout. A couple cups of this in the morning might make for an interesting day!"
"Drinkability- Had hopes this would be my first ""5" beer, but the scent totally turned me off. But then the taste turned me on again. A very solid brew worth drinking many a time and not smelling."
"I had this recently on tap at Founders Brewery, so I picked up a bottle to bring home and rate. Beer pours almost like motor oil, black as night and viscous. There is also a one finger, brown-tan head. Smell is a mix of coffee, bourbon, and chocolate. The coffee is most prominent. The same is true of the taste, coffee is the most obvious flavor, but chocolate and bourbon are also present. The alcohol is well hidden in the complex taste. The mouthfeel is full-bodied with almost no carbonation. This is as drinkable as beers this intense get. ""Kentucky Breakfast Stout"" is quite the appropriate name for this beer. If I was a big fan of coffee and drinking in the morning, this would be my breakfast for sure."
"D: Quite good, but not worth the hype in my opinion. The taste is good, but nothing special, and the alcohol is a bit hot."
"This is one helluva beer...all I can say is coffee coffee coffee...I have one more bottle and you can bet I will be saving it for a special morning."
"earned my Mug with this review!"
"So this beer pours a nice deep opaque black, that lets no light though. It also tops off with a nice deep tan head that is very dense, and laces very nicely. So this is where this beer went WAAAY down hill for me. This beer starts off with that obvious deep coffee grain aroma, that has the hint of paper, and some grass to it. not hops, but that old musty grass. Oh the The bourbon barrel comes up from the rear with the hickory aroma as well. Of course there is the standard chocolate, molasses, licorice, and well the standards. But damn, that coffee/musty smell has got to go. Its not balanced, and... it just has to go. The aromas transfer to the flavor unfortunatly and make this beer damn near undrinkable. Leaves a very unpleasant taste of cardboard along with the aforementioned aromas that make up the taste. Man, this is rough. The mouthfeel is nice. it Starts off with a nice smooth creamy feeling. Little bit of carbination. Leaves no residue. Its just nice. Now for the drinkability. I just have to say that this beer is way, WAAAYY over-hyped. It should be in the top, 50, but not the top ten, or thirty for that matter. I am not a fan."
"Poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. Very thick, almost syrupy pour that is topped off by a little bit of lacing. This is one dark beer - pitch black & beautiful. The smell is dominated by espresso & high quality espresso at that with a bit of vanilla in the background. Complex is the best way to describe the taste - espresso, dark chocolate, vanilla, and a little sugary sweetness. A nice tasting beer, but the taste cannot live up to the smell. Mouthfeel is disappointing - the carbonation adds to the complexity, but I would like more creaminess here. All of that said, this is a highly drinkable stout - perfect for dessert on its own or paired with any number of sweets. Highly recommended."
"note: I love that the number 4 beer on BA comes from my home city. I can have it whenever I want right from the brewer's tap!"
"D- The richness of this thing was a little much. I am sure this will be even better the second time around now that I have had one to tease my palate a bit."
"Taste is creamy, chocolatey, oakey, coffee/caramel whiskey."
"The carbonation was perfect. I can't believe this beer is 10% - it's dangerously drinkable at that level. This beer is a superior example of complimentary flavors, most notably stout, chocolate, and coffee."
"The mouth is preffy full, could be a little thicker, but beautifully smooth and warm, just enough carbonation, pretty darn nice. Now, let me just say that I am no fan of bourbon, but here it melds perfectly into a stouty perfection that is just fantastic."
"I opened this bottle from the 2006 bottling last night as i became worried it might not age very well and decided i didn't want to let it go to waste. Served at cellar temp. Poured perfectly black with a tawnt brown head and great lacing. Clumpy oily foam bits in the head. Odor is slightly oxidized bitter chocolate and copper. Chocolate bourbon odor becomes more prominent as the beer warms. This appears to have been the only part of the beer that has suffered from age. Taste remains fantastic. Can i give this a 6 out of 5 please? The chocolate and slight bitter malt combine smoothly with the warming alcohol to create almost a truffle-like deliciousness. hints of creamy vanilla more prominent on the finish. super thick and almost foamy mouthfeel. To sum up, it's changed slightly with a year's aging...mostly in the nose, but its still sensational and i'll be buying as much as i can when i see it next."
"Overall a delicious beer that deserves it's rank as #3 on BA. It's also pretty nice that I can just drive a few miles and get this whenever I want, if it's on tap that is. :)"
"This beer has already garnered iconic status, and deservedly so. I'm proud to know it's from a brewery 45 minutes from my house also. As I type this, a roundly balanced resonance of premium bourbon flavor is lining the inside of my cheeks. I'm so glad I stocked-up on this 'cause I can't see making my way through winter without it. Utterly superb! Merry Christmas!"
"D - I wish I had an everlasting glass of this nectar of the gods."
"This is one amazing beer, it looks as great as the other reviews and if you are a stout drinker, it's a must try beer."
"Overall this is a nice well balanced, flavorful beer. Awesome."
"Wow! This is one fine American Double Stout! A couple of these for breakfast would certainly precipitate an early nap, with no complaints from me!"
"The Verdict: An awesome beer, worthy of the hype. Derek: You're the man, I owe you one."
"Shipped to NC by dirtylou sometime late last winter (please send more). Notched about 1/3 of the way across the top of the label...some dating code...whatever it means (February?)"
"JesseDaniels is a beer pimp and is owed undying gratitude by me for sharing this little bundle of liquid charcoal joy."
"D - I originally thought this was bourbon barrel aged Breakfast Stout but the notes up top say different. The one I am reviewing is about a year old and the heavy coffee flavor I got when it was fresh has mellowed which is a good thing in my opinion not being a huge coffee fan. This one needs a little more mouthfeel but is exceptional otherwise."
"I had been sitting on this bottle for a few months now and only opened this one tonight because I recently received another one in trade (maximum respect to hoppymeal for that one!). I am so terribly glad that I did. This most certainly must be one of the most beautiful beers available in the world today. Nothing short of peerless."
"Drinkability- A very big and flavorful beer. Delicous and enjoyable, but this is definitely a sipping beer. The bourbon taste made it hard to quaff, but still damn good."
"Smells and tastes bourbon with roasted malt. Very thick mouth feel, and dark black color. Largest serving available is only 8 ounces on tap, and served in sniffer. More like an after dinner cigar than a beverage. I appreciate the quality, but wouldn't buy this again, I didn't taste the hops."
"Poured to a used motor oil black with dark tan head, that lingered a while, then reduced to lkay lacing. This was the only thing about this beer that could have been better. Aroma was an excellent blend of sweet malt chocolate and toffee, with a nice bourbon-alcohol background. Flavor of this thick-bodied beer was also a perfect mixture of sweetness and bourbon. This all led to a long, smooth, warming finish, with a mild alcohol, similar to a shot of Makers Mark."
"D: An incredible beer... a sipper in small portions and not for the faint of heart. I'm very glad to have tried this one and recommend to anyone who has a chance to get some. Won't be forgotten..."
"Drinkability - this is a very intense beer, and while I like some of the bourbon barrel styles, this one is a little too wound up for me."
"On tap at Dilly Deli at the Founders tasting. Pours a pitch black with a thin tan foamy head. Head disappears quickly. Aromas of chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, and coconut. Deep rich chocolate flaovr, coffee, a bit oaky, with vanilla as well. Bourbon is subtle, not overwhelming. Medium body, maybe even a bit thin for a beer of this magnitude. A lot of great flavors going on here. Somewhat warming, but the alcohol is not overbearing. Very nice. Thanks to Founders for bringing this treat on tap!"
"Poured a nice black color, with hues of red when held to the light. Tan colored head with a tid bit of lacing. Smell was very nice, fresh roasted coffee with a hint of vanilla and some nice wood and bourbon notes as well. Taste was even better. The coffee started out but quickly I noticed a nice wooden and bourbon flavor, paired with vanilla and hints of cocoa. Mouthfeel had low carbonation and was on the lighter side of full bodied, but still relatively thick. I'd love to have more of this and look forward to getting some when it's released again. If you see any of this on the shelves, run, don't walk and grab all that you can."
"The mouthfeel was thick and chewy, really nice. Overall I'm glad I tried it, but it's too big to drink too often so it's no problem that it's brewed like once a year."
"Might not want to start my day with this, but its a damn fine way to end it."
"Breakfast is on! And trbeer is a cookin' ! Thanks! I owe some waffles and coffee next time around..."
"Drinkability: This is a wonderful stout to contemplate as an after dinner sipper"
"Very easy drinking."
"I could see myself buying this again and again. This is a true gem."
"This was very good for this relatively cool rainy evening."
"Poured an opaque black color with a small tan head, that left light lacing on the glass, Aroma of vanilla, tons of roasted malt, espresso, with smokey malts, nuts, and faint dried fruits. Taste of more roast, chocolate malts, vanilla beans, nuts, dry wood, and faint bourbon... a touch of alcohol in the finish."
"Huge coffee and chocolate... good alcohol burn... some raisin and balsamic flavors. Very good... VERY good flavor."
"Taste is dark and roasty, much more so than I'm used to in stouts. This is tasty - notes of bourbon, coffee and vanilla. This is a delicious brew, just not my favorite example of the style."
"Overall, this is an outstanding beer. Try it. My only complaint was that my one beer trip turned into a 2 beer trip at the Sunset as I had to order another KBS."
"This beer is scary if it is really 10% ABV. The brewers did a masterful job of concealing the alcohol. Drinking it is like drinking liquid velvet. Just smooth, rich, relaxing and warming. All sorts of chocolate tones, coffee flavors, raisins, and prunes. However, what really makes the flavor in this beer is the presence of cream and vanilla. Like drinking a milk shake--but not as cold and with alcohol. Mouthfeel is smooth with a texture like licking velvet I would imagine. Just so smooth and rich. I had to drag myself out of the bar without ordering another."
"Drinkability: Awesome - this beer has made me rethink my opinion of barrel aging. I can't wait to try this on-tap tomorrow in the lead up to the Great Taste. One of the smoothest, most drinkable beers I've ever had."
"D- This tastes so damn good which makes it very, very drinkable. Try it if you can find it."
"Huge body, smooth and very nice. Not a summer beer, but I'll never turn down the opportunity."
"Opaque black color. Full light brown foam. Sensational nose which combines the characteristics of the original beer (intense coffee, roast and chocolate) and the barrel (vanilla, coconut, oak) to create a smell that is pure bliss, resembling a melting Snickers bar. Flavor, unfortunately, was a bit of a let down. It just didnt seem very concentrated and full, not as intense and gripping as the nose promised."
"(and thanks to AKSP!)"
"Drinkability is superb. This is just a lip smacking good stuff. This beer has fallen down a few points from the initial release, which saddens me. I had many a four pack of this in the prime of this beer's life and I am sad to report that it is starting to make a decline. Drink this now if you have it. I am confident that this brew, when fresh off the dock, was at least as good as any beer that ever crossed my lips. I have graded it as such. This is surely worthy of the acclaim it has received. I only hope there are subsequent barrlels of it, and that everyone will be able to enjoy this as fresh as possible. A truly mindblowing experience for lovers of the stout style and your mama."
"You know, this is a good beer but in the end it's a disappointment. There aren't the kind of oaky or bourbon characters I'd have expected in a barrel aged stout. Side by side there may be differences between the Breakfast Stout but it just didn't warrant the fanfare. Either the stout needed more barrel aging, the barrels needed more residual whiskey or perhaps a coffee heavy stout just isn't a good candidate for the process."
"Oh yeah! Kentucky Breakfast is rich and bold. If you don't like coffee, you won't enjoy the KY Breakfast. This is not a beer I'd take to a party. I'm a little greedy."
"This is a beer that deserves all the hype that it gets. This beer is awesome and I will definetly buy this beer again regerdless of the price. And I recommend all BA's who haven't had this beer get their hands on some of it."
"Thanks again, AlohaC"
"This brew pours a used motor oil black color. The head is small, about one centimeter in height, and tan in color. Lacing is thin at best. The aroma is outstanding; one of the best I have ever smelled. Coffee, chocolate, toffee, bourbon. Nothing is dominant over then other aroma, instead everything works in harmony with each everything else. The taste is like the aroma, but a bit more intense. The mouthfeel is full bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this is one of (if not) the best bourbon aged beers I have ever had. I really like the way the bourbon has been added to the stout rather than taking the stout over entirely."
"The beer gurgles from the 12-ounce brown bottle a soot black, the head is thick and creamy, the color a deep chocolate, the size perfect, as it slowly erodes the laces forms a thick concealing blanket to surround the glass. Nose is steeped with toasted grain, hints of chocolate and a touch of Bourbon barrel sourness, quite mouth watering. Start is somewhat sweet with a rich grain profile, the top rich and full in feel. Finish has a nice acidity, the hops plentiful and the deep roasted grain flavor sits long on the palate, a sure fire winner in my book."
"Pours jet black with a small brown head. Quickly fading, no lacing. The aroma is bourbon, vanilla, coffee, molases, chocolate, plenty of roast with some dark fruits in there as well. Flavor is moderately sweet, plenty of roast, lots of vanilla, light bourbon, lots of dark matl flavors come into play, molases, chocolate, toffee as well as raisins and prunes. The mouthfeel is full, oily, soft and smooth, with a very long, slightly warm finish. ABV is well hidden. I must admit, I was sceptacle of a top 50 bourbon BA beer, but this was nicely done."
"Bourbon is an American taste and while some finds its way over here, it's simply a novelty. This is a medium or possibly less thick stout. I guess my expectations were primed for the breakfast level of stout. I taste the stout, the bourbon, some roast, a tad coffee. It's a nice stout to drink with some different flavouring.With great appreciation to Putnam for allowing me to buy the last bottle in the store, hidden away for someone like me."
"Give me a little bit of head on this beer that lasts for over a minute, and this is pure black gold. Solid gold. One of the best beers I've had in a while."
"D: No, you couldn't keep pounding these, but it's a lovely, awesome beer to drink. I love drinking it, and I'm so happy to live in the city in which it's brewed."
"Drinkability is good. This is a great beer but its upfront nature limit this to no more than one a night for me. I definately would like more, just not tonight. Extremely well done, I like it much better than the original breakfast stout."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1/4"" dark brown head over an opaque dark brown/black brew. Head fades pretty quick, to an uneven layer of bubbling, with minimal yet present lacing. Aroma is coffee, bourbon and vanilla, just as I expected. Taste is sweet coffee upfront, which immediately is coupled with hearty bourbon, with touches of vanilla and oak. A whole lot of throat warming going on here. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, and drinkability is excellent for the style. Wow, this beer lives up to the hype."
"Anyone thinking of offering me this in a trade is strongly encouraged. This beer was a truly wonderful experience. Not immensely complex like a top-notch quad. Just tasty and well balanced."
"They drink used motor oil for breakfast in Kentucky? Odd. Perfect appearance for a stout, as black as you could get, with a creamy full maroon head. Smells like a shot of whiskey with dark chocolate, coffee and maybe a little smoke. Taste is rich, strong, whiskey and coffee are all over the place, yet smooth and concise, working well together. Dark chocolate and espresso are also in the mix. Drinkability is perfect, I will enjoy abd appreciate every sip of this all the way down. Can't get enough of those barrel aged beers. Big thanks to AKSmokedPorter for the bottle."
"Powerful. Complex. Alcoholic. And yet it is damn drinkable. This is yet another amazing beer from Founders. Michigan is golden for great beer. While I might prefer Breakfast Stout I am very, very grateful that RedHaze graciously supplied me a bottle of this succulent beer. I hope I can try this again I really like it. But, really, who wouldnt? It is big and beefy but with plenty of complexity and depth. Highly Recommended."
"Received from BA orbitalr0x as part of BIF 33, this much anticipated beer came in a stubby bottle with a label design reminiscent of bygone time. When poured, the deep brown opaque body aided by a mocha colored, one finger thick, foamy head was inviting and imposing at the same time. The aroma was heavily laden with dark roasted coffee and freshly hewn oak. I took a half a point off for the smell being a little too acrid, and lacking either the chocolate or dark fruit undertones of other imperial stouts. The taste was naturally coffee driven as well, with the Bourbon barrel aging providing a smoother, and drier feel than was expected in a stout of this strength. The vanilla like oak tannins and the substantial hop and roast grain bitterness came through much clearer towards the end of each sip, before being subdued by the eventual warmth of the peppery ethanol. The mouthfeel was abundantly thick and just a hair short of chewy. The hefty punch of alcoholic strength made this a fine late night digestif, but detracted from the drinkability a little. If you drink this at breakfast, call in sick and go back to bed till noon."
"Pours a midnight black color, minimal head, as expected by the ABV. Aroma is charcoal like, some oaky character there as well. Taste is burnt, with a hint of high alcohol. Taste is good, a touch astringant from the oak, but that's to be expected. Kind of puckering. Charcoal again on the taste. Mouthfeel is good, but thin, probably the bourbon coming through. Drinkability is okay, but this isn't my favorite barrel aged beer."
"Slàinte!"
"This one is worthy of its hype, a true masterpiece that is an ultimate sipper."
"12 ounce bottle, thanks AKSmokedPorter (justcas I will get to the bottle you sent me soon enough!)!"
"Despite my recent ability to fully appreciate Scotch, I would rather have the Imperial stout over this (Founder's brews a truly world-class Impy, IMO). One bottle is like an entire meal. If you really want to taste the bourbon in this, let it warm up to ~58F."
"This was purchased for $6 a bottle at Binny's in Glen Ellynn, IL (best store in the world). I would have missed it completely if one of the guys I speak with there all the time hadn't pointed it out. The label didnt stick out to me at first. This is one of my favorite beers, and it is hard to get. Binny's is completely out. I hope this isnt the last time I get to enjoy this fine beer."
"Thick black pour, beautiful dark tan crust, with a fair lace. Intense aroma of fresh coffee grounds, much like the original, but with an added hint of the bourbon sweetness and light chocolate in the background. The alcohol is not very detectable. The taste is not as overpowering as I expected. Smokey coffee blended with bourbon ending with a moderate bitter finish. Alcohol appears more strongly now but doesn't detract. The mouthfeel is semi-thick, with nice subtle carbonation. There is an intense smoothness present likely due to the barrel aging. Drinkability is good. I would love to have access to this beer anytime, although I think one per sitting would be recommended."
"The smell of this beer is the first thing you notice--really wonderful, strong coffee scent. Taste is rich, complex with coffee flavors dominant, but also chocolate and others present. The alcohol flavor is actually quite mild given the high ABV, with a beautiful combination of rich flavor and light mouthfeel. Very highly recommended, and deserving of its place in the Beer advocate top 10. I would only put 1 or 2 other stouts in its camp."
"Too bad the bottles did not make it to our area...there is always hope for next year."
"my first experience with the Kentucky breakfast and i dare say it was nothing short of perfect. everywhere I though the regular breakfast stout lacked, or fell shy of perfect, this beer improved on. huge aromas of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, hints of bourbon, cinammon, pastries. huge flavors of the same. incredible chew in the mouth, huge full body, coating. extrememly balanced, no booze to be found anywhere. unbelievably drinkable for such a huge and high alcohol beer. i put down 4 with total ease and sheer joy. this is truly an amazing brew. i hesitate to even try and describe it. thats it, im done. excellent."
"KBS is extremely drinkable and perfect to sip and savor from a snifer as one would a fine whiskey. I found the bourbon flavors pronounced, but still not quite as much as they were at the EFB. Although ""only"" about 9% ABV the beer drinks and smells greater than that. Very enjoyable and one I hope to have again even if it means a trip to Mich."
"So, so very yummy. This one is all sweet chocolate, and it is the type of thing that I could keep drinking all day. The mouthfeel was full and creamy, but not overbearing at all. It was a superb beer, and blows the regular Founders Breakfast Stout away."
"Only my respect for alcohol prevents my opening a second bottle. Looking forward to seeing how this cellars."
"Not a bad beer at all, still not sure if I like this or the original more however."
"Got two bottles from a 4-pack. The label looks like an old-fashioned tonic with it claiming to cure numerous diseases and ailments. I poured it into an open-faced sniffer to drink. Very little carbonation and pours a thick, black, motor-oil. Immediate aroma of alcohol and a deep roast. No real head due to the low carbonation. Their is a deep flavor with a strong chocolate tone. Very thick, almost like a cream liqueor. The chocolate and roast flavors dominate a first with some late alcohol ""tingling"" and definite oak flavors. Very delicious"
"tasty. translates well into the bottle. a real winner from founders. age might help this one too... we'll see."
"-UF"
"You get a full dose of coffee/espresso and burnt malt flavor you're craving. Full bodied and thick, goes down smooth, easy, and complex."
"Equally good, in a different way from the regular breakfast stout. The coffee flavor isn't as apparent, but the bourbon really shines in this example. It's a shame this is so hard to come by."
"The beer is complex in its sheer proportions of relatively few dominant flavors, yet simple in its intent. Coffee- Cocoa- Malt- Hops. And it succeeds at every faucet. It has earned its way onto the worlds greatest beers and rightfully so."
"12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a jet black color with virtually no head. There's no lacing as well. The actual beer really coats the glass though. The smell is full of roasted malt and coffee, that's it. Smells like a big ol' pot of joe, fresh roasted. Such a huge aroma! The taste is also full of coffee, actually almost tastes more like a spiked coffee than a beer. If it wasn't for the roasted malt present, I probably wouldn't know the difference. It's the best of both worlds. Tasty. The mouthfeel is super thick, and heavy on the tongue. The drinkability is great for a 10% brew. A big shout out to Kev for sharing this."
"light carbonation and a smooth, slick mouthfeel. sweetened, nutty coffee, bourbon , vanilla and alcohol in the flavor. finishes with a coffee (what else?) bitterness and some alcohol sweetness. a great beer but definitely one to be enjoyed in small doses."
"Man was I glad to get my hands on some of this,pours a opaque black with a quick to form mocha colored head that was gone quite fast,oh the aromas the bourban barrel shows thru with its oaky,vanilla tones that match perfectly with the highly roasted somewhat dry earthiness and bitter chocolate notes of the beer its a 5 no doubt.Flavors all come together in near perfection the oakiness is more subdued on the palate wich is nice I dont like overpowering wood flavors like some beers aged in wood have,anyways the complexities are immense vanilla,unsweetened chocolate ,roasty malt,earth,and even a light note of malted milk.What can I say its awesome Iam gonna savor the 8 I have for sure."
"Notes: After a side-by-side tasting, I prefer the regular BS. This is more subtle and smooth, but lacks the boldness of its un-aged version."
"Dark chocolate, roasted coffee, vanilla, and bourbon flavors slap you in the face on the first sip. I really love the bourbon character and the thick wood overtones..it easily could come off as ""overdone", but I think it comes together perfectly. Incredible coating mouthfeel. I actually enjoyed this more than the original Founders Breakfast Stout, if you can believe it. Certainly a must try."
"Overall impression: By far one of the best barrel-aged stouts out there. That being said, most of them stink. I can't imagine having more than one of these and thankfully, I split the 12oz. bottle. You should definitely give this a try as it's one of the better examples out there. Still, it would be nice to have one that's more balanced between the stout and the bourbon. If Founder's beers aged better, I would say stick this one away for a couple years. Glad I had the chance to try it."
"Im impressed. A case of this might turn me into a Bourbon Barrel convert. Drinkability isnt all there but the appearance, which I have neglected to touch on is great. Pours like crude with minimal brown, splotchy lacing and cream trails. Well worth the price."
"12 oz bottle pours a thick jet black with a small brown head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Strong bourbon aroma with chocolate and coffee. Coconut, cake, vanilla, chocolate, bourbon and coffee flavors. Full bodied with a oily thick mouthfeel, finishes sweet, very nice."
"Not a full-bodied or thick as the regular breakfast stout. Still, I had no problems finishing this one. A close 2nd behind the regular Breakfast Stout in my book."
"Founder's is one hell of a brewery."
"I cant thank you enough MABZ for parting with such a great beer. I dont know if I would have been able to do the same."
"Pours really thick into a pint glass. The color is black, almost totally black with hints of light appearing on the edges. A small tan head forms that slowly laces down. The aroma is in a word, WOW! Coffee and chocolate blended with scents of bourbon, lets just say I like it alot. The taste is just as impressive, the coffee and chocolate malt hit the palate, then the boubon comes in with caramel and vanilla flavors. In the mouth it is thick and syrupy, coating the palate, the leaving that warm feeling of in the back of the throat that bourbon has. This is a very impressive beer, drink slowly, these flavors are meant to be enjoyed gradually. It is nice to see a beer getting intense flavor from something other than hops, not that there is anything wrong with that."
"Drinkability is VERY good. Very well rounded. I'm happy I splurged for a four pack but I'm afraid I can't afford to drink it as much as I might like to, based on the price of $17.99 a four pack."
"Pour is absolutely black-hole, petroleum, midnight black with a finger and a half of dark cappuccino, rocky head and thick lacing all the way down. Nose is an aromatic explosion of oak, vanilla, bourbon, caramel and coffee. Taste lives up to the smell with a hearty Kentucky-style bourbon kick flanked by hearty notes of oaky vanilla, rich caramel, and a few shots of espresso. Mouthfeel is gooey, chewy and somehow still smooth and creamy. Breakfast Stout's bigger, badder, unbridled brother from down South. Hell of a beer, wish it wasn't so rare/expensive, but a delicious treat nonetheless."
"Finally found my note from teh Extreme Beer Fest. This brew is exceptional..and a bargain! only one ticket!!! Pours black and extremely inviting. Taste is oak, wine-like, but smoooth. For a 10 abv, this is unbelievable. The mouthfeel is rounded, smooth and extremely nice. Drinks like a much lower abv. A must try."
"Beer is good. Happy coffee beer for breakfast beering."
"Deep black color with a medium brown head that disappears steadily. Thin spotty lacing. Aroma of espresso, caramel and bourbon. Thick and oily with a strong coffee character, as well as roasted malt, oak and dark chocolate flavors. Bourbon/whiskey is there throughout and adds a nice dimension rather than being a distraction as seems to happen sometimes. The finish is bitter with coffee and a light alcohol burn. Enjoyable for sure, although a bit on the pricey side."
"ng"
"If you can get your hands on this beer buy as much as you can. If you don't like it... I'll take it off your hands."
"Overall this is a beer I'll cherish , drinking them one by one every six months from the cellar."
"You might not think of this style beer one that is easy to stomach but it is so well balanced and smooth that it goes down nice and easy."
"Deep black color topped by a thin tan head. The head was deep for a tan, and had what seemed to be wine colored highlights. I recently tried the standard breakfast stout, and was surprised when this beer displayed even more coffee aroma. Lots of coffee, a little bitter chocolate, and a touch of vanilla. The flavor has lots of dark roast coffee, vanilla, a little sherry, light milk chocolate. Very delicious. Smooth, rich mouth feel, no alcohol heat. This is scary drinkable. Awesome beer."
"Beer pours jet black with a reddish brown head that quickly dissipates. Strong roasted malt scents mix with a sweet chocolatey aroma. The first taste brings vanilla followed by roasted coffee beans. The beer is not as thick as one might expect from the flavor and aroma. As the beer warms the vanilla aroma is more evident. This beer has a little more sweet flavor to it than their regular breakfast stout which helps to round out the roasted flavors and also helps to accentuate the vanilla flavor. Very well balanced and highly drinkable."
"Pitch black body with a small bubbly brown head. Speckles and strings of lace were left stuck to the glass. Big roasted malt notes with a mix of bourbon boozy notes and some dark chocolate come on strong. Taste start off with some sweet chocolate before the big roasty notes kick in. Bourbon and light woody notes blend in well and dont detract from this as in other bourbon barrel aged stouts I have tried. The finishes is quite warming with some booze and big roasty flavors. Slick on the palette and fairly thick but nothing amazing as it could use a bit more body. Good drinkability as well for such a strong brew. An interesting twist on the Breakfast Stout, I am not sure which one I like more. Both are great."
"One of the top 10 beers on the planet, even better than Stone RIS."
"12 oz bottle, split with my wife. My pour is 10-11 oz. The beer departs the bottle an incredible jet black color. A quarter inch tan head forms and falls to a very thin ring over the top immediately. As far as I can see, the beer is still, with no carbonation bubbling from the bottom. Nose brings an explosion of fresh and sweet coffee, mocha, almost like an iced latte. There is a nice creamy vanilla undertone, reminding me a lot of coffee ice cream. Other than the vanilla, I'm not really getting a lot of the bourbon character in the nose. Flavor brings the same intense coffee flavors as before. Holding some beer in my mouth, and swishing it, exchanging air with my sinuses, I get a lot of oaky and vanilla character from the bourbon. The strong coffee start moves to a caramel and chocolate infused sweetness with a moderate bourbony vanilla finish. Aftertaste is very light moderate hop bitterness, with a very solid sweetness carrying through leaving a nice residual sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, slightly syrupy and with just a kiss of carbonation, but nearly still. Very coating, with very good stay on the tongue. Excellent. There is no hint of the 10% ABV at all in the brew. The bourbon is present, but not dominating, blending with the flavor, not dictating. The Breakfast Stout really shines through this one, while marrying with the barrel aging. Founders wins again. I am glad to have a few more of this beauty."
"Mouthfeel is rich and chewy, but with a medium body and a certain smoothness. Goes down almost too easy with no evidence of the alcohol, except for the slight warming sensation in the belly. Simply an amazing beer that I would love to have on hand constantly if I could! A good evening sit and sip brew and another winner from Founders. Between this and the original Breakfast Stout....I'm in love."
"The Kentucky Breakfast definitely takes the game to another level, with an extremely well rounded full body, and almost unbeatable smoothness for a big bad stout like this one. Tasting envelops you in a malty morass of dark roastiness, fine cocoa, rich coffee, and oaty goodness, with a subtle undercurrent of bourbon lingering here and there. Mouthfeel is just tremendous, this really is almost a meal, and oh so drinkable. Alcohol is nigh undetectable and the finish is pleasantly sweet, with bourbon and vanilla lingering. Wow, this beer is really something, thanks much to CRJMellor for this one!"
"Inky, murky black. It blocks all the light in the room, put it that way. This brew also features a dark espresso coloured head of foam thta lasts and leaves massive legs/sheets of lacing. Aromas are all roasted malts, espresso, green/acidic hops, bourbon and oak! Taste is more of the same. The espresso notes are fantastic on this beer and the bourbon and oak flavors are well meshed and meld this one together into a fantastic drink! One of the best stouts i've had in the past few months, a real knockout. Mouthfeel is thick, and chewy. Drinkability is almost perfect, the abv and intense flavors top this from being an all 5er in my book though. Still on of the top 10, or top 5 imperial stouts on the market today! What a great freakin' brewery!"
"The bottom line is that Kentucky Breakfast hits the ball absolutely out of the park in terms of both flavour and overall quality. Easily one of the best beers I've ever had. This is the grand cham-peen of Founders impressive beer lineup."
"This is definitly the best stout I've ever tried, quite possibly the best overall BEER I've ever drunk."
"Drinkability is above average for this American Double Stout. Compared to their breakfast stout this is much better. I don't know if it's the additional aging or the actual bourbon flavor, but this is an outstanding beer."
"Inky black in color. Low carbonation level. Huge espresso aroma. Very subtle notes of dark chocolate and anise. Big espresso flavor backed with a lingering bourbon flavor. Big, big roasted malt flavor that is well matched to the coffee/bourbon. Hops? Where? None needed here. Velvety smooth moutfeel. Has a nice oily slickness to it. Very, very drinkable beer. An amazing combination of characteristics that brings the entire package home. Basically all I can say on this one is...F'in A!!!"
"Cheers"
"I'm finding this highly drinkable, and only it's richness and pricetag would keep me from putting down more than two of these in a sitting."
"The ability of founders to bring out such a wonderful oaked bourbon flavor without having the alcohol overpower the rich sweetness of the chocolate etc is remarkable. Founders has set the standard for barrel aged stouts. Period."
"I love it, and I'm so glad that my roommate timed his trip to MI when he did."
"This was also quite drinkable. The alcohol was noticeable but did not detract at all from my enjoyment. Much more of a flavor element than a burning one. 3 bottles were consumed over the course of the night with relative ease. I restrained myself from finishing off my 4 pack. I must go get more."
" Holy fu#kin shit! This lives up to all the hype, and is worth every penny I paid for it. Coffee and deeply roasted malt, with vanilla and bourbon, oak in the finish. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, foamy too. This is what they serve for breakfast in heaven."
"Caution: it may actually take two to tango."
"drinkability: so good, so easy"
"Pours from the bottle like old motor oil; black, high viscosity, low carbonation. Small head of brown foam was only present for a minute before fading away. Strong aromas of roasted dark chocolate, malts, coffee, whisky. Great. Taste is full bodied and powerful; flavors of coffee, malt, unsweetened dark chocolate, a touch of hops, warming alcohol notes likely from the bourbon ageing. Nice. Mouthfeel was thick and dense; liquid flavor-brick as I like to call it. The finish was warm, and the alcohol had the ever-so-light bite. Not wonderful drinkability, but darn good. Another winner from Founders, even if I do prefer the original Breakfast stout. Recommended nonetheless."
"pours a deep dark black with a 1 inch dark tan head in a snifter glass. poured vigourously to get 1 inch. head drops to a ring quickly, (typical of founders stouts) but it still laces well, and you just don't need it to keep the aroma lingering 'til the end. aroma is very pungent from the snifter with huge roasted malt, wood, coffee, chocolate and alcohol. oh, and yes, strong bourbon aromas. wonderful nose. something different dominates with each sniff. first sip goes through a wide array of flavors. burnt malt with earthy hops, coffee and chocolate. sweet tails off to a strong woody oak and bourbon flavored warming alcohol. this is the only way i can enjoy the flavor of bourbon. :) quite nice. dark chocolate tickles the sides of your tongue while a sweet vanilla lingers on the tip. back of the sip is woody like the lingering effects of having a toothpick in your mouth all night. aftertaste is bitter roasted coffee and a cashew-like bourbon alcohol. delish. mouthfeel is a nice medium-heavy body with light carbonation and a tongue tingling alcohol effect. rolls super smoothly and swallows just as smoothly. drinkability is quite good considering the abv. bourbon by itself makes me wrinkle my nose, but there's no stopping me here. easy drinking, but stop and savor this one. overall, this is a very delicious ADS. i've had several founders breakfast stouts, and maybe i had a bad batch, because this is soooo much better. i can taste resemblences, but this is in a league of it's own. it renews my faith in founders' stouts."
"Everything about this beer is dark. Pours syrupy black with dark tan head. Head doesn't last too long but aroma is strong enough to hold. Smells very close to regular Breakfast Stout. Side by side I don't think I could tell the two apart. Taste is also similar, but as it lingers in your mouth and warms, the Bourbon flavor comes out. Not overpowering at all but very smooth. Exceptional beer. Worth the hefty pricetag in my opinion."
"The price for a four pack is a bit steep, but if you can get a single for under $5, go for it."
"Inky black in color, with a half inch dark tan head. Fades quickly leaving some spotty lacing, and a oily like residue clinging to the glass. Beautiful aromas of coffee, chocolate, bourbon, wood, and vanilla. Every whiff just seems to get better. The taste mimics the smell, very complex, but oh so yummy. The boubon seems to tame some of chocolate and coffee flavors. Perfectly balanced and not heavy at all. Creamy smooth, and just a suttle hint of 10% abv. Very easy too drink, maybe two or three in one sitting. Worth the wait!!! If you like the Breakfast Stout, your gonna love this!!! Fantastic job!!!! Already looking foward to next years batch!!! Consider yourself lucky, if you can find it."
"beer is very drinkable."
"The Founder's Kentucky Breakfast Stout is an excellent mix of coffee, beer, and bourbon. The initial aroma is reminiscent of the regular Founder's Breakfast Stout, but there is something more to this beer. It pours into the glass in a thick, viscous motion, yet it lacks the overwhelming syrup-like quality that many strong stouts possess. At first taste there are strong hints of coffee which is then complimented by a smooth bourbon aftertaste. This is certainly one of the better coffee stouts that I have sampled, well worth the price per bottle. Founder's has produced yet another exceptional brew."
"Deep crude oil black with golden tan edges supports a small mocha head. A very small slick of film spans the interior of the dark brown ring of foam. Smells of whiskey and chocolate with hints of coffee. Flavor start sweet, almost cloyingly so, of molasses with brandy soaked chocolate covered cherries. Falvors of oak and bourbon accompany the malty chocolatey goodness and compliment it very well! Roast malt and coffee comes on after the bourbon leaving an aftertaste of bitter coffee. Awesomely complex. Body is full and oilly, but not too heavy and thick to have a large impact on drinkability. Carbonation is delicate, and almost ""green"". Wow, good uber-stout. If you like the bourbon-barell aging fad, GET SOME! Very very tasty, so I could drink the hell out of it, right up until that 10% abv knocked me on my ass. Strong both in flavor and alcohol, so it can't score pefectly on drinkability."
"BUY IT AT ALL COSTS!!!"
"This beer poured pitch black with no light getting through the dark mass. It formed a small dark tan bubbly head that faded fast and left only trace lace. The aroma was of malt, coffee/mocha and anise. The flavor was of malt, coffee, chocolate with a definate hint of burbon in the background. The body is rather light for the style and the finish is slightly dry with a warming affect of the alcohol. Another good beer from Founders."
"Drinkability: This beer is Founders master piece. This is a very drinkable beer bordering on perfection. I drank one then ran out and bought somemore for later."
"D: Big, bold & beautiful. Obviously not a session brew."
"I love this beer. They said they'd brew another batch starting now, and it'll be ready this time next year. Get this when you can!"
"From the EBF 2006. I'd been waiting a long time to try this one. Pours a very dark color with a brown head that falls fast and doesn't leave too much lacing on the glass. The aroma smacked me with bourbon and chocolate at first, then as it warmed, the bourbon aroma mellowed. Lots of maltiness and alcohol. The flavor was great. Lots of thick dark malts - chocolate with coffee up front then a bourbon character that sticks to the palate. The body is very thick and the drinkability is pretty good. Try this one if you have the chance."
"This is clearly the most amazing Stout I have ever had. Sampled at the January 2005 EBF, it remains in memory with clarity. Wow! The visual, smell and taste were of extraordinary synergy. A short tan head accented the rich, deep blackness. Superb coffee and chocolate malts warmed and woven with Burbon tempered by oak cask character. Smooth, thick, big, present. The texture, dimension were divine. The burbon drip was endless and with comfort as it warmed ceaslessly. It remains on my palate to this day!"
"Possibly one of the best stouts I have ever had. I first tried this beer at the Michigan Beer Festival in 2003. This is a strong stout aged in oak casks that were once used to age bourbon. The result is a unique, complex beer that is black as night with a slight tan head. It pours quite thick as you might imagine and in addition to the smoky, chocolate flavors of the malt, you get a hint of a vanilla-oak that comes from aging in the barrels. At around 10 percent ABV, you have to wonder if some bourbon is still remaining in the casks used since you can immediately taste and sense the alcohol. The bourbon flavor is quite evident. A great masterpiece in my opinion, though this is clearly a slow sipping beer not meant for mass consumption."
