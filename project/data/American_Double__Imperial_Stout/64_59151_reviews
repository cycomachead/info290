"O - This is a nice take on an Imperial Stout. The honey adds some nice depth to the flavor. Very enjoyable."
"Flat underwhelming taste. The taste of this beer doesn't live up to its dark taste at all. Very little up front taste - a little bit on the finish."
""
"This is a thick rich stout"
""
""
""
"P.S. After reading about gesho, I'm guessing that's the buttering agent here instead of hops. That must be the ""finishing punch"" I got."
""
""
"Very unique ""imperial"" stout. Has a nice mead like finish. Very dark pour and head... Very smooth and sweet , thin body for how black it is. I like this a lot. I wonder if they ever barrel aged this?"
""
"I'm not a fan of honey but I wanted to try this beer based off it's great reviews, but I was not able to really enjoy this beer.  I'm also not a fan of stouts, so that was probably why I did not enjoy this one."

"As Bitches Brew is perhaps my favorite album of all time, I had to really press to set aside any pretensions regarding this drink, but the complexity and balance simply can't be ignored. Just as big, wandering, and wild as the album for which it was brewed."

"Strong somewhat bitter coffee and cocoa nibs, and not much else. Ok, but nothing I would seek out again."
"Bottle.  I really liked this stout.  Poured dark brown and looked great.  Smelled subtly wonderful and inviting.  Packed lots of flavor; nice blend of coffee, chocolate and malts.  Started it a little cold which caused a slight bitter finish, but it warmed up nice and smooth.  I recommend this beer and look forward to another some day."

"Pours a dark brown with khaki colored head. Roasted malt and dark chocolate notes on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with sweetness. Not bad."
"Poured from a bomber into a snifter. Pours pitch black with a brown head. Smells of fruit, raisins, and coffee. Tastes of chocolate, coffee, and slight fruitiness. Beer is carbonated just perfectly with full body. Overall a very, very good beer."

"this is sensational and something totally different. i cannot believe some of the negative write ups of this beer on here, totally unwarranted in my opinion, which is only as good as the next guys, but i honestly think this is pretty special beer. a nice gift from my girlfriend, who no longer really buys me beer, so i was feeling special myself when she did that for me. this is so sexy in appearance. inky shiny dark brown, plenty of viscosity, and a pillow soft mocha head with nice lace and stickiness as it slowly fades. aromas of tobacco and licorice along with the dark roasted malt. not too sure about gesho root, i have zero experience at all with it, but the beer does appear hoppy on the nose, so it could be contributing the bitterness and slight vegetal aromatic. the flavor is all about that honey with the dark malt richness. notes of jet puff marshmallow, espresso, and chicory are all here, earthy but really sweet too, molasses or some other raw sugar. it doesnt really come across like other stouts to me, there is more going on here, wonderful depth and complexity and nuance. a mild spice in the finish, could be the gesho but i just dont know it well enough to venture there. slight apple wine and marker finish, booze shows through a touch, but the more i sip the more i love this. a unique and wintery glass of ale, made all the better by sharing it with someone who i deeply admire. also, props for the miles davis tribute, his contribution to culture in this country is second to none."
""
"Pours a pitch black with thin tan head a nice lacing. Smell is coffee and molasses. I get more honey in the taste. The mouth feel is medium bodied. Overall I'm getting a lot of sweet molasses in this one, and that's not my favorite flavor. This is a fine beer, just not what I am looking for. Don't think I will be seeking this one out again."
""
""
""
""
"Man did this look like the most amazing beer I've ever seen and tasted good up front but really died at the end and left a flat aftertaste."
""
""
""
"This beer is NOT worth the money in my opinion. There was absolutely nothing special about this beer, it drank more like a strong porter or a weak stout. Apart from a cool special edition label to add to your collection / graveyard, this brew is a total waste of money."
""
"O: Lighter body than expected for a dark ale. I was expecting a thick dark stout not a medium body fruity sour and I was pleasantly surprised.  A very tasty and extremely smooth sour ale that grows on you as it warms up. An amazing beer and its possible its not at its peak. I'll cellar the next one 5 years (unfortunately the only one I have left is a 2014 so I've a ways to wait)."
""
""
"An excellent imperial stout. Just different enough to stand out, but not so different to taste odd or bad. Not quite incredible, but quite good."
""
"O: Its good, but nothing special.  Didn’t really get any honey characters like I was hoping for.  Worth checking out, but not something I would seek out.  3.75"
""
""
""
""
""
"Much more bitter then a traditional stout.  Almost a vinegar like taste which wasn't desireable."
"Amazing beer. One of the best I've ever had. If you're a fan of stouts this one will for sure be on the top of your lists."

"There was an off flavor like burnt (not roasted) malt along with a strong vinegar flavor that threw me off a bit here, as well as a pretty watery mouthfeel that I was not expecting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good beer.  Deep, dark in color.  Very good mocha flavor.  Nice mouthfeel."

"Love it"

"O- Very bold and complex.  Maybe a touch too much roasted flavor, though it mellows with warmth.  Glad I tried it.  Worth the extra dough, but I probably won't seek it out."
""
""
"Good beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a little sweet for my taste, but the aroma and body are tremendous;"
""
"Dark, complex, and full of harmony. This dogfish head release is fantastic and a fitting tribute to the great musician it is named for. I was impressed with the grassy hoppy notes mixed into the darker coffee and chocolate tastes. Not an everyday beer but one to be celebrated without a doubt"

"Awesome beer! I got this on tap so I'm not sure how different the feel is compared to the bottle. But this is excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good beer. Will most definitely be picking up another bottle for aging!"
"O: just ok aged I think fresh this beer is a contender the geisha root and honey is very hidden aged "
""
""
""
"Dogfish says this can be aged with the best of 'em.. I'm going to acquire a few more bottles before they are gone for this year and see how they do over time."

"Wonderfully smooth and subtle.  Well-integrated, luxurious components.  A delicious, complex imperial stout without any burnt roast bitterness that's easy to savor and sip."
""
""
""
"O:  Just as good as I remember the first run being.  Great flavors, great complexity and just an all around fantastic beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark black pour with a very big head. Lots of carbonation. Sweet honey aroma. Light mouthfeel. Fairly light in flavor. Fairly bitter with a hint of molasses. Easy drinking."
""
""
"Overall - Not the quality of Palo, but another quality beer from Dogfish. The hops combined with the normal bitterness of this style might be a little too much, and there are some things about the flavor that I don't care for, but it is unique as usual."
""
""
"Thoroughly enjoyed this beer, but it was actually 4 years old, not sure if I'd like it as much fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Another strange beer from Dogfish. Not bad, but not something I would ever buy again. They are one of the most popular breweries in my area, but a time goes on I find myself liking their stuff less and less. I appreciate that they try to be innovators, but some of their ingredients and flavor combinations are downright weird."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A nice version of an imperial stout. To me, more of a drinkable stout with less intense flavors and body than others."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very nice beer.  This one has grown on me a bit.  It's not as bitter as I recall it being back when I was first exploring stouts.  Nice to grab one or two when it's available."

"O - Make no mistake, this is a big, strong, intense Imperial Stout.  But it does seem as though the lighter beer that's blended with it lightens the body and opens up the flavors a bit.  A very nice beer."

"Mouthfeel is ok, much lighter than anticipated.  Has a strong carbonation level without being over carbonated.  Levels of complexity come out in the mouthfeel.  It's light, smooth, and dry all at the same time.  Since there are so many sweet flavors it's nice then it balances out with some bitterness then ends with a very dry finish like a red wine would.  Very drinkable though, the 9% isn't overbearing, this could be consumed by a beer enthusiast over dinner if they wanted.  Overall a very good beer, not a very great beer, but very good.  I've had it a few times and am impressed with how well this beer (approximately 3-4 years aged) has held up.  Might be slightly past it's prime but still very good."

"Aged 2 years..  MUCH better than fresh! Not as much of a boozy burn and tastes sweeter with age."

"This beer was oil black in color. Very rich and flavorful. Too much so in my opinion. I enjoyed it, but could only drink a half pint before feeling full. I mean like I just ate a meal. Very bready, with a chew to it. Coffee, carmel, burnt toast, flavors. Good experience, just not an all the time choice for me."

"A simply amazing beer. Cracked after letting age for about six months. The appearance was a dark brown with a coffee colored head. The smell was chocolate and malt with hints of fruit sweetness. The taste was amazing with coffee and dark chocolate flavors starting and finishing with flavors of dates and banana in the middle to even out the heavy flavors. The mouthfeel was nice and thick without becoming syrupy. Overall one of my personal favorite beers."

"Pours pitch black with a caramel roasted head..minimal to no lacing. Aroma is deep and coffee like with a hint of sweetness..Flavor is deep dark cocoa..reminds me of chocolate so bitter it's sweet..honey tartness it up a bit towards the finish..mouthfeel not boozy but warm and refreshing. Overall an enjoyable experience."

"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled in 2012. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense dark brown head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the lacing cap. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light char, molasses, honey, herbal, light anise, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and moderate honey/herbal spice notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light char, molasses, light anise, honey, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light char, molasses, light anise, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of big roasted/bready malt and moderate honey/herbal spice flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy, smooth, and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome imperial stout. All around great complexity of robust roasted/bready malt and moderate honey/herbal spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"I think the year of age has helped this beer, in that I can really taste the honey and sweetness now.  The coarseness of the roast has mellowed and the beer is smooth and very enjoyable.  It looks great and smells fantastic.  Quick review I know, but hey, I got beer to drink."

"O - definitely different, which I always appreciate from DFH. This was a fun one to try; got to learn about Ethiopian beer and gesho while drinking it."

"Split a 25oz bottle with another dinner guest at a dinner party. Beef bourguignon was on the menu and of all of the beers served, bitches brew was the best pairing. It is truly a unique beer and a bit of a departure from other beers I've had from dogfish head. It has become a favorite, and I picked up another one to have at a later date."
""
"Miles Davis' Bitches Brew is an an interesting beer, and the gesho root and honey added some interesting elements. Overall, however, the roast and char presence was a bit much for my liking."

"O-Great for those who want a unique straightforward bold stout, with a touch of sweet. One of the best transformative beers I've had. Every 6-8 minutes or so the whole experience changes. The taste blossomed when warmed. More nuanced than a standard chocolate-coffee stout. I suggest drinking a whole bomber to yourself. Drink it like food. Make your senses the fork, knife and spoon to indulge in this treat."

"Poured at a good temp with a vast, frothy, textured, light brown, settles after a while, and a bit o lace. Color is an opaque brown black. Aroma is fresh and on the mild side & mellow- cocoa, roast malt, old leather. Flavor's like nose, understated, esp for an imp stout tang & very easy bitterness up front, fairly dry with sweet being residual. Body/carbonation are perfect, a tad chewy, a bit soft, yet not too. Finish is like flavor, longish, and super drinkable. Only the barest suggestion of alcohol. Solid beer"

"O - I would definitely recommend trying this beer. Taste is the most important aspect to me, and I just wish it was stronger. Overall though, I'd give it a shot, especially if you're interested in it after watching the episode of Brew Masters (as I was)."

"Overall, a decent sweet and roasty imperial stout. Almost tastes like a nitro. I don't really notice the honey other than a little residual sweetness."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours inky black with a thick, mocha head.  Aroma of chocolate and dark roast coffee. Lots of chocolate sweetness at the front of the tongue giving way to the dark roast coffee. Finishes dry. Full mouthfeel with little carbonation. Overall, this is a very well crafted ale. The honey ale component gives this thick as motor oil stout a nice dry mouthfeel preventing it from getting cloyingly sweet."

"very much a ""stout-like"" brew but with a funky after taste (and mid-taste!). not sure what to think of this... nice-looking lacing, nice chocolate flavor, not a genuine stout (in my opinion) and has a funky taste. but decent, and interesting. but definitely not a great brew, for what I think...."

"I think this is the first time I've given a perfect for appearance. Appearance is usually the least important factor for me, but this time it hit a home run for me! Absolutely pitch black like a stout should be, but what stood out was the head. it was not the usual khaki or off white; it was a dark, chocolaty brown... Gorgeous! For the smell: bakers chocolate, toffee and espresso, a bit more bitter than stouts usually smell. Taste is similar, not the most complex stout, but there are a lot of good flavors! Tons of dark chocolate, i don't know what ""gesho"" tastes like but there are some earthy notes that are uncommon. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, mild carbonation. Overall, solid beer, and I can't get over how great a pour it is!"

"O: Great, great Imperial Stout. Does not feel as strong as it actually is. Definitely complex while managing to be extremely drinkable and flavorful; also is elegantly smooth. Cheers to Miles Davis and Dogfish Head!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The alcohol is extremely well hidden in this beer - I would never have guessed that it was as strong as it is. Due to the richness of the flavors and the higher ABV, I think this one is an excellent beer to be slowly sipped and enjoyed."
""
""
""
"This is a great imperial stout! Rich, complex and boozy, but smooth and certainly ""drinkable"". Nicely balanced with a unique rooty character, this is a very enjoyable ""sipping"" brew!"
"The taste note is bittersweetroast cocoa and malts, and bitter medium coffee, with just a hint of the honey that seems to balance this one out. I can tell it's a sipper I appreciate. Doesn't feel as thick as I anticipated, although it does possess a nice slickness to complement the sharp aspects of the gesho root (a hop effect). For an unorthodox interpretation of a stout, quite well done by DFH, and as usual. An apt testament to the brewery and its founder, who apparently drafted the business plan while under the influence of the album for which this brew is named. That said, not for everyone (like that jazz), but worthy. Cellaring the remainder."

"Excellent beer for a cold winter evening. Due to the density of these types of stouts, I'm not sure if I would dive into an entire bomber+ of this anytime soon again, but that comes with the territory of a stout like this. A single glass would be a Perfect nightcap or after dinner drink. Definitely a beer meant to enjoy, savor, and sip. But for me, the 25 or so ounces was simply too much (too heavy), to still be ""enjoying"" towards the end. Again, thats not the beers fault. I just wish it were also served in single 12 or 16 oz bottles instead. Great beer."
""
""
"O- I'm really sure what to make of this beer. The drinkability is through the roof, but I'm not so sure it's an outstanding example of the style."
"O- A complex sipper."

"Overall-Outstanding. An Imperial Stout, with something more to offer with a cool jazz feel."
""

"Really happy I was able to try this. I'm not normally a DFH fan but this is a great concoction. The stout they brewed to blend with the honey liquor is very solid. Good depth of flavor and unique, incredibly well balanced."

"I loved this. The roasted flavors were simple and straightforward. In fact each characteristic seemed somewhat shy or timid on the nose until they came together in the drink for a fearless taste that's big and bold. Mouthfeel is creamy yet it has a bit of crispness because it isn't too sweet. Undaunted and delicious."
"overall: firkin liked it"

"This was definitely an interesting beer, and I've come to expect no less from Dogfish Head. Still, the flavour profile, while being interesting and unique, isn't one I would want to drink an entire pint of."

"Picked this up in a great trade with Mike! Pitch black pour with a nice two finger caramel-colored head with decent retention and minimal lacing. Very roasty, chocolaty nose with hints of licorice, coffee, molasses, subtle black cherry, and just a touch of honey, but probably only because I was searching for it. The taste is dominated by bitter dark chocolate, offset by a sweet root beer and honey combination that I really didn't care for. Hints of licorice, burnt coffee, vanilla, molasses, black cherries, and tobacco as well. The mouthfeel is moderately thick and slightly syrupy with medium carbonation and a bitter, slightly sour finish. Overall, this is yet another disappointing beer from the most overrated brewery in the world. I love when brewers go out on a limb and use unusual ingredients, but they never seem to work with Dogfish Head."

"Overall, not too bad. Would have liked to know what this was supposed to taste like, but at least it's a drinkable infection. Good thing DFH is coming back to WI so I can easily get this in the future."
"Excellent imperial stout, quite flavorful and not aggressive despite of its intensity given its finish lands smooth on the palate."

"O: This is a really nice, complex, imperial stout, I'm sure the more I drink it the more I'll find in both the aroma and flavor. This isn't the first bottle of Bitches Brew that I've had but it's the first I've sat down and dissected and I think I'm even more impressed with it's complexity. I'm glad Dogfish continues to brew this beer as it's worthy of a year round release. Bitches Brew is highly recommend, please find a bottle and give it a try, you won't be disappointed."

"O: A very nice concoction. I've always admired Dogfish Head's adventurousness and eclecticism, but I'm not always a fan of their special releases. This one, however, really hits the spot. The tej-like aromas and flavors are fairly subtle, but that doesn't bother me too much. This beer is advertised as an imperial stout and that's exactly what it is. Highly recommended."

"Poured a gorgeous deep black with a thin tan head. Looks quite nice. Scents of black coffee, roast malt and some alcohol. Standard for the style. Flavor begins with dark chocolate and black coffee, moving into those same flavors with a bit of added sweetness and ending with all those flavors plus roast malt and an aftertaste that combines roast malt and black coffee. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy bodied with decently high carbonation for the style. Also a sort of woody, drying quality, most likely due to the gesho root. It's a very good imperial stout, but it's not quite the odd take on the style I expected from Dogfish Head. Very good, but very normal, which doesn't mean it's bad. It's an experiment that worked, if it only did produce normal results. I'd have it again."

"O: excellent stout. i specifically like the depth of the chocolate flavor. i've had this many times, and plan to seek it out again. would recommend."

"O: It’s a really great beer; no doubt about it. Masterfully crafted. Definitely lives up to the hype. It’s tough to drink a lot of, though. Bitches Brew is an assault on the senses. But the warmer it gets, the more the honey comes through, both in flavor and mouthfeel. And I have to be honest, I’m not entirely sure what a gesho root is, or what, exactly, it adds to the beer. I’ll assume most of the earthiness and the hints of bitter are from the gesho. Whatever it’s from, it complements the honey nicely, and adds loads of depth to the imperial stout base."

"O- Very sweet, chocolate foward ImpStout, very enjoyable, lots of chocolate and lots of sweetness."
""

"Maybe this just isn't my style but that's a tough call considering of the half dozen or more Dogfish Head beers I've tried, I only like the 120."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was a winner. There was plenty of hype around this beer. For me, it really measured up. This one really hits the “wow” category. For fans of sweeter beers this one goes way beyond a “must try.” What really makes this beer different is how the gesho’s mild earthy and peat-like bitterness fit very well with the sweet malt and honey. The gesho does only enough to keep the sweetness from going over the top, but still allows all of the flavors come through bright and clear."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bitches Brew is midnight-black in color, with a thin tan ring topping it off. Some points are being deducted here, due to the size of the head and its minimal lacing on the glass. With the aroma, on one hand I am getting nice, roasted malts, and on the other, an intriguing presence similar to bittersweet apple cider. Very interesting... After one sip, the taste confirmed this, but the bitterness in that cider aspect was intensified compared to the aroma, and it was more like apple cider vinegar. Not at all unpleasant, though. Some vanilla bean and a very dark clover honey, or molasses flavors are in there as well. The mouth feel was very full, and the finish ended sweetly. A uniquely Dogfish Head style creation - definitely a 'must try' if you are a fan. Don't hesitate to order if you are a general stout fan either!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer, but in comparison to the other IS/RIS I have had of late, this was not a top tier performer. May pick up another and give it a year, but I don't; have high hopes for it. I know I must be wrong, since the rest of the BA and the Bros have it at 94/95."
""
""
""
"This is a nice stout for sure, and still holding strong after 2.5 years of aging."
""
""
"O-- I wish I would have gotten more of these 750s. It is one of the finest stouts (imperial or otherwise) I've ever had. My drinking buddy would agree with my assessment."

"A wonderful beer, limited in its release. Dark traits accompany this stout, but the flavors shine through remarkably. Roasted coffee beans, malt, toffee, and dark chocolate weigh heavily on the palate. Acidic, with a finish that lasts for 45+ seconds, the refreshing quality of this beer is one to long for. (2012 release)"

"overall a watered imperial stout, at least for my taste. nose, palate and body left me unimpressed, came with high expectations and they were definitely not met. its an OK brew, but nothing special. I still enjoyed sipping it though. way too overpriced in my region."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor is good for a stout, but not necessarily one in this price range. It kind of reminds me of Green Flash Double Stout (which is also good), only more spicy and porter-like. Is it over-priced? A bit, but I think the distinct flavor and the lovely art on the bottle is worth an extra smacker or two. I think it's a delicious beer that I wish was a little sweeter and a little creamier on the palate. Definitely suggested."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I almost forgot just how amazing this beer is. Dogfish may have their duds, but this certainly isn't one of them. Highly quaffable, and thus dangerous due to the high ABV like many of DFH's brews."
"O: One of the more complex and fun beers I've tried in a long time. Not sure I'd replace this with all imperial stouts but this beer will definitely liven up your palate and offer some tastes that are unique to the beer world."

"M: Mouth-coating but not sticky. It really allows you to get all the flavors in every sip, but not to linger overly long. Smooth and well moderate carbonation."
""
"It pours an opaque very dark brown with a root beer colored head. Coffee and very light anise; perhaps clove. The mouthfeel is somewhat thick immediately, like heavy cream, but thins out quickly and dries soon after. Very smooth with the blend of flavors. It effortlessly transitions from coffee to the mildest of clove. Very drinkable and quite good."
""
""
""
""
""

"O- A very good beer. Sweet with enough roasty bitterness to balance. Not as nuanced as some imperial stouts but a very unique and well made beer none the less."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: A well crafted, inspired, and very tasty offering from dogfish head. Not quite as complex as a Miles Davis record, but proves equally timeless with age. Smooth and boundary pushing, this vintage was all I've come to expect; quality."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very very solid offering from a brewery that sometimes (in my opinion) tries a little hard to be different for the sake of being different. When they go after a ""style"" they can really nail it."
"Overall - Definitely Dogfish's best beer. I don't get much from the adjuncts, unless the woody flavor is from the gesho root."

"O: Unique and fun, this is one of the cooler beers I've had, and bottle is a great keeper. I'm storing one for a year, so I'm excited to see how it matures."
"An awesome brew, I will definitely seek again... Highly recommended."
""
"O I really enjoyed this beer but expected a bit more complexity. I enjoyed how carbonated it was and the oak flavor was very nice"
"Verdict: A nice pleasant stout from DFH, ambitious with the root adjunct, but the honey works nicely. The beer has a lot going for it, one I'd definitely enjoy again."
""
""
""
"O - Definitely a sipper from DFH. The honey and sweetness really mix it up."
"Mostly dry on the palate with a fairly conventional flavor profile for an imperial stout. Dark chocolate, bitter espresso, and licorice all play a part in the flavor. Lots of roasty malt goodness here with alcohol making only a slight intrusion. This would be well on its way to being a solid imperial stout, but the mouthfeel is a let-down. The carbonation checks out way too early, and it's not rich and chewy enough for an imperial stout. DFH takes a fairly conventional course with Bitches Brew and almost hits the mark. With some improvements to the texture, this would be recommended."
""
"Pours a deep dark black color with no visible light and a one finger dark khaki colored head. The head gives way to edging with sticky strands of lace. The aroma is of expresso and dark chocolate, there is also a hint of honey. The taste follows suit, there is a coco flavor along with deep expresso. The middle has a sweet dark fruit and honey flavor before the expresso flavor comes back at the back end. The mouthfeel is velvety but not overly slick. It was a nice balance. Overall a very solid beer, the aroma is good and the flavor keeps you wanting more."
""
""
"I wasnt a fan of the mouthfeel. There was a little too much chalkiness and this one was a little dry and thin on the mouthfeel, but. Nothing was too obtrusive about the overall feel. A great beer, one that can be sipped or enjoyed at a more expeditious pace. Complex and tasty. One of the few DFH ""specialty"" beers I actually enjoyed."
""
""
""
"O: I really liked this offering from DFH. It's very complex, tasty, surprisingly easy to drink, and quite enjoyable. I'll gladly drink this anytime it's available."

"Had a glass at Good Beer in the East Village. No surprise, it poured pitch black with a light brown head. Overall, this was a smooth, tasty beer, but there were no stand-out notes. I wouldn't call it bland thought, there's a big mix of mocha and dark chocolate with a mild roasty edge. It made for a great sipping beer on a quiet Saturday evening. However, I'm not sure I'd recommend it with such a high price tag. I'd probably reach for an Old Rasputin first."
""
""
"Overall I like this. I'm glad I aged though it took a lot of will power to get to today. The honey and gesho took this stout down another road but the road is not bumpy. Sip this brew and contemplate all that it is. Sam did Miles proud."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""

"O- not too much to say. It's super boozy and tastes more of dark fruit then dark chocolate. I have sniffed and sipped over and over, from fridge to room temp, trying hard to find something good about this beer... Then poured it down the drain."
""
"Overall: This was an incredible stout. Everything about it was great, especially with how balanced it was."
""
""
""
"Poured into a snifter, this is thick and dark with about half an inch of head. The smell has a strong presence of dusty semi-sweet dark chocolate and spices. Taste is very sweet with lots of sugary chocolate and cream; it almost has a chocolate milkshake characteristic to it. Alcohol presence is very low. I'm surprised how smooth and tasty this one is. Very nice, and named after a great album."

"Batch 1 seemed to be a little more complex. This one comes across as raw and unfinished. Still a ton going on but it lacks the depth and never really melds. Weirdly sweet."
"Bitches Brew is not my favorite album by Miles Davis. So I suppose it would follow that Bitches Brew is not my favorite beer by Dogfish Head. It's a tasty imperial stout, but I'm not sure if I'm a fan of the honey sweetness or how this reminds me of Miracle Grow soil. Regardless, it's very interesting."

"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter, 2012 edition. This pours a pitch black thick liquid with a smaller short lived mocha head. The smells are of dark roasted malts, some dark chocolate, black coffee, a little sweetness. The feel is thick and creamy like expected. The taste is pretty good, dark roasted malts, some medium bitterness, a little sweetness. Its a pretty tasty stout but also a little safe."
""
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a small snifter. Tudor brown head, moderate retention on a black body.l Clear, oily lacing. Aroma includes coffee, toffee, chocolate, vanilla, roasted malt, and it appears to be a bunch of hops nestled beneath these bold flavors. There is also a hard to describe uniqueness to the smell that I can't describe that I have to assume is gesho root? Taste includes coffee, roasted malt, some hoppy spicing, slight alcohol, mild malt sweetness. Thick mouthfeel, tongue coating. Awesome."
""
""
""
"D - overall, this beer has nice complexity, but I was hoping for a little more pronounced flavors from the honey and gesho. But, like the album, you don't know what's around the next corner, and this beer kept me guessing at times. Cool concept and well executed. Recommended for the experience!"

"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a goblet.Pours thick and heavy with a creamy head with small bubbles that clings to the side. Very complex aroma, with licorice, allspice, espresso, chocolate notes, plus a liberal amount of roasted malt and hops filling out the back end. Wonderful sweet and malty flavors, with some bitterness coming out from the hops and the roasting of the barley. This is a robust beer, with moderate carbonation. Overall, what can I say? This is one of my all time favorite beers. It is loyal to the imperial stout style, yet takes a lot of chances, too."
"Incidentally, reviewing this while watching the Bitches Brew Beer Masters episode. Pitch black with a light tan froth. Not much lacing. Aromas are bitter chocolate and berry fruits. Taste is bitter. Old fruit and bitter chocolate. A bit of tartness at the end of each sip. Don't really pull out the sweetness but dry and bitter really dominate. Thinner body and good carbonation. The warmer it gets the more the alcohol pulls through."
"Aw, Damn,"
""
""
""

"O: Worth a shot, its decent but not worth the $13 price tag I paid. I tend to like thicker stouts, but solid in its own right."

"this beer pours black as DOT road tar. Even the foam is black, surprisingly it lingers for a little. The taste is is not at all what I expected. I was waiting to be knocked of my feet sort of a Laphroaig response the first time you have a wee dram but instead I found this brew to be very drinkable for a stout."

""
"I think Sam chose a good style to commemorate the infamous Miles Davis album. It is close to what I would have expected one of Miles' bitches to brew, were she to cook a beer."
""
""
""
""
"O/D-I honestly don't give a flying fuck about whether or not this beer can effectively equate to the music of Miles Davis. It's a good Stout that is probably a bit overpriced. The skeleton of the beer is strong and well-bult. One could argue that the addition of honey and um...gesho wasn't necessary. I finally tried it and about as good as advertised."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I did it. I drank it. I've been babying this beer since I got it. I didn't even put it in my cellar because I was scared it wouldn't age well. So, I kept in the refrigerator for nearly 2 years. Last night however, a good friend of mine looked me in the eye and announced that “it was time.” So we opened it. I'll be totally honest with you right now, I think I held on to the beer too long, even in the fridge. It was more bitter than I remember it being when it was fresh. I think the gesho root aged differently than I would expect hops to and it turned pretty bitter. The honey tones melted with and almost got lost in the oxidation process and yet it was still a winning beer in my book! The beer poured a big beautiful brown head and that wonderful aged red-fruit flavor you get from a well aged beer. If you have a 2011 release though, you might want to consider popping that baby open soon and shooting me a comment on how it tastes, I'd be very interested in hearing from anyone that has one."
"O: A really fine beer. The ""fusion"" element is not quite as bold as expected - it mostly tastes like an imperial stout, though the honey does soften the harshness and bitterness of those beers, giving it more of a smooth, mellow character. Very nice."
""
"O - Excellent beer. It's not quite like anything else out there on the market, and yet it's quite recognizable as what it is, a quality Imperial stout. It pushes the envelope of the style, but hits all of the hallmarks of the style. Truly an impressive accomplishment."
"Remember the girl with the pretty face, and the sweet perfume you fell for? Remember how she left you feeling empty inside? This is Bitches Brew. You fall for the beauty of the blend, but it leaves you wondering what the heck you're doing with your clothes on the floor an hour later. Snoop said it best."
""
""
""
""
"O: The aroma of this beer is really fascinating. The flavor: very strong. The burnt malt and coffee are very strong throughout this beer. At times, drinking this beer tastes like burnt crust. It is not sweet. Drinkers should be prepared for bitterness, alcohol, and burnt malt with a hint of honey."

"M + D: Nice, full body. Moderate carbonation cutting through the brew keeps it from being too thick on the palate. There's a little slickness that coats the throat on the way down, along with a pleasant warmth. This is a nice, solid stout... I'm very glad to see it back on the shelves."

"O – This is a tasty imperial stout. All the usual flavors of an imperial stout are here and are well-done, but it’s the stuff that’s added that makes this beer special. The honey really brings out the sweetness of the chocolate and dark fruits in particular and the gesho gives off a nice earthy, leathery aroma and taste (I’m guessing). I’m really impressed by this beer from Dogfish Head. More often than not, I’m underwhelmed by their beer, but not this time. It’s a good thing – any beer that’s named after such a stellar album better be great."
""
"O: I was super excited to see this at the local wine shop, as it's been a long time since I had it last. I think I remembered it being better, more honey-esque, less boozy, but past-looking shades are always rose-tinted I suppose. Still, very good."
"A great beer worth drinking."

"I think I had this for the first time in either '09 or '10. Sat on last year's bottle, but was quick to buy and open up this year's. I think I enjoy it more now than when I first had it. A very impressive Imperial Stout with exceeding quality over World Wide. More elegant, more smooth, and with less dark fruit and alcohol. Just unmistakable flavors of mocha, char, and dark honey. Love it."

"Poured into a Lost Abbey glass 2012. Pours a slick black, with a two inch sticky mocha head, that leaves behind plenty of lace. Smell is roasted coffee, dark chocolate, molasses, and vanilla. Taste is very roasty, with some hints of licorice and strong coffee and dark chocolate most dominant. Body is medium for the style, dry as you would expect, and easy drinking for its heft. I went to my favorite store in N.H Johnson's Market and discovered this today and I wasn't disappointed, a different and very nice imperial stout."

"Bitches Brew is simple, especially for DFH. It does one thing and one thing very well. This is a big roasty chocolatey stout that holds no bars. It's full-bodied, with a hefty dose of carbonation just to liven it up a bit. This is a great beer to share with friends or enjoy with desert."

"O: This beer really surprised me. I'm not a big DFH fan, but this beer is great. Not overly complex, but it has great flavors that work very well together. Well balanced and flavorful, this is the best DFH beer I've had by a long shot."
""
"The finish pulls up slightly sweet, again. This is a delicious brew, with a surprisingly sessionable character, despite the heavy alcohol presence. Nice!"
""
"O: I love this beer and it's probably just my amateur palate, but I feel like DFH's stouts (they don't call them all stouts but they drink like stouts--all their beers that are black on the pour) taste like a dark chocolate covered piece of dark fruit. They're VERY good, they just kind of taste the same."
""

"O - The addition of the earthy taste really makes this one complex and unique. The booze is there for a bit of warmth, yet never overshadows any of the primary ingredients. Really nice sweetness rarely found without being too intense. As is stand with the brewery superb balance leads this beer to victory lane. A winner for me."

"O: Unique stout for sure (I have never had anything like this before). Don't think I will be buying it again, but it was a great beer to try. For the amount of money I paid though, I was expecting something a bit bolder (and a bit more in-your-face)."
"Overall: Good beer for coffee drinkers and cocoa or chocolate lovers. Strong hints of dark chocolate that don't overpower the after-taste."

"Overall: This is a good one and worthy of a rating in the 90's. Don't know about the hype surrounding it, but I got it for a reasonable price at the local beer store so I'm not complaining. Pretty off-centered, but that's what to expect (and appreciate) from DFH. Would like to revisit again. Try it!"
""
"O - not worth the expense. There are better imperials out there that don't cost nearly as much."
"An imperial stout that almost lives up to the album for which it was named after. Bitches Brew is a very unique take on the imperial stout and a unique beer in general."
"O: Being a HUGE Miles Davis fan and growing up listening to Bitches Brew, I had to have this beer just for the bottle to go with my record. This beer is absolutely delicious and the hype doesnt fail to let me down."
"The beer pours a dark black with a berry red tint. This beer is a dark one for sure, with a dark toffee colored head of bubbles that dies down into a rim around the glass. Lacing is sticky and ring like with some sliding bits. The beer smells dankly sweet with an almost vanilla hint. The chocolate malt staleness is also very present and lovely with nice toffee hints. Light alcohol burns the back of the nose to let you know it’s there, but it is not overpowering. The beer tastes fantastically of chocolate malts with the light bitters of dark chocolate. The beer is roasty with an oh-so-slight smoke to it. In the middle of the taste there is a slight vegetal sweet flavor that is like vanilla but which must be the gesho root coming through, but the roasted malt work its way back to linger in the sides of the mouth. The honey is not really present in the taste, but more so in the mouthfeel as a slight suggestion. The more I taste it, the more of the beer’s sweet vegetal middle comes through as a little cloying. In the very back of the taste before it runs down the back of your throat there is a hint of fruity esters from the yeast suggesting pear or something similar. Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin but very velvety with only a hint of effervescence. The mouth is left dry with spittle clinging to the sides of the mouth and begging for more beer. Overall this beer is very intriguing and surprising for its style. The mouthfeel is a little weak, and the weird sweetness is a little cloying, especially as you get into this beer. The light mouthfeel also suggests this would be an excellent beer to eat food with. This is also a sipping beer as the alcohol got my cheeks nice and warm. This is another lovely off-centered ale from Dogfish Head and a lovely try for the craftbeer fans."
"I was excited about this one, but it seemed to be lacking something. Pours like any other imperial stout, dark black, but with a bit of a lighter colored head. There is some chocolate and honey in the aroma, which is a weird combination if you ask me. Flavor follows the aroma closely. Slight bittersweet chocolate up front, with some honey on the finish. As a whole, the roast and sweet don't meld together for some reason. I’m not sure I like these two flavors together, and it comes through as a pretty thin stout. I appreciate the uniqueness here, but don’t think I’ll come back again. Worth a try, but nothing to be excited about."
"Overall a very interesting beer with that unique bittering root. Aging is a must try with this to see how the gesho root and honey transform over time. Honey will get eaten up by the yeast and smooth this out even more."
""
"Poured from a bottle to a Guinness special edition pint glass. This beer poured with a nice dark 3 finger head, with smells of malt and smoke, as well as dark chocolate, and honey. This beer is phenomenal, the 9% abv is well hidden by the malty smell, dogfish head really hit a home run with this, one of the more distinguishing factors of this beer is the clean finish that leaves your mouth with very little flavor, unlike most Russian Stouts, the honey probably lends to that. Overall this is one of the best beers from Dogfish Head, and is one of the more unique beers on the market."
"O - I have been waiting for this beer to come around again for a while. I enjoyed the first batch a few years ago, before I really drank craft beer. This time around, I was very impressed again. This one has a roasty quality with a balancing honey sweetness and smooth vanilla finish. At $13.99/bomber, it's a bit pricey, but I recommend this beer, highly."
""
""
""
""
"O: great beer - has a lot going on, fusing RIS flavors with something a little more medicinal/herbal - I had an akevitt porter (from Haand Bryggeriet) once, and there was something about this beer that also reminded me of that; smooth, easy drinking beer; I've only seen Bitches Brew come around my area once, so I'd recommend picking it up if you see it."

"Single finger tan head on a jet black body with excellent lacing. Aromas of chocolate, honey, licorice, coffee, toffee and vanilla making this one very sweet smelling. Flavor is mostly roasted malts which are heavy with vanilla, dark fruit and honey notes and espresso in the finish. Thick body and moderate carbonation. Very flavorful but this one sits heavy in the stomach. Another nicely complex DFH brew."

"Review from 8/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours black with a thin dark brown head and light lacing. Malty stout aroma of dark and roasted malt. Moderate body with smoky malt and dark fruits, chocolate. Flavor somewhat subdued and finish is a bit abrupt and dry with a light hoppy finish. Kind of tame for Dogfish head. I'd classify this as closer to an English stout because of the finish. A nice stout, but not remarkable. I'll age a couple to see if it mellows."

"O: A good stout from DFH for a change! WWS isn't bad but it's a bit too extreme. Chicory stout is garbage. This one is in between and is a really nice and creamy IS. Could use a little more chocolate in my opinion, that would make it great. But it's still quite nice as-is. Honey is a nice touch that you don't commonly get in stouts."
"Overall: This reviewer had expected this to be the Holy Grail of stouts, and, while it is an excellent stout (perhaps the best that has passed these lips), but it was a bit underwhelming. Perhaps it had been built up too much and couldn’t stand up to the hype. Regardless, this is a must try for fans of stouts, or malty and delicious dark beers. As it is, the search for the perfect stout continues for this reviewer. 15.5/5"

The first sip is rich, dark chocolate, mild caramel and honey sweetness and bitter cocoa. Hops are surprisingly apparent. Mouthfeel is rich, thick and bubbly. Very nice on the palate. Overall a very interesting offereing from Dogfish Head. One of their better beers."

"This is an extremely smooth impy stout. It's consistent and smooth. Even though it doesn't really bring a ton of outlandish or notable character, it's still nice since it's so even and consistent. I don't really get any of the unusual or interesting ingredients added to this beer, but who knows, maybe they contributed just by being a part of the beer. Anyways. Good beer. Worth the purchase."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability – A good beer, but the slightly bitter aftertaste takes away from the overall drinability."
"Overall: I love this beer. It was awesome the first time I had it and I was very sad that it was only supposed to be a one off beer for the anniversary of the album. Needless to say, when it was re-brewed, I jumped at the opportunity to grab it. The one being reviewed here is not too old, but I have another aging and I can't wait to crack it open."
""
""

"Overall-very good stout. Not my favorite stout but very good nonetheless."
""
"The medium to full body does a great job of transporting and delivering the flavors while remaining smooth and playful. Even though it is rather sticky, it is not coating at all. The carbonation is barely noticeable but does create a nice, slightly foamy swallow."
""
""
"O: This is easily DFH's best stout to date. Yes, much better than WWS which is just overkill. Big and malty. Bitter mid-palate but finishes sweet. Loads of chocolate and coffee along with some dark fruit, honey and a light earthiness. A solid Imperial Stout."
"O: An amazing dark beer with a wonderfully complex flavor. Far more restrained and drinkable than a typical Imperial Stout. A worthwhile tribute to a great album."
"Overall: A gem in it's own right. This is not good beer at all it is GREAT! I haven't had this since the 2010 holiday season and I am gonna take my time finishing this bottle on hand. A lot of DFH beers are limited here in the Long Island area. Regardless you see it grab it, pour it in a glass ....Salud!"
"D - A very very nice American Double / Imperial Stout that does very well with a bit of cellaring / aging... Even though I'm not the biggest fan of the Bitches Brew album, any brew in honor of musically genius that was Miles Davis is all right by me..."

"Fairly good beer. There are a lot of good things going on here, but it's just a bit too sweet dinging the drinkability. The first few sips were delicious, but it got taxing to finish. I'd love to see how this one is with the honey dialed back a bit."
""
""
""
""
"I have searched for this beer for two years and finally had an excellent trade. I almost hated to open the bomber, afraid it might not live up to the hype. This beer poured a thick, burnt umber into a snifter and left a two inch chocolate milk colored head. Scent is of roasty malts and a subtle, berry. Tastes of dark roasted malts and bitter, dark chocolate with a hint of tartness. Has a creamy, soft mouthfeel with a soft effervescence. I am searching for the honey but it's not there in an ""in your face"" sweetness. Somewhere in there is a salty, soy sauce note and a whisper of smokiness. Maybe some chicory root and anise or licorice. As it warms, it grows more complicated and had a dark chocolate with raspberry tone and a splash of coffee. Nicely layered and balanced, this beer does not disappoint. I can see why it's so highly rated. I am going to be sad when I get to the bottom of the glass."
""
""
""
"Overall, a fantastic and unique stout from DFH, glad I have a couple more of these around. This is definitely one of the best all-around stouts I've had."
""
"Overall: one of the best imperial stouts I have had the pleasure of drinking, particularly because it has all the great qualities of a top-shelf imperial stout (I would put it in the same league with Old Rasputin, Stone Imperial Russian Stout, and Founders' Breakfast Stout), but with an added complexity from the T'Ej...definitely something I would be interested in trying to recreate in my own brewing"
""
""
"Overall, a really solid and well balanced stout. Incredibly easy to drink with nice clean flavors. This would is really good on its own, but putting this in barrels would be great. Hopefully, I will get to try this again."

"An excellent and slightly different stout. Will not hunt for it but would not pass up the chance to have it again."

"O - A decent stout, but honestly nothing to write home about."

""
""

"The mouthfeel is very disappointing to me. It's quite thin. Quite thin. I don't understand the reviews that talk about a full mouthfeel. What I drank was slick and slight. Overall, this is a solid imperial stout. I don't like the mouthfeel, but everything else is at least above-average. Perhaps not worth the price of admission, but a solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Fairly sweet and decently carbed, I couldn't really pick up on the special roots and such. A good beer but not exactly a 'knock you socks off' one especially given the $14 price tag."
""
"O: very nice dark roasted nature that is surprisingly easy to drink. Rich, roasty and robust. Solid, would hold my attention on multiple occasion. Feels about right @ 9.0%."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of dry coffee notes with dry black chocolate notes and some light vinous notes. Taste I also dominated by light dry coffee notes with some black chocolates notes. Light vinous notes are also discernable and some light hoppy notes can also be detected. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well brewed and enjoyable though lacking a little something. Definitely not the best stout form this brewer."

"Overall – Dry and bitter cocoa describe it the best. It was a nice brew to sit and sip and one that would go ideally with a light-sweeter meal ; providing a nice contrast."
""
"Out of over 3,000 plus beers this is in my top 10. Have had it dozens of times and both batches. Great robust not too chocolatly front, with a sweet malt N honey mid, and a perfect roast creamy finish. For a beer that has so much going on in variety of malts, hops, and honey, you think it you would over powering or off center....but its smooth and perfect(meaning I would change a thing)."

I would of loved to try this fresh and seen the honey really a main part of the beer."
""

"O-a good Imperial stout but not in a class with the best"
"Damn, I just swallowed the last drops. I wish there were more! While there were moments when I wished it were just a little bit sweeter/richer/maltier, this is a pretty amazing beer. If I could obtain more and get it home I’d love to see how it cellars. But I’m grateful to have tried it. The smoothness, balance, complexity and the synergy of those elements (with many other contributing factors tucked inside them) is pretty impressive. And delicious. Thank you to Sam and his crew at DFH! Seems to me like a lot of folks do way too much “hating” on DFH, but I really appreciate their expertise and experimentation (even if some of those experiments fail to hit the mark)."

"O: Very unique beer. Enjoyed drinking it and would take another swing at it given the chance. The sweetness really dominated but not in a typical chocolate or fruity way. Wanted just a bit more roasted grain and malt."

I'm noticing some cocoa aromas and in some weird way potpourri...which my friend denies. Bittersweetnessif left on the palate.

"Overall: This beer not only packs a punch, but is complex and delicate enough to seduce you into drinking more and more. As soon as you pour it you can tell this beer will be a rough Imperial Stout. That is exactly what comes through on both the nose and mouth, but what follows is the complex flavors from the honey and gesho root. The two sides of this beer combine to play beautiful music on your tongue. A true embodiment of the fusion between rock, funk, and jazz that we now know as Miles Davis’ Bitches Brew."

"O: a very interesting beer. Very thick and syrupy, one to share for sure, I think it would be difficult to finish a bottle without help. It does pair extremely well with good chocolate--we were eating Lindt Chocolate."
"Overall:	I liked it and I’ll be honest I was expecting something a little stranger after seeing the show about this beer. It was a good variant of a Russian Imperial Stout."
""

""

"O: im impressed glad they rebrewed this, never got any of the first batch."

"Medium bodied with a prominent dry, roasted malt character that is countered by sweetness from the dark fruit. The honey adds a hint of molasses and thickens up the body a bit. Slightly burnt/acrid but not too harsh with hints of burnt toast, deeply roasted coffee bean, bitter dark chocolate and oatmeal. As the palate adjusts, the sweetness becomes more evident with more honey/molasses and vinous dark fruit. Hints of grape, raisin, currant and dark cherry counter the dry, roasted flavor. Faint alcohol presence in the finish but the ABV is nicely masked with very little heat. This beer definitely improves as it warms so I would suggest sharing it with one or two people rather than opening it at a larger tasting."

"O: Really digging this beer. It is a great take on the RIS style with that usual DFH twist. Almost too easy to drink. Great job by Sam and the DFH crew!"
"O - very good beer, probably my favorite dfh special beer"

"Poured on tap and served in a snifter, the beer is jet black and viscous in appearance, with a thick, dense, milkshake consisency head that sits about a half inch and is a chocolate milk coloring. Aromas are strong coffee, both dark and roasted, with some cocoa nib hints, as well. Good effervescence to the aroma, despite the beer's robustness. Flavors are rich, and ride a creamy, smooth body. Good palate of dark roasted coffee, with a hint of dark chocolate and a good overtone of booze. Subtle sweetness lacing throughout the brew helps to lighten the flavors. The aftertaste is surprisingly light, with a creamy chocolate and honey flavor, and only a highlight of the bitter coffee. Crisp finish cleans up the smooth body and bold flavors nicely, and this is an amazingly tasty brew. Dangerously easy to drink at the ABV...could be trouble. MD would be proud."

"I'm glad I finally got my hands on this. I've been wanting to try this one for a while and it didn't disappoint. I'll definitely seek this out every time it comes around."

"O- great example of an RIS, heavy in the dark cocoa/coffee department, much more so than i remembered from last years. not overly sweet and at $10 a bottle, very hard to resist"
""
""
""
""
"O - This has good drinkability. It is a little bit of a sipper, but it tastes really nice. Overall, I think this is a really nice beer. It is really interesting and unique. This beer just really worked for me, and i enjoyed it a lot. I recommend trying this one out."

"Sidenote: I've recently had a subsequent batch at the brewpub and, yikes, what the hell happened?!?!? I was not impressed at all. The taste was much more mushroomy and earthy. Such a complete cluster of flavors, I couldn't even choke down the small pour."
"Overall this is a unique take on the RIS that works out pretty well. Its a bit sweet which I'm sure will make this bottle a pain to finish but so far its an odd beer which I feel is an appropriate tribute for an odd yet brilliant album."
""
"Pours black with a chocolate colored head, no lacing to be seen. The smell is simple and straight-forward, roasted malts and a strong dryness from the gesho root, which not unlike root beer. Gesho lends its character to the flavor as well. The body is a little light, but it's an enjoyable beer. Very off-beat, off-centered."
"Overall: In the end, this is a very interesting brew, Sam has done some amazing things with beers, but this one was too much for me. I don't like this spin on one of my favorite styles; while it's unique, the gesha root is a bit too present and I mistook its' bitterness for a metallic taste (more than once). This was a cellared bottle so I am wondering what it would have been like fresh."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good offering that is worth seeking out. It is certainly unique, as the 1/4 honey ale in it brings in a whole new dimension of flavor/characteristics, but it complements the 3/4 RIS very well."
""
""
""
"O: Overall a great beer that I recommend."
""
""
"O-this beer lives up to the hype that the show built last year. Is nothing at all what I expected but is as good and better than I thought it would be. So so so glad I got another bottle ."
""
""
"D: Amazing. Coffee and honey doesn't usually go well together; Dogfish Head makes it work."
""
""
"This one pours a nice black color with a finger's worth of mocha head that sticks around the edges. A surprisingly high amount of carbonation going on here. The taste is fairly strong on the dark fruits, with some honey sweetness and just a touch of roastiness on the finish. The mouthfeel is very carbonated for an imperial stout, with a dry finish. The drinkability is good, the bottle went down in an hour. Overall, a solid imperial stout, but not really worth the hype. I wouldn't pass it up though."

"A very good RIS, but I think there's a bit too much sweetness to truly be great."
"Besides the unfamiliar stankiness, there's just a ton of everything that is burnt, bitter, and detestable in every lovely way. Really, I can't believe I am saying that it tastes very well balanced and is great to savor. Booze is pretty noticeable at first."
""
""
"Pours a almost oil like black with an ever present one finger tan head on top of a strong, sturdy roasted malt aroma as well as some coffee and chocolate and a thick breadiness to it as well. On first sip I get a smooth, creamy yet thick dry coating over my tongue. The roasted/coffee malts are dominant at first but are mild and then balance w/ some chocolate and sweet malts (guess that's the honey) and there's a touch of ""woodiness"" in the beer that always it to remain smooth and not dry out my tastebuds/throat. Has this somewhat prickly, spicy and crisp finish that is decent and I swear I get a hint of vanilla and/or black cherry. A quality stout that I enjoyed sipping on."
""
"O:Just dark ale goodness."
""

"750ml bomber: This one pours an inky, opaque dark brown color. There was a finger of light brown head on it. Fairly rich aroma to it. Coffee, chocolate, some smokiness, Some kind of hers, and definitely some other stuff: a complex aroma. This has a very complex taste. Some coffee, roast and bittersweet chocolate up front, then a ton of other flavors. A touch of sweetness and then a touch of bitterness in the finish. Somewhere between medium and full bodied. Very nice!"
""
""
"O - I drank a fresh bottle of this last December and I loved the sweetness of it and I thought it was a fantastic RIS. I don't think this has aged too gracefully. Its starting to take on some more savory flavors and the sweetness is falling out. Still solid at this age, but I will be drinking my batch 3 relatively soon."
""

""
""
"O= Sam, make more of this stuff! I'm putting a keg on back-order!"
"Overall I am happy with this beer. The only thing that disappoints is the lack of body. But other than that it is a very drinkable imperial stout."

"Mouthfeel is pleasantly sweet. Not at all too much so. Just a great experience."
"O - Overall this is a tasty beer by DFH, much better than the Pearl Jam one they did. Glad I have another bottle of batch 1 of this."
"For me this is the second time I've had this and still the same results. A bit too sweet for my liking."
""
"O - Mixing brew and music just makes sense. Bold move by Dogfish to try to blend the two together (and getting the rights to do it), and I think they were successful. The music and the beer both are an interesting mix, heavy but loose, dark and sticky, with something always lurking and bubbling below the surface."

"3.5 D: Respectable, but as far as DFH stouts go, I'd much rather spend my money on WWS and forget about it for several years."
"O: I have been wanting to try this since I saw it on the first episode of Brewmasters. Overall I thought it was good and I’ll refill my glass again, but I don’t know if I’ll seek more of these bottles out. Maybe it's more enjoyable paired with the right food."

""
"O - Very bold and robust. Love the strong coffee flavors. The oily herbal bitterness throws me off a little, but it is new and interesting. Definitely goes well with the avant-garde sounds of Miles Davis' Bitches Brew. Would probably drink again."
""
""
"O: A very complex beer, like the Miles Davis album. However, much like the music, I'm not sure I 'get' the beer. Oh, there's no denying it's good -- the horns alone assure that -- but at times it seems, chaotic, noisy, and confused...Wait, was I reviewing beer? Right. Well, despite the admirable balance, perhaps Bitches Brew lacks focus or commitment? Then again, it's growing on me, much like jazz. I'm stretching a little bit, but not too much. It helps that I have the album on in the background as I write. I will conclude that this is a beer that merits reconsideration and will likely change with age."
""

""
"O: I'll admit that this isn't my favorite style, but I appreciate these beers. Comparing this with some others, Ol Rasputin and Ten Fidy, I'd have to say its a little behind Ten Fidy, but not far at all. Perhaps if it aged a little bit more some of the other flavors would come out. I wouldn't stay away from it as its good, but I think there are better things out there."
""

"This is just a really good beer, forget the TV show hype and the collaboration with Sony. This beer would stand up on its own as a great RIS and is definitely worth trying. I'm glad they brewed it again as I probably wouldn't have gotten a chance to try it otherwise. This would make a welcome addition to the DFH line if they decided to do this yearly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer poured almost pitch black and formed a medium tan foamy head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, hops, chocolate, coffee and molasses. The flavor is of malt, molasses, coffee and hint of chocolate and anise. The body is medium light and the finish bittersweet. A little light for and imperial style but a good one nonetheless."
""
""
""
""

"Quoted by cohort - Tribute - There's definitely a lot of complexity that would relate to his musical talent, the man can not be copied. The funk would be the aroma that just stands out from the character in the most sly way. And the transitions, as fluid as the flavor changes were, so was his compositions."
""
"O - pretty damn good RIS. hard pressed to drink a whole bottle of this though."

"Black with a small head that drops to a thin covering. Webby lace. French roast coffee, dark chocolate, caramel, and nuts in the nose. Dark, bitter chocolate, some earthiness, berries, and charred wood. Faint licorice. Not as sweet as expected. Medium-plus body, drying, and a bit tart. Pretty good overall."
"O: This was an okay beer, but it could never live up to the hype. I would buy it again, but only to age and see what happened."
"O: My reaction to DFH beers is that they are either a complete home-run, or they miss by a mile (120 Minute, I'm looking at you). Fortunately for me, this one was a base-clearing home run. I would love to have been able to try this side-by-side with Brooklyn Chocolate Stout, because I do find similarities. Well done Sam!"
"I've had the first installment of Bitches Brew, though I can't recall specifics. In fact, I still have a bottle from then and will compare that soon to a fresh one. Overall, this is a really nice beer but to add that additional layer of dimension and complexity; I wish the gesho root and honey would come out a lot more in the aroma and flavor."
"Overall, a solid beer. Interesting take on a RIS. I'd like to try this after it's aged for a while to see how the flavors blend and mellow."
"Great RIS. Very drinkable. Glad they did another incarnation of this. A very clean, well balanced version of the style."
"more notes for me: the rates system is well too far apart, I wanted to rate taste near a 4, but to round up would leave me to think it was better than it was. While I did not rate it to RIS style one cannot help but think it fell short of the RIS mark."
"O - a little too sweet for my taste, but a nice beer, more of an after dinner beer."
"Overall, I'm really digging Bitches Brew. It's a tasty RIS, for certain. The honey beer side of the equation could perhaps be a little more pronounced, but I can't really complain. A tasty sipper. I should have picked up more bottles."
"Beer poured from the bottle a dark brownish black with a slight reddish hue, very soft dark brown/tan head lingered for just a bit before receding into tan lacing. Smell was hard to pin down, roast and coffee with an odd spiciness and sweetness. Taste was similar to the nose, roast and chocolate up front with an odd spicy smooth finish atypical of stouts ESP ris. Mouthfeel was smooth and silky with just the right carbonation. Overall a very solid beer one I look forward to again!"
"Poured into a stem glass, jet black with an amazing, rocky, mocha-brown head. Aroma of dark roasted malts, cocoa, dark sugar. Rich, full taste, chocolate and dark malts, licorice, honey and molasses in the background, and a subtle fruitiness even further behind that. Nothing out of the ordinary or extreme as far as taste goes, just a satisfying and finely crafted beer. Full body, smooth, and easily drinkable."
"O: Definitely a solid, solid RIS...good balance as is, but would be interested to see if some of the bitterness fades and rounds out those chocolate and roasted notes some more."
"Pours black, with decent head, that hardly holds. less carbonated than normal. smell is potently chocolate and dark malt. taste is very similar, definitely on the sweet side with chocolate that has no bitterness. Very mellow flavor. Still has some of that metallic flavor it originally had. I cannot quite put my finger on it. thick mouthfeel with great drinkability."
"O. I never got a bottle of this, not even sure if we got them in Texas, but I'm very glad to have been able to taste it twice, a year apart. Without a doubt one of the best stouts I've tasted."
"O - Great beer from Dogfish, definitely buying another if it is rereleased, Nice perfect stout, with its own uniqueness."
"A rich RIS on the sweet side. Pours a deep brown body that looks very thick. It is a thick chocolate malted milk consistency, with a retained bubbly head. Milky roasted aroma. Very drinkable and chocolately, with some wierd tastes in addition to the anise.Aged more than a year."
"Great beer. I highly recommend it. A great Russian Imperial Stout."
"Overall, nice beer, but I wish I would have shared this 750 with someone. One glass in a sitting was enough, the peppermint flavors begin to get old."
"O: This was my 2nd of 3 bottles. Drank the first in Oct. of 2010. I remember drinking the first and had notes to compare this bottle to... but there wasn't much change after a year of aging, IMO. Overall it's an enjoyable beer. I'd buy it again if they re-released it, but wouldn't pay ebay prices for another bottle."
"D - If what bitters is the root, it was interesting. No honey taste. Seems to me honey ferments and leaves not much taste. Better to use Honey malt. Good beer."
"Overall: Good beer. I wish I had another bottle to age longer."
"Pours a black color. 1/3 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of dark citrus, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, slight alcohol, slight liquor, hint of yeast, mustiness, and a hint of hops. Fits the style of a Russian Imperial Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, dark citrus, slight hops, hint of chocolate, and a hint of alcohol. Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, feel, blend, and complexity."
"Poured heavy and thick with a lovely light brown head. The malts come through in good viciousness but the taste is overpowered by the sweet honey which is cloying at the least. Hops are unmemorable and mild - another kitschy and high abv product from dogfish."
"Overall: Really enjoyed this beer from DFH. Almost borders a session stout vs. an imperial stout, but it still has some solid flavors going on."
"Overall this is an excellent stout. Very drinkable and there is no hint of the 9% alcohol in this beer. Would highly recommend."
"O - Outstanding. I love this brew. I wish that DFH would celebrate Miles' birthday, or the re-release of his albums, or something, with a re-release of this recipe...at LEAST once a year. One of my fave RIS. Celebrate the ""Birth Of Cool"" ... celebrate the ""Birth Of The Blues"" ... celebrate the ""Birth Of This Brew!"""
"O: Wow, this is really 9% abv, does not taste like it at all. Very good drinkability. Very well done, glad I still have another one in the cellar. This was definitely a rare treat."
"O - Was happy my comrade in hops CTSparky was willing to crack this open. Another very unique beer from DFH and one that took its theme seriosuly. If this was made again I'd grab a bottle."
"The Bitches Brew poured out as a dark black color with a foamy brown head on top. The lacing was decent on this beer. The smell was heavily roasted and had a sweetness on the nose as well. The taste is rich and complex, well worth the time sipping it down. The flavors of coffee and some bitter chocolate come through and leave ya with a dry roasted molasses aftertaste. The mouthfeel is heavy and has a decent amount of carbonation. Overall this beer was quite nice, I am glad that I got to try a bottle before it was gone for good."
"Overall, a decently drinkable mutant monster of a DFH beer (aren't they all...). One minute I'm saying ""it's a stout!"" Next minute ""it's a honey/gesho beer!"" One serving, maybe two, per sitting, is fine for me."
"There is a lot going on in this beer, but I enjoyed every minute of it!"
"Powdered cocoa galore, with equal parts dark fruit and bitter hops. Roast imparts some classic stout flavors, but this one is pretty different overall. Interesting yeast and sweet-ish character. Nice dichotomy of smooth/biting interplay as well as a cool balance of dark flavors - hard to describe...I am struggling here. I guess I'll just go with great concept, great execution and a really good beer. Well done Dogfish."
"A well balanced beer I think. For an imperial, it sure is drinkable. I'm not sure what the honey and gesho do for this beer. But I guess a more sophisticated pallet could detect those subtle flavors."
"Pours a pitch black with a huge 3 inch dark khaki head that settles to a nice 1 inch cap. Thick foamy rings of lace form on the glass like a ladder on the drink down. Smell is of dark fruits, dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and cocoa powder. I don’t get any honey smells off this one, but there is an alcohol aroma. Taste is of dark roasted malt, roasted coffee beans, and bittersweet dark chocolate. Again, no honey flavors detected whatsoever. Mild roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. A good level of carbonation makes for a crisp and creamy mouthfeel, Overall, this is a very good stout from DFH but the honey beer part of this blend has all but faded. I should have bought another one of these when I had the chance to see how it tastes fresh."
"Overall not too impressed. I'm wondering if there's an effervescence issue with the beer I was served."
"Edit: After researching what Gesho is I am very intrigued, I think that there is most certainly a ""root"" plant like theme to this beer that was lost on me since I didn't know what Gesho was. This is really a very interesting offering, and a unique member of the RIS family. Get a couple bottles and age this for sure, the plant and honey combination will certainly gain complexity in time."
"O: This is easily the most sessionable RIS I've ever encountered. The lighter body and tone down of some of the classic flavors allows you to go through this at an unusual and very tasty rate. I liked this beer quite a bit, but in terms of sheer RIS flavor your bolder, creamier stouts probably have more to offer. Big props to DFH for this one."
"I was expecting to be blown away by some DFH craziness, but instead I was knocked out by just how good it is. Really well balanced and polished. Nicely Done!"
"O: Another fine brew from DFH. This tastes quite typical of a Russian Imperial Stout, however I don't get the honey taste, and I don't even know what gesho is."
"overall its a soothing stout. i enjoyed sharing it with a couple friends."
"A greatly crafted beer, one of my new favorites!"
"spipper for sure but very drinkable overall great beer"
"overall a good beer, glad I could try it."
"An inch of creamy brown head on top of a black body. The nose is a large amount of roasted malts and dark chocolate. A spicy sweetness blends in as well. Large amount of flavor. Bitter dark chocolate with some toasty malts. Some fruity/tangy sweetness raisins and honey. It finishes with a coffee bitterness and a spice I don't recognize, but like. Lighter than expected body but smooth and a balanced bitter end."
"o: In the end I think it's a bit too sweet. Seemed to take a turn for the worse as it warmed too. Glad I tried it but not something I would seek again. Other RISs I'd much rather have."
"This is pretty solid. I can drink it during the summer without feeling weird, which is a huge plus for me. I kind of wish it was going to be available more often."
"Pours a rich dark brown with cap of dense khaki head, almost looking like a nitro pour. Scent is earthy, milk chocolate, charred and smoked grain, leather, damp mud, light touches of a powerful spice. Taste brings smooth cocoa before it dives into dark roasted coffee beans, char and smoke, warms to a very earthy and muddy brew. Strong amounts of spice stick out and lingering sweetness sticks to the palate. Full bodied, creamy and smooth with a faint touch of grainyness, no lingering notes on the palate, stradles the line between dry and sweet perfectly. To be honest, i was affraid this beer would be more hype then substance, but to my suprise, it was a great beer. Very earthy, very smooth."
"O: well the aroma is awesome, the taste doesn't deliver how I had hoped for"
"Medium to light feel on this one, decent carbonation. Overall, with everything Dogfish Head put into this beer I'd love to see a little more complexity."
"I'm not keen on this considering the myriad other options out there."
"Overall, this just do it for me. Thankful I split this bottle."
" Definitely get the coffee and chocolate notes in the taste. A little bit of sweetness from the honey. Not your typical imperial stout, but still very enjoyable. Overall a great beer."
"I drank this upon its release at Venti's, on tap, while the bartenders played Bitches Brew all night. That's the ideal way to drink this beer, but, atmosphere aside, a little age has improved the actual flavor immensely. It's not as thick or as powerful as I've come to expect from the alleged style (I say ""alleged"" because its similarities to a milk stout are still prominent), but, while initially sweet, it's still nuanced, well-balanced, and a novel hybrid of cross-cultural styles. Very drinkable -- the alcohol's not very apparent at all. My only qualm is that the beer became noticeably more tart as it warmed. Nevertheless, its one of my favorite stouts."
"Bitches Brew is one bitchin' brew - that may sound like something a jive turkey would say, but it's true. (I couldn't resist one more!) I'm now drinking it at room temperature and that doesn't affect things one bit. This is exactly the kind of sensual, gratifying, pacifying beer I could put my feet up, put some jazz on and relax alongside all evening."
"Full rich body and dense in the mouth, this is substantial stuff. My only disappointment is that I didn't get a glimpse of honey anywhere down the line. Overall, I think Myles would approve. and I will make it a point of playing Kind of Blue next time I'm lucky enough to have a bottle of this stuff."
"O (D) - Yeah, this is a good beer. Tastes good and interesting, nothing crazy, Just fine."
"O – Very strong RIS. It’s not the best but it is way up there on the list. Drink and be merry."
"The beer pours a dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma is very heavy on the chocolate and roasted malt. The flavor is more of the same. I get a lot of chocolate and roasted malt with some light bitterness. Thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not as complex as I would have liked it to be, but still a very nice strong stout."
"The flavors here are just great, it almost drinks itself. This is just a well made RIS, and I'm definitely aging my other bottle."
"Overall I was so happy to get a chance to try this. I like the way Dogfish Head does crazy blends like this one. Definitely a one of a kind."
"Don't make the mistake like I did and start to drink this beer anywhere close to chilled. I would recommend 55 degrees or warmer. Chilled this beer really taste like any other cold stout or plain guiness for that matter. As it warms, you can start to taste the complexity in flavor of the root and honey that is in this beer. Not my favorite Imperial Stout, but is very unique and definitely a must try."
"O: The dryness is a little much for me by itself, but it pairs fantastic with a sweet chocolate desert. We had it with a chocolate moose cake and fresh raspberries, and it absolutely transformed both the beer and the dessert."
"O- this is different. Not necessarily bad, but different. I've had much better RISes before, and didn't think this one really lived up to the hype"
"Drinkability is high. Tasty, smooth, and the ABV is not the outward bound."
"Drinkability: Well balanced, not overly sweet, and the relatively lighter body further increases the ease of sipping, however at the expense of the length of the aftertaste."
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer. One I really liked. Don't think I could ever drink a whole bottle at one sitting. But, it was great as a sampler."
"O - While thick in feel and rich in flavor, this drinks very well for a big, higher ABV stout. The album playing in the background made it even better!"
"Bonus points for a terrific label."
"D: I truly enjoy this one, but the high ABV makes this a one time beer."
"This is a solid Imp Stout, not necessarily the best our most outstanding but certainly worth a sampling. I didnt know it was some sort of rarity but Im glad I drank it now with good beer folks at a great event!"
"Okay, so it's nothing like hot cocoa. Move along. Nothing to see here."
"Finally got to sample this at the H.M.O.G. at the Brick Store Pub in Decatur. It comes out of the bottle a deep sable with a buttery tan head. Aroma has tones of roast coffee and semi-sweet chocolate. Rich flavor has firm coffee and chocolate tones as well as a hint of fruit, either apple or pear. Texture is smooth and a little tingly."
"There isn't anything that jumps out rudely other than it's black power. As a jazz fan (and Dogfish Head fan) I would buy it again just for the name (if they ever make it again). Cool!"
"I enjoyed this interesting brew, glad I bought a few bottles for the cellar as I want to see how it ages."
"Very interesting aroma. There's a great balance among flavors, nothing is overpowering. Alcohol is well blended. It's certainly more about what it's not. It's not your average imperial stout flavor and feel but it's there. It did become slightly acidic and was not the easiest drinking but it was a pleasure to selfishly finish. I usually view DFH head beer as good, curious tasting beers but this one is outstanding all the way around. Woven in with listening to ""Bitches Brew"" makes for a wonderful experience."
"Pours an ink black, I can tell its thick. Very dark brown head, dissipates quickly. Smell is not too strong, roasted malts and some coffee, there is something else there as well, the honey? Taste has two levels, coffee and bitter chocolate on the front and a heady sweetness of something very earthy at the end. But this is not a sweet stout, its almost savory. As a fan of DFH I so wanted to like this beer, its just not doing it for me. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good only for fans."
"drinkability: somewhat woth the hype. But this beer is for RIS fans, not Miles Davis fans. Think that's where they hype is."
"Incredibly tasty and smooth, but with such strong flavors and a higher alcohol content, one or two is enough."
"Poured a black color into a shot glass. Smell of roasted hops. Taste of a good stout. Not too harsh. Good mouthfeel,not overwhelming. Good drinkability with an interesting backend. Overall, a good stout to try."
"Pours a really dark midnight black with a big, fluffy light brown head. Really good lacing and retention. Aroma a little lacking. Some dark chocolate and coffee notes. Flavor follows. A little bittering, roasted coffee and unsweetened chocolate notes. A little bit of hops. Finish is sweeter with the honey coming through as well as some sweeter malts. Nice blend, but noting spectacular."
"O - It's hard to rate this one: DFH have definitely achieved another interesting, well crafted, and undeniably off-centered brew; yet as much as I respect it, I can't help but suspect that Bitches Brew was driven into existence through a need to be different for the sake of being different, and not because it was the right thing to do. All I can say for sure is this: 'A' for effort."
"d - Overall this is a really nice RIS. Lots of coffee in the smell and bitter chocolate/roasted malts in the taste. Has a nice thick body and is a sipper for sure. Glad I have another bottle of this one."
"A deep dark black brown color with a solid light brown head and great lacing. The aroma is an alluring chocolate licorice and maybe a touch of juniper. Subtle but nice. The flavor is a super smooth coffee and juniper licorice. The chocolate comes out a bit like a mocha smoke in the back of the palate. This is a medium-full bodied brew with a silky feel and very, very fine carboanation. I find this pretty darn drinkable even though I expect it would catch up with you pretty quick. It's a beautiful brew, an easy ""A"!"
"D: Very drinkable but I wouldn't pay another $20 for a bottle. If you can find one it would make a great gift for someone who enjoys stouts or is a Miles Davis fan. Worth trying but split the cost with a friend & sample together."
"D: One of the better non-barrel aged stouts I've had. I'm a fan of sweeter stouts so this one hit me just right."
"Really solid one here for the fish!"
"this beer is deserving of mint chocolate."
"This was a good RIS, lots of balanced flavor, thick and filling so its tough to finish a whole bottle."
"After having a sample on tap a few months ago, I was skeptical going into this (I found it thin & too herbal). I've really enjoyed my half of the bottle; even more so as it warms up. Good stuff."
"D: This is easily one of the most unique brews I have ever tasted. Not only is it impressive in its originality, but it is delicious through-and-through. I am happy that I was lucky enough to find a bottle of this before it faded out. I am a gigantic fan of Miles davis, and I am delighted to see him remembered in such a delicious manner."
"Notes: In my opinion this beer lives up to hype and delivers a symphonic or harmonious and Blues like interpretation of a stout beer. Well done!!!"
"Aroma is overwhelmingly chocolately, and it reminds me a lot of Rogue Chocolate Stout. Taste is similar except there's a little funky fruitiiness added. Maybe that's the gesho; I can't say that's a flavor that I can readily identify. It's certainly a different take, and on the plus side I can say that the ABV is hidden, but I'm not crazy about the taste. It wears me out pretty quickly."
"Pours a three finger brown head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Black color - no highlights. Good carbonation and heavy bodied. Nose is earthy and roasted coffee, flavor is same - earthy and roasted to burnt coffee. Not finding the honey. The higher ABV is hidden. $11.00 for a 750ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, ME."
"The quality isn't lacking in this beer, but a sense of cohesion is. There's no harmony with the key elements/characteristics within this beer, it's just a wham, and a bam, but there's no thank you ma'am. The palate eventually gets used to what is going on, however it still only remains an interesting experiment, but still a cacophany on the tastebuds. The jazz element doesn't translate as well across the palate."
"Hope you find some."
"It's not mind-blowing, but it's a good, solid ten dollar bottle of RIS. I'll be aging a few of these and will see what happens with time."
"drinkability is great - a very easy drinking impy stout with big flavors and a lighter body - i would like to see this brewed once a year"
"Maybe a bit thin in the mouth, but the carbonation is smooth. Not much warmth from the alcohol. I enjoyed how there is some roasty bitterness, followed by honey sweetness, and then bitterness again. Very enjoyable."
"Loads of honey which is a good thing. Mout seems a little thinner than the first time I had this. Roasted malt and bitter chocolate, earthy hop bitterness on the finish. Unmalted barley deep into the finish as well with some black fruit flavors."
"Full bodied, properly carbonated, creamy, and smooth. There is a lot to like about this beer. Too bad it isn't going to be brewed again."
"What more can you say this is a Fantastic Stout, i was lucky enough to score 2 cases for my store and got 3 bottles for myself, Sat back poured it into my dogfish snifter and put on the miles davis bitches brew cd.. What a great dark rich pour into the glass with a nice thick head. right off the top i could smell the dark roast and chocolate. The brew went down smooth and was very rich with a mouthful of flavour! Enjoy! if your lucky to try this one savour it!"
"Bitches Brew poured a gorgeous ruby read in color with a thick, billowing tan head. A nice nose of milk chocolate, toffee and honey spills out of the glass. The honey is very present in this beer and may be what helps to mellow out the traditionally stronger flavors of chocolate, roasted malts and toffee. As it warms you do get a bit of cherry on the palate and some roasted coffee beans too. The taste and mouthfeel are exceptional to most beers I have tried lately and really leave me wanting more"
"I apologize if it feels like I rushed through this, but a relationship of this distinction can't last and needs to be taken to bed quickly, if you know what I mean. It will be gone in the morning and all you'll have left to hold on to is a memory of a night in a smoky room, being serenaded by a saxophone, a piano, and a trumpet; you'll have a story you can tell to anyone who'll listen."
"M/D: Carbonation was right on, body was a little thin. Drinkability is average."
"D: A decent brew, but not worthy of the hype - the score is definitely inflated IMHO. The best part of this for me was the art on the label."
"Drinkability - yes. If they brew it again, I'll be ready. Fantastic beer, would age very well."
"Dark, black, thick, and solid...this beer has some presence. The aroma is interesting...there's a touch of honey, some chocolate character, a hint of wood, and caramel malt scents. It's an intriguing and very enticing scent that I originally found quite good, but that also continued to grow on me...I couldn't get enough of the aroma. The taste is equally interesting...dark malts, roasted barley, more wood character, less honey than in the smell, and an unexpected dryness. The dryness has a touch of chalk to it, but it doesn't become astringent, and seems to keep the beer in balance, since it's not overly bitter. Alcohol is well hidden, but is evident after half a glass (more from effect than from taste). The beer is very full in body, but the dryness still makes it easy to drink. Long finish...lots of complexity in the lingering flavor. This is a wonderfully enriching beer...worth the experience."
"(D)- A good RIS for sure. A nice mix of dry roasted components and sweet honey-like finish."
"This brew is not for me, but for those who like sour, you'll probably love it."
"Poured from 750ml bottle into snifter glass. Pours out super dark brown, almost black, with a brown head that sticks around and leaves good lace. Smell is odd yet playful. I'm getting all kinds of aromas like chocolate, wood, grain-seed, earth, and honeymustard. Intriguing nose, in a good way. Taste is super unique. Of course there's the obvious chocolate stoutiness, with roasted smokey malts with a touch of booziness. But then there's this flavor profile in the middle of sweet wood and earth that's hard to put words to. But it is very delightful. Maybe it's damp firewood and mild herbs. Anyhow, it's super unique and a fantastic twist to the tired formula of imperial stout."
"Great brew, I had to pick it up as it was the last bottle and all the hype around it. Very dark and sweet smelling. The taste is awesome with hints of honey here and there. A bit bitter aftertaste. Worth the hype I would say as well as the high cost. I would definitely buy 2 if they decide to brew it again."
"Drinkability: This one is quite good. I think it's very well balanced and would definitely search this one out again."
"I highly enjoyed it, and braved a blizzard to drive over an hour just to try this. If you get the chance to even get a sip, do it."
"glassware: tulip"
"Overall impression: Very nice brew, and the best stout I've tried from DFH to date."
"This Imperial Stout pours an eclipse black color from a 750ml bottle. Medium sized tan foamy head with nice retention and good lacing. The aroma is chocolate, coffee, honey and earthy. Medium to full bodied Imperial Stout. The malts are chocolate, coffee, roasted malts and honey. The hops are herbal and earthy. Nice carbonation. Nice smooth taste. The chocolate aroma fades a little as it warms. A touch of honey sweetness at the finish. Nice sipping beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Pours a dark black with a three finger foamy tan head. Slowly dissipates leaving incredible lacing all the way down. Nose is roasted malts, sweet toasty notes of cocoa and coffee. Auromas of honey and spices. Taste is outstanding. Huge upfront roasted stout flavour profile with a sweet honey middle and a long dry bitter finish. The ABV is perfect for this at 9 and is hardly noticeable. I appreciate this not being a boozy mess. Crafted with a lot of thought and special ingrediants. Amazing job Dogfish Head."
"T: Unbelievable. A little milk chocolate sweetness, then some coffee, dark chocolate, a wonderful earthiness and some roasted malt. Leaves a velvety coating in your mouth that makes you never want to drink another beer in your life. One of the best beers I've ever had."
"Drinkability: I'm glad I got ahold of this beer. It's not too filling, it's just the right amount of chocolate character, and an entire bottle is easily drinkable in one sitting. I'd definitely recommend picking one up."
"D: One glass is a meal; the bottle is gluttonous. Delicious, but I need a nap afterwards"
"OVERALL: Interesting and enjoyable imperial stout. The palate could be bigger, which would give the intriguing flavor profile a push, and the head a more persistent, but regardless, this is one of the more unique interpretations of the style. Probably the most enjoyable brew I've had from Dogfish Head to date, but not something I'd need to seek out again. Thanks again for sending one my way STEG."
"Overall- Finally got around to trying more than just a little sample pour of this. Not a world changer, but it does not dissapoint. Very drinkable for a 9% stout, the honey addition does wonders in smoothing this out. (3 more in the cellar for ageing/sharing :))"
"Cheers!"
"Poured into a chalice a very nice black color, very nice carbonation, with a nice little fizzy dark tan head, with lots of sticky lacing left behind, and small islands in the glass. The nose is malty, with lots of chocolate/toffee, and caramel. The taste is really nice, malty, sweet, chocolate/toffee notes, some vanilla, slightly roasted. Medium body, a nice creamy, slightly bitter finish. Very Drinkable, finally got a chance to try this one out, Thanks Pete."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, sweet, sticky, with an herbal kick at the end."
"Pours dark black with a good amount of brown head. Well carbonated and pretty. Smells roasted with a hint of honey on the nose. A great malt profile on the nose and tongue. Tastes sweet but dry. A solid roasted flavor that carries the beer. Very good mouthfeel despite the bitterness of the dark roasts."
"Thanks cam!"
"Poured from a 750mL bottle. A small tan head quickly fades to nothing. A very small amount of lace sticks to the glass. Aroma is sweet honey, chocolate, and a bit of coffee. Tastes are very earthy. Great balance of sweet malt and earthy hops. Like drinking dessert. A treat."
"This beer is too easy to drink. Delicious. Now I may be biased because this is a rare beer, but it's different and delicious and I am a big fan. Dogfish Head, you should make this every year."
"D: Good beer, bit price but definitely a very high class brew."
"Overall really well done, I was impressed, not the greatest thing ever, but very, very solid."
"Note: I was extremely saddened when Scott's son Alex jumped on the couch and knocked the glass from my hand as I was tasting it. I managed to save most of it, and it was well worth it."
"D-Very sweet makes for a drinkable brew, the 9% abv is low and makes for easy drinking."
" The flavor has a lot of toast and caramel with subtle cocoa up front. As you work your way in to the middle there is more honey flavor and less roast with slight fisherman's friend cough drop accent from the gesho root giving a clean woody and herbal flavor which is complimentary with the honey flavor. The stout is sweeter than most with the floral aspects of the honey giving the feel levity and making it less cloying than it sounds. The flavor strikes me like a toffee/honey candy bar with mild cocoa and light nuttiness from the roast with the honey pretty high in the flavor with the gesho there standing out slightly but not distracting from the stout flavor. I consider this very tasty and interesting in its own right. It has stout elements but for a pure imperial stout it isn't something I consider highly drinkable. I enjoyed this and understand the idea and concept but would probably only drink it if I was in the mood for a beer with honey flavor."
"Surprisingly drinkable, this. Balance is there and for its obvious strength it's really quite gentle."
"Drinks well for the style. I'd certainly like to drink this beer again. It very much grows on you by the time you're done with the bottle."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly light, smooth, with a slight hint of effervescence. Also, surprisingly drinkable for a strong, full flavored beer. Very good."
"Nice. A really pleasantly bold, but pleasantly leavened Imperial Stout. I'm nonplussed at the additions, I'm not sure they add much, but this is a very good beer nonetheless."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, just right carbonation and rich. This is a tasty beer, goes down well. I could have probably finished the bottle myself."
"D: Goes down easily, rather tasty, not too filling, well hidden kick, and a nice representation of style. Aside from the nose, this is a fabulous beer... but the nose on this just wasn't pleasant."
"d: DFH 750s have a checkered history with me, but I'm really glad I tried this one. An interesting twist on a big stout without being too twisted."
"Immensely drinkable imperial stout as the alcohol is well hidden. Combined with a low-medium body, I had to make sure I slowed down while drinking this as its similar to drinking chocolate milk if you don't pay attention."
"This is very delicious and quite drinkable for a beer with this much flavor and alcohol. Although it was highly hyped, I don't think it's undeserved-another awesome brew from dogfish head."
"Such a great, unique brew. Just when you though everything that could be done to a stout had already been done, DFH comes along and presents something new. Great job!"
"D: I split this 750ml with my girlfriend, and we thoroughly enjoyed it but would definitely not tackle a second bottle. Very interesting beer. Is it a fair branding of Miles' album? No, not even close, but I'm not offended. This is a nice beer and a cool concept. Knock back the carbonation and it would be a winner. Definitely glad to try it."
"D: A very smooth drinking experience which by no means stressed my palate to the extent that other rich stouts have. Some might be turned off by the sweetness but to me, this was an added complexity to the experience which really brought the beer to a new level of drinkable. Dangerous considering the abv."
"I know this story may not belong in the review but it was part of my experience with this beer and I wanted to record for anyone that might find it interesting or amusing."
"Drinkability: Certainly worth picking up just for the label, and that's not even discussing the contents inside. That said, I do think this was a great idea, and it was executed well. I think they achieved what they set out to do, and though it's not 100% my thing, I enjoyed it, and I hope they keep up the trend with these anniversary releases speaking to great pieces of art."
"This is probably the best beer I've ever experienced from Dogfish head. I have to give them real credit for this one and I hope it gets brewed again at some point. Just an all around amazing stout, one of the best I've ever had."
"D: Good beer. Worth a try. Good to drink. Worth the hype? Not nearly. That being said, I have several bottles I plan to age..."
"Matted and mellow on the palate. Creamy and slick throughout but ends with a semidry finish. Fluffier after a few warmed sips. Decidedly drinkable, especially for the complexity and, for lack of a better term, harsh components. A very enjoyable beer experience to be sure. Did not disappoint."
"Overall- Very good and highly recommended. Very stunning and I hope DFH produces more than just two batches of this beer. I wish I had another bottle for aging to see how the beer changes over time. I loved the twist on the stout and it was a blast to drink after rewatching the Brewmasters episode featuring Bitches Brew."
"Drumbeats keep everything rocking, keyboards add their licks, bass tosses in some grooves, and here and there our trumpet man sends out his signals. It's a wicked witchcraft thrown down here, alarms sent out to warn all, far and wide, of the crones doing deeds foul and offensive, ..this ale, though, ...we can taste and survive. The bitches brew will not do us in, this time."
"D: Pretty good beer, i'm glad I tried it but there are better Russian Imperials out there for a lot less money."
"D: Drinkable , yes to say the very least, smooth and creamy was in one word Dogfish. Always a pleasant time drinking something new from Sam and his awesome crew there in DE. See you all in the spring."
"D: Hard to finish more than a small glass, defiantly share this one with your buddies."
"M/D - Thick oily body, yet easy to drink."
"D: Solid, but nothing to indicate that this beer can hang with the big boys in this style... with the hype and price associated with it, I'll look elsewhere next time."
"I tend to be hit or miss with DFH and after a bunch of misses I had given up. This is a hit and DFH has once again gained my curiosity."
"I got over the fact that much of what I enjoy about RIS' (strong roast, strong booze) was largely subdued, if not absent. The sum of its parts are quite nice, however. This was a good one off, and I'm satisfied with having it just once. If you can get a hold of it, though, I think every (dark) beer lover should experience this."
"Can a Russian Imperial Stout be beautiful? I think so. Certainly the success of the television show made me more curious to try this one, but any allusion to Miles Davis is also a plus. I don't know what gesho root is. I have no idea what it tastes like, but I'd like to have more of it. Poured into a sniffer, this beer gave a rich and brown head that dissipated at a reasonable pace, leaving bubbles lingering on the glass. A thin layer remained on top. 9% alcohol they claim; tasted more like five or six percent. There is a distinguished roasted malt taste, but it isn't overwhelming. I would almost call it gentle. The brew is also sweet, maybe a little nutty. Definitely some chocolaty tones, but coffee notes are fairly subdued. The aftertaste lingers on the cheeks as any Imperial Stout must, but its changed just slightly. It's a bit sweeter, perhaps. In any case, your pallet will beg you to test another swig, and it'd be rude to refuse."
"Good beer. Really good. Just not sure that I will seek it out."
"D: This is a great twist on a RIS. I found this one to be interesting and packed with flavor. This is as drinkable as any 9% beer can be. Another solid offering from Dogfish Head."
"Drinkability: This was shared with friends and we all agreed that this was well worth drinking, that we'd be happy to have it again, but that it was also not a beer we'd make great efforts to seek out."
"For me this had high drinkability, as it went down very easy and smooth. The alcohol does not show up in the flavor, but that 9% hit me about halfway through the bomber. This is a much hyped beer due to the new TV show, and while I don't think that the experimentation factor wowed me, I must admit that I really enjoyed this beer and will try to secure another bottle for aging. A definite recommendation; get it while it lasts."
"This brew is tremendous; looks fantastic, drinks like a 5% alcohol brew. This brew is tremendous. Another homerun from Dogfish Head, who right now are doing things as a brewery that will always keep me a happy beer drinker."
"though this beer came up short, this is the most thorough and detailed review ive done and the experience of getting to sample this limited brew, along with all the preparation and excitement surrounding this gift, has also made it the most fun review."
"For a Russian Imperial very easy to drink loved every minute of it. The ABV was very evident but like I said easy to drink I hate high ABV's that are too overpowering!! I can't wait to get a bottle of this!!"
"D/O- Glad I got to try this one and also glad I split the bottle with a few people. The ""Brewmasters"" back-story on this beer makes it worth a little more than what it actually is though, I believe."
"Yet another exceptional brew from DFH."
"D: For a russian imperial stout this is incredibly drinkable. Not one that I would rush back to personally, but a great creative brew from Dogfish Head."
"Its a sipper!"
"I found this to be a fairly complex brew. It pours a deep black with an almost purple hued head. The aroma is rich with sweet honey, notes of oak and fruit. The taste is filled with dark chocolate, cherry, light smoke, red grape and a faint taste of the honey. The ABV is 9% but not overpowering by any means. The mouth feel is full with a lingering after taste that leaves woody, slightly bitter and fruity notes on the tongue. Overall I enjoyed the brew but it definitely would be better served in the winter vs. any other time of the year."
"This is the second bottle I've had from Batch 1. It poured a midnight, oily black with a dark, dark khaki head. The smell disappointed me this time around. It was much more aromatic when it was fresh. I didn't get the same honeycomb or the same earthy, tree bark aromas that I loved so much the first time around. The flavor has dropped off a little too, but being a RIS it still has excellent flavor. It just doesn't feature the t'ej like it used to. The honey is now more in the after taste and more noticeable only as you get halfway through your glass. Like most DFH 750s, the mouthfeel is perfect. It's very smooth and soft on your palate. This beer is extremely drinkable. You'd never even know it contains alcohol. I still love it, but as this review shows, it was better fresh and was far more complex. I believe that this deserved at least a 4.7 from me the first time. It'll be interesting to see how this changes in a year or two."
"D: To be shared among more than a few friends, the super strong flavors, pungent aftertaste, and heavy, dry qualities of the beer make for a brew where a dab'll do ya. Good for a small glass, particularly after dinner, but not something I'd want to reach for on a daily basis. It's worth the price and effort just for the uniqueness of it, something I'd definitely recommend trying and am so glad I could try, but fortunately considering the price and rarity, it's a a beer I'd only ever want as an occasional treat."
"Gorgeous jet black color with a very nice, tight looking tan head on top. Roasted and somewhat sweetish aroma. Very honey like. Ok roasted flavors dominate but the sweetness becomes a bit much. I understand the blend of flavors they might be looking for but it doesnt really work for me. Somewhat of a licorice flavor in the backround. No hint of alcohol. Nice, solid and full mouthfeel. Overall an ok beer for me. I have had this several times on draft and wanted a bottle to really form an opinion. Just doesnt fall into place as a great beer. Love the concept-just not the beer."
"Drank this the same night I drank Choklat, and was shocked at just how similar parts of them were, but this beer had what that beer lacked. I wish Dogfish would brew the pure imperial stout component of this beer, it'd be one of my favorites. The honey beer doesn't add very much, I found."
"Great beer, glad I got to try it."
"D - Drinkability is good, and overall it's an easy drinking and pretty good brew."
"Great idea, well done, but I don't think it would be worth the premium price with all of the other great stouts that are out there (rogue, founders, chicory)"
"My only complaint would be that the syrupy appearance of the beer was mildly disconcerting at first, but that faded after tasting it."
"A fantastic beer. The honey and gesho are fairly well hidden but add some nice subtle notes. More importantly, they keep this beer from being too sweet like most DFH beers."
"Jake"
"Still a great tasting, unique beer!"
"Bitches Brew pours with the color and consistency not unlike motor oil and immediately caught my attention. It's complex flavor was lively and morphed throughout the drink. Unlike too many beers with similar complexity, this one is incredibly smooth and subtle. Think gentle, deep tissue massage rather than hand chops. This one lived up to it's reputation for me."
"Drink- Like I said a unique beer that I was very glad I was able to grab a Batch 1 of. I recommend to try if if you have not done so yet."
"After hesitating for a special day to try this beer. I thought to heck with it. It's time to crack this one open and give it a taste.I think the appearance has a classic dark black color.With the tan lacing sticking to the side of my snifter. TASTE is well very enjoyable,very imperial.Its rich dark chocolate and roasted.I can't really taste honey or tej.I could enjoy this one often. If they decide to make more,but thats all folks enjoy while its around.Its just here to celebrate a really great Miles Davis record.Then its gone..."
"Overall I felt this beer was very good, yet somewhat of a letdown. The beer by itself was well made and a palate pleaser, but it was a little overhyped in my head by watching Brewmasters. Still, all things aside, it is a great brew that fills an open area in Dogfish Head's diverse portfolio, and would definitely be a beer I would consume more than once."
"An incredibly drinkable Imperial Stout, very, very smooth, this is going down way too fast! Got a bottle of Batch 1 aging in the cellar, but after having this I'm not sure it really needs any age."
"D: Average for the style."
"Very drinkable the alc is not readily apparent at all."
"I may have rated this beer a little lower if I was rating based on what the company advertised rather than the style is is listed as. As a RIS, this is fantastic, however, as a RIS blended with a honey/gesho ale, this doesn't measure up. There is next to no honey/gesho aspect to this beer."
"A hand full of medium brown head with lace cling from out of this world. Color matches a 40 on the SRM Beer color chart, and I didn't even have to look, this beer is black. Only direct sunlight will pierce the darkness and show a deep red hue. Smells of honey, chocolate, chicory, lime, wheat, and malt. Taste is very bold to the point of harshness, flavors that come through are honey, coffee, coco, anise, hops and malt. A bit too much wallop for every day drinking, and also, it is rare to find. I at least can say I have sampled one."
"D: This was good but nothing special. The scent and taste were decent, while the body was excellent. The alcohol was noticeable but not bad, so it wasn't difficult to drink. Age may help mellow it out, but I was generally unimpressed."
"I really enjoyed this beer. And I enjoyed it fast, actually. Definitely looking forward to picking up another bottle to age."
"It poured dark brown almost black with a tiny creamy white head that disapated quickly but did leave a lacing as I drank it. It to me had a smokey quality that I have to like in a beer. Again, this it not my first preference in style. Would I try it again? ABsolutely as I am refining and defining my beer tastes.."
"Not as flavorful as I like my Imperial Stouts, but a very good beer nonetheless. Not sure if it's worth $10 for 750mL though."
"The beer is a little acidic yet still creamy and rich. I think the acidic character helps smooth it out to an easier drinking beer."
"Awesome job Dogfish. As usual."
"Honestly, a good beer. Pretty much what I expected. It is a nice change of pace from the boozy, in your face bourbon stouts (which I absolutely love by the way). In terms of buying it again, if there is another release... depends on if I'm in the mood. I enjoyed by bottle a lot but wasn't super excited about it as I am about other RIS. Definitely worth a try"
"D - I enjoyed this beer a lot. Its very smooth and well balanced and surprising drank very well. I'm glad i had the opportunity to try this limited release beer and will buy again if i see it."
"I don't listen to alot of Jazz, but I watched a live performance of Bitches Brew before I drank this, and I see why Sam and the crew from DFH made this into a jazzy beer. There was flavors from everywhere, and I couln't get a constant pattern to things. At first, the beginning was really sweet, and finished with a roasty vanilla chocolaty malt feel, but about halfway through, the flavors changed up on my, and I was hit with the roast first and finished with the sweetness. I could detect the honey, chocolate, expresso, vanillia, caramel and some serious hop bitterness in the finish. Overall, a really great beer, and I am even more excited to revisit with some age attached."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable; while it's a little weak in body for an imperial stout, it's approachable for an otherwise intimidating style."
"D- An interesting beer but nothing really stand out about it. I didn't buy the beer for the hype, heck I didn't buy this beer at all, the lady did, but it was alright at best."
"D: Very drinkable for a RIS. I enjoyed this one."
"Having this while listening to the album! Thanks to Detral for hooking me up with this as an extra. Pitch black with some dark orange/ruby highlights, no head or lacing. Nose is an interesting mix of licorice, roast, some kind of floral sweetness that might be from the honey and maybe a touch of chocolate. No real hop aroma. Taste is a decent mix of roasted barley, although light, with chocolate, light honey, and some herbal ,earthy bitterness in the background. Kind of reminds me of a Toblerone candy bar. Could use a little more body and fullness, carbonation is tight. Booze is well integrated but comes out more as it warms. Nice beer, but not really what I look for in an imperial stout. I think them thick and heavy with a well masked alcohol character, which this has none of."
"it now before it goes down hill"
"This beer is not as wild and ""off-centered"" as typical DFH beers, but I believe it was done just right as a great beer collaboration with Sony. I recommend letting this beer sit for a few minutes to release carbonation....it is much better with less. I hope to cellar a bottle for a while, and that will be an easy thing to do if I am positive that Dogfish decides never to make this special brew again. Time to listen to some Miles Davis Bitches Brew."
"Full and rich mouthfeel, but slightly powdery, finishes a bit tannic. Delicious beer and highly drinkable, proud to have this one for a milestone review."
"pours a real nice opaque dark brown and puts up a thick 2 finger head - this stuff is thick -coats the glass and leavessome spotty lacing - smells like a nice roasty stout with a bit of sweetness - and WoW! this tastes really good! - a lot of subtle notes of chocolate, coffee,cocoa and maybe that gesho root, if i had any idea what that tastes like - and i can taste the honey in the finish - mouthfeel is right on, thick bodied without being syrup-ey - alcohol is dangerously well hidden - drinks very easily - great stuff"
"D: This is a very intersting blend (as expected from Dogfish Head) that provides for a more enjoyable experience after seeing how it was produced on t.v."
"Dogfish Head's Bitches brew is the liquid equivilant to the Miles Davis masterpiece. It represents the complexity and fusion of the musical piece as well as the creativeness. The appearance is dark and robust. The mouth feel is exceptional. This is a roasty, malty brew. Stout like in appearance but with an english strong ale feel. Dogfish Head has once again expanded the pallet of the educated brewer. Cheers!"
"Had it at POPe -Pub on Passyunk. I'm a HUGE fan of Dogfishhead, especially their 90-minute IPA. We saw it on the menu after having another IPA and went on the adventure.Bottle pour a lovely dark complexion into a wine glass, the serious appearance gave way to a damn good taste with knock-out affect. I can't wait to get me another."
"D - crazy drinkable for the style. The dual nature of the brew really shines here. Could easily consume dangerous amounts of this stuff..."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a tulip glass a deep opaque black with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is a nice blend of roasted malts, baker's cocoa and mild dried fruit. The taste is a smooth complex blend of roasted malts, dried fruit, cocoa, mild coffee and molasses. The beer is medium bodied with well hidden alcohol and nice mild carbonation. This is a truly delicious beer, I hope they make this at least an annual release."
"Drinkability - This one is very drinkable. I could have another glass of this without any problem whatsoever. Very tasty and delicious beer from DFH. Glad I was able to try such a brew. Well done, Sam and Company!"
"Over-hyped, but definitely worth trying."
"It's hard to get enough of this beer. One of my favorites from Dogfish Head so far."
"I had this with a honey bbq steak and it was great"
"D: Paired fairly well with rotisserie chicken but I'd love to try this again with a good basic hamburger or even a bowl of vanilla ice cream. Great session ability for a Russian Imperial!"
"The flavor is sweet, with very little perceived bitterness. The dark fruit, dark chocolate interaction is great here. I'm easily picking up blueberry, pomegranate, and cranberry flavors that integrate really well with chocolate notes. A mid palate sweetness is here that I don't find in a lot of stouts, which really brings the beer into another level. The ABV level for this style of beer is ideal for me, it has a big, robust profile but is easily drinkable."
"This beer pours pitch black, with tannish brown head nice lacing. The aroma is not particularlly strong, but I can twise out roasted malt, dark chocolate, some toffee and roasted coffee. The flavor is strong dark fruits, choclate, some roasted malts, some sweetiness. This is a smooth ber with a bold tasting beer, Great beer!!! It gets even better and more compex as it warms."
"D/M: smooth drinking yet incredible depth, great deep finish, leaves a nice lingering maltiness on the pallet"
"I appreciate what DFH was reaching for here, but I consider this another example of the hit or miss nature of this brewery when it comes to their special releases. I think this one one would improve with age by a bunch"
"Overall, this was a very intense and complex brew, and it is understandable for it's cannon in the beer community. I believe that this beer was a phenomenal accomplishment."
"this is a really nice RIS, the special ingredients are not as noticable as i might have expected however. one of the better beers from DFH and definatly worth a try. also very nice to see exactly how this was made and the story behind miles davis' ""bitches brew"". to me it just adds something to the brew and makes it that much more enjoyable."
"D- very nice. not mind blowing but pretty dang good!"
"D/M: The honey makes the beer very silky smooth and it really coats the palate with a rich flavor. Great sipping beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice creamy accent and good carbonation. Goes down smooth and is not overly heavy or syrupy in any way. This ranks up there as one of my fave DFH brews and I hope they continue to brew this one!"
"D: its a very decent stout but I don't think the blend of the african style honey and gesho worked mixed with a stout. All I tasted was a typical american stout. Good but not worth the hype."
"So I pour and to no surprise a thick rich multicolored head that stays for quite some time rises up and parks itself on top of an almost black brew. Tons of khaki colored lace. Light does not penetrate. Aromas of the usual RIS suspects. Coffee, chocolate, faint vanilla. Charcoal and burnt toffee. There are a bunch of layers here and only patience and will reveal them. Taste is smooth and full flavored. Burnt and charred sweet sugars and toffee. Nice big caramel malt core. Some firm earthy hops in the finish. Finish is clean and hoppy. Feel is thick and mildly carbonated. There is some creaminess which has you slowing down to savor each sip. Drinkability is super for a beer made this strong. There is no trace of alcohol the feel is warm and inviting."
"D - Very tasty, and a good take on a RIS. ABV within normal for the style; smooth and creamy feel lends to drinkability"
"D: I dig. For a beer of this strength, it goes down pretty easily. A quality Russian Imperial Stout that I'd be willing to pay for again, though dollar for dollar, I think one gets better value from Old Rasputin or even BBCS, two of my ""stand-by"" RISes. . . ."
"D: Easier to drink than expected, given the 9% ABV. I can imagine if you could find this in 8-ounce pours from the tap it'd be fantastic, especially if you took your time and let it warm a bit. The 1 pint 10 oz. bottles they sell in stores right now are a bit too much for one sitting though."
"I am glad I was able to to pick this up back in August before I had any idea the Brew Masters was coming out in November along with most of America, because otherwise I am not sure if I would have been lucky enough to get my hands on this bottle. I am sure you have noticed other Dogfish Head brews flying off the shelf since the 1st show aired."
"Great example and really fun to drink alongside such a cool show. Props."
"My first review and it was a great one. I wish DFH would make it year round as it is one of there best brews."
"Great to see a new shipment of this into Bestway,I thought I had missed out!Poured into a Guiness pint glass jet black with an impressive large mocha colored crown that left broken chunks of lace as it settled into a creamy mass.Mainly bitter chocolate and earth in the nose letting you know this has substantial hops going on here.What a balanced beer,the honey imparts nice sweetness at first sip but its not overly sweet,a big roast/earthy finish.This is hella nice,sweet and roasted,just great balanced,this is impressive Sam."
"D - I was actually impressed with this drink; surprisingly smooth; for a dark stout this actually drank very well and I could definitely have a few more of these"
"Overall: A good and original brew. I like the slight spice and honey presence and I think DFH could learn a lot from this beer. Extra ingredients are cool, but you don't need 300 of them taking up 20% of the mash. Good beer DFH, make more like this!"
"Drinkability: I liked the flavor, but there was just an absence of anything that really put it over the top for me."
"Delicious, this is one mightily drinkable Imperial Stout. The ""fusion"" characteristics that were put into the brew show themselves subtly, though; perhaps a ratio nearer to half-and-half Imperial Stout and Tej would have made it a bit more interesting. Undoubtedly the honey serves to lighten the body and raise alcohol content which certainly adds to the beer's character, and the gesho may be what adds that extra spice-like character, but overall the impression is more of a slightly-tweaked Imperial Stout than anything else. Can't fault it much overall, though, as this is most definitely one bitchin' brew."
"D - Pretty easy drinking considering the style/ABV. A nice twist on the RIS style. Certainly worth trying and I would drink another again anytime. That said I wouldn't go crazy trying to obtain it."
"I poured this brew into my sample glass at 45 degrees. The beer got much tastier the warmer it got. The beer was black and poured a thin head that was tan colored and it had decent lacing. The taste was chocolaty and had a slight smoke flavor to it. I liked the expensive beer and would buy it again."
"Save the light roast at the end, this says BSDA to me all the way. Enjoyable, no heat, very drinkable, & I liked the second half of the bottle as much as the first."
"D: While this isn't a beer I would drink a whole lot of, it is very, very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Certainly not something I would have as a session drink, but I had no trouble finishing the bottle in one sitting with a friend."
"Dogfish Head Bitches Brew is a dense, opaque, brown-black beer with a thick, foamy, brown head that has outstanding retention and leaves thick sheets of lacing on the glass. It has a huge, boozy, roasted aroma with notes of chocolate and smoke. It's full bodied and very smooth and soft. The finish is quick, dry and tidy. The flavors are bound very tightly. Smoke seems to be the most prominent. There is a slight flash of sweetness and a tanginess throughout the taste. It seems almost salty right before the finish. The aftertaste is bitter and kind of sharp. A dark, grainy flavor lingers. I can taste the tej up in my nose. This is a really solid imperial stout and the addition of tej gives it a unique signature. I bet it would go well with some injera."
"Overall amazing brew. I loved it. I was trying to get my hands on this one before the Brew Masters first episode. Now its hard, and im afraid some drinkers will waste this brew, when they discover its just not there style. For those out there looking for a great pick up and another hit by Dogfish Head Craft Brewery...this is the one."
"Very good Russian Imperial Stout to drink. Would definitely have another but have to wait til tomorrow."
"D- Very complex. Thickness and booze burn suffers the drinkability a bit. Very delicious, but a definite sipper."
"This is a fairly easy drinking beer that should be allowed to warm in the glass to let the flavors truly develop. I know this beer is blended with honey and other spices, but other than the dry body I did not detect them."
"Had on tap, served in a goblet. Pitch black - so black it looked purple in the low light. Brown head with nice retention and plenty of lacing. Chocolate, roasted barley and some coffee aromas. A bit earthy or woody, but mostly it smells like your typical imperial stout. Well roasted flavor, malty, plenty of chocolate and coffee up front. This changes to the interesting woody characteristics; earthy with lots of body and medium sweetness. Still quite smooth throughout."
"D: Very easy to drink (and easy to overdo it!), as it's smooth and easy on the alcohol taste, surprising for an 9% ABV RIS brew. Very delicious for a cold night!"
"D: Very drinkable and smooth stout -- the honey and cocoa flavors mellow the traditional roastiness and coffee flavors of what you might expect with a RIS, making this a bit more sessionable beer that what you would expect from a RIS."
"Pours a dark black brown with a good amount of caramal coloured head, poured in a brandy snifter glass. Tastes roasty with that creamy smooth finish that the honey ingredients brings to the table. I'm not picking up any heat in this at all and it drinks down very smooth. Incredibly easy to drink for an imperial stout."
"Just don't really see the appeal with this one. It's a good beer, but really nothing to get too excited about (IMHO)."
"D - Nowhere near the best RIS I have had but still a very enjoyable one none the less. Very nicely done."
"D= At 9% abv this beer was scary drinkable. I think the honey used in the brewing process fermented out almost completely so there isn't much flavor from that. All in all this is a great beer that I will be buying more of given the chance."
"D- The ABV was well hidden in this beer. I think a little extra time in the bottle did this beer well. Dogfish Head did well with this beer and I didn't think that was going to happen to be honest. Good job Dogfish...good job."
"Another world class offering from Dogfish Head made even cooler by being brewed for the seminal Miles Davis album of the same name."
"It's pretty good and I admit I did wind up buying it because of the show. I'll commit heresy and say that I went to listen to the album a bit. Terrible. Sorry."
"Pours dark, almost completely black with a nice tan head. Smells roasty, sweet, with whiffs of chocolate and spice. Tastes like someone took a really nice imperial stout and poured a sweet amber ale brewed with honey and tree bark into it, which is exactly what DFH did. It's good, but not great. Leaves me wondering if both beers blended to make this one would have been better off on their own. Rather drinkable, it goes down pretty smoothly, especially considering the ABV."
"Pours a jet black color with a large milk chocolate colored head that slowly settled into a puffy cap and left some nice chunk lacing on the glass. The odd thing, the head changed color. It started off dark brown then finished a brownish beige. The aroma has nice chocolatey notes to go along with the roasted malt aromas. Some charred wood as well. The taste starts off roasty with milk and bitter chocolate flavors. There is a vinous character that pops through. Some rust like flavors as well. Not much from the honey unless it added to the overall sweetness of the brew. The beer has a full body, a touch chewy, with soft-ish carbonation. Fairly sweet brew but it does have a roasty bitterness. This is a very smooth imperial stout. The honey beer smooths out the roasted stout which makes it damn drinkable. Don't pick up much from the other ingrediants but who cares, good stuff."
"But! I did not taste any of the honey this brew is supposedly made with..."
"Cool beer. Love Miles Davis and love the attempt at making a hybrid imperial and middle eastern sort of flavor."
"Poured a thick dark brown with a rich pillow-like head of three to four fingers in a snifter. Smelled like dark choclate, maybe a little smokey. Taste was largely similar, roasted chocolate up front, some dryness, followed by a slightly bitter darker chocolate taste, with a first what seems like a weird, indescribable aftertaste, which must be the Gesho sticks and leaves. Very smooth and easy to drink, which is dangerous. Mouthfeel is excellent, thick and rich surrounding your mouth with goodness. Drinakbility, I would say one and done, but enjoyed it."
"Overall, the best thing about this brew was how strong the flavor takes off right from the start. The first sip is like a punch to the tongue, and it doesn't let up. Essentially everything from the hefty aroma comes through doubly so in flavor, all with the brew remaining extremely smooth, creamy, and otherwise delightful."
"Excellent beer. Recently I had my first revelation of a stout mixed with honey, & now I must try them all. Bitches Brew not only delivered in that respect, but it would take a better palate than mine to peel back all of its layers."
"Bought at local Total Wine & More and poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Dark black with a thinner bubbly head. Not much lacing of the glass. The notes are of honey and roasted coffee beans. The taste is much the same as the aroma. There is a touch more of the honey that comes through. The spice reminds me of a mild spruce leaf. The carbonation is slight and the body is full. An interesting brew and one of their better experiments."
"very high. The ABV is kinda high but you can't taste the alcohol at all. Finding this beer is a bit tough, but I could easily finish a whole bottle myself. Luckily I have 1 more bottle. Hopefully they make more than 2 batches of this!"
"Relatively drinkable, I look forward to finishing this bottle throughout the evening."
"D - overall a extremely enjoyable beer I would put this easily in my top 5 but that is my taste. not a everyday beer but maybe for the holidays or a wedding etc. Dogfish head has def outdone themselves on this one kudos."
"This beer was fantastic and well worth the try. It's one of those that you can enjoy and not get totally filled up on."
"This is a very well balanced and blended beers. I really enjoy the honey sweetness and earthy qualities that are imparted onto the RIS part of the beer."
"D - Definitely a different flavor profile for an RIS with the fermented honey and gesho. But altogether a unique beer that is very drinkable. Lots of dark roasted malts and earthy flavors. So smooth and the abv is almost undetectable."
"D: Wonderfully drinkable, with just enough alcoholic bite to stop me in my tracks. Even though there is still a good bit of this stuff left on the shelf around here right now, this sucker is going to be a collector's item. I need to hop to it and grab some more ASAP!"
"I like it. Tastes like a mild RIS and is quite drinkable."
"D - A sipper. A little disorganized but the flavors complement each other nicely. I had a hard time noticing the Tej beer which is a bit disappointing but the stout is still very good!"
"The mouthfeel is silky, with low and lazy carbonation. The effect of the feel combined with the chocolate ice cream flavor is something like drinking the tail end of a root beer float. This is an excellent imperial stout. A half-step off the truly elite examples, but damn good. I need to grab a couple more bottles before they run out, because I'd love to see what some age does to this brew."
"Overall, I really liked this one. Its an RIS that might be a little bit more accessible to non-RIS drinkers. Its also one of the beer Dogfish Head beers I've had so hopefully it comes out regularly. Give it a try. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Again, this one takes a little while to drink. This is best enjoyed slowly, and whilst listening to Miles Davis."
"This is a nicely drinkable brew. DFH was not messing around on this one. Fantastic."
"Drinkability is large! I heard they've just brewed a bunch more due to the Discovery show, so I will be stocking up and cellaring Batch 2."
"Definitely a great beer!"
"A fine beer, fitting of the tribute. Well received."
"D - goes down smooth and easy."
"M/D: Medium bodied, but a bit thinner than I expected and hoped it would be. Very smooth drinking. Overall, quite enjoyable. Would score a bit higher for me if it were a bit thicker and the alcohol was masked a bit more. I will probably wait a good bit to pop my other bottle."
"D - Nicely done and drinkability runs moderate to moderately high."
"Notes: I enjoyed this bottle while listening to Miles Davis' album 'Bitches Brew' while paired with French Dip sandwiches I made. This is an amazing beer that I will be sure to try again; before they are all gone."
"Pours a solid black with a good sized long lasting creamy tan head that leaves a respectable amount of lace on the way through the glass. Smells of roast coffee and chocolate. This also has a sweet maltiness and an herbal minty aroma that I can only assume comes from gesho root. Mix that all together with a touch of ethanol and you get an unusual and unique aroma. I get the usual stout like tastes of chocolate and roast but this one has a bit more going on. I get a spicy minty herbal character that almost gets to the point of turning me off, but then subsides. I am reminded of the woodiness that I get from Palo Santo Marron. Long lingering roasty and menthol finish. Medium body and carbonation with a creamy/oily mouthfeel. I'm not sure I would call this a RIS, but then again how would you classify it? I was put off with the herbal flavors a little bit at first, but as I polished off my first glass it was growing on me. Nice to try this because it is a bit different, but probably not something I would seek out again."
"worth a try! very interesting take."
"Not understanding all the hype here, another dfh let down, at least its only gimmicky in name and not as much in ingredients."
"Often times Dogfish Head falls off the deep end with their experimentation, but this one seems to be well thought-out and it was a great idea, a delicious brew."
"A very surprisingly tasty beer from DFH. I don't know why I didn't expect much, but I'm pleasantly surprised. A must try!"
"Interesting beer but not nearly as revolutionary as Miles Album. It's totally worth seeking this out just for the story behind it, plus it's going to be featured on the first episode of the new Discovery Channel ""Brew Masters"" series so you can brag about it with non-beer people."
"D: I had no problem drinking the entire bomber by myself. 9% with no alcohol heat, good flavor. Excellent brew."
"D - This is a really interesting RIS. It is quite tasty with an unusual aroma."
"Very interesting brew, and a nice tribute to a seminal album. I've been interested in what Gesho tastes like, and I like how it works here. I think it adds an earthy herbalness and is a bit sharper than hops. My wife, however, thought it was a menthol-like mess and didn't like this at all. Kudos for the effort. Pours black with a beige head that settles to a ring. Smells chocolatey, and with notes of molasses, and a dusty spiciness. In the taste you get an interesting blend of chocolate, more herbalness, some clean but not too sweet honey notes, a bit of spice, and a fairly sharp herbal finish. Smooth and mouthcoating, with a bite. Quite nice and very interesting."
"D- This is great beer. If this was an every day option I would opt for it over some of my more standard stouts such as Yeti Or Ten Fidy....but, Its not in the same league as the big boys. I hope this gets made again or a similar variation arises. If it does though I wont be paying 12 dollars for it as I would rather have ten fidy or yeti for cheaper."
"Drinkability: In that complex world of Dogfish Head beers, I will put this one on the side of the winners"
"D: Innovation is a lovely thing, in both beer and jazz. I appreciate what DFH did with this stout, taking not-so-subtle twists to make the brew both interesting and delicious. Good beer, based on a great album. Yum."
"The dominant flavors are over-roasted malt and coffee, a little smoky bitterness too. Nearly acrid with a bitter aftertaste that is at turns pleasing and revolting (more pleasing though). Not much honey that I can taste. Full-bodied, matching the strong roast, a serious sipper."
"Pours a black black, very dark. Thin mocha colored head. First sip is coffee, with a hint of toasted malts. Next few sips yield something else as well. There is a nice little twang of sweetness at the end of each sip as the beer warms. It may be the honey used in the brew. Its really nice. It balances out the bitter from the coffee and malt notes. Plus it makes it very easy to drink for an Imperial. I like this one, its simple yet still brings a different twist to the style."
"I think the drinkability is right on. A high quality RIS, just outside the top tier looking in."
"m/d- Full bodied and goes down extremely smooth. Nice overall beer."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is light and smooth, the alcohol leaves some burn but not bothersome. Reasonably drinkable, something worth having once...key word, once."
"Flavor wise, I was expecting a little more and it was a decent stout but nothing impressing."
"One hell of a Russian Imperial Stout. I opened this beer and let it sit for about 20 minutes before enjoying. Complex, robust and just plain awesome."
"Dogfish Head aimed to create a beer that was as bold a fusion of elements as Miles Davis's 'Bitches Brew' album, and they succeeded there. While this is certainly interesting and unique, I don't know that I'd want it very often, and I doubt it will be as influential on the greater beer scene as the namesake album it takes inspiration from. But that's asking the impossible...and that's one of the things I like so much about this brewery: their willingness to transcend boundaries, the same way Davis transcended genre limitations."
"D - Drinkability is way too high for a Russian Imperial Stout! An impeccable balance between roasted coffee and sweet honey and vanilla, this one doesn't wreck or bog down the mouth like other beers, and the thick mouthfeel and creamy texture helps it from suffering from a watered down feeling that sometimes plagues the style. A great representation of the style that really hides the alcohol well."
"A very solid RIS, but I don't get anything added from the ""gesho root."""
"D: Pretty drinkable for a 9% RIS, the tartness holds it back some. Overall a good beer, but not anything that I am completely blown away by."
" The stout is bitter where it counts, in the back beat. The sweetness is in the center stage pulling back for the finish. Each sip is very enjoyable and easy to drink. I am quite relieved that this was not an over the top booze bomb. Too many times an RIS get a pass for aging well or being so high in ABV. Sweentess from honey that does not come across in any was as cloying can only come from a master of his craft. Miles would deem this Brew ""cool"". I must agree since my glass is already needing topped off."
"A really nice beer."
"Overall, a very nice offering from DFH."
"D: this one is awosme, wish is was a year round beer."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a warm, roasted scent along with a nice chocolate flavor and plenty of hops. The taste is great as well. It has a rich, black and chocolate malt flavor. It goes down slow and smooth with a good deal hops and a dark chocolate finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good stout. It's full flavored and tons of character."
"Alcohol flavors are present, but not in the forefront. Well masked, giving only a warming effect."
"Good beer, not my favorite among the style. Definitely looked really impressive. For the money I'd buy a different RIS, but it is worth a try."
"Overall, it's a winner, and the taste and appearance conjure Africa and the weird smoothness of Miles' album."
"Drinkability - Dogfish Head has done a great job crafting this beer. Big roasted flavors, a unique back story, good drinkability, and a good balance of flavor. I am glad that I had the chance to purchase and try a bottle of Bitches Brew."
"Drinkability: An interesting beer that I think was trying harder to be more interesting than it ended up being. At the end of the day, this beer is a pretty solid, sweet, and slightly spicy RIS with minimal hop characteristics ... sometimes, DFH's novelties are more psychological than tangible (""This beer contains an ingredient from every continent!"") ... though contrary examples certainly exist (""This 120 minute tastes like hop rum ..."") ... but this is certainly one of those times. And that's not necessarily a bad thing: sometimes, the posterchild for off-the-walls crazy novelty beers needs to put out something that tastes pretty gosh darned normal, and this is a good example of precisely that."
"All in all , not a bad RIS but far from being ready now. In time it might be great, time will tell."
"I had no idea what to expect when I opened this one. Honestly, it's not the trailblazing, left of center brew you might anticipate from DFH. It's a good stout that features all the usual stout elements. There's a little honey and a very light herbal scent and flavor (that could be gesho root), but those are relatively bit players here. All in all, it's a good stout. Needs more body, but a good stout nonetheless. Definitely worth picking up, whether you're a bitch or otherwise."
"Overall this is a great success from Dogfish once again and it's offered at a very reasonable price (at least where I found it) Not sure if it would age well; it is already really really smooth and drinkable. Consume and enjoy now, while you can find it."
"D - Overall I must admit I am somewhat disappointed with this one. I love Russian Imperial Stouts and usually Dogfish Dead does not let me down, but this one is off the mark..."
"Drinkability: Not too bad for something of this size, but one must remember that it's 9% and a little on the heavy side. If it was actually thicker and smoother, I may even increase this by just a little bit because I would feel like it matched the style better and it would have come closer to meeting my expectations. DFH doesn't disappoint, but it is just a tad off with this one."
"Notes: A fitting tribute to an absolutely great album. Another great job by Dogfish Head."
"M - Thick, silky, chewy. Lightly carbonated."
"DFH Bitches Brew is fine, but not fantastic if you ask me."
"Thanks Dan, for bringing this one back from Vegas for me. Pours a huge, jet black color, with a good finger of mocha colored head. Nice aromas here, plums, dark chocolate, black pepper and prunes. Full bodied, thick, rich, very sweet, alcohol is very well hidden. Dark chocolate and honey, with a light hoppy finish. Pretty good."
"I had to do a double-take concerning the 9.0% ABV, since this has such a smooth taste. I believe that this is a limited edition, so I'm already planning on running back to the distributor to lay my hands on a few more bottles."
"Served in my Old Stock snifter. Pours one shade shy of black with a quarter inch, mocha-colored head that disperses into a thin, consistent skim and a tight band around the edges of the bowl. Nose suggests dark, roasted malt, cocoa nibs and artificial sweetener. Taste follows nose, with the addition of a honey character, a hint of cardboard and a muted spicy/earthy quality that his hard to characterize but I would assume is attributable to the gesho root. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a mild, even carbonation, a trace of acidity and a pleasant, creamy texture. Definitely one of DFH's more drinkable experimental brews. That being said, share this beer with at least 2-3 other people. I did enjoy the opportunity to try this, but probably wouldn't seek it out again."
"So in the mouth the grape hits but is dominated by coffee before it is too sweet, finnishing with a chocolate coating. Mouthfeel is real nice - well balanced and wicked smooth without scimping on flavor. There is a spice in the smell and taste that allude me. The beer pairs perfect with the chilli."
"Also I thought that this beer was a Excellent match for Chili. I took Sam's advice and it worked wonders. One of my personal favorite pairings thus far."
"This truly was a remarkable beer. It pours jet black into a snifter with a lovely milk chocolate head about half an inch. There are so many aromas present that I have never smelt before (gesha I presume). The taste is of course very roasty and pairs excellent with some chocolate to really enhance the flavor. Excellent going down and the alcohol is damn near hidden. A true treat that is incredibly drinkable, not to sweet or bitter, and minimally carbonated."
"Notes: For something built up on provocative fusion this feels a bit tamed, a bit of an exercise in composure, and it does it well. Wondering about the use of gesho as a substitute for the hop bill... In any case, it all comes together in nice sync and makes for a good brew, albeit one that I will probably not think much of after this tasting."
" D- This beer has some nice roasted flavors with some very subtle support flavors and a possible gesho quality but it could just be my mind inventing it after reading the bottle. I didn't get any honey/mead qualities except for the thinned body perhaps and this beer is a bit one-dimensional, but it is a tasty dimension."
"D: This beer's merit rests on its quality alone, but its uniqueness earns it even more points. Highly recommended."
"I really enjoyed this one... Had it been more substantial and thicker, it would have been elite in my book due to the unusual smokiness mingled in here... As it, its still a damn terrific brew that I will pick up more of..."
"D= The taste and smell did a good job hiding the alcohol pretty decent RIS need to get a couple for the cellar."
"Definitely great drinkability in this one. It goes down tremendously smooth, leaving only a bit of warming alcohol in the chest to enjoy."
"M: Very dry for the style. Well attenuated. It really drinks like a dream and I keep reaching for my glass. This is the best new Dogfish beer I have had in a while. This should be a seasonal. Love the MD album too."
"Wow! This craft is exceptional. I loved this one as soon as I poured it into my glass. The appearance is of rich dark chocolate, with a beautiful tan head to cap. A pleasant nose of chocolatey molasses and espresso with hints of crystalized brown sugar, make your eyes roll back into your head. The taste is perfectly balanced with roasted malts and an undertone of honey, but very silky and luscious on the palate-Not sticky sweet. The carbonation dances in the glass, and tickles the tongue- just enough. Extremely drinkable for a 9% ABV stout. Somewhere Miles Davis is grinning.Mmmm Yummy."
"D- Not hard to drink if you can get past the antisceptic qualities. It wasn't awful, but there was definitely something off about this offering. Very unfortunate for me to consume and would not drink again. Glad to tick it though!"
"- Very nice brew, dry, not to sticky syrupy sweet at all... like a really well blended imperial stout. Certainly a must have. Wish I had another to sit on for about 8 years."
"D - This is a strange one, it looks extraordinarily dark, but doesn't have the sort of intense roast character that I would have expected. There is a lot of dark, sugary malt and spice in this beer. Molasses and dark caramel dominates the aroma and flavor with some earthy spice thrown in to keep things interesting. It is relatively dry, especially considerign the sugar character, but a bit more bitterness, either from grain or hops would have made this a more drinkable beer. This might improve with age, but it leans more toward sweetness than roast, and to me that argues against it being a beer that will really benefit from time in the cellar."
"Have to say this beer is nothing mind blowing but a very solid offering and miles (no pun intended, seriously) ahead of any other DFH stout I've tried to date. I'll wait on my other bottle for a year or two and see how it develops."
"Drinkability: A very fun experience. I can't wait to see what this tastes like a few years down the line. Nicely done!"
"D - Pretty decently drinkable for an impy stout."
"Pretty good beer here from DFH, enjoyed it with a buddy while listening to Bitches Brew. Pours jet black with some dark brown head, a really nice looking stout. Smell is good, but somewhat run of the mill actually--roasted malts, coffee, chocolate. Taste is a bit different--a nice sturdy stout base with some interesting spicing to it. Can't quite pin what the spices are, but I'm imagining it's the gesho root. MF was full and creamy (though this doesn't seem to be the consensus opinion--it wasn't especially thick, though, just pleasantly creamy). Decent drink. Good beer overall, just not exactly what I was expecting. Maybe some time will do this beer good."
"not a bad beer, but whatever. more could have been done to honor miles davis. meh."
"D: Ok. Will not seek again though. Perhaps this will taste better with years in the cellar, but I'm not overly hopeful."
"D: Awesome for 9.00% ABV. Balanced to the point where I drank it down while watching TV with no heed to alcohol, even after it warmed. Glad I have another one to age!"
"D - Delicious, easy drinker. Wish I had more bottles."
"Overall I'm not terribly impressed with this brew. Overly sweet and rich with little roast just mostly chocolate and licorice. Just alright."
"D - Well I really didn't expect too much out of this brew. Yes at least an A rating and it wasn't too terrible for being a weird brew from Dogfish but to complain I didn't get too much honey or coffee which is hard to bitch about in this brew (pun intended) but I don't see myself having it again because of its nostalgia. A good brew to try though!"
"Black with a head similar to that on an espresso- thin layer of very fine brown bubbles. Head has very short lifespan and lacing is minimal. Cocoa aroma with hint of sasparilla. Root beer character probably comes from gesho root, whatever that is. Sweet, very rich. Body thin for the style. It has an unusual wintergreen flavor in the finish. It also has something of a chicory flavor. Quite enjoyable by its own oddness, but lacks viscosity for RIS."
"D - Another great job by the guys at DFH. They are definitely raising the bar by brewing with abnormal ingredients. Bought an extra bottle to cellar :)"
"D- Really a great, easy to drink 9% ABV beer. The taste really makes it worth trying. I feel the only down fall is the mouthful is too light. I may try to get another bottle or two for aging. Definitely worth trying, just another unique beer from DFH."
"The flavor was a bit different. Sort of an herbal, medicinal taste, with an odd aftertaste. Pretty sweet for what it was. Some milk chocolate, nutty flavors noted, but the finish was just odd. Creamy, thick mouth. Luscious. Drinkability was hindered due to the depth, ABV and odd flavored-finish. I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't pay this price again for it."
"Screw it, I'm changing my numbers to reflect how I would rate this beer this time."
"D: This was ok, but there's no way I would buy this expensive, weird beer again. It was fun to try."
"9 percent??? I would not have guessed it. Slightly warming at worst. Very well hidden. I actually really enjoyed this one. Hopefully they may bring this one back in the future."
"It was a easy to drink stout I could have grabbed a second glass if available. I will grab a second bottle to age some and see how things settle out"
"D: A very enjoyable and unique RIS. I think DFH did create a beer very much in the theme of the album they named it after. The only upsetting thing about this beer is I might not be able to try this one again. Hope they consider brewing this one again."
"This brew looks like one tasty bitch. It pours a nice viscous darkness that is topped by a finger of light brown foam. The aromas are similar to cocoa nibs and bit of coffee. Other smells I detect range from oak to woodsy characters like maple. I believe that I detect a hint of orange zest as well on the nose trailed by the alcohol vapor. The taste is unbelievably good. The flavors I believe exist are cocoa powder, the hint of coffee, marshmallow, what seems to be the smooth spiciness of root beer, some either molasses or brown sugar as well as some honey mixed it to smooth it all together. Damn, this thing is smooth as silk for being this high of gravity. If it weren't for the alcohol, which you can barely taste in my opinion, I could seriously drink this all night long. This is a fantastic beer one of my favorites all time."
"I was more than pleased with the test batch o' this, so the real thing has me jazzed indeed. It pours a deadly black topped by over a finger of darkish tan foam. The nose comprises molasses, roasted malts, brown sugar, toasted marshmallow, and a touch of orange peel. The taste is nearly identical, though the honey lends a decent amount of unique sweetness in there as well. Strangely, the finish is rather abrupt, as though the flavors were flash evaporated (remember all that science-y crap we learned from Armageddon and History Channel shows about the end of the world?). Weird. The body is a stolid medium, with a light carbonation and a very smooth feel (almost nitro-tap smooth). Overall, this beat out the test batch. Man, am I glad I got to sup from this fount!"
"An interesting RIS, the gesho adds some earthy qualities I wasn't expecting. Very nice stout from DFH."
"the drinkability is very good for the complexity and abv (which by the way is remarkably well hidden). overall a fantastic beer, one of the best from DFH in quite a while. a shame it's a one-off."
"D: Yeah..."
"D: High on flavors and easy drinking, this classic stout shows how different the style can be pushed. The worst part when you are done, is that you are bitchless, damn seek this bitch out."
"Finger plus of very dark brown foam, full mix of bubble sizes but does have adequate retention, minor stick to the lacing. Pitch black liquid, full opacity with nary a trace of color. Thick roast to a nose that is otherwise motor oil thick, dark chocolate, chicory, vanilla powder, café au lait, little bit more orange marmalade than pine or flowers, eventually run down by maraschino cherry and raspberry jam fruit accents, eventually becomes so dense you can't parse much more out. Full-bodied, the carbonation has fluff factor and adds to the overall creamy mouth feel. Coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, honey and caramel vivid but actually not that sweet. Comes off more as slow roasted than crisp and toasty. The florality struggles to be heard. Hint of clove, cinnamon stick spice. More brioche than bread or yeast. Loses some palate weight at the end but there's sufficient retronasal action to keep it alive. Impressively scaled, curiously could stand to be sweeter."
"No holds barred - a nice big beer that at times seems to waver between a RIS and a Baltic porter. Bold roasted malt flavors - unsweetened chocolate and coffee with chicory, some vague charcoal and deeply toasted bread. Mouthfeel was the slightest bit syrupy. Very assertive and smooth."
"A medium to full bodied brew with a moderate level of carbonation. Quite drinkable and a nice lingering aftertaste of roasty malt and alcohol persists. Worth a try."
"Pours a very dark black with a medium tan head. Scent is very strong in roasted malts and roasted coffee. A bit of black licorice as well with slight honey sweetness. Taste is initially a bit boozy but then I get a very roasted barley-like taste followed by chocolate/coffee sweetness. Definitely has some honey notes with a bit of earthiness as well. It definitely is beginning to taste better and more well-balanced as the beer warms up a bit. This beer has a nice thick feel to it without being chewy or too creamy. Drinkability is fairly high for an IRS. Love Miles Davis, by the way...and this album."
"Great label art, great company, and promises of an extraordinary adventure of a beer. It's a very good imperial stout, but with all the innovation and creativity they cross to Miles' music, I didn't taste the connection. It's a deep brown/ red stout when poured with a heavy cocoa scent. There's a solid stout flavor and smooth current to the way it flows, but it's lacking the ""something special"" I yearned for from reading about it."
"It smells very roasted with some sweetness in the background. It almost reminds me of the Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale with the way it smells but this has more sweetness in it. The taste is so smooth and rich its ridiculous. Like I said before it has that taste of the Dogfish Head Indian Brown ale but with less carbonation (if any at all) and less hops. You can tell they not only use the hops but something different to give it that different bitter taste on the back end which would be that gesho root. The honey they use in this doesn't so much give it a honey taste but rounds out the beer by making it smooth, thick and silky in texture. Stouts aren't my very favorite but this to me is the 90 minute IPA of stouts. With that higher alcohol content and richer full body taste. I'm really liking this one and haven't found a limited release or year round release from Dogfish Head that I don't like. I usually wouldn't have many of the flavors and ingredients they use in their beer but whenever I have their crazy recipe beers I always end up liking them because of the blend and the way they use them in the beer. This is strongly recommended to anyone that likes Imperial Stouts or wants a full bodied complex high alcohol content beer."
"Bitches Brew is a good idea on many levels, but ultimately the beer is pretty unimpressive."
"D- Very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Pours pitch black. No light getting through this bitch. Foam dissipates quickly to a light brown ring. Sweet malt and coffee scent. Very nice. Maybe it has something to do with the honey? The first thing I get is sweet coffee and malt. The sweetness fades but the coffee taste lingers with some smokiness at the finish. Has a lighter mouth feel than I expected but nice. This is an easy drinking Russian Imperial Stout. Goes down pretty quickly. I could probably drink a few or at least the whole 24."
"The bottle is a keeper, by the way. The art work is from the classic Miles Davis album ""bitches brew"" as this beer celebrates the 40th anniversary of the album."
"Overall, I would recommend there beer for anybody and enjoyed for special occasions since this is a rare breed of beers. I can't wait to get my hands on another one of these if possible."
"D - Very good RIS that's smokey and sweet. Bring this one on the next camping trip. Probably goes well with smores."
"Cheers..."
"Smooth and heavy in the mouth. Finished the bottle myself and was craving more as the final sip went down. As a casual/passive Davis fan, I've never heard the entire album in question but will give it a listen ASAP!"
"T: Taste of strong cocoa, delicious caramelized sugars present in here with some vanilla, honey and some sweet dark fruit. Finish is slightly wet as I like a stout, not dry and ashy. Relatively thin I thought for the style although quite flavorful and very smooth. I can definitely appreciate the smooth body of this beer especially for a RIS. One of the thinner but smoother stouts I have had and with a nice slightly belgian feel to it. Well done DFH, my favorite large format bottle from them..."
"D - Very solid RIS. I enjoy other better but still its interesting to have the honey and the Gesho in there. Drinkability is higher because the booze isn't as perceivable in the flavor."
"A good brew. Perfect without pairing but rather as a dessert beer by itself. Only drawback from being great is the general weakness of the aroma. Definitely worth checking out for yourself."
"Thanks to my gf for this. Pours deep drown/black with a dense chestnut head. Fades to a chestnut ring. Smells like milk chocolate, vanilla, and light aroma of coffee some roasty malts. Could be more aromatic, but nice. Flavor makes up for aroma. Strong chocolate flavors, vanilla, slightly oaty, nice malt charecter with very light bitterness, finishes with a clear coffee note and then clean. Drinks real well for a ris. Clean finish, not cloying, a pleasure to drink. One main complaint, less dense and rich then a ris should be."
"Overall, DFH really is not one of my favorite breweries. Seems like they can brew a few good beers, but the rest of them are either overpriced, too much of an experiment, or just bland."
"Drinkability is very good. This would make a nice night cap. Not feeling the alcohol at all, can finish the whole bottle solo in one sitting. I wish I had one (or ten) to cellar."
"Enjoyed with Real Time playing...is anything better than beer and politics?"
"Pours an opaque very-dark-brown / black with fizzy fast-fading reddish brown head, leaving a few blobs of thin lace. Smell: sweet, plum, vinous, nutty, mild earthy hopping. A bit different. Taste: upfront sweet with dark brown sugar, plum, toasted nuts, earthy and slightly grassy hop hit mid sip, fades into pale/pils malt and a hint of honey (reminds me of a tripel), with a semi-dry vinous finish. Mouthfeel: it's really light bodied for an impy stout, though the carbonation level is not unpleasant. Actually quite easy drinking for an imperial stout... a different take by DFH as usual. Bottled in 2010."
"Overall, I think my review is clear in my satisfaction. I love this beer. If I had one wish, it would be that they decided to make it year-round or as a seasonal. Should I start the petition?"
"Pours jet black with a brown head. In the aroma, licorice, roasty coffee, and a Belgian like yeastiness. In the taste, roasty coffee, honey, and quite Belgian like. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry coffee aftertaste. A bit sweet, but nice none the less. Almost Belgian like thoough."
"Bought two, saving the next for a rainy day... Cheers"
"Poured a solid super deep brown/black. Small head with tiny splotches of lace. Chocolate dominates the smell. It's mixed in with a bit of fruit and a bit of earthy hops (but only when it warms up a bit). The taste and mouth are much better. Super smooth going down. Chocolate, slight coffee, dark fruity malts, slight bit of alcohol and a slight bitterness from an unknown hops (rounds it out a bit). I also detect a herbal(?) taste, gesho root maybe, and the honey adds a minor sweetness, yum. I most certainly will grab a few to cellar. A worthy tribute for Miles Davis I guess (though I don't know if stouts are a Miles Davis type of brew). I'm sure he would appreciate the complexity though."
"A really nice brew and worth seeking out. Being a big Miles fan, I had to try this, and I'm glad I did. I look forward to returning to it again."
"D: The beer is relatively easy to drink because the alcohol is well masked. I never would have guessed that this beer is 9% abv."
"D: It's an Imperial Stout, a bomber is plenty. I'll probably be sipping on this over the course of the next few hours."
"M&D - quite smooth, un-complex, nearly silky on the palate, rich full flavors that linger on the palate long after the sip, another quality DFH beer"
"Wasn't expecting this one to live up to the hype, few DFH special releases do, but this is an excellent stout. Worth every penny, just wish I had bought a few bottles for the cellar."
"D- Overall, an interesting beer that is definitely worth a try. The base beer is a solid imperial stout. The honey adds a nice level of sweetness. I'm not sure what a gesho looks/smells or tastes like so I'm not sure exactly the edfect that it has in this beer. Overall, Bitches Brew is a solid beer that is definitely worth a try. Recommended!"
"Dark roasted malts bring on a very dark pitch black color with a tan mocha head forming with tight bubbles. Fine initricate detailed lacing spreads nicely on my La Fin du Monde chalice. Aromatics offer up dark roasted chocolate mild creamed coffee and a nice earth bound honey sweetened dark ale. It's got stout roots with definite variants going on, solid ale any way you classify it. Exotic smells with an air of booze soaked fruit, very intense aromatic insense like notes. A sharp sweet coffee note, dark chocolate dry bitterness from the dark malts. Sweet but not sticky honey coated malts, earthy back ground I'm not sure what effect Gesho root has on the party but I'm a fan. BIg luscious malt layers and fruity booze notes blend to form a nicely balanced black ale. Mouthfeel is carbonated enough to carry these aggressive flavors with out becoming to bubbly or falling flat, medium to fuller body carries itself well on my palate. Drinkability is excellent I a beer I can handle on my own or preferrably with friends, intense dark malt driven flavors that challenge the senses and stimulate a craving for more."
"Pleasant flavor, not overly roasty but more sweet and fruity. Thinner body, but not thin, medium overall with low to moderate carbonation. Dry, vanishing aftertaste, hints of honey and sawdust. Some astringency, thankfully doesn't linger, but is distracting enough. Alternately creamy and smooth at times, with a clean simple roast barley flavor, honey traces, not really bitter... astringency must be the gesho root. Interesting to try once, can't say i'd try it again though."
"Taste has a lot of bitter caramel malt up front, a touch of honey, and not a whole lot else. Hints of vanilla, caramel, and coffee are present, and the gesho blends into the malt/honey flavors. Feels very smooth and clean, not overly bitter. Quite drinkable for an RIS, though not the best that I have had."
"Grabbed this cause, really DFH can do no wrong in my eyes, especially when it comes to their big brews. Happy to have found it for $9.99, as well. This is really a big, delicious beer. Pitch black, engine oil type look, with a half a finger of tan head. Aromas are huge roasted malt, some smokiness, and a ton of chocolate, with the flavors likewise. Maybe a touch of that honey that's on the label got mixed in with the chocolate. Body is nice and thick. Overall, a really nice, tasty RIS, although maybe not a lot going on that's unique with this one. But sure as hell is tasty. Finished the bottle and wanted more..."
"You keep brewing 'em DFH, I'll keep drinking 'em."
"Definitely an interesting beer from DFH, as the unique ingredients are pretty detectable. I can see the mead and honey influences, which give the beer a pretty interesting flavor."
"Bitches Brew is very sweet, yet delicious, with notes of dark fruit and none of the metallic aftertaste many malty-sweet dark ales have. It's also too smooth and refreshing for an RIS, yet smooth and refreshing in an unexpected and good way. I was saving it for a cold day but broke down and had opened it up on a hot day. I'm glad I did."
"D: OK."
"Sweet up front, with some of that pre-advertised honey. A touch medicinal along with black licorice. Very smooth at the beginning. Nice herbal roastiness, sweet milk chocolate, bitter espresso. High drinkability."
"Drinkability is good. This is an enjoyable stout. I'm not sure if I would classify it as a RIS, but I guess it's probably too sweet to be a regular IS, so RIS fits. The ABV is mostly unnoticeable, which makes this an easy sipper. Not my favorite beer for the style, but still a good brew. I'm interested to see where a couple of years will take this brew. I'll probably crack the next one in the cellar in about 2 years. Another quality addition to the DFH lineup."
"Overall it's ok, but not delivering the malt bomb I have come to know RISs for. If you're looking for a lighter, more refreshing stout that still has dark character, this fits the bill."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and slightly sticky. Light carbonation."
"D: Very drinkable, which with these high ABV beers can be a little dangerous as we all know. Definitely worth the price I paid for it, which I think was around $13-15 for the bottle."
"D-Would be high if this weren't a one time brew. Gonna hold on to one and see if the bitterness fades out."
"Bold and smooth, just how Miles Davis would have had it if he brewed it himself."
"D: A Bomber or Two should be enough to please anyone. very nice beer"
"Drinkability- I polished off the entire bottle but I probably wouldn't drink more than one at a time. I don't want to compare the beer to the album because I personally don't see the comparison. All in all it's another solid (if flawed) entry in the Dogfish Head canon."
"I poured from a bomber into a snifter, the pour is midnight black with a thin little tan head. Lots of sweet cocoa on the nose, light alcohol rounds out the aroma. Chocolate, dark fruit and some sweetness(honey) up front. There is a definite alcohol burn with this in the lingering bitter finish. The beer is a full bodied sipper, and a solid RIS. Not sure what gesho root is or if it added any flavor. Definitely worth checking this one out."
"D: A good beer, but quite a sipper, the 750 lasted me well over 2 hours. Put on some Miles Davis and enjoy."
"drinks very well. alcohol is integrated very well and provides a bit of warming, but no harshness. not the best, nor most complex stout i have had, but close to it. I will definitely pick up a couple more of these before its all gone."
"750mL bomber with ""Bottled in 2010 F"" stamped on the neck. Pours a brackish deep brown, almost black. Very little head. Aroma is sweet. Hints of honey and coffee. The taste is more sweetness. Has some honey with a bit of a chocolate coffee taste. A bit lighter mouthfeel than I had expected. Overall its decent but I thought this would have a bigger taste to it, seeing as how it was a limited, one time brew. Good RIS, but I've had better."
"A strong sipper."
"Overall this wasn't the most flavorful beer in the world but it was still pretty damn good. This one had the intangibles but unfortunately missed the chance to hit it out of the ballpark with more robust flavors. Still, a solid beer that's well worth a shot."
"This is really well incorporated. One of the best I have had from Dog Fish Head. Unlike the notorious album, this has lots of nuance and complexity. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and oily with a fairly strong carbonation."
"Well you know I get excited about Russian Imperial Stouts, and the idea of one based on a jazz Great Like Miles Davis (Imperial Stouts seem to like doing that as I recall another one based on a Frank Zappa Album). This beer pours motor oiled color with almost no trace of a tan head which didnt hang around. It smells like burnt coffee and it tastes bitter sweet, with alot of complicated shades to the bitter such as berries, chocolate, coffees. It is very thick too and hot from the alcohol. Overall I think its pretty drinkable although being as strong as it is it might not be great to down too much of it"
"Lots of carbonation and a very light body. This one was pretty one dimensional with the honey. Its boring and just didn't have much flavor overall. I was looking forward to this one but ended up getting disappointed."
"Dogfish Head has done Miles Davis' legacy proud. Like a little cousin to DFH's Worldwide Stout, the flavor big but not overwhelming, and it's not quite as sweet or bubbly. But it's smoother and very tasty, and drinkable enough that if you split a 750ml, you'll be fighting for the bigger glass."
" The flavor was really good. The integration of flavors in this beer is exceptional. Everything is integrated perfectly. Really nice balance. Sweet but never too sweet. Very little grain or hop bitterness. Butter smooth. Little evidence of the alcohol. Sticky on the lips. Medium bodied. The drinkability is very high considering the style and abv. A really nice beer at a reasonable price. Well done DFH!"
"D - i would literally drink this all day its that good"
"D: very high for me even higher given the abv"
"UPDATE: I've since had another bottle and wonder what was in the first one I had. The second one showed much better head along with retention and lacing. The carbonation level was much better and the mouthfeel was thick, but not overly so. The cola flavor was still there but not n early as strong and may be a matter of tongue-memory from the last one. LOL The stout showed through more clearly with more assertive bitterness than I remembered and the honey supplied some nice balance with its earthy sweetness."
"D: I'm loving this beer. Dessert in a bottle. ABV is very well hidden. Maybe a little cloying but well put together with some great chocolate and herbaceous spicing."
"It's certainly a good example of the style. People expecting something off the wall may be disappointed. Otherwise, if you want another great example of a RIS, try this."
"I loved the fine carbonation and surprisingly light body. The slight syrupiness was well balanced by the bitterness and alcohol warmth. This was a big beer that was far too drinkable for it's strength, and I was both glad and sad to have only bought one bottle. Great job, and I hope I can find more before it's gone."
"D- very very drinkable watch out!"
"This beer is just what I have come to expect from Dogfish Head. A very creative brew and a solid offering. Definitely recommended."
"D: Very good and tasty, the mouthfeel is good, but this doesn't really impress me in the flavor category. Very nice, though it does not really stand out from a lot of other stouts, interesting yes. Amazing.. no."
"The brew pours a deep black with a small ring of foam. The nose has a faint smell of alcohol and a strong malt presence. The first sip delivers a strong taste of a roasted malty stout, which is followed by the higher alcohol sweetness of a mead. It has the bitterness of coffee, but balanced out by the sweetness of dark fruit and finishes smoothly. Great beer to get a taste of."
"All in all, my favorite beer from Dogfish. I am going to go out and pick up some more of these. Very nice."
"D--I am glad I grabbed a couple of bottles of this, I want to age this one and see how it develops. I recommend this one if you enjoy the RIS and edgy beers DFH is never afraid to brew!"
"D: It drank decent but was a bit too smokey for my liking when it comes to RIS's. Still a decent offering from DFH but it really didn't tickle my pickle."
"All in all, this is a decent brew. Not great, not bad, but decent. I wouldn't bother hunting it, but if you have access, it's a good one tim try."
"Drinkability -- Wow, quite good. Not the most interesting RIS, but it's incredibly drinkable. It goes down quite easily with just enough hop/roast bitterness to moderate the rich honey and chocolate notes. I can only assume as to whether or not I am detecting the gesho, but it's interesting. Might not knock your socks of, but is absolutely worth a shot."
"MF/D- Nice full body, which is most likely the best part of this beer. Drinkable in the sense that I can finish this, but won't seek out another. May be better with some age on this one, and I usually don't say that too often."
"Drinkability: If DFH was smart, they'd throw this recipe into some 12oz bottles, stick it in a 4 pack and make this their flagship stout. Alcohol is nicely hidden in this stout, the flavors blend perfectly in the taste, with the hint of honey really showing off some juice against the strong espresso/coffee flavors. Another home run for the DFH family, and a stout I will be seeking out again and again!"
"If I find more I will certainly pick some up though!"
"in the final analysis this is a fine take on the style, tasty and enjoyable, but in a style chalked full of fierce competitors, i guess i was just expecting more."
"Cheers!"
"D - Excellent sipping beer. Let it warm a bit to get all the flavors."
"Creamy and full-bodied, I am not used to something so bold from DFH being so drinkable so shortly after it is brewed. A very solid RIS, and I would look forward to having another glass or two of this in a couple years, to see how it ages."
"Tap at City Beer Store. Very good imperial stout. Fine looking impy stout with a black body, brown along the edges, and a thin light brown cap. The aroma has a lot of roasted malt with some honey and sweet caramel. It's more normal than I expected. Some chocolate and coffee notes in the malt. The flavor is rich and pretty big but not too overpowering. It's a bit sweet, not necessarily from the honey, but it works well and possibly speaks to cellaring potential. The flavor has an interesting herbal/earthy tone, presumably from the gesho. Some licorice and a fair bit of tobacco are also present. Mouthfeel is smooth and fairly thick. I thought this one was going to be an overhyped, sweet, crazy mess, but it's actually a quite good, relatively normal imperial stout."
"CHEERS!!"
"Notes - As a jazz trumpet player I've been looking forward to this ever since I first heard about it. It was absolutely worth the wait. Bravo to DFH for yet another stellar brew."
"Now this is a very fresh RIS and I am sure it will mellow but there is a little tinge on the back end of this and JUST before it goes flat that tastes a little to cherry for my liking. If this baby goes sour in 9 months, let me just say now I callled it."
" Overall, complex and full of character, yet more ""approachable"" than most Russian imperials in that it is a bit more drinkable and not as thick and boozy as some I've had. Nicely done, and certainly worth a try."
"a world class beer in IMO."
"D- Really interesting beer with some fun ingredients and a great inspiration; basically what I've come to expect from DFH, and again they haven't disappointed."
"Overall: This was a quite enjoyable beer, and not nearly as thick as it looked on pour. I'm going to try to grab a couple to stash away, as they should age well."
"D- I guess I was expecting something more over the top coming from DFH. I thought this one was pretty weak for the style. Not here to drink just think there are much better out there."
"Carbonation is maybe just a little sharp, does not weigh on me and is damn near sessionable."
"D-goes down very easy for the 9%ABV, its great til the last drop! taste never dies!"
"Drinkability: An enjoyable RIS from Dogfish. Picked up 4 bottles over the weekend, so I will definitely be having again."
"Actually, this is extremely drinkable for a 9% RIS. I'm not a DFH fanboy, and some of their stuff is, well, ehh. However, I was pleasantly surprised how flavorful and drinkable this beer is and will happily pick up another bottle, if I can."
"DB- A solid stout but it just isn't amazingly flavorful or outstanding at all to me. It drinks very well for 9% but the flavor is what matters most and it doesn't impress. Very laid back for DFH and not sweet either. Hard to compare the two exactly but the Espresso Yeti tasted after this just topped it in all ways."
"Drinkability: Not bad considering its a bit heavy."
"Very drinkable."
"Chocolate covered goldfish crackers, deep in black, dry waters. Refreshing bod, faint aroma of chalkboard. Cookies and cream up front, smokey cocoa in back; alcohol no where. One of the best Dogfish beers ever...yes. Creamy yet crispy, sweet and dry...contrasts create perfection. Number one RIS. Thats it."
"Pours opaque in color topped by coffee head that leaves some nice lacing. A sweet, slightly earthy subtle aroma of bitter chocolate, hops, charcoal, and some cigar ash. Tastes of tobacco, dark chocolate, bitter chocolate, hop bitterness towards the finish, burnt bread, slight sour coffee. Thick in body with light carbonation. A wild ash tray of an RIS."
"Top notch imperial stout, and maybe the most drinkable.  Given that Dogfish's other bottled imperial stout, and other beers tend to be on the extreme side of abv, the 9% abv was appreciated.  Had it on tap on release day and it was excellent as well! Will have to get a few more if I can!!"
"D - Super drinkable. Alc is REALLY well hidden. Fantastic brew. Was really surprised at how good this one was."
"Seek this beer out, it's very good and I'd say to Dogfish Head, don't make this a one time release. The album is pretty damn cool and I really thank Dogfish Head for introducing me to this, it's some great music for work. As far as music goes, I can't think of any other artist that pairs as well with Dogfish Head as Miles Davis."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer, but it does not differentiate itself from its style the way that many Dogfish Head beers do."
"Great beer, great musician. Listening and Miles and downing a DFH work of art. Doesn't get much better than this."
"D: Interestingly complex. Definitely a sipper."
"D: A really nice RIS. A nice ABV makes this a perfect beer for the fall or winter."
"This beer, paired with Miles Davis' album is an enveloping experience to be had."
"It finishes semi sweet with lingering spicy and chocolate malted milk ball, sweet, light spices still, a little nutty, a little honey as well, and some weird malt flavor that I can't really get, almost like a rye but not quite."
"D- this is a straight forward ris that show cases the malts beautifully. Very drinkable and enjoyable. One of the best for this brewery in my opinion, not to mention one of my favorite albums ever made, truly a work of art. Its awesome this was brewed in celebration of Miles. If peeing your pants is cool consider me miles davis."
"Pours a deep brown-chestnut with a nice tan head that leaves around a good amount of lacing. Smells very nice with some roasted malt, anise, good amount of sweetness, honey, and a touch of fruitiness. Taste is much the same, with the honey coming out a bit more. Mouthfeel is fairly full, although not entirely viscous. Great drinkability. A very unique brew, and I'll be picking up quite a few for the cellar."
"O - When I went in, I thought, ""well, I've heard about this, maybe I'll try a glass and then move on to some others."" Before I knew it I had finished my fourth, and could've had another few if time (and my poor, poor wallet) had allowed. This is absolutely the best beer I've ever had from DFH, and I hope they make more of it."
"D: Dangerously drinkable for a 9% beer that comes in 750 bottles. The blend of sweet vs sour with herbal notes is very tasty."
"Goes down smooth, but begs to be savored. Wonderful brew from DFH!"
"Looong finish. Not my favorite from them, but really interesting and I think this will be well received."
"Drinkability - Alcohol isn't there but the medicinal properties make it something that you may need to get used to. I'll stick with a bomber but would love to see how these flavors develop with age. Damn, time for another vertical...."
"750 ml bottle. Served in a DFH signature glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch brown head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice and sweet, it smells like chocolate, honey, roasted malt, and caramel. It tastes like mostly like bittersweet and milk chocolate, roasted malt and honey, with some licorice, smoke, coffee, and dark fruit also noticable. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's rich and creamy with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, I found myself finishing this bottle quicker than I thought I would. It's smooth and quite enjoyable. I think this is a pretty good overall brew, I'll have to get a couple more bottles of this soon!"
"Drinkability: this is a real slow drinking beer. Huge flavors and a unique flavor profile makes this an interesting beer to have."
"They had this on tap at Gaithersburg Dogfish Head. It was served in a snifter and had an almost black colour and a good head that was surprisingly long lasting. The smell was not impressive at all. When it first enters your mouth it's surprisingly neutral, but after a few seconds you notice some nice chocolate flavour that morphs into a bitter coffee aftertaste. I enjoyed it a lot; very interesting."
"The mouthfeel is on the thicker side with carbonation being low. Drinkability was decent, I enjoyed it overall. It was a very interesting imperial stout and different then the others out there. Cool and interesting beer, but nothing spectacular overall."
"D: Pretty underwhelming, I must say, and nowhere near as great as the Miles Davis album for which this was named."
"D- this is very very drinkable. You can put these down repeatidly and smoothly. Great job dfh!"
"It has been a while since I have anything from the folks at Dogfish Head. Thanks to the nice staff at Downtown Wine and Spirits for pulling this out of the back for me. Bitches Brew pours out a cool blackish color, with a finger of white heading. Chocolate and cola hit me first in the nose, followed soon after by spice (possibly the root used here?) and more of the cola. I get more of the same from the flavor, along with some licorice, and pepper. What really strikes me is how smooth and silky this beer is. The flavor profile is also extremely mild, with each taste working with the other pretty seamlessly. The ABV is right where it should be with this one; drinkable but with not enough alcohol to completely knock you out. Overall one of the better beers I have had from DFH in a while. They should make this year round. Also, I plan on holding on to the bottle for the cool artwork. Cheers"
"I had the test batch for this (Voodoo Down) at the brewpub and it wasn't as sweet. This is really good, and I'm sure it would age quite well."
"D- this goes down extremely easy. I will have no problem killing a bottle by myself."
"D - Goes down quick, so it's damn good! Not the best RIS I've had, but a really nice brew from DFH, who didn't seem to have a mainstream RIS until now, props!"
"D: A very good beer, very much like the typical RIS but has something a little different. A nice taste and no sign of it being 9%, dangerous as always. Bought two bottles, 1 will be aged. Dogfish has been hyping this beer and it was just as I suspected....delicious."
"Bitches Brew, a good Miles Davis album, but far from his best. On the other hand, this might be the best Dogfish Head beer I've tried. Black and opaque in appearance with a dark brown collar on top. Black licorice and dark chocolate aroma, sharply roasted and bordering on tarry. Very balanced palate, semi-charred malt hits the tongue for a brief moment, but it becomes sweet and honey-like in the mid-palate. Black licorice, peppery spice, full in body with a mildly bitter and chocolatey finish. Pretty damn good, nice job DFH."
"One would not be diapointed in trying. A must try and well done by DFH !!"
"The drinkability was really good, I enjoyed it in my small ass snifter. Went well with a cheeseburger. With that said a bottle would be a chore but would go great at tastings etc. Very true to style with a slight DFH twist, Back to basics."
"Attention Dogfish Head: Just because this beer is out to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Miles Davis' album doesn't mean you should just abandon it now that you've brewed it. It's the perfect imperial stout to have in your lineup and you'd be denying everyone of a lot of beer enjoyment if you give up on it now. One of the best stouts in the world - an instant classic."
"Beer is medium bodied and has no carbonation in the mouth. It tastes good, I guess there's some honey coming through in there but I don't get the other ingredients. I suppose it would help if I had heard of any of them but I suppose that's the charm of DFH, here's a beer that tastes like a food you've never had because it a moss that only grows on the south side of tree bark in the arctic circle. Drinkability is good, very smooth beer. I'd have it again if it were less than a $1 / ounce, otherwise I could do without."
"I think the fermented honey made this beer very special and provided a different flavor profile that allowed the roasted character to come out while allowing other flavors to join in the party."
"D: Really enjoyed this beer. Very easy drinking stout. I had no problems finishing the bottle myself. Didn't get much honey or spice (from the gesho root) with had intrigued me when I first read about it. Worth grabbing if you see it"
"Drinkability is OK. This is a bit unique beer like DFH is known for. Not sure I will buy this one again. It is OK but I can get Stone RIS for half the price."
"taste is smooth and creamy, some sour malt, milk chocolate, some dark chocolate, licorice, some coffee, roasted nuts, and some dark fruit, ends smooth and slightly bitter."
"D - This would be a very good stout if it wasn't so alcoholic in its taste but right now thats just killing this beer for me maybe after two years or so this will be good"
"The appearance was a very dark brown, almost looking like oil in the glass since there was nearly no head present other than a small film. The smell was very nice. Very sweet touching on caramels, chocolate, honey and a smokiness. Taste included a dark cocoa malt with a good amount of honey mixed in. It is full bodied with a creamy feel and a smoky finish hiding the alcohol very well. I feel that it got a much nicer as it got closer to room temperature as it completely removed the small bitterness present while chilled."
"this beer pours black with a brown head and it smells great mostly of a chocolate with a hint of honey and brown sugar. at first there's a mild metallic taste to the beer but as it warms up it completely disappears it tastes similar to a chocolate stout but with a well balanced honey finish, very malty but well balanced in the hops as well. theres no afterbite which makes this beer phenomenal. i wish i had the patience to age this because man could've been my favorite beer but i was impatient. i dont know how many of these i could drink but this beer is awesome i wish it wasn't only being brewed once."
"Overall, a truly great beer. Hell, good enough for my lazy butt to take the time to review it. Way to go DFH!"
"This was a very tasty beer, drank at cellar temperature, poured for about 5 or 6 people and all loved it. Silky mouthfeel, chocolate and honey sweetness, perfectly balanced bitter cocoa/cacao, coffee. No thin beer here, exceptionally full bodied, balanced with lightness on the palate. A beer that tantalizes the senses. Thank you Dogfish and Matts."
"This is a really impressive beer with an interesting sweetness that balances out the imperial stout characteristics. Very good stuff."
"I would, and have, aquired more bottles of this."
"Edit: This beer improves tenfold as it warms."
"The flavor profile was dark chocolate and malt heavy which then eased into a nice balance of sweetness from the honey and slight hop bitterness. At the end, however, was this unsatisfying dryness that coated my tongue and roof of my mouth. I'm guessing that it was from the root? Not sure, but it wasn't working for me. The brew overall was quite sweet tasting; I would've liked a bit more complexity. Mouthfeel was typically silky and smooth, but left that cotton-mouthed dryness at the end. Drinkability was fairly quick, as me and a couple friends were breezing through our glasses. Easily a drinkable beer and worth a try of this eccentric brew."
"Ahh the big beer-drinkability paradigm, all I can say is that it is what it is. For a 9% sweet Russian Imperial Stout this is extremely easy to drink, but others might say that it was quite a chore so who knows. As far as my opinions on this beer, I loved it and ever more so as it warmed up a little bit which really helps some of the subtle nuances shine though on this complex beer. Sam and Dogfish Head have done it again creating a excellent beer with non-traditional ingredients while keeping the flavor and style in tact. I would say if you get a chance to try this beer go for it because this will be a limited release that you sure don't want to miss."
"Impression: Quite a delicious stout, one I'm certain to revisit, though I doubt it's a candidate for the cellar (worth a try though)."
"Large capped bottle from DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY. Bottled in 2010 etched onto the glass. Pours black, very dark mocha head, dense, staying, sheeting, lacing, quality look to this one. Earthy, more mocha, lightly herbal in the nose. This is a super smooth and easy drinking RIS, showing NO signs of 9%. Notes of dark chocolate, cafe au lait, and stouty goodness. Love the smooth mouthfeel here. High quality and highly tasty. Nice night capper or with a rich dessert."
