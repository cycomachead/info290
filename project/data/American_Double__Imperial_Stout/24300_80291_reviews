"O: An amazing beer. I have tried this beer out on people who profess to hate stouts and they love it."
""
""
"I don't like coffee to dominate the flavor of my beers and this is probably the best representation of coffee I've ever tasted.  Velvety smooth chocolate with a little bit of back-end coffee bitterness that feels authentic. I didn't really taste any almonds though. I bought one to age but it's so perfectly balanced I don't think there's any sense in letting it sit. I hope I can get my hands on the bourbon barrel aged version soon."
""
"Bottle.  Started at 57 degrees.  Label said ""Best before 2015"".  What's that about?  A cheap shot at Deschutes?  Anyways, this does pour very black and exciting.  Aroma is sweet, maybe some oak but don't think is barrel aged?  Maybe it's the cookie.  As it warmed in the glass I got a sweet molasses-like smell, very nice.  First flavor impression is bitterness; it gives way to smooth flavor, but that bitterness is always there with each drink from start to finish.  I did not get distinct coffee or chocolate, but rather roasted malt and some kind of welcomed melded sweetness.  Sorry, my palate just can't pick out 7 kinds of distinct fruits and grains like some of our more insightful members!  Mouthfeel was nice medium, but I wish a little creamier, say more like Founders Breakfast Stout or Goose Island Bourbon County or Prairie Bomb!  Overall a very well crafted stout, but that front end bitterness is a bit of an issue for me."

"This beer is good but I feel it's overrated heard great things and was disappointed"
"O - 4.25 - One of the better imperial stouts that I have had in a long time."
""
""
""
""
"Pitch black, aromatic, and thick as tar. Lots of chocolate and coffee, but bitterness is a bit intense (drank fresh, not aged). A bit too viscous, busy, and overwhelming for my taste. All of these are nice in combination, but whole is somehow less than the parts here."
""
""
""
"Having this brew at about cellar temp. Appearance is a huge, thick, foamy tan head that slowly subsides, lots of lace, and an opaque black brown color. Aroma is mild - malt, cocoa, toffee, biscuit, yeast, coffee. Flavor's like nose plus slightly sweet tart up front with bitter coming next and finishing with a dynamic mix of the three. No off characteristics at all. Everything is very smooth and balanced. Later more sweetness comes out. Aesthetics are key here. Beautiful body. I want so much more."

"Nice chocolate notes as it warms up.  Definitely my favorite imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I thought this was overrated. Not bad but nothing special."
""
""
""
""
"O: delicoius"
""
""
"Ink black with thick chocolate colored head.  Coffee and chocolate prevalent in the aroma, with some grape juice sweetness hidden behind it.  Strong taste of chocolate up front, a lot of vanilla and some roasted malts in the middle and little acidic coffee and hop bitterness on the back end.  Creamy mouthfeel.  That chocolate and vanilla combo is something else,  but overall not something I'd come back to often."
""
""
""
"I'm going to drink more of this than I need to just to finish it. It's a dirty job and it's just my lot in life (lucky SOB)."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty decent wasnt thrilled about it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very subtle vanilla and creamy sort of chocolate finish.  Not much of a head and also disappears fast.a little thin bodied to me with  Mild smooth finish for 11.5% abv. Overall not bad"
""
""
"A wonderful way to end the evening, as the ABV makes this one a treat to linger over."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful color and head. Feels so smooth going doing. Taste is divine. Am going back to the store and grabbing more."
""
""
"Deep dark brown with a pastry-like sweetness on the nose. There is a trace of coffee in the flavor profile but the roasted malts are not particularly strong."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 22 oz bomber.  Brown and opaque with no head.  Smells like vanilla, oak, sugar, coffee, and fig.  Taste is sweet alcohol with a very complex mix of flavors.  Am picking up coffee, moss, bread, hops, fruit, and maybe some smoke.  Mouth full is dense with little to no carbonation.  Finish is very smooth.  Overall an exceptional beer which opens up as it warms."
"Brought this beer back from a trip in December and had it last night watching SNL 40th. It sure made the evening enjoyable having such a smooth taste, with a subtle coffee taste and aroma. The 11.5% was an added benefit and we smiled both from the beer and the show. A great beer for relaxing in front of the tube with your gal. Dee-lish-ous!"

"Too artificial tasting....like an unnatural weird mall coffee drink. Full bodied, oily, with an unpleasant aftertaste...again, artificial tasting. Just didn't get this."
"This is a special beer. Can't even taste the alcohol. Delicious."
""
""
""
"I had high hopes for this and it exceeded  them in the end. Beautiful dark chocolate brown color with coppery head. Sweet, but not overpowering, and smooth, you'd never guess the high abv from taste. Excellent offering from evil twin that I hope to have more of."
"O - A fantastic imperial stout. The flavors are very bold and strong. Outstanding."

"Tastes like coffee. Full, rich espresso flavor. Delicious!"
""
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed this stout.  Right from smell (almost had a BA smell to it) and flavor was excellent.  Super smooth great aftertaste highly recommend trying."
""
""
""
"Overall:  Damn!  This is a damn great, no awesome, imperial stout!  Extremely strong flavors of toasted malt, coffee, vanilla, caramel and dark chocolate.  Fantastic!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste - Very smooth at first with a nice mellow coffee flavor.  A bit of a bitter bite in the aftertaste, but the chocolate, coffee, and vanilla mix is so good!  Love it.  Feel is very nice - rich and creamy.  Overall, this is a splendid offering.  I will seek more!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this isn't a bad brew.  I just don't understand why it's received by others as ""world-class"".  I love my stouts, just not this one.  To each his own."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Sexy black.  Smells like dessert.  Tastes like chocolate and expresso, with a kick.  Great mouthfeel.  Might be my new favorite non-barrel aged stout.  Now I need to find the BA variety."

"Biscotti Break is everything an Imperial Stout should be."

""
""
""
""
"There was a putrid aftertaste that ruined what would have been an exceptional beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.0), this is a beer that I came into with pretty high expectations, but in spite of it being a very good beer, it just didn't meet those expectations. Perhaps that's not fair to the beer, but there are just so many other coffee-infused imperial stouts that I'd buy before this one--especially at the price point."

""
""
""
"Pour is jet black with a tight dark mahogany head.  Nose is rich, dark roasted malts with chocolate cake batter, anise, cooked brown sugar, and a bit of residual sugar.  Taste is also big, not overly sugary for the richness.  Deeply roasted dark malts with rich cake batter and brown sugar.  Full bodied, light bitterness lingers through a softly carbonated finish."

"O- This was given to me over the summer as a gift for my 30th birthday. I held on to it and got a sudden craving for something like this on this cool snowy late fall night. The night before Thanksgiving. Like I said, the coffee taste came through on the finish and really started creeping and staying on the palette the more I drank it. I had the whole 22 oz. bottle but would have been much more satisfied with just an 8 oz. pour. The first few sips were actually very pleasant. I rated this a bit higher as it was very good, minus the coffee...I guess I was hoping for something different but really, that coffee taste was inevitable... it was brewed with it!"

"Wave after wave of coffee and chocolate spank the taste buds. A bit rich from the go, 'taste' and 'ABV' take a strong leading role. A bit boozy and hot. Other wise milk chocolate and mocha really shine. Smooth stout notes. Considering its a whopping 11.5... This is an awesome gem to land~"

"Beer is nothing short of delicious. Dark pour into a snifter, one finger head. Creamy, deep with chocolate, gingerbread and coffee. Puts glazed doughnut to shame. So delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""

"overall a nice mouth feel, but I missed the biscotti flavor.  A bit on the boozey side, but I guess that's expected for 11.5%"

"Draft. Pours a very dark pretty much opaque color. Dark toffe colored head, subsided after a couple minutes with a thin layer remaining. Looks tasty. Aromas of roasty caramel, chocolate, and hints of vanilla. Roasted heavy malts smell as well. I taste a boozy, roasted dark chocolate at the front, hints of vanilla and coffee are in there too. Overall, it tastes just like what i would think dunking a biscotti stick in coffe would taste like.  Malty and caramel slight hints as well. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous. Its fairly boozy. Mice smooth finish with a good lingering taste that's not too overpowering."

"O: A very solid imperial stout. Great flavors, not overpowering, boozing, or cloying, with a nice heavy body. Carbonation could have been a touch chewier, but it really doesn’t hurt the drinkability in the end."

"Overall - Easily one of the best stouts I have had. Alcohol is well hidden, not too heavy, wonderful blend of flavors. If you like FBS, this is a must try. Just a hair lighter on the coffee front, but in the same class. ""World class"""

"Deep space dark, dark chocolate brownie smell and biscotti taste. I actually looked for biscotti in the beer. Awesome amazing beer."
""
""
"O: Unimpressed. Chocolate is the concept, but there are no details, nuances, or worthwhile deviations from it. By no means a bad beer, there is nothing off-putting (at least for a little while, before the flavors start beating you over the head), but it isn't compelling to return to it."

"Main smell is woody with a bit of coffee roast. Later it opens up a bit to include a sweet chocolate liquor. Surprisingly thin compared to what I was expecting from a big Imperial Stout. First taste is that woody note from the aroma, a little green. Flavors that come after are more typical of an imperial stout, ending with a sort of char and chocolate aftertaste, though the midpalate on the way there is curiously empty and clean. If there is supposed to be any of the namesake biscotti flavour in this, I'm not getting any of it at all. No baked goods or bready toasty anything at all, no almond anything. I had heard this was a real standout stout so this is very surprising and disappointing. If I had never heard anything about it at all I would say it is an OK imperial with a bit of odd green wood flavor."

"Bottle from Maltitude. Pours dark black with tan head that quickly disappears. Aroma of roasted coffee and caramel. Tastes of espresso, caramel and booze. As a slow boozy burn that lingers on my throat and tongue after each sip. Delicious"

"Pours to a dark rich chocolate.color with a full finger of head.  Draft.  Hints of chocolate, brown sugar and cream.  Traditional imperial stout.  very smooth and light in the mouth.  After tastes of sugar, maybe cinnamon.  Easy to consume.  No burn of course."

"O- one of my favorite nonBA imp stouts. Would put this right up there with tenfidy. Not much of a coffee stout fan, at least so far--lagunitas cappuccino was mediocre at best and big bad baptist is too overpowering w the coffee. But this does it just subtle enough-almost would like more coffee! Excellent beer; made me happy after a 10.5 hour workday on a Friday"

"A beautiful, pitch black beer with a frothy tan head. Smell is mild with strong hints of coffee and slight hints of chocolate and cocoa. The taste is pretty similar with the coffee even more prominent but not overwhelming To me, many coffee stouts have too much coffee and not enough beer, but this is among the most balanced I've had. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, though a bit thinner than many imperials. Oddly, I enjoyed this beer more when it was really cold and felt it didn't improve with warming."
""

""

"Overall: Pretty shocked. Not expecting much thinking this was gonna be another marked up international offering that would rival a stone ris. Not the case here. Going back for more prob not to age though. One of those rare stouts I can't see barrel aging benefiting."

"Poured from bottle directly into torst wine glass. Pours opaque deep cocoa black with a two finger fluffy caramel head. Head dissipates quickly..nose is sweet dark cocoa, caramelly mocha and overall sweetness. Taste follows the nose...starting with a definitive chocolate foreground that develops effortlessly into big chocolate, booze, cream, and light smokiness. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy like a milkshake..overall another win for evil twin stouts."

"Delicious!  The chocolate notes rule the aftertaste.  Never bitter, so smooth, easy drink. Had this after the Prairie Bomb! (which was amazing), and I have to say this was a much smoother drink.  The aroma alone sends that message.  I started slow, expecting a bitter finish like many other coffee stouts, but this just stayed sweet and smokey.  Definitely getting this one again."

"Pours a dark beer. Has no carbonation forming. Aroma is of chocolate, fortified wine. Taste is very complex. Has vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and some yeasty element that makes it taste like a biscotti. It is not a bitter beer, it is a bit sour. Borderline heady. Mouth feel is syrupy."

"(Cannot wait to try this barrel-aged. I honestly can't fathom how amazing that beer will be...it may let me down in a way as I've built this beer itself up so high)"

"Poured a black body with one finger light brown head that left a little bit of lace ring. Mostly a roasted and coffee malt aroma along with dark chocolate. Smooth and light which is how I prefer my stouts. Plenty of roast and coffee to go around but well-balanced from some sweet dark chocolate (not really any vanilla) and possibly some nuts. Probably a little more sweet than roasted/coffeeish so it hit my sweet tongue."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, best before 2015. Pours dense pitch black color with a 2 finger dense dark brown head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, fudge, espresso beans, roasted malt, dark bread, caramel, vanilla, light nuttiness, and roasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and vanilla notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, espresso beans, roasted malt, fudge, toast, dark bread, caramel, vanilla, light nuttiness, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roast/coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, espresso, roast, fudge, toast, dark bread, caramel, vanilla, light nuttiness, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and vanilla flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, smooth, moderately slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding imperial coffee stout. All around awesome complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and vanilla flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Outstanding stout with robust flavors, minor hop accents for balance that hid the alcohol, sweet flavors that were rich but not overdone and great dessert qualities that made every sip a little different, but all 22 ounces extremely enjoyable. An excellent stout and a beer that I highly recommend and will buy more of very soon. I suggest treating yourself to this beer as it will provide a great buzz to go along with the great flavor. Well done Evil Twin."

"O: This was kind of a let down for me, I was expecting more biscotti taste but this seemed to taste just like other sweet imperial stouts. For the price, I will not buy this again."

"O: I did not expect this beer to smells so sweet or taste quite as bitter as it is (not that it's all that bitter, it's about as bitter as coffee), and the addition of coffee probably cuts what would probably be too much sweetness. I'd definitely recommend this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Got the beer at a considerable discount and I am happy about that. I was hoping for a lot more coffee. More of a sweet chocolate stout that turns out to be slightly disappointing."

"Great appearence after the first pour. Looks like a great imperial stout. Smell was incredible out of the bottle, but has changed slightly as it warms up. Lots of chocolate bar flavor in the taste, but there is something I just can't put my finger on. Almost like some sort of salty taste - like a soy sauce soaked oyster. Still tastes very good, but not as good as I was expecting."

"Atmosphere is really nice. Dark and intimidating, not real head or lacing. Roasted coffee, dark chocolate are really prominent in the nose, and a bit of booze. Dark chocolate is a big part of the flavor profile as well, some bitter roasted espresso beans, and savory sweet earthy fruit. Overall, this is a great quaff."

"Incredibly good beer. $18 for a 22oz bottle is definitely a pretty hefty price, but it's also one hell of a hefty brew. A fantastic biscotti/dough/coffee/sweet nose that tastes almost just as good. A big beer that's well worth trying. One of the best beers I've ever had, for sure. A bit on the sweeter side, but that's to be expected from this beer, I think... but that's just a nitpick. BUY THIS BEER."

"O: Worth all the hype. A great after dinner drink to share with friends. Terrific with a brownie."
""
""
"I'm fairly certain that this is my new favorite dessert beer, and even though it took a few days to finish, it was definitely a welcome rich offering to turn to after dinner, and pair with some dark chocolate to help cut some of the sweetness. Somehow, all of the factors come together without ever becoming too sweet. This makes this a very drinkable offering of its kind, and I'd definitely be happy to revisit this again when the time is right."

"Drinkability: As someone who's brewed nut beers before, I know it's hard to do (pulverize, slurry, separate, rinse, repeat six times). I know it messes with your head retention, and makes your mouthfeel slippery and eel-like. But--given how those additions make a beer taste--a brew that had those flavor/aroma components and had great retention and a perfect mouthfeel would be a contender for most badass brew of all time. Particularly impressive at 11.5% with no hint of alcohol in the mouth or nose until this one comes dangerously close to room temperature."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Absolutely delicious, goes down smooth and has amazing flavor and aroma."
""

"Poured into a Reuben's Brew snifter. Pours pitch black, totally opaque in the glass with a thin dark brown head with light lacing. Aroma of sweet toasted malt, quality coffee and sweet cookie dough notes. Flavor is dense sweet dark malt, coffee, vanilla and a bit of cookie dough, very well melded into a rich coffee chocolate flavor. A nice hop bitterness with mild char in the finish. Great creamy body. More like a liqueur enhanced chocolate coffee shake than a beer, slightly on the sweet side, but flavorful enough that it was not a detractor. Dangerously drinkable. The high ABV was totally covered and this invited repeated tastes requiring pacing. A classic."

Lots of sweet milky and caramel flavors here, working well with the roasted and bitter coffee flavors. Thanks again Claaark13. Recommended."

"When I bought this it was a whale, but then the variants came out so who even cares about this anymore? As I first stuck my nose towards the avery snifter that held this diabetes bomb, huge whiffs of brownie batter and fudge punched me in the face. It's pretty decadent and certainly one of the better Evil Twin beers I've had - gooey chocolate fudge, a little dose of smoke, medium rare brownie, sugar. I killed the last 6oz with a hearty scoop of snoqualmie french vanilla."

"D: This was a great stout, with delicious scent and taste, and fantastic body. The finish was really smooth with incredibly well hidden alcohol. So it was too easy to drink, given the ABV. No need to age, this brew is good to go fresh. For a non-barrel aged stout, this is top tier. Recommended."

"Pours pitch black with a small dark brown head. No lacing. Complex aroma, redolent of chocolate, dark fruits, vanilla, coffee. Sweetness initially on the palate, but not cloyingly so. Loads of chocolate up front that gives way to dark fruit with hints of coffee. Finishes dry. Full bodied with very little carbonation. Overall, an outstanding Imperial Stout that is best served with dessert."
""
""
"Rich flavor with great mouth feel. Just a little carbonation. Some chocolate flavor (but not excessive), coffee overtone, and just the right amount of alcohol heat. Competes with Yeti Espresso Aged Stout as my personal favorite, with Evil Twin having the lead. Will certainly reach for it when it's available. Overall, this one is hard to beat. Highly recommended."

"Big thanks to bcolton for sharing this. I've been wanting to try this beer for quite a while. Pours an inky black with no head. Nose expresses dark cocoa, a bit of char and perhaps coffee and hazelnuts. Taste consistent with nose - the flavor profile is very much reminiscent of a confection. The coffee presence and hazelnuts are much more intensified here. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a pleasant, even carbonation and a slight chalkiness to the texture. Overall, an excellent American Double Imperial Stout that just falls a little short in the mouthfeel department."
""
""
""
"Another brew I've been looking forwards to and pours a dark black hue with a creamy three finger chocolate laced head and lacing everywhere,the smell is strong mocha with biscuity malts and also strong Milo,the mouthfeel is full bodied and lightly carbonated which massively suits and the taste is strong dark chocolate mixed with Milo and strong expresso and overall it's a very nice dessert drop and I could drink alot of and would buy again cheers."

"O: great brew, world class, boozy as it warms up, +4 stars"
"Overall - This brew is amazing, the cherry one was perfect but not everyone would agree, some wanted it sweeter. This one is a little hotter but still I would 100% recommend this brew and Evil Twin in general, I'm liking their thinking so far!"
"Overall (4.75): This is one of those epic stouts that has to had to be believed. It packs tons of chocolate and coffee goodness with unique almond/vanilla biscotti bar undertones. It isn't the most aggressive stout; nor is it the most coffee-forward stout. But it might be the most well-balanced sweet stout I've ever had. A great stout that I think cracks my top 5–behind Founders KBS and Mikkeller Beer Geek Brunch Weasel, but ahead of Founders Breakfast Stout and Southern Tier Creme Brulee. Great stuff. See it, buy it. It's worth the $15-plus you'll likely have to pay for a 22 ounce bottle."
""
"O: Excellent stuff. This beer is right in my wheelhouse. Big, bold, and complex. Seamless integration of complementary flavors. Supremely easy to drink for a beer of its size. Do not hesitate to snag a bottle should it cross your path."
""
""
""
""
"Don't think aging will do too much for this one."
""
"Full bodied and viscous with deeply roasted coffee bean and dark malt flavor.  Dry and pretty bitter but never acrid or harsh wih lots of lactose and silky chocolate malt sweetness countering the roast.  Excellent espresso bean flavor along with burnt toast, oatmeal and dark cacoa powder.  Lactic cream toward the finish smoothing things out along with silky chocolate, fudge, bakers chocolate, toffee and caramel.  Very complex and I can even pick up hints of licorice, English biscuit and dark fruit as it warms.  Decent heat but the ABV is well masked making this beer very easy to drink.   There's a really great  balance of roasted coffee and sweeter dessert-like notes which also help drinkability.  Another impressive beer from Evil Twin."
""

""
""
""
""
"Evil Twin is on to something with new cutting edge stouts, and I can't wait to try the cherry Natale version now that I have a baseline for the original recipe."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really great for my first foray into EvilTwin beers. The taste is as advertised and the 11.5% ABV is nothing to scoff at. Goes down smooth, predominantly like a dessert with a slight alcohol finish leaving you wanting another sip immediately. Highly Recommended."
""
""
""
"A really good take on the style, no one is gonna confuse this with cheap, but one of the few from these guys that's worth the price. Not great in the aesthetics, but damn tasty. I will buy this again"

"O-This is a great beer, but the biggest weakness is the taste!?! It is really nice look, smells pretty good, and feels wonderful, but I could not help but wonder if I was missing something on my palate. The booze was always in the background, which gave a nice bit of balance, but I could have used a little more intrigue to put this thing in big leagues of this style. Anyway, it would make a wonderful dessert beer with the big sweetness, thick feel, and balanced (rather than insanely bitter) coffee flavors."

"Overall: this is a fantastic stout. I am hoping to find more at the store because it was that enjoyable!!! I wish it had just a little more coffee prensent in the flavor and aroma."
""
"O - Really good beer. A little boozy and strange mouthfeel hold it back from being great, especially for the high price."
""
"Pours black with a mocha head. Aroma is waaay too alcoholic; strong alcoholic fumes on top of some caramel, wafers, milk chocolate, nutty and a little roasty coffee. Alcohol shows up in the flavor way too strongly along with some caramel, nutty, wafers, chocolate, and a little coffee. Cloyingly sweet and and alcoholic. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy and dead flat. Overall, drain poured my 8 ounces of this, gave the rest of the bomber to my roommate. This one is not for me, won't drink again."

"Very enjoyable dessert stout. Its aroma is its best asset. I wish it had a bit more resemblance to the flavor of a biscotti cookie, but I'm not positive that was the intended goal by the brewer. If you like big sweet stouts, definitely check this out."

"Basically all of the variants of Imperial Biscotti Break are better than this original version, because using the additional adjuncts or barrel-aging it tempers some of the sweetness. However, the flavors here are incredibly well-done, and it's very tasty in small amounts."
"- Overall a very tasty and balanced imperial stout. Not as complex as other RIS offerings (parabola, abyss, KBS, etc.), but a fun alternative. At $14/bottle, the price is about right, but I won't be rushing out to get more considering the other RIS coming soon. If Evil Twin did a Bourbon BA version of this, it could be amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm pleasantly impressed with this beer. I was a bit apprehensive because people had compared it to Southern Tier's Creme Brulee, which I found to be far too sweet. But my fears were for naught, as this beer is much more balanced."

"Overall this is a solid beer. I enjoy most offerings from Evil Twin despite the sometimes exuberant pricing. Even More Jesus, another imperial offering from Evil Twin, is quite nice, and there is a coffee version available. Given the success of Biscotti Break, I might seek it out. Regardless, give this a shot, give it two shots, it's good. You'll like it, you might even love it. Recommended food pairings: red velvet cake, dark chocolate, or anything that goes well with coffee really. Me? I'll be enjoying the other half of this bomber after dinner, alongside some premium dark hand rolling tobacco. Cheers."
"What a great extra, wanted to try this for a while, a fantastic coffee forward imperial stout, the wife like this as well, much appreciated!"
""
""
"Strong yet smooth, with an incredible viscosity that lingers for hours on end. Each sip is a treat! The beer’s flavor is more than the sum of its parts but they’re all there—dark chocolate, coffee/espresso, vanilla, caramel, leather, almond liquor… Decadent and delicious."
"Poured into my Lost Abbey tulip glass. Pours motor oil black, with a one inch mocha head, that leaves behind beautiful lace, and settles very slowly into a layer of foam, amazing. Smell is roasted expresso, vanilla, caramel, toffee, and twix candy bar. Taste even better than the nose. Its a combination of every thing in the nose, but nothing dominated, an amazing dessert beer. Body is chewy as hell, perfect carbonation, not overly dry, and hard to sip, no alcohol present in the taste and at 11 5% incredible. This is sublime! Wouldn't change anything. The best body ever for the style."
""
"A rather pleasantly innocuous imperial stout, with slight Italian dessert qualities, everything kind of muddled, but in a very engaging manner. The coffee just adds to the Etruscan essence, while the alcohol does a hell of a job of keeping its head down, that point can't be stressed enough. Not a drinker, more of a slow sipper, but without any barrel or overt booze astringency, I can see how the former might seem foolishly appealing here."
"O: A very nice imperial stout that nicely incorporates both the coffee and vanilla. It is quite complex, especially at room temperature. I'd love to see a BA version of this"
""
""
"Overall: Definitely a balanced beer. It's not too sweet, though I wouldn't mind it being a bit sweeter(hey, I like Dark Lord...). I think this would benefit from a year or two to let the bitterness die down, but it's still drinking good now. This actually reminds me of pt5, though not as sweet. Not bad at all."

"Oh yes. Got lucky and stumbled across this in NYC. Great texture and feel. Quite smooth. Flavor is great. Great level of malts. Superb tone of coffee. Balance really works. Carbonation is smooth.

Certainly, it's an excellent coffee brew, but I'm not sure it's worth its exorbitant price. Even if this were just $10/bottle, I would consume this like water. I'd still buy it again at $18 a bottle, though."

"Overall: Really a delicious beer, a massive amount of flavor built on the almond, vanilla, & chocolate troika. As I mentioned on the sweeter side but extraordinarily delicious."
""
"Pours jet black with a smallish tan head that had to be coaxed out and dissipated rather quickly. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, coffee, chocolate, almonds, brown bread, light pitted fruit, toffee, molasses, and a touch of alcohol. Really great nose on this one! The flavor is diabetes inducing sweetness. Lots of smokey syrupy molasses caramel and brown sugar up front. The coffee cuts through the sweetness as does the tart fruitiness and a touch of alcohol. Thick body with a minimal amount of carbonation and a sweet sticky syrupy mouthfeel. This is a huge sweet sticky beer, but it really does work for me. The nose is incredible here and Id love if we could shave about 10 points of gravity."

"Had this beer on tap at Map Room in Chicago, reviewing from tasting notes. It is a nice dark huge, poured with minimal head, only rimming of lacing. Smells great, coffee notes and big, and it boasts a toasty, roasty flavor like a Biscotti would. The flavor is along with the nose but is a little overpoweringly sweet. Good mouthfeel. Very easy to drink, glad I have a couple more bottles of this!"

"Draught @ Cambridge House: This one pours an opaque, very dark brow color. It has about a finger of a light brown head on it. Suprisingly almost no lacing. The nose is good. Some coffee notes on top. Roasted malts, smokiness and chocolate round out the aroma. The taste is excellent. Coffee, some smokiness, toffee, rich chocolate, hints of dark fruits. Somewhat dry and no real sweetness to it. Extremely nice."

"Bottle: Poured a deep black color porter with a medium size dirty brown color head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of chocolate malt notes with some light caramel with some vanilla and Italian cookie notes. Taste is also dominated by chocolate malt notes with some vanilla and Italian biscuit notes with light dry roasted malt notes. Body is quite full with light creamy texture and good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Very impressive amount of complexity while retaining a good level of drinkability."
"Truly one of those savored experiences. Biscotti is a surprisingly and dangerously easy drinking dessert beer good for watching people and sipping slowly."

"A big but ultimately balanced big ass beer. I dig the marshmallow almond thing. Solid."
"This is a treat. It's not the best beer I've ever had, but it is quite a top tier coffee stout. Or imperial stout. Or whatever the hell you want to label it. It's very interesting and very tasty. I hate to say it, but it's almost worth the high price point!"

"Overall (4.25): This is a very enjoyable imperial stout, executed well with a lot of character. It’s not so much different from a lot of other excellent examples of the style, but it hits every note with confidence and character. Definitely improves as it warms. Recommended! Apparently Evil Twin does imperial stouts well."

"Rich and smoothe, this is a beer that is really enjoyable to drink. It doesn't differentiate itself enormously from other high quality Imperial Stouts, but that's not ultimately a terrible thing. It doesn't break new ground, but the ground it treads it treads very well. Certainly recommended."

" The taste is great with flavor of vanilla and cocoa with slight hint of nutty roast with lightly spiced aspect and sweet element with slightly raisin element in the background with a full dry toast almost biscuit taste as it finishes. Overall this is a great stout -the inspiration is felt in the taste I really think this beer achieves what is sets out to do with vanilla biscuit and the base stout all coming together to make an above average stout...one of the best Evil twin beers I have had without much alcohol apparent in the taste which exceeds expectations"
"This is fantastic stuff. It marriages bitter and sweet so that neither dominate and make this hard to drink and it goes down super smooth for such a high ABV. Worth trying for sure!"

""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very interesting beer. The coffee flavor, while pleasant, drowns out a lot of the other flavors, but some chocolate, malts, and vanilla manage to get through. Definitely a solid coffee-dominant imperial stout. It looks amazing and the mouth-feel is great. If you're into coffee dominant stouts, this one is a must try."

"Overall quite nice, very tasty. Smooth, rich, quite tasty, nice aroma, well done Imperial stout I would come back to plenty of times. I can see the hype for this one. Booze is hidden pretty well too, nice coffee, caramel, cookie and candy flavors without getting too sweet or undrinkable."
""
"D: unsure of the difference between bottled-on and best-by here, I have to assume this is relatively fresh. regardless, just a super drinkable, super rich stout. I could sip on this thing all night."

""
"I can see where the hypes coming from because this ones awesome, great mix of chocolate and coffee and I'm impressed that 11.5% is almost completely concealed. I'm shocked how easy this one is to drink, no issues taking down the bomber even after tackling a few strong beer beforehand. I'm finding that one eye wants to close from the booze and my other eye's wide open from the coffee, this could be a long night"

"easily one of the best imperial stouts ive ever had, bar none. fits the bill on the pour, dark and thick, with only a short mocha head, but with an easily provoked flash of fresh bubbles upon a gentle shake of the glass. no light coming through this one, and an aroma of roasting coffee, satin smooth malt sugar, whole vanilla beans, and a woody spirit I have yet to encounter, but would love to. there is layered complexity in the flavor, but everything is balanced artfully. more chocolate than the nose gives away, both milk and unsweetened dark. heavily roasted but not bitter burnt malt, syrupy vanilla, and fresh tobacco smoke round out the finish. there are bursts of sweetness throughout this beer, coming in for just a second before vanishing back into the darkness. the only bitterness at all is right up front, a pleasing backwardness from convention. the body is as full as it gets, the alcohol is magically disguised, coming out only when it warms up, and the carbonation is surprisingly active, helping this beer evolve and slide down easy. from a pure flavor standpoint, this might be the best imperial stout ive ever encountered. worth every bit of the hype. the only questions that remain for me are how do I get more? and where can I get other evil twin brews? are they all this good? splendid stuff here people."
""
"O- The rich smooth big stout is mellow with nice biscotti characteristics and the layers of flavor grow as it opens up. This is a very taste beer, and a wonderful sipper."
""
""
""
"D - An absolute waste of $15. The coffee takes over and dampens whatever further complexity there could have (and should have) been. Easily one of the most overrated stouts I've come across."

"22oz bottle. Pours a viscous pitch black with very little head. No lacing. A lot going on in the nose. Nutty and chocolatey with some coffee, sweet cookies and hints of vanilla. The taste mirrors the aroma. Dark chocolate and nutty at first. Sweet almonds and cookies followed by a bitter coffee finish and some heat. Big alcohol presence but not overwhelming. Hints of vanilla, almost like vanilla frosting. Thick, heavy mouthfeel. I am thoroughly impressed by this one. Definitely a fitting name. Overall, a tad pricey but I will still be seeking out another bottle for certain."

"I was led to believe that this was an extremely sweet, coffee-flavored double stout. I found it to be a nicely balanced, very intensely-flavored roasty beverage full of charred fruit notes that I would be hard-pressed to distinguish from a Russian Imperial Stout when consumed at room temperature. Highly recommended, but I would not recommend this beer to a newbie or to those unfamiliar with Imperial Stouts."
""
""
"Overall this is a great Imperial stout and well worth the wait I went through for it. After recently trying Ten Fidy and the Oak Aged Yeti, I put this in roughly the same level, giving the nod to the other two simply on availability."
"Looks really hot and you've heard great things. She looks and smells awesome but is flat front and back with zero head and mouthfeel. At this point you're already getting some, so you might as well finish the job and share your experiences with your buddies to spare them the same painful fate."

""
""
"Overall: This stuff can get you drunk quick."
"I've heard a lot about this beer and the praise is well deserved beer. This is truly one of the ultimate desert beers. Complex, thick, rich, and very decadent. This one's a sipper for sure and one that'll slowly reveal itself throughout the experience. Definitely worth trying."

"Black with a thin covering of tan that pools to a creamy ring at the edge. Heavy, dark aromas of espresso, chocolate cake, candied nuts, maple, mild charcoal, and roasted barley. Increased cookie-like aromas as it warms up along with a whiff of alcohol. Sweet, roasty dark chocolate initially, joined by lots of coffee, vanilla, dark fruit, berries, and a little breadiness. Very, very rich, yet the bold coffee presence keeps the sweetness down a bit. Full, creamy body, oily in texture. Bordering on too-sweet territory, it manages to stay deliciously dessert-like and not a chore to drink. A slow sipper, but one that gets better the longer it sits in the glass."
"D: I'm enjoying this at what feels like a speedy pace however the nature of this beer preventing me from doing that. Very yummy. It's like a extra pleasant dessert."
"This is a phenomenal stout but even more a fabulous beer."

"How can a beer with so much abv taste so smooth and balanced? Answer: Evil Twin just does it better. I just love the look, smell, feel, and taste of this beer. The only thing that could make it better is heated leather seats. It may not have the bourbon stout taste of others, but it gives you an enjoyment that makes you fall in love with the style. Never watery, never unbalanced, never boring, this beer just delivers every time. My favorite from a great brewery."
""
"O - Excellent beer, unique in that it does not over do the vanilla. Relatively balanced, but sweet leaning. A rich beer so make plans to have someone available to share your bomber. Make sure the beer is at the right temp. Stating the obvious, but as the beer warms the flavors intensify."

"Pours black and thick. Small brown head. A little bit of lacing. Dissipates to swirls of film after a minute. Aroma is big on chocolate. Lots of caramel sweetness and a fruity dose of coffee. Pretty light on the roast but it's there in the background. Very nice sweet, chocolatey stout smell. Mild herbal hop note. The taste adds a bunch more coffee flavor. Big chocolate and caramel sweetness again. It's like a dark chocolate milkshake with a shot of espresso and drizzled with caramel. Mouthfeel is thick, smooth and very full. Works very well with the top flavors. Excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
"Think powdered cocoa added to a porter. There's some definitive lactose sweetness. The aftertaste is more of the same. The body is rich; the carbonation low. The alcohol is hidden behind the strong flavors--there's no way I would think this beer has 10+% abv."

"O: The coffee is mostly muddled in the sweetness and bourbon. Overall this remains a significant coffee Imperial Stout. With it's ~$18 price tag out here in Southern California, I would happily reach over and grab some local brews such as Ale Smith's Speedway Stout and the younger Cismontane's Black Dawn instead."
""
"A wonderful dessert beer. Just big and sweet. I personally prefer the Decicco's version as the spice in that beer cleans up the sweetness."
"Got this recently from MegDuf32, thank you very much. Typical imperial stout appearance. Aroma is yeast, dough, slight coffee and biscotti or some type of cookie? Flavor is pretty close to the nose and good. My only complaint regarding this beer is that it is too sweet. The alcohol is hidden but its a sugary beer and I'm not sure I'll finish the entire bottle (though I likely will)"
"Italian roast coffee/espresso flavors right off the bat. Smooth, wonderfully roasty, with increasing bitterness. As the bitterness picks up, the palate fills up with dark chocolate, molasses, figs, and licorice. Woody, tannic bitterness toward the finish. Hints of vanilla and almond. Finish features more coffee roastiness and bitterness. Lingering caramel, molasses, and chocolate. Full-bodied, with a thick, slightly oily feel. One of the best coffee beers I've had!"
"Overall: This is just one of those beers that succeeds in every way, and really nails its goal. Wouldn't want it ever day, but when in the mood, this is perfect."
""
"Amazing brew that was under the radar for me. Very nice coffee notes that take the lead but play so well with some vanilla and nice coca. Very good brew. I will seek this out more."
""
""
"O - Been waiting to try this beer for a long time, and although I was expecting something much different it did live up to the hype for me. This is a damn solid dessert beer. Just nails the biscotti + coffee motif."
""
"Poured from 22 oz bomber into snifter. Pours jet black with a deep dark brown head that dicipates quickly. Smell is a lot of chocolate, cinnimon, some coffee, sweet cookie. Taste startes with a smooth marshmallow, lots of dark chocolate, lots of cappuccino coffee, milky, some vanilla. The texture is amazing and it tastes like cappuccino ice cream, alcohol is undetectable. This has a unique coffee flavor for a stout because it isn't a bitter black coffee flavor, it's subtle but obvious in the cappuccino like flavor. This is delicious. Very thick but very drinkable and a real treat."
"O/D-This was pretty damn awesome. Its an experience in a glass. One of the better Stouts I have come across. It teeters between general awesomeness and greatness for me. It falls a few figurative inches shy of being one of my favorites but I would recommend this to anyone bold enough to try it."
""
""
"Jet black, ring of tan coloured head, no lace to speak of here. Smell is quite vanilla forward, coffee and quite a great deal of roast as well, milk chocolate along with some bittersweet points as well. Taste follows the nose, vanilla and roast, lots of bitter coffee, chocolate, some sweet vanilla sugar flavours, lingering coffee bitterness, big vanilla-chocolate-coffee aftertaste. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, a little thin at points but medium bodied throughout. Really good stuff here, much more enjoyable than the regular Biscotti Break, very drinkable for ABV and doesn't feel overly sweet."

"This is one of those times where I have a beer and I am immediately impressed on the first sip. This is truly remarkable. The perfect dessert beer."

"It's one of those transcendent stouts that gives you something new to praise at every sip. Just when you have seen it all in Stoutland, Evil Twin offers something more to entice the taste buds."

"Imperial Biscotti Break pours out a very dark brown with a pinky worth of head. The aroma has a strong sweetened coffee flavor jumping out, along with some nutty flavors and a bit of roasted malts and dark fruits. The taste brings out the flavor I got as ""sweetened coffee"" - there's a very solid amount of milk chocolate backing up the coffee, along with some sweet almond. Despite all the sweet flavors, Imperial Biscotti Break somehow manages to not be cloying - in fact, this is one of the most drinkable imperial stouts I've had in a while. The mouthfeel is very luxurious, it's very velvety feeling, with a perfect level of carbonation and a lighter body than most imperial stouts of the ABV. Overall, Imperial Biscotti Break is a fantastic imperial stout that absolutely lives up to the hype."
""
"Whiskey in the aroma. Little head on very dark brown. Medium mouthfeel. Rich looking, rich in mocha flavour. Good coffee, more of an imperial stout, though a tad thin for an IS. Lots of roast and coffee, much less sweet than the regular Biscotti break.Bottle from Premier."
"O - will definitely get again, I'm sure I won't ever get to try this on tap. Another bottle would be a treat. Highly recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So I figured I'd give this a try, as I found it at a ""good"" price of $16 for the bomber. Black, inky, some rim graham foam. Smells initially like booze, then coffee, then almonds, then dark toasted malts, then some vanilla, almond, sugar, hints of amaretto. If the booze wasn't so strong on the nose, then I'd really enjoy the smell of the beer overall. Flavor is alcohol, then dark fruits, more alcohol and some bitterness. Seriously, the alcohol is too much here for 11.5% ABV, brutal. Medium on full bodied with low carb and a tacky, dry finish. I don't get it."
"Overall, I'd say this is top tier. I would purchase this again, even at the expensive price tag."

"Overall a very tasty brew, very impressive flavor and through the roof mouthfeel. A must try for any fan of stouts."
"Overall it's a fun creation, but it does get into dessert beer territory, and really feels like it needs a food pairing. It's a bit large, but a tasty one to be had and enjoy."
"O- I've been wanting to try this for quite some time now, and it doesn't dissapoint at all. Wonderful notes of mocha, vanilla, roasted nuts and slight dried fruit in the finish. Has a touch of bitterness that blends perfectly so that it's not overly sweet. It's a remarkable stout! Bravo!"
""
"Wow! What a damn good beer. This was one of my favorites from the tasting. So tasty and drinkable for being such a bold and heavy beer. Beautiful coffee and espresso notes with little hints of cocoa, vanilla, and sugar. An absolute pleasure to drink."

"O: Extreamly good beer. Get it if you can."

"Inky black, absolutely no light comes through. Beige head that lasts. Lots of complexity here, from a malt sweetness to a dark fruity sweetness, from chocolate and carob to vanilla and toast. It's a fairly sweet stout so do not expect too much ashy or black patent flavors. Paired well with a hearty burger."

"Overall. A very tasty stout and makes a great desert."

"This one pours a full bodied dark chocolate brown in clor with a slight khaki lacing around my glass. The nose is full on candy bar. Chocolate, chocolate everywhere. I don't get much roast, just pure milk chocolate. The flavors too, almost pure chocolate with just a touch of roast. Its truffle like. It's sweet but not cloying. It is incredibly smooth, which is definitely where this beer shines. The body is perfect, perfect. Tis is a great dessert but but not overly complex. I can see why everyone likes it but its a little sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is sweet and decadent with lots of coffee and brown sugar. It kind of tastes like a latte with an extra shot of espresso and gingerbread cookies. It kind of seems to emulate some of the Southern Tier brews with the high residual sugar and thick body, but not quite on the same level. This has sat in my fridge for about 4 months and it tastes like it might be better fresh, some of the coffee flavors are starting to become slightly vegetal, which I have noticed before in old(er) coffee beers. It is still quite tasty, but not quite as much as the last time I had a fresher sample."
""
""
""
"This was a fantastic beer. It kind of reminded me of some of Southern Tier's offerings like Creme Brulee, Mokah, etc, but much more modest and I mean that in a very good way."
""
"Pours deep brown to black with a tiny mocha brown head. Sweet licorice and chocolate aroma almost like a chocolate liquer. Some bready notes. Very nice. Thick viscous mouthfeel opens up a wealth of flavor. Very sweet vanilla licorice up front, with a bit of chocolate, almond and dark fruits. Some lactose it seems here. A candy dessert beer here, but plenty drinkable. The bomber is a bit much, so probably want to share this one. Not really any alcohol notes, which is impressive at 11.5%. Nice brew with a super creamy body."

""
""

"D - Fantastic. Great overall balance with the imperial stout base with the vanilla, almonds, and other flavors."

"Cheers!"
"Overall, this is a good beer and could go down easy as a breakfast beer or for a late night sweet tooth. I was not familiar with this beer prior to trying it, but am glad I got to taste it. If EvilTwin has other beers of this caliber, if be eager to try them."
"O- This was a fantastic imperial coffee stout from Evil Twin although it probably isn't my favorite from them (I liked Even More Jesus slightly more) or coffee stout in general. Personally for coffee stouts I think the only one that beats this is Peche Mortel. The only thing I disliked in this beer was that it could have been slightly less boozey (maybe 9-10% instead of 11.5%). That being said this beer was excellent and I would definitely drink it again even with the $17 price tag."
"Was let down by this one even more so after the great appearance and aroma. A little too one note and sweet for my taste. I struggled to put down 11 oz and didn't finish what my girlfriend didn't drink either which almost never happens. That said, I'd love to see a barrel aged version of this. Adding some booze to balance the sweetness would seem to work well."

"Big thanks to yourefragile for picking this one up. Served in a cervoise. Pours a very dark brown with a decent tan head. The nose starts off with a bang. Where the regular Biscotti was lacking, this one is over the top. There’s plenty of vanilla with almond underneath. Coffee and cream. Nice backing chocolate. As it warms, it seems just a touch artificial, but otherwise, this is quite nice. Flavor falls off a bit, but is still quite nice. Vanilla and chocolate stand out. Full body and smooth feel. Very easy to drink. Excellent work."

"Decanted into a Surly Darkness goblet, this beer was an impenetrable obsidian color, though brown edges became apparent towards the end; a small cap of tannish-mocha head on top retained as a ringlet, yielding minimal lacing, more oily streaking. Appropriate for the style / ABV. Aroma was fairly roasty, notes of chocolate, vanilla, caramel. Taste was quite disappointing compared to the regular BB, roasty malts, semi-sweet chocolate, light notes of vanilla and almond, with quite a bit of intrusive booze that really thinned out the body quite a bit. I tried letting this come down closer to room temperature, but even with that, things didn't improve much. About medium-bodied, watered-down booze-like mouthfeel, not at all rich and creamy. Still decent overall, but lacking in many ways. This was a mess compared to its porter counterpart which was much more balanced and tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a deliciously balanced beer. It’s rich, complex, and smooth. It accomplishes exactly what the name indicates – a biscotti. This would make a perfect after dinner beer or a great cold weather beer. Either way it is well worth a try."
""
"O - I enjoyed this more than most non-BA stouts I've had. I really enjoyed it. I can't think of one thing I'd change, aside from a thicker mouthfeel. I think putting it in a barrel would do harm, although I can't say I wouldn't try it. Then again, it makes me think of how BCBCS would taste without the barrel."
"O - Overall, a bit of a different take on the imperial stout style. Has the requisite raostiness and coffee base, but the dominant flavors are of the sweet variety and almost in a candy-like way. A light syrupy-ness in feel that further impresses the candy aspects of the beer. Different but well done."

"Overall: Before trying this beer, I would have been shocked to hear someone tell me biscotti in a beer could work, and not only work, but edge its way into my top ten beers (and top three stouts). This excellent Evil Twin offering has proved me wrong and then some. The price is a bit steep at $16, which will keep it out of my regular fridge rotation, but if I keep seeing this one around, I will have no choice but to purchase a few more bottles. It is that great. 17.5/20"

"Overall a real nice beer. Not a very good nose but excellent flavor."

"O: Really delicious, well crafted beer. Superb balance and decent complexity. The alcohol is completely well hidden. This is like an adult version of chocolate milk."

"O: A very unique and tasty imperial stout. Great complexity with excellent balance of flavors. Unique nutty taste with lots of vanilla really puts it over the top. I have no complaints, this one was an excellently executed unique beer. Not something you find very often."
"O: Probably one of my favorite coffee beers now and something I look forward to drinking every once in a while. I would love to have access to this on a regular basis."
"T: This stuff is really bomb. Opens with a rich mix of roasted malt and molasses with a heavy coffee hard candy undertone. Then moves through some flavors of chocolate cake, chocolate covered black cherry and vanilla. Finish brings some mocha and milk chocolate. Sweet and chewy throughout. The mouthfeel is velvety and mouth-coating, leaving just a trace of warmness. An awesome dessert beer and one of the better stouts I've ever had."

"O- While the aroma was promising, the bitter coffee taste really hurt this beer IMO. Glad I tried this as I've been hearing good things, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find another bottle."

"A very nice beer, and one where the abv is unbelievably well hidden. Extraordinarily smooth and silky in the mouth, that is perhaps this beer's best feature. Pours inky black with a caramel colored head that fades to a thin ring fairly quickly. Lovely aromas of very good coffee, molasses, and cream. The taste is equally enticing, with further notes of that excellent coffee from Charleston Coffee Roasters, nice bitter chocolate notes, some roastiness, and a touch of caramel sweetness and cream on the finish along with more of that chocolate and coffee. Very nice. I love the long finish, and the obvious quality of the ingredients, the incredible smoothness, and the deeply flavored and well integrated flavors. Very well done indeed."
""
"O: This is one of the best Imperial Stouts that I have ever had. I would say the only problem with it is that its very sweet and I kind of got tired of it the more I drank it. Other than that, its amazing. I would probably do this in a tasting or split a bottle with somebody next time."
"Verdict: Fantastic stout from Evil Twin and by far the best beer I've had from him to date. The flavors are wonderfully balanced and massive enjoyable and the body takes this beer to a new level. The perfect desert beer."
"O: This is very good - very sweet, but very good - a perfect dessert beer."

"Overall - Quality beer. The adjuncts are very strong, but still the beer comes through. First time I had this, I wasn't all that impressed. Every time I have it I get more impressed."

"soooo glad I changed my mind about trading this. Been saving it for months and damn am I glad I held onto it. An excellent stout, best flavor, perfect feel."
"O - This is a very unique beer and I am glad to have tried it. In my opinion, not all Evil Twin beers are worth the admission price, but this one was."

"Overall this is a pretty good coffee stout which showcases the coffee without being overly bitter or burnt. Not sure if it lives up to the hype but its still worth seeking out."

"O - A good take on a coffee stout with one of the best noses I've smelled in awhile. The bitter coffee is a bit strong for my taste as it leaves a strong, bitter aftertaste."

"Imperial Biscotti Break pours solid black, with almost three fingers of milk chocolate colored foam crowning the beer. Head retention is very good, but lacing is pretty much nonexistent. The nose is fantastic, with aromas of chocolate covered almonds and a slightly spicy coffee wafting up out of the glass. The great balance present between the two in the aroma is lost a bit in the flavor profile though. The chocolate and almond notes fade way to the background, and the coffee becomes noticeably more prominent. The peppery quality to the coffee is also a bit more apparent here. A subtle vanilla sweetness does make itself known in the finish though. The body is nice and full and creamy, befitting a decadent stout. The minimal support needed from some carbonation just isn't there though and so the beer ends up coming across as fairly syrupy. Imperial Biscotti Break is a fairly tasty stout, and a very nice dessert beer. While I'm only trying a bottle from this second wave, and didn't have any from the first batch, I have to say I don't quite get the hype though."

"This finally hit the NYC area in bottles, Pours a very nice black and with a swirl of the glass you get a nice brown hue. Little carbonation noted. The taste is really great. Outstanding balance between coffee, chocolate, vanilla and anise. Such a desert beer. Don't age this, drink it fresh if you can! Well done!"
"O: A good beer, overall. It's a bit too sweet and difficult to drink more than a few ounces of at a time (especially an entire bomber), but still tasty before the diabetes kicks in."
""
"Got to try this at Max's thanks to a fine BA friend. Pours a nice dark brown color, minimal head to it. Strong coffee and alcohol aroma. Medium to full bodied, very strong coffee and chocolate notes and the ethanol really comes through on this one. A sipper for sure, but definitely tasty and full of flavor that finishes smooth like a nice mixed drink."
""
"Mouthfeel is perfect, like much of what Evil Twin does. Nice long lingering flavored full bodied beer. Great carbonation level, super smooth and no heat from the alcohol. Really well balanced, nice sweet start with an appropriate bitter finish, covers the appropriate taste buds when consuming a nice stout. Really drinkable, can go quick if you're not paying attention, it should be savored. Like this beer a lot."

"651mL thanks to pepsiedcan. Now, officially, I think we can say that gypsy brewing on Westbrook’s system is vastly superior to de Proef or DOG Brewing or Butternuts or any other mumbo jumbo. Pours near ink, viscous, with a large mocha head. Dense, small bubbled reverse cascade head. Sheety lacing. Nose at first was a little salty moving as it warms to heavy salted caramels and sea salted chocolate. Taste is rich, silky, luscious with sweet chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, and big cookie dough and baked crunchy cookie. Very rich and dessert heavy and definitely delivering on all the aesthetics and fundamentals. Palate is mildly lactic, easy to drink, nice balancing bitterness though this beer is still on the sweet dessert side. But no cloying. Really a masterpiece from Jeppe. 6/18/2012 8/4/8/5/16=4.1"

"The body sits an ink black with a mocha colored cap. Decent amount of lacing. The nose is of bold coffee with notes of toffee, brown sugar, vanilla, nuts, and lactose sugar. Inviting nose...I kept diving back in for more. On the palate, the flavor profile follows the nose. Cream and lactose sugar mixed with some vanilla and semi-sweet chocolate. Nuts and mild roast dry out a predominantly sweet finish. A little bit of bitter roast balances it out. Full bodied, thick and creamy. This has a lot of milk stout qualities with the flavor profile of biscotti over top. The higher abv is well hidden. I had no idea it was over 11% until I looked it up. Where this beer separates itself from the regular biscotti is in the mouthfeel."
"This poured out as a deep dark black color, there was a nice looking mocha colored head on top. The retention and lacing don't last too long. The smell of the beer is heavily roasted with a subtle sweetness to it also. The taste of the beer starts off with a bit bitter roasted flavor, some burnt sugar in the also. The flavors are chocolatey and sweet and finishes with a dry bitterness. The mouthfeel is oily and silky, it's very smooth with a thick body to it. Overall this beer is quite impressive. I enjoyed this quite a bit. Probably the best Evil Twin available right now."

"D- I think the alcohol could be tamed down a bit as well as the roast slightly. This is a great beer that I hope to find on a nitro tap someday. Hope to come across this one again"

"I had high hopes for Evil Twin's Imperial Biscotti Break but was really let down by it. While aging this might lessen the coffee character, it could also smooth out its rough edges. I would be curious to see what some time in a bourbon barrel might do to this."
""
""
"O - I was pretty excited when I saw a lone bottle of this on my trip to OH in July, as I figured it was long gone, and it didn't disappoint. A nice twist on the traditional coffee and chocolate-dominated imperial stouts."
"This is a medium bodies brew with a modest level of carbonation. Overwll a solid brew with nice integration of flavor. It is worth checking out for sure but I prefer the base over this imperial version. This one just boasts a stronger abv presence and isnt as well rounded and enjoyable as the toned-down version."
"Cost: $10 for a 10 oz snifter pour."
""
""
"O: smells better than it tastes. I hope that the funk in the taste is from poor transportation practices in getting it to California, as opposed to the actual character of the beer. I'll have to try it again from a different source. I was really looking forward to this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Outstanding beer, so well balanced. Flavors melded so subtly for such a big beer, that no single note seemed to jump out. Before opening this, I was afraid it was going to be like a ST Mokah, which is too syrupy sweet for me. It’s a beer that can be complemented with dessert, and not BE dessert. I expected and hoped it would be a little boozier and chewier than it was, but I really appreciate how understated and well crafted it is."
"Overall: This is definitaly a beer that must be shared IMO because of how big it is. Although I did enjoy this it is one that is very bold and a HUGE beer."
"O: I find this one off-balance in the smell as well as the taste… I find a sourness in the smell that pushes away some of the more aromatic notes and the taste just seems odd to me. This is my first offering by Evil Twin, and yet it is a good beer, by no means do I think that this is great (sorry, just my opinion). Not that this is a “knock”, but this one needs to be shared with others if you are going to open."
""

"O: This beer is awesome. Totally worth the price tag (I paid freaking $17 for this bottle in Seattle). My top 10 non-barrel aged imperial stout for sure."

"Black in color with an off-white head. Really great nose to this. Vanilla and chocolate along with plenty of roasted malt and coffee. A nice sweetness of caramel, too. A little bit of an oatmeal cookie flavor to go with the rich chocolate, coffee, and heavy roasted malt. A touch of vanilla throughout augments the sweetness. Really good stuff."

"O: A phenomenal Imperial Stout. Complex and balanced. I'd take this over any of Southern Tier's offerings; maybe even BCBCS."
"2013: Had a bottle of this, the main difference is a pronounced vanilla sweetness, it seemed slightly thinner in body but still very smooth and velvety."
"O - I knew I would probably like this one before we even opened it and it didn't disappoint. I love all of the flavors that this one packs and the smooth feel really brought it all together. Probably the best beer I have had from Evil Twin."

"definatly one of the better desert like stouts ive had, a very pronounced biscotti flavor. its worth the steep price tag."
"O: Amazing. Love this beer."

"o - Overall I thought this was a fantastic beer; I was blown away by how good it was considering I have been underwhelmed by pretty much every Evil Twin beer I've had. It looks and feels fantastic, and has a great chocolate/espresso nose. One of the best coffee stouts I've had, and certainly doesn't feel like 11.5%. Very glad I picked up a second bottle of this as I'll love to have it again. Will try and hold off until the fall when it is cooler to drink my other bottle, but is drinking wonderful now. A world class coffee stout."
""
"Also, i would like to add that although It's already wonderful tasting, the scary thing is I think with time it could get even better (I love the coffee presence but I think even more intricacies could come out if the coffee were mellowed down).  "
"Jarnit-Bjergsø has fun with his brews, giving them sinful names like Soft Dookie and Even More Jesus. Imperial Biscotti Break has a rather tame moniker, but its menace is in its alcohol content -- sneaky at nearly 12 percent and barely noticeable beneath the mound of flavor. A tricky evil twin, that Jeppe, and one who successfully shows that evil will always triumph, because good is dumb."
"Cheers!"
"I had this beer at the City Beer Store on tap. I then purchased it in the botlle from their retail case. This beer is similar to Mikeller's Beer Geek Brunch Weasel, but has more chocolate than coffee. chocolate, vanilla and cherries. Extremely well balanced."
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, roasted coffee beans, and some cocoa aromas. Taste is much the same with a medium level of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. There is also a slightly sticky quality in the mouth. Overall, this is a very good beer with some awesome aromas and flavors and is extremely tasty."
""
""
"Nose is like chocolate milk with a hint of coffee. It seriously smells like Nesquik. The taste is very similar. A lot less boozey than the Yin but 1.5% higher. Tastes like chocolate milk blended with ice coffee and just a hint of anise and dark fruit."
"Beer tastes miles ahead of non-imperial verison of the beer. It is sweet with a medium body, a nice creamy finish with vanilla and mild coffee / roast. I really enjoyed it and would have it again although as hard as this was to get I don't think I will have it again."
"M: Full bodied, thick viscous stout."
""
"O: The alcohol is pretty well hidden in this beer with just the slightest hint in the taste. The smell of this beer is very inviting.Very enjoyable, a great sipping beer and I would love to have this one again."
"The mouthfeel is pretty full, but seems lacking even still. I dunno why. It's not full-bodied, more on the full side of medium-bodied. Overall, this is am impressive stout. I'm not usually much for sweet dessert stouts like this but there's enough beer here for me to take notice. Recommended."
"O: Definite sipper. 25cl glass took 2 hours to finish. Wouldn't want more than that."
"Sered on tap at the Local Option. Pours a thick oily opaque brownish black. Small amount of tan head hangs around with nice bit of lacing. The aroma is rich and chocolatey, bold coffee aroma comes through which is integrated with the chocolate. Nutty notes of almond come through with a touch of vanilla. malt and molasses present as well. Taste features waves of vanilla paired with bold roast coffee and chocolate. Awesome balance I flavors. Somewhat sweet, but does not become overbearing. Mouthfeel is thick and luscious with mild carbonation. Overall, this is a delicious dessert beer with great balance considering its stature."

"A top notch imperial stout falling firmly on the sweet side of the ledger. Phenomenal late night sipper. I’d buy this often if it wasn’t so expensive. Also can’t be good for my already burgeoning waistline."
"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a snifter. Pours black as oil with a thin dark tan head. The aromas has a bit of alcohol on the nose followed by lots of sweetness. This thing really smells like fresh baked biscotti. The taste is similar to the smell but so much more complex. Lots of sweetness - vanilla, almonds, cocoa, and sweet bread. It finishes with some roasted malts and a bit of alcohol. I would never guess this brew to be over 10%. The mouthfeel is incredible, maybe the best part of the beer. It's so wonderfully creamy. Evil Twin really created a masterpiece here and I'm glad to have tried it. It's a bit expensive but certainly not overpriced. If you see it, buy it, and then buy some more. I can't wait to try this on draught in a couple of weeks."
""
"I had no idea what I was buying but I come from a family who knows how to enjoy fresh baked biscotti, multiple variations but to no end we love this Italian cookie. When I pour this variation of motor oil it's pitch black and forms a thicket of mocha tan head with even fine lacing. Aroma, nutty fresh baked biscotti, it's crazy that's what I'm smelling. Cookie dough, chocolate chip, caramel drizzled on it, with a hint of cream/powdered sugar notes. Excellent combination of flavors this is the beer of all beers, this needs to be brought back to the masses. Nutty, coffee, broken biscotti dunked in a coffee that is this beer, it's amazing. With caramelized malt sugars, slight hints of cream, basically a beautiful marriage of liquid flavors that I can't fully describe it must be experienced. This beer is a perfect coffee, chocolate, imperial stout as there ever has been, this is creative across the pond brew that I want to be part of. Send us more, this drinks smooth, big booze, big alcohol, flavor...it's interesting. Mouthfeel is full bodied carbonation is flowing full and independently of all other forces this is perfect beer. Overall amazing, if I haven't gotten that point across yet, it's much appreciated and I will grab another bottle of this beauty."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch brown head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. The aroma is very nice, the brew smells like coffee, roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, molasses, dark fruit and some vanilla. The taste is mostly like the aroma, there's coffee, roasted malt, bittersweet and milk chocolate, burnt/charred malt, caramel, vanilla, molasses, dark fruit, nuts, and a little bit of licorice is noticeable. Nice mix with the sweet and bitter flavors in this brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit slick and creamy with moderate carbonation. I think this is a pretty good brew overall, it's certainly one of the best I've had lately. $12.99 a bottle is a deal for this, I'll be buying another bottle the next time I see it."

"You could drink this for breakfast, lunch or dinner, but if makes a killer dessert. If I could get more of this I'd make it into an ice cream. Definitely one to savor; It took me over an hour to finish a 9oz pour of this. Almost cried when it was gone. Luckily I've got a couple bottles at home. Seek this out, you won't be disappointed."
""
""
""
"Be careful when you open the bottle - the sample I got fizzed like nobody’s business! Strong aroma has a firm and mouth-watering overtone of quality coffee with hints of unsweet chocolate and molasses. It pours a rich opaque sable just a flea’s eyebrow above black. Flavor is just simply sublime - quality coffee, roast malt, licorice, hints of molasses and chocolate. Could it get any better? Full, smooth texture has a good fizz to it and leaves a finish rich in roast coffee, semi-sweet chocolate and licorice."
""
""
"O: Good stuff. The mouthfeel takes away from this one, but it's still a quite-enjoyable stout."
"An absolutely awesome stout! I wanted more and was sad to see the bottle end. It was addicting."
"O: Starts sweet with plenty of dark fruits and works its way dry and bitter towards dark chocolate and espresso. Has an excellent complexity and hides the alcohol extremely well. I really couldn't ask for more in an Imperial Stout."
"The flavor literally made me go weak in the knees for a split second. Thick, chewy dark chocolate brownies blend perfectly with a rich espresso note, vanilla beans, and a hint of almond and booze in the finish. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and lightly carbonated. Chewy, but drinkable, and the 11.5% is hardly detected on the palate. Overall, a superb example of a flavored imperial stout. So glad I happened to run across this bottle!"
"overall: very well done. This one goes down like a session milk chocolate. Bravo."
"O: a very tasty and delicious brew, glad I got my hands on this one, unique and delectable, I'd recommend this one in a heart beat. More and more layers off developing complexity. I love it. Wish ingot to try the original, anyone got one? Let me know if you do!!!"
"D - A definite sipper, and probably too rich to have more than one in an evening, perhaps two. Just as good as Biscotti Break and delivers exactly as promised - it's a bigger version of the original."

"Excellent, amazing flavors, great body and smell. Can't wait to have it again."

"oh man. this may be expensive, but it's definitely worth every penny. Perfect dessert beer. I'm just imaging what some age would do to calm the heat, or maybe some barrel aging..."
"O - This is the surprise beer of the year for me. I went into this not expecting it to live up the the high rating it already has. This is a great beer that is well worth the high price tag. Glad I got a few bottles as this seems like it could also improve with age."
""
"Notes: A really good ""flavored"" Imperial Stout. Coffee and chocolate dominated as expected, but the vainilla and to a lesser extent the almonds had their time to shine. All the flavors complimented each other wonderfully (the vainilla and chocolate together especially). I would love to have this in the morning or for dessert any day in lieu of coffee. Delicious."
""
"A pleasantly different angle on a favorite style of mine- the coffee stout. There is something reminiscent of Westbrook's Mexican Cake- perhaps that great chocolatey background. This is well worth the fairly hefty price and I really must find another of these to try again in 12-18 months when the flavors will be blended even better and the feel will be even creamier. I highly recommend buying this if you find it- and then sending it to me!"

"Pours black with a thin tan head and some nice lacing. Smell is very nice - a great mix of coffee and chocolate. Taste is quite nice - it's very roasty, but there is a great mix of flavors going on here. It's a little sweet, and the coffee and chocolate come through very nicely here. It's quite drinkable for as big and bold of a stout as this is. Mouthfeel is thick and a bit oily, but quite nice. Overall, this is pretty impressive - best beer I've had from Evil Twin and the first one I'd go out of my way to seek out."
"O: One of the more enjoyable beers I've tried recently. Totally drinkable."
"I picked this one up in Seattle and shipped it back to CA... so I'm not really sure where else it's available."

"O: The burnt malt flavor is a bit much on this beer, but the sweetness in the way of toffee and caramel and the nuttiness that comes through is extremely nice."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the flavoring. The mix of the most robust bitter char, with sweeter malts, great coffee, and great chocolate makes for an amazing drink. It seems simple at first, but the malts show great complexity, with the mixing sweetness and bitter so expertly blended. Another remarkable fact is that the alcohol is almost never apparent, despite the big tag. The flavors are just that good. If there was one complaint it would have to be that the nose was a little light in comparison to how robust everything else was. This beer is truly a must have."
"This is an excellent impy stout and probably the best beer I've had from Evil Twin. Dessert and breakfast rolled into one and bottled. Loved it."
""
"I went into this only reading the label which set my expectations up somewhat for what I was getting into. Having had only one other beer from Evil Twin (to my recollection), this was wonderful. Big coffee notes played extremely well with the aggressive roasted malt backbone this beer had. Tone down the alcohol notes a bit, but still this is one to try."
""
"I missed out on this while it was on tap at Sessions here in Greensboro so I had to pick up a bottle while at Bestway today.Poured into an oversized wine glass jet black with a deep mocha colored head,just deep and rich looking.Deep bitter chocolate,dark fruit,and toasted almonds over top of dark espresso roast coffee notes,as it sits more sweet alcohol comes into play,deep and complex aromas here.Chocolate and dark fruit dominate the palate,obviously it's quite roasted with the mocha java quality to it.It's big complex and sticky,the best Evil Twin brew I have had no question about that,great stuff here."
"Pours a deep, dark, near black with thick and dense creamy brown head. Good retention and lacing. Powerful scent evokes brownies and fudge, cream cheese frosting, dark roasted espresso with cream and sugar, brown sugar and spiced cookies, fresh scraped vanilla bean, tart dark fruit and a a kiss of almond paste. Taste brings all of these fantastic components and blends them together into a bold, flavorful brew with a distinct touch of port like alcohol. Full bodied, creamy with a faint powdery texture. All around fantastic beer, best from this brewer yet."
"Sweeet! It's definitely dessert time when you're about to drink this one and I definitely couldn't drink it every day but I think it deserves such a high score for it's boldness and layering of flavors. I was also able to just sip on this for about an hour or so at the bar so it was great for a casual drinking beer. THis one is worth every penny though and I'm glad I picked up a bottle in the city last weekend."
"it feels sticky sweet, but the bitterness from the stout base balances that out. But lets be honest here, the biscotti flavors take over."
"WOW! I love this beer. The look of this beer is awesome. Had a nice head for a high abv. beer, nice lacing, And black as night. The smell is of Dark chocolate, vanilla, almond, and sweet malt. The taste is of dark chocolate, almond, espresso, coffee liquor, creme, caramel and the hops give it a dark chocolate bitterness. The feel is creamy, silky, and has nice carbonation. VELVET! Pure Heaven in beer form. I love This beer. It is expensive but worth every cent! This is the best imperial stout i have had! Only the Founders KBS and CBS come close in my opinion. Nice Work Evil Twin!!!! Says limited brewed once... Please God make them brew it again!"
"Served from bottle into a Green Man snifter. Poured a massively dark brown (almost black) with a half finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, milk chocolate, bread, wood, and subtle sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, vanilla, dark chocolate, bread, coffee, cream, and milk chocolate. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The aroma and flavor were really nice on this one if I’m honest. The flavor was the star though as it was very well balanced and coated your palate, leaving it wanting more after each sip. The aroma was very pleasant as well and very inviting. I could see non-craft beer drinkers enjoying the aroma on this one. Probably one of the best brews I’ve had from Evil Twin to-date. Great job on this one guys!"
"O- Excellent beer. Embraces the name well and reminds you of coffee and shortbread."

"This is the best porter I have ever had the chance to drink. I cannot think of anything that I would change in it. Simply perfect. A very sophisticated brew for true beer enthusiasts. What an experience!"
"O - I’ve got to say, I was a little disappointed by this beer. It looked pretty good and smelled terrific, but the taste left me looking for more. There was a lot going on but it wasn’t necessarily well-layered or balanced. This had far too much sweetness and not enough roasted bitterness for my liking in an imperial stout. This beer does hide the alcohol pretty well. Overall, it's a decent imperial stout, but I'm not sure I would get it again."
