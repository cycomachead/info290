4.49,3.9,4.5,4.25,4.5,5,4.5,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is jet black and pours thick, with a clingy, creamy, dark tan head that slowly settles out across the top of the beer. Aromas of fresh ground roasted coffee, with a pretty solid smack of smoke, tobacco, charred wood, licorice, and a hint of booze. Flavors are heavy dark roast coffee forward, with a solid backbone of rich bittersweet chocolate. Highlights of campfire smoke and cigar tobacco are prominent, with lesser accents of licorice, cream, and booze heat darting in and out. Insanely smooth and velvety in mouth, with a coating effect throughout your mouth. Impressive. The aftertaste has a more subtle blend, compared to the palate, of coffee and chocolate, with the highlights slowly fading away. Smooth, thick, velvety finish, with a subtle coffee linger. Very tasty, very well crafted beer. Bravo!","GarthDanielson","Mar 30, 2015"

Flavor is on the sweet side, backed by dates, prunes, and figs, but finishes bitter and a touch resiny. Dark fruits really dominate, but there's an underlying caramel malt character and notes of cocoa and roast that complement nicely. Not sure of the age, but the coffee is somewhat subtle.  The finish is a touch harsh for my liking. Notes of licorice and smoke emerge as it warms, along with more dark chocolate and roast. If it weren't for that overly spicy finish...","barczar","Dec 08, 2014"

Its jet black, malty and coffee and chocolate smells galore.  The coffee taste isn't quite as strong as expected but its definitely delicious, nice and thick mouthfeel.  Not sure how its 11%--not too boozy but leaves you feeling satisfied.  When I'm in the mood (and my wallet is full) I will definitely reach for another.","Tbub18","Nov 03, 2014"

Coffee then turns bitter, overcoming the milk chocolate note more and more. While the brew actually begins sweeter than expected, the sweetness doesn’t take over the whole palate, due to the rich coffee infusion. Also the coffee bitterness is very balanced, as a strong earth maltiness holds it at bay. The most surprising aspect is the incredible smoothness in this brew, making this the perfect pairing for e.g. a fruity chocolate cake, providing the creaminess for both, cake and brew. Alcohol is very well integrated in this complex tasting beer, adding to the bitter coffee sting, without being detectable on its own.","aleigator","Oct 28, 2014"

It's the first time I've had Kopi Luwak, in beer or coffee, and I must say that the inherent qualities of the civet-processed beans seem to work quite well with beer, due to the lower amounts of bitterness and pure coffee smell and taste. Since Shelton Bros. came back to Missouri, I've seen this one more and more on the shelves which means I'll likely be picking up a bottle every now and again. It's a little pricey, but for a once-in-a-while treat, it's well worth it.","LambicPentameter","Sep 23, 2014"

Aroma of dark toasted malt, drip coffee, hints of chocolate. Flavor is rich, delicious dark toasted malt, chocolate, latte coffee with an interesting light cherry or berrry fruit note. Great creamy body and mouth feel, like a whipped dessert. Wow. The coffee in this is extremely well integrated into the malt and the oatmeal gives it both depth and great body. I did not expect to find such an unusual light fruit note to the coffee, having never tasted the civet cat coffee version. This convinces me to try the coffee too. This is a world class stout that is delicious, distinctive and excellently balanced.","LiquidAmber","May 15, 2014"

I’m assuming it’s the coffee or other possible adjuncts they used but this was a different coffee experience as compared to other coffee beers; more dense chocolate flavors, spicy coffee and a silky body from the oatmeal. While this was an expensive beer to try, I’d say it’s worth picking up once as it does not disappoint. If you’d like to try the next best thing after Espresso Yeti then this is your beer. Would love to try it out of a cognac or bourbon barrel.","CowsandBeer","Jan 08, 2014"

Smell is definitely dark fruits, dark/burnt malts, and a nice little bit of coffee but not overpowering. Taste is really nice. There are the dark/burnt malts and everything that was in the nose but the coffee or something is radiating a nice caramel taste that really sticks out and is quite a nice, noticeable surprise. Mouthfeel is medium thick when swished around the mouth. Overall this is the 2nd time I have had this beer and I love it this time just as much as I remember. I'm not sure if the caramel is coming from the weasel coffee but it really gives this beer a nice kick that sticks out and makes it REALLY good.","NeedBeerHere","Jan 04, 2014"

The nose is burnt caramel, coffee (more pronounced as it warms), chocolate, a little bitterness, and a touch of fruitiness. The taste definitely brings forward a rich coffee bitterness swept over by full bodied sweetness and a lingering bitter-sweet coffee aftertaste. It's got the body I'd expect from a big double stout with modest alcohol, little carbonation, and most of its bitterness derived from the coffee, though there may be a hop component that creeps up in the finish. This is definitely what I expected; big flavors, great coffee highlights, and affordability.","ThePorterSorter","Oct 20, 2013"

Aroma is heavily roasted, nice sweet coffee and a touch of vanilla. I ended up leaving this beer in the snifter for about 20 minutes before I started drinking it, and I'm very glad I did. Taste was considerably better once it approached proper temperature. Sweetness of the coffee shines in this brew. Also leathery, deep roasted malt, and an earthiness that I associate with some kind of wood (maybe Pine?). Oats really make the mouthfeel nice and silky.","mverity","Oct 06, 2013"

There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

There's a residual resinous quality as well. The whole point of Kopi Luwak coffee is that it has no bitterness. It seems a little off the mark not to showcase that more, considering how expensive it is. If I wanted a hoppy stout i'd get a Storm King. That said, it is full bodied and viscous, smooth and bitter at the same time. Burns a little in the throat but you don't taste the nearly 11% ABV. Overall worth a try, just wish it was a little smoother and had more unique coffee flavor.","emerge077","Sep 02, 2013"

I will definitely track some more of these down and hoard them, as they would age excellently well - however, the coffee really is the highlight, and as a result would be tempting to open as soon as I buy them. If you are a stout fan, do yourself a favor and get this at least once in your life. It's a glorious recipe to be reckoned with.","magictacosinus","Aug 22, 2013"

God knows what Mikeller spent to produce this beer. Pours a beautiful pitch black color with rising toffee tan head, fine lacing left behind beautiful beer to look and salivate about. Aroma has deep alluring espresso creamed coffee, dark chocolate, and a blast of dark roasted malts. Flavors encompass the palate, it takes off with nearly burnt dark roasted malts, expressive rich coffee, acid from the coffee beans livens up the palate beautifully, most exotic beer I've ever tasted nearly 9 bucks for 11 odd ounces of this stuff definitely worth the price tag. The dark roasted malts and the creamy richness in each sip with a strong dark coffee flavor is marvelous. Mouthfeel is rich inviting, and at times a bit abrasive but all in all the dark chocolate coffee aspects meld into beauty into a full bodied creamy stout that must be experienced no alcohol burn on the palate for me this legendary beer now I know why their beers carry the hype that they have. Overall a hell of an experience when it comes to beer the type of beer that makes you stop and realize everything that you have been passionate about is coming to a pinnacle.

BGB incorporates coffee quite well (better than anything besides Speedway), and BGBrunch makes that coffee flavor even richer and more luxurious. It’s hard to tell, but it seemed like I could taste the berry and chocolate notes of the coffee. At any rate, the beer is quite good, as well. Lots of gentle roast and rich chocolate. Vanilla and caramel also chime in. Mouthfeel is excellent, smooth and rich. Very little booze. Pours very dark with a small beige head. Great stout.","popery","Jan 25, 2013"

Roasted coffee nose and flavor is roasted coffee and some malty sweetness, seems like a decent imp oatmeal stout without detecting any weasel turds but then I always take a pass when the weasel turds are passed around so I don't know what they taste like.

The nose is of dark chocolate, molasses, licorice, coffee grounds, grassy hops, and deep roast. Big, robust nose that just screams intense. The flavor profile is much like the nose. Loads of coffee grounds, dark baker's chocolate, molasses and licorice. Some grassy hops come through in the finish, before another big, bitter sweep of coffee and chocolate. The sweetness from the chocolate, licorice, and molasses help to balance out the overall bitterness. Full-bodied, low carbonation. Smooth, velvety body. This is a beautiful stout in all aspects. Huge aroma, well-integrated bold flavors, great mouthfeel.","ColForbinBC","Sep 15, 2012"
4.8,11.1,5,5,5,4,4.5,"O: Literally the only thing that lets this beer down is the glycerol and slightly overcarbonated mouthfeel, which you could obviously partially remedy by letting it breathe for a while.

The taste is another story all together. It screams coffee. Strong, dark roasted, black coffee. There are some slight notes of chocolate and maybe some raisins with just the tiniest touch of anise.

I think I prefer BCBCS a bit more in terms of coffee stouts, but this is a huge achievement, I though it was going to beer an average gimmicky beer using one of the most expensive coffee beans, buts its just so damn delicious.

In all other aspects its a really great big stout, the hefty price tag (I paid $16 for ~17 ounces), which I'm sure is a result of the price of the coffee, puts it into the every-once-in-a-while or novelty region, but if you see this on the shelf it's absolutely worth trying.","WillCarrera","Feb 09, 2012"

4.95,14.6,5,5,5,4.5,5,"Pour is onyx with virtually no light penetrating the beer. The head developed about one finger thick and was a tan brown color. Head retention is short as it quickly fades back into the beer. Trace amounts of lacing occurred. The aroma from this brew is absolutely mouth-watering for anyone who likes coffee (or chocolate or beer for that matter). The immediate and dominant smell is of potent coffee but the beautiful thing is that despite the potency a myriad of other aromas still break through. It took me near 20 sniffs to identify what individual notes I could but I believe I smell dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, molasses, dark fruits, licorice, and a light hoppiness. Tasting the beer reveals an immensely complicated grouping of flavors. Coffee, dark chocolate, and dark malts are at the forefront. These three stick out and dominate the first touch of the beer to the tongue. It is very well-balanced. The initial tastes yield to more subdued notes of dark fruits, nuts, and oats. The finish is a touch acidic and the coffee aftertaste lingers long after the swallow. The quality of the world-class coffee used is evident. This beer has the most impressive mouthfeel I have yet experienced. It is very smooth and almost creamy. It can only be described as thick as it feels as if your mouth is both filled and coated with beer simultaneously. The carbonation is very fine. The mouthfeel compliments the tasting but allows the tasting to shine - as it should. The alcohol content of 10.9% is amazingly well hidden; however, I could feel its presence after having had to consume this beauty in a fairly short time. This isn’t a session beer but goes down easy enough. This is the best beer I have tried to date. I feel privileged to have been able to even have a bottle. I am afraid this is a must-buy whenever I see it. The journey of flavors this beer took me on left me sitting on my couch with my empty glass in hand feeling content, relaxed, and sporting a goofy smile. If that isn’t a summary of what a brewer should be aiming for, I don’t know what is.","gramity","Dec 19, 2011"

My overall impression is that this is a pretty well made stout which I’m happy to have tried but I’ll look for something with just a bit less burnt character in the finish. Also it should be noted that this one is fairly temperature sensitve in that as the beer warms the burnt bitterness becomes much harder to detect.","drtth","Dec 12, 2011"

(Would love to meet the guy who discovered it.) Got mixed feelings on this one, but ultimately leaning toward a thumbs up with the caveat that I probably won't be reaching for another bottle anytime soon. (Especially at $15/bottle.) Pours beautifully, not much head but what's there is a gorgeous coffee brown with some beautiful lacing. The smell is rich in coffee at first becoming more molasses and bourbon. After you get that strong coffee flavor up front - which is absolutely delicious - there's a powerful bitterness that is enjoyable but a touch overwhelming as it warms up. And at over 10% abv, that alcohol is there in presence and flavor. Really a bomber of a beer, big flavors, big price, big concept - really cool, worth a shot but not one that will make it into the steady rotation.","MrELovesBeer","Sep 25, 2011"

4.7,8.8,5,5,4.5,5,4.5," The taste is delicious in that it carries a full on coffee and mocha taste without punishing you with coffee acidity or too much hops to clutter up the oatmeal stouts silky flavors. There is a mild roasted and caramel malt sweetness in the background but I love how fresh the coffee gives a very fresh and almost spiced flavor with some stone fruit tinges for good measure. I will say I loved this as much if not more than the original Beer Geek Breakfast which is saying a lot considering it is one of my favorite of this style. I appreciate the subtleties that Mikkeller is able to bring out in this beer, not many come close to the complexity and richness. If I had to describe it I would say a coffee stout is like eating a hershey bar, but Brunch Weasel is like eating the finest chocolate truffles. I recommend this to anyone.

Caramel and something else adds to the creaminess in the flavour and in the feel. Mouthfeel is ridiculously good, huge fullness and density with a great bitterness. Very much based around the coffee, but balance and contrasted well with the sweeter and thicker aspects of the body. No alcohol whatsoever, and coffee flavours and the roastiness impart lingers.

Theres some bitterness is the finish and a dryness. Lots of decent dark, roasted malt characteristics. Overall, a very enjoyable beer to try, but does not standout as exceptional in its style.

Both beers are very rich, but the brunch is just a little bit fuller with a much stronger balance in the tastes.

Tastes of sweet malt, roasted malt, alcohol, slight hops, hint of coffee, and a slight acidic/tangy citric note. Overall, great appearance, good feel, body, and blend.

Drinkability is incredible for the abv of 10.9%, as it goes down like regular coffee - fast.

On one layer you get the espresso and chocolate flavors, but the beer also has a layer of fruit and port that provides a surprisingly delicate sweetness on top of the strong earthy foundation. There's also a mesquite smoke note that helps bind things together. The beer rewards repeated sips as there are a lot of flavors to process that also blend well as a whole.

Smells of coffee and a bit of booze, but lacking the richness I was expecting. The flavor is of strong, delicious coffee, balanced with a small amount of creaminess. It finishes with a bit of bitterness and booziness that is not as pleasant as the front. Again, the creaminess in the mouth is spot on, not over done but providing good balance.

Immediately you get a nose full of nice deep roasted coffee to wake you up, and then you realize there is a slight sweetness as well. Upon the first taste, BANG!, what flavor. It is very nice and stout without being overwhelming. You get a mouth full of earthy coffee and sweet deep dark chocolate. The beer is chewy but smooth on the palate and finish. Even though it is 10.9 ABV, the alcohol does not overpower the flavor or drinkability. It is not a beer to drink quickly, settle in and prepare yourself to enjoy.

A nice looking stout. Smells include that expensive coffee they used which has a unique scent to it. strays off the beaten path. Under that a heaping of roasted malt, chocolate, and some nuts with vanilla. The coffee is the main feature here and while the method of production is awkward (weasel crapped coffee beans) it's not off putting and I dig the coffee backed by sweet vanilla and alot of roast and nuts. This is tasty beer and I wish I tried it sooner. Feel is medium plus with a build and a smooth backlash, nothing obtrusive here, semi bitter end with no alcohol, just roast.

The head is mocha colored and very thick and creamy looking, leaving behind soapy lacing all around. The smell is coffee right up front; very strong dark coffee, with notes of leather and a trace of alcohol. It's pretty nice, but it's not very present. The taste follows the smell but with aggression! The taste has coats my tongue with a flavor or big roasted malts, dark fruits, coffee and finish with an interesting bitter coffee and hop finish. The coffee is really well done, it is certainly an enormous presence in this one but doesn't overpower anything and allows the other elements of this beer to shine. The mouthfeel is simply fantastic. It's silky and creamy and doesn't leave a sticky syrupy mess as with a lot of the big stouts. Drinkability is as good as it gets with something this big.

Some alcohol is there as well. The first taste is quite warming, with notes of wood and raspberry/cherry cascading down with coffee and roasted chocolate flavors. It's a thick beer, the sipping kind. Feels like I should be snowed in someplace drinking this for warmth. As the beer warms the flavors expand, running the gamet from somewhat fruity and sweet to somewhat bitter and roasted.

Taste comes in vanilla-sweet at first and turns into heavy coffee bitterness that leaves a very dry long lasting finale as a mouthfeel.

The crown is a shade or two beyond milk chocolate, probably the darkest I've ever seen, and it leaves a bunch of lace as it slowly creeps down the side of the glass. The nose is dominated by bitter dark coffee, but it's a type of coffee I've never smelled before, rich and bitter yet smooth and refined. The taste takes that coffee smell from the nose and marries is beautifully with rich dark chocolate, though the coffee maintains control throughout. Every time I have an oatmeal stout I wish more stouts were brewed with oatmeal, because you really can't beat the silky smooth mouthfeel.

Poured one shade shy of black with a dense, two inch mocha-colored head that sizzled and popped as it gradually condensed, leaving honeycombs and craters in its wake. Head eventually settles into a soapy skim that coalesces around the edges, but is refreshed with a swirl. Some specks and strands of lacing exposed during the tasting. Huge malt bomb of a nose - it smells sweet and syrupy. Roasty, dark fruit, cocoa, molasses and a coffee quality, but not as much as anticipated. Taste follows nose, but not nearly as bold as the nose would suggest; nonetheless, still very sweet and decadent. Finish starts off sweet, but there is also a slight bitterness that also reveals itself once the sweetness dissipates. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a light and tingly carbonation. Not viscous, but definitely a slickness to it. There's also a little bit of residual alcohol heat in the mix. A very tasty beer and far superior to Beer Geek breakfast, but a little steep at $13.99 a bottle. Still definitely worth picking this one up if it is truly a one off.","Jwale73","May 04, 2010"

This creature stands nicely among them, no light able to either penetrate its seemingly endless tracts or reflect from its B-2 surface. You ever look at the back of your eyelids in the dark and see nothing but an ever-expanding wasteland of nothingness? I know I have, and the experience is eerily similar to gazing into this brew's hypnotizing (and clearly damned) soul. The luscious inch-plus of foamy burnt siena (I miss using crayons...) on top just makes me feel even closer to this glass. I wanna make my move, but I don't want to come on too strong. (You only get one shot at a looker like this.) Speaking of not coming on too strong, the coffee smells emanate greatly from the surface, combining with some minor amount of chocolate, but don't o'erwhelm. I've gotta move in and sip on this beauty right now! Ahh, it's good to know that my nose doesn't lie to me as much as I have suspected in the past: The coffee and chocolate (though it's closer to cocoa now) make a triumphant parade down the tongue, thickly, stickily, and tastily. Not much else is there, though I think a small pine sapling is trying its best to find some sunlight in the surrounding pitch. It doesn't matter, though, as the flavors' simplicity weave into the double-helix of greatness DNA. Something like that. Bottom line: very tasty. Everything comes together to create a dangerously drinkable demon, sitting atop our doorways' busts of Athena, mocking us with its stoic consistency until we finally give way and lose our minds, succumbing to our darkest, innermost madnesses.

The coffee flavor works well with the earthy oatmeal chocolate and vanilla presence. No surprise that while the fizzy sound effects suggest a high degree of carbonation, that the mouth is dominated by the impact of the silky smooth bourbon...the oatmeal lends a premium body and slight graininess to the mouth and compliments the taste by sustaining a wonderful lingering quality. Full flavored, this one has a world class complexity that sends my consideration around and around. Bouncing from coffee to oat to vanilla to bourbon to chocolate and back again. WOW!!

Fruity and with caramel as well as the rich, roasty notes. Clearly there is a reason people drink the stuff. It works particularly well with the roasted barley notes, licorice, and bitter chocolate of the stout, both in aroma and taste.

A huge, brown head that faded but an initial display that would have made a peacock hang its head in shame. The aroma a big coffee over chocolate full house. For taste, I am expecting "in your face" coffee, ala Speedway Stout. But, lo and behold, while coffee is there this beer is dominated by CHOCOLATE. The feel is oily, rich, velvet and what else is hidden in those inky, ebon depths. Drinkability? Naaaahhh, I would drink a thousand litres just for the pure pleasure, but would probably regret it. This, this weasely geek brunch, much like a fine wine (one that actually tastes good), is a sipper. But still gets a D-4 out of respect for everything else. You should never, ever drink any of this.

Chocolate and coffee seem evenly balanced in the nose, along with a cream-of-wheat/creamy oatmeal quality. Roasty more than smoky/burnt. Velvety mouthfeel with a somewhat bittersweet finish. Smooth cocoa and rich coffee up front. The coffee used is smooth, sweet, and bitter all at the same time, with neither really drowing out the other. The oats and malt compliment these flavors well. A welcome burnt grain taste pops up here as this warms. Hop bitterness shows through in the finish once the beer warms.

There was a bit of dark-malt character and maybe even a hint of tartness, but otherwise it was kind of dull. I expected a strong dose of coffee, but it didn't find it. The flavor was better, though. The taste has a rush of dry-ish/dark malts up front, some English yeast characteristics, dark sweet-ish fruit later on, and a touch of coffee. Again, the coffee character is milder than I expected. In fact, the coffee almost gets lost within what would normally be just a coffee-style character from various roasted malts.

In my opinion, Beer Geek Breakfast has more coffee in the nose. The flavor is much the same. Dark roasted grains dominated the flavor profile, giving it a mild bitter chocolate flavor, mild roasted coffee, and a big alcohol burn that is hidden pretty well with all those big flavors.

A profound bitterness, with malt behind it. Just don't gulp it too soon. Full mouthfeel, well roasted though not burnt. Perhaps a quarter cup of the actual strong coffee. Not the best coffee I have tasted, and not the best imperial stout of so many good ones I have enjoyed of late.","Sammy","Apr 17, 2009"

Appearance is a deep black color, with a quick to form large tan heading, which just so happens to also be quick to fade, leaving a small ring around the glass. I like that it builds up and dies down quickly, I like it. Aroma is very pleasant. I get milk chocolate, an underlying coffee presence, and a sort of earth flavor that melds really beautifully with everything else. Really, the nose gets better and better, maybe that is because of the addition of the poop. Taste is not as astonishingly good as the smell unfortunately but still very tasty. I get burnt coffee beans, hint of earth, bitter chocolate and an aftertaste of marshmallow. Not especially heavy mouthfeel, in fact it feels rather light for the style. Alcohol is not noticeable at all. Where that 10.9% is, I do not know. After sort of disliking the Beer Geek Breakfast, my faith in Mikkeller has been restored with this brew.

My other typical concern with the style is that they all have the same heavy roast and cocoa flavors without much deviation.
