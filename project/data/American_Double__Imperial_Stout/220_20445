Taste is nearly identical to the smell, with lots of coffee up front, and a very slight pepper tone on the back end. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy - very nice.

So, unless there is milk in this brew (or, more imaginatively, had this been a milk stout rather than an imeperial) then what we have here is a misnomer. It's an espresso stout at best.

It has  a thicker and creamier light tan head which most of it burns off pretty quickly but does linger and leave some small sticky/soapy lacing. The aroma is pretty mild, with faint hints of coffee and alcohol. The taste is more stout that coffee, with the coffee taking a back seat to the robust stout flavors and earthy hops. The body is a little oily with a bit of an alcoholic tingle on the finish.","delta490","Feb 08, 2015"

Dark raisin toast and over ripe dark fruits are in the middle. Quite a departure from the aroma. Just enough bittering in the end. MF: semi sticky coats the mouth, but doesn't consume it.

3.85,-2,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Bomber poured into a Lagunitas mason jar glass (snagged two of these in Montana of all places). Pours a dark chocolate brown (near black) with around three fingers of tan creamy foam. Aroma is dark roast, earthy spice, and resinous hops right off the bat, with a whiff of sweet rum. Unique stout, this. Notably hop-forward, leaf and earth but little aggressive ashy character (a plus in my book). Getting some strong spicy notes that recall ginseng (read: dirt) and turmeric, along with the expected dark roast coffee, a little toffee or butterscotch, some assertive boozy flavors coming through. Any actual coffee flavor is nicely melded into the mix. This is not a particularly sweet stout. Nor is it particularly ashy or burnt. Really, and maybe I'm just strange, its the earthy and spicy hops coming forward, along with some chocolate and diacetyl that starts low key and slowly becomes more prominent over time. Low carbonation and mid-range body, not terribly thick. Finish is interestingly devoid of harsh bitterness but there is ample hop flavor and more roasted notes. A curious beer, this. Perhaps more to my liking than other coffee stouts that register more in the charred range.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 19, 2014"

Nice tan head that dies down to a thin layer of foam and tight beaded lacing. Color is a little odd for a stout, but still very nice. Smells of chocolate, strong coffee, and a hint of sweet cream and vanilla on the nose. Nice mouthfeel, thick and coating, with strong dark brewed coffee and bitter chocolate on the front with a light sweet vanilla taste in the background. An excellent stout.","Brutaltruth","Jun 29, 2014"

It poured a very appealing dark brown with a light tan head in a pint glass. It is a quite heavy beer, which is my preference, so I was very pleased with this beer.

Smell is of rich sweet malts and fresh roasted coffee. Taste is  started by a solid sweet malty front with a fresh coffee background. Roasted malts and dark chocolate round out the finish.

Dark roasted malt, sweet dark chocolate and roasted coffee aromas with sweet dark fruit notes at the end. Medium bodied with a  initially grainy feel that quickly transitioned to a viscous oily feel through the middle to the end. Sweet dark chocolate flavor quickly followed bt dark roasted malt. Bitter hop flavors through the middle that are intensified by bitter dark roasted coffee and charred malt flavors from the middle to the end.

I love this combination and it works well in this beer. The 9.2% ABV is up there in the imperial range - but you taste none of the alcohol. The low IBU keeps the hop bitterness in check.

In any case, I'll generally buy a good stout I've never seen before if I come across it since she likes them and it's a good excuse. She particularly likes stouts with coffee in them, so this was a no brainer. I'm really not a beer expert in the sense that I know what constitutes good ""mouthfeel"" or can detect notes of coriander. I just drink a crapload of beer. This is definitely one of the best I've had. I think the only one I like more is Founder's Breakfast Stout.

Aroma of bittersweet chocolate and coffee along with a distinct happiness. Cold coffee flavor with a fairly strong hop presence. The coffee and hops along with the hight alcohol lend an almost chili pepper flavor. For a beer called cappuccino stout I expect something more creamy. This beer is just too thin bodied. It's a nice coffee stout but it really needs more body.","adman08","Mar 30, 2014"

The nose is rather subdued, but what's there is coffee, roasted malts, and maybe a little bit of chocolate, if I strain really hard to get a third descriptor. It tastes of ground black coffee predominantly, with dark chocolate, some dark fruit qualities, and vanilla far in the background. There's an earthy hop bite and it has a medium mouthfeel. Lagunitas makes some great stuff and I love coffee stouts, but this comes as a disappointment. Not terrible though.","itsscience","Mar 29, 2014"

This is an excellent coffee stout - simultaneously bitter and sweet, with a light spiciness, and ridiculously easy to find just about anywhere around here. Definitely difficult to tackle a bottle all on your own, but can be easily split.

Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of coffee and dark/roasted malt notes with moderate hop presence; and good strength. Taste of roasted coffee, chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, brown bread, light roast, herbal, floral, light pine, and floral/roasted earthiness. Fair amount of floral/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of coffee, chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, brown bread, light roast, herbal, floral, light pine, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and coffee flavors with moderate hop presence; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice coffee stout. All around good balance and robustness of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 02, 2014"

It isn't a dense black body that I have become accustomed to. It stands it's own, don't get me twisted. I can recommend this but it falls short in comparison with other coffee stouts on the market.

The smell was dominated by a dark roast coffee. Taste backed up the smell with an earthy coffee taste as the primary flavor, with the taste waning a bit as it warmed. The beer was pretty thin in the mouth for such a strong coffee smell/taste, and felt even a bit acidic as it warmed up. Not a bad beer, but not nearly as good as others in it's class.","OneEye78","Feb 23, 2014"

I love coffee, and I love this beer so damn much it is the icing on the cake to what is already finely established with Guinness Beers but it adds just the extra kick that is needed for the tastes inbetween tastes. I found this at the store and I gobbled it up and bought out the store. Why? This is my hands down best tasting and expertly crafted beer I have ever tasted in my goddamn life, ever. This beats out Real Ale Coffee Porter, if the porter is a daily go to, this Stout is the grand mutha final boss. Why because it has the taste, AND the kick to whack some sense into ya. While the porter is like yeh expertly crafted coffee aftertaste. If i had to go to an island and i had to pick one thing. it would be a truckload of this beer in some forever ice cold fridge on some paradise island. End of story. Period.","FelixCat","Feb 15, 2014"

There is still a rather large coffee presence that does slightly overpower some of the more subtle notes, and the alcoholic vapors in the aftertaste are quite potent, but there’s still much in here to enjoy.","jondeelee","Sep 07, 2013"

It was big and bold with a good coffee flavor and a deep bittersweet chocolate malt on a full creamy body that was full and satisfying.

Overall a very nice brew and for a American Double/ Imperial Stout it does the job, with more Cappuccino flavor as it warms and a 9.20 ABV it's a solid choice and I will pick this up again.","Bear1964","Jun 02, 2013"

4.69,19.3,5,4,5,4.75,4.75,"generally, after i've overstuffed my gullet on a big meal of mashed potatoes, roasted asparagus, vinagretted salad, and (seemingly discordant) kimchi, followed by a course of various hard cheeses from spain and portugal, i binge further and help myself to a mugful of breyers vanilla icecream. i know there are better dessert options out there, but in terms of consistency and availability, said flavor really shines. what i do not want, historically, after giant dinners with menus akin to the one above described, is beer. enter lagunitas espresso stout, which breaks all precedent. i was full like thanksgiving, stuffed to the gills, but not ready to let the night end, and all out of breyers. so i reached into the cellar and withdrew this whopper (which, at $4.99 for twenty-two ounces, is among the best-priced beers on the market) from the cellar and pried off the cap. the first sip was a total knockout--terrifically bitter, but, beyond that, unbelievably complex. it poured handsomely with a short, dry head that dissolved quickly. i took my time drinking it, such that by the time i had an inch-or-so left in my collins glass, it was well warmed. hot coffee gone cold i find repulsively unenjoyable, but chilled espresso stout turned room temperature? outstanding. those final sips even tasted a bit like vanilla ice cream.","pacino77","May 10, 2013"

3.88,-1.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was an above average example of a Coffee Stout, it had all the aspects that I look for in the style but it didn't seem as robust and as well rounded as some of the best Coffee Stouts. This beer had decent drinkability, it wad fairly smooth and the flavors held my attention but the alcohol could have been hidden a little better, one bomber is enough for me and I wouldn't mind splitting it with someone. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, it looked pretty damn good in my snifter and it's one of the better looking Coffee Stouts I've seen. What I liked the least about this beer was that it was jut a little thin and the alcohol stuck out a little too much, I thought those aspects could use a little work. I would probably buy this beer again if in the mood since it was pretty nice and the price was very good, but it's not going to beat out Founders Breakfast Stout as my go to Coffee Stout for the season, If you like Coffee Stouts I recommend giving this a try. All in all this was a solid beer, and I expect nothing less from Lagunitas since they are a pretty good brewery and I've never had a beer from them I hated. It can't hang with the best of them but it's nice for what it is. Lagunitas makes good beers at great prices, cheers guys.","StoutHunter","Dec 21, 2012"

The nose comprises dark coffee, roasted malts, and toast. The taste brings in more of the same, with, unsurprisingly, the coffee taking center stage. Somehow, despite an even darker roast, the flavors never become too bitter or acrid, something I'd like to see happen more often. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a tasty, if a bit monomaniacal, coffee stout. 'Nuff said.","TMoney2591","Oct 31, 2012"

There is a nice fullness to the flavor without being overly thick in the mouthfeel. It still has a nice heft to it, but its smooth as can be without being overly creamy. The two major flavor combinations do very well together making for an excellent coffee stout, even if it isn't very complex. Its very drinkable and at 9% ABV, thats saying something. Good beer here, I definitely recommend if you like coffee stouts.","chodinheaven","Mar 09, 2012"

Coffee, malt, hops, and some chocolate are there- but not strong enough to get a higher score. The taste, fortunately, is a step up. Big malt, hops and chocolate on the first part, gradually turning into coffee and hops on the end of the taste. Nice creamer/hops aftertaste. I'd actually like the malt to have more presence on the back side for a slightly higher rating. The coffee isn't actually that present in the taste of this beer, and it actually works well. A lot of bad coffee stouts out there. Overall, this is a good beer that's worth trying if you like the style. I tend to like their hoppy beer a bit better, but this is a solid offering.

4.18,6.4,4,3.5,4.5,5,4,"Love Lagunitas, finally got around to trying this one. Pours a brownish red color. Aroma is of faint coffee. Taste is medium to heavy bodied, great mouthfeel to it. Nice hop taste on the tough, roasted coffee comes through strong, lots of roasted malts come through as well. Delicious beer, tons of taste and hides the ABV well. Glad I gave it a go, try it out for a good beer,","oriolesfan4","Oct 21, 2011"

3.92,-0.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Interesting beer. Not your typical coffee stout. With a name like ""Cappucino"" you expect a lot of milky creaminess and rounded, smooth coffee character. The coffee you get here is more a black roasted espresso flavor. Not much sweetness either. And frankly the roasted aspect isn't particularly strong when compared with other coffee stouts. It tastes good, though, and is worth a shot at the (usual) Lagunitas low price.","tobelerone","Oct 18, 2011"
3.88,-1.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Lagunitas beverages are usually big. Most I've reviewed have been something big and bold and wonderful and lingering. What we have here is a plate of pancakes with molasses all over and no butter. Smell was a little less that stellar, advertising winey and raisin notes, not coffee. Appeared as good as any quality stout. Little lace. Little light came through. Mouth is sweet, syrupy, with raisin and alcohol. Taste: see above. Actually, where's the coffee? The burnt malt and hops really don't make this all that bitter and maybe there's a hint of coffee in the back but it's muted. Overall, a really tasty imperial with a lasting sappy flavor.","Ricochet","Oct 15, 2011"
3.97,1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This pours a dark brown almost black color, but it lets a bunch light through, it has a large tan head which dissipates down to a film which remains for a long time. The smell is of coffee, espresso with a little roasted malts. The feel is medium. The taste is of espresso, a little dark chocolate, and some roasted malts. Overall this is a pretty good stout.","DavidST","Oct 04, 2011"
4.02,2.3,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall, a really good, almost great, stout. All the flavors played well together, and you know what you're getting from the way it smells. Also pretty darn good with fried chicken. Enjoy.","bogus564","Oct 01, 2011"

3.8,-3.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall-Like I always say, for the price and quality you can't ever go wrong with Lagunitas. With the intention of this being a coffee stout it definitely fit the mold, just a little bit boring after 12oz.","SWMeyer4141","Aug 24, 2011"
3.95,0.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"O: Very drinkable and I think some age would definitely help. A small sipper for an Imperial Stout. Would score higher with a better mouthfeel.","Dhren1979","Aug 14, 2011"

3.68,-6.4,2,4,4,3,3.5,"M - Thick and chewy like a good stout should be. Possibly over-bright carbonation that makes some of the flavors seem a little too sharp for my liking.","rundocrun","Aug 05, 2011"
3.98,1.3,4,3.5,4.5,3,4,"O: Great coffee-flavor stout. It wasn't too heavy for a summer evening and not too complex that it was overwhelming. Style wise, I think they did a good job. Would definitely get this again.","BrewCrew2010","Aug 01, 2011"
4.03,2.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"O. This is a pretty decent beer. It's nothing mind blowing. Tastes like a lot of similar coffee stouts. No extreme accents that made it stick out.

Smell is rich and full with aromas of chocolate, coffee, molasses, malt, and vanilla. Taste is bold and robust with flavors of coffee, coco, molasses, vanilla, and malt. Mouthfeel is very full and creamy, with a bit of a bite on the back of my tongue. This beer has good taste, lots of character, and a reasonable price. I will have another.","beerprovedwright","Jul 05, 2011"

3.83,-2.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This pours very dark brown with a nice tan head. There is some lacing and retention, but not a lot. The smell is strong caramel and sweet coffee. The taste is very dark and toasty. I would even call it woodsy and smoky. There is a heavy body here that limits your intake, and the syrupy sweetness also doesn’t help the drinkability. This is a solid stout, but not my usual style.","beerdown77","Jun 19, 2011"

4.15,5.6,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours a semi-opaque dark brown with a 2 inch tan head that fades to a thin cap. Fat rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smells of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and espresso grounds. Taste is of rich dark chocolate covered espresso beans and roasted dark malts. A slight cocoa/espresso bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a bit of a thin body with a good level of carbonation that makes for a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good coffee/espresso infused stout from Lagunitas. I tried a bottle of this a while back and I didn't like it from what I remember but this bottle was very good. For the price this is a great beer and an easy decision to make when you want a tasty brew for little money.","UCLABrewN84","May 29, 2011"

4,1.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Try it on tap, if you can.","OBeerMeGreatOne","May 17, 2011"
3.68,-6.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall- I’m not sure if this is a stout or an ale, for a stout there is not a whole lot going on, but for an ale it has nice flavours although coffee really dominates all aspects of this one. For coffee lovers this would be an amazing brew for you, but for me this fell a little short of what I was expecting this to be. I would have liked to see more of a sweet cappuccino taste as opposed to the strong almost bitter coffee grinds taste that I got out of this one. All in all a more average brew that I would definitely not go out of my way to acquire, but at the cheap five dollar price point for a bomber it is a good bang for your buck and a higher ABV well hid by all the coffee flavours.","Roke87","May 06, 2011"
4.03,2.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"O: This is a stout for people who drink their coffee as a shot of espresso. There is no creamy flavors or textures. Its pretty good","kevanb","May 06, 2011"

3.95,0.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"If Lagunitas ever needs a Canadian ambassador for their brands, I'm officially calling dibs. Consider me the regional president of the fan club. This brewery seems to turn out nothing but winners and, although their specialty lies in making uber-hoppy offerings, this coffee stout is a respectably solid delve into the dark side and is every bit on the level with their usual standards of quality, value and delicious quaffability.","biegaman","May 05, 2011"
4.12,4.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Super dark brown. Almost black. Very thick with a nice creamy head that fades fast but leaves nice lace. The smell is of roasted coffee, sweet malts, caramel, dark chocolate, and toffee. Earthy citrus peeks through and some dark fruit notes are in there as well. The taste is of sweet malty honey and caramel with a good dose of roasted coffee, char, and a touch of smoke. Good earthy notes througout with a touch of citrus. An overall good and easy to drink stout.","JayS2629","Apr 29, 2011"
4.05,3.1,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"O- A great beer, one of the better coffee flavored stouts I've had, the flavors all work very well together and the 8.8% ABV is nearly invisible.","WillCarrera","Apr 29, 2011"
4.09,4.1,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall, what we liked most about this brew was how bold the coffee aroma and flavoring was. Of the two the nose produced the most robust aspect of tasting, with bold coffee bean scents crashing throughout, but not overwhelmingly so. The tastes followed through nicely, and this brew stayed true to its name, with a bold coffee kick, and a smooth creaminess, just like a proper cappuccino should be.","TheBrewo","Apr 28, 2011"

A very nice beer once again from this very solid brewery.","jwhancher","Apr 28, 2011"
3.98,1.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"poured into a pint glass a dark dark brown almost black. had a one finger khaki colored head that quickly disappeared. smells of strong burnt slightly smokey coffee. tastes like it smells with sweet malts. mouthfeel is thin (i like my stouts thicker) good carbonation and goes down easy. worth every penny.","match1112","Apr 27, 2011"

4,1.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a very dark brown with a small tan head. Smells of coffee and dark chocolate with earthy undertones. Mouthfeel is very light with slight carbonation. The taste is not what I expected. I can taste the dark chocolate and almost a date or fig flavor. I taste a trace amount of coffee on the finish, but not that of my expectations. Still a very nice beer that I will have again.","buyBinboaVodka","Apr 20, 2011"

3.97,1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"22oz bottle. Pours a dark, dark brown color with a thin layer of tan head. Strong aroma of cappuccino/coffee. Somewhat earthy but mostly a big wallop of coffee beans. Smells strong. Big cappuccino taste. Roasted malts, somewhat sweet with a bitter dark coffee aftertaste. Maybe a bit of vanilla or cream perhaps. Not too boozey but its a heavy mouthfeel and lots of coffee flavor so this one will take awhile to finish. Doesn't really have the typical Lagunitas big hoppy and sweet flavors, although it is somewhat sweet. Overall its a solid choice. I may be interested in aging one to see if it mellows out the big coffee taste. I will look for this again.","PicoPapa","Apr 13, 2011"
3.97,1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Lagunitas is making quality stouts??? Huh? They actually executed this one quite well, but I wouldn't call it a stout based on the look and flavor. Perhaps ""Dubbel Cappucino"" would've suited this better.","aficionado","Apr 13, 2011"
4.53,15.3,4.5,4,5,4,4.5,"O/D - Pleasently drinkable... being that it is of a lower ABV for its class... i would have to say it makes it that much more drinkable in a sense that you CAN drink more then one. roasted to perfection, i would want to take this to work with me in my mug anyday...","IIKaRuII","Apr 10, 2011"
4.08,3.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout pours with a black colour and a 1cm tan head that lasts well. It smells very malty with some coffee character.

There are hits of vanilla and chocolate as well. Finish is toasty and has a bitter chocolate aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit thick with moderate carbonation. Very smooth and velvet like. Sits soft on the palate. Very nice mouthfeel. All in all its a very tasty coffee stout. Although a bomber is as much as I can have. Its high in flavor and alcohol. At 8.8 ABV.

The smell caught my attention immediately and gave me some notes of a dark roasted coffee to start with. The first sip hits you hard with the coffee but then rounds off to the malt side of this beer. Malt flavors of chocolate, molasses, and some light fruitiness keep it fairly well balanced. The carbonation may be a touch to much on this one though but not to the extent of ruining this beer.

There are extremely heavy coffee ground smells, specifically the grounds after the coffee has been brewed. Smells delicious. The beer is initially nondescript in mouth when you first take a sip. It lingers for a second, and then BAM! you get the coffee flavors. Bitter, dark, roasted coffee, with a slightly sweet, malty backbone that does well to balance the flavor without influencing it too much. If you like coffee, you are going to love this beer. I hate coffee, and I actually like this beer. The beer is a bit on the dry side, and crisp, which goes well with the flavor characteristics. The aftertaste is all coffee, and despite the body, the finish lingers for a bit in mouth, just like a cup of coffee will. It never overpowers, despite the strong flavors and the lingering finish. Very easy to drink, and great on a cold night when the wind is a whippin. Very decent stout.","GarthDanielson","Feb 15, 2011"

On the nose it lacks the very astringent, day-old coffee note that kills Bell's Java Stout and Dark Horse Perkulator for me, so that's a plus. It's actually a pretty subtle nose for a coffee stout. Obviously coffee is present but it's deep down, among vanilla and other stuff. The Bros mentioned blood oranges, and I think I get that, too. It's a subtle bouquet but it's a very good one. On the tongue the coffee stands out more than on the nose and the other stuff gets lost a bit, but there is a hop presence that makes itself known. In the mouth it isn't a huge bodied beer and there is a nice prickly, carbonation + coffee + slight alcohol effect that lingers. It's pretty drinkable for a big stout.

It smells thinly of cappucino and generic malt, however the cappucino/coffee aroma is strong enough to make the smell generally pleasant. The problem with the taste of this beer is that all of it's flavors are too weak. Stronger taste of roast/malt, hops, or coffee/cappucino would make this a much better example of a strong coffee stout. As it stands, all three of these major style flavors come across evenly and weakly.

Alas, I should have known better to go with Lagunitas, a West-coast brewery that invests more in label copy than beer. Although a suitable color for a stout, it's got very little aroma beyond some light chocolate and a peas. The taste is loaded-- *loaded*-- with old coffee grounds. Not even good coffee grounds, but the kind from the Bunn-O-Matic you used to operate in your high-school job at a Ponderosa Steak House; the kind that have been sitting around for hours, drying out and getting sour. Also making a cameo appearance is... lettuce. Unless that's a flavor you value in beer, pass on this one.","gfreed","Jan 23, 2011"

The mouthfeel is a bit too light for the style. There's a bit of body but I like my doubles to really coat the mouth.

I am certainly no coffee expert, but is the name on the bottle influencing me into thinking the coffee flavor is a bit different? I've probably only had 3 cappuccinos in my life and two of those were probably from a gas station coffee machine. Maybe it is the hops, because Lagunitas loaded this beast up with plenty. The body is really not all that full, and I find the alcohol every bit the 9.26% it claims...and then some. I do not find this to be one of my favorite releases from the crew in Petaluma, but I like it enough to buy one more to see what happens in the cellar.

The flavor is very similar, and leading the way is what reminds me of a excellently made Mocha. Fresh ground espresso mixed with Ghiridelli chocolate powder and fresh sweet cream. Also a bit of hazelnut comes through. It kind of reminds me of Nutella with coffee. The mouthfeel is nice and oily, coating the mouth with a nice coffee flavor.

Mild coffee and roasted barley in the nose. In the taste is more supreme coffee, roasted coffee beans and a burnt bitterness in the finish.

There is definitely a hop presence in this beer, but is well hidden by bitter fresh espresso quality. The full, bread-like texture presents the well integrated, but warming alcohol aspect. The beer drinks well from beginning through the long finish, but I really should have had this beer for breakfast as opposed to an after dinner drink. The reason I say that is because I get a caffine kick from this beer....just don't tell the FDA.

Taste is also average: dark chocolate, maybe a little hazelnut, pretty sweet, alcohol occasionally peeks through; there's a slight hint of coffee / cappucino that comes through in the finish. Kind of tastes like a sweet stout to me. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, nearly full-bodied, with perhaps a little too much carbonation. Its pretty drinkable, but kind of boring.

4.04,2.8,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Aggressive pour just gets half a finger of cream brown foam, this dissolving down to the thinnest coating possible, lacing pretty much out of the question. It's pretty murky rather than pitch black, dark brown at the core taking on a yellow cast further out. Curiously, it's the grapey plum, cherry fruit that you notice first in the nose before the rich coffee grounds, malt, mocha, butterscotch scents spread wide, some sweet scone notes, black licorice, over time a banana edge comes out with sweet baking spices. Full-bodied without a great deal of heaviness, the carbonation as well as generally firm mouth feel ensures that it moves pretty nimbly. The licorice and ginger, cinnamon spice stronger here, as if you're drinking infused coffee - once that coffee, mocha, caramel hits the set it moves more towards a traditional center. Grape, apricot, cherry, pear fruit, an enjoyable mixture. While not bitter, does stiffen towards the end, a welcome textural change.

The chocolatey cappucino flavors were good, but they didn't feel like they came close to reaching their full potential. And the citrusy hops just didn't help matters, in my opinion.

The brew poured to a dark brown color which was very surprising since this brew is suppose to be a stout. The head as not overly that large and had a real light light tan color. The retention was not that great though what was there id leave some lacing. The aroma has a nice solid coffee aroma that has some coffee highlights and seems to be anchored by a hefty alcohol scent. The flavor at first gives me the impression that the coffee flavors are going to be a little harsh but that thought quickly fades. The coffee flavors are clearly dominant here while being quite smooth. Flavors that I am also getting is chocolate but plays a minor part. Seems to have an ample hopping that I think comes out in the end as there is a nice bitterness, either that or it is from the coffee flavors but I don't think so as it seems to be a little citric. For being a +8% brew the alcohol in the flavor is very well hidden though it does come out a little more as this one warms. I understand that this brew is labeled as a stout but does not seem to have the viscosity that you normally see in this type, seems to lead to a slightly watery feel, though the overall flavors trump that.

The first impression with the taste is sweet coffee with roasted malted barley followed by a somewhat bitter aftertaste (similar to coffee) and a throat-warming alcohol sensation. It's got a nice thick creamy texture and moderate carbonation. Too heavy to drink in any quantity but this 22 ounce bottle is a great start to the beer drinking day.","berserker256","Feb 18, 2009"

I like coffee & I like beer, though the balance seems to be off with too much coffee flavor. A toffee-like finish is noticeable after several seconds. In addition to this, a coffee ground taste was prevalent. Not so drinkable in my opinion. The coffee used didn't seem to be of high quality and was very acidic. The bitterness might be more due to the coffee and its poor quality than from the hops utilized in brewing the beer. Though the beer balances out better with time, I still found it to be too overwhelmed by coffee and isn't something I would personally seek out again.","melagnus","Jan 25, 2009"

There is no cappuccino or coffee flavoring that is noticable. Given that this is a Cappuccino stout, the lack of flavoring on the coffee/cappucino side highly disappointing.

Flavor has a much bigger coffee presence, a little bit of chocolate and cream, almost like coffee flavored ice cream. Dark fruits are showing up in the flavor, but there's a light sour aspect to them. Could this be a bad bottle? There is also a light citic hop note in the background. Slightly sweet at first but a dry, earthy finish. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, average carbonation. I'm not so sure about this one. Not the color, nose or flavor profile that I look for in a stout, let alone a coffee stout, especially one that sits at 8.29% ABV. I was a bit let down by this brew.

I think what makes the coffee blend in so well with the base beer is the low hopping (30IBUs) and use of crystal malts.

A decent head that stuck around for a minute, minor lacings. The smell is dominated by the coffee malt (it is a cappucino stout, after all), so it is not bad but not intricate. However, the brew is also dominated bythe coffee malt and it is great. The body is medium to full and slightly syrupy, but this stout is coffeeish and a tad sweet with no drying out of the tongue by the malt. One of the smoothest stouts I've ever had. Can't desribe it too much more, I mean there might be caramel or honey in there that would account for the texture and sweetness I picked up, and it isn't like the hop presence is real noticeable.

As a lover of both good beer and good coffee, I really like coffee stouts if they are done well, which they are usually not. This one was far to bright and acidic tasting for a stout; not a lot of roasty or creamy flavors, just a lot of acidity from the Columbian coffee, probably in conjunction with citrusy American hops. The choice of coffee might be the problem here; a darker roast like a french or espresso roast usually translate better to stouts. Overall I'd avoid this one.","Sconnie","Apr 11, 2008"

Always good reading, especially after two or three glasses of the stuff. Poured into my glass a lovely ebony hue, with a great, healthy looking bed of light brown/off red head. Lacing is spotty but thick. Delicious looking. Aroma at first struck me with sweet coffee, or damp cardboardish vanilla like notes. Unexpected, this. I mean after that and as the beer warmed I got some extremely sweet coffee notes, but the initial hit was a tad...underwhelming, shall we say. Pretty one-sided coffee/root beer aroma, but that's to be expected...or is it? Again a strange herbal tinge as I take the first sip. Almost medicinal, like a brief hint of Jagermeister or something. Good news is this a tasty coffee beer. The coffee taste is not souring or distracting, but rather complementing. Not the best I've tasted, but good. Decent bitterness and actually, conversely, a deep maple syrup finish. There isn't a hell of a lot else to describe in the taste. But it gets the job done. Mouthfeel was a little lacking, seemingly due to not enough carbonation for me personally. Drinkability? I'm the wrong person to ask, because coffee stouts/porters have never been my preferred style.

Smell was of creamy milk chocolate, bitter burnt coffee, sweet roasted/toasted malts. A bit of toffee and caramel round out the nose nicely. Huge coffee and sweet chocolate hit the tongue first, with some roasted malts, and more caramel and toffee. Just a bit of dark fruit is buried in the background.

The taste is really good with a very thick and rich base of roasted malts and layering flavors of chocolate, coffee, and sugar.

The smell was a mixture of roasted barley and subtle coffee notes. The taste was similar to the smell, but had a slight alcohol aftertaste. Neither the coffee nor the roasted malts stood out in this brew making it seem like the flavors did not blend well. The flavor is average for any other coffee stout I have had, the boost of alcohol makes it a different stout but the flavors were not powerful enough to overcome the taste of the added octane.

Strong roasted malts up front, followed by a good amount of chocolate, and then ending with a light creamy coffee/cappuccino flavor. The flavor is quite enjoyable, but again, not like I expected from a stout labeled as a ""cappuccino stout."" Thick mouthfeel coats the inside of the mouth, leaving a thick aftertaste. Decent flavor, slightly above average abv., and good mouthfeel, make this an enjoyable and drinkable stout.

There is a very nice aroma, chocolate and coffee both being prominent. There is an appropriately thick and silky mouthfeel, but the carbonation is slightly prickly. I get quite a bit of the hops up front, a touch of citrus, but really more grassy. There is some chocolate flavors toward the middle and then bang, the coffee comes in hard. I find a lot of coffee beers taste like green pepper to me, thankfully, this one does not. Very good. Definitely worth a try.","Drew966","Nov 25, 2007"

The taste is just as advertised. Very strong cappuccino flavor that is actually better than I had expected. That dandelion character is in there as well, and I find that to be enjoyable too. Sweeter up front and then finishes with a pretty strong coffee/baker's chocolate bitterness. The alcohol is imperceptible behind all this flavor.

Creamy and smooth, carbonation is subtle and spot-on for the body. Malty and chocolatey sweet with bitterness coming at the finish from a combo of scorched malts, coffee and hops. Very nice but a little sweeter than I expected. Further character develops as it warms, and the coffee and chocolate become more pronounced.

Poured surprisingly light-coloured for a stout; a clear deep reddish brown. Small head, even at near-room temperature. Not a lot of aroma, but definitely some coffee in there, as well as something sweeter like cotton candy or caramels. Taste is surprisingly sweet; this almost seems like a milk stout rather than a more traditional stout; reminds me a lot of Dragon Stout.

Some leafy hops are there and are blended in quite nicely; sweet chocolate and some more roasty-malts come to the fore-front. There is a bitter sweetness towards the finish, and the alcohol is completely masked. Finishes a bit chalky and dry, but has some great notes.

It's thick and creamy on the tongue with a lasting finish, very well balanced sweet and bitter. It's pretty filling, so I couldn't drink much of it, though I'd want to.

Creamy malts surround the tongue mid-palate; then the hops come out toward the end, as well as warming alcohol. Throughout, all the flavors are integrated very well, with none overpowering the others. The alcohol level and coffee bitterness contribute to a mouthfeel that's a little rough.

Black malt and light toasted cocoa aromas up front; further sniffing reveals a husky grain scent along with subtle coffee notes. The coffee is far more apparent in the taste, which begins with toasted grain traits, then moves to a chocolate-vinous middle which is subsequently overwhelmed by a significantly bitter, almost acrid, and deep dark-roasted coffee flavor. This coffee aspect near the end is punctuated by spicy alcohol notes (damn near 8% abv shows just a bit, but not in an unpleasant way), and lasts quite a while in the aftertaste. Some mellow pine-flavored hops populate the burps. By and large, the mouthfeel is on the creamy side, with an occasional appearance of alcohol astringency and an off-dry finish. Not the roastiest of stouts, but certainly the most coffee-flavor I've had in a beer that I can remember. Bigger than your average stout, but far from ""Imperial"".

It was a stout balanced midway between sweet and bitter extremes, and finished with a hop flourish that rode atop some alcohol warmth. Apart from the absence of vinousness this was an archetypal flavor profile. As it warmed, the beer turned a little prickly and astringent due to the presence of real strong coffee, which made the mouthfeel a touch more jagged than I prefer.

A deep inhalation reveals notes of dilute mocha and floral hops. Tame in coffee character, but innocuous overall aromawise. In flavor, the initial surge of burnt barley and charcoal bitterness is immediately superceded by a pleasant, albeit one - dimensional milk chocolate sweetness. The coffee presence is present at a low level throughout, and contribute only a subtle, but rounded smoky and tannic notion that complements the residual, molasses - like malt sweetness. Thin in body, and approaching brown ale - like in that regard. Constant hop bitterness melds well with coffee tannins, and provides a bitterness that offsets residual sugar aptly. Finishes abruptly yet warm, with quickly fleeting notes of dry baker's cocoa and ethanol. A relatively enjoyable stout all around.

Rich, semi-sweet chocolate smells are most prevalent with just a bit of coffee and roast. Taste is dominated by dark malt flavor, mostly semi-sweet chocolate flavors with a bit of dark chocolate bite. Cappuccino flavors mix in throughout alongside a mild roastiness. Anyway, the flavor is fantastic, maybe not as filled with coffee as expected, but still a very rich and flavorful combo. Only the 7.9% hampers the drinkability.

The body begins to gain that heft that I had been wishing for earlier; this beer definitely would benefit being served initially at about 56°F (13°C). Throughout the process of drinking this beer there is that backdrop of roasted character, which does dominate the flavor profile.

Alcohol is notiacble, but not overpowering. Thick flavors of cream, chocolate and toasty malt. No cappuccino/coffee noticable, but adds to the milky texture. Coating mouthfeel, but not too heavy. Alcohol is well disguised. A pretty good beer, but nothing too exciting. The coffee component is not strong enough, IMO. The creamy texture is a nice diversion from those dry stouts.
