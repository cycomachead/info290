"This beer is way overrated IMO. Too boozy with no depth of flavor. Glad I didn't pay $30 for it. It was a gift."

"0- Just fantastic! Alcohol is completely hidden in a nice sweet caramelly blanket that coats your tongue and slips away un-noticed. Glad I have one more...."

"2012 bottling. Not as good as the buffalo trace i just had. But definitely good. And did have a different flavor"

"Rich and chocolatey. Warming and smooth. Lots of vanilla and oak. A little thin however."
""
""
""
"I guess if I have a complaint, it's that the brew comes across very, very smooth, but not particularly deep or complex. I would love a slightly stronger stout base for the brew; the barrel character in this one is very well integrated, but I don't get as nuanced or complex a flavor profile as I do in FW brews or BCBS."
""
"Really interesting beer, has Big, bold, roasty, malt flavors one excepts from a BA stout such as chocolate and coffee, as well as an equal dose of raisins, caramel and vanilla, to almost comes off as a cross between a barley wine and a stout. Seriously awesome beer."
""
""
"Not as good as expected"
"Awesome stout!  Tons of bourbon on the nose. Maybe a little thin to me but excellent overall!"

"2012 bottle, bourbon flavor was retained nicely. Not too thing, not overly viscous.  I was very happy with this bottle and hope to try it fresh someday."

"The most amazing stout I have ever had in my life. A must have before you die."
""

"Reminds me of black note. Smooth and mellow"

"This is a great beer. As it warms the smells and tastes inrease dramatically. Lots of vanilla, bourbon, lil oak, dark chocolate. Lots Of SOY sauce flavor.  Pairs excellent with aged sharp Chedder ,older the better also a stilton would be good. This is also went good with a dark chocolate particularly one with almonds toffee caramel. Great pairing beer. Not worth the price though 32.99."

""
"one of the best beers I have tried in the last year."

"Not the best Eclipse variant I've ever had, but it's still a really well done barrel aged stout."
"This is very light in comparison to the 4 roses variant."

"Pours beautiful. Nice creamed coffee color head that stays around for a good while before dissipating to a nice sticky lace. Initial smell and you can really pick up the aromas that the quality of the Elijah Craig barrel gives. At first glance it appears as it would be thicker on the mouthful than it is but that said, the non-syrupy feel actually works perfectly with the quality of the bourbon as it allows the flavors to come through without the viscosity getting in the way. There's a great balance between the slight sweetness of a barrel aged stout and the dark, toasty flavors of dark chocolate, coffee and oak tannins from the barrel.  Very smooth. Overall this is very well done and worthy of the praise they receive. Definitely worth the price to try at least once."
"I like this beer, but I can't say it lives up to its price point."

"Uber sweetness takes over in the taste profile, it's hard to get past the sugars here. Bourbon taste is heavy- really good BA brew here - only knock on this is the price point."

"Let's start with- this is an extremely well made beer. That said, it didn't blow me away like some other bourbon barrel beers have, especially for the price. I actually preferred the four roses to this one. My problem is that it just has way too much of a caramel note to it from the whiskey barrel. Too sweet, and to cloying- like caramel corn. That just makes the beer too heavy and one dimensional for me. I'm still enjoying it, but I wouldn't buy it again."

"D: Not my fav BA stout and it comes with a bit of sticker shock but still a very good one at that and worth checking out for sure. Starts off big and thick with a saving grace of hop bitterness to it. I would say the barrel notes seem pretty mellow here and I am not certain I could differentiate between the other variants without a proper side by side. I am up for the challenge however."

"Medium bodied with low carbonation. Silky, creamy, and very easy to drink. Well worth trying if you get the chance."
"Overall good, still very strong with the booze and fruits which I figured would have been long gone sixteen months later"

"O - What this beer lacks in depth and layering it makes up for due to its remarkable poise. It hides its abv. wonderfully; I have never had such a strong beer with so little heat. Put simply this is a beer with sweet, mellow-bourbon flavours in which all the elements are beautifully harmonized. Perhaps the first beer I've head where the overall score is higher than any of the constituent scores. Very,very good."

"Just a terrific job here fifty-fifty. It's a little on the expensive side, but still well worth it in my book."
""
""
""
"Overall: I would definitely but this in the world class BA stout category. The lighter body give it a very different drinkability but in no way is a negative in the long run. The barrel character is absolutely top notch. I bought a bottle of Elijah Craig 12yr bourbon at the same time as this bottle and I hope it packs this type of punch as well."

"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of bourbon and rich black chocolates is very soothing. Taste is also dominated rich black chocolate notes with some medium bourbon notes with really rounds off the rough or bitter edge of the base stout. Body is full with nice oily and creamy texture with good carbonation with alcohol not that apparent in this version."
"O - How this sells is beyond me. Such a ripoff. I was hoping this highly rated version would be good. Incorrect. BCBS destroys this on every level at half the cost (if your store marks it up) or 1/3 the cost at reasonable prices. Drinking this makes no sense. It's a decent tick, but that's it. Don't recommend buying any of the eclipse beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"IN CONCLUSION - I'd say it's worth it if you really care about trying different kinds of beer. Maybe it's just the mystery of what a 30 dollar beer really tastes like, but I had to get this out of my system to be satisfied. And in addition, I could probably never get an elijah craig barrel to age an imperial stout in, and that's assuming I could make an imperial stout this good in the first place, which I haven't had the patience to do yet. I wouldn't buy it again, but I'm glad I got it to try just once."

"Elijah Craig (12 Year) from the FiftyFifty Brewing Co. was the first of the Eclipse series I have sampled to date. Although this beer was quite interesting and surprisingly drinkable, I was anticipating something a bit more remarkable for my $30."
"The flavor is exquisite. Notes of chocolatey fudgy syrup with some nice caramel and molasses barrel notes. Slight vanilla spice, mixed in with the cocoa notes. The beer is very rich and complex with delicious mix of chocolate, both dark and milk, and some nice roasted notes complimented by delicious barrel sweentess. Mouthfeel is nice and thick with some mild carbonation to keep it in balance."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very nice BA stout. Combines some of my favorite characteristics of a big stout and a nice bourbon. Other than the price point, this brew is a home run."
"Bottle poured aggressively down the middle into a concave pint. Happy Super Bowl Sunday! Extremely creamy and frothy head 2 inches tall and then settling in nicely. Leaves tremendous lacing after each sip. Nose is subtle at first but then breathe in once more and oh my! Chocolate and the slightest back hints of bourbon. Other stouty flavors abound as well. Nice! Taste is superb. Not heavy chocolate in the finish but just thin malty sweet goodness that lasts on the tongue. The bourbon flavor creeps in the back end quite nicely as well. You want more after each sip. At this point it's aged well so dare I say I want to session this?!"
""
""
""
"Probably my favorite Eclipse of the night because I truly recognize the EC12 feel. I love that ""in your face"" Bourbon character of Elijah Craig and the dilution into this stout works out pretty well. Still wish the base stout had more character but I can appreciate this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer promises lots of rich and complex flavor, and boy does it deliver. Not for the light of heart, but one of the best beers I've ever had. Pricey at $30 a bottle, but definitely worth trying. Excited to try the java variant in the coming weeks."

"O: Not as good as the EC 20, Four Roses or Rittenhouse, but still an eclipse, still aged in the barrels of excellent whiskey, and still delicious."
""
"I'm not sure if this is better than the Heaven Hill Rittenhouse Rye, but it's approximately as good. The stout base is great, with a ton of chocolate, and the bourbon is nice. This is definitely a nice sipper."
" The Rittenhouse Rye managed to blend better, but the whiskey here is stupid smooth and easy going."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: expensive but worth it, this is an unbelievably tasty beer. Definitely belongs in the top tier of Bourbon Barrel Aged Stouts. I have another of these celaring and am debating going back to the store to see if any is left."
""
""
"O - Well, I did it. Perfect 5s. I've never had the pleasure of having this fresh but the year and half put on this has put it in a class of its own. This is truly sublime and a masterpiece. The price point is pretty insane but after tasting this I can almost justify it. Just perfect!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is an interesting experience. You taste the bourbon in this one more than most in the style, I appreciate that a lot. As a whole, this makes me think of a more bourbon-forward Event Horizon. The only problem that that is that EH is less than half the price of this. If you are really into bourbon I can certainly see having a high appreciation for this series. In the end though, I would have a hard time justifying a repeat purchase given the price tag."
"I am not at all versed in the spirituous offerings of one Elijah Craig, so all I can discern from this offering is that it is one pleasantly understated example of a Bourbon County staple, based on the thorough, yet inoffensive effects rendered herein. The base RIS is only mildly altered, I presume, and the overall experience is quite agreeable enough - tasty, full, and sweet to a point that dessert pairing is hardly out of the question."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"everything I've had from the Eclipse series has been great and perhaps the number of reviews has gotten this one in particular on to the top 250 but I don't think its my personal favorite even though its awesome."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'd say I went into this with high expectations. They were met, but just barely. This could have been better for being 99/100 and 100/100. I'd give it more of a 95/100. Extremely balanced, very drinkable, well-rounded overall. Just doesn't give that extra flavor-punch to push it over the edge. For $30/bottle I might not get this again, but certainly enjoyed the bottle, and it would be a staple if it were more around $18 or so."
""
""
""
"Overall- Good to really good beer, mostly good. Definitely worth a try but if the 28 dollar price tag makes you pause, you are correct in your concern. I will not be buying it again."
""
"O- Very well done and tasty. I am still not sure if I would pick up again because it is pricey."
""
"Overall drinkable at 9.5, my advice is to age, but what do I know. Cheers."

"High B-"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As far as how the Elijah Craig is different, it's smoother, more singular on the palate (likely from age), as the licorice notes have made room for vanilla and cocoa."
""
""
""
"Thanks for bringing this one, Shaun. This is the first 50/50 Eclipse beer I've ever had, and after this one I kind of want to see what else is out there from that same brewer. Well-done, very well-constructed and nicely chocolatey with a good mix of bourbon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste starts out with a thick roasted/burnt malt flavor with a bit of a char aspect, the bourbon kicks in but after four years of age the burn has mellowed, molasses and dark fruit in the aftertaste, big thick chewy body that is hampered by a very low almost flat carbonation, not quite Lost Abbey bad but enough to hurt it from being excellent on all fronts."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest to low level of carbonarion. It is earthen and very boozy but still shows the alcohol vibrantly with a little barrel presence. It is quite good and 4 years in the bottle has hardly mellowed this out but it has a soft amount of oxidation present."
""
"Overall, this may have been a touch too heavy in the bourbon. Then the coconut came on strong without a balance of vanilla. As always though, it's more a matter of personal taste."
"O: The sum of all its parts make this beer excellent. Great bourbon character, rich dessert notes of chocolate, caramel, vanilla and marshmallow (mocha as well), and a silky smooth and creamy body without much alcohol burn make this one really nice."

"O - My first Eclipse and I can't wait to try more! This beer reminded of me of Goose Island Bourbon County Stout, which is to say damn good! A strong beer but the alcohol is relatively well hidden. I really like the chocolate and relative lack of alcohol. It's there but not over the top. Cheers!"

"A marvelous imperial stout. Was it worth $26.99? Honestly, I've had better examples for half that price or even less. Still, if you're into aging imperial stouts for a very long time, this is a good investment. I bought this bottle back in December of 2012 and it's been in the fridge since. I do want to try the other varieties available. If you're a fan of imperial stouts and want something different, check this out."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the nicer Eclipse variants. This one is a bit heavy on the wood with lots of charred oak. I'll have to try this one fresh sometime, I wonder if the bourbon has faded a bit - this is definitely the oldest eclipse I've had (at least 18 months old now I'm guessing). Strong in the aroma but not as strong as some of the fresher variants I've had. Hard to say. Still quite good, don't get me wrong but it makes me wonder."
""
""
""
""
"O: It's a very very good barrel aged stout, but not among the best I've had. I am glad I got to try it though! (I will be sticking to Parabola, which is cheaper and easier to obtain for me)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is an excellent beer, but its not as good as the 2011 FiftyFifty EC 18yr I had a little while back. That being said the EC 18 was one of the best beers Ive ever had. This one, although still great, had noticeably less barrel notes, and less of the chocolate fudge/cake batter sweetness that I got in the 2011 EC 18 (same base beer I believe so not sure what the difference was, different vintage, different batch, more time?). That being said, still a hell of a beer. Glad I got to try this one. Thanks again fatbeats for sending it my way!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Even though it was against my better judgement I acquired a bottle of this. I heard the EC 12 year was one of the best eclipses so I dropped an unseemly amount of money for a bomber ($24). I had this feeling all along it wasn't going to be worth the money since Parabola is only $15 and I was proven right. Dark black beer, super healthy head. Aroma is mild bourbon, and then I get notes of honey, not bad. Flavor was mostly bourbon, wood, more booze, touch of honey. I was really hoping for some chocolate or vanilla or coconut flavors but I got none. I suspected this beer was overpriced and now I feel vindicated. Caveat emptor. I sort of wish I had just bought two bottles of older viscosity instead. :("

"Overall a very easy drinking bourbon barrel aged beer. The bourbon barrel aging is perfectly combined with the base stout."
""
""
""
"O: This is another great variant from 50/50. I did prefer the slight spiciness and barrel character of the Rittenhouse Rye version but this one is very solid."
""
""
""
""
"D - Great barrel aged stout. The bourbon is very present, but very smooth and balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall its a darn tasty beer, but, for the money or going trade rate there are other damn good bourbon aged stouts for a fraction of the cost of one of these. Glad I got to try it."
"Overall - Similar to the Elijah Craig 20, without quite that great barrel character."
"smooth, refined, everything i would expect from this style, but a bit subdued on the front. the finish lingers long after you're done with that sip (it's a sipper, most definitely) and make me think of something subtly smoky/spicy. a unique, and very tasty, interpretation of the style."
""
""
""
""
"This is well-balanced for as bourbon forward as it is. This is one of the best bourbon-barrel aged beers I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Full bodied, milder carbonation, creamy, sticky and smooth on the tongue. It's a toss up between this and the EC 20 year for my favorite Eclipse treatments, both of which have a substantial leg up on the others I've tried. These probably aren't worth the $30 tag they fetch in Philly, but I still seem to keep buying them."
""
""
"O - Excellent. Could actually taste the specific 'Elijah Craig' bourbon (which I enjoy). Flavors were blended superbly. A thin layer of head remained throughout entire brew- very impressed. Only downside was the nose- it was rather minor. With all these excellent flavors- I hoped for something really dank. But...at a $24 price tag- with so many incredible BA stouts out there- i can't say I would 'highly' recommend the purchase."

""
""
""
"I liked the 2012 version of this beer more than the 2011 even though it was hotter. I thought the depth of flavor was better in the 2009 version."
""
"O- Overall a massive brew to tackle with lots of flavors going on at once. Extremely complex and has a fuller bourbon flavor than some of the others which makes sense given the amount of time the liquor has spent in that barrel."
""
""
""
""
"O) This is very good. I like the booziness of this as the bourbon really does stand out. What is scary though is that this is easily drinkable. As this warms starting to get some more flavors such as plum. This will be savored. Glad I have another bottle!"
""
""
""
"2012 vintage. Pours an average Eclipse color...black, and this one has a nicely sized tan head that goes down quickly. Scent is heavy with the barrel characteristics...vanilla and oak. Some dark fruit aromas...plum and subtle fig. The bourbon is just so smooth in the aroma. Nose is VERY inviting. Taste is boozier than expected. I don't remember the 20-year being this boozy...but delicious nonetheless. Sweet bourbon booze with vanilla and toffee flavors. A bit of coconut as well. Some plum and raisin flavors with a ton of oak and chocolate...dark chocolate. Even though this is one of the ""hotter"" variants, it is up there for most complex of the Eclipses. Great flavors in this one. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied and warming. Drinkability is surprisingly high. Overall, I love this beer. I need to drink my other 20-year bottle and review it to see which one I enjoy more. This one is pretty damn good."

"I was expecting big things from this brew, and I got what I was expecting - but nothing more. Didn't blow me away. It was indeed rich and complex and very enjoyable to drink. I'm definitely going to age my second bottle, maybe that will mellow out the booze which I think is the downfall of this brew."

"O: Overall a fine BA stout. A great nose and incredibly well balanced and drinkable for a 9.5% beer aged in whiskey barrels. It could use just a little more body. More body would also help enhance what is already an impressive flavor experience. Worth the $30? Maybe for the one-time experience, but I will not be running back to the store to drop $30 more."

"O/D-One hell of a drink. Of course, the $28 price-tag is an absolute killer. Definitely too pricey. I had to grab it when I saw it though. I really loved what the barrel brought to the flavor equation. Flavors are more toned than bulky. When I think of this compared to a $12 bomber of Bourbon County Coffee Brand Stout, this variety of Eclipse just doesn't stand up in both the flavor and price department. Worth a shot one time...unless you got plenty of cash to burn."

"O - Had this served at 60 degrees and it warmed some from there. Gotta say that I like this more than Founders KBS. It is quite expensive and I can't/won't make a habit of having this on a regular basis but I sure am glad I've got another bottle tucked away for a special occasion."

"O- great bourbon barrel stout. I'm glad I had it fresh but the high price tag may steer me away in the future."
""

"Poured very black with garnet/mahogany hues in the light. Adorned by a big beige cap that left ample trails of lace. This is a very roasty and toasty imperial stout. Lots of burnt notes here, maybe even toasted marshmallow. Biscuit and caramel leading into lots of vanilla and oak. It's like someone took Blackout Stout and tossed in a spoonful of bourbon. Medium bodied and spritzy carbonation. Quite a delicious beer and always welcome in any tasting I attend!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is really good stuff."
"edit: i just had a bottle from last year, and it honestly drinks quite a bit better fresh. it seemed thinner, less dynamic, and no more easy on the booze front. if youve got one, break it out of the cellar and drink it now, its time."
""

"O: A fantastic and unique brew. We had a discussion that as we drank it, we weren't focused on the beer, but rather on table talk. We were surprised by this and decided this is a sessionable beer. This beer is all about showcasing the barrel characteristics and not the characteristics of Imperial Stouts. Really unique and I would recommend trying a bottle."
"Overall- The alcohol was well hidden in this (I'm told its higher than listed 9.5% abv), and the flavors were good, if not mind-blowing. A nice interplay of chocolate and vanilla. Pretty drinkable. Probably not worth the $, but splitting it made it worth it."

"2012 bottling Pours a solid black with a decent sized tan head that slowly dissipates. The aroma coming out of my glass is roasty, chocolate, caramel and coffee wrapped in a subtle but evident barrel treatment of vanilla, and sweet bourbon whiskey. The flavor starts off sweet and malty with lots of roast, brown sugar, and chocolate. The barrel notes rush in with vanilla, whiskey, light wood to remind us that this is no ordinary stout. Lingering roasty whiskey with a touch of ethanol burn lasts long after every sip. Thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy creamy mouthfeel. Nice stout, the bourbon adds a nice sweetness that really compliments this version."
""
"Overall this is a great blend. The barrel does wonders to this and if you cellar it right, you can get an amazing experience out of the session. This could have probably sat for awhile longer, but imo now is the time. Great stuff."
"O-What balance, so smooth. A wonderful stout. The vanilla and bourbon notes went together so perfectly."
""
""
"O A job well done on the brewers part but the not worth the hefty price tag it boast. I think a bottle of Elijah Craig 12 would cost a bit less and go a hell of a lot further."

"O: One of the best imperial stouts I've had. A celebratory sipper. Well done, fiftyfifty! Superior."
""
""
""
""

"Overall this drinks so easily, and is one of the most perfect sweet balanced big stouts I've ever had. Finished this bottle in nothing flat. Just a great beer."

"D - Completely accessible and enjoyable. Not as tannic and overtly barrel-heavy as 2011's EC20, but definitely easier to work through. Easy recommendation here and arguably my favorite Eclipse thus far."
"O: Good, but no way is this worth the price point!"
""
"Overall this is a nice, well done beer. But for the price, there are many stouts at least this good. Really thought this was going to be at least 4.5s across the board so really a bit of a disappointment."
"O: All in all, I can definitely see the hype behind this brew. It is so easy to drink. While this is a great beer, I still think there are better brews. If you like thick stouts, give this one a try."

"Overall: Good beer. It really is interesting to see the impact the different barrels have on the Eclipse series."
"Black, yup black. Coffee colored head, coffee with milk that is. Aroma is muted however what is there is chocolate, vanilla, charcoal and well perhaps a bit of honey. On the palate is where this beer shines! Milk chocolate, vanilla, oh my mint I can actually detect mint. Charcoal is big and I also get some nice bourbon soaked woody oak. Had you never had a beer with honey as an ingredient you wouldn't know, but if you have then it is clear honey is present here and a truly brilliant addition to a stout. A very rich beer it is, thick, slick and chewy. Must say this beer would be a 5 overall, but it is a tad bit too sweet."

"It was interesting sipping this side by side with the Elijah Craig 18 Eclipse. I think both are fabulous beers, each offering a myriad of flavors. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"Verdict: Another incredible rendition of Eclipse. This beer never ceases to amaze in it's depth of flavor and general palatability and each barrel variant brings out something unique and different than the others, a joy to drink."
""
""
"O: excellent beer. When I first opened it, I didn't think it would be very good. Wrong. Hope they make it again, and make it at a less steep price ($30/22 ounce bottle). Not quite as enjoyable as the EC 18, but really close."

"22oz bomber with purple wax #478 courtesy of FickSD on BA shared at the Toronado. Poured a deep, clear brown with no head. Nose was rich with figs, raisins, oak, some light spicy alcohol, molasses, maple. Taste is very sweet, dark fruit forward, spicy alcohol, dry oak. Sticky sweet palate. 8/3/7/3/14=3.5"

"Drinkability – I like bourbon beers best with a little sweetness to them. This one has it."
""
""
"Fantastic. This is perhaps the best of the 2011 bottlings."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is my least favorite of the 5 variations I have sampled to date. Too smoky and acridly bitter with too much emerging straight bourbon flavor overpowering the base beer elements."
""
"O- After having several Eclipses, I'm ready to say that I'm not willing to throw another $30 for any of the variations. Not a bad beer, but nothing really memorable and a middle of the road BA stout IMO."
""
""
"ISO."
""
""
""
"O - This is one of my favourite stouts of all time. It is very well rounded and has plenty of diverse flavour. The smoothness is A+"
"This beer poured out as a nice looking semi-thick black beer. The head on top was a dark shade of tan with some lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer was full of roasted malts, chocolate notes, bourbon and wooden aromas. The taste of this beer was very good, the flavors of some chocolate and vanilla with the warmth of the bourbon. The sweetness of the honey and the roasted malts balance out nicely along with the bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is on the thicker side but still not as heavy as some imperial stouts. There is a subtle creaminess to the beer also which is really nice. The carbonation is low but has just enough to liven up the brew. Overall it's a killer beer, I've enjoyed each one that I've had from this series... Wishing I could afford more but I'm happy with the three types I picked up."
""
"O - Amazing brew. Can't tell if I like this or the 18 year more. The only knock I have is that I wish the ABV was a little higher but other then that this is an almost flawless Barrel Aged Stout."
"Very good beer."
"This one was a part of cmrillo’s 40 Beers* @ 40 Birthday Bash! Shared by cmrillo at his own party! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a dark reddish brown with a half finger khaki colored head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, wood, sweet alcohol, and vanilla. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, wood, vanilla, caramel, and sweet alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. After having the 18 year old version right before this one it was quite easy to pick out the differences. This one had a caramel note hinting around in it which was nice but not awesome. It did have quite an excellent smell going on with it that was rather inviting. Whether you are trying the 12 or the 18, you really can’t go wrong."
"O: The best of the 2011 variants (that I've had so far). The barrel was nicely integrated and melded well with the base beer."
"[O] Of the Eclipses I’ve had thus far, the bourbon character in the Elijah Craig 12 Year seems to be the most refined and well integrated. But the sweetness is a little high, so the long term drinkability is limited for me."
"O-- Brandy or bourbon? Something that needs to be sipped and savored. Enough notes of the base beer and enough of the barrel to make this really nice. Well done in the balance and in the softer touches of the barrel notes. Not something that hits you over the head with a hammer."
"Overall: The 09' is drinking incredible well at this point and I honestly don't see it getting any better where I believe the 11 could use some time in the bottle but is still great in its own right"
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- There is no doubt in my mind why this is so highly rated. I know why I wasnt a fan of the 18. This kicked its ass and now I am kicking my ass for not drinking this sooner and ordering more of it...DAMN!!"
""
"O: I love this stout...really tasty!"
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown with a fat, foamy, long-lasting, light mocha head. Head retention is about average. Wood, coconut, and chocolate syrup were noted in the aromas. Heavy viscous, creamy mouthfeel that becomes a little astringent at the finish. Chocolate syrup forward with some coconut and ample bourbon. A very, very good imperial stout. Much better than the Vanilla Bean Dark Lord that I'd had moments earlier."
""
""
""
"O: Very impressed. Liked this beer a lot, so easy to drink with a lot of flavor. While hard to differentiate with the 18 year, I did like this one a bit more, but would have no problem drinking either one again."
"Huge, robust stout with heavy bourbon influence. Utterly delicious."

"Overall: Really enjoyed it. I had it paired with the EC 12 which was a nice treat. Would I pay $35 for it? No. But i'm glad I got the experience and would love to have another variant again"
"poured similar to previous years, but the head was more bubbly than i remembered. smell and flavor though, is spot on. nice peatiness and wood in the flavor. these beers...they are pricey, no doubt, but worth it in my opinion (esp if you get in on the futures) the whole series is consistently the top balanced barrel aged beers available. i might even give the taste more of a 4.75 since it is so tasty."
""
""
""
"T: The bourbon isn't in the forefront as the smell would suggest, which is actually kind of nice. Instead, it lingered behind notes of chocolate covered raisin and salted caramel with a touch of dryness from the bourbon on the finish. Hints of wood, char and roasted malt. Really complex and very tasty, though I liked the 18 year better."
"A bit flat by the time I got to this one, but anyway. I have a FiftyFifty glass somewhere, but a Chimay chalice was handy, so into it I poured this thick, opaque liquid that was dark brown-black, with ruby-brown tints around the edges. The recapped bottle sat in the fridge overnight, but I still got a decent wispy mocha head from an aggressive pour. Nose of bourbon, cherry vanilla ice cream, and rich chocolate. Taste confirmed that this beer was still fine even after being open for hours. Dark roasty malts, big taste of barrel wood, boozy bourbon kick, notes of mingling vanilla and chocolate coming in mid-palate, roasty bitterness in the finish. Any dark fruit notes that may exist are distant and overpowered by the bourbon. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, smooth, full body, some alcohol heat, if there was much carbonation, at least it mellowed out by the time I drank it. Very nice overall. My second bottle will sit for a few years before I open it."
"Overall: Solid flavors in this beer, just nothing unique in a craft beer scene loaded with BA Imperial Stouts."
""
""
"O: This is delicious. A bit of a thicker mouthfeel would make this even better."
""
""
"O - Another really good Eclipse stout. Not as amazing as the 18 yr, but still very, very nice."
"My 2nd Eclipse, and excellent still!"
""
"Overall, I thought it was a great beer. The bourbon steals the show a little, but it's also adds some pretty awesome flavors. The flavors come together extremely well in it. Great beer overall, I'd definitely put it up there with an elite group of barrel aged beers."
""
""
""
"Overall: In all honesty, this one exceeded my expectations. I should probably seek out some of the other Eclipse varieties."
""
"overall very nice and tasty"
""
"O- Really good stout, only going to be better when I crack one in a couple of years. I'm excited to compare this next to the 18 in a few years."

"O: Great example of a barrel aged imperial stout, really rich, flavorful and dangerously drinkable. Lots of great barrel character that helps transform what is likely a good base beer into a fantastic final product."
"Overall, the '11 EC18 was our group's consensus favorite. But honestly, I was unimpressed across the board with most of these beers. Bourbon County Stout is far superior to all of them except EC18. Very glad I got to try them all, but EC18 is the only one I'd seek out again."
""
"i recommend at about 50 degrees is best."
""
"Thanks, Arbi. I really enjoyed this beer."
"This beer is not hot at all, one of it's best qualities. Ready to drink now but would do quite well if cellared."
"This beer pours a medium bodied chocolate brown in color wth a light and soapy beige lacing around the glass. The nose is a vanilla and and toffee masterpiece. There is smooth chocolate, smooth vanilla, tofee, cake, and light barrel. Wow, infinitely smooth and refined. This is exceptionally more balanced than the Grand Cru. The bourbon is exceptionally well meshed with the base beer and very approachable even for the style. This beer is ridiculous, and I don't say that often. the bourbon is so well I integrated that comparing it is tough. Wow, overall this is fantastic and I don't like to gush. This is one of the better barrel aged stouts I've had thus far. I will seek this out again. This is a top performance for a highly rated brewery. I applaud this effort."
"O: This was good, it just didn't hold up to the other Bourbons. Just not as well balanced. I chose it as the 4th best."
""
"(D)- Overall, an excellent stout. A pronounced bourbon barrel profile, but it pulls it off very well into the stout that was put in it. Might be my favorite of the variants."
"This beer pours with a short off white heawouldd. Not quite as dark as I would have expected. Aroma is heavy bourbon, a bit fruity, vanilla, mild coco and roast. Flavor is more oaky than bourbon, some mild coconut when it warms and more sweet caramel, mild fruit, some cocoa. Mouthfeel is pretty on point, would like some more creamy carbonation. Medium heavy bodied. Very nice. Don't know if it is worth it, but I really enjoyed this beer."

"CHEERS"
"Its pours pitch black, with a deep dark mocha colored head it leaves only a finger width head that dissipates quickly and leaves a ring of lacing. The bourbon is up front but it isn't over powering as other 50/50's I also get some chocolate, a hint of vanilla, and a good oak aroma. The taste is absolutely amazing with most other BA stouts the barrel aging overpowers the other flavors of the stout with this beer the other flavors from the base stout like chocolate, vanilla, and roasted flavor come through and complement the barrel aging. The mouthfeel is good a little viscous but not out of line for the style a little more carbonation could have made this better. Overall this is one of the best aged stouts that I have ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: I hate to say it, but believe the hype. Easily my favorite of the ’08 – ’10 series. The look on this one was even more lack-luster than the rest of the series, which is an accomplishment in itself, but the nose and flavor profile were the most impressive, interesting, complex and well balanced of the series. Lots of barrel flavors and a good showing by the base beer lead to a very tasty brew in the end. I look forward to drinking some of the 2011 vintage of this beer, and would love to track down another ’09 as a comparison. Time will tell. This one was worth the hunt. Highly recommended!"
""
""
"M - Medium body but a touch thin at times. Light carbonation."
"From a personal preference, this isn't my favorite Eclipse, but it is damn good and really shows off what a bourbon barrel can do to a beer. Got another one of these in the cellar and will let it sit longer than the others given the overall aggressive strength."
""
""
"O- 5"
""
"Great beer, but let's be real, at 30 dollars per bottle it's insanely expensive, a bit insulting actually. In the end it's another big stout with bourbon."
""

"2009 650 ml bottle generously shared by colonelforbin. Thanks Mike. Pours a black that is cola brown at the edges when help up to the light. A small tan head has good retention and leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is soft oak, some bourbon, marshmallow, vanilla, honey, caramel, some cherry, and some light alcohol. Initial taste has some sweetness with marshmallow, oak, bourbon, and some light roast. Then some hints of plum and cherry. Finish has a light bitterness and leaves a bit of lingering bourbon flavor. Quite smooth overall. Like the other versions of Eclipse this has a light mouthfeel, although this version has a bit of creaminess. Low carbonation. Overall, this is a great beer."
"This is an awesome beer. Not sure any beer is worth a $30 price tag, but an interesting and rare treat."
"O - This is the first of of the Eclipse beers I have had, and I was impressed. Not too heavy of a mouthfeel, but still a very nice creaminess. Bourbon is prominent but not in your face, and the fruit notes are nice."
""
"O- I can't remember the last time I had an Imperial Stout like this, take this as a benchmark of what the style should be and how to barrel age a beer. Totally delicious."
"O - One of the best Eclipses' I have had to date. The balance of base to barrel was nearly flawless and the booze never got to the point of being overpowering. Glad I finally got to try this one as it really lived up to my expectations."
"O: Very impressed with my first 50/50 Eclipse stout. The subtle nuances of the bourbon barrel are really felt and enjoyable. I do not think I have had a bourbon barrel aged stout that had quite this much bourbon flavor without being boozy and I could definitely appreciate this again."
""
""
""
"Honestly, if this were on draft I'd have to be cut off for the first time in my life. This is a remarkably smooth and tasty beer."
"O. This is an amazingly good beer. Very smooth and well bodied. Not very hot at all given this has not been aged at all. Lots of bold flavors. A beer everyone should attempt to have at some point!"
""
"Really makes me want to crack open my 18yr Eclipse tonight."
""
"3.5 D: This beer (and I assume the rest of what I'll drink) suffers from the same problems as the previous variants I've had. Great barrel aging, but they started with a less than impressive stout. Put a little more effort in there, and this would be a gangbusters horizontal. As an aside, EC must be some good stuff since it came off so mellow, well rounded, and complete in this beer. I might have to pick up a bottle."
"Bottle #2508. My second Eclipse variant, and hopefully not my last. It pours a straight obsidian topped by a small bit of dark tan foam. The nose comprises chocolate syrup, chocolate powder, roasted malts, bourbon, vanilla bean, oak, and molasses. The taste brings in more of the same, though with a touch more vanilla, a good amount of bourbon, and a tiny touch of char in the background. The body is a lithe medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a pretty damn smooth feel. Overall, a very nice stout, one that suffers only from its relative thinness (though this doesn't hold it back too much, if you ask me). Good times."
""
"And the reveal is Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year). Awesome, awesome beer, thanks Kyle!"

"Poured into my duvel tulip. Served around 50-55F. Pours a very opaque dk. brown to black with a nice viscosity(similar to milk). Paper thin Dk. Beige head froths and retains for the life of the drink as does the lacing. The smell is great. You definitely get the aged smoke, booze, and sugar.the taste is... Wow. A big pop of flavor up front with the residual after notes of booze, caramel, and roasted marshmallows. This is very smooth beer with only the slightest burn going down. A definite must have for any stout lover."

"****SECOND BOTTLE OF THIS FAR INFERIOR. OH GOOD GOD."
""

""
""
"O: Another solid beer from the Eclipse series, still waiting for one to wow me though."
"Pours an opaque black with a 1/2 inch foamy khaki head that fades to an oily film. Thin streaks of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, wood, and a strong bourbon aroma. Taste is pretty much the same. The bourbon from the 12 year Elijah Craig is very nice and still packs a punch. There is a slight roasty bitterness and a somewhat strong alcohol warmth in the back of the throat with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good barrel aged stout with a more in your face bourbon presence versus the 18 year Elijah Craig version. On of my favorites for the night."
"This was taster number 2. The appearance is nothing special, dark black, no head to speak of, but looks a bit syrupy. The smell really jumps out at you. It smells very sweet, boozy, bourbon and vanilla. The smell is great but it did make me a bit concerned that the beer would be oversweet. Not a problem though. The beer is sweet, but not overly so, and a lot of the booze in the nose is gone in the taste. Vanilla, coffee, bourbon and chocolate dominate the flavor. Very little roastyness, which I really like in a stout. The feel is outstanding. Low carbonation, and very smooth and syrupy. Coats the mouth and the flavor lasts. Finish lingers but is not dry. Although it's a sipper, the glass was gone before I even realized it. And the alcohol is surprisingly low considering the flavor...this is practically sessionable as imperial stouts go. Really really good stuff, by far the best of the four Eclipses I had last night."
""
"Had many of the eclipse series together. This is the 09 vintage. Pour is dark black liquid with a dark tan head. The nose has hints of bourbon, a bit of wood, lightly smoked with dry chocolate and some malt sweetness. The flavor is bourbon up front, lots of wood, notes of dry chocolate with a fair bit of rich cake and some additional fruity malt sweetness in back. Fully bodied, smooth and creamy, semi dry. One of the best in the tasting of the eclipse beers, rich and balanced with good integration."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a dark black with a thin khaki-colored haze and slight ring. Big, sweet aromas of dark roasted malt, brownie batter, and caramel, vanilla, and oak from the Bourbon barrels. Taste is similar to the nose, tons of dark chocolate, malt, and high-quality Bourbon character. Incredibly smooth and drinkable, the Bourbon has none of that ""fiery"" quality and is so nicely integrated into the beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a medium mouthfeel (a bit thinner then I hoped/expected) and lowish carbonation. Overall an amazing barrel-aged Stout, glad to be able to crack it with good friends!"

"Overall – I really wish I could have had this side by side with the Pappy version I had at Zwanze day. A fantastic beer, and right up there with the Pappy. Sadly, I feel this may be right there WITH the Pappy but I was so damn cold from standing outside for CBS that I did not get to properly enjoy this as I was able to with the Pappy. I would love to try this version again."
"D: This one went down almost too easy. Alcohol hidden well, extremely tasty, well balanced, and nice mouthfeel made it a stout to remember. I'd love to get my hands on another bottle of this, for sure."
"O: an awesome brew. I need to try the other versions"
"O (D) - A really great beer. well done, and thanks again Bill."
"Pours a pitch black. Very dark with a touch of light tan head around the edges. Smells chocolatey and vanilla heavy. The nose on this is incredible. Tastes of dark chocolate and vanilla. Overall the flavour is really solid but there is a harsh booziness that hits a bit hard. I like the beer quite a bit but it feels hotter than it should."
"It tasted really good, large barrel character along with cocoa and dark fruits. Viscous and sticky feeling, the flavors lasted long after my glass was empty. Excellent, I'd be very happy to try this one again any time. I owe you Dyan."
"The mouthfeel is medium plus body with low, creamy carb. The beer is never syrupy and dances along on it's journey to my belly. The booze is well concealed except for the bourbon which totally makes this the winner it is. Overall, this beer kicks total ass. Something I'm permanantly ISO. Nice one, fidy fidy!"
"Beer is medium to thick in body. Sweet at the lead off, the midpalate is molasses and bourbon, not hot, heavy finish, thick overall. Decent beer, very good. I'd have it again, looking forward to this year's Elijah Craig bottles."
"Pours black with a tan head. Looks the part. The smell is nothing too exciting - small hints of the barrel combine with that honey sweetness and cocoa / chocolate. The taste of this beer, however, is a huge winner. Honey, cocoa, chocolate, fudge, roast, bourbon, vanilla, oak, char all combine seemlessly to provide a decadent and yet somehow light and easy drinking (for the style), perfectly balanced barrel aged imperial stout. Once again, the base beer is a ridiculous palette to paint barrel aging on and this is the best one that I have had to date (have not had PvW yet). Mouthfeel is very good - reasonable carbonation and a good body, especially considering the low ABV. This is just fantastic and worth seeking out. The only ding for me is a less than spectacular nose."
"Overall: Hits all the marks you're looking for in a barrel-aged imperial stout. Smooth and complex without being too dry or hot. Delicious!"
"O - This beer, though quite nice, is over-hyped. It is not mind-blowing, it is just very very good. The barrel is too subdued, and the base beer is not dynamic enough to push it to the highest level."
"O-A great beer, but WAY too expensive. Loses some points for the ludicrous price."
"D - This is very good, but I can't get past the nagging feeling that it was probably better about six months ago. A very enjoyable barrel-aged stout that isn't quite up to the level of the top percentile. Still - highly recommended."
"O: A very nice bourbon barrel stout that hangs with all the big boys. It was a toss up for me between this and PPW for best of show. The other tasters put this a clear consensus #2."
"If you have the opportunity to try it, DO IT! Big thanks to JahLove for hooking me up with a taste of this!"
"Taste is a chocolate fudge bomb with a beautiful bourbon aftertaste. Sharp notes of charred oak and vanilla. A real easy drinking BA stout. It's just so smooth and chocolatey."
"EDIT: Damn, the 2011 version was pretty damn nice too."
"Black pour, thin tan head. Aroma is of roasted malts, burnt wood, caramel/chocolate sweetness. Flavor follows the nose. Very well balanced whiskey barrel stout. Bitter-sweet chocolate, vanilla, wood, roasted malts, grain. Some fruity/apple characteristics as well. Big chewy, well carbonated mouthfeel. Excellent brew."
"Overall: ridiculously good offering...."
"O: Phenomenal but almost overdone. This is fantastic, but the drinkability is an issue for me."
"An excellent beer, best eclipse I have had so far"
"O - Top-notch Imperial Stout worthy of the scores it's been getting. The blend on this beer is phenomial. A sipper, so rich and decedent. A must-try."
"I originally rated this a 4.6, this time its deservedly higher."
"O - This is an amazing beer that is a great sipper for any evening. Can't get enough."
"As this warms the finish and oak separate this from the HH and make this beer a little more interesting in my opinion. Extremely smooth and balanced, it's a tossup which Eclipse I prefer."
"Mouthfeel is perfectly smooth with mild carbonation. It's a little thinner than expected but it works well. This one goes down smooth and easy, definitely one of the best barrel aged stouts I've had."
"Drinkability: Getting to try this was a treat. The beer performed as well, meeting my expectations. Another success for barrel aged stouts."
"D: As much as I don't want to hype these beers up, they are just so damn good. Probably my favorite series of imperial stouts. I will definitely be doing my utmost to go to the next release party."
"D: Clearly one of the better -bal aged brews due to its overall subtlety. Feel is not super heavy and spirits are not overwhelming here. The barrel complements the beer here. Not the other way around. Definitely worth seeking out."
"We did a big side-by-side and I would rate them in this order: Pappy 50/50; Evan Williams 50/50; Elijah Craig 50/50; 4 Roses 50/50; Heaven Hill 50/50 (noticeably worse than the rest); Brandy 50/50 (Brandy being a drain pour). It was fun to try them side-by-side, each is incredibly distinct and there are certainly some winners and some losers."
"D: Overall, one of the best bourbon barrel-aged stouts I have had. Love all the different barrel treatments Fifty Fifty is doing with this."
"'09 Elijah Craig - 1yr old. jet black, thin large-bubbled head is coaxed with a vigorous pour but remains. Nose at first shows a dusty, oxidized malt, some unsweet bourbon, and a light soy. Reminds of aged 7000 without as much of the robust malt. Flavor is hotter up front, a thin but delicate body reminds of a nice rum-candy with warmth on the mid-palate, with some wood and cocoa through the lengthy finish, dry finish. Body and malt profile are a bit washed out but also chewy and overly sweet, some unfermented sugars remaining amidst near-balance. Still, I personally find the light body and lack of strong malt to be a trend growing too common from stout experimenters like CCB, Bruery, and now 50-50. And yet there is a ton of bourbon in this, which I've hardly mentioned, and I think this is because the bourbon blends so well with the base beer flavors."
"Drinkability is hurt by the heat and bitterness. I really want to like this beer but I can't get myself to enjoy this one as much as I want to. That being said, I want to try the other versions and compare."
"Excellent beer. If it weren't fairly rare & expensive, this would be a great beer to crack open around a campfire deep in the wilderness after shedding my chaps for the day. Looking forward to trying more varieties of Eclipse."
"I liked this beer more as it came up to temperature, the aromas and the flavors just kept improving."
"J"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied. A bit slick with mellow carbonation. I enjoy the fact that this is not overly heavy. Overall, this is a great bourbon aged stout with well integrated flavors that all hit the right marks. Really happy to have been able to sample this and looking forward to the 2010 versions."
"As usual for Fifty Fifty, this is barrel aging at it's very best. I think I like the more nuanced character of the Heaven Hill but, hey, that's a seriously high bar. Outstanding."
"Medium-full body with a rich viscosity, this nevertheless doesn't quite have the truly full, silky body of the very best (in mouthfeel) beers in this style, but all faults are overwhelmed by that sublime flavor."
"Cheers!"
"Bottle, pours black with a very thin ring around the edges and some fine lacing. Nose is a lot of that really round, big malt, bourbon, wood, vanilla. Quite smooth and rich. Mouth is a lot of oak and vanilla up front segueing into a rich, fairly boozy bourbon finish. Spicy and showcasing a lot of vanilla. Mouth is thin. This is quite, quite good, not as hefty as I though it might be but just impressive flavor profile."
"D: This one took imperial stout to a new level for me. What an amazingly rich and flavorful yet smooth and drinkable beer. I could easily finish off a bottle of this by myself. What a wonderful beer."
"Overall this beer was much more of a bourbon bomb than the HH version. Still a very nice beer but the complexity and nuance of the HH version was lost on this one. Very much worth a shot but thus far my second favorite of the series."
"Overall really just a great, great beer. I am not sure what more you could ask for in a BA RIS, other then a bit bigger of a look. But damn, this one laid me out."
"D: Very drinkable all around. Had this side by side with the Heaven Hill version and this one was just a tad bit better."
"Unfortunately this is my last of my bottles that isn't for trading with the exception of my 1 EC and 1 HH I have aging, but those are for another time. Can't wait to try these two again with some settling time."
"3. Heaven Hill (best mouthfeel by far!!)"
"Great beer and I'm glad I chose this one for my 100th. I'd love to try this in a year or so."
"My only complaint is that they supposedly didn't blend the barrels, so you could potentially have massive bottle variation in this beer. That's very disappointing to hear. However, I've had 6 bottles of this so far, and each one has been amazing (yet slightly different)..."
"It smelled pretty similar to the Heaven Hill Rye with a little bit more roasted flavors and a light bourbon nose. It tasted a bit more roasted, more bitter with espresso & toffee notes. It has a nice carbonation to it- stronger than the heaven Hill but you can taste and feel the alcohol more in this one."
"The mouthfeel is silky and creamy, with a really nice upper low level of carbonation. There's a little astringency and there's a drying woody quality. Overall, this is a top notch bourbon Imperial Stout."
"The palate opens with just a beautiful bourbon barrel character; there's caramel, vanilla and of course, a moderately boozy bourbon bite. Behind this is milk chocolate, a moderate coffee character and a very pleasant roast character. A little licorice is appears before the finish that's an excellent balance of roasty bitterness, sweet caramel and vanilla and booze. The mouthfeel is quite mindblowing, medium to full in body with a soft and gentle carbonation, and the finish is just exceptional.The balance between the barrel sweetness and the roasted bitterness character of the base beer makes this one of the better imperial stouts I've had in recent memory, this is immensely drinkable."
"What an awesome beer! The bourbon just adds complexity and warmth to a great backbone. Tons of malty sweetness, chocolate, roasted barley...just totally sweet, but not overkill or overwhelming. Full body, creamy, and semi-thick, yet excelent drinkability. Carbonation is perfect for this beer. Overall...and again, what an awesome beer!"
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a 1/4"" tan head that fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a very nice Imperial stout aroma; warm, bitter black malts, soft chocolate character, excellent oak contribution. It seems pretty earthy up front with loads of oak. I can't get enough of this aroma; quite intoxicating. The taste is great as well. It has a very smooth chocolate malt flavor with a mild black malt earthiness and oak character. The aroma indicated otherwise, but this is a nice surprise. It goes down sweet with a very nice chocolate character and finishes with some subtle black malt notes and a mild oak feel. It's not overly oaky. In fact, it's noticeable, but it's just another element in a very complex and highly drinkable beer . The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a killer IS. I'd like to kick back and sip on this one for a while, but I guess I'll just enjoy the four ounce pour in my glass."
"Glad to be drinking a bottle after discovering it at the Bistro barrel aged beer fest. Thanks go to brewtull for the hookup and the drive to Truckee."
"Good drinkability. Especially for the abv."
"It's equally bourbon-forward on the tongue, opening with flavors of maple syrup, dark fruit, vanilla and honey. The mid-palate brings out a balancing roastiness, hints of licorice and burnt toast. The body is medium-full and creamy, though not especially viscous or oily. The finish is bittersweet and hot, like a liqueur-filled chocolate."
"D: highly quaffable for something that seems (IS!) so dangerous"
"Drinkability is pretty good, and overall, this is really a great beer. Get it if you can. I recommend sending me a bottle of Midnight Sun M in exchange for this."
"Looking forward to (hopefully) trying the other versions, and to seeing how the brewing of this beer evolves over the next few years."
"O - This beer is wonderful, its very complex yet so very drinkable. Cant wait to try some more."
