"He comes in a solid second, with the county local loping gracefully past him: honking like a goose and reminding Uncle of his huge cost.  A year rest surely helped Uncle a great deal, another year for his 2 brothers dozing in the cellar before they try to do battle on the county.  They may try to race on Black Tuesday, but lack the legs and lungs. Rather than compete, they mare retire to the realm of liqueur and leave beer world forever."
"On tap at Avery. Awesome beer. Can’t even tell this beer is 16% ABV. Smooth bourbon flavors meld well with the chocolate malt flavor of the beer. Had to buy a bottle to take home."

"This is eventually going to be one of those beers you drive all over town picking up bottles, so darn good."

"O - 5 - An amazing and ideal representation of the BA imperial stout style. Highly recommend getting a few and holding em for the right occasion. Very boozy and warming, drink on a cold day!"

"The beer pours dark black with a thin halo of tan head that settles along the edges without lacing. The nose is deceptively tame with chocolate and caramel bourbon sweetness in the nose, but astringent alcohol begins to slice through as it warms. The taste is an overwhelming mix of malt and alcohol with choking bitterness in the finish. It's full bodied,  slightly chewy, but also astringent to the point of being undrinkable. General sentiments are that this beer is over-priced, over-hyped, and over-extracted."

"No bourbon in the aroma or taste.  Consumed on April 3, 2015."

"Black and boozy. Strong bourbon flavor with alcohol burn on the back end. Incredibly smooth and flavorful. Stands up to BCBS"
""
""
""
""
""

"Rather hot, bourbon, chocolate, sweet.  But that alcohol heat though. Semi creamy with faint coffee."

"The nose and flavor of this beer are a whirlwind of big ass bourbon barrel aged stout qualities including coffee chocolate, vanilla bean and baked sweet potatoes. This beer is so big you can actually smell how thick it is. It drinks thick and smooth, and the finish is boozy, semi dry with huge notes of sweet figs and slightly tart dried raisins. Big boozy bourbon on the nose and palate. A bit of heat. As with other high ABV beers from Avery such as Rumpkin and Pumpkyn, the alcohol is extremely subdued. This beer is best served ice cold, and when it is, it is extremely enjoyable.  I'm somewhere between 2 and 3 hours on this and loving it. It's a wonder Avery can consistently brew beers so strong that are so drinkable. Although not my favorite BA offering from them, still impressed and believe this is of the highest quality as with their other offerings."

"jet black, with dark tan head. huge aroma of chocolate, coffee, and booze.  same flavors in the taste, very bold and rich.  thick body.  overall an excellent beer, wish it was cheaper."

"Bought a case from Shangy's in Emmaus Pennsylvania for $240 on March 10, 2015.  Gave a bottle to Blane from Shangy's for spending two hours helping me.  Finally tried it on March 22, 2015.  Outstanding, but the high gravity, along with being just brewed, means it needs time to mellow out. One can tell that this beer will be to die for in a few years of aging."

"No overpowering aromas but the bourbon is the most detectable, followed by some coffee and a little more chocolate. Very dark brown in color and oh so thick like oil; you can see the viscosity!  Even after a somewhat aggressive pour not much in the way of a head with spotty bits of bubbles make up the lacing. Flavor is so smooth and complex.   Getting some bourbon, vanilla, wood, sweet chocolate, and coffee. So vicious and velvety, coats the palate extremely well and goes down way to easily for 16.9%. There is an evident burn from the alcohol but its to be expected. Probably one of my favorite bourbon barrel aged imperial stouts I’ve enjoyed to date. So awesome; go and treat yourself to one!"
"Overall: a great Bourbon Barrel aged stout. One of the top in the class. This is a different approach than the BBCS- a lighter body and different emphasis on flavor. There is a stronger alc finish in the BBCS, and the oak is stronger. I like the lighter balance in this beer better. Both are superb examples of the style."
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: Awesome!"

"One of top four best beers that I've  had the pleasure to partake, awesome!"

"Absolutely phenomenal BBA stout. Very reminiscent of bourbon county. I'd love to see this one with a year or two on it. But still drinks wonderfully fresh... I have no clue how that 17% is covered up so perfectly. Well done."
"Poured into an 8oz glass from the tap.  Black in color with a one finger length mocha colored head.  Quick sniff shows a bunch a sweet booziness as expected along with chocolate and vanilla.  The taste starts with boozy sweetness with a surprisingly spicy bite.  The middle sees the booze fade away and dense chocolate and vanilla flavors that are balanced by chewy caramel in the finish.  Low carbonation, full bodied, and at 16% abv it isn't close to cloying at all.  Overall, this didn't disappoint and its well deserving of a world class score.  Right up there with the best bourbon barrel stouts, and certaintly unique from the pack with a spicy alcohol bite and a great caramel/chocolate combo."
"Drinks a little hot but amazingly complex flavor. Pours dark with a nice tan head and smells of bourbon. After some more aging, I think this one is going to be even more amazing."
"The taste has a slightly prune-like and date quality with dark sugar richness with chocolate covered raisin and slight woody flavor. The bourbon barrel brings light toast and vanilla accent with somewhat nutty flavor mixed with mild alcohol in the back. The finish is semi-dry with mildly sweet aspect of residual sugar and dark malt in the taste. Overall I think this is intense and very tasty with lots of barrel character and an awesome base stout flavor with smooth body. I would say it is a highly drinkable American Strong Stout for 16.9%, one of the best in the style."

"Just about everything I am looking for in a BBA imperial stout.  Smooth, balanced, chocolatey, slight coffee and raisin notes, bourbon and vanilla, caramel on both the smell and taste.  Pitch black with a very light, almost no, head and syrupy. It lingers amazingly.  My only gripe is the sweetness. It is the sweetest BA stout I have ever had and while great, I prefer the spiceiness from the bourbon over the sweetness."
""
""
"A very thick, dark, sweet tasting beer which is what I expect from an imperial stout this high in alcohol. Bourbon flavor wasn't the strongest or smoothest I have ever tasted but it was pretty good. I haven't had any of Avery's regular beers but all of their higher end, high abv brews have been very, very good."
"Wow, this is big. Brown-black in the glass like a high-end leather sofa. The nose has a toffee sweetness, like a Barleywine. The flavor is raisins, toffee, dates and a bit of barrel. This is nice, but very hot and a touch too sweet. Seems like it would drink well after a year in the cellar."

"creamy & smokey with a very pleasant finish"

"At a beer dinner in San Diego awhile back, I had the pleasure of drinking this with Adam Avery (at the now-closed Linkery, in case anyone is reading).  I hadn't had it before, and he was geeking out as I tried it, know how good it is.    It's a true sipper, but it seems like you can parse a different nuance in every sip."
""
""
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer and worth getting when you can. The beer is well made and the barrel  well chosen that this is a fantastic beer. Not only do I recommend that you buy one, but that you get a few to age and share."
"This is an absolutely delicious beer.  I thought it would not be ready to drink yet.  Was I ever wrong.  Very tasty and well-balanced now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyable for sure. Probably needs some time to let the flavors mature a bit. Alcohol presence can be a bit much at times but the excellent taste makes up for this. It is pricey, but worth buying one for now and one for later."
""
""
"Almost on par with Tweak. A really good, albeit expensive, BA stout."
""
"Really good, but I can see no reason why, even with the elevated ABV, it should be almost twice the price of its in-class competitors..."
""
""
""
""
"I feel like I'm privy to a secret unknown by the general populace, but this beer is, for me, the perfect barrel aged stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very impressive beer, rich, roast malt flavors of coffee, chocolate, tobacco-like toasty flavors. The bourbon and alcohol are both there, but neither are overpowering. sweet notes of caramel and oak in the finish. very good stout not sure if i would get it again just because its so expensive but a very high quality stout."
""
""
""
""
"Runs a little hot, but great flavor. With aging, this would be awesome."
""
""
"-Overall the best imperial stout i have ever tried hats off to Avery!"
""
""
"o:  This fresh bottle was a beast which needs some time to tame it imo.  The boozy flavor was a bit too harsh & overwhelming for my liking.  Glad I have another bottle to sit on for a while.  Looking forward to it."
""
"Robust, silky smooth, full-bodied. Imperial Stout aged for 6 months in the very finest Bourbon barrels. Definitely Reccomend and know I'm a lucky man for being able to get my hands on this!  I'm a burbon kind of guy when I'm not drinking beer, which makes this a must have for me!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Harsh, tart, boozy, sweet, unbalanced... not something I would go back to..."
""
""
"I'll be back. Cheers Uncle Jake!"
"O: A finely made beer, certainly lives up to it's expectation, especially knowing what a bit of age will do to help this beer. Can't wait to tuck my other bottle away until i forget about it, only to discover it when it's ready to show its potential. A damn fine stout enjoyed fresh, but i would say this needs a bit of age. 4.4"
""
""
"This is a quality barrel age stout though it pales compared to some of the elite BA stouts such as BCBS.  Biggest problem is the intense alcoholic nose.  Taste is less intense on the booze but still could be dropped 1 notch."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a thick, creamy, pitch black with a three finger mocha brown head that lasts for ages. The smell is more than favorable.  Chocolate, hazelnut,  mocha, coffee, vanilla, mild bourbon,  but no heat on the nose, which is strange for the ridiculously high abv. More of the bourbon comes through on the taste, and the alcohol is present but not overwhelming. It has a burnt chocolate presence and an insanely thick mouthfeel. One of the best bourbon barrel aged stouts I've tasted."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Kinda an off smell at first, definitely needs to breathe a bit after a pour. However for the price, there are much better BA stouts out there for much cheaper."
"O: this is one fantastic BA stout. Probably my favorite BA stout to date. Wish it wasn't so expensive and more readily available. Would love a bottle to age. Absolutely wonderful experience."

""
""
"Pretty good and smooth. Still trying to get into stouts."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability – Very, very easy drinking, especially for 14.83%abv.  This is an amazing stout."
""
""
""
"O: I hate to say it, but this was not that impressive. Maybe it's because we also had Black Note tonight, but it's harsh and abrasive and over-sweet; redeemingly, it's also got some berries."
"There's a reason this is one of the top 250 beers on BA. 2013 vintage consumed while in line for Out of the Emptiness by Tied Hands. The best stout I've had from Avery. Super think, chewy, chocolate, barrel, toffee deliciousness. Paid a pretty penny for it, but it was worth the labor to purchase it. Unreal!"
""
""
""
"Pitch black with a yellowish-tan foam. Big vanilla wafer, high burn, fatty dough. Delicious beer."
""
""
"Overall:  To think that beer was brewed 2 years ago, then aged in a barrel for 6 months, and then in my pantry for another year and a half is spectacular.  This beer will only get better with age.  Here is to getting more bottles and holding on to them a bit longer."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Poured from a 12.7 oz bottle at a bar for $25 into a snifter.  Dark impenetrable black.  Little to no head.  Aromas of coffee and bourbon. Maybe dark fruit.  Smells boozy.  Tastes like it smells.  Deliciously.  Bourbon, coffee with dark roasted malts.  Boozy.  Burns going down but pleasant.  Huge ABV.  You can do maybe 2.  Love it but not at bar prices."
"BCBS on steroids.  Wicked expensive and a little bit of a chore to drink.  12oz. is enough for two people.  Go with BCBS or barrel aged DORIS instead."
""
""
""
""
"Black as sin with no penetration to light.  A fingernail of mahogany colored head.  Aroma is sweet bourbon and loads of dark,sweet malt.  I taste a massive amount of bourbon,molasses,plum,black licorice.  The mouth is very sticky and chewy."
""
"1 year aged- absolutely fantastic brew, Big nose, Big bourbon. On par with Black Note"
""
""
"O: Mainly sweet flavors, but not sweet, which is good and an indication of a well-crafted beer. This is well balanced, but I get hung up on the overly roasted flavor. I assume ager does this well."

"O-  Was wanting this for a while and it lived up to its hype in my opinion.  This is about as thick and sweet a brew comes, but very tasty.  Seems very limited so Im not sure I'll see it again, but I'd definately buy it again if possible."

"Overall: Wow! This is the definition of a winter warmer. Huge beer but stays surprisingly complex. Definitely stays on the sweet side of the stout family with the big vanilla and chocolate notes but still retains the roasted malt on the dry finish. This is a big beer and definitely worth a try for the experience alone. Only complaint is the finish is a bit too dry and the body fluctuates a bit between the sweet and smoky roasted malt that could be a bit more balanced"

"AMAZING! Hands down one of the best beers I have had in my existence on this planet. Bourbon has done this stout well...lowering the ABV from previous batches was a very good call. I can't get enough of these! Avery is always exceeding expectations."

"Overall: I like this reasonably well, but it is insanely sweet. Doesn't really stand up to something like Parabola in terms of depth of flavor. Still, glad to try it, and looking forward to seeing how it holds up after a year."
""
""
""
"Excellent beer."
""
""
"The body is moderately full.  Would have liked a bit more depth for style but still very good.  Carbonation is a bit high but also ok.  Overall a very good beer but needs a ton of time to age."

"2014 bottle from a great trader, poured July 3, 2014. Pours pitch black with a one finger dark brown head, nice and creamy. Aroma of chocolate, mellow bourbon, vanilla, caramel, anise, oak char. Reminds me a lot of Black Note on the nose. Very rich smelling yet not over the top. Flavor follows with a nice vanilla chocolate caramel note, dark fruits, long roasty finish with lingering vanilla, definite char flavors from the oaky bourbon barrels. Huge rich mouthfeel that is right on the nose with low medium carbonation. While this has a hard yet more on the fruity side than I tend to like in the style, there is no question this is world class. The bourbon barrels only accent the flavors and this isn't just some huge bourbon bomb. Nicely done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This is okay, but it's a bit too boozy for my liking. Body is a bit thinner than I'd like for the style as well. Lots of wine and alcohol at the expense of the stout qualities. Would actually like to to try the base stout on its own. Thanks again for the treats Doodler!"

"O- Just a huge, robust, thick bourbon stout that dominates the taste buds. Reminds me of BCBS with the huge flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Viscous black pour, with a small brown head that sank to a wispy layer of bubbles, some minor lacing clinging to the glass for a second or two when swirled. Nice big stouty aroma, dark malts, chocolate, coffee, dark fruits, barrel notes. The taste was good, but didn't quite live up to the aroma, rich malts, mostly sweet with a background roasty bitterness, bourbon-soaked oak with a dash of vanilla and toasted coconut, notes of dark dried fruits and a hint of smokiness. Body was on the fuller side of medium, robust mouthfeel, and pretty strong with booze, as you might expect for a 14+% beer (not unusual for Avery). Doesn't quite stack up to some of the bigger names in the world of barrel aged stouts, but in and of itself, this is still a very good brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As much as the roasty notes factored into the nose, they take a back seat to big fruit sweetness on the palate. Some chocolate ice cream too. This beer is BIGGG. Clings to your mouth like syrup. It's almost a little too sweet and I'm begging for some char. Best to treat this one like a dessert beer."

"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours pitch black with a fine half finger light brown head with great retention and lacing. Delicious aroma of dark caramel and toasted malt, bourbon, dark dried fruit, chocolate truffle. Flavor follows, with dark toasted malt with little char, vanilla, bourbon, molasses, hints of chocolate and coffee, kinda boozy. Heavy bodied, almost syrupy, but with pleasant carbonation. A really nice bourbony imperial stout with complex flavor and perhaps a bit more booziness than expected (common with big Avery beers, I think). But after a few sips, all is forgiven. This seems like a prime candidate for aging and I will do so, if I can ever find more. Man, I love bourbon and beer together."

"Pours a thick midnight black/used motor oil look with mocha head. Aroma is intoxicating - heavy bourbon but so wonderful at the same time. Lots of vanilla, some light chocolate and roast and toasted coconut. Taste is much of the same with lots of alcohol and sticky mouthfeel and more heat from the alcohol, tons of alcohol. Overall this is a damn good bourbon barrel stout, it is certainly comparable with some of the big names out there like BCBS and Blacknote, although still a small step behind but certainly better than most, just a bit too much alcohol. However the outrageously high price certainly takes it down a notch."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours pitch black and viscous with a quickly fading mocha head with ruby highlights. Bourbon hits the nose first, followed by dark chocolate, dark fruit, and coffee. Lots of bourbon on the palate along with cocoa and quite a bit of alcohol heat. Medium bodied with little carbonation. Overall, this is an outstanding BA stout, but at 17% ABV, it's a bruiser!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Really nice imperial stout. Different from others."
"Pours a dark brown to black color with at least a finger of tan head that enjoyed some lengthy retention. The nose has notes of bourbon. The body is full-bodied, sticky and creamy. The flavor profile leads off with a modest sweetness that is reminiscent of molasses. This initial blast is followed by wholesome roasted bitterness. The alcohol is a bit hot on this offering; this is definitely the type of beer that would be suitable for aging."

"Had this stout at the bar at Avery's brewery. Also had the pleasure to meet the sales manger, and a couple of the brewers that were working there, that were also from NH & VT just like me. This is a great beer and it tasted even better being right there when it is made and where it is made. The sales manger was really a great guy and gave a mixed beer and juice drink he was having plus a special bottle of Kaiser to take home. The Avery stop was part of a four day, 16 brewery tour that my brother and a couple of other buddies did to Denver, Boulder and Fort Collins. Great trip...."

"O - Compared to batch 3, this one is less balanced and harsher.  I will cellar the rest and see how they are in year or two.  4.25"
""
"Poured a 12 oz bottle with a bottling date of 2/2014. Look is a deep brown/black, with an oily appearance and a small khaki head. The smell is sweet with a strong molasses and chocolate scent. Taste was very sweet up front with strong flavor of milk chocolate and maple syrup. You catch a bit of alcohol heat on the finish, but it is welcome to balance the sweetness. This is a sticky beer, leaving a sweet coating on the lips that lingers long after the last sip. Overall I enjoyed this beer, although it was a bit sweeter than I normally prefer."
"O: I know people will compare this BBS to BCBS, and they have the right to do so. They are beers brewed in the same style with their own profiles. This one is an excellent representation of a bold BBS. Good flavor, a bit much on the alcohol, and a pretty solid mouthfeel. Overall, Well done Avery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a very strong offering. My first few tastes I was thinking it might top my favorite BBS, but it doesn't quite reach that level. It's cost might prohibit me from buying it again, however."
"I will sit on my remaining bottles to see how this develops."
""

"I realize there are some that argue all 5's are impossible. This beer for me could not get any better. Nothing should be added or taken away imo and so I have to got with perfect."

"Overall- Very good BA stout that's very welcome on a March day where winter just won't go away.. and well, I'm hoping that I am able to move to Colorado in a few months, so it's one of Colorado's finest for tonight! It's up there in the BCBS territory in terms of quality, only it costs 3x as much as a single bottle of BCBS and is a lot harder to get in comparison to the distribution BCBS gets. So while I enjoyed this, I wouldn't go out of my way to get this when I can stock up on BCBS. Regardless, my conclusion is that Batch 1 at 2 years is drinking very well right now. Essentially covers the middle ground between BCBS and Black Tuesday in my opinion."

"Choco brown bit of a head. The head was close to none even though it was pour appropriately. It smelled fruity and dark choco scent was coming out, well hidden booze. The taste was good. It came a bit sweet but it was good, as I've mentioned earlier, well hidden booze. Chewy on the mouthfeel, that's how i like my stout. Overall, it was a good stout. I'll buy it again because it was flavorfull."

"I intend to add this next statement(or its contrary) to all my reviews - some beers that I might rate highly are beers that I don't necessarily feel are worth seeking out, considering the trouble to find them or their cost. I might recommend other beers even if I don't personally like them, hell, even if I think they're garbage, as long as they are singular, creative, novel, or so bad you have to try them. This is what it comes down to : uhh do try."

"Overall: It is a bottle of beer that can be sipped and enjoyed like a wine or brandy. Warm, but smooth ... could handle more balance but would pair and hold up to strong pungent cheese."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer is a bruiser, even a bit too powerful. It a beer that deserves its rating, but probably not much higher. I would like to let it sit longer to cool down, but after my experience with 3.5-4 year aged Harvest Ale I'm afraid to let beers sit too long (although another few months won't compare to 4ish years). This beer this brew most resembles is KBS from Founders, I would love to do a side by side (I honestly don't know what I would prefer nowadays)."

"The beer is near black with a quarter inch of silky beige collar. The aroma brings dark chocolates, roast, huge malt profile, bourbon, oak. Some vanilla and barrel notes, but more chocolate and bourbon. A delicious beer! So smooth. I honestly hadn't looked at the abv. I thought it was around 12-13%. 17.42% abv?!? Are you serious. Apparently, it's serious, because I felt pretty awesome after I finished my 6 oz. Outstanding beer and well deserving of the high ratings."

"Mouthfeel/Overall: Very full bodied stout, with just about the perfect level of fine carbonation. Residual sweet finish, and the alcohol burn hints at the 16%+ ABV. Overall, a very complex stout. While it was on the sweeter side and I probably would not want to drink 12oz in more than one sitting, I enjoyed it immensely."
""
""
""
"O - It errs on the side of a sweeter stout, but it's definitely packed full of goodness."
""
"As stated above, this reminds me of Black Tuesday a lot but not quite as sweet as the former. The raw strength of the stout and base brew seems to contrast but still blend nicely with fresh woody oak and some good whiskey notes. I should pick up a 2013 bottle just to see if age has changed this 17.43% beast at all..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- darn good. Finishing off a big meal with this. A very nice imperial stout. My unfounded opinion would be to drink fresh as the sweetness would, in theory, only increase with age."
"O: Whoa Nelly, we've got a big one! Yet another enormous beer from Avery. A bold sipper that drinks like a fine cordial or cognac. I can picture this really being something with age. Though it drinks fine fresh, it does have a boozy and estery punch that will probably mellow with time, letting those wonderful chocolatey malt flavors pull through more. This was a real treat on a cold winter night."

""
""
""
"O-This is close to my favorite beer ever and easily my favorite stout (or imperial stout). It is complex, big, decadent, rich, but never harsh or overblown. The beer literally oozes flavor and character. I was particularly surprised by how little the 2012 had changed compared to the 2013; they were nearly identical in flavor and feel, which suggests both that this beer is great fresh and will hold up for a while. I could just sit and sip on this for hours."

"Just an amazing double stout. It may be the only one I ever try, but I would love to get some more. Wow."
""
""
"O - A stout that is balanced far towards the sweet, sticky candy-like aspects of the style. Roasted character is minimal and in the background of the flavors. Definitely a sipper...the high alcohol content, warm alcohol burn, and prominent sweetness keep this one a slow goer. A bit out of the ordinary...definitely enjoyable - a dessert beer for sure."
""
""
""
"D: This was a huge brew, with a complex scent and taste. A little sugary for me, but still delicious. The body was great, but the finish was super hot, so it must be sipped. A few years or more would likely do this beast some good. Nice fresh, but pretty crazy."
""
""
""
""
"O- This was the second time I've had this beer, I wasn't overally impressed but considering the style and abv Avery did a decent job- still this remains a gimmicky beer to me based on the high abv. There was a nice complexity to this beer but there are plenty other stouts that I'd rather drink."
""
"Deep, dense ebony body - minimal head. Heavy on the bourbon, charred malt, lots of vanilla, dark chocolate, dark fruit, torched espresso. Very over the top - definitely thrilled to have this without dropping $17 on a 12oz bottle. A fine elixir - heavy, decadent and full of boozy complexity"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- For such a big, young stout I am very impressed with what Avery has done here. Give it a year or two in the cellar and it would be a perfect stout. Buy 2, one to age, one to drink right away. You wont be disappointed. you might even catch a slight buzz from 1 bottle."
""
""
"O - Very well done and I enjoy big barrel aged beers but this one is a little overbearing because the alcohol masks a good portion of the flavor.  If it weren't for the alcohol killing the complexity I'd score it higher."

"A superb example of the style. I'll look at other bourbon barrel aged beers differently after this one... and won't be fooled by huge vanilla and oak... that's not ALL that bourbon tastes like. I payed a pretty penny for 2 bottles at a shop, but I can't say I was disappointed in the first one I opened. I don't think I'll buy any more but it's worth trying if you like BCBS, aged boris, dark lord, etc"

"What better way to celebrate the Fourth of July than cracking another bottle with your friends, eh? This one pours a straight obsidian topped by a half-finger of light sienna foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, dark chocolate syrup, bourbon, light oak, light buttercream in the background, and dark molasses. The taste brings in more of the same, blending the chocolate, roast, and bourbon flavors incredibly well. The body is fairly hefty, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly chewy feel. Overall, a damn fine barrel-aged stout, one that doesn't overdo the barrel and melds the barrel very well with the base stout. Good times, indeed."
"Wow is this beer crazy. 2013 version and quite delicious. Very beautiful pour. Dark brown pour with an awesome caramel head. Roasty Oaky boozy smell. Strong taste for sure, but it hides the amount of alcohol for sure. Great beer with amazing flavor. A sipping beer for sure, but glad I got my hands on this beer."
""
"Intense, complex, and cooperative. This beer tells an interesting story and was worth the $12 price tag. Not one to have every night, but worth trying this once and maybe a again a couple times each year. This is a beer worth holding onto in the cellar for a couple years while the flavors come together and the little alcohol heat settles a bit. in general, Avery's big beers age well to develop a 'completeness' in 2-3 years. While this could go longer, I wouldn't chance longer than 3 years."

"O- I think if you put a TG Assassin label on this one, you would fool a lot of people. Very nice!"

"T: Given the high alcohol, this is ridiculously drinkable. Lots of molasses and milk chocolate soaked raisins upfront. Caramel, tons of fig, burnt marshmallow, toasted coconut, burnt caramel and a finish of bourbon, charred wood and just a slight kick of heat. The mouthfeel is slick and heavy, bordering on syrupy, but there's enough dryness from the alcohol on the finish to hold it back a bit. A fantastic barrel aged stout."
"O: If you can cut through the heat, there is a fantastic beer here. If I had another I'd lay it down for a year or two and would expect something phenomenal."
""
"This one fabulous beer. Hides the bourbon and alcohol amazingly.. Caramel, Molasses, dates, sugars, are the highlights. Not too carbonated and dark sweet aroma. A fantastic beer, probably the best imperial stout I've ever tried. More subtle and complex than Black Tuesday, yet near same ABV. This one hides the alcohol so well, plus love the fact that it comes in 12oz bottles, perfect for me for one time (as opposed to the bombers and me having to drink it solo). If you haven't tried you should definitely seek this one out!"

"Pours pitch black with a very small dark brown ring of bubbles. Very sweet on the nose, huge chocolate notes with a little bit of smoke. Taste is all chocolate upfront with sweet sugary toffee and a little bit of char that leads into an amazing warming bourbon aftertaste that lingers in your mouth. Mouth is on the thicker side with just enough carbonation to carry it. Overall I was very impressed with this brew and can't wait to see how it does in the cellar."

"One of the most intense and powerful beers I've had. Having this next to Bells Black Note and the Bells just doesn't have the intensity to stand up to it. While there are flaws here, and I feel perfect is still out of reach, this is a must try for anyone lucky enough to find it on tap or better yet in a bottle with a few years age on it!"
"Overall, this is one of the best bourbon barrel stouts. Don't pass up a chance to try this beer. It is really well put together and drinkable."
""
"Great chocolate character initially, but dark fruit notes become a little overpowering. Of course it's a little hot...a lot hot, actually, but mighty tasty. Wish the chocolate or roast were a little more prevalent."
"This stout weaves together its web of tastes seamlessly and provocatively. Its truly seductive to the taste buds and easily makes you forget about its power- an absolutely devilish stout!"

"O - Overall not at all what I expected from a bourbon imperial stout. Way way too sweet and not roasty, or even remotely hoppy for what I would expect from the style.Admittedly my only reference point is Goose Island Bourbon County, and this is far from it. Taste just like a double bock with NO bourbon at all. Quite disappointing when I wanted a bourbon stout comparable to Goose Island's. Jeez, I hope that every other bourbon stout doesn't pale quite as badly in comparison."
""
"O: sometimes I wonder what I need to find in an Imperial stout to really blow me away these days, but this was a real treat of a beer - great combination of the rich stout flavors, herbal hops, and bourbon whiskey. Was sweet but not too heavy-handed about it, truly great balance of flavors and feel; with its high abv, a real decadent way to end the day."

The dark fruit character and the barrel notes are really well done. Definitely would try this again, but even 12 oz. is a lot."

"o - Overall I loved this one; I was blown away with how great it was. It looks great and has a great mouthfeel for a big stout, and the nose and taste are a fantastic mix of bourbon, chocolate, and vanilla. It is definitely a hot beer, but if you like bourbon-forward hot beers as long as it still tastes good and mixes well with other flavors than this would be right up your alley. With a little time on it in the cellar this could become even better, but IMO it's great now. Definitely going to be looking to get more bottle of this soon."

"This is a medium to fuller bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is rich and complex but becomes quite numbing across the tongue in a hurry. While colder than ideal, there is quite a bit of enjoyable character to take in. However, as it warms up it really becomes a bugger to put down (like some other big series Avery brews.) There is quite a bit of oxidation evident in this already and while all signs point to aging this, I dont know how I would feel with more oxidative quality present. I liked this and would drink it again but probably opt-in for only a couple of ounces."
""
""
""
"Overall, I wouldn't pay anywhere near $25 again, but I was glad I did, it was my second to last beer of the Denver trip, and who knows, I wasn't going to come across a bottle of this again. I think $10 a pop is a fair price if I was at a bottle shop for this."
""
""
"This beer poured out as a massive thick looking black beer. The head came and went, not leaving any retention or lacing. The smell of the beer is loaded with molasses, there is a hint of smoke and wood. The taste of the beer is a little salty, it's sweet too there is a bit of smoke in the finish. The mouthfeel is thick enough to compare it to motor oil, there is a light amount of carbonation to it. Overall it's a hell of a stout. Worth trying if you can afford the price tag."
""
""
""
"O - Very boozy, hidden behind sweet chocolate and teriyaki."
""
""
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel is spot on. For a beer that's 17.42%, you wouldn't quite expect it from Uncle Jacob. Well balanced, perfectly smooth, and a great carbonation level. Very well balanced with a warming finish. Love this beer, very drinkable a perfect sipper. Avery nailed it when trying to make a good barrel aged stout, this is wonderful. Overall one of the best Barrel Aged Beers I've had, but wouldn't expect less from Avery."
""
"A very nice offering overall but this one is a touch over the top for me at some points. A bit too sweet and real boozy going down. A real big brew that I wouldn't hesitate enjoying 2-3 ounces of again, but a whole bottle is way too much here."
"Overall: I really dig this beer. Its really great tasting beer with a mouthfeel to match. All the big flavors that i love from a BA stout. Avery's has really got some nice beers these days! Never been that impressed by Avery's, but I should start paying more attention to this brewery!"
"not as impressive as I had hoped. not as complex as it is ""big"" but it's tasty nonetheless. I'd sip on it again."
"Big thanks goes out to funkydelic for sharing this one at our Labor Day tasting! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured pitch black with a half finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, alcohol, and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, alcohol, dark chocolate, roasted malt, wood, and subtle dark fruit. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. First off, if you are wanting to drink a few beers and not get drunk, this beer is not for you. This thing is a beast and lets you know it straight out of the gate with huge notes of alcohol upon first inspection. It is a little more subdued as the sip sits on the palate by becoming more roasty with a hint of dark fruit. A really well done brew, but drinker beware about the alcohol. It will truly put you in your place if you aren’t careful."
""
"Medium bodied with a rush of spicy, bourbon that lingers over the sweet and roasted malt notes into a boozy, warm finish. Although the flavor is dominated by bourbon, the barrel character is nicely integrated. Some dry oak, coconut and marshmallow mellow things out but that strong spicy bourbon bite is the star of this beer. I would have thought that it spent more than six months in the barrel. As it warms, a mix of sweet and roasted malt notes come forward. Again, I'm surprised that it's not a complete booze bomb, containing hints of rye, sweet and dark chocolate, caramel, toffee, coffee bean, licorice and dark fruit. The very high ABV is nicely masked with little heat. There is lots of bourbon and sweet alcohol flavor but it's not intrusive at all with some nice warmth in the finish. I was a little skeptical after seeing 17.42% but this is a well crafted decently balanced beer."
"O: Generally, I tend to shy away from Avery as I find most of their beers to be pretty overrated, however, an almost 18% BA IS intrigued me.   And boy am I glad I tried this one.  Its well balanced, very tasty, and does an incredible job keeping in line the huge ABV.  Definitely a must try for fans of big beers.  Well done!  "
""

""
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, sugary, and boozy."
""
""
""
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: WOW! Alcohol is really well hidden for a whopping 17.42%! Don't get me wrong, it warms you, and you can feel a buzz coming on after your 2nd sip, but this beer is ready to drink now. Reminds me a lot of Mephistopheles with a nice Bourbon character added. Great stuff! I need more."
""
"O: A-"
""
""
"Wonderfully complex: roast, caramel, toffee, booze, dark fruits, more booze, some cherry medicine at the end. Excellent blend, great body. Minimal hints of the booze when cold, though it shines through as it warms. Really damn good overall."
"O: A bit on the hot side, but great flavors. I wish they made a similar stout at maybe 11%, but this is a very good stout. Nice roast, dark chocolate, and bourbon."
""
"D - It's pretty hard to drink in anything more than 1oz portions. This *might* be good in like 5 years, but it may also be terrible. The sweetness is more off-putting than the alcohol."
"Tar and burning booze. Caramel, vanilla, dark chocolate, bourbon. Full, syrupy body with low carbonation. Alcohol is harsh and burning in the finish. This has some decent flavors, but it's pretty unpalatable."
"Fantastic stout, I wish I had more of these to lay down."
"O: definitely was a solid brew and was glad to try it. Good lookin out on the bottle beezler."
""
""
"Pours a dark brown, almost black, with a small tan head. Super bourbony aroma with some vanilla, oak, and dark chocolate. Very, very sweet with lots of brown sugar, molasses, and caramel. Tastes of chocolate, brown sugar, caramel, bourbon, and vanilla. The sweetness is very pronounced, and despite the alcohol content and barrel aging, not as boozy as I thought."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful beer, dark mahogany with cherry hues and a persistent etched surface sheet of dark mocha foam. It's funny, people consistently concede the absence of carbonation in higher ABV beers, I don't buy it and this is another confirmation of my hypothesis. The smells of prunes, dates and figs with liquor infused vanilla and fine chocolate truffles alongside leather and rich caramels. Hints of smoky molasses up in the nose as well. Very pretty. Flavor backs up the nose with molasses, bourbon, oak, cocoa, rich sweet vanilla and toasted sugars. A good boozy character warms the throat and leather character brings it all together. Full and silky body with nice, fine carb and a good solid - long lasting finish that runs the duration of five minutes (this is a long time for those actually looking at the clock). Really fine beer that I plan to buy the rest from the store I found this at. Really outstanding."
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, coconut, wood, and bourbon. Taste is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, vanilla, wood, and lots of bourbon flavor. There is an alcohol kick and woody aftertaste on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some awesome aromas and flavors that make for a dangerously drinkable beer."
""
"O: good beer but a little young. Other than that it was solid."
""
"Overall this is quite nice. One of the really great bourbon Imp stouts out there right now. I'm going to have to try to get ahold of another bottle so I can age this beast."
""
"O: The booze on this beer is well balanced with a nice back-bone of flavor, but I think it could stand to mellow a bit. Very nice that these were bottled in 12 oz. bottles though as to drink a bomber might be a bit rough."
"Drinks great for the style & the over the top ABV. Almost on a par with the Abyss in many aspects, but even pricier. I would pick up another bottle to age given the chance, but drinking great right now, just a bit of rough boozey edge..."

"O - This is a really good bourbon barrel aged stout. Another good limited release brew from Avery."

"O: great beer, but the sweetness can be overwhelming, and the bitterness and bourbon does not quite cover it. $10 to $16 per bottle and still worth it."
""
"D - Not a session beer, nasty things could happen. Nice as a shared sipper."
"o - this is a world class stout, and not as limited as some, i would suggest seeking it out if bourbon barrel stouts are your thing."

"overall this is a monster of a stout. big, bold flavors and a nice bourbon kick which i love. on the downside it was a bit sweet for me, which became more and more evident as the beer warmed, making it borderline cloying by the time i was nearing the last of my glass. in the final analyis, for me it's a very good / borderline great beer with the caveat that it's an occasional treat - and at that i'd be good with 6oz worth."

"The taste is expectantly sweet, but not without balance. Huge notes of dark chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, bourbon barrels, and dark berry fruits offset the intensity of the residual sugars and make for an entirely complex, yet enjoyable flavor profile. The alcohol is extraordinarily well-hidden within the creamy, chewy body. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and heavy on the tongue, but velvety smooth and decadent--think along the lines of a melted fudge-sicle. All in all, an excellent beer. Shows that Avery has both the drive to craft an 'Extreme' beer in this day & age, and yet the restraint and artistry to make it absolutely delicious."
"So, out of the bottle and into the glass this goes. Pours an absolutely pitch black color, thick like raw oil coming up out of the ground. A nice tan head forms around the top, it basically bubbles up out of the dark thick mud. Smell- Charred molasses, caramel, toffee, bourbon, milk chocolate, dark chocolate. This beer bitch slapped me already. Taste- just a super thick velvet of dark chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, charred molasses, and crazy amounts of booze wraps itself around my tongue and sides of my mouth. Jesus. This is an evil dark motherfucker of a beer. A little but of liquorice at the end of the booze, this reminds me of BCS in some ways, but its bigger and has a super thick mouthfeel. Wow. for 18%, and a beer thats basically fresh, the ABV is not too abrasive. It is there as you would expect it to be, but this is more drinkable than I expected. Seek this out, buy several, let them cellar."
"Served in a bottle at Firkin and poured into snifter. Black an inky on the pour with minimal head and lacing. Nose is heavy bourbon and vanilla with a considerable amount of char from the barrel. Waves of chocolate and roast emanate strongly with mild boozy character which I find surprising considering the massive gravity of this brew. The taste is very sweet up front with molasses and licorice. This is followed by by intense roast, dark chocolate, an highlights of vanilla. The mouthfeel is heavy but not syrupy. Very mild in the carbonation department. Overall, I am very impressed with the balance considering the high abv. This is damn good and I recommend those looking for an intense stout to seek this one out!"

"O/D-At $11 a 12 oz. it is a piggy bank breaker, but this beer is pretty phenomenal. Just ridiculously full bodied and rich. Would maybe like a bit more bourbon in the flavor but the other aspects of the beer's taste more than make up for it. I think its worth the price tag."

"o- a Great Beer!!! A+ on this one. would like to open a bottle in 2015 or something."
""
"Dominant flavors of tobacco and molasses, faint coffee roast and chocolate in the middle, with some alcohol heat at the tail end. Low carbonation with a chewy, sticky, viscous feel. The malt character has some slight oxidation, tastes like old leather. Not much distinctive bourbon here... some wet wood maybe, but little in the way of actual bourbon. Overall the flavors aren't all that cohesive, instead somewhat messy and it falls a bit flat. Drinkability is reduced by the high abv and sticky feel. Honestly a bit disappointed in this, had high hopes after sampling the fantastic 2012 Samael's recently."

""
"O: This is perhaps the biggest beer I have ever had. Very well crafted for such a big beer. Full of flavor, smell. And thank you Avery for bottling this into a 12oz bottle."
""

"Pours a thick, pitch black like motor oil. Medium dark tan/brownish head that goes down at a steady pace. Scent is sweet bourbon up front. A ton of it in fact. Some intense booziness as well. Smells like a booze chocolate cake. A ton of toffee and nuttiness. Taste is boozy chocolate cake and sweet brown sugar with some burnt sugar malt flavors. Intense bourbon flavor with a great amount of toffee and vanilla. Subtle coffee flavors with mocha and more vanilla. Boozy warming sensation. Mouthfeel is full bodied and syrupy. Drinkability is fairly high for how big it is. Overall, this is a very tasty beer that is somewhat comparable to Black Tuesday. Not really as well-balanced though."
"Had this beer the day it was released, and had it again today. Simply flawless. The bourbon is there, but not over-powering. It's a super fine stout with just the right amount of bourbon barrel. The thing that stands out to me is a sweetness in the taste that especially emerges over time. Reminiscent of Rumpkin (another fine beer from Avery) with that sweetness, though not as sweet as Rumpkin. Creamy and full mouthfeel."
""
""
"O: Drinkability is down, cellar ability is up. I did not finish my bottle but I will say it had much more body than BT or CR. Worth the price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: My first impression is that this reminds me a lot of Black Tuesday. This has a bit stronger bourbon hit up front, but with less molasses than BT. This is a delicious exercise in extreme barrel aged stouts."
""

"12oz. bottle served in a snifter. Poured a deep brown/black with a finger of dark tan head. Big, boozy nose with chocolate and vanilla. Starts our really boozy, but that evens out a bit as it warms. More chocolate and vanilla from the barrel. Full bodied and rich. Long finish of chocolate and vanilla. Did I say chocolate and vanilla enough? This could use some time to round out into something really special."

"O - Overall I enjoyed this beer alot. I think it needs some time to develop into that next step. Glad I've got 6 more to let sit for a while, I think this has potential to become something amazing."
""

"O: a very nice, very big beer, deffinatly glad I tried this one. Not overly sweet or dark fruity, heavy on the booze, and some very nice complexity.... I could see this beer aging very well."
""

"I opened two bottles from different sources to confirm. The foregoing is confirmed for me. I have no need to try again."

"O - When I first heard the term “bourbon barrel-aged beer,” this is exactly what I was picturing. I’ve had others that were very tasty but just didn’t have the bourbon flavor or feel I was looking for. This certainly does AND it has all the notes of a good stout. Although the ABV is really high at almost 18%, it is hidden extremely well and is not harsh at all. In fact, I think the higher ABV really adds to the bourbon feel. This was a great beer, and I’m very grateful to tacosandbeer for the opportunity to try it."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into snifter glass. Pours deep, opaque black with thin, fizzy tan head that quickly dissipates. Aroma gives off notes of chocolate, espresso, caramel, raisin, sweet dark licorice, brown sugar, vanilla-tinged-oak, and bourbon. Flavor is huge just as I hoped. A little too warm, but the fact that it’s chuck full of flavor helps it ease down the throat. Rich sweet dark chocolate tones on the palate first, some fig/raisin dark fruitiness, with a little tone of roasted coffee, some brown sugar, earthy licorice, caramel, a little bit of boozy vanilla, a twang of oak, and a mellow but warming bourbon ending. This is a rich and satisfying stout!"
""
"Overall: Good beer who's sweetness is a bit much at the moment but I think will die down with time. The taste profile is well layered, and if the heat and sweetness die down it'll be a real treat."
"O: This one definitely gets better as it warms. Really big flavors and the aromas are decent as well. I will be putting a few of these away to see how they age."
"O - Wow, what an amazing beer. So full of everything I enjoy. If they cut the ABV a bit I think this would be at the top."
"Overall, this is dangerous stuff. 17.42% and this drinkable when fresh? Wow. Cheers!"
""
"A very sweet Imperial Stout, but the sweetness will fade greatly with time. This is another great Avery offering that can and should be cellared for over 10 years. I cannot wait to try it again in a year or two. I hope to re-review and bump it up a bit more... Highly recommended, if you can find it :)"
"Fantastic beer although definitely a sipper. 6 oz of this was about right. I was amazed how smooth this one went down. Definitely digging the Avery barrel program."
""
"Even better than last year's. I think it's an interesting coincidence that as the ABV has dropped each year it gets better. Good stuff."
""
"Black with a dark mocha head and really nice lacing. The head quicly recedes, leaving only some remnants of it around the edges. A sweet, rich but alcohol filled aroma; sugary, chocolate, oak, and bourbon. A little sugar sweetness shows itself in the get go but its paired with some bourbon and alcohol, then the milk chocolate shows itself in the finish and stays strong into the after taste. Tastes like I have a bite of milk chocolate slowly melting in my mouth. Thick, rich, sugary, awesome. A nice creamy medium bodied mouthfeel to this with no carbonation to it, allowing the flavors to stick with you rather than be washed away. Overall, all I got to say about this is its fantastic. It's definitely got some heat to this but its balanced with a great, rich flavor. The bourbon barrel was used with great finesse, it contributes to this beer without taking over and dominating the beer's identity. One of the most enjoyable sippers I have come across. Might have to break the bank and buy some more of this."
"O - Glad I opened one up. Really looking forward to trying this again around the holidays. Worth trying if you get the chance."

"Couldn't resist and cracked a bottle from the cellar, after only a couple weeks, lol. I have heard great things so figured I'd try one. Poured from bottle to a NBB globe the beer pours a deep rich opaque black, thick, 1 finger head with solid retention and some lacing. Looks good. The aroma is rich and complex with roasted malts, oak, chocolate, and an alcohol warmth. The flavor builds from the nose with a rich flavor. Begins with a strong coffee and chocolate flavor up front. The roast enters and blends well providing a nice base layer. Hints of dark fruit, oak, and bourbon as well. Very good. Extremely smooth and hides the high abv very well. Finishes creamy with a lingering chocolate roast on the tongue. Very very good. Full bodied and well carbonated. Overall, this beer is fantastic. I can't wait to see how it ages. Highly recommended."
"Should have bought more!"
""

"o-this beer has huge cellering potential. I cannot wait until next year, and years after to keep trying this beer. There is so much in this beer that is just waiting to come out. The alcohol mellowing out will help these to come forward. This is a sipping beer, best shared with friends over something dark and chocolate like. Great job Avery, keep hitting these out of the park!"
"Overall I would kill this beer everynight with no problem and besides Black Tuesday 09 probably the best 17+% alcohol beer I've had. Really well made and I will be searching for more"
""
"Pours big black in color without a head. Nose has sweet hot dog bun, oak, vanilla, bourbon, and chocolates. Taste is dark chocolates, sweet molasses, vanilla, burnt oak. Nice complexity. Mouth is thin and a little watery. This. Ould use some time as it is still hot. Recommended, but also recommended a couple years down the road."

"are you kidding me? a beer could not be any bigger! new one from avery. pours espresso colored with a short espresso colored head that fades right out. looks like the consistency of black tar. smells less like coffee, but its still present, ground fresh and strong. like a woody liquor, oak for sure in the nose, with robust booze, tobacco, and black licorice notes, even a whack of fresh coconut, runny warm caramel, and sludgy espresso. the alcoholic burn in the nose more or less gives away the huge abv. the flavor though is less straight booze. very sweet, i taste the bourbon now, a very alive concoction. other flavors introduce themselves one by one... first is toffee sweetness, melting into a marshmallowy alcoholic thing, which is followed by a cigar-like fresh tobacco stickiness. feel is epic too, straight woody spirits leave a deep burn. the almost nonexistant carbonation and syrupy heavy body make it last on the teeth, almost unpleasantly in a raw sugary way. so so smooth though it demands high ratings. foaming in the mouth and ever larger, meliora! overall a pretty absurd beer from the most inconsistent brewery in the country. its one of the most massive beers of all time as far as im concerned. thanks beer gods for this masterpiece!"

"O-absolutely great imperial stout right up there with the big boys IMO. Drank three bottles at the release party that says wonders for its drink ability for being a 17%abv brew. Awesome stuff"
"OVERALL: This is simply a very well-done barrel aged stout. A great beer, one of Avery's best efforts."
"o- I bought three, I wish I bought a case. This is in the same league as the greats. Avery hit a homerun with this one. world class"
"It's definitely worth trying, but it's just too strong to drink/enjoy much in my opinion. It has a decent flavor, but outside of the taste/novelty, might as well just drink liquor."
"As advertised - great body, roundness, and viscosity. The barrel is perfectly balanced with the other elements, and it's clear that this is not just Bourbon Barrel Meph. Obviously added a bunch of sugar to cut the heat, which works now and makes it great to drink fresh, but worries me a tad on the aging."

"Picked up a few bottles of this at Avery last night. One of the best Avery beers I've had. Pours dark brown with tan head. Smells and tastes of a near perfectly balanced blend of bourbon, vanilla, quite a bit of cocoa, and thankfully no coffee. At 17% ABV, the alcohol is hidden pretty well. However, there is some alcoholic heat on this one, but still quite smooth. By way of comparison, I prefer this to Black Tuesday. Not as excessively sweet. Overall, an excellent beer. I can't see this beer benefitting with age. Thanks Avery for not forcing me to buy this in a bomber."

"Ticked from at Ratman's in order to tick before ratman. We drank four bottles at the release and enjoyed them immensely. Had no intention. Of ticking again, but wanted to get this one in before ratman. Blame the goddamn phone for the typos. Happy easter."
