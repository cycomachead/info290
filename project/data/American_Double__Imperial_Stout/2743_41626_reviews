"Pours pitch black with a thick tan head. Sweet aroma, slight toffee notes. Wonderful taste of slightly sweet coffee, very roasty; finishes with a balanced degree of bitterness. Mouthfeel is unexpectedly thick, a bit grainy, but it's incredibly drinkable for 8+% abv. Fantastic beer, definitely on the sweeter side though."

"2013 bottle poured into a snifterat cellar temp. Subtle honey notes over a nice roasty backdrop. Creamy with the perfect body for a non-BA stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"feel the power, chocolate gives way to creamy to yum.  With a good buzz taboot."
"This beer wasn't that great overall.  A bit thin for the style and a pungent smell of alcohol.  As it warmed, the alcohol mellowed and the malt flavors became more pronounced.  However, you can do much better in this style category."
""
"Overall. My favorite is still a sweeter, maltier beer, but this is very good for a more balanced stout."
"Perfect example of a well balanced stout, Green Flash has won my heart all over again with this baby, I will definitely be revisiting this one soon."

"Wow.  Smooth, smooth, smooth.  No bite I could detect which is highly unusual for a double/imperial stout.  This thing will sneak right up and get you if you let it.  I would let it."
"Bottle. Pitch blacj with big, light brownish, densed head. Medium lasting. Average lacing. The nice aromas of roasted malts - dark, bitter chocolate and coffee. Also you can experience nice touch of toffee and earthy notes. Taste is medium bitter, toffee, chocolate with some liquorice and vanilla. In general taste is semi-sweet. Full body, oily and velvety texture, soft carbonation. Finish is coffe, semi-sweet and bitter. Little alcohol warming. In general very enjoyable and drinkable RIS."

"Had this poured into a stout glass, my 4th Green Flash review. The color is a dark brown, with a beautiful milk chocolate color head. The smell and taste is full of roasted malts. Some slight mocha flavor as well. The mouthfeel is a little harsher than I'd expect, more carbonation than I'd expect but not too bad. Overall, everything you're looking for in a double stout."
""
""
""
"Color is great, nice mocha head. Smell is just pure citra hops, taste is way too hoppy for a stout. Not sure what they were thinking with this one. Drain pour"
""
"Final Thoughts - $10 for a 4 pack pisses me off, but the 8.8% abv is awesome."
""
"Overall: An excellent beer, Green Flash shows they can do many styles well"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Black. Opaque. Brown head. Smell and taste of roasted goodness. Malt, chocolate, and coffee. I love every bit of this, from the pour to the bitter aftertaste. I will get it again."
"Rich mouthfeel. Long finish, after the mild taste, some bitterness expresses itself quietly."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A unique Imperial stout. The hint of smoke adds another level of complexity to the overall boldness of this brew. Worth seeking out if you are seeking an out of the norm Imperial stout."
"12oz bottle poured into snifter. Pours an opaque oil black. Cream colored crown with ring of carbonation bubbles around circumference of glass. Not much lacing. Coffee in the scent, but aroma is light with a hint of smoke. Feel is not as heavy as I expected. Coffee taste is muted (like the scent) and roasted malt comes through. Just enough hop bitterness to finish each sip. Got better with each sip. (8.5)"
""
""
""
""
""
"Great . Coffee and and malt flavor"
"Overall:  This is a pretty good stout!  Good, strong malty flavors, well balanced with some sweetness, dark chocolate-like bitterness and some hops.  Good beer."

"I really liked this one because it comes at you in phases.  First you smell the caramel and malts then pick up the coffee and vanilla.  Appearance wise, this is black with a brownish tan head, somewhat small with some lacing.  The taste and mouth feel tend to build, starting with a creamy caramel and malt but over a few sips the carbonation and coffee start to give a small bite."
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of chocolate, coffee. Taste is strong coffee, roasted malts, a bit of chocolate, some lingering bitterness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall a pretty good beer."
""
"Not really a stout person but I love green flash. Initially tastes like chocolate with a hint of coffee. And the chocolate taste lingers. Also has an alcohol taste that is sort overwhelming"

"Part of an eight pack assortment of apparent ass kicking ""double"" brewa, let's give it a whirl.  Popping the top I get a whiff of deep toasted malts and herbal hoppy undertones.  On the pour this brew is motor oil black with a huge dark tan head that really holds up.  On the taste this brew is richly heavy and very viscous with a nice balance of roasted malts with a tinge of a hop bite.  The taste stays more prominently malty throughout with a sweet kick at the end followed by a flat bitter aftertaste.  No where at all is the 8.8% ABV detectable.  This is a fine brew but the ABV must be sneaky to say the least."

"Deep black opaque color brown head.  Poured from a bottle.  Wonderful aroma: vanilla, coffee, chocolate, butterscotch.  Sweet taste, some roasty coffee notes.  Wonderful chocolate, toffee, coffee flavor.  Finishes of so slightly bitter.  This seductive beer could get you in trouble.  It has 8.9% alcohol but it is smooth and not boozy at all.  One of the best imperial stouts I've had ď and this is a style I drink a lot of"

"Great beer, awesome roasted coffee aroma. Very dark in color with a very very dark head. I really like the roast coffee and chocolate flavors combined with the sweet malt flavors. It is a very rich beer and you can't even tell it's 8.8%.  The whole beer is very balanced overall no flavors overpowering  another."
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty good beer. I love the English touches although I must say I still prefer Samuel smith."
""
""
""
"Pours black with a three finger light brown head. Smell is very sweet, slightly roasty. There is mild coffee flavor and heavy chocolate. The flavor follows the smell very closely. It has a nice, thick mouthfeel. As it warms up a fantastic smokey, tobacco flavor emerges."

"Complex and intense, delicious and satisfying. Its character changes over time without becoming less enjoyable. The aroma is appetizing with molasses and mesquite, chocolate and coffee. And there is lots of rich, silky malt in the flavor along with hints of coffee and cocoa."

"Overall, some nice things going on but doesn't seem a coherent whole and there is a bit of a burnt taste that I'm not fond of. There are much better Imperial Stouts in the same price range."

"This is a very well made stout.  Very smooth a full bodied, with a good coffee bitterness that lingers in your mouth well after the sip.  Close overall to FBS."

"I'm not big on stouts but this will get me to look at more.  Toasty, Carmel, some type of darker fruit with a hop hint.  Two finger brown head.  Mouthfeel is perfect!  can't get any smoother with a hop hint.  I like."
""
""
""
""
"Delicious. My first foray into Green Flash's stuff and it's damn near a home run. Not something I would sit and drink several of, but an excellent Imperial Stout that doesn't let the alcohol content overwhelm its complex flavors, as many other Imperials do."

"One of the best double stouts  Ive tasted. Not quite a Bourbon County but fairly close. Similar to Bells Expedition Stout."

"Hearty beer. Pours thick with thick head. Classic flavors, slightly bitter, slightly sweet but it's very subtle. And a coffee like background."

"Really good double stout. Nice toasted burnt malt character and hops at the end. Standard black coffee in the nose but not as much as expected in the taste. Alcohol only slightly noticeable, big carbonation, medium mouthfeel."

"This is a well-crafted, straight forward imperial stout, and is an excellent representative thereof. It's not overly hoppy, letting the bitterness of the roasted malt carry the balance. It has a depth of flavor that is delicious without being overpowering. I think this is an excellent brew, offered at an excellent price point."
""
"It was a good Stout. Nothing to write home about. I'm not sure how amazing it was though considering I'm not a big Stout drinker, so I may have to revisit it at a later date."

"Perhaps not well suited for this hot Summer's day so perhaps I'll save my other 3 bottles for a chilly evening, well priced for the quality I'll be buying this one again."

"Pours a black brew with a medium beige head with regular retention, aroma is moderate to heavy sweet and moderate bitter with caramel, vanilla, chocolate, alcohol and coffee, medium to robust bodied, flavor is moderate to heavy sweet and moderate bitter with a bittersweet finish, and quite tasty. Fine body with a long and smooth aftertaste of light barley and coffee. So very nice."

"O: A good beer. However, I've tasted stouts similar to it and was therefore bored with the flavor. Still good, however."
""
""
"Great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad. I may just not be in a stout mood tonight so I'll be as objective as I can be. This beer is pretty awesome. Not the most complex beer you'll ever have, but it is well made for the style. The only thing I didn't like was the booziness, but it wasn't overpowering."

"Overall, a quite solid Imperial Stout – I would definitely seek again and enjoy it on a regular basis."

"And, of course, that's what happened here. Big double coffee and charred barley up front, then things appeared to fizzle. Although I don't know if they actually fizzled that badly or if they just appeared to since that's what I was expecting them to do."

"This beer poured black with a light tan head. When held up to the sun, the edges show a dark reddish brown hue. The head disappears into a tan halo with a light cloudy cover over the top. The head and legs are slick and fine. The micro/fine bubbles seem to melt off of the sides as I move the beer around in the glass. The smell is rich and smells faintly of fresh baked sourdough bread, some raisins, some coffee, and a distant dark/bitter chocolate smell. The taste is complex in a way and not disappointing. There is a balanced mix of roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate, sweet raisins, and coffee. This stout has a medium body and a drier finish. I don't understand why they call it Double Stout..."

"This is a solid double stout... nice balance, pretty in the glass, nice roasty notes and clean bitterness. Everything I like in a deep, dark brew. Definitely will show up in the rotation. Green Flash was one of the breweries that got me into craft, and they have not disappointed yet."
"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours very black and opaque with a lot of dark tan head. Leaves a solid lacing all around the glass. The taste is more hops that malt which leaves a slight lingering bitterness. Overall it is smooth and refreshing but definitely has more characteristics of a Black Ale than a Double Stout."

"Pours to a dense tan head and opaque ruby black color. Aroma is loaded with vanilla, esters, roasty grains and sweet, sweet EtOH. Flavor is a complex yet easygoing blend of roast, smoke, spice, vanilla and balancing bitterness. Mouthfeel is very good, warming. You can feel the alcohol in a good way. Overall, pure hot sex in a glass."

"This stout really surprised me. As a fan of Green Flash, I've always known them for hoppy west coast beers, I didn't expect such a smooth, complex, enjoyable stout. This one pours a jet black hue with a thick lasting ta n head and creamy lacing. The aroma is a sweet rich blend of chocolate, coffee, caramel, vanilla, and a little smokiness. The body is creamy and luscious. Flavor follows the nose only even more rich and complex. Reminds me of some of the special stouts from Southern Tier. This was damn goid and may even become my new go to stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle. Black colour, with an enormous brownish head that last for long good while and leaves a milky lace. My first thouhgt was ""What's that horrible smell? It's like smelling ink. Now, just leave it aside for a while and it opens to chocolate, vanilla, coffee, liquorice, raisins, brandy... and milk. A really creamy palate, plus a medium to full body makes you really enjoy it. Taste is as smell: milk chocolate, vanilla, raisins, brandy, coffee. Really great."

"green flash, more known by me for their IPAs. this one is actually well done, light roasted chocolate and bready nose, medium full mouth feel with good balance of bitter dark chocolate and roasted coffee notes. really well done stout, highly drinkable, slightly dry and bitter"
""
""
"O - Overall the taste was good but the smell was to much to over come, I do not think I will purchase again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall it's a very good beer. I'm not sure what's going on in the scent department. That metallic note is off-putting but it's still a good beer. Stout lovers or those who enjoy a good cup of espresso will find this a very enjoyable beer. Overall the scent is really what takes this beer down a notch. It looks perfect in the glass, tastes and feels outstanding."

"O: This is right on the border of too bitter for me. It might stack up as I continue along - but it is not overwhelming at first. This is a very coffee forward stout. I enjoy the strong coffee tones and the head that stays for the entire time."

"O: a decent straight-up stout, 'doubled' in composition and output - what more is there to say... does happen to stand out among other strong, American stouts... could be a killer export stout if just a touch sweeter"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's an interesting beer, has it strong points but there are also some things that bother me, the aggressive bitterness ruins the whole image of milky, warm beer that is created in the smell. It starts as a very balanced, smooth, pleasant but then kicks you. Maybe that works for some. Is this the real life?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I like it, it's a pretty complex stout with some attitude. Is it my favorite, no, but is it good, absolutely! I do think most decent home brewers, including myself, could replicate this so it's not spectacular. But the price is good and the quality is good , so go get some damn it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There is zilch remarkable about this beer; it's the Mark Lemke of big stouts. Recognizable, not too bad, has some legs, but really, you're just waiting for something that performs better to come along & take it's place. Routinely good."
""
"Thick lacing and a medium, creamy body with little carbonation - Fantastic!"
""
"Overall - A very good Impy stout and another fine brew from Green Flash... definitely worth a try..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Zero flaws in this one. A shining example of an american imperial stout."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer, but when it comes to the style it's not too memorable and I would say it's just barley an above average example of the style, but with so many high quality Double and Imperial Stouts this one gets lost. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't the smoothest, it was a little rich and creamy and it was a little filling, the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, but I think the alcohol flavor would start to wear one me if I have more than one so I think one would be my limit. What I like the most about this beer was the appearance and that it was still fairly true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was that the alcohol wasn't hidden as well as I would have liked, I've had 12% beers that didn't taste as boozy. I wouldn't buy this beer again and I don't think I would recommend it, it's pretty forgettable when it comes to the style and it's not hard to find a better Imperial Stout. All in all I thought this beer was fairly solid, but it's nowhere near my favorite of the style but it is one of the better Green Flash beers that I've had, but I still can't say I'm a fan of this brewery. This was a solid attempt at the style, but with a little work this could be a better beer, better luck next time guys."

"Double Stout Black Ale from Green Flash Brewery in San Diego, CA. Nice 8.8% ABV. Pour dark black with a foamy thick brown head. A very smooth mouth feel with a roasted malt/chocolate start and a mildly bitter coffee finish. I very balance Imperial Stout that hides the 8.8% ABV well. Well worth a try if you enjoy stouts or porters."

"Rich and full flavor of cocoa and hops upfront, morphing to roasted malt, espresso, licorice and molasses. Firm bitterness from the roast and the hops. Subtle pine and citrus emerges through the rich dark malt in the finish. Moderately full mouthfeel. Excellent beer."
"Pours a very dark brown/black with a 2-finger beige head that settles down to just the top and sides of the glass. LOTS of lacing is seen. One of the most I have seen in a good while actually. Perfect carbonation. The aroma is very pleasing with hints of coffee and chocolate roasted malt. The taste is the same and goes down easy. No harsh or bitter aftertaste at all. Overall a fantastic Stout."

"Enjoyed a bottle poured into an English pub glass. Let's do this. A dark reddish brown to black brew, with a solid brown head. Smells roasted, dark, and rich ... Yet surprisingly vibrant and fruity at the same time. Brace yourself, this one's got layers and layers of flavor. Initial blast is a malt bomb, cacao and dark molasses, accompanied by a nice deep smoky note. Once the palate acclimatizes to this, you might get some sweet brown flavors like toffee and whiskey, with the rich sweetness revealing itself over time. Some fruity grape juice peaks at you and then disappears. A search reveals some floral tobacco notes and a tinge of licorice, even as the overall vibe remains quite sweet rather than super dry and chalky like an Irish stout. Is that some gooseberry-type American hops?? Veers towards chocolate milk for a moment and then darts away; as I try to re-focus I get some red berry and watermelon, I swear to God. This one is fruity 'till the (fairly) bitter end. Not a ton of coffee roasted notes but oh wait, there's a little light roast and a subtle floral rosewater and crabapple effect. Holy shit, what a great complex stout. Bright and fruity for an ""imperial"" and one can plumb the deep, dark depths for all kinds of fresh flavors. One can taste the hops but not in a way that clashes with the dark malts. Dare I say the body is on the light side for the style, creamy, smooth, with more carbonation that many dark brews? Almost could pass for an ""Imperial dark IPA"" if the hops delivered more citrus and pine character. Magic."

"O-a singular beer for sure. Your pallet is hit by a ton of sweetness and bitterness all at once, but manages not to overwhelm."

"O - quite possibly my favorite Green Flash beer which is saying a whole lot given I have overly enjoyed everything I've had from them. Just a fantastic outfit that create top shelf brews with the best of them. One of the best non barrel aged big stouts being created today. A real stunner."

"It has a surprisingly sweet taste. It's kind of like bubblegum, watermelon, grape all mixed together. Smoothish, with a slight sour bite to it. It's not at all what I was expecting. No real hop presence. It's not bad, but it's not my style for a black ale."

"A pretty tasty, um, ""Black Ale", one which exhibits a whole lot of sturdy and stoic imperial stout goodness, full stop. Dense (in the good way), complex, and yet strangely drinkable, at least until your desire for yet another bottle from that 4-pack proves to be your undoing for the night."

"Very imposing pour, as the solid black body was topped with a two finger thick, khaki colored, head. The look was pitch perfect for the style. The smell strongly of coffee, chocolate, and toffee, and faintly of almonds. The taste was very evocative of coffee and chocolate as well, followed by a boatload of hops, then roasted grain astringency, and finally a brown sugar sweetness. The mouthfeel was creamy and thick. This was a heck of a beer."

"This really is a decent stout and I probably would have scored higher if this wasn't the first beer I sampled after FIS."
""
""
"Pitch black pour with a two finger caramel-colored head with decent retention and great lacing. Roasty, malty nose with hints of coffee, subtle chocolate, and not much else. The taste is much bolder with lots of roasty coffee along with hints of toffee, caramel, vanilla, subtle smoke, espresso, cocoa, and bitter dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with decent balance and a fairly dry, bitter finish. Overall, this is a very solid and drinkable stout, but nothing all that special..."

"Overall, I think this is a great beer. I believe this could be a better beer if the mouthfeel were actually a touch thinner so I could get more flavor out of the beer, but it's pretty incredible as it is. I'd definitely buy it again."
"Final Thoughts: Not completely impressed with this one but a good stout from a brewery that's more notable for their IPAs. Would I drink it again? Maybe."
""
""
""

"I have to say, that compared to other beers in it's class (American Stout), this is a quintessential example of the big bold West Coast style. I would definitely buy it again. Very well done."

"Overall, this beer might have seen better days in terms of look and feel, but the flavor is mostly all there. The nose is downright sexy. The beer is not too sweet and finishes rather dry. It would probably make for a nice complement to a really rich, sweet desert like cheesecake."

"Impressive - a big stout with a big flavour. Looks the part, while the aroma and flavour are replete with roasted malt, burnt grain and molasses. Some mild staleness but this doesn't detract from the experience. Decent body, though could be a shade thicker. A great stout with plenty of character - worth sampling if you have the chance."
""
"Burnt motor oil appearance with a quarter inch of rich mocha froth that persists leaving sheets of lace. Smells of charred molasses and chocolate. Sub-notes of heavily roasted malt, pine, charcoal and figs. Taste is initially a heap of roasted/charred malt, dark semi-sweet chocolate, sweetness of caramel and molasses. Hop presence mingles with the semi-bitter chocolate nicely notes of pine and citrus are faint but the bitterness is altogether evident. TheNice layers of complexity develop once the initial chewing on pine cinders/burnt coals effect abates. Nice creamy mouthfeel in a medium-heavy body. Mild bitterness, char and chocolate linger on the finish."
""
""
""
"It lingers on the palate with a nice finish. There is a definite strong and complex flavor with an ever so slight bitterness and brightness mixed with a malty sweetness. I really like this one, and it ranks at one of the top stouts that I've tried."
"Overall: A pretty solid stout. Doesn't quite feel imperial but it has some good roasty and creamy flavors."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 8/30/2014. Pours dense pitch black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, char, toast, caramel, oats, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt notes with a fair amount of hop presence; and good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, char, caramel, oats, floral, light pine, and floral/roasted earthiness. Fair amount of pine/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, char, roasted malt, toast, oats, caramel, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt flavors; with a moderate hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, chalky, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial stout. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt and moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: I picked this guy up six months ago and thought, heck with it, I'mma sit on it another 6 months because, why not. Point is, I don't have a fresher sample to compare side by side.

"Pours black with large mocha head. Smells of roasted, almost smokey, malt, slight coffee and a tinge of bittersweet chocolate. Taste is largely roasted malt. Not super sweet, with some hop bitter going on. Mouthfeel isn't super heavy. Nice long roasty cocoa aftertaste. A very nice double stout that keeps the sweetness in check. Yummy! I was very impressed by this one."

"O. I bought this on a whim and was pleasantly surprised at how drinkable this stout is. The sweetness vs. bitterness is just about perfect. Priced competitively too. I will be keeping a few of these on-hand during the winter months."

"Overall pretty nice, the dark malts are very nice, fluffy, creamy, but dry and tasty, decent hop profile that doesn't get too crazy bitter or spicy that I expected for a Green Flash beer called ""black ale"". So pretty nice."

"Liquid black gold here! Bold presentation reinforced with delicious, bountiful spectrum of malt flavors. The hop bitterness tames the grain sweetness while the alcohol content remains in the background. Dark malts exude roasted grain and coffee character. An extremely tasty black ale heavy hitter..."

"Solid black with a rich and dense brown head that leaves lots of lacing. Smell is rich and roasty with coffee and chocolate notes on top of a mild smoke. Taste matches up with the smell. Very rich and deep flavor with some smoke up front, coffee roast and dark chocolate. Full feel with pillowy soft carbonation that coddles the palate. Overall, a wonderful imperial stout with so much depth. Great example of the style."

"The Stout poured a pitch black with a substantial tan head. The aroma was full of roasted malts and maybe a trace of hops. The taste was deep and complex with layers of nuttiness, chocolate and coffee undertones and more of the roasted malt flavor. For such a foreboding brew it had a medium body that I found to be easy to drink despite the full flavor profile that enveloped my palate. This was a great stout that I could drink regularly."

"O: This is a very bold beer when consumed fresh. Time mellowed out the bite of the hops significantly, and the alcohol is now an afterthought. The texture in particular made this beer a delight to sip."
""
""
""
"M&O: the mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth, rounded, not heavy at any time, the flavour profile is sound and balanced, not like one’s usual super-charged hop bomb even in the guise of a huge wizardry black robe. Have I mentioned alcohol, by the way? If not, then it is because it’s just hidden too well… All in all, this is a delicious strong stout not in one’s “Imperial” fashion in any sense, but a rather balanced and approachable one."
"Taste is strong, with a big chocolate taste. There is a little char underneath it all, but it's a subtle flavor. The high ABV is masked well here, too, and this is a superb, world-class double/imperial stout. I've yet to have a mediocre beer from the top-notch Green Flash!"

"I can't help but think of Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout or Founders Breakfast Stout, both of which I used to love, back before I'd had Mikkeler Black Hole, Founders Imperial Stout, Peruvian Morning, Blackout Stout, Speedway, Weyerbacher Tiny, and Southern Tier Mokah. Perhaps my problem is I've gotten spoiled by the higher-ABV of my favorite double stouts . . . ?"

Very good."

"Fabulous beer. I admit, I'm biased against things that smell not so good. I don't know the metric, even if I'd wanted to, of how to appreciate that kind of skank. I try to like limburger cheese; no can do. I digress. Poured this beer at a slightly warm temperature with a large, foamy, frothy, light tan head that pretty much lasted all the way down and a ton of lace. Color is an opaque brown black. Aroma is sweaty leather, funk, dirt, hop, malt. Flavor's like nose, but much more friendly. The aromatic qualities are muted and the oral attributes of sweetness, bitter, tang come out along with a bit o' smoke and dirty love. Body is exotically poifect. Finish is like all of the above, actually pleasant, and leaves me looking for more. Fantastic beer."

"Aged since Green Flash's launch in Florida - so it's no younger than Feb. 2012. This is one great looking stout, dark and imposing in the glass with a massive head for the style. The aroma is very smooth and roasty. After a bit of aging, Green Flash Double Stout has become a gentle giant. Creamy chocolate and roasted malts fully carry things, with a bit of sweetness peeking through at the end. Extremely drinkable. Overall, a really good, readily available, and cheap imperial stout. Pick up a four-pack and hide it for a year."
"We have stouts, Russian, oatmeal whatever. Then we have this untamed stallion. Tighten your belt and try to hold on for 8, % that is. This huge meal of a brew is so damn smooth that I was loving this hard, until number 3 then I had to step back out of pure respect. I don't go into the whole scientific break down of a beer. So let me just say this one is chocolate creamy velvet love in a bottle. Smells awesome, taste awesome. Fricken grand slam baby."
""
""
"Overall impression: A nicely crafted Imperial Stout. I like the drier roasty and chocolate character that I associate with Americanized stouts. Very complex and highly hopped. Great now and probably even better with some age."
"Overall: I really liked this one I picked up in Hudson. Nice flavor profile and very drinkable for a pretty big stout. The mouthfeel on this beer was great."

"O: Perfect in appearance, good in taste. The dryness & bitterness of the finish were a little more than I'd have liked, but a very good brew all in all."
"The tart cherry/raspberry notes are slightly overwhelming, but it lacks the acrid character present in some roast malt dominated examples. Chocolate and roast character are in good balance, and coffee isn't over the top. Wish the carbonation were lower. Bitterness is slightly higher than I'd prefer."
""

"Overall – A dark and drier Imperial stout with tons of roasted malt flavor and a decent bitter bite."

""
""
""
"O: Acceptable for style, but there are many better examples out there. Certainly not objectionable though."
"O: It’s a big beer, in every way, and the word ‘balanced’ doesn’t belong anywhere near it. It’s a celebration of dark, roasted malts and the flavor profiles that come with them. Those flavors really start to expand once the beer warms up a bit, too, allowing the more subtle, cocoa notes and a great dryness to come through. The end is absolutely incredible; bitter, dark chocolate with no hint of alcohol."

"To the Point: this is not for the faint of heart, if you like stouts that are big and bold this is for you and this one is for me"

""

"This is a very solid stout. Pours thickly with a nice medium brown head. So much so the last dribbles lie on the head like caramel on a latte. Looks very appealing. Smell is sweet and malty. Taste is full and deep with expected coffee bitterness, leaves a mild bitter chocolate on the finish. Very nice for a stout. I'm not sure why we've gone to double stout as a class. This is what a stout should be in my humble opinion. Lesser stouts should be re-classed as sorta stout maybe. Not overly complex to my palate although the label says ""Big, Bold, Complex"". I'll go with Big and Bold. I think it nails it quite nicely for its class and I like Green Flash. Here I'll digress momentarily to a deferential nod to their Palate Wrecker DIPA, it lives up to its name. Overall I like it and would readily recommend it to anyone looking for a very solid stout that hasn't already explored more avant-garde offerings."
"solid entry in this category. thick head dies down to thin ring around glass edge. lacing is a bit weak, i'd expect more from this. nose is not very prominent, not bad, just not much there. taste when chilled is bitter-ish chocolate and hint of coffee, but has sweetness as well. nicely balanced. as it warms, coffee is more pronounced. mouthfeel starts out very nice, a bit chewy, i like it. thins a bit when warm, a bit of booziness becomes apparent. too bad, it hides its abv well at first. would purchase again, though a bit pricey at $11 for 4, i'd say still a solid buy."
"Overall another great beer being shipped to Arkansas , and hey that makes me happy"

"O: I really enjoyed this. Will definitely have it again. Maybe not the most robust Double I've had but it was really enjoyable."

""
"Pours a beautiful jet black body with a finger thick light brown head. Great, consistent retention from the head. Smell is roasted malt dominated and a lot of booze with a hint of coffee . Taste is of roasted malt, coffee, and a hint of cocoa with a surprising hoppy kick. Alcohol is noticeable but is well hidden by the rich flavors. Mouth feel is quite smooth with good carbonation, maybe a bit too much. Overall this is another great brew from Green Flash. I love how drinkable, yet boozy it is. I just wish it had more of a noticeable coffee taste to it. On par with, or maybe even better than Stone Smoked Porter."

""
"Overall: Interesting mix of flavors, not bad but not my favorite from a style that is well represented elsewhere."
""
""
""
"O: this is a very delicious beer, smooth and with complicated nuances. The drying alcohol elicited the herbal flavors very nicely, and complimented the roasted, chocolatey profile. I would definitely make this a regular, go to beer. I think this is stylisticly closer to a foreign export stout, but that's just my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a smooth drinking imperial stout. The alcohol is hidden, the flavors are balanced, and the experience is excellent. I prefer a more expressive imperial stout with more charred roast notes, but this beer hit its mark. "
""
""
"O: Overall, not a bad beer, but nothing special. I wouldnt actively avoid it, but I dont see myself purchasing this one again. Awesome lacing and wonderful smoothness bounce up the overall score."
"Purchased by the bottle (4pack) at Colonial on 3/10/13 and poured into a tulip. Pours the deepest of black with absolutely no light penetration, topped unceremoniously with a dark brown head the color of brown sugar and just the finest of lacing throughout the glass. The smell is all medium roast coffee and sweet milk chocolate with a touch of char to it. Hops are buried almost completely in the malt bill; maybe the faintest of citrus San Diego in there. The taste is a wonderful example of the natural form of a stout, full of that roasty coffee and milk chocolate on the nose, with just a hint of sweet citrus hops and alcohol heat on the back end. Full mouthfeel and maybe a little flat as far as carbonation goes. This is an overall great Imperial Stout, something I really want to try on tap and especially on NITRO; I think it would remarkably improve the beer for a whole new experience."

"Overall a nice double stout, not too complex but straight to the point."
""
""
"The beer pours a dull, dark black (not oily) with an impressive creamy tan head that laces. The nose is predominantly roasted malts, even at warmer temperatures, along with a bitter (not very descriptive to say ""bitter""...I know) aroma, which I'm attributing to the hops, and a pinch of ethanol. The taste is of salted milk chocolate and coffee upfront with a lingering roastiness and bitterness that coat the palate. This beer drinks smoothly with a cascade of stouty flavors in the forefront followed by a relatively dry, roasty, bitter finish. You're not aware of the beer's near 9% abv, even at warmer serving temperatures. I enjoy this beer and will almost certainly recommend it to others."
""
""
"Overall, this is my new favorite stout; it's perfect. It has all the good chocolatey/coffee notes and great malt presence without the assertive astringency. Reasonable price as well."
""
""
""

"O - The sweet chocolate notes and the smokey finish standout, a pretty nice winter beer and a good choice if in the mood for a imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
"D: This was a nice imperial stout with some unique character in the scent and taste. The body was solid, and it hid the alcohol pretty well. But the finish was robust, so it was better to sip. Could probably age ok, but also good fresh."
""
""
""
"It's probably a perfect ""everyday-drinkin'"" stout."

"Really let down by this one. Love their IPA's- no mouth feel on this though- which is a major factor for stouts- or should be. Nice RIS taste, but not much else. In one of my favorite styles (as it is for many of us at BA)- but will stick with Old Rasputin, McNeills, Stone or Founders since they are all readily available in these parts and better. Watery= fatal flaw."

""
"This pours a dark brown color with a frothy, brown head. The scent is of malts and other robust aromas. The texture is silky smooth like a well made barrel-aged stout. There is a complex concoction of malts, grains, and hints of spice. Rather well made and a great find. This is a stellar stout especially considering the price."

"I also did not detect as much chocolate this time. I will be honest to say that tonight we tasted two stouts, one known for its chocolate tones. So, it might have been the first one with loads of chocolate, and now the Double Stout leaving me somewhat wanting for more."
"This is definitely one to keep in mind when you want a great American stout."
""
"Poured entire bomber into 34oz mug. Oily black with a thick, foamy tan head that stays full for a long time, leaving some sticky lacing on the mug. Smells amazing in the bottle: coffee and chocolate. Once poured it smells a lot more metallic, but that's probably the hops sneaking through. Taste follows the great smell; creamy and smooth, coffee and bitter chocolate witha smooth finish, hops just lingering on the back of the tongue. Overall this is a great beer, one of the best American imperial stouts I've had."
""
""

"O - pretty good, after drinking the abomination that is le freak this is a solid entry in the imperial stout style for green flash and I am impressed. It defiantly is more on the hoppy and and is a good option when you want a dryer imperial stout."

"Black with three fingers of mocha foam that dies down in a few minutes leaving a quilt of the same. Crazy lace. Smells of hops (pine, weed) then a huge malt presence. Molasses, cocoa, licorice, coffee and a bit of milk chocolate are all very strong. Flavor is sweet, coffee grounds and bitter all at once; not sure I like the juxtaposition versus a well integrated profile. Some molasses, dark figs and a little hershey syrup in there. When this beer first entered my lips, I noticed the body - it seemed thin and flat, then I gave it a light swish and some carb came out. Overall the body was poorly constructed with a lower than anticipated (even for a stout) and no body to back it up with a dry finish. Meh, has stuff going for it, but not that all impressed."

"Pours dark brown with a tan head. Lots of retention and lace. Aroma is chocolate, and roasted coffee. Body is creamy,and smooth with some carbonation. Taste is of malted dark semi sweet chocolate. Hints of roasting throughout. Right up there with some of the best."

""

"Highly recommend its a great winter beer to warm you up"

"Pours black with a really nice brown head which leaves some wonderful lacing. The smell is fairly light and mostly of darker roasted malts and some hints of vanilla jumping out at me. The taste has more kick with dark chocolate and the roasted malts being the backbone with a lingering bite from the subtle hopping. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy excellent for the style and it has a nice drinkability to it. Not as good as the IPA's from Green Flash but a solid offering."
""
""
"Pours a hazy dark brown with two fingers thick dense tan head, settles slowly to a thin ring, leaving a spray of lace on the glass. Smell: toasted and buttered dark bread, black plum, moderate roast, earthy, hint of wood smoke. Taste: bready, plum, maybe fig, mild roast, caramel, hopping is earthy, mildly grassy and citric. Feel is quite creamy, finishing drying with light residual sweetness. This is odd to review. Enjoyable beer, but not an impy stout."

"Taste is full and strong but simple and lacking in complexity. It is creamy, bittersweet, rich chocolate with hint of coffee, brandied prunes and wet singed leaves. It has a lingering burnt-leaf bitterness at finish. There is really nothing else. Compared to Guinness Foreign Extra Stout, for example that beer is far more complex and interesting and well-rounded than this on comparable (in fact slightly lower) abv. This has strong roasty-chocolatey elements but really nothing else."
""
""
""
"Large dark tan head on a jet black body. Aroma of vanilla, roasted malts, and milk chocolate. Flavors of roasted malts, vanilla, both milk and dark chocolate, hint of pine hops, raisin and coffee. Very smooth and creamy with light to moderate carbonation. Overall this one is complex, very clean tasting with a mouthfeel making it incredibly enjoyable and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Terrific stout, sweet dessert profile that pairs wonderfully with chocolate. Very well integrated and executed by Green Flash. Creamy mouthfeel and a treat to drink."
"this is a delicious strong stout with a rich creaminess to it that makes it a perfect dessert beer. really enjoyable after a year of aging."
""
""
"O- this is one dark and smoky stout. Complex flavors but well balanced throughout, this one is definitely a sipper. Great pick for a cold December night."
""
"O: A pretty good double stout with plenty of nice coffee and chocolate flavor."
"Had this on tap at engine 15.... this brewery never lets me down.. everything they do is solid... beatiful looking stout... smells big. Huge roasted malt aromas... lots of chocolate and coffee flavors... nice bitter backend... nice hop presence in a stout and backed up with a huge rich body as this style should have"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Wow. Really nice balanced stout. I was suprised by this one so I thought I should review it. It's one of the better balanced stouts I've had recently. Considering picking up a 4 pack now."
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the better stouts I've tried. Another winner from Green Flash."
""
""
""
"(EDIT:) Still massive amounts of lacing with only about eight ounces left. It's all there on this one."
""
"A bit too acrid and rough around the edges for my taste, but if you like the sound of a hop-bombed coffee stout, give this one a shot."
""
"I think this is my first non-IPA from Green Flash that I have reviewed. And it kicks ass. It's not particularly earth-shattering, but it's better than some more expensive, harder-to-get alternatives. Beyond a solid choice, definitely worth a try."

"Smooth and goes down real easy. Not too thick and heavy, not too sticky, not too burnt tasting."
""
""
""
""
""
"o - really solid stout that left me wanting another one."
""
""
"Suprisingly light for an imperial stout. Brisk carbonation, same flavors that are on the nose, a bit of astringent coffee. Thin and burnt tasting, not really understanding the high rating on this one. Earthy bitterness that doesn't really compliment the other flavors. The one upside is you can't detect the 8.8% other than that though not a good beer. Harsh astringent and with flavors that dont meld."
""
""
"O: This beer is a bit on the dry side and quite bitter. The dark chocolate flavor is quite nice, but more sweetness and thickness would help. This would also add to the complexity, which is also lacking."
""
""
""
"A complex flavor that continues to evolve though the glass. Heavy on body and flavor yet drinkable. I like the hop bitterness and it should short age well. All flavors are spaced well so the beer never gets old, boring or cloying. Excellent stuff."
""
""
"M - Medium body with subdued carbonation--a good thing for this beer IMO. Finish is silky with only a touch of acidic/astringent bite. Booze is noticeable in the finish, but just as a subtle warmth."
""
""
"Medium body and carbonation; somewhat lively in the mouth and not particularly thick or heavy. This is an excellent beer; it hits all the right stout flavor notes without clubbing you over the head with booze or a heavy duty feel. A great middle-of-the-road imperial, and not in terms of quality but rather size. 12 oz bottle and affordable price tag don't hurt either."
"O: A very solid imperial stout. Very drinkable and clean."
""
"This is a very drinkable stout. I am impressed."
"Great beer overall, with not a single complaint; not even a minor grievance. Perhaps the reasonable price also plays a small role in my conclusion. It's got great flavor and aroma when at a cool temp and opens up a bit more as it warms. The mouth feel is exquisite and for a powerful ABV. at 8.8%, there really wasn't any booze-ish taste to it at all. However, it sure warms the belly and i'm sure will creep up on those willing to indulge. A new beer to me and it leapfrogged instantly to one of my favorites."

"Wow, I'm gonna pull out the Chandler Bing fill-in-the-blanks quote and go with ""Could this beer *BE* anymore up my alley???"". I've always been a fan of the super dark malty stuff, and it doesn't get much darker or maltier than this DS. So glad I can get it up here in Vic on a regular basis. The aroma is sweet chocolate malt, with a little bit of roastiness. The body is Thick & Heavy, with capitals T & H, respectively. The mouthfeel is so full and flavourful that you can tell this isn't your regular ordinary run-of-the-mill stout, it is obviously a Double, and a well-crafted one at that. As soon as this brew hits your tongue, cue the silky chocolate overload, followed by a sweet roasted coffee/cocoa finish. And don't forget the booze, that mild dry alcohol flavor balances the sweetness nicely, and leaves your tastebuds wondering ""What the hell just happened?"". Not for the faint of heart, or anyone who is New-to-the-Brew. Take it from me, you'd better work your way up to this one."
""
"Overall: outside of the monsters this is a good a stout as I've had."
"D - Pretty nice, there is a lot of dark sugar and roast with a good balance between sweet, sugary notes and bitter grain. The finish is just dry enough to keep it balanced and drinkable while the licorice and coffee work nicely to keep it interesting."
""
""
"O: Solid impy stout, creamy and soft, heavy on the sweet oats and cocoa, and a good dose of smoke."

"Overall a great stout for the price, a little light for an imperial, but tastes great. I am very pleased with this one and will certainly be grabbing this again."

""
"Drinkability: Meh. It smells awesome but I was expecting a little more in terms of flavor. It is pretty bold, though."
""
"o pretty good. an inexpensive, easy to find stout i would drink again. the thing that most impresses me is that a 9% has no booze flavor or scent at all. excellent."
""
""
""
""
"It's listed as an American imperial stout on here, but it tastes very close to the classic RIS style. This is a very good imperial stout, and it's available in 4 packs at a reasonable price. Best of all, it's now available in Florida!"
""
""
"I liked it: another Californian I'd happily have again."
""
"It says in the guidelines that 5's should be rare, so i gave a couple of 4.5's as I am not an expert in beer tasting I cant grade mouth feel or smell but I can't imagine any possible improvement to the taste and apperance, so overall it has to be a 5 in my book. Welcome to Florida Green Flash."
""
"O- I really love this beer. Easily my favorite by Green Flash so far. Big, malty, complex yet somehow completely cohesive. They didnt just go swinging big, they plotted and planned and delivered delivered a single knockout blow."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into ommegang-style tulip at Lagers in Metarie, LA. Pours a deep black/brown color with slight tan head. Smells of bitter coffee and roasted malts with slight hop aromas and chocolate. Taste is bitter roasted malts, some coffee and chocolate, and a trace of dried fruit - but I maybe wishing it. Its a good double stout, but I like my double stouts a little more intense. This just felt a little lacking in flavor and wow factor to be amazing...but it is very good and Id have again."

"Green Flash Double Stout is a welcome harbinger of colder weather. While not reaching the same heights as other strong stouts, this brew hits all the right notes. The alcohol is quite well masked, making for a brew that doesn't drink as strong as it is. Another top notch brew from the folks at Green Flash."
""
"Medium bodied with average carbonation, and a lot of dark roasted malt in the aftertaste. This is a decent stout, but not one of the best in its class."
""
""
"O: Here's a beer that drinks like it's twice as aged as it was. Coffee-heavy stouts like Velvet Merlin could learn a thing or two with the dry, but flavorful finish on this brew. Earthy and dry. A pleasure to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: The Double Stout seems to straddle the line between a regular and an Imperial Stout. It isn’t quite as rich as some Imperials, but it is far more complex than the average sessionable stout."
"Mouth feel is the only limiter on this beer. I found it to be on the dry side which I don't like personally. Alcohol is there aplenty but hidden. This is a good beer but I like the heavier body more creamy styles better."

"Overall- The beer needs a little work on the palate. If the understated chocolate and slightly fruity flavors could come forward and fight back against the forces of roast, this beer would be down right delicious."
"Must say, I'm impressed. Nice work, green..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Once again, green flash makes an amazing beer for an amazing price. This isn't something that will compare with the higher end imperial stouts but it'll definitely please you."
"Poured from bottle into Founders Snifter. Thick brown or mocha two finger head; some retention on glass. Very black in color, looks a bit like motor oil. Aroma is full of roasted coffee and malt, light sweetness and chocolate. Taste is similar, but tons of roasted flavor is most present -- coffee and malt. There is a certain degree of hop bitterness that I enjoy here as well. This beer is definitely ""chewy"" for an imperial stout. Mouthfeel is smooth, and dangerously drinkable, no noticeable ABV. Love the beer, must try for those who like the style. Will definitely seek out again. Cheers."
"This is a very dark, completely black brew,. The head is a tan, soapy consistency. It's a wonderfully aromatic stout...roasted...smokey, dark fruit skins, charcoal, coffee...dates, wood, slightly burnt grain. Sharp taste: sweet, with a touch of astringency from the burnt grain...full in flavor. Some warmth, but no real alcohol note. It's a full, jagged, but very engaging brew."

"Pours a black color. One inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, slight oatmeal, slight yeast, and hint of alcohol. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is also a slight dryness. Tastes of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, hint of hops, oatmeal, hint of alcohol, hint of earthy malt, and hint of yeast. Overall, great appearance, good aroma, body, and blend."

"Nice creamy feel to the body, with well-suited low carbonation."
""
""
""
"Sampled in an Ommegang Tulip. A hard pour produces a thick head of light brown rocky foam, great lacing as it settles out over very deep dark brown stouty-stout. I'm getting chocolate and roasted barley...very light coffee too in the nose, seems promising so far. Luxurious viscous mouthfeel with flavors of chocolate once again, malt sugar sweetness, a nice roasty sensation mingling with a not-over-the-top hopping...everything melds nicely. Chocolate again in the finish, then fades with a roasty note. Alcohol well masked in this one. Quality stuff."
""
""
"EDIT: Almost a year has done wonders. Huge vanillins dominate the nose (and are big in the flavor) and the hops are juicy, fruity, and delicious. Highly recommended. Would bump nose to 4.5, as well as taste."
""
""
"Hayward Abbey Rating: 90"
"Mouthfeel is creamy and very smooth, with mild carbonation that’s on the thin side, a medium body and slightly bitter finish that leaves a nice smoky aftertaste and a touch of booze. Very nice imperial stout that was easy to drink and got better as it warmed up."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours black like motor oil with a tall, tan head. the head retains very well, dissipating very slowly. Plenty of sticky lacing is left behind on the glass. There are aromas of dark roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee. It has the typical imperial stout smell that really opens up as it warms. The alcohol can also be picked up in the smell. The dark roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee flavors blend very well together in the mouth. The roasted malts leave a light aftertaste. There are also some hops in the back end, which balance some of those big flavors. The alcohol is well-hidden, but becomes more apparent as it warms up. The flavors become bolder as the beer warms. The body is medium to full with some carbonation. The finish is dry. The beer is creamy, though a bit on the thinner side of creamy. This helps the drinkability, but this is still a sipper. This is an excellent beer. While it's not quite as good as Old Rasputin, this is still a solid imperial stout."
" O: no my favorite stout, although it is deffinatly not a bad beer, of you look at the ratin this brew has after 500 reviews, i guess it's just not for me. It looks beautiful and smells beautiful bit the taste and mouthfeel were a bit off for me."

"Overall: This is one worth seeking out. Really delicious stout. Complex and easy drinking. Green flash nailed it."
"All-in-all, not a bad effort. However, I have certainly had better double stouts."
""
"Comes out of the tap a rich sable just a shade or two above pitch black with a thick, fine-bubbled tan head. Aroma has tones of roast coffee and unsweet chocolate, as well as a woody hint. Flavor has coffee, woody and chocolate notes, not quite as good as the aroma but still toothsome. Texture is firm and smooth, a little dusty, fairly fizzy."
"O. One of the best imperial stouts I have had that wasn't aged in a barrel. This is a steal considering its wide availability. For the money, I just don't think you can find a stout that offers more flavor and yet retains such evenness. Outstanding."
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large brown color head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of roasted malt with light fruity overtones and some residual sugar is quite pleasant. Taste is also a solid mix between some roasted malt with some black chocolate notes and some light fruity ester. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well brewed with solid malt backbone and not overly dry; in fact coffee-like notes are quite subtle."
""
""
""
"Overall: Really solid beer. Great value, competitive with Old Rasputin and other heavy hitter every-day stouts. Glad Green Flash has moved into CT. Might default to this beer in the winter if I'm not in the mood for Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An interestingly different double stout. The malt is nice but the beer is mostly notable for the big and bold hop profile in a style that doesn't often feature it. Good but not outstanding, worth coming back to now and again"
"This is nice and full bodied. The mouthfeel is soft and a little velvety. I really like this one. Good marks all around!"
""
""
"O: A fine American IS that hits a ton of different spots with the flavor. It is roast heavy, and had that been toned down, I would have liked it even more."
""
""
""
"Overall - I gotta be honest, for a double stout, I was expecting deeper, more darkly roasted malt, but this kicks like your regular oatmeal with a significant boost in the amount of hops. It's good, but not the 'kick in your pants' abyss deepness I was thinking it'd be. Does well to contain the high alcohol content."
""
""
""
"Overall a full flavored user friendly double stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There is nothing of great note here. It was an amped up version of a very traditional stout. All the flavors were there and it was highly drinkable. It's worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyed greatly."
""
""
"Overall a very good beer for the style, would definitely get again."
"Overall: Very happy with this, but a bit unbalanced for such a great brewery. If the alcohol were hidden a bit better, it'd be near perfect."
""
""
""

"A tasty Imperial Stout - not the greatest I've had but still very good. I'll drink this again for sure."
"A big, but balanced stout with definite west coast flair. Somehow manages to be dry, but also rich and creamy. Hops are big too, big and herbal, with a smack of leafy bitterness and black pepper and pine. We all the know malt aspect of the style - roasted malts with a bitter coffee flavor out front and center. We also all know the look - black as hell with that appetizing, rocky, sticky, espresso-esque head. Thanks Green Flash, for the seriously good beer at unhyped prices. $4.50 for a bomber of this seems too good to be true."
"O: Never had a smoother beer, especially at almost 9% ABV. This is downright dangerous. A bit heavy on the chocolate and light on the roast, though. I prefer the reverse. At any rate, this is a top shelf brew at a moderate price that should be stocked with regularity in one's beer fridge."
"A soft rewarding brew. Not bad at all."
"O- I really enjoyed this one. Lots of dark fruit flavors like belgian dark ale and not much chocolate and no roasted qualities. I wonder if this was an older bottle, but it was still good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Seattle roast coffee grounds and some oarnge peel bitterness combine right off the bat. Lots of Dark roasty flavors from start to finish. Add to that some predominant hopping and you have some bitterness interplay from the malt and hops. This is a great, flavorful, bitter, and malty sipper. The alcohol is mixed in with the beers flavor very well. Helps to enhance everything."
"355ml bottle. Tumbler glass. Enjoyed on apr´12. Pure black in color with a tan crown. Froth lasts while stays as a thin layer on top remaining ´til the end. Some collars & spots on sides. Aromas show roasted malts, yeast & subtle hoppiness, fruity touch & cocoa with dark fruit notes. Gentle toasted malts, low bitterness & black chocolate touch at first sip. Slightly puckering & spiced sensation in the middle. Full body, moderate carbonation. Dry roasted malt finish. Fruits & malts on the aftertaste with underliying hoppiness. Very pleasant & smooth drinkability. ABV is well hidden. Flavorful beer. Green Flash has never disappointed me!"
""
""
""
"What a really nice stout. I was expecting a lot of bittering hops coming from Green Hops Brewing Co. but this was well-balanced. Sometimes too much hops is too much hops. This was a really nice stout though. It was jet black and lacking a thick head but delicious, refreshing, and very full flavored. Something more than a chocolate malt ale that a lot of people brew as a stout."
"The body is full and robust with soft carbonation. Overall this one is good. A bit on the hoppy side but another solid effort from these guys."
""
""
"Overall: Well crafted specimen of beer, full body and very rich. Watch a movie and enjoy. Salud!"
"Green Flash Double Stout pours a deep pure black with a thick brown head. Strong aromas of dark chocolate. This beer is rich, smooth, creamy, full bodied, with a soft mouthfeel. Very well balanced, the alcohol is present but offset well with typical stout flavors of chocolate, coffee, and low bitterness. Nothing incredibly complex here, just a solid, well balanced stout that I could enjoy again and again. Overall this beer hits the mark as an american double stout, and I would recommend it to anyone."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was very nice, but absolutely has to warm up a bit!"
""
""
""
"A nice looking stout. Nice roasted tones on the nose. But the best thing about this beer is that it's so smooth. Nice and even and easy to drink. And the alcohol is well masked as well, which makes a big difference since this is such a high abv brew."
"Pours a opaque black with a three finger beige frothy head. Considerable lacing, as the head recedes, especially for a imperial/double stout. Aromas of chocolate, anise, and roasty malt flood the nostrils. The initial taste of chocolate and a touch coffee flows into dark fruit and anise and finishes with roasty bitterness, very complex. Exceptional mouthfeel creamy and full bodied. A truly exceptional brew."

"Very nice so green flash is about 50/50 now..."
""
""
""
"O- good imperial stout. Almost a black ipa."
""
"Nice. Green Flash’s Double Stout is a little heavy, but I dig the flavor."
"Pours an opaque black with a thick rocky coffee colored head. Smells sweet and dark chocolatey, there are also some fruity notes in the background that make the beer very appetizing. Bittersweet dark chocolate dominates the taste buds with some coffee and herbal hops. The beer is thick and silky with moderate carbonation and a dry finish but seems to thin out mid-swallow. This is a top notch stout and I could drink a few of these."
""
""

""
"O: An outstanding stout. perhaps my favorite to date. Green Flash is a strong brewery that keeps kicking out great beers."
""
""
""

"This isn't a bad beer but it is overly fruity and lacking complex roast malt and chocolate for my taste."
""
""
""
"O: Double Stout is quite a different animal than I expected, especially after my long night yesterday with Doris (THE DESTROYER); that said, I really like it. It’s well-balanced beer, with a nose you’d just love to swim around in and a palate that hits the spot without overdoing anything. I’m not sure I’d age this one, but I definitely would take a few more bottles – and happily, at that."
""
""
"O - All the elements I described above come together for a great beer! If you love the battle of coffee and dark chocolate in a beer, then this is for you."
""
"O: really good stout; mildly dry milky finish to this softly sweet beer adds nice character"
""
""
""
"O/D - I enjoyed this stout. Easy drinking, complex, rich. I usually drink alot faster than I did with this bottle. I found myself sipping and savouring it for a fair bit of time on a cool evening. Soothing blackness from Green Flash."
""
""
""
"I'm wishing I'd of picked up a few more, it's suiting my mood perfectly at the moment."
""
"Beer is medium-heavy with moderate carbonation. Bubbles ""feel"" small, so beer is not prickly on the palate. Carbonation leads beer to foam up at first on mouth, then when dissipated, it rolls smoothly along for a nice, creamy mouthfeel. Finish is dry and slightly sticky."
"Overall: I got this as an extra and I was really impressed with this. Seriously one of the best non BA stouts i've had in a while. There is a great chocolate and espresso combination and the alchohol level is spot on."
""
""
"O - Very enjoyable stout. Don't know how a fresh bottle would compares, but this holds up well."
""
"O - Enjoyed it more from the bottle than on-tap; perhaps because the food aromas in the restaurant were interfering. It's not overly complex but this is worth drinking, especially if you are looking for a dark/burnt stout experience."
""
"Really a great, rich, tasty stout."
"O - A nice bold flavorful double stout, definitely a fan. Should be a fun 64 oz's."

"This is a very good stout. Reminds me a bit of Old Rasputin. After a good experience with Green Flash's IPA and now this, I will definitely keep an eye out for more of their stuff in the future."
""
""
"There's a small amount of chewiness to the mouthfeel, but it's not quite as thick as you want it to be. Still, it's on a mouthfeel par with, say, Old Rasputin (which is this beer's closest, most accurate comparison/competition). Overall, it's a good imperial stout in a market that's full of great ones. A decent buy in 4-packs, but I'd probably buy Old Rasputin first at a similar price point."
"Low carbonation, medium bodied and quite creamy, even chewy. Delightful feel. Not quite a world-beater but a very fine stout to be sure. Green Flash are quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries. 4/5 beers or better across the board."
""
"O: A solid representation of the style, and sets middle of the road between a Russian Imperial and sweeter takes on the stout."
""
"A damn good stout, but my own PERSONAL taste likes more flavors. Don't get me wrong, this is very well done. Would grab again."
"Good stuff. Really hits the spot."
""
"O- An awesome stout."
""
"This is a nice stout, very drinkable with some nice flavors. Old Raspy is still the standard, IMHO."
""
"Medium-to-firm mouthfeel and full body. There is a nice sweet toasted malt backbone with a fairly strong bitter coffee accompaniment. There is also just a faint touch of licorice. The flavor is fairly well-balanced, but leans a bit towards the bitter coffee notes, making the beer more of a sipper. The finish is quite dry and the coffee flavors linger nicely in the mouth. Overall, a nice American Double Stout. Enjoyable, fairly complex, and easy to find."
"Overall: a great tasting and solidly crafted double stout. I'd definitely have this again."
""
"O: The taste doesn't really do it for me, but the rest of the aspects of this beer are pretty good. If you're into the intensely bitter coffee stouts, this one may be worth seeking out."
""
"Wow what a nice stout. Pours pitch black with a tall toffee colored head that leaves a nice lacing. I smell roasted grains with a sweet hint of molasses and dried fruits. A very nice bitterness here that's balanced well by a rich sweetness. I really like the way this beer develops in the mouth. A very pleasing silky texture followed by a second release of carbonation in very fine texture. I would rate this right up there with Stone Russian Imperial Stout. Highly recommended."
""
"O - I really enjoyed the simple flavors of the beer. The dark chocolate, charcoal, herbal hop, and warming alcohol. I liked that the beer wasn't overly sweet, or over hopped for the style. So I'd buy it again once in a great while I guess. Cheers!"

"Moderate carbonation with a light presence on the tongue relative to the style. Great flavors but not all that well-rounded. Would drink again but there are plenty of other beers that are better for this style."
"O - This is a phenomenal beer from Green Flash. It was very full flavored and remarkably smooth. Reasonably priced at $7/bomber. I will certainly get this again."
""
""
""
"Pours a thick dark brown with a mocha two-finger head with good retention. Notes of chocolate rum balls in the bouquet. Alcohol obscures any other fragrances that might otherwise be present. Very creamy and smooth mouthfeel. A bit of an alcohol burn from start to finish. Sweet vanilla and chocolate up front. Finishes with a thin plastic and chocolate bitterness. Just ok. Doesn't deliver the big, bold, and complex that's advertised on the label."
""
""
"12oz bottle. Pours a brackish black with a half inch of brown head. Some lacing. Aromas of roasted malts, smoke, coffee, chocolate and earthiness. Flavors of dark chocolate, black coffee, roasted malts and a bit of a smoky finish. Heavy bodied with little carbonation. Heavy mouthfeel as well. Pretty good Imperial Stout. Worth having again."
"O - A good stout."
"Poured into a Stone Brewing flute glass. Pours a very dark brown, appearing black. Massive three finger, fine medium brown head that dissipated slowly leaving nice lacing. Looks great. Aroma of spicy roasted malt and dark dry fruit. Somewhat muted, probably because of the thick head. Flavor is sweet dark and roasted malt, dark fruit. Fairly complex and well integrated. Medium bodied with some creaminess. The flavor is a bit subdued compared to other big stouts, but the great dark fruit element is more forward and makes this a pleasant and different stout."
" I would not buy this Stout again. I'll stick to Stone Imperial Russian Stout or Old Rasputin."
"Overall this beer is spectacular. One of the best I've had and Stouts are my specialty."
""
""
""
"edit: on tap this is an entirely different animal. a beautiful mocha head that lasts forever, a relaxed hop profile and a clean finish that's only moderately bitter. a real gem, and completely different from the bottled version. I was amazed at the difference. go tap all the way. bumped up a few scores here based on that."
""
""
""
"M: I actually really enjoy the heavier-than-normal carbonation on this AIS. Slightly viscous as it should be. Dry finish."
""
"O/D-A solid big Stout. Not exceptional in my book. Pretty damn good but there's about a couple hundred Imperial Stouts offering pretty much the same thing. Pretty pricey for a 4 pack too."
""
"The alcohol abv in this stout was a but suprising. Then again, it is a double stout. This heavy stout poured a dark coffee color body with a cinnamon colored head. Nothing complemented the head then the rich lacing it left behind after the creamy head settled. Strong hints of chocolate immediately caught my attention, folloeed by a touch of used coffee and a hint of booze. The taste is very similar to the smell. Chocolate and once again, used coffee. Alcohol barely makes its presence in the finish but it finishes nice and would consider it a lip smacker. Mouthfeel? Well typical for a stout. Low carbonation and a medium to thich body. Overall this is one of the best stouts ive had yet. Flavourful and bitter, too."
""
""
"Pours an opaque black like no other. It's head is a sticky, frothy tan color which does not recede all that much. Although it is an Imperial Stout, its aroma in not unlike that of a Sweet Stout, with a clean, creamy nose containing chocolate and coffee as well. The flavor itself unique containing the best of both worlds, so to speak, in regards to the two aforementioned styles. It begins rather sweet before giving way to a tinge of hops followed by a wallop of bitter coffee bean. As another reviewer mentions, the mouth feel and body is a little thin. Again though, this is one of the more unique stouts I've personally had. A win."

"Double indeed - a ton of malt crammed into this beer. Poured tar black with a thin mocha head. This is all about the deep roasted malt, but it manages to balance sweetness with enough hops to hold it all together. The alcohol is there, lurking in the background, but never moves too far to the forefront to be distracting. A worthy entry in the class."
"O: A simple, well-executed, drinkable stout. Nothing overly impressive but nice."
"O: Tasty beer for sure. It's above average but falls short of being incredibly note worthy."

"This is definitely the most cost-effective imperial stout I've ever had. Easy on the wallet, but just as hard-hitting as some of the other more expensive offerings in the style. I think I've found my go-to beer for the cold winter season!"
"Overall, very impressed. I cannot believe how smooth this goes down for 8.8% ABV. There's a slight milk chocolate profile in it that's delicious."
" Body is full and creamy, but not too rich or oily. This is a very nice and interesting stout."
"O - An excellent stout, double stout, etc. If you like stout beers, this is not one to miss!"
""
"O – Not complex, just a solid, straightforward stout."

"Overall, this is a terrific beer. I look forward to encountering this one again."

"In an odd way, this beer makes brewing seem too easy. Immaculately balanced, simple profile, and exquisite execution makes the beer seem perfect as is but still making me want more."

"As I said, middle of the road. Perhaps my palate is off? Check it out anyway!"

"O- Really like this double stout. This is up there with many of my favorites. Green Flash does not disappoint. Worth seeking out."

"D - A respectable Imperial Stout... Definitely on the meeker end of the category... Kind of a boring brew... Solid appearance and solid aroma, however everything else is slightly disappointing, but not off putting in any way..."
"A very good though not outstanding double stout."

"A solid Imperial Stout. Nothing that blew my mind, but every aspect was quite well executed and enjoyable."

"I'm spoiled by what I believe to be the gold standard in this category: Old Rasputin. No RIS will ever match up, IMO. This one is just a little bit thinner texture; but, absolutely delicious!"

"Overall, an OK Imperial stout."

"I am surprised that my glass is almost empty as this beer is incredibly easy drinking and has no evidence of the ABV. Quite a nice beer, while not overly complex it is great at what it is a roasty rich malty stout."
"Ok-- Green Flash, congrats. I'll let go the fact you don't bottle date! This is a great goddamn beer."
"This will be a cold-weather staple...hell, who am I kidding, I'll drink it any time of year!"

"Poured from a bomber and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a very dark, almost black, brown coloring with a thick, dense, foamy, light brown head that sits a solid inch and a half atop the brew. Clings to the glass as the head slowly recedes, and the beer has strong coffee aromas. The coffee smells are blended with a dark chocolate aroma, as well as a roasty character. Flavors are very rich, with a good blast of bitter dark chocolate and dark roasted coffee, evenly blended and overly bitter, with a slight char and dark fruit sweetness (currant) at the end of the palate. The aftertaste is more of the roasty qualities, with a kiss of the dark cocoa. Smooth body, but remaining somewhat light to allow more ease of drinking. The finish is bitter and slightly boozey, giving a somewhat drying, astringent feel, albeit for a fuller beer such as a stout. Good beer."
""
""
"This is a good stout, very drinkable and would buy again ."
""
""
"O: I consider this one of my new favorite imperial stouts. And thats saying alot when my favorite are Speedway, The Abyss, Stones Russian, and Old Rasputin standard and XII. This just happens to be a sensational beer for a great price to enjoy on a nice cold night."
""
"Pours beautifully! Rich, thick, semi-persistent head. Smell is equally beautiful. There is however a moderate bite I could do without. Between the bite and the burnt taste I can hardly get anything else out of this beer, except an underlying sweetness which I'd like to taste more of!"
"Overall, this was a solid stout. Fairly certain that this gets distributed to my area but I had never had it regardless. Definitely worth picking up if you like em roasty!"
""
"Another outstanding offering by Green Flash. Tan head with good retention, pours an opaque black color. Scents of chocolate and huge coffee on the nose. Taste is similar, full body lots of chocolate malts and coffee followed with a hop roundness that makes the beer complete. Absolute beauty and I wish I had more than one."
""
""
""
"an aggressive pour of this bottle resulted in a half inch of creamy tan head on top of a black body. smell and taste are pretty standard for the style. both have good roasted malt flavors with a nice amount of cocoa in it. mouthfeel is full and well carbonated. leaves a sticky syrupy film on the lips. overall this is a good stout, nothing outstanding, but a very well made representation of the style."
""
"Overall I think this is a good double stout. It isn't mind-blowing but it's definitely better than average. It is well balanced and easy drinking for a 8.8% brew which to me really counts. I wouldn't buy it regularly just because there are many of it's kind but I will definitely give it the occasional go. Try it out if you see it and are a fan of imperial stouts. I don't think it will disappoint."
"Overall this beer is excellent. Too bad it doesn't last on the shelves here."
""
""
"An excellent stout. It's a bit too strong to be considered sessionable, but it's an awesome sipper."
""
"The beer smells of depth, as if malts knew no bounds Mocha and roasted malt sinking ever deep as if to China. The most surprising taste to date for me from any stout. The flavor is soft, milky and subtle coffee and rich malt. Holy crap is this delicious. So many stouts hit you ov3r the head with coffee and mocha. This one takes a step back and lets the malt and hops through to balance everything out. Mouthfeel is wet silk with little to no strong aftertaste. No mouth mung feeling with this stout. Overall, this stout is incredible and I will be buying more when I can find it."
""
"quite a remarkable stout. i thought this stout was going to be much more bitter, but i was surprised at how low-key the hop character was. recommended."
"really enjoyed this drank it through the count down at new years, so i ended 2011 as started 2012 with it."
"Well this one will be the last of 2011 tastings for me and what a shocker to finish with. Extremely easy going double stout and the 8.8% ABV is almost not existent. This just may win my suprise of the year for 2011."
""
"Cost: $7 for a 12 oz tap pour or $10.99 for a four pack of 12 oz bottles."

"O: This is a very solid beer. I love getting this ever now and then. I love Green Flash and they made another good beer."
""
""
""
"O: Overall dark, bitter with a well concealed alcohol will no doubt make you keep coming back for more. Black roast and at a higher end of the serving spectrum (56-60F) it only tends to get smoother."

"Overall a good stout that I would not turn down if offered."

"Medium body and creamy from ample fine carbonation. A bit of a burnt bread flavor lingers a little too long on the tongue for my liking though. A decent stout for the price, but not the most interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
"I like this style but it would be good to try one of these that wasn't so strong. The flavors weren't obstructed by the alcohol and this didn't have the feel of the other Green Flash beers but there was a bit missing from this. Having one of these that was a bit thinner would probably lead to a beer that would be easier to enjoy and would allow for a more sensory experience as well. For now, this suffices and in spite of its boldness, this was a fine brew that would warm anyone up nicely on a cold day."
""
"Green Flash brews one sweet and potent stout; a very brew from the West Coast stout. I simply must make a trip to San Diego one day."
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. It has a solid inclusion of roast, alcohol and hops that impart their own very unique character to the overall experience. however I just dont think it blends together that well. Overall it is not a bad brew by any means, it is just a little rough around the edges that gets more perplexing as the experience continues. The depth of flavor almost changes to tobacco and leather once it is warms which is nice but it doesn't blend well with the faint musty grain and herbal hop inclusion. Worth a try for sure but not something I would reach for continually."
"overall - not a stout i would buy again - will stick with the two beers green flash does well ipa and bwine"
""
""

""
"O: This is a very likeable, easy to drink stout."
""
""
"12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams glass. Caramel colored tightly bubbled two finger head, pours an opaque black. Aroma of roasted coffee, dark chocolate and caramel. Tastes of coffee, burnt toffee, mild alcohol, and chocolate - a little smokey as well. Creamy and oily but slightly raspy (like a smoked porter) mouthfeel, well balanced. A great beer from Green Flash and one of the few imperial stouts available in this area in 12 oz bottles (at a decent price!). Nicely done."
"O: One of my new favorite stouts, at a fairly reasonable price. Green Flash did a great job all around - this is a beautiful beer."
""
""
""
"Finger and a half dark cocoa brown head, a bit uneven and rocky, over dark brown/black opaque body, no visible carbonation, really nice spider legs, good retention, a really nice looking beer. Big dose of roasted malt, more coffee than chocolate in the nose, faint citrus and floral hop aromas. Taste mirrors the nose, really roasty goodness, a bit of sweetness on back end for balance. Mouthfeel is medium, smooth, almost creamy from the oats. Tasty, impressive, worth a try."
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Poured pitch black, with a 3 inch mocha head, that takes sometime to settle into a solid set of bubbles. Lots of lace. Smell is chocolate, coffee, molasses, and some piny hops. Taste is all of those things, but way way more chocolate and coffee then the smell would have you expect. Fairly large body, for it's easy drinkability. Nice amount carbonation and not very dry. This is a very good stout and the price is right."

"Very big flavor here. Roasted malts and chocolate intermingling to present a nice bitterness backed up by an earthy, leafy hop bitterness. The beer has got a touch of sweetness but is probably drier than it is sweet. Full and robust, with a light carbonation. Super stout."
""
""
""
"Light-bodied with only a hint of boozy warmth, this stout still packs a lot of punch. Very balanced and flavorful."

"Drink- Its a nice better than average roasty stout. The 8% is well hidden and has some good layers of flavor. A good 4 pack to keep around the house maybe in order."

""
""

"Overall: Green Flash, while known widely for its IPA and hopped up beers, are truly capable of making an excellent stout. Aged or fresh,very good, but my next sample will be a current vintage."
""
"O: First non-collaboration beer from Green Flash that I have had, and I am impressed. Very well crafted beer, and nicely balanced. Up front it is a huge chocolately and malty stout, but is countered excellently by the hop additions and medium bitter chocolate notes. Fantastic."
""
"Heck of a good beer, my first try of Green Flash and I will seek out others."
""
""
""

"The palate is wonderful. Richly layered and dense with plenty of roast (but no burnt malt notes), fresh brewed French Roast coffee, a moderately bitter dark chocolate, a mild spice note ( anise?), and a little herbal bitterness with a touch of mint. Marvelously balanced, the beer finishes long with a lingering grainy bitterness, a little licorice and coffee. A touch fruity, even? Also, there's a little bit of sweetness on the finish that tempers the bitterness and enhancing the drinkability. Medium-full in body with a smooth feel (rather oatmeal stout like in this regard IMO), this beer has a soft carbonation level, allowing the grainy flavors to do the talking. A wonderful stout, I can't think of too many other imperial stouts that are this impressive and this balanced fresh. Lip smacking good."

"Nicely spritzy on the tongue and highly drinkable. Black stout appearance with a little more brown to it. Fair nose of dark roast barley in the snifter, but not highly aromatic. Rich flavors but not lush."
"Nearly opaque black pour, thick tan head, excellent retention and lacing that persists throughout the entire drink. Smells like burnt malts, chocolate and a hint of raisin and fig with a full bodied taste that mirrors the smell. Excellent from start to finish with a nice smooth after-tase. Could have a slightly thicker mouthfeel, but there's plenty of taste to cover. Again, an excellent offering from Green Flash."
"O: Great offering from Green Flash. Haven't had a bad beer from them yet."
"I'm not sure how fresh this is but it is still just a tad too hoppy for me. An amazing beer non the less but a few months would probably make it even that much better."
"Mouthfeel is good, the beer is not too sweet, which makes the alcohol stick out a little more. Overall this is a great beer."
"Nothing extraordinairy here, but this is a very solid beer from the folks at Green Flash."
"O: Double Stout is a really nice beer that I'd love to have regular access to. It's very well balanced in both taste and smell and top notch in terms of look and feel. Also, the 8.8% doesn't show itself in the least. Thanks as always, Daniel."
"O Very good stout, but would have enjoyed a thicker version more."
"Serving type: bottle"
"O: Quite a good stout. Well worth mixing into regular rotation."
"O: Buy this beer. I highly recommend it."
"Green Flash rarely disappoints, and this is not one of them. A nice beer for watching the World Series as the weather turns colder and colder. Warming and wonderful."
"O: A good imperial stout overall. Not quite good enough for me to want to buy it over my normal staples like Storm King and Old Rasputin, but tasty nonetheless. I'll have no trouble finishing the four pack!"
"Good offering from Green Flash, like their others. The price is a bit steep at $3 bottle, so I may not revisit."
"Full body, solid carbonation, chewy and smooth on the tongue. Solid stout, not terribly complex, but something I'd probably drink again."
"O: Goes down very easy, very tasty, somewhat filling, well hidden kick, very good representation of style. Ahhhh - a fantastic stout to sit back and if you can hang with the ABV, enjoy for a little bit."
"Overall, a good double stout."
"SkÅL!"
"The coffee taste follows through immediately at the front of the mouth while a smooth dark chocolate taste follows bringing up the finish in a velvety like fashion. Not to heavy and drinks really well. Reminds me of stout trooper from NEBCO."
"Nice, tasty, not too bitter and dry, but just right. This is tasty and it hide the nearly 9% ABV very well. Enjoy!"
"While I find this a tad thin for a stout, it nevertheless it an enjoyable and very drinkable beer. It certainly isn't the alcohol-bomb like some of its cousins, while managing to have a good kick in the flavor department without being over-the-top."
"I poured this thick beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was really black as it should be. Very chocolate looking and the head was too for what little bit of time it was there. The smell was sweet but the taste was not. The beer had a bitter and dry mouth feel. It was thick and chewy. I do not think I will buy again."
"O-Just a solid,solid RIS on par with Raspy IMO."
"Poured a deep dark brown black body, with creamy almost purple head. Head is very short lived though.Lacing is ok. Taste is complex: chocolate, coffee,nice bite but not overpowering. This could be a dangerous choice, since the alchohol is not apparent, especialy for an Imperial!"
"Overall a very impressive palate, if somewhat all over the place. Very tasty they did well."
"Overall - I wasn't sold on this one. It seemed too fruity and sugary. Just seemed terribly off in the balance."
"T: Pretty spectacular. The oats lend a creamy texture (though the mouthfeel is a bit light) and the dark chocolate and coffee flavors are excellent. The slightest hint of hops on the finish is pretty nice as well. A really great double stout."
"I think this is a very good beer with all flavors balancing nicely with one another. Alcohol is well hidden. Good for an evening in the fall."
"O - This is a straight all around good double stout. Not a bad price either. 11 dollars a 4 pack. Worth every penny."
"Poured a blackish body with one-finger tan head that leave a brown lace ring down the glass. A great stout aroma; I pick up roasted and coffee malt blended together as well as dark chocolate and something like toffee or syrup(?) and for some reason I get something akin to black cherry. The beer itself is more of the same as it real smooth and creamy and easy to drink (and dangerous considering the ABV hides itself well). Yet despite this smoothness there's a great dryness from the roasted and coffee malts balanced in this beer w/ the sweetness (dark chocolate, toffee...that black cherry vibe again). Finishes dry and is just a very enjoyable sipper."
"O: This is an incredibly easy drinking Imperial Stout. The flavors are more subdued compared to other RISs but it still remains rich and complex. Expertly balanced and very well done. There's a lot of vanilla going on and I'm liking it."
"O - This has good drinkability. It is a little bit of a sipper, but delicious none the less. Overall, I thought it was a really nice stout. The alcohol content was hidden well too. I would definitely buy this one again."
"Overall, it just doesn't work for me. The more I sip, the less I like it. It has too many off notes for me - plastic and too much oily char that makes the black licorice unpleasant as well."
"O - I am not a coffee fan so this is not a hit for me, but I can see the attraction to this big, bold, brash stout, especially in the cooler weather."
"O: A very tasty beverage. Another solid beer from Green Flash."
"Overall a very nice bold, flavorful stout. Definitely recommend this one."
"Overall - I'm very impressed by this beer. I'm also impressed by how long in alcohol it is for how flavorful it is. I've been sitting on this bottle for nearly a year. Glad I opened it."
"O: A pretty solid imperial stout. The taste was a little disappointing considering the nose, but still very enjoyable. Maybe a little thinner than I prefer in a stout as well. Definitely more on the chocolate/sweet side than the coffee/bitter side. Alcohol is well hidden and the beer is very smooth and well balanced. Would certainly drink again, but probably not in the 22 oz format."
"Overall (4.0): This is a very nice double stout. I like this style because it allows the beer to head towards balance and moderation, sometimes underappreciated in beer today . . . this is nice. Like the label says, “Big, Bold & Complex,” but approachable. This is a beer I’d tell people who want to get into big stouts to be friends with, and one I’ll return to."
"O: Very impressed with this beer. I've had some of GFB's other lighter beers that were good, but this one ranks above all of those bar far. Nicely done."
"O: Quite good. I'm liking this one more as it warms."
"O: Great beer, Damn good beer but why does it have to be so pricey? I love G Flash, i just think they are a bit too high for what you get. $12 for a 4pk just means i wont be drinking this often. That being said, solid."
"Solid Imperial Stout. Loving the chocolate!"
"Pours jet black with a brown head. In the aroma, a light coffee roast. In the taste, a dry coffee roast and mellow pine hops in the end. A small hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry, mellow coffee roast in the aftertaste. Lack of nose, but nice mellow hops all the way through."
"I love when beer is ebony. It probably skews my ratings in the appearance department, because I want to award 5s to those beers that accomplish this (with an equally impressive head of course). I originally wrote this review while drinking this beer for the first time. I have now had several (this is a different night; I am not hammered). My original interpretations hold up, and I continue to love this beer."
"Very drinkable and very interesting."
"Beer is medium bodied and much better than I expected, overall the beer is malty and sweet with a nice finish, not too bitter, not dry, good throughout. I'd have this beer again."
"Really good stout, hides its potency well and is just delectable across the board. Particularly enjoyed the addition of coffee flavors while avoiding the normal acidity that tends to come with that. Not my favorite stout ever, but certainly up there and would definitely try again."
"Pours an opaque black with a 2 inch thick dark khaki head that settles to a small cap. Randsom swaths of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, bread/biscuit, and slight chocolate aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt, bitter cocoa beans, and some hop flavors on the finish. There is a slight roasty/hop bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good stout that has more roasty aromas and flavors than any sort of coffee/chocolate found in other stouts."
"I sipped it and thought of long nights and cooler weather."
"O - A big bold stout that has great complexity. I really enjoyed the bittersweet hoppy anise flavor that this beer possesses."
"O – I was not expecting this good of a stout from a west coast hob bomb maker. Very clean and clear flavors, not muddled as others who do not normally brew darker style beers. I highly recommend this beer and am so glad I can get this on a whim."
"(O) It's a lot fruitier than I had expected. It's definitely malty and rich. It's an excellent brew. Big flavor without really being big in the gut. Quality."
"Full-bodied with a light effervescence. Creamy at the start though transitioning to a dry finish. Some warming, mostly in the throat. Toasty/coffee note lingers for quite some time. Pretty good brew."
"O- Really enjoyed this as there was no alcohol bite, making it very drinkable. Could easily drink this on a regular basis during the cooler months. A straight forward, but well executed stout."
"Pours thick black like used oil with nice thick chocolaty head and long lasting laces. Flavor is bitter chocolate and coffee enhanced with roasted grains and herbs. A full body with creamy, oily feel, soft carbonation to almost lively, and nice long dry clean and balanced finish."
"What a great stout, extemely brash, bright, and a killer dry finish for such a crankin' malt bill. Huge, heavenly, highly recommended."
"Thanks Chris for this. Pours thick black with a thin coffee head and nice lacing. Nose is rich fudge, molasses, dates, anise. Sweet but very rich and pleasant. Mouth strangely departs from the nose and focuses on a nice, rich coffee bean with some dry baker's chocolate on the finish. Creamy, rich, expressive. Combines the sweet and roasted elements nicely, though not overly roasty. Carbonation is too sharp, really my biggest knock on this, and the mouth is a touch thin. I think I might like more dark fruits and sugar in the mouth. But this was a good one."
"I highly recommend this brew for lovers of darker beers; you won't be sorry you splurged on a bottle. And at 8.8% for a 1 pint, 6 fl. oz. bottle, you probably won't need to drink more than one."
"O: no complaints, is a great stout, wish it came in sixers and not four packs."
"O: An exceptional beer that makes me crave another sip."
"O- Decent stout, very easy drinking beer, well balanced, not overly complex but still enjoyable."
"Overall: A really nice Imperial Stout. Robust and balanced."
"The best stout to get in a 4 pack, next to Old Raspy."
"Very smooth, very drinkable. Overall, another quality product from Green Flash. Fast becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"mouthfeel is a bit thin for a double, but the abundent carbonation gives this beer good stature...a real nice example of an American double sout...Cheers!"
"O: This is a solid stout and really nice to see it in a 4 pack and not just a 22oz. Great flavors, I just would like it to be a bit more intense."
"The beer is black with a towering, beige head that leaves ample lacing in its wake. The aroma brings roast, malt, and milk chocolate. Alcohol presence is well disguised. The flavor is nice, albeit plain. The beer is silky smooth and goes down easy, although the mouthfeel is unusually thin for the style. A decent brew, and a good bargain."
"Awesome."
"Overall: Very robust stout! Almost too bitter needs some balance for that bitter bite, but still a solid stout!"
"O- For the price this is the best bang for your buck as far as an everyday Imp Stout."
"Well, my brother said it was in his top three of stouts and I have to agree. Robust, full flavor while being drinkable yet not a light-bodied stout. The Double Stout is definitely one I'll have to try again and share of its deliciousness with my friends. This is definitely one of the yummiest stouts I've ever had. I just love the flavor. Another great beer from Green Flash!"
"The bottle describes this one as ""big, bold and complex"" and I would agree. In addition to all this, it's also fairly easy-drinking; it would be no problem to mistakenly plow through a few of these and realize your mistake when you try to stand up. I could drink this regularly if it was easy to find, I can't wait to find some more Green Flash."
"Overall another great Green Flash product, this has become one of those breweries where I'll try any of their products I can find and expect great results. This double stout is no exception, a wonderful example of the style. I thought I might wait a few months to see how well this ages, but its pretty perfect right now. Excellent brew, this just might be my favorite stout thus far."
"O: this brew is quite tasty. It leans towards the roastier/dry side of things when it comes to the style. Well balanced and incredibly drinkable."
"A truly delicious and, in my opinion, an under-appreciated stout. This is a big stout done right. No alcohol presence, just pure and delicious clean flavors and aroma. I'm going to do my best to keep this one in the fridge year-round. Yes, it's 100 degrees outside, but it still tastes perfect."
"Though not outrageously great, there is little to complain about. Carbonation is too much for me. Worth a shot though."
"Overall: I can’t believe I waited as long as I did to finally purchase this beer. It was very good! A lot of American Double stouts try to be overpowering, whereas, this example is more subtle yet no less flavorful."
"Jet black, no light, short lived head that fades to just above a film. Lots of sticky lace. Medium intensity roast coffee and chocolate aroma. Medium carbonation with a noticeable amount on the finish. Big and rich body. Nice flavor with lots of bittersweet chocolate and some alcohol."
"Overall - Besides Lagunitas, Green Flash is one of my favorite microbrews out of California. Strong work with this one."
"O: Very tasty Imperial Stout and one I will have to keep around more often. Solid offering."
"O: A nice imperial stout that is well balanced."
"Well screw all that. I'm happy I can buy this at my corner store. Cheers to Green Flash. Keep making this lovely liquid!"
" I like the flavors this beer has, nice toasted and chocolate malt presence with some coffee flavor and an invigorating amount of piney hops that lets you know this is a West Coast stout. It is hoppier than most American stouts, but fits the double stout moniker and has a gentle amount of caramel in the taste to lessen the impact of the hops and dark grain. Overall I really enjoyed this I consider it a decent example of the style without going overboard with hops or roasted malts a very clean and enjoyable brew."
"D/O: This full-flavored stout errs as many others also do, positioning itself in between two different styles instead of fitting either one perfectly. At almost 9% abv it is too strong to be an export stout tuned for every-day applications, but it wouldn't really turn heads as an imperial stout. It does taste good, but doesn't really soothe the palate as much as some other stouts might."
"Overall not bad also not super but decent. I have another one that I'll be happy to drink. I did take it of my wants list because now I know..."
"O- Decent drinkability. A couple of these would be good. Good beer but nothing special for sure"
"Really enjoyed this one. While $3 ain't a fortune, it's not exactly a value beer either. Green Flash knows they have a good one and they make you pay for it."
"Overall: Nice! This feels like a mixture of Black IPA and Imperial Stout. Drinkable, only the dryness might hurt it, but otherwise delicious."
"Overall-Extremely highly drinkable. Complex enough to not be underwhelmed, but not too much to where it's got awkard tastes. Very safe stout to try if your getting into craft beers."
"Overall. Pretty boozy and a little dry for me, but a good sipper. Happy to have tried it."
"Overall, a very nice stout that I would certainly reccomend and will be going back for more. Enjoy!!!"
"A very fine imperial stout. It's missing the vanilla notes provided by oak aging in their Silva Stout."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. If I had this blind, I wouldn't believe that this is almost 9%, it drinks that easily. That easy drinking comes at a cost, however, as the flavors aren't exactly revolutionary, but if you are looking for a 'big' stout that doesn't full like motor oil, this fits the bill."
"Overall, an ok brew, but having had their Silva Stout fresh, this is a bit of a let-down."
"O: A simple and enjoyable enough stout. Enough said."
"O: Surprising treat. Random grab actually, put into a mixes six pack. Have had Silva stout before and love it, thought this would be a lot milder then it is, good stuff."
"I love how it just says ""stout"" on the label. How very to-the-point. It pours a straight onyx topped by a finger of dark tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, chocolate, molasses, and a hint of a combination of pine and menthol in the background. The taste holds notes of roasted malts (in spades, baby), dark chocolate, light coffee, light molasses, and black pepper. The body is a heavy-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a very dry finish. Overall, a tasty stout, though a bit on the bitter and dry sides for my tastes."
"This brew pours a dark as night black hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a very frothy,chocolate coloured three finger head that leaves behind lots of clingy lacing everywhere,the smell is mainly tobacco,oak,light mocha and some piney hops,it has a light-medium bodied well carbonated mouthfeel and has tastes of dark belgian chocolate,bitter coffee,oak,tobacco and finished off with a twist of dark fruity/piney bitter hops and overall its a nice double stout that just lacks in a few fields to be in the top range in my mind cheers."
"O: Overall, a good imperial stout. Fairly simple and straight-forward, but solid nonetheless."
"Feels sticky and remains a little bitter in your mouth after swallowing."
"Oh, I was dead wrong on the lace. It stuck in beautiful patches and rings."
"Taste gets a little better as the viscous malts provide a nice chocolate, roast and milky caramel flavor. Hop bitterness is there and even a decent amount of hop flavor. Surprisingly subtle hop presence for Green Flash. This is one of the better widely available Impy stouts not in a bomber or 750. I will surely be buying this again...very nice for about 2.50 a bottle."
"Overall: I really enjoyed drinking this beer. Well worth the price of 7.50 and will have to say that it has warmed me up for bed in this month of April. Will be trying this at the bar or buying this bomber sometime again in the future."
"Picked up a 12 oz bottle for $3 in Monterey, CA. Heck of a nightcap beer. It poured pitch black with a thick, light brown head and lacing. It's a big, rich (not too heavy) chocolate-y stout, that when cold, reminded me of cocoa and chocolate milk. As it warmed, cleaner, roasty and dark bread crust notes came forward with hints of espresso and dark, dry, smoky chocolate. The finish comes out dry after an initially sweet and creamy cocoa note. My only knock is that the alcohol quickly becomes apparent in the nose. I'd be happy to pick up a few more bottles and try aging them."
"O: Almost like Silva, only not QUITE as memorable. Easy A!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly syrupy; the beer is free flowing but definitely not thin. Leaves a coating after each sip and the finish manages to be dry despite that. Drinkability is good for the style thanks to the dry finish and masking of the abv. Excellent offering from Green Flash as usual."
"Overall: Too bitter and too heavily roasted for me."
"D: very smooth, creamy flavors. each is delicate and play off each other. also the alcohol is very well hidden. great imp stout."
"Superb beer; right up with there with Brooklyn Double Chocolate and Old Rasputin among my favorites."
"Mmmmm very tasty Imperial Stout, very drinkable due to the lower than average ABV and wonderful flavor, aroma, and mouthfeel. Not as intense or thick as others in the style, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing."
"O - A very fine big stout, treat with respect."
"Overall - not a bad brew at all. Very drinkable, and decently complex."
"Definitely a stout worth trying again."
"I've always enjoyed Green Flash's IPA/DIPAs, but for some reason I have perhaps never had this beer before. Smells very roasty with lots of chocolate. Some cocoa and coffee notes are in there as well. Taste is also roasty and chocolaty with an intensely creamy and thick mouthfeel. Low and smooth carbonation. Sorry that I did not try this earlier as it is very tasty. Recommended."
"i would drink this again, fair enough?"
"O - it is close, but due to the bitter hits I would only do one before moving on."
"M - Light body - a bit thin for the style. Otherwise creamy. Sharp char character comes through every now and then. Touch of booze."
"12 oz. poured into a snifter and it damn near billowed out the top. Huge mocha brown colored head with massive lacing and a black as night ale. Very roasty aroma with chocolate in the air, butterscotch, some nice cocoa hints and a slight orange-y whiff in there too. The taste is definitely on the bitter side! A nice smokey initial taste followed by bitter chocolate and some expresso hints. Awesome stuff. Full bodied with a slight bit of carbonation on the swallow but nothing to detract from the taste. Overall I think this beer is great! I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. Rich, chocolatey and creamy with a nice bitterness to it. I never imagined such an awesome brew resided in a non-descript bottle. Excellent stuff and worth searching out. Would love to see how this ages but drank all eight within a few days. Addicting."
"D: yummy, like drinking an espresso chocolate milkshake."
"Imperial stout lovers will not be dissappointed. Highly recommended."
"One of the least sweet stouts I have ever had, as the roasted malt character simply doesn't allow any sweet malt character to really shine through. Hovering just shy of 9%ABV, you would expect some alcohol in the taste, but there is simply is none. Hop bitterness is definitely stronger than your average stout, defining this an American interpretation of the style all the way. If you are after a big, kick ass Americanized Stout, look no further than this beer."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being moderate. Overall, it's a very good stout with a lot of flavors. Everything also comes together pretty nicely in it and all the flavors get a chance to shine. Very nice beer overall."
"Overall I only appreciate the fact that it is a great stout but it's still lacking in roast and has a moderate sourness that isn't great in the beginning in the beer. Still for 6.99 it was a decent bomber."
"My frost introduction to Green Flash was to have it's IPA, which I was told was their flagship beer. After having it a few times, i was totally unimpressed, and avoided GF for a while. This is now the second GF I've had recently that I've liked quite a bit. I think I'll give them another shot as a brewery; you should give this stout a shot. I'm glad I've got three more downstairs for later!"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Easily drinkable for an 8% stout. Perfect to sip; but you could also drink it quickly if desired."
"Notes: Nice surprise. First non-hoppy brew I really like from Green Flash, and well worth the repeat."
"D: Solid beer, not going to have a huge flavor profile if you've been drinking barrel aged RIS, but this one is a great ""go to"" stout."
"Overall a great example of a dry double stout. I cannot really say anything bad about this beer."
"much better than I expected, will definitely look for this again."
"One of my fav stouts for sure. Deep rich and complex malty flavors but not a syrup bomb by any means. Nice smooth mouthfeel from the use of oats. A very well balanced brew at 8.8%ABV."
"D: Good consistency, drinkable for all stout drinkers and alcoholics. One of the good ones. Drink up!"
"Tradability- Hopefully low right now as I would like several more of these before people figure out how good this is. Pretend I am the Alstrom Bros. and 'send me beer'. This beer."
"This is one of my new favorite Imperial Stouts! I had a good feeling about it, but it exceeded all of my expectations. This is exactly what I look for in a RIS. Highly recommended!"
"Popping slowly into oblivion a bubbly dark tan head rides majestic atop this pure black brew. A broken but substantial lace is left behind. Aroma is subtle with roasted nuts, dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans and sweet malts. Tastes of espresso, more dark chocolates, a hint of plums, and is big on the piny hops, especially for a stout. Medium to heavy body and somewhat airy with a resilient alcohol heat. Not as smooth as expected, but a good outing for sure."
"Carbonation is light, alcohol is not heavy, roasted malts are heavy on the palate between tastes, yet pleasant. This beer is perfect for long breaks between tastes, as the flavor is large and in charge."
"Good vibrant carbonation, but nothing too big. Fairly thick and chewy. A really solid double stout."
"Cheers..."
"Two big thumbs up for Green Flash. Seek this one out."
"D - A nicely done stout from Green Flash...very roasted flavors all around...a little too carbonated for me"
"D- very good taste with great flavors that work well with one another. a great brew"
"22 oz. bomber aged for one year. This superb stout poured a black with minimal head. Delightful aromas of a mild/irish stout with roasted grain bill of barley and malt. Nice dry taste and finish with some sweetness, and very nice heavy mouthfeel. Definitely a fantastic doulbe stout. Not boozy at all, not overdone like a lot of RIS. I will seek more of this out as it's in the wheelhouse for my stout tastes."
"Damn this is one roasty f'ing beer. Maybe too roasty? The bottle proclaims that it is ""Big, Bold & Complex"" but I feel that may be an understatement. I feel like the beer is slightly too roasty and just out of balance. Tasty nevertheless. Looking forward to finishing my 4 pack."
"Drinkiabilty - A great session beer. Too strong to drink many at one sitting. A great example from this fine brewery. If it wasnt so high in alcohol would have got a higher rating."
"D - This stout's a doozy, but the great flavors are more than enough to keep me drinking. On the lighter side for ""double"" stouts, but still a very flavorful and assertive beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"(12oz bottle). Pours black with chocolate head. Some lacing developing. Aroma of coffee, cocoa and maybe some dark berries. Taste is roasty bitter, but there is a sweetness that serves as the backbone to balance this beer out. I'm getting a peppery aspect as well. Full bodied and creamy texture. Finish is bitter, but nice."
"Pours a pitch black (even when held up to light there is no change in color) with a medium espresso colored head. This beer smells like it's gonna be a coffee bomb! Tons of coffee and dark chocolate...and that's about it. Maybe a hint of vanilla. Smells fantastic! My nose does not deceive me, as this is definitely a coffee bomb. Amazing coffee flavor with dark chocolate notes and a tiny bit of bittering hops. Most of the bitterness comes from the dark chocolate though. There are hints of vanilla and maybe very hidden citrus notes. Alcohol is very well hidden. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth. Nice velvety texture and full-bodied. Drinkability is fairly high. Great imperial stout and perfect for coffee lovers. Also see Peche Mortel."
"Wow... Looks like a black stout with a chocolate milkshake for the head. Solid three finger head that slowly dissipates. Smell is of chocolate, coffee, and malt. Taste adds vanilla to the mix. This is a solid beer, just short of being world class. I love Green Flash IPA, so I was eager to try this one. It didn't disappoint me, in fact- I would definitely buy this beer again. Mouthfeel is creamy and goes down easy, just like a milkshake. Drinkability is good- I wouldn't drink more than 2 of these in one sitting, but they go down pretty smoothly."
"Pours a near-black color with a thin mocha head that sticks around for quite a bit and leaves some spotty lacing. Thin collar sits throughout. The nose brings a good dosing of chocolate along with some mild roast and coffee. Touch of vanilla in there as well. Some sweetness opens the taste up, followed by a mellow chocolate character and a bit of coffee and roast in the finish, creating a bit of a roasty bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy with low levels of carbonation. Finish is a bit too roasty and dry for my taste. Drinks pretty well and this is certainly something I'd order again."
"D - Very drinkable, could enjoy a few of these and next time will be sure to share with a friend to spread the wealth!"
"D: A good double stout, for sure; I imagine sipping this one by a campfire would be pretty nice; in my opinion, an ale for savoring."
"Taste shows a bit more chocolate than the nose, but is still a coffee bomb. Alcohol is more noticeable, but makes it nice on a winter night. Tiny bit of hop spice. Full bodied, and fairly viscous. This could work well with some vanilla flavoring."
"This might need to lay down for a while, even only at 8.8%. Alcohol-dominant element keeps this from being a real drinker. Liked this alot, but just an odd structure and balance. Very worth picking up a bottle."
"Big bottle American Double stout, this one has a dark pitch black body with a deep moccha tan head, forms thick with rising chunky textured foam. Aroma has dark black chocolate notes, with creamy infused coffee notes. Flavor has dark nearly burnt coffee roast flavors, dark bitter chocolate. Herbal earthy hop finish, creamy textures round out the dark malt flavors but it does of a bit of an acrid tartness through the middle kind of like sourdough bread. Mouthfeel is big nice and chewy silky textured flows easy with natural carbonation, a bit dry in the finish. Drinkability is nice, one of the most easy going poundable big dark beers I've ever had. Impy stouts although a bid higher in abv are usually more boozey this is dangerous due to the drinkability level. This bottle may have a little bit of age considering it's a big bottle. I haven't seen it in smaller bottles yet, even though I know they changed to their new signature bottles."
"I could drink this one non stop. I think it easily stands up to the best imperial stouts out there. While a bomber was a bit much, I'm wishing I had more than the 12oz bottle. Time to go get more."
"D: The mouthfeel made it a sipper, but I enjoyed it overall."
"D: Medium to high"
"Overall, quite nice. Lightness of body brings it down a bit. For a ~9% beer, I was expecting a fuller-feeling glass."
"Drinkability: A very tasty beer that will warm your winter night. You'll be looking for more."
"Drinkability is very good and this is definitely a stout worth trying."
"Had on cask at rattle n hum at the green flash takes the taps night. Came a pitch black with thin creamy head in a mason jar cup. Temp was room tempish which I like for full flavor. Smelled of creamy caramel and vanilla malts. Pretty roasty. Fells like butter. Smooth drinking like water."
"Drinkability: A pleasant surprise and arguably my favorite from the brewery. It is sweet but not overly so and the alcohol is well masked. Could sip several on a cold night."
"A solid Double Stout with nice flavors. A little bit too sweet and thin for what I like in a double stout."
"Beer poured black with a thin tan head. Aroma of roasty dark malts with notes of coffee and fruit. Taste was bitter dark chocolate predominantly. Finish exhibited a pleasant burnt taste. Smooth finish. Mouthfeel was creamy. Medium body. Overall one of the best stouts I have had. Smooth, creamy, flavorful. A wonderful dessert beer."
"Drinkability - Overall very good for a double stout. Had it in a bomber and it went down very nicely. One at a time..."
"D- The hoppiness makes this a unique take on the style, but it is enjoyable. A bit of a sipper, but worth trying."
"The tastes are typical for the style; a boat load of rich roasted malts. While consumed at colder temperatures it goes down very smooth and leaves a mild bitter and dry finish. As with most stronger dark beers, as you let it warm up, the true characters of the beer come into play. You still get the rich/complex roastiness on the front of your tongue but as it gets to mid tongue you get slightly sweet coffee notes just before the hops balance out the malts. It finishes with bitter-sweet roasted notes and the 8.8% ABV makes its presence known. Overall this imperial stout is one smooth drinker and a great example of the style."
"D: The alcohol is well hidden, making this beer not too difficult drink, although the amount of bitterness and dryness requires that it be sipped."
"Overall, this is a really nice stout with some great flavor elements and incredible balance. Green Flash certainly knows the chemistry behind brewing."
"D- really not my favorite, but that doesn't mean its bad...I like my stouts to be bitter as opposed to sweet, and this one has no bitterness at all. Just a change from the norm for me"
"Picked this up after sampling a Silva Stout, but the two really are in separate leagues. Do what you can to get the Silva, it really is extraordinary. This is a damn solid stout as well."
"Drinkability is great for the style. 100% recommended."
"Dark rosewood brown with a thick and creamy dark tan cap that leaves big creamy blobs of lace on the glass as it melts. Anise, cocoa powder and dark chocolate with faint herbal hops in the aroma. Deep roasted malt flavors with notes of coffee, dark fruit, chocolate and black licorice. A pretty good dose of English hops are also evident and take this one to the next level. The complexities of the flavors grow as it warms up a bit. Big and creamy bodied, no doubt from the addition of oats. Green Flash makes a good Impy stout."
"M- Very dry. I finished a whole glass of water and wanted more."
"D - Very drinkable double/imperial stout.. makes me want to buy this one more.. at $5.00 a 22 its very drinkable. Goes down smooth with a great aftertaste. Greenflash does it again! Thumbs way up!"
"From the 22 fl. oz. bomber. Sampled on October 11, 2010. It pours opaque black with just a dab of ruby red hues if held just right under the light. There is a two-inch silky dark brown head that slowly fades away leaving a path of lacing in its wake. The aroma is rich with burnt chocolate malts, molasses, raisin, oats, and grains. Yet at the same time it is subtle and not overpowering. The oily, heavy body coats the throat. The taste is full of cooked chocolate malts and tongue tingling dry hops that finishes clean. Highly recommended."
"The flavors went well together, and produced a really smooth beer."
"So they're calling this a double stout on their website, and it's 8.8% ABV...It'll pack a wallop, for sure...for some reason I always fell like the ABV in stouts is higher than advertised. Oh well....Inky black with only the faintest rims of a head. Very little lacing, so far this is par for the course. Huge chocolate malt and roasty aromas. Very robust. Some barrell aging-ish smells, like smooth bourbon, way in the back. Has a ""creamy"" smell to it...Nice, sour roasted malt bite upfront in the flavor profile. Lots of espresso bean notes. Alcohol is apparent in the finish. Long, longer, longest finish. Very nice in its bitterness. Very dry stout, but also well balanced. This also has a beautiful round finish...kind of flows from bitter to creamy back to bitter...Very lovely beer....La la la LOVELY, as Mike Muir said...Well done, and mid-range on price at $5.99/bomber, so drinkability suffers a little from the price. Not sessionable, but dangerously good. Find and drink folks...find...and...drink."
"Pretty great drinkability. I was pretty surprised by how much I liked this beer. I haven't had much Green Flash, but I think I need to start."
"D: Enjoyable all the way down."
"Good stuff."
"drinkable, in that i'll finish the bomber."
"Thanks Russ for sharing this bottle. Pours black with a nice head and some lacing. Roasty and malty on the nose, with a fair hit of licorice. The taste is solid with more roasted grain notes and lots of dry licorice flavors, with some sweetness at the end, while the roasted notes continue throughout. Smooth and firm in the mouth. A well made stout, and I enjoyed it well enough, but I can't say it really possesses anything to make it stand out from the crowd."
"Drinkability: Perfectly good and easy to drink, but nothing really special. If I'm going to devote an evening to a big stout, it wont be this one."
"Big coffee taste will drink again!"
"This is a drinkable double stout. The ABV isn't noticeable and there's little alcohol warmth or burning. It would go well with anything chocolate."
"Overall, a nice and flavorful stout with good balance. A bit one dimensional at times though. Definitely enjoyable and smooth though."
"Pours a pitch black colour with thick tan head. Little bit of lacing and some head retention. Smells of chocolate roasted malt and bit of earthy hops. Taste has a mild sweetness from the chocolate, but with a nice amount of bitterness too. Very well balanced stout. Smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden in the flavour."
"This is an awesome imperial stout, if I could buy this locally I would have a number of bottles in my cellar."
"D: For 8.8%, this is an incredabley drinkable beer that i wish i could get more of. Please distribute in MO. I have to go to AZ to get Green Flash."
"Cheers!"
"1262"
"Overall, Green Flash really has a class A stout here. I'd love to see this one Bourbon Barrel Aged to add complexity, that would make this stout almost perfect."
"Drinkability -- Quite good. Not necessarily mind-blowing. Very much enjoyed the hop finish. Absolutely worth a try."
"This is a vey solid stout by green flash. It pours jet black almost the thickness of maple syrup. There was a 1 inch head that sat around for a long time. The taste wasn't very heavy but still had enough body to insure you this bad boy was a stout. It tasted of chocolatey and mocha with a slight hint of alcohol. Overall this beer is very drinkable with out slot of the fullness you feel after drinking a stout."
"Taste - For double/imperial stout you get a medium mouth feel, mainly from the oats used. Up front you get rich roasted malt character. At colder temperatures it goes down very smooth and leaves a dry finish. As with most dark beers, as you let it warm up, the true characters of the beer come into play. You still get the rich roastyness on the front of your tongue but as it gets to mid tongue you get slightly sweet coffee notes just before the Target hops balance out the malts before going too sweet light some double/imperial stouts do. It finishes with bitter-sweet roasted notes and the 8.8% ABV makes its presence known. Overall the Double Stout is one smooth drinker."
"OVERALL: A decent imperial oatmeal stout, but nothing mind blowing. A little too heavy on the oats perhaps, and the palate is a little weaker than it needs to be, but still a decent brew worth checking out. There are others in the style I would reach for first, however."
"O: Buy again? No. Recommend it? Yes."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, good kick, nice representation of style, this beer has a good complexity to it and it's a good alternative when you want a big stout that isn't too big. Overall it's a good beer to drink for a long time."
"D - A very good double stout. Couldn't detect th e8% ABV at all. This beer is worth some hype and I will definitely buy it again."
"2008 vintage sampled in May 2010. The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is a nice mix of roasted malt, chocolate and smoke. The flavor is pretty heavy on the chocolate with some roasted malt. The mouthfeel is a little too thin for me and is a tad bit watery. Medium carbonation."
"Right out of my fridge it was a little cold at first but as it warmed it started to show its stuff. The aromas are intensely roasty, malty and chocolaty. The mouthfeel is medium which is a nice counterpart to the heavily roasted malt. I am glad the sweetness is on the light side. Medium finish where the bitterness starts to show."
"Pours from the 22 oz bottle a thick, dense black color, topped with a bit of dark tan head. Aromas of chocolate, licorice and freshly brewed coffee. Flavors of roasted malt, bitter chocolate and coffee. A little thin on the palate, but not a bad beer."
"D - Lovely anytime that operating heavy machinery is not needed. I enjoyed it and would again and again."
"Luscious mocha brown head dances for a half minute and retreats exposing a few active tiny bubble centres. Medium carbonation, midnight black, nice looking stout! Coffee bean odour, lots of vanilla oakiness going on. Regeneration impressive. This double stout is very full bodied, rich, intense, chocolate flavours with a bit of underlying dark fruit. Interesting blend of sweetness and dry, ashy astringent nuttiness including almond and pecan. Nice complexity, wonderful stuff!"
"D - This is a delicious stout, very well balanced, and the earthy notes are very nice. As with most Imperials, one 22 oz is probably enough, but this is relatively easy to drink, but too heavy to have too much of."
"Glad I found it, if you are looking for a trade, give me a shout"
"Like I said this brew was a surprise. I did miss this brew when it was gone, and it was better than a top 100 brew that we cracked in the same sitting"
"Beautiful appearance, nearly completely black with lacing throughout. A little thinner than I thought it would be, giving the appearance. Taste reminds me of dark fruit, maybe dates or raisins, with nice smokiness underneath. Would definitely try again."
"D - Drinks well."
"d - Thought this was a very enjoyable stout. Nice smooth chocolate smell and taste, would definitely try this again."
"The brew is good, but looks alot better then it tastes for me. I was expecting a more thick, robust flavor and mouthfeel. Instead I am getting burnt malts and the alcohol tastes. The drinkability is cut short due to the alcohol taste being so apparent. It is good - not a ""special"" brew for me."
"Poured out of a bomber size (22 oz) into an arrogant bastard pint glass. After cracking it I took a whif straight from the bottle and it smelled awesome, bottom line it spoke its name. After pouring the look of it was exactly as I would expect, black. It was already dark in the room but it did seem to me to be a somehow impossibly miniscule lighter amount of black than some other imperial stouts I've had. The head was off-tan reddish which I love to see, it always seems to be one of the trademarks of a solid cappuccino flavored stout. After tasting, the smell and the look of the beer had already defined the flavor of this brew, no surprises in that. Roasted malt and whatever hops they threw in give it a SOLID coffee flavoring, like the dark roasted kind of coffee that I love to drink, bold and in your face. This is balanced with a sweetness that comes in very smoothly and to me remains very camouflaged and in the background of the flavoring. The finish has a little carbonation which brings out the initial flavors even more which again is balanced well with the sweetness in the beer. Definitely a recommendable beer, I mean there are others out there which are better so I can't say this is a must have but seriously if you get a chance try this bad boy!"
"D-this is a pretty solid offering for a double stout. the flavors and aromas are relatively big. it is pretty straight forward and somewhat conservative; but still good."
"FULL BODIED! Smooth and mellow. a decent big stout."
"While this is far from the most powerful double stout on the market it is certainly an enjoyable one. It is somewhat refreshing to see a stout that isn't trying to be the biggest, smack-you-in-the-face stout in the world. Well worth a visit."
"The original formula is a good one. But could you imagine if that light phenolic edge was removed from the equation? It would be even better. Regardless, another good one from the folks of Vista, and a recommended pick by me."
"D- i like that this is a very dry and relatively low ABV big stout. most that i try are on the sweet side. i also like that this bottle cost me around 5$. ill check this one out somewhat often."
"D: Another very good beer from Green Flash. Great flavor, with a slightly lighter body than most Imperial Stouts, make this one very easy to drink."
"Taste, quite nice, and damn if there aren't some good imperial stouts out there, but this one is pretty middle of the road for the good ones. Nothing adventurous to set it apart from a lot of the upper echelon stouts. And I don't mean that condescendingly, when you want a stout that has no frills, and delivers, this stout could be your cleanup hitter. Mouthfeel and drinkability, especially, are good. Mouthfeel loses .a little for not seeming as robust towards the end."
"A solid DIS. I would say it is borderline to be classified as a lesser stout - non double or perhaps a RIS. Although I'm sure the differences are very subtle."
"Overall this beer did lots of things well, nothing bad, but nothing exceptional. Very close to being great but not quite there. Smooth and easy-drinking and worth a shot."
"Good stuff! ~"
"Drinkability is high on this one. Very nice strong stout, that doesn't go overboard. The flavors are strong, but not overpowering. And while a 22 oz took a while to finish, it was certainly enjoyable, and never too strong. Good stuff."
"Dr. 22 oz. went down easily. Once you adjust to the chocolate and coffee in an old sock left on the burner taste, it's great."
"Update 9/20/2013 - this is superior on cask!"
"D= A bit boozy, but all in all a very good offering. Not as smooth as its competitors, but worth drinking all the same."
"Nicely done, super solid, nothing crazy double stout. Great job Green Flash."
"Pitch black colored stout with a slowly fading creamy head.Aroma is coffee grinds.Taste is smoked malts,chocolate,coffee,cream and sugar cane.Very creamy and velvety smooth goes down like silk.Highly recommended and I would purchase again.Two for two for this brewery!!"
"Mouthfell is medium to medium-full, good carbonation levels. This beer impressed the hell out of me. I really didn't have any expectations at all, but if I did it would have exceeded them. Buy this beer."
"D- Good stout overall.. great for the cold weather because of its earthyness. The mouthfeel is great."
"Overall, this is a pretty good double stout. However, this beer seemed to get less complex over time. It seemed to become more one deminsionable. I would recommend this stout to lovers of the style."
"The flavor is a little less intense than my favorites (i.e. Hercules, World Wide Stout) but, again, it's up there. This is a good one to get and if you're on the east coast, can be a buck or two cheaper than the others (must be good distribution)."
"D: I found this to be an enjoyable beer. It's very well balanced, rather than over the top bitter like some takes on this style. A nice sipping beer for a cold evening."
"D - This is a very nice imperial stout. Lighter than most but still very good."
"D: Man oh man. If there is such a thing as a sessionable Imperial Stout, then this is it. The alcohol is totally non-intrusive and the complexities of this only increase as it comes up to temp. This is a great stout!"
"Pours black with thick tan head that lasts a long time and leaves thick lacing. SMELL faint at first and hard to find, but later easy to find, richer and more complex. Vaguely fruity, roasty, malty sweetness creeps in. Coffee, molasses and booze also. TASTE is roasty, coffee, chocolate, fruity, and some malty sweetness dance around each other early and through the middle. Roasty flavors and bitterness then take the lead, with some fruity, sweet and boozy notes adding complexity. some bitterness in the finish. Smooth. FEEL thick, full, rich texture and body. Smooth and luxurious. OVERALL delicious, rich treat. But easy drinking for those who like bold stouts."
"22 ounce bottle, I think it's about a year old. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a dark brown/black color with an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, dark fruit (cherries) and some coffee and hops. It's a nice smelling brew, however the aroma is light. Taste is similar to the aroma (but much stronger), it tastes like coffee, roasted malt, bittersweet and milk chocolate, cherries, charred/burnt malt, and a bit of vanilla and hops. There's also a nice bitter coffee and hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's rich, and also a bit coating, silky and dry. Drinkability is very good, it's smooth and easy to drink. I think this is a pretty good brew overall, I don't think I've had a bad beer from Green Flash yet. I'd definitely buy this again in the future."
"The best beer i have had this year."
"D - Pretty good. Green Flash impresses me again. Their fairly affordable bombers routinely blow me away."
"From a bomber to a pint glass. Pours pitch black with a one finger dark tan head (once it settles). Leaves plenty of healthy lacing down the glass. The smell right off it chocolate, it pretty much dominated over any other smell. A bit of roasted malts comes out of the smell and if you really try looking for it some coffee, not much, is somewhat apparent. The taste was a bit lighter than I was expecting. Chocolate up front, followed by coffee in the aftertaste. I guess when I say light I mean it's not as flavorful as I was hoping, though there is plenty of flavor. Really it's like a mild chocolate. Typical mouthfeel for the style though may be a little thin. This one's got a higher alcohol content but really it's not noticeable at all in the taste. Very easily drinkable and that chocolate that stands out makes it that way. I enjoy most if not all I've had from Green Flash so it was no surprise I'd like this one especially since I love the style. I'd pick this one up again no problem and probably will. Good stuff."
"D: This started out amazing for me, but it became harder to drink the more I had. Still, a very solid stout. Pretty much dessert in a bottle."
"Gone in no time flat as this stuff drinks down way to easy and smooth with an amazing tone of creamy tang and chocolatey roast and easing bittering dryness. A super nice stout by Green Flash!"
"Very nice bitter malts that are present all throughout. Predominantly coffee, but some nice bitter chocolates and the creaminess of half-n-half. A little bit wet yet a side of crunchiness to it."
"""Big, bold, flavorful, and complex"" ... just as advertised on the bottle."
"Flavors are all roasted grain, bitter burnt coffee and dark unsweetened chocolate. Flavors are very good but for some reason seem simple and somewhat one dimensional. Tasty and well made and the finish is quite good. Something is missing just a bit but this is a pretty nice stout."
"Taste is dense and chewy but never sweet. Notes of chocolate yield to a more roasted character and finish with a bit of hop bitterness. Quite smooth on the feel with a full body. Easy drink for its size but limited a but by the filling nature of the body."
"Pours a deep chocolate color with some visibility through the pour. Frothy tan head lines the glass. Nose is nothing spectacular with plenty of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts. Quaff is sweeter than expected. Plenty of chocolate and bitter coffee hits the palate. Mouthfeel is full bodied. Middle of July in St. Louis isn't probably the best time to drink this style, but oh well. Solid DS from Green Flash brewing Co."
"D - This fine imperial stout from Green Flash boasts a complex, well-rounded flavor profile with lots of malt character and a good bit of hop bitterness."
"D- Could have finished the whole bottle by myself. The alcohol while not sessionable is not terribly high either which helped out also. I finished my portion in no time."
"The body is moderate and a bit lacking for style. Carbonation is a bit much which brings out a the bitterness and astringency. Overall there are some good notes, with the chocolate and roast but I am looking for a bit more depth overall. Still very drinkable."
"It's a very good, no frills strong stout. This beer doesn't try to do anything fancy. The appearance is simple, black liquid and brown creamy head. Chocolate, coffee and roasted malt flavors are strong in the beer's aroma. The flavor is rich and just nails my notion of the style. I'm not saying that it's my very favorite stout, but it's a superbly made stout. The feel is excellent, creamy and smooth. I really underestimate Green Flash. They make some great beer."
"A big beautiful chocolate brown head reaches four fingers quickly from the pour. Fades very slowly and becomes rocky as it does. Leaves waves of lace. Body sits in my Duvel glass used motor oil black. Nose has tones of roasty malt, burnt coco, raw minerals, black olives and pickled meat. Enters the mouth very roasty. The malt comes of almost burnt, dry and slightly bitter. Some creamy dark chocolate notes develop mid palate as you drink. There may be a dusting of powdery, peppery spice also. Mouthfeel is a dry, bitter richness. Hops play in balancing this brew nicely. Bold and attractively drinkable."
"Pours a two finger light tan head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Black color, no highlights. Light-medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Chocolate nose. Flavor is chocolate with a bakers chocolate finish. Decent stout. $7.15 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"D: Flavorful and smooth. Even with the abv a pleasant drink."
"This is a really great Impy that is value for the level of complexity involved $8 Canadian in Vancouver. Big Black and very luscious with just the right complexity on the finish. I put this on par with Old Rasputin and Brooklyn with all the right notes tied up with a high level of drinkability. I will buy more of this to cellar as it is a style that can always do with some aging"
"A great beer. Great beer."
"Split a bomber this past weekend with my brother. Poured into pint glasses. Thick as tar looking, and had a black color like ink. Loads of coffee and roasted barley smell rises from the glass. Taste was stellar. Caramelized sugar and dark chocolate emerge with the first sip. Great combination of sweetness and bitterness in this stout. Mouthfeel was very hearty and thick, but it was also very hot with that boozy alcohol feeling. This beer was mostly easy to drink, but because of its pronounced abv%, one needs to drink this on the slow side. A really fine stout from a brewery that I thought only made really nice hoppy beers."
"D - this is a stupid good double stout. great hoppy flavor really brings out the roasted malts and adds to the depth. this is one fine stout from one of my current favorite stouts."
"Drinkability is great smooth sweet drinkable goodness. Goes down so easy not alcohol noted. Buy this one if you like big stouts, have already bought more this will be in my regular stout rotation now."
"Notes: This falls just a tad short of being a top-notch American Stout. In my opinion, if the alcohol were masked a little better, it would be. Having said that, this is still a really, really good beer that I hope gets better with some time in the cellar. Kudos to Green Flash for another winner!"
"Not as good as Stone IRS or Great Divide yeti...but definitely up there. Most appealing is the smell. Mouthfeel is a bit weak. I have had on draught and the MF is beter. Excellent beer. GF does it again!"
"Overall, this is one the best stouts that I've tasted. It has it all...sweetness, coffee bitterness, and is very easy to drink. I will be keeping this one on hand. Highly recommended."
"This poured exactly like a Guinness with the weird slow settling. The rocky and frothy brown head formed some awesome lacing. The aroma was malty, coffeeish and chocolately. The taste was of coffee, dark belgian chocolate and bittering hops This was slightly drying The mouthfeel was way too light for a stout. It was thin but smooth."
"Very drinkable for the style, not a struggle to finish a bomber at all."
"And it's disappeared twice as fast too! Although I shouldn't really be surprised by how much I'm enjoying this stout nor that it seems this one bomber won't be enough. Come to think of it, every bomber of Green Flash I've had - Barleywine (10%), Imperial IPA (9%), Le Freak (9.2%) - have been no problem to finish and in all cases left me yearning for even more. I'll take note and be sure not to buy just one bottle of this next time around."
"Upon further sipping, the taste is almost overly sweet from the molasses, but the thick mouthfeel combined with the roasted goodness balances it all out. Full-bodied, refined, and very strong on the palate. It's also quite alcoholic, as my cognition of the outside world is quickly going numb. Ahhhh, a good Imperial Stout with an exceptional look, taste, and mouthfeel. Taste is foremost though. Good job Green Flash, and good job FO1 for putting it on tap."
"Pours an oily pitch black, a whopping two inch head of tan color, sits there for several minutes before receding to a thick foam, and lacing spiderwebs before disintegrating into a multitude of spots. Aroma is kinda weak, but nice notes of oats, toasted malt, chocolates, a bit of coffee. Taste is full, mouth is thick and silky smooth, finely carbonated, drying into the finish. Notes of coffee, dark chocolate, toasted malt, hop oils, but mostly its about the thick , chewy malts. Very nice to drink, tasty, purchased for only $5, can't go wrong with this one."
"smooth, malty, delicious and inviting with a solid malty complexity leading to a balanced finish with hops clearing it out. an excellent stout without any trace of the alcohol, i cant wait to age a couple and tip 'em back"
"Black body with a creamy head of tan foam that puffs itself above the glass rim. Laces nicely and retains a ring at the edge with some broken skim across the surface. Slighty sweet yet dry chocolate aroma. Tobacco, malted milk ball, and chocolate comprise the major flavors. Dry in the aftertaste but still vaguely sweet. Full bodied, but retaining a certain lightness about it. Very clean and easy drinking, defined by an authentic stouty character..."
"this was a good one to end the night with - poured very nicely into a stout glass - put up a nice 2 finger tan head - light in the aroma , coffee, chocolate, roasty malty - taste follows thru with a sweet malt finish - easy drinking - nice lacing - a solid stout - not as robust as other imperial stouts - good nonetheless."
"Overall: Pretty good. I can't demerit this for anything, it's a solid stout, although nothing really popped out at me. It was pretty average for the course."
"Good stuff!"
"D: Well, this is absolutely a dessert beer because it does have a nice sweetness to it. As a dessert beer, it does have drinkability for that category. I think this beer is absolutely good, hence the straight 4's, but it is a bit one dimensional via all this sweetness. With that said, it sits well with a bit of weight and satisfies. Will drink again given the chance. Another fine brew by Green Flash."
"Aroma was of bitter chocolate and coffee. Taste was very much the same but had a real nice bite for the first sip. The bitterness of the coffee came through then you were left with well rounded smoothness. In the mouth it left a little bit of an off flavor. It seemed creamy like an oatmeal stout. Overall it was a well crafted brew."
"At first the bitterness is maybe a bit much, sort of bombarding you on too many levels without giving you a break to enjoy the intricacies of such a brew. As you progress and the beer warms some of the smaller notes become identifiable. Still, I don't think more than one of these in a night would be on my agenda. All around, another solid brew from Green Flash."
"Very smooth, finishes with low carbonation. Low dryness in the finish but enough of it so it doesn't feel too sweet."
"Green Flash gets lost in the shuffle when the conversation turns to great California craft breweries, but that's only because there's such an abundance of excellence in the Golden State. Double Stout is yet more evidence that their lineup is rock-solid from top to bottom. Only $4.99 per bottle is icing on the cake."
"D: very good. will have again."
"D: at 8.8% ABV I wouldn't expect to drink these all night, but I've had stronger Imperials where the alcohol was better hidden. Still, I'm left /wanting/ more even if I know better :)"
"A nice deep, rich, black stout with a touch of ruby glow in the light, not even enough to say highlight. A vigorous pour gets a creamy toffee colored head which laces nicely, and sticks around for awhile. Smells good biscutty start, rolling into alcohol and finishing with the floral boquet of a west coast stout. The taste starts with coffee and chocolate, but quickly rolls into hop bitterness, finishing with a floral sweetness. It's smooth on the tongue but a little dry in the finish not one to drink all night."
"This is quite a hoppy imperial stout, but it's balanced nicely and overall very solid. Great drinkability and a reasonable price make this one that I would certainly consider coming back to."
"Another super sipper for Super Sunday, tasty brew for all to sample."
"Overall, this beat my expectations and I will be getting this again for sure!"
"Drinkability: Insanely drinkable overall, though I'd be willing to bet if they bottle the bourbon barrel aged version, people'd go crazy. Worth checking out to put it mildly. Green Flash can do it all."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, chewy, fruity, with balanced cocoa, fruit, raisins, and espresso mixed with cream all in a smooth, luscious finish."
"PS. Referring to the bottle photo... NOW THAT is how you take a photo of a beer bottle. Damn, nice bokeh."
"Deep chocolate first sip, nice bitterness. Full bodied Double Stout with big flavor. Bitter and roasty mouthfeel finishing dry, with a slight twinge of 8.8%. Very drinkable and very well balanced. Methinks Green Flash can do no wrong."
"Jet black and I mean jet black, like a brick of onyx. Pours an agitated two-finger head of dark brown froth, mixed of bubbles large and small, lacing mostly larger bubbles and slides off quickly. Gargantuan melted chocolate and cappuccino coffee driven nose, after that very similar toffee and butterscotch accents, hint of cherry or blackberry fruit, no hops discerned, you'll either say it has purity of purpose or is monochrome. Very full-bodied, grips the tongue like a vise, while slow to move you sense it's a choice, not because it's not capable. Tastes like three slices of German chocolate cake washed down with cafe con leche. Grape, cherry, apricot, plum fruit, much variety in this department. Roasty and toasty more than bitter, you pucker nonetheless. Consistently becomes drier through the mid-palate, suggesting the hops having more textural effect than flavor-wise. Not really ""chewy"" since it resists chewing on it. There's a sense of accomplishment when the glass is finally empty."
"Dark bomber. Good chocolate and secondary roast and coffee in aroma. Pours black with above average carbonation and above average mouthfeel. Roasted flavour builds up over repeated glasses. Flavour is not too chocolate. A bomber is a lot to drink.Balanced."
"22oz bottle. Brownish black pour. Brown head, long lasting, but no real lacing to speak of. Great aromas. Mocha coffee and burnt malts. Taste is the same strong coffee, slight mocha and a little bit bitter with alcohol in the finish. Very full body. Improves as it warms a little also. Very nice finishing, undervalued example of the style. Worth seeking out for a try."
"Poured a 22oz bomber into my Unibroue tulip. This beer pours a India ink black with a huge 3 inch dark beige head that leaves a substantial amount of lacing as the head recedes down the glass. The aroma is, well, rather stouty. Nothing spectacular. There are definite notes of dark chocolate and strong coffee. There are definite notes of ruff graininess. The taste follows suit but less spectacularly. The flavor is dark chocolate and coffee. Nothing really exciting or provoking. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy leaving a coating of dark chocolate on the palate. This in my opinion is really just an average Imperial Stout. Its good, but its nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary. It's the basics of what any good tasting stout is. No more, no less."
"Overall a solid stout done the Green Flash way. I am very happy I tried it. They keep making very good/great beers. Congrats."
"Drinkability: In the end, this a great dark roasted Double Stout from Green Flash. If you like staring into complete darkness while drinking a beer that's a cross between a black roasted coffee and a chocolate milk shake, then this is your Stout! What it lacked in the aroma, it made up for it in the appearance and the mouthfeel. For me, I wouldn't mind another one of these. It's easily affordable and it's full of dark roasted goodness."
"Still good for a once-in-a-while infusion of ""heavy."""
"7/5/7/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"The beer looks beautiful with a nice large head and extremely black. The beer barely had any nose to it. I am really disappointed that it had a SLIGHT bit of a caramel and that's it. The flavours that came out are roasty malts, chocolate, a bit of alcohol, some bitterness, and a fruitiness that was the biggest flavour. A bit too fruity for me, but still tasty. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but it's okay. It's decently drinkable as well."
"From a 22 oz bottle this poured a jet back with big tan head and good sticky lacing. Nose of burnt malts, chocolate, coffee and ripe fruit. Rich creamy mouthfeel. Flavor is much the same as the nose, with additional coffee and some brown sugar notes. Nice dry bitter finish. For beer this robust it was quite easy to drink. The subtitle on the bottle which says Double Stout is due to its 8.8% ABV value."
"D: A warming sipper."
"D: 8.8%? Could've fooled me. The alcohol is well hidden. Goes down so smooth. Absolutely sinful. If I had access to this it would always be in my fridge. Fantastic impy stout. Love the Flash.."
"The feel is milky and creamy. Really smooht. A ""wet"" stout for sure. Overall, this is more like a proter. A little bit of sweet chocolate, a tad of bitter coffee. Perfectly balanced."
"Pours a solid black with a fluffy smallish mocha head. Leaves a bit of lace on the sides on the way down the hatch. Smells of chocolate, roasted coffee, slight spicy hop in the background. As it warms I get some dried fruits as well. Taste is chocolate followed by some hop bite finishing with some roast and hops that linger in the palette for a while. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, thick body, light carbonation. Great stout, very creamy roasty chocolaty. Send more."
"This was a nicely done American style Double Stout from Green Flash with a chewy and assertive profile that still found good balance with some sweeter tones and a big yet creamy body. A nice flavorful sipper of a Stout."
"Pizza Port Carlsbad. Pours black with a creamy brown head. Sweet chocolate aroma with hints of molasses, toasted oats, and licorice. Rich coffee taste, roasted malt, milk chocolate, and a Chock Full O' Nuts finish. Hearty for just a Stout. Very good."
"Bottle from BevMo! in Vacaville. Pours a really pretty black with a 1 inch light brown, creamy head. Beautiful. Smells of decadent dark chocolate nibs, truffles, cocoa powder. Awesome aroma, i want to just sit here and smell it all night (well, actually, no). Flavor is a reminder of the wonderful smell; up front, its nice deep, rich chocolate, almost like a pure chocolate drink with a bit of alcohol in it. Other new flavors follow: a distinct coffee bean taste, slightly bitter, with some green-tasting hop residues. Alcohol just barely evident on the finish, which is more chocolate and some nice charred malt. Very nice. Mouthfeel maybe a bit thinner than i'd prefer, a bit watery. Drinks very well...probably my first non-IPA that i've really been impressed with since moving out to CA."
"D - The heavy roast tends to dominate at times and makes it feel thicker than it is but it is still tasty."
"Drinks kind of slow, a bit rough edged, but if you can past that this is a Imp Stout with some complexity"
"Smells smoky and roasted, you know you are in for a treat, tastes mostly like coffee, though you can actually taste the alcohol in there, and the mouthfeel is almost a bit oily, if that makes sense? Overall, a drinkable beer, worth having one and cellaring another two for later."
"Very smooth, lovely stout that is dangerously drinkable at 8.8%."
"D: ABV isn't too bad for the style but it's not the easiest to drink."
"Future outlook: Repeat business likely."
"The first time I had this, it was totally in the wrong conditions. Really hot, sticky weather, and far too many other beers under my belt to truly appreciate it. A hard pour results in a pitch black beer, with a rocky two fingers worth of tan heading. Smell is very earthy, with bits of roasted black coffee bean, soil and bitter unsweetened chocolate. Roasted chocolate and coffee begin the ride with this one, and then leads in to some great blackberry and blueberry notes. Flavors get more fruity and juicy as the beer warms up. Body is very thick, pretty much a meal in a bottle. Heat from the alcohol is not apparent in the flavor, and has not hit me yet after drinking half the bomber, although I expect it will after a few more pulls. It might be difficult to drink an entire bottle to yourself, but still very drinkable and enjoyable....one to sip and enjoy with a pipe or cigar. I am glad I gave this brew another shot, as it is quite a bit better than the first bottle I had of it. I believe I will purchase another bottle of this in the very near future. Cheers"
"another awesome offering from an amazing little brewery."
"The flavors don't back down in the taste, with an alcohol sauce on a solid coffee and chocolate sandwich. A touch of dark fruit can be detected among the roasted java. Hops are in the house as well, providing much needed balance as well as more cover for the booze. This one is thick and oily and as ""ribsticking"" as I can imagine a beer to be. A little heavy on the alcohol but not so bad for 8.8 and kind of goes with the territory for the style. these guys know what they're doing. Try this one."
"Beer pourered black with a nice long lasting brown head. Nose is sweet mocha and malts. Taste is bitter dark chocolate, alcohol,roasted coffee with a fair amount of hops thrown in. Mouthfeel is like an oatmeal stout - medium bodied and very smooth. Overall drinkability is good. This is definitely a very nice cool season brew to have. Would recommend to fans of stouts."
"Ruby rich flavors of espresso, brandy and cream. Nice bitter hop in the finish--subtle but balancing. Good body with a little oiliness from the alcohol. A wonderful stout."
"Smelled of richly sweet malt and chocolate and figgy fruit. Tastes of sweet chocolately goodness and smooth malt. This is a tastey and satisfying brew. Very smooth on the palate, no bitterness on the end, a nice drinking beer, but a session brew by no means at 8.8%. I enjoyed every sip."
"An under the radar, damn nice, oatmeal imperial."
"Drinkability: nice flavored beer, but alcohol will bring this down a notch. Great American stout."
"Very dark, pretty much black, not much in the way of edges even. It looked flat off the pour, but a dense cap of dark tan bubbles rose to coat the surface. Some stickage, good head retention. Big sweet, malty aroma with lots of toffee and caramel, roast and milk chocolate notes along with some licorice. Sturdy bitterness with hop notes appearing towards the end. Caramel up front with some chocolate and roast throughout, anise in the finish. Overly phenolic though, a little out of balance. Mild warmth with just a hint of alcohol in the flavour. Full bodied with fine carbonation. Overall, not bad. Fairly drinkable for a relatively big beer."
"Near black with ruby highlights and a dense, creamy tan head with solid retention. Smell is rich roasted malt with a light milky chocolate undertone. Taste is much of the same. Nice roast coffee and a touch of smoke. Some chocolate and a light cherry flavor or something like that. It's not too dark and has a little tartness to it at times. Also a noticeable hop presence, though it's not overwhelming by any means. A creamy smooth mouthfeel with a light tingle on the tongue. Very good body. Overall it's a solid and drinkable brew. Not a whole lot of depth to it but it's simple and tasty for sure."
"Green Flash beers are always a wonderful experience, and this is no exception. There are certainly more complex stouts out there, but this one has tons of flavor and that's all that counts in the end."
"Overall a very successful stout and from a company that prides itself on big hoppy IPAs. I also like how the bottle doesn't scream ""imperial"" or ""double"" or ""Russian."" It's just simply STOUT and a big juicy one at that."
"This one drinks right in line with its weight class. It's a very very very good one but it's quite hefty. Sip and savor."
"This beer is the equivalent of the late great Issac Hayes voice."
"M + D: A 'robust medium body.' Not full, rich and creamy, but it has presence. A rather unique flavour works well with this feel, and makes for an intriguing drink. A nice effort on the style - I'd get more."
"Another masterpiece from Green Flash. For an imperial stout, this how relatively lower abv and much higher drinkability. The appearence is pitch black, with aromas of bittersweet chocolate. The taste is roasted, but well balanced with some hops shining through at the end. Well made, and can be enjoyed all night long."
"D- This is a solid Imperial Stout that is definitely worth a shot. Another great beer from Green Flash."
"D- Very easy to drink but I think its a sipper. Might be a little risky trying to drink more than one on a sitting but I'm sure it can be done."
"D: Drinks wonderfully. It's pretty rich and filling, but for this style it's great. Not one you would have with a meal for the most part, but would be great with some cheese or by itself."
"Overall a fine double stout. Certainly one i would purchase again. I dont think this one will benefit too much from any extended aging, but im gonna put one away just in case. Im hoping some of the bitterness will reduce just a bit. Those of who love a good bit of bitterness in your big stouts, seek this one out, and be pleased. Good beer."
"this is a perfectly balanced stout, not to sweet, not too hoppy (surprising considering who made it), it literally warms as it goes down..ideal for the cold weather!"
"A very good imperial stout. I'd put it below the Rasputin, Stone, and some of the other well known imperials, but it holds it own."
"Drinkability: The overall bitterness makes this beer a little harder to enjoy. Definitely an above average stout, just not one at the top of my list."
"D - Good stout but a little to sweet for me."
"Nice to see Green Flash bottling some of their more adventurous brews, this and Le Freak being the standouts, a bit expensive for what it is but still quite enjoyable, would drink again, this brew should be interesting to age, recommended"
"This beer pours very dark with a beautiful 3 fingered tan/brown head, and nice lacing. The smeel is of toasted malts and butter. The flavor is very nice a nice mixture of chocolate and coffee flavors, neither flavor overpowers the other. A nice and smoothe beer, the carbonation level seems good. I could see myself drinking a few of these in a night but not an all nighter, the ABV is a little lower than I look for in a double stout but the flavors are very nice."
"Drinkability - a fine double stout. Worth trying. Not a show stopper but worth trading for."
"D - Good, but could age longer and the roasted malt flavor could shine through more."
"Drinkability- Pretty good brew here. If you like the hops in your stout, this one is up your alley. Overall a good deal and worth a try."
"This is a really good double stout. I'd recommend it. Very smooth and tasty."
"Recommended by employee of Derby Street Wine & Spirits in Hingham, MA. Glad it was suggested to me. Pours a dark brown, excellent nose, but the taste puts this Green Flash offering in the top 10% of all stouts. Great malty presence with a deep undercarriage of flavors without any of the the alcohol burn. Overall, a superior stout."
"Drinkability: A very complex brew, that begs to be sipped and explored."
"Solid stout that throws big sweetness, bitterness, and rich creaminess all together. Challenging but pretty damn good."
"Pours a dark dark brown with a healthy tan head. Smells of coffee, chocolate, smoke. Tastes of coffee, chocolate, smoke, roasted nuts, molasses, licorice, all in a nice combination. No single flavor sticks out and grabs you; it's just a nice mix. Lingering smoke/licorice aftertaste. Very smooth and creamy texture, almost like it was from a nitro tap. All in all, a first rate stout."
"D- amazing double stout that warms well, smells phenominal, and tastes fabulous, highly recomended brew"
"D: Very enjoyable on what has turned into an August stout tasting. Very good. Definitely something that imperial stout lovers should seek out."
"Pours a very nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy tan head, which leaves some sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, lots of nice chocolate/toffee/caramel notes. The taste is big and malty, dark chocolates hit next, with some slight bitterness. Medium body, the alcohol is hidden very well with this brew. Very drinkable, a joy to drink, Thanks Joe."
"Full bodied, rather high carbonation, mostly clean finish, not much booziness."
"Drinkability - You never want to guzzle a big beer like this, but I swear this went down quicker than just about any other sample of the style I've had before. This is just a damn good-drinking dark brew and another winner for this accomplished brewery which is highly-regarded in the beer community."
"D- This beer needs to be sipped, however it's still enjoyable and I would certainly not be opposed to popping a second one when I'm done."
"Gorgeous black color with a sizeable dark tan head on top. Low aroma-sort of ink smelling and a metallic odor going on. Dark chocolate flavor with a sharp hop bite behind it. Dry cocoa powdery taste. Slight metallic or coppery flavor. Velvety smooth and full bodied. Silky. Very drinkable-dessert in a glass. The slight metallic flavor detracts a bit but a killer, killer beer none the less. Dont know how long this has been out but I grabbed it the minute I saw a Greenflash Stout."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy brown head that lasts. The aroma is perfect. It has a smooth, rich chocolatey scent that boasts of black malts and sweet chocolate; just the way I like it. The taste is great. It is silky smooth all the way down. It's sweet up front with a stiff roasted backbone. It's laced with chocolate and coffee flavors; exceptional. The mouthfeel is perfect. It's a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tremendous stout. I love the flavor profile and the excellent mouthfeel; another winner from this fabulous brewery!"
"22 oz bottle. Pours a very dark brown/black that is opaque with a 1 cm tight bubbly brown head that is mostly diminishing. Aroma is mostly chocolate with some alcohol, malt, and dark fruit. Initial flavor is sweet chocolate that becomes more bitter and almost sour. Light carbonation, medium to full body, alcohol presence throughout, and moderate lacing. Overall a very solid stout worth a try as its availability continues to expand."
"A very enjoyable stout - English-like with an American flair for bigger. As I was on my patio drinking this a neighbor passed by (while in the second half of the bottle) smoking a cedary cigar. Though I'm not a cigar smoker, the aroma enhanced it even more, so if you are a cigar smoker, you may want to enjoy the second half with a cedary cigar! Job well-done here!"
"an OK stout, not worth looking high and low for but not bad to give it a shot..."
"I'll happily buy this again. But won't go out of my way for it either. ALl in all a solid double stout from Green Flash."
"A pretty easy drinking beer. Not much to disappoint or excite."
"D - This is a pretty good, interesting double stout. Definitely a nice one to sip and some might find the medium body as a plus in the drinkability department but I think it should be beefed up a little."
"Drinkability: Nice beer. Worth a try, but nothing amazing to me."
"D: This one was shared so I did not get the chance to try to finish a bomber myself. I think I could though it is rather enjoyable."
"Kind of like a big oatmeal stout. Good stuff."
"This certainly makes for a good dessert brew."
"Overall a very nice drinking I'll be enjoying more of."
"D: This is a very drinkable stout and an excellent stout in general. I would seek this one out."
"Recommended..."
"Dark brown nearly black color with a small, beige head of foam. Nose is awfully light smelling, mostly hop accented with some malt character but the nose overall is disappointing. It's a hoppy stout, mostly hop accented with citrus notes and lots of bitterness. Malts are a bit over roasted and unbalanced, lots of bitter chocolate and coffee ground notes, but it could show some more fruit character. Pretty brash and not a lot of complexity or overall balance."
"Pours an opaque darkness with a full finger foamy dark tan head that fades to surface fairly quickly, leaving spotty patterns of lacing behind. Needs to warm up pretty good, but the smell will get your attention. Initially an almost pungent roasted character, but upon further 'consideration' complexities are revealed like the rings of an onion. A dark fruit thing comes through and something that comes across with some bitterness takes on a licorice-like character with a cocoa accompaniment. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied, smooth and coating. Full flavored, the taste is also complex. Scoring points for imagination and creativity! A classic Double Stout; molasses, cocoa, java, licorice and a cherry/vanilla barrel-aged character. Too cool! A ton of stuff to consider. 22oz is definitely not enough of a sample to dignify this one. A real easy drinker...the 8.8% ABV may 'kick in' at some point. Highly recommended!"
"Notes: A good brew, but it does strike me as being slightly one-dimensional."
"22 ouncer, dark, strong and sludgy, just like a double stout should be. This one has that San Diego sizzle that I have come to love from GF. Pours near black , leaves great sheeting/lacing. Cocoa, and cafe au lait nose, bold notes of bitter chocolate and coffee, drying resiny hops late. Just wonderful stuff. Go get some of this SD style Impy/double stout."
"This beer poured pitch black and formed a medium tan foam head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, chocolate, coffee and anise. Flavor was of malt, molasses, chocolate and a hint of coffee. The body is medium light, which is unusual for the style. The finish is bittersweet and slightly burnt. This is a very good beer, yet the body lacks some complexity I expect from this style."
"Opaque black color, no light at the edges with a thick foamy tan batter-looking head. Aromas of baking chocolate and roasted malts. Flavors mimic the aroma with the addition of a mild earthy hoppiness, and a warm alcohol presence. Fairly standard flavor here, but slightly lacking in depth, though it does have a full-bodied and soft mouth feel. Finishes with powdered cocoa and gentle roast. Not bad, but I probably won't ever be coming this way again."
"D - This is a very nice imperial stout. It's smooth, complex and easy to drink. I'll definitely be bringing it home again."
"Very flavorful but the alcohol isn't masked very well."
"Sampled this at Julio's Springfest and I had to buy a bottle. Served in my DFH snifter. Poured an opaque black. Half-inch, dense, mocha-colored head quickly settled into a thin skim of ringlets and foam. Head was replenished with each vigorous pour. Sheets of watery lacing, but no legs. Nose is all chocolatey goodness. Sweet, sugary and roasty with the slightest hint of alcohol detectable at the back. Taste consistent with nose all the way with the addition of a touch of oats and a kiss of hops. Mouthfeel was smooth; not quite velvety as there was a mild effervescence, but no carbonation burn. Alcohol is present, but more in terms of a warming sensation rather than being overly hot. My first Green Flash, and I was not disappointed. This beer is a winner, but definitely a sipper."
"Smooth with an oaty silkiness, medium-bodied and not at all heavy; another excellent offering from one of my favorite breweries."
"I will always give new Green Flash beers a shot because the West Coast is such a wonderful beer. This was black and smelled delicious. Roasty, smoky smells, dark chocolate, good job. The flavor is nice but not as good as the aroma. Easy to drink because the alcohol is undetectable. Overall this was certainly worth the money but I still think the West Coast IPA and barleywine are their winners."
"My favorite Green Flash brew."
"Very tasty and drinkable as hell."
"D - Nice suds, fun to try."
"D: A quite tasty overall big stout, the oats really bring out the sweetness not a bitter beer at all, very enjoyable."
"Pours a deep black with a thin head that lasts a ring. Aroma is some slight roasted malts, but very weak. The taste is a nice blend of roasted malts, fresh ground coffee and cocoa. The beer is medium bodied with low carbonation and fairly well hidden alcohol. This is a decent stout but doesn't seem like it would benefit from aging."
"Poured a slow and sluggish dark dark brown, like an Imperial Stout should pour. Head was average and dark brown. Nose was roasted, coffee and chocolate but not that promising. Taste followed the nose and mouthfeel was good. taste better as it warmed to room temp. Drakes Imperial was a slightly better choice but along the same flavor, pour and smell but Green Flash was missing the deeper chocolate notes."
"D - This is a great beer overall, and I wish I could get more. I'm reaching for another glass right now..."
"First sip: Hellooo roasted malts. Big-time notes of coffee grounds and baker's chocolate dominate the palate, while some dark raspberry, smoke, and a roasted nuttiness round out the flavor profile. Body is creamy and thick, sitting heavily on the tongue and finishing with a bitter coffee aftertaste. A bit of chalkiness creeps in as the beer warms, but its not too distracting. Overall, there was a nice complexity to this Double Stout, which isn't too surprising. I have to admit, though, I was a bit underwhelmed by this one, considering the fact that it's gotten excellent reviews so far and that I love Green Flash's IPA and IIPA. I might buy it again, but only if I found it somewhere on tap."
"Coffee greets the palate immediately. Wonderful. Chocolate and a hop bite finish the mouthfeel. A very good surprise. I have never heard of Green Flash but with NC getting more and more shit in every day, the state is becomming a beer haven in the south. I highly recommend this beaut."
"Very interesting and unique stout and another great beer from Green Flash. The quality/price ratio on this beer is great at under $6...I enjoyed this much more than the '07 Dark Lord I had the other day."
"About as easy drinking as Double stout gets period. Taste wise this could pass for a milk stout. Alcohol is completely hidden and it has no rough edges at all."
"This stout had one predominant feature upon my sampling...an extreme taste of coffee. Now do understand that I do not drink coffee and do not prefer the taste of coffee. But this stout was still very drinkable pouring a ruby brown with a dark mocha head that fades after a few minutes. You can't taste any presence of alcohol yet a bitterness persists far beyond your sip. I was fortunate enough to get a tap sample in a growler from Bierkraft in Brooklyn NYC. www.bierkraft.com"
"8.8%ABV per label,this new gem to NC poured a jet black no light showing thru this puppy in my 22 oz nonic a frothy one finger light mocha colored head atop.A whole lot going on in the nose dark fruit,charred wood,dark roast coffee,and a bit of leafy hop.This beer is mabey now mabey is one of the new standards of the style I mean the flavors just hammer the taste buds...in a good way of course.Its roasted to the hilt and with a real smoky character but has a sweet dark fruit element to go along with some bitter chocolate and even a touch of vanilla in the finish all along keeping its big roasty-earthy base.Wow this beer blew me away I knew it would be good but this is awesome!One of the best beers of any style to come my way in a real long time."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"D- This is a great flavorful, easy to drink beer, let alone stout. I am glad I live in SD and have easy access to this one. I am interested to see how it fares at the World Cup this week."
"This isn't one of those holy grail hype hounds, just a nice solid go-to imperial stout. Hope to see it around more often."
"Cheers!"
