A flavorful and well balanced oatmeal stout, and one that you should try.","blackcompg","Jun 01, 2014"

Taste does not follow the nose..much more full bodied and developed. Milky, creamy, chocolate. No lactate or sour flavor like a typical oatmeal. Nice and chewy..silky and full in mouthfeel. Overall..aged extremely well and a full bodied flavorful taste..usually don't like oatmeals as much as milk stout, but not in this case.","fgmiele","May 26, 2014"

4.58,11.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,"This is one of those distinctively delicious brews that I never forget. It's about time someone imperialized the traditional oatmeal stout. I've always found the oats in standard ones to generally be much too subtle, if present at all. This is not the case with this. THIS delivers the oats... assertive oats. The oats in this stout will NOT be ignored. This stout will bash you over the head with a big sack of oats... and then you'll ask for more. Or at least I did.","Kuaff","Nov 08, 2013"

The hop bitterness balances the sweet so well it creates the mirage of sweet french-roast coffee w/ cream. And the smoothness in the mouth is unsurpassed.","martyl1000","Nov 04, 2013"

Flavor is chocolate forward with notes of oat, cream, and building bitterness from the roast as the flavor progresses. Full flavor here. Mouthfeel is relatively thin for the gravity, but full bodied nonetheless. Overall, a flavorful imperial stout with nice oat presence.","homebrew311","Oct 17, 2013"

Then again, if there's one thing Southern Tier knows how to make, it's a ridiculously decadent dessert beer. And ridiculously decadent it is - finishing a whole bottle solo can be a chore. However, the fact that I simply can finish this solo is a testament to its solidity. This would have been incredible if the flavor could match up to the mouthfeel, though.","ThisWangsChung","Jun 19, 2013"

4.13,0.7,4,4,4.25,3.75,4.25,"like the other stouts in this little series from southern tier, this is a monster. it pours a frightening dense motor oil black, with little visible carbonation and just a thin film of tan. the darkness of this is insane. it smells oaty indeed, like a bowl of oatmeal, a little sweet, and really heavy from the roasted and burnt barley malt. the flavor is not as sweet as some of their others, but its got all the weighty feel and tastes. the malt is so dark, darker than ive seen really, and would probably be very bitter if it were not for the oats to sweeten it up and round it off. however, they also provide body, so the thickness of this is exacerbated into a freak of fermentable sugars. the alcohol that results is massive, and makes this a must share bottle of beer. it burns on the way down, but I still like the feel. its just so big, so dense and thick, but not stupidly sweet, its really a challenge to me. southern tier has got these huge stouts figured out, and this is the best of the lot really. I might have enjoyed the choklat more, but this is a special beer here, worth seeking out.","StonedTrippin","Jun 13, 2013"

Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, oats, toast, toffee, coffee, cream, dark bread, floral, light nuttiness, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roasted and dark malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, oats, roasted malt, toast, toffee, cream, light char, floral, dark bread, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Light coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark and milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, toffee, oats, light char, cream, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of roasted and dark malt flavors; with big robustness and malt balance, with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic imperial stout! Big robustness and complexity of roasted and dark malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the gravity. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 08, 2013"

I honestly haven't had a bottle in a couple of years, and I am glad to report that it's still great. In fact, I think this is the best stout from Southern Tier. It's oddly under-appreciated, in my opinion. It's big, burly, and sweet, but I don't feel like I have diabetes thanks to the oats. Yum.","angrybabboon","May 10, 2013"

Palate is thick bodied, pungent taste to nose effect. Overall, this is a big shouldered, big daddy.

The aroma offers roast, alcohol heat, oats, bread, chocolate. The taste pretty much follows suit, with perhaps a bit more oat presence than was indicated in the aroma. Lots of flavor, but I find the alcoholic heat a bit obtrusive, keeping this beer from being great. Crackers and biscuits linger, as the beer finishes dry. Medium to full bodied with appropriate carbonation. A solid beer. I bet this would age gracefully.","Huhzubendah","Dec 16, 2012"

The liquid is the expected jet black color, impossible to tell if there are bubbles inside or not, hint of orange at the outermost edges. The nose is all chocolate, toffee, butterscotch and coffee ice cream, probably more flowers than oats although there is a granola, breakfast cereal element going on, might be some plum or cherry fruit there but that chocolate is overwhelming. Full-bodied, lands on the palate with a thud like an anvil. Eventually the carbonation lifts it to create space to move a little, but not much. Blend of both dark and milk chocolate, heavy duty licorice in the mix, vanilla bean, flowers, pine, mint, caramel, molasses and hazelnut coffee too. Once more the oats seem relegated to the background. Gets hoppier retronasally yet without any real sting. Can appear a bit boozy at times.

I smell dark AND a sweeter milk chocolate dark with hints of brown sugar, a strong liqueur, and raisins or other dried dark fruit. Wow, age has been kind to this. For being 11% alcohol(and the boozy nose) I expected more of a boozy taste. This is smoooth and not too bitter. The oat flavor is there but perhaps more in the background than i would expect. Chocolate is the strongest flavor here with a hint of coffee. After the age, id say this beer taxes more like a Belgian style stout than an oatmeal but thats cool.

The taste is rather muted, I can taste the malts and oats but it just seems to be on the faint side. If this is really an imperial I'd expect the flavors to be much more intense. The mouthfeel I thought was thinner than what it looked when it was being poured out. Overall not my favorite brew from Southern Tier.","Knapp85","May 25, 2011"

A very sweet beer here, which sort of detracts from the overall tastes. The taste comes through as roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, sweet dark fruits, and toasted oatmeal.

If you're seeking a super-sweet, syrupy, yet very alcoholic-tasting stout, this one is for you. If that sounds sort of gross, well ... it is. It's complex enough to warrant a taste -- the complexity leaves me feeling open to trying other beers from this brewer -- so if it is a failure, it's at least an ambitious failure.

Flavor is fabulous - fine roast coffee, sweet chocolate, molasses, and a hint of hops. The sweetness is not cloying or overpowering, and the touch of hop bitterness balances this nicely.

There is a caramel and chocolate flavor that does work rather well. Odd mouthfeel to be as smooth as it is with all the burnt remnants involved on the palate.

It was like a liquid candy, but smooth. There's some hidden hops at the back end. The mouthfeel was thick like motor oil, after all, it's 28o Plato. This is what I see as definition of a dessert beer - something that goes great with chocolate, heavy, and something that should be slow sipped. I couldn't go much faster than slow sipping anyway because it was so sweet.

A sweet and sugary scent at the start with touches of dark bread and dried fruit. The taste comes with the sweet oats at the front, followed by hearty flavors of malt, chocolate, and coffee. Dried fruit and bread start to come through midway, then it finishes with a grassy and citrus bitterness, that lingers on the palate for some time. A skim milk texture at the start, then it gradually gains weight to become more full bodied, more of a two percent milk feel. The back of the palate is left very dry and tacky.

Caramel, dry fruits and even a banana aroma? Maybe it's just me. Coffee and chocolate of course, and a hint of oats. Tastes of bitter chocolate and cold coffee. A little astringent, needs a bit more malt to smooth it out. It may be the heat of the alcohol that is contributing to the bitterness. Could certainly see this aging well.

I'd have to rank this third in the Blackwater Series behind Jahva (technically this scores better due to mouthfeel) and Choklat, but it's no slouch. If you liked any of the others, this will be sure to please. Like most of their offerings, it continues to reveal new things up to the end of the bomber.

There is also a lingering, moderate bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is perfect for an imperial stout, or any other stout for that matter. It is full bodied with a silky texture, and appropriately low carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice beer.

The taste follows the smell but a great bitter aftertaste from the burnt characteristics. Dark brown sugar is heavily apparent. The beer has a full body and is very silky.

Light dried fruit flavor and earthy hop bite. Thick viscous body with a sweet roasty syrupy mouthfeel and a light level of carbonation. This one seems to do really well with a bit of age on it.

The taste truly earns the "imperial" title - massive bittersweet chocolate (more sweet than bitter), some coffee, oats and lightly roasted barley, with some definite hop spice and slight hop bitterness. The real genious here is the melding of the deftness and relative lightness that is characteristic of an oatmeal stout with the largess of flavor (though not the complexity, it must be noted) of an imperial stout. The mouthfeel is absolutely spectacular - thick and chewy, with nice warming action. As to drinkability, between the ABV, the richness, and the sweetness, good luck trying to knock down more than one of these.","trpng0bily","Oct 07, 2008"

A friend detected sunflower seeds, and I get way too much orange peel. On the other hand, appearance (a perfect pour will do that) and mouthfeel are a little improved, so I think it's a wash.

Maybe the economy has something to do with that also I suppose. That said, it took me a while to drink it and I enjoyed every sip. I wouldn't mind cellaring one to see if the sweetness curbs a bit, but it's great fresh.

Quarter inch, tan-colored head dissipated into a mere swirl with a tiny band of foam and bubbles around the edges of the glass. Some lacing but no legs. Nose is malt, molasses and a touch of alcohol. Extremely flavorful - chocolate malt, molasses, brown sugar, oats and a light hops bittering to round out the finish. Mouthfeel is medium and chewy without being overly viscous (viscosity is cut by a light carbonation in the background). Definitely a little bit of alcohol heat on this one.

4.52,10.2,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"After having been impressed by this brew so much last year, there was no hesitation on my part to buy a bomber when I saw it on the shelf at Martys in Newton. I poured this one in to my Portsmouth tulip glass at a temperature perhaps slightly lower than cellar. Little in the way of heading, but a small white/tan ring could be seen forming around the glass. Color cannot be stated enough; this truly is black water that light will not penetrate. Burnt coffee bean is the first smell that shows itself, followed by earthy grains, oatmeal, and a bit of lactose sweetness. Taste starts off with a mix of chocolate and oatmeal, stays earthy throughout, and ends on a more bitter coffee note. Feel is robust, yet manages to slay slick on the palate. This one truly qualifies as a meal in a bottle. Try sharing this one with a friend, as the alcohol and overall weight of this beer might be a bit too much for single handedly polishing off a bomber. This beer is my favorite from Southern Tier, and one of my favorites throughout the year. Imagine a beer milk shake, and you might get an idea as to what this one resembles. Despite the steep price tag, Oat might have to be a brew that I cave in, and purchase a case of. Cheers to the guys at ST for creating such a great beer.","jamie2dope","Sep 05, 2008"

The feel is well bodied, with soft/velvty carbonation and finishes extremely smooth and bitter sweet. Though very silky it is also a bit slick and sticky.

Alchol is noticeable but much like a cordial. It is really smooth as a Imperial but it still retains the qualities of an oatmeal stout. The waves of chocolate keep coming with a ton of malted chocolate oats. Almost like drinking a warm chocolate malt. This really is quite tasty, I think I like it more than Chokolat.

Taste is a lot of the same. It tastes like black, whatever that means. Basically like dark dark chocolate, espresso, molasses and a little bit of dried fig or prune flavors. The beer is very sweet, but there is a noticeable bitterness in the background. I would have preferred it to be a bit less sweet, it was bordering on cloying. Mouthfeel was viscous.

From notes. goddamn I have about 3,000 beer review notes I've yet to transcribe to this site, and as I'm in a writing mood I figured that I would get started on rectifying that situation. Anyway, this one is an inky, heavy black with not much carbonation. There is a small espresso head though and it can be revived with a swirl of the riedel. Dark roasty and sweet malts intersperse with a nice raw green hop aroma. Roasty chocolate, espresso, raisins, and more abound in the aroma and the actual taste is better still with just a hint of warming alcohol in the background. The roast notes are really nice and filled with an unusual level of depth.

The initial smell is of alcohol, followed by sweet malt, an underlying bitterness, and perhaps a bit of light roastiness as well. The taste is a little hot as well, also quite bitter, a tad undercarbonated. But there are very good flavors of coffee, molasses, and a roasted graininess. The mouthfeel is smooth and sweet. This beer didn't blow me away. I really think it needs more time in the bottle to mellow and integrate flavors a bit more and to tame some of the sweetness. Not bad now, but probably could be better.","Georgiabeer","Jan 25, 2008"

The alcohol level is not as well hidden as in some brews, but it is well moderated. The heavy body is quite appropriate for the style, but its at the sipper end of the scale, far from anything that could be sessioned.

Dark-chocolate-dipped blackberry aromas with a slightly menacing undercurrent of alcohol vapor. The oil-slick texture carries a cacophony of juicy dark fruit flavors: black cherries, burnt currants, earthy and coniferous hop spice, charred grain, and silky booze. The latter is deftly hidden amongst the wall of flavor this stout presents, but its warming effect is nearly immediately noticeable both in the stomach and in the cheeks. A sipper for certain. A solid effort, but less than awesome all the same.","orfeu","Dec 17, 2007"

Aromas are carried by a strong alcohol presence. Lots of earthy, rich and deep notes come through, mostly chocolate, cream soda, vanilla, a little light oak, and a bunch of milled oatmeal. It's really nothing like any RIS I've had as I would compare it to; not as roasty or chocolaty, but still with some slight port like notes. On the palate, this beer explodes! Minimal carbonation fills your mouth with a heavy slickness of chocolate, oatmeal, some slight lactose like notes. It is incredible smooth as the high percentage of oats would do and the finish is very long, very smooth with some slight roasty bitterness. A little bit of an herbal touch is felt from the hops, columbus bringing citrus and willamette a little floral. Overall, this is an overwhelmingly good beer and I'm scared to rate it so high.

Mouthfeel is very thick and viscous, low carbonation, very sweet. At first I had this rated pretty highly, but the more I drank the more I disliked it.

Taste is straight forward and sweet, hershey's syrup and coffee liquor, with a slight burnt bitterness. Boozy/vinous aftertaste. Mouthfeel is on the thin side of syrup, low carbonation, silky.

The mouthfeel is velvety and smooth. Body is medium or so. Could use a little boost. But it lends to a lot easier beer to drink, which could be dangerous with this one. Very lightly carbonated. The taste is full of dark oils....anise, tar, black licorice, tobacco and char. It's really quite a nicely integrated flavor profile.

Sticky brown lacing. Smells boozy and of chocolate and thick malts. Notes of charcoal, coffee and the other usual suspects. Tase is huge. Oaky thickness with a large coffee presence that's bitter, but in a way that doesn't make you think "why am i sucking on some old wet coffee grounds?", as some beers tend to do. No, its an obvious hop bitterness that melds well with the rest of the beer and that I imagine would fade as you aged this. Some hints on the finish of oak, raspberry and plums. Tastes delicious. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous, like black olive oil. Chewy, almost, or like a melted milkshake. I think the mouthfeel makes this beer. This might be the first beer from S.T. that I've REALLY liked.

It has that vanilla cherry oak barrel treatment aroma and the onset reminds me somewhat of the sweetness of a dark chocolate / caramel / oat / coffee Cadbury Easter Egg. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is that classic smooth and syrupy American Double Stout with that widely sought after 'coating texture' only found with premium Double Stouts.

The aftertaste was as if I was just sipping on a fresh cup of coffee. The alcohol does kick in a bit after you swallow. Mouthful is very good. Not to syrupy, just right.

Some sweet oats in the nose as well, but not as much as I would like. Taste is a very dry wood like oat flavor. Super dark french roast coffee flavors mixed with a tiny hint of caramel. A bit of alcohol can be detected on the tongue, but not nearly as much as the smell would lead you to believe. Mouthfeel is not as full as I had anticipated, but still quite thick and chewy with a fair amount of carbonation.

A finger of solid milky tan head sits over top and there is a moderate carbonation working up the sides of my glass. I really like the compactness of the foam on this one. The aroma is solid ashy roast with a prevalent oat character with an undertone of solid pine and chocolate, with some fruity esters playing in there as well. It feels just a tad light to me, as I was expecting more force in the smell. The flavor is interesting. I get a strong pine hop and alcohol infusion that blends into a creamy oat that goes to a deep roast that gives ash impressions. It crescendos again with pine hop and a strong but pleasing bitterness. The flavor is bold, with a good bit of complexity. No flavor sticks around too long. I would like to see the alcohol flavors blend better, but I think some time will help that out. Mouthfeel is very thick and a bit slick. This one is distinctly drying to the sides of my tongue. Carbonation is very fine and bubbles are small. This is an enjoyable brew. The alcohol character seems to be settling in a bit as it warms. I think the pine hop is a little strong overall, but again, this would settle in as it ages. I think this one will only get better with age.","kmpitz2","Sep 24, 2007"

The beer has a pretty good mouthfeel, though the sweetness and abv. are almost overpowering. This is a very good beer, but it's not really very drinkable.

Plenty of chocolate, and coffee like aromas up front, smokey roasted malt, oats, and maybe a bit of vanilla. A little bit of booze was noticeable in the nose as well. This beer was also an explosion of flavor. Tons of chocolate, coffee, roasted toasted malt, and a bit of hops in the background. Had a little bit of smoke and molasses in the finish. The eleven percent ABV was quite boozey and left a quick burn in the throat, but does fit in nicely in the beer. Mouthfeel was oily, thick and almost chewey. Pretty much how any big stout should be.
