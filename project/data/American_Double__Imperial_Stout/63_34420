I loved the way the pinot shines on the nose and is present in the flavor profile, but this beer is a bit woody and too charred for my preferences re. stouts. Nevertheless, I'd recommend that people pay attention to the best-after date: I had a bottle of this right after the 2013 came out, and it was just way too bitter too even drink. But the beer's improved a lot since then, and I can see this getting even better in another year.","blankenhoney","Tuesday at 06:51 PM"

So many flavors and an aroma to die for. I'd love to find another bottle of this. Deschutes Abyss is a legend and the 2014 is the best they've ever created.

Had a shitty day, and stopped by a gas station of all places and found this, sitting there among bottles of malt liquor and trash. I have no idea why, but the price was $4. It looked good and I didn't know what it was so I thought it was some kind of gimmick. Malt liquor that is packaged like the good stuff. It was literally in the middle of the malt liquor rack. I bought one and spent the next 3 weekends buying 2 for each day, savoring the living shit out of this amazing beer. How is this $4? How? This weekend, the gas station was out, so I headed to a couple places and actually looked this up. Oh, limited time batch... find it at another place EIGHTEEN DOLLARS. I saved about $84 because of that gas station. No idea what the owner was thinking, but I sure as hell appreciate it.","Vladimir_Lootin","Mar 28, 2015"

4.04,-10.2,4.25,4,4,4.25,4,"2014 version. Pours black, getting a lot of molasses and roasts in the aroma, not much barrel at all. Same thing in the flavor. It's a good beer but for the price it really needs to have the bourbon barrel more assertive. I don't know maybe a year of age changes this thing totally. Still a great imperial stout but I do feel I have to knock it down a bit for being at least a portion barrel aged but not giving me any in the flavor or aroma.","PaulyB83","Feb 23, 2015"
4.57,1.6,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.75,"22oz bottle shared during #bottlecherwednesday at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach. Poured into a tulip. This beer is black, black, black - opaque and unyielding. A two-finger brown head forms before collapsing to a film and leaves patches of lace in the process. More lace rings are deposited on the glass during the session. The aroma is as advertised, but deliciously so - roasted malt, unsweetened chocolate, molasses, oak, anise, coffee, and barrel notes of vanilla and bourbon. Taste opens up with roasted malt sweetness, molasses, coffee, anise, and vanilla. Some bitterness creeps through on the finish featuring oak, coffee grounds, a little citrus hop bite, keeping the surge of sweetness from washing out everything else. Only trace alcohol flavors come through, surprisingly. Quite full bodied, thick, creamy, silky slick texture, soft carbonation, drying and warming on the finish. Delicious.","SierraFlight","Feb 22, 2015"

Smell has a slightly woody aroma with loads of charred malt, licorice, and hints of Star anise, cocoa and coffee. Taste follows the nose with loads of charred malt forward with a somewhat harsh bitterness intensified by a dry oaky almost tannic mid section. More oak, hints of vanilla, coaco, coffee and a dominating inteste bitterness in the finish. Medium to heavy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation and a dry bitter finish. Nice complexity but it could definitely use some time to balance out.","Fcolle2","Feb 21, 2015"

4.98,10.7,5,5,5,4.75,5,"To get more in depth - there is a ton of ashy malt flavor in there, but the various barrels, even the 6% bourbon barrels, play their own parts in influencing the overall flavor. The cherry and the red wine are the stars here, putting their own spin on the semi-sweet chocolate notes of the exceptionally dark malt backbone, but the bourbon is still detectable, and for someone who has grown a bit weary of bourbon barrel beers, not only is the bourbon character perfect, but it is still there while being, wonderfully, a background nuance to the other amazing qualities in this beer. I actually can't perceive any flavor additions from the licorice or molasses or vanilla, but honestly that's fine with me. Vanilla can get a little played out in stouts, and licorice is not really my thing. Molasses can have the tendency to dry out a brew more than flavor it, and maybe it's simply cutting into the sweetness overall, which is fine. Having some subtle cherry and wine notes in a super-rich, dark-chocolate, ashy malt menagerie is plenty complex for my palate, and holy crap was this a treat. As close to a perfect beer as I've ever experienced. Just off-the-charts wonderful. The only beer I've had that could hold a candle to this is Founders Imperial Stout, and soon we'll see which I actually prefer.","BradenMK","Jan 20, 2015"

You can save yourself some time and have a better experience by pouring a shot of bourbon and a splash of ouzo into a bottle of Dr. Pepper.

Pours a typical stout-black with less than a finger of cappuccino-brown head that persists and leaves some tracing.  The smell is totally unique, combining licorice and black cherry with dark roasted malt and red wine.   The taste is similar to the aroma, but with additional layers of complexity - dark roasty malt, black cherry, big-chewy red wine, licorice, molasses - an incredible array of complimentary flavors.  The mouth feel is just about perfect - thick and oily, but not as thick and sweet as some of the big stouts out there, adequate carbonation - definitely a sipper, but not cloying.  Overall, this is a wonderfully complex stout, almost on par with a fine wine.","FFreak","Jan 05, 2015"

I really think my score on taste will only be higher when I drink my next bottle a year from now. It cant really get worse I think.

I really didn’t know what to expect and was presently surprised. It is unlike any other barrel aged stout I’ve had; not at all similar to something like BCBS. Rather, the additives and, perhaps more importantly, the wine barrel a great fruitiness to counter the dark, rich beer. Glad to finally have this and was not let down.","Tele","Dec 05, 2014"

It has great complexity, with dark fruit, coffee, cocoa, anise, wood, whiskey, and leather notes.  But, it does not hit you over the head.  There is a subtlety to the flavors as they develop.  You notice the heavier flavors at first.  Then wait a bit and you notice some of the smooth, sweetness and even a hint of hops.  Thich, rich and winy, with low carbonation and a long finish.  Well-balanced.  This is a big beer, but also thoroughly drinkable.  I really have to get my hands on some of the prior years.","PacNWDad","Dec 04, 2014"

Color on this bad boy was a pitch black abyss with a a brown head that receded slowly. It was as expected a big, full bodied beer that was thick and creamy. On the palate I got a lot of the same stuff as the nose, the black licorice and chocolate were the big ones, but also those dark fruits, vanilla, and a little bourbon as it warmed. This is a phenomenal beer, but I personally don't think five years on it was really necessary, a couple would probably have sufficed, and I say that having had it aged to various degrees in the past. Regardless of my opinion on that this is still something to pick up and drink fresh, or experiment with aging to your liking. All in all I can't wait to have my next Abyss.","BrewChatKen","Oct 28, 2014"

4.77,6,5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,"I recognize that the big (ie., ageable) great beers should be great fresh, and then potentially become even greater (or at least great in different ways) over time--until some inevitable point of decline years down the road.  The Abyss, I think, is an exception to this rule.  It is good fresh, even very good, but not great: an intricate combination of flavor that has not quite come together into a cohesive whole.  Give it time.  It needn't be a year (though maybe that or longer is best, if it's cellared properly), but at least a few months.  The stronger elements in this brew (maybe for your palate it's the wine barrels, or the cherry bark, or the roastiness, or...) could be too harsh right out of the gate; but eventually they will all soften and meld, and yield a sipping beer of exceptional subtlety and complexity.  Those who are pining for a 100% barrel aged version of this are, I think, maybe missing the point.  There are plenty of beers like that.  Deschutes's fractional approach to aging, and aging in a few different kinds of barrels, are precisely what make this beer so very special.","Nietzsches_Horse","Oct 05, 2014"

Initially was overpoweringly strong almost off putting the medicinal alcohol over shadowing even the heavy malt flavors. Around 2010 it came into its own. Mellowed out and smoothed out the finish to silk. Sampled one or two every year after and it just gets better and better. Down side, there is only one left. Ok, I should have put down 2 cases. However there is still the 2009 and 2010. Will there be more? Oh please! A masterful brew. Will it return soon… Oh please!!","grat","Sep 30, 2014"

The rather hot nature of the beer is something I've noticed in Deschutes' big beers early on in their lifetime. Flavor is good but unclear and heavily balanced toward the roasted malts. I will have to age the next one for longer. Overall it was still a good compliment to Jackie Brown as it would be for The Abyss, of course.","Bfarr","Sep 17, 2014"

4.59,2,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Overall, one of my favorite barrel-aged stouts around. The use of multiple types of barrels and the lower percentage of the overall blend allows the barrel characteristics to complement and accent rather than taking over the beer. And in this case, the additives work perfectly with the base stout and barrels to create a symphony of a beer--but this is no Mozart. While it's clear precision is at work here, the dark, overbearing stormy temperament to this beer is more akin to Mahler.","LambicPentameter","Aug 04, 2014"

My only gripe is that this beer isn't more widely available, because it is a champion amongst it's peers. Now my 5th go-around with this beer, and it sits easily in my top 5 beers of all-time.","TheSixthRing","Jul 30, 2014"

There was a strange 'briney' smell that burned a little. Don't know how to explain it. Capers? Also some tartness, cranberries, cherries maybe. Taste was huge and complex. Cherries, dark chocolate, molasses, oak in the back. Insanely pleasant aftertaste that lingered forever. Mouthfeel is something I'm still not adept at critiquing, it was lightly carbonated and pleasant. This is the single best beer I've ever had. That may change in the future, but I'm happy to have gotten to experience such an expertly aged beer that was meant for such.","CrossSideTop","Jul 10, 2014"

Like the special person of my heart and mind, this is strong, American, unapologetic, and duly faded to black. R.I.P., with much love.","biboergosum","Jul 06, 2014"

I should of cellared it for a while longer, but I just couldn't do it. It had great flavor but I didn't get too much of the barrel aged flavor which might come out a little more with the aging. I did have the flavors of the molasses and a touch of the vanilla. Overall this is a beer to try, I hope I can get my hands on another to age for a while to see how it rounds out.","jwerner23","May 24, 2014"

Complex nose; rich, dark chocolate, underlying roasted malt, toffee, charred oak, hints of red wine, dark fruit notes, just a faint touch of bourbon, and some pleasant booziness. The flavor is even more dense. Dark chocolate leads joined by plenty of dark fruit, most notably black cherries dominant, supported by raisins and prunes. Rich molasses with toffee join in along with caramel and dark chocolate notes. Oak and vanilla take the lead joined by some roastiness and anise. Finishes with some very light hints of red wine and warm booziness with a slight accent of bourbon. Big full body that means to be reckoned with. Moderate to low carbonation creamy, smooth, fairly velvety on the palate. The Abyss is truly a work of art and is among the top tier of both barrel-aged imperial stouts and blended barrel-aged brews.","chanokokoro","Apr 21, 2014"

Then when visiting San Francisco I came accross a great little bar called the Amsterdam Cafe that had in on tap. I couldn't believe it! I know that many times you build up your expectations for a beer and are usually let down. Not this time. The Abyss was amazing! The appearance was as dark as black ink with a thin foamy head. It smelled like coffee and chocolate and tasted like it smelled with a hint of vanilla. It had a couple more flavors that I couldn't quite recognize but it blended so well and tasted so great that I wasn't really paying close attention. The alcohol is extremely well hidden but definitely is felt when walking out of the bar. The mouthfeel is perfect with a thick, smooth feel that goes down easy. Overall, this was one of the best beers I've ever had and for the time being my number one beer drinking experience.","ELS","Apr 10, 2014"

The aroma is a great mix of oaky vanilla, cherry, caramel, coffee, dark chocolate and earth. The taste is more dark chocolate and coffee along with molasses and roasted malts. Nice notes of dark cherry, oak and vanilla throughout. Some boozey oak at the finish with more hints of cherry and earth as well a chocolate syrup. Velvety, slick mouthfeel with a moderate amount of carbonation. There is a lot going on with this beer. I would love to try one with some age on it but it's hard to imagine it any better than this.

The nose is a bit muted, but smells of cocoa powder. The mouthfeel is luscious, almost as thick and rich as chocolate milk. Cocoa dominates the palate, but there are also notes of oak and molasses. This is definitely a little less barrelly than some big BA stouts like BCBS and also a touch less boozy. Overall, a great beer. Seek it out.","jjdc","Feb 21, 2014"

4.5,0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours black with a centimeter of caramel-colored head fueled by a constant stream of bubbles from the base of the snifter. The aroma is of bourbon, chocolate, molasses, vanilla, caramelized brown sugar, caramel, oak, and roasted malts. May pick up some anise if consciously looking for it, but it’s subtle if there at all. It tastes of bourbon, chocolate, rich/roasty malt, sugar, oat, oak, vanilla, raw molasses, licorice, and a hint of smoke. Mouthfeel is wet and viscous up front with a velvety finish that is warmed by the ethanol. Overall, this is a complex and delicious stout that does a great job of balancing and showcasing a wide variety of flavors and ingredients.","eclipse54","Feb 11, 2014"

Smells smoothed out actually, no booziness at all. Similar and very complex nose. And flavour is great- dark fruits, roast and dark malts, chocolate and coffee, a little licorice. Complex and not boozy at all. Medium bodied, creamy, not hard to drink at all. Very smooth and hides ABV well. I'm starting to think that while Abyss is good to drink years later, I suspect that with the decrease in % barrel-aged components, you might as well start drinking it fresh. Because fresh '13 vintage is the best I've had so far versus 1-year old '12 and 2-year old '11.","Stevedore","Jan 07, 2014"

In the nose, I get chocolate, coffee, vanilla, berries, stone fruits, and a punch of booze. Up front in the flavor there is loads of roasted malts and dark berries with a touch of tartness. Chocolate come out in the middle with coffee on towards the finish. Vanilla pokes its head out around the middle, but is not beating you over the head, like typical barrel aged stouts. I pick up some buttery toffee as well. Chocolate covered cherries linger on in the aftertaste. Delicious. Boozy touch in the finish, but not as prevalent as in the nose. Light acidity refreshes the palate. I'm glad I sat on this for a year. Mouthfeel is full, but not overly thick as the flavor profile would suggest. Mild carbonation. This is a fantastic stout, utilizing a blend of non-barrel aged stouts alongside different barrel aged expressions. An excellent example of blending skill over aging a stout 100% in cloyingly vanilla-forwarded bourbon barrels. Excellent.","goochpunch","Jan 05, 2014"

At colder temperatures, the roasted malt dominates every aspect of the experience. As the beer warms it mellows, but the alcohol heat accentuates some of the spice characteristics and this tends to overwhelm the beer. There are a lot of awesome flavors in here, but I think they do need some time to settle down.","McStagger","Dec 28, 2013"

Pours solid black with just about the darkest head I've seen. I think I could get drunk from the aroma alone: layers of rich, intoxicating chocolate, molasses, licorice and more barrel than expected. Faint coffee notes linger deep in the complex goodness. Wonderful flavors, but way hotter than expected. I guess that's what I get for cracking my 2013 vintage before its ""best after"" date. Rich chocolate, smoky malts, espresso, bourbon and I'm definitely picking up more of that licorice note I detected on the nose. Complex and nuanced, with some age this would be just about perfect. Mouthfeel is thick and wonderful but compromised somewhat by the alcohol bite. Very glad to have tried this.

Half a finger of tan head that dissipates rather quickly. The taste on this beer is quite fascinating. It seems like I am catching a new flavor every sip. Up front are some bittersweet dark chocolate notes and perhaps some dried fruit, cherries it seems like. Mid-palate has a surge of espresso and charred oak coming on heavily. The after taste is a bit dry and bitter, almost like I had a few coffee beans that were lightly toasted. The bourbon is very well hidden but you definitely get the charred barrel characteristics and a touch of vanilla. Quite simply one of the best stouts I have ever had, and significantly better than the 2012 Bourbon County I just tried recently. We'll see how it stacks up the Bourbon County Rare when I pop that open for my birthday. Highly recommended, I'll be getting another bottle!","blackcoyote13","Nov 12, 2013"

Scents of rubbing alcohol, slight roast malt, faint hints of black coffee, some vinous wine, brown sugar, molasses and slight licorice. Very nice aroma. Deep, complex and strong. Taste begins with black coffee, rich roast malt, bittersweet cocoa and vanilla bean, with notes of oak, licorice, very faint hints of wine and hints of oak and bourbon in the background, especially as the beer warms. Finish and aftertaste are bitter, roasty and strong in black coffee. Very well done, balanced, yet assertive, aged, yet not dank. An excellent flavor. Mouthfeel is medium-thick bodied, sticky with a faint alcohol burn. Quite nice, very much a sipping beer. Overall this is another excellent, deep, complex Imperial Stout.

I’ll buy one or two each year, usually on the trip back home for the holidays, but mainly I wait until I can get a fresh pour somewhere.

Pours a very dark brown, appearing black in the glass; a half finger brown head with good retention and lacing.. Rich aroma of dark toasted malt, vanilla, chocolate, hints of dark dried fruit, a bit of ethanol. Flavor of toasted, lightly charred malt and charred coffee, vanilla, oak, dark dried fruit and dark cherry, finishing with chocolate and more charred malt, coffee and wood. Nice heavy body, comparable to a quality oatmeal stout. One of the world's great stouts, complex and flavorful. This vintage seems to have more char flavor than earlier ones, but there is enough hear to support it well. The alcohol noticed in the aroma is well covered in the taste by the other flavors. One of the earliest beer I ever wrote a review for, but it was not up to BA standards, simply ""Ecstasy, best beer I've ever had."" I have had some wonderful beer since then, but that is still not a bad succinct summary.","LiquidAmber","Sep 12, 2013"

I've had it fresh and aged, several times. It always drinks well and has a good amount of flavors but I always feel like it lacks something. As I said it's solid, but it never blows me away.","Ahappyhiker2","May 20, 2013"

This may be the most complex of the big stouts I've had. There is so much going on, it's a wonder it works at all. I think the partial wine barrel aging is what brings this to that next level. With that said, this isn't my favorite. I prefer a more simple, straight bourbon aged stout. This also finishes a bit too bitter for me and the mouthfeel is a little light. This is a great beer though, and one that I will always buy a couple of every year. Worth the hype. Cheers!","Humulus85","May 03, 2013"

A phenomenal nose as always, with dusty oak notes, dark fruits, and chocolate syrup, but the flavor falls flat as a one dimensional cocoa forward imperial stout with a woody finish and not much else. Soy saucy at first, but mellows out a bit more over time. Still underwhelming - I wish I could have tried this vintage at its best. 3.75.","magictacosinus","Apr 21, 2013"

Not a lot of bourbon, but enough of it to add to the experience and not overwhelm the experience.","SHerninko","Mar 15, 2013"

5,11.1,5,5,5,5,5,"22 oz bottle 2012. Pours solid blackish brown with a healthy espresso head. The aroma is top notch coming strongly from the tulip glass. Big coffee notes with vanilla, tart fruit, black licorice and subtle traces of bourbony goodness. The taste is complex with coffee, chocolate mousse, and sweet rock candy up front followed by oaky vanilla, graham cracker and a little heat from the bourbon. There’s beautiful bubbly lacing hanging about the glass. The palate offers a slightly syrupy texture with a good bit of carbonation to balance it. Awesome Imperial Stout!","flydudehsv","Mar 14, 2013"

5,11.1,5,5,5,5,5,"Pours opaque black with a billowy tan head. The nose is coffee, chocolate liqueur, licorice, vanilla, chestnut, and bourbon. The flavor is almost as complex as the aroma with the bourbon, and Merlot being more muted than I expected, but not in a ""they’re almost undetectable"" sort of way. Rather, those flavors serve as underpinnings (in an almost catalyst-likemanner) that bring out the intensity of the more obvious esters like bitter chocolate, roast coffee, vanilla, licorice, toffee, chestnut, salt, and almost a smoky bacon quality. At first I thought the body was a tad thin to support such a dynamic flavor profile, but then I realized that if it were thicker, it would make the flavor almost too mouth coating and intense to be as drinkable as it is. I agree with the other reviewers who think this beer will be an aging marvel, but for me it is already an absolutely ideal imperial stout, which I find even more rounded and complex than Speedway, and even more remarkable for achieving its decidedly coffeeish flavor component without the actual addition of that ingredient. The finish is incredibly long, and the balance is wondrous for such a big brew. Wow!","Impfan","Mar 03, 2013"

Definitely living up to its name, the beer was black and quite opaque and a very dark brown head. It smelled like dark chocolate with a bit of coffee and nuts. Incredibly thick and the most velvety smooth beer I've ever had out of a bottle. I could taste alcohol, but just barely. Nicely carbonated. I think the aging mellowed it, as I had it again on tap this year and the carbonation and roasted flavors were much more intense and biting. It deserves to be aged.","falc0n2600","Feb 25, 2013"

I have to admit this review is a bit bias, I am somewhat new to the game of aging beers (abt 2 years) I have tried some hyped beers and I am cellaring others, other than a 2009 Stone IRS which I just opened this past christmas, this is the first hyped beer that I've had that has been aged properly, about 15 months. Pours a dense black, i've seen worse reading some of the ratings i've read, with a very thin lacing. On the nose you pick up different notes each sniff, caramel, coffee, oak, toffee, chocolate, licorice. I take my first sip and i'm done. This is one of the most smooth, complex imperial stouts i have ever tasted. I am not worthy, one of the best beers I've ever had, going to drink the rest of this in peace.

The nose is dark and roasty mocha initially and opens up nicely with big vinous notes and hints of licorice, black cherries, booze, vanilla and coffee. The taste is just as bold and complex with lots of wood and roasty dark chocolate along with hints of burnt coffee, molasses, licorice, oak, leather, black cherries, and vanilla. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a ton of vinous character and a great bitter warming booze burn on the finish. Overall, I really like how the wine barrel aging emerged and really gave it a unique character that makes it stand out from many of the other big barrel aged stouts.

Hangs around for a bit with lots of lacing. Aroma of chocolate, roasted grains, molasses, hints of black licorice, and dark fruits. Don’t get any bourbon or vanilla on the nose, but still smells very nice. Interesting flavor. Strong roasted flavor with seriously bittersweet chocolate. Alcohol warmth on the finish. I do get a bit of the barrel addition, but it is very subtle. Solid stout, but was hoping for a bit more vanilla/chocolate/molasses. Will have to grab another one to mature and see how that helps it.","BMMillsy","Jan 11, 2013"

The flavor washes in slowly: licorice, lots of molasses richness, and slight alcohol burn to remind me of what I'm drinking. Some bakers chocolate and slight vanilla with a tinge of oak burn.

Honestly, I am not getting too much of the barrels in this, but that's okay, still delicious. A fuller, creamy mouthfeel. Some alcohol is noticeable in the finish, which is to be expected from such a high ABV and ""fresh"" beer. Overall, a wonderful, wonderful beer.

Overall: This is a good stout but in my opinion since having the first bottle I've tried many more r.i.s. that are much better, cheaper and much, much easier to find. this one is not worth the price and effort it takes to hunt it down, if you can find one randomly sitting on a shelf for around 15 bucks or cheaper and you've never had it, I'd say go for it just to have the experience but I wouldn't run through hoops to get this one again, nor would I recommend doing so.","Beerlover","Nov 29, 2012"

I can definitely say that age greatly helps this beer. I had a taste of an 09 bottle recently and it was awesome. Fresh it's kind of all over the place, not bad by any means, but this beer really should be given some time to develop. I guess there's a reason the bottle says best after 11/1/03.

There’s so much going on in this beer, it’s hard to stay focused. The vanilla makes a showing, but it is fleeting at best.

We were looking high and low for the licorice throughout, but we were never able to pin it down in the nose, and only mildly on the back of the flavoring with black pepper and booze. Regardless, this is a dark, gritty, bold beer that everyone should try at least once.","TheBrewo","Aug 21, 2012"

Pours a dense coal-black with a thin, wispy, mocha head on top. The nose is rich and sweet with plenty of vanilla, oak, chocolate, charred toast. Really nice. With a beer this big, I like a bit of depth in the feel. This one delivers. Heavy full-mouth with ample carbonation to back it up. Rich, velvety feel with an easy finish. There's so much going on in this beer, it's hard to stay focused. The vanilla makes a showing, but it is fleeting at best. The sweetness instead comes from the semi-sweet chocolate and toffee character. With such a small percentage of this seeing the bourbon barrels, I'm not surprised that that is downplayed as well. Mild spiciness on the back end, and a slight tart kick to finish this one out. Fantastic beer. One I was glad to trade for, and one I will hunt down again.","Onenote81","Aug 01, 2012"

4.92,9.3,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"So,,, after having 2010 vintage about 8 months ago, I was able to obtain several more vintage bottles and most importantly, fresh 2012 bottles. I have to say that fresh bottle is quite good, but it's... kind of... all of the place. I taste more dark fruits but I get too much hops and booze. What I didn't get much of was the barrel characteristics - not much vanilla, oak, bourbon, etc. I recently had 2011 bottle and it tasted closer (but worse) to the 2010 bottles reviewed above. I will update this review again after I open 2007 and 2008 bottles as well as 2012 bottles years down the road. Fresh, I much (much) preferred 2012 Parabola over 2012 Abyss. Aged, 2010 Abyss was better than 2011 Parabola by a noticeable margin.","sukwonee","Mar 28, 2012"

Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark tan head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass; looks awesome. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, cherry, oak, light char, coffee, cocoa, molasses, caramel, toffee, vanilla, licorice, toast, and roasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with big complexity of dark malt, oak, and barrel character; and extremely balanced. Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, molasses, light char, cherry, oak, toast, toffee, vanilla, cocoa, licorice, light smoke, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, molasses, light char, cocoa, oak, licorice, light smoke, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic depth and complexity of dark malt flavors with the barrel character and flavor additions; with a fantastic overall balance of all flavors; and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic blended imperial stout! Huge depth and complexity of flavors with incredible balance; and very smooth to sip on. An extremely enjoyable offering to sip on slowly.","superspak","Feb 19, 2012"

4.79,6.4,5,4.75,4.75,5,4.75,"In a growler from Chuck’s 85th Market, 2011 vintage. Pours a nice head. Two finger, tan head. Completely black. Aroma was so inviting. Chocolate, strong coffee, vanilla, so much going on, this was amazing. Taste is incredible. Chocolate, coffee, vanilla, molasses, caramel...so many sweet flavors and yet they still have the powerful flavors of a regular imperial stout. Says it is best aged, and it does get better, but it's also drinkable fresh. Mouthfeel goes down so easy, still very carbonated, but I can tell that this becomes better with age. Very viscous, and lingers well. This is incredibly drinkable. This is still easily in my top 3 of all time. Delicious, drinkable (and completely masking an 11 percent), and the favorite style of beer on this sight. I know this is a Winter Seasonal, and hard to get, but this is an amazing beer.

4.25,-5.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured this one into my Brooklyn snifter and it is very deep in color and the head lingers for a good while. The nose is huge with toasted grains, dark chocolate and bit of burnt sugar. The tastes follows the nose but has a bit more of dark chocolate bite at the end. The sweetness is not over powering and seems to even out after the first sip washes over your tongue. I really enjoy the dryness on the aftertaste and at this point is pretty drinkable for the alc%. This is the 2011 version so it is still young but wanted to try now and again after the ""best after"" date.","lonestar4lunch","Jan 29, 2012"

So much going on in the nose I really can't pick everything. What I can pick up is roasted malts, cocoa, and alcohol. Taste is a roasty, almost charred, flavor up front with molasses with a smooth milk chocolate finish. Also some faint licorice and hop notes throughout. Definitely full bodied with a clean finish, somehow feels a bit thinner than it is. A great brew, glad I hung onto it as long as I did, but now I'm sad I only have one.","alli4051","Jan 28, 2012"

Thick dark black-brown ale with a nice brown head. A very complex empiromatic nose with some coffee, vanilla (oak), nice smokiness and balsamic vinegar. This ale is long, round and velvety. It's easy to find tobaco, coffee, smoke and a hop finale that taste like dust. The rostiness of the malt brings out good flavor.

The taste follows the nose with molasses up front, a nice balancing bitterness without any herbal hop flavors, and some extra black licorice in the background. I can't believe how well the booze is masked! This beer basically tastes like an old fashioned candy store tour; licorice, molasses, bitter chocolate, vanilla, and some stale coffee... no sugar or butter in sight : ) Sticky, thick, and somehow still dry without being astringent or burnt.

It was very brown almost black with a delcious looking and smelling short tan head that stuck around. It was malty, sweet, and just a bit hot; all in very good ways. Each sip was delicious and it wnet quite well with the sushi I had. Vanilla, chocolate and dark fruits were the predominant flavors along with a bit of Oak.

4.65,3.3,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"2013 Abyss sampled at the brewpub in the PDX pearl. Really like the 2013 fresh, as it tastes like Deschutes has dialed back the hops a bit, with the beer showing a bit more richness and creaminess on the palate. This still comes across as a big beer, but there are some attrative nuances of wine and dark fruits (not sour) that seemed to mingle well with the considerable dark chocolate, vanilla and coffee. I also don't seem to be picking up quite as much licorice this year, though it's still there (just more in the background). While I'm sure this beer will age well as always, it's also very attractive and sexy in it's youth as well (something that is not always the case with young Abyss).","John_M","Nov 26, 2011"

4.87,8.2,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"Poured from a 650 ml bottle into a snifter, best after date of 11/15/11. This pours a thick pitch black with an okay Mocha colored head which quickly dissipates. The smells are of dark roasted malts, espresso, dark chocolate and licorice with a tad alcohol heat. The feel is thick and creamy with a mouth coating bitterness. The taste is outstanding, loads of roasted malt bitterness along with the tastes associated with the smells above. Excellent beer I wish it was more available.","DavidST","Nov 03, 2011"

4.55,1.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Essentially black in color with a dark tan head that dissipated slowly. Amazing aroma full of coffee, molasses, vanilla, and bourbon. The flavor has many layers and I noticed different things as it warmed up. I tasted molasses, roasted malts, coffee, and dark chocolate. It’s heavy in body and lightly carbonated. It has a very creamy mouth feel and is incredibly smooth! It finishes with roasted malts and some alcohol that provides a nice warming touch. For an 11% ABV beer, the alcohol is very well hidden. It's incredibly drinkable now and I can only imagine how great it will taste in a year!","notsoprobeer","Sep 21, 2011"

4.62,2.7,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"O: it is amazing to me that so many strong flavor components are melded in a rich and complex beer without letting anything dominate - this beer takes on a bit of a chameleon -like character as a result as a different nuance peeks out with each sip.

3.35,-25.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,2,3.5,"It’s amazing how certain beers gain legendary status. Often times that beer is a Russian Imperial Stout. In this case, we have a great brewery brewing a legendary style. So, of course, if you are a fan of the brewery (and I am a fan of this brewery), you will be prone to give high marks. But, when compared to other RIS’s, the Abyss just doesn’t stand up. Certainly, it stands apart. It is unique for embracing the smoky side of dark malts and for giving us the ever-enduring anise licorice flavor, but the beer itself is just too thin. Where it gives smoke and licorice, it takes away fullness and chocolate richness. The Abyss is certainly a contender in the imperial stout throne room, but it is a minor god, if you are considering the great Olympians.","dnrobert24","Jul 24, 2011"

Strong, smoky aroma has tones of molasses, wood, bourbon, licorice and semi-sweet chocolate. It pours midnight-black with a thick and rather persistent fine-bubbled tan head that leaves substantial lacing. Flavor is beyond delicious - rich and smoky with tones of molasses, licorice, toffee, caramel, quality coffee, nuts and chocolate. It seems as though each sip is a little different. Thick, smooth flavor has a firm fizz that leaves a persistent tingle to go along with a smoky, nutty, mocha finish. This beer is worth a drive all the way to Oregon!","Cyberkedi","Jul 21, 2011"

Well balanced rich chocolate, molasses, vanilla and a hint of licorice and bourbon.

More sweet chocolate in the taste, followed by coffee bitterness, caramel, licorice and molasses, dark fruits. After a few sips, the booze starts to emerge, and there is a definite alcohol burn.

Then I get some oak flavors with vanilla and a tiny bit of black licorice. Not nearly as much coffee/espresso as I was expecting, which isn't a bad thing considering the amazing flavors and complexity to this beer. There is a little bit of hop bitterness throughout.

That being said, it's only a 3rd aged in those barrels so the oak wasn't too corky and there was a touch of bourbon that shined through just enough to tell you that it was different from the rest. I also get a dark truffle baker's chocolate roasted malt finish. It's like walking into a Starbucks and ordering off of their secret menu and sipping a chocolate full roast coffee blend with a nutty alcoholic backbone and a cocoa finish. You're sitting in the coffee shop sipping on a secret brew and only you know about it and only you can appreciate its bitter black licorice personality as it envelopes itself into an almost Charlie sheen like rebelliousness!! I really can't fathom how awesome this brew is going to be after I finish aging it. I don't expect you to either. I opened this one up prematurely because I'm impatient and need immediate gratification but I am already truly amazed by the absolute posterboy for a warlock stout that presented itself here... I can't wait to grab the next one out of my cellar in 8-10 months when this beer hits its sweet spot!

Smell was out of this world, an amalgam of various sweet and savory flavors that was almost overwhelming. I couldn't drink more than about 4oz of it and not sure i could ever finish a whole bottle.

It pours black with a half inch of of tan head that seemed to stick around for days... It looked fantastic in my stone IRS tulip. I couldn't wait to dive in to this glass of motor oil. The smell was as good as a stout gets. Oak, chocolate malts, vanilla, molasses, bourbon round off the initial whiff. The smells brown sugar and chocolate/vanilla stick around the longest. Love it! The taste is amazing all the smells shine through in the taste, the sweet yet awesomely bitter taste keeps me going back for more. The first third of the bottle has lots of oak and chocolate malts with a ton of sweet molasses on the finish. The bourbon flavor is a bit subdued and I'm sure that's bc it is only 33% aged in barrels. The beer is a bit rough on the edges and all I can think is how good it will be in 1,2 or even 3 years from now if I can wait that long to revisit it (have 2 more bottles). Overall it is a fantastic beer to drink now even though it is a bit young. I feel this could be one of my favorite beers if it ages to the potential I think it has.

The flavor is roasty, warming, fruity, warming alcohol, coffee, chocolate, lots of wood, molasses, light barrel aging, a sort of vinous quality. The palate is first cocoa which leads to roasted coffee and a sweetness that reminds you of molasses, some licorice, and finishes sweet as well. Slight vanilla and wood flavors mid palate.

Some nice islands of head floating around in this dark sea. Roasted coffee, licorice, sweet malt, light chocolate, alcohol are all present on the nose. A little bit of oaked bourbon but not overpowering in any way. Tastes very licorice-like, vanilla from the barrels, toasty roasty coffee, pretty bitter finish, but in a burnt way, rather than a hop way. Mouthfeel is perfect. Heavy. Creamy. Just perfect.

I think this needs another year to sit and to mellow out. Mouthfeel is thick and carbonated. Drinkability is misleading with this brew.

The result is that when you try a really incredible beer, like the Abyss, you have to remain objective. After several years of production (limited release) I have bottle conditioned (over a year) and have had it on draft. The quality is always perfect, never changing except on bottle conditioning, but that only improves the character, mouthfeel and taste. I rated this beer highly, because as my liver can attest, it has had some competition and remains a highlight of the cold winter months here year after year. The aroma is incredible, and the taste washes over your mouth, saturating it completely with dark molasses and oak. I love this beer.","Dansrc51","Jan 14, 2011"

Slightly creamy presence mid-palate makes this beer incredibly smooth and extremely quaffable. Slight bitterness up front is countered by the chocolate malt as well as the oak, bourbon and vanilla notes. The ABV is excellently masked making it dangerously drinkable. Also, the barrel aging adds to the complexity and balance of the beer and instead of it being a complete bourbon bomb it results in an incredibly complex, flavorful and well balanced, amazing beer.","corby112","Jan 12, 2011"

The flavor is in harmony between deep roasty flavors like chocolate, coffee, and toffee and popping flavors like anise, vanilla, oak and fruity and even some grapey tastes.

I thought that the 11% felt more like an 6 or 7% because of the abundant flavor hiding the alcohol. Nothing about this beer was too harsh yet it remained a full body Imperial stout.. in my opinion it was a perfected stout. I live in oregon and get to drink deschuttes beers all the time and none of them are this good. their porter is great but waiting all year for this beer is well worth it. in my town you can get it whenever you want on tap. Only thing i have to say about this beer that i didn't like was the 14 bucks it cost out of the bottle when i can get it on tap for 5.

4.26,-5.3,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I swear the lights dimmed as I poured this beer, its darkness is that intense. Three inches of rich caramel foam cap the beer, and while lacing is good, the head fades away a bit quickly. Aside from the requisite slab of dark chocolate, the only other flavor to shine through in the nose is a faint, but distinct spiciness. It almost reminds me of a less intense version of the recent Stone IRS 10th Anniversary Greg Koch blend. There's a bit more to this beer though, as my tasting notes have the various flavors at play as (in order of intensity) dark chocolate, espresso, spice, and licorice. I can only guess the spiciness is from the hops, and it's remarkable that there is this much presence left this late in the ballgame. I'm pleased to see that licorice is deployed as an ancillary flavor, as I'm not a big fan of it in heavy doses. The mouthfeel is spot on, incredibly rich body without becoming syrupy, thanks to the support of a subdued but effective level of carbonation. I'm thrilled my first bottle of Abyss was devoid of infection, and while I hope the same is true of my other '09, it's probably a good idea to stock up on some '10, becasuee this is a hell of a beer.","axeman9182","Dec 30, 2010"

There was not enough oak flavor for me. Some reviewers have said that they prefer this low oakiness to other over-oaked stouts, but for me it was too subtle, or perhaps just overpowered by the licorice, molasses and hop flavors. I wish it would have had more time in the barrel or a higher proportion of barrel aged beer in the blend.

Bodaciously huge chocolate nose, yet intertwined with mocha, vanilla, and molasses. The great thing about the taste is that I think I detected something different at each sip; very varied and complex, despite the fact that the dark chocolate flavor will bash you over the head. Bittersweet chocolate, Nestle Quik powder, anise, molasses, vanilla, and mocha/coffee, with a semi-dry coffee finish. Excellent flavor progression and balance.

Poured opaque black, so black that I swear the lights got dimmer when it was poured because it could suck all the light out of a room. Caramel colored two-finger light head that had good retention for a RIS. This looked like you would expect a RIS to look like, but with a little added darkness in body and wood color in the head from the barrels. Smelled largely of vanilla, currents, chocolate and coffee. Faint earthy aromas mixed with a little booze. Tasted even better than it smelled. All of the same flavors from the nose, mostly vanilla, coffee and chocolate. Brown sugar was now noticeable along with decent floral hops to make it just bitter enough. The wood/earthy flavors pulled through a bit stronger than before, too. Bourbon in the way back, enough to compliment but not overpower. Felt thick and rich, very creamy and viscous. Coating and filmy. Low carbonation rounds out the body. Drinks incredibly easy for 11% and, thankfully, not overly boozy like I thought fresh '09 BCBS was. Maybe the year it sat mellowed it out some, but this beer was delicious and drank very well, regardless. I wanted to drink another glass because it tasted so nice and balanced but I didn't order one because I had my fill with the bigger serving size.

The aroma is really great; deep moss covered earth, smoke, coffee, and some sweet molasses. The taste is top notch, really complex and yet so damn smooth. As with many great beers this changes a ton with warming; first, a bitter chocolate flavor with dark fruits, vanilla, brown sugar, and smoke. Later with warming the fruit and roasted malts come to fore, so damn good. A bourbon taste for sure, along with a really great creamy body. The ABV is strong at first, then nonexistent. Wow! All it was hyped to be. Re-rate: at the 2010 Imperial Stout tasting Sam crack open the vertical, 2006-2009! 2006 was sublime, dark fruit, oily and powerful. 2007 might have stolen the show, just amazing; rich fruits, plums and figs, oily can nastiness that I love. My faith in the Abyss is 100%. 2008 and 09 are great, but waiting to peak.

There is some alcohol in the taste, but not over the top for the strength. The slight cookie flavor is nice w/ slight astringent/bitter flavor from the highly roasted malts. I enjoyed this way more than the '09, a great Imperial Stout which is very solid and I am glad I got to re-review it.

It pours a bulletproof onyx topped by over a finger of tan foam. No over-fizzing, which bodes well. The nose comprises blackened pretzels, light charcoal, anise, brown sugar, leather, and tobacco. No real sour notes in my 'strils, which, again, bodes well. The taste holds notes of cocoa powder, dark chocolate wedges, bourbon, oak, leather, charcoal, blackened biscuits, and a very slight tart edge pricking the tongue in the back, the only real sign of what appears to be a minor infection. Boo. It doesn't really detract from the proceedings, thankfully, more like a stronger version of the famous Guinness sour. The body is on the lighter side of hefty, with a light moderate carbonation and a fizzily chewy feel (which confirms the minor infection). Overall, I was definitely underwhelmed with this. Sure, the infection could have influenced things, but it seemed much too minor to really affect the overall package too much. Beyond the tartness, it just wasn't as incredible a stout as many had led me to believe. Oh well, it was still much more than decent, and I'm glad I was able to try it.","TMoney2591","Sep 23, 2010"

I know that there is infection problems with this beer, but there doesn't seem to be very strong and the lengthy refrigeration time seems to have kept it at bay. The taste is mainly of mocha at the very onset, but the strong bourbon flavor takes over. The good part is the bourbon isn't astringent at all and goes down as a very smooth portion of the beer. Other components of the flavor include licorice, butterscotch, char, and smoked oak. In addition to all of that there is an odd tartness to the back with is ruining the outstanding flavor. I can only assume that it is because of the infection that is peeking out after being kept at bay in the cold temperatures. That really ruined the mouthfeel for me.

So, I'm drinking the 2009 vintage which my brother graciously poured into a tulip for me. Pours with a big three finger head atop a pitch black body. Lots of large bubbles in this tan head. Smell is a chocolatey nose with a very faint hint of barrel aging. Darks malts shadow a subtle sweet aroma of molasses. The smell is good, but I feel like I really have to take big whiffs to get anything out of it. Everything just seems a bit faint. So i'll go ahead and say it now. I don't think I have an infected bottle. This taste pretty nice. A big bitter espresso taste to this one. The flavors are on, but I feel like I'm not getting as much out of the taste as I did the nose. It finishes with an oaky bourbon taste and leaves me to scrape the roof of my mouth with my tongue. It reminds me of an amateur french press where coffee grinds are left in the last sip. The finish burns a little bit, but bourbon aging and eleven percent makes this not surprising. Not the best mouthfeel but the carbonation is very nice and this sips nicely in front of the Red Sox.","Bendurgin","Jul 24, 2010"

The flavor was of syrup, licorice, malt, and a slight tart taste (also due to infection). It was medium on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a nice beer even though it was infected.

True to the category, pure black liquid, nothing more to say. Punishingly thick nose of black licorice, dark chocolate, toffee, coconut oil, vanilla bean, plum, prune, black cherry, sweet tea leaves, those fake candy orange peel gel candies, overall the roast is tamed to allow perfect balance in your nostrils and reduce the ""flash"" factor. Full-bodied, but some sips come across as medium-bodied which is an achievement in itself, given the ""bigger and bigger"" mentality today. Espresso bean, dark chocolate, vanilla extract, caramel, maple syrup and coconut establish the oak presence, sweet while also toasty, covers the full territory from tongue saturation to inner mouth perfume. The licorice starts to come on along with orange reduction and floral musk. There's an underlying graininess as well as suggestion of cayenne.

A taste that I can put my finger that I have to describe as soy sauce. I appreciate that it has a subtle oakiness but doesn't taste like chewing on woodchips that have been soaked in bourbon like some barrel aged beers do. Lingering roasty bitterness in the finish. I like this 33% aging and mixing idea they used here, I think it makes for a complex beer that doesn't end up overpowered by the barrel flavors. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy with a lot of warmth. Its really not all that sweet compared to some other imp stouts, resulting in a high drinkability for me personally.","Shumista","May 30, 2010"

Although this would really be better after a year or so of cellaring. The beer was not super strong on the alcohol end. It is drinkable now, but I think it would be perfectly balanced in about two years. Hops came out a bit in the attack of the beer but were quickly covered up by the thick malty base of this beer. I won't write this one off to 100% beer-hype but there is a lot of talk about a good stout here, and that's just it. I think it needs to age to be a Great Stout.","DosBeerigos","May 11, 2010"

As it warms, notes of figs, licorice and pinot noir waft into the mix. The flavor is delightfully complex, folding in everything from the aroma but adding grace notes of bourbon and brandy and port, w star turns from the star anise and black strap molasses. Wow.

I will probably do unspeakable things to, for and probably with my Deschutes rep in order to get more than one keg but the jail time is most definitely something I can accept. Every nerve in your body tingles when you drink this beer. This beer reminds me of being a kid again. It reminds me of drinking chocolate milk while watching my favorite cartoon with my best friend bugs bunny and sitting in the middle of all my star wars and gi joe toys and basking in the glory of them bowing to me like I'm Gulliver or something. This beer reminds me of my best day ever. Anyways, this beer really is like a mocha chocolate milk. The coffee and malts are strong yet not overpowering.

This is one of the few reserve series that Deschutes puts out that you can really taste the heat. There's not a lot of residual sugar to mask the 11% ABV so despite its looks, it rolls through the mouth with a light body feel.

Tobacco not tasted since Adam from HOTD. As she warmed vanilla definitely became more strongly spoken as with the nice oak character. The oak is not overdone, and I like that only a third of the beer was oaked as it lends itself to a more mellow oak flavor. The bourbon is almost masked entirely by the oak and dark malts, even though I love bourbon, this beer tastes much more mellow than many other bourbon barrel aged beers I have had lately. So much so that the bourbon aspect is nearly unnoticeable. Sprecher Scotch Style bourbon barrel and Brooklyn Black Ops come to mind in this category.

Alcohol, bourbon, and oak comes through at the finish as well. The burnt and charred flavor at the start is really delectable, and that same quality is what makes the finish and aftertaste so appealing.

I was expecting a little bit of bourbon but got none. I did however get some warmth from the alcohol in the front of the mouth along with considerable gravity and sweetness. Overall its a good beer. Its not my favorite imperial stout but it is really good. Drinkability is good and mouthfeel is good too. I would be interested to see how this beer changes over time.","drabmuh","Jan 26, 2010"

4,-11.1,4,4,4,4,4,"2007 bottle thanks to CaptainCougar. Pitch black with a medium-small tan head. Sweet aroma with intense malt, caramel, burnt sugars, and roasted malt. Seems a little mellow, but at a couple years old, this was to be expected. The flavor is dryer than I expected with a roasty bite in the finish. Overall though, quite smooth with just a little more angular roast and a hint of alcohol towards the end. Rich all the way through with a light lingering sweetness. A touch of wood mostly adds to the dry feeling that I get, but bourbon is not at all evident, which I sort of like, but also doesn't seem to be adding anything positive. Medium-full in body with medium-low carbonation. Pretty nice stout, but not the most intense, good or bad. Mellow after a couple years, but still hanging on.

Still pleasant, but different. Taste is a touch more aggressive at first, but as the palate is coated, the impact lessens. A bigger bozzy kick on the tongue, guessing this needs a little more age.

Smelled of chocolate, small hints of black licorice, smoke, charcoal, caramel, vanilla, and hints of oaky bourbon. Taste was exceptional. Warm and thick on the tongue, lots of chocolate like the nose, smooth vanilla and roasted characters throughout. Some dark fruit flavors as well, could be the licorice. Mouthfeel was near perfect, I wished for just a touch more. For a beer of this strength it was ridiculously smooth although it could be the 2 years of age.

Oil slick black color with a lively coco colored head adorning the top. Thick gobs of lace hold fast while an everpresent halo of foamy bubbles stays around for the ride. The nose is very deep with flavor. Chocolate and vanilla whaft around a bit, as does a bourbon coated hop scent. Lots of aromas at work here. Taste is good, but subtle. Very gentle vanilla kisses the tongue alond with a thin chocolate coating. The hop bitterness lends a hand to help balance things out from all the sweetness, and combines with a coffee presence. I think the age has helped knock the alcohol burn down a lot to where it's hardly even noticeable. Moutfeel is tremendously smooth, but is a little lighter than i'd like it to be. I little more chewy with a touch of stickiness would be nice. A wonderful beer to be sure, but is it the best imperial stout out there? No, I thought Dark Lord was a cut above.","ryrust5301","Nov 25, 2009"

TASTE licorice, molasses, roasted grains, coffee, bitter chocolate, some malty sweetness underneath. Woody notes add complexity and roasty & hoppy bitterness rise briefly before the clean finish. Wicked smooth, complex and balanced. Something close to perfect. FEEL mild carbonation, luxurious rich texture with high viscosity. Full, smooth, long lingering pleasant sensation.

The taste starts out chocolatey but the alcohol quickly punches through in the finish. Some licorice but that's more in the aroma than the taste. Very complex flavor that probably changes with age.

And so it was that I opened this final bomber on 4/20/09 and shared it with my good friend John to celebrate all I once was and all I hope to someday be again. Into our glasses the brew was a used-motor-oil black color. The two-fingers of wood-brown head displayed excellent retention as a skim and collar that left sticky lacing throughout the sample. The aroma was complex, full of milk and dark chocolate, dry cocoa, roasted malt, dark fruit, alcohol and oak. Rich, sweet and very appealing. The flavors were also outstanding and highly complex. Starting with chocolate and toffee it then went into dark caramel, alcohol, sweet pipe tobacco, lots of oak and coffee. The balance between the sweet malty elements and the bitter hoppy notes was superb. As it warmed the chocolate continued to waft forth, encouraging us to dink more. The mouthfeel was creamy and smooth, the body full and the carbonation on-point for a RIS.

Pours a dark/opaque black, no light getting through this one, and a solid 3 finger tan head. The aroma is a little more subdued than I had anticipated. Certainly a delicious smelling brew, with aromas of roasted malt, chocolate, and espresso coming through, but not as strong as some other imperial stouts I have had. The oak is even more subdued, maybe I served this a tad warm? The taste, however, was not subdued at all, a lovely compilation of all the flavors I enjoy in a good strong stout. A strong, sweet chocolate flavor up front, pairs nicely with the coffee flavor. These flavors mellow as you sip it, possibly due to the earthy oak flavor. Not sure where it comes from, but a nice tart bitterness kick comes through on the back end, in addition to a bourbony warmth. I still feel this could age longer, as I love when these stouts get even thicker in the mouthfeel. There is certainly an alcohol warmth that follows a few sips. Its hard to establish drinkability on such a big stout, but within its category, this is a pleasing stout to drink, and I thoroughly enjoyed sipping on it over the course of the evening.

3.98,-11.6,4.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"One fine Saturday brunch found myself and an '08 Abyss in a gastronomical mood. So poaching a few local, free range eggs to accompany a Herve Mons camembert and sweet pepper relish on marble rye sandwich, I felt this was an ideal time to stare uninterrupted into the Abyss. Aggressively pouring the thick elixir into the St. Bernardus chalice...I like to wake up high gravity beers as much as possible...I notice the tremendous frothy carbonation that sits atop for almost the entire session. This really sets it apart from the other contenders in its class. It helps to lift taste from being just cloying and heavy. Aromatically, it fills the room. There is almost a mist that surrounds the glass of purely hedonistic levels of licorice, brown sugar, coffee, vanilla and chocolate. A slight amount of boozy heat, but nothing a few years asleep in the cellar wouldn't resolve. It amazing to think how five years or so ago that beers of these proportions did not exist. Lucky us! This is the part that I like best...one long, slow contemplative sip without distraction. This creation is full of point-counterpoints of sweet/bitter, heavy/light, not enough/too much. The licorice is slightly prominent. The anise in absinthe comes to mind. Dark Horizon, that delicious licorice bomb, comes to mind. I have had this and the '07 on many occasions before now, but this is the first time I have really appreciated this character. I have become so enamored with bourbon in beers that I almost feel like something is missing. Though I feel like this is complete. The good folks at Deschutes realized their ideal. I like it. I would like to have cases of it. Dark Lord it is not. There is a creamy, earthy nuttiness on the finish that I really enjoy, but becomes increasingly difficult to get past the licorice. The alcohol is more evident and that is to be expected. World class beer that needs some time.","Steamhead","Jun 25, 2009"

I have to constantly compose myself, keeping me from gulping and slurping. It is dangerously easy to pound. Flavors are great and so are the aromas. I am glad that you get some things in the aroma that you don't get in the taste and vice versa, but that shows this beer has more growing to do and has more hidden within. Leaves you optimistic to what this beer can offer with some time. That slight chemical smell is probably the only negative I can find, but I imagine with the alcohol fading, it too will with time.

3.76,-16.4,5,4,3.5,3,4,"This one is beautiful. It's pitch black and shiny, with a giant brown head, leaving great lacing and retention. The smell has a good bit of roasted sweetness, brown sugar, black patent, roasted barley. And there's even a note of spiciness with the alcohol. The taste is nice. There's a bit of sharpness initially from the alcohol and black malts. There's actually a funny sweetness mixed in with a bit of dryness. Buried down deep is a nice chocolatey flavor, with a deep brown sugar taste. I'd say this one could be overpowered by black patent if it weren't for the barrel-aging and licorice, and this is my main complaint with the flavor. I think there's too much to hide behind, which makes for an easier to accept beer, but I'm afraid of what lies behind. The mouthfeel is less than stellar for a BA beer. There's a bit of prickly carbonation, and it even tastes kind of thin, there's lots of flavor, but they aren't enrirely complete. There is a note of creaminess, once you work your way into it and the carbonation subsides. This one continued to pull me back in, though. I really enjoyed drinking it, and the recommendation goes without saying thanks to its spot in the top 100.","taylorhamrick","Feb 09, 2009"

The appearance is like nothing I've ever seen before. Someone before described it perfectly - khaki head. But, in addition to this, it looks like Turkish coffee, and like the Turkish libation, I'm conviced that if you drink enough of this, you'll see the future. The taste was unbelievable - chocolate, coffee, dates, and...nectar of the Gods, basically. Smell was your typical stout smell - molasses and coffee beans. Drinkability is down only because of the thickness and the abv, but the taste and appearance all make up for it.

It's beautifully dark brown from the bottle, almost black and completely opaque in the glass with a thin, dark chocolate head. The smell is roasty, smokey, with a definite molasses sweetness. There is no burnt taste--that's the one aspect of this style that I like least; so I'm happy that it is absent here. There is coffee and chocolate in both the nose and the palate. The flavor is sweet, but the mouthfeel is dry. Many brewers add candy sugar to try to achieve what this beer accomplishes, but it doesn't generally seem to work to me. There is no candy sweetness here; instead the sweetness seems to come from the molasses and natural grain sugar. Though the smell is a just bit hot, the alcohol is very well hidden in the taste--something I really like in a high alcohol beer. This beer is brewed with licorice and I notice it in the middle. The oak adds just a bit of spice to the finish. The malt profile is really full and constitutes the biggest part of the taste--the roasted malt is on point and really great. As for drinkability, I'm sharing this bomber with a life-long friend--we both wish we had (at least) another bottle. The friend I'm sharing the bottle with, says he thinks the bourbon barrel aging adds to the depth of the smokiness. I'm going to get another bottle (at least) tomorrow at Hi-Times.

As if the flavor explosion isn't enough for your mouth to handle, this beer's thickness makes a statement. gentle on the palate, and very warming. perfectly carbonated. extremely drinkable. The most I've had in a single night was two 22oz bottles and I felt like I was going to explode (although I ate a huge meal before that which probably didn't help). It's the kind of beer that you look at when you only have one drink left and think to yourself, ""I better savor this sip more than any other.""

Creamy, dense caramel-colored head, and the creaminess carries over into the first sip right through the last. The flavor is a perfect blend of all the qualities you want in an imperial stout (though most that try to blend these come up a little off): smokey chocolate, raisins, molasses, a faint though unmistakable vinous undercurrent, and some boozy oak. Just sweet enough up front, just dry enough on the finish, with a slight, pleasant alcohol burn. Reminiscent of Leinenkugel's Big Eddy RIS, though more intense, and with a better, dryer finish.

Roasted malt, graham cracker, and cream open up the taste, leading into chocolate, and oak in the finish. There is a lingering roasted malt bitterness in the aftertaste.

The beer drinks smoothly, with moderate carbonation that doesn't sting, and a oily finish that clings to the mouth. This is really a beer to have with a desert such as a cheese cake, or perhaps as a desert in its own right.

The first sip provides a lovely amount of chocolate with a syrup lightly drizzled over. It coats the mouth quite well and leaves me wanting more of it's creamy, but still chewy wonder. As it warms hints of bourbon, incredibly small hints mind you, come through. I could drink this for quite some time. It is definitely a sipper.

It smells of roasty/chocolate malt with coffee-ish notes. The flavor has similar characteristics, but with some dried, cocoa in there as well. It's not too sweet and is fairly balanced for the strength and style. The body isn't as heavy as I thought it might be considering the strength. Also, the barrel-aged character is well-hidden. More often than not, a barrel-aged beer tastes heavily of oak/bourbon/etc. Not so in this brew. It must be due to the fact (like the bottle says) that only 33% was aged in barrels. This is definitely the way I wish other brewers would incorporate their barrel aging. I liked this brew quite a lot so I can only imagine what other impy-stout-loving BA's might think of it.

It reminded me of the first time I drank a stout and felt amazed. The appearance is a blck dark beer with a dark brown sugar colored head. The smell was deceiving, but extremely malty. I say deceiving because it was served to me a bit too cold, so the aromas have not woke up. The taste is strong, strong and more strong. It is truely an experience in that it is strange how great it feels in your mouth. There is heat from the high alcohol, but balance of the malt, and very little bittering from hops, but none is needed. It is like a warm blanket that has been soaked in sugar and coffee is wrapped around your tongue. Is is necessary to say this is heavy?

The alcohol makes a small appearance in the belly upon the first sip but other than that it is not noticeable.

Starts out sweet with a bit of fruit character, then moves on to a rich maltiness, lots of toffee and chocolate. Roast and licorice added complexity, along with some vanilla and bourbon. Solid pine bitterness and flavour was more evident towards the end. Charred wood and burnt bitterness in the finish. Full bodied, but not heavy.

The beer poured out absolutely black in color as expected, and holy crap did it have a dark head. The color of the head was like chocolate syrup at first, and as it died down to foam, it revered back to khaki. The smell was roasted coffee, but it did not seem overdone. The roasted aroma was mild enough to allow some light hops to poke through. The much anticipated first sip was quite dry and the astringency made my cheeks pucker. As I adjusted to the graininess, chocolate, toffee, malted milk balls, vanilla beans, oak shavings, and black coffee made themselves known. This was a big, bruising, hefty stout, and needed to be approached with the respect it deserved. Not very easily approachable, unless you already know you want something like it.","rajendra82","Jun 12, 2008"

3.93,-12.7,4.5,4,4,5,3,"Decanted from the bottle into a snifter. Pours a very dark color with a one-finger head that sticks around for awhile. Aroma of chocolate, molasses, and plenty of alcohol. Taste is huge on coffee, with some chocolate, dark fruits, and alcohol underneath. As it warms I can definitely taste some vanilla from the oak. Mouthfeel is quite thick and creamy. Awesome. This is obviously a sipper, so drinkability isn't incredibly high. Overall, this is clearly a well made beer, but my personal preference lies outside of coffee centered RISs.","throwitallaway","Jun 12, 2008"

4.45,-1.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,"If you're a hophead, you'll probably like this Imperial Stout. There a big load of hops in this beer, which creates a bittersweet sensation between hops and cocoa. Smooth and not too heavy in the mouth. Sweet upfront, then spicy hops come in and knock down the palate. The alcohol almost gets lost in there. After the hop smackdown, it clears up and bring s in a rewarding aftertaste of brownie mix chocolate. Sweetens as warms. For what it is, it's pretty drinkable. I enjoyed this immediately after I got off work, as my workplace sits next door to the establishment I consumed this at.","DoubleJ","Jun 01, 2008"

4.7,4.4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours an opaque darkness with a huge foamy dark tan head that fades slowly, with sheets of lacing in its wake. The smell is really unique. At first i thought it was going to be overly roasted. Coffee, oats, chocolate, barrel aged vanilla and something that i couldn't put my finger on, until i peeked - and that would be the licorice. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied. As it warms the mouth reveals more and more of the 11% ABV...and that's a good thing!! The flavor is incredibly unique too. The best i can offer is that i get a wonderful rich oat-y anise and java thing that coats and lingers on and on. I'm pleasantly surprised that its far less roasted than i originally anticipated. This one is scoring huge points for imagination and creativity!!! Guaranteed not to disappoint. Highly recommended. Many, many thanks to Stoneman78 and largadeer!!!

However, I was a little let down with this being a top 10 beer.","jeonseh","May 27, 2008"
4.47,-0.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Thanks to blisscent for sharing this one. Served in a standard pint glass. Poured an opaque black with a mocha-colored head. Scents of chocolate, coffee, brewer's licorice and malt hit you in the face. Taste is consistent with nose, with the addition of vanilla and a subdued, balanced oakiness; just enough to enhance the flavors without dominating. Finish has a light hoppy character. Mouthfeel was silky without being viscous, and alcohol was well-hidden. The Abyss is by far one of the most drinkable RIS's I've had the opportunity to try. It goes down deceptively smooth and leaves you wanting for more.

The beer pours pitch black with very thick and viscous tan creamy head of 2 cm foams up easily and fades to an edge layer. Leaves windowpane lattice as it recedes. Aroma is molasses and roasted malt mixing with brown sugar and some faint grassy hops in the background. First sip reveals a fairly thick body with smooth text and mild rolling carbonation. Flavor is rich with roasted malt and brown sugar, molasses, but not a lot of oak. Beer gets a little boozy on the finish with some warmth and peppery bite.

Head is quickly morphed in a swirly skim or small bubbles, with moderate amounts of leggy lace. Aroma is deep rich dark malts, chocolate and coffee, with vinous fruit character over lurking alcohol wisps. Taste mirrors, with the hearty malt sweetness allowing some fruitiness to peek through in the middle, and then alcohol just eases into play at the close. Mouthfeel is creamy and almost evaporates off the tongue in the back of the mouth, and drinkability is only slowed down by the glimpses of acrid coffee in the aftertaste.

If you read the description on the bottom of the bottle, you will notice that it says ""Stout brewed with Licorice and Molasses with 33% aged in oak and oak bourbon barrels."" I get no oak from this beer. Although I am sure the oak contributed to the smooth character and mouthfeel, there is no character from the wood itself. I don;t get any bourbon or licorice.

Let me say right off that this beer is a good deal mellower than I expected from all the hype and reviews. I like it, but not as much as Kate, Ten Fidy, Bourbon County, Rasputins, and a number of others. Its a solid RIS, but its a bit overhyped. Pours inky black, but lacks a solid head and what is there isn't as powerfully dark as a Ten Fidy. In the aroma, you can certainly smell the molasses as well as some light coffee notes, some late chocolate, some fairly mellow licorice atouch of brandied dark fruit, and the slightest bit of vinous quality. It isn't as long as a Bourbon County nor as vinous and complex and fruity as Kate, and overall a bit lighter than expected, but still quite nice. The taste is also quite smooth. Not very vinous, but instead it leans toward the chocolatey with a bit of ash, more dark fruit, molasses and quite a bit of sweet licorice. Well integrated and quite delicious, but not quite as deeply flavored as Rasputins or Ten Fidy, and not quite as complex as Kate. Still, nice interplay of flavors. The mouthfeel is a bit on the viscous side, but surprisingly light in the mouth and not at all hot. As it warms a bit of bitter licorice on the end creeps in, but surprisingly, little roastiness beyond a deep char that is almost ashy. Drinks fairly well considering it doesn't blow the top of your head off like Bourbon County and is exceedingly smooth. Exceptionally good, but not the top of the heap.","Georgiabeer","Mar 15, 2008"

With first sip you get a rush of creamy chocolate icing like tones. The taste buds are flooded with sweet syrupy tones of esspresso, chocolate sauce, caco and toffee like malts. Twords the end of the palate you get a unique mixed balance of sweet zesty dark fruit skins and coffee bitterness which is rather dry.

Coffee grounds, chocolate, anise, and some oak come out as it warms up, along with a slight bourbon nose, but not as prominent as I was expecting. Tastes are of room temperature hot chocolate, with faint licorice, molasses, and oak mixing in from time to time, with a good coffee backbone and a bitter hop finish. Full bodied, smooth, and creamy with a good dry finish. Hides its alcohol content very well. A very unique brew, even amongst the other Russian Imperial Stouts. Though it's oak aged, the aging doesn't cover up the other flavors. I'm sure this will age nicely and could be even better down the road.","HopDerek","Feb 10, 2008"

If there was anything that could remind me Older Viscosity (one of the most amazing beers I've had recently), then this was it. Right from the first whiff you could tell this was one rich beer, chocolate, roasted barley, and coffee like flavors abound. The flavor was dark chocolate soaked in bourbon, though the bourbon doesn't give off too much of its own flavor, more just like a warmth to the overall taste. The mouthfeel was perfectly slick for this type of beer. Thick but not too viscous, it was able to go down pretty easily. A very rich but easy drinking high gravity beer.","MiScusi","Feb 06, 2008"

Mouthfeel is sublime, not too thin, but if anything I would like it to be slightly thicker. Drinkability is remarkably high for an impy stout. The 11% is nowhere to be found.

A thick and creamy head remains atop the Abyss throughout. This is how a beer should look. The smell on this one is damn powerful. Big chocolate and coffee up front with a sweet cherry, vanilla, and fig aroma as well. Lots of molasses and brown sugar with an unfortunate booze like smell that appears. The bourbon and oak are definitely there, but that's expected. Enough already, time to put this one down. Wow, first word that comes to mind after first sip is ""complex"" for sure. Wood smoked dark chocolate with a big french roast burst up front. The barrel aging of this beer truly shines. An almost Amaretto sweetness finds it's way out from underneath the big smokey flavor. Big oaky dry aftertaste with lingering dark fruites on the tongue. I really want this beer to be heavier, but it's still damn thick. Mild carbonation fits the style just right. I'll choose this over Dark Lord for sure, but it really is a toss up between The Abyss and Kate. Big thanks again goes out to lou91, unexpected treat for sure.

Aromas are good too, slight chocolate, coffee, roasetd malts. Nice. However the taste is fine up front, but this is too sweet in the middle and the chocolate/coffee/roast flavors just turn to acrid bitter cold brewed coffee in the sour finish. Also, the mouthfeel is thin for an imperial stout. The thin mouthfeel and bad sour coffee aftertaste of overburnt espresso beans really kills the drinkability for this one. Maybe a bad bottle? Maybe, but it was fresh from the most recent release in a wax dipped 22oz bomber, so it seems unlikely. Not good.","francisweizen","Nov 15, 2007"

Even when cooler it is still on the subtle side though, which is really what I want in a beer made with oak; add a bit more to the complexity without over doing it is the only way to go. The proof that this is a very well made stout is that despite the over the top roast character, there is very little harsh acidity contributed by all of the roasted grains. Definitely not the thickest and richest Imperial Stout out there, but still this is quite satiating and I really like how the various flavor components of this brew balance each other out. This is simply quite delicious; lots of sweet malt & fruit notes to stand up to the over the top roast character, plus a subtle backdrop of oak to kick the complexity up another notch.","Gueuzedude","Oct 23, 2007"

The taste was a bit like cherry or berry up front and then exploded into an amazing blend of chocolate/coffee/sour/oak tastes. Very complex.

Again the sweet sugariness from the malts is quite soft and subtle but lingers slightly longer than in the aroma. Sweet sugariness has some light chocolate flavor and is followed by some acidity from the roastiness creeping in and growing stronger towards the finish. This acidic roastiness blends with some decent hop bitterness. An almost nutty roastiness in the finish as well as a decent amount of alcohol.

This looks absolutely incredible, with an epic burnt-sugar brown head, all creamy and dense and going nowhere fast. Cool reverse-cascade effect during the pour. The liquid itself blocks out any light source put to it -- black-hole type darkness here. Smells meaty and vinous at first. Then a bit of roasty char emerges, along with black plums, coconut, vanilla, caramel, Bing cherries, extremely mild citrusy hop notes, and just a promise of black liquorice. An amazing aroma, but the taste is mind-bogglingly complex: Big roasted black malt flavors, with dark cherries, prunes, fresh plums, raisins, all awash in just a hint of bourbon. Some char flavor sneaks in during the middle, along with vanilla notes and whispers of German chocolate cake. Black roasted finish lasts forever, it seems, with sharp vinous blackberry flavors interspersed among the panoply of burnt deliciousness and puckery oaky tannins. Alcohol flavor is noticeable, but melds expertly with bourbon accents. Slick, luxuriously silky mouthfeel. Not too heavy, but substantial all the same. The folks at Deschutes knew exactly how long to age this one before letting it out of the gate. This is something I could easily drink all night, every night if I could. Really, I couldn't ask for anything more in a Russian Imperial Stout. As close to perfection as I can imagine. I was lucky enough to get my order in to Liquid Solutions in time before these all sold out, but I wish I would have ordered more than three. At least it will be available again some time in 2008.

Other than that, and a mild dusty, earthy, woody feel also in the aftertaste, the oak is reserved. Overall Its a hard beer not to like, but it isnt too hard not to love.","Jredner","Feb 07, 2007"
4.5,0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D:An incredible elixir. A very complex and deep brew that balances each flavor perfectly. The high ABV limits the amount per serving but the beer is delicious. I can't help but wonder what a year of aging would do for this brew. Highly recommended!","Tyrawlings","Feb 06, 2007"

4.37,-2.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Drinks okay, but alcohol burn & heft also make this a nightcap or fire side sipper. This one would pair well with some hunks of red meat & or chocolate. This a keeper for deschutes, more next year please!","russpowell","Jan 30, 2007"

3.67,-18.4,4.5,5,3,4,3,"This beer is devastatingly complex with rich tones and more subtlety than a dark British comedy. Almost too much for my admittedly novice palate, however my aversion to licorice is profound and would not allow me to continue to drink this brew. Regardless, this is one of the better brews I have tasted in terms of brewing prowess and depth, so if you like or can handle the licorice flavor I suggest it highly.","Andbrew","Jan 29, 2007"

4.65,3.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"D: The ultimate sipper and a wonderfully crafted beer. Rich deep character & fine balance - definitely in the top echelon I've beers I've enjoyed. I recently had a pint on-tap at Concordia Ale House and found the tastes to be similar, though the chocolate/coffee character seemed more prevalent in the kegged version, while the tannic oak barrel/vanilla qualities were more forward in the bottled version. Either way, this beer comes very highly recommended - thanks to Deschutes for brewing this fine stout!","msubulldog25","Jan 14, 2007"

4.76,5.8,5,4,5,5,5,"Mouth is rightfully creamy and full. I could drink a ton of this and would do so before ANY other barrel aged stout. No other barrel aged stout comes close. I'm sure a year from now once people catch on I'll get many requests for it. That seems to be the case with most Northwest brews!","TheBungyo","Jan 05, 2007"
4.65,3.3,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The alcohol is very much in the background of flavors. The beer warms the belly less than I would expect for 11%.

4.55,1.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5," Pours as dark as a black steer's tuckus on a moonless prairie night. Inky black body is topped by a good finger of deep, dark brown head. A very pretty beer. Aroma is heavy on the roasted malt, with complex notes of coffee, licorice, dark chocolate, and a good whiff of alcohol. Palate is ridiculously rich. A ton of roasted dark and chocolate malt is tempered by a flash of an almost milk chocolate sweetness up front. The full bitter roasty character emerges mid-palate, along with the presence of some fairly sharp bittering hops. Finish is more roasted malt with a bit of licorice. The mouthfeel is simply perfect - rich, creamy, and luxurious, like a less-sweet version of a Dove chocolate bar. For such a strong beer, the alcohol is hidden extremely well. Damn, I'm a fan of this beer. I guess I need to grab a few more bottles before it disappears for good.","ElGordo","Jan 02, 2007"
4.63,2.9,5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"This beer is so rich, I don't think i can finish another one, but I'm going to try. I should probably try another Bell's Expedition Stout before saying this, but what the hell -- this is the best imperial stout I've ever had.","inflatablechair","Dec 31, 2006"

4.53,0.7,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Been checking my local store for last couple weeks and finally hit the right day for this beauty. As I popped the cap the first thing that hit me was roasted coffee, hadnt even started to pour and was just blasted by this great smell. Pour was jet black with a nice 1 inch satiny beige head. Damn it was dark, no light was passing through. Taste was coffee, toasted barley, hints of bourbon and vanilla, with a nice hop bitterness finish. Mouthfeel was thick as a milkshake, just coated my mouth and would linger till the next sip be it 5 seconds or 5 minutes later. Drinkability, this is one of the best stouts I have ever had. Its so rich and tasty that its a must try for any stout lover that can get their hands on some.","Iguana","Dec 24, 2006"
