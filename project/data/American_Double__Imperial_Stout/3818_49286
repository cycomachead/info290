4,-5,4,4,4,4,4,"This was strong in nearly every sense of the world and even though this booze wasn't a detraction here, a bit less of it and some more flavor would have made this outstanding. It reminded me  too much of the Southern Tier Choklat with a bit of the Oat thrown in for good measure. In a style crowded with a lot of big names, this one fell short because of this overlap but if you're looking for a dessert in a bottle, this would be a good a choice as nearly any!","JerzDevl2000","Thursday at 01:11 PM"

Smells of mainly chocolate (dark chocolate) especially, with hints of coffee and vanilla sugar. Tastes as wonderful as it smells, you instantly notice the chocolate on first mouthful, and as it sits the coffee comes out as well as the vanilla in the after taste. The mouth feel is thin and light for a stout, with moderate carbonation if any, perfect compliment to the taste in my opinion. Overall it is an exceptional stout and one that I'll definitely be  seeking out again!","anthony23cippy","Sep 13, 2014"

Deep black (jet), with cocoa lacing and very few bubbles. Strong chocolate aromas up front, a bit of plum and roasted malt in there as well. Definite Kahlua note on the front of the taste (good thing). Nice coffee presence, balanced bitterness, nothing too overpowering. Bit of a fakey taste to the chocolate notes (but again nothing overpowering, and maybe my imagination). Smooth and full-bodied in the mouth, lingered nicely on the palate. Overall a very delicious brew. Wife's review: ""Oooohhh I like this!"". Probably the best we are going to get out of her!","Mikus","Aug 20, 2014"

A mild bitterness at the finish and a slightly oily mouthfeel. There is a definite difference between this and choklat to me. Alcohol seems well masked.

I love a good challenge almost as much as I like a good beer. This is a very, very good beer. I will make sure to buy me some more of this one. Neither flavor overpowers the other and the alcohol content is not overwhelming, until you go to stand up. I look forward to sharing this with friends.","wollefdoogylloj","Jun 13, 2014"

Yes, this is one of the sweeter impy stouts I've had, but it is complimentary with the strength and depth of all of the other flavors mentioned above. If you like a sweeter stout filled with chocolate and coffee, then this is a must.

The coffee taste was a little weaker than I would have liked for a coffee and chocolate beer. I didn't notice any alcohol burn, and only when I finished the bottle and felt a buzz did I look at the label to find the %ABV. I was surprised to see 10%.

It's not a traditional imperial stout, it's not subtle, and it really is not nearly as complex as some would have you believe, but that's fine. The aromas and flavors integrate well, the beer feels substantial in the mouth, and for something this strong, it goes down easily enough.

Extremely pleasant and drinkable.","antott0523","May 06, 2014"

4.32,2.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 5/26/2011. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass with some alcohol legs. Aromas of huge milk chocolate, cocoa, fudge, toffee, cream, vanilla, roasted malt, caramel, light coffee, toast, and roasted earthiness. Fantastic complexity and balance of chocolate, dark/roasted malt, and light coffee notes; with great strength. Taste of big milk chocolate, cocoa, fudge, toffee, caramel, toast, vanilla, cream, coffee, roasted malt, and roasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, fudge, caramel, toast, toffee, vanilla, cream, coffee, and roasted malt on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of chocolate and dark/roasted malt flavors with moderate coffee presence; with big robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic chocolate/coffee imperial stout! Even with the significant age of it. All around awesome complexity, balance, and robustness of chocolate, dark/roasted malt, and light coffee flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 07, 2013"

The outstanding, nearly perfect Choklat just doesn't play well with the awesome kick ass existential entity that is Jah-va. (Get it.. Jah. Idk it's irie. Alcohol isn't Ital anyway). This is a great beer, but leaves something to be desired- specifically and glass of Choklat followed by a glass of Jahva. Not the two combined. Still, it puts on that bilateral buzz, coffee and booze, and I bet it would kill something like a blue Stilton.","hustlesworth","Mar 12, 2013"

Make no mistake - the taste is just as big and impressive as the abv suggests, but the supremely well-balanced flavours prevent it from becoming a sticky-sweet boozy mess (which is usually my main concern with these big stouts, and why I am rarely willing to shell out the bucks for them). A sinfully tasty 'extreme' beer that is well worth a try, and an ideal tipple for Christmas evening. Highly recommended.","thehyperduck","Dec 25, 2012"

A lot of booze taste. Not necessarily heavy for the alcohol content, but I have had smoother. But, then again, the flavor/aroma/mouthfeel would not be the same with less malt.

Be wary while drinking this, as it will disappear far too quickly, and the drinker may wonder where their beer went, or where they, themselves went. Because of this, sharing is highly encouraged; with a beer this good, your friends will owe you something very special indeed. It is a foolproof win-win for you, the purchaser.

4.45,5.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours deep, dark brown with a modest mocha head. Smells of chocolate and coffee with a strong alcohol component. This beer is big on flavor, with rich dark chocolate and gourmet coffee. The body is smooth and substantive, an excellent complement to the rich taste. The high ABV is respectably mellowed while the beer is still at its coldest (though still hardly invisible). As it warms, the alcohol becomes more strident--the only real flaw I can point out. Normally, I tend to enjoy dark beers more as they warm, but that's not the case here, as the alcohol becomes something of a distraction. The luxurious flavor profile, along with an eagerness to ""beat the heat", make this imperial stout way too easy to imbibe without conscience. Another winning stout from Southern Tier.","MaximalC","Jul 26, 2012"

It's not as a over-the-edge as the Creme Brulee, but I might enjoy this more on a scoop of vanilla ice cream than solo. Why? Well the beer is dominated by an almost cloying cocoa, with very minimal mocha notes. I wouldn't have guessed it's a coffee beer really (OK, it's a blend of Jahva and Choklat), many stout get more java flavor from their roasted malts. That said, it's makes for a tasty dessert beer with more balanced malts (against the chocolate, not the hops) than the Choklat. For my money, I'd just get the Jahva.","tempest","May 04, 2012"

Smells of chocolate and coffee, a beautiful mocha (no surprise) aroma that makes this seem like it would go great with some vanilla ice cream. Taste is a perfect combination of the two, and somehow the mixture of Jahva and Choklat manages to outperform both. Slightly syrupy on the mouthfeel like Hershey's syrup infused with earthy coffee, but not overly so. Sweet and good for dessert or a cold winter Friday night. Excellent.","BMMillsy","Apr 12, 2012"

4.27,1.4,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Depth is the strength of this beer. It doesn't offer much range of flavor, its really all about chocolate and coffee and nothing else, but those flavors are captured so brilliantly I couldn't hope for anything else. The other thing that impresses me is the lack of bitterness. Imperial Chocolate Coffee Stouts tend to be rather bitter, sometimes to their detriment. Mokah is almost the opposite, if anything it may be a tad sweet. In any case, it is just the right beer for a cool Kansas City night next to the fire.

The head dissipated to a thin ring of lace that stuck around. The aroma is magnificent. At the forefront I get tons of semi-sweet chocolate followed by coffee. The taste mirrors the smell. A nice blend of chocolate and coffee, but the chocolate comes through more. Not as sweet as I anticipated. I was expecting a cloyingly sweet beer but am pleasantly surprised in how easy it is to drink this. Mouthfeel is good, but I was expecting a thicker body. Carbonation is perfect for the style. Overall, very delicious double. I cannot detect the 11.2% abv which is surprising. This is clearly a dessert beer, but not nearly as heavy as one might expect. Not overly complex as the only flavors are chocolate and coffee, but a decadent brew nonetheless.","hmf05","Nov 03, 2011"

The alcohol is almost undetectable despite its high percentage. Its so creamy that its almost remeniscent of chocolate milk when cold. Coffee flavor pushes its way through, but can't stand up to the creamy milk chocolate flavors. Definitely there though all the way through in a balancing way. Tastes like a mocha basically. Creamy mouthfeel is nearly dead on, finishing slightly drier, but still creamy and lightly bitter. Sweet, no doubt about it so if you don't typically like chocolatey beers, this one may not be for you. I think its an almost perfect dessert beer, and I definitely reccommend this. I am impressed.","chodinheaven","Sep 01, 2011"

At 11%, it's strong enough in both ABV and taste to warrant a second person being involved. Not so sure I could crush one of these on my own, and enjoy it as much at the end as in the beginning.

Everything everyone else said is true, dark appearance, very chocolaty upfront, and I like the sweet, coffee aftertaste as well. Up to this point I have been much more of a fan of wheat beers or lagers than stouts, but this stout is unique. The coffee flavor offsets any bitterness nicely, and the chocolate is strong enough to make it a beer you will want to go back to. This is something you definitely need to try, out of all the chocolate beers I have tried so far it is the most chocolaty, though that may change once I try the Chokolat. I am very excited to have a store in the area selling Southern Tier and looking forward to trying there other offerings as well, specifically the Chokolat and Creme Brulee.","CS1971","Jul 17, 2011"

The smell of this beer is a really good mix of Chocolate and Coffee. It's very sweet smelling and just by the aroma should be considered as a dessert beer or a night cap. The taste had a big amount of coffee upfront that fades into the dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is a thick and rich silky smooth brew that leaves you wanting more. Overall this brew is better than the Jav-ah in my opinion. Although both brew are pretty good all around.","Knapp85","May 31, 2011"

Smells of Cocoa Puffs cereal, Hershey's milk chocolate, and coffee hard candy. There is also some dark roasted malt smells. Taste is like an alcoholic milkshake made with Cocoa Puffs, Hershey's syrup, and coffee flavoring. Very rich and very sweet. Low carbonation level makes for a very smooth and very creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good stout with a very tasty chocolate and coffee mix. The best of the Southern Tier stouts I have had thus far. With that being said, this is extremely sweet almost to the point of being cloying. Definitely a beer that is made for sharing.","UCLABrewN84","May 20, 2011"

The aroma is of milk and dark chocolate, roasted malt, and a faint hint of chocolate. It is a very nice aroma, but if there were just a little more coffee it would be perfect. The taste is similar to the aroma, but with some strong heat in the finish. Again, I think it would be better if the coffee showed a bit more.

4.23,0.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Draft courtesy of Underground Bluz. Aroma was primarily of light coffee but also with dark fruits, some chocolate and alcohol. Pours black with mahogany highlights. A 2-finger creamy tan head coats the top. Lacing is thin and gets thinner as the beer sits. The taste is rich and dark-chocolate sweet. The sweetness is not that cloying kind of sweetness like sugar or honey. Bitterness is of the coffee variety and stays toward the front of the mouth rather than digging into the back. It's not a hoppy kind of bitterness. Medium creamy mouthfeel. The beer stays consistent as it warms. The alcohol is more noticeable in the nose than on the palate. I am normally quite attuned to too much alcohol burn in the beer. Primarily this is why I don't enjoy some imperial styles. But I did not find the same kind of burn in this beer. Very good.","chickenflea","Jun 24, 2010"

4.57,8.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"D - Big, sweet, thick and surprisingly well balanced considering the divergent points of the flavor compass that it hits. The aroma is somewhat subdued, with a subtle spicy chocolate note as its most prominent aspect. Nonetheless, while it may be a somewhat one dimensional aroma, being simply the aroma of chocolate, it is still enticing as it is the aroma of very good chocolate. The beer only really comes alive once it hits the tongue with a combination of rich, creamy chocolate and intriguingly spicy coffee that melds flawlessly. There is a lot of caramel in the background, which works nicely with the chocolate character and seems to highlight the chocolate's richness in particular. I an inclined to think that the national origin of the chocolate used in a beer would be of little consequence, but whether it is real or just a placebo effect, I can't help but think that the chocolate character in this beer has a smooth, buttery richness that I would normally associate with Belgian chocolates in particular. The coffee is quite interesting as well. I don't know if it is a varietal characteristic or something from the malt bill, but the coffee notes are unusually spicy and chicory like, which plays nicely off of the subtle pine hop character and acts as a contrast to the creamy thickness of the chocolate. I am usually of the opinion that chocolate and coffee are wasted in most stouts as they rarely achieve flavors that malt, if used skillfully, could not by itself, but this beer is a stunning exception. This is the best Southern Tier brew that I have tried thus far, and it is a unique and very well executed interpretation of the style.","nickfl","Jun 21, 2010"

In the bowl, though, it sits starkly opaque, a cool obsidian in color, with a finger of foamy, light khaki head. Like ST's Creme Brulee, this pool of darkness gives off a scent most desserts would kill for. Luscious chocolate syrup tops a blonde vanilla cake, while an aromatic cup o' joe sitz steaming nearby, waiting to provide a pleasant bit o' liquid accompaniment to the baked goods at hand. Digging in, the coffee takes more of a lead, and it is evidently a darker roast than initially figured. The chocolate syrup has hardened into a brick of bitter dark chocolate, and it is clear that the cake is composed primarily of darker grains, malted and roasted. A small vein of vanilla still slices through, but quite thinly. Though not as alluring as the nose, I would order this tasty dessert every time I found myself at this particular eatery. Just as suspected, the body is thinner than usual, but only slightly so. This, coupled with a low-lying carbonation and a sweetly moderate coating of the mouth, makes for a rather drinkable sweet stout.","TMoney2591","Jun 13, 2010"

Taste: chocolate syrup, very lightly roasted, earthy hop finish, boozy in the finish. Mouthfeel: carbonation is a little low and the finish is a little sharp.

Far more coffee in the taste then the nose, and a little less chocolate than I would have expected. A bit of alcohol burns on the end of the drink, and there is light carbonation that lingers under the medium/heavy body.

Large amount of lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is more on the chocolate than on the coffee side. Dark chocolate is complimented by some cream. Smells almost like ice cream. Alcohol is also detected. The flavor is more chocolate than coffee. I would of preferred it the other way. It has a chocolate milk quality. Slightly sweet with just a hint of coffee. Alcohol heat also plays a large part in the finish. A little too hot. Not a huge body but it is substantial and slightly chewy. Coats the mouth well. Carbonation is low and has a nice texture.

Smell is nice, dominated by what smells like a few different types of chocolate, mostly strong and bitter types. The taste is quite good. Some roasted malts to add to the different chocolate type flavors. Doesn't taste too bitter, has a sweet flavor to it as well, would be the perfect dessert beer. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth. It's very thick, might be a little too sweet if you weren't expecting it. The drinkablility is very nice eventhough it's very thick.

This is like tasting a melted down bittersweet chocolate bar....but a good one. Like a Belgian one. That has been diluted a little bit so it's not like molten polymer in the mouth. The body is pretty full, but not like molten polymer. Which is good. There's a lingering bitterness that is agreeable. The bottle says its brewed with Jamaican roasted coffee, but I don't get a lot of coffee on the the buds. Slight roasted malt notes come and go.

As much as other Southern Tier's big beers might be gimmicks, I think this one is actually a very well-rounded double stout that I would consider drinking (somewhat) regularly.

There is something else sweet in there too, vanilla or caramel? Either way the smell is very sweet and nice. Taste is the same. From the name I was expecting more coffee upfront but it's almost all chocolate with a hint of coffee in there. Delicious to say the least.

These are not the kind of beers you find yourself populating your fridge with, whether its the Choklat (delicious, as an occasional treat), the Jahva (a little less delicious, as an occasional treat), the Mocha (see above), or, um, the Creme Brulee (ummmm ...). And at 11%, you can't really afford to, to be honest. That being said, yes, wonderful beer, slightly more ""originally"" authentic in its melding than either the Jahva or the Choklat singularly, but still a little on the ""faux"" side of the line, a little boozy, and a little decadent.

Pitch black pour with a deep toffee colored brown head, minimal scattered lace with the booze well hidden among the chocolate candy sweetness.

I'm glad I tried this, mouthfeel was thick and syrupy with moderated slow bubbling carbonation pretty much chewy in nature.

Smooth, creamy, slightly chewey although mostly a medium body, this is an easy to drink stout that is rather sweet with only a minor dry backbite for a rather clean, coffee-esque finish.

Where the Chokolat is more chocolatey, this beer gives more complexity and depth. An absolutely outstanding taste.

The bottle pours a deep, dark, ultra-brown color with a tiny ring of head. As far as appearances go, this looks more like a really dark brown ale than an imposing imperial stout. The aroma brings back memories of Choklat with its dominating, heavy, candybar, chocolate character. I don't detect the Jah-va in the aroma. The taste backs up the aroma. It's definitely sweet chocolate up front, and it then turns a bit drier in the finish. The change in the finish might be the Jah-va trying to come through, but it's hard to detect. The yummy chocolate flavor totally dominates in this brew. I'd like to say that the coffee flavor is a solid back-up to the chocolate, but it's very hard to find here. This doesn't surprise me since Choklat is probably the ""most-all-around chocolaty"" beer I've ever encountered, while Jah-va was only mildly coffee flavored. Do I like this beer? Yes...but, this beer is all about the Choklat portion of the blend, and it seems the Jah-va got lost somewhere along the way. It's too bad ST couldn't squeeze a stronger coffee character into this brew. Whatever the case, this is still a good brew and one that is probably most appropriate as a dessert.","ohmybock","Jun 15, 2009"

Great nose - chocolate, coffee, dark fruity esters and caramel. Chocolate takes the forefront in the flavor department, albeit it comes off a little chalky. Some acidity is revealed towards the back. Not getting much of the coffee and caramel in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is somewhat on the thin side for the style; really just shy of medium-bodied, but lacking the viscosity or chewiness of an American Double IS. Alcohol is extremely well-hidden on this one; just a feint suggestion of heat at the very back of the throat. As such, this brew goes down pretty easy.

The weakness in this beer is its palate--this is a rich, sweet, and somewhat cloying beer. A pint is fairly drinkable, but I wouldn't combat more than that.

There is a bit of a metallic taste to it and a fusel alcohol presense. The body is thick and chewy but with prickly carbonation; finishes mostly sweet with some roasted bitterness. The alcohol presense is pretty raw, could use some aging. An ""Irish Twin"" to the Choklat as they are not that far apart. The brew could be a bit smoother and the ABV needs to mellow.

I found that the Javah tempers the bitterness of the chocolate from Choklat, it tastes more milk chocolate than semi-sweet. Definitely makes for a far more enjoyable beer. Mouthfeel again is a little dead, I know this is the kind of beer that works with less carbonation, just lacks that ""killer instinct"" zing to it.

Full flavored, sweet rich brownie chocolate taste that finishes with the coffee notes and with chalky malted Necco wafer texture. A really nice sipper. Recommended.","jjayjaye","May 30, 2009"

Taste does match, quite a bit of chocolate and mocha with accenting roast malt and espresso. Medium, somewhat milky body, but just enough carbonation to keep it honest. Finishes like a mocha Starbucks drink. A little sweet, but not quite as overwhelmingly chocolate as the Choklat. A little better drinkability than the chocolate milk like Choklat. Still like the Java and Oat better though.","Bung","May 22, 2009"

Pretty much smells exactly like ST's Choklat. No coffee can really be found in the nose. Big time chocolate flavor on this one. I'm still having trouble distinguishing this one from Choklat. I suppose there is a light smattering of coffee in the background, but the thick luscious chocolate flavor pretty much washing everything else out. A nice roastiness is also present, but this is a chocolate dessert drink like no other. Mouthfeel is medium-high, average carbonation. Alcohol is very well hidden in the taste, but a warming can be felt on the way down. Really, I can't say it enough, this pretty much tastes just like Choklat with only a little bit of coffee mixed in. Not bad, but really nothing new it seems. It really does taste great and I think some age would do wonders for this brew.","KeefD","May 17, 2009"

4.47,6.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"22 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. The aroma is nice and sweet. I mostly smell chocolate, but with a bit of roasted malt and coffee noticable. Taste is pretty much like the aroma. The strongest flavor is of milk and bittersweet chocolate, with some roasted malt and coffee in there too. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and coating. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and easy to drink (well, if you like sweeter tasting beers like this one). The 11% ABV isn't very noticable at first, but it does catch up to you after a while. It's a pretty good beer, I liked it a lot.","bluejacket74","May 16, 2009"
4.11,-2.4,3.5,5,4,4,3.5,"Upon opening the first thing to notice is the aroma right out of the bottle.. it is amazingly chocolatey with smaller hints of espresso. Like coffee-ice cream with chocolate syrup or chocolate rootbeer float.. Pour isnt as viscous as would be expected/wanted, its not really a solid dark color and the head is a dark tan/light brown. Also its fizzier than expected. Taste is quite sweet, like chocolate-covered espresso beans with slight bitterness like black chocolate or coffee.. theres also a chocolate syrup-like element. As it warms and opens up it tastes like a chocolate-flavored candy or such, like a chocolate dum dum lollipop and this becomes less appealing. Mouth, again, is much lighter than expected, but its still full-bodied. Carbonation is a good medium level. Its certainly quite delicious if you enjoy sweet stuff, not as heavy as I'd like for a stout. If you're not into sweets it may become a bit much, I didn't even finish the entire bomber. The chocolate flavor becomes almost artificial tasting around the last few ounces. Still very interesting, though..","BirdFlu","May 16, 2009"

Guys, it's time to stop the pump & dump and stick to making good quality beers that people come back to time after time instead of hoping that every beer obsessive picks up only a couple bombers of each every season.
