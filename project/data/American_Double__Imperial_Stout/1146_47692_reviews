"Cellared over five years. Minimal head - black as night - very malty and sweet. Not bad at all."
""
"Bottled in 2010.  Drank it in March, 2015.  Smooth, silky.  Molasses, a slight peppery taste on the way down.  Very little alcohol noticeable despite the 11.7%.  The aging worked wonders on this beer."

"I really liked this beer."
"2012, aged 3 or so years. Pretty phenomenal."

"The dry hop has faded into something astringent and weird on the finish. Interesting in a flight with 3 years of bcbs (which is how I am having it) but on its own nothing special"

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 11/19/2012. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense dark tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, licorice, dark bread, light smoke/char, herbal, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready/roasted malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, licorice, dark bread, light smoke/char, herbal, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Light herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, caramel, toffee, toast, raisin, plum, licorice, dark bread, light smoke/char, and herbal/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/bready/roasted malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with an awesome roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible imperial stout. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/roasted malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Not a favorite.  Was a drain pour"
"This bottle is enjoyed a little over 2 years after bottling and it has aged pretty damn well. The taste is sweet with some hops still lingering around although I'm sure they have faded considerably over the last couple years. This one drinks deceivingly well considering the high ABV. Overall, I haven't had a fresh bottle to enjoy of this beer but it is damn tasty after a couple years. Moral of the story: drink one fresh and save at least one to enjoy years down the road. Cheers!"

"Very disappointing.  Overly complicated and harsh, none of the different taste melded together leaving a fairly unpalatable beer."
"22 oz. bottle from a Sat., 12/20/2014 Better Beer Authority Bottle Share (thanks, Zack M.), 2010 vintage (dated ""02/19/10 0458""), poured into a BBA snifter glass, drank over 15 minutes"

"This is another hoppy ""insert beer style here"" beer that I cellared without realizing that it was a hopped up version of the style. It was a good beer regardless, but I bought it within a month of bottling and just got around to drinking two years later. I guess I need quicker turnover and some interns to study all my purchases. I think I'll call my venture Kramerica Industries."

"A unique and intense beer. This is so much more than just a Stout. I will be heading back to see if I can score anymore aged bottles from the discount bin. I think this beer has the legs to go for years. It will be interesting to see what a few more years could do, but I am happy to drink it right now. What a change from when I first tried it, I presume that the sweetness when fresh was hiding some of the underlying complexities."
""
""
""
""
"However, with age and a bottle that is an year and a half old, there's a heavy oxidation. The back has this flavor of cardboard and strange hints of citrus."

"O: Very enjoyable offering from Goose Island. I particularly appreciate how drinkable this is at such high ABV. I went in with BCBS on my mind as a comparison, but once I got into the first glass, I was able to get past the comparison and truly enjoy this for what it is."
""
""
""
""
""

"O - An excellent beer. The slightly odd nose is made up for by the intense, rich flavors. I look forward to cellaring the remaining bottles for some time to see how it evolves and look forward to the 2013 vintage."

"Overall: after one year. this beer is delicious. great flavors and just a little bit of booze. it would be interesting to do a vertical of this beer, but i do like it at a year."
""
""
"Overall a really nice stout. Sweet enough to be a dessert beer - or just dessert. Like drinking chocolate cake. A little more balanced than Southern Tier's Chokolat or Creme Brulee but a bit too sweet to ever be an all-the-time beer, which it isn't luckily"

"Drinkability – The 11.7% abv is nicely hidden, but the bitter aftertaste makes it a bit less drinkable."

"This one could use some lower mash temps to dry it out a bit and maybe more hops in the boil and at flame out to further cover the sweetness. This one is great if you like them sweet."

"Pours inky black with a thick tan head. Good retention and decent lacing. Lots of coffee and chocolate on the nose with faint hints of hop. Coffee hits the tongue first, then the hop bitterness takes over. Warming from the alcohol in the finish with a sweet chocolate aftertaste. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Overall, a very smooth stout."

"Bottle from 11/2012 poured into a Goose Island tulip. Moderate, beige head, medium retention. Black body. Aroma includes coffee, teriyaki, black cherry, leather, some chocolate malt. Taste follows suit. There is a spice in the flavor that I can't describe, maybe anise? Either way, mouthfeel is thick, alcohol well hidden. Interesting stout with unexpected flavors."

"Poured 22oz into teku. Pours oil black with a tan two finger lingering head. Smell is slightly hoppy, some chocolate, caramel, earthy, potato.taste is smooth milky chocolate, some slight vanilla, some vegetable tones, smokey, hop bite at the end. There's a lot going on here, a nice thick hoppy stout, I probably should have had this fresh but I procrastinate. Really liked it, especially the consistency."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The aroma probably took a hit in the aging, but the flavors did not. I saved this one purposely as early reviews noted aging might be helpful. I'm not sure what I missed by doing so, but this is working real fine here and now."

"A pretty good Double Imperial Stout and very unique in flavor and taste. I'll probably pick this up again if I can find it."
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I really enjoyed Night Stalker. The only negatives for me personally are that I found it a tad too sweet and it lacked that classic Imperial Stout essence of toasted and charred malt. With those adjustments it would have been a perfect beer. This would probably pair extremely well with red meat or BBQ. Would I drink it again? Yes, good thing I picked up two bombers when I had the opportunity."
""
"Overall – A tasty and thick imperial with lots of sweetness. One that is worth a try if you are feeling like something fairly sweet, roasty and boozy."

"O-I had a sample luckily, not sure if I could have finished a whole bottle or full pint. I've been told the recipe has changed as they moved back to brew this again after some time off?!? InBev may have messed this brew up a bit. I have a 2011 bottle and I will compare that to this fresh tap version."

"Overall-this beer is so close to being outstanding. Throw in some strong roasted notes and this would be top 5 (stouts) for me. Without I'm afraid it's just a fruity dark sipper that I will have once maybe twice in a year. 4.25"

"Poured from a bomber into a tulip, the beer is almost completely black, with a thick look on the pour and a dense, foamy, light tan head that slowly settles into an uneven surface coating. Aromas of booze, dark cherry and fig sweetness, molasses, and a touch of earth and wood. Roasted notes on the nose, too. Flavors are rich and darkly sweet, with molasses first and foremost, hints of earth and old world fruit, and a touch of roast at the end. Earthy tones help take the cloying off the sweet body, and there is a touch of bitterness that brings balance to the brew. A deep, slow building warmth starts from the booze. The beer is bold and smooth in mouth, with a smooth, clean finish. Aftertaste is heavy and lingering, with subtle molasses and fruit sweet. Heavy hitter, but very good."
""
"Is it fair to call this beer bourbon county light? Im going to go ahead and say yes. It pours dark and oily and smells like sweet chocolate and rich dark fruits. I didnt like the carbonatiom at first so i let it sit and the mellow mouth feel adds to its depth and complexity. Its smooth and syrupy and exactly what i like in an imperial stout. Its a little sweet for you masochists but overall a great beer at a great price."
"I just don't care who owns these GI stouts, they are so frickin' awesome. I am a kid at heard (but luckily legally able to drink), so I enjoyed watching the falling out of the hard pour into a shaker. What was even more fun, especially for my wife, was how the foam, just perfectly cresting the glass by a tiny amount, looks like a sugar cookie sitting on top of the glass. With a whiff, there was a pretty noticeable hop presence, but of course not like an IPA. There was also a very strong sweetness that just billowed out of the glass. Taking a big gulp, you get a really, really malty kick, with only a touch of roasted-ness to it. It really had a delicious flavor, and the hop smell that was so strong was only partly present on the tongue. It's hard to believe that this much flavor isn't from barrel-aging, especially with how long the malts linger in your mouth. With a high ABV, it should be a long-sipping beer, but the flavor and silky-smooth texture had me pounding this thing. Awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
"The acetone character is offputting. Malt is sweeter than expected, and more chocolate than roast. Wish that acetone character weren't present. Not sure if it's an unfortunate combo of malt and hop character for my palate or if it truly has an issue. Still, great malt flavor and mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a very dark brown/black color with a frothy, light brown head. The aroma isn’t too bold, just hints of sweetness that seem a little chalky. There is a very complex taste but I was picking out hints of raisin, plum, and prunes, burnt oak with slight hints of vanilla. This is very big and bold which made for a good hour long sipping beer. The finish was kind of sweet and left behind a chalky texture. A very good beer, but I was left wanting a little more given the Goose Island name."
""
""
""
""
"OV: very tasty, balanced and well rounded and the alcohol is pretty well hidden, though you do get it in the aroma and a bit at the first taste, but the flavours are too much and drown it out making this an excellent sipper."
"M&D&O - complex and layered, big on flavor and it kicks ass. It cant hide the 11.5%. Not an everyday beer. What a powerful flavor, well done GI!"
""
"First time I've had this beer since I tried it fresh 2 years ago. Sadly, I neglected to take good tasting notes at the time, but I do remember it being much more bitter and full of more typical roasty Russian Imperial Stout flavors. It's a very different animal now."
""
""
""
""
"O) I glanced at a thread here on Beer Advocate a few months back questioning the potential for some infected bottles of Night Stalker. This bottle has to be under suspicion. I didn't strongly dislike this beer, in fact there were aspects I rather enjoyed, but the flavor was definitely off. Will need to revisit in order to confirm."
""
""
"My last comment is pay close attention to the label where it says to drink within 180 days of bottling date. The first one I had was past, and though still good I certainly remember it not being quite as bitter hoppy, which struck out some of the complexity. Fresh is best with this. And luckily they offer it during the right season."

"22oz bottle served into a Snifter. Thanks to match1112 for this guy. Bottled on 3/6/10, consumed just over three years later. Pours a dark black hue with a one finger khaki head. The first thing that comes across on the nose is dark fruit and light bourbon, along with chocolate, vanilla, roasted malts, and some hop character. The taste is pretty incredible at this stage: Developed dark fruits and caramel mixed with a bold dark chocolate flavor. This has a nice charcoal/wood complexity to it as well. It's followed by a light bitter flavor and a lasting malt finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, sticky, heavy bodied, with light carbonation. Night Stalker is a very satisfying stout, and it's not too over the top or boozy. Good stuff Brett Porter! ; )"
"O: The hops really transform this IS into a beer that I've never experienced before. Strange at first but it grows on you. Let it warm up. Pretty sweet, slightly spicy, very chocolaty, boozy, and complex. Would I drink again? Probably. Just to see if the flavor is different."
""
""
""
"O - I think this bottle was slightly infected. Just no way the tartness & floral should be in this beer. Need to revisit again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I feel bad reviewing this beer without getting a chance to have a sample from a successful batch. I am not terribly angry, just disappointed."
""
""
""
"O: pretty weird stout. Not bad at all. Interesting. Definitely worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"this is honestly a delicious beer. i've heard mixed reviews about it being too hoppy, infected, etc. but none have just been forward and said it's a great stout, which it is. sweet, but not too sweet. hoppy, but not overwhelming like beer hop breakfast was. high on the abv, but not noticeable."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very excellent stout from Goose Island. A beer to be savored over the course of an hour. Would definitely buy again."
""
"O/D-Yet another stalwart Stout by Goose Island. I love the hop expression here. Its pretty amazing how wide of a spectrum Goose Island can place their Stouts in terms of flavor. Although Goose Island's Stouts are dark and oily, the quality shines bright (cheesy final sentence makes this review completely invalid)."
"Pours midnight black capped by a dark tan one and a half finger fluffy head. Above average retention and splotchy lacing. Huge citrus hops, bakers chocolate, and hints of roastiness on the nose. Bitter pineapple upfront, largely unsweentened dark chocolate, and big bitter citrus rind and roasted malt. Full bodied, smooth, oily, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel. This beer's finish just doesn't work for me, intense and unbalanced. Not a terrible beer, but certainly not a brew I'm in a hurry to revisit."
""
"O: This is a bottle from the questionable batch but definitely no infection here so it clearly doesn't effect everything from 11/19/12. This is quite an enjoyable beer but definitely a big beer that needs to be sipped slowly and savored - not the easiest to drink since the alcohol is not as well hidden as I might have liked."

"o: a beer than I've heard is best after a year. I plan to let my bomber age. I did not care for this beer fresh. heard rumors it's infected... I doubt it really is but it just is a very unique taste that isn't for everybody."
""
""
""
""
""
"I love almost every thing ive ever had form goose island and being from Chicago maybe im a little biased but I had a bottle of the supposed bad batch but to tell the truth it taste good and got the desired affect i was looking for so theres no bad review from this satisfied customer."
""
""
"Was really hoping I got a good bottle. Did not happen as the smell was very much like the worst thing you could smell when expecting an imperial stout. While I cant fully explain what comes out in the aroma, the taste is all teriyaki and soy sauce. I contacted goose island with my bottle date and time stamp just so they could try and limit the people that wasted over 10 dollars on this and instead of letting me know that they were looking into this, they sent me a generic letter saying how they used different hops and it brought on a different taste from years past. They did not go on to explain why people who have tried multiple bottles from this years batch have tasted two really different beers. I would have felt better had they not emailed me a response back at all."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Interesting beer with lots of flavour and big hops, even with some age. Very nice but would imagine the hops might be a bit much when fresh and in full force. This bottle was very tasty though."
""
""
"I sign on to Beer Advocate: lo and behold there's a problem with my batch. This leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth ;)"
"Overall- This is a nice impy stout from Goose Island. Good thing mine wasn't ""infected""."
""
"That being said, I do believe this beer has potential, thus the fair grade for a beer I didn't get to enjoy Immediately and have to wait before it is truly enjoyable."
"Verdict: A interesting Imperial Stout from Goose Island, the hoppy, citrus elements feel a bit clunky and the cohesion is a bit lacking. Certainly an interesting experiment, but not one I’m interesting in seeking out again."
""
"O: A very good stout from GI that held up well after two full years. I was surprised that I still got some of the hops. I have a 2012 bottle that I'm nervous to open because of all of the complaints of infection..."
""
""
""
""
"O- I'm not sure what to think. I think something may have gone wrong with the oxidization in the brew process of this particular batch of night stalker. Gin? not a beer flavor. Goose Island makes tremendous beers- something isn't right with this."
""
""
"O: Though I have not tried this beer fresh, I can say at nearly three years old this beer is still great. Anyone with a surplus of fresh bottles should put one away for a while. Though not mind-blowing, I think this is the most I've enjoyed a stout dominated by dark fruit flavors. Worth seeking out."
"I think I might have had a bad one. Funky flavors overpowered much of anything else. Bought in early January 2013 in downtown DC. Served at recommended temperature with appropriate glassware. Disappointed to say the least. Will try next year's batch, since I absolutely love BCBS and the variants."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very weird beer and I don't know how to rate it as this is the first year I've tried a bottle. If I rate it for what it is and how I enjoyed drinking it, I think it is overall above average, which would be a 4. But I should be judging it against other Imperial Stouts, and this is where it just doesn't measure up, in fact it would be a 2 because I'm not getting a lot of the roasted malt character that Imperial Stouts usually bring. I'm glad to have tried this because the flavour profile is interesting- certainly not infected- and is actually drinkable. But it's not what I expect from beers such as Old Rasputin or FIS. I'm going to take the difference and give this beer a (3)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I was pleasantly surprised by how tasty this was on draft this year. I don't know about the infection if there really was any but I truly recommend seeking this out as it is tasty boozy and affordable."
""
""
""
"Its a bit harsh/bitter, but overall a really nice hoppy stout."
""
""
"i dont get the appeal here so much. this is a very strange stout, and im not sure it all comes together quite right. pours dead black, midnight and impenetrable. lazy tan head on top, lots of big air bubbles. smells like a stout all right, some dark dark english malts, hint of coffee and oddly fresh herbs. the flavor is where it goes weird. i taste a lot of chopped sage, a very potent herb in its own right, and standing out with the alcohol definitely not in unision. theres also quite a bit more yeast that i think belongs in this style. its a little funky and smells old, like feet, and tastes like it belongs in a saison somewhere, not here. alcohol is intense, and the roast on the malt makes it finish bitter. not a huge fan of this, its component parts never join hands. heavy body, enough carbonation, and a severe alcohol sting. im glad i had mates a around to share this one with, a major let down for me. sage flavor in a stout? not for me."
"I last had Night Stalker 2-3 years ago and thought it was ok. This one tastes off."
""
""
""
"O- not a favorite, but not a bad beer at all. I'm sure people will be running from the hills with all of the issues people are having with infections, but my bottle was fine...just not a top level beer on the level of BCBS IMO. Not that that's a bad thing, of course"
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Pass. GI has some great stouts and unfortunately, ""Non-BBA BCS," as it was suggested, falls way short. I'd hope to see they make improvements to this beer as a year-round RIS would be welcomes from the brewery."

"O- A tasty beer, manages to walk the hoppy stout walk pretty nicely. It's also surprisingly drinkable with really well-hidden booze. A nice spin on the Bourbon County base beer, this is definitely worth picking up, although stout lovers and people who aren't into hoppy stouts will prefer regular BCBS and its other variants."
""
""
"O- Going into this with an open mind, and trying not to be tugged either way with the whole ""infection"" debate going on I don't think I'm impressed. Maybe they are infected, maybe they aren't, I can say this. I will not be buying another bottle of the 2012 version to find out. In no way do I see a comparison to the Bourbon County Brand Stout. It's hard to believe that this is the base beer. If there is no infection and this is what it is supposed to taste like I don't think that it would have the score on here that it does."
""
""
""
"The hops have toned down a bit, but they are still quite evident. Rich thick chocolatey sweet hoppy brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I can only assume this is an infected bottle. If not, it is the most unusual and poorly executed stout I've ever encountered. Reading other reviews, it sounds like what I consumed is way, way off. I can only assume it's infected/bad in some regard. I've had other stouts that were just ""meh"" and Night Stalker was entirely different. Didn't pick up sour or ""funky"" notes, just straight soy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great hoppy stout with great interplay between the hops and the underlying imperial stout flavors."
""
""
"Overall a decent beer but not as good as I remember it being a few years back."

"Feels very nice entering the mouth, a sharpness that mellows quite well. I can't stop sipping this. Salvation for the days fatigue."

""

"Readjusting my scores; I sampled about 1 oz. from another bottle (also dated 11/19/12) and it tasted exactly the same - there's far too much strange sweetness and offputting citrus character. I'm still torn on whether it's infected or just not very good, but I'm lowering my scores regardless. Two bottles tasting exactly the same doesn't bode well for this batch, if not the beer in general."
"Overall: It’s good, but way overdone…the alcohol content in this is way too much and completely overpowers anything else here…it’s a thick beer that I will be sipping on for a while, don’t expect to drink this with your buddies…this ain’t that type of beer…it’s a brew for a movie and casual night in with the lady where at the end you’ll probably be fairly buzzed and she’ll be all sleepy…it’s good (alright), but I was expecting an outstanding stout and got some kinda desert liquor…(3/5)"
""
""
""
"O- Not great, but pretty good. Glad I finally got to try this and will probably try it again sometime."
""
""
"Overall: very slow sipping beer - this one lasted a long time. Deep flavors get better as it warms. Really worth seeking this one out."

"O - I seemed to enjoy this a bit more on tap. Sitting down with a glass I am now less than impressed. A black IPA that seems to have a bit too much hop punch which overwhelms the great base beer."
"I could see this one developing even more for years to come. Great stuff."

"Overall- Goose Island releases both this and Big John at about the same time and they both have an interesting similarity. Big John drinks kind of like a wine towards the backend and Night Salker drinks like a sipping liquor towards the end. I definitly give Night Stalker the advantage because of its complexity. A very interesting take on an Imperial stout!"
"22oz bottle with a Bottled On date of 11/19/12. Pours a pitch black color with over an inch of thick, frothy dark brown head. Lots of lacing. Aroma is very hoppy with some roasted malts and chocolate. Maybe hints of beef jerky? The taste is some pine and citrus hops, smoke, roasted malts and bitter dark chocolate. Boozey. Definitely reminiscent of a Black Ipa (namely the Stone 15th Anniversary). Heavy mouthfeel. Rich and smokey at the end. Overall, decent but perhaps slightly disappointing."
"O- This beer is good, dont get me wrong but I find it to be and odd mix between a Black IPA and a stout and doesn't seem to excel in either category in terms of taste. Feel and drinkability are this beers strong suit. Worth trying."

"O: Excellent Imperial Stout. Nice sipping beer at 11.5%. Complex flavors and aromas. I like everything about this beer except the price."
""

"O: This is a perfectly adequate imperial stout, I guess I just had higher hopes for this beer. Not bad, but probably not worth the price of admission. I'll revisit a vintage bottle eventually, but otherwise I'll probably go elsewhere for my imperial stouts."
""
""
""
""
"O - Interesting beer. I've had some hoppy stouts before but this one seems a bit odd. The flavors and aromas don't add up to me as it warms. It is unplesant in a pruny sort of way at times, not sure if this is a not a great bottle or perhaps it was mishandled or something. But as far as this bottle goes it was nice to try but not something I'd probably seek out again."
"Overall, this is an interesting and different stout. I'm not sure if I'm a huge fan of hopping a stout a lot, but it does provide a different drinking experience. This one reminds me of a black IPA more than a hopped up stout because of the more prominent burnt malts over the chocolate. Not sure if I'd go hunting for this one again, but as it is a GI imperial stout for under $10 a bomber, it is a solid value. Definitely a stout to experience at least once."
"Kind of gets perfumey, really hard to drink without food, feel like the hops and malts aren't exactly melding, plus there's an odd meaty, bloody, soap like taste underneath it all"
""
"P.S. Will pick up two more bottles tomorrow, one to age and another for my birthday."
"O: A very interesting beer. Highly hopped for an imperial stout. I like the interaction between the flavors although some friends disagree."
""
""
"2010: This is much better with a year on it. The alcohol has died down a bit and offered up a nice beer. (4)"

"Overall a very different tasting beer, definitely seems like a combination of RIS and an IPA. Very interesting taste, I like it a lot."
""
""
"This really doesn't have my favorite flavor combinations. A mediocre DIPA mixed with a super sweet RIS. Bad by no means but I wouldn't purchase it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-If there was a beer that was the offspring of a DIPA and an Imperial Stout this would be it. The mouthfeel and appearance of a Imperial Stout, yet the smell and taste of the DIPA. Great brew!!"
""
""
""
"O: An interesting beer but not usually what I am looking for in an Imperial Stout. I think I would rather take my hops with pale malts. Maybe some time will settle them down and provide a better integrated beer."
""
""
""
""
"Wow! I've been sitting on this bottle for over a year, passing up chances (rarely as I only visit the lower 48 states because I live in Alaska) to get more because I hadn't tried it. Now I know, this is an exceptional beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's pretty bad...I will probably not try it again."
""
""
""
""
""

"Decent, but not a standout. Far closer to a black IPA than an imperial stout, even after the 2 years of aging."
""
""

""
""
"O - Very good take on a hoppy stout. The hops do hide from the stoutiness of the beer. Excited to age a few and see how it is once the hops die out. I reserve complete judgement until I get to taste how it is with age. Overal,l I really like this take on a hoppy stout...I just want to taste a little more of the malt profile that I know I will have to wait to taste"
""

"Overall this beer is amazing, bourbon county minus the bourbon, highly recommend to any stout fan. I am going to buy more of these to add to the cellar."

"O: This beer still has a ton of flavor with the flavors having mellowed and blended over time. However the hophead in me want the big hops flavor from this beers youth. Each sip is still bringing layers and layers of flavor but when it was fresh the enormous hops flavors and aromas we matched by the big roasty malt character. The aroma is getting board line unappealing. Fresh this was as close to perfection as I've ever had and I will still seek it out."
""
""
""
""
"The beer poured out as a motor oil black color with a thick brown head on top. The retention is minimal and so was the lacing but the beer coats the glass with every swirl or sip you take. The smell of the beer is boozy, it's heavily roasted and sweet smelling too. There is also a good hop aroma in there as well which is impressive for a beer that is over a year old. The taste is very nice, big amounts of malt and hops, it's got chocolate and boozy vanilla in there too. There is bitterness of some coffee in there too. The mouthfeel is thick, it's oily and smooth with a moderate carbonation to it. Overall this beer was very good, it was well worth the price in my opinion. One of the best I've had from Goose Island for sure."

"O- A very solid imperial stout. Even after 2+ years, the flavor is in your face. Very glad I found this beer randomly on the shelf."
"While BCBS is a great beer, the alcohol heat in that beer can be very overwhelming (with the exception of Rare) and it doesn't seem to fade even after 5 years of age. This is certainly a more accessible big stout from GI since my taste buds aren't being burned off."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice big and bold imperial stout with good balance and body."

" Taste like a good imp. stout.roasted malts, no coffee but there is some dark chocolate in there somewhere. very smooth mouthfeel, low carbonation. Also very rich, wish i had some 1 2 share this with (sorry Nate, RIck, Jeff, Dewy, Chad and anyone else who wud like 2 b here now!) this is a good balanced imp. stout but nothing mindblowing."
""
""
"O: Aging has done this beer some good - it's tasting pretty great right now. Open a bottle if you have one."
""
""
""
"An aggressive put yields a half finger tan head on a jet black body. Aroma is loaded with chocolate and roasted malts and earthy hops. The flavor is very roasted with little coffee presence. Excellent chocolate both milk and dark throughout with sweet vanilla late in the finish. Medium body and light carbonation. Very smooth, well balanced and very easy to drink for the style and ABV."
"O - So hard to judge a beer that hasn't figured out the taste. Just doesn't meld well. I have no idea if this two year old beer is getting better or worse, but luckily I have another bottle to see what it's like in a year or so."
"Overall this beer was super hopped and bitter fresh but after 2 years in the cellar this beer has turned into something wonderful....if you have these sitting in the cellar now is the time to bust them out"
""

"This felt a bit of a mess. Very unwieldy in spots, but absolutely great in others. I shared this with a fellow BA, and he had a hard time drinking it. It went down easier for me. A head scratcher."
""
""
"Nicely thick mouthfeel with medium carbonation and some stickiness. Not bad at all, although not quite as chewy and full as Bourbon County beers. Not on that level but I’m glad I got to try this one nonetheless."
"original review on: 08-17-2010 00:43:57"
"O: This bottle has been in the fridge for ~1 year waiting for a good time to open. If I had realized that I had already reviewed it, I probably would not have waited so long. But, I am very glad I did. This was a very good beer at the 6 month point and it is a very good beer at the 2 year point. I really wish I had a couple more bottles in the basement, it would be fun to open one each year."
""
"O: A really nice imperial stout. I don't know if it was hoppy when it was fresh but there's not much there anymore either way. Wonderful roasted malt character in this one. Complex and balanced. Very tasty and enjoyable. Could probably stand another year or two on it to mellow out the alcohol a little - not that it detracts that much in the first place."

""
"overall - a great, bold, flavorful stout."
""
""
"Cheers..."
""
""
"Sidenote: Is it weird that this beer reminds me of Richard Ramirez? I mean, he was the Night Stalker..."
""
"Overall: Some part of my brain thinks this is the base beer for BCBS. If so, you can tell. It's good, but lacks the depth of it's barrel-aged counterparts. If it isn't, it's solid, but still lacks a cohesion of flavor."
""
"Very, very big Imperial Stout. Heavy on the anise and dark fruits. A real treat, although I generally go for more the chocolate and coffee forward examples of the style, I do enjoy a nice licorice/raisin bomb as well."
""
"So, update: its back - bottled in 2012, picked one up, 'natch - and I'm also really digging the taste of this beer, freshly brewed and bought - nice, mellow, rich, but not over-done - I've also got it in a snifter this time, and maybe that makes a difference? I'm picking up nice chocolate syrup flavors (like there's Bosco in my beer) that I didn't appreciate as much previously."
""
""
""
""
""
"This makes a great companion to robust food, reading, or casual conversation. While I had it in a Dogfish Head snifter, I can easily see it poured over ice cream."
""
"Full bodied with a chewy, velvety mouthfeel. It's a little hot. This brew verges more on the edge of a barleywine if not for the strong chocolate and malty flavors. Still though, I enjoyed this one, even though it's a bit intense."
""
""
"O: Not the most complicated but the flavors were decent. Surprisingly astringent and alcoholic. I think I’ll stick to the BCBS series."
"O: I haven't tasted this fresh, but I'd imagine it has aged VERY well. This is one of those beers that once you've opened and tasted, you imediately regret your decision because you don't know when you might get to taste it again...THAT'S how good. An impecable Imperial Stout."
""
"O: Pretty jumbled, with a lot going on. Wish I'd split the bottle with someone. Resiny hops, alcohol, sweetness, and an overload of dark roasted malts, but this isn't a Black IPA, and these components have a hard time meshing right now. If you've got a bottle, two years isn't too long to sit on it. Wait till next February."
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a very good, heavy hitting Imperial Stout but not my favorite. It had a very impressive, thick, dark pour. The smell and taste were heavy with dark fruit and big malts. The alcohol was also very prevelent although the beer had a harsh aftertaste and it might have been because the alcohol wasn't masked well."
"Cost: $8.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle."
""
""
"O: wonderful stout, up there with the best of the non-barrel-aged stouts. Got it 8 months later, but it was still worth it. Hoppy like a Storm King, but thick and delicious like Darkness. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this. I would probably take this over Bourbon County any day. Can't remember who sent this to me, but THANK YOU!"
""
"D: This one has a complex array of imperial stout flavors and a thick mouthfeel. For me, it's sweetness is its downfall, but for those that like sweet dessert drinks, this would be a top choice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very complicated beer that is a very slow sipper, and best to share, but really quite tasty overall as it hides the ABV well enough to allow consumption. As far as imperial stouts go, this is worthy of seeking out for the experience. It took me quite a long time to finish the bomber alone, but I savored and enjoyed every sip."

"'10(4.5): Aged, this beer is sweeter, tastier, smoother and much more drinkable. The label says it can be aged for up to five years, and I recommend waiting at least one. What is lost in terms of smell, is more than made up in appearance, taste, mouthfeel and overall drinkability."
""
""
"M: Thick, vicious, viscous, a little dry in the aftertaste, with a wonderful alcohol warmth that is great for a Minnesota winter night. Perfect feel for the style."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
"O - Big, bold roasted character, abv well hidden for the most part adding a bit of warmth to the experience. I'd love to compare this to a fresh bottle."
""
""
""
""
"This was a very nice sipper. Went for the molasses/licorice angle more than the chocolate/coffee angle, and my flavor preferences for stouts generally side with the latter, but I thought this was quite successful anyway. Nice complex flavor profile."
"O - very good. Hits you hard right away.. Solid beer.. I recommend this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I like this much more than I do Big John. Even at such a high ABV, this beer doesn't seem very boozy in the taste, though I can certainly feel it after only half the bomber! This beer is actually quite high up there on my list of favorite Imperial Stouts, so that's something. The aroma is so nice, it's nearly intoxicating (pun intended). The taste, though not quite as good as the aroma, is really quite nice. And the mouthfeel? Damn near superb. If you like stouts, give this one a try. I really need to get one fresh to really see how these hops are while it's young. That said, this is one great candidate for aging! I think this would just be sublime with another year-year and a half on it."
""
"The mouth is wonderfully creamy and full. This needs to be sipped not gulped. Rich flavors abound. Dark roasted chocolate, raisins, molasses, semi-sweet dark fruits. I love the complexity. Again, the hoppy quality has since faded, but this has developed into a wonderfully tasty treat. Fantastic beer that ages better than I anticipated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is as good of a stout, as I've had in a really long time. I wish I had more than two bottles left. If you have any bottles left from this batch, I would strongly suggest that you open one up on the double. You will not be let down!!!"
""
""

"Pours an oily impenetrable brown. A cap of dark brown foam dissipates immediately to a thin ring of largish bubbles. No lacing per se, but leaves some nice sheets on the glass. It starts off nicely, with rich chocolate and roasted malt aromas melding together well, with some bright hops providing support. But then some strange off-flavor rears its head--burnt rubber, maybe? The taste is pretty bad. I have little desire to dissect what I'm tasting, but here goes: mouthwatering hops, burnt coffee, bitter non-delicious high cacao chocolate. Full bodied and medium carbonation, a little high for the style. Overall, not particularly good. I don't know what happened here. I guess I'll have to revisit this with another bottle."

"I was fairly impressed by this beer. I did think it was a little sweet for my own personal taste but I highly enjoyed the strong chocolate presence here. The head was solid and color was great. Not an easy bomber to drink on my own but I got it done for sure. Not one of the top sweet stouts to me but still a very solid offering from Goose Island"

"Pour: Bottle aged for one year in cellar, poured into celebrator glass."
"Notes: Bottled on 0206/11. Great beer which taste kind of like a Dark DIPA. I enjoyed the mix of all the hoppiness (especially fruity hops) and the dark, charred, chocolaty malt. Overall a very nice beer. Interesting and pretty unique."
"Overall, this is a solid imperial stout that tastes wonderful and is very complex."
"Though maybe a tad oversweet, this is a quite tasty Impy Stout from Goose Island."
"Overall: An enjoyable cap to a Halloween tasting: New Belgium Hoptober, The Bruery Coton, & Night Stalker (after all it's Halloween). The hops in this brew meshed well with their distant cousin... For a dark beer it's still fairly mild - but it's pleasant."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the bitterness of hops, alcohol, and the charred malts, all melding together for a beautifully unified balance. In the nose the hops are almost as forward as the malts, which was a nice surprise. This is even more impressive considering that this is a 2010 vintage, and the hops have had over a year to settle down. For a big hoppy, yet true-to-its-roots stout, this guy hits the mark."
"The bottle does specify that this one can be aged up to five years. I'm guessing it would be better with a couple years on it, this relatively fresh bottle is still quite a bit too harsh in alcohol to be fully enjoyed. I don't necessarily mind boozy brews but this one is really pushing it. I would definitely buy this again, though solely to age; I wouldn't open Night Stalker again without at least a year on it. With only one bottle, my curiosity got to me and I opened it prematurely. This bottle was honestly pretty hard to finish."
"Overall, this brew is showcasing the great un-bourbon-barrled beers the GI is capable of producing. Great tasting stout for sure"
"O: A nice, solid stout from GI. Alcohol warmth still present despite 18 months of aging - wonder if cellaring it even longer would make a difference?"
"O - Nice big stout, great warming beer for a cold day. Would need more complexity and balance to be in the top echelon."
"O: I have nothing but love this bottle of beer. Drink it. Drink it! Love it. I certainly do. [Ed: Last beer of the night.]"
"o: great beer from GI. Lots of depth in this one. Would probably be better after some age. I'd like to taste it after the booze mellows, but I still think this is worth drinking. It's an intense brew, and a great example of the style."
"O: This drank almost like a ""black IPA"". The hops were still very present so I can't imagine what this tasted like 8 months ago. With even more age it should really start to blend into something good. Will revisit."
"O: Solid brew. I only wonder if the booze would mellow with more time, will try again fresher."
"0- nightstalker is a great imperial stout that can surly excel with age. Sadly enough, I hope AB won't wreck this as with go on"
"Not a bad imperial stout, just nothing special."
"O: B+ beer. A very well done beer, no complaints. It just wasn't the best RIS I have had. I think that Big John and this run on similar roads. Good not great."
"mouthfeel - weak body. thin as hell for the style. carbonation is low to none due to oxidation. eeks."
"Mouthfeel - Full bodied. Crisp solvent texture."
"Overall, this is easy to sip, tastes delicious, and really makes the style look good."
"O - The scent and appearance hold this one back from being the best IS... Great brew, thanks for sharing in a fine trade!"
"O- Overall, a solid beer. I think the biggest improvement they could make is toning the hops down slightly, or to use a different variety. I love a hopped imperial stout, but it seemed the hops conflicted with what the rest of the drink was trying to feature."
"One of my first non bourbon barrel stouts and I can see why this one was so popular."
"Tastes even better. What I love about this beer is that it's drinkable. Yes it tastes like a big beer. But everything works together on this one. Nothing is over the top. It doesn't have that sticky sweet mouthfeel like a lot of those other imperials do."
"Overall: Unique --- try it."
"First off, love the label. Bought two one for now and one for the cellar. Poured into my trusty pint glass. Thick in the pour; produced a dark, two finger head. Slight boozy smell, but at 11.7% that is to be expected. I'm not super experienced with stouts so the nuances of the style are still lost on me but I liked it. A bit heavy in the mouth. This is a sipper, not the session IPAs I've been drinking of late (surly rules). Malty, a little chocolaty, and boozy is what I can come up with. Definitely interested to see how this ages..."
"One of the better offerings I've had from Goose Island, and one I'd definitely recommend."
"Pours black with a creamy beige head. Surprisngly the hops really come through in the aroma as well as licorice and dark fruit. The flavor also showcases the hops and dark fruit detected in the aroma. There is also a creaminess to this beer from the smokiness of the malts and a milk chocolate-like flavor that is really quite nice. I would guess that fresh this is closer to a Black IPA than an Imperial Stout and as it matures becomes more stout-like. At any rate, this is an impressive beer"
"I enjoyed this beer. Another nice showing from goose island. Definitely recommend."
"O. This is a very nice beer. It doesn't have the depths and flavors I seek in the top notch beers, but it is very easy to drink. I could see myself getting one of these every time I hit the local bar (If I could get it there)."
"I like the way this brew coats the mouth but falls short of being thick and chewy. I'm ready for the next sip and want to continue enjoying it. Creamy milk chocolate mouthfeel but not sticky. Just the way I like it. I will be pursuing more of this."
"Overall: While not very complex there are plenty of nice elements in this beer. I definitely recommend this one to anyone liking big stouts. This one won''t knock you out but you should find it pleasurable."
"Overall - Its strikingly similar to the big john and if I had to taste this blind I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the two. A good beer overall."
"o - delicious but not an easy drinker. still seems a bit hot at just under a year old. i have another bottle of this but i'm not in a hurry to drink it."
"O: Not dissapointed but have enjoyed other strong stouts from GI more. Strong and tasty through and through."
"OVERALL: This is a shockingly good beer. After all the Bourbon County I had tonight I figured this would be a lesser beer, but it is not. It stands out on its own in a completely different way. It is totally its own brew, strong, proud and highly drinkable."
"O - Great Brew worth trying if you like stouts you must drink this."
"As a huge fan of the Bourbon County Brand series, I knew that this base beer would be good, but I did not expect it to be exceptional. Boy, was I wrong. The year-plus of aging left the flavor profile so well melded and the beer so smooth and drinkable. Overall, an outstanding offering from the folks at Goose Island."
"Had this while talking to GI brewers about beers. Pours relatively dark with a small brown head. Aroma is interesting, hints of hops and roasted chocolate. Taste is good, lots of hops for a IS then the maltiness of the stout hits on the back. Very Ying Yang effect on the taste buds. The back end is not very complex as it hasn't been aged but also isn't too bitter for a young stout. It feels smooth but has a very hot character from the 11% ABV. Very solid, I will put a bottle away for a bit to see how it develops! The GI brewers did mention that this stout is intended to be consumed fresh to capture the hop characteristics before they fade."
"Thick black liquorice coloured body. Creamy soft tan head. Substantial fluffy head at start, fades to persistent thin tan layer. Quite hoppy smell, with rich earthy imp stout aroma, bitter chocolate and coffee. Bitter from the outset with strong espresso coffee, and a potent hoppy bitterness. It finishes with a lingering bitter aftertaste but with a fruity grapefruit hoppiness pushing through. Alcohol is quite prominent. Thick and creamy feel. Full bodied. Just enough light fine carbonation. It's all about the bitterness. One of the bitterest Imp Stouts I have tasted. Goose Island claim it is heavily hopped and it damn well is."
"O - Overall, this is a good imperial stout. It is slightly too sweet for my liking, and not quite enough coffee, but it is very nice. Looking forward to seeing how the one in my cellar ages."
"O: Loved this, loved loved loved it. The nutty notes mixed with marshmallow notes to create a heavenly mousse. This really was as close to mousse like character in a stout that I've ever had. Fluffy, yet with bold and deep nutty flavors. Like I said in the flavor, there's an unusual volume on the flavors of the nuts in this brew. A really eclectic nutty meal makes this into an exotic treat. I'd love to contrast this aged brew with a fresh one. I'm really curious how some hoppiness might fair in a younger flavor profile."
"O: I really enjoyed this. I've only had one bcbs before but I honestly strongly preferred this. Would love to try this fresh and get more of the hops out of it."
"O: Not good. Had some trouble finishing this. Do not open fresh at all. I'm sure this is good later in it's life but right now, not so much."
"Pours an extremely thick opaque black with a 2 inch chocolate milk colored head that fades to a small cap. Nice thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smells of dark roasted malts, spices, lots of citrus zest, and slight chocolate. To me this smells very much like Anchor's Our Special Ale. Taste is extremely hoppy up front with loads of citrus zest and pine. The malt, spices, and chocolate come through on the finish. There is a nice hop/roast bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation and is very thick and creamy in the mouth. There is a noticeable alcohol burn in the throat with each sip. Overall, this is a good stout with a huge hop presence that I wasn't expecting. I am glad I got to try this one."
"o: one id recommend for all to try but not my favorite. B"
"0 - I look forward to seeing how this beer matures with another 6 months and year tacked on to the date."
"O- Another great Imperial Stout from GI. Can't really go wrong with any of therm. Could almost classify this as a Black IPA."
"Overall a solid imperial stout. Not as hoppy as I'd been warned, and I'm pleased with that."
"On the whole, I'm glad I let this baby age for some time before cracking it. The hops, while still prevalent, seem to have matured enough to find a nice balance with the stouty nuances present to create an entirely pleasurable drinking experience. Will definitely have to try this brew again with a few more years on it."
"Overall, I have never been a huge fan of this beer, but I think it is much better (though also much different) fresh. between the booze and the price, I won't buy this often, despite the fact that it sits on shelves around here for months after its release each year."
"O: I like this. It's pretty assertive, not for the faint-hearted, and a VERY slow sipper. Will surely buy it again."
"SkÅL!"
"O: I've always struggled with Night Stalker, alternating between loving and loathing it, sometimes from one sip to another. I think that is the point. And I do keep coming back to it. "
"O- I will be honest, never been a big GI fan, with the obvious exception of Bourbon County, and it's varieties. I gave this a try, wanting to give it another go. But I wasnt exactly converted. The alcohal was not hidden at all. In fact it was very up front. Maybe it would be better with some time, but would loose a lot of the hop, which is one part of the beer I liked. Over all average, not horrible. Despite how easy it is for me to get, there are a dozen stouts I would turn to before giving this one a second thought."
"D/O- I enjoyed this guy immensely, mostly because of the hop aspect. it reminded me of Old Raspy, only with a bigger wang."
"O/D - A sipper if I've ever had one. Certainly tastes as boozy as it is. I really like this beer. Thanks new birfday tulip glass!"
"Overall this was a tough bottle to get through mostly due to the strong alchool presence, I really enjoys the '10 batch so am I hoping with time this will mellow to bring out some of the better flavors"
"O-Very enjoyable. Loved the balance and robust flavor. a must try"
"Overall: I'm glad I waited a good year to crack this one, and I will definitely wait at least another year before I crack the other to see how it's doing. I've read that the hops are VERY present when this beer is fresher, and while I definitely enjoy hoppy beers, I like my stouts thick, rich, smokey and malty and this one definitely fits that bill. Excellent nose, excellent flavors, I would say the only thing that would slow me down is the weight and ABV, but I'm willing to take my chances."
"O: Boy, this is a really nice beer. There are some this will find this beer a little too boozy for them, but I like it..a lot. Night Stalker is such an interesting beer in that it's a big stout with a healthy hop presence that you don't normally see. If you're looking for a stout that deviates from the norm, Night Stalker would be a great option."
"Pours a near black, glossy sheen, small cap of bubbly khaki head, good ring or retention with spotty lacing. Scent unexpectedly dominated by citrusy hops (orange and grapefruit) with roasty and toasty malts and touches of bitter chocolate - getting flashbacks to cheap chocolate ""oranges"". Taste is a huge burst of pungent hops - grapefruity, orangey and touches of pine resin. Noticeable notes of alcohol before heavy malts present themselves. Full bodied, sticky and dry, high carbonation for style with bubbles forming a new head when swirled moderately. Didn't expect a hop bomb from a Imperial Stout. If I knew, I would have aged for a year. Too hoppy and hot. Bottled 2/11."
"O - This is a pretty good, hoppy stout. Huge and flavorful out of the gates, and it mellows quite nicely as it warms."
"O: I'm glad I drank this with friends, who were able to agree with the tastes and smells I was getting out of this one. Also, glad to drink it with others because I don't think I'd want to wade through an entire bomber of this. I don't think this is a good representation of the style, and will not be seeking it out again."
"Bottle dated 2/6/11, some four months old. It pours a full bodied midnight black in color with a light dark khaki head which laces the glass. It definitely doesn't appear as thick as the BCBS variants. It smells of chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, and then finishes with a sweet orange hop aroma. You don't get that from most imperial stouts. The aromas work very well together. The flavors are of coffee, bitter and sweet chocolates, oranges, and it leaves you thinking you just ate some orange Andes mints after a swig of coffee. It is very flavorful really interesting, compared to most of the style. I really enjoy it. It drinks very oily and is pretty chewy. It's a sipper for the most part. The alcohol is also nowhere to be found. Overall, this is a superb beer. I'm glad it's available almost year round."
"Overall, doesn't knock it out of the park, but still a pretty good offering. Going to have to grab one more bottle to age long term in hopes that it mellows out."
"This is not the best Imp. Stout i've had but it's by far not the worst. Having this year's vintage makes me want to pick up a few more bottles to cellar over the course of the next few years to see how it develops. A good solid stout, one that I will enjoy again at an older age."
"Overall: I am pleasantly surprised by Night Stalker. I tried Big John a few weeks ago and thought that the cacao nibs added to the brew pushed the sweetness and chocolate factor over the top, diminishing the quality of the drink. Here we have a more balanced, though certainly very sweet, RIS from Goose Island that gets the job done in a much more satisfactory way. As far as the RIS style goes, this isn't an envelope pusher, but it's certainly worth a try or two, especially if your sweet tooth is acting up. 4"
"O- another great stout from Goose Island. Keep brewin 'em, ill keep drinkin em"
"Overall, this just wasn't my style of stout. It's not a bad beer, but it's not for me."
"O: Overall, I was VERY impressed with this stout. Great taste and good bottle aging. I'm sure this would have only been better with longer aging. Can't wait to try it again!"
"O- It is a highly drinkable beer, but is definatly a sipping beer that taste delicious and is one of my favorite imperial stouts. Wish I had more than one bottle for the wife and me to try!"
"Overall: For a style of beer that usually isn't first choice for me, I was quite impressed. It was a beer that I thouroughly enjoyed and would order again. Overall, great beer."
"Espresso roast coffee blends with notes of currant, dark cherry, and booze in the finish (but with very little alcoholic heat). Mouthfeel is a tad chalky, but the full-bodied consistency is creamy with a near-perfect carbonation level. All in all, a big, bold, complex, wonderful brew from Goose Island. Worth seeking out..."
"Overall is an amazing beer that I would buy again and again If I could get in Oregon."
"Overall decent. Would expect more from this. It starts to develop and then the flavors stop developing."
"O: Loving this brew. Goose Island hits gold again. I was planning on letting this one age a bit, but it was too tempting. I'd be curious to see if this becomes sweeter with age as the hop flavors mellow."
"O: The more I sip, the more I try, the more I can't tolerate the weird taste. It's just too funky. That, coupled with Anheuser Busch taking over this brewery, I think I can forgo GI forever."
"O: Man…the more I have Goose Island’s “best” beers, the more I’m turned off. I heard BCBS is basically this beer with an even bigger oaky booze flavor. In that case, I don’t think I’ll continue my hunt for the famed barrel-aged creation. It must be a specific brewery trait, because all I taste is a sad grouping of artificial flavors. Sorry Goose Island, but I don’t think your absorption into Anheuser-Busch will change a whole lot about the taste of your beers. Honestly, I feel a bit ripped off paying $10 for a bomber of this."
"Overall - Delicious. It leaves me yearning for bourbon. I should have had this before BCBS, because I would have thought it was amazing if I didn't know how good it could be with some bourbon in it!"
"O - I like this one alot. GI makes some quality beer and this is right up there."
"Poured into a Round Barn pint glass. First appearance- opaque black with a lovely tan head. First smells are strongly of hops. Rather unexpected for a stout. First sip was a kick in the mouth, in a good way. Strong hops with rich dark malts. Coffee, chocolate and others all come into play. Seems more like a home-brewed black-ipa, however with a thicker mouthfeel. Overall a lovely beer. I'd love to try a longer-aged bottle."
"The mouthfeel is a little light compared to what I would have thought from the pour and the look but overall a great stout."
"Poured from a 2011 22oz bomber into Dark Lord snifter...Pours a very dark molasses brown into little head and settles into a mocha lace. The nose has undertones of coffee, malt and touch of hops. On first taste it has a rich viscosity heavy in the mouth. Very smooth and only slightly boozy and you can tell with a little age under it's belt it's going to turn into something special. Little carbonation and a bold flavor make this a great beer...tempted to open my 2010!"
"Pours a black, light does seep through edges. Two fingers of caramel colored head. First beer that I have opened and been hit with the scent so quickly. Smells first of hops. Very strange to be be smelling that much hops and be doing it from a stout. Hops is first in taste as well. I have no experience tasting anything like this. This stout has IPA and Stout qualities. I like it. Hops up front but ever so quickly come the roasted malts, clean finish. Creamy mouthfeel. Overall, really good.."
"ETA: I see the reviews vary on this one big time, but apparently age seems to have an effect. I know mine was very fresh, and I detected lots of hops. That probably diminishes with age, leaving a more mellow beer. In the event that I try this one again, especially if aged and I know the age, I will revise this review. Otherwise I am standing by my review, with the overall opinion that this one is over hopped for the style and lacks balance, but is certainly still tasty nonetheless."
"O: Overall I enjoyed this stout ,I have several more that I am aging to see how it mellows and comes together, worth a try ."
"I'm glad I got to try this beer from GI, but I have to admit I was expecting more because of their Bourbon County stout line-up. Overall an excellent beer but if I want a stout from GI I'm going to have to stick with BCS."
"O-A very good stout that was very enjoyable from start to finish."
"black with a brown head and apparently some carbonation at the bottom of the snifter. the head disappears rather quickly and becomes a film on top. smell is hoppy, with a chocolate background. the presence of alcohol is apparent as well. taste is very different. chocolate and bitterness, but also a very strong alcohol presence along with some warming in the chest. the taste is actually pretty good, but there is also a small note of dishsoap. thick mouthfeel. overall, a decent stout. I generally don't like very hoppy ones, but night stalker is much better. and the 3 months since bottling might have helped."
"I probably wouldn't get it again."
"Overall -- Very impressed Goose Island. I'm hoping the ""new owners"" choose to continue brewing this gem of a beer. I believe I need to stock up on this one on future beer runs to Chicago."
"O- I like it, and will definitely drink it again. The most impressive quality of the beer for me is the aroma. Even after three months since bottling the dry hopping is seriously noticeable. The beer is fairly complex, but far from unapproachable. High alcohol makes for a bit of a burn, but the flavor is not compromised. Biggest complaint here is the carbonation. Let it age and this will subdue, but you'll lose some hops. I say drink it now and later so get two!"
"All around a pretty righteous imperial stout. While fresh, it's spot-on for a hopped-up take on the style and it smooths over well with some age. The only downside is the sheer alcohol heat which is strong even for 11.7% abv."
"O - Fantastic. I've not had a lot of hoppy stouts but I imagine this is how it should be done. Its worth having this fresh and with age on it for a nice variation. When fresh the hops are obviously more of a feature of this beer and they are great."
"D-Certainly an interesting beer, its nice to try an RIS that is so distinct. This bottle was 2/6/11 consumed on 4/23/11, it was still hot, stinging with alcohol, certainly give it some time."
"D: Definitely a sipper. A heavy brew, amazing taste, i would suggest pairing this with some sort of food."
"Pours a pitch black, with a small tan head, good lacing sticks to the walls of the glass. Smells of strong alcohol, toffee, roasted barley, stale coffee, and bitter chocolate. The taste is overwhelming with alcohol and extremely bitter hops. Also, I would catch notes of chocolate, but the alcohol was so overpowering that I had trouble finding anything good from this beer. The beer was very thick and creamy and had perfect carbonation. The beer has potential and would probably be a lot better if it was dated 2/6/09 not 2/6/11. The overpowering alcohol really turned me off from this beer. I may pick one up for the cellar and try it in a couple of years and hopefully that will change my opinion of this beer for the better."
"Overall: I'd take this over both BCBCS and BCBVS any day of the week/month/year/decade/centenary/millennium - a brewing masterpiece. Hats off to Goose Island."
"O: Did not like this at all. Way to hop forward, way to bitter, not enough roast, not enough chocolate or sweet vanilla I have been acustomed to with imperial stouts. I hope to revisit this once it has some age on it, but as for now, it's going down the drain. Skal."
"Drink- Big, Hoppy stout and very tasty. I want to try the Big John now. Finishes a bit dry and retains a bit of bitter as well."
"Pours jet black with a small caramel color head that fades quickly. You can see the thickness of this stout in the pour. Aromas are chocolate, cocoa, hops, and roasted malts. Fairly sweet smelling. Taste is spot on with huge bitter dark chocolate notes and a nice crisp hop finish. I have read about the hop presence in this and even after a year it is still very noticeable. A great tasting stout. Mouthfeel is quite viscous. Overall this is another amazing stout from Goose Island. I will continue to age this and start a vertical with each vintage to see how it develops."
"Pours a complete black with a creamy mocha head. Good retention and slight lacing. The nose surprised me a little for an imperial stout- hops appear immediately. Roasted malt, bitter chocolate, coffee, and slight alcohol also present. I take a few sips and am amazed at how good this beer is. Deep roasted malts, coffee notes, bitter chocolate, a touch of booze warmth, burnt sugar, and hops late. Full body, low/medium carbonation, and a slightly dry finish round out this ale. I will always love Goose Island beer even with the recent changes in ownership. This beer rocks and I will lay some down for as long as I can last- loved it!"
" This stout is creamy and full with a delightful finish. Overall I would highly reccomend this to friends and foe alike. No one should be deprived from good beer. Definately a keeper. Be sure and go out and get this beer before Anheiser Busch destroys it. Enjoy!!!!"
"This was bottled in February 2010, so just over a year old. Pours pitch black with thick tan head. The head quickly dissipates to nothing, no lacing on the glass. Smells of chocolate and vanilla with some dark fruit and roasted malt. Sweet flavour, I don't get too much bitterness even though the bottle says there are a lot of hops. Thick mouthfeel. I don't really get any hint of booziness even though this is 11.7% alcohol. A very nice imperial stout."
"O - Could be classified as an American Black Ale. Can't believe how hoppy it is after 13 months in the bottle. Really good beer, and something that I think could be considered a ""Imperial Black Ale."" If tasted blind, I'd have guessed this was a Black Ale, no question. Booze is hidden brilliantly.a"
"Wait, there's 11.7% alcohol in this? Where?..."
"D - damn, this is a great stout. this is actually fairly easy to drink. the ABV isn't too strong or overbearing. I'd like to get another 22 oz of this asap."
"The description says this bad boy would be hoppy but I guess after a year in the bottle it faded. I think that's a good thing. Very nice."
"O- I'll def get one of these again. I have the impression that it will be MUCH better with age but at this point I would have to knock it a few points due to the overwhelming hop presence thatn I think should have been more subdued."
"D: a superb stout, nicely hoppy, wonderful depth of flavors, and well balanced."
"This is a sipper, for sure, but it really stands strong with the mouth feel. Very hop forward for a RIS and I could snag another bottle for aging. Overall, exactly what I was hoping for and quite a pleasant beer. I can only imagine a year or two aging would subdue the heat and hops a little and bring it into an excellent balance."
"Pours a dark, slightly sluggish concoction with a almond colored head that leaves behind patches of lacing. The aroma is dominated by alcohol, toast and caramel. The taste follows suit with intense sweet malt and alcohol melding together to form a rich, heavy brew. In my mouth the beer feels sticky and heavy. The aftertaste lingers for some time and is both dry and sweet. Overall, this was an interesting beer that I enjoyed. Aging allowed this beer to meld and soften while also perhaps increasing the ABV a touch. All-in-all I enjoyed this beer and would consider having another but not in the same sitting."
"Overall: A tad disappointed, but I would really like to try it fresh with the hops. I couldn't finish 10 oz of it. Way too sweet."
"D - Really no alcohol in the 2010, some in the 2011. Smoother in 2010. Overall I prefer this one fresher due to the IPA-like qualities in the nose which are far better presented in the more-recent vintage. It's an interesting brew, to say the least."
"All in all, an extremely thick beer that will give a buzz off of just one easily. It's hoppy at first, but that goes down quite a bit pretty quickly. After that, it's really a very thick, sweet, chocolately stout."
"O- This was ok, it was 9 bucks a bomber, there are far better RIS imo that kinda dough. It's very sweet and hoppy and very boozy."
"Update: On 2/3/12 I had another one of these (from 2010) that I had tucked away in my cellar. Age really did some interesting things to this beer. The hops definitely dropped, except for some residual leafiness. Personally, the lack of hoppy bitterness made the sweet malts a bit too sweet, and I actually preferred this fresh. Regardless, the fact that this is retired makes me cry."
"Overall this was a very interesting imperial stout to me, and I'd like to try aging one for a couple years to see how this flavor would mature."
"Not as tasty as the Bourbon County series, but exceptional nonetheless."
"Not worth $15.99, though, whether fresh or aged."
"This pours black with maybe just a touch of light penetration on the sides, but probably not, a nice mocha head that dies away pretty quickly and little lace. On the nose I've got a couple of things: first, piney hops, a huge amount for a stout in my experience, but also dark chocolate and alcohol. A strange combination which could be really good, I think. In the mouth, there is chocolate all around, a hint of booze, and lots of bitterness at the back, mostly hoppy but also some roast bitterness. The finish is huge and takes forever, the huge body coating the whole mouth with the perfect amount of carbonation. Overall, I quite like this beer, one of the more unique big stouts I've had, and a welcome change from the tyranny of your basic coffee/chocolate flavors that tend to dominate these beers."
"Midnight black body with just a millimeter of dark ruby color illuminated at the edge of the glass. A thick cap of mud-colored head tops it. Magnificent appearance. Smell has at first a bold dark chocolate aroma, accented with honey sweetness, followed by a bit of dandelion. Taste is at first marked with chocolate kinds of roasted malt, a blend of sweetness, a surprising jolt of citrus and piney hops that lingers well after each sip is done. The combination of dark stout flavors with and IPA-like hop profile is not often executed well, but here it blends well. Mouthfeel is creamy, not too heavy. Still, its a huge beer. Delicious, but hard to drink more than one."
"O: Quite good, not sure I could drink an entire one, well...I probably could, but it would take most of an evening. Much better to split with someone. Nice flavors, my kind of stout not having a pronounced coffee flavor."
"In comparison to even competent, reputable imperial stouts, this comes across as a graduate professor amidst a class of kindergartners. It is a beer that has a great sense of importance of itself. I'm shocked to find out how much of the remarkable character of Bourbon County Stout comes, not from the barrel-aging, but this, its base beer."
"D-Very drinkable. Did not realize the abv was over 11% until reviewing the beer. Split the bomber with a friend, he didn't care for it so I gladly had his share as well. A great beer."
"Drinkability: I'm telling myself to keep a slow pace on this sleeping giant (11.7% ABV), but I'm gulping it like it's a 5% beer. I want to enjoy it (which I most definitely am) slowly...but this seems to be a losing battle of taste over mind. Thumbs WAY up!"
"The CPJ"
"Night Stalker might not reach the stratospheric heights of the stupendous Bourbon County Stout, but Goose Island has done themselves proud yet again. Bottom line: unabashedly hoppy American big beer that is right in my hoppy American big beer wheelhouse."
"Overall, an excellent stout! Once again, another imperial stout i can see myself getting again. Not sure how far GI distributes but i live in Chicago so I'm lucky to live at the source. Pick this up if you can. This bottle is fresh, bottle last month, Feb 2011. I never aged a brew before but I'm curious how this will taste with age. I will definitely try this out when i pick up another bottle."
"Initially, before I give it a few swirls, the carbonation is far too high, and it makes the beer feel thin on the palate. However, as some of the excessive carbonation escapes, this comes back to a very solid imperial stout. Syrupy, malty, and full bodied without a hint of alcohol warmth, even at nearly room temperature, this is a great example of an imperial stout."
"D- Not something you want all day long, but throw this one in among the IPA's or whatever else you're drinking for a great change of pace! Goose Island brews the most incredible beers time and time again!"
"D - Slow. Big flavors, big sweetness, big booze."
"D: The beer seems strong but the alcohol is well masked from the taste."
"D - great beer. a bomber is a perfect amount but at just under 12% and with a strong presence of alcohol (which is good but could become overpowering) a bomber is probably all you need."
"D: At 11.7% ABV this is a sipper, though, this is drinking like a black IPA so it could be spead up. BUT WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO?!?!"
"overall, I enjoyed it immensely. it aged extremely well."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. The taste is unique and interestingly contrasts with the style norms, but I would've loved to have the alcohol be a bit more hidden, even at 11.70%. Given that, this is still a neat beer and I really would like to try it fresh."
"Poured pretty thickly, almost the consistency of hot motor oil, with a color to match. About half an inch of khaki head that fades pretty quickly. Aroma has a bit of licorice, a bit of coffee. Decently carbonated. Taste is licorice and coffee, a bit smoky, with a faint, almost cough syrup aftertaste (not necessarily a bad thing). Mouthfeel is very smooth. Started off a sipper, but by the end, I was taking swallows. Good, but I would save any others for more than a year past bottling date. Looking forward to trying one of these after 2 or 3 years."
"I enjoyed this Imperial Stout quite a bit. Definitely one I'd recommend to anybody."
"This is an awesome beer. I am glad I traded for it and probably will again. Can't wait to get a hold of some more GI stouts."
"2010 bottle : Pours to a thick black with a slight tan head; scents of cherry, bourbon and smoke; a spicy, smokey taste with roasted malt and a bitter finish; thick and viscus with a layering carbination and coffee bitterness; a heavy stout whose taste lingers - definitely a strong sipping stout."
"Picked this one up over the summer when I was in the Twin Cities. Served from a 650ml bottle that cost about $10. Pours near black with a nice brown head. Big roasty, hoppy nose has hints of chocolate, molassess and coffee. Nice stout. Should age quite well considering the size."
"This one is different, in a good way. Boozy, but not so much you can't drink it. I like it :)"
"This is sort of some sort of barleywine stout hybrid or something to me. I do enjoy it though and it's a good value very unique tasting brew."
"Pure black color, and a tan head that leaves a great lacing. Smells like tons of fresh hops and some sugar. Tastes like hops. Very green hops, not much roasted flavor like a customary stout. I think the thing they're trying to do is create an imperial stout with loads of hops, and they've succeeded. Not much carbonation, oily mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable for such a high ABV. An interesting beer, but not one of my favorites."
"Overall this beer is pretty good and much better balanced than I expected. It's not all that hit, even a a young age, but it's still a bit too roasty for my liking."
"Overall: This is a great beer. It is basically the base for BCBS with the addition of bittering hops. That being said, I consider this an RIS, with the hops and whatnot. Incredibly tasty and a joy to drink! Recommended!"
"While the hops have faded a bit since this was first released, Nightstalker's still a pretty herbal stout. Good beer, but not my preferred approach to the style."
"D: I like imperial stouts. A lot. But this one is too much for me. Too boozy, and the intense kick in the finish puts me off. The flavors just don't blend as well as they do in the better/best imp. stouts. Might improve with some more time on it to let the flavors mellow a bit."
"Price - $10.49/bomber"
"This is a great brew...I am glad Goose Island bottles this base bourbon county stout."
"D: I like this beer. It's not something I would chug, but moreso something I would drink slowly to relax after a long hard day. I could also see myself enjoying this over a nice conversation with friends."
"I love BCBS and this offering did not disappoint."
"Great beer. GI has so mastered this style and at almost a year old, this one's da bomb."
"very glad to have tried and would definitely seek out more."
"Pours an opaque black with a small head. Good lacing with a full pour. Smells of dark fruit and molasses. I love the smell of this beer and am hoping the taste can live up to it. The taste is sooo smooth and tastes of chocolate, a little smoke and molasses. Very similar to Founders Imperial Stout but a little more refined in the mouthfeel. I cannot express how smooth this is. I could finish this bomber so fast. This is almost 12%??? Tastes like it is around 8-10% This beer with 1 year of age on it was awesome! I don't know if more age would make it better, but I could drink this one all the time."
"Pours a deep black color with a thin brown head and a little lacing. Smells of roasted malts, coffee, burnt brown sugar, and a little chocolate. Tastes of sweet malts, roasted malts, brown sugar, chocolate, coffee, and a little hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is nice."
"Overall impression: Decent, but could stand some more roasted flavor to balance out the sweet stuff."
" The taste is not shy on bitterness either, coming from hops and roast, both. Feels silky and chocolaty, and a little boozy, with a big, bitter, roasty finish. The mouthfeel is thick, but thicker would have been even better. Overall, a strong, robust, but still smooth beer. Loved it."
"When I first came to chicago I sought out the local brews. At first, Goose Island was a real disappointment. 312 is mediocre, and some of their other ""big hits"" are also pretty bland. But over time I've begun to ""see the light"". The exceptional brews from GI are their special edition/seasonal brews. This is a nice addition, kudos GI."
"This is a wonderfully intense beer and is a pleasure to drink. The 11.7% ABV is palpable, which really makes it only suitable for sipping, like most imperial stouts, but this is a great tasting one."
"Although the fireworks outside have since subsided, the fireworks in my mouth still have half a bottle to go."
"I doubt anyone would want to drink more than 22 ounces of this but the 22 ounces you get in the one bottle are very worth it. Great beer...I will be treating myself to this a few times a year."
"THe beer is actually amazingly drinkable for its ABV and thickness, makes a perfect cold weather evening brew. Would definitely buy again, just wish it was easier to find around me."
"Not as viscous as I was hoping, but still had a nice thick mouthfeel. Carbonation is quite lacking, but if it was anymore, I think it would have muted the rather strong flavors. Alcohol is noticeable towards the end, and gives a great warming affect that is well appreciated in the cooler months."
"Drinkability is fairly good. It's a heavy hitter and ends up being a good sipper. though."
"d- definitely a sipper, glad I split the bomber with a friend and a half."
"if you see the 2010 on the shelves buy it, and either hold for longer or drink it, i could see this one gtting better with some age"
"Pours a silky oily jet black with a medium amount of tan foam that dissipates very quickly leaving nothing on top of the beer and nothing on the glass. The smell is fairly hoppy on the first went with aroma of pine. It smells a lot lie a black ipa with dark roast and malt contrasting perfectly. There is also a nice note of chocolate and caramel on the back end. The taste is very hoppy up front with mainly notes of earthy pine. The finish is sweet and chocolatey with a little bit of milky sweetness. Very hoppy, and i would love to see what some time in the bottle does for this one. The drinkability really isn't there, and this is a powerful stout. Very nice, different beer."
"I really wasn't expecting so much from this beer. Well done! I will buy another bottle as the label says it ages well."
"Fuller body, lighter carbonation, plenty of sticky and chewy body. Pretty decent drinking, and the booze has mellowed over time, although it was a bit sweet for me."
"D: Too much, and I don't say that ... ever. Delightfully too much, perhaps, but still a bit much."
"Despite the huge contribution of a liquor flavor, I find this beer to be quite drinkable. The booziness is somehow less offensive than it is in some other beers of this high of an a.b.v. It is a delicious treat, and I will certainly purchase it when I am in the mood for a big, badass Imperial Stout."
"Sweet taste with some hop notes in it. What a good beer. I am not really a stout lover but this beer was great. Thanks guys!!"
"D - Phew! Strong presence of alcohol makes finishing this one a little hard."
"This is a full bodied brew with moderate to low carbonation. A huge abv brew that could or ""should"" be left alone for a few years unless you enjoy the intensity of a bold brew's alcohol presence. After a few sips, I thought this went down fairly effortlessly...that might be because it has my senses already numbed."
"Overall, this proved to be quite a nice change. I was really impressed with the cocoa flavors, which turned out to make for a fantastic flavor for a beer. I would be more than happy to buy this again, and will probably age the next bottles I pick up."
"For 11.70 abv it's quite drinkable. I had no problem finishing the bomber."
"Definitely more complex and hoppy than other stouts I've tried. Has an initial sweet taste with other flavors (coffee, smoke, burnt toast) chiming in ... then the hops take over and a bitterness evolves. It is a very good beer, but my preference (at least for now!) is less of the hoppiness."
"D: Good"
"A good stout, but it doesnt wow me at all; probably would not seek it out again"
"D - Honestly I'm starting to struggle through this 22oz. bottle. Too sweet, too boozy, not my favorite GI offering."
"The mouthfeel was creamy and dense, finishing with a slight alcohol burn."
"The aroma opened with a big hit of black licorice that subsided into the fruity and roasted character. There was a full of a wide range of fruity flavors, from berries and melon to citrus grapefruit. That was backed up by big molasses and chocolate with a bitter roasted finish. Considering how delicious GI's Bourbon County Stout is, I've got to say these guys really have imperial stouts dialed in. It's thick, but drinkable for the strength. Heck of a beer."
"Lots of dark fruits, bittersweet chocolate flavor with a touch of smoke."
"This is a different beer than when it was first released, hops have really faded, but still tasty."
"Drinkability is moderate to high. The ABV is high, but well incorporated which makes for ease of consumption. The flavor profile is pleasing and not overwhelming which again lends itself to ease of consumption."
"D - A bit hot but it becomes more drinkable as you get down the bomber but what can you expect for an 11.7% Impy Stout."
"Bottled on 3/06/10. Pours a pitch black with a thin, light brown head that quickly fades. Thin ring remains around the glass as the lacing dissipates into translucent islands. Smell is complex; hop pine, licorice, anise, sweet roast malt, slight bourbon, soy. Taste is roast malt, chocolate, soy, slight bourbon and oak, coffee, molases, prunes, really complex, deeeelicious. Sweetness and medium thickness in mouthfeel make this damn near perfect. Alcohol doesn't dominate, carbonation is a bit on the low side, but again, almost perfect for this brew. Sweetness begins to gang up on you and coat the mouth after several sips; slight pine makes its way through the malt as well. Not too drinkable, in the way that one will definitely kick your a**, but up there with the RIS style that I so much love."
"Overall, this is a pretty drinkable for an impy stout, but I can think of others which go down a bit more easily (Old Rasputin). Still, this is a top notch brew from a brewery which I'm still discovering."
"Notes: Will be getting this again in the future. Very enjoyable, although a little pricy."
"D - Run-of-the-mill double stout. It's good overall but not exceptional in any way. Definitely a sipper and something to split. A perfect beer to be drinking while watching Pitch Black."
"I can't say I love this beer. It is a beast that is just too hot right now. Maybe with some time in the cellar it will be tamed into something drinkable, but right now it is pretty rough."
"D: Tasty stout, had no problems drinking the bottle on my own. Seemed like there was just something missing though. I have another bottle saved so we'll see if continues to develop as the label says"
"I got this one in a BIF from Lazerlobe recently. Thanks again! Poured into a tulip. The body pours pitch black and doesn't give any head for me. Not much to look at really, just a big black beer. The aroma is pretty typical for the style, but a grassy hop is present in the aroma along with bitter chocolate , slightly burnt wheat toast and dried fruit. Not bad, the grassy aroma kind of detracts from anything else though, it's tough to focus on anything else. Interesting taste, somehow I really get wheat bread out of the flavor with a rustic espresso finish and touch of bitter chocolate, sweet canned fruit, molasses and grass. Grass and wheat bread seem to be a couple odd ball flavor profiles for this one for me. The mouthfeel is full and chewy and the and the carbonation is nice for a heavy beer like this but the overall drinkability isn't to high on this one for me. I don't know that I much care for this one."
"Very smooth mouthfeel with very light carbonation. If it weren't for the abv, I could quaff this like chocolate milk. Well done!"
"D: Good drinkability. ABV is pretty well hidden. Its a big Imperial Stout so it is what it is."
"D - I have one bottle left I'd like to age for another six months to a year, but that will be difficult, this is a wonderful drinking experience right now."
"A superlative example of the style with an unparalleled blend of malts and a creative use of hops...I'm not usually big on hoppy stouts, but Night Stalker is changing my mind."
"Thick mouthfeel with a very mild carbonation as expected for the style. Overall a nice tasting beer"
"Deceptively drinkable, rich and inviting, but knocks you for a loop. Did not have this beer fresh, but with about 8 months in the bottle it tastes outstanding and is worth seeking out and consideration for long term aging."
"Overall- This is excellent! A great imperial stout that is ageing nicely. Not as hoppy as fresh, but that is a given. I think I am going to stock up on this big time when I get a chance!"
"This is a sipper of a beer without a doubt, but I find it to be pretty drinkable given the style. Not too sweet and not too bitter, it goes down pretty easily. Definitely recommended."
"This is a real sipper and it's very desserty, which doesn't make for the most drinkable of beers. Yet, this is not meant to be ingested at high speeds or in large quantity, and, as a cold weather quaffer, it works quite well."
"Conclusion: This is a big 'ole stout. Normally, I like dark fruity booziness in my stouts, but here, I wish it was just mellowed out a bit more. That being said, the dark herbal hops, big chocolate flavors, and big (but nowhere near over-the-top) bitterness make this a pretty tasty offering."
"Overall: Very good. It kind of reminds me of a hot cocoa. It'd be a perfect beer for a snowy winter night. Although the ABV is going to limit my intake."
"The glass I poured lasted me a good hour ""Good to the last drop""was what I thought when I finished. To me this is a great pure RIS well worth the try."
"I just can't get past the combination of fruity hops and roasty malts which produces a black licorice flavor that is just not working too well for me."
"Just right on the heft and fizziness, a solid mouthfeel, and a drinkability you don't find in most Stouts, a go to for me when I'm in the mood to share."
"She sips nicely at first, but warming brings out some of the sloppier features. The hops are present, and I'd like to see what a few years does to bring it all in. It's not quite put together, it needs more time, a bit more together than the Dark Lord 10 but without the potential. She seems near her peak, perhaps it is not true, but for now, a nice imperial stout with a desirous thirst. Just what you need when coming in from a hard night's work in the yard."
"An absolutely delcious stout from the folks at Goose Island. Clearly, they know what they're doing when it comes to making imperial stouts."
"Can't drink a ton of these at over 11% alcohol, but I had no trouble finishing off the entire bottle. Very definitely one to try again only next time I'd like to see what some more aging does to it."
"Overall a really nice imperial stout but not one of the elite. Still worth seeking out and I'm glad I brought one back."
"Finish, long finish on this beer vanilla very sweet and that hint of whisky still there."
"Other than the warming fuzziness settling in, there's nearly no hint of the near 12% of this beer. Remarkably well crafted for the size."
"I might consider one or two of these per year when I want something really heavy but it's not a regular thing for me."
"Yeah, it's talking all right. Mmmm, yummy. Took some time to like, but I'm liking it!"
"D. Goose Island knows how to make stouts. This is delicious beer. Wish I wouldn't have waited as long as I did to try it. Would have liked to taste the hops a bit fresher, although the hops were still very plentiful in the aroma. Very good beer."
"She's a silky, full-bodied brew. Very thick, mouth and tongue-coating and most importantly: chewy. Easily one of my favorite imperial stouts now. An underrated beer, especially under the shadow of its brother, BCS. Put some age on it and drink. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Whereas I can't imagine living life without GIBCS, I found Night Stalker to simply be quite good."
"D. I haven't been overly impressed with most GI beers I've tried. This changes that - I love this beer. Yeah its big and a sipper but damn, this stuff brings the goods with flavor to spare with no overt alcohol. I am glad my wife likes it too - a full bomber would be too much for me. If it weren't $11 for 22 ozs., I'd have this beer on hand all winter long for sipping while watching Sunday football."
"Overall, an intense, flavorful and perfectly balanced beer. The interplay of chocolate notes and hops really helps this stand apart. Shattered my expectations. My highest recommendation."
"Overall it's pretty good, but doesn't really come off as an RIS."
"Overall, I haven't had a RIS in a long time so when I saw this in the store I figured I would give it a shot. I'm glad I did. Its not my favorite of all time but it was definitely really good. Definitely worth a try."
"I'm having trouble finishing this one glass its so heavy, but the bottle will go down smooth cause its so good."
"Drinks: like a surprise. I had heard Nightstalker was a hoppier stout, so I had expected that. What I hadn't expected was rich dark fruitiness, playing perfectly off the roasted malts. An interesting and altogether enjoyable step away from GI's more popular stouts."
"It's drinkable, because the chocolate/molasses keeps you coming back for more. A one and done bomber, but one with all the flavor and complexity you need from an imperial stout."
"This is definitely a sipper. The thickness and rich flavors make you want to savor in small portions. I couldn't imagine finishing a whole bottle to myself."
"Night Stalker delivers on all front. Fantastic aroma, delicious and viscous. I am very impressed though I should not be surprised such a good stout is the base for the BCS lineup. Tremendously enjoyable and a pleasure to drink."
"This thing pours dark as motor oils and looks almost as viscous. The head is huge. It stayed for a loooong time. The smell is very chocolaty with some earthy/coffee smells rounded out with some hoppy bite. The taste is HUGE. And I mean huge for an Imperial Stout. The first sip was like a punch in the tongue. The chocolate and earth were there and then an intense bite of hops and a slightly sour finish. The flavors evolved throughout the drinking with new ones taking over with each sip. This thing almost overwhelms you with the wall of flavor. The mouthfeel is very smooth and just coats with every sip. Drinkability? You better have a friend with you to drink this 22oz bomber. I sat down and drank the thing alone over a 2.5 hour period and it knocked me on my butt (I'm a lightwieght but this thing is not to be trifled with). I really liked this one but I have a feeling this will be even better when it smooths out in a few years."
"D Loved this one fresh (fairly fresh for a stout recommended to be aged 5 years on the bottle) I have 3 more I plan to put some age on. What a great beer. I wouldn't want to run into this stout late at night in the woods."
"I've had this one on tap several times, finally reviewing it from a bottle. Remember it being better on tap. Pours a dark brown color which is black in the tulip glass, small tan head, no lacing. Aroma is super hoppy! Reminds me of Darkness, but without the cat-piss Simcoe hops. Roasty chocolate, alcohol, and herbal, piney hops in the nose. Taste is pretty on par with the aroma. I really like the roasty chocolate tastiness, but the hops are overbearing. I like my imperial stouts to be semi-sweet and malty, which this is, but I can't get over the hoppiness that overtakes what I look for in a stout. Full bodied, sticky, lightly bitter. A good beer, but I like BCS and it's varieties much better."
"(D)- A balanced stout that has alot of age left in it for sure. It is starting to smooth out now with the hops fading, so further time will definitely continue to smooth out those sharp edges and make this even better in my opinion. For those who like a hoppy stout, have this fresh."
"M/D - big n beefy, thick, full bodied. low carbonation. i enjoyed this beer for the most part, the licorice was a little heavy for me and was picked up by a couple other people that i shared this with and was slightly off-put by it."
"I usually don't like hoppy stouts (Storm King and Sweetwater come to mind) but I'm a fan of this one. The centennial seems to accentuate the alcohol...but it also makes the beer standout. I'm a fan."
"OVERALL: An interesting beer for sure. A very hoppy interpretation of the imperial stout, with plenty of flavors to ponder over, and a stronger than average booze presence. Though I might like my imperial stouts a little maltier and smoother, this one has a flavor profile with a lot of potential. She's a little raw still, so I'll age the other bottle and let the hops and booze mellow out a little. It'll probably be a completely different beast a couple years from now. Gents, thanks a lot for throwing a couple bottles my way. Appreciated!"
"This is a beer I wish I could get regularly. It doesn't necessarily fulfill my RIS wishes but it does fill my damn good beer wishes."
"Find the Night Stalker and enjoy it with rich chocolate deserts, roast beef, or even as breakfast. If you are able to grab a couple bottles, I would recommend cellaring a few. Chances are this beer will really pick up steam in two or three years. Wow."
"They have definitely distinguished this beer from the Bourbon County series. Very obvious differences between the two styles. I prefer the other, but this one is unique and easily appreciated."
"Taste also starts with chocolate, then goes dark fruits in the middle, with bitterness and alcohol at the close. Closing flavors linger, not altogether pleasantly. Mouthfeel is velvety, but a bit rough at the close, and drinkability is a bit quashed. An alright beer that goes a bit too far and ends up somewhat harsh."
"Drinkability: Great mix of hops and malt. Rich and flavorful."
"Overall: If your looking for a RIS with fruit overtones: figs, cherries, dates, etc .... perhaps this is not the most appropriate beer for you. My wife, who likes BCBS, Dark Lord, and just about every Imperial stout she has tried, did not like this one. Since I generally like both Coke and dark bitter chocolate, I dug it!"
"Pretty drinkable, though certainly quite intense and filling. This is no session beer!"
"overall delicious and sweet"
"taste follows the aroma closely; i also get molasses. really enjoying the flavor profile of this guy, a lot going on here. quite yummy. medium-full, velvety mouthfeel, lightly carbed. another winner from goose island; i will definitely have this again."
"D A sipper in every possibly way. A darn good one but not great."
"D- This is a great stout, very drinkable. The booze is a bit high but does not come through a whole lot keeping things in check. This will probably be a beauty in six months time, but I did not buy another bottle to find out, oh well it will be there next time Im in NY."
"Drinkability - Rich, filling stout."
"D: Off the charts for a beer of this strength (11.7% ABV!). Drank it quickly and caught a big buzz."
"Overall, I can see this brew improving greatly with age as it was obviously brewed to do so. I'd love to give this one another go-around possibly 2-3 years after the bottling date. Thank you strikertown for the trade man!"
"D- this is a big beer and no slouch in the flavor department. Great interplay of sweet, roast, and hops. Really well done. Almost no sign of the large abv on the palate."
"A very good double stout, a little too sweet in my opinion, almost cloying. I also would've liked more coffee and roastiness in my face. All in all, solid."
"D- A DANGEROUSLY quaffable brew. The alcohol is so well-hidden. In a blind tasting, I would have guessed this to be an 8% ABV beer!!"
"This beer pours a thick used motor oil black color. The head is a one inch in height, and sticks around forever. The aroma is of chocolate, roasted malt, and a ton of hops. The taste is hoppier than the aroma with a strong bitterness. Grapefruit, and citrus dominate with roaste malt coming through beneath. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a silky texture, and low carbonation. Overall, this is a very fine beer."
"Will probably be an excellent beer in another 6 months to a year when the hops die down, but right now I think it needs more time to balance out."
"Nice choice. Been wanting to try this one for a while, ever since I read about it being on tap at the Goose Island brewpub in Chicago. Just happened to stumble upon a bottle in a local shop recently and I thought what could be more perfect than to try this one for review 100?"
"D: A slow sipper but a tasty one"
"Holy christ on a crutch!! Can you form a religion around a beer? This beer is everyting the name suggests, and then some. Extremely drinakble for a 10% beer, even more so as it warms up, and very warming. Treat this beer with respect and enjoy. -- thanks to Greg Koch for the sample, and for making this."
"The mouth feel on this one is ridiculously creamy and thick, it's like drinking a milkshake. As it warms, it gets a bit more syrupy. Definitely recommend this, it's a great beer"
"Notes: Yummy stout but I definitely cannot put down more than half a bomber of this."
"Thanks for this one, timmi!"
"I got this courtesy of Jojomonda. I poured from a bomber into a nonic. It pours black as night with a thin tan head. The aroma is boozey, with lots of molasses and floral hops. Lots of booze on the first sip, complimented by chocolate and molassees. It gets hoppy in the middle and has a strng, lingering alcohol finish. A full bodied brew with nice carbonation and a sticky mouthfeel. It is a very fine RIS."
"Excellent."
"d- d is for drainpour. bad bottle. looking forward to getting a new one to update this. I've heard a lot of good things about this beer, so I look forward to having it taste like it's supposed to."
"Drinkability is wonderful yes, I want more. I think I can drink more, and if I had more I would age more bottles this stuff is rockin', a bad ass American Double Stout from Chitown bring me more. Actually I will have to go back to Columbus, Ohio at Bodega where I procured this fine bottle. Both this and the Brooklyn Sorachi Ace ale were eyein' me up, great place please come again folks. If you haven't been there get to know it when in Ohio."
"D= nicely drinkable for 1 22-oz bottle or shared with friends, not sure I would want more at a single setting, especially with the high ABV% and at $9.95 for a 22 ounce bottle. Not very good with salty foods or especially with salty snacks-- it becomes simply bitter-tart and sweet without flavor remaining. After finishing the 22 ounce bottle the conflictual features had pretty much ruined my taste for any beer for the evening, unfortunately."
"D - Easier to drink than you would expect given the nose and ABV on this one. This is a really good beer and I would love to have it again. I would definitely pick it up if I saw it on the shelves again... which will be a while unfortunately."
"Black with a thin mocha cap of fine bubbles. It looked almost dead during the pour. The little bit of foam that was present stuck around for a while and left a bit of spotty lace on the glass. Lots of grapefruit in the aroma initially, citrusy and fruity, which gave way to roast and toffee, caramel and chocolate, over time. Alcohol was present, but not overpowering. Nice flavour. Bitterness seemed to come from hops and dark grains, giving it a bittersweet chocolate flavour. Lots of citrus up front, toffee and caramel, bready, roast through the mid. Significant alcohol in the finish, but well short of being hot. Lingering maltiness, sweet toffee, grapefruit and alcohol. Full bodied and sort of heavy, very creamy carbonation, luxurious smooth palate coating texture. Lots of alcohol warmth. This is a tasty beer. I'm not always a fan of big stouts with considerable hop character, but it worked for me in this beer since it seemed more of an accent rather than the main focus. Recommended."
"D--This is high ABV obviously, but this sucker is smooth and tasty. I am not having any trouble polishing off this bottle. If you are into IMP Stouts, this is a must try."
"Dense, thick, totally black pour. 3 inch head formed but settled into a thick, creamy 1.5 inches. The initial nose suggests dark roast, smoke, vanilla, and hops. Thick, sweet, medium dense body. The front speaks to vanilla and hints of anise. The middle is rich and shows the alcohol, which, fortunately, is balanced against the chocolate and roasted notes. The nose over time blossoms into extensive hop and burnt sugar notes. Nice Belgian lace forms. The finish is rich, warm, lingering and makes me think of molten chocolate and brandy desserts. This is an excellent beer. It is moreish, but given the high ABV should be consumed with care. This is a cerebral ale! Excellent after-dinner or dessert beverage. Would also do well with grilled, smoked and BBQ-ed food."
"Very fun to drink, but not drinkable. Smooth, hop-dominated stout."
"Cheers to Goose Island for another champion brew--and a delightfully simple packaging to boot."
"D - This is a really good brew from Goose Island. I'm glad they crabked out an Imperial Stout."
"bomber from Whole Foods, P Street, DC"
"I had Night Stalker on tap a few months ago. I recall it being very impressive, but I believe the bottled version may be better. I remember it being a hoppy stout, but I don't think I remember it being THIS hoppy. If you haven't tried it by now, do yourself a favor and find a bottle! It's delicious!"
"Atmosphere is great. Deep, dark, intimidating appearance. Nose is loaded with different components.... sweet, malty, pungent, spicy. Flavor and body is thick, robust, rich, and almost syrupy. A little cloying. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"Good beer, but not at the level of Bourbon County Brand nor any of the classic Imp Stouts (Kate, Darkness, DL, Abyss)"
"Poured into a chalice a very nice thick black color, nice carbonation, quick fizzy tan head, with does leave some nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, lots of chocolate/toffee, some roasty notes. The taste is sweet, malty, nice chocolate/toffee notes, licorice. Full/Medium body, ABV hidden pretty well. Very Drinkable, WOW! what a tasty brew."
"Overall this is a fantastic, rich, complicated Stout. Like dessert in a bottle. I found an entire bomber to be a bit much for just me. I'd be really interested to see what this beer does at it ages."
"D: I think this score would be higher if it weren't for the booziness of this beer. 3.0"
"Whoa, over the top. Poured with a small, fine, cream colored head and a little lace. Color is opaque black with brown notes. Aroma is roasty malt, hop, and dark ripe fruit. Flavor is mammoth and like the nose but jacked way up and kicked in with huge alcohol. Body is a great contrast between silky and mess u up. Finish is like flavor and likewise enormous. Incredible beer."
"I had this beer once before, on-tap at Goose Island's Clybourn St. brewpub where Nightstalker was only available prior to the bottle release. I was a bit disappointed in it; the hevay dry-hopping that I was told was a major part of Nightstalker just wasn't apparent on that draught pour. Hilarious right? Increasingly I feel as if I was served a different beer, like the base beer w/o hopping or something. This bottled version has been nothing short of a revelation. It is drinking Heavenly right now and I need to procure more bottles. Quickly."
"D: It's a good beer. I would rather spend the extra $1 and get a Bourbon County Stout, but it's interesting to taste the base beer for BCS to showcase what bourbon barrel aging really adds to a beer."
"I was expecting a bit more of a foreboding label based on the name. Oh well, the mysteriousness works too, I suppose. The beer pours an opaque black-brown topped by about a finger of tan foam. The nose comrpises a surprising amount of hoppy florals and greenery, with some roasted malts hanging around in the background. This is more of a pale ale's smell than a stout's. The taste holds notes of chocolate syrup, molasses, roasted malts, brown sugar, and, near the end, a strong but still understated bit of hoppy bitterness. Though the bitterness threatens to steer the situation away from impy stout territory, it is restrained enough to allow the stoutness to maintain its dominance. The body is a nice heavy, with light carbonation and a smooth, chewy feel. Overall, a good bit o' brew, but not one I'll necessarily refer to as ""great"". A good one-timer."
"I know they made this beer with aging in mind, but I honestly can't imagine it improving past the point it is at now. A mammoth of a beer, and one that I can say is decidedly better than its bourbon barrel aged counterpart. Some alcohol is present in the swallow currently, but I think it's actually at a good level now and contributes to the overall profile. Went down smooth and easy as it warmed. What a lovely beer."
"Perhaps I expected too much, but I was a bit letdown with this one. A big beer with a substantial, but not overpowering, abv. Up front was nicely creamy with deeply roasted malt flavor. The middle was dominated by a molasses/sorghum sweetness that seemed too sweet and too raw, as if the beer needed a good deal more time to mature. Not unpleasant, but the overall effect was of a beer that was still unfinished. According to the bottle the beer can mature for several years, so I think I will put one back and revist some cold winter evening."
"A little hot right now, sit this one down, I think it will be superb in a year or so."
"Overall: A very good Imperial Stout that is worth your time acquiring. A try it beer. Cheers!"
"D: Nice kick, well blended, rather complex beer that is really complimented by the larger hop presence. This is in no way a sessionable beer, but a damn fine beer to sit and enjoy a glass or two."
"Not the most drinkable beer but it is a high gravity stout. It is a hoppy stout that I could sip on all night long."
"D: even with a 14oz. steak in my belly I'm feeling the effects of 11.2% ABV. Night Stalker is definitely a big boy beer. So many of the imperial stout characteristics you expect, yet so much more you don't normally find in the style. It's a big beer in a big bottle and probably best to share, but I'm not having too much trouble going it alone. Goose Island has done it again- a great brew as part of the Fulton Wood Series that I hope they continue to brew."
"D. Very good, I can't wait to have another, a real treat. It would be incredible over ice cream after dinner."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a medium foamy dirty brown color head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of bitter hoppy notes with roasted malt notes - definitely more hoppy then I was expecting. Taste is also dominated by loads of hops with bitter and citrus notes not common for the style with a side of light roasted malt notes. Body is quite full with a creamy texture and good carbonation with no signs of alcohol. Very good which is not surprising considering the brewer but also more hoppy then most imperial stout I have tried before."
"The dry hopping really makes this a stellar beer. The underlying stout is certainly great as well but the fresh, green floral hop character seems to make this one even more drinkable."
"D - Couldn't do more than one of these, would love to try aging it to see where it goes. I'm really hoping the acetone taste was due to a natural exposure. I will try this again to see if the reaction is still the same, if not, I will make the appropriate changes. Goose Island is a reputable brewer and I would like to give this one another go around."
"Thanks to a good buddy for picking this one up for me. Bottle pours a jet black with a little bit of foam in the glass. Smells like a big bastard of a imperial stout. This honestly tastes like a lighter version of Bourbon County Stout. Both are equally awesome, this just might be a smidge easier to drink. Lots of dark roasted chocolate with some hop bite to it. Very smooth beer and it drinks very well for the high alc%. Glad I got to try this one after all."
"Triple chocolate death cake or bust. What else can you pair this with?!"
"D: this one fits a warm summer day perfectly, the hops lighten it up and is refreshing, will be drinking this one quite often."
"D-So smooth with subtle flavors. Almost 12% and you'd never know it. Amazing beer. It's like 3 different beers in one. It subtle and delicious."
"Overall, a fine and unique example of a very hoppy imperial stout. However, this is really not my cup of tea, more into malt dominated imperial stouts. Anyway, great brew once again from Goose Island!"
"D - Ok, not a session. But so tasty, I will do the 22 myself."
"This is just an excellent beer from Goose Island, who rarely disappoints. I was at the brewpub last summer when this was still draft only and really wanted to try it, but I was feeling under the weather and just didn't feel up to it. It was worth the wait, however. Great beer."
"DB- Good price for a huge, extremely hoppy and interesting take on an Imperial Stout. Hop flavors are superb and blend well with the burnt roasty malt. A sipper, share it, alcohol becomes strong."
"Big beer with great quality's. Some more time in the cellar will due this brew much justice. Either way its a great sipper."
"3.0 D: Don't know what happened. I loved it at the tasting, but as I drink it now, it tastes like it was a year ago. I guess it was the combo of beers I had before this one that made it taste so good. Oh well, I have 3 more of these, we'll see what the cellar will do to these."
"Tastes like a very very dark IPA. Some roasted malt obviously beneath the hop nose. My brain doesnt know what to do with this. A heavy body that has this kind of hoppiness is pretty nuts, and it doesnt bother me as much as some DIPA's even. Will drink again."
"The feel of this beer is pretty heavy at first but does give a bit with a nice smooth finish. It has a bit of a creamy end which makes it go down easy."
"Overall, this is a good beer that I like more than my review will show. Perhaps, somewhere down the road after the hops fade, the true flavors of this beer will show through. I hope so."
"D-This is a pretty easy drinking RIS or at least as easy drinking as they get. The alcohol is noticeable but it's in a positive way. I could really see this one being one of those beers that sneaks up on you, it drinks like a beer that's around 8-9%, rather than the almost 12% it is."
"Poured at a recent BA tasting event. Pours a ralt black with a light tan head. Nose is burnt toast and malts and some grassy hops. Taste is more of the same with more roasty flavors dominating and a noticeable hop bite. Complex. Medium mouthfeel, maybe a touch too carbonated, and a spark of heat at the end."
"D_Very drinkable."
"D: A great stout, could have a pint or two, the 11.7 ABV does not overwhelm."
"Cheers!"
"This is not a one beer a night undertaking. Hopefully GI releases this on a year to year basis, Will check back on the ones I recently bought at Christmas!"
"After a rather shitty day at work, it felt great to get home and sip on this beauty for over an hour. I have another bottle, it will be interesting to see how this ages over a year or so."
"Very smooth, sticky on the lips, and deceptive for 11.7%. This is far more drinkable than Bourbon County, but I love them both the same."
"Pours jet black into a imperial nonic,a frothy mocha colored head atop.An awesome mix of citric hop,chocolate malt,hardwood,and sweet cherries in the nose,a whole lot of good shite goin on.Full on creaminess in the mouth,chewey but smooth,basically perfect in my opinion,it coats but goes down with ease.The hoppiest big stout I have ever had,resiny and woody at the onset,dark fruit and semi sweet chocolate round out the palate,big roast thru the finish.This is everything I expected,just some much good stuff going on,a fantastic beer."
"The aggressive dry-hopping was very evident here and seemed much more forward than what I remembered this being on draft at the Clybourn location last year. I liked the extra flavor that it brought to the table for the most part but I think that I preferred when more of that dark malty goodness was front and center as well. Either way, this is still a killer Imperial Stout from Goose Island."
"D - Enjoyable but a little hot. more hops than I prefer in an imperial stout."
"D- This is a very good hoppy, well balanced stout overall. I love to have a good, hoppy stout. Good balance overall but at this point the hops are only slightly faded but its still pretty boozy leaving the question- to age or not to age?"
"Mouthfeel is medium-plus, not completely silky but a nicely executed thickness with some coating quality. For 11.7% this was pretty drinkable and pleasant enough to share. I'll definitely be having this again in the future."
"This just continues the recent Goose Island trend of knocking basically everything they brew out of the park."
"D-the nose was so hoppy but the taste is much more balanced. great hop profile in the back to balance a nice amount of roasted malts."
"The mouth is creamy and thick but smooth and not cloying. I has a quick clean bitter finish. A very drinkable RIS. This is easily on my top five list of favorite RIS's. The surprising hop flavor is this beers most notable trait. Nice Job GI."
"D - would be interesting to see what some age does to it, alcohol needs a bit of time to mellow but i'd miss the up front and fresh hoppyness. this is a VERY good RIS, very balanced with a lot of char, sweetness, and hop bitterness."
"D - This is hit or miss because the flavor is good but might be a bit much plus the ABV is high."
"J"
"Overall, a very interesting double stout and for me it was quite unique in its hoppiness. I enjoyed it and I'd definitely say it is for those who like their stouts hoppy. Give it a shot if you get the chance."
"D - Really impressed with this offering from Goose Island. It is easily one of the hoppiest Imperial Stouts I've ever had... up there with Storm King. However, the hop bitterness never gets too intense or out of hand. Excellent stuff!"
"O.K.!!! Whose idea was this? Cross-breeding a punch-you-in-your-nose IPA with a creamy imperial stout? You could have warned me on the label somehow that after 20+ years of beer tasting, that I was about to have something unlike any other beer I had ever tasted. Shared a growler with my friend, and as I was pouring into the two glasses, I thought I smelled hops instead of barley. Boy was I right! Huge hops. Big alcohol-hops bittering reaction. This bomber was bottled on 3/06/10 14:45. I am going to lay one down for 6 months and get back to you to see if this huge brew has mellowed..."
"D - In a world where brews like Stone IRS and Brooklyn Black Chocolate are readily available, why mess with this lesser and yet more expensive RIS?"
"Nicely done Goose Island, once again."
"This beer pours mostly black, with a slightly brown hue rounding out the apex of the pour. There is a moderate sized head with a slight trace of lacing. Aromas of rich, roasted malt and alcohol are immediately evident in the nose and present throughout the tasting. Night Stalker is a little hot right now, but not overly so. Some time in the cellar would likely smooth this beer out quite nicely, methinks. I'd happily drink this anytime and am glad it is available in my neck of the woods. I'm going to stow a few bottles of this away for a while."
"This is incredibly drinkable for almost 12%. Not much burn at all."
"Tasty, a sipping beer for sure. Its drinkable, but it is hearty and takes some time to get through. Really need to be in shape to go past 22 oz for this one."
"D: It never felt like 12% (or thereabouts). I didn't know what I'd been missing."
"This is a dark looking beer with a mocha head that pours out two about an inch. It smells of earthy hops, coffee, roasted malts, and something almost tobacco-like. I find this to be a gimmicky, new take on a stout, but it works! Fantastically uniquely tasting stout. I was kind of wary of a hoppy stout, but this is really really good. it's high enough alcohol that I felt it after the bottle, but doing the bottle was relatively easy, although the super flavor of this makes it hard after a bit."
"Tasted from 22oz bottle. Pours super dark brown with a thin mocha head that recedes to thin lace. Nose features very darkly roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, hops, and some nuttiness. The flavors are unique for a stout. On the front of the palate, the flavor is sweet with citrus hops. After, the chocolate, coffee, and nuttiness start to come through. The finish is bitter from both hops and chocolate. The body is full with average carbonation and a long finish. This beer is super smooth and well integrated. It is a little hot, showing the high alcohol. If it weren't for this heat, I would be giving it almost a perfect score."
"This is a very drinkable beer, I wish I had more!"
"EDIT: after finishing my review, I shared a little with my wife and finished up the 22oz bottle together. We both agreed this was the best stout we had tasted in a while. I bumped the smell up to a 4.5, which should take this beer close to A+ category. This is really nice."
"D- This is the first time having a serving over 8 oz. of this beer and it's kicking my ass. It took me a couple of hours to finish this bomber, but maybe that's a good thing!"
"D: It really goes down easy. No harsh alcohol or sweetness or bitterness for that matter. It is one of the most interesting beers ive had in a little while. Its just simply enjoyable. I could consider this an everyday beer... or maybe just my night cap"
"D-While Goose knocked this one clean out of the park I couldnt see myself drinking it an excessive amount, but it is supringly easy to drink for its high alcohol."
"All in all, not quite as good as I remembered thinking it was, but a very good beer nonetheless. I have another bottle cellared and I'm looking forward to trying again with a little age."
"Consumed: 4/17/2010 "
"D- So much going on with this one. Manages to have a range of malt flavors, is sweet yet loaded with hops and has just enough alcohol to keep a nice finish. Simply an awesome beer!"
"This is really interesting. More than that, it is interesting and good. The two don't often go together. A hoppy stout for sure. Though the hops and roasted malt compliment each other well. Excellent, and highly recommended."
"D = Yes, but watch out with this one."
"Taste. Wow this is one rich beer. Loaded with hop bitterness yet sweet. Very good malt profile with coffee and chocolate. Not that many beers have this many flavors blended into one. The mouth feel is really thick and sweet. That is the only thing that kept me from marking this even higher. I love the beer but a 22 oz. bottle is going to take awhile due to the richness. This beer may be better than Bourbon County, possibly the best I have had from Goose Island."
"D - Considering the beers statistics, this beer is very drinkable. Well hidden ABV. Smooth going down. ABV will hurt you - hard to drink a bomber yourself. Not filling."
"Looking forward to this, as I love BCS. Night Stalker pours a thick, oily black. An impressive caramel head forms, and quickly dissipates without much lace left behind. The smell is an awesome combination of rich, dark chocolate and a faint background of hops. Taste is more of the same... I've had hoppy stouts before and not been crazy about them, but Night Stalker pulls it off damn well. I think the key is the balance struck between citrus and earthy hops. Nobody does an imperial stout like Goose Island when it comes to mouthfeel, this beer just melts in my mouth like some sort of rich adult milkshake. I was a bit worried when I heard Night Stalker described as a hoppy stout, as my previous experiences with such beers have been underwhelming (I'm looking at you Storm King), but Night Stalker was phenomenal. I just wish I had more than one bottle left."
"D: This beer is definately a sipper. I enjoyed it very much, however the hoppy aftertaste somewhat limits its drinkability, as does the close to 12% abv."
"What a fantastic beer, I knew it was going to be hoppy, but I had no idea that this would be so hop dominated. I really dig this beer, and it reminds me of fresh Yeti, a beer I haven't had in years. So incredibly smooth and I really like how the aggressive hop character has completely dominated this big roasted beer so thoroughly. The ample hop fruitiness is so smooth and juicy. This is fantastic because it is so hoppy, what a pleasant surprise."
"The mouthfeel is beautifully thick,and smooth with a carbonation level to match. Since it takes me a good chuck of time to finish a bomber by myself as the beer warms it becomes increasingly more silky and drinkable. This beer; as sweet, thick, and high in alcohol, as it is; is surprisingly drinkable, much more so than it's cousin BCS."
"Pours an onyx black with a thick mocha colored head that retains impressively given the strength...very imposing looking. The aroma is tricky at first, with a big citrusy and piney hops blast upfront, followed by some cherry and raspberry notes, gourmet dark chocolate, a little coffee and char, and some alcohol. The flavor has big dark fruit notes upfront, reminiscent of pomegranate and plums, along with some piney and citrusy hops, chocolate, burnt bread, coffee, a little bourbon, and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is full and rich and drinkability is pretty good for the style. Overall a very good imperial stout, not as hoppy as I was expecting but I think that ended up being a good thing,"
"Drinkability- Still a really good beer but not near as tasty as it was when it was just the base beer of Bourbon County Stout. It's gotten way to hoppy for its own good. Not gross Darkness '08 hoppy, but too hoppy none-the-less. Hopefully they go back to the ways of old before they brew this recipe again."
"D: I've been wanting to try this for a long time, and I was pleased by how it tasted. But, I think I would prefer this beer in 6 months to a year when the hops have died down."
"Acquired recently from Premiere. Pours black and thick. Amazing grapefruit aromas, roast is secondary. Creamy full mouthfeel. Grapefruit and then chocolate in mid-sip. Good malting, well tamed astringency. A masterful integration. Good drinkability, over an entire meal."
"Drinkability- Well, this sure was not my type of stout. Have to force my way through the rest of the bottle. Will not drink this one again."
"An excellent stout which is definitely on the high end of the hop spectrum. As this one sits it should mellow and integrate a little better and should be in the elite. Even as it stands, it's an excellent beer. Super yummy."
" This is a very easy stout to drink. I would recommend it to any stout fan."
"Pretty damn good - we had Dark Lord a little later, and I actually preferred the Night Stalker."
"Cheers!"
"F: BItter, the piny, earthy hops and tons of roasted dark malt flavors give it a lot of bitterness. Some sticky sweetness on the finish with more caramel, nuggat, and marshmellow. Chocolate is also just a little bit. It's pretty tasty with a sweet candy bar like flavor. It does drink pretty well though for 12%."
"Drinkability: This is a sipper, but it is smooth. I think it badly needs a year on it. I just didn't fall in love with this mildly roasty, hop juice of a beer."
"Update: Tried again a few times within the past two months and it's overly sweet with little hop influence. Hopefully it will continue to settle down."
"D: Surprisingly drinkable. Alcohol isn't overpowering in the taste, but it does sneak up on you. You can feel it starting to work after a few sips. The punch of hops distinguishes this beer from other American Imperial Stouts. Good offering from Goose Island."
"Jet black with a rich, creamy dark brown head with excellent retention and some lacing, Night Stalker is a beast of a beer. The nose is just wonderful. Plenty of bright citrus character is apparent up front, but the base stout is remarkable. Rich and lush with creamy, dark chocolate, some coffee, licorice and moderate roast, this is a top-notch stout. The palate opens with a moderate dark chocolate character with moderate bitterness. Mildly fruity, I get a little raisin flavor. Beautiful roast character is present as well. Hop character is present with a light-moderate citrus flavor, the blend of chocolate and orange is very appealing. Full in body with an excellent finish with flavors of chocolate and coffee, this beer is absolutely lush on the palate. Carbonation is medium-low. I had no problem drinking my 22oz and am quite looking forward to my next bottle!"
"I will be looking to keep these around, plus they should age very well."
" D- This beer has a smooth but big roasted malt flavor that needs something to balance it like a barrel. The hops are present but not full enough to support the big malt."
"Drinkability: I'm not sure this beer is ""drinkable."" That said, despite its ABV and heat, it's delicious and well crafted and pretty fun to drink."
"mouthfeel and drinkability are neither what i would expect from an impy of such strength. nice beer: not your average impy (fruitiness as opposed to malty elements) but i likey"
"All in all, I definitely like this brew as it seems to blend some flavors in a unique way. However, I do not believe it is worth the hype it has been getting. If you get a bottle or so, let them age for a good year or 2, then open and this should turn from a good beer into a great beer."
"Black Tuesday"
"Would very much recommend every stout fan try this one!"
"This is one that is worth revisiting...it is complex, delicious, and drinkable. Pick one of these up!"
"Drinkability is not the best here unless you wanted to get plastered cause one bomber is this is plenty!"
"22 ounce bottle, bottled on 3/6/2010. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with a small 1/4 inch brown head. Head retention is low, with a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is pretty interesting, the beer smells like coffee, roasted malt, citrusy hops, bittersweet chocolate and some caramel. It tastes like bittersweet chocolate, roasted and burnt/charred malt, coffee, caramel, citrusy hops and vanilla. Great mix betweeen the bitter and sweet flavors, this is a very tasty brew! Mouthfeel/body is full, it's silky and creamy with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is excellent, it's very smooth and easy to drink. It should be a sipping beer, but I like it so much it's a bit hard to just sip it. Also, for an 11.7% ABV brew the alcohol isn't very noticable. I have to say I think this is a pretty good overall brew, it's one of the best beers I've had lately. Definitely recommended."
"This is an amazing, interesting beer, and I look forward to having more soon."
"I can't help but want to drink more of this because it is so unique. For you Michigan beer fans, this is very similar to a combination of Huma Lupa and Breakfast Stout in one beer!"
"Taste: Big hoppy flavors make me think of an imperial IPA or an American barleywine initially. After a few sips the bitter chocolate and roasty qualities of an imperial stout began to set it on the tongue. Very fruity hop flavors with grapefruit and pineapple. It's a good thing that this beer is so bold with it's use of hops because I think it would be rather weak without such a hop presence. As it is, though, it's pretty dang tasty."
"NOTES: I will be stoked to try this after a few years in the basement. My sugggestion however is drink it now, fresh, down let those hops die down at all. Amazing beer and not something I could handle drinking every day. Maybe once a month. This is a HUGE beer and worthy of the A it has as of now!"
"D: One glass is enough."
"A new type of Imp. Stout, this one really does rock!"
"D: Really great beer. This should cellar well and be even better once the hops calm down."
"M/D: Super smooth and tasty. Wonderful for 11.70 percent. Great beer from GI."
"This is the first GI offering I haven't liked. They are certainly still one of my favorite breweries and Ill continue to try whatever they come up with."
"I forced myself to drink the whole pint, not because it was overpowering but because it was so rich!"
"bottle says can be aged up to 5 years but i dont know if i would want to age this beer because the hops are so good"
"I imagine this would pair well with a nice creme brulee or some other kind of vanilla custard. Maybe even flan. Get that nice caramelized sugar and tropical flavor notes really standing out! Or, of course, this might pair pretty well with a good dark, robusto cigar."
"A: A finger thickness of dark creamy head that quickly dropped to an espresso like swirl of foam, black to bark brown in color with a slight burgundy hue, the beer swirls and moves like warm syrup, minute to no lacing - 4.75, S: The first whiff is strong of Maraschino cherries and prunes along with a whiff of some mild solvent (from the high alcohol content I presume), quite earthy and herbal, some aromas of star fruit and plums, very intriguing and inviting nose, less coffee and roastiness than I'd expect from a American Stout - 4.25, T: Alcohol is very evident but largely stays hidden behind the colossal load of hop and sweet malts, tons of pureed raisins and prune juice along with a heavy dose of coffee and chocolate milk, hops are sticky and pungent and pack a strong citrus punch, molasses and rum soaked fudge brownies, all arond an intense and extremely complex beer - 4.50, M: Extremely creamy and thick - 4.50, D: An amazing stout, a true sipper, reminds me of Bourbon County Stout without the bourbon - 4.25"
"Bomber, bottled on 2-19-10 according to the label. Huge, bold, tasty double stout. Waves of dark coffee, dark chocolate, as well as more then ample levels of piney and quite drying hops. So to review, loads of dark malts, laden with chocolate and coffee notes. Rich, chewy and complex. Get a knife and fork out and enjoy this one as a big and bold nightcapper or with a double chocolaty dessert."
"D: This one let me down to be honest. It's just too sweet in the end for my tastes. It's an interesting concept - a very hoppy Imperial Stout. In the end, however, it just did not work for me."
"D- This would have been much better off in a smaller bottle, but it is damn tasty. Very rich and flavorful. This will age amazingly well."
"D: This beer is like yin and yang, but there isn't a balance in there. It's like it has everything in it to make it a balanced beer, but somehow something pulls out front. Not something I would seek out again, but very interesting."
"Luckily, I've been able to try this many times without having to buy a bottle. I think if I was drinking this on my own I would have to dump this. My stomach would thank me because it makes me feel like I'm going to have heartburn. I get a agitated, burning feeling even after a couple samples."
"Good drinkablility, quite an original take on a double stout. If you enjoy hopped up stouts this beer is for you."
"D - One to be sipped on for sure. A tasty, unique offering from Goose Island that I will certainly be buying again and aging for some time. Very impressed by the hopped up twist and interested to taste what a few years will do to this"
"Cheers!"
"Libation: I really like this beer. It has many characteristics that are all wrong for the style and some that are just off, but somehow it all works well together. Despite being a little heavy on the alcohol, low in head retention, lighter than many Imperial Stouts and more hoppy than some IPAs, this is tasty, flavorful, and goes down easy."
"Full bodied, viscous, chewy, with low carbonation. Very smooth. As far drinkability goes, this does not taste like it should 11.7% abv. The alcohol is well hidden. This is a sipper to be sure, and is also a beer I would seek out again."
"Poured into a snifter. 22oz. bottle from my buddies girl friend, thanks Flora! Pours a deep black brown with a small tan head that sticks around for a second and fades to a thin ring around the glass. When agitated the head clings to the glass nicely and slides back on down to its resting place. Great aroma, defiantly can tell this stout has been dry hopped. Great to have a stout with a little hop aroma on the nose. There is also a lot of roasty aromas coming from the array of malts used. Flavor is amazing, chocolaty, caramel and roasted malts hit you right away. There is a distinct vanilla quality to this beer. Its great to drink a stout that hops play such a great role in, wow. This one is velvety smooth with a just right amount of carbonation for a stout of its strength. Thick and rich. Can't really tell this beer carries the percentage it does making it a dangerous one being it is so tasty to drink."
"Overall, I'm impressed with this beer. Goose Island has made a beast of a stout that tastes great. Lots going on from the well roasted malts to the hops to the chocolate molasses notes in the flavor. I can see how this makes a great base beer for the Bourbon County Stout (which I have, but still haven't tried). Luckily I have another bottle in the cellar, so I'm excited to see how this one develops."
"D - Decent for the high alcohol. Pretty good actually. Splitting it with the lady was just right to finish a bomber. 4.0"
"Pours black and viscous with a creamy cocoa head that leaves sticky lace on the glass. Rich roasted malt and plenty of resinous pine sappy hop aroma. Pungent, fruity hop flavors up front that in the end are almost tamed by the lush dark chocolate and espresso flavors that follow. Considering the high ABV, the alcohol is well hidden. The flavors really pop when served at cellar temerature. Full bodied and sticky with prickly carbonation. A whale of a beer from GI."
"Perhaps opening the bomber alone was a bad idea, as this seems it will become taxing. Oh well, sometimes you have to just go for it? Or perhaps...""you only live once""...maybe even ""this beer won't drink itself."" _Insert other catch phrase to justify behavior here_"
"Oh...what the hell - Not to compare apples to apples or anything, and yes to be bold and daring enough to say that the tropical fruit center is akin to Surly Darkness along with its milky chocolate warmth, but this has extra dimension to it with its peppery pinches and its ghostly tobacco-esque earthyness that gives it a bit more complexity and flavor. And I didn't have to stand in line for a half day or trade my first born to get it. It was happily sitting dust free at my tiny little liquor store two blocks from my front door."
"I'll be honest: the first 10 oz. or so went down much more than the next 10 oz, and the last few were a chore. But, it is such a strong, epic beer that maybe some palate fatigue is to be expected. I actually enjoyed smelling more than tasting it."
"D: I didn't know what to think at first, with the beer just a bit too cold, but as it warmed in the glass, it became very enjoyable. It will be interesting to see how this beer ages."
"Hmmm, the flavor is quite good! Surprising from the aroma. I expected a bigger bitterness, but the sweetness is strong with this beer! It's definitely got a sharp and hoppy flavor, but transitions beautifully with the sweet malts, chocolates, molasses, and frech vanilla coffee(??). There's a strong spiciness in this beer too. Can't put my finger on it, but almost like chillies. The nearly 12% ABV is very warming as it slides down your throat. Very thick and full body, medium to low carbonation. A very good stout!"
"Overall I was a little disappointed. I'd drink it again but I'll stick with BCS. For imperial stouts barrel aging > dry hopping."
"This is a nice beer, but way too hoppy for my taste in an imperial stout."
"D- I would like to see this with age. I would think it would mellow out more and become sweeter and less hoppy. I think I would like it better then."
"Roasted malt and coffee bitterness greet the tongue. Bitterness turns pinier and hoppier. Big notes of dark fruit, boozy caramel, dark chocolate, and molasses provide some malty sweetness and warmth. Prominent hops take over in the back half with numbing pine and herbal bitterness. Lingering sweet caramelized fruits and roasted barley/coffee bitterness in the finish. Warming and intense! This is a big beer, with a full body and a thick, syrupy mouthfeel. Chewy. It's also quite tasty and dangerously drinkable for its size and gravity. One of the hoppier double/imperial stouts I've ever had. Watch out..."
"Mouthfeel is really nice and soft, just a bit on the light side. Drinkable, yes, but something about it doesn't shout that it's an amazing beer. The closest thing I can compare it to is Surly Darkness with the hoppiness. I did enjoy that a lot but it was also more of a stout. I'd say where Darkness is kind of like 70-30 Stout-IPA Night Stalker is more in the range of 50-50 Stout-IPA."
"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxFqbLtLO0E"
"I thought this was an absolute world class beer... I expected this to be good and different but this knocked my socks off... Truly an elite beer in my opinion... I loved everything about it..."
"Picked up a bomber of this and it is either probably in the top 2 for hoppiness in a imp. stout. It almost felt like there was a little too much emphasis on the hops, which I almost can't believe I'm writing. Still it was quite tasty, worth seeking out."
"D-As a cold beer good,but as it warms way to harsh,didn't even wanna finish it."
"D - Burning and boozy, just not good"
"Overall drinkability is tough for me to weigh out. Unique as perhaps the hoppiest stout I've ever had. I once professed to love hoppy stouts, but this may have tested the edge of where it's still palatable. It decants nicely and does well with some sitting out to let the alcohol fumes mellow and burn off some of the initial hoppiness. A truly unique take on the style, and one I'll probably find myself wanting again. ABV makes drinking much at once tough. I'm very interested to see how this ages."
"D: it has been a while since I have been able to pull so many flavors out of one brew, very deep and complex, a complete exploration for the palate. Great stuff! I might venture to think that some people will feel this is a pretty sweet stout in overall character. I find it very quaffable and one of the best GIBC brews to date. Anytime, anywhere, I will drink this one"
"D - This beer is hits both sides of the fence, smells like an IPA, tastes like a damn good stout. Once you get passed the huge hoppiness in the nose, the taste of it is very very good."
"almost 12%, but it is well hidden. lots of flavor, never really gets boring. VERY thick so i can see this taking a while to drink."
"BLACK as FUCK in the glass, like the dark triumphant night, crowned by a grim mocha-colored head. When I smell this beer, I smell hops, dark fuckin' roasted malt and alcohol. The hops are floral and spicy, the malt is chocolatey with some licorice. The body is chewy and viscous, the finish roasty, hoppy and smooth. This beer is fucking rocken as fuck, wahoo."
"This is powerful stuff, and I have to say, I'm still on the fence, but as it has time to warm, it's growing on me."
"Thanks again Greg.... This was an awesome trade..."
"Drinkability: This beer was a bit of a disappointment. On one hand, it's a great RIS - authentic, toasty, showcasing great malt and yeast ester notes - but the process notes are all wrong ... it's too thin, too hot, the head retention and lacing are poor. Knowing Goose Island's QC issues, I can imagine process issues are perhaps not terribly uncommon (for the record, my Night Stalker was filled at a roughly appropriate level), and I imagine perhaps they can be worked out in the future without a need to alter the underlying recipe here, 'cause it truly is a good one. Here's hoping they can tweak things just a little to get this one to be a truly world class beer."
"Beer is a little hot. The bitterness in the back is odd. It finishes a little dry overall. Second taste was not as dry or as hot. There is some nice roast in the back and some sweetness up front. The bitterness helps to hold the flavors in your mouth afterward. There is not much of an aftertaste, just flavors that linger. The carbonation in the palate is good as well. I really like this beer. I would recommend it."
"d - I thought this was pretty good, but can't believe it's a stout. It's completely different than what I was expecting. Lots of citrus and piney hops, would try again."
"D: A real treat. My only wish was GI didn't have the filling issues and I got a full 22ozs out of my bottle (probably light two ounces)"
"Drinkability: This is a strange beer with its IPA and Imperial Stout qualities. Some similarities to Surly Darkness, but doesn't come together quite as well. Still very, very good nonetheless."
"Drinkability is good--the bitter hop and malt balance is really interesting, but the molasses becomes overbearing as the beer warms."
"O - Again, very unique. Not something I could drink on a regular basis, but would be great on occasion."
"Notes: Impressive Stout from Goose Island, rather hoppy but in a very pleasing form. The closest thing it reminds me of those I have had lately is the Imperial Stout from Smuttynose, which is also rather hoppy, and while a good brew does not accomplish the richness and balancing act of this one."
"On tap at Goose Island Clybourn 7/20/09. Pours jet black with thick mocha head. Coffee aroma dominates with citrus and pine undertones. Nice balanced sweetness with a mild better finish of roasted cocoa on the tongue. Medium bodied with the alcohol hidden well. Gets much better as it warms."
"This poured a nearly opaque dark mahogany with a little tan head. It smelled like orange and chocolate, with some fresh coffee and grapefruit, and a bit of alcohol. It tasted like chocolate covered oranges, with grapefruit and some coffee and cream and caramel. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste with some alcohol warming. Overall this was one of the hoppiest imperial stouts I've ever had (along with Speedway). It had a truly great taste, almost like a black IPA. It had good body too, and hid the alcohol pretty well, so it was easy to drink. But this is a beer I prefer to sip. Very unique and tasty beer."
"If you're looking for a hop-forward stout, go for Black Sun Stout by FFF."
"D= Really nice brew. I'm happy this got bottled and I'm looking to pick up a few more bottles before they sell out. I already got a few in the cellar but I may not be able to hold off on some of them. Fantastic beer."
"Pour is very viscous and dark brown, near black color with a reddish brown thin slippery head that leave specks of lacing and a thin ring. Aroma is dry, burnt hoppy and roasted malt with dark fruits, bacon and boozy notes. Very distinct for a impy stout and appealing. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, moderate carbonation and a lingering finish of mild roast malt sweetness and hop bitterness. Flavor has a nice malt, chocolately base that is quickly balanced and overwhelmed by dark fruits, hoppy bitterness and again like the nose a mild bacon-y taste. Hops are citrus and very green and fresh. Alcohol is very strong throughout and limits the drinkability of this fresh and suggests (along with the hops) interesting potentials for aging. Overall a distinct, rich IS that stands apart from its cousin BCS. Definitely worth seeking out a few bottles."
"Very drinkable as this is really a well-crafted beer. Does not stand out in any one area but is interesting and really good on the whole."
"Drinkability? While it is very tasty, the in your face alcohol is slowing me down big time. I'd love to try this with a year or 2 on it. ;^) As is, it's a very tasty sipper."
"The beer is a little more carbonated than most of the style, but it suits the flavor combination well. The juicy hops are balanced well by the strong malt characters, if it weren't for all the chocolate it would be more like a barleywine. The alcohol is well hidden by the strong flavors and never overwhelms the beer. This is incredibly drinkable."
"Pretty good, but this one will get much better with some age I think."
"Highly recommend!"
"Notes: Consider me very impressed with this one from Goose Island. Thanks to the guys at Heinen's for securing this one (they had about 50 bottles left when I was there on Tuesday, 3 23 10)."
"D - Dangerously drinkable. Not too heavy at all and clocking in at 11.7 ABV I'd be careful with how easily it goes down. One of the best imperial stouts I've had. Really dig it."
"D: I didn't give up anything crazy for this beer, thanks to StoutFest's generosity. So I can honestly say I'm not influenced by the quest to get it. I simply think it's a fantastic beer, and a great value (at $10). I'm happy to have had it. Thanks man!"
"Just the perfect example of a sipper. thick like port wine, flavored perfectly, a treat to share."
"Good drinkability. A very unique IS with more hops than imaginable. Hoppy IS are a good thing. This is a very worthy brew."
"Seems to drink easier than the abv would suggest. There's enough to contemplate that it doesn't get boring. But really there seem to be startlingly few stout characteristics. This is a pretty tasty beer, but no way is this worth $11, and no way is it going to taste well enough after a year or two to make another $11 purchase justified. Not to mention the missing ounce. I'd be inclined to say it's not ready to drink yet. Way unbalanced. If it shows up on tap again, I will try, but this is a different beer out of the bottle."
"D= On one hand, there are a lot of things I like about this beer. Its very well made, it hides the huge ABV extremely well, and its very unique and interesting. On the downside, it is HUGELY hoppy for the style (not in bitterness but in flavor). I'll be laying down a few bottles and am really interested to see what happens when all that hop flavor fades out of extreme-land. Kind of makes me wish it was toned back a bit now so I could enjoy it more without having to wait a year for the hops to mellow..."
"Overall an interesting imperial stout for sure. I can't really say it's one of my favorites, the high levels of citrus from the hops and the bitter coffee just wasn't meshing well for me in this beer as well as some of my favorite imperial stouts do. I will say that I could see me liking this a lot more with some age on it though. Might have to put one away for a bit."
"D: This was a pretty solid beer. I wasn't really sure what to expect. I would like to try this and the Bourbon County side-by-side."
"I thought that maybe the best strategy was to simply apply a little brie to the moment and enjoy it without further discussion."
"This isn't what you normally expect in a big stout, but it is very interesting and delicious nonetheless."
"It is interesting now, interestingly hoppy, but I think if it aged it could calm down a little, like BCS it is very hot and wild when fresh."
"The beer pours dark brown to black with a brown head. The aroma is coffee and roasted malts with some piney hops. The flavor is more of the same with the coffee and malts being overshadowed by the strong hopping. Medium, very creamy mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"Pours dark and with a viscous character and a HUGE stiff light brown colored head that resists fading. Spotty patterns of Belgian lacing are redeemed by the oily film that I look for in my favorite Double Stouts! The smell is AGGRESSIVE and COMPLEX and nothing short of AMAZING! The full frontal hop attack is the last thing that I would expect from a beverage of this style. HOLY CRAP this is WILD!! The grassy hops over licorice and chocolate aromas are unique and IMAGINATIVE. Adequately carbonated with a light tingle from the alcohol; spikes up with an oily creamy smooth coating texture TOTALLY complements its drinkability. Full flavored, the choco-licorice, plum grassy hop BLITZ is consuming. The licorice and grassy hop flavors linger well into the after experience. The 11.7% ABV is buried...and at $10 a bumper, this one is a COSMIC drinker!! End of story...just feed me Night Stalker for the rest of my f*& life and I'll die a happy BA. Many thanks to DavidEddie for the opportunity to consider this one...it's my new all-time favorite!!"
"An interesting take on an imperial stout. I prefer Darkness more for a hopped up imperial stoutl, but this one is definitely worth checking out."
"Finish is long, bitter licorice, black chocolate, roasted grain and bitter espresso; again, all very well balanced and which goes on forever. A wonderful example of a well balanced and very big stout."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, rich and creamy with a mellow slickness. This is almost too easy to drink for the abv and the sweetness is kept in check well. Overall, this is a pretty damn tasty hopped up RIS. Worth seeking out and possibly even better than I remember it being on tap last year!"
"D - An excellent beer, definitely one I'd like to have again. This should cellar very well, too."
"Update: 2nd bottle thanks to pzymali! Bottled 02/07/11. Cracked it 3/3/11. Pours a thick syrupy black with some pale tan head. And here's that sticky-bud weed hop aroma! Uncanny how hoppy this thing smells with some faint chocolate/roast coffee notes creeping out. The palate notes match last years, but the orange is down played and more hidden this year. Really. F*c*ing. Good."
"This is an impressive stout, no question."
"D: This is going down way to easily for the high alcohol. I've been dying to try this beer ever since they began offering on tap, but never had the chance. When they finally bottled, I bought thinking there's no way this can live up to the hype I've read. It blows way passed they hype! This is an outstanding beer!"
"Overall a great experience. Would be interested to see how this does over time. Might have to get a couple more bottles to try it but drink one fresh for sure because I can imagine alot of this hop flavor and aroma will go away fast so if you got only one bottle, don't sit on it. Drink it now and then get another to save if you want to do an experiment because of the hops, I believe this one was meant to be drank soon"
"Overall a great addition to the GI line. BCS is one of my all time favorites and this is an extremely likable cousin, especially when a bomber is half the price of a BCS bomber. Can't wait to have it again on tap at GI Stout Fest."
"D: Certainly feels like an above 11% abv but does not really drink that way. This is certainly an interesting beast. Certainly hoppier than the Darkness I had a year ago but does not really compare."
"Pretty darn drinkable for 11.7%...this one should age fairly well although the hops will die down which I may or may not like."
"D - I could obliterate bottle after bottle of this, gets easier to drink the more I go. Unbelieveabley dangerous for an 11.70%. I'm always curious to review highly ranked beers that are rare, thinking that the high rating is due largely to the rarity, but this definately did not dissapoint."
"D- this is one intense beer. one bottle by itself is enough for me. in fact, its probably best to find someone to split this with. it took a long time to finish. if possible to believe, i find myself appreciating this one more in the bottle than on tap. wow."
"Overall a great beer that will hopefully be even better after some aging. The hop taste in this sets it apart from BCS. I do still love BCS, but I could drink this more often than that. Definitely happy I purchased this one."
"Next one i pop open, i think i'll also light up a nice thick CAO Brazilia and see how they pair, these seem like a beautiful match. From this inital impression i think this could be the ultimate cigar beer."
"Overall, this was a great experience. This beer is awesome, unique, and a must get. I totally familar but different drinking experience."
"Drinkability is far too high for the strength and style, but it's hard to complain with such a damn tasty beer."
"Overall, a phenomenal beer that just embodies power and finesse. This was a treat and I can't WAIT for the bottles this year, I will be lining up for a case - easily one of the best stouts in the world and well deserving of it's praise."
"one of my favorites new stouts"
"Overall, very nice brew on tap and in growler! Had the pleasure of trying this from a growler in a trade and on tap at BW3's here in Indy"
"While I thoroughly enjoy BCS, the bourbon character is just so huge. The hops are a great addition to the base of this beer and add a marvelous complexity. I will be seeking this beer out in the future..."
"D - 11.2% doesn't lend well to drinkability. Alcohol is quite noticeable...pretty boozy - but definitely less so than a fresh GI BCS. Split this 22 with another BA, which worked out to be just about right. Very good beer, but if I had the whole bottle, it might be an early end to an evening."
"D: Whew! A creeping beast that packs a punch in subtle waves. Very easy to drink, but don't be fooled into thinking this demands less than a full belly and ample time. fortunately I had both after an earlier pasta dinner with a buddy; unfortunately (or fortunately?) this growler was a solo venture later in the evening. Grateful for the try (cheers, Jim) and heartily recommended."
"Overall, I am one happy camper to hear that GI will now be bottling this beer. It's downright incredible. Very well balanced with just the right amount of sweetness and bitterness."
"Overall a fantastic beer. I'm glad I finally got a chance to experience it. I wish they would bottle this stuff so I could lay it down for awhile and see what age could do."
"Had this on tap at the herot. Nice hops coming through for a stout with several flavors that you don't have in standard stouts such as interesting dark fruits and an almost grape flavor of some king. Interesting to say the least but keeping it's drink ability and flavor through the entire pint. Will have this again if and when i get the chance ..Good stuff recommend!"
"D: Very big beer but very inviting."
"Overall, I'm happy I was able to get my hands on this stuff. Very heavy, complex, and there's no doubt you feel like you're being stalked at night. A perfect name on an almost perfect beer. Good job GI!"
"Very good overall! A bit pricey at $10 a pour but hey, you get what you pay for, right?"
"D: When will I ever find this on tap again, tell me."
"A great beer that I would definitely have again. Solid stout from Goose Island."
"This one poured menacing black just like an imperial stout should. Smell was not overly bold, but was a nice blend of hops and the usual big stout suspects. Taste was very hoppy, with a nice chocolate backbone. I was picking up quite a bit of wood which is surprising since I don't think this one touched a barrel. Mouthfeel was thick and creamy like it should be. This was a very fine beer that needs to be bottled."
"Pitch black topped by a cappuccino brown head. Aroma of hops is very powerful. Notes of dark chocolate, espresso, and alcohol sweetness push through the hop perfume. Flavor is very well balanced between roasted malt, alcohol esters, dark chocolates, and that wonderful hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is also very rich and smooth. Drinkability - I only give it a 4.5 because after I had this, the bourbon county stout, the imperial brown goose, and a coffee bender I stumbled a bit on my way down the steps. Otherwise - it would be a 5. No way I thought this was nearly a 12% abv brew! An awesome stout."
"D: what's the abv here... 11.7%?!?! Are you kidding me? This is a huge beer, but comes in extremely balanced and the alcohol is not very detectable. Of course it is a like a meal in a glass with its thick chewy texture, but it is so well balance... this one is dangerously drinkable. The high drinkabillity comes at a price though as I have never seen a 8 oz pour of this under $7. I would love to see this bottled... hopefully the rumors are true."
"Thanks Cheezdawg! (04/10/10)"
"An excellent brew by an excellent brewer. I prefer this over the BCS"
"Being that Night Stalker is the base of BCS (one of my favorite beers period), it's hard for me not to love it. The dry hopping adds a nice touch, and helps bring out some of the other flavors you don't get in BCS. I'd be nice if Goose Island would bottle this as well. Then more people would be able to enjoy it."
"This is a brew where one is truly enough, but in a very good, soul-satisfying way!"
"D: The heaviness and thickness lend this to being more of a sipper, though that is to be expected. Overall a good stout, but between the odd metal smell and the cocoa bitterness, I thought this beer was just a little rough. In my opinion there is good reason why GI typically puts this one into bourbon barrels to mellow."
"~ Purchased this 32 oz growler from Big Z Beverage in Huntington, NY. Pours jet-black and immediately you can smell hints of chocolate, dark fruits, and roasted malts. With a name like ""Night Stalker"" and this bad boy coming in @ almost 12% ABV, you would think this beer would be a little intimidating? Not at all! This goes down surprisingly very smooth and as I let it warm up, all the flavors came rushing out making this one a very special and complex brew. Highly recommended! Watch out though, if you try to drink this one too fast, it'll creep up and hit you like a freight train! ~"
"D: Pretty good. Great beer that I thought would be outstanding."
"22 ounce growler from Bierkraft courtesy of tpd975, thank you very much for this treat Greg, opened with my dad tonight to celebrate my second birthday here on Beer Advocate, poured into my Charles Quint goblet, color is black and it looks nice with a creamy dark brown head that lasts around ten minutes, which is not too big but stands it ground with great retention and decent lacing, aroma reminds me of the Rolo candies, for some reason I kept getting a sweet caramel scent inside a nice milk chocolate, roasted malts mixed with a bit of smokiness, earthiness, toffee, vanilla extract, burnt sugar, good amount of booze, and cinnamon, flavor starts off with roasted caramel and toffee with creamy cocoa flavors following in the middle, roasted malts dominate the finish but there is still that dark chocolate flavor that keeps lingering behind, slightly hot in the aftertaste but not nearly what I was expecting after smelling it a few times, warms up with dry hops oddly, expected these to stick out more at first when it was more chilled but they finished nicely with an earthiness followed by sweet chocolate, flavor sweetens up by the end with dark ripe fruits that almost gives this stout a liquor feel, awesomely balanced beer with a lot to like about it, roasted, bittersweet, and warming mouthfeel, full bodied, medium level of carbonation that probably kept it from being overwhelmingly full, taste lingers for a very long time, drank half of this no problem, wish I had not shared it afterwards in a way, light and inviting for how big of a beer it is alcohol is hidden well in the flavor but stronger in the smell, this stuff went down like it was three or four perent less in ABV, nice and smooth, stoked I got to try this draft only beer that is sitting in the Top 100, one of my favorite beers from Goose Island and one of the better stouts I have had in a long time, wish they bottled this stuff, great beer and glad it was preserved so well in this great Bierkraft bottle, would love to drink again, recommended"
"22oz 'growler' from Bierkraft. Pours black in color with a good sized 3 finger rusty tan head that slowly dissipates. Aroma is big and rich, some strong vinous notes, dark fruit, bit of chocolate and a hint of some ashy roastiness. Taste follows with a nice dose of sweet chocolate and caramel followed by some more of the fruit flavors, ripe grapes, almost a cherry and apple like flavor mid taste, molasses in the finish and aftertaste along with a hint of smoke, some hoppy bitterness and a brush of alcohol. Mouthfeel is very nice, it is definitely big thick and chewy, and yet also smooth and creamy. The malts are heavy and you can feel the weight and strength of the beer, but it stays on the verge and does not get overly cloying or thick. Soft creamy carbonation, a bot of alcohol and hop bite in the finish along with some alcohol warmth. Overall a delicious stout imo, definitely a sipper, a very big beer, but also a very well crafted beer, a great dessert or night cap."
"8oz snifter on draft at the Clyborn location of Goose Island. A very dark beer with about one finger of creamy light brown head. Caramel, coffee and oak notes in the smell. A pleasant burnt coffee taste with a hint of oakiness and heavy malt lingers on the tounge. Very pleasant to drink but very strong also. Took awhile to get this one down but I enjoyed every minute of it."
"They say beer will speak to you. This beer says ""I'm too old, possibly bottled poorly, and a bourbon barrel is better than hops for an imperial stout"""
"On tap at The Ginger Man. Pours black with hardly any head. Aroma of booze, sweet roasted malt, cocoa, and raisins. Flavor is sweet with toffee, lots of caramel, honey cracker, nougat, and raisin. Certainly very complex but I guess I just wasn't a fan of the flavors it had."
"I would highly recommend this beer. I had this on tap at Goose Island (Clybourn)."
"*NB - I believe that BCS is far superior."
"D - This was an awesome RIS. It is not too over the top but extremely flavorful, but the abv forms a monster, making it hard to tame more than one. This is one of the best RISs I have had. Well-done Goose Island."
"D: This brew opens and sits in my mouth amazingly but the harsh alcoholic finish makes it a real sipper. Very good, but I'd much rather have the Bourbon stout than this."
"Drinkability: I would have another but not on the same night, but definitely worth a try."
"Another one courtesy of RomanW70. Poured two shades shy of black with ruby-red highlights around the base of the glass when backlit with a quarter inch, consistent, khaki-colored skim. Nose was molasses, brown sugar and some booze in the back. Taste consistent with nose - lots of brown sugar, chocolate malt and some licorice at the finish. Mouthfeel was lightly effervescent and medium-bodied. Easy drinking - sweet, but not too sweet. Alcohol was well-hidden. Great beer; wish I could get more of this."
"Full body, with a low amount of carbonation. Not really creamy, but approaching. Alcoho is very well hidden for the high ABV. Very nice, but a bit sweet for me."
"This is without a doubt one of the best stouts I've had, and if it weren't for the soy sauce aspect, it would have scored even higher."
"Had this on tap at Kelleher's Irish Pub in Peoria. The apperance was black, pitch black with a decent sized brown/dark brown head that pretty quickly went down to almost nothing. Left pretty decent lacing down the glass but nothing to much. The smell was mainly a hint of coffee, some chocolate and roasted malts. It wasn't strong or anything but was pretty apparent. Taste was similar. Coffee was strong in the taste but not overpowering and not all you could taste. Chocolate was there as well. Pretty ""boozey"". This is one of the few beers were I can say that, though it wasn't so boozey I couldn't handle it. When it warms up a bit is when is shines. Moutfeel is good, nothing spectacular but still good. Drinkability, well I could do a few for sure but one is good enough if I'm going to be drinking all night or drinking other things. Pretty high ABV that is somewhat well hidden but pretty apparent at times. I would definitely drink this again! I've had way better in terms of double/imperial stouts but still it's pretty good and worth trying if you have the opportunity."
"drinkability is excellent. perfect balance, showing but a fraction of its alcohol. great depth and excellent complexity. overall this is surely a world-class beer."
"Pours a deep and dark opaque black, no light gets through this bad boy, very thick and chunky tan head forms, slowly settles down to a thick ring around the glass and a thin layer, lots of lace chunks stuck to the glass, looks pretty fantastic. Smell is insane, very rich, toffee, chocolate, roast, vanilla and wood, raisins and dates, maple, molasses, some alcohol, almost a doppelbock like breadiness, biscuits, lots of dark fruit, very nice. Taste is similarly good, very intense burnt sugar sweetness, toffee, raisin, chocolate milk, roast, dark fruit, rum and molasses middle, maple syrup, dates, alcohol, big sweet finish that balances out with an acrid bitterness, lightly smokey with wood and vanilla at the end, very long finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied with low to medium carbonation. Alcohol is a bit sharp but still comes through buttery smooth, this is damn good stuff. Fantastic finish, like a Werthers. This definitely lives up, I dig it. Thanks a ton Alan!"
"Overall, this is one great Imperial Stout. I think it defines the often used phrase ""dangerously drinkable"". Highly recommended."
"On tap at east village tavern. Black, nice head. Smell is absolutely bursting with stouty aromas of espresso, chocolate, roastiness. Taste has all that, some oakiness (not sure if it's oaked so I could be just imagining it), molasses, mmm. VERY balanced. As far as stouts go, I think it's more on the bitter side (relative to the style), but if you consider it on it's own, I don't think there could be a more balanced beer. Big beautiful mouthfeel. When you finish 12 oz of a beer this size in 20 minutes and are ready for another one, you can call it drinkable. I asked the bartender if she preferred this to the BCS, which was also on tap. She said the BCS was too sweet for her, and since I hadn't tried it before, she was nice enough to give me a little taste. And I 100% agreed with her. I probably didn't have enough to understand the true nature of BCS, but from what I did try, I clearly preferred the night stalker. This goes down with Abyss and Speedway as one of my favorite impy stouts ever. Get some."
"If this beer wasn't the high octane drunk-fuel it is, I'd swear I could drink it all day. So smooth with a perfect sweet/bitter balance. I will most doubt have another, and another, and another, and then another when I wake up from my stupor."
"Not going to knock it for the price, since that has no real bearing on the beer itself."
"Fantastic beer. I'll be on the lookout if this ever makes a return to the Cities in draft or bottle. If I could have had a bit bigger glass of this, it might easily have risen into the A+ range as it warmed more. Highly recommended."
"D- I really enjoyed this one and was glad I was able to give it a shot. If you can find this one out there go for it."
"D: For 11.7% it's quite drinkable, but I don't think I could do more than one even if it were lower ABV. A ton of flavor."
"Pours black, pitch black, with a very thin brown head, almost a ring from the start, which leaves little bits of lacing. This one looks kind of normal for an imperial stout. The smell is very intense. There is a whiff of cracked roasted grains, very raw almost like unboiled wort. There's a bit of booze in here though. And a whiff of dark sweet chocolate is present - though not too powerful. But I can detect quite a lot of sweetness, with a hint of fruitiness - like a rich red wine or something. The taste starts with the overripe fruits, dark plums and grapes, a bit of raisins, followed by some dry, bitter chocolate, very, very rich with these flavors. Then the sweetness comes in, caramelly at times, but sometimes just like chocolate cake or something, washed over with coffee. And in the finish, I can taste some earth hops, and a bit of a resinous feel pulls the beer down as I swallow. This beer is just incredibly rich, almost too rich, with a strong note of booze. This one is very full, but actually not quite syrupy like I expected it to be. Sometimes, I feel like little chunks of grain are going down with the beer. This one is a sipper, most certainly. But a very good one. The pour was into an 8 or 10 oz snifter, which was just the right size to get all of this one that I'd like. I would love to have more of this, though I drank it at like 1 in the afternoon, with a big day ahead, so I stopped at one. A very good beer if you ever get the chance to try it."
"Drinks pretty easy, but too complex & warming to session on.."
"I liked GIBCS more."
"D: Doable, but mostly a one and doner, not something you're going to keep coming back to all night."
"I had this on tap at the Clybourn brewpub, served in an 8oz goblet for $10(!). The beer was as black as brown can be, thin dark tan foam, looked like a nice nightcap. The aroma was hoppier than I expected, very nice in such a strong looking stout, with loads of undercurrents of chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is complex to say the least, a little overwhelming. Lots of chocolate and malty sweetness, not so much flavor from the hops although maybe a hint of citrus, noticeable ethanol and a cough syrup component that I'd have preferred was avoided. The body matches the intensity of the taste, on the thicker side. The drinkability is not too high, as this is truly a sipper and at 11.7% ABV I'd limit my ingestion of this beer to 1 per night."
"Notes: Upon coming back to GA, I further read about this beer online and found that it's heavily dry-hopped with Simcoe and Mt. Hood, which makes a lot of sense. Hopefully, the buzz around this beer will encourage GI to bottle this one of a kind treat. I would love to have more of them at my disposal."
"Great job GI!"
"D - Drinkability is good. No doubt this beer is a sipper but the alcohol is hidden well enough to make it dangerous. One pint would make for a nice limit but I could see having two because it is that good of a brew. The overall balance of the brew in respect to all the categories is actually amazing. This is one that should make into bottles and into the regular Goose Island lineup."
"D- Fantastic beer that I'm happy to have sampled. Thanks to Bamadog for the hookup! I wouldn't mind having a good bit of this to have an extended sample. Even with the high ABV, I believe this is highly drinkable."
"Drinkability: Lower for the style even. The sticky sweetness pairs with the alcohol heat to be a little overwhelming. As with the Bourbon County Stout, I'd probably prefer it with age. Too bad a growler won't work that way."
"Had this on tap. The beer pours almost black, and had almost no head. It smells like chocolate, like a hot delicious cup of drinking chocolate, with roasted aromasand like a delcious fresh cooking caramel. The taste is an insanely delicious balance of dark chocolate, caramel, with roasted nut flavors, with a thick maltiness. Think of every dark, savory, deep flavor, and there's a hint of it in this beer. It feels thick and sweet in the mouth, like melted chocolate. I loved it. It was rich and fantastic. It'd be hard to drink a full pint of this, but I'd keep doing it just because it tastes so good."
"Nice hiss as I opened the cap letting me know that the cabonation held up on this one in transit. It poured an opaque onyx color with a small coat of brown head that falls to a broken film after settling. The aroma brings notes of anise backed by a mild but detectable alcohol. There is a bit of fig fruityness and some chocolate notes in there as well, but both are married well with the anise. It is a little lighter on the nose than I anticipated. The flavor on the other hand is huge. The first to hit me is a spicy anise that moves to a chocolate-covered fig on swallowing the beer. The aftertaste brings espresso and almost a hint of cherry fruityness with a detectable bitterness on the sides and back of my tongue. This one is sweet, but not cloying. The alcohol is certainly apparent in the flavor, but it does not take away from the experience; instead it enhances the flavors in the brew. As I drink more of it, I'm finding some tropical fruit flavors (pineapple and coconut) right as I swallow the beer and lingering into the aftertaste. It is a very unique combination of flavors. The mouthfeel is thick, leaving a good residual coat in my mouth after swallowing the brew. The carbonation is minimal but present and suiting this beer very well. Overall, I am thrilled to have had a chance to try this brew. It is incredibly complex and I think I like this more than after resting in barrels. Drinkability is as expected for the style. I'm not going to sit down and kill the growler tonight, but I can probably make it through a few glasses for sure."
"Drinkability: A strong imperial stout, but it is a little bit syrupy to cause me to really fall in love."
"Good job Goose Island!"
"P.S. The booze really kicks in quick on this one."
"D-I often think I will not like BIG stouts as much as I end up liking them! This is simply and outstanding brew! I really like BCS but I have to say as a stand alone RIS this is one impressive stout. In fact I like this more than BCS. One big, beefy, roasty, flavourful and GIANT tasting stout. Thanks for the opportunity mcallister!"
"Just a bit thinner than BCS, rich and creamy. Nice to sip in a small amount or when paired with the right food...and good luck with that."
"Drinkability is all relative in a beer this size, but I've positively flown through the first 16 ounces of my growler. The next 16 don't appear likely to last long. Deserving of the hype. Only beer that I've had that's anything like this is a Smuttynose Imperial Stout after about a year; this is very similar, but taking one notch further."
"Taste held up, despite drinking with full bodied cigar. Only gave it a 4/5 because I'm biased and prefer the more balanced stouts."
"D - The alcohol isn't overpowering at all. Really smooth going down. I could drink it all night. Or at least until I fell over."
"D - So easy to drink...no real hint of alcohol...very well hidden. I prefer this to the BCS easily. An awesome stout."
"Poured completely black into a 12oz snifter with a pleasant milk-chocolate colored head that left great, sticky lacing on the glass. Aromas were full - bold chocolate, roasted malts - boozy with hints of coffee. Tastes were up-front sweet milk chocolate, heavy roasted malt with hints of espresso. Alcohol is present, but warms the throat. Pleasant peppery hop bite on the finish to round things out. Mouth-feel is thick and coats the palate well. A dark chocolate taste lingers after the pepper finish displaying optimum balance. Great complexity and a very solid representation of an American Imperial Stout. One of the better ones I have had!"
"Doesn't taste quite as complex as the aroma made me hope it would, but there's a still a whole lot of wonderful stuff going on here. Starts sweet and gradually gets bitter--raisins and dates, moving into a middle of chaw, dark chocolate, and dandelions, and finishing up on pleasantly harsh nodes of burnt malt and American hops. Nice--excellent, actually--but in all honesty I like it better when it's made mellow through bourbon aging."
"D- I wish this beer could be served all year long. I really liked this beer a lot and would drink a couple of snifters at a time if I could. Great beer from GI and its great to see this come out."
"Black as high mileage used motor oil with a thick tan head. Aromas of rich dark chocolate, hops and a hint of booze. The tastes is HUGE! Tons of rich bitter sweet chocolate. Followed by hints of roasted coffee, dark malts, and dark fruits. Picked up a touch of smoke as well. Perfectly balanced out with a heavy dose of piney hops. Not too sweet or bitter, balanced just right. The mouth feel is thick, chewy, and creamy smooth. Nicely carbonated. Unbelievably way too drinkable for such a mammoth of a stout. I would consider this one ranks up there with all the other hype up stouts. Defiantly seek this out. Highly recommended!"
"Pours with the look of espresso, pure blackness with only a skim of chocolate brown head that stays that way as you drink. First thing I notice on the nose is a cordial cherry feel. With a light swirl you get some coffee and tobacco tones that all blend together well. A hint of Chocolate is there also. With first sip you realize there is a ton of flavors going on in this one. Chocolate syrup, Cough medicine(in a good way), tobacco and black cherries come through at first. The oak is very woodsy in this one with no bourbon at all. There is a nice hop feel that really develops well as the beer warms and you drink. It is rustic and really beautiful the way it balances the beer and adds character. Make sure you let this beer warm up considerably as it drinks much better and shows it true colors more towards room temperature. I started with this as a 4.5 in flavor but it was so dynamic and amazing after about 10 or 15 minutes of warming up that I had to give it a 5. Mouthfeel is almost electric and multi dimensional the way it beckons for the next sip. Super attractive drinkability, and well hidden alcohol for 11.5%. Lovely."
"I'm going to play the lotto now because I don't want to wake up from this dream."
"The long and short of it is that I will continue to drink the wonderful beer every day until the keg kicks and I would encourage tryng this beer if you have the chance."
"Monster of a beer. Very roasty and dense malts. Unmalted barley and that musty character from the aroma. Huge thick mouthfeel engulfing, creamy and obtrusive mouthfeel. Nice bitterness with huge chocolate and black fruits and a hint of caramel."
"I would love to see this bottled, as this is more versatile than the Bourbon-drenched BCS (which is one my very-very short list of all time favs...proabably top three). And this is every bit as special."
"D: Very well-balanced and wonderfully drinkable. Glad to see this is already on GI's website and will hopefully be a standard yearly offering. Overall, a very solid counterpart to Bourbon County."
"Pours pitch black with a creamy brown head that leaves great lacing. Aroma is spicy hops, coffee/chocolate, and molasses. Flavor is complex and unusual. Tobacco, coffee/dark chocolate, huge black pepper notes, pine. Finish is dry with a lasting astringency and bitterness. Full bodied with a mild creamy carbonation. I am happy to have tried this one, the complexity is great and very different from anything I have tried in the past. The incredible spiciness left my tongue numb."
"Overall, glad to have had this beer. Based on the mouthfeel and aroma this beer had huge potential. Just something about that last half of the taste with the overly sweet finish that ruined it for me."
"Overall all, floored, this beer needs to get out more as this almost blows the category up. Seriously one of the richest tasting and fullest beers I have ever run across, top notch."
"drinkability: high, seek this out"
"D - This is a standout beer."
"How the hell did Greg make this work? Massive amounts of hops, but balanced by the big malts and alch."
"The pour was nothing short of exceptional, maybe the best beer I have had in the Goose Island selection. Highly recommend it to anyone that can find it."
"Wow, a crazy smooth Imperial Stout stout that hides its alcohol content very well. No trace of booziness in this 11 percenter; just incredibly smooth, lush chocolate flavors with hops on display up front. The hops are more floral than piney or citrusy. The bitterness in the finish is assertive enough, but not overblown. Complex in the true sense of the word (in terms of beer), with a few different flavors mingling together that are hard to describe. I'm glad I had just a five-ounce sample of this silky smooth monster stout. Definitely something to seek out."
"D: very tasty, but the alcohol sticks out as i mentioned which makes this a little difficult to drink more than one of."
"D: This beer is worth murder."
"Drinkability - drink it where you can find it. Although I think I prefer the BCS, this is a treat that won't disappoint."
"I don't like this quite as much as BCS (which I identify as the quintessential dessert beer), but it's still really terrific. Not sure about those Darkness comparisons - I just had that down the street at Risque and Darkness was much more impressive in smell and taste. Still, it's nice to see GI shaking things up and not resting on their laurels."
"Taste is very nice. Some dark roasted malts, some very dark and ripe fruits, just a bit of tobacco. The hops are just behind the scenes holding everything together. This is an amazing beer. Very big and viscous in the mouthfeel. The beer coats the side of the glass after each and every sip. The alcohol is a bit more noticeable in the taste after it warms up a bit. Still an incredible sipper."
"(While I loved this beer on tap, drinking a bottle supplied by BlueOkie would lead me to mark down the total score into the 4.2 range; still good, but not as enthusiastic about the bottled product.)"
"Pours black with a dense and sticky brown head. This is Darkness light. Hell, I'd put this up against Darkness any day. This is a hoppy as hell imperial stout. Dank piny hops with plenty of roasty and chocolaty goodness in the nose. I'm going to punch this bitch if she blows her smoke my way again. Bam! Hops up side yo head!! Really robust roasted malt goodness. Full body with some prickly carbonation. Long dry finish. Wow. Fantastic beer."
"Huge, complex & satisfying. Well worth the price of admission."
"Have had this on tap a few times and fresh from the bottle (bottled 2.19.2010, consumed 3.3.2010) and it has been near perfect each time. An incredible offering from Goose Island, I much prefer this to Bourbon County Stout and I'm really glad I picked up a case!"
"I spent a good 45 minutes with this one and am very impressed with the unique hop flavors and the complexity over time."
"Overall: Simply awesome and a hearty thank you to Jory Hanson for bringing this barrel up to Milwaukee."
"Smooth. Dark. Pretty thick. Hopped up. Think about mixing black albert and darkness...pretty much the easiest way to explain if you have had those two."
"D: This is a wonderful beer. I often wondered what Bourbon County Stout would taste like without the barrel ageing. Well, I guess the folks at GI were reading my mind. This needs to be more available than a limited draft only release!"
