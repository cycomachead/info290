"Glass- Imperial Nonic"
""
"Side note: This would be a great beer to make beer batter fish and chips with."
""
""
"Can't fault it, quite simply outstanding. More simple than other imperial stouts I've enjoyed to this extent, but it just works."
"O – The aroma of this beer alone is exceptional, irresistible. The hop bitterness actually seems a bit out of balance, masking some very nice flavors from the malt and barrel.  Still, an outstanding imperial stout."
""

"Overall, this is honestly one of the best dark beers we’ve ever had.  At first, you’re a bit surprised at the aroma.  It is, no doubt, dark and brooding, but there isn’t much strength or punch to make you think anything incredible is hiding in the flavoring.  The sip absolutely obliterates this notion.  The level of roast is beyond most anything we can conjure up, leaving the drinker with this fiery, lingering bitterness of said grain.  Mixing in are swirls of smoke, taking things to the next level and beyond.  Through all of this the finish is incredibly smooth.  We certainly agree with the label that they don’t make ‘em much like this anymore.  The oak doesn’t do too much, but it doesn’t really need to.  For whatever reason we’ve sat on this bottle in our cellar for a while now, and only recently found time to give it the proper time it deserves.  We’re so glad we did, and have already put our feelers out for a replacement bottle, or five, to be consumed immediately."
"Overall:  This beer reminds me of that old snowblower we have all been using in Boston these past few weeks.  It stands the test of time and gets better with age.  Well, at this beer gets better with age.  Enjoyable now and enjoyable years from now."

"Overall:  Wow!  What a fantastic stout!  Awesomely delicious, with some seriously strong flavors of roasted malt, some coffee, dark chocolate, dark molasses, brown sugar, some oatmeal, vanilla, a touch of licorice and a touch of well-balanced hops at the finish.  Stout fans will LOVE this!"
""

""

"Impressively dark. Coffee, chocolate, some dark fruits. Full body, nicely balanced. Superb imperial stout!"

"It's kinda a new style on its own, a ""sticky strong dark ale", tasty, but needs to be handled with care. The 0.65l seems a bit too much to handle for just one person, unlike others with the same abv, but i'll manage."
""

"solid Imperial Stout, not as viscous as I would have expected but it wasn't too thin that made me want more. I can't wait to try older viscosity"
""
""

""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: a very nice imperial stout. nice balance between sweet syrupy adjuncts and a good strong and bitter burnt quality. certainly something I will go for again and something I may check out with some age on."

"Overall - incredibly tasty brew, certainly worth the purchase! I'll have again!"
"Not for beginners"
""
""
""
""
""
"o: An excellent Imperial stout, one of the best I've had.  Lots of flavor, silky yet substantial mouthfeel.  Highly sippable.  Of course it is difficult to say how aging affected this, but other than possibly muting the Imperial hop aspect, surely it did no harm."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  great barrel aged imperial stout.  Different, but tasty.  Will buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Too highly carbonated."
"The Verdict: Delicious. An imperial stout full of rich dark malt flavor, goes down very smooth despite the high ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours black as night with dark brown head.  Notes of dark bitter chocolate, burnt brown sugar, and dark coffee.  A very satisfying, full-bodied stout.  Could not pick up any oak, but the stout was fantastic anyways."
"Solid stout..been meaning to try this for a long time."
""
""
""
"O:  Good, but not incredible.  UCLABrewN84 put it right...this one is not quite a stout.  It has too much Belgian influence to label it a straight up RIS."
"Maybe this was more like a Smoked Porter? Regardless of the stylistic leanings of this beer, the booze was recessed enough that it wasn't that part to polish off this bomber. With a name like ""Old Viscosity", I was hoping that this would be jet black and trigger my olfactory senses from across the room. While not quite on the level, this was a sold Stout that nearly anyone could enjoy, especially with some biscotti or coffee cake. A bit thicker and bolder and this could have been something really special."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not a ton of barrel- might be good or bad depending on the person.  For me, this is a delicious Imperial Stout.  Sip on this while by the fire, or after a long day at the beach."
""
"Overall this is a serious brew that deserves respect!"
""
"Overall, this is a solid stout.  It is readily available and not pricey.  Would I drink this again?  With the price point and availability, there is a high probability I would drink this again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I have some mixed resolutions about this beer, I was expecting more but I am not disappointed. My overall impression is that this is more than a stout but not quite reaching the imperial stout level. It lacks that kick an imperial stout has but has more than a regular stout. It is a very well made beer, smooth, and for 10% ABV I got no alcohol on the nose or palate."
""

""
""
""
""
"This beer was ok, I was expecting more flavor and body. I thought it would have some sweetness and a fuller body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- absolutely loved the mouthfeel on this one, and it matched nicely with such a big stout"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very good example of a classic imperial stout. Big coffee and dark chocolate aroma and flavor. I've passed this one up dozens of times...I was wrong."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: recommended"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is pretty damned good. It's manly, but never over the top. Will sleep well tonight after I finish the bomber."
""
""
" One final note, these oaked and barrel aged stouts are meant to be drank at cellar temp not fridge temp. Took a little time for me to figure this out."

"A good beer to age - let the hops die down a bit."
""
""
"Overall - A solid RIS. Seems to be regularly available and reasonably priced. Not something that blew my mind, but still very above average for the style. Also good for those who don't like a whole lot of barrel presence."
""
"O: This is really nice sto...por...whatever it is (called a strong ale on the other site), it just lacks the finesse and cohesion to be world class. Still, a very solid dessert beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I feel like this beer suffered from being held too long, but is still a worthy candidate for your collection. Being my first experience with the brewery I will definitely pick up some other offerings."
""
"Overall: While the lack of pronounced aroma is a little disappointing, the absolutely brilliant appearance makes up: this beer is a work of art in the glass. A very satisfying Porter-like stout that presents boozy chocolate and coffee up front and finishes with long, sour bitter hops."
""
""
"O - This is a great looking beer with a wonderful, layered nose.  I was a bit disappointed with the taste, but only because it was not as complex as I was hoping.  There are no flaws here, but it is not as wonderful as the aromas led me to hope."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Though this beer says ale, it tastes more like a dry imperial stout. It just crumbles like a brownie that I almost wish I could dip it in milk, and yet it is so seductive with every poor, just like motor oil, which is oddly appealing. This is a fun and tasteful beer that will get you going."
""
""
""
""
"See KYgunner, no reason to state the same. I bought this cause it was on sale and BA rated it high. I only drink Stouts a few times a year. This one took me about 3/4 glass to get right Into it. I'm hooked, I am convinced this brewery knows beer! See if you can get your girlfriend to drink it?"

"For this of you who like a stout with lots of chocolate properties this is right up your alley."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a nice double stout. Excellent use of barrel aging. I was however disappointed with the mouthfeel. Though my expectations may have been tainted being I've had Older Viscosity a few times prior to trying Old Viscosity."
""
""
""
"O: This is a really good imperial stout. Hops are present, which is nice, though I prefer Older Viscosity."
""
""
""
"O: I was very excited for this one. The Old Viscosity is only my second Port Brewing beer and I'm not sure if there was an issue with this bottle. It was good, but I feel it didn't live up to the general consensus."
""
""
"My fucking God, I regret that it has taken me so long to try this beer! The appearance is brilliant, pitch black, dark brown creamy head that is lasting the whole way slight lacing retention. Smell is smokey and oily, dark fruits with bourbon/oak. Upon sipping I taste a mix of chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, bourbon; smoke and toffee on the roll around. Mouth feel very thick, not much carbonation. Good Lord almighty, try this beer. Immediately. Like right now. THIS IS NOT YOUR DAD'S 30 WEIGHT!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel - Creamy and rich, velvet would not be an understatement. First time having this beer and from the name and description I assumed it would actually be more ""viscous."" Still not disappointed by the texture, IMO it is superb - probably the finest thing about this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Old Viscosity is a delicious stout, easy as that. This thing is roasty and bold, but give it some time and it will reveal a whole new layer of scents and flavors. I probably will not see this beer again, except by serendipity, looking forward to that day!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I can't believe this is the first time I have had this beer.Pours a jet black except for just a hint of chocolate brown when held to the light,a large fluffy deep beige head atop.Smells like sweet alcohol and dark fruit over top of chocolate and roast.The roast plays a much bigger role on the palate,roasted and charred with caramel and alcohol dipped dark fruit on the palte,I have to say the alcohol lingers.This is an old school favorite and Iam glad to finally try it,it kicks ass."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good brew, but maybe not great. I expected a richer, thicker body with more deepness of flavor."

"Have a sweet one, my children."

"From my tasting notes: Wow, this was a big one! It pours like used motor oil, dark and thick with a large tan head. I let it sit and warm a bit and the aroma sent notes of sweet malts, vanilla and booze. The taste was like a huge barely wine brewed with loads of chocolate malts and notes of vanilla, dark chocolate, a bit of coffee, and booze. You can taste the oak barrel aging and it gives it some nice depth and a really smooth character. The Old Viscosity is a big and bold exceptional beer that is something really special."

"A great beer and essentially everything I expect from the spectacular Port Brewing outfit."
"Bottle from Let's Pour. Smells like roasted grain with a hint of cocoa coffee. Lighter on the palate than expected. A hop bite after some smokey roasted malt, bit of chocolate but more roast than anything else. Very flavorful. Probably best described as a porter. But has enough hop bite for the black ipa category. A good changeup from overly sweet stouts, though a bit more body would have been nice. Especially with a name like viscosity."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 8/7/2012. Pours pitch black color with a nice 1-2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, light char, toast, dark bread, toffee, light raisin, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, char, toast, dark bread, light raisin, toffee, and roasted earthiness. Moderate coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, char, toast, dark bread, light raisin, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors; with a good bitterness/sweetness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, chalky, and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent imperial stout. All around great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
"O - This is a great beer, I'm amazed at the head retention. It gets an A for taste, and and A+ for originality. It's truly good in completely it's own right. I'd encourage trying a few Imperial Stouts and a few Scotch Ales/Wee Heavies first, and then going on to this, because it bridges the gap between perfectly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Its warm closure is wrapped in a cocoon of malt sweetness just as the mind starts to think cookies n' cream. That vinous and fortified wine-like undertow is the perfect complement to its big sweetness and balanced char. Its an ideal stout when the sweet tooth needs dire satisfaction."
""
""
"Very nice stout here, I also love the BB version (Older Viscosity.)"
""
""
"Good stout with lots of roast and chocolate, finishes with a good amount bitterness."

"O - The first time I had it, it was more to the sweeter side, I could get the vanilla from the oak barrels, not that much but it was definitely present. This second time I think it is a little more to the bitter side. I don't know if the bottling date has something to do with this, The first bottle I had was bottled on 5/3/ 13 and this second bottle was bottled on 11/14/12. This is one of my favorite imperial stouts, I'm lucky I can get this any time I want."

"O: A must have RIS in my book... This is exactly the kind of brew I would choose to have friends try in hopes of expanding their choice of beer past the more common stuff that people usually go for. Proud to be a Californian right now."
""
"Overall - Wow, what in the bloody hell took me so long to try this one? First time I've had it and it's already shooting up my all-time favorite imperial stouts list. For the price, it's near unbeatable. I've had Impys twice the price that don't quite deliver the way this one does."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is exceptional in its uniqueness. Honestly i was a bit skeptical at first but dare i say im in love with this one. Kicking myself for not buying the older version as well. Will look forward to that one for next time."
""
"Overall: The complexity of this beer is wonderful. The alcohol is masked by the robustness of the ingredients. This is a hefty, heavy beer, and the taste becomes more and more interesting the deeper you are into the bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty great stout. Not the most amazing out there, but still very good. At 10% you don't taste any of the alcohol. I really didn't get any of the barrel aged notes you usually would, maybe because it's only partially aged. I would like to try it fresh to compare."

"Great brew. This beer is what it set out to be. Good serving size too. A bomber would wreck you. I'd like to lay a bottle or two down to see what his is like when it has mellowed a bit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The alcohol is well hidden in this beer and it is enjoyable but it unfortunately suffers in comparison to some of the others that were shared at this bottle share."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was so surprised at the characteristics of this beer. Didn't have the powerful darkness many aged stouts do, the oak characteristics stood very strong and crisp. A very complex and interesting brew. This beer is definitely worth cellaring for a while. I recently purchased an Older Viscosity and look forward to doing a side by side."
""
"This is a fantastic brew, in my mind is one of those ""burly"" imp stouts (although Port doesn't really identify this as that... or anything) that isn't overly sweet and has that burly dry roasted dark malt tinge. Well balanced with a delicious and complex profile-- I swear I get a now of toasted marshmallow in there.. Great beer, especially for the price"
""
"O: This beer isn't too difficult to drink considering its strength because for the most part the alcohol is well hidden from the taste."
""
""
"After reading reviews of this, I had fairly high hopes for this beer. Very disappointed to say the least. A very average beer, that had such an overwhelming bitter burnt coffee taste, that it basically masked all other flavors in it, including any signs of barrel aging. Maybe I just got a bad bottle, but when I split a bomber 3 ways, and still end up with about 3 ounces being poured out, it's a rather epic fail."

"O: Very good imperial stout with price considered.Nice and bitter with a fair amount of sweetness. Big and complex for the price."
""
""
""
""
""
"Just like the description on the bottle, pours dark motor oil brown, thick and viscous. Topped with a big fluffy, cream-colored head. Exceptional retention and splotchy lacing left behind on the glass. Roasted grain and malt, baker chocolate, big barley presence, all accented by toasted oak. Roasted dark chocolatey malt, some prune, perfectly balanced roasted grain, burnt raisins, and dried black cherry. Finishes with more roasty notes, bittering hops, and bitter unsweetened bakers chocolate. Full bodied, creamy and very smooth. Velvet on the palate. This is one exceptional brew and among the top tier of the style."
""
""
""
"49"
""
""
"This poured out as a nice beer black color with a tan head on top. The retention is pretty decent but not much lacing. The smell of the beer is oaky, roasted and semi-sweet. The taste of the beer has a subtle tart flavor from the oak. There is a balance sweet chocolate with roasted bitterness. The mouthfeel of the beer is pretty thick, it's a bit oily with a sharp carbonation to it. Overall this beer is pretty good all around. Worth having."
"Structured, good."
""
""
""
""
"O - glad I got to try this, but I think I'd only ever get it again on tap. It boasts that it's barrel aged and 10% ABV, but it's amazingly bland. Not bad, but nothing to write home about."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad stout but I expected it to be a bit heavier and a bit more mellow after some time in the basement. As it is it's just a decent example of the style. Very heavy on the oak. Can't complain, decent complexity and balance of flavors. Maybe I was just expecting more. Will have to try an Older Viscosity next..."
"O: Round and strongly built, this sturdy stout is smooth and complex but not overpowering. Port shoots for the moon and barely misses landing in the stars. This stout, although not amongst the greats, still deserves respect."
"O: Not a bad double stout but far from competitive with the top tier. I am glad I tried it but wish I had opened this shortly after purchase rather than waiting 15 months."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours pitch black, with a thick cappuccino-like head. Leaves great lacing. Smells of coffee & smoke with a light booziness. Tastes of dark chocolate and black coffee. the light booze aromas aren't present in the taste. Nicely balanced. Light bitter aftertaste. I could easily and gladly drink the whole bomber myself, but at 10%, I'm glad my wife wanted to split it with me! Definitely looking forward to having more in the future."
"The body was dark brown (27 SRM) in color, with ruby highlights when held against a light. The head was beige in color, with a craggy appearance and clumpy lace. The smell was dominated by cocoa powder, with a minor contribution by vanilla, and just a hint of toffee. The taste had coffee, maple syrup, vanilla, and burnt toast in it. The beer was quite astringent and drying in the finish, with lingering, warm, alcohol burn. The oak barrel aging was quite evident in the character of this beer. The fresh beer drank a little hot for my tastes, and would probably be better with some age on it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The aroma is great and the presentation is fantastic but the flavor is a bit much for my taste. Better the more you get into it, but I'm not a huge stout guy."
""
""
"O - this beer is just so great. Such an awesome beer. For the low price and low effort it takes to obtain this beer, the cost benefit analysis is up there with anything else you will find. Very very solid beer."
"D/O: At a glance this beer appears similar to contemporaries, such as Ballast Point Sea Monster stout, but on further examination it exhibits more nuance and refinement than is typical. It is more about balance than extremity; while no barrel qualities stand out, it seems resonable that blending was used just to take the edge off."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- i'm glad i picked this up. I usually pass on port brewing, but i've heard good things about this one and had to give it a shot. I love how well hidden the 10% abv is and only enhances the brew. That is a great sign of quality with this style, IMO. Awesome barrel, smoky, earthy aroma/flavor blend perfectly w/ dark chocolate. Fruit is ever present & there is a somewhat metallic acidic after taste that i've got from other BA stouts and can only think it comes from the barrel. Try this!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:loses any roasted coffee flavor as it warms and dark fruit comes out with an alcohol taste it's good but its not really my style of stout and the mouthfeel is weird and brings out the alcohol taste more"
""
""
"O: Very tasty. More barrel-aged character than I was expecting out of this. Recommended to be sure."
""
""
""
"O- Good beer. Bitter and dark as hell."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A very good stout that I will certainly buy again."
""
""
""
""

"Nearly jet black, one finger of tan head, with a bit of lace as well. Smell is quite roasty with a big dose of liquorice, dark chocolate and vanilla, oak comes across in a big way, bourbon? or some sort of whisky as well. Taste is roasty with lots of oak present, bourbon, vanilla, milk and bakers chocolate and even a small bit of coffee as well. Lightly carbonated, medium-full body with some thinner points, thought the mouthfeel could have been a bit bigger here. Solid stuff here, really enjoyable and something I would love to have again many times over."
""
"Drink- It was nice, just thought it would be a whole lot better. Thats okay. Always have older to fall back on if I want to go the Port stout route."
""
""
"Black with dark red at the edges. Light brown head with good lace and some retention. Nose of chocolate, oak, caramels, dark fruits are there but peripheral. Lots of chocolate in the flavour, light roast, sweet dark malts and molasses. Full bodied, smooth low carbonation. An excellent imperial stout, all qualities of this are well executed."
""
"Overall a pretty nice stout/old ale. Reminds me of Dragons Milk a bit. The barrel profiles are there but not overwhelming, letting the malts do the heavy lifting. It opens up quite a bit as it warms too so it was fun to follow the profile through the entire drink. I was surprised how dry and light the beer appeared, but it did sit heavier than it drinked."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes of molasses, chocolate and a hint of vanilla bourbon on the finish. The partial aging has surely helped soften the edges and take away some of the alcohol burn found in the nose. There's a bit of fruity espresso lingering as well, but this could be imagination. I doubt any coffee bean was actually used. I've always enjoyed barrel aged beers and this is no exception. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and as expected, viscous."
""
""
""
"Poured black with a light brown head and fine bubbles with great lacing. Nose; malty dark fruit aromas with a subtle hoppyness. Mouth; hoppy citrus with malty bitterness, fig, cherry, coffee and chocolate notes. The Finish; good rounded beer, there is a bitterness that helps tame the sweet undertones. Full bodied big beer, very enjoyable, more subtle flavors come out as out warms up."
""
""
"O: Very, very thin which takes away from the flavor. A bit weak, but not bad. Nothing about the flavor is bad, but the mouthfeel takes a lot away."
""
""
""
"O: Delicious, though not quite as full on stout as I expected. Their description seems to be accurate, as it feels a bit in between styles (but mostly stout)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown in color.   This is nice and malty strong ale but it lacks the roasted qualities I am looking for in a big stout.  It also is not quite thick enough to be considered a top-shelf double stout."
""
"Overall: Age seems to have mellowed this beer. It's good but i found it lacked a little something to push it over the top."
""
""
""
""
"O - It's not an ultra rare or hard to get beer. Clearly, it delivers as a solid imperial stout."
""
""
"Drinkability: Well mixed and very well pronounced flavors. Honestly I feel you could buy this in a bomber at $8 and age it yourself and in 1-2 years have older viscosity (twice the volume and half the price)."
""
""
"o - my first thought is that this is a highly hopped porter. enjoyable, but a bit of a chore to drink. nothing amazing here, but i'm glad i got to try it. would buy another bottle if i ever come across it again."

"Not giving a classic review. Just wanted to note to cigar smokers that old viscosity is the best beer that I have had to accompany a rich Maduro cigar. The big rich flavor and mouthfeel hold up well and do not get overwhelmed by an equally big rich cigar. I suggest buying a 22oz and share with a friend over cigars."

"O: According to BuckeyeNation, 20% bourbon barrel aged. I can see it, but suspect I would find Older Viscosity less rewarding, because the hoppiness and vitality of this particular beer really make for an excellent experience. An absolute steal for the price ($7.99) and highly recommended to any lover of stouts or excellently bitter-dark better."

"O= A little bit of a let down. The bourbon barrel isn't well represented and the flavors aren't filled with enough punch. It's not a total let down but it's a sub par imperial stout when compared to other imperial stouts."
""
""
"Overall: It's unfortunate for Old Viscosity that Older Viscosity is such a phenomenal beer because sometimes this gets overlooked. Old Viscosity is a fantastic beer, though, and one I should enjoy more often."
"A fine example of an imperial stout, well worth trying."
"O- LET THIS BEER WARM! It is best when warm. I can't believe this isn't made with coffee, it has some of the most coffee flavor I have ever had in a beer, even more than many of the most highly regarded coffee stouts. Great stuff."
""

"Taste disappoints. Boozy with dark fruits first, then strongly roasted malts dominate for some reason. Transition between flavors isn't smooth or logical. Oxidized. This isn't for me."

"Review from 12/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours pitch black. Virtually no carbonation with a thin film of tiny bubbles that disappears quickly. Aroma of dark and toasted malt. Taste follows aroma, dark and toasted malt, light smoke, chocolate and dark fruits. Thick bodied. Somewhat subdued; only a little oak flavor comes through. An understated, but pleasant and well integrated stout."
"O: Excellent beer overall. On par with Stone's RIS easily, though I'd love to do a side by side comparison. I would drink this again, and it would be great to age some of this."
"Poured from undated bomber to pint glass the beer arrives an opaque deep rich black with black edges and appears quite viscous. The head is a nice 2 finger mocha brown that actually lightens as it fades with superb retention and lacing. Looks great. The nose is roast dominated with tones of oak, vanilla, bourbon, and cream. You can smell the smooth character of the beer, if that makes sense. The flavor very much follows suit and is enjoyable. None of the characteristics are overpowering and actually work well together. Roast is most dominant with hints of vanilla, molasses, oak, and a kiss of bourbon. The beer finishes smooth and creamy with a lingering mild roast sweetness. Well carbonated and full bodied. Another great beer from Port. Highly recommended."

"Not bad, but won't get this one again. Its a competitive business."
"22 fl. Oz. bottle. Snifter glass. Enjoyed on dec´11. Ebony color. Beige, small bubbled, froth. Creamy crown with nice retention & collars on sides. Notes of cocoa & biscuit to the nose. Incredible smooth sensation in mouth. Bitterness is quickly substituted by toasted malts leaving such a sweet palate rounded by underliying ripe dark fruits. Full body, soft carbonation. Dry bitter finish followed by notes of aged brandy. High ABV profile is well balanced in this flavorful beer."
"Pours black with a three thumbs width thick, foamy mocha head and great lacing. A wonderful aroma of chocolate, vanilla, wood, roasted barley, and a shot of alcohol. Flavor starts off sweet with some chocolate cocoa, and liquorice alongside some oak, the roasted barley comes in strong mid stream, vanilla and some coffee closes things out. The alchohol does show itself, especially as it warms, leaving you feeling nice and warm after each sip. A wonderfully layered flavor. At best, a medium bodied to this. Feels more like a porter than a stout in consistency. Overall, a wonderful beer and worthy of the hype. Kinda feels like a tweener in style, a cross between a porter and stout and I say that in the most positive way. The high abv certainly makes it a sipper but the wonderful flavor followed by the inner warmth that follows makes for a ridiculously pleasant experience."
"Solid beer. Nice pour, a little on the carbonated side. Porter-esque appearance with nice lacing and mocha color. Very oaky nose with hints of caramel and a bit of booziness. The mouthfeel was a little thin, but very nice, bold espresso tones. Clean, vanilla finish. Very drinkable, but I think the ratings are a wee bit high. Would love to try Older Viscosity."
""
"O: A pretty incredible beer. It's a bit of a style bender, but an incredibly well done beer. The blending is genius, at it lends the lightest oak to the taste."
"Overall, glad to have had the opportunity to try this and look forward to testing the other bottle after its had some time maturing downstairs."
""
"Overall a dense, thick, dark oily stout, a real sipper. Well done."

"All in all, a pretty good beer, but falls short of being great. Good value at ~$7 a bomber."
"O: Pretty good beer, but a little boring."
"Fans of Imperial Stouts should try to find this beer. If you can't buy it, trade for it. From what I hear, it's not too hard to find and not terribly expensive. It's big, roasty, and complex. I'd buy this beer occasionally if it was available here. I also have a bottle of Older Viscosity. I look forward to the comparison."
"O: Seems like a well made RIS to me. Up there with the upper echelon of the RIS's that I've tried. A very well made beer and worthy of all the high praise I've heard of it."

"Overall - I liked it. The closest beer I can think of Fremont's bourbon barrel abominable ale (which is way better than this, but also costs 3 times more). I wish the alcohol was more hidden... too boozy for my liking."

"O: this is a top notch stout and one that is sure to please."

"Overall: I scored a bottle of this and I was happy I did, I want to hunt some more out and lay them down for some time. this is one of the first few brews I tried from port and I have to say I am very impressed."
"M: Full bodied. Good mouth coat but nicely carbonated."
"Overall: this is an excellent beer, even for the style. To me, most imperial stouts are flavorful but not highly drinkable, but this beer is both tasty and eminently approachable. Wonderful."

"Pours jet black with a light tan head. In the aroma, a mellow oak presence. In the taste, chocolate, whiskey, oak, and a peat like end.. A small bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry, small peat and oaky aftertaste. Oaky, peat, and quite super."

"This brew is incredibly complex and the flavors are all so incredibly well blended together. The touch of oak really does some good to this beer. An interesting and lovely brew."

"M - Full bodied and creamy all the way through. Great warming and mouth coating with a tasty/chewy aftertaste."

""
"O: A definite sipper, this bitter roasted treat is one of the thickest beers I have ever tried. The soft yeast that is used is quite nice and rounds out the mouthfeel."
""
"O - A very enjoyable beer. The medium mouthfeel works well here, showing that big flavored beers don't need to be heavy."
""
""
""
"It's a solid stout, as evidenced by my solid 4's across the board. Good in all aspects without particularly excelling in any. I'm glad I finally got around to trying this one that I've passed on so many times because of it's accessability."

"O: I'm really glad this is so readily available to me in Santa Cruz. Can't beat it for the $6.50 price tag."

"Poured out of a 22oz bomber into a 22oz glass. Head came up over the rim of the glass and held like a thick creamy foam. Great start! Roasty flavor slightly bitter little boozy bet this will be even more amazing as it warms up. I have to lean towards it fitting more into the RIS category. Great beer for a pretty good price point at Sherlocks in Marietta. Gonna have to try more stuff from Port Brewing."

"O: Really enjoyed this one; I'll be picking it up again in the future."

"Served in the DFH snifter, I shared this liquid gold with a new ""in Person"" trader, Morey (See below). The beer pours dark brown/black with an inch of a creamy tan head which stays around for a while. There’s also a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is sweet and malty, it smells like chocolate, molasses, roasted and burnt/charred malt, vanilla, and maybe some oak. The smell is actually kinda light, but enough to make out the wonderful character. The brew tastes like bittersweet chocolate, coffee, anise, vanilla, oak, molasses, and some burnt/charred malt. There’s also a nice roasty bitter finish. As it warms, the ABV presents it's self...In a good way. Mouth feel is medium/full, it’s nice and creamy and coating with good carbonation. 1 site says Imperial Stout, the other says American Strong Ale. I would definitely say.... Imperial Stout. Now to land the Older Viscosity."
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: This was an excellent beer, and I'm very grateful to have tried it. The boubon is there, but not as prominent as some of the other BA stouts that I've had lately."
"M: Creamy and coating. Not dry in the least."
"O- This beer exceeded expectations, definitely a character all It's own, a tad bit bitter for my taste but overall a nice brew."
"Overall an excellent product. Cheers."
""
""
""
"Overall this is one big tasting beer. Lots of complex flavors, big malt profile and a decent amount of hop presence all balance each other nicely. Alcohol is pretty well concealed in this one too."
"Overall - This was built up by the ranking but still very good. One of the few beers that is about equal to what the rating and publicity this gets. Now I want to try the Older."

"O- Quite flavourful and complex, overall nicely drinkable and warming, but apart from it's dense, bold mouthfeel (which was very nice, and i see why many would love this beer just for this simple reason) nothing really impressed me"
"Overall Impression- More oak? More body? More flavor? Im not sure what it is about this one but I enjoyed Older Viscosity A TON more... Still appreciated though. Thanks guys!"
""
"O: Price:delicious ratio is stellar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Not a bad beer but nothing special. I get more of a beer type of drink rather than an imperial stout. I do like how the chocolate seems to stay for a while long after the drink is gone."
""
"Overall, this was a great stout in it's own right. I think that the other stouts I have sampled tonight were above and beyond this one and maybe that is causing me to be harder on this beer but what can you do? This beer has no problem with slapping you across the face and making you call him daddy. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall, this beer was just as good to me as Older, but I can see how Older would have the greater appeal to the masses. I can appreciate it being slightly more bitter and easier to take in, and for what it's worth, the value of this beer for the price just kills Older. While I wish there was more of Older, this bomber at half the price of Older would be my way to go 9 times out of 10."

"Bottle. Pours a dark brown color with a nice 2 finger tan head. Good retention. Nice roast note in the nose with a sligth touch of the barrels. Medium mouthfeel. Nice lace. Dark roast, caramel, slight vanilla, and some dark fruit notes round out the flavor. Ends slightly dry with a slght lingering bitterness. Smooth and silky. Nice."

"O: A very good stout. It doesn't sate my sweet tooth like Alesmith's Speedway. It is dry, but in the best way. Dryness in some stouts I have tried seems to go hand in hand with a mute character. That is not so here. A beautiful beer with an intriguing palate of flavors."

""
"Overall: Solid beer, and I'm glad to have finally cracked it. I've got another one sitting in there from the same year, so I'll likely give it another shot in a year to see how it's developing. I would say that I definitely prefer the Older Viscosity to this beer, but I don't really have any complaints either. Definitely a sipper, a great beer for a cool winter evening."
"Overall - Kind of unenthused about this one to be honest. A little thin and nothing too dominant, very hop forward and not as thick as i like my imperial stouts. IMO not worth the price but always down to try new beer."
"O: This is a good tasting stout. My only real complaint is the lack of depth in the aroma. Luckily, it made up for it in the taste. I'm sure I'll revisit this one on occasion."

"O - Really enjoyed this! I'm a fan of the price as well! It's quite drinkable, although the lingering milk chocolate taste is a touch rich!"

" Overall I split this growler with a friend no problem. Very tastey and easy drinking. I would definately buy this again. A well made beer from Port brewing."
""
""
"Poured into a 20 oz giant Duvel tulip, very aggressive pour. Poured almost complety black, with a massive dark tan 5 inch head, that settles slowly, with tons of sticky lacing. Smell is bourbon, molasses, smoked chocolate, licorice, peat, and alcohol. Taste is all of that, but more dark chocolate and bourbon then then rest, that is a positive. Nice amount of body, wish it was larger. Carbonation was perfect and not overly dry, drinks fairly easily for a barrel aged 10% abv stout. This is a solid barrel aged stout for a great price, will always grab one when I see it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"With less alcohol, this could be really good. As it stands it was a letdown. Would drink again, but of the stouts I've tried this is lower mid-tier at best, better only than the disasters."
""
""
""
"A very nice beer, and not the traditional Imperial Stout. The oak is present but not dominant and both the nose and palate have a lot to offer."
""
""
"O - This was a huge disappointment, especially after loving Older Viscosity the two times I have tried it. Perhaps this one just needs more age on it."
""
""
"Overall - Very nice flavors, if a bit unrefined in certain aspects. It gets a little bitter as you drink it. Perhaps a touch more of the lighter malts would give this a hint of sweetness, some body, and even a dark fruit component that would really round it out."

"D - I had high expectations for this one and it definitely met those. Very drinkable, dangerous although you can definitely tell that it is 10%abv. I will definitely seek this one out again."
"This is an interesting beer. A really roasty stout with plenty of sweetness and it treads a line between dry and roasty and sweet and chocolatey. Overall, I quite like it."
"Not too bad. They over did the maple a bit in my opinion. Still a complex, desert-like treat."
"Feels lightly carbonated, full in body, and quite warming in the end."
"This is an exceptional old ale. Reallly, I wouldn't change a thing. Reviewing it as an American Double / Imperial Stout really does it a disservice."
"22 ounce bottle, bottled on 4/25/2011. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with an inch and a half frothy tan head which stays around for a while. There's also a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is sweet and malty, it smells like chocolate, molasses, roasted and burnt/charred malt, vanilla, and some oak and coffee. The brew tastes like bittersweet chocolate, coffee, anise, vanilla, oak, molasses, and some burnt/charred malt. There's also a nice roasty bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit creamy and coating with good carbonation. I liked this beer a lot. And at $7.99 a bomber, I'd buy this again the next time I see it. Definitely worth trying."
"For some reason the name ""old viscosity"" suggested to me a barleywine or old ale. I would describe this as more of an Imperial American Porter. Despite the thickness of the head, the mouthfeel of the brew itself is relatively thin (like porters commonly can be) -- oily, but not syrupy. Heady -- yup, all that gravity fermented out. According to portbrewing.com the gravity is 1.092 original and 1.014 final. That's a point ratio of over 6.5:1 -- depending on the desired style, most homebrewers would kill for that. (note that my bottle is labeled 10.0% ABV while the website reports 10.5% -- ymmv)."
"O- This is a solid RIS, nothing special or unique, I’m excited to try the Barrel Aged version of this beer."
"Pours black as night with a decent head that goes away quickly. Wonderful roasted malt dominates the aroma, it isn't an overly powerful beer in terms of the aroma, but what is there is very inviting. The taste is really great, has a wonderful flavor and i can barely taste a hint of oakiness, or atleast my brain wants to believe i can. Mouthfeel is full and robust, overall a very good beer."
"Verdict: I really enjoyed this stout, one of the best stouts out of California. It has all the qualities that make a stout great and balances them really well."
"Overall a very good imperial stout that I would like to have again."
"Medium mouthfeel and lighter in consistency that I would have expected. Overall, an excellent stout and one I would recommend."
"O/D-A pretty tasty stout. Good flavors. Definitely a sipper. Will take a while to kill. Once I get adjusted to the intensity of the flavor I like it more and more."
"Slainte. Here's tae ye!"
"O: I remember this beer being more malty when I had it off draft last. I liked that version, this one, not so much. Bitterness overpowers all other desired flavors."
"Packs a punch but you want to keep drinking it."
"O: Great beer. Love this one. Nice balance between roast, chocolate, oak, and coffee, if only there was bourbon...oh wait, that's Older Viscosity. Can't wait to pop that bottle!"
"Overall quite enjoyable but needs a food pairing to balance out. I dig it, pretty tasty as well, however the salt is a little jarring."
"Not one of my favorite Port offerings or favorite big stouts, though still decent, above average, and worth drinking."
"O - One of the better bottled stouts I've had since some of the better ""reserve"" brews like The Abyss, & Parabola. Definately gonna have to grab one or two for the road back to Vegas. Next on the list, Speedway Stout... Cheers!"
"Overall: Had this beer several times and I really enjoy it. Finaly got around to doing review of it. Picked this up on clearance for 6.99 at my local bottle shop what a steal of a price! Normally cost 10 bucks for the bomber. Its a nice stout for sure."
"overall this a very good imperial stout...really couldnt manage more than a glass or two..but worth persuing...."
"O: Plenty of chocoalte flavor to go around. Unfortunatley a little to bitter for my liking."
"A great imperial stout by any means, very tasty and flavorful. Worth picking up anytime."
"O: A good Imperial Stout for a year round release. Not expensive. Can't wait to get some age on one."
"Overall: The best word I can find to sum this one up is ""robust"". Lots of dark roasted malt, prominent hop bitterness, and some warming alcohol. I think this beer is decent enough, but not quite in the A-range for me. One tell-tale sign of this: it seemed like a never-ending, bottomless bottle of beer."
"Color is dark cola brown pouring from the bottle, dark brown—but not black—in the glass with a nice tan head that leaves lots of lacing. Cocoa, coffee, sweet dark roasted malt, and licorice in the nose. Lots of darkly caramelized sugar in the taste, though not overly sweet. There’s also some Brazil nut in there, I think. The mouthfeel is moussey in the middle and has a nice dry hit just before the finish which is very slightly sticky and lingers me-love-you-long-time."
"O: This is pretty good. I can't say I prefer it to some other oak aged stouts, but it's nonetheless a nice beer."
"O - The booze is not hidden enogh for me and the carbonation is a little high. There are better examples of this style."
"Overall dude I like this beer but it would be better with a born on date and age at least years = X on the label."
"Overall - I was very impressed. A delicious beer, even during the summer."
"Overall: I dont think flavor wise this is as good as its Older brother (no pun intended) But I think this is a very good a drinkable imperial stout. For the price I paid 4.99 for the 22oz bottle I dont think you can beat the value 10% alcohol for $4.99 I will buy this everytime I go back to the store I got it from."
"D: I'm not quite sure I would call this one an Imperial Stout. It has a unique flavor to it, hard to describe but it's different than a stout. Very roasted flavor with aggressive carbonation which is an interesting combination, kind of porter-ish, but a very good beer nonetheless."
"Pours black with three fingers of dark khaki foam. Excellent lacing and incredible head retention. Smells of cola, roasted malt, burnt sugar, and (if you really search) some vanilla in the background. Taste is more smokey malt, a little dry, rough oakiness, and burnt coffee. Bone dry. A burnt bitterness lingers for quite awhile, with noticeable alcohol presence. Medium body and relatively high carbonation for a stout, with a definite warming sensation from the alcohol. Overall, I was expecting this to be more of an Older Viscosity Lite, but instead what I got was an average stout. It would've been nice for a little more sweetness, chocolate, vanilla, etc. Maybe they should up the percentage of the blend which is barrel aged."
"Pours a very dark black with a medium brown head. Aroma of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts. Full bodied and rich flavor with most of the same characteristics listed above, including molasses and a touch of vanilla as well. Nice amount of hops on the finish to top things off. Very nice beer."
"2011 Vintage"
"O: Overall, the oak notes make this quite different from other Imperial Stouts but certainly make it interesting overall."
"Overall, a very good imp stout but not one of the ones that makes me think the US does it so much better than everywhere else."
"O- A really great brew. Nice warming alcohol, which I like in most of my stouts. Balanced decently. I would revisit."
"O - A nice beer with a great taste, actually very different from other stouts I've had. I enjoy the roast as it's not your typical coffee roast. The alcohol is actually getting hotter which is odd. Not bad, I had big hopes for this as I loved Older Viscosity."
"Overall is really good."
"O - Recommended...again if you're expecting a strong Ale, not an Imperial Stout. Solid bargain for $6.99"
"Bottle has been properly cellared since it was purchased 2 or 3 years ago. I should have tried it fresh. Either it aged very poorly, or it was always bad. Good carbonation and head, but a very strong metal aroma. Taste has some metal, the taste of brooklyn black chocolate stout plus too much bitterness. I was hoping for better."
"Even for only filling my glass to the 10 ounce mark, I unfortunately found this beer quite a chore to down. Perhaps it was because the night was winding down after I've already had a few but my mood nor taste buds were alive sip through swallow. I would revisit again with an open mind though any anticipation would be ill drawn."
"o - nicer on tap than the bottle. nice one."
"Typical imperial stout coloration: darkness with nice tan head; nice lacing present. Smell of roasted malts, chocolate. The taste follows the nose: roasty malts, chocolate, some coffee, a bit of hops of in the aftertaste. Light carbonation clings to your tongue with with a high-medium body that's nice but doesn't overpower. Overall, a solid imperial porter that doesn't disappoint."
"D/O: Overall a bit boozy, but still enjoyable. Would always drink this again but not necessarily seek out. Older Viscosity officially has my interest."
"O: Lovely beer! I find it very interesting that Port is so reasonable in the price category. They also produce Lost Abbey line of beers, so for a big beer like Old Viscosity, which is partially barrel aged, this price tag makes it seem silly to shell out big bucks for Lost Abbey beers. Hail Port Brewing! In closing, I would start to agree that this is not an Imperial Stout. It's something akin to an American Strong Ale, with similarities to a Belgian Strong Dark Ale (sans the yeast) and some similarities to a Stout. Buy often, but respect! It's a strong SOB."
"O - Drinkable. Maybe too drinkable-- I was expecting something more viscous, based on the marketing/label. But solid beer nevertheless."
"Overall -- This is by far the best Port Brewing beer I have had to date, I have found a lot of there stuff isn't all that palatable compared to other similar style and ABV beers, it seems as though they are doing too much to a beer and they usually get lost in translation. Def. worth trying out, decent price point for the %10 ABV."
"A decent after-dinner sipper, but not a worldbeater in that category. I'm a little let down, to be honest. After years of hearing how great this beer is, I guess I was expecting more from it."
"O- A really tasty beer, so many flavors are going on and just work incredibly well together. A fine showing from Port Brewing, I'm definitely going to be getting this beer again soon."
"Wow i cant believe im finally getting to sample this and on pour it does not dissapoint with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a two finger,milkshake looking tanned head and lacing everywhere beautiful looking,the smell is a mix of oak,tobacco,rum,dark bitter coffee and xmas pudding,it has a creamy,lucious,velvety well carbonated smooth mouthfeel and has tastes of liquorice,dark bitter coffee,bitter chocolate,dark fruits and is finished off with a port like warmness and on a cold night like tonight its truly appreciated definately one for sipping by the fire."
"Overall, this is a very tasty brew that has a great feel that is full of robust, sweet, dessert like flavors. Glad it's readily available."
"Poured into a blank snifter. Half inch head with a very slow diss. And lots of lacing. Aroma reveals full maltiness and lots of alchohol. Taste hits you with a burnt mellow oakiness and a very nice carmel yeast flavor. Color is dark but not black, lacing is a good cream color. This ale has a perfect amount of carbonation and with the malt bill it evens out nicely. Aftertaste leaves a strong carmel oak taste almost a nutty flavor. Overall i would buy this again, but im sure the older v is way way better!"
"QUITE GOOD, GET SOME!"
"O - My score says straight 4s... this is a good, but not great beer. I thoroughly enjoyed the bomber and had little trouble polishing it off over an hour or so. I would have this again, but it's not quite up there with the big boys. Maybe thats why they make Older Vis."
"O- Looked at this brew at least 10x before pulling the trigger tonight. Not disappointed. It's a crazy mix of a good RIS and an oatmeal stout with a pour of NightStalker. Can't think of another brew I've had that contains as many distinct and varied flavors."
"06-20-2012 Update - Rich, dark, thick-- everything a RIS should be. Not overly sweet, but full of malt. Not too bitter but nicely hopped with plenty of charred barley and burnt sugar. Some nice smoothness from the barrel aging. And at $6 a pint, a bargain."
"Poured as dark as dark can get, thicker than thick into my bruery tulip. Two finger head that dissipates into a half finger head that stays the whole drink thru, beautiful lacing, the best I've seen in a dark stout. Aroma is lighter than expected, coffee, light oak and vanilla. The taste is where this shines, intensified aroma with an amazing coffee finish. This is a thick and chewy beer with carbonation right where it should be. This beer rocks!"
"excellent stout -- a little rough around the edges but with a sweet gooey middle."
"The blending of old and young beer creates a perfect balance between the dry, tannic bite of the barrel and the caramel-malt sweetness of the style. I also think the addition of fresh beer (and relatively low ABV) adds to the creamy but not syrupy mouthfeel that I really enjoy."
"Pours a really deep motor oil. Nice two-finger off-white head. Lighter head than I expected. Solid lacing throughout. Aroma of mocha, sweet chocolate chips, molasses, hint of dark fruits and hops. Flavor is surprisingly light. Sweet creamy mocha flavor to start. Touch of bittering coffee and unsweetened chocolate follow. Some oak, cherry, vanilla and alcohol play 2nd fiddle down the stretch before a slightly hoppy and pine finish."
"Piced this one up while out in Cali for the Bruery Reserve Society Party . Big thanks goes out to womencantsail for shipping it to me. Served from bottle into a Green Man snifter. Poured pitch black with a one and a half finger light tan head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, sweet alcohol, cream, and dark fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. The thing that stood out most to me on this one was the booziness of it. The followthrough was a little harsh on this one with the alcohol notes. Despite this, the flavors present were quite nice. The aroma was quite weak in intensity though. Could see this one doing quite well sitting in a cellar for some time. Glad I got a chance to try it!"
"Overall- Very nice, rich, with age the little bitterness will calm down."
" As it warms even more flavors come out, really enjoyable beer."
"The aroma contains faint dark raisins and prunes with hints of vanilla. Licorice and roasted coffee. Some dark chocolate and caramel. The taste is upfront raisin and chocolate followed immediately with a bitter roasted coffee and burnt oak. earthy elements pounce throughout but don't overtake the roasted dominance. Some licorice and rum notes overtake things for a short while before herbal, earthy pine notes close the show with a hint of chocolate. Overall, a mediu bodied sipper. Lots of hps jump in at the end. Wood, oak, and pine...lots of tanin and floral resin comes in at then end."
"Taste was better when first opened. I noticed nice vanilla and chocolate. This went away and revealed a more bitter chocolate with oak. Lots of bitterness and less creamy than others. Mouth feel was a little dry. The body was not as thick as some others. This is still a nice flavored beer."
"Not really enough in this beer to make an overarching theme stand out. I just don't get a vibe for what this beer's all about. But this is all very meta, and for what it's worth it's a decent beer."
"Thanks to funkyaudio for this incredible extra! Poured from bomber into tulip glass. Pours dark brown to black with a 3-finger brown head that leaves tons of clumpy lacing and holds a good cap. Aroma is dark fruits, cocoa, coffee, toast, caramel, molasses, very good strength. Flavor is toasty, rich chocolate and cocoa, coffee, dark fruits, anise, molasses, toffee, caramel, dark bread, minimal alcohol. Moderate sweetness low bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to full, creamy, medium to sometimes prickly carbonation. ABV is dangerously masked well. Tough to classify, but is most reminiscent of an Imperial Stout met with an Old Ale style."
"Overall, I am very impressed. For it's strength and boldness, it's not too obtrusive. Granted, it's a sipper. The alcohol is noticeable and leaves a pleasant warmth behind. This is definitely worth seeking out, especially if aged for a few years."
"O: This is so mellow and delicious! It isn't quite GD Oak Aged Yeti but it is close."
"Overall this is a pretty good imperial stout. It looks great, smells and tastes pretty good. However the alcohol is a bit much and I think that this one needs some time in the cellar to round out its rough edges."
"Overall this is an outstanding stout, that can hang with any other barrel aged Stout out there. Sorry this goes in the same category as the Abyss. Pick this one up whenever you get the chance."
"Rich aroma has smoky tones of roast quality coffee, semi-sweet chocolate, caramel and molasses with just a touch of sweetness. It absolutely screams DRINK ME!!! Comes out of the bottle a nearly opaque reddish sable just a couple tomcat whiskers above black with a thick, fluffy, fine-bubbled light beige head. Flavor is - um, you sure this is an American Strong Ale and not a porter or stout? I LOVE stouts and porters, and this sure tastes like one! OK - mouth-filling flavor has tones of semi-sweet chocolate, quality coffee, caramel and licorice with a subtle hint of citrus. Texture is fizzy and lively, leaving behind a firm and pleasant tingle. This just might be Port Brewing’s best, outside of the Lost Abbey series!"
"This brew keeps all the pistons in its unique motor firing in unison, which makes for a smooth, yet interesting ride all the way."
"O - Really awesome beer and one that was thick enough to be a meal in itself. I really look forward to aging some of these and trying them again. Well done!"
"There's no doubt this suffered from being compared to the Older Viscosity, which was clearly superior. That seemed to take this brew, and put it all together into a coherent and delicious package. This one seemed thin and rather bland by comparison, despite its obvious heft and flavour. In any case, I certainly know which of these I prefer."
"D- This beer is well blended and is very thick and complex but some of the flavors are a bit odd together."
"O - probably just one glass before moving on to a different brew."
"Overall: I feel that this beer lives up to its expectations as a 'viscous' ale. Goes down like molasses. Also, much more drinkable as it warmed. Didn't pair with bleu cheeses like the barley wines, but that's ok. It worked well with swiss."
"Overall: This is one of my favorite ""inexpensive"" imperial stouts. The 10% ABV should allow for this beer to be aged for upwards of 4 years. With so many expensive Imperial stouts out there it's nice to know that one has a choice of aging three 22OZ Bombers at just over 20$. Money is not everything but who wouldn't love to have all Imperial stouts be this cheap?"
"O: I like it. A LOT. It's definitely one of the better Imperial Stouts I've had, and for the price it's I can't think of anything better. I am however looking forward to that bottle of Older in my fridge..."
"overall - fair stout would drink it but wouldn't order it , big ABV % is felt quickly"
"Mouthfeel is thick and chewy with a full bodied feel. Overall, a great beer but I'm not really sure about it's style. It looks like a stout but it is rather light on the robust roasted flavors, which leaves room for plenty of delicious caramel and fruity malt flavors to come through."
"O- A very good stout but not the best I have had. I thought it was a little, straight up and not as complex as I thought it would, not bad but not what I thought it would be. But in the end really good"
"O: A great oak aged RIS with a fantastic mouthfeel, but some flaws with the flavor keep this from being something really special."
"O: Overall very good. If the mouthfeel was smoothed out a bit.. creamier, this would rank much higher in my estimation."
"O- It was my first time with this little gem, and for the great price I think I'll grab another one Friday. The beer is a must try for any fan of imperial stouts and I think even the pickiest of drinkers will find little to complain about. It's a well done brew with loads of flavor and character."
"O- This is a great tasting Imperial Stout that I have been saving for awhile. This is a great example of the style and definitely one worth picking up."
"D: There is no alcohol presence like I thought there was in the taste. This is waaay too drinkable for 10%. This is a good example of a barrel aged beer that is not overdone. The aging adds a nice character instead of being over the top. I would love to try Older Viscosity now. Nice work Port."
"D - The bitterness slows you down a bit."
"Pours an opaque black with a HUGE 3 inch khaki head that fades to a small cap. The head is thick and craggy and leaves sticky globs of foam on the drink down. Smells of roasted dark malts, dark fruits, raisins, plums. Taste is same as the smell with nice roasty malt, dark fruits, and citrus zest hops. Mild bitterness in the mouth after each sip. Good level of carbonation with a thick and creamy mouthfeel. This is a very tasty beer, but I question the stout categorization. To me it seems like a mix of a stout and Belgian strong dark ale. Either way, it's very good."
"not picking up the 10% abv. overall, enjoyable to drink. I'll look to pick up some more bottles, thrown a few in the cellar to age."
"Drinkability is good. For the price, this one probably can't be beat!"
"the CPJ"
"D - I'm surprised I enjoyed this beer as much as I did, it's an unbalanced but flavorful stout with low alcohol involvement for it's high ABV making it a killer double as far as drinkability goes."
"The mouth is full and heavy. Carbonation adds a little bite to it, but this is short and fleeting. This is a way roasted beer. It's bordering on charred and harsh. There's a fleeting coffee flavor, but it's of the burnt variety. Vinous grapes, wine, oak, and alcohol wrap this up. Eh. It's alright, but my hopes were higher going into this. Call it hype, call it what you will, I was disappointed nonetheless."
"Drinkability is ok. Sometimes the oak flavor can be a bit much and the dry finish isn't exactly pleasant. There isn't much notice of the alcohol and the beer goes down fine but the most prominent aspects, the oak and the drying finish, can be too much at times."
"Very easy to sip this one, and it actually goes down faster than it probably should."
"Another very good brew from Port. I have yet to be disappointed with any of their offerings."
"Pours almost black with a hefty amount of tan colored head. The aroma is non descript but hints at a huge amount of malt flavor. There's a little taste of coffee. Very drinkable for being such a strong beer. As I plow through my glass I realize that this might be my favorite barleywine."
"D- Wow, its tough to give this a great rating on drinkability because I think the alcohol would catch up to you sooner rather than later. But, the flavor is nice and finishing the bomber isn't going to be a problem. Cheers!"
"Overall a very solid imperial stout from Port Brewing. Not the most complex of beers but it has a great mouthfeel and drinkability. Would definitely have it again."
"The initial smell of this beer is quite potent, especially with the smell of alcohol. There is a good amount of carbonation that is usually not high in darker beers. It is smokey rather than chocolatey with a delicious taste of burnt wood. It is a simple tasting beer that doesn't put your taste buds on a roller coaster ride. It is a fantastic, smooth, rich porter. This is a buy-again for sure."
"ABV limits drinkability, but regardless, its still very drinkable"
"D - I wouldn't want to drink more than one of these in a night. The first bottle was very drinkable though."
"T: Beastly. This is without a doubt the thickest beer I have ever come across. Taste starts with a slight dark fruit sweetness and then dives into the most bitter coffee I've ever tasted. This beer is crazy. I don't think I could take more than a glass of this one."
"Another fantastic brew from Port. Tough to classify, but is most reminiscent of an Imperial Stout."
"drinkability: Very smooth, not even close to ""motor oil""!"
"D: At 10%, it wasn't too... but since it is one of those go-to stouts for many on the West Coast, I've gotta say that if this were immediately available in the East, it would be one of my cold weather night brews."
"On tap at the University of Chicago pub. This poured a really nice black with a one finger tan head and some lacing up at the top. On the nose I got signs of bitterness to come in the taste that were really nice and non-astringent, perhaps some roasted malt and coffee, and cocoa underneath it all. In the mouth the cocoa kind of disappeared for me and it was mostly roasted malt with just a hint of smoke, all with a surprising medium body, tons of carbonation, and a bit of nice alcoholic heat that carried it all down. A strange brew, kind of all over the map. Will revisit later."
"drinkability: we had a rare sout party is this was one of the selectons. This was one of the better ones we had."
"Overall: This is a delicious and interesting barrel-aged stout. This beer would go for double the price from most other breweries."
"got this beer expecting greatness and it did well compared to my probably unreal expectations"
"Good but not exciting. I've had plenty of better imperial stouts, and for an oak-aged imperial stout, this just does not pass muster."
"OVERALL: Good stuff. Port makes a lot of good brews, and this is no exception. Lots of good flavors, a strong palate, and surprisingly drinkable and enjoyable for such a boozy stout. The alcohol was perhaps a little too present in the taste profile, but the rest of the beer was still able to shine through. One worth having again."
"D: This beer is very good, good bang for the buck and i definetly look for this when i can. At 10% the alcohol is hidden very well and is a great sipper on a cold winter night"
"The mouthfeel is nice and thick without being cloying. It suits the speed at which you should drink this BIG beer."
"D - The smoke and wood got old fast, but I keep on drinking this. The background flavors are really nice and are keeping me occupied."
" Medium bodied, low carbonation, and has a sweet aftertaste. This is a good stout, but not a great one. It feels like something is missing. Maybe some bitterness is needed to balance the sweetness. This does not feel creamy as I drink it. That is another problem."
"D - Like I said another is wanted because it is stong and well made really this is a good brew !!!!"
"Overall, a pretty decent imperial stout. There's just nothing about it that really makes it stand out from the pack."
"D-If you like stout and you haven't tried this one, you're missing out!"
"D- Definitely an easy drinker and great tasting brew from Port! Would love to have this one again!"
"very very dark brown to black. only light gets through at the edges. small tan head goes away fairly quickly. the smell is really nice rich roasted malts a hind of bourbon and vanilla. the taste is roasty and robust light on the bourbon and vanilla notes. the mouthfeel is very full and this beer is definitely drinkable, especially on a cold sleety day like today"
"This beer is really dark, like straight black coffee, with squid ink. Smells like dark toasted coffee and chocolate. On the initial taste, it's very roasty, almost burnt, but as you sip it some more you notice different layers and it grows on you; gets really good. A good sturdy and viscous beer. This booze is well hidden, does not feel like ten percent. What also makes this beer even better is that it's not that expensive for it's style and it's taste."
"D-I would like to drink this all night long, but the alcohol taste keeps me from doing so. I can enjoy a 22oz. bottle of this in one sitting, but probably not more than that. But then again, who drinks more than 22oz of a 10%ABV beer? All in all, this is a great beer to drink when you're thirsty for a good beer or want to share with friends, but definitely not a session beer..."
"medium bodied mouthfeel with medium carbonation. one will be enough for me tonight, but i am absolutely revisting this in the future."
"A beer to contemplate long and slow. Well worth trying. I recommend letting this cellar for a while to let some of the alcohol bite drop off. Still delicious now but can only improve."
"Did this convince you to give it a go? No?"
"Feels smooth. Very smooth. The 10 % alcohol is well hiddenin this very tasty stout. It peaks out on pccasion and could easily sneak up on you."
"Final thoughts: A very tasty beer that turns out to be more drinkable than I'd hope. I don't believe that it's only 10% (""only"" and ""10%"" may not belong in the same sentence). This beer got me surprisingly more drunk than I'd expected."
"A smooth and balanced stout. The flavors are not outrageous but they blend very well together. The oak is subtle and adds a hint of sourness. Perfect beer for somebody looking for body without being blasted with strong flavors."
"Overall I remember being more impressed with this beer from the bottle. I did pick up on coffee notes that I didn't find in the bottle version, though they did fade a bit as the beer warmed. A solid beer for the style and well worth a shot."
"The Hops and alcohol are a big part of this brew with the roasty malts and other flavors helping out in the background. A bold brew that should be sipped and savored."
"D - I don't know how I feel about this beer. It is a solid imperial stout, however, as previously mentioned, I feel like this could have been much more than it was. For some reason the flavors seemed a bit muted, but what was there was really good. I would gladly buy this again, but it isn't something I will necessarily seek out with going through too much trouble."
"DB- For what they make it out to be, it is a bit of a let down. All I keep going back to is the extremely dark cocoa."
"A great beer!"
"Black/dark brown with a beautiful rocky and rockin head. Dominating the aroma is big bourbon and heated alcohol, a little roast lurks behind like Krampus ready to throw the bad children into the river. Big and lusty, the bourbony taste slides down my throat easily, sexily. Vaguely sweet, but balanced by decent bitterness and assertive alcohol which thins this out just enough to be smooth and dangerous. Slight bit of oak astringency very complimentary. Only drinking half the bottle tonight..the rest shall be for tomorrow. And, yes, it will be fine. Glorious, even."
"Poured on-tap at the Port/Lost Abbey Brewery. The beer comes out jet black with no head. Slight blend of coffee and malt on the nose. Bitter coffee flavor balanced with a sweet spice (ginger?), and undertones of bittersweet chocolate. The beer has an increased carbonation, making it sharp in mouth and leading to a crisp aftertaste. The aftertaste is somewhat sour, which is surprising with all the sweet and bitter flavors. The bittersweet chocolate is also present in the aftertaste. Crisp, dry finish. Good stout to drink."
"Overall it's a very solid Imperial Stout, and enjoyable. Pricing was great this time, $4 for this serving. The Bombers in the store are also nicely priced."
"drinkability is there for style cause it is so good. split a bomber is perfect."
"D: This is a big stout, even though they call it an ""ale"". Tons of malt, ABV and flavor. Tremendous beer for the cost. It's a must drink & routinely."
"This is a nice sipper, good to keep warm on the night after the solstice. It is a big beer, but lacks the complexity to keep it interesting over the long haul."
"D: My favorite (and perhaps one of the best) readily available and well priced Imperial Stouts in my market. Old Viscocity is superior, in my mind, to Older Viscocity and is far more drinkable."
"This beer reminds me of Southern Tier's Jahva, only better in all respects. Also worth noting that it cost about $8, which is not bad for an imperial stout of this quality (that was apparently aged in oak barrels, though the influence of the oak is barely detectable). While it's guilty of my #1 beer pet peeve (smelling better than it tastes), it's nonetheless a roasty, satisfying treat for a long Winter night."
"D- I found this one pretty easy to drink. I'd go after this one again for sure."
"Cheers"
"Medium to full feel with a modest amout of carbonation there is no hiding the 10% alcohol here. Very bold and robust flavor of burnt grain. I found the citrus hops and yeast flavor to be the only distraction that was a bit unwelcomed."
"Pairing Old Viscosity with food is a little tricky, due to the intensity of the beer, there is a lot that it could easily overpower. Some safe options would be grilled and smoked meats, a strong blue cheese such as Roquefort, or a very rich chocolate dessert. But instead of trying to drink Old Viscosity alongside the food, why not incorporate it in? Pour it over vanilla ice cream or use it to make an amazing root beer float!"
"Served from 22oz bomber into pint glass. Fantastic strong ale."
"Pours a deep brow, almost black, creamy tan head very thin and recedes quickly, good carbonation, looks inviting. Smells of chocolate, coffee, caramel, maybe some toffee, definitely some vanilla/creamy, toasty flavors. Tastes of coffee, vanilla, some cream, roasted notes. It's full bodied moderate carbonation, solid finish. Very strong beer, yes it's drinkable, and would have again, not more than one in a night however."
"TASTE: gentle bourboness - no surprise considering this clocks in at 10% abv. - I was surprised, however, to find out that this is aged in oak, not bourbon, barrels -- I've never tasted so much bourbon on a beer that didn't see some time in used bourbon barrels; decent chocolate bitterness; some cement-like minerality. Really tasty stuff, but the 10% is dangerous. Also very good over vanilla ice cream."
"Overall, a really nice stout I enjoyed immensely more after letting ti settle and warm slightly. Really outstanding for its price actually. Recommended."
"D - A beer to contemplate long and slowly. Well worth trying."
"Heavy brew, but very tasty and a solid value for around six bucks a bomber! Nice flavor balance that's skewed slightly to the bitter side with a nice bourbon presence that's not overbearing."
"As an aside, one thing I've noticed (at least recently) is that west coast brewers are shying away from including a roasty base for their stouts. Of course, it doesn't apply to the old dogs (Stone, Alesmith etc), but the more recent stouts and porters have been sweeter - Black Tuesday, this, RR's (excellent) porter, GF's Silva... I wonder if that's a trend of some sort."
"Overall, Port Brewing has done very well with Old Viscosity. It's a very flavorful, enjoyable beer that, while not the advertised viscous beer that I had wished for, is still yet another strong offering from Port. Well done, yet again."
"I enjoyed this and would definitely seek it out again."
"D - 10% wow to much for my blood"
"Definitely a good, solid sipping beer."
"Porus pitch black with thin tan head. Some lacing down the glass. Smells of alcohol, vanilla, chocolate, with a lot of roasted malt. Some coffee comes through more in the flavour it seems, lots of bitter roast with some sweetness. Very smooth mouthfeel. Great beer and I can't wait to try the Older Viscosity I bought."
"i love ipas and dipas and maybe thats the reason i love this guy so much, its got a great bite on the tongue."
"D: I'm content with this one. The nuttiness is a tad odd but being the odd guy isn't something to be ashamed of. Interesting beer but it seems only distantly related to Older Viscosity."
"The mouthfeel isn't quite velvety, as there is a bit of prickliness on the tongue. Very good."
"Poured into a tulip. The pour is very dark brown with about a finger of dark mocha head that is very creamy looking and dissipates relatively quickly giving thin soapy lacing. The aroma is very roasty with a big front of bakers chocolate and undertones of dark fruits like dates and raisins. The finish is slightly alcoholic with dark coffee undertones. the taste kind of reverses the aroma a little bit with bitter coffee taking the forefront and a bit of dates and dark cherry flavor and a bit of chocolatey sweetness. The alcohol is very well hidden in this one, it's slightly hot, but really not bad at all. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth with ample carbonation. The drinkability is also really nice, especially given the style and the relatively high abv."
"Pours a deep, dark brown. Almost, but not quite, black and also not quite as motor oily as the label would lead you to believe. Pour produces a finger of tan colored head. Smell is roasty with lots of chocolate. Taste starts with lots of chocolate but not so much that it's overpowering, now I get what people are talking about when they refer to ""chocolate chip cookie"" flavors. Lots of roasted malts with some dark fruit notes. One big drawback was the fact that it tasted quite boozey; however, this seemed to go away as it warmed, or maybe I was just getting drunk, probably could have been either, or both. Full bodied but a little bit lighter than I had originally expected. Overall a good beer, but didn't quite live up to expectations for me."
"Some observations from the second pour: two & a half finger head (no doubt about carbonation); oak is more pronounced & is quite musty (not unlike some wild ales I've had)."
"This is a sipper, but a wonderful one. I was really impressed with this offering from port, and even with almost no carbonation in this bottle, it is a wonderful treat."
"Pours near black. Slight mocha head and a slight amount of lacing. The nose is loaded with coffee, chocolate, vanilla, roast, and a bit of anise. The taste i most coffee and chocolate alongside the roast, and the balance is great. Good feel with a nice body and alcohol level. Drinks very well and is another hit from Port."
"D-- Bigger than the listed 10%. Got the ABV pretty early on in this. It is a sipper and it is good. Not as good as like the Black Damnation series are but this is still and excellent beer. Could drink this all the time if at all possible. Yeah not Bourbon Barrel Aged but still got a smell of it and taste of it."
"The drinkability is amazing. Usually the stouts like this are a bit harder to put done, but this is a great one. It is a sipper, but its hard to put down. This was another great brew by Port Brewing Company. I will continue to seek out other brews from this brewery."
"Pours from a 22 ounce bottle the labelt won't specifiy what style of beer this is, but it's a big dark American ale aged on oak barrels. Pitch black body with tart tan head forms a fine even coated style lacing. Aroma offers up hints of dark fruit touch of vanilla/oak dark chocolate malt layers that's about it. Flavor brings on light cocoa flavored chocolate with over ripened fruit with oak barrel characteristics a bit of charred oak, cherry, vanilla really rounds out the dark ale with a bit of booze noted. Very nice drinking dark ale body isn't thick but it's full carbonation is mellow and it chugs along slowly on the palate flavor really stays on the tongue between sips. Really really drinkable compared to other versions of big dark oak aged ales, this one balances out everything out so nicely. Strong oak in the finish as it warms with equal strength coffee and chocolate, this is intense stuff."
"Drank this while watching Nevada choke against Hawaii. Was so drinkable. Sipper? Yes, but who says you can't sip and sip and sip for hours on end?"
"Highly recommended for impy stout fans"
"Pours a dark brown color that borders on black, with some decent sandy head. Smell is pretty good, with some caramel, vanilla, dark fruit, and some roasted malts. Taste follows with big malty sweetness, dark fruit, vanilla, booze, and some roast. Pretty tasty, I like it a lot. Big sticky chewy mouthfeel. Really nice. The sweetness cuts the drinkability just a hair, but this is a really enjoyable beer."
"D-It was definitely a sipper but I could sip on this for days on end, in fact I'm gonna go get another one."
"Taste was actually very different from the aroma. Has a nice hop punch, which rounds into notes of coffee, caramel, dark fruits, and some toasted grains. Delicious! Nice thick mouthfeel, which is to be expected from a brew with a name like this. Sticky, which is great because the flavors are excellent. A bit of prickly carbonation which works well with the brew."
"Despite the alcohol presence, this one drinks really easy thanks to the thinner body and smooth carbonation."
"Overall- a sipper for sure. This has a good taste and has given me the go ahead to spend a few extra bucks on the fully barrel aged Older."
"I first had this one (tap, cask and bottle) at the Pizza Port strong ale fest where it was introduced many years ago. It is every bit as good as I remembered. Black, with a decent little brown head. Aromas of roasted malt, oak, dark chocolate and booze. Similar to a stout on the palate (God, these guys make some good stouts), with roasted malts, vanilla and cream. An excellent beer."
"The complexity of the aftertaste seems to be my favorite aspect of this beer. A very worthy beer and a good drink even at 10%."
"D - A very tasty roasty, yet not over the top beer, lots of similarities to an imperial stout,yet has more intense alcohol and the wood is really the icing on the cake for me"
"Jet black coloring and pours with a think caramel-colored head. Kept a solid layer of foam on top as I drank the entire glass. Faint hints of coffee, bitter dark chocolate, but otherwise couldn't pick up a lot on the aroma front. Nice rich malt flavor - a touch of sweetness very nicely balanced by the hops. You feel the alcohol in the finish, but not in an overpowering or unpleasant way. Very thick, creamy mouth-feel, like its coating every surface inside your mouth. I'm pretty sure I'll still be tasting this when I wake up in the morning. For the style, this is incredibly well-balanced and drinkable, however I certainly wouldn't drink more than one bottle at a time."
"Pours inky black with a half finger hazelnut color head that fades to a ring around the glass. Aroma is a balance of delicate a strong. Figs, oak, vanilla, rich sweat malty bready notes, licorice and raw white oak/cedar. Rich malts, coffee, chocolate and vanilla flavors, oak and wood, with a GREAT balance of hops in the front of the palate as well as the bittering finish. Rich thick mouthfeel. Kinda high in booze to be all that drinkable. For me this beer is all about balance. I'm amazed that it can be so balanced and delicate and such a strong beer."
"Drinkability -- Wow. I've heard a lot of BA's put down this beer, but It's pretty damn solid. Lots of rich roast character; perfect if you like your morning toast black. The bourbon barrel influence is pretty minimal, tough it does add an extra layer that keeps things interesting. While I do enjoy this, I'm more exited about Older Viscosity."
"Again a pretty big yet enjoyable beer. I was reminded of Bell's Batch 9000 while sipping this just minus the licorice flavors. Excellent beer, I'd be happy to let this one get me in trouble and will look to have some in my fridge."
"Cheers..."
"I really need to do a side by side with this beer and Older Viscosity. This beer is more bitter and more coffee. No sweetness up front, falls flat on the front end of hte palate. Beer is reasonably enjoyable still but not like the barrel aged version. This is definitely a case in which the barrel process drastically improves a beer. Beer is medium in body and has a primary bitterness from the roasted malts. It comes across as coffeeish and leaves a lot of desire in the front half of the palate. I would, however, have this beer again, I think its a decent strong ale? WTF? Stout methinks."
"Drinkability - I really am enjoying this beer and could easily enjoy a night just drinking a bomber or two."
"d - Overall I thought this was a really good beer. I thought it smelled amazing and well balanced. Would have liked the taste to be a little sweeter, but still a great beer from Port. Would have again."
"Good-ass job, Port. This is a fine beer that I would never hesitate to purchase again. I'm sort of mad that I shared the bomber now."
"D: Finishes crisp, as if inhibiting the salivary glands. Damn nice! Although on sipping, the headache-ability of the beer is apparent... knock off 1.0 for that."
"Overall, a nice beer for a nice price."
"D- Really interesting beer; looks like a stout but the taste has a lot of things going on. Really nice, different beer."
"Visited the beer bistro in Toronto. Pours a dark black brown with a decent amount of head. Tastes very damn woody. Lots of oak flowing with the malty dark fruit taste this beer has to offer. Not difficult to drink at all as the alc % is well hidden. Definately more of a strong ale then stout. Good beer overall."
"D: Good now, but probably amazing after a few years. Gotta knock the drinkability down a bit for that, but will be keeping my eyes out for more bottles to age"
"Not sure how this registers as a strong ale, but none the less it is an excellent beer I am reviewing as a stout. Another win for Pizza Port...I like this brewery, and I recommend this beer."
"The beer is very nicely carbonated with a creamy finish. This was really enjoyable and I would definitely seek it out again. Another very solid offering from Tomme Arthur."
"D: As I have said in the past drinkability is relative to the drinker. That being said I could have another 22oz if I had one to drink."
"D - For a big beer this is pretty damn drinkable it has an awesome taste this beer is worth trying to find to try"
"This stuff is amazingly drinkable for 10% ABV. Tasty if not all that complex. Your standard, solid big stout. Isn't this a stout? I feel like my overall score should be higher but feel good about the individual scores. Good stuff, anyway."
"Cheers."
"This is a really well made and well integrated beer. Milk chocolate, bakers chocolate, a nice bitterness from the roast, a hint of smoke, rich and creamy, lush carbonation, slight lacto/milk stout quality to it, toffee, nice balance of sweet and bitter, hides the ABV really well, slight huskiness to it. Straddles the line between stout and old ale but who cares when it's this smooth and well made - a real winner."
"RESPECT"
"SECOND Time around and it is just tooo bitter. So bitter, that it lost a lot of its flavor. I would rate this 2011 (4,4,3,3,3). Just a big disapointment."
"I am once again very impressed by another Port beer."
"D - For the style, pretty good. it surely tastes great and finishes easy enough. You do feel the ABV and there is a bit of the alcohol burn as you drink. Not enough to take away from it being a great beer however."
"I love this beer, the depth of roast flavor is hard to beat and somehow, at 10%, with everything going on, this beer is pretty drinkable."
"Drink: I had no idea what to expect when I picked this up, it was just one of those random, 'Gee, that looks interesting,' buys. What a pick, I loved it. I'm inclined to go pick up a few more (especially @ $6.49 a bottle.)"
"Taste: Rich and thick dark malts up front that are neither too sweet nor too bitter. Pretty roasted but still smooth and has a chocolate edge and cleaner than you'd expect. Not too much carbonation.In the middle the wood comes through, slightly charred but more like fresh wood as hinted at by the nose. Towards the finish the flavors lightly sweeten and crescendo into that classic spicy, woody, slightly vanilla high note of good oak aged beers. The finish is molasses, booze, and a long lingering roastiness."
"D- The 10% ABV hides itself pretty well but I would consider this more of an RIS than a strong but that is just me. A good sipper though and I was glad to try this."
"D - Really smooth and dangerously easy to drink. The alcohol is well hidden, so this is a sipper to be sure. More please... but probably some other day."
"overall a solid beer and my first from the ""port"" label...thanks again Dan..."
"Poured at a recent BA tasting event side by side with Older Viscosity. We did this one first. Pours a dark brown with a small but respectable light tan head. Good carbonation. Nose is some vanilla with burnt malts, cocoa, and oak. Taste is more of the same with the combination of sweet and burnt malts dominating and the vanilla moving to the back, and a noticeable bitterness on the finish. Minimal alcohol for 10%. Mouthfeel seemed a bit thin but this was a pleasant and pretty complex beer."
"As an after dinner drink, off a snifter, it was an incredible end to a prime rib eye steak dinner. Not often a fan of a strong ale, but man, Port Brewing does this RIGHT and PROPER."
"D: really enjoyed this offering from port brewing without the carbonation issue. I've had this brew a couple of times and all have been pretty damn good."
"In all truth the beer isn't too terribly viscous, at least compared to a beer like North Coast's Old Stock. In fact, as the other reviewers have noted, as it warms up it really isn't viscous at all. Not that it is a bad thing, just not quite what I expected. All told, I like this beer. at least enough to pick it up if I can find a bomber of it for under $5."
"In the end, a nice ""stoutish"" strong ale with great flavor."
"True brown head, one finger, medium dissipation, leaves a thin layer of head on top of dark brown/black opaque body, no visible carbonation. Big chocolate hit in the nose, some coffee, floral hops, more of a stout profile than AStA. Taste replicates nose, very chocolate and coffee dominated, a wee bit of vanilla, a good slap of bitterness on the backend. Chewy mouthfeel, medium effervescence. At this ABV, beware. IMHO this is more of an Imperial Stout, and on that grounds, this is pretty good. This bottle is a bit over a year old and the alcohol has definitely mellowed out quite a bit, have two bottles stashed from same bottling to taste over the holidays. Recommended for Imperial Stout fans, for those looking for a Arrogant Bastard- like AStA experience, you may be a bit overwhelmed with the chocolate/coffee character. Quite tasty, in an Old Rasputin kind of way."
"Tastes of chocolate, toasty malts, good hits of alcohol and some hoppiness. Great mouthfeel chewy."
"Body seems a bit thin for the size and complexity. Good amount of carbonation. Some warmth from the alcohol but not overly boozy. Lots goin on here. Very enjoyable."
"Drinkability - Seriously? This is 10%? Great drinkability. I will buy this in the future if I see it. Not a bad price, not a bad beer."
"I've had this before and was unimpressed that time as well...this one was aged at least 8 months and that didn't do much for it. I agree with this being in the strong ale category...not quite a stout."
"D - Wow, I am drunk. This thing hits hard. It is delectable, but far from sessionable. If pressed I'd definitely say this is an RIS, but the Old XXX name made me think barley wine when I bought it. Regardless, it is good."
"Taste transcends many different styles. To me it's most similar to a stout. Very tasty. This is a strong ale that has definitely spent some time at the gym and done some cycles. Huge body, huge flavor. The 10 percent delivers a slight warming but is barley noticeable. This offering is right up there with some solids stouts I've had."
"D: Tastes a lot like an imperial stout. Huge flavor and beautiful presentation. The alcohol is present but hidden fairly well for being so high. A great sipper."
"D: For 10% this goes down really smooth, the harsh booziness doesn't really seem to detract but adds to the complexity."
"Chocolate is pretty standout, and alot of roasty notes, the two go together really great in this one. caramel malts seem to be lurking in here, and some burnt sugar. The oak is really subtle and perhaps adds a bit of vanilla alongside the caramel notes. There is some rather appropiate alcohol heat on the finish too. This was alot thinner then i was expecting honestly, i mean come on its called Old Viscosity, but its a medium-thin body beverage, with quite alot of fine tight carbination. This is enjoyable and the bomber is no problem, but i was expecting something a bit differant."
"Very sippable and very enjoyable. The mouthfeel enhances the drinkabilty, while the flavor continued to seduce the palate. For beer drinkers with a sweet tooth this beer is a must try!"
"Although Port doesn't seem to want to classify this as an Imperial Stout, it sure drinks like one. The flavor is very balanced and continues to be enjoyable throughout the whole bottle. The chocolate flavor and full bodied mouthfeel reminds me of chocolate milk at times."
"And yes, this is a sipping beer. The 10 percent is well hidden in the dark chaos, so watch your ass with this one. We have no idea what this beer is--motor oil? A Russian Imperial Stout? They call it a Strong Ale, so it's best just to agree and enjoy. Pairing could be futile. Just drop it into a snifter and share with friends."
"(D)- An interesting beer that is ridiculously full-bodied and potent. Could age for a long time considering how it currently tastes. In my opinion it needs tons of time to age in order to smooth out its edges. Not bad though."
"D: This is a complex beer, with a lot of flavors to take in at once. As such I prefer to slowly savor this one."
"Not impressed with this beer at all."
"D - A little bit more than a sipper... Sometimes it's hard to review to style, this being a primary case as it's sisted on Port's website as a hybrid between an Olde Ale, Barleywine, and Stout - Regardless of what style we're talking about, it's a damn fine brew... The 20% barrel aged component adds a wonderful depth and character to this offerings... A tad bit rough around the edges, but I would gladly welcome another so I could continue to enjoy and explore the complexities of this offering..."
"Overall this a pretty decent decent offering from Port, but it did fall a bit short of expectations. Nice flavor, but lacking a bit in complexity. Worth a look."
"This was not the first time I had this beer. I had it at The Publican restaurant in Chicago the first time, and remember thinking how magical this beer was. The second time was just as good as the first, and I feel I noticed even more robust flavors then I did the first time. This is definitely one of my favorite brews, and I look forward to purchasing it a few more times. Also, I agree with other reviews that this could probably be classified as an imperial stout, however who gives a s*** about style. THIS BEER IS AWESOME!!!"
"Had at Moan and Dove. Black appearance with chocolate brown head. Little lacing. Chocolate/cocoa aromas and a slight hint of almonds and burnt coffee were the dominant flavor of the drink. Great bitter taste, with a slight burnt hint. Creamy but light body. Overall, an enjoyable drink."
"Very good beer for a year round release and the pricepoint."
"Its extremely drinkable and speaking of drinking, i am missing out on on it by typing this review. Getting back to it, kthxbye."
"D: Not bad. A nice sipper! Im glad I bought it and checked it out. But probably wouldnt buy it again. Really looks and tatse like a stout to me!"
"Mouthfeel is full and creamy."
"D: quite delicious. This beer has been available in my local store for quite some time, but I finally purchased it since it went on sale. I have been missing out because I am really enjoying it. I'm not quite sure why this isn't an imperial stout though."
"D: Great beer, goes down easily, nicley blended. ABV kicks this out of being sessionable, but more than easy to enjoy a pint or two in an evening."
"I got this beer because I kept seeing it at a few places and I thought it was a stout. It is 10%. So I come on BA and I'm surprised to see it's categorized as an American Strong Ale. Now I'm a little confused. So I pour it into my pint glass and what do I see? An almost pitch black pour with a 1.5 finger head that dissipated mildly. The pour wasn't quite black, but a very very dark brown that could fool you for being black, but is not. So it gets me thinking this is a stout again. When I smell it, this beer is roasty and fruity! When I tasted it it had strong fruity esters that come along with alcohol heat, and it also contained a lot of toasty roasted malts too! This is what craft beer is about. Not taking to a certain style, but making your own beer! Mouthfeel is thick, but was carbonated higher than a stout, which the thickness should be compared to. This is definitely a sipper. I got through a bomber, but I couldn't have, nor want more than that."
"nice mouth feel and color, not as thick as I expected from the name. I would have given it a higher score, but there was a slight off-taste . Reminded me of a bad batch of homebrew I once made. I'll try it again though, as I think I might like this beer."
"Pours a deep dark brown almost black with a slight golden tan head that just lightly caps the beer and dissipates to crown. Smell is initially of alcohol with lots of dark fruits. Tastes of the same dark fruits and malts with alcohol not quite as present as in the smell. Feel is smooth and chewey with a very light carbonation. A good beverage with a complex smell and taste. Definitely drinkable and enjoyable."
"D - Too heavy to do tons of, but a nice sipper that is very enjoyable."
"D: I would definitely buy/drink this again."
"Drinkability:This is a good sipper just due to the fact that it is one of the heaviest beers I have ever had. I could have two. I like the oaky taste a lot. Very good."
"Not as impressive when compared to other beers brewed by port. It had the traditional unfiltered cloudy look to the beer. It was pitch black to be precise. When compared to Santa's Little Helper, this is not a stout but a very dark imperial ale. The smell was not that impressive. It was almost scentless. I reallly had to look for a scent. The taste was almost devoid of what black brews taste like. I tried to warm it up bu letting it sit and it did a little help. What I was looking for was a roasty flavor but it was not there. I think the bourbon barrels masked this away. Also there was not a wood texture that most barrel beers have. It was boozy, which was not evident, which was a plus. I just did not enjoy this when compared to other darkies. It was think but not like syrup yet it was a bit carbonated. I felt that it was a good mouthfeel. It was hard to drink. This is a unique dark ale that I would skip unless I found it on draft. It took a long time to drink because I was constantly hoping the warmer the better it would taste but it did not."
"Nice cold winter night brew. Not particularly drinkable, but neither is the style. Very good dark as hell, big roasty brew."
"D: Very drinkable for the style, but since it is so heavy I probably couldn't have a lot of them."
"Drinkability: Definitely couldn't drink more than one or two in a sitting, but a great beer."
"I didn't know what to make of this. Was it a good beer? Yes. Was it an ASA? No. I felt jipped here."
"Overall- very good. reminds me of northcoast old stock but with roast. could age well. gets better as it warms."
"D: it is a good beer, and hides the 10% abv well."
"The Old Viscosity pours a deep midnight black. A very pretty 2 finger frothy tan head with lots of lacing along the glass. Very good start with the pour. The nose is made up of sweet raisins with a solid background of malts and chocolate. As the beer warms, notes of plums and woody pines. Taste is a lot of roasted coffee and chocolate milk. Texture is quite creamy. Not too much sweetness to the taste but plenty of bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick and slippery. Drinkability is solid. A very enjoyable complex beer that is truly one of a kind."
"Found this one in my cellar. Pours out a deep black with a fluffy one inch tan head. For all the dark beer lovers, this is one good looking beer. Lots of roastiness, some coffee, some chocolate and oddly a hint of popcorn. A lot of character in the taste, roasted malts, chocolate, coffee some hop bitterness and some surprising sweetness that smoothes out the finish. Medium to full body that is creamy and velvety smooth. The alcohol is pretty well concealed making this dangerously drinkable for me. Overall this a nice complex beer with lots of big flavors that don't overwhelm the beer. This is one of my favorite brews."
"I don't normally give 5s in a category, but Old Viscosity and Ten Fidy will always get an exceptional rating for mouthfeel. I'm a stout guy who likes big, thick beers and Old Viscosity didn't disappoint. Smooth, creamy, thick...this bear coats your tongue and throat on the way down. Great drinking experience overall!"
"I see no real issue with drinkability here as long as 10% ABV doesn't scare you off. One bomber is plenty"
"D - While the flavors are very good, the alcohol would stop me from drinking more than one."
"Overall, this is a very good stout. Can't wait to try Older."
"Just as good as I remember. A very good Double/Imperial Stout."
"A: A finger of head on a hard pour which drops to reveal spots around the edge of the glass, pitch black with only a hint of light passing through the beer where it meets the top of the glass, as the name might imply this beer appears to have some body or better said some viscosity - 4.50, S: Intense coffee and ash aromas, some dark bitter cooking chocolate, the sweetness is subtle and reminds me of dates, the oak mentioned on the label is quite subdued - 4.25, T: The palate is very sweet while also having a dry charred grain flavor, high ABV is evident and provides a slight burn, the oak that I couldn't pick out on the nose is present on the tongue and provides some smoothness and vanilla, rum soaked raisins - 4.00, M: Borders on creamy - 4.00, D: I realize Port Brewing avoids categorizing the beer style and that seems appropriate given some of the various traits, I'll treat it as a Imperial Stout though it crosses over into barley wine in some respects, regardless it is a nice and drinkable beer that seems well suited to a cold winter night - 4.25"
"D- This is a slightly warming beer. The alcohol is noticeable. Its very nice though. Its 18 degrees here tonight."
"Pitch black beer with a touch of brown highlights and a small finger of off-white head that leaves subtle lacing. Looks solid, if not great. Nose is big roasted malt, dried fruit, alcohol, a touch of chocolate. Definitely a sweet, fruity nose. Body is bigger and roastier. Huge chocolate, dried fruit, light booziness, surprisingly quiet for the ABV. Feel is full and fairly thick - almost stoutish in heft. Overall, a really nice beer. Don't think I'll take my chances with the Older Viscosity, as this is enough for me, and I don't need to worry about the carbonation."
"Pours black with a beige head. The aroma is strong roasted malt and oak. The flavor is great, with coffee, oak and roasted malt. You also get some vanilla. Not much alcohol in the flavor but you do get some alcohol warming. You get a little bitterness at the very end. Very viscous beer and very smooth and creamy. Awesome beer."
"If one has ever had sorghum syrup (yummy on pancakes), there would be no mistaking what the brewmeister chose to fold into his Old Viscosity. This is an excellent sipping beer and an excellent use for sorghum syrup!"
"D: It packs a punch at 10%, but the booze does not really come through on the flavor. I had forgotten how much I enjoy this beer. A great offering from the folks at Port."
"4/4/4.5/4.5/3.5"
"D - The appearance, flavors and aromas were complex and enjoyable. I killed half the bottle just picking out nuances of different flavors that i was tasting. I became a bit bored with the lack of body in this beer. I felt it could have been much more if some body was left behind to support the good oak flavors but, it fell short for me. One bottle is enough especially when this one weighs in at 10%. If you are going to buy this one, mark the date you bought this one on each of your bottles (thats right, more then one bottle) and wait a couple years. I imagine this beer to come around in good time."
"D: For a bourbon barrell aged beer this is very drinkable."
"Overall this is a pretty darn good beer even with the identity confusion."
"D- Smooth, great flavor on the palate, not to dry, not strong booze taste. Great overall."
"Drinkabilty is good. For such a strong beer it wasnt too difficult to finish a bomber. Pretty good beer, slightly different version of a stout, prefer Older viscosity but this one is good too"
"I poured from a bomber into a snifter. This is pitch black, very much like used motor oil, with a 2 finger head, a bit of lacing. The aroma is a pleasant mix of chocolate and bourbon. The flavor follows, chocolate, hot alcohol, caramel, molasses. It has a creamy mouthfeel, full bodied, highly carbonated. This beer is an enjoyable sipper, that IMO should be an RIS but who cares it is a damn fine brew."
"The drinkability here is OK. I'm not the biggest fan of Old Viscosity because I just don't feel that it works well as a whole; the flavors don't seem to mesh well or form an integrated whole. I know a lot of people like it for that reason, or simply disagree with me, but that is how I feel about this one."
"D-Big and boozy. This beer, while not over the top with alcohol, doesn't hide it at all. Nice for when you come in from the cold."
"Rating drinkability of a brew like this brings the debate of definition to the forefront. Plus abv beers served in larger format, bomber in this case, are truly not meant for multiple consumption. This is a sipper with out a doubt which most certainly should be savored. Nursing this bottle through out the evening is no chore and is incredibly enjoyable. Outstanding brew with out question. Thank you to Spdkilz for providing this opportunity."
"Overall, I am very impressed with this beer. Super smooth with great bourbon/vanilla character. I highly recommend this and will be searching for Older Viscosity in the future."
"Old Viscosity has really broadened my American strong ale horizons. I will be investing in this one."
"Wish I could get this more often, might consider putting this on my perma-want list."
"But all in all, it is a very good brew for the price. I will be sure to get some of this more often"
"Overall, it reminded me of a RIS more than anything, and can stand up to almost any of the type. I'll definitely buy again."
"This is a good beer. I wish the alcohol and bitter chocolate was a litter more mellow. Something I am enjoying sipping on, and a beer worth trying. Though there are other impy stouts and strong ales that I enjoy better."
"4.5 D: Very good brew. I'm incredibly happy that I chose this one to bring back from Arizona. For how intense it is, it goes down extremely well."
"Thanks to my cousin, Brenton, for picking this up in Denver (at Mile High Wine & Spirits) and bringing it to me in Columbus."
"J"
"overall i enjoyed the beer - it has the dark malts of a doppelbock but adds the roast and bitter chocolate"
"Drinkablity: Tasty brew with intense flavor. A filling brew."
"Taste is very sharp but surprisingly not boozy at all. Lots of roasted dark malts and some earthy/raisin notes with a good sharp finish. Overall a pretty easy drinker for such a big beer."
"Thanks to MASPuros for this one. 22oz bomber served in a snifter. Poured a deep brown/black with a thin tan head. Big malt aroma with lots of chocolate. Some oxidation, but in a good, port-like way. There is a bit of alcohol in the aroma, but it doesn't really show in the flavor. Full bodied and rich. Flavor is more chocolate and roasted malt. Enough hop bitterness to balance it out. Long dry finish of coffee and chocolate malt. A great beer to sip on a cold night."
"Drinkability is too good. A sipper for sure but you can be forgiven for starting out on the session end of the scale. It just goes down that easy. You will slow down at some point or fall on your face. Either way this is a world class brew and one I will have to get more of in the future. No beer cellar is complete without a few of these on hand for special occasions."
"Drinkability: A tad too heavy to be very drinkable, and the emergence of the alcohol towards the end also hinders it. A really good beer though, and I would definitely have this again."
"The feel of this beer is only slightly heavier than expected but still a good hearty beer. Is easy drinking with not too much carbonation. Avery flavorful, good drinking beer."
"Thick sludgy roasted malt flavor that has an interesting spice character and a bit of a syrupy body that lingers into a bitter dry hoppy finish. Pretty hoppy as most of their beers are with hints of roasted coffee, chocolate maltiness, oatmeal toffee, licorice, spicy pepper, cough syrup, bitter hops and some alcohol warmth in the finish."
"If you can handle it, it goes down easy. But keep in mind its high ABV."
"Bomber. Pours black with a thick light brown head that dies rather quickly. Leaves decent lacing. Smells of dark roasted malt, dark fruits, and a bit of brown sugar. Loads of alcohol, which detract from it. Big roasty malt in the taste as well. Sweet, but the roastiness adds a bit of astringency. Heavy-handed with the hops. Molasses. Warming, alcoholic finish. Full body that is closer to syrupy than velvety. This one has a shit-ton of everything--too much, really--which makes it a bit disjointed."
"The beer foams a little too much on the palate, though it is nice and thick/chewy. it does leave your mouth watering for more, so points for that! drinkability is great. wish i would have picked up more when i had the chance."
"The bottle doesn't want to pigeonhole the beer by placing it under any name, but this very Imp. Stoutish. Deep black with a nice tan head, pretty substantial for a 10% abv beer. Malty, burnt chocolate, with some vanilla notes and a bit of espresso. Chewy texture, even a sip is a mouthful. And believe me, you want to sip. My first Pizza Port offering, and I enjoyed thoroughly."
"22oz bottle. Black with a lasting tan head. Aroma of chocolate, vanilla, wood, caramel, and coffee. The flavor is smooth dark chocolate and coffee with light caramel, some wood and vanilla. Almost no alcohol and medium sweetness. Full bodied but not very heavy for style. Much better than I remember and honestly ridiculously good. An imperial stout if I've ever seen one, and very nice."
"Mouthfeel is very thick and creamy with ample carbonation. A meal in itself. Not so drinkable, due to how ludicrously ""big"" it is and the high ABV. Very nice to sip, though."
"D - Drinkability is impressive. This one is a sipper, no doubt about that. High abv and big flavors make this one ""tough"" to drink. Oddly enough, that is actually a very nice compliment. This is a really special brew on all fronts. Put all the categories together and it catapults this one to a world-class status. Even though Port doesn't distribute to Ohio, this is a beer that I will have again. Oh yes, I will have it again."
"I'll buy this again, provided it remains the same price (I have no tolerance for price increases from a company with a history of so many QC fuckups) and develops none of the carbonation issues that have plagued everything else Port / Lost Abbey puts out."
"D: Penn St. won their game big and I won big with this gem! Pretty sure there's a picture of this brew next to ""big, thick beer"" in the dictionary, this a mighty drink not for the faint of heart. Reminded me more of a Double Stout than a Strong Ale, but there was a bit of IPA in there so I understand the confusion. You can count me as a Port Brewing fan and I'm sure a Hop 15 review is in the near future. Find and try this unique and extraordinary brew!"
"Whoa! This is a seriously good beer. Got the bottle at Sam's in Chi a few months ago. Poured with a great tan head and some lace. Color is an opaque brown. Aroma is earthy, caramel, toffee, chocolate, a bit of yeast and a hint a hops. Flavs are all a that and more. This is a divine product. I have been blessed. Finish is great. Body is excellent with fine carbonation. Almost a session beer in spite of its obvious power. Pat, Kevin, Rick, Tim, an Roger give it their stamp of approval. Hosanahs."
"D: Never had this fresh and I never will. This beer is excellent with a year on it. Not quite older good but damn close. Thanks to rustydiamond for this gem before it was available on the east coast."
"I may have violated an unofficial rule of beer reviewing by having a cigar with the beer, but I only lit up about halfway through. The cigar and the beer paired well, bringing out the tobacco notes in both."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle. Been down in the cellar for almost two years. Poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The ale appears an opaque black color with at least two fingers of creamy ecru foam. Nose and flavor consist of dark roasted grain, bittersweet and dark chocolates, some mocha, deeply caramelized malt, dried cherries, molasses, a touch of smokey char. The alcohol has ebbed nicely. Certainly full bodied and amply carbonated. A very tasty, rich sipper."
"Opaque and black-brown in color with a red-brown head that quickly dissipated. Aroma was complex including malt sweetness, smokiness, roasted malt, and a certain tanginess that did not seem to mesh well. Taste had a strong burnt flavor up front, a scotch-like flavor in the middle, and a dry finish with lingering notes of scotch. Alcohol was also present both in flavor and providing a warming sensation. The scotch flavor was more than I would like, although it seems to mellow a bit as it warms. Body of this brew was medium, smooth, with light carbonation. Overall an interesting experience, but given the strong scotch flavor and high ABV, I would not have more than one of these."
"Opinion: I really like the balance of this beer and it surprises me. I know what the stats are on this beer, but the flavor and mouthfeel are not indicative of this. I have analyzed a lot of beers, and I must say that this beer is somewhat of an anomaly...it doesn't come across like you would expect. I would certainly drink this beer again and recommend it."
"It's strong; I'm struggling through a 22 oz on my own. It's very tasty but very strong."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, I had become a bit disenchanted with the bigger darker beers out there but this beer has restored some of my faith, this is an excellent beer to drink for a whole evening."
"Thanks to AndrewK for the bottle."
"D: Very, very drinkable especially considering ABV. I wish this was more accessible to me...seek it out."
"D - This is a great tasting ale. I loved the coffee and cocoa flavors."
"Pours thick as mud, deep black with a super tight foamy brown head that laces thick down the glass. Smell is roasted coffee, sugarcane, malts, leather, vanilla, cream, nutmeg, chocolate, sprouts. Taste is chocolatey and syrupy. Mouthfeel lacks a tad because the woodiness of the oak is not very balanced and leaves a dry astringency on the palate. Drinkability is great for a beer of this size."
"Drinkability: An interesting brew, and a fine one at that. It comes together well on the whole, providing a well-rounded assortment of aromas, flavors, and sensations. I think giving this one a year or two to ""mellow out"" - allowing things to meld, become more subdued, intensify, breathe - would do this one a lot of good and make it an even more enjoyable beer than it was on this fine Thursday evening. Definitely worth a try, though be warned - the double-digit abv% makes itself known! And with that ... I'm off to bed."
"I didn't intend for this review to become a comparison between Old Viscosity and Older Viscosity, but that's how it turned out. They're both excellent elixirs from a world-class American craft brewery that any RIS lover should seek out. Given my love for bourbon, however, Older is clearly superior."
"It's a strong and heavy beer and that really affects mouthfeel and drinkability. Drinkable yes, eager for another - not so much."
"Rather easy to drink as I polished off a bomber rather quickly. An interesting take on the Strong Ale category, but a winner nonetheless. I am very anxious to find the Older Viscosity now to compare and contrast."
"A good beer, to be sure; a very good one even if price is considered, but definitely not one of my favorites. Give me a Stone IRS over this any day."
"Actually not as viscous or thick as the bottle had me hoping for but utterly satisfying nonetheless. Could be a RIS or a double stout but there are enough unusual things going on here to justify the style ambiguity. Whatever it is it left me wanting more."
"Drinkability: A whole bottle there's no way I could've finished myself, so I'm glad it was split between some other folks too. Overall I expected much more from this, and am a bit disappointed. But again, because it was split, it was easier to justify trying it. I would've drain-poured the rest of the bottle from being too cloying and kind of out-of-whack overall."
"I am SOO glad I was able to get another bottle of this. I searched this one out for quite a while and was disappointed with the initial offering: this second round was spectacular. I thoroughly enjoyed this one!"
"Bottle Pours a good black with a dark tan head. The head is creamy and lasting. Produces very good lacing. Has a great aroma of caramel, toffee, chocolate, and coffee. Has a good carbonation and a wonderful mouthfeel. The flavor is great. Aperfect mix of hops and malts. Has a thick texture. A real good finish and an aftertaste that stays with you for what feels like days. This is an awesome beer that I have come to expect from Port Brewing. Very well done."
"D- This is expertly crafted brew. This is very impressive. It really opens up the more it warms up. It is a sipper, but I enjoyed every bit of it."
"Poured a 22oz bomber into a perfect pint glass. Was black and vicous with a thin layer of head that lingers throughout the beer. Smells like burnt coffee, chocolate, vanilla and a slight raisiny fruitiness in the end. Some heat from the bourbon, but it's not unpleasant followed by bitter chocolate and roastiness. Bourbon is more pronounced as time goes by. Overall a solid brew that I could go back to again."
"I think 30W is an accurate description of this beer, just as it states on the label (40W SAE when hot). Unlike what sludges out of your dad's car, this is actually extremely drinkable. At first this seems like it's just another Russian Imperial Stout, but this is in its own class. It's more like a strong American Stout. Heavy in malts, high in alcohol, but the hops are hidden in the background. Plus, this one is a blend of a new Old Viscosity, and one that has been hanging around in bourbon barrels for a while. There's a good amount of complexity in this one, just as much as any RIS or Barleywine. Definitely one of the beer beers I have had. Recommended."
"D: I'll get through this bomber alright but not sure I'd go for another."
"D- good although it has kind of a metallic after taste which takes away from the drinkability"
"22oz. Rigorous pour reveals a near-black colored ale with a thin light brown head that dissipates quickly. Aromas are roasted malts, vanilla, and oak with hints of coffee and molasses - fairly boozy. Mouth-feel is thinner than expected with low carbonation. Tastes are of bold roasted malts, oak, vanilla, with hints of brown sugar and maybe some faint chocolate notes. Alcohol is present but not overwhelming - though warms nicely. Nice bitter hop finish to help with the balance of the up-front maltiness. Overall, very solid ale. Oak aging this one was key here. Recommendable, but probably wouldn't get it again."
"This stout, ON TAP, can give any of the ""big player, prestigious stouts"" a run for their money."
"This is a big chewy beer that has a sweet chocolate aftertaste and goes down mighty easy but doesn't necessarily drink fast. Port makes some great beers and this is no exception."
"Definite sipper in my book."
"- Warm, but super drinkable.... a great brew or bomber to share with a friend to end a day.. just the right carbonation, and goes down smooth and warm... a very comforting Ale. I am seriously impressed."
"This is classified as a strong ale, but could be called an imperial stout. I didn't get a lot of complexity, mostly straight forward dark chocolate and hops, but still worth a try."
"Very dense two finger plus head, deep brown in color and mostly micro-froth with a few small real bubbles interspersed here and there, lacing slides down the glass easily. Entirely, impenetrably opaque, looks more like dark, dark, dark brown than black, no hue changes around the rims. In the nose you primarily get mixed dark and milk chocolate, coffee ice cream, candied cherry, plum, date, chocolate covered raisin scents, when swirled it releases more bitter pink grapefruit and chicory notes, so thick and alcoholic that these fall back quickly into the mix. Full-bodied, has a creamy and strongly carbonated mouth feel which relieves a good deal of heaviness. The chicory, wood smoke bitterness more obvious here, the grapefruit element less so. There's a drier complexion to the chocolate, coffee bits, hence no real caramel undertones. The plum, raisin, date, cherry, fig fruit shines best towards the finish. Quite flavorful, however, too overwhelming to really enjoy more than a glass or so."
"D = This is definitely a sipper, but each sip does make you want another."
"A very well made sipper."
"D: This beer does have some weight to it and you can really feel that in the stomach. Still its nice and great sipping brew. All around this beer is really nice and I can only imagine what the Older V has to offer here. The flavors and aromas are nice and they absolutely meld together beautifully. I could see it getting dangerous if I had these brews on my bottle shops shelves. Great brew."
"Tastes surprisingly tame. Complex, and still pretty strong, but tamer than the aroma and ABV had led me to anticipate. Lots of wood complexities, alcohol, fiery yeast, dark roasted porter malt."
"This one pours a dark brown, with minimal tan head. I poured pretty hard, but it wouldn't foam up much. A nice aroma of chocolate, coffee, licorice. Taste was along the same lines, but didn't quite live up to the aroma--just not that intense. Good, but basically a middle of the road porter. Mouthfeel could have used some more carbonation, which was a bit low. A drinkable beer, enjoyable, but there is room for improvement."
"I know Strong Ales are a catchall, but this is got to be stylistically more like a stout."
"Overall impression: Really nice sipper. I'd love to throw a few of these in the cellar to see how they'd age."
"Thanks go to pwoods for gifting me this one in exchange for working on his POS/tank computer... Just kidding, Patrick... :)"
"D: Okay drinkability. The heavy and deep flavors of this beer make it hard to drink more than one, not to mention its high ABV."
"Port's crafted one kick ass beer with Old Viscosity. To be honest, I was expecting it to be good, but not this good. It's actually better than the final score will suggest. The flavor's not perfect, but it's a little better than a ""4.5."" Tenths of points, anyone? Ultimately, I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and now question how much better Older Viscosity can really be. I'm anxious to dig into that bottle to find out. Very impressive stuff here. Highly recommended."
"This beer poured out a very dark black. It was slightly lighter at the edges and had a small tan head. The aroma was great. It had a huge roasted malt smell and great bourbon notes. The taste was of bourbon, roasted malts, vanilla, and warming alcohol at the end. It was smooth, creamy, and medium/full bodied. This is a great beer to sip on."
"Pours black as night into my Dogfish Head snifter with a small amount of tan head that quickly vanishes leaving small bubbles in it's place. Smell is of toasted nuts, dark chocolate, coffee, and hiding behind all that is slight bourbon. Tastes very rich, dark chocolate, coffee, and alcohol on the finish. Mouthfeel is think and carbonated...maybe even too carbonated for my tastes (although I've read other review which have little/no carbonation...this was much different). The ABV really kicks in and I don't know how many of these I could drink before I pass out. Good, but probably a once in a while beer for me."
"Trader's Note: Thanks to RodBurg for hooking me up with this fine elixir from Cali!"
"Smooth, and would be very drinkable if not for the alcohol bite. Regardless, a nice beer - solid in all respects, if not outstanding."
"Delicious!!"
"M&T - a smooth liquid, not for all palates, a decent alcohol bite will put off some, however and enjoyable beer to most BA's, full of flavor, complex and layered"
"A great beer at a good price point ($6.50). This is one that I frequently pick up a beer run and I always mean to age it, but I somehow always end up drinking it soon after purchasing."
"-Dotson"
"Drinkability: Low when cold. This fucker's huge, and doesn't have enough sweetness to hide its 10% abv very well. I let it hang out for a few minutes to warm a bit and holy fuck it's smooth. This bitch is black as night, but I could probably finish two bombers before I regretted it the next morning."
"Drinkability is high. Port is easily one of my favorite breweries, and this is top notch. Can't wait to try an Older Viscosity!"
"Drinkability - This one just goes way to overboard with the hops. I like a bit of bitterness, bit this one seems way to one sided. I think i'll go back to the port IPA's to remind me of their brilliance"
"As for taste, there is a lot to like. Dark chocolates coat some cherry and the oak lends a vinous quality that blends nicely with the bittering hops, some booze, its all quite nice. Also, as I learned just now, the alcohol sneaks up on you, masked quite well. Mouth is full, smooth, carbonation light. In all, yum. Yum yum yum."
"Easy to drink and one I will seek out from my west coast friends again."
"D- This is a nice strong ale/hybrid. My 1st Port brew that isn't an IPA. This makes me really want to age on of these...or to find older viscosity. Very good and well done. It's hot...but not too hot."
"Big and boozey, Old Viscosity lives up to it's name...but who wants to drink motor oil?"
"Overall, a good but not great beer for me. Again, the bourbon aspect hurts it but if you like that in your beer than this one might be good for you. For me, once is enough but glad I tried it."
"Very much a sipper. The 20% addition of the bourbon aged version adds layers of flavor and complexity to this beer that are worth savoring."
"This is a big beer with rich full flavors that are well matched. Plenty of complexity to keep things interesting. Somewhere between a stout and a barleywine, along with a woody Olde Ale aspect as well. This is a must try for the adventurous."
"It's just not very good. Not terrible, but not great. A rather classic example of a beer not meeting expectations. As milwaukeeclassic explains, ""even after a vigorous pour, this beer provides far less head than my wife."" Well said sir. Mouthfeel is a weak spot, but milwaukee's wife coulda told you so as well."
"Very drinkable for such and extreme sipping style beer, this beer will be finding a spot in my fridge and cellar."
"Nicely done, would like to try the Older Viscosity for comparison."
"To make it better I'd think about cutting the sweetness a little - with bittering hops, with more carbonation, with a lower mash temp - whatever. Adding in a bit of head and head retention would be nice. And toning down the smoke flavor and you're all set. Why, make me that beer and I'd think about giving it 5s all the way across!"
"22 oz. bottle with no freshness date. Brewed with two-row, wheat, crystal, chocolate and Carafa III, hopped with Magnum, fermented with WLP001 and their house strain; 80% stainless-aged, 20% bourbon barrel-aged. It pours into the snifter almost inky black, a little thin at the edges, with an inch of cappuccino head that reduces to a tiny collar and leaves little lacing. The aroma starts with vanilla, chocolate and hints of alcohol, with caramel, a late fruitiness, and some slowly-emerging green hops. It smells more like bourbon the more I drink. The flavor is incredibly complex, with chocolate and dark/charred malts, caramel, peppery/spicy alcohol, vanilla and black cherry. There is an astringency, a light sourness and a definite bourbon note. Very nice. It is thick on the palate, with a light tingle, coating dark malts, a tannin-like dryness, and warming alcohol. Silky-smooth by the end, with a long bourbon/hop finish. A delicious barrel-aged ale that comes across very much like an imperial stout with an old ale kicker. A wonderful beer that is a constant sipper; well-worth seeking out."
"D: Surprisingly good considereing the abv. I was slightly underwhelmed by this considering the rep Old Viscosity has."
"Notes: Excellent brew. The Double Bastard comparison kept coming back to me, and I think this is basically a darker, more indentifiable version of an ASA. A cross between an Imperial Stout and a Porter. This might be what Guinness was brewing way back in the day to ship to the islands. Call it American Foreign Extra Stout. Whatever you call it, it's damn good."
"This beer pours very dark with little to no head and minimal lacing. The smell is big of roasted malts and nuts. The flavor has a big malt flavor in it, almost tasted like an imerial Oatmeal Stout, there is still some alcohol flavor, so a little cellaring would do this beer good and there is also some nice nutty flavors. The mouthfeel is nice and the carbonation level is a little low. For 10% this is pretty drinkable even with the alcohol flavor, the big malt base covers it well, but as stated I would suggest some cellaring for this beer to optimize the flavors."
"Overall - A pretty good brew although not quite as good as i was expecting... well worth a try though"
" My 1st try at this left good results and will get this in the future. I would of liked more burbon but i'm going to try the older version as well. This is styled as a american strong ale and apparently a category for this beer is not finalized. Port Brewing, What's the big secret??"
"A very good brew."
"It's good, but I don't really think it stood out to me. I wonder if the regionality of this inflated scores before distribution increased? As an imperial stout, there are plenty of others that are more common I'd choose first."
"Pours a formal shoe leather black with brownie highlights. Super dark, can't see any bubbles if they are there. No head or bubbling. Cocoa, brown sugar, morning blend coffee, cloves, tabacco and wheat in the nose. WOW!!! Take all the aroms you picked up and add sme vanilla bourbon flavors, some oak, and well integrated alcohol. Very smooth, brandy-ish sipping beer. Exquisite warming bourbon palate with a big splash of drywall. Very interesting and tasty brew."
"D- Overall...I like this beer as a sipper. Definetly not an every day guy. Good flavors and well put together, just know the heat is on though."
"Very much a sipper, but the bourbon influence and chocolate notes makes this such a pleasure."
"Looking at the bottle, reading the label and some of these reviews, I would have assumed a sipper. This didn't happen. The lighter than expected mouthfeel and smoothness allowed for the bomber to be emptied quite easily. Very drinkable, if only this brew was allowed in good old MD...."
"Very light in feel and flavors, but I don't know how to describe this one, I'd say its closest to a doppelbock. Caramel, bourbon. Slight oak flavor. Dry from coffee and roasted malts give it some porter characteristics. A little smoky. A little crunchy. This one seemed more like a hybrid of style above all else. Definitely a good one to try but not a beer thats keeping me wanting more."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber and served in a snifter. This beer poured a dark brown with a few mahogany highlights and a thin, whispy tan head that hung around for a bit. A ton of spotty lacing was left behind...some clingy, some slippery. The aroma included heavy bittersweet chocolate, thick caramel, coffee grounds, and a hint of dark, pited fruits lingering in the background. The flavor was moderately roasty and bitter...lots of chocolate and coffee coming through. Just a hint of dark fruits macerated in alcohol. A nice, quick hop bite finishes things up. The mouthfeel was full-bodied and had minimal carbonation. Great drinkability for the ABV. Rich and full of complexities, some subtle, some...not so much. Anyways, this was delicious."
"Not a sipper, but not a session either. Lacks body. A good beer, but not as good as I hoped."
"impressive drinkability for such a big beer. goes down quite easy for such a big beer and a lot easier than some beers under the 10% barrier. well done port brewing."
"Almost lives up to it's hype."
"I wasn't too impressed with this beer. I know it was going to be a strong ale but the alcohol was too overpowering. The malt flavor is very strong with hints of coffee/espresso on the back. I think this is more of a stout than a strong ale but it's not quite there. This is a nice beer to drink when you want lots of flavor and high abv but it's just an ok beer."
"Port Brewing has blown me away with some of their beers, but I'm afraid this isn't one of them."
"This is a standout beer."
"Overall: Very impressed...after trying Older Viscosity and being a bit disappointed, I was a little hesitant about trying this beer out....but I'm glad I did. One of the best beers I have had the pleasure of enjoying and a must try! Cheers!"
"Sip, savor and share due to strength, but tasty and easy for me to drink. Alcohol is well hidden."
"Poured a deep black with a thin white head. Nose is of dark fruits, oak, vanilla and chocolate, relatively faint. Taste is cocoa, oakiness, roasted malts and hints of vanilla. Mouthfeel was good but not that creamy. Good brew but I enjoyed the bottle version much better."
"D-For 10%, this is very drinkable. I could definitely have 1 or 2 more of these. Really enjoyed drinking and can't wait to get my hands on more brews from Port."
"I personally wasn't a big fan of this beer, and wouldn't be reach for it very often. The alcohol and bourbon overtook most of the other flavors and the complexity of this beer didn't shine through as well as it should have. I am curious if some age on this beer would mellow out those flavors a little bit, and then I think this beer would be a real winner. I tend to vary more on the side of balance when it comes to bourbon barrel aged beers."
"It tastes chalky, tarry, dark, bitter, sweet, smokey, and molassesy all at the same time. There's a lot going on here."
"Opaque black beer with a small tan head. Not much Belgian lace. Roasted black malt aroma and somewhat sweet smelling. Flavor was that of a warm high alcohol American Imperial Stout should be. Rich, chocolate and coffeelike. Nice hop balance. Very smooth and easy drinking but definently a sipping beer."
"D: Drinkable for the style. A little hot for me, but still good."
"Overall a very good beer but I have to disagree with the clasification. All signs point to imperial stout."
"D - It's good, but a little thin on the viscous. This would be a great beer to age to see what it tastes like when it grows up."
"taste is thick and creamy at first, then becomes more chewy, deep dark chocolate, licorice, some wood, ends dry with some bitter."
"Notes: It's listed as an American Strong Ale, but it sure tastes like it's bordering on being a Stout to me! Very tasty, and so easy-drinking for such a big beer that it's scary. Anyone who is a fan of the darks should do themselves a favor and drink some motor oil - uh, I mean some Old Viscosity, for sure. Highly recommended!"
"Okay, this is just a phenomenal beer. Black pour, thick short brown head, solid aroma of molasses, roasted malt, chocolate, and some hops. Strong taste of mostly the same, with leather, old wood, soy, and some alcohol in the finish. Very smooth. Love that they bottled this."
"Black chocolate pour with little bubbles permeating and a brownish head. Coffee/mocha and roasted aromas. Coffee that blends into mocha and roast maltiness. Coffee bitter mellows as the beer warms. Finish with some faint charcoal. Some alcohol warmth for sure, but not bad or overpowering. Pretty much full bodied. Excellent, would love to get my hands on the older. Guessing it has more sweet tones and barrel."
"10% ABV, didn't notice till I was done, so pretty drinkable, but not going to be knocking these babies back"
"Reminds me of Founder's Breakfast Stout....might have to try them both side by side to see which I prefer. But this a beer that I wouldn't mind having one around..."
"D - a delicious treat to savour sip by sip."
"The nose on the beer has a bit of chocolate and burnt hints to it, but not much else. Alcohol comes through a bit, but it doesn't ruin the nose. The beer poor a very very dark ruby colour with a tan head of about an inch. Pretty good retention and looks pretty damn tasty. The alcohol is definitely the most present taste at first with a nice burnt roasted flavour in the back ground. There are some caramel hints to the beer as well as some Scottish flavours. There is actually a lot going on in this beer but it's almost like there is too much and they come into one huge flavour that I can't describe. At the end of the drink the roasted bitterness is quite tasty. More drinks of the beer make it really smooth with it's bitterness and roasty flavours. The alcohol is still present, but it's tasty. The mouth feel is nice and thick! Exactly what I wanted! It's decently drinkable."
"This reminded me of Haand Dark Force which I did not enjoy. It must be aged in bourbon barrels that have never had bourbon in them. Not what I expected at all, I would not recommend it."
"had it again in a bottle. the chocolate is more prevalent. a bit overcasting on the rest of the favors. still a fan though. i would recommend letting it breath if that makes any sense."
"Reviewed on 3/31/08. Bottle. Poured a dark black with a slight dark tan head that dissipated. Aroma of coffee, smoke, medicinal esters (faint). Taste of coffee, medicinal esters (particularly cough syrup), chocolate, more smoke. Finish of bitterness and alcohol. Mouthfeel was thick, syrupy. I thought this was more like an imperial stout than an American strong. A solid, enjoyable brew. 8/5/7/4/15 (3.9/5)"
"Drinkability is high, in that this is a fantastic beer. With exceptional depth, it's not one to drink with anything but a revered appreciation. I had no idea what to expect other then a strong dark ale, and am floored. Available it Washington on occasion., I'm stocking up next time I see it. Tastes nothing like snake bile, but not as good for the eyes. And if snake penis was used I would possibly be more viral, but that is not the case or necessary anyways."
"Surprisingly smooth sipper. Complexities open up as the beer warms. A unique beer that leans towards the RIS side of things. Very tasty beer and one that I would imagine would age quite well."
"With a high ABV, it is quite warming. It's complexity, while intriguing isn't meant for serious consumption. Tastey, and worth a try though!"
"Well, maybe I should just stop trying to pretend that I like this style. This is a very interesting beverage, and I dig the bourbon, but next time I'll grab a WIPEOUT and go with the sure thing."
"I do favor the Older Viscosity (this same beer only 100% bourbon oak aged for 6 months) but I still commend this for being an exceptional ale. The brewers claim it to blur the boundaries of porter, stout, old ale and barleywine; I'd agree it's hard to define. Whatever it's considered, it's undoubtedly considered good. Nay, really damn good."
"This bottle was purchased at The Blue Dog Pub in Lansdale, PA (bar with a nice selection of micro-brews, on-tap and sold in their six-pack shop."
"Tasted on 11/22/08."
"Light bodied for what I was expecting, but then it doesn't claim to be a porter or stout. The mounthfeel leads me to think if not for the high alcohol content this is a beer that would be easy to drink a lot of with out filling up. A lot of flavor for a very drinkable beer."
"T/M: Mouthfeel was good, but a litle lighter than I'd like. Taste is of bitter espresso and dark choclate with a lot of smokey sausage element. and vanilla. On the finsh the hops comes through with a lot of espresso bitterness, and alcohol."
"D= This is a very interesting beer. Not quite a stout, this one is very complex, balanced, and boozy. A real sipper and one I will surely have again."
"D- meh, this one just didnt do it for me. too hot, not enough (any) bourbon flavor, not as thick as i would have liked. its not an offensive beer, i guess i just expected more. glad to see this one is available here, but i doubt ill buy another one."
"D: While it is true that this beer has some interesting things to offer, what it offers up in the end isn't all that impressive. Not bad but not all that good or thought provoking. Hot, hoppy, booze filled beer. Age would help this beer I imagine, but as it stands, just an average brew in my mind."
"D: As always, all strong ales and RIS deserve a sampling and cherishing."
"Notes from 6/15/07"
"Mmm, this is good stuff. Definitely to be taken slowly, but full of flavor and really tasty. Thanks Adam!"
"D- Pretty good for 10% alc. This is good. But...Port/Cali beer gets such hype. I can't help but hold that against this to a point. Its good, but..."
"Bottle at home ... deep black ... medium tan head ... rich sweet meaty malt nose with a little whiskey ... big bourbon front... too much bourbon ... it domintaes way to much and distroys its balance... behind the bourbon is a decent rich roast malt but all other characteristics are overpowered"
"Bomber, wish I had poured into a snifter. Pours a deep, dark, soul-less black. Viscous yet quick fading tan head. Initial nose of smoky, woody, coffee, bourbony, goodness. The taste is deceiving but definitely not disappointing. First mouthful tastes of vanilla, brown sugar, cappuccino. Mellows out to a heart-warming cask-esque, sweet, deliciously thick ale that's reminiscent of most imperials. Excellent drinkability that could serve as a hearty dessert beer after a savory home-cooked meal. Just my opinion though. Cheers"
"Now to try Older Viscosity. That's gotta be a trip."
"Tastes like a Russian Imperial Stout to me, but regardless of it's style classification, this is a beer to savor."
"D- Pretty drinkable. It's a sipper, but not hot at all for the amount of alcohol in it."
"A remarkable beer, one of my personal benchmarks. Everything is extremely well balanced and full flavored. Be sure to let this thing warm up a bit to let everything come out. It'll be a little closed (but still good) immediately out of the fridge."
"D- This is definitely a sipper. Old Viscocity is a very enjoyable beer, but it is one bottle and I am going to call it an evening. Recommended."
"Rich, bittersweet bakers chocolate flavor, with a mild hoppiness that lingers well into the dry aftertaste. Some charred malt character blends with the layered hop flavors, giving a good deal of complexity to the taste. Very smooth and creamy body, but slightly thin for being a higher abv stout. Easy drinking, nice west coast hop twist makes it unique...Thanks for sharing Jay!"
"drinkability is good. this is a thick and black brew with a wonderfully roasted profile that contains undertones of earthy malts and bittering hops. nicely crafted. cheers!"
"Overall, this is very complex and could easily be a mixed together mess, but it is very well put together and all the different flavors just accentuate each other. It's sublime and a very decadent and tasty treat."
"D- Very drinkable, if this is your thing. It is my thing, so why the hell didn't I buy two bottles?!"
"A class brew all the way. Sit back, relax, and enjoy every sip of this one. I did."
"Feel is good for a Strong, especially one with Viscosity in the name. I am a big fan of this style but I could see this not being someones fav, but you know what f that noise. This beer is good."
"M/D: Nice mouthfeel, creamy, carbonation a touch high but provides a nice crispness in the middle, full bodied. Drinkability is fine of the style. Was a little surprised that this is a strong ale, seems more like an imperial stout. Very good beer."
"Overall: really really good"
"D - this beer is an excellent way to end your evening; more of a sipper than anything else.might light up a cigar to go along with the rest of this bottle."
"This beer is a year old I think as it was in the back of the cooler. Still an excellent chococoffee bourbon beer. Everyone had that alcoholic math teacher in high school that added bourbon to his coffee, that is this beer."
"Drinkability- Well, this indeed is a rather strange concoction that pretty much rocks. Definitely not a Porter, closer to a Stout, aspects of a Barleywine. A random collage of flavors that I really enjoyed. Another winner by Port. Big thanks again to Aaron again for his generosity!"
"Overall I really like this beer, I had a few others but i drank them cause it was so good. This beer is a great sipping beer. However, call it what you want, maybe Strong Ale is misleading, it's style might be a gray area. HOORAY!"
"Pretty solid all-around strong ale here. Pours a dark-as-coal black with a thick, foamy head. Smell is heavy on the alcohol with a nice hop note. Taste is heavy on coffee, with a lingering bitterness. After a few sips, a nice glowing warmth envelops me, making this a nice choice on a cold, wintery night. Not my favorite beer of its kind, but a worthy entry to Port Brewings excellent catalogue of brews..."
"Drinkability - Very smooth for being 10% alc, though the overall body can limit it from being more than 1 at a time."
"The beer pours a brownish black with very little tan head that dissipates and leaves no lace. The aroma is full of chocolate, caramel and bourbon. The flavor is full of more chocolate up front along with caramel and bourbon. There is also some fruitiness and a bit of spiciness from the alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied and low on carbonation. Overall, an enjoyable warming beer with plenty of flavor."
"D - The flavors stick around quite a bit. Don't see having a lot in one sitting. The one bottle will do me just fine for the evening. Like a bit more of a bourbon taste but bouron is my second drink of choice and I am only beginning to try them."
"Pours a thick, viscous, very dark brown. Smells of roasted malts and molasses. Nice sheet of head, and lots of lacing, coating the entire inside of the glass. Taste of roasted molasses and a bit of coffee. This is a huge , robust stout. Just the way I like'em. Can't even taste the ABV. Can't wait to try more Pizza Port stuff."
"D: For the strength this goes down relatively easy. Despite its appearance it drinks more like a barley wine to me. Regardless, this is a very filling and hitting beer. Because of the color I say throw on something like Buzzoven and escape."
"The body is closer to full than moderate. A lot of legs on this one. Great depth and texture with a silky finish. Pretty clean for the alcohol content. Overall this is one of the best Port beers I have tried. If I were to nit pick, I would have liked more esters and bourbon/whisky/woody flavors, but I love the complexity and body."
"D - Nicely labled as strong ale. I pick up a mix of barley wine and imperial stout which makes for a very nice strong ale. Very good for such heavy burnt flavors."
"D - Overall this is a pretty good beer and i like that the barrel aging adds some complexity to the beer and lets it change throughout each sip. Without these changes, it would just be average, but with it, this is one good beer that I would love to have more accessible."
"D: This is a sipper, not something to be guzzled down. Definitely a beer with a lot of bourbon essence. I think a bomber of this at the end of the night or on a cold winter's night would be good...but I could think of other options that would suit the situation better."
"Who the hell cares what it is when it's this tasty...and this potent. Ten percent goes to the head! Enjoyable oddity from Port, whose heavy handed hops application is well appreciated here."
"This may be one of the thickest most full bodied brews I've ever tasted. Considering this fact, its high alcohol content and supreme drinkability, I consider this with highest regards. Recommended!"
"Drinkability: I don't really get this beer. It's imbalanced - too sweet, and the barrel aging comes through in a bizarrely woody way. It isn't bad - at the very least, it's interesting - but it isn't a beer I'd be too excited to try again."
"D. Very good, I would like more. Very good beer.I enjoyed this beer more the second time."
"Goood morniiing FLAVORRR. God--this thing is complex. Bitter baker's chocolate and resinous hops get overrun by an ethanol-rich alcohol burn that brings in notes of sweetbread, black cherry, currant, raisin sherry, and nutmeg. Intense warming burn of chocolate rum liquor on the finish makes this a beverage I won't soon forget. Mouthfeel is chewy and thick with a sluggish carbonation level that provides just enough bubbliness to spice up the booze at the end. All in all, a terrific sipper that I'd be happy to come across again. Very memorable beverage, though not for beginners."
"Settles black in the glass after poured dark, dark brown out of the bottle. Head is tan and dense, but dissipates quickly to a ring leaving a little bit of lacing. The smell is big and get bigger as it warms - caramel malts, raisins, figs, some dark chocolate, brown sugar and licorice. On top of this is the hint of oak and booze in the background that burns the nose ever so slightly. Taste is a slightly harsher version of the aroma with a big roasted character on top of the malt background and dark fruit flavors. Coffee and chocolate are present as well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and fairly dry in the finish. Drikability is slightly limited by the harsher character of the taste. Still, this is tasty and complex brew from a great brewery. Thanks Dana!"
"Body is very big, creamy, thick, and slippery. The mouthfeel is so velvet smooth you want to take constant sips. Sometimes a big body hinders drinkability for me. In this case it's a rare treat and expertly crafted."
"This is incredibly close to a stout, by far the most stout-like of any American Strong Ale I've ever had. But that's a nebulous category anyway. No matter what you call it, it's delicious. Even beer freaks like me who don't faint at the mere mention of ""bourbon barrel-aged"" should not avoid it. There's most definitely something here for everybody (except for people who simply don't appreciate great beer). I think I'll keep this bottle just for that awesome label..."
"Well carbonated yet smooth and mild. Definitely a slow sipper."
"Served in my DFH snifter. Poured an opaque black with copious tiny bubbles lining the bowl of the glass. Half inch froth comprised of tiny bubbles that reduced its volume by half within less than a minute. Head eventually subsided into a broken swirl of foam; some lacing present during the tasting, but poor adherence. Scents of coffee, dark fruit, vanilla and some boozy bourbon notes. Taste follows nose on this one with the bourbon flavor masked in the mouth, and a bit of cocoa that shows through as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light effervescence, not at all thick or viscous. Some alcohol warmth makes an appearance without being boozy. This is definitely a sipper, but quite an enjoyable one at that. A nice alternative to an RIS if you're looking for a flavor packed brew with a lighter body."
"More of an imperial stout than a strong ale. It pours a near black mahogany and has a nice dark tan head. The nose has a big roasted malt profiel along with dark fruits, coffee, chocolate, woody bourbon and floral hops. The taste is also a nice blend between dark malts and bitter hops. Coffee, figs, currants, anise, molasses and chocolate all there with faint bourbony oak. Nice full body is well carbonated. A delicious brew."
"Pours black blackity black-black with a short creamy topped head supported by a stack of perfect little brown bubbles. Smells of bourbon, vanilla and melted chocolate, some rummy alcohol. An inviting odor, certainly. Taste is quite satisfying, bourbon is heavy up front, with a gradual transition to a more roasted, black char malt flavor. Notes of oak, vanilla, wood tannins, dark chocolate and ethanol. Alcohol slightly hot, but not overbearing. Mouthfeel is full bodied, but not actually as think and oily as the name implies. A good drinker, well-crafted and interesting throughout."
"D: wow, this beer is phenomenal. One of the best I have had yet. Well worth getting if you have the means."
"22oz bomber into a Brooklyn snifter. Pours an appropriately opaque black with a decent tan head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves decent lacing. Aroma is nice complex blend of bitter chocolate and burnt caramel, oak and hints of coffee and Bourbon. The taste shows more Bourbon than the aroma, oaked bitter chocolate lingers in the finish. The beer is certainly heavy, a sipper to say the least. I can guarantee this beer would be better in the Winter, but it still delights now."
"I actually enjoyed slightly colder than cellar temp. Am I kicked out of the club? This is the first Port beer I ever tried. Have had many since. This one is top notch. Just like the brewery."
"At first I thought this must be an Imperial Stout, but after I tasted It I am not so sure. It is a very good beer for sure, but didn't quite blow me away as I had hoped."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Alcohol is rather high, but flavor is great. Really drinks well."
"I've got to get more of Port Brewing's beers; the ones I've tried have been excellent. This beer was a very dark brown with red highlights. A medium tan head with good lacing. Coffee, chocolate, dark fruit aroma. Ditto on the taste, with some bread also. The alcohol is noticeable, but not intrusive. Very comfortable beer."
"Feel is smooth and luscious, dessert-like yet without the fat. I ding the drinkability only because of the richness of this brew. It reminds me a bit of the Victory at Sea from Ballast Point. Excelllent dessert brews, yet not something to consume in quantity."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and silky, almost a bit chewy at times. Just a good time to drink, very enjoyable."
"Always outstanding and shouldn't be overlooked as often as I do."
"A slightly sour bourbon flavor comes through strongly on the initial taste, and lingers for a long time afterwards. The roastiness comes through solidly as well, and there is some decent hop bitterness. Overall the flavors don't quite all blend perfectly, but it is still complex and tasty enough to warrant an excellent rating. It has a very full, creamy body, and the carbonation is appropriate. Overall, it is an excellent dessert beer."
"D- Although I was ready for a 10oz medium-rare ribeye from Iowa after finishing this one, I wasn't really looking for another bottle. However, I would definitely recommend giving this one a try, and maybe a second time aged."
"Pours a deep opaque black, thick brown head forms, settles to a thick ring, some lace spots, legs on the glass, real nice. Smell is intense, tons of chocolate, coffee, toffee, licorice, raisins, very rich, caramel cake, lots of dark fruit, oil, awesome. Taste is similar, intense bitter chocolate, toffee, coffee roast, dark fruit, more licorice, more chocolate, dark fruits and raisin, bread and nuts in the finish, bitter finish, alcohol is there but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is very thick and oily, full bodied, with low to medium carbonation, some heat going down. Very enjoyable, good sipper for the evening."
"drinkability is pretty good. it's a big and heavy beast, but the alcohol is balanced pretty well and there's enough malt depth to keep you going back for more."
"A delicious unique brew from Port Brewing.... Got one more bottle that will age for a couple of years to see how it changes..."
"My first Pizza Port offering and a great start I must say. As the label says, pours black as oil with some mahogany highlights around the edges and a tan head. Smell is of dark chocolate, caramel, toasted grains, and dark fruit. Parts of it almost reminded me of chocolate covered cherries. Tastes is amazing as well. Dark chocolate, caramel, fruit, burnt grain and some alcohol. Mouthfeel I would say is medium but bordering on heavy. Doesnt really leave too thick of a taste in your mouth though. Overall a great beer, I have to knock it a little on drinkability as after glass #1 you will start to feel it!"
"D: A solid ASA on par with a porter or stout flavor-wise, but would benefit from either a reduced alcohol content, or perhaps some aging to mellow it out. It should age well for a couple years and I plan to try doing so."
"This is a very, very good beer."
"D - Complex and enjoyable. Very dark flavors bordering on carbonized. Surprisingly smooth for a 10% beer. The flavor is quite nice, but the aroma is really the most successful aspect of this beer."
"Thanks to jcwattsrugger for bringing this back from CA:Pours black with a brown head that thins and stays for awhile.The smell is of chocolate, a hint of vanilla, some licorice and prunes.The taste follows the nose very closely - and nicely.  Chocolate with a vanilla twist, acidic sharpness, licorice, dark fruits and some oak mix together, ending with a bittersweet, slightly boozy, finish.The carbonation is low, body hits full.Despite a slight astringency, it is quite drinkable, as the taste begs for more sipping, and the alcohol is pretty well hidden (with just a peek in the finish.  A unique, enjoyable, brew."
"A bottle is good on its own, as you will feel this one, but still very good and highly recommended."
"No doubt a unique beer, as heavy as the name indicates but worth trying."
"Drinkability - had I tried this a few years ago, I probably wouldn't have liked it. I'm glad to have acquired a palate for some complex flavors that I can appreciate amidst the high abv. Sip 'er slow, allow some time between samples to let the aftertaste evolve in the mouth, that's good stuff going on in there. A fine warmup for it's 'Older' brother, soon to come..."
"As I look at the bottom of the empty bottle, the smell is almost as impressive as what is coming from the glass... Really good stuff."
"I can't get enough of this beer! It pours very thick and creamy, definitely reminds me of a 30 weight oil. The head is a nice tan brown. The smell has chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and a definite whiskey smell. The taste is better then it smells with a nice whiskey taste toward the ends. Despite the thick pour the beer has a good mouth feel and is very smooth and easy drinking. I would like to see what this beer tastes like cellared for a while, but I can't seem to keep it on my shelf long enough."
"Taste was not what I expected, a lot more smooth than most strong-ales. Alcohol bite was almost undetectable. Either the bottle I had was aged or they age it before bottling, either way it led to a very drinkable beer. Low carbonation levels are fine, since this is such a 'thick' brew already. You feel like you're drinking a meal when you finish your glass. I finished the whole bottle and wanted more:)"
"Big mouthfeel, drinkable enough to finish the 22oz bomber, but not much."
"A bold flavored strong ale with some very promising rich notes; however, the licorice spice seems out of place. Also, the assertive alcohol presence is a little unrestricted."
"Another great purchase from Plaza Liquors in Tucson & a super value at $6 a bottle!"
"Bought from South Bay Liquor. Poured from a bomber into a snifter. Quite dark with a very small head. Smells of chocolate, toffee, cherries, and maybe a hint of coffee. Tastes very much like chocolate and coffee, with a bit of cherry and alcohol underneath. The flavors are very round and coat my tongue nicely. Mouthfeel is right in the middle and very pleasant. The only thing hurting this beer is drinkability, as I can only see myself drinking one of these in a sitting. Overall this is a complex and genuinely good beer."
"D: I struggled to get through this bomber... it was so good but so heavy... it almost suffers from its own success..."
"At first I thought this would be a little tough to finish the bomber just from weight alone. However, as it warmed it became thoroughly enjoyable. Definitely sip this to see it warm and evolve. Awesome stuff."
"Taste is dark dry roast, dark chocolate and a hoppy finish hiding behind all the flavorful roast. Perhaps the mildest twinge of bourbony flavor, but it melds so well with the other flavors that I wouldn't even know its a bourbon beer. A nice light dry oak characteristic in the end as well. Looks and smells like an imperial stout, and is rich and flavorful like one, except its body is not quite as thick, perhaps, and the hops shine, yet complement the beer more than in any Imperial Stout I've had. Easily one of my new favorites. Thanks again Mike!"
"D- very good"
"Black as the night with a short-lived tan head that left some nice lacework behind. Wonderful aroma of coffee, malt, chocolate, raisins. Flavor is a well balanced mix of caramel, toffee, sweet and bitter chocolate, roasted malt, warming alcohol. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth. This was about as delicious a beverage as I can remember tasting. Like a milkshake for grownups."
"I would definitely order this one again. It's my first experience with Port Brewing/Russian River and I want to try more. Delicious."
"Overall this beer is fantastic"
"A great beer all around, especially if you like whiskies. Highly recommended."
"As the name would imply, this pour looks like motor oil. Maybe a finger of coffee colored head, doesn't last long. Are we sure this isn't a stout? I can smell the alcohol, bourbon notes as well. Taste is actually a little on the hot side. I can taste almost too much bourbon, some nice sweet vanilla on the back end though. Mouthfeel is light and almost watery, considering the name and appearance. Drinkability - the alcohol is a little strong, but it is a tasty brew, and a great value."
"This is a mighty fine sipping beer. Had some at a tasting over the weekend and the general consesus was very positive. It poured dark and opaque like a stout. Small, short lived dark brown head. Appropriately named as it stuck to the glass while swirling. Taste was sweet at first and the alcohol was immeidately present but not overwhelming. I could easily share with a drinking bud but not take down a whole bomber. Served a bit cooler than room temp. Great beer!"
"One of the best Russian Imperial Stouts for its price alongside Stone of course, have also enjoyed this on tap at Naja's, will definitely drink again some time in the future, do prefer this after being aged in bourbon barrels but still a great stout, recommended"
"I traded with BuckeyeSox to get this bottle, thanks Dev. The beer pours much darker than I expected, definitely it looks like an imperial stout. Dark brown opaque liquid with a thick dark tan (chocolate milk color) head. The smell is like an imperial stout rauchbier, lots of sweet malts and roasted malts with a smoky aroma. The taste is really complex, adding a touch of irish coffee to the mix. The aftertaste is a little bitter, not unlike the final flavors from a coffee+whiskey. Very good, very agressive, much appreciated."
"For all its big characteristic, this drinks exceptionally smoothly and palatable. It presents itself as more satisfying than it is boozy or rich. High abv hinders massive consumption, but I love this beer."
"Drinkability is forcing me to send one of the guys out for sandwiches so I can function for the rest of the workday."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a rich, warm black and chocolate malt scent that also has a slight bourban aroma. It's quite strong smelling, but also very enticing with lots of complexity. The taste is good. It has a roasted and chocolate malt taste that goes down silky smooth and finishes warm with a slight bourban barrel flavor. This is quite a beer for sure. The mouthfeel is near perfect. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. It's excellent in concept and delivery; a wonderful sipper. Highly recommended!"
"Pizza Port / Lost Abbey Rules. I have been really digging their beers as of late. The bottle says it's not your dad's wimpy 30 weight and I have to agree. What it is, is 22 ounces of pure black goodness!"
"D: 1 bomber is without a doubt enough but very tasty nonetheless."
"Drinkability - A good sipper. Complex without being too overpowering. The ABV is hidden well. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try this one. Recommended!"
"Another good beer from Port Brewing. They seem to constantly come up with quality brews. This does seem to be a hybrid style ale leaning more toward a porter than an imperial stout."
"I'd say it has a medium mouthfeel and the carbonation is lightly done and it finishes with a slight tartness(from the hops?) This is a high quality and very complex brew and is pretty darned drinkable despite the 10%abv(read: hidden very well) I'd gladly drink it again. The only thing I'm wondering is...how is the Older Viscosity going to stack up against this? I think it will be a tough act to follow.."
"I love Port's beers and this one is up to the standard. Big but balanced and easy to drink."
"D: This is a sipper but I found that it was easier to drink than I expected. The alcohol is hidden very well but it certainly catches up with you at some point."
"I think they may have updated the bottle design. Very different, I question its claim as an American Strong Ale. Still, I like it. Pours an extremely dark brown with a light brown head that disappears in about a minute thirty. Aroma is chocolate covered cherries (by far the strongest description of the smell). Some light hops in the background. Taste is like a strong sweet stout; coffee, but it has the spirt/hop and alcohol profile of an American strong ale. Intresting Combination. Goes down oily smooth with lively carbonation. Very unique."
"There was a weak hiss when I popped the cap and a hard pour produced a thin, fine ring of brownish bubbles. Spotty lacing that really stuck to the glass. It looked quite thick off the pour too. Caramel aroma with roasty, dark malts and a bit of fruit. Fairly mellow with a bit of chocolate too. Mild alcohol, slightly vinous. Great flavour. Sweetness up front balanced by roasted grains and moderate bitterness. Notes of chocolate and licorice filled out the middle, along with mild fruit (cherry and raisin). Alcohol became more prominent towards the end, with a peppery finish. Lingering roast and toffee. Lots of chocolate as it warmed. Full bodied, low carbonation, silky/malty texture with plenty of warmth. This is great stuff. Superb balance for such strong character. You definitely need to let this one warm up to at least cellar temperature before the flavour really pops. Too cold and it loses its punch."
"Pours a solid black that no light gets through. Starts with a thin tan head that goes away quickly. Aroma is really nice chocolates, coffee, some dried fruit, a little caramel. Taste follows the smell, but adds some alcohol bite in the end. Mouthfeel is thick as promised. Excellent brew, very complex, thick, tasty. Send more."
"D: For as much flavor as this packs and how persistent the aftertaste is this doesn't become a burden to drink like some other RIS end up being for me. Reminds me of Weyerbacher's Heresy in some ways but much more interesting to drink (and easier)."
"This review is from a fresh bottle from the first batch enjoyed at the Toronado. This beer is dark, seriously, like I mean in a cave speluning dark. No light penetrates this beast of a beer, and there is a small cap of illy espresso foam on the top of this brew that stays for the duration of the tipple. Aromas are dark, burnt, roasted malts, chocolate, heavy duty coffee, and more roasted malts. Hops are green and piney but only faintly in the background here as this is a malt bomb. Taste i heavy with roasted malts, some caramel, chocolate, and more coffee. This is pretty straight up but the balance is so rock solid and that is what really elevates this one to the next level. Mouthfeel is thick and coating, but not cloying with sweetness and the drinkability is good, but limited due to the serious heft that this one holds."
"Notes - Beer for masochists. Sure, there are stronger beers out there, but very few of them have the ability to wreck the palate like Old Viscosity. The Bottle of The Abyss I had yesterday was downright mild compared to this."
"I have yet to not like anything from Port Brewing/Lost Abbey. Great beer."
"The flavors come together well to create an exciting beer experience. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Smooth ride."
" THe Brew trancends a style. high velocity, deep complexity, a true sipper that has an ABV of 10% but it feels like 20%. high grade yummy."
"The taste hits with dark chocolate, roasted malt (not to the levels of a stout), and some slight acidity. At 10% ABV, the alcohol is also quite present. Everything else about this beer is good. As a strong ale it delivers with good almost-stout-like flavor. Mouthfeel is pretty slick as expected. About medium-heavy on the weight scale. When in the mood for a strong dark roasty beer like this I can think of few better alternatives."
"Pours to an almost blackish brown body that shows no light when held to a flame. Head is a chocolate brown foam at about an inch and a half with nice retention. Nose is vesty with rich malt and sweet spices that have hints of alchol, toffee, and cordials. Enters the mouth just as darkness should, long rich and full of flavors such as burnt malt nuttiness, toasted biscuits and subtle dry sweetness. A big dark beer with wonderful complexity. Mouthfeel is warm and welcomed. Alchol is scary well hidden except for the belly warming. There is even a trace of hop bitter to the finish. A super drinkable beer that I wish I could find locally."
"Good beer, compares pretty favorably to Alesmith's Speedway (although it's been a few weeks since I've had one of those). Roasted notes and a good dose of chocolate compliment the beer. The barrel taste is there but not overwhelming (in a good or bad way) like other beers. Drinks well but I had to slow down as I got close to the end of a 22 (duh)."
"This beer pours a thick jet impenetrable black. Thin, thin layer of beige head bubbles despite strong elevated pour. The nose has oak, rich vanilla, bourbon, and cream notes. Smells alittle of alcohol. smells to me almost like tiramisu. Mouthfeel is thick as hell, very chewy. This beer is incredible! The first thing I think of is instantly tiramisu. Black chocolate, coffee, rich cake and thick vanilla flavors. DAMN!! This is an incredible brew. The finish has a nice little hop bite. Smoootttthhhh!!!. I just acquired two older viscosities (thanks JCB) and the first taste of this inspired me to pull the one i put in the fridge out and cellar it with the other. The smoothness of this beer is incredible. Very good, yet light alcohol flavors. This is very much a desert. Incredibly drinkable and very tasty. WOW. I love this beer. This one is defenitely worth all the hype. I am priveleged to have experienced this beer. Thanks again to SuzyGreenberg."
"d: Bombers of this are a bit pricey in these parts, but somehow I have to force the PA Dutchman in me to buy some more. Port Brewing has made something both unique and delicious, they deserve tons of credit."
"Pours a very dark, opaque black with no head even off a pretty firm pour. Nose is heavy with alcohol. Very slight roasted tones to it. Flavor is extremely robust with a roasted quality to it that is deep and clings to the palate. Unfortunately, that drops off to a thinner flavor, though there is still a strong lasting aftertaste. Feel is low on carbonation and bordering on syrup like. Overall a pretty good beer. I only wish the initial flavor profile would hold out a lot longer."
"Bottle. Poured a blackish-brown color with a thick brown head. A very nice aroma of vanilla and bourbon. Maybe even a little hint of chocolate. Mouthfeel is pretty nice, although not as full as the pour led me to believe it would be. Flavor is also not really what I thought it'd be. It was more of a porter or chocolate stout than a Strong Ale, in my opinion. There wasn't really that much bourbon flavor to it. Although this is a good beer (a really good beer), the flavor didn't stack up to the aroma and appearance."
"I got this gem from ol leftmindedrighty in a very nice trade, thanks mucho Aaron!"
"1037"
"Go Pats . C'mon the Hoops ..."
"D: I'm gonna let a couple more of these age and try them in a while. It seems to me like they'll get better."
"I really like this beer. Complex with big flavors all playing nice together. Really seems like a stout to me. I will seek this out again."
"Take me to school yet another time this week. I understand that American Strong Ale enjoys a wide interpretation, but this one does remind one of a Double Stout or a RIS. Pours an opaque darkness with a shallow dark tan head that fades fairly quickly and leaves a nice striated lacing pattern. The smell is full, rich and thick and chocolaty. Lightly toasted with a nice whiff of vanilla from the barrel treatment. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel of this sipper is full bodied, silky smooth with a light tang from the warming 10% ABV. The texture coats the tongue lightly, as you might expect from name, but it isn't as pronounced as some Double Stouts. Full flavored, the taste is great. A nice lightly toasted malt, chocolate and cherry vanilla that lingers appropriately. A really nice drinker. Highly recommended."
"I popped this bottle with the idea that it's an imperial stout, but it seems to be some crazy hybrid of an imperial stout and barleywine, with leanings towards old ale, three threads porter and english strong ale. Very malt driven, which is a nice change in an american big beer. The bottle can't be more than a year and a half old, but it tastes like a 3-4 year old barleywine at least. Very tasty, but hard to sip too much in one sitting. I split up the bomber over the course of 24 hours."
"thanks to themanaical one!"
"Overall: A good beer with a nice array of aggressive flavors, but I was a little disappointed that it was lacking a nice bourbon punch. If it wasn't advertised as bourbon aged than I would have liked it more."
"D: Very unique beer. It almost seems like a Russian Imperial stout/barleywine fusion. A heavy hitter with TONS of flavor. It was frustrating for me to not be able to identify specific flavors, but still quite good. With the ABV, though, don't make any plans if you're going to drink this beer. Not at the top of my big alcohol beers, but I'd drink it again."
"Cheers"
"Final thoughts? Lord do I want to age one of these for a year or two. If only I had some bourbon barrels of my own to bring that character along a bit further!"
"D - I will keep trying to achieve the Viscosity Nirvana I once felt. The latter two bottles were bought at the same time so it could be assumed that a batch went out at a lower than usual carbonation. This is one of the potentially best local beers around."
"D: A bit over the top for a Strong Dark Ale...more of a Barley Wine. One is a treat...two in a session might tax my limits for full bodied, deeply flavored, and high ABV brew."
"I aged this bottle 1 year before drinking. I have to say that I'm a big fan of Port, and this is my favorite beer from them yet. Pours black and viscous with a head that settles to a thin cap and creates some lacing. The nose has sweet malt, bitter chocolate, whiskey, prunes, rum soaked cherries, and some piney hops. Great! The taste is very bitter up front with lots of piney hops, gentian, and bitter orange. These bitter flavors are followed by long creamy dry malt and whiskey notes. The mouthfeel is smooth but with tannic edges, and rich and thick. Extremely satisfying, this is simply a great beer."
"Pours a deep dark blackish color, absorbing all light in the room. I had to turn on a few extra lights to see my way around. Nice creamy tannish head, leaving monstrously brilliant lacing throughout the finish. Aroma is of coffee and some mean hoppy resin smell. Taste is definitely coffee and chocolate, toffee and raisins up front. Not too sweet, and a really nice bitternes in the finish from the roasted malts and an unbridled use of hops. Very thick and mouth coating, I could probably lube the chassis of my pickup truck with this stuff. Please use caution with this beer, it's been known to make my bathroom an unbearable place after I've done my business the next morning. Maybe that's a good thing, if you're like me and want to mess with youtr wife! Hahaha."
"A very fine brew. Good choice to complement a rich dessert. Not for people who don't like stronger beer. Try one if you a fan of darker or barrel aged beers."
"If I had to pigeon-hole this beer, I might call it a barrel-aged stout. But why categorize it if you don't have to. Kudos to Tomme Arthur and the gang at Pizza Port for this impressive beer."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a pleasant chocolate themed finish. Drinkability? This is such a big ale that it hides the 10% alcohol content masterfully, but I dont think that 2 bombers of this would be a good idea."
"The beer pours from the 22 ounce bottle a deep brown with some ruby highlights, the dark tan head stacks three or so fingers upon the body, it decomposes quickly leaving a consolidated sheet of lace to cover the glass. WOW! what a nose, its chock full of malt, sweet and mouth watering, hints of chocolate, coffee, Port wine, just wish I had some incense or potpourri with this fragrance. Start is thick with sweet malt, and a bitter bite from the 10 percent ABV, top is definitively full and rich. Finish has delightful hop presence, the acidy masterful, and a dry aftertaste that coats the palate, the alcohol warms the tummy, A real Hoot this masterpiece of the brewers art."
"Pours black with a thin tannish brown head. Noticeably slower pouring than other beers. My wife exclaimed ""yuk"". She didn't get any. Smells of roasted to burnt malt with a hint of chocolate. The initial flavor is roasted malt with heavy carmelized sugar and a hint of chocolate. Bitter, long lived aftertaste that picks up a licorice/anise flavor. As it warmed up, I could pick up flavors ranging from tobacco to burnt malts. This is pretty complex, but a little on the bitter and burnt side for my taste. The mouthfeel is good. Full bodied with oily to syruppy feel and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is decent but not great. I would put it in the stout/imperial stout category. I would prefer something less burnt. Paired with a sweet dessert, the edge is taken off a little. Try ice cream, or apple pie."
"Wow. My brother-in-law brian700 has raved about the Pizza Port and Lost Abbaye beers for some time. Finally I get to see why he was so excited about them. Nothing short of amazing. I wish I would have bought a few more bottles as this sets up an evening of drinking nicely. If you are a fan of the dark stuff (Guiness, Murphys, Beamish, etc.) you need to do yourself a favor and try this out! Prost!"
"Mouthfeel-name says it all. Alcohol is a little heavy handed. Overall a very tasty and complex brew that will leave your palate exhausted. In a good way. Highly recommended."
"Very smooth on the tongue, almost velvet-like. The alcohol was not overpowering at all, which made this beer very drinkable. Will definately have to pick up some more of these and put them down for some aging."
"This beer pours like heavy sludge from the bomber into a snifter. Aroma is cocoa dominate with alcoholic esters with a burnt touch. This brews starts with a slap of alcohol on the tongue that has a touch of a spicy feel to it. More of the same flavors in the smell run inside in the mouth too. I would recommend splitting this with a friend versus drinking the whole bottle."
"Pours a coal black color with minimal dark tan head that disappears to leave you staring into darkness in a glass. Smell is of licorice and dried fruit. I can smell dried oranges. Taste is a little licorice and some light cocoa notes. Some of the dried fruit comes through but not as much in the nose. A real warming sensation hits me in the chest as the alcohol is really present."
"Poured a coal black with some thin lacing- very different that i had expected. Thick and syrupy- the aromas are all warm brandy liquor and dried dark fruits- the roasted character tis present but overwhelmed. Nice and smooth mouthfeel- very rich. The chocolatey flavors really come out and the malts also represent a thckness. Im not sure if the fruitiness is from the malty sweetness or the burning alcohol. There is a lot of flavor here. ther eis a dryness to the finish, and the bourbon aging brings another level to the brews ending notes. Recommended, but share it with a friend- definately not a strong ale in my book, its stout in every way."
"My first Pizza Port brew! For some reason I thought this would be like a stout, it isnt. It is black as oil and has a thin ring of bubbles for a head. The smell is some vanilla and sweet candy. The flavor is strong, more vanilla, raisins, dark fruit. Good flavors but the alcohol is noticeable. 22oz is too much, I should have split this bomber with someone but oh well."
"Thanks, Boolshot, for the opportunity"
"Overall this is a good double stout. It drinks a bit hot which is expected from a fresh double stout but not one bottled on 4/8/11 that sat on a store shelf for 6 months."
"Pours an opaque black with a chocolate milk head that takes its time and laces with vengeance. Smells sweet, cherries, chocolate and roasted coffee. Tastes very sweet. Every indication of a stout up until this point. Dried fruit, cherries, rum and a hop bite. Alcohol makes itself known. Thick and full in the mouth with carbonation a little present. She is a sipper. Worth a try and very tasty along with breaking its categorie's mold."
"Large bottle, no freshness indication, pours dark, real dark, great looking dark tan head, leaving fine, scattered lacing and nicely knit sheeting. sniff of an alcoholic dark chocolate milk shake. Yum. Intense, complex and interesting concoction....loads of dark chocolate, chocolate syrup, rum soaked fudge, black expresso beans. Fine beer, dark beer lovers rejoice and go get some."
"An amazing beer. The aroma and the intial taste impressions remind me of DFH Worldwide Stout (and while I love the latter beer and its 18% abv, this was nicely alcoholic but still drinkable) -- notes of port wine and intense, fruity maltiness. The long middle was like a topflight brown ale, and the finish was surprisingly hoppy for a beer of this style (which is not to say hoppier than most, but hoppy for the style). One of the best beers I've had in a while."
"22 oz. bottle- color of black, with a tan head - nose of cola, vanilla, bitter chocolate, and subtle anis  taste of vanilla, charcoal, cola, coffee, bitter sweet chocolate, and malt- body is thick and chewy, sweet, and with low carbonation  aftertaste of chocolate, and anis"
"Pours an extremely dark brown/black with a tiny head that turns into just about nothing. Lacing is pretty much nothing as well, not sure why this one has no head/stickiness, but oh well, moving on. Smell is pretty complex. Lots of caramel sweetness mixed with an oaky vanilla and dark fruits. Taste is strong molasses with a strong caramel malt. Next comes the cherry, fig, and raisins with a touch of alcohol but it blends in quite well. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a minimal amount of carbonation. Very unique beer. Old Ale? Strong Ale? Stout? What the hell is it? Whatever it is, it's a great beer."
"Overall- This is a big strong one. Gotta be careful here. Definitely a sipper."
"D: This is one in-your-face beer. It makes Arrogant Bastard seem only a bit conceded. Very good, but the intensity makes this a good candidate for sharing with a friend."
"Good."
"This was a very, very well-thought-out beer."
"Bottle: Poured a black color ale with a off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of bitter roasted malt with some citrus hops is intriguing. Taste is dominated by some medium roasted malt mix with some bitter hops as well as some oak and maybe light bourbon and vanilla notes. Very interesting and complex beer with a full body and no alcohol was discernable."
"Damn fine product we have here. Massive amounts of melted oozing thick viscous caramel covered with dark and milk chocolates. Dark bold fruits plum, zinfandel grapes, black currant, black raspberry, toffee, vanilla and candied sugar. Slightly sweet with some hop bitterness on the finish. Alcohol is very well hidden but is noticeable. The mouth is thick and coating with a silky smooth finish. Light carbonation fits this beer well. Considering it's ABV this beer is damn drinkable and could even double as a desert beer. Nice sweetness that isn't cloying in the least."
"D: The drinkability suffers because it's such a big brew, but that shouldn't turn you away. Still a great, kick ass brew from Pizza Port. A dessert in a glass."
"Small head, with moderate carbonation, and great off-white lacing. n old ale, but basically a Russian Imperial Stout if you ask me. The perfect mellow blend of rich flavors, if you can picture that. Lots of roasted, toasted, black malts, some tartness, mild bitterness, and chocolate essence, backed up with a great body that also comes across as rich but mellow. Very easy to drink for the high alcohol and full flavor; every aspect shows great restraint. A slight bit of higher alcohols, but the alcohol is relatively well hidden, especiall at about 45-50°F. Small and unoffensive amounts of mercaptan and phenols. Great stuff, and worth seeking out. Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with molasses sweetness and some over the top cloyingness up front. Slightly thin finish."
"A very impressive beer from Port Brewing"
"Great drinkability. Dark roasted flavors but refreshing crispness. Hidden alcohol and smooth overall flavor make this one go down easy. Good stuff. Kind of breaks style guidelines, not a typical strong ale...closer to a double stout. Similar to Dark Horse's Black Bier."
"Well I've run out of steam for this absurd war analogy, perhaps that will give you an idea of the drinkability (I wouldn't have been this creative if I wasn't slightly buzzed). Nevertheless I want another. And another. I just wish my truck could produce it like the label shows."
"D- Complex and exciting strong ale that is reminiscent of an imperial stout, 10% abv can hit you pretty hard, i probably wouldn't want to push more than one bomber in a sitting."
"D: The alcohol is well hidden until you get 1/2 way through the glass, then it hits pretty hard. An excellent stout nonetheless, to say nothing of its standing as an American Strong Ale."
"D- wonderful, complex, perfect balance, highly recommended, i'm really at a loss of words for this brew, just a wondeful drinking experience"
"from for Boolshot my anny bombing, split with dirtylou in NC"
"drinkability: good"
"Drinkability: While I would've preferred a lessened presence from the dark roasted grains, it was still pretty good!"
"Drinkability- Damn this was harsh. A bit too much for me, especially in the hops dept. An interesting intense experience for sure though."
"D: You'd might think a strong ale like this would be ""one and done", but the complexity of the nose, the great collection of tastes and the smooth finish begs for another pint, which I was quite glad to hoist to an excellent brew."
"I'd like another, to savour with a friend."
"Strange example of they style but quite nice. Kind of a stout/brown ale hybrid. Thick and heavy flavors: coffee, roasted malts, chocoalte and licorice but with a brown ale consistency. Alcohol is fairly well hidden but comes out a bit as the beer warms. Not as heavy a mouthfeel as I expected but the hop and coffee bitterness makes it feel thicker than it really is. Good beer for consuming slowly but not one I would have repeatedly in one night."
"Highly recommended. Yet another great Port offering."
"Finish has a lingering toffee alcohol dryness."
"Robust and roasted malt notes. Big and bold. Thick unsweetened chocolate flavors are hefty on the palate. The sweetness takes on caramel flavors. Slight dark fruitiness comes through, but it's very subtle and plays a secondary role to the sweet caramel and nestle chocolate notes. Sharp burnt coffee bitterneess that continues in the aftertaste and well into the finish. Leafy hop notes skip in and out. Thick and full bodied with an almost impy stout like feel to it. Extremely smooth ont the palate---it's almost creamy, but just not to that point. High bozzyness is more apparent as it warms, but doesn't deter from it's flavor or aroma. Quite drinkable considering the high abv. This definitely isn't your dad's whimpy 30 weight. Get it if you can as you won't be disappointed."
"I had to try this beer, it just seemed to be staring me in the face at the store saying, ""drink me!"" Anyways, I poured it into my new weapon of choice, the same adams specialty Boston Lager glass. It poured a dark dark complexion (although not black enough so that no light made it through), with a white head that had nice retention all around. In th smell was a bit of must, cocoa, chocolate cake, blackberries, and a mild earthy grain. In the taste was lots of smoke and coffee, some dark chocolate. Carbonation was pretty high, serving to heighten the smoky character. Pretty big on the palate as well...not quite syrupy, but still a big beer. Alcohol was also well hidden, but with the extreme flavors going on in this brew, I suppose it would be. I felt that one bomber of it was more than enough for me. A fascinating beer that I wish I had tried sooner. Hopefully more from this brewery will make it out to us in Massachusetts soon enough. Cheers"
"Drinkability is great. This is an excellent and well made brew. Yum!"
"This is definitely more to the style of an Imperial Stout than a typical Strong Ale, but either way a very enjoyable and extrordinary treat"
"Taste is not as sharp as I imagined. Smooth coffee and cocao mixture. A hint of sourness comes through a raisin-y flavor. A unique flavor with caramel and bitterness, haven't had that before. Slick feeling, smooth. Less filling, eh? Very drinkable. Very nice."
"Recommended!!"
"A nice big beer that's a little too hoppy to be a Stout, but has a lot of similar character. Very nice and worth seeking out."
"Pours a one finger, light tan head that slowly fades leaving a good lace. Nose is roasted coffee. Midnight black color. Light carbonation and very heavy bodied. Flavor is burnt coffee and some alcohol, nice beefy strong ale. $8.30 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Great beer!"
"As others have said, this is not what one typically thinks of as an American Strong Ale, but it's a damn fine brew, regardless of the style. Well worth seeking this one out."
"A large bottle found at a well-stocked grocery store called Minute Shop in Solana Beach that I have tried to add, to heads up other BAs."
"Overall: I really like this beer. Everything from Lost Abbey is always great."
"A sipper for sure, this oddity could use a touch more refinement in its formulation, but is nevertheless a pretty decent goblet at the end of a long day."
"D-not too high. I'm getting drunk off of one"
"This is one of the most interesting and complex beers I've had and it only gets more interesting and complex with age. I can't wait to try the early 2007 version I have stashed away."
"Purchased: Park Lane Liquor, Lancaster CA"
"Nice tasty ale here and really this beer is another in the current fad of Bourbon barrel beers. Really tasty ale but this is a very big beer that you really chew more than drink."
"The butter diacetyl adds well to the taste, it makes the mouthfeel a tad on the sticky side. However, this is one of the most daring and amazingly well rounded brews I've tried- and it goes down so easy, maybe too easy. I would definitely drink this one again."
"Just don't stare at this beer to long....you might get lost...Enjoy"
"i'm thinking more of an imp stout here, but by whatever name a pretty damn good beer."
"This is one big beer!"
"Slick mouthfeel, but lots of carb tingles upfront and warmth throughout the mouth."
"22 ounce bottle. The last few months I have had several bottles of this beer, and I really enjoy it! Dark brown to black color, very light colored brown froth. The nose is awfully soft and dull. only a very light hint of fruits and perhaps a light hint of chocolate, bourbon and wood. Interesting flavor of very light bourbon and wood, rich malts, dried cocoa, fruits. Very complex. A great brew!"
"Two big thumbs up!"
"22oz. Bomber: This one pours a slightly thick, extremely dark brown. It looks a bit like used 30 weight oil. It forms a small but dense tan head. Coffee and chocolate are the first things that hit the nose. Some bourbon and possibly a hint of vanilla in the background. Very tasty. There is a hint of the alcohol right up front, along with the chocolate malt. A hint of fruits follow, but no real sweetness to it. Feels a bit warming in your mouth. This is excellent. Ive got to try and get a few more before they are gone!"
"a great brew. don't think i would want one very often, but on a cold boston night, it really hit the spot."
"Drinkability is excellent. I want lots of these. Give me more. Reminds me of my favorite Great Divide Yeti, but thickness isnt the same. More sweet. Overall, excellent."
"D - Very enjoyable..I wish I had several others to sample! I'd imagine I wouldn't reach for more than one per evening, but makes for the perfect nightcap."
"i am actually a fan of pizza port brews but, this is one that i won't buy again. i even treated this brew like wine by letting it ""breathe"" for at least half an hour on my second pour. the bite was still too strong."
"Pours out black with a tan head that doesn't last and leaves no lacing. Smell is excellent, chocolate-y, dark fruits, vanilla and oak. Unfortunately, the taste has a strong alcohol taste and burn to it. You can sense the malty flavors beneath, but they're being overpowered at the moment. Thick mouthfeel, carbonation was borderline flat. Too much alcohol for now. I think this would be amazing with age on it."
"App. - 4.5, Smell - 3.5, Taste - 4.0, Mouthfeel - 4.5, Drinkability - 5.0"
"Great offering from my new best friends in MA....welcome!"
"Drinkability: I would love to try this on cask, but other than that I can't imagine myself having this again. It's so hard to even swallow."
"I need this one in much smaller quantities than the 22 oz bombers in which it is sold. I'll take some 12% beers before this one. I had the opportunity to try the chipolte pepper-infused version of this a few months back- it can certainly hold up to the brewer twisting it that way. Very flavorful, but recommended in small doses."
"Very thick and still feeling with some burnt bitterness, burnt black chocolate, face flushing alcohol heat, low acidity coffee notes and a hot and bitter finish. Not as impressed witht he flavor as the aroma, but its still a very interesting beer worth trying and definitely worth aging to see what happens to it."
"Drinkability: An absolutely one-of-a-kind beer. ""Strong Ale"" is such a catch-all style in some ways, that it's nice to see a beer that really does live up to that sort of elusive, out-of-bounds philosophy the style suggests. Not one you would drink everyday, nor more than one a day, however."
"Arrogant Tommee?"
"Feel is silky, decadent, and yes, oily. Unless you're Andre The Giant, this should in no way be mistook for a session beer, but for it's pedigree is remarkably drinkable. I'm very glad I finally tried some of Port Brewing's offerings."
"Pours a small head with a smaller lacing and has a great black color. The smell is sweet roasted malts with coffee flavors that smell delicious. The taste is very strong with alcohol and coffee roasted malts. The mouthfeel is a little less than ok, but still ok. Overall the drinkability was a little low due to the high alcohol flavors. I don't think I would have another one."
"Pours a very murky dark chocolate brown with no head, only a little reddish tan foam that quickly disappears. Not sure if the murkiness is because I just received this recently and it hadn't had enough time to settle or if it is normal for this beer, but I like it. Aroma is rich and sugary, a nice rich pruney bw-old ale aroma. Alcohol is evident in the aroma as well, also a hint of smokiness and some coconut sweetness. Taste is at first rich sweet malts, a nice pruniness typical of a bw. This slowly fades to a good size hop presence of bitter and big dryness. A little roastiness and chocolate in the taste as well, a warming alcohol in the finish. Very good beer with some interesting characteristics, I like the murkiness of it and while there are the rich bw-old ale qualities, there is also a decent amount of stout like qualities, esp in the taste. A good hop dryness is enjoyable now, but i will also look forward to a little age to see what is hidden behind it."
"Pours a deep black with a minimal head and a bit of creamy lacing. Smell is mainly malt and molasses with a touch of alcohol. Taste is lightly sweet with a strong malt backbone and alcohol notes. Mouthfeel is chewy and rcih. Drinkability is good for this high abv sipper."
"Pours like motor oil, thick and oily looking. Deeply colored orange/amber head comes up with a vigorous pour. Head settles after a few minutes to a fine persistent layer. Very forward aromas of citrus, fig, dates and dark roast coffee. Very rich in the mouth with a spirity burn up the back of the palate. Flavors in the mouth include burnt coffee mixing with subtle ripe banana flavors. Not much hop aromatics, this powerhouse of an ale seems to swagger and tear around the palate with lots of smoky charred wood and sweet, ripe, dried fruit flavors. The finish is a bit rough, almost bitter. Sadly, the bouquet doesnt follow into the mouth. So much promise in the aroma and not nearly as much showing up in the mouth.. The etoh is a bit overpowering."
"This beer is very drinkable and that's a scary thought.... I suggest splitting a bomber with a friend because this one pack a serious punch!"
"Highly recommended."
"Poured in a chalice a thick black color, not much of a head just some fizzy, some carbonation, no lacing. The nose is very nice of sweet malts, chocolate/toffee/caramel. The taste is awesome of roasted malts, and toffee/caramel. Alcohol is hidden very well, but a nice warm feeling in the throat. Medium body, well balanced brew. Very drinkable, very nice to the style, thumbs up Port Brewing/Lost Abbey. If you can get your hands on some, do it."
"Very dark in color. On the border of being black. No head whatsoever. Low aroma-slight sherry and vinuous aroma but it is very low. Oaky and sherry flavors dominate. Quite vinuous tasting. Small trace of the alcohol. More of a lactic sourness then a bitterness to me. Good body-the alcohol leaves a slight tingle on the tongue. Very good beer-quite interesting. Dont think I have had many US strong ales. Worth a try. Bet this would age nicely too."
"Originally reviewed November 24, 2006. 22 Oz Bottle. Aroma a light waft of distant fresh coffee, dried plums and hints of creamed brandy. Pour of chocolate centered sienna, with orangey glowing fringes and a rim of whitish. Flavor a hybridization of sweet currant malts, heavy cold sweet cream, with a big estery pear, almond and toasted date and walnut bread, with edges of molasses and melted raw sugar. Starts with the dark intro of an imperial stout, but with a full of dark bourbon notes, before hitting balance with an edge of dryness, then falling into a mellow refined fruit of barleywine type character. Nice oaky char, crispy barbeque crust and fading edges of light hop cones bring balance. Expressive all around. Really amazingly delicious with a rich deep sugar content in the malt. Edges of hop bring balance, but acerbic light coffee liquer and candy help too. This is such a unique offering, for walking so many style lines. Regardless, delicious and a top beer!"
"I was very pleased to see Pizza Port enter the MA market, with that I couldn't wait to get my hands on some of their delicious beers. This offering from Port Brewing pours a black clear body probably closer to very dark brown but looks black in this light leaving a thin tan head that disappears. The aroma is chocolate, earthy hops, floural, malted milk, this smells and has characterisitc of a milk/oatmeal stout but lets taste. Wow, so sweet upfront really boozey but under control. The alcohal hits the palate upfront then moves to a bitter chocolate sweetness that finishes hoppy and just a bit of a bite from hoppy bitterness and alcohal. Great job on this one stock up!"
"Drinkability: this is a killer brew. The high alcohol knocks this down a notch but this is a wonderful slow sipping brew."
"A great drinker for a cool nite!"
"Thanks for a one of a kind offering from one of my favorite breweries Darren."
"Drinkability: It's taken me more than an hour and a half to finish the bottle. It's a tremendous sipper."
"Drinkability is very high, really classic brew. Not sure of how it would age but I imagine quite well. Seek this beer out."
"Poured into a large glass chalice, formed an uneven dark skim over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Nary a bubble left atop the surface after the time if took me to type this far into the review, and lacing is minimal to non-existent. Aroma is sweet dark malts with ample dark fruitiness. Taste is dark sweetness upfront, some raisin in the middle, and the alcohol kicks in on the close. Mouthfeel is a bit slick, and the minimal carbonation is somewhat a downer for me as well. Drinkability is as good as most strong/old ales. Have to see what a little age does to this and revisit, my jury is still out."
"Medium-full bodied with light carbonation. Very viscous, as expected. Super creamy. To be honest this is pretty drinkable. You wouldn't think so with all of the strong flavors but i'm glad I have a whole bomber of this to myself."
"Kudos to those that buy and enjoy this beer! Envy that it's in your market and not mine!"
"As deep and thick a black as I've ever seen on any Imperial Stout with a thin, dense burnt orange head. Big aromas of black and roasted malts, with coffee, molassess, and prune notes. Some alcohol vapors are present, too. Damn, I just can't stop sniffing this one! The nose is truly amazing in its complexity. Okay, finally, a taste: dark fruits of unending variety (black cherry, dried Black Mission figs, raisins, and many more), scorched coffee, composted earth, and a gigantic -- and I mean big -- alcohol flavor. The booziness is kind of jarring at first, but with each sip it becomes more and more integrated to the entire flavor profile, without, however, getting lost in the shuffle. Spruce essence in the burps. Chewy barley malt and piney coffee-ground sandwich. Dense, slick, and utterly full in the mouth. Increasingly milder but ever-present alcohol burn. One of the most amazing things about this beer is the way this alcohol characteristic is always obvious but never harsh or distracting. It's actually pretty mind-boggling. A very difficult beer to pigeonhole: in my estimation, it's by almost all observations an enormous Russian Imperial Stout, but the ostentatious alcohol presence takes it a step or eight beyond that more or less traditional style. It's also a little bit chewier and less vinous than most big stouts... Ridiculously fascinating, all told. It's so huge, I can't say I'd crave one of these more than once a month, but its sheer complexity, originality, and straight-up tastiness makes me wish I had much easier access to this than I do. This one's staying on the ""Want"" list. Thanks again for the opportunity, Ken!"
"This beer is so amazingly complex that it's hard to explain. Drinkability is lower because it is what it says - extremely viscous! Really heavy - should be saved for colder weather."
"One of the best beers I've had this year. My first Pizza Port, or whatever this is is not disappointing at all. Awesome!!!!"
"Very complex and unusual beer. Worth trying, and worth buying more than one to be able to try at a second sitting to re-evaluate all the taste hitting the palate. My second sitting (a month later) found this beer to be simply excellent, and I am ordering more."
"Overall, quite a ride. I would happily drink again, but I think there are better barleywines/strong ales out there such as Old Ruffian and Arrogant Bastard."
"The body is very thick, as one would imagine from the name of this brew. Coats the mouth with residual sugars. This is quite a treat. I hope to age the other bottle untill next winter ('07)."
"Happy this has hit New England. Bring on more Port Brewing Company/The Lost Abbey wares."
"Quite viscous on the mouth and chewy. While there was no head, the carbonation was present and overall warmth is the feeling i get. You'll want to be sipping this one in front of a fire place during hurricane big fuck... it's not for the everyday quaff. I'm going to cellar a few bottles of this. Hell, maybe i wont. It's too good."
"This is a pretty fine brew- I'll have to post an update as I think this will greatly benefit from some age."
"Simply fantastic no matter which style this will get pigeonholed into..."
"AL-co-hol! Damn this smelled powerful of sweet booze but not much else on the pour. Good looking like an imperial stout should look. Damn this is serious stuff. Big alcohol with rum cake, chocolate and molasses on the aftertaste. This is one that will spark much debate about the style and whether to drink now or later. I would wait another six months before I drink it again. Serious big boy beer here."
"D: This is one of the most aggresive dark beers on the market. Thick, bitter, sweet, rich...this is the real deal. Pulled off with out being cloying as well. The only thing that could have made this beer better would be a head like on the Speedway or Rasputin. Great beer none the less."
"D- Way prefered the 2nd batch I got to have a taster of. I think it made it a bit more complex and gave it almost a new feel to it."
"Notes: Initially this brew comes across as an American Double Stout. I can see how this could be classified in lots of different category but my take is double stout."
"I absolutely LOVE this!!!!"
"Drinkability was very good, dangerously so. At 10%, it is easy to let this beer get the best of you. Highly recommended"
"Drinkability  Are you kidding me? This is one of the best ASAs on the market and certainly one of the most drinkable big beers that Ive ever had."
"Overall: Lots of potential to be a Classic..but what style is it??..I love the dilemma created by not listing one on the label, interesting to see how the style geeks struggle with that..Russian Imperial Stout, American Double Stout, American Barleywine or an American Strong Dark Ale..well thinking for myself Ill settle with a..aaarghh who cares what I think, just get some!!!"
"Very dark beer upon pouring. 2-3cm light brown head. Smells delicious; carmels abound. Tastes fantastic, more carmel. Barely any trace of alcohol in the taste, I would not have guessed it a 10% beer unless I had seen it on the bottles they sell. Since I am new to reviewing (as well as beeradvocacy), I don't know what else to say. I do know that I typically enjoy darker beers, and I absolutely adore this beer. It is listed as a ""RIS"" on BA, but on the bottle I have, it just says ""ale."" But either way it's really a great beer. If you are ever in a Port Brewing location, i highly recommend at least getting a taster. Fabulous fabulous beer."
"Big body with big ABV and a smoother than silk mouthfeel, I can't recommend this one enough...Cheers!"
"Flavor is of a really dark stout like barleywine with some of the roasted figgy flavors of an imperial stout, but softer on the roast and with more of the caramel hop approach of an American barleywine."
