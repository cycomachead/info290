3.78,-10.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.75,"2009 vintage.  Pours slightly darker than cola with a loose, khaki-colored head that slowly dissipates into a swirl.  Nose expresses some chocolate notes and a slight char.  Taste expresses cocoa, baker's chocolate and some notes of oxidation.  Amazingly, this beer is still carbed.  Body is light-medium in body with an even carbonation, but still a bit too assertive for the style.  There's also a light acidity.  Overall, a little past its prime; however, still solid after all these years.","Jwale73","Feb 27, 2015"

The oak aging creates some more intense bitter flavors, very woody and earthy, dry oak. There is almost a saltiness on the aftertaste, perhaps from the cayenne, can definetly feel and taste the heat on the end. Overall, bold but enjoyable.","OrangeMen","Dec 29, 2014"

The chocolate was slight.  T/It was very thick for a great mouthfeel.  Where is the chocolate?  I only got a slight chocolate flavor.  All I tasted was roasted malts and hops.  The start was nice but the chocolate never really came.  The finish was hops and bitterness.  I let the stout warm thinking it may help develop the flavor but alas it did not happen.  The stout was relatively young bottled in 04/14.  Maybe age would help this mature?  IDK....I would be willing to purchase this again and give it another go maybe with some age.  If I could do this all over again I would have passed this up and not the expresso Yeti sitting right next to it.","VTR","Dec 23, 2014"

Tasted exactly like the original. ""Hops toned down", exactly as hoppy as the original. No real chocolate nose or taste. Smoother in taste than the regular but less Roasty. Same killer creamy mouthfeel. That's the only thing saving this beer. I'd easily chose a evil twin or westbrook stout over this one. I will definitely try again and i would recommend because I am certain they mixed up the labels on this one.","pjkelley82","Beers"

They were all met, and then some! I started by pouring a little into a pint glass. It poured nearly black, as a RIS should, without much of a head. It tasted of cocoa, dark chocolate, spices, and coffee. It was absolutely delicious. It got even more complex-tasting and slightly spicier as it warmed up. The spices really brought out the deep, rich, dark flavor. This is a very high-quality offering, well worth the price.","DanielMB","Jun 28, 2014"

There are other ""Mexican"" imperial stouts that I would reach for before this one, although it's relative availability is a definite plus.","LambicPentameter","Jun 09, 2014"

Aroma was great with some coffee, chocolate present. Mouthfeel was really smooth and did not feel like a thick or watered down stout at all. Taste was enjoyable at first with vanilla and oak characteristics throughout, but the cayenne definitely made its presence known in the aftertaste and very soon overwhelmed any other flavor profiles I was getting in the glass. The cayenne aftertaste became stronger after multiple tastings. A very complex and well crafted beer but unfortunately for me, I was expecting the chocolate to be more apparent and wasn't prepared for the spices to take over.","JayPeso","Jun 06, 2014"

The vanilla was subtly present from start to finish as it melded well with the chocolate bitterness that eventually shone through. Had this been brewed with oatmeal, this could have been a truly fabulous beer. As it was, this turned out to be a solid take on the style that was light enough to be enjoyed during the non-winter months. A great beer of this style should make the imbiber feel like royalty and that was the case here, as Great Divide has another winner on its hands. Take some time out and enjoy it for all its worth.","JerzDevl2000","Beers"

It poured out of the bottle a deep rich black, completely opaque and no light gets through. Poured into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass, it gets about a finger of dark creamy mocha head. The head has minimal retention, but hangs on around the circumference and leaves sticky lacing. The aroma is rich and complex, with hints of Yeti Stout (coffee, molasses), oak, and cocoa with a nice earthy undertone. The taste is equally complex and delicious, closely mirroring the aroma but just that much more flavor. The body is thick and oily and there's a little bite of spice. Despite it's large ABV, there isn't any alcohol esters. This is a world-class stout.","delta490","May 17, 2014"

The spice really sticks around and becomes a little overpowering for my liking, especially for a ""chocolate stout"". Full body at first, then thins out a bit as it warms."" Couldn't have said it better, or as well. Really get a peppery kick toward the end. I usually love a good stout at 50 degrees and up to room temp, but this one got worse the more it warmed. I smell some tobacco in there as well. This one came across very bitter to me also. Maybe if you are really into dark chocolate you wouldn't notice. Reminds me of Southern Tier's Chokolat in that regard. Not terrible, but just too much. Fairly disappointed. One and done for me.","WesMantooth","May 15, 2014"

Some of the oak comes out towards the end along with more chocolate syrup and espresso. Heavy, velvety mouthfeel. This one has held up very well over time and the chocolate is still very present.

If you enjoy regular or oak aged imperial stouts, this will be up your alley and I recommend it. If you are looking for a chocolate beer, this one is sure to bring you enjoyment, but will likely leave you wanting more chocolate. It is only a tease. I leave that to be your choice. I enjoyed the beer and while I do find it to be outstanding, I would probably seek out a different version of Yeti. The chocolate just wasn't present enough to warrant a name on the marquis, so to speak.","teromous","Apr 13, 2014"

Great lacing on the glass. Smells of cocoa with supporting roast, spicy hops, and chocolate. Tastes velevery with layers of chocolate, roast, coffee, dark cake icing, and powdered doughnuts. Excellent mouthfeel with slight alcohol burn aim the throat. I love this beer. Yeti is great and this version simply kicks ass.","jwhancher","Oct 11, 2013"

Honestly, the Yeti line must be the goddamn best-looking beers out there, man. The nose comprises cocoa, oak, roasted malts, light coffee, a hint of anise, and the vaguest possible sense of leather. The taste brings in more of the same, with the anise and leather contributing a surprisingly healthy bitterness to the proceedings, and with the oak taking a stronger precedence than I anticipated. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mostly smooth feel. Overall, a solid offering, to be expected from this line, but the oak is a bit much for me here, especially compared with the other Yetis. Still, a damn fine drink.","TMoney2591","Sep 22, 2013"

Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, oak, vanilla, coffee, light cayenne, light char, light fruits, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of chocolate and roasted notes with some moderate fruitiness; and good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, cocoa, light char, toast, oak, vanilla, toffee, light cayenne, and roasted earthiness. Light amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light coffee, toast, light char, oak, vanilla, toffee, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome balance and complexity of dark chocolate, roasted malt, and oak notes; with big robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and silky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic imperial stout as expected. All around awesome balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roasted malt flavors with cocoa nibs and oak aging; and very smooth and lush to sip on.

Beer is full-bodied, hearty and sometimes sticky, like there's touches of syrup or molasses in there, but mostly the taste is smooth dark chocolate (the smoothness probably from the oak aging which helps). There is some balance as the beer finishes dry thanks to not only a touch of the booze but some bread/toasted malts as well.

There was a milk cream taste built in between so definitely a 3 part taste for me of dark chocolate-milk cream-ash. The booze presence was more noticeable then I expected. It wasn't off putting but it let you know it was there. Overall, this a very good post dinner beer to sip, relax and enjoy. The smell is outstanding and the flavors jive pretty well.

I’m a big fan of chocolate imperial stouts and was very much looking forward to trying this one. Unfortunately, this beer is held back by a fairly rough boozy/acetone quality. The chocolate flavor is a little bit Hershey’s syrup-esque and not nearly strong enough against the other flavors. The nose seems to have some bland citrus pith/pine resin hoppiness, along with strong notes of vanilla and rum. Not much roast in this one. Mouthfeel is kinda up and down - good thickness but fairly harsh and hot. On the other hand, the appearance is superb - wall-to-wall black with a big brown head of creamy bubbles. One more quick disappointment - very little oak character. Can’t say that I totally get GDBC.","popery","Feb 25, 2013"

But I must say the ""surprise"" was a good one. This is a very creative beer, in my opinion. I like the juxtaposition of a dark, bitter chocolate with the smoky oak hit at the top of my mouth. The pour was a rich, smooth black, and the head was a gorgeous and enticing tan. The smell, sadly for me, was a tad ""soapy."" Does that make sense?

Finishes with more charred oak, cocoa powder, warming alcohol and just a touch of cayenne pepper spice that tickles the tongue. Huge full body, that is abundantly creamy and silky. Low to moderate carbonation. As far as imperial stouts that utilize cocoa nibs, this is one of the very best.

Oddly enough, burping after drinking from this bottle produced a hoppy taste which just added a positive aspect to the overall experience of this brew. Well done Great Divide, I highly recommend trying this beer as it was a lot of fun to drink and full of flavor.","CHickman","Nov 16, 2012"

The chocolate aroma is noticed immediately without even getting your nose way in it, some roast as well, but this focuses on the chocolate. Flavor is chocolate, chocolate, more chocolate, and a little roasted cocoa. Less bitterness than regular Yeti, but really good.

The best part of the aging for me is the complete loss of cayenne pepper, I hated that part of the beer when this first came out. This aged one displays a rich smoothness with a mellowing of the alcohol and hops; a big improvement, IMO. The oak is noticeable, but not dominant. This is the best Yeti I have ever had and has convinced me to buy a couple of these next time I see them. It has been at least a couple years since I last bought a Yeti of any variety; I kind of gave up on them after multiple disappointments. I had a 2005 regular Yeti that just didn’t hold up well and the unpaged Espresso and Belgian members did not impress. I really enjoyed it and so did the wife, I’d definitely recommend aging this one.","twiggamortis420","Jun 08, 2012"

Aromas are deeply sweet and darkly roasted, with a touch of Mexican drinking chocolate and roasted coffee, with a hint of booze. Flavors are rich and smooth, with a roasted, dark coffee backbone that has bittersweet cocoa highlights. Woody and earthy highlights throughout, it truly feels like you are eating a big, fat chunk of dark chocolate. The aftertaste is bittersweet, with a dark roasting that lasts through to the finish, which lingers behind with a coating along the palate. Strong, solid brew with heavy flavors, a creamy body, and a good, potent punch.","GarthDanielson","May 29, 2012"

4.17,-1.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Looks like the other Yeti variations - black, menacing, thick, delicious. High quality dark chocolate comes from all angles and actually seems to outshine the intense dark roasted malt characteristics. Coffee and char, toffee, caramel, and a big hit of cayenne on the back of the tongue. All the Yetis are great, but I think chocolate may be my least favorite. The cayenne accentuates the chocolate in the first few ounces, but detracts from the rest of the bomber and even begins to build up a bit of burn at the end. 4-6 oz with dessert or an authentic birrieria would be perfect.","bump8628","May 01, 2012"

I can imagine a neophyte grabbing this beer with similar reasoning and not liking it. I wouldn't buy this one again but glad I tried it.

Well blended flavors of big roasted malts dark bitter chocolate and minty and piney hops that resonate throughout the sip. For being aged the hops are still quite present and unfortunately don't play off the oak, dark chocolate, and malt all so well. The oak covers up some of the sweeter bits I was expecting more of out of the beer. Layered yet blended in an odd way. The lack of chocolate and the abundance of oak really throw the beer through a loop. It's not bad, but it is a strange sensation. More time to age may make this one of the best beers ever though letting some of the oak and hops mellow out letting some of that chocolate really shine through. Some burnt characteristics work well but overall the oak is the star rather than the chocolate. The hops work nicely though as a big bitter finish reminding you that this is a Russian Imperial Stout. I'll see how laying one down goes. Unfortunately this yeti didn't meet the standard 5 star rating. Still very good as a standard RIS though.","jtierney89","Apr 16, 2012"

If I didn't know this was oak aged I wouldn't guess as there isn't much oak character. It's good though in flavor, though the heat is a bit forthcoming. Finishes so creamy and smooth with a lingering mild bitter chocolate sweetness. Overall, not my favorite version of Yeti though still a tremendous beer.","hopfacebrew","Beers"

All this time, look at what's been right below my nose. With a recent scare that Great Divide would be pulling out of my area, I think I'm learning to appreciate them more and more while they are still around. Bottom line is that if you've got a taste for a big bold stout that's a bit different from the rest, give this baby a try. Hell, give all the Yetis a try and give all the Great Divide beers a try. I think the majority of them are stupendous and all of them are at least worth a try once!","matttttYCE","0"

It has some decent lacing looks like an ale fit for a king. The aroma is nice and sweet with caramel undertones mixed in with tootsie rolls, I also picked up a slight soy sauce aroma coming from it(this kind of scared me for a bit). Its taste is just wonderful, its got lots of sweet chocolate flavors mixed in with some dark fruits and is a bit tart on the tongue. It has a nice semi sweet and chocolaty after taste with just a mild hint of alcohol.","vickersspitfire","Oct 23, 2011"

Dark brownie batter and sweet milk chocolate blend well. Subtle notes of oak and vanilla. A smooth transition of flavors across the palette. Rich dark chocolate, coffee and vanilla then creamy smooth milk chocolate. The finish is burnt oak and bakers chocolate bitterness.

The chili comes in on the backend and isn't quite as cohesive as it could be. It's still good tasting though. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than the other Yetis, and the drinkability is pretty good.

4.12,-2.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours black with a fairly developed tan head. Not too bad considering the wood and abv. Smells of rich dark chocolate with underlying notes of oak and lots of malt. Clean and slightly nutty as well. The taste is good, but slightly less creamy or intense than one would think after the aromas. A bit more oak appears on the finish, lending a spicy note, but otherwise the taste is just a slightly more muted version of the aroma. The beer does have a big mouthfeel, with the alcohol detectable, but there is also a late creaminess to mellow things out a bit. Certainly a solid beer.","Georgiabeer","Aug 18, 2011"

3.7,-12.3,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"O: Good, might be better with some age. For me the cayenne was off putting.

4.83,14.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"It pours with a wildly dark brown head and a notably thick body. The aroma doesn't give everything away about the taste, which is a sock in the jaw of chile pepper heat and dark chocolate, with some oaky sweetness tying everything together. The chile isn't overwhelming, but it is a great compliment to the chocolate flavor and the beer is helped along by its thick body and milkshake-ish mouthfeel. Better than a lot of extremely hyped, limited imperial stouts out there. Give me this and Ten FIDY and I'll be happy to leave the Dark Lord for you.","mfunk9786","Aug 02, 2011"

It tastes of rich milk chocolate, roasted coffee, cream, has a light bitter bite and finish with a light chile like tingle. The chile aspect lingers in the aftertaste but is really pretty subtle. I'd say it's barely even noticeable. If I hadn't been told to look for it I may have never noticed it. It drinks thick and full in body with a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel.

For such a dark stout, and one that is barrel aged, we were not really expecting the bright hop components here and there. Above all, what was most surprising in this regard was the cayenne pepper. While other beers will utilize such intense ingredients it is hard to find a brew with this so masterfully integrated, yet starkly independent throughout the tasting. This is truly a unique beer, standing way out from the rest of the style.","TheBrewo","May 31, 2011"

As mentioned this is a bit harsh right now yet I was worried that the Chocolate and other flavors might begin to fade so I decided to try this reasonably ""fresh."" (for a big stout anyway) Not sure if it is the cayenne or what but there is an itchy, spicy tingle in the back of the throat and I'm still not done with this beer.

3.96,-6.2,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"o- A very good chocolate stout, and the oak aging helps it to be more complex than other chocolate beers. However, I think the oak is slightly overdone in this beer.

Pours as thick and black as motor oil with a creamy, caramel-colored one finger head with great lacing and decent retention. Roasted malt and dark chocolate dominate the awesome nose with hints of vanilla, oak, burnt espresso, and alcohol. The taste is much the same. Roasty malt, dark chocolate, vanilla from the oak, and an awesome bite from the cayenne. It doesn't get much better! I'm a huge fan of chocolate and hot peppers so this is right up my alley. Had no idea when I bought it that it had the cayenne pepper in it. Although lots of reviewers have criticized it, I find it a welcome and unique twist. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy with a nice bitter finish. The cayenne is subtle at first, but really stands out as it warms. A very surprising and unique beer that I will definitely seek out again.","beerdrifter","May 09, 2011"
4.15,-1.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"This is a wonderful, luscious, and full flavoured RIS that could have been so much more had the cayenne peppers been toned down. I do like how they further the roasty and dry characteristics of the beer but it becomes a bit too much as I continue sipping it. Although it is detectable, the chocolatey sweetness struggles to take center stage throughout with the spiciness demanding attention almost from start to finish. This is still a great RIS nonetheless and I would love to see how this ages.","ludachris","Beers"

4,-5.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured opaque black with a nice finger of tan head that receded to a tiny film. Roasted malts and chocolate in the aroma mostly. Very roasty malts on the tongue, with dark chocolate and some bitter coffee, vanilla and oak in the background. Alcohol is moderately noticeable and there's a slightly bitter aftertaste. Medium-heavy mouthfeel, and very drinkable as a session ender.","Rifugium","May 08, 2011"
3.88,-8.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti pours an impenetrable black. About two fingers of caramel head come together to top the beer, which seems to be a lot for this glass. Retention is good, the last bit of foam never quite fades, but lacing is underdeveloped. The nose is a bit straightforward, gobs of milk chocolate with a hint of roasted grain. A lack of complexity can at least in part be made up for by potency, but the aroma isn't anywhere near pungent enough to pull that off. Once the beer warms though, a bit of the cayenne pepper becomes a welcome addition. The rich chocolaty flavors almost completely override the bitter roasted grain on my palate. Oak aging is barely appreciable, aside from maybe some vanilla contributing to the milk chocolate notes. Due to the initially muted aroma, I had forgotten about the cayenne added to the beer, but it's present from the start. It's barely noticeable up front, but slowly builds to a fairly peppery close. The heat is a bit intense at first, but as the beer finishes warming the rich milk chocolate extinguishes some of the burn and the cayenne settles down to a perfectly mild complementary note. I'd say the first half of the bottle rates about a 3.5 for taste and the second a 4.5, just from the variation in prominence of the cayenne, and so the beer as a whole ends up in the middle. The body, while creamy and smooth, is not as rich as I might have expected. That may be for the better though, as it seems the carbonation struggles at times to cut through the beer's maltiness. The end result though is a mouthfeel that's decent, but not as decadent as I might have anticipated. Overall Chocoloate Oak Aged Yeti was a solidly enjoyable drinking experience, especially once I got to the second half of the bottle. Between this and Hunahpu's, chillies are becoming one of my favorite additions to a stout.","axeman9182","May 07, 2011"

It's interesting to see that they added cayenne to this beer as I think that it would be great even without it. Mouthfeel is super thick and creamy with low carbonation.

You get a great amount of coco nibs coming at you in the nose. I didn’t get much in the way of wood or barrel at all I even asked another Geek with me and he couldn’t pull any either I think the coco is just that strong. The flavor was perfect for a chocolate stout. This one is done right. The brew wasn’t sweet milk chocolaty but reminded me of a good piece of dark chocolate with a little pepper spice thrown in. It had a great mouthfeel to it thick and coating on the tongue.

The smell at first is over powering of chocolate but smells awesome. Once you get around the chocolate there is roasted malt, some coffee and just a little bit of vanilla behind all of that. Pretty typical of a big imperial stout except with loads more chocolate in the smell. Despite all the chocolate in the smell the taste kind of threw me off. Still quite chocolately obviously, and the chocolate is right up front. There seems to be a bit more coffee in the the taste that comes out after the chocolate. The vanilla is a bit more apparent as well rather than hiding in the back like I had in the smell. A little burn from the alcohol but nothing that throws the flavor off. The mouthfeel is semi thick and a little chewy. As for drinkability, it's pretty easy to drink even with a ABV of 9.5 (which isn't to bad for me) and with a little burn of alcohol. Probably wouldn't do two of these in a night but I wouldn't put it past me. Overall really good, another good Yeti from Great Divide.

I definitely picked up a nice chocolate and roasted malt aroma. Not much hops in the nose. What there is a lot of, though, is cayenne. I'm not complaining because I enjoyed it but I'm not sure why they would have added this to the beer. The taste was much like the smell. Nice chocolate and roasted malt up front. Then the cayenne kicks in. Its not horrible by anymeans...mainly because I really enjoy the taste of cayenne but it seems very out of place in this brew.

In the nose the sweetness of the milk chocolate triumphs over the otherwise formidable roast, coffee beans, grilled nuts, toffee, comes on with oatmeal, wheat and raw grains, more hoppy kick apparent as it warms, little to no presence of fruit or citrus, seems to want to make sure they were not kidding with the word ""chocolate"" on the label. Full-bodied, here you find that missing kick, a first tastes like chili pepper infused chocolate. Sweetens some as you acclimate, but not much, more cocoa to mocha than chocolate, dusty texture. Roasty coffee takes down any caramel or toffee notes. Carbonation is demure, not absent but there are periods of inactivity. Maybe, just maybe, some orange peel otherwise, again, no fruit nor citrus. The hops add more punctuation than narrative and, really, with all that spiciness it is very hard to gauge the hop nuances, your mouth is kinda, err, on fire.

The smell is somewhat vague but as it warms a bit it gets pretty interesting. BURNT dark chocolate is heavy on the nose, and I can't think of any other way to put it but it smells like weed to me. Very sure of it. Very complex scent. Tastes somewhat like it smells with a bit more hop presence and some nice hints from the pepper, adds some complexity, but once again there is a hint of marijuana in the taste as well. Strangest flavor combination I may have ever encountered in a beer. Mouthfeel is pleasant and smooth. Good amount of carbonation but the flavors leave some bitterness on the palate.

The beer is actually quite nice and definitely enjoyable over all. The aggressiveness of the oak, hops and cayenne in the finish really helps to tame the big sticky malt character that would otherwise dominate this beer.

The taste of chocolate comes out right at the front, followed by wood and vanilla esters. There are dark bread flavors brought by the malt, bringing raisons and dried fruit flavors as well. The finish is surprising, with a grassy and citrus bitterness, that lingers for some time. A rich and smooth texture, coats the palate, the warm feeling of alcohol hits the throat. The palate is left with dry and arid feel. This beer has a deep rich color, strong and complex aroma. The plethora of flavors, with the heavy and rich texture makes this a must try beer.

This was not the chocolate bomb I was expecting it to be, but rather has just a touch of chocolate and is dominated by the woodsy/earthy flavors of the oak. The cayenne spice is really interesting, and I do mean REALLY interesting...I can't decide whether I love it but I sure don't hate it...Not something I'd drink all the time, and IMHO not quite as good as the regular YETI, but far better than the regular OAY and definitely something to try if you get a chance.","BedetheVenerable","Oct 27, 2009"

The smell is roasted malt, with chocolate in the aroma as well. The taste is of milk chocolate with some hints of vanilla which I am assuming come from the oak. As dark as this beer is, it is not near as thick as other stouts like Ten Fidy, which adds to its drinkability. There is no alcohol detectable in the flavor, but you do get an alcohol warming sensation even though you cannot taste the alcohol. This stout goes down so easy that I could see the alcohol sneaking up on you in a bad way if you weren't careful.

This will be slowly sipped and savored though, you have no choice. I just feel that out of the Oak Aged series I have had so far, this is the weakest.

The lowered hop profile allows the malt to shine through better than in previous versions while still managing to keep this huge beer balanced. The chilis are an interesting touch as well, they amp up the spiciness of the alcohol and hops while also giving the finish a satisfying bite.

If you would have told me it was a coffee stout I would believe you, but it just didn't smell or taste, like chocolate. Two, it was way too strong, the taste of alcohol stood out like a sore thumb - like someone had poured a half shot of grain alchy in it. 3, the mouthful fell short - it wasn't creamy or full-bodied enough to stay with the Imperial Stout pack.

Flavor has a sort of milk chocolate presence, like chocolate milk (more so than just blatant bitter dark chocolate).. There is some bitterness.. surprisingly not that sweet overall. The addition of the cayenne pepper is present in the end of the sip and the aftertaste and adds an interesting little flare. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with a good level of carbonation but it is missing a little bit of something. Its on the border of greatness and a really full, silky feel that you want in an impy stout but at the same time has a certain lightness that could be improved upon.

The taste is amazing. So much going on at once. The cocoa is very prominent, the alcohol is almost burning at times. Bittersweet chocolate is the strongest flavor i'm sensing at first but as it crosses the palate, coffee and dried fruit, molasses, burnt sugar are all present.

And rush in it does, as spicy, dark chocolate liquor kisses the back of the throat with a delicious hint of oak. The pepper is a decidedly amazing touch, adding a slow, succulent burn to the roof of the mouth with each sip. Luxurious mouthfeel, creamy velvet with a tight, prickly carbonation level and boozy finish. My only qualm is that the mouthfeel and drinkability degrade slightly as this beer warms, a phenomenon which should be the reverse for a beer of this caliber.

The oak and alcohol carry into the finish where it meets up with the smooth chocolate in the aftertaste. For me the flavors are just about the best I've had.

3.91,-7.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall, I had mixed feelings on the addition of the cayenne. It was almost like a double edged sword. On one hand it accentuated the chocolate flavor, but on other it was a tad bit too spicey and left a subtle burn on the palate.","rhinos00","0"
