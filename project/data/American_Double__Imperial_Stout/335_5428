The alcohol is too prominent in the beer and the milk stout and bourbon barrel favors disagree with one another making for beer that I won't have again. This is a personal taste note, so that being said, milk stout lovers will probably find this to be a welcome change in a new direction from New Holland brewing.","good-friar","Feb 10, 2015"

3.97,-0.7,4,4.5,3.75,4,3.75," The flavor profile is quite intense, very complex but poorly balanced.  Bourbon dominates throughout, resulting in the complex flavors being reduced to subservient roles.  It begins with a rush of bourbon that slowly allows a sweet caramel and chocolate to emerge.  Towards the middle, a mild roast bitterness comes forward against a slight bite of tannic oak.  The middle produces a very nice vanilla note.  The finish is dominated by alcohol, with notes of bourbon flavor, and the associated burn at the back of the throat.  As these subside, a sweet note of vanilla and oak linger with caramel characteristics.  Considering this is 11% ABV, they've done a fair job of covering it.  The main drawback is that the amazing complexity is never allowed to truly emerge.","tillmac62","Jan 27, 2015"

Coupled with the fact that this is a year-round BBA Imperial Stout (~$15 4-Pack) and one that you don't need to risk life and limb to procure, Dragon's Milk is a more-than-worthy alternative to all the other 'white whales' swimming about the craft beer marketplace.

Aromas of roast, caramel, vanilla, light wood and bourbon with a faint cardboard. Little to no hop aroma, this one seems a bit sweet based on the nose. The flavor is roasty caramel with hints of toffee, vanilla and light oak. Light fruity notes midway through with a sweet bourbon and brown sugar linger at the end of every sip. Medium body, light level of carbonation. Nice easily assessable barrel aged stout. The oxidation in the nose is a little off putting, but the beer is quite tasty.","johnnnniee","Dec 14, 2014"

The alcohol suppresses some of the more muted malt flavors you'd expect to find in a proper stout, even BBA varieties.","dd43","Nov 02, 2014"

The aroma is Bourbon at first followed by some oak, vanilla, roasted malts, and chocolate. The taste is bourbon and oak. Chocolate and roasted malts as well. Hints of charcoal and earth. Finishes with some nice Bourbon notes. Very noticeable alcohol warmth. Lightly carbonated with a heavy-ish mouthfeel. This is a great year round Bourbon Barrel Aged Stout.

The nose is very boozy up front, almost mediciny, with some slight notes of coffee, chocolate and vanilla. I didn't get the alcohol in the taste, as the malts covered it nicely. A bit of chocolate and some dark fruit flavors lasted on the back end. As it warmed, the chocolate really came out.  I thought the mouthfeel was a little thin for such a big beer. Overall, a pretty damn good imp stout, I'd buy it again! I'm going to throw a few in the cellar to see well they hold up with some time on them.","timontheroad","Aug 29, 2014"

Once I was finished & it had warmed a bit, it showed a multi-layered profile. The most impressive taste to me was the toffee. I've heard this characteristic used many times but it has eluded me...until this bottle. Very smooth with a strange mix of oiliness but not particularly thick. Next time I'll get a piece of sharp cheese to play off the best of this well made brew. Hold the presses...10%? A very deceptive 10%.","seedyone","Aug 16, 2014"

He gave me a couple samples (30 beers on tap) and I loved this one especially for the bourbon finish.

This is a beer with a 10% alcohol content and you taste it but that's not a negative. Very smooth, velvety mouthfeel. Hints of the bourbon barrel aging are very noticeable but not overpowering. Hints of roasted caramel and some vanilla as well. A very strong flavored beer as you would expect from an Imperial Stout. Not an easy drinking beer because the favors are so powerful but very good. I'll probably enjoy it more in tHe winter but it's definitely on the list to buy again.","bluedognever","May 31, 2014"

However, for the price (outside of MI) it probably does not warrant a higher rating. I don't even consider comparing this to BCBS which to me, is a bourbon barrel aged stout unto itself. So, I would compare this more closely to Fegley's Insidious bourbon barrel aged stout: a more comparable, lower level version of the style. After trying both, I'd recommend getting your hands on the Fegley's first and then the Dragon's Milk. I understand there are many fans of this beer. But I would not buy a 4 pack at the price I paid ($16) again.","Donco","Apr 29, 2014"

The taste is really wonderful it starts with chocolate and vanilla and ends with whiskey, coffee, and warming alcohol. The alcohol taste is present, but that really should be expected when you age something in bourbon barrels for long enough. The mouth feel is lighter than a lot of imperial stouts, but not thin. Overall, I would drink a KBS or a backwoods bastard first, but due to their low availability this is definitely a go to bourbon barrel stout. I will be drinking this one again.","WKyle","Apr 26, 2014"

Anyway-don't be scared at the high 4 bottle price as it's well worth it (pairs great with a thick cut grilled T-Bone BTW). If your local craft pub has this on draft - even better.

The smell is reminiscent of plums, chocolate milk, molasses, and sun-dried raisins. The syrupy, above medium mouthfeel adheres to the tongue. Sun-dried raisins, figs, bourbon, and chocolate milk compose the base flavors. This beer gave me goosebumps. The look, texture, and taste reminded me of Pedro Ximenez sherry, the main differences being that the wine is sweeter and thicker and lacks the malty grains.","SylviaFaye","Feb 09, 2014"

This is one of the best bourbon barrel aged stouts I've ever had and you can check my track record to verify that I've had some of the best. Maybe the fact that it is so smooth and hides its char, oak and ABV well is why some people aren't down with it. Not enough in-your-face extremity. If you want a well-balanced, smooth and drinkable BBA stout, this one's for you.","Immortale25","Dec 18, 2013"

Tastes of wood, bourbon, dark dried fruits, dark chocolate, sweet malt and did I mention wood? A little sweet maybe and quite boozy, but enjoyable. Mouthfeel is hot with alcohol and medium of carbontation. Not bad. Overall, this is very good, but lacks some of the complexities of other robust stouts. A good, but not great imperial stout at a good price. I might revisit this one again soon, but it would depend on the availability of other stouts.","SFNC","Dec 13, 2013"

(I settled for their Coffee Stout, which is also excellent.) Dragon's Stout is comparable. Delicious, full-bodied. Outrageously expensive, perhaps, but comparable to that on draft at Central Waters. The 10% alcohol content is shocking for a stout, which one expects to be low-alcohol and low calorie.","JamesTobin","Oct 29, 2013"

Aromas of rich bourbon notes, vanilla highlights, boozy highlights, creamy notes, and a subtle bitterness in the backbone. Interesting nose, but very heavy and boozy. Flavors are heavily roasted, with a solid roast coffee bitter backbone, heavy bourbon notes, with vanilla highlights and oak notes, and a building warmth as you drink. The coffee bitter notes build, as well, into the aftertaste, mixing with booze and vanilla/oak. Very dynamic aftertaste on a slick, oily body. Roasted and boozy linger into the slick finish. Good flavors, but a bit out of balance.","GarthDanielson","Oct 24, 2013"

The aroma is a bourbon and chocolate with little hints of vanilla. The taste is great. As soon as it hits your mouth you get a chocolate/vanilla mix. The back end is mostly bourbon. It's the perfect combination. The beer is not too thin or thick. It's just right. I actually prefer this beer over KBS.","Beechner719","Sep 18, 2013"

I love the deep taste with a bourbon kick!

3.12,-22,3.5,3.25,3,3.25,3,"2012. Pours dark brown. It's lighter than expected and and I can see through two to three inches of liquid to the bottom of my little snifter. Small beige head. Pretty good retention and lacing for the style and strength. The aroma is dominated by sweet bourbon. Stout flavors are sitting in the background, mostly just contributing some sweet caramel and chocolate.. The bourbon is nice enough, if a bit simple. Lots of vanilla and toffee. Taste is similar. Everything about this beer just seems simple and sweet. There's some more nice milk chocolate, caramel, sugar cane, vanilla, maybe a touch of pepper, but little depth. Good deal of booze in both taste and aroma. Mild oak. Maybe a touch of roast in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and kinda sticky. Finish is sweet and boozy. At first blush, I thought this beer surpassed my low expectations, but ultimately, I think my memories of sips at tastings and whatnot were spot on. It's better than Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale, which I admit is a pretty low bar, but it's still just a sweet, simple beer dominated by sweet, simple bourbon flavors.","popery","Jul 21, 2013"

Just a hint of the roasted malt on the backend, but you really have to search for it. This is definitely a sipper, and is a fantastic dessert beer. Carbonation seems to be about medium.

At 10%abv, you know she will screw you up if you're with her too long, but you just can't help yourself because after that first taste makes your mouth tingle with excitement, you're hooked.","JDReardons","Jul 11, 2013"

The aroma and taste are almost completely dominated by oak and bourbon. Any roasted flavor was almost completely hidden. It was an enjoyable beer, and I would recommend giving it a try. However, I would not have known it was a stout if it hadn't been written on the menu, and since I was expecting a stout, I was a little disappointed.","jtladner","Jun 15, 2013"

But in spite of that, I'm going to do my very first review here after a year or so of reading all of everyone else. Mouthfeel is nice and thick but to me, which I love. But that 10% ABV is right up front - as is a bit of that bourbon barrel flavor. Everything about the rest of this beer stands behind that. Not that I don't like my hefty ABV - just I think you have to like bourbon, or at least be warm to it, to really enjoy this one. Still glad I bought it.

A nice oak presence reminds me of a bourbon barrel aged brew and has a nice dry crispiness to it. The beer is fairly roasty but has a strong toffee and burnt caramel presence to it. It is fairly sweet and sugary. A nice chocolate presence from this beer. There is a portion of this beer that reminds me of and English stout like Samuel Smiths but im not sure what the flavor comes from.

Smell - Alcohol, ripe plums, heavy vanilla, maple syrup, over-toasted almonds.... did I mention the alcohol! Taste - Burnt toast, nice roasted maltiness, the high alcohol level is prevalent throughout and comes back strong at the very end warming the throat. Medium mouth feel, a bit lighter than expected. Overall - a lot going on with this stout. Complex and very pleasing. Could be a little better balance between the alcohol and other ingredients but excellent nonetheless.

The initial mouthfeel was lighter than expected as this is billed as from the High Gravity Series and I had expected a maltier (thicker) body. The first taste revealed the high gravity was more at> alcohal content than malt and thus more watery. This can be appreciated in many circles - I recall a friend's college dorm homebrew recipe called ""Beggers Blend"" impressively gifted in a high gravity Alc-by-Vol content that was sought after for any late hours party (it was basically a dextrose bomb). That comment aside, this beer definitely has more craft at work than those creations. The oak shows up in the flavor in front trumpet while the vanilla plays Montovani (cascading background strings). I'd like to see more work on this creation more at> heavier body while maintaining the Alc-by-Vol. It is a nice beer with a great name and crafte base that deserves a little further in refinements.","GoldHorde","Jan 24, 2013"

The nose starts with vanilla and has a heavy dose of oak. A fair amount of booziness is present on the nose with a slight harshness which seems to comes from the spirit. The base beer seems hidden on the nose, perhaps some light cocoa character, but not much else. Taste is is oaky up front and heavy with vanilla in the middle. Again, not getting much base beer here, not sure if it is supposed to be stout or strong ale, but either way, I get little in the way of malt and hops. Just like the nose, a heavy boozy harshness comes at the end and leaves a slight burn. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for the high gravity with moderate to high carbonation. Overall, this beer is a little one dimensional and lacks the backbone that I like in barrel aged beers. It's a nice and easily attainable bourbon barrel aged beers, but there are others I would turn to first.","homebrew311","Jan 22, 2013"

This isn't in that league, but it is quite good, and definitely worth a try. It's tasty, and it certainly gave me a good buzz on a work night, which I needed big time. Glad to recommend this brew....","RoamingGnome","Jan 09, 2013"

It had the sweetness of a Wee Heavy that countered the bitter roast taste most common to a stout. The fact that it drew this sweetness from vanilla was interesting that the oak flavor lent itself nicely to the style. Given it's price it won't be one that I'd grab every time, but I'd say it's memorable enough for a repeat.","flyboy599","Dec 01, 2012"

I really enjoy the notes that the wood adds and really like the nice gentle warm throat burn here in a cold house. This is a sit back and get cozy beer for later at night when things are quiet.

Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, vanilla, and dark fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, caramel, vanilla, dark fruit, and subtle sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I thought with some age on this one that the alcohol aspect would be completely gone. On the flavor that was definitely the case. However on the flavor there was still a nice little kiss of booziness to be found that was rather surprising at first. Once your palate adjusted to this though it was really quite nice to have a touch of heat to this one. It was fairly well balanced with just a hint of roastiness but more sweetness with the vanilla and caramel going on. A really well done brew that I would suggest anyone to try at least once.","thagr81us","Nov 06, 2012"

This is a beer for fans of big ABV beers, but also a beer for fans of BEER. This brew is fantastic and worth every penny you will spend tracking it down. Worried about paying $5 shipping to get a big bottle of this? Dont. Just order it and order it now. Paradise awaits. WARNING: the ABV in this baby will creep up on you and knock you off your perch.

(I don’t know what style New Holland Brewing was trying to make with this beer, but to me it seems like a barley wine – and, a darn good one at that.) The focus is on the roasted malt flavors – chocolate sweetness, dark chocolate, and dried fruits. And, the oak helps balance the malt and adds some complexity to the flavor profile. There is also some booziness that works well here – it does not get into alcohol heat, but remains at just a touch to add balance and complexity. This is definitely a must try for barley wine fans.","Beer_Runner","Sep 30, 2012"

Having never tried the Dragon's Milk, I decided it was time...and I'm glad I did. At 10% ABV, I expected the alcohol to be over-powering and make the beer tingy. Not the case at all! It was very smooth for a stout and the oak aging came out in full vibrance. The only way I would have guessed that it was 10% was the fact that I could feel a slight buzz from 1 beer.

Milk chocolate and roasted coffee with a huge molasses and wet oak kick in the rich, textured aroma. Enormous boozy punch with caramelized brown sugar and tons of rich roasted malts; very barley-wine-like. Bittersweet milk chocolate, espresso bean, and oak are all solid components of the body. Boozy, tangy mouthfeel. Overall a really great brew, just a little shocking to the palate.","YouSkeete","Jul 02, 2012"

4.1,2.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly pitch black color with a small 1 finger tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some light spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big oak, vanilla, toast, earth, roasted malt, licorice, molasses, dark fruit, and light bourbon. Very pleasant and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, oak, vanilla, toffee, molasses, toast, dark fruit, and light bourbon. Minimal bitterness; with lingering notes of vanilla, molasses, caramel, toffee, oak, roasted malt, dark fruit, and light bourbon on the finish for a good bit. Nice flavor complexity and balance; with no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel this is quite nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed on the finish. Definitely a moderate sipper at 10%. Overall this is a really excellent oak aged beer! Very nice complexity and flavor balance; and quite smooth for the alcohol level. I know for a fact that older bottles of this turn out fantastic as well. Really enjoyed this one.","superspak","Jun 24, 2012"

Pours black with heavy bourbon and vanilla notes. Tastes like those root beer barrell candies, vanilla and bourbon on the finish. Very warm alcohol. A bit sweet for my tastes, and mouthfeel is rather thin for a stout, especially one with that Imperial name in it. Would like to try and rerate this later. Strange, but extra points for its uniqueness.","BMMillsy","Mar 09, 2012"

This is a real one directional aroma. The taste tells the same story: too much wood that somehow brings some chocolate to the table.

A perfect balancing act of malt sweetness, bitterness, and smooth alcohol, Dragon's Milk is great fresh and even more complex and deep with extended age.

3.68,-8,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"2011 Vintage. Pours black that appears dark red when held up to the light. Very tiny tan head that disappears very quickly. Scent is initially very heavy on the dark fruit side. Very sweet dark fruits. A hint of chocolate and tobacco as well. Smells extremely sweet. Taste is initially sweet dark fruits with just a bit of delicious bourbon flavor. Nice chocolatey notes with vanilla and molasses. Very very sweet. Mouthfeel is a little more than than I would have liked. Drinkability is fair. Alcohol is well hidden. Overall, this beer is delicious, but it's just delicious in small amounts. I will definitely be able to finish this 12oz bottle, but couldn't drink more. A little too sweet. Also, I think this one would be more accurate at being classified as a barrel-aged quad. The dark fruits are much more overpowering than chocolate or coffee.","DovaliHops","Dec 06, 2011"

4.24,6,4,5,4,4,4,"Nice Beer! Much better than I expected. It pours a dark, reddish-brown that's nearly black. The head is a medium-tan, although it falls somewhat quickly. The aroma is what makes this beer so enticing. It's woody, smokey, and has a huge, intense vanilla note. Wow. Strong malt, and a roasted-nut scent behind the wood, this is complex and very rewarding to sniff. Alcohol is folded into the aroma as well, with a brandy-like boozy-ness. The taste is drier than expected with a lot of warmth and malt. Roasted notes, and a bit of grain. Medium in body. This is good stuff.","Suds","Oct 28, 2011"

It's hard to find too much wrong with this beer, but I'll try. For one thing, I didn't particularly care for the cola flavor. Second, at this price I would expect a bit richer flavor.

3.03,-24.3,3,2.5,3,4.5,3,"Overall I have to say that this is a pretty average beer, but I still find some quality that I really like about it, but as a whole it's just average. My main beef with this beer is that it just isn't as roasty as a stout should be, if you market something as a stout it should have a good amount of roast to it, with that missing it lets all the other flavors take over and in the end that didn't make it very stout like and if I was given this blind there's a good chance I would think this is a barrel aged Barleywine or an old ale with a slight amount of roast to it. I did like how drinkable this beer is, I find that barrel aging can hurt the drinkability a lot of the time, but on this beer it really doesn't matter and the mouthfeel doesn't make it too filling plus for 10% the alcohol isn't that in your face. I can see how some people may be turned off by the heavy bourbon and oak presence in this beer, and I think that's because there isn't enough roast to balance it out, but if you sip on it, take your time, and let it warm up you will find that the flavors that the barrel imparted are really nice and not as in your face as they seem at the start. What I liked most about this beer was the mouthfeel, usually I like my stouts thick as oil, but the lighter then average body really works with this beer and find it to suit it perfectly. What I liked least about this beer is that it's called a Stout, it should have much more roast, instead of a heavy presence of dark fruits that makes it closer to a barrel aged old ale or Barleywine. I will still buy this beer on occasion, it can'r hold a candle to KBS, but anytime I want a barrel aged beer it is available, and availability can play a big part in what I buy sometimes. I recommend this to fans of barrel aged beers, but don't expect to be blown away buy the base of this beer cause it doesn't live up to the name. Even though this is pretty much the most popular beer in their lineup, there are a couple other beers from them I would rather have that are lot more to style and better tasting. This was the first barrel aged beer I ever had and at the time it was super robust and big, but after trying much other stouts I find I still like it, but not as much as I used to it and it's much more average then I first thought. As a whole New Holland is a pretty good brewery, maybe next batch you make you can set aside some of those barrels for Pilgrims dole, now that may be an epic beer, think about it.","StoutHunter","Sep 02, 2011"

3.18,-20.5,3,2.5,3.5,4,3,"Dragon’s Milk makes for a fine sipping brew, enjoyed like a fine scotch. I also have no doubt that this beer will age nicely. That said, I find it occasionally overpowering. The esters give you a nice menopausal hot flash on the way down, a sharp edge that usually seems rounded out to me. I almost find the flavors to be numbing - drink this after dinner, not alongside. Again, I strongly argue that this doesn't fit the same niche that a strong ale or stout would fall under for me. The body is too fruity for another style (savory as it may be) and the alcohol content is far more noticeable than stouts of similar ABV, as well as all I've said before.","paperbackfoster","Aug 18, 2011"

2.94,-26.5,2,3,3,3,3,"Booze and oak are a somewhat harsh 1-2 punch to the nose. Gentler aromas of vanilla, toffee, dark chocolate, tangy fruit and citrus linger. The oak flavor is also quite potent enough to be near overwhelming at times. Citrus is surprisingly bold, and there’s a ton of tangy raisin and prune. Roasted and toasted grains attempt to assert themselves, but are no match for the oak. The mix of flavors isn’t a bad one; it just seems that the ratios are way off here. Perhaps a blend of oaked and non-oaked versions would result in a smoother drinking brew. Thinnish body, but fairly smooth with a velvety coating feel. Could be pretty nice with a few tweaks.","PDXHops","Aug 10, 2011"
2.86,-28.5,4,3,2.5,3,3,"O - The appearance and smell of this stout are pretty nice, but the flavor profile is unbalanced.

The aroma is moderate-high roasted malts, some chocolate, vanilla, and oak, hints of warm alcohol, quite inviting. The flavor is a marriage of roasted malt, bittersweet caramel and dark fruit upfront. These flavors are quickly swept clean by a pleasantly strong oak flavor that lingers well after the swallow and continues to emerge as the ABV warms my palate and belly. The carbonation is medium and body full. Overall this is a well made brew with a pronounced oak flavor -- a great beer to sit, sip, and enjoy the flavors of roasted malts and oak.","uwmgdman","Aug 05, 2011"

3.38,-15.5,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Dragon's Milk pours a solid black, with a foam crown that's just a slightly lighter shade of tan than I'm used to seeing in an imperial stout. The head comes up to about three fingers in height, and has solidly above average head retention. There's a solid ring of lacing at the top of the glass, but everything below that is a bit spotty. The nose definitely shows off the oak barrel aging. A prominent dark chocolate malty note is sweetened up by some vanilla sweetness from the oak. A straight oak woody note is also present, a little bit too much so even. The flavor features those same sweetened chocolate and oak notes, but the woody aspect of the beer is even more prominent. I can close my eyes and easily picture a piece of oak just floating in my glass. The body is solid, sturdy, but not as full as I might have anticipated given the ABV, and it's paired with a nicely subdued level of carbonation. Either aging in straight oak isn't the best idea, or this one was just left in the barrel for too long, but the woody character in this beer is just off the charts.","axeman9182","Aug 02, 2011"

I’m not quite sure what went wrong here. Perhaps one brewer wanted to make an imperial stout and the other wanted to make a quad, so they just made both, blended them, and threw it all into oak barrels as a band aid. Whatever happened, it didn’t quite work out all that well, and it certainly didn’t quench my thirst for a stout. Dare to be different, I guess. Glad to have finally been able to try this one, but I’ll pass on it in the future. Thanks for the fun trade boatshoes.","Jeffo","Apr 13, 2011"

I came back to this beer after a couple years because I did not enjoy my first experience, but my palate has matured so I gave it another go. All in all, I think it's too much. There is a lot here to satiate, but there is also a lot left to desire. I have little to no experience with aging beers, but I would guess this could use some.","CMB2012","Apr 11, 2011"

I don't think barrel aging changed anything in this regard and, therefore, considering the relative absence of roast and coffee, couple that to the prominent dark fruit and chocolate notes, and this beer tends more toward a Baltic porter in my mind.

It had way too much of an alcohol/cough syrup type vibe and the combo of how sweet it was with the alcohol and I can see getting sick after a few of these. Almost no head on the pour and after a minute, there was no head at all and the beer comes off as 'flat'. Avoid this one.

Maybe it's the name, but the beer does seem to have a milky or creamy texture. It is thick, but not syrupy. Nice sharp, extra fine carbonation, not wishy-washy and somewhat flat like some dark/stout-ish beers. It is not a stout, but the similarities are obvious. The 9% ABV is noticeable, but not overdone. It's an added bonus that the beer is so good and with the ABV being so high just one or two is a full serving of this stuff (it is expensive). If you have access to this, it is a must try. It won't be for everyone, but if you like stouts and rich specialty beers, this is one you won't soon forget.

The nose comprises oak, vanilla, what seems like bourbon, chocolate, and cheesecake. The taste follows exactly, with the cheesecake nearly dropping out altogether, the oak gaining some strength, and a drying booziness invading the start of the aftertaste. The body is pretty hefty, with a light carbonation and a thick, chewy feel. I've had previous vintages of this and have been underwhelmed.

I was thinking something along the lines of motor oil, and this was far from that. The smell was very appealing, there was some nice coffee, vanilla, and dark fruit.

The taste is big on vanilla and oak with caramel and hints of chocolate. The bourbon is also there in the flavor but not as strong. Perhaps it is the strong vanilla that is making me think it was aged in bourbon barrels. Whatever. The flavors are smooth and are in balance. Some fruit notes pop through in the end.

In the nose oak barrels is no lie, explosive coconut custard, butterscotch, caramel, chocolate covered raisins, maple syrup and just about anything else bearing a familial resemblance to the aforementioned, plums, prunes and maraschino cherries to boot. Medium-bodied, the low carbonation does little to fend off it soaking in like an anchor. Boozy, here you get another blast of vanilla fudge, butterscotch, caramel, coconut, licorice, etc. The cherry fruit has a cola edge to it like Cherry Coke, then slides you date, raisin, prune flavors.

Heavy mouthfeel, with a slight sticky-sweet taste left lingering on your lips. My only complaint is that I got almost no head with very little lacing even with a vigorous pour.

Less than a finger of tanned head produced despite a fairly aggressive pour. Spotty amounts of lacing cling to the glass and it has fair retension for just a thin layer on top of this beer supported by rising bubbles of carbination. Nose is a big bold slap of woodsy oak character that is a little musty with alcohol, dark sugary sweetness and vanilla all coming into play before the usual toasty grain character of stout. Taste is really no surprise after taking in everything the aroma as to offer. Flavors include literally everything that the aroma presented: oak, alcohol (more in warmth factor than in taste but the taste is clearly there as well) bitter chocolate, and slight dark fruity sweetness like plum. Finishes bitter, but more like a burnt grain kind of bitter than a hop bitter. It has a chewy mouthfeel that clings to the palette and doesn't let go. Overall I really enjoyed this beer. It has a very enjoyable and complex nose and taste. The only thing I found a little distracting was the musty character in the aroma.

Tastes of roast and chocolate, with hints of green hops that impart a medium bitterness, vanilla, and a mild, but ever-increasing oaky aftertaste. A little alcohol flavor as well. The body starts a bit thin, but becomes a bit creamier as it warms. It comes across as an oaked-up stout that is tasty for sure, but a little rough around the edges.

The nose is roasty malts, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, molasses, and a note of alcohol stiffening everything up. Flavor is pretty much a reflection of the nose- sweet dark malts, notes of dark fruit, and chocolate balanced by espresso bitterness, a ghost of herbal hop and a rummy nip of alcohol. Mouthfeel is round and smooth, with that tang of alcohol (8% by volume) keeping things from getting fuzzy.

It was immediately my favorite beer and I now buy any ""American Strong Ale"" or dragon labeled beer out of tribute to this beer and to see if any other is even close to this.

Oh wait, no I haven't it's just that Dragon's Milk has such an average taste that you'll swear you've had this before. The beer proclaims that it was aged in Oak Barrels, yet I can't taste it. It's about as disappointing as having a bachelor party in your friends with basement with no stripper. (Story behind that comparison.) The proclamation that it was aged in Oak barrels was the reason I bought this beer and that it was called Dragon's Milk, that's cool. You know how hard it is to milk Dragons?

There are no lingering flavors or coatings, which would be fine if it where a lighter beer. This was one of my segway beers, helped me appreciate better beer.

Taste was excellent. Robust ale flavor that was complimented even more by the oak. I actually like the use of American oak here instead of a bourbon or whiskey barrel. This beer tasted like an ale aged in a barrel, and not an ale aged in Jack Daniels. The beer flavor stood out, and not the liquor. Quite a nice change of pace from the last couple of barrel aged beers I've sampled. Mellow and easy to drink, tons of flavor. Even my wife liked it a lot.

OK, starting to warm now, some sweet, light fruity aroma starts to come out, some whiskey-ish alcohol, red grapes, and light chocolate. Flavor is a little strange to me. There's some very light, almost watery chocolate flavor going on, definite oakiness throughout, and a grassy, earthy component in the finish. There's the grape flavor again. What the hell is this? I'm starting to get a stale red wine flavor in the aftertaste. Ugh, this thing finished bad. It's very light bodied for the color. Maybe I just don't like it because it's dark and expect it to drink like a stout or a porter. It tastes more like a doppelback fermented with ale yeast and aged in oak.

In the nose, you can gather right away that this beer has spent some time in bourbon barrels. It has aromas of bourbon, toasted marshmallow, vanilla, sweet cream, chocolate, and a hint of spice. I also love the mouthfeel! Nice and creamy, (feels and tastes like there was some lactose thrown in to provide residual sugars) with a roundness and depth that just fills the mouth with goodness. The only downside to this beer is that (at least out of the 22oz bottles) the head is a little thin and tends to disappear quite quickly.

The taste is chocolaty up front with oak playing a much lesser role, just imparting some vanilla and woodiness to the flavor profile. Milk chocolate and cream come through.

The smell was a nice mixture of herbal hops and sweet chocolate and toffee. The taste was an extension of the smell with sweet malts being showcased with a backing of hops. The beer was carbonated nicely, and gave a creamy textured feel in the mouth. The finish was quite sweet and would have benefited a bit from more alcoholic strength.

It tasted like aged and refined oak, light smokey leather, earthy barley and rich caramel malt, along with a bit of vanilla and sour cherry hops. It was somewhat thick with no carbonation, and had a lasting fairly sweet aftertaste.

I love bourbon and I love oak flavor, but I don't know if both necessarily need to be in beer. On the palate, it is vaguely familiar of their wheatwine I sampled nearly a year ago. Underneath all the wood, I picture a medium bodied stout, relatively smooth, but not as smooth as a cream stout should be. It finishes like a bourbon and coke with the light caramel and spices dancing with the oak. The oak brings quite a bit of body but the stout itself is lacking, it needs more of a roasted character and perhaps more lactose.

Doesn't smell rich, more like a bourbon and cream. The malty notes are subdued. Lots of flavor, but a little thin in the mouthfeel department. Could use a little more backbone. The flavors themselves are very nice, though with some chocolate up front followed by a hit of bourbon and brandy, a long warming development of alcohol, and finally some malted milk on the finish. Quite a nice sipper and doesn't fill you up as much as Bourbon County Stout, but doesn't satisy as much either. If you don't like Bourrbon flavors stay away from this one. If you do, you'll probably enjoy it as I did.","Georgiabeer","Dec 21, 2007"

The alcohol is warming and presents a tingle upon the swallowing breadth. Somewhat less flavor than suggested by the nose, light malty caramel taste is complemented by the barrel aged flavors.

I was shocked and very happy so you know I had to immediately pick some up. This is exactly what I did. Poured a nice deep orange brown, pretty translucent, and to be honest did not look too thick. A small off white head formed on the top but quickly evaporated and left behind only a token amount of lace, almost none of what was on the sides of the glass. Some carbonation was visible. The smell was interesting, definitely could detect a touch of wood ageing in here, the aroma of brandy not withheld, some caramel sweetness and a touch of grain in the back. The taste was interesting again, almost had like a Cola taste to it, especially in the finish. Lots of oak tastes and a hint of brandy like. The carbonation was rather decent and it drank a lot lighter then I thought it would. It was a tad hot and would probably benefit from laying down a little. Overall this was pretty decent of a night time sipper, though I was able to drink it a bit faster then that. It was nothing outstanding, but still pretty nice if you are a fan of the barrel aged beers. This was definitely detectable and overall probably a pretty fair representation of a barrel aged brew. Worth a try definitely.","mikesgroove","Oct 30, 2007"

This is a sipper but more approachable than a barleywine.","morimech","Oct 12, 2007"

This beer strikes me as a good Scottish Ale and not a Strong Ale. Pours pretty dark with ruby edges. Smells and tastes more on the malty side: lightly-roasted coffee, touch of caramel, carbon, smoky, hints of raisins. Some residual hops. Fairly smooth mouthfeel; not super milky, but like a skim milk. Complemented by a touch of fizz, especially on the front of the tongue. A very drinkable beer. More refreshing when it's slightly chilled. As it warmed (which is inevitable, I guess) the coffee and smokiness gets a little too dominant. Still, I would gladly reach for this one again.","ndekke39","Sep 03, 2007"

Taste is also comprised of a nice balance between some sweet malt with some dry fruits elements as well as some bourbon with nice vanilla notes. Body is about average with some medium carbonation and no alcohol is apparent. I like how the bourbon is present but does not dominate or brings too much alcohol.

Chocolate-dark caramel-vanilla-toast. The taste echoes, although I would strongly suggest giving things a moment to warm slightly and open up. My initial impression with the beer somewhat cold was that this beer was thin & bland. The bourbon-oak is hidden for the most part, giving a background flavor at most. But for my taste, that's fine ... I don't like some of these bourbon/oak-aged things that are more akin to drinking a mixed bourbon-beer boilermaker. Overall, I was quite fond of the beer.

Hint of smoke flavor in it. I've had this beer resently at a festival, and it seemed there to be very young and the smoke/caramel/spice was out of balance, and had not been mellowed by the oak aging. The first time I tried it, my first impression was that it specifically lives up to it's name--it's what I would imagine dragon's milk to be--thick and a little smoke in it. An exceptional beer, even though I seem to be a little high compared to some of my fellow BAs, I drink this beer every chance I get. I'm rating the very excellent bottle I have tonight. I had the same sample at Michigan Brewers Guild as Derek, and it didn't match up to the bottle I had tonight in any way. However, the first sample I had of it at the Autumn Brew Review was spectacular in 2003. If there is a quality control issue as suggested by Malcontent, I hope NH can nail down the issue because the beer is well worth any effort to maintain it in the market.

Now I wasn't going to slam this beer and I truly thought I got a bad bottle but after reading some of the other reviews apparently I'm not the only one the found this sour flavor. This beer is by no means an American Strong Ale it should be classified as a Flemish Imperial Stout if such a thing exists. Now for this beers credit it is interesting but just way to unbalanced I drank shared the bottle with three friends all of who enjoy craft brew including funky Belgians and the like and none of us found this brew appealing.

Yep, I'm smelling white wine, a little vanilla and lots of citrusy acidic orange. Very strange. A taste treats me to an almost overpowering white wine taste coupled with vanilla, chocolate, and a very sour taste. Each time I sip I taste something else, a feeling that is very engaging. I'm not wild about the taste of this beer, but it is damned interesting, enough to give it a higher score than I might have just because it lends to serious ponderance.

This bottle has been in the cellar since June, and I think I am going to have to keep the other in there until then next year to see if there is any improvement. At this point, it is a strange, slightly offensive beer. I started at cellar temperature of 50 Fahrenheit and the beer definately got better as it became even warmer, almost to room temperature.

4.5,12.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This oak-aged olde ale might just be New Holland's best beer yet! Its dark mahogany body is capped by a frothy head of dark tan that holds exceptionally well and leaves clinging sheets of lace throughout the glass. The nose is rich with milk chocolate, caramel, vanilla, wood, a touch of vinous acidity, and mild bourbon. It's ultra-smooth, silky, and medium-bodied but not dextrinous across the palate. The flavor is rich and satiating with notes of a soft chocolate and caramel blend, sweet honey-glazed biscuits, lightly toasty malts, a cusp of dark-kilned and almost roasty malts, vanilla, subtle bourbon, and - oddly enough - some background hops. It's well balanced by a firm bitterness, and it finishes dry with more notes of bourbon, vanilla, wood, and lingering roastiness than it had in the mouth (...blocked by the sweet malts I guess). The alcohol is incredibly well-cloaked; and this one will sneak up on you! Brilliant!!!","NeroFiddled","May 20, 2005"

Very malty, slightly burnt bitter flavor. Very complex; vanilla, raisiny sweetness, well hidden alcohol and a somewhat ashy aftertaste with some oaken sourness.

Pours a very dark color with a small head that dies off quickly and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma has a coffee and chocolate malt character, but there is also a slight sourness as well. The flavor is much the same. There are a lot of the chocolate and coffee notes, but there is also a lacto sweetness. It has a strange acidic bite that I don't care much for.

Smells like freshly crushed chocolate malt, with a hint of the bourbon mixed in. Taste.. slightly astringant/woody tones overpower other flavors going on. There's just enough residual sweetness to keep drawing you back for more. It's surpisingly light and fluffy in the mouth. This is a beer that is a good winter warmer style of beer. Like when you just get done snowblowing the foot of snow that fell overnight, and it's 5 degrees outside.","deejaydan","Jan 22, 2005"
4.12,3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Reviewed from a 12oz bottle on 12/29/04. Pours from the bottle a not quite black color but a very dark brown. A decent sized small tan head forms leaving a few rings of lace around the glass. Wow the nose is quite strong and interesting full of a variety of scents. First thing that came to mind was an odd milk stout hybrid with a strong creaminess and chocolate nose. Also I believe there were hints of vanilla and it was a bit woody. Maybe some alcohol as well but with all the other elements it was hard to tell, either way this is on tasty smelling brew. Roasty malts and a woody oak taste hit you first. An interesting sweet creaminess is there as well making it a bit milk stout like. There is some notes of sweetness and alcohol as well. When drinking this I had no idea what style it was but Imperial Milk Stout kind of came to mind. Medium to full body that is creamy. Very interesting brew here, its kind of confusing to drink with so many tastes jumping out that dont add up to a usual style. Its done well though and is pretty good. Thanks for the sample TikkiGodxxx.","meathookjones","Jan 11, 2005"
4.5,12.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Sweet aroma with lots chocolate, vanilla, and a bit of oak. Strongly carbonated with a touch of lacing as the thick head recedes to a thin film. Bittersweet and chocolately flavor followed by a bit of oak/bourbon taste. Very creamy, great mouthfeel. For a fairly strong beer it goes down easy. I wasn't expecting very much from this beer, and it has improved quite a bit in the months since I first tried it. I just wish I had a few saved in the cellar.","Sixpack595","Jan 03, 2005"
4.02,0.5,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"This beer comes out of the bottle a very dark brown color with a small head that falls to lightly ring the beer. The nose is really nice, but ir reminds me more of a milk stout than an American Strong Ale. I still like it. There is a lot of marshmellowey, creamy tones in the nose. The flavor backs this up very well. Lots of lacto creamyness and actually some acid bite on the back of my tongue. There is lots of vanilla and hints of chocolate malt. I like it. The feel is a little too thin for the flavors I get. Dinkability is just okay. I can't do more than sip at it, but I do like it.","kmpitz2","Dec 26, 2004"

Some very nice vanilla notes. Somewhat toasted and maltish. Malty and vinuous flavor. Absolutely no sense of 10%abv-very well hidden. Nice moderate body. Goes down easy-almost too easy for that matter. Another really good beer from New Holland.

The taste is good with a good dose of malt on the forefront giving way to an alcohol warming on the finish. The ABV isn't hidden, but its not meant to be. However, its not overhwelming either. Well-crafted. A beer to drink on a cold winter's night.","proc","Dec 22, 2004"
3.64,-9,4,2.5,4,4,4,"Smell is gentle and creamy. Some chocolate and a hint of alcohol. Tastes chocolatey and coffee. Vanilla. Oak can be detected, as can an alcohol bite. Some tannin remains on my tongue, playing with the late fine carbonation that persists to form on my tastebuds. Initially, the chocolate is strong, but later sits on the fence between chocolate and hazelnut. The coffee rises later to a nice roasty flavor. The head has settled to a ring around the glass with some lacing stuck to the sides. Mouthfeel is thick. An enjoyable beer. I'll bet 10 years would allow other flavors to rise up to compete with the (presently) overbearing chocolate and coffee. I'll seek out another 4-pack to age, but not for consumption now.","mentor","Dec 15, 2004"

Again, the alcohol adds sweetness and some thickness. Dark, toasty malt, but not too strong. Coating mouthfeel, but with a mild, lingering finish. A pleasant beer, IMO. Oak and vanilla add a nice complexity to an otherwise ordinary brew. Still, worth a try.","winomark","Dec 12, 2004"

3.67,-8.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Dark brown body wears a light off-white ring. Bold cakey smell in which youd have put a pinch too much salt. Original lactic chocolate maltiness, rather complex in the nose, hard to analyze and know what to do with it. Raw grainy dryness chases the potentially fatiguing sweetness. Somehow a powdery cocoa flavor lingers and evolves into a coffeeish highly roasty ending full of dark malts. Smooth round body with soft carbonation. Well contained oak flavors do not attenuate the flavors, not to speak of the totally dismissed alcohol. Worth seeking just because its so unique.","Rastacouere","Nov 21, 2004"

The nose was of dark-roasted malts, maybe a bit of vanilla, with a hint of alcohol. I think the beer was too cold for my first couple of sips... letting it warm a little brought out the flavors better. Taste was roasty malt, dark chocolate, with a little oak wood in the background. Occasional hints of bourbon and slight fruityness were present, also. Finish is smooth and dry, and the alcohol kind of sneaks up on you. Probably one of the more drinkable 10% ABV beers.

Like Ovaltine, literally. Nearly dry, there is nothing astringent or difficult about the drink. Rootbeer, chocolate milk and strawberry soda patter upon the creamy, milky texture.
