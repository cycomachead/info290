The flavor is immense and filled with bitter coffee and espresso along with dark chocolate. Faint dark fruit. It's mostly a big one-two punch of coffee and chocolate but it's done very well. Espresso bean finish. Full, thick and oily feel. Some alcohol heat. Great feel with lingering bitterness. I wish I had this on my radar earlier.","VelvetExtract","Mar 22, 2015"

Beautiful oil like viscosity with only a few bubbles in the middle and spotty in nature lacing.  Aroma of cocoa, bourbon, wood, vanilla, coffee and chocolate.  Tastes of strong bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, some burnt sugar, hints of oak and bourbon plus coffee.  Thick, creamy, and smooth on the palate with just a bit of bitterness and burn in the finish.  I must say I found this to be one of the best Imperial Stouts I've had the chance to enjoy.

4.5,3.4,4.25,4.25,4.75,4.25,4.5,"The flavor profile is World Class.  It is intense, richly complex and balanced to perfection.  Simply, it is a brewer's masterpiece.  It begins with a semi sweet chocolate over a mild coffee background.  The middle produces a subtle bitterness comprised of dark chocolate, roast and coffee over a sweet background with rich malt notes.  As the middle fades, coffee achieves its most prominent flavor aspect over declining chocolate notes and an ascending bourbon background.  As the finish begins, vanilla and oak notes make a short appearance.  The finish is a slow fade of coffee and roast bitterness over a rich sweetness that is both malt and chocolate in nature.  The only trace of alcohol is the nice light burn at the back of the throat.","tillmac62","Mar 13, 2015"

The whiskey barrel aging plays a dominant role in the initial flavor followed primarily by very dark roast malts with a bit of burnt/char flavor.  Also has a nice dark chocolate flavor.  As it warms up I get a creamy mouth-feel, some oak flavors, the whiskey flavor becomes a little less dominant, retains a sweet booziness that is not overpowering but still ever-present, vanilla and more complex coffee flavors.  Medium carbonation with a medium body.  Dark/burnt malts in the aftertaste with some more chocolate layers.

Give it a sip, though, and you've got a lot more than that...especially first off, as warm, woody bourbon flavors comes rippling over the front end. Keep sipping and you see that the palate stays in that mode, condensed, powerful, but adding layer upon layer as the drink goes on: first chewy, chocolate-covered fruit, then crisp, smoky, and toasty (think chocolate-covered pretzel), and finally finishing with the spice of clove and fresh ginger. In all, this is a gorgeous beer. The only problem I have is that, like I said before, it really doesn't expand. It's a concentrated experience, never quite as full-bodied and lingering as other top contenders in its class. But still, just because it isn't the best, that doesn't mean that what's contained in this bottle isn't pure magic. Overall, this stout is nothing less than extraordinary.

I see everyone stating that it is a step below many of the greats. Well, I am going to have to try those as soon as possible, because this brew was exceptional. The Cafe Ibis version was mellow, the CharmingBeard coffee version was more intense. Both were the two best Utah beers I have ever had.","JohnIrving","Oct 31, 2014"
4.1,-5.7,,,,,,"A nice effort from Epic, with some pleasant notes (on the nose and palate) of chocolate, coffee and light bourbon.

4.25,-2.3,,,,,,"Review of 2014 version, approximately 1 month old.  Poured 22oz Bomber into a snifter.  Poured a thick dark black, with a thin khaki head.  Nose  was a roasted coffee blast with sweet vanilla, caramel and toffee undertones.  When cold, strong coffee flavor present, but as it warms vanilla, oak and bourbon burn took over.  Caught a hint of raisin and cherry in its sweetness.  Mouthfeel was full, but not syrupy.  Overall a very enjoyable beer. Very complex, but a step below the "greats".","OneEye78","Oct 30, 2014"

I'm happy to have been able to try this one, but since it's ultimately no easier for me to get than any of my favorite, hard-to-acquire barrel-aged imperial stouts, I'm not likely to have it much moving forward. At the very least, it has me curious to try some of Epic's other offerings, as this was my first.","LambicPentameter","Sep 18, 2014"

4.65,6.9,,,,,,"Picked this up from a great trade with Evan.  Release #12, July 6, 20133.  Thick pitch black pour with a one finger caramel colored head with decent retention and great lacing.  The nose is rich and roasty with huge coffee notes along with hints of dark chocolate, espresso, cocoa, bourbon, and subtle smoke.  The taste follows suit, with the coffee once again being the star.  Hints of bourbon, cocoa, dark chocolate, espresso, vanilla, subtle piney hops, and a touch of licorice.  The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, smooth and velvety, with excellent balance and huge drinkability.  Overall, this is one of the best coffee stouts I've tasted.  Definitely in the same league as Founders Breakfast and Bourbon County Coffee.","beerdrifter","Sep 12, 2014"

My only comment is that I felt the whisky taste was a bit lower than I would like... but I like a boisterous amount of whisky with my imperial stout. This is pretty well cut across the board other than the coffee taking the spotlight. Not to heavy not to continue drinking and enjoying, which is great. I would buy this again, hands down, to really break the craving for a solid imperial stout. Apparently ages just fine, too. It may have lost some of the cocoa nib... but it is still excellent.","Misanthropy_Sipping","Aug 12, 2014"

Terrific. The aromas are bittersweet, with notes of cocoa nib, coffee, vanilla, bourbon, woody notes, crème, and earthy highlights. This smells huge and layered. Flavors are very robust, with a heavy roasted character, solid cocoa nib backbone providing sweetness and bitterness, coffee highlights, a solid blast of whiskeyand booze that supplies a building warmth, earthy notes, and a steady flow of spice throughout. This is a beast. Very layered flavor profiles throughout. The body is robust, smooth, almost velvety. The aftertaste is heavily roasted, with cocoa nib, whiskey, and subtle crème. The finish is smooth, with a subtle boozy edge, and an overall dry, lingering feel. Solid, big, monster of a beer. This was a workout! Fantastic!","GarthDanielson","Jun 26, 2014"

The coffee makes this stout nice and is the highlight here. I always try to drink a coffee stout soon as coffee fades quick and maybe if it was aged more flavor would have came out from it but this is just not anything like a BA Stout. It's not a bad stout by any means but just not anything special that I would buy again. I heard some hype for this and am just not getting it.","TheBeerDrinker","May 10, 2014"

The nose is amazing, freshly brewed bold coffee is oozing with light notes of whiskey and roasted malts in the background. Vanilla and chocolate are also present. Taste matches the nose. Coffee up front, smooth notes of vanilla and chocolate with mild whiskey at the end. The barrel aged character is well integrated with the base beer. Mouthfeel is silky smooth with mild carbonation. Overall, this is an under the radar beer for sure.

Luckily, the coffee and chocolate notes as well as the base beer itself are all rock solid- I just wonder how amazing this would be with a real Bourbon note as well. The coffee is obviously top notch, as is the cacao. You het each in almost equal measure, perhaps just a tad more coffee. The base beer itself shows off a nice roasty note.

While I love coffee in beers this was more of a coffee with beer in it, somewhere? So take my end number with a grain of salt. It poured a very nice black with an off white head that was a little too pop like for me with next to no lacing. The smell was the best part of this beer, it smelled like a coffee shop, lovely. Too bad it tasted like a cup of coffee, very little cocoa and no whiskey barrel. it came across a little thinner than I like but nice. Overall this beer was OK.

The cocoa are way outplayed here and the whisky barrel aging is pretty minimal at best, but it's still really tasty and enjoyable. Take the scores with a grain of salt, as I'm reviewing to the label specification. This is a quality imperial coffee stout, nevertheless. Recommended.","Jeffo","Feb 05, 2014"

I had not been overly impressed with Epic Brewing based on my prior limited experiences with their Brainless Belgian-style golden ale and one of their IPAs; however, the Big Bad Baptist came along and converted me with a spiritual awakening that any evangelical Southern Baptists would envy. The Big Bad Baptist pours a deep dark brown/black with a thin brown head. The smell is reminiscent of freshly brewed dark coffee with hints of mocha and vanilla, but the coffee scent definitely dominates. The taste is more righteous than Jesus Christ himself dressed in his Sunday best. Huge dark roasted coffee notes, espresso, bittersweet and milk chocolate cocoa nibs, creamy vanilla, oak, some faint whiskey notes, and some hop bitterness lingering in the background. It has a medium thickness with some creamy vanilla essence in the body that compliments the bitter dark coffee and dark chocolate notes. A beautiful combination of coffee, chocolate, and vanilla flavors. I would not have guessed that the Big Bad Baptist clocked in at 12+% ABV.

Nose is quite big, tons of very clean coffee with a faint roast and rich malt backbone. Taste is also strong coffee, clean and virtually no acrid flavor whatsoever. The roast is light and there is a nice malt backbone of caramel and rich fudge. Body is quite full with a strong carbonation and soft palate. Finish has some lingering roast and some scorched barrel with notes of whiskey booziness intermingling down the throat.","cpetrone84","Jan 28, 2014"

What's confusing, a perhaps a bit deceptive, is that early vintage listings show barrel aging, but then the barrel designation goes missing. Yet, the bottle still claims it. Is this actually a barrel aged stout? I'm not convinced.","BarrytheBear","Dec 22, 2013"

Flavor still has coffee but not as overt, nice sweet whiskey, clean roast, chocolate. Medium to full body. Creamy. Pleasant alcohol warmth. Not quite as complex as I would hope for but stilt very very good.

Aroma is standard but contains alot as I get roasted and coffee malts, some bready (or biscuit) malts, dark chocolate, hints of vanilla and woodiness but surprisingly not a real boozy aroma. Notice the same thing in the beer - the alcohol is well-hidden in this beer and never leaks out, not even as beer warms and smoothes. In fact, for a "double" stout, this beer is incredibly smooth and easy to drink and has a great balance that seems to actually tip from the dry/roasted/coffee malt notes to the sweeter, dark chocolate, vanilla, hints of toffee sweet tastes (not too complex as I don't get any "dark fruits" that sometimes slip in these beers). Since I like my stouts a little less dry/heavy with touches of more sweetness this beer hit the spot.","clayrock81","Dec 17, 2013"

I don't think this is aged long enough to become very complex and, as it is, remains just a great base stout with some added whisky flavor. I enjoyed how it reminded me of an Irish coffee and I guess $12 for a barrel aged bomber is pretty good. Having said that I could probably replicate the taste for cheaper by adding a shot of whisky to a FBS, actually think I'll try that soon.","PaulyB83","Nov 23, 2013"

When you stick your schozz into the glass you pick up other scents of whiskey/barrel, roast and chocolate. The beer hits the palate with a silk-like quality and the flavors spread quickly throughout the mouth. Despite the 12% ABV there is virtually no burn with the intake of this brew.

Scents of rich black coffee upfront, as it warm dark cocoa comes out and combines with the coffee. It's very coffee forward, but it does bring forward some cocoa. It's a very nice scent for a coffee lover. Taste follows the nose. Rich black coffee, some dark cocoa, rich bittersweet chocolate, slight milk chocolate, cocoa nibs, roast malt and faint hints of alcohol. It's very well done, very cocoa and coffee forward, fitting a beer brewed with coffee and cocoa nibs. It's nice, quite nice, though not as balanced as some other Imperial Stouts. Mouthfeel is thick bodied with moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Quite a nice feeling, very much a sipping beer. Overall this is another excellent RIS. It's much more a coffee stout than some others, but it is quite nice, less balanced but very well done if you like coffee and dark cocoa. I recommend it.","Auraan","Nov 08, 2013"

This thing has a certain smokeyness in the aroma. The chocolate comes out up front in the taste leaving the coffee to play second fiddle. You get a bit of the whiskey notes in the middle of the mouth, in the form of smokey oak. This thing is very rich, lots of bold flavors. The mouth feel is full bodied. ABV is slightly noticeable, but for the percentage it excellent. This one makes for a perfect desert beer or even a late nightcap.

The taste is more balanced, and the milky cocoa and vanilla/bourbon caramel provide a nice counterpoint to the coffee. Nice, heavy mouthfeel, too.","spoony","Oct 13, 2013"

Smells like coffee grounds in the garbage. Getting some rotten vegetables on the nose too, seriously. This smells like a trashcan in a coffee shop. Taste is pretty good, getting the coffee, dark malts, toffee, chocolate, but that damned rotten vegetable composted coffee smell permeates the experience. Mouthfeel is good, consistant with an imperial stout. Overall I feel cheated. I'm not sure if I got a bad bottle or what. Flavors were spot on, but the smell was pretty horrible.

3.72,-14.5,4,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.75,"With so much roast character, the sweet malt character could actually be quite a bit bigger here; to be well balanced, either the roasted / burnt notes need to be dialed back or the sweet / residual malt character needs to be increased. Still this is actually quite a tasty brew and I really like how subtle the Whiskey Barrel character is here; it really only plays a supporting role and could almost be overlooked. I am on the verge of getting a cold & this is certainly a good beer to kick off the fact that I am going to be on a self-imposed beer drought for the next week to recover. Despite being aggressively burnt in focus, I am actually enjoying this a fair amount; it could be so much more acrid and harsh than it is & it somehow is escaping that. I really like that this isn’t overly heavy or rich, on the other hand it makes it easier to drink a beer that is 11.1% abv, which isn’t necessarily a good thing either.","Gueuzedude","Aug 31, 2013"

The coffee plays huge here. Really fresh ground coffee of the very fine variety. Fresh chocolate cake is there also, hold the icing. Very nice aroma. With first sip the coffee dominance continues. The coffee is just so bright and flavorful. Rich and succulent just like that perfect morning cup. The bourbon really is hard to find in this beer, maybe it could use just a little more time in the barrels. This may stand as the most pure coffee forward beer that I have ever had the joy of having. Other flavors include molasses, black cherries and bitter dark chocolate. What more can I say, the flavor, the finish, and the feel are just a coffee and stout lovers dream.

Overall this is a good coffee stout, it's just lacking the barrel that I expect to smell and taste on a good BA stout.

Nice aroma of toasted and sweet malt, chocolate, nuts and a hint of wood. Flavor follows aroma with toasted and biscuit malt, chocolate, coffee, nuts; boozy. Finishes with smoke, toasty malt, vanilla. chocolate liqueur and grassy hops. Medium bodied with some creaminess. A very nice flavor progression and the rich flavor almost covers the high ABV. One the dangerous stouts, it constantly invites further tasting, but the alcohol requires paced sipping. Very enjoyable and well made.","LiquidAmber","Mar 08, 2013"

Strong coffee flavors and not just coffee but great coffee flavors. Two favorite parts of my day are my morning coffee and my first beer and this had both in it.

The liquid as expected is pure black, barely a hint of yellow or orange anywhere, as a result impossible to gauge the carbonation/bubbles visually. The nose is indeed boozy yet also delivers a vast array of sweet scents such as licorice, coconut oil, mocha, café au lait, vanillin oak and a good deal of plum and black cherry fruit scents, produces green apple and floral nuances as well, actually not as punishingly long as it might be and presents itself as gracefully as can be. Full-bodied, average to slightly below average carbonation, not inert but moves like a freighter among ice floes. Loaded with milk chocolate, caramel, butterscotch, coffee ice cream, anise and coconut, it’s like cramming a German chocolate cake down your throat. Not as much black fruit here but also more hoppy bite, on a few sips you sense a latent grassiness struggling to be heard. The orange citrus candied and close to syrupy. Finishes with notes of macadamia and pecan nuts. Lack of carbonation shortens finish but maybe it’s for the best as less monolithic as a result. Excellent beer which just needs some more gym time to loose the flab and tighten up its game. (Release #7)","farrago","Feb 11, 2013"

Some retention, which is unusual for barrel-aged stouts, and even a hint of lacing. The nose is wonderful, espresso, dark chocolate, toasted oak, roastiness, and some whiskey-tinged booziness. The balanced flavor of this brew is amazing: cocoa powder, roastiness, rich dark coffee notes, charred oak, some hints of vanilla and integrated whiskey. Finishes smooth with roasted coffee and dark chocolate. Full-bodied, slick and smooth with some underlying creaminess. Overall this brew is a masterpiece and shows a level of balance rarely found in big, barrel-aged imperial stouts. Impressive on every level.","chanokokoro","Jan 19, 2013"

4.2,-3.4,4,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of a Imperial Coffee Stout, it had tons of great coffee flavors and it was very smooth, but I think it could have used a little longer in the barrel to balance out all those coffee flavors. This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth and it did a good job at holding my attention, a bomber seems like the perfect amount for me, I wouldn't want to follow it up with another one. What I liked the most about this beer was the drinkability and the mouthfeel they were both very good and better than I expected. What I liked the least about this beer is that the barrel didn't stick out as much as I would like. I would buy this beer again when in the mood for a big Coffee Stout, but I won't be buying it often, I recommend it to anyone who loves Coffee Stouts. All in all I was happy with this beer but I don't think it's the KBS killer that some people told me it would be, it's pretty good, but the coffee is a little too dominating, it lacks the great balance that makes KBS so awesome. For my first Epic beer this made a pretty good first impression on me and I am down to try many more beers from Epic, good work guys, you got me to pay attention to your brewery.","StoutHunter","Jan 05, 2013"

I like the uniqueness of the aroma. But, the aroma, in my opinion, just doesn't deserve a 4.5. I note coffee, griddle smoke, and olives. Moutfheel is viscous and slick. Just what I was hoping it'd be. I love the flavor of this one. Greasy spoon exhaust smoke when the griddle catches fire. The smoke begins to yield some to chocolate, but persists, albeit to a lesser degree, throughout the finish. Quite of hop bitterness gets expressed toward the finish, which tends to wake the smoke back up. Just a bit of off plastic flavor that tends to taint so many Imperial Stouts. I hope the smoke flavor in this one was created by the grain and the char of the barrel, not an additive. I really enjoy this beer. It reminds me of Bacon and Eggs from Pizza Port.","DocJitsu","Dec 05, 2012"

The smell of the beer has big amounts of coffee on the nose. It's got some whiskey notes as well to sweeten the beer. The taste is big and bold. The coffee is huge here, the chocolate and whiskey note fall into place in the aftertaste. There is a subtle sweetness in there too. The mouthfeel is slick and smooth. The beer is heavy and gently carbonated. Overall this beer is really good. Found this to be a great dessert after a big thanksgiving dinner.","Knapp85","Nov 22, 2012"

The nose comprises coffee, roasted malts, light dark chocolate powder, and the faintest hint of whiskey. The taste brings in more of the same, with the coffee taking control once everything else runs its respective course. I've heard other batches have been more whiskey-forward or whatnot, but this batch is decidedly coffee-heavy. This doesn't really detract all that much, as everything is delightfully balanced and expressive; I'm just sayin'. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a generally smooth feel, and a slightly dry finish. Overall, a very nice impy stout, one that shows what moderation can do for a barrel-aged beer. Good times, indeed.","TMoney2591","Nov 21, 2012"

Sweet vanilla aromas with subtle oak. A good amount of bourbon whiskey in the nose. Dark chocolate with more coffee and espresso. Such an inviting aroma. Taste is just as good! At first, I get sweet vanilla and bourbon. A bit of a chocolate liqueur flavor as well. Fresh espresso with a hint of coconut and dark fruits. More bourbon in the finish. High ABV is noticeable, but well-balanced with the flavors. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and creamy. Drinkability is high, especially for such a big beer. Overall, I was blown away by this beer.

4.42,1.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, batch 1; bottled 9/22/2011. Pours pitch black color with a small dense tan head with good retention; that reduces to a very thin cap that lingers. Some decent spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of huge dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, toffee, vanilla, whiskey, oak, molasses, toast, and light char. Fantastic aromas with awesome balance and complexity. Taste of big roasted coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel, roasted malt, molasses, toffee, whiskey, oak, molasses, and toast. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, coffee, whiskey, oak, toast, molasses, caramel, toffee, and vanilla on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance of the barrel flavors with the beer; no overwhelming whiskey flavors at all. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a nice creamy, slick, and thick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely fantastic barrel aged imperial stout! Great balance of flavors with the barrel aging; and very smooth to sip on for being 11.7%. This is the easier to find substitute for KBS in my book.","superspak","Jun 09, 2012"

The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, coffee, caramel, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of roasted malt, coffee, cream, wood, sweet alcohol, and espresso. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. I truly went into this brew not expecting to like what I found. Fortunately, I was QUITE surprised! This thing really amazed me with all the flavors and aromas I got off it. They were so intense throughout while still remaining balanced. This one really wowed everyone at the tasting that evening.

4.67,7.4,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"On the first sip, Big Baptist coats the tongue with a well balanced mix of cocoa and coffee. The coffee blend tastes like a quality brand was used, very robust and quasi espresso flavors come through. The chocolate was dark, sweet, and bitter. This made me happy, as I prefer dark chocolate versus super sweet in my beers. Vanilla, bourbon, and oak are present throughout, but become more pronounced on the back end of the palate. The mouthfeel is viscous, yet pleasantly light enough. Baptist drinks smooth and easy. I actually wanted more after I finished my bomber. Overall, this was an impressive beer that I rank right up there with The Abyss, but slightly below Goose Island BCBS. I can't compare it to KBS, as the only one I was able to procure mysteriously disappeared a year ago from my fridge. Yes, I'm still crying about that. Baptist fills a niche that I'm fond of; a beer you want when you can't tackle a bigger BCBS type brew. My first beer from Epic and it will not be my last.

The coffee is dominant through the sip and the swallow, but not in an overbearing way, as can be the issue with many coffee stouts. There is a slight trace of chocolate that is followed by a subtle oakiness. The swallow is a bit hot, no doubt from the whiskey barrel aging, but not uncomfortably so. The rich mouthfeel is complimented by the coffee flavors that wash everything down and stick around on your tongue long after you've finished. Overall this a pretty extreme beer from all angles and it will definitely be too much for some but fans of strong, burly stouts will find plenty to love here.","DonDirkA","Jan 27, 2012"

Aroma is strong and roasty, the brew smells mostly like coffee, along with some roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, and a little bit of whiskey. Taste is mostly like the aroma, there's roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, whiskey, oak and burnt/charred malt flavors all noticeable. The coffee flavor is dominant, but there's more sweetness that comes out as the brew continues to warm up. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy with good carbonation.

Gives off a dark rich roast almost espresso scent. Unfortunately, I am not much of a coffee drinker so you can say this was a bit dark rich bitter astringent. There is a moderate amount of vanilla oak and warm alochol. There is some carmel malt and roasty malt. Mostly coffee mocha and barrel. Light notes of ash, dark fruit and tree bark.

4.47,2.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: This totally blew me away. If you really want to taste coffee AND bourbon in your beer, this is the one for you!","Chaney","Nov 09, 2011"
3.55,-18.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Notes: Blasphemy: in the KBS range without the hype, missing the Bourbon barrel, and with good coffee.. not too good a coffee but a fair coffee… Dunno, it is nice but nothing that I would actively seek out.","Daniellobo","Nov 09, 2011"
3.33,-23.4,4.5,4,3,3,3,"O - Very close. There is just something about the flavor palate that is odd. it is like this brew is fighting itself.","biglite351","Nov 05, 2011"

3.88,-10.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A stout that's both rich and dry... rare. Incredibly coffee heavy. I can only wonder what aging would do.","zaphodchak","Nov 02, 2011"
4.59,5.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Full body, chewy with lower carbonation. Some warmth at the finish. This is certainly a blast of coffee, with some nice compliments. Very nice.","Bierguy5","Nov 02, 2011"

2.77,-36.3,4,2,3,3.5,2.5,"As far as I'm concerned, this needs some serious clean-up. Namely, the coffee is out of control and needs to be reigned in. I hate to be the one to police the Hype Pipe © usage that seems is going on here, but this is far from an astounding barreled take on the style. Perhaps it might improve as the coffee fades, but, at this price point, I'm not likely to pick up a second bottle to find out.","Ryan011235","Oct 30, 2011"
4.05,-6.9,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"4.5 D: A couple categories could have been a notch higher, so this is the score it gets here. Solid brew.","DavoleBomb","Oct 28, 2011"
4.25,-2.3,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"O - The flavors are spot on for a mocha stout. However, the alcohol bite takes away from the overall body of the beer. This is still an outstanding brew and I hope I can get another bottle to see how it turns out after aging.","REDAMI","Oct 24, 2011"
4.35,0,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, it's very much a simple flavored big stout, nothing crazy, or incredibly varied, but just done extremely well. This one is a keeper, this is a winner right here.","smakawhat","Oct 23, 2011"
4.5,3.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Coffee monster here and delicious, big and toasty with hints of mocha, heavy cream, burnt caramel, toffee, plum, blueberry, very light wood, with some bourbon notes late in the finish. Other brooding dark fruits, coffee tannins galore and a smidgeon of vanilla.","mcallister","Oct 22, 2011"
4.25,-2.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"O- This is one doozie of a beer. I think the alcohol is a bit too hot for my personal preference but aging one might take away from the huge coffee flavors. A very nice coffee forward brew.","projectflam86","Oct 21, 2011"
4.62,6.2,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: This is luscious, rich, and delicious. Everything that a coffee, chocolate, whiskey barrel stout should be. Fine work.","Beejay","Oct 17, 2011"
4.12,-5.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"O: glad I got a bottle of this, easily the best beer I've had from epic. A little more bal character would really help, but this is damn tasty. I love coffee forward beers and this is awesome. Nicely done epic. Nicely done.","pokesbeerdude","Oct 08, 2011"
