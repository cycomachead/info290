"2013 bottle.  Huge bourbon smell. Lots of bourbon up front, milk chocolate and vanilla . Medium mouthfeel. Not getting much or any coffee. I like it a lot but expected more I guess."
""
"O: One of those beers you’ll remember long after the bottle is empty. I’m glad to have been lucky enough to have tried this amazing beer. This is a great example of a beer that was designed from the beginning to with the end product in mind. I’ve had many BA stouts where the brewery just through it in a barrel and it just didn’t blend well with the ingredients - this is not that beer. Get this beer if you can. Cheers!"

"AleSmith's Speedway Stout was the first beer I reviewed on Beeradvocate, so it was only fitting that review number 1000 would be the bourbon barrel-aged version. Although I was a bit letdown by both offerings, I am grateful to have had the opportunity to enjoy so many great beers with friends and family over the years."

"An extremely balanced barrel aged brew, but could use a touch more barrel character. Still one of the best BA stouts around."

"Poured from fridge temp to Alesmith snifter.  Look is incredible.  Good carbonation with about 1cm of tan head.  Smell is out of this world.  Lots of bourbon, coffee, chocolate, licorice, and vanilla.  Taste follows the nose nicely.  The coffee is incredible.  The licorice seems strong, which is fantastic.  Marshmallow, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, and blackberries.  The feel is very creamy - not thin at all.  This is absolutely amazing.   Overall, one of the best BA stouts I have tried."

"Very nice Bourbon barrel meets the classic coffee imperial stout. Amazing flavor from the oak and whiskey. Decadent cocoa, coffee and vanilla oak. Probably the best beer of an insane weekend of tasting."

"Overall:  As I tasted this beer I was thinking it must have a few years on it, as I didn't notice, at first, the year emblazoned on the image of the barrel; I generally like my BA beers to have a year or two of age on them to settle down their aggressive elements and to add complexity; the problem, here, however, is that you surrender the coffee influence when you age the beer; still, a very nice beer but I think I prefer the non-BA coffee variants better"

""
""
"Oily syrup in the glass, no foam. Lite maple, heavy vanilla, cassis. Wow. I need pancakes. Fucking fantastic"
""
"Dark thick black body. Smells like chocolate fudge. Very thick mouthfeel. Probably the thickest beer I've ever had. Super sweet. Lots of whiskey taste. If you try to find coffee, you can find it over the chocolate and whisky. Really yummy."

"2014 version. Didn't get a lot if the bourbon barrel out of this."

"thanks to drlovemd87 for sharing another treasure from his cellar. this one is special, and is perhaps the most well integrated use of barrel out there right now. the bourbon doesn't overpower the grain or the coffee, and all the elements are there together, its lovely. just a little froth on top of a jet black viscous base, intimidating in the glass. the nose is heavy vanilla, fresh coffee grounds, and warming alcohol. dried fruit, raisin maybe, and oak are there too, as is a rather dry earthen roasty character. the flavor isn't dry at all though, its sweet all the way through with a toffee and honey quality, and again with the vanilla. the bitterness of the dark barley and the coffee are tempered and counteracted by the barrel, which makes good sense. the coffee isn't quite as robust as it is in the regular speedway, but its role seems more important here. it remains the focus of the beer I think, as much as the barrel character creeps into view. layers of flavor and one of the longest finishes in the business. I love the way it feels, with all this body and slickness, despite being a palate coater. great great beer overall, I would love to try some of the other variants they do with it."

"During my San Diego trip mid November this year (craft beer week in SD was incredible) sampled at the Stone Beer Garden liberty station on draft.  Great BA stout, pretty much like most BA stouts, but this one didn't disappoint.  Would recommend trying if you are fan of BA stouts like myself."

"Wow, this beer is so thick it could paint walls a nice toasty brown color.  It is very complex with many flavors going on.  I especially like the dark roast coffee flavors I get with the smooth yet potent bourbon flavor that warms you right up.  I couldn't drink more than one in one sitting, it is definitely a sipping beer but quite enjoyable."

"Overall (4.5) - A wonderful beer that I'm glad to have tried, and one that I would recommend to anyone who hasn't had it, price tag be damned. That said, the price is prohibitive for repeat purchases, because if I'm paying that kind of price for a bottle, it needs to be one of the best beers I've ever tasted to warrant a return purchase. And it's a well enough made beer that for some, it could very well be just that. But not for me. As such, I will just tip my cap to AleSmith and say ""stout well done""."

"Very nice, super tasty, rich, complex, and balanced while hitting all the good flavor points of a barrel aged stout. Highly recommendable!"

"O -  An amazingly well balanced barrel aged beer."
""
"March 2013 bottle. Still pretty darn hot, and I generally don't mind the bourbon heat. The coffee is still super strong, and the best part of the beer for me. I prefer the base Speedway to be honest. This one doesn't stack up to a fresh Bourbon County, and it pails in comparison to a BC Coffee. Too hot, still. It's very good, but considering how easy it is to get the regular Speedway in my area, I doubt I'll make a huge effort to find this one again when the regular is $12 a 750ml."

"The nose held dark fruit, figs, chocolate, brownie batter, sweet malts and dark cherries. The flavor held true with a bit more brownie batter and strong prune, date and dark fruit. The barrel and bourbon are too subtle. This drinks velvety smooth and coats the mouth well. I'm impressed but found myself asking for more of the barrel."

"Overall an outstanding barrel-aged imperial stout. I wish I could try all my favorites side by side, but this one is blowing me away. Difficult to imagine how it could be much better."
""
""
"This is a most heavenly heavy beer.  Huge coffee and chocolate flavor, bourbon balances it out nicely.  Perfection!"
""
"2012. Pours pitch black with a lasting mocha head. Lots of coffee, chocolate, and bourbon on the nose. Chocolate and coffee on the front of the tongue with hints of vanilla, bourbon, and oak. Full bodied. Lack of carbonation adds to the creamy mouthfeel. Overall, one of the best coffee stouts I've ever had."

"Pours a massive thick black with oily consistency and no head present. The nose starts with a smack of deep roasty coffee with heavy chocolate, coffee ground, vanilla, dark fruit, and charred oak. The taste is quite sweet up front with healthy doses of chocolate coffee and vanilla. The coffee has a nice earthy and distinct profile, the barrel smooths things out. Mouthfeel is super heavy with mild carbonation. Overall, delicious and big!"

"How did AleSmith do it?! Taking an already outstanding beer and making it more succulent and smooth is a difficult feat, but it has been pulled off. Well worth the praise it has earned over the years."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a thick, opaque black with little head. The smell is a sweet mix of bourbon and coffee. My issue with the taste (just as with regular Speedway) is that the coffee seems rather rash and isn't smoothly integrated into the rest of the beer. Maybe with some age this would mellow out. Otherwise, the bourbon taste is very enjoyable and overall the beer has a sweetness that is similar other big stouts."
""
""
""
""
"Tastes of chocolate liqueur, Sabra in a sense, at least the way it used to be :) Rich yet not too rich and with light chocolate and just a hint of roast. Sweet yet not too sweet. Bready chocolate and spice on the moderately lingering finish. Overall very intriguing and I have a few more."

"This pours a pitch black color with a medium brown head. The aroma is ever so boozy mixed with roasted hints of bourbon and vanilla. The texture is thick, smooth, and delicious. This seems to be a lighter, less robust version of the normal Speedway Stout but the flavor are much deeper and more complex. Well worth the extra money if you ever get the chance to buy it."

"Barrel-Aged Speedway Stout is rich with chocolate intricacies but nearly devoid of coffee nuances; perhaps from it's age? It just became available here. Either way, it mimics the others regarding its apparent time in the barrels: short. Not boozy in the least, its robust, full body is demanding of attention but, it screams by like a race car; gone in a flash. Delicious as all hell, this lifts the beer that's aged in the bourbon barrel on a higher pedestal than the barrel its aged in while making both complimentary. Bravo, AleSmith!"

"Overall- A very nice drinking barrel forward beer with a year on it. Highly recommend, though I prefer the Vietnamese version to this one as there is a lot less coffee in the barrel-aged version. Looking forward to trying a fresher version sometime soon, which apparently has more coffee to balance out the bourbon barrel contribution."
"For how difficult this is to obtain, however, it's definitely not the most recommended priority to chase after in the category of bourbon barrel aged imperial stouts. Parabola and KBS are far easier to find, and impart a lot more of the roasted notes that I prefer in these types of beers as they help cut down the bourbon sweetness substantially well. Somehow, this is lacking here, and I really did expect a lot more given the phenomenal base beer that Speedway is. Worth trying, but don't necessarily break your back trying to get one."

"2012 bottle from Adam in trade. Poured Dec 7, 2013. Big time thanks for this one. Pours pitch black along with what looked like some coffee grinds, and a one finger mocha head. Aroma is bourbon, coffee, vanilla, roast, some chocolate, oak, light anise. Flavor is bourbon up front, light roast, vanilla, anise, chocolate, sweetness, more vanilla. Comes in waves, with that bourbon first then the layers of roast and sweetness. Much sweeter than the regular version, and I like it. Silky smooth, relatively thick mouthfeel, low+ carbonation. Sweet bourbon coats the palate and warms the throat."

"O- Barrel-aged Speedway is easily a world class beer however there were some very slight off-putting alcohol flavors that I didn't remember it having when I tasted the '09 at a bottle share. This leads me to believe that this beer improves with a few years on it, developing more of a smoothness."
"overall a real treat to drink. god Damn is this good."

"How many huge beers can we try in a night? This one pours a very deep and very dark black-brown topped by a nice finger of sandstone foam. The nose comprises cheaper whiskey, roasted malts, mild coffee, and a light dusting of cocoa powder. The taste brings in more of the same, with the whiskey still riding tall in the saddle, but not quite as roughshod over the roast and coffee as before. Moreover, a stronger undercurrent of oak worms its way underneath the proceedings. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a solid barrel-aged stout, though not quite as good as the base would indicate. If anything, I'd take the normal, everyday Speedway over this most days of the week. That said, it's still pretty good, just not nearly as good as its current reputation would suggest."

"O: Great beer. I'm incredibly grateful that I got to try this one. One of the better examples of a barrel aged stout you will find. KBS is one of my favorite beers and this gives it a huge run for its money."

"Right out of the fridge this beer tastes a tad too hot. Described as ""premium bourbon barrels," I assume the heat to be more linked to the type of bourbon versus the actual heat from the alcohol. As it warms the nuances begin to attract versus detract. Sadly, I can barely taste the coffee. This being a strong point in the base beer makes this the most disappointing part of this beer. I can't complain too much because the rest of the beer is great. Mouthfeel and smell are close to being spot on. I'm just wishing there was a bit more coffee."

"Taste starts out with a slight alcohol bourbon burn but quickly subsides when the roasted malt, vanilla and dark fruit come into play, subtle hints of chocolate help sweeten the deal, the burn does return in the throat though, even four years of age and this is a strong beer, carbonation is perfect, medium high viscosity so there's nice coverage on the tongue without being too ""chewy""."
""
""
""
""
""
"Deeelicious. Not much coffee left here, but I don't care. The barrels are perfect, the sweetness is perfect. I don't much care for regular Speedway, but this is among the best BA stouts I've ever tasted."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Carbonation is lower than regular Speedway. Toffee notes challenge caramel. Gets to be thicker and more chewy the longer you go with it. If you like coffee and bitterness, stick with the regular version, if you want some barrel, hit this up."

"O- Just an unbelievable beer. Barrel-aged stouts are my favorite style and I can't honestly say I've had any that are better than this. It doesn't exhibit any new flavors than others that I've had, but it's so well balanced. This definitely lives up to the hype. Awesome stuff."
""
""
""

"Bitter coffee is still prominent on the palate. Charred oak, vanilla and molasses, licorice and macchiato... espresso, oily coffee bean and alcohol exist in harmony. The flavors are a little muddy but the end result is something delicious."

""
""
""

"Dark brown-black pour--let's call it black--with a small, dense cap of mocha head that retained well and streaked the glass. Nice hit of bourbon and caramel malts in the nose, dark chocolate and some dark dried fruits. Big taste, dark chocolate, roasted caramel maltiness, bourbon-soaked oak, notes of espresso and dark dried fruits; of course no hops detectable. The base beer is already great, and this just amps it up that much more. Smooth, rich mouthfeel, full body, appropriate alcohol warmth. Exemplary bourbon-aged stout."
""
""
""
"O- A really, really delicious stout. It's incredibly rich, decadent and complex, I've been sipping at this for hours and keep finding new flavors. The regular Speedway is a delicious beer and one of the best 750ml stouts for its price, but the BA variant is definitely my favorite."

"o-disappointed some with this one. i thought the barrel treatment would mellow and enrich the body of the base beer, but it wasn't as viscous as i'd have liked it to be. i think with the bourbon and with all the coffee, there was just too much acidity; ba speedway was just a bit too astringent for my liking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the coffee was very unnoticeable on the palate, something that I loved so much about the original Speedway. The bourbon barrel flavors were huge, but perhaps a little ""too huge"" for my liking, as they seemed to overshadow some of Speedways excellent qualities. Still a very delicious beer, but I'd have to take the original over this one, without question."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: This is definitely in the upper echelon of BA stouts. Having more coffee notes would have definitely set it apart. Still a very delicious brew that I'd love to have again."

"Overall: BA Speedway Stout is fantastic! I really loved this beer. Its a tried and true BA Stout that Alesmith really nailed it. My only minor complaint is that I did not get much of the Ryans brothers coffee from this beer. I still give BCBS Coffee the nod when it comes to barrel aged imperial stouts brewed with coffee, but BA SS is not too far behind it."
""
"Decadent in its chocolate tones, a real treat. I put this right up there with BCBS Coffee. Thanks for the share 4DAloveofSTOUT!"
""
"O - Really a great beer with a ton of flavor. There is a great bourbon presence, sweet vanilla, oak, chocolate and coffee. The one downside is that the nose isn't that strong on this one. If it was, it'd be a damn near perfect beer."
"O - Well, after a long, long wait to try this one - it certainly doesn't disappoint. This truly is a great barrel aged imperial stout. The barrel integration is seemless, giving some additional complexity to an already outstanding beer. The semi-sweet candy bar aspect of this beer is pretty amazing...I'm thinking of a Dark Milky Way...bitter chocolate, coffee, caramel and nouget...so good. Very glad to finally land this one - a couple years of trying finally paid off. Thanks again Alex...really an awesome barrel aged stout."
""
"O: very delicious beer that definitely made a huge difference after the bourbon barrel treatment. We actually did a side by side with a vintage bottle and it looks like it will aged great and the booze does mellow out."

"A-"
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Overall, this is a fantastic treat of a beer. One of the best aromas Ive ever experienced, backed up by an incredible palate profile. Big, complex, strong, and delicious. Has to be considered amongst the best imperial stouts Ive had. World class in my book."

"2012 Version. Pours a pitch black color with a large, tan colored head that takes a little time before it goes down. A very delicious-looking beer. Scent is a very familiar bourbon aroma that I got from the 2010 Decadence bottle I had the other night. Wonder if they used the same barrels? I sure hop they did, because the bourbon/barrel on that bottle was insane! This one tends to be mellowed out in the aroma a bit by the intense coffee and chocolate scents. Fresh brewed coffee with an intense chocolate cake aroma. Not just chocolate, but definitely rich chocolate cake. This beer smells like boozy dessert. Great aroma. Taste is just as good. At first I get sweet chocolate and bitter espresso beans. The bitterness hangs around for less than 1/100 of a second, as the sweet boozy bourbon kicks in. This beer is NOT for the faint of heart. Very sweet and boozy. In my opinion, the booziness and the sweetness compliment each other very nicely. If one were lacking, this beer would not taste as great as it does. Lovely vanilla, oak, and bourbon finish. Coffee lingers on the palate. Mouthfeel is full bodied and slightly syrupy. Drinkability is fairly high. Overall, this beer would be much more drinkable if it wasn't so sweet. However, I don't think this beer was meant to be consumed in large quantities...so the sweetness is okay. This beer is fantastic and everything I hoped it would be."

"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, bourbon, and wood. Taste is much the same with a slight tartness. There is an alcohol kick and a mild roasty bitterness with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a great smell but the taste doesn't quite match up for me."

"Dark brown color. Medium head. Aroma is malts, dark sugar and fruits. Full bodied Imperial Stout. Malts are roasty, chocolate and coffee, with touches of vanilla and dark fruit. The brandy/bourbon flavor is evident. Nice blend of chocolate, wood and smoke. Very smooth. Bourbon and chocolate flavors blend well together. Touch of alcohol bite. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"A solid barrel aged stout but doesn't do too much different than any other highly rated stout. Wish I had popped this sooner because I feel that it would have had more to offer earlier in it's life but still, a great beer."

"Side-by-side with Black Note with BA speedway being a close winner. Although I prefered Black Note's palate and aroma, BA speedway's flavors were out of this world. One of the best stout I've had."

"750mL 2009 ed. Ink black pour with a wildly active reddish tan head. Big lace for a BA beer. Nose up front is salty, briny, green olive, sharp gherkins. Volatile notes move to wildly awesome toasted coconut, milk chocolate, toasted coconut. Incredible umami savoriness in the nose. Taste is ultra soft, muted chocolate, lactic fattiness, and zero acidic coffee and lemon character which I despise in the normal Speedway Stout. This right here is a masterpiece. Muted barrel character, no heat, no booze. Just imperial stout perfection right here. Perfect palate: melted chocolate, chocolate pound cake, fatty yogurt, mild bourbon spice, buttery ganache. Holy #@!!. An incredible experience. For one of the most stingy raters I can safely say this is totally worthy of its ranking and should be considered a god amongst men. Praise the lord for this beer."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a smooth feel and modest amount of carbonation. It is boozy at times and demands to be a sipper. I enjoyed the big alcohol inclusion and the bold array of barrel character that was imparted. I am very glad I had the chance to try this but not being the craziest fan of speedway, I could take it or leave it in the future. Overall though, I can see why fans of speedway would go apeshit over this brew each time this treatment is released."
""
"D - this is a nice bourbon barrel aged stout. One of the more highly regarded ones out there and I can see why. However, I still found it a little hot and could use a little more time."
"2009 vintage - Pours pitch black with a nice brown sticky and foamy head. Aroma of roasted malts, licorice, vanilla, oak, bourbon, hints of coffee and chocolate. Taste is slightly sweeter than the original Speedway Stout. Has a lot of roastiness, notes of vanilla, wood, oak, coffee and sweet molasses. Sweetish and smooth finish with nice bourbon vanilla notes and roastiness. Alcohol comes through slightly in the end. Overall a quite massive beer. Perhaps just a tad too sweet for my taste, though, and not as perfectly balanced as the original one. Still extremely tasty."
""
"Dark chocolate, heavily roasted malts, oak, more dark chocolate, and plenty of boozy warmth survived the journey. I'm not a big fan of the base -- and I similarly dislike '09 BA Speedway -- so I was surprised how much I enjoyed this. Mature, handsome, and delicious."
"O- As a big fan of the regular Speedway Stout, I was very excited to try this. The bourbon barrels added some nice qualities to the base beer, but the aging also stripped away the big coffee characteristics that can be found in regular Speedway. Glad to try this and would happily have again, but wouldn't put the ammo it takes to land this."
""
"D - Better than expected. The barrel is really well executed, almost like something Hair of the Dog would do if they had a stout. Absolutely not a sweet stout, so don't expect that coming in. Worth trying at least once but not quite worth the trade bait."
""
"Overall - Nice. Really nice. Maybe not any better than regular Speedway, but the barrel adds a nice dimension."

"O - Very good beer that I am glad I had the opportunity to try considering how rare it is now. The regular speedway is one of my favorite beers and this took it up a notch. Hope to have it again someday."

""
"There isn’t quite a total melding of barrel and base Stout here but the beautiful transition from the Speedway to the barrel in the back really makes this beer work. I’m a huge fan of the regular Speedway Stout and this just really took things to a new delicious level for me. Thanks again for the share Adam. I enjoyed every drop of this fantastic beer."

"Didn't find the bourbon characteristics overbearing like some other reviewers - in fact found the opposite and that is my chief criticism of the beer. Technically very well done, but was expecting more complexity and barrel character."
""
""
"M-- Rich and luscious. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Dangerously drinkable for the ABV, even with the alcohol being pretty obvious in this. My biggest want of all time and it did deliver on many levels. Yet not nearly as good as other BA beers. Still would trade for it again in a heartbeat or get homeless people to sit in line for it"
""
"4.5 D: Very tasty beer, but I wish it was easier to get. It takes a lot to pull this in a trade, so in the future I'll resign myself to obtaining BCSs, CBS, and BA Boris. That said, I'm happy I traded for this because it is a great beer and something everyone should try."

"This beer pours a nearly pitch black with a mocha colored head. the smell is hints of boubon and oak with coffee notes mixed in. the taste is very faint bourbon and coffee with a bit of roastiness in the background. the mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with decent carbonation. overall this is a very good beer, but i think it was a little bit of a let down. bourbon county coffee is better and easier to get."

"Sample straight from a growler courtesy Dakine at RBWG 2010... wow, thanks!!!! Wow. Really good stuff, amazing balance. They’re not bowling you over with barrel aging, but it’s there and it’s perfect. This is really good. Black pour with a very small khaki head. Aroma and taste show pleasant BA characteristics - vanilla, coconut, as well as the deliciousness that is Speedway underneath."

"Drink- Jim. Thanks for breaking this one out. A very good beer but just not up to par with what I think is one of the best stouts out there for the money. I like this I really did. Not bashing at all and rating just below the original in terms of taste and appearance."
""
""
""
""

"O - Damn, this is easily one of the best Barrel Aged stouts I have ever had. The balance of dark flavors from the base beer blend flawlessly with the barrel aging to form one amazing beer. I can not thank you enough Kramer for the chance to try this one."

"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a medium size foamy head with minimal retention. Aroma of dry whisky with notes of dry roasted malt is interesting. Taste is a nice mix between some dry roasted malt notes with some coffee though not as much as in the original version with some dry whisky notes. Body is about average with medium carbonation and alcohol is not too apparent. A bit too dry and astringent for my taste thought still very much enjoyable."

"Overall this was nice but something didn't really work for me. The greatness of the original Speedway is somehow lost here; the big espresso/coffee is masked by the bourbon presence which some may enjoy more, but I think I may prefer the original. I have also read that previous vintages of this release were much better so take that for what it's worth as well. Definitely a great great beer but it didn't meet the hype for me and definitely not the best BA Stout I have had."

"A terrific version of a fantastic base beer."
"O- I absolutely love this beer, the coffee, bourbon and vanilla are phenomenal in this beer, all the different flavors that come out are well balanced and make this beer an amazing experience."
"I've had the '06 and the one that was growler only before. I'd say this is the weakest of the three. This one isn't the A+ decadent showstopper that those were."
"OVERALL: This is a good beer, but nothing more than that. Unfortunately the barrel aging has muted the coffee flavors and lightened up the feel, making this more of generic barrel aged stout as opposed to a BA Speedway. Furthermore, the barrel flavors aren’t even that impressive in themselves, so it’s not even an exciting generic barrel aged stout. The regular Speedway is a fantastic brew, but the time in the barrel has muted all that made it special. A shame really. If you love Speedway, just stick to the base beer, but if you love bourbon barrel stouts, pick something that showcases the barrel flavors better. Anyways, while this was a bit of a letdown, I was thrilled with the chance to try it out. Thanks again for the trades johbdoe8 and Irishgurl4."
"2009 bottle, thanks James. Pours a viscous black ""nighter than night"" with a mocha head. Nose is more coffee forward than I expected, still a very pleasant montage of fresh coffee beans, baker's chocolate, pleasantly sweet vanilla. Barrel is subdued but woven in nicely. Really good contrast between bitter elements (coffee beans, baker's chocolate), sweet elements (vanilla, coconut), and a pleasant complexity from the barrel. Luscious and thick in the mouth. Flavors open with very dark chocolate, vanilla, coffee beans parading high in the profile, segueing into that rich bourbon barrel, coconut, and a really nice creamy, hot finish. Mouthfeel is perfectly thick and creamy, foamed latte and crushed velvet. Beautiful beer!"
"Overall: Fantastically smooth, complex, and flavorful. The bourbon barrel accents the already exceptional base beer, rather than covering it up. One of the three or four best imperial stouts I've ever had, hands down."
"Drinking this beer was great experience. I was really excited to try this and now I know. I don't think I'd go through a lot of trouble to aquire this but won't say no when offered. It's almost a love/ hate between me and this beer. Jeffo nailed it again for beer theme night and now I have to see how I can out do him for the next Tuesday..."
"Overall, this was an amazing beer. Much better than the 08 growler I had, which lacked the huge coffee flavors. This beer was a real treat."
"I’m a big fan of Speedway stout but I’m surprised at what barrel aging has done for this beer. A completely different flavor profile very different from the coffee-dominant base beer emerges here. Silky smooth, complex, and just very good overall. Definitely worth seeking out."
"This poured black into a snifter with not much of a head. Aroma is a really nice bourbon, oak, spice, dark chocolate, and some rich coffee beans. More vanilla than in the regular. Awesome aroma. Flavor is not as boozy as I thought it would be. Really smooth medley of bourbon, oak, vanilla, spice, and dark chocolate. Really great flavor on this, it has deeper flavors and more complex than the regular Speedway. Thick and rich body. I enjoyed this a lot more than Parabola, KBS. Not the best barrel aged imperial stout I have had recently but still worth seeking out."
"O: Great example of a barrel aged imperial stout, extremely smooth and full of flavor. Quite drinkable for a beer of this size."
"O: This is fantastic! Great mouthfeel, taste. Was hoping for more in the aroma but this is a world class BA RIS. 4.5"
"want more!"
"O – This is a great BA stout, and I enjoyed it greatly and am glad I got to tick it. I still prefer The Abyss, Parabola, and other variations in this style that would prevent me from trying to hunt it down again. Its a solid, balanced beer that is great if you can get it and no big deal if you cant."
"Overall this is a very good beer. I would love to try it again. But, since my expectations were SO high, I am a little bit disappointed."
"O: I’m really glad to have had this beer. It lived up to my expectations and is one that I would gladly have again, and will probably search out again in the future. Hides the ABV very well."
"Pours an almost black with some tan head floating around the edges. Muted cold coffe in the nose, a tad vinous, more bourbon as it warms. Taste folllows nose, with some tartness, bitterness from the coffee, and some roast. Bourbon peaks out for a second behind the oak and vino character. Good beer, more like an english old ale at this point than a stout."
"Big thanks goes out to funkydelic for sharing this one with me! 2011 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured pitch black with a one finger tan head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained good lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, and subtle sour acidity. The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, sweet alcohol, coffee, caramel, and subtle sour acidity. It had a heavy mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Overall this was a great brew. The barrel on this brew really developed it quite nicely. This one however had the same acidic flavor as the 2010 Speedway that was had side-by-side with this one, but this one came off a little more sour than the regular 2010 version. Not sure what to make of that, but it didn't hurt the brew at all. The sweet alcohol and wood notes on this one were quite well integrated and took the regular to a whole new level. Really glad I FINALLY got the opportunity to try this as it was quite good."
"Black hole dark. Bourbon all day on the nose. Smells really nicely balanced. Yum...one of the better BA Stouts. Really on the money for my taste buds. Bourbon with chocolately roasted malts. Mouth is really good as well, not as smooth as others I've had, and this is very heavy, but overall very good on the mouth. Overall, this is a REALLY solid BA stout...one of the best...just plain delicious."
"O - Decent, but not great. I don't understand the hype behind this beer."
"Narrative: Kicked out of the racing academy. Well, at least that is what he told his parents that his tuition checks were going to. The truth is that Chase Worthington was never attending a racing school in Temecula. He accepted “tuition” checks from his parents every 5 months and even in the summer session for modding his sick 2001 Mercury Cougar for drag racing or “Straight up Dragging it” as he abrasively referred to it, much to the chagrin of his friends, when present. His friends told him that running the mean streets of San Diego was not to be trifled with, that is, unless one were content to life his life “a quarter mile at a time.” This seemed to be a deafeningly infinitesimal stretch for a racer like himself. Cold air intake, cat back exhaust, chipped, sick body kit; all of the accoutrements were present however he forgot a single thing: his car had only 189 horse power and people grew tired of its inky discharge, regardless of the speeds that it allegedly traveled. This speedway pun was a speedway pun for the racing pun speedway pun, and in the end, they all learned speedway pun, racing."
"Overall - I would love to try this again but not for what it has been trading for in the ISO/FT forum."
"The feel is good. Nice full and robust but a little sticky. Overall this one is insane. Very complex and surprisingly drinkable. A little hot but it doesn't even matter. This one is great."
"This met my expectations. I would happily have this as often as possible."
"O: I loved the regular version so it was no surprise that this was just as good. Worth seeking out."
"This was one of my favorites of the evening."
"2006 bottle via pantanap. Four years old and fan-freakin-tastic!!!! Glorious coffee and chocolate aromas leaching out of the black brew. The flavors are so well proportioned with mellow bourbon, oak, chocolate, coffee, and vanilla swirling around in a delicious masterpiece..."
"Poured black hue with large creamy light brown head that lasted with good lacing. Aroma was a heavy toasted malt, strong coffee and bourbon aroma. Medium to heavy body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy complex toasted malt, vanilla and bourbon flavor and a medium to heavy complex sweet finish of moderate to long duration. Very good brew."
"Pours black with a very thin layer of tannish head. The aroma is bourbon, oak, vanilla and roasted malts. Definitely more reserved than some BA imperial stouts. Taste is smooth. Iced coffee, roasted malts, mild chocolate meld with bourbon, oak and vanilla. A good level of sweetness is balanced with a reserved bitterness that comes together quite well. While there is a lot of barrel in this beer, it is not an over-the-top BA imperial stout like some. Good medium carbonation and body work well. Overall, this beer is a winner. AleSmith obviously knows their way around a barrel. Being picky, a bit more of the coffee flavor that comes out in the base beer, along with a slight boost in the barrel character would have pushed the taste to a 5. In addition, that additional coffee probably would have brought out the nose more. Still really good as is."
"The flavors take a nose dive into dry territory that tastes like it was meant to be tart, or aged with dark fruits or something along those lines, i really kept thinking this was like a bad stout version of Boulavard BBQ with dark cherries as it had those same characterisitcs, though not desirable and tasty like you would expect, maybe i needed more to grow on me. There was considerable oxidation which only made things worse. Dry and over fermented, if you have a bottle, i'd save it for 2025, just because it's barely worth drinking now, i think most of our bottle was left over on the table. Maybe in 2025 it will be a novelty."
"O- One of the best if not the best ba stout ive had. I love kbs but this beer is slightly better then that one. i just truly love this beer."
"Overall: Nice work Alesmith. They worked the barreling process to near perfection with this one. Danger is its middle name. Deceivingly drinkable for a 12% ABV. Probably explains my lack of self-control and my desire to have 4 helpings of this one (in adddition to the Decadence and Speedway Vanilla & Coconut tasters I had as well). While Alesmith does a superb job with not letting the barrel completely overwhelm all other aspects of the beer, my only criticism is that I wish the bourbon was just a tad more pronounced in the flavor profile. Regardless, I enjoyed this one very much. I wish everyone gets the chance to sample this eventually. In my opinion, the BA version of Speedway completely blows the regular version right out of the water."
"T: Dark chocolate, cocoa powder, coffee, fudge, hints of dark fruit (plum and black currant) with a slightly acidic finish. Lush and velvety mouthfeel with a pleasant warming sensation on the finish and a little bit of a peat flavor and dryness from the bourbon. The bourbon was surprisingly restrained, which surprised me. The balance was really well done. I definitely feel lucky to have gotten to try this one."
"O – This was a great version of the Speedway Stout. The barrel aging has done wonders to this beer. I’m hoping that aging this beer a bit more will help bring out more flavors."
"O: An extremely well done barrel aged imperial stout that would be hard to match. The bourbon is more well-balanced than Parabola."
"O- Great beer that recieved a very distinct and satisfying change from the barrel age."
"Overall: Very good BA imperial stout. Picked up two bottle of this so I will put one away for a year or more to see how the flavors mature and I will drink one again here soon. Looking forward to another go around with this beer."
"Pours black with a thin film of sand colored foam, which persists in ring form for quite a while. Not much lacing to speak of. Smell is mostly bourbon and oak, a little vanilla; a nicely restrained aroma, though, and not at all overpowering. Not a lot of coffee or malt here, and definitely more mellow than regular Speedway. Taste is more balanced than the smell, with more of a coffee and chocolate presence along with the bourbon and oak, as well as some maltiness and sweetness. Finishes with a very slight coffee bitterness. Wow, super tasty and smooth stuff. Medium-full body and medium carbonation work great with the beer here; not much heat to speak of. Overall, this is a world class bourbon barrel age coffee stout, exceedingly drinkable, and which shows admirable restraint with the barrel treatment."
"The beer is a dark reddish brown color with a light beige head. The foam recedes quickly leaving a thin ring around the glass. The nose is chocolate, bourbon and dark fruit. Taste is of leather, chocolate, caramel, and oak. There is a sweet quality to it, as well. Bourbon is integrated so well that there is almost no alcohol heat to speak of. Finish is sweet with lingering chocolate and bourbon. Feel is somewhat thinner than I'd expect from a big BA stout and carbonation is on the low side, as it should be. Overall this is another very nice barrel aged offering from AleSmith."
"NOTES: This was a huge treat. So glad I had to try this one."
"O: Solid balanced beer, tasty oak and a good integration of fading coffee. Not an overly remarkable beer but matured with age, allowing the bourbon nuances to show."
"So great. Big thanks to Allen for popping that."
"Pour revealed a fudge like dark brown color. No head whatsoever with some bubbles on one half of the glass. The best part of this beer I felt was the nose. I enjoy coffee stouts and coffee in general, so naturally I picked up a lot of coffee flavors off the bat. Followed by some vanilla, oak and slight bourbon characteristics. I got vanilla and a slight tart coffee and bourbon taste that was blended well. Also tasted some chocolate in there. A very creamy stout that was very easy to drink sip after sip. Enjoyed this one and was a standout at the tasting."
"D. Great beer. A complex beer that I really appreciate being able to try."
"Pours a dark thick brown. Very nice reddish orange tint on the edges. Almost no head. So so thick. Smells super buttery and bourbon heavy. Tastes very bourbon heavy and lots of smooth butteriness. A touch of coffee but it's fairly subtle comes out much stronger on the back of the tongue. As it warms up the coffee comes out much more."
"O-great beer. Wow. This is incredible"
"This is good... But not as great as the growler that I've previously had. Still, it was fun to drink."
"D- This is one of the best stouts I have ever had. The BA components compliment the stout characteristics very well and this is worlds better than regular speedway-seem like 2 completely different beers. The flavors are really big here but it is not nearly as aggressive as regular speedway."
"Cheers!"
"I'm glad this beer was #1200. I'm also glad I had the opportunity to try it. That being said, I wish I'd tried it sooner, and I wish I'd tried it alongside the non -bal version of Speedway, just so I could get the true side-by-side comparison in an attempt to identify how much of what I'm tasting is due to aging and how much isn't. Worth seeking out, but not at the expense some believe it's worth, methinks."
"Overall, very excited to finally try this beer, especially one as old as this one. An excellent beer and a good example of how aging can completely change a beer. Recommended."
"Very big beer demands small slow sips. A very enjoyable stout to sit down with for an evening."
"Overall an excellent beer. I can only imagine getting to try it at various cycles of its life, & sure as hell hope I get to in the future. One more salute to fiver29, thank you so much, sir."
"overall really disappointed i'm hoping that I get to try a bottle thats not been compromised."
"D - I found this quite easy to drink, and went back for a few more ounces after my initial pour. I liked this more than the 2008 growler, but I'm not sure it's the mind-blowing experience others have described."
"Smooth and creamy mouthfeel (very low carb), it gives Bolshoi a run for the money, excellent."
"Flavor is rich, mildly oxidized, reminding me of Thomas Hardys. The alcohol has a mild sting but it doesn't affect the taste. Mellow roast and fudgy chocolate flavors, bitter coffee, an almost wine-like grape note surfaces too. Some soft bourbon traces, mostly vanilla and booze. Mellow carbonation, strong enough to keep it a sipper. Three years might be slighty too long to age, but it's still holding on."
"A 750 ml bottle, 2004 edition bottle number 98/228. A huge thanks go out to Eric for this, it was the gem of his awesome party. It was a festivus for the rest of us. Pours a dark brown color with a very thick light beige colored head. A awesome aroma of sweet fruits, chocolates, some coffee and just loads of milky sweet chocolate and mocha. The taste was excellent, sweet and milky chocolate and coffee, dark fruits, maybe some fudge. So very, very smooth and almost silky. Not aggressive, but excellent. The aging has done wonders to this, no alcohol noticed at all really. What a rarity and a wonder. One of my favorite beers ever. Re-rate: Eric shared a 2010 growler of this. It was hot, nasty and super aggressive. Pure goodness. Not the complex beer it was with four years on it, but still super good. A great brew"
"D--Well, lets face it, impossible beer to get, so enjoy it when you get it. This beer is AWESOME. My god, more please."
"Touch of bourbon sour at first. As it warmed, the sour bourbon released a little. Coffee and bourbon and bourbon. Drinking like a raspberry framboise with a tad of coffee. Quite sour...drink now."
"Pours an oily black with no apparent carbonation. Fully opaque. A little swirling the snifter kicks up a few bubbles, then goes back to still blackness. Aroma is sweet, and quite fruity; Dark fruits, that is. Just a little coffee on the nose, with cherry and plum/prune. Just a little wood and bourbon aroma. The flavor is pretty huge on this one, way bigger and more complex than the regular Speedway. Very tarry, lots of cigar smoke, leather, booze is alive and present. Huge espresso is present, with dark chocolate. Sweet, but not an all-out sugar assault. Again, there is dark, smoky tar throughout. Extremely chewy. Only faintly bitter. If you swish it around in your mouth, you get some more carbonation, as you can almost feel the cavities developing in your teeth. I'm glad I got to try this. Definitely not a session beer (Of course if you're reading this, you likely already knew that. I mean, like anybody other than the CEO of Alesmith would have the means to session this anyway.), but very soulful for just a glass now and then. Overall, excellent"
"Have had this three times now, all different vintages. These notes are from the first time: Huge thanks to fordest for this one. 2006 Silk Screen bottle #187/233. Pours with a huge, dark brown head over a very black body with some lace. Aroma of nutty fudge, bourbon, oak, vanilla, light coffee, liquid amazingness, florals and soil. I literally smelled this beer for 15 minutes without tasting a single sip. Taste is chocolate, coffee, oaky, brandy, bourbon and a bit nutty. Very smooth and silky mouthfeel."
"Pitch black with a dark brown head with good retention. Plenty of visible carbonation The barrel character is most prominent with bourbon, charred wood, vanilla, oak and tannins being most prominent. Behind it lies a more mellow Speedway - chocolate and mellow coffee but all told, this is a big bourbon trip. Medium body with plenty of bourbon up front with oak and vanilla. Moderately oaky and tannic in a way that works well with the dark sweetness of the chocolate and medium-roasted coffee. Tannic and oaky on the finish with a good bit of vanilla. Medium body, soft carbonation, excellent finish"
"Growler provided by mothman to try out prior to Dark Lord Day. Pours a deep, dark black with a slight tan head. Smells roasty, toasy, and coffee with a subtle sweetness in the nose, along with the barrel. Sweet up front with an aggressive bitterness in the back end just like the regular version. For some reason this is just not as good as I expected or wanted it to be."
"The beer is black with a diminutive light brown head that quickly fades. The aroma is of chocolate sugar cookies and a graceful oxidation character with light soy sauce and vanilla notes. Bourbon is well integrated. Brown sugar is evident. Decadence itself. The flavor is chocolate desserts of all sorts: truffles, cake, brown sugar cookies...you name it! The beer has aged gracefully, evincing light soy sauce notes that compliment the smooth bourbon flavor. Oak is detectable, in addition to subtle dark fruits (prunes?). Coffee is nonexistent. Carbonation is low, and it works well with the rich flavors. An outstanding beer, and one that I probably won't see again."
"Thick, creamy body is perfectly carbonated. Perhaps a bit past age, but still a lovely beer. Peaks closer to 5 years."
"D- This beer was great...period. The oxidation was not a deal breaker with the beer. I had no problem drinking the bottle over a hour and a half period. I am glad I saved this bottle but it should be drank sometime here soon before the oxidation takes over the entire beer. The ABV makes this a one and done but also one bottle is good enough."
"Overall I thought this was a phenomenal beer however I'm not sure if I don't prefer the normal Speedway. I think the type of barrel AleSmith uses is more geared toward a stout that's not quite as big as Speedway, maybe one with bourbon that was on the boozier side would work better. Anyways, I'm grasping at straws here, give this one a shot."
"D: Flavors are well integrated and the barrel aging wasn't overdone...obviously it's not exactly quaffable, but I'm having no trouble working my way through a growler with a friend."
"2007 vintage. Bottle number 205 of 447. This was sampled side-by-side with a regular Speedway Stout. The beer pours dark brown to black with a brown head. The aroma is bourbon, oak, vanilla, roasted malt, chocolate and alcohol. The flavor is awesome. I get bourbon, oak, semi-sweet chocolate, brown sugar and vanilla. The oak and tannic notes are very tart or bitter, giving the beer an almost sour quality. The coffee has completely faded. Medium-thick mouthfeel and low-medium carbonation. Not sure which I liked the best out of this and the non barrel-aged version because they are both awesome. Very happy I got to try this."
"Beer is really really smooth. Medium to full bodied, sweetness up front with an ever so slight amount of heat behind it. Oddly there is almost a late tartness to this beer. Its not lactic or acetic, the beer isn't going bad but there is a strong almost tannic character to the whole beer. I suppose this the result of the wood aging process. It is unexpected but does not interrupt the flow of the flavors in the mouth. Bitterness at the back is low but good. Overall a really good beer. I'd still like to do the side-by-side with the regular."
"This beer pours a rich, deep black with a dark tan head. Plenty of carbonation left in this gem. This aroma is not subtle. Bourbon and rich roasted malt, with a slight alcohol note emit huge scents I can detect from a few feet away. The beer is absolutely fabulous. Although it is very strong and forward, it drinks very smoothly. It definitely has some heat to it, but it only serves to add a little warmth in the finish. Alesmith Speedway Stout is a terrific beer, so it makes sense that barrel aging such a tasty stout would result in this masterpiece. What a treat."
"D: It comes together a lot better as it warms, but I am never in love with it. I'm glad I had it, as I was very curious about this one, but I'm not breaking the cellar for it in the future. The fresher one out of a growler was more to my liking."
"D - Runs a tad hot, but still definately above average all things considered in the drinkability department."
"Drinkability- Not bad but honestly I'd much rather have the original. The barrel just covers all the great aspects of Speedway and doesn't help to make it better. Yes, it's still very good but for how limited it is but there are other barrel aged brews out there that are slightly better. One of the few beers that I prefer the regular to the barrel aged. Thanks Matt!"
"Consumed: 4/14/2010"
"D- This is different from the regular, but I'm not sure I'd say it's better- less coffee and slightly more complex. I wish there was more bourbon/wood/vanilla. I'm kinda suprised that this isn't smoother than it is. Regardless I'm glad I had it."
"I got lucky enough to have this 2004 bottle at dld. The beer is black with a tan head, nothing remarkable here. The aroma is pretty nice, notes of oak, bourbon, and vanilla. The taste is what places this beer apart. Not sure if its because of the againg(2004), but there is beer simply taste phenominal. It was really sweet in a good way with tons of vanilla and chocolate and super smooth oak and bourbon. A two ounch pour does not do this beer justice, I've got to get my hands on more."
"M + D: Creamy and full bodied with a little bit of crisp carbonation to keep everything in balance. With such a huge ABV, the alcohol is verging on deceiving in how well hidden it is. There's really no sign of any heat at all. Very nice, and something that comes across far nicer than what I remember from the original."
"D- This is one of the best stouts I have ever had. The BA components compliment the stout characteristics very well and this is worlds better than regular speedway-seem like 2 completely different beers. The flavors are really big here but it is not nearly as aggressive as regular speedway. Great to try the 2 side by side!"
"D-this is a delicious imperial stout. The flavors are spot on, nothing dominates but the barrel aging works perfectly and smoothes out the feel so well. Awesome beer!"
"Overall, I'm extremely grateful to try this once in a lifetime gem. It wasn't exactly what I hoped it would be, but a stellar beer none the less. Thanks a bunch, Ben!"
"D - I had 4 or 5 tasting glasses worth, and I would have had more if it wasn't for everyone else breaking out more awesome beers. I really enjoyed this one. I'd def get another growler but obviously, you'll need several people to split this one with."
"Overall, a rare treat to get to try. Thanks Scott!"
"As a lover of BA Stouts, this is one of my favorites. I wish I had a keg of this stuff, as I looked forward to coming home to it the last couple nights. Awsome awsome beer, hopefully I'll get to have it again sometime"
"D: Admittedly, I probably did not review this beer under the best circumstances and I may have given it better marks fresh from the tap. That being said, however, as is it's a wonderful beer with many layers of complexity. I'll definitely seek this out fresh in the future, but I already really like it."
"Pours black with a brown head. Aroma is strong coffee and oak. Flavor again is more strong coffee, oak, bourbon, cream, toffee, booze, and just a hint of paper. Silky smooth mouthfeel. Some hint of the abv. I really liked this one, but after everything was said and done I almost prefer the non BA speedway. I did here from a few folks I shared this with it wasn't up to par with other bottles tasted. Still though, I'm so glad I finally got to try this."
"What a beer - I can't wait to have this again sometime down the road! At least one of the people who I shared my growler with exclaimed that this is the best beer that they've ever had. It's easily among my tops as well."
"Seriously, this was the best imperial stout I've ever had. The mouthfeel was the real high point, and I wish there was a way to rate it a 6. This beer is milk smooth. Unbelievable. The bourbon was present but not overwhelming, the coffee was still available if you really taste closely, and the vanilla flavors from the barrel were perfect. A one shot that won't be found again. Epic."
"Letting the beer sit in the growler for a few days brings out more fruity oxidation in this beer, really reminding me in some ways of the 03 BA Speedway, but it doesn't match up in the richness or breathtaking beauty that that beer is. All told, though, this is an exceptional beer, one that I feel lucky to have had a chance to try."
"I'm so lucky to have had this 2 miles from my house. Cost me a lot to help out a couple of friends, but it was well worth it as a it's a special treat to be able to try this beer."
"Overall this is an incredibly well made beer and one that truly lends itself to the barrel aging process. My only qualm is that it is not readily available."
" Went nicely with the brownie cakes made from the leftover regular speedway growler and drizzled with speedway caramel sauce."
"Thanks Dyan!"
"D: Pretty excellent. I felt that this is more drinkable than regular Speedway which I find to be pretty hot and bitter, as of late. Actually this drank like a 6-7% stout. How do they hide that?"
"Overall this is a fantastic bourbon barrel stout and the coffee, chocolate, and cherry flavors make it one of the best."
"Overall: Vastly different/better than the bottled version I tried a few years back. The complexities that the barrel imparted on this year's Speedway were amazing, to say the least. I can't think of another beer that used the barrel aging process as well as this. I must try. Cheers!"
"D: Supreme. One of the best stouts I've had in a long, long time. Again, big thanks to Steve for sending this one out my way."
"D-Really--is this a question? I love regular Speedway and this is that taken to another level--BIG TIME! Simply an outstanding barrel aged brew. I wish it wasn't so damn rare and limited. I would be happy to drink this anytime."
"The growler pours gosh danged dark with around a finger of dark mocha head. Not much retention or lacing, goes down to zero bubbles pretty quickly. Slight coating effect from the alcohol, but no legs or church windows. The aroma is plums, bourbon, brown sugar, black treacle, coconut, coffee, and oak. The barrel presence is quite real and stronger than the bottles I have tasted from time to time, as this growler would be fresher out of the oak. The flavor has cocoa, oak, bourbon, raisin, and even some olive and spiciness to it. Roasted coffee and cookielike malts on the finish. The body is medium to full with some nice oily thickness to it, but still a bit thinner I would expect. Quite a nice beer, somewhat boozy, though I like some nice bourbon flavors. I will have a couple glasses."
"Alcohol content is well hidden in this incredibly crafted, highly enjoyable stout. A real treat."
"Smooth and almost creamy, this beer is a case study is how a barrel aged beer should be created. The fact that there is no carbonation works extremely well, and the consistency is not syrupy either. The body is great, and the drinking experience phenomenal."
"D: Truly top notch. I think this vintage is just about at its peak. It was sublimely delicate and complex. Would easily seek out another bottle if anyone is trading!"
"Pours very dark brown with slightest hints of ruby in the light, little tan head that faded instantly. Aroma was slight bourbon with some coffee still poking its way through. Tasted almost like a mocha with a few shots of bourbon in it. This was incredible oak/rye/molasses flavor in a beer WITHOUT the kick in the back of the throat. This is insanely drinkable for 12% and age has been nice to this beer and it was a fantastic chance to try one. Thanks, Ryan."
"The Bourbon Barrel Aged Speedway Stout is 12.5%, just a .5% more than their regular Speedway Stout. It poured an eclipse black with some light cream. It smelled like bourbon, malt, espresso, but not too overwhelmingly bourbon. It tasted like toasted malts, bourbon, but no burn. It was incredibly smooth for 12.5% and seemed more like it was created using Irish whiskey barrels perhaps? You don't get much vanilla or coconut flavors out of it- just a hint. Seems reminiscent of the Deschuttes XXI. Overall, pretty tasty."
"2007 edition, bottle #280 of 447. Shared by Grant with some of the usual suspects- thanks very much for the opportunity, Grant! This is an exquisite beer. The barrel aging rounds out the flavors, adds a touch of creaminess, and some nice counterbalancing flavors as well as some nice drying notes from the wood. Pours a very dark brown with a relatively thin swirly head. Amazing nose, with wonderful Bourbon notes that complement the stout rather than overwhelming it. Sweet and creamy with deep notes of roastiness and nicely merged coffee and bourbon. The taste showcases a perfect marriage of drying woody notes, a touch of coconut, sweet rich bourbon finish, and nice creamy roastiness. Super creamy in the mouth and just ridiculously easy to suck down, especially given the very high abv. A very nice example of where barrel aging enhances rather than overwhelms a beer. Superb."
"Overall a damn fine beer that I am glad shows up every once in a while."
"Pours a solid black with a stingy tan head that dissipates quickly to a cap on top. Smells of coffee, vanilla, chocolate, dark fruits and prunes, with and oaky alcohol edge. The taste is filled with rich coffee and chocolates sprinkled with and oaky plum sweetness and a touch of alcohol. Hints of coconut and vanilla show up to the party but hide in the kitchen. Fairly thick body with a full creamy almost acridic mouthfeel and light carbonation. I am sad to say that I have enjoyed my last bottle of this fine brew. Intensely complex and damn tasty, I wish this was more available."
"D: Good, wish it had a bit more roast and a bit more barrel though to be honest."
"Overall: Bal-aging thins the body just a bit, and really balances out the coffee roast of regular speedway. I have to say that side by side I like this a bit better."
"Had this as part of the Linkery's ""Wood week," their fifth anniversary (wood) celebration. Tonight, they had a barrel-aged beer night, which included eight different barrel-aged beers. This one was by far our favorite of the five that we tried (with Firestone 12th Anniversary Ale a close second). To me, this came across as the best a stout can offer: full-bodied with all the flavors you would expect, but not too sweet or too strong or too heavy on the chocolate or coffee notes. A perfect balance, just right!"
"d - Overall I really liked this stout. I liked the 08 Speedway, but thought this was a lot better. Very smooth for 12% ABV and I'd love to try this again sometime."
"On tap @ Hamilton's. Deep dark black ale with a creamy two inch tan head that slowly recedes to lacing. Good looking stout. Smells of toasty malty bourbon with hints of coffee. Taste is sweeter than expected, malty, chocolate, coffee and bourbon. Smooth and rich with some alcohol burn in the finish, especially as it warms up. Delicious, complex, well rounded beer. Easy to drink with a nice full bodied mouthfeel. I only wish this one was more readily available."
"In my oppinion this was a nice, but subtle improvement over the its non-BA brother, adding some nice dimension and character to an already stellar brew. Thanks again Mac!"
"Smells of bourbon and coffee. The taste starts bitter like a very dark chocolate and espresso beans. Leaves behind an aftertaste of vanilla and caramel. Mouthfeel is perfect for the style as it is thick without being syrupuy or sticky and it is generously carbonated. The beer is very easy to drink, especially for a 12%, not hot like some other RIS's out there."
"2006 bottle shared by northernbrews at the Sept. 09 Metro Detroit tasting. Jet black pour with no head. The aroma was chocolate and roast with heavy oxidation and hints of oak, vanilla and bourbon. The flavor is more of the same with a distinct soy sauce like quality. Oily, full body. Sadly this seems to not have aged quite so well."
"Feels dense and lush, very heavy and creamy. A definite sipper; took me quite a long time to finish, maybe because I wanted to savor it. I can understand why this is so sought after."
"Smells of a stellar blend of bourbon, chocolate, and roasted coffee. Tastes of oak bourbon and very rich coffee. Somewhat of a sour tannic taste on the tongue like that you would get from eating the skins of fresh cherries. Very thick mouthful that coats the tongue. Surprisingly drinkable to me on this cold winter day, but definitely a beer meant to savor slowly."
"Damn this is a beauty. Still plenty of cellar life left as well 5 years or more. Thick coffee and roasted malts, reminds me of a dark chocolate covered coffee bean that may have been soaked in bourbon. Tons of oak tannins on the finish and a nice vanilla middle from the oak as well. Very soft and creamy on the palate. Slight anise, black currant, black cherry and red currant flavors. Some tobacco and mollasses as well. Hints of residual sugars on the finish just an amazing beer."
"-very good, both the barrel and regular were much better on tap as opposed to the bottle. much more balanced, not as sweet"
"Mouthfeel is chewy, with oak tannins sticking to the pallet, with black cherry and coffee resounding in the finish."
"By far my favorite -Bal beer, the bourbon really complements the base."
"D - I know this is a barrel aged imperial stout, but I could drink it ALL NIGHT LONG! I couldn't imagine this beer really being any better unless they put weasel sh*t in it."
"D: A dangerously drinkable beer. This is easily one of the best barrel aged beers I've tried. Very smooth and not too heavy on the barrel character, but not ""too light"" either."
"Overall it was an ok beer but was a pretty big letdown. I look forward to trying another BA Speedway to compare this with, but not sure I'll go out of my way for one."
"Had a 2006 bottle of this with JoeySchlitz last night. I was really looking forward to this and saved it for the holidays. Unfortunately, it may have been spoiled. The smell and taste had a sour spoiled milk quality to them that overrode everything else for me. I ended up having to pour this down the drain. It poured black with no head at all. Body was on the lighter side for a big barrel aged stout (but still fairly thick on an absolute scale). This was a disappointing and surprising brew, as I really enjoyed the barrel aged Numbskull and barrel aged 07 Decadence, so figured the BA Speedway would follow in the same vein."
"great brew the barrel aging really mellows this one out. Not much coffee coming through but really smooth,vanilla oak notes.Worth the effort and a great BDay treat. Chocolaty expresso greatness. Recommend if you're ever lucky enough to find one of these rare treats. Just enough coffee to accent the flavor just the way it should be..hided the alcohol content dangerously well.."
"Overall, an excellent BA stout that highlights what good barrel aging can do. Dangerous drinkable at 12%. Most highly recommend if you want to try a top tier BA beer. I was at the brewery in October and they said it would probably be another 12-18 months before this comes out again so get to trading if you want one. Rotation - not avail in TX - got from a friend. Wouldn't mind trying this again with another 1 or 2 on it to see what happens...but since so rare this probably will be my only shot."
"EDIT: OK, here I am 4 hours later and it turns out I did finish the 750 all by myself. I originally rated the drinkability a 3.5, but boosted it up to a 4.5 because it is very rare for me to drink so much of this high of an ABV beer in one sitting. Perhaps I was forcing myself to drink every last drop because of the high cost. Or maybe it really is as good as they say. I think I'll take the middle ground."
"The Vine in Ocean Beach CA, 5th anniversary. 5 gallon keg, reg speedway blended with mostly 08 barrel aged speedway drawn from the barrel. draft so perfect carb. color is similar to reg speedway but how can it be not perfect? dark rich head, cold it had a great mouthfeel and nice finish. as it warmed the nose just expanded giving debth of chocolate, wood, vanilla, with muted coffee showing how it slightly fades in time in barrel but with a touch of freshness from the blend. finish was endless, boozieness but with almost no warming just perfect balance, wood, chocolate milky with silky cashmere texture that is unmatched. zero sweetness just balance. easy to consume several 6oz $3 pours. Love the vine and the price for this amazing 1 off beer. And congrats to 5 years!"
"Drinkability: Tastes a bit more of the part of a 12% thanks to the bourbon, but just a great mixture of two styles. It feels like a baby Black Tuesday though is what kept running through my head, and it kept nagging me every sip I had that, while I really liked this beer, Black Tuesday does everything it did and just a hint more. Still, a very worthy member of the all-world stouts, and makes a great base beer a great barrel-aged beer. Highly recommended."
"Sweet Brew!"
"D: Solid but not earhty shattering. I prefer the other 2 BA'ed brews."
"Drinkability: Good for an IRS, I couldn't resist opening it when cold weather set in."
"Overall, all three beers taste exactly the same. The only difference in my mind is that the 03 had no carbonation, the 04 was carbonated, and the 06 had more alcohol in the aroma and taste with even more carbonation. The lesson here is don't let these go too long or you won't be drinking a carbonated world class brew versus a flat one."
"Overall, I wouldn't go too far out of your way to get this one. There are better BA beers on the market, and it's little brother, IMO, is a better all around beer."
"D - Wow! Amazing bourbon barrel aged stout that's - dare I say it? - even better than the original."
"I poured this beer with some heavy vigor but still only achieved one finger of carmel colored head that fades in minutes leaving a quarter inch of solid lace. Body is used motor oil blackness and just as thick. Nose has a black charred bourbon character and some carmel, coffee, smoke with a bit of an alcohol sting. Enters the mouth with a slight twang that has a bit of a dark fruit sour feel, but only slight. Then a nice bitter richness becomes evident with distinct bourbon laced all throughout. Bold bitter thickness really hangs on to the back of the tongue. This same thickness makes up the mouthfeel with some bitter dry twang. I have mentioned sour a few times but this is only a subtle sour. And I am not sure that is what is intended. This one really needs to be drank at room temperature. Drinkability is excellent as a all night sipper."
"The 2003 is: 4.5/5/5/5/5"
"Mouth is smooth, warm and thick, initially nicely carbonate, but a bit flat as it warms. From the reviews I just read, it seems the earlier BB versions fared better, wish I couldn't have them, but as for this version, too much bourbon for me... and I like my bourbon in my big stouts! But it has just been too much and too overpowering for what I know to be a superior base impy stout, that I just can't forgive the crushing of favorite parts. That said, delicious beer, wish I had another dozen sitting in my cellar."
"Pours black with beautiful red highlights. The head quickly dissipates. Smells only of bourbon and alcohol. First sip is roasted malts, prunes, oak, vanilla, licorice and a ton of alcohol. There is plenty of yummy bitterness as it is sweet for only a moment. Part of a massive 2 day Stout tasting. On my bracket BA Speedway lost to Older Viscosity in the second round."
"Drinkability: Yes! This is going to be a pleasure to finish off, I can tell. It's so darned yummy, I just had to tell the world!"
"Drinkability is very easy on this. The other guys were saying they may still prefer the regular speedway over the BA version. I like both versions and would but this everyday if it were available to me."
"This beer is a very good beer. It is interesting comparing with regular Alesmith, which I think is somewhat better. However, given the unique and limited number of this beer, it is certainly worth getting your hands on one, if you can. Very well hidden alcohol. Again, much thanks to brdc for sharing."
"This is a very good beer, but IMHO, as it gains complexity, it loses some of the most pleasant aspects. It is certainly worthwhile, but I honestly prefer the original version."
"D: Very good despite the alcohol content. I hope to be able to acquire some of this in the future!"
"Notes: Mad thanks to Carlos for this. It's a great, and I mean GREAT, brew to have for my 200th review. Totally worth seeking out."
"Pitch black with not too much head. A good swirl got nothing. The aroma is full of coffe, vanilla, oak, dark fruit, and so much more I just couldn't wrap my head around. Same with the flavor. Everything mentioned in the nose was present in the flavor. All very well blended. There was some concern at the table that the coffee would not make its way through. It was there and stood tall. The palate was a touch on the thin side, yet very fullfilling."
"Pours a deep opaque black, some very dark brown in the far edges in the light, huge and thick brown head forms, drops some lace spots and settles down to a very thick ring, looks great. Smell is amazing, lots of bourbon, oak, vanilla, chocolate, coffee and roast, light woody sourness, toffee, toast, oats, very very rich, its hard to describe how good this smells. Perfect mix of bourbon barrel with the stout. Taste is just as amazing, buttery toffee, chocolate and bourbon, oak, vanilla, roast, figs, toast, very intense flavour, light wood astringency in the finish, perfect. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, buttery smooth. Drinks like 5%. Wow, this is an insanely good beer. Proof of perfect barrel aging, one of the best beers I've ever had. Thanks a ton Jay!"
"There was loads of chocolate in the nose on the growler version. It also had a fuller and thicker body with a slightly sweeter taste. I really liked how the barrel aging aspect was not overwhelming and would actually play the background on some sips. Just a world class brew, and I can't wait till they do growlers of this one again."
"This is a fantastic beer though I can't decide if it quite measures up to the regular version to me. Either way, it's not to be missed. Thanks again to Derek for his (continued) generosity!"
"D - OK, so not so drinkable by the strictest definition. However, it is so good, I would be forced to drink it anyway. LOL."
"Pours a very nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some chocolate/coffee/toffee notes, licorice, vanilla. The taste is malty, with some nice dark stuff thrown in. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very nice brew, highly recommended."
"Found myself talking a lot about this beer lately so might as well enter the rating. I've have 03, 04 and 06 vintage. This is for the 06. Pour is pitch black and still...hardly any head. Aroma is oak, chocolate, coffee, vanilla and a touch of bourbon. Velvety smooth taste, creamy. Sweet, but has nice malt balance and some bitterness. Very full body. Very nicely uses bourbon aging without being overpowering."
"Poured a dark brown oily color with a thin creamy head. Smelled coffee, bourbon, vanilla, malts, maybe toffee. I enjoyed this beer but it isn't my favorite style so I probably am not the best evaluator. I definitely got the bourbon taste as well as a strong vanilla flavor. Warming made the flavors more robust and brought out the alcohol intensity. It was relatively thin as far as carbonation and pretty smooth for the 12%. I would love to try again but it is definitely a sipper with a max of one for me."
"Black with faint brown edges. Thin, dark tan cap of very fine bubbles. Lots of very sticky lace. Looks great. The barrel aging really worked well with the base beer, and Speedway's no slouch on its own. Aromas of vanilla, woody oak, bourbon and booze, melded with the toffee and caramel, coffee and dark chocolate, and mild fruit character. Just a bit buttery as it warmed. Great balance in the flavour too. Plenty of roasted malts, coffee, oak, toffee and chocolate. Bitterness and hop flavour had faded somewhat, but were still present. Mild alcohol and light vanilla. Extremely smooth in texture with very fine carbonation, a bit on the low side. Full bodied, but seemed just a little thinner than I remember Speedway being. Truly an elegant beer. Delicious and wonderfully balanced. One of the high points of barrel aged beer, at least for me."
"D - This is an excellent beer. Could be easier to drink but for the strength it is pretty damn smooth and very enjoyable."
"Drinkability - The drinkability is pretty good if you enjoy bourbon, and I love bourbon. This is definitely a sipper, I am feeling pretty warm as I type this. I will have to trade for another bottle and sit on it for a while, because at this point, I think I would rather have the original version over the BA version. I would love to see how this tastes with a little age on it."
"drinkability is awesome. i've heard from several sources that the barrel-aged version was ""underwhelming", not as good as they expected, and just didn't measure up to the regular speedway. i couldn't disagree more. this shit is awesome. the rough edges from the speedway are gone, just silky smooth, well balanced, and just plain great. i really loved this one. we were trying to wring every last drop out of the bottle and wishing there was more. definitely the highlight of the night. great stuff - must find more!"
"There's much more coffee coming through in the taste. So much in fact that it's dominating the bourbon barrel aging effects. I expected just the opposite. Also was a bit thinner in the mouthfeel than I was expecting. Ends up being a bit more balanced than I was expecting. Not earth moving, but then again, don't know if this had a chance to live up to the hype."
"I would take a regular Speedway Stout over the Barrel Aged version any day if this is the best it can offer. It's still a great beer, but the bourbon is too overpowering for it to be really enjoyable, but maybe some more age would have done some good."
"Overall: It's a knock-you-on-your-assterpiece."
"I'll have to spend more quality time with some of the newer vintags to see how they compare."
"Wake up at 7:30 am, on the grounds of the beautiful Ommegang brewery. As the rain begins to fall, I see some good friends, looking like they need a good beer. So I open up my 2004 bottle # 14. The rain begins to come down harder, so I put the bottle under the shade of my open trunk. Our glasses our filled with care, and we enjoy, as the rain droplets fell into the open glassware, and onto our heads. The right beer at the right time, I love this shit!"
"A fantastic beer, no doubt. Whether it's worth the time & money to acquire, the jury's still out."
"Deep and dark, brown hues around the edges. Minimal tan head that fades quickly to a ring then to nothing. Rich and deep in the nose. Bourbon isn't showing up front but after it warms it shows more and more. Rich coffee, chocolate, and some dark fruits in the background. Bourbon...oak and vanilla show up. Taste is also pretty deep. The bourbon is more present but not dominant and imparts a nice vanilla flavor that comes in the finish. Coffee and chocolate. Some caramel and light butterscotch as well. Darker fruits still present. Mouthfeel is lacking in carbonation a bit and not as full as could be. Somewhat creamy but to silky to the point of almost being thin. Overall, it's a drinkable brew. Didn't quite live up to my expectations but it was enjoyable. I owe PHawk a huge thanks for helping me with a bottle of this. Not as good as the regular Speedway in my book but worth a try."
"Highly recommended if you can get it. 2007 vintage."
"Thanks again mbrasi."
"Notes: This is the sort of beer that, before you try it, you have to wonder if it's all hype or if it actually merits all the praise. The answer is yes, it's worth every word of praise. Incredible stuff."
"Pours a complete midnight black with a quick half finger dark brown head that fades to just about nothing. Swirling the glass leaves a few specks of lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell is coffee, booze, molasses, rich caramel, dark chocolates, vanilla, and wet oak. Lots of dark fruits in the nose as well; dates, fig, raisins, plums, and prunes. Extremely complex aroma, but I pretty much expected that. Taste, heavenly...Rich coffee flavors up front with sweet caramel and bourbon. Toffee, vanilla, and brown sugars midway with a good amount of oak. Aftertaste is roasted malts with bitter chocolate and more bourbon. The mouthfeel was a bit harsh which surprised me. I was expecting this one to be silky smooth, but there was a distinct sting to it that took away from the overall experience. Medium to full body with a mild carbonation. Wonderful complex flavors with nothing over the top that just gets better with some warmth. Thanks again Joey for the opportunity to try a beer I probably won't be able to obtain again anytime soon."
"Frankly, a better beer than the normal, and that isn't the case with the BA Numbskull and Wee Heavy, neither of which benefited from barrel aging."
"I'm glad I had someone to share this one with because it would have taken me a long time to drink it myself. (3.5)"
"Thanks to Vac (I think) for busting this out at the RBSG 08 Grand Tasting. '04 vintage. Pours pitch black with a modest cocoa head. Bourbon aromas enhance the chocolate-roast dynamic. Also some red fruitiness in the nose. Boozy chocolate flavor with a coffee roast finish. Nice warming bourbon with the swallow. Same impeccable balance I'm used to out of AleSmith."
"I am lucky to have had the chance to try these next to each other. Not something I will soon forget."
"2006. Pours black with a good sized dark tan, light brown head that very slowly recedes. Aroma is sweet vanilla and caramel, dark fruits, charred woodiness, and some leather as well. Taste is a great mixture of chocolate and vanilla, and plenty of liquid caramel. Nice bourbony and wood notes in the tangy finish, along with a small nibbly bite and warmth from the alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, carbonation is fairly light, decent peppery tingle on the tongue and warmth in the throat towards the finish. Excellent beer, vanilla and caramel notes come thru very well. Many thanks to Carlos for sharing and for this opportunity."
"Overall would have to say this one was beyond excellent. A truly wonderful beer that I really could not get enough of. I would love to have this any day of the week, and I really think that hype to the level things get is not always deserved. But I have to admit, this was really damn good!"
"Tastes oaky coffee, vanilla, cream. Chocolate rises late and tastes like a coffee bean covered in high-end chocolate. The flavors are strong, balanced in their intensities, and melded wonderfully. Mouthfeel is thick and leaves a persistent coffee hanging on the tongue. The alcohol doesn't quite wipe the palate. Fantastic drinkability, a great sipper for pondering."
"Pours black with a light tan head. Smell is roasty, chocolate and bourbon, but not too strong. Taste is almost milder than I remember the regular speedway stout being, at least in terms of alcohol, somehow. Still very mild coffee, and is hardly noticeable, with roasty chocolate and light bourbon. Good stuff."
"2006 Bottle (04/01/08 release) #142/235 provided by my cousin, I finally got a chance to share this with some beer loving friends. This looks identical to the regular speedway so I'll spare the details. The smell was dope, like regular speedway but better, my friend siad it was like candy. The flavors were also very close to the regular speedway, dark coffee bitterness. There was a little bit of a booze but it was quite subtle. This was a very solid stout but honestly I can't say it is an improvement over the regular speedway.Damn you Alesmith! The four people who drank this agreed that it was not something you would want a whole bottle of. My verdict is that this is good but don't trade your cellar away for one."
"I do like that the barrel influence does not absolutely overwhelm this beer. I am not sure if this is still too young or what, but the roasted grain notes really get overly acrid and bitter in the finish. The barrel influence also contributes to an overall impression of this being unbalanced. This is not nearly as unbalanced or undrinkable as the BA Old Numbskull though, and is even enjoyable in its own right. I think that the complexity of the aged, base beer and the lightish influence of the barrel make this at the very least worth procuring for me."
"I had a few people tell me this was their favorite beer ever and I am right there with them, certainly in my top five of all time, Speedway is good by itself but after being in a barrel it is just amazing, too bad this is only brewed every two or three years, now I know what all the hype was about, the three hour drive to get a bottle was definitely worth it, Alesmith has something going for them with their barrel aged brews, cannot wait to see what they come up with next, would be ecstatic to drink again, cannot recommend this one enough, have now had three different years and this one is for certainly for real"
"D: An interesting beer to compare to the original, both are tasty as hell and very enjoyable. All and all, the BA Speedway that I had was very interesting, but definitely a different animal than the original. If you get a chance to pick this beer up, it's worth it."
"Pours a dark black color with a mocha colored head. Head diminishes to only a ring around the glass. Smell of coffee and soft bourbon, maybe some hints of chocolate and oak. The bourbon is nicely balanced in there, it's not overpowering as so many other barrel aged stouts have been. Taste is simply exceptional. Roastiness adds a nice touch to the dark chocolate and bourbon. Hints of vanilla and oak, but I am once again impressed on how well the bourbon is integrated. It's like a soft, smooth, high quality bourbon barrel was used; it's not harsh at all. A little less than full bodied, with a soft amount of carbonation. A pure joy to drink, I am forever greatful for being given the opportunity to try this."
"The fore is hot with spicy oak notes, black chocolate, burnt malt, espresso, some light bourbon and oddly some fairly nutty notes. The coffee seems much less concentrated than in the regular version. The mouthfeel actually has held up quite well and this is a world class beer, but sadly it isnt quite the wonder beer I have dreamed for over two years. Perhaps that is my fault, but while its great its not the beer I hyped it up to be in my mind. Which still leaves a wonderful brew."
"Originally reviewed on February 18, 2005. 2004 Un-numbered bottle. Pours a dark black with no head and almost no carbonation. This doesnt bother me, since my favorite in this style was even more still. Ruddy orange fringe. Holy shit. Aroma is a building steam train of gentle coffees and tahitian vanilla beans steeped in fresh whipping cream and brown sugar. Moves into a supple and not harsh bourbon poured into gingerbread and spice cake. A hint of brandy vapor. Some savory herbal notes, with oregano and tarragon. Sweet candied limes dipped in rum sugars, with a finish of black currant and pears. Flavor is priceless and indescribable. Fuckin liquid heaven. Really hard to describe because the flavor is so similiar to the flavor, almost to a tee. Palate is a dense, absolutely syrupy sugar elixir that holds, disperses, and perform the flavors with total elegance. Finish and smack carry the very gentle and floral glowing qualities of an exquisite 21-year old single malt. A lot of the rich condensed malt and oaky finish characters ring through. More vinous then beery, with copious rich berry notes and continuing brandy and cognac vapors in the finish. Totally rounded and mellowed by the beers, with NO harsh edges. And the flavors are original each time they touch the palate, without fatigue. Finally, its a touch thin, to me, as it could be even denser, but it still has that ubiquitous cold cream texture that stays with the beer and maintains astounding density and quality as the beer continues. All around beer heaven."
"Overall: Bottle 93 of 228. Good job AleSmith. This beer is awesome. I was out of town when this beer was released. Thank you very much abizzles for so generously hooking me up. I owe you dude."
"Of course it's an amazing, well crafted beer. Now does it live up to the hype? Who knows. It was different that I expected. It's not the best beer I've ever had, but it's definitely up there. A prize to anyone, but I wouldn't sell my soul for another one."
" This gets a ""5" from me. I don't see how to improve on this. I can't wait to age my other bottle and try again in a couple of years. To all who have this beer, ENJOY! To all searching for it, GOOD LUCK"
"Awesome stuff, Cheers to the fortunate few (and everone else of coarse) !!!"
"bottle 66: Black body wears a thin off-white head. I cant wait for the old numbskull version. Obvious bourbon barrel aroma. It comes out minty (after eight chocolate) and candyish with all the usual stoutish aspects. Big whiskey and roasty suggestions. Large hop presence although the barrel aging really seems to mellow them out for the best. Bitter bourbon finish. Mild acidity doesnt alterate the pleasure. Fruity and almost anise reminiscent. Great balance for such a monster. Thick body with smooth low carbonation. Good going Alesmith. I didnt notice any coffee. To me, this is far more pleasant than the regular speedway. Thanks again hopsrus."
"Dark brown color. Medium head. Aroma is malts, dark sugar and fruits. Full bodied Imperial Stout. Malts are roasty, chocolate and coffee, with touches of vanilla and dark fruit. The brandy/bourbon flavor is evident. Nice blend of chocolate, wood and smoke. Very smooth. Bourbon and chocolate flavors blend well together. Touch of alcohol bite. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
