Taste is very layered, and complex. Get waves of baker's and milk chocolate, red licorice, vanilla, brown sugar, and a dry cinnamon and chile finish.  Mouthfeel is substantial and oily. This beer really leaves it's mark.  Overall this is an outstanding beer. I think I might like chile kick of a Prairie Bomb a bit more, but this is a more complex treat.","OneEye78","Wednesday at 10:45 AM"

But for those not as cinnamon-obsessed, this might be the best of the ""Big Three"" cinnamon/chocolate/pepper imperial stouts. The vanilla separates it from Mexican Cake and Abraxas, but that inclusion doesn't really rear its head as much in the fresh beer as it does once it gets some age on it.","LambicPentameter","Mar 31, 2015"

The usual roastiness and chocolate of a high end example of the style is all there but I am also greeted with a zany mixture of heat and cinnamon spice. The flavor brings forth more of the same flavor intricacies. Thick chocolate and roasted coffee followed by a peppy chili heat. Not overly hot but the heat tickles the back of the tongue. The cinnamon is also very easy to detect and I admittedly enjoy this more than what the chills give off. Thick bodied. Lingering aftertaste. I find some noticeable bitterness. A lot going on in this revered brew. I was not in love with all of it but there is surely plenty to find appealing.","VelvetExtract","Mar 22, 2015"

I can taste this beer 5 minutes after taking a sip because it cots the mouth and throat so heavily.

Opaque black body with a tan head that settles but leaves good lacing for such a high ABV brew. Aroma is cocoa, coffee, pepper, cinnamon, and dark malt. Taste is off-the-charts good - sweet chocolate, vanilla, and malt; bitter spice and coffee; subtle chili pepper and booze warmth. Full body, thick, creamy texture, soft but appropriate carbonation, warming boozy finish.","SierraFlight","Feb 10, 2015"

Heat from the chilis does not linger and is pleasant, not overpowering. All in all it is a world class brew and cannot wait to open my second bottle on a special occasion. You will not be disappointed if you enjoy this style of brew. Even if you are not a fan of spiced stouts you will probably enjoy this.

Taste: This is a flavor explosion of the best kind. In addition to the cinnamon and vanilla the spiciness of the peppers really stands out. Feel: Carbonation is fairly normal for having almost a year of age. Overall: This is one of the best stouts I've ever had. It's incredibly balanced and everything an Imperial Stout should be.

4.88,6.6,5,5,4.75,4.75,5,"I was very excited to try this beer, and courtesy of a fellow beer nerd and friend who moved to Florida in the last year, I was finally able to acquire this mythical beer.  It pours jet black and has very little head, a little bit formed at the tail end of the pour but that was it.  The smell is moderately sweet and smells like a blend of cinnamon, vanilla, & a hint of chilies.  NOW... the most important part: the taste.  This beer is extremely well balanced, especially for a flavored stout.  At first you get a sweet taste that incorporates the chilies and cinnamon, which transitions into a slightly bitter cocoa taste before finishing with a smooth vanilla.  The mouthfeel can be described in one word: smooth.  For as complex as this beer is, it is incredibly smooth.  I recommend anyone without direct access to this beer to do everything you can do to arrange a trade, It's worth about 95% of the insane amount of hype it gets, which is quite an accomplishment.","Pourharddrinkslow","Jan 26, 2015"

4.75,3.7,,,,,,"2014. Thanks Chadwick for sharing. Pours pitch black with a thick mocha head that settles quickly into a foamy cap. Good lacing. Lots going on in the aroma - chocolate, coffee, vanilla, spiciness, roasted malt, and booze. Lots of roastiness on the tongue, dark chocolate, coffee and some decent chili heat make this a most complex stout. Full bodied with little carbonation. Overall, an extremely well crafted and incredibly complex stout.","JohnG190","Aug 20, 2014"

Taste is amazing!  It is very complete.  The spice from the chilies is minor and gives a great little accent to the chocolate, vanilla sweet that takes center stage.","dexterk1","Aug 17, 2014"

I wish the cinnamon and vanilla were a bit more prominent and the cocoa nibs were a bit less, but those are fairly minor complaints considering the overall complexity of this beer. If you are lucky enough to get your hands on one, do not pass up the chance. Well worth it.","Tim_S","Aug 01, 2014"

Offers a long and delicate spicy finish and easy drinkability, particularly with a lack of overbearing sweet/viscous quality. Overall pretty solid but excessive variation from bottle to bottle seems to be an issue. Taste and feel impress while smell/appearance need more carbonation to do so predictably.","HalfFull","Beers"

Basically, it was drinking really well even more so than the 2013, which is why I feel this merited a re-review. The chocolate fudge is very strong here, but the peppers come across as a strong vegetal flavour without a ton of heat; the cinnamon is there in the nose and is more subtle, combining with the vanilla bean to add a lot of complexity to both the nose and the palate. The cinnamon isn't exactly Abraxas or Cinnamon Toast Crunch, but I personally find a bit more complexity in here than Abraxas and Mexican Cake; plus the base Zhukov's A and M kill everything else I've had. It's a true pleasure every time I drink this beer.","Stevedore","Jun 15, 2014"

Another surprisingly balanced chili pepper stout (though not surprising from CC), dark roasted malt, dark chocolate, toffee, dark fruits (prunes) but finishes with warm chili peppers.

Subtle red wine-like grapiness on the back palate. The finish is all cocoa powder. Dense and heavy in the best ways. The pour was almost the best part: thick, it nearly oozes into my glass and I fear a head is impossible.

A little fruitiness from the chilis and some dark baker's chocolate on the nose as well but mostly wet tobacco. The taste is really bitter dark chocolate with loads of richness throughout. The flavors have already really melded together on this 2013 bottle. They play well. There is no chili heat but some fruitiness. The body is nice and viscous to stand up to the big flavors. It's a bit of a sipper though. It needs to be split multiple ways with friends.","PHBoiler","Dec 11, 2013"

Unfortunately, the head quickly fades with no lacing. Dark chocolate fudge dominates the nose along with hints of mocha, chili, black cherries, tobacco, and vanilla. The taste follows suit with tons of chocolate fudge up front. As it warms, the chili's really emerge but don't overpower. Also getting hints of bitter cocoa, cinnamon, tobacco, and vanilla. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with a bitter, off-putting finish. Overall, I definitely enjoyed this beer, but no way did it live up to the hype.","beerdrifter","Nov 15, 2013"

Smelled a bit oxidized as it warmed, not as pleasant. Taste is decent. Standard RIS with flavors of chile and very faint chocolate. The vanilla was absent until it warmed a bit. The unfortunate oxidization masks the potential of both the cocoa nibs and vanilla. I was hoping these flavors would be the highlight of the beer. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy. Overall, I'm a tad disappointed. I see the great scores, yet I'm perhaps distracted by a fridge full of Black Tuesday and Chocolate Rain that I know will never let me down. I can't help but think that Goose Island and the Bruery are way ahead of the flavored stout game.","PlinyBeMiney","Sep 17, 2013"

Somewhat mole-ish but without the peanut butter...soft ancho-esque chilis. Alcohol is big, but well integrated. Mouthfeel is soft and lowly carbed. Truly a unique stout to behold, I kind of wish it was a little more milk chocolaty. The dark fruit adds a nice little complex twist. Its really good, but I wouldnt put it in my personal top 10 stouts.","twiggamortis420","Aug 15, 2013"

When I poured it and smelled it, I was a bit concerned that the hype train may be striking again. It looks and smells very good, but I remember thinking that I’ve had stouts that were similar in both departments. However, I was proven very wrong once I tasted it. This beer is very special and has a phenomenal blend of flavors that all work perfectly together. The mouthfeel is also fantastic. The cherry on top is that I have no idea where all the alcohol in this beer is hiding. It is extremely drinkable for an 11% ABV imperial stout. I am so, so glad that I got to try this one and I’d love the opportunity to have it again. It’s definitely worth seeking out. Thanks, Joel!","BlackBelt5112203","Jul 26, 2013"

It has more bite coming off draft, but the flavors really mingle and mellow out in a good way after it's been aged. Pours thick like motor oil and smells of dark chocolate with chiles and vanilla mmmm. I've had the lairds apple brandy huna on tap as well, but I prefer the original, although I have yet to try the California Brandy Huna (2013). Overall, great beer across the board and I use this as a standard when comparing any imperial stout!","ChrisRoemer","Jun 26, 2013"

Thick chocolate syrup, dark chocolate, licorice, nutmeg and cinnamon flavors come out up front. Lingering chocolate covered pitted fruits, licorice and roast coats the digestive track long after every sip. Thick body with a creamy syrupy mouthfeel and a light level of carbonation.

Aroma of deep velvet chocolate notes with light spicy notes and some light vanilla and cinnamon can also be detected. Taste is a mix between some deep chocolate notes with light cinnamon and vanilla a with some residual sugar notes with dry bitter notes subtle finish. Body is full with limited filtration and with a smooth texture with almost motor oil-like consistency. Extremely complex while retaining a good level of drinkability.

I served the beer at 55 degrees and over an hour drank this beer and let it warm to room temp. It smells like carbonation was rushed if that makes sense to home brewers. I did not get any of the spice or vanilla... it just tastes like a creamy chocolate milk stout... not that that is bad, I just expected a lot more from this... I think this is the first beer where I gave the highest rating due to the appearance... due to it's price/rarity and what it is trading for I would give the beer a 2 out of 5.","jdprmd","Apr 30, 2013"

The smell of the beer is a little boozy, there is molasses on the nose, deep roasted malts and some sweet cocoa. The taste of the beer is pretty complex, the spices come through pretty strong, the vanilla is very subtle in the finish. The flavors are very rich. The mouthfeel is thick, oily and heavy. The carbonation is minimal. Overall I was hyping this up in my mind to be much better than what I felt it turned out to be. You win some, you lose some.

Mr. Hunahpu pours an extremely dark black with a one finger khaki head that lasts for ages, and is one for the ages. The nose brings me massive joy, I feel like a phish kid listening to Harry Hood for this first time. Glorious aromas: Huge dark chocolate, vanilla bean, roasted malts, and some spice from the chili's. There is a strong scent a cinnamon as well. The taste is extremely unique for a stout, it's very impressive and still not was I was expecting after reading so many reviews. Flavors of extremely dark chocolate take over my palate, along with notes of vanilla, spicy cinnamon, and bitter caramelized coffee. Hunahpu's is extremely flavorful and complex but not as full bodied as I was expecting. It's more of a smooth bodied and drinkable stout. The nose is the best part and the taste follows in superb fashion. The spice sets this beer apart from other stouts. It definitely lives up to the hype!","mnphish","Mar 24, 2013"

Pours syrupy, motor oil thick out of the bottle with a half finger of densely packed mocha foam. The nose hits you with rich milky chocolate, carribean spice, a slight vegetal (green) chili nose as well, no vanilla of note but heady, complex stuff. The taste while not as complex as the nose brings really rich, chewy chocolate mousse brownie, whispers of roasted coffee and as it warms a pleasant spice of chili that plays beautifully with the heavy upfront dose of chocolate. Huge and chewy beer that just coats your mouthand all the way down. Alcohol is not noticeable though this is a definte sipping, after dinner beer that is best shared by friends. Highly impressive and worth the hype, scared to think how in your face this beast must be when its fresh.","Trilogy31","Mar 02, 2013"

Head was a shade of brown as dark as any I’ve seen. Mouthfeel was thick with mild carbonation. Aroma is rich with chocolate, mild roast, big vanilla and some interesting spice. Dark chocolate, cocoa, vanilla all come through big in the taste, as well. I’m not a big fan of chili in beer, but it’s very nice in this one, only hitting in the finish with a bit of spice. This sort of super rich chocolatey imperial stout is right up my alley for the style. Hops are present but more of a background player. Pretty sweet but it works well for the beer. Just a big, rich beer that drinks even bigger than 11% abv. Very impressive.","popery","Jan 24, 2013"

I think the base beer here, Zhukov, is one of my least favorite Imperial stouts. The Hunahpu treatment is a shoe in for an amazing beer, but the base beer is just so bad that you can’t hide from it.

From first whiff, I was greeted with lovely cocoa and cinnamon. Some bitter-sweet chocolate with just a bit of chile aroma...I'm assuming there was more when this was fresh. Taste is spicy cinnamon at first, which immediately turns to sweet cinnamon. Some vanilla there as well. There sure is a lot of cinnamon flavor to this beer, which makes for a unique stout. A lot of cocoa and chocolate with just the slightest chile flavor. All these flavors mesh really well together. Wouldn't call it a complex beer per se, but definitely well-balanced. ABV hidden well. Mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is one tasty imperial stout.

The aroma is extremely sweet with some soy and a noticeable dose of peppers going on... vanilla floating around in there too. The flavor is extremely sweet with chocolate, roasted malts, dark fruits, and more. A certain ashiness comes with warmth as well. The peppers come through with a hint of burn in the mouthfeel, which is well carbonated but still quite thick. Yummy!","drowland","Feb 03, 2012"

Deep black pour with that signature Cigar City imperial stout head. Just a ridiculous shade of neon brown. Boozy roasty aroma, robust chocolate, fresh coffee, light iodine. Massive dark chocolate flavor, light smokiness, cocoa, and a mild vanilla bean note. The chilies are pretty subdued at this point but they still impart a bit of flavor without any heat. Viscous heavy bitter mouthfeel, not boozy. Nice glass-staining legs. Killer beer.","illidurit","Jan 30, 2012"

Roast malt and char are strong with potent vanilla sweetness and dry cinnamon. Chili spice is present in the finish, but not as strong as I remember from previous samples.

The nose has a lot of chocolate, then the next most powerful is vanilla, and lastly cinnamon I don't pick up any peppers which is a little sad. Now with the taste some things change that I didn't expect where I didn't smell a lot of cinnamon I pick it up more in the taste also with the vanilla. The chocolate play background to the cinnamon and vanilla, but this time I pick up just a slight hint of pepper which is very hard to notice (maybe I need to try it fresher). The mouthfeel is amazing its just what I expect out of big world class stouts. Huge massive, chewy body that coats the inside of my mouth and lingers. This was a huge want of mine mainly due to having Conquistador De Muerte from FFF and loving it due to the spicy pepper presence. I expected Huna to be just as spicy but alas it wasn't. But all in all an amazing beer that I would love to try on tap.","phisigben","Jan 03, 2012"

It's almost dessert like. The flavors feature a nice array of chocolates, roasted malts, cinnamon, nutmeg, other spice with light ancho peppers. It's very, very good and coats your palate.

4.95,8.1,5,5,5,4.5,5,"From tasting notes, 750ml bottle. Pours black, black, black with dark tan head; light only shows through the very edges of the glass. Looks like Abyss when poured. Smells like cold coffee and chocolate. Taste is sweet brown sugar with tart grain astringency and chocolate bitterness to balance it out. Cold coffee, malt sugar, restrained hops, and bitter dark chocolate on the mid-back tongue; very slight smoke flavor makes itself known only when you aren't looking for it, kind of tastes like burnt coffee a bit but in a pleasant way. The sweet and sour balancing act is great, there is a lot going on in this beer. I think the sour I'm picking up is the cherry and oak notes that keep playing hid and seek. There is a lot going on here in the taste department, one of the best RIS I've had to date. Extremely well balanced yet still very flavorful, and very drinkable. This is a great desert beer and I wish I could get my hands on a bottle to save for Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner, something of that nature.","youradhere","Oct 07, 2011"

4.25,-7.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Opal colored pour with a massive chocolate mousse brown head; absolutely gorgeous. Aroma is way better than the Zhukov we just tasted; the chili pepper, cocoa nib and cinnamon are all prevalent, adding to the base of roasted malt, coffee, and burnt wood. Flavor is otherworldy; has every awesome aspect of your typical imperial stout, but the pepper and cinnamon just add a whole other dimension. The spicy notes do override some of the roast and chocolate a bit, but it’s welcome, and those characteristics are still discernible, not entirely masked. The palate is viscous, thick, and full flavored throughout. Absolutely top notch.","cosmo4u","Sep 18, 2011"

Pours pitch black with a one finger brown head that rises from the ashes and subsides to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma is comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, chiles, vanilla, and subtle cinnamon. The flavor is of sweet malt, roasted malt, deep dark chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, sweet alcohol, wood, and chile heat on the followthrough. It has a heavy feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this is an excellent brew! The flavors and aromas on this one are really complex and excellent. For the ABV this one is really smooth and quite drinkable. I am a big lover of spicy food and the followthrough on this one really appeals to me. Really glad I am getting to try this one as I never have before. A definite must try for sure...

4.25,-7.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Just tasted a 2010 bottle from a trade, poured into a tulip glass. Pours deep black with a wicked reddish brown head that fades quickly, but leave lacing everywhere it touched. I didn't pick up on the chile's, but the smell was otherwise dominated by dark chocolate, hints of vanilla, cinamonn, and a touch of oak. Lots going on in the smell, but the taste was more one dimensional, not bad, mind you, but not quite as complex as the aroma. It's definately up there as one of the best RIS's I've had. The alcohol is hidden well, and drinks very easily considering how thick and heavy the beer is.","tripelhops","Jul 16, 2011"
3.68,-19.7,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,3,"Pour is viscous like motor oil - thick and black with oily brown head and a body that coats the glass and hangs out anywhere it goes. The nose is dark chocolate, roasted malts, and a hint of vanilla and spice. I don't get the peppers. Good, but nothing special. Controversy in the taste. Split this with a few non-BA beer lovers - people who love a good brown ale but are rarely exposed to crazy 750mL imperial stouts. They thought it was really good, whereas I did not. Either way, the chilis hit you in the throat in a very minor fashion. They must have faded considerably looking at other reviews because I get them only as a mime for heartburn, and barely or not at all on the back of the tongue. This makes them not a particularly pleasant addition. The spices and the vanilla are mostly masked as well. The taste is dramatically like a really, really dark chocolate - but one that is not too bitter as to be overly dry. In fact, in contrast to almost everyone, I found this to be pretty one-note. It drinks kind of easy for what it is, with a big body and low carbonation. It really didn't come together for me and I kind of wish I had had it fresh.","seeswo","Jul 13, 2011"

The scent and taste are so delicious and unbelievably complex. The body is basically perfect. The bit of alcohol heat is masked by the chilies, so it's surprisingly easy to drink. This would be better fresh, I suppose, but I'm sure it would still be great after some years in the cellar. I love this beer and need more ASAP.","Pencible","Beers"

I wish I could smell this beer forever. Each whiff brings a different smell be it Ovaltine, Blackened peppers, tobacco, dark dark chocolate. The smell alone is phenomenal. Onto the taste, with the first sip you get a burst of deep roasted chocolate and as you let that that linger you get a grilled pepper flavor that dances in your mouth. Every sip is different from the next. The mouthfeel is nice but not in your face. The chilies play a good role in letting the tingling sensation coat your mouth without burning your tongue. Also this beer leaves your mouth feeling dry like a tannic wine, but it works! Overall I am ecstatic I got to try this beer and would love to snag another bottle!","deathcharms","0"

4.6,0.4,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Poured from bomber into tulip glass. In Mayan myth, Hunahpu gave cocoa to the Mayans. The base recipe is Marshal Zhukov Imperial Stout. It is aged on pasilla and ancho peppers as well as vanilla, cinnamon and cocoa nibs. Pours a pitch black body with a half thick, dense and creamy, very dark brown head that leaves nice lacing throughout. Aroma has lots of vanilla coffee, roast, some really pronounced cocoa and nips, hops, and spices. Some vanilla, chile peppers, and caramel. Flavor is similar and very rich. Lots of chocolate and cocoa nibs, caramel, vanilla, roasts, and coffee. Some light chiles, smoke, dark fruits, wood, and cinnamon spice. Finishes very rich, but fairly bitter from the hops, roasts, and cocoa nibs. Slowly dries with some vanilla, earth, and plenty of chocolate in a lengthy, rich aftertaste. Thick and sticky, yet smooth body with a soft, light carbonation. There was some light lingering heat in the finish. Overall, a really nice Imperial Stout that I went great lengths to acquire. Lots of rich flavors, very roasty, well hopped, and definitely has some pretty cool vanilla-chile things going on. Good one.","CuriousMonk","May 26, 2011"

The bottle that I had opened was damaged a little in shiping and some air got into the bottle so it tasted a little flat but was still hands down one of my favorite beers. Pour it in a glass and it looks like motor oil with a dark chocolate brown head. You can smell the chocolate and what ever peppers they used in brewing. Chocolate came through strongest in the taste for me along with the peppers, hints of coffee as well.

4.44,-3.1,3,4,5,4,4.5,"Hunahpu's pours the typical solid stout black, with at most a finger and a half of *dark* caramel foam topping it. Retention is decent, but lacing is barely there. The nose is a bit muted, but what is there is intoxicating. Rich chocolate is the centerpiece, and it's buoyed by notes of cinnamon and peppery spice. The aroma may have been a bit dull, but that wasn't the case once the beer hit my lips. What would have been a deep dark chocolate base is brought much closer to milk chocolate from the sweetness from the vanilla beans. Cinnamon acts as the transition to a spicy, almost smoky finish from the chiles. Everything is in perfect proportion as well, with the chocolaty notes forming the basis of the flavor profile, and then filtering down to cinnamon and then chiles. The body is perfectly rich and creamy, but the carbonation isn't quite up to the task of cutting through all that. Hunahpu's isn't quite elite in every facet, but it brings it where it counts (the flavor). I'll be doing my best to acquire some more in the future.","axeman9182","Apr 01, 2011"

Absolutely bursting at the seams with rich chocolate, molasses, and vanilla sweetness up front, and the cinnamon and chili peppers take over mid-palate to dry out the finish with an earthy, organic gingerbread note that draws me in sip after glorious sip. Mouthfeel is rich and velvety with a picture perfect carbonation level. Honestly, this beer has little room for improvement. I had my doubts about Cigar City after being let down by a few of their more hyped offerings, but 2011 Hunahpu's is the real deal.

The nose on this beer is as complex as the palate. Chocolate, char, vanilla, earthy peppers and alcohol hit the nose full force. The palate of this beer is immensely layered. I first get dark bitter chocolate that is quickly sweetened by the vanilla treatment and chocolatey malt character. Following that comes earthy smokey peppers that compliment the deep roastiness of the malts with slight heat to kick. The heavy viscosity and moussey carbonation combine for a luxurious and velvety mouthfeel. I enjoy my beer with food, hunahpu will make good company with spicy, savory and rich ethnic dishes.","jewbrew","Beers"

Impressions of cherry (from the cinnamon and chocolate notes) and oak (from the vanilla and pepper tannins) blossom, the warm spice of the cinnamon and vanilla coming through most in the end. The body is as lush, soft, and full as any I've ever found, the beer hampered only by a ragged, lengthy, puckering bitterness. The roasted grains, aggressive hopping, and adjuncts add up to an overly bitter brew, even for my tastes. Despite this somewhat harsh and unpleasant finish, the lush body and intriguing complexities make this a superior brew. Hopefully they tone down the roasted barley and hops a touch to bring it fully into balance. A great beer just shy of transcendent.","errantnight","Feb 23, 2011"

However the aroma was VERY sweet, like sugar and coffee and dark malts dipped in sugar and than encased in a shell of sugar. Taste was very sweet.

3.99,-12.9,5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Huge thanks to Thirstybird for breaking this one out for our tasting. I've been wanting to try this beer for some time. This is by far, the best looking big stout I've ever seen. Pours an inky black with a dense, dark mocha-colored head tinged with a reddish-brown hue. Cap is so thick and dense that it is only pierced by tiny pinpricks. Thick sheets of lacing slide down the walls of the glass following each tilt. Nose reveals chocolate, spice and booze - it's all a bit much in my opinion and any subtlety is lost here. Taste is rich and chocolatey on a bold malty backbone. Spicy and sweet intermingles nicely, but gets to be a bit cloying after continued consumption. Finish is slightly burnt and bitter, which helps to cut the sweetness, but only marginally. Mouthfeel is exceptional - medium/heavy in consistency with a light carbonation and a pleasant creamy texture. I'm never quite sure of what to expect from a ""spiced"" stout; however, Hunahpu's makes it work. This is perhaps the biggest Stout I've had to date in terms of body, feel and complexity. That being said, a little goes a long way. It's extremely rich and the complex flavors get to be a little tough to handle over time. Personally, I think this beer would be better served in a 12oz. bottle rather than a 750ml.","Jwale73","Feb 14, 2011"

Aroma of bitter chocolate, lots of cocoa, tons of graham cracker (including some cinnamon), roasted malt, toffee, vanilla, oak. Flavor is quite chocolatey up front with a definite peppery spice note and a chalky, chocolatey finish. Graham cracker still present but less so. As I continue to drink, the pepper/chile spiciness really starts to heat up my mouth. This is one of the most chocolatey beers I've ever had.

4.35,-5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4," The taste of this is broad, lots of complex spice and malt qualities at play here. The taste of the dark malt is slightly cococa enhanced and seems nutty,but that my just be the earthy vanilla presence. The slight spice distracts from the alcohol in the flavor and gives a nice complimentary accent to the caramel malt flavor and roasted notes round out the big stout. The spicing really adds to this beer, it feels like one I would want to enjoy in the winter or the holidays, lots of festive flavors in the mix which work so well with the base stout. The pepper is mild but this adds to the drinkability for me with the nutty earthy and cinnamon quality making for a unique brew and highly drinkable stout.","Slatetank","Dec 10, 2010"

The bottle poured out a thick creamy consistent black brew with a light choclate head that lingered for a few minutes. I could smell the beer as it sat in my glass, awaking itself from its hibernation. The smell was of the best chocolate you have smelled in your enitre life, but! it was balanced with some bright bitterness and spice like none other. The flavor was tantilizing. My mouth salavated after the first sip. I went right back in for a second. Beer porn at its finest. The flavor was of chocolate molten lava cake with spices and heat from the ancho chilis. I was in heaven. ITs too bad they didn't brew more of this. This is easily the best beer on the market, and it would be the #1 rated beer on BA too. My suggestions, drop black tuesday and come down to Florida for the release of this champion.","bernardus1212","Beers"

To say that there is a lot going on here would be an understatement but none of the flavors ran over each and other and all seemed to wait their turn to shine as you work your way through the profile. That's mostly probably a compliment to the well balanced base of the Marshall Zhukov being able to broadcast itself while still supporting all of the extra flavors that were added here. Just impeccable drinkibility for a Stout this size as well, as despite the onslaught of different characters being at work and the high ABV, I never felt palate fatigue in the slightest as I worked through the bottle. This one lived up the hype. Just a tremendously complex, interesting, and drinkable Imperial Stout.","Kegatron","Sep 27, 2010"

One great smelling beer. Taste mirror the nose's complexity and character, the interaction between the chiles and the cocoa nibs is superlative, and this is a surprisingly smooth beer, not sticky at all, and you'd never guess this is an 11% ABV beer.

I'm very attracted to this beer. I love the sticky lacing. The smell is complex, possibly a little to much. A lot of different scents going on and a little tough to focus on just one. Cocoa and roasted malts are very apparent. Hints of dark fruits, tobacco, and molasses linger in the background. Mild spiciness in the nostrils also, probably due to the chiles and cinnamon. I can smell the alcohol in this. The more I smell this, the more I'm put off by the smell. As I hoped, the taste is outstanding. Delicious and roasty. I can taste cocoa and rich malts. The cocoa is slightly perfect for me, just there enough in the finish to be perfect. A little spiciness, but not quite what I was hoping for from the presence of the chiles and the cinnamon, but none the less, this is mostly on point. The richness of the cocoa and the vanilla make for a nostalgic feeling of comforting hot chocolate. The mouth feel is great. The subtle carbonation is great for all the complex flavors in this. Thick and delicious, just what I expected from this Imperial Stout. Good drinkability for everything going on in this beer. A bit heavy and slightly boozy, but I want this to be a sipper anyhow.","Bendurgin","Jun 24, 2010"

There is the aroma of roasted chocolate and vanilla malt. Definitely some spice in the nose with a hint of toffee Heath Bar. This beer's taste is bold-very demanding, and warming.

In spite of the ABV, there's no heat to this. Body is extremely thick, one of the thickest beers I've had. But not syrupy in the least. Carbonation is medium.

3.96,-13.5,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Viscous, pitch black, dark brown head. Smells pretty standard stouty (roasty, coffee-y, chocolatey etc) with a little bit of smoked chiles. The core of the taste is also pretty standard big stout flavors more coffee, chocolate, roastiness, brown sugar, a little bit of dark fruit. What sets this one apart though is the subtle underlying flavors. First, the peppers are a really unique addition. My buddies said they tasted a lot of chiles but I only got them very subtly with just a tiny bit of heat that slowly builds with each sip to the point of being noticeable. Vanilla is there for a subtle smoothness, and there is a bit of spiciness (cinnamon) that you have to go searching for. Maybe I only went looking for these subtleties because they were promised on the label and would have missed them otherwise, but this wasn't a blind tasting so everything (including the label) is part of the drinking experience. Mouthfeel is creamy, and thick with a comforting warmth. With everything going on here a small 8-10 oz pour was plenty, I took my time with it and was not particularly sad to see the bottom of the glass feeling like I had thoroughly experienced the beer. Unfortunately while I can't put my finger on why while it was an interesting, unique beer it just didn't blow me away like I had hoped it would.","Shumista","Jun 02, 2010"

The head slowly settles down into a thin but dense cap, with excellent stickage and fantastic walls of lacing. Nose is roasty, light notes of smooth espresso and dark cocoa, bit of tobacco, and a mix of dark fruits and licorice. The taste, however, lives up to the expectations. Huge, deep chocolate and beautiful roastiness up front segue into big dark fruit, blackstrap molasses, more chocolate, and a nice smokiness. Alcohol emerges with a bit of booziness right before the finish, smoky pepper heat, and a firm, sharp, roasty bitterness that carries hints of burnt sugar. Mouthfeel is thick and full-bodied, decadent, with a firm underlying carbonation.","Anthony1","Apr 17, 2010"

What an amazing beer, the pour was jet black with the head a red in color, almost evil looking. Smell was malty, with coffee, cocoa and a faint smell of the peppers.

What seems balanced and complex to my nose often fails the palate test, and this is no different. Opening thick and heavy with a lot of heavily roasted malt character, there's a touch of char as well. A little anise is noticeable early, but there's a grainy, husky tannic character. Prominent cocoa character is present. Vanilla appears mid palate, with the cinnamon and chili character being low (both of which could be a cultural bias, since I use quite a fair bit of both spices in my cooking and the moderate level isn't really noticeable to me). Finishing with a boozy sweetness, the mouthfeel is definitely flabby, not well integrated at all, quite disjointed, in fact. Full in body with medium-low level of carbonation, this isn't my cup of tea. It's not drinkable in large quantities, and doesn't strike me as a particularly well-crafted beer. I drank about 6-8oz, and was quite content.","DefenCorps","Mar 22, 2010"

After first sip you can taste the cinnamon, coffee, and a hint of brown sugar and vanilla. Pretty complex and matures well while reaching room temperature. I would say slightly chilled is a great temperature for this aggressive beer. It is very smooth and easy to drink. Not an extremely thick Imperial stout.

One of the best I've had to date.. I know this is sounding redundant coming from me lately, but Wayne and Joey at CCB are brewing some of the best beer in the world right now. A must have!

4.82,5.2,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Inky black and totally opaque, this one coats the glass like used motor oil. Mocha colored head quickly dissipates to leave scattered lace. As I turn the glass, it clings to the side like a full-bodied red wine . Rich chocolate malt up front followed by vanilla and cinnamon on the nose. The chiles come in a bit at the end with some spice. Sweet chocolate up front followed by vanilla, before the cinnamon kicks in and brings it all together. After a few sips the pepper spice hits the back of my throat. Everything opens up as it warms. This is truly a joy. Coats my palate and finishes dry with a bit of alcohol warmth and an aftertaste that I hope doesn't go away. My favorite stout by far.","McDiddyPop","Feb 12, 2009"
4.57,-0.2,4.5,5,4.5,5,4,"Another one of the CCB treats I had at The Brass Tap. Poured jet black into a tulip, with a dark brown head that looks very dense. This beer certainly does not look like it is messing around. Amazingly complex aroma, the coffee hits you up front, but a parade of roasted malt, chocolate, and that firey chili follows closely behind. This complexity comes through in the taste, as well, as the dominant chocolate malt backbone is supported by many other flavors. There are some hints of tobacco in the background, and that chili adds some spicey fireworks in your mouth towards the end. Not surprisingly, a rather dense beers that weighs heavy in the mouth. As I have stated all along, a ton things going on in this beer, a very enjoyable stout, but not one you can have too much of.","bhalter8","Feb 02, 2009"
4.59,0.2,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Wow. When you look up complex in the beer dictionary, this beer should be the first entry. Holy moly, where to begin. Pours black with a thin dark head. Aroma is cocoa, some peppers, cinnamon, earth, alcohol, malt, chocolate, coffee, and spice. Flavor does not disappoint, either: cocoa, coffee, cinnamon, cocoa, tobacco, peppery chilies, vanilla, spice, and complexity. Lots of yellow lace swirls around this teeming dervish of flavor. Deep, complex, earthy, and robust. Liquid awesome in a glass.","markwise","Feb 02, 2009"
4.3,-6.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"On Cask at Atlanta Cask Ale Tasting - Pours opaque black with almost no head and extremely light lacing. Smells of dark chocolate and coffee, heavy roasted and burnt malts. Flavor is coffee and chocolate - moderately sweet and bitter. Mouthfeel is medium bodied but very under carbonated. This puppy is easy to drink and easy to love. The BJCP Judges' winner...and rightly so.","ATLbeerDog","Jan 23, 2009"
4.25,-7.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Drinkability: Very nice. Beers with peppers have come a long, long way since the infamous Cave Creek Chili Beer, haven't they? Without a doubt, I'm sure Crazy Ed is smiling down from heaven at Hunahpu's Imperial Stout.","ChainGangGuy","Beers"
4.58,0,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Bottle courtesy of JRedner in November, 2008. Pours a murky dark black color with a thick tan head that settles slowly. Aroma is strongly of dark chocolate, cocoa, peppers, dark ripe fruit, some hints of coffee, roasted malt and toffee. Flavor is amazingly complex with notes of dark ripe fruit, dark chocolate, roasted malts, chilis, coffee, toffee, pepper, caramel. There is a lot going on in this beer. Full body with a lingering sweet malty toffee finish. The acclaim is well deserved as this is an amazing beer.","Kiefdog","0"
