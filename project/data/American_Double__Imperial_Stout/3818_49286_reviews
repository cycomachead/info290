"Too alcohol forward.  At 10% it should be expected I suppose.  Flavor was good otherwise but the finish was hot and felt out of balance to me"
"This was strong in nearly every sense of the world and even though this booze wasn't a detraction here, a bit less of it and some more flavor would have made this outstanding. It reminded me  too much of the Southern Tier Choklat with a bit of the Oat thrown in for good measure. In a style crowded with a lot of big names, this one fell short because of this overlap but if you're looking for a dessert in a bottle, this would be a good a choice as nearly any!"

"More like Chocolate brewed with coffee and a stout!  The nose and taste is amazingly chocolatey.  Perhaps a bit ""too far"" for drinking more than a glass, but overall a great ST offering."

"Overall- Wonderful chocolate flavors dominate, milk chocolate sweetness counterbalanced by dark chocolate and roasty coffee bitterness. Wonderful creamy quality to this beer, almost an airy marshmellow flavor and quality floats through. Not overly sweet, but decadent and rich."
"If you like Creme Brule you will love this its a lot less sweet."

"After trying a bottle of Southern Tier Mokah and a bottle of Choklat, I am convinced that the Mokah tastes nearly of no coffee and is much more heavy on the chocolate, while the Choklat is a coffee bomb with only a little chocolate flovor."
""
""
""
""
""
"Primarily notes for self….Wicked chocolaty, more so than coffee. Had had before and was underwhelmed.  Enjoyed it very much this time."
""
"O: it's got a great taste but it's sweet as hell and has an acidic end on it like it wasn't meant to be drank in large quantities but for a sugary coffee chocolate bomb it does it well"
""
""
""
""
"This is a delicious beer, it just doesn't taste even remotely like coffee.  I had it in a growler that filled from a year old keg, so I'm wondering if the coffee flavor mellowed an extreme amount.  It basically just tasted like a more mellow version of Choklat.  Like every Southern Tier stout, this one is more of a dessert beer, but not as sweet as above mentioned Choklat.  I enjoyed this beer, it just wasn't what I was expecting."

"HUGE chocolate milk presence attacks the taste buds instantly. Coffee notes stand predominant on the backend. After taste literally feels like I drink a coffee shop mocha. The only thing I can ever knock Southern Tier for is how incredibly 'sweet' there brews are. This one is masked a little better with the bitterness of the coffee than chocolaT. Nonetheless still has a very sweet taste. Would love to see it barrel aged. A bold stout worth seeking out~"

"O - This reminds me of a sweeter version of Founders Breakfast Stout. A very nice sipper for cold night."
""

"Bottle shared. Pours dark black with brown head. Aroma of chocolate and coffee. Tastes of chocolate and a hint of coffee. Slightly bitter at the back end. Medium bodied. Delicious!"

"O Its hard to believe that this thing has 10% ABV because it drinks more like an milk/sweet stout than an imperial. I would consider this a desert beer..  it most certainly delivers the promise that its name implies."
""
""
""
"My favorite of the Southern tier stouts. Not as sweet as Creme brûlée but sweeter and smoother than chokolat. This beer can best be described as a liquid tootsie roll. Really enjoyable. Poured from a bomber into my Stone snifter. Will be buying or trading for more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours opaque black like brewed coffee.  No head.  Smell is mostly chocolate and coffee.  Mouthfeel is odd, much more carbonated, like a porter or lager than expected.  Taste is balanced chocolate and coffee but fades fast.  No lingering flavor.  Not very complex.  Not bad but expected better."

"On draft in a  10oz snifter at Mainely Brews. Pours a dark black opaque with very minor head of an off white yellowish color, very good lacing ten minutes after the pour. Smells of mainly chocolate (dark chocolate) especially, with hints of coffee and vanilla sugar. Tastes as wonderful as it smells, you instantly notice the chocolate on first mouthful, and as it sits the coffee comes out as well as the vanilla in the after taste. The mouth feel is thin and light for a stout, with moderate carbonation if any, perfect compliment to the taste in my opinion. Overall it is an exceptional stout and one that I'll definitely be  seeking out again!"

"Poured from a 22oz bottle into my snifter (and shared bottle with the wife). I have a sweet spot for the appearance of stouts, and this was not a disappointment. Deep black (jet), with cocoa lacing and very few bubbles. Strong chocolate aromas up front, a bit of plum and roasted malt in there as well. Definite Kahlua note on the front of the taste (good thing). Nice coffee presence, balanced bitterness, nothing too overpowering. Bit of a fakey taste to the chocolate notes (but again nothing overpowering, and maybe my imagination). Smooth and full-bodied in the mouth, lingered nicely on the palate. Overall a very delicious brew. Wife's review: ""Oooohhh I like this!"". Probably the best we are going to get out of her!"

"O: The chocolate and coffee aspect of the beer come through nicely. It does have some great mocha flavors. The body could use a little more richness, and the hops distract a bit. Columbus might not be the best hop for the job here; at least not as it is being utilized. A more neutral bitterness with less flavor would help. Still a very good dessert beer. One would not guess that it is 10% abv."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So this is delicious. To begin with, this beer is not named appropriately. There is minimal coffee taste in this beer, which isn't such a bad thing but not what you would expect. I saw a previous review and agreed that it should be called double chocolate milk stout. It is very hard to drink and very sugary. This is a special occasion beer, it is fantastically tasty but if you get a bomber, be sure to share it with a friend... for calories sake."

"Overall- Very nice dessert-style stout. No coffee to be found, this should be called ""double chocolate milkshake stout"". Definitely worth buying again and saving for a special occasion. Not the most drinkable, but it tastes great!"

"Pitch black pour with a brown one-finger head. Really great chocolate and marshmallow aroma. Initial taste has a really strong dark chocolate and cocoa flavor that is big and bold. Full body that drinks relatively easy. Coffee flavor is very subdued and there’s just a slight bitterness around mid taste. Finishes sweet with a really nice lingering chocolate flavor…almost list a good chocolate ice cream."

"Delicious after dinner beer that may fall just short of Creme Brulee but still worth the $10 bomber."
""
""
"Pours a nice thick black with a decent king size head due to serving it a bit warmer than recommended. Has a slightly initial metallic smell along with sweetness and bitter coffee. Contrary to many other reviews, this really smells like coffee and tastes more like coffee to me than chocolate. A mild bitterness at the finish and a slightly oily mouthfeel. There is a definite difference between this and choklat to me. Alcohol seems well masked. Surprisingly, not too sweet."

"Pours black with no head. Nose is coffee and sweet dark chocolate. Taste is malty with caramel and with roast. Smooth soft malt with an underlying expanse of caramel. Creamy choccolate lays down on the tongue. Roast takes up the background in a delightful way. Finishes a touch bitter. Perfect! Not too bitter and it has southern tiers signature malt sweetness that is like a wonderful cookie inside the beer. Only a bit of warmth from alcohol."

"Overall: One of my favorite beers from Southern Tier and favorite stouts in general. Three of my favorite things all in one; coffee, chocolate and stouts! Whats not to love! I am glad I stocked up on this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is good. Really frickin' good. Not quite up there with Rogue's Double Chocolate Stout, but it does well to scratch that same itch. Fair balance, though leans toward the sweeter side. Don't know that I'd trade for it again, but would certainly buy it if it ever gets California distribution."
""
"Thick and rich and chocolate! Ah, the wonderful combination of coffee and chocolate in beer. Mana in a bottle. The sales person warned me to not try to drink this in one sitting as he'd had a hard time finishing it due to the overwhelming amount of flavor and alcohol. I love a good challenge almost as much as I like a good beer. This is a very, very good beer. I will make sure to buy me some more of this one. Neither flavor overpowers the other and the alcohol content is not overwhelming, until you go to stand up. I look forward to sharing this with friends."
""
""
""
"O - I find that Southern Tier over carbonates their stouts. It tastes smoother as it's allowed to aspirate an hour or so and open up."
""
""
""

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall - I'm really enjoying this. Yes, this is one of the sweeter impy stouts I've had, but it is complimentary with the strength and depth of all of the other flavors mentioned above. If you like a sweeter stout filled with chocolate and coffee, then this is a must. I personally find that this particular stout is best enjoyed just below 50 degrees, as the alcohol will begin to assert if it gets much warmer."
"O: Well I just checked my hemoglobin A1c and have confirmed that this beer has in fact given me diabetes. But I think it was worth it. I dont think there is a brewer out there that does as good a job achieving the chocolate/mocha characters as Southern Tier does in their stouts. No doubt one dimensional, and at times a bit cloying, but a great example of chocolate/coffee/mocha accentuation in a beer."
""
""
"Dark but not midnight dark. Strong scent of chocolate with a slight hint of coffee. Taste is pretty much the same. I'd like a bit less chocolate and a bit more coffee. This is a real dessert beer. I recognize the quality for those who like this type of beer, but this is a bit too dessert-like and not enough beer-like for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Excellence at it's best. Southern Tier is a world class brewery, and this hit it dead on with their Blackwater Series. Just absolute excellence. I can't say enough good things about it."
""
""
"O: Southern Tier has a sweet tooth, no doubt about it. I could have used a bit more roasts/coffee, but as it stands, this is one hell of a stout; I mean, when a beer can stand on its own as dessert, you know you have something special. And that’s not just because it’s sweet – all in all, this is one enchanting stout. Nothing like it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured half a 22oz bottle into a snifer glass. Real dark/ black brown color brew that forms little to no head even with an aggressive pour and just a ring around the edge plus minimal lacing. Um, yeah smells of chocolate. Tastes of chocolate. Is chocolate. Not getting much of the coffee but not big on coffee so I'm loving the chocolate aromas and taste. Smooth, decadent, rich, and sweet; just how I prefer my stouts. Highly recommend this one if you also enjoy bold, big, subtle stouts!"
"I poured the beer into a pint glass. I noted coffee with cream colored foam, which faded over time. I could smell chocolate, but no coffee. First taste I noted more chocolate than anything. As I drank the beer, I picked up the coffee taste, the malt, the hops. The coffee taste was a little weaker than I would have liked for a coffee and chocolate beer. I didn't notice any alcohol burn, and only when I finished the bottle and felt a buzz did I look at the label to find the %ABV. I was surprised to see 10%. Overall, a very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I think this is my first beer from Southern Tier and I can say it wont be my last, I'm a fan of stouts and this one does not disappoint, well done lads."
""
"Pitch black in color as it is poured into a snifter glass with a quick dissolving head. Sniffing the beer reveals the smell of a chocolate tootsie roll pop with a feint hint of dark roast coffee. The taste is similar to the chocolate pop as well with a good balance of malts between the coffee and chocolate with some bitterness. It is similar to the Chocolate Imperial Stout they make with the addition of Coffee. Pretty good as a after dinner beer."
""
"This is a nice stout. Southern Tier has always made rich and flavorful stouts, and this is no exception. It's ultimately Choklat with coffee. It's similar to Choklat in the same way Warlock is similar to Pumking. I'm sure someone will get that analogy. It's ultimately enjoyable stuff."
"This is a fantastic dessert beer. It's sweet, but not overly so; and it's all about the chocolate (and, secondarily, the coffee). Get it!"
"O- A great beer for what it is... A chocolate/coffee bomb."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm always a bit torn on big stouts of this sort and anyone who is familiar with my preferences will tell you that I am more than a bit of a purist when it comes to stouts. That being said, I can honestly say that this beer impresses me. It's not a traditional imperial stout, it's not subtle, and it really is not nearly as complex as some would have you believe, but that's fine. The aromas and flavors integrate well, the beer feels substantial in the mouth, and for something this strong, it goes down easily enough. All in all, I may not be quite as taken with this beer as many other reviewers, but I would still have no trouble recommending it to fans of big, bruising stouts."
""
""
""
"Obsidian black pour into a mini snifter, topped with a small cap of mocha head that fell to a ring and held there; tiny dots of lacing on the glass. The aroma was understandably big on roast, roasty coffee, roasty malts, hints of dark chocolate. Lots of robust flavor, dark coffee, dark chocolate, dark molasses...that's about it, and with a name like ""Mokah," what else do you really want? There was enough sweetness in this hearty brew to keep the intense roast at bay. Full body, smooth, velvety mouthfeel, despite the higher ABV. Yep, I'll go back for more of this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I don't know if I'm too immersed in BA stouts or what, but lately I have been a bit out of touch with some regular imperials. Overall, I think it is an excellent beer, but tonight, the chocolate felt just a tad overpowering. I'll undoubtedly revisit this beer to see how my preferences change over time. Still I great stout from a great brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good dessert stout. Too sweet to do much else with, but at least it's drinkable unlike creme brulee."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer pours opaque black with little to no espresso froth colored foam. Mild to little carbonation. Smell is pronounced milk chocolate with some background notes of cacao/espresso. Does not smell like beer. Flavor is sweet, chocolate frothy malted milkshake at first with an intense bitter twang to finish. Smooth, not overall thick, yet clings to the cheeks like milk. Really delicious overall, ultimate nightcap."
"Overall: This beer has the best of both worlds in that it opens with strong sweet notes of milk chocolate and vanilla, but finishes with bitter notes of coffee. It's a remarkable feat for this sweet style of beer. Extremely pleasant and drinkable."

"Overall: This beer has the best of both worlds in that it opens with strong sweet notes of milk chocolate and vanilla, but finishes with bitter notes of dark chocolate. The hops leave a slight tingle on the tongue; a remarkable feat for this sweet style of beer. Oh, and 10% ABV? After drinking this bottle for an hour with the beer approaching room temperate there is not a single hint of booze noticeable on the nose of tongue. Extremely pleasant and drinkable."

"Pours like a heavy milk stout. Smells like the Choklat with coffee flavor added. Smells good, but again it has the fake flavoring which makes it kind of nasty. There is no need to use real coffee beans and then add flavoring as well. Get a grip."

"This is a remarkable beer, just amazing complexity with a mélange of balanced coffee and chocolate character. (I found the chocolate was more dominant flavor wise, but the coffee contributed a lot to the feel). It would be interesting to play around with the proportions for curiosity sake, but I think ST has pretty well nailed it here. Wouldn’t change anything with this, it’s a magical combination and works very nicely. 4.5"

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 5/26/2011. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass with some alcohol legs. Aromas of huge milk chocolate, cocoa, fudge, toffee, cream, vanilla, roasted malt, caramel, light coffee, toast, and roasted earthiness. Fantastic complexity and balance of chocolate, dark/roasted malt, and light coffee notes; with great strength. Taste of big milk chocolate, cocoa, fudge, toffee, caramel, toast, vanilla, cream, coffee, roasted malt, and roasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, fudge, caramel, toast, toffee, vanilla, cream, coffee, and roasted malt on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of chocolate and dark/roasted malt flavors with moderate coffee presence; with big robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic chocolate/coffee imperial stout! Even with the significant age of it. All around awesome complexity, balance, and robustness of chocolate, dark/roasted malt, and light coffee flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
"Overall - Really nice, huge chocolate presence but is definitely more of a dessert beer or a beer best served with a couple of friends. Definitely something to sip over an evening by the fire."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is fairly sweet and pairs really nicely with dessert - in my case leftover 1st birthday cake from my daughter's birthday party over the weekend (vanilla cake with vanilla frosting). The alcohol is pretty well hidden but due to the sweetness, this is a sipping beer. Quite enjoyable."

"""This beer reeks of chocolaty goodness, not much coffee in the aroma, hopefully more in the flavor...nope! this beer is ALL CHOCOLATE!! Even more so than ""Young's double chocolate stout! Too much chocolate in my opinion, cant even really taste the roasted malts or any coffee either...."
""
""
""
""
"This really wowed me. It's up there with Victory at Sea and Peche Mortel with beers that really show off coffee well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Interesting, very sweet aroma but much milder body. Not sure if age has mellowed the sweetness a bit. Lots and lots of bittersweet coffee, chocolate and burnt malt. Heavy body to boot. I think this might be better fresher, it's a bit muddled at this point. Still good, just not what I expect from a big Southern Tier stout."

"O - This is as good of a beer as I've ever had. Far more chocolate flavor than Southern Tier's Choklat, super smooth, full bodied, strong, flavorful, and amazing. This is one of those beers I buy every time I see it on the shelf and I know this will be better than anything else I might buy."
""
"It's pretty stellar, just some minor nits keep it from running the table. Clearly a sipper, it makes for a good dessert beer, or just a good dessert all by itself. Very strong, but never over the top. Really, a great night cap."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"o/D- A big big beer with big flavors to match. A desert beer I would fathom, almost replaces the call for a irish coffee. Fits right into the Southern Tier style. Pretty filling, and lots of abv to manage...go slow."
""
""
""
""
""
"perhaps not the best night cap, now I have one eye wide open from the coffee and the others shut due to booze, I suppose there's worse things in life"
""

"Overall: at the end of the day it's real chocolate flavour, not overwhelming, too rich, or sweet; would like more coffee influence to really get that feeling of a mocha, it's too subtle"

"Big chocolate nose, very sweet bordering on syrupy. Malt in the background. Very soft on the palate to drink, but also heavy sweet. Too much syrup happening. Past the sweetness is some charcoal and a hint of bitterness. Lots of chocolate and coffee. However, overall just too sweet and syrupy to enjoy."

"D- this is an example of the whole not being equal to the sum of its parts.. The outstanding, nearly perfect Choklat just doesn't play well with the awesome kick ass existential entity that is Jah-va. (Get it.. Jah. Idk it's irie. Alcohol isn't Ital anyway). This is a great beer, but leaves something to be desired- specifically and glass of Choklat followed by a glass of Jahva. Not the two combined. Still, it puts on that bilateral buzz, coffee and booze, and I bet it would kill something like a blue Stilton."

"This beer pours dark and has a small head with low retention. It smells sweet and chocolately with a tad of booze. It tastes like roasted malts and then sweet and chocolate followed by the coffee and then lastly a bite of the booze. It has a big body and low carbonation. Great dessert beer. I love this and highly recommend."

"p.s. I detected a flavor close to vanilla. I didn't want to mention it at first since it wasn't listed in the ingredients but i thought it was there and I see now some other people picked the flavor out as well so there you have it. A secret ingredient? A known mellowing/smoothing agent? Could be. Stranger things have happened in the beer world!"

"Final Grade: 4.49, a very high A grade. At 11.2%, Southern Tier's Mokah is actually the heftiest beer I've ever bothered reviewing. Make no mistake - the taste is just as big and impressive as the abv suggests, but the supremely well-balanced flavours prevent it from becoming a sticky-sweet boozy mess (which is usually my main concern with these big stouts, and why I am rarely willing to shell out the bucks for them). A sinfully tasty 'extreme' beer that is well worth a try, and an ideal tipple for Christmas evening. Highly recommended."

"O: It's almost like I'm drinking chocolate milk with a ton of alcohol in it, Fucking lovely!!"
""
""
"nUgZ, I owe you mang!"
"O: Fantastic brew. Can't think of anything that comes close, maybe MAYBE, Green Flash Double Stout is in the same ball park sitting up in the nose bleeds. Definite must try for stout lovers. Love this beer, will drink again."
""
""
""
"Overall, definitely an enjoyable beer that should be tried at least once. Chocolate on the forefront and a coffee/espresso finish leave it spot on for what its advertised as."

"Great experience for the first time. Like my first girl, something I will remember. When I ordered this, it came to me in a goblet style glass. I could tell before I tasted it that it would be everything I expected. I could smell the rich coffee chocolate aroma."
""
"Overall, as i stated above, another quality beer from Southern Tier. I think i need to visit the brewery"
"Medium to full body, slightly syrupy, medium carbonation really sticky on the lips."
""
""
"This is a nice Imperial Stout. Very full flavored, worth a try. It could have a bit less alcohol presence and a bit more hop and coffee presence.. Then it would be world class!"
""
""
"O - Dare I say one of my favourite offerings from Southern Tier. Flavour profile is tasty but not overwhelming. I had no problem taking down this bomber alone. A worthy ale and definitely worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty much what you would expect. Dessert in a bottle. Some is very nice but not a beer you can go through a lot of."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A sweet and fantastic tasting imperial stout with chocolate, caramel and coffee flavours. My only complaints are that this beer could have better head retention and more carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: A definite dessert beer. I had this with dessert (Buttermilk Pie) but afterwards, I felt this beer WAS the desert. It stands all on its own. Combining it with more dessert is almost too much. But it is an amazing beer in aroma, taste, and mouthfeel. Definitely a one and done beer though. 1 large snifter was enough, and more and I would be hurting later. The beer is a slow sipping savoring beer, much like a big dessert being picked at and savored towards the end of a nice meal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the ST stout I've been looking for since trying Choklat and Creme Brulee. The suggestion of balance, though it might be a facade, is still welcome. Toning down that sweet ST style into something more readily drinkable is a HUGE plus to me. Good stuff."
""

"Nearly jet black, cap of tan head, little lace at the edge of the glass. Smell is full of chocolate, milk and bittersweet, vanilla, coffee beans and a moderate amount of roasty malt are present with bits of alcohol, but really quite chocolate heavy. Taste is similar to the nose lots of chocolate, vanilla and black coffee, sweet milky chocolate notes, fairly bitter most likely the work of the coffee, some alcohol heat but not boozy, more chocolate and coffee beans in the finish and leaves flavours of vanilla in the aftertaste. Lightly carbonated and creamy big and full bodied. Delicious stuff here, sweet and loaded with a ton of flavour, really good stuff."
""
""
""
"Mokah pours a black color with very little head. there was a very sweet aroma, lots of chocolate. There is a very sweet chocolate flavor, lots of coffee flavors too; mokah flavors. Rather sweet, and easy and almost dangerous to drink. Overall a very different and interesting beer, worth a shot."
""
"Anyway, it's well crafted and an interesting experiment, but not balanced very well for my tastes. I can tell that the base stout is good, but I don't like the overwhelming chocolate flavor. I think it tastes artificial and needs to be balanced out by something else. This is something of a general problem I have had with Southern Tier beers. They have a fantastic smell or at least a very intriguing one, but they also have an overwhelming sweetness that is too much."
""
""
"First poured almost straight white, while the second from the bomber had a khaki color to it. Mixed head formation and retention, but not necessarily bad in either. Immediate aroma of mocha. Strong and pleasant. First taste was just amazing. Strong mokah taste. A creamy coffee, really reminds me of a mocha frappiccino, but one big difference. A lot of booze taste. Not necessarily heavy for the alcohol content, but I have had smoother. But, then again, the flavor/aroma/mouthfeel would not be the same with less malt. The mouthfeel was amazing. A nice creamy and silkiness. Definitely a must try, and I plan on cellaring some to see how they turn out over time."
""
"Black with a khaki head. Dense retention and a whole lotta lacing. Nose has a ton of cocoa powder, milk chocolate and sweet dark malts. Not much in the way of roast or coffee character. More cocoa powder, bakers chocolate and slight heavily creamed coffee. Light roast, sweet and a touch of alcohol which is great for the actual ABV. Perfectly smooth carbonation, medium body. An excellent coffee/chocolate stout, different than Peche let's say, but hits it's mark in a sweeter gentler way."
"O - Another tasty stout from Southern Tier. I prefer Chockat a bit more than this, but this would be perfect for people who enjoy coffee ice cream."
""
""
""
""
"Recommended."

"Poured into a 20 oz Duvel glass, bottled 4/12/12. Pours almost pitch black with a 3 inch tan heads, that leaves gobs of lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell is so powerful, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and some alcohol. Taste is all of that, balanced very well, a perfect combination of the nose, but alcohol is hidden well for the ABV. Body is medium large, more carbonation than normal out of a stout this size, not overly dry, and has a ton of flavor, but is still very approachable. This is very nice."

"11/24/2012 EDIT: I should have checked this originally, but the bottle I reviewed was actually from 2011. I had a fresh bottle and asked myself why it wasn't nearly as good; dug out the old bottle and found out why."

"D: damn, another really solid stout from southern tier. these things are more like dessert than beer. everything works together, even if i do find it more on the sweet chocolate side than the bitter coffee side. wouldnt hate to see a tad more coffee in this brew to really balance things out."
""
""
""
""
"This is a dangerous beer in a way because it’s so sweet and tasty that you just keep drinking it without regard or respect of the 11.2% ABV, which will hit you later on. No matter, as this beer was so great and so tasty overall that the headache will be worth in the morning. A very high recommendation for any stout lover out there and a very high rating for me as I love coffee, chocolate and stouts; another gem from Southern Tier that pushes the limits of the craft brew movement."
"I don't like it and I will never ever buy it again for myself; Founder's Breakfast Stout is just about my limit in the chocolate-and-coffee-flavored beer department. But hoo boy, if you want a deeply chocolatey mocha beer, this one fills the bill, and it's very well crafted. If that's your thing, you'll like this one."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I really liked this. Reminded me a lot of it's brother (or sister) Choklat. A real treat as the weather turns. Pick this up or trade for it because it's worth it."
""
"Overall: Good stuff, this. It's big and sweet, so have a friend handy. Proudly follows in the footsteps of Southern Tier's previous jacked up stouts in their Blackwater series."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was a good beer – but nothing I could have more than one of. It was almost hard to finish this beer due to it being so heavy and rich."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very well done imperial chocolate/coffee stout. The aroma (and taste, to a lesser degree) are a bit one-note, but when that note is this fantastic, hearing it over and over is not as tiring as one might think. Be wary while drinking this, as it will disappear far too quickly, and the drinker may wonder where their beer went, or where they, themselves went. Because of this, sharing is highly encouraged; with a beer this good, your friends will owe you something very special indeed. It is a foolproof win-win for you, the purchaser. Southern Tier has yet to disappoint this reviewer, and I eagerly await my next beer from them (Unearthly or Javah, I’m thinking). 16.5/20"
""
""
""
"Overall: I would love to have this available in Utah. I am very happy to have tried it and would recommend to any chocolate lover. Very tasty!"
""
""
"Great job on this one!"
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: This is the first Southern Tier beer I've ever had or reviewed. It definitely leaves me wanting more and wanting to try their other offerings. Although it's not a beer that Joe 6-pack would go for, I think anyone can enjoy this one if they know what to expect going into it. It delivers on every level."

"O - Really solid beer that has a unique flavor."
""
"O - Highly enjoyable! Would love to get some more of this for the cooler months."
"Overall a great beer thats always been a favorite of mine. An aggressive approach on a blend of strong stouts. Visit the brewery."
"Medium bodied with a very nice balance of sweet chocolate and robust roasted coffee.  All dark and milk chocolate sweetness up front with a touch of the tootsie roll from the nose.  This is countered by roasted coffee bitterness that lingers into a dry finish where somehow the sweet chocolate flavors reappear.  The abv is invisible making it dangerously drinkable.  Great balance of sweetness and roasted bitterness with the dark chocolate notes complimenting the coffee flavor.  Similarly to the aroma, the chocolate is most prominent.  It doesn't taste like a mocha but has lots of chocolate and coffee flavor."
""

"D - Very drinkable. The balance of chocolate and coffee is spot on and the mouthfeel is awesome. A really wonderful beer."
""
"Terrific smelling beer. I wish that translated better on the tongue. If you're on the fence about this one, I'd say give it a go though."
"Overall – This is a strong and delicious beer. Huge sweet and darker chocolate flavors mixed with a wonderful body and aroma. Fantastic!!"
""
"Pours deep, dark brown with a modest mocha head. Smells of chocolate and coffee with a strong alcohol component. This beer is big on flavor, with rich dark chocolate and gourmet coffee. The body is smooth and substantive, an excellent complement to the rich taste. The high ABV is respectably mellowed while the beer is still at its coldest (though still hardly invisible). As it warms, the alcohol becomes more strident--the only real flaw I can point out. Normally, I tend to enjoy dark beers more as they warm, but that's not the case here, as the alcohol becomes something of a distraction. The luxurious flavor profile, along with an eagerness to ""beat the heat", make this imperial stout way too easy to imbibe without conscience. Another winning stout from Southern Tier."
""
""
""

"O: southern tier always comes correct with these theme beers and this one is no exception. Glad I got to try this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Review from 10/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a deep, black red amber with a light head and lacing. Aroma of dark malts and chocolate. Flavor is similar, sweet and dark malts, chocolate, light caramel and coffee. A nice blend."
"O: For an Imperial Chocolate Stout this is spot on, but I prefer a more dynamic bill. This is straight forward and ridiculously smooth. This would be great in a bowl of cereal for extra flavor."

"O: Simply dessert in a glass. Wonderful."
""
""
"Overall an excellent chocolate coffee beer, great smell and taste with an amazingly thick body"
""
""
"I think a true beer geek might scoff at my praise, here, that this is the Disney Land of big beers, the stuff of childhood fantasy. True, the chocolate and sweetness might please a seven-year-old. But I would say the hop bitterness in the finish is serious enough to establish this beer as a serious adult pleasure."
""
""
""
""
"Outstanding! Mokah rivals Creme Brulee as my favorite of the Blackwater series. Fresh on tap I can really catch the near perfect mixture of Jahva and Choklat. Delicious and worth a try. It also ages well so don't shy away from any old bottles you may run across. "
""
"Unreal beer. Literally, hard to believe they nailed this down. Decadent and desserty. Loads of flavor. Nothing off about it. Ballsy and spot on. Among the killers of the Southern Tier lineup."

"O- This is another good stout from Southern Tier. I wasnt fond of the strange fruitiness that blended in with the other flavors. Other then that, great stout."
""
""
"O: a bit much on the sweet side for what I was expecting, and I also thought that maybe the flavors were too bold - meaning, other than sweet coffee and chocolate, I didn't much pick up on anything else. I loved Southern Tier's Pumking because it has such a rich pumpkin and holiday spice flavor, but I was rooting for more complexity here. I think I liked their Jahva better; have yet to try their Choklat"
""

"Overall, it makes a nice dessert beer, but can be cloying on its own."

"Split a bomber with a couple friends. Can't say I'm surprised that like ST's other big, dark beers, this is on the sweet and syrupy side. It's not as a over-the-edge as the Creme Brulee, but I might enjoy this more on a scoop of vanilla ice cream than solo. Why? Well the beer is dominated by an almost cloying cocoa, with very minimal mocha notes. I wouldn't have guessed it's a coffee beer really (OK, it's a blend of Jahva and Choklat), many stout get more java flavor from their roasted malts. That said, it's makes for a tasty dessert beer with more balanced malts (against the chocolate, not the hops) than the Choklat. For my money, I'd just get the Jahva."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"High speed, heavy weight train delivering mocha to my mouth. Served at a good temperature with a nice foamy, tan head that settled after a bit and lots of lace. Color is an opaque black brown. Aroma is cocoa foremost, then malt, roast, hint coffee. Flavor's the same but with sweetness playing heavy role along side the rich cocoa flavor and roasty, caramel, slight acid qualities. Body is good but with slight oddities. Finish is good for a solo serving; kind of rich for more than that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours pitch black with little to no head. Smells of chocolate and coffee, a beautiful mocha (no surprise) aroma that makes this seem like it would go great with some vanilla ice cream. Taste is a perfect combination of the two, and somehow the mixture of Jahva and Choklat manages to outperform both. Slightly syrupy on the mouthfeel like Hershey's syrup infused with earthy coffee, but not overly so. Sweet and good for dessert or a cold winter Friday night. Excellent."
""
""
""
"A decent beer overall (fresh or cellared), though not one I feel the urge to return to often. Or ever, actually. Just a bit too sweet."
"O: Really like this beer, more than the others I have had in the series, except choklat, because it is not over the top sweet."
""
""
"this beer pours a dark black with almost no head. Strong notes of chocolate and coffee in the nose. The taste follows with an additional astringency from the alcohol. There is a tasty chocolate aftertaste with a residual cocoa pebbles... It's a tasty beer that reminds me of chokolat, but is distinct at the same time. The price point and availability are excellent and it's definitely worth the money."

"A very sweet and chocolaty beer with a warming alcohol kick."

"Medium bodied with average carbonation. Has a sweet chocolate aftertaste, and the alcohol is barely detectable. A very nice beer, which I will buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dear Southern Tier: sometimes less is more. I've had a number of these big stouts, and I don't dig any of them. The ones I've had are all way overdone, with the same weird sweetness that tastes artificial. I wish they would let the characteristics of the other ingredients shine through more."
""
""
""
"Overall one if the best stouts I have ever had. Really full flavors that jump and ask you to have another sip. For all of the big hyped one day Release stouts. This beer stands shoulder to shoulder with them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was how perfectly it was a blend between Choklat and Jahva. It struck a beautiful balance, and embodied the full essence of both of those brews. The aroma was huge and inclusive, and set up nicely for the full flavoring throughout the taste. The feel was equally as powerful, making for an extremely well-rounded, and expertly crafted brew. We do, however, wish that there was a bigger head and a stronger look and slurp."

"O: Well executed for what it is: huge chocolatey stout with some supporting coffee. Not unlike drinking a cafe mocha. Sweet but not overly sweet. Southern Tier does these types of beers well."
"O- one of the better beers I've ever had. It is extremely similar to the Chokolat from ST, but a bit more coffee and dark bitter chocolate flavor, and not SO sweet. It's just perfect, thats all I can say. Every sip makes me want more and more and more. An absolute steal for $8.50 650ml. A stout/chocolate fans dream!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Incredibly well put together beer, this is the not the way stout should be but the way ""Mokah"" is. Flavor just screams drink me and you will not be disappointed by picking this up. Hope you all enjoy...Salud!"
""
""
""
""
""
"D: superb. Especially good on its own or with light foods so you can appreciate the chocolate!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: the flavor sort of gets me here. I love the chocolate, and the roastiness is nice, but the interplay with the vegetal hops doesn't work great. The coffee advertised in the bottle doesn't make much of an impression at all."
"O- I enjoyed it and was glad to drink it. I always take value into account when giving an O, and how good it was for how easy to get. Well, it is everywhere around me, so easy to get, but for 10 bucks, I would not buy this one again. So, I give it a 4, because it is enjoyable, and I think that what they were trying to do works, I just dont feel it is a repeat buy for 10 bucks"
"Overall, a nice stout from ST, I look forward to trying their other sweet stouts as well."
"Overall: This is another one of those beers I wish I'd split with someone. Its really tasty, but very sweet, and one sided with limited complexity. I enjoyed it, but its not a world class imperial stout."

"o- another home run for Southern Tier. One of my favorites. It's a step below a KBS ( but isn't everything else)."

""
""
""
""
"O - For me a nice brew, very heavy"
"Thick and smooth texture in the mouthfeel. Overall, this brew comes across with a very good blend of the coffee and chocolate. I normally rate most ST beers low due to the excessive sweetness, but this is one of the best I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured this from a bomber into a pint glass. It was black with very little head and lots of lacing. It had a very strong cocoa smell, which was very sweet and largely masked the roasted malts and coffee. This thick beer had a taste to match; think of Swiss Miss cocoa delivered via a stout vehicle. It was too much for me at the time I had it, but admittedly it was at the end of a 4 hr session, and I likely hit a wall. I generally love everything from Southern Tier, so I need to give this another shot on its own."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"DELICIOUS, TRY IT!"
""
""
"Definitely a dessert beer. Really should have shared this with someone else. Not overly sweet like Creme Brulee, but reminds me of coffee, chocolate, caramel ice cream. Would enjoy again if I get in on draft or can split a bomber with someone."
"O: think I may have gotten an older bottle but its still enjoyable. Gonna look for a fresh bottle soon. Or try and recreate this blend with the jahva and chocolate stouts from southern tier."
""
""
""
"* Thanks to brystmar for this one!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The alcohol becomes strong as the beer warms, but the thick, creamy feel caries it well. Southern Tier sure knows their desert stouts!"
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall a solid, well balanced beer that melds the flavors of Javah and Choklat. It does well to blend the coffee and chocolate flavors so that both have a chance to shine but neither overpower."
""
""
"Aside from the mouthfeel being too light in my opinion, this is a pretty damn good beer. I know ST gets the rap of having the diabetes in a bottle stouts, but they are proving to be pretty damn good. I've been pleasantly surprised by both Creme Brulee and now Mokah. So I'm quietly looking forward to having the other two."
""
""
""
"Overall, I think this beer is fantastic. I wish I grabbed more bottles because I could drink one anytime the temp drops below freezing."
""
"Delicious dessert beer and a really nice sipper. I am a sucker for chocolate and coffee stouts and I enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"MO- The high alcohol is only apparent way in the aftertaste. This one is a classic sipper. Probably the most chocolaty beer I've ever had. I can't wait to the try the others in this series."
""
""
"O: Drinking this puppy after dinner, and it's one hell of a dessert beer. I'm just starting to dive deeper into the stout scene, but this is already a favorite."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a nice strong stout that focuses on one dominant flavor and does a good job with delivering a deliciously chocolatey experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Hmm, a bit too much chocolate for my taste. It's getting better and more drinkable as it warms up. I have mixed feelings on this one. Definitely a mood beer... definitely warms you up. Resembles cold milk with Hershey's chocolate syrup in an uncanny way. As it warms the hops/bitterness come through nicely. I'll have to try this again sometime!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A beautiful dark and viscous looking beer with a nice head that leaves light lacing. The aroma is delicious as it has a sweet cocoa and hot chocolate smell, above light roasted notes. The body has some nice nuances in it with strong chocolate and coffee playing well against each other and a building roasted bitterness. Sadly, it finishes exceptionally acrid which kills the otherwise great tasting beer. Mouthfeel is dominated by the acrid burnt notes on the palate, but a lingering sweetness does play across the mouth momentarily. A thick, sweet beer that needs to get rid of the acrid notes to be stellar."
"Overall: A nice beer. Less coffee and more chocolate than I expected. After initial worry about bottling date & appearance, taste proves to be just fine, perhaps enhanced by those 6 months of unintentional “aging”. 4/5"

"Depth is the strength of this beer. It doesn't offer much range of flavor, its really all about chocolate and coffee and nothing else, but those flavors are captured so brilliantly I couldn't hope for anything else. The other thing that impresses me is the lack of bitterness. Imperial Chocolate Coffee Stouts tend to be rather bitter, sometimes to their detriment. Mokah is almost the opposite, if anything it may be a tad sweet. In any case, it is just the right beer for a cool Kansas City night next to the fire. Speaking of which...."

"Overall this is an ok beer. The sweetness isn't overwhelming but it does become a bit much over time. No real coffee flavor as the bottle says but plenty of the chocolate. This beer would benefit from a nice coffee flavor to balance out the sweetness."
"Great beer I wish I could drink on a regular basis."
"Overall this is a very sweet beer. very chocolaty as well. I would definitely recomend this to beer to any stout lover. this is probably one of my favorite stouts i have tried since i have been getting into them. but very thick and hard to finish."
"Overall-What I haven't mentioned is the alcohol, this suckers 11.2% and i sucked down the first 12 ounces, stood up, and stumbled a bit. Nothing out of the ordinary, but really nailed what they were going for. Glad I have another bottle. Just wish there were some more carbonation in the beer, or just my bottle."
"Pours almost black....I found it more opaque than some other reviewers. One and a half finger tan head, nice lace. The smell is fantastic! Dark, sweet malt....followed immediately by Hershey's choc syrup, coffee is the afterscent. Pretty simple....sweet, malty, roasty, chocolatey, coffee goodness! Mouthfeel is silky and viscous. Picking up on the alcohol now s I'm sipping more and have had about 5-6 ozs. Very good beer."
"Pours pretty dark although not completely black. I poured this one pretty aggressively and got a massive three finger tan head. The head dissipated to a thin ring of lace that stuck around. The aroma is magnificent. At the forefront I get tons of semi-sweet chocolate followed by coffee. The taste mirrors the smell. A nice blend of chocolate and coffee, but the chocolate comes through more. Not as sweet as I anticipated. I was expecting a cloyingly sweet beer but am pleasantly surprised in how easy it is to drink this. Mouthfeel is good, but I was expecting a thicker body. Carbonation is perfect for the style. Overall, very delicious double. I cannot detect the 11.2% abv which is surprising. This is clearly a dessert beer, but not nearly as heavy as one might expect. Not overly complex as the only flavors are chocolate and coffee, but a decadent brew nonetheless."
"Overall, damn near perfect."
"Pretty good brew. Very complex. Like no other beer I have ever tried. Better as it warms."
"O- Sweet and decadent dessert type beer. ABV sneaks up on you."
"Overall: Very drinkable. One of the best coffee beers I've had. Honestly can hardly tell you're drinking a beer and not an iced mocha. Well done."
"O- this imperial stout was delicious it was not as bitter as others much more smooth"
"O - Having had both the Jahva and Choklat, this a perfect blend between the two. Not too indulgent like the Choklat, with a nice amount of coffee and bitterness from the Jahva. I'll get this again."
"This beer is not for the faint hearted. It's delicious, but it took me 40 minutes to drink a schooner. Not something to session or drink before or during a meal. But, oh, what a nightcap."
"Full body, mild carbonation, soft and smooth on the tongue. Big time flavor here, although it tends to be a little one note. If you like hot chocolate, this is it."
"O: The chocolate seems a bit artificial and I'm not a big fan of the bitter finish."
"O- A really unique and enjoyable dessert beer. I would enjoy one of these every so often."
"O: too much candy and too little coffee. The cough syrup at the end was unpleasant."
"Goes down a little too easy at 11.2% ABV. Overall a good dessert beer, a little too sweet for my tastes, but it has it's place and time. Second go with this one and it has grown a little on me since the first time."
"O - This is really fantastic. I don't know why I passed on it in previous years."
"Taste is rich sweet chocolate blended with espresso. A really good balance here between the bitterness of the coffee and the sweetness of the chocolate; neither dominates. The one thing I'm kind of not getting is any malt or hops... but this is a unique dessert-type beer, a great blend of Jahva and Choklat. Very nice."
"O - An easy overbearing on the senses at first. If you really want a flavorful beer, look no further. It takes some time to get through this due to the unrelenting density in all qualities. A wonderful autumn evening beer around the fireplace."
"Plenty of coffee and sweet chocolate in the aroma and in the flavor. The sweetness in the aroma is fine but there's a little too much in the taste. Started fine, but soon became cloying. A more recent tasting in June 2012 found the sweet level acceptable. The 'extra' sweetness did make for a notably nice coffee finish without much of the bitterness."
"edit: interesting that after writing this, the previous reviewer also noted Tootsie Roll."
"Definitely an adventure in craft beer. A must try for any chocolate beer lovers...unless you can't stand TOOTSIE ROLLS"
"Pours an oily black color with very thin head mostly around the edge. Smell is very sweet, but like freshly poured chocolate. Goes down smooth and the a hit of bitterness that you'd expect from an imperial. Tastes exactly like smell which is quite rare. Except for the head, the brew has nailed the style."
"O: Better than some of the other Black Waters IIRC, but still just a sweet, savage, decadent treat to be savored only rarely. Very intense. I can say this for the beer: as usual, the name matches the profile quite precisely."
"O - Got ambitious and tried a bomber of this on my own tonight. Wish this came in 12oz bottles as 22oz of this is a lot for any man to handle on his own. It is a sipper for sure, but like the rest of the big ST stouts, very well done."
"Overall: I love this beer. Southern Tier are master beer alchemists!"
"O: This is exactly what it sounds like. Its called an imperial stout, and tastes spot on like a mocha coffee. I would not want to bring this all the time, but its a nice changeup."
"Overall: well, I love southern tier but this one is too sweet and medicinal for me."
"I think this is a great beer, which doesn't come as too big a surprise given my love of chocolate and coffee beers. This is a great blend of both and I personally think it takes the extreme edge off of the Jahva and Choklat."
"O – A world class beer. Put an few years on this and it’ll be pure gold."
"I would also suggest pouring this into a nice snifter or a chalice as to get all the flavors of this beer."
"Definitely lives up to the Mokah name, a little too sweet and chocolaty for me."
"Scrumptious beer. Creamy and chocolatey all the way through each and every sip. Reminded me of Godiva chocolate liqueur. The alcohol is almost undetectable despite its high percentage. Its so creamy that its almost remeniscent of chocolate milk when cold. Coffee flavor pushes its way through, but can't stand up to the creamy milk chocolate flavors. Definitely there though all the way through in a balancing way. Tastes like a mocha basically. Creamy mouthfeel is nearly dead on, finishing slightly drier, but still creamy and lightly bitter. Sweet, no doubt about it so if you don't typically like chocolatey beers, this one may not be for you. I think its an almost perfect dessert beer, and I definitely reccommend this. I am impressed."
"One could call this a true `dessert beer'. I could probably drink it often, as it is extremely tasty without being too rich and syrupy. If you've never had Southern Tier's `dessert' stouts, I'd suggest you get all three: Choklat, Jah-va, and Mokah. I think this one was my favorite."
"A very well made brew, but go into it knowing that it's a dessert beer and you may want to split the bomber with a friend."
"Overall, an outstanding brew. Southern Tier hits you over the head with the mocha tones, which can be viewed as a strength or a weaknes. Definitely recommended, especially if somebody else is driving."
"Overall/Drinkability-Another winner from the Blackwater series by Southern Tier; awesome beer for dessert after a meal or as a late night treat."
"O- While the bold flavors and sweetness may run it thin in quantity, it is highly enjoyable. I could see making this into an ice cream float...in the very near future. A very well crafted beer."
"O: I would love to try this with some age on it."
"O= decent beer, good for a try if you like their Choklat. Overall though, for me, it gets nearly nauseating after less than half a pint. Too sweet and syrupy, the nose become perfumy, and there's an unfitting bitterness that just doesn't match. To me it's more like a ruined Choklat."
"Overall: ST Mokah is a true sipper at 11%. The price tag ($8.50) might be steep for a bomber- but don't be scared. Awesome flavors going on here. Do yourself a favor and buy it."
"This is another flavorful beer from the blackwater series. It is quite tasty, but just like all the others it is a bit over the top. I must say though, I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more if it had more coffee in the aroma."
"O: Eh...take it or leave it. I say leave it. There are a lot better Southern Tier beers out there."
"overall, a great balance of the two flavors. just the feel is a bit off."
"Taste is heavily on the sweet side, the chocolate really comes through but the roasted malt helps balance things more than some other Southern Tier offerings, slight burnt bitterness in the aftertaste which might be from coffee but it could also be from the roasted malt so the coffee presence is still very subtle."
"Really a rather good stout. I wish the coffee and chocolate had more balance, but that doesn't mean it wasn't delicious. I really enjoyed this one."
"Overall: It is tempting to make the taste on this beer a 5.0, but knowing I have not had that many I went with a 4.5, but will revisit this after tasting more stouts. This beer has changed my mind about stouts in general due to its rich flavor. After sampling several stouts I concluded this to be one of my favorite. Definitely a dessert beer."
"This beer is a very good dessert - in itself, and if you like chocolate you're in for a treat."
"So while the flavors that are present rank a Spinal-Tapping eleven, the beer as a whole suffers from a lack of balance. Still, I'm not complaining (much); I could drink this all night, but for the fear of wondering tomorrow morning why I'm on the kitchen floor."
"O: Overall this is a very great beer! I'm very pleased with my first Southern Tier offering! I wish I had another one to age to see what type of changes it would undergo over time. Worth trying if you have the chance!"
"Overall: Two flavors dominate but those two flavors are delicious. It lacks the complexity of other imperial stouts but it definitely is a unique take on the style."
"Well done and would buy again."
"Overall - I thought this was a fantastic brew, unlike just about any other imperial stout I had. Great job by Southern Tier."
"O: A delicious drink that I would take over a white russian any day... the problem is, if you want a beer and not a white russian, you're out of luck. It tastes like candy, and I love it, but it is not what your typical beer drinker would see as beer. If it's what you're in the mood for, it's perfect... but if you just want a coffee stout, stay away - this is far more than you're bargaining for."
"O- A really tasty stout but very boozy."
"Overall: Another great stout from Southern Tier's Blackwater series. Complex and tasty."
"O - I really enjoyed this one. I have had Javah before (which I really enjoyed) and have a bottle of Choklat in the cellar. This makes me a little concerned that 100% Choklat will be too sweet, but paired with the roasted coffee, the combination of bitter and sweet was well done."
"O: The flavors in this are very dark and bold, and were definitely an assault to my senses. A good balance of coffee and chocolate, but a bit hard to drink overall."
"What gets me is the beer's relative thinness. It's about as thick and creamy as a regular dry stout. This makes it dangerously easy to drink (my pint was consumed at about normal speed), and also causes it to the lack the sumptuousness you'd want out of a giant dessert beer. It's still really nicely done, only I don't think it's *quite* what they were going for."
"O – Really like this brew. It has a solid tastes and good balance. A winner for sure."
"O - I love this beer and I love the entire Black Water series. It is delicious and I always want more."
"This is a dessert in a bottle, if ever there was one. If that’s what you’re in the mood for, this might be your best option. I bet it has a bajillion calories."
"What a stellar stout. Jet black, impervious to the penetration of any light source, this is as thick and heavy on the tongue as it is in the snifter. Your first impression by sight is quickly trumped by the overwhelming assault on your sense of smell, and your palate. This is one SMOOTH beer. I have to say, this is for sharing. At 11%, it's strong enough in both ABV and taste to warrant a second person being involved. Not so sure I could crush one of these on my own, and enjoy it as much at the end as in the beginning. If you're into stouts, this is a must try."
"Overall: I had this in the cellar for a year, and it was really smooth. This is one of the better coffee stouts I've had. Really nice."
"peas"
"I have been looking forward to trying Southern Tier for quite a while, and had my first experience tonight with there Mokah offering. Everything everyone else said is true, dark appearance, very chocolaty upfront, and I like the sweet, coffee aftertaste as well. Up to this point I have been much more of a fan of wheat beers or lagers than stouts, but this stout is unique. The coffee flavor offsets any bitterness nicely, and the chocolate is strong enough to make it a beer you will want to go back to. This is something you definitely need to try, out of all the chocolate beers I have tried so far it is the most chocolaty, though that may change once I try the Chokolat. I am very excited to have a store in the area selling Southern Tier and looking forward to trying there other offerings as well, specifically the Chokolat and Creme Brulee."
"overall, im a huge fan of this beer. i love huge rich imperial stouts and dont mind them being on the sweeter side. the chocolate is very prevalent, but not overpoweringly so. the flavors linger on my palate for so long and i find it awesome. I have a huge appreciation of southern tier brews and this doesnt dissapoint at all."
"O: This beer is fantastic, great winter beer, very enjoyable and taste like dessert."
"O- I was not sure what to expect when I first ordered this, I was expecting something more coffee like, this one blew me away, just a pure dessert beer, I could of ordered 2-3 more pours, but luckily I had the wife present to stop me haha, love the chocolate flavors, really impressed with this offering."
"Chocolate in this beer is phenomenal, coffe is ok, a little faded. Extremely sweet, be warned."
"interesting case this. here the light body probably aids drinkability (as evidenced by my nearly empty glass) but reduces the overall enjoyment of the beer. its so close to being great, and even one of my favorite big stouts, but just falls a bit short. it really is quite an experience though. love that aroma!"
"Big thanks to Illudium for the sample, now lets get this into Texas ASAP."
"Fantastic beer -- the combination of chocolate and coffee is out of this world! Has Big John and Dragon's Milk qualities ... just a tad bit sweeter. Interestingly, I think some of the bitterness comes from the coffee ... prefer that over hop bite. It is definitely a sipping beer. I consumed the bomber bottle over the course of an hour and truly enjoyed it."
"O: I like cafe mochas, but this is really better than I think any true coffee mocha could ever be. After drinking this beer I've initiated a major hunt for all of their other stouts because I don't see dessert beers getting better than this. Feel in the mood for a little dessert decadence tonight? Don't bother with the bakery or ben & jerry's, grab a bottle of this southern tier bad boy. Awesome."
"O - My favorite of the series. Nice combination of coffee and chocolate and a perfect dessert beer for any chocolate lover."
"Overall: I used Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout (BBCS) as my benchmark, as BBCS is one of my top 5 beers. I must admit BBCS still remains my favorite chocolate/coffee Imperial Stout blends. Not that Mokah is not an outstanding ""must-try"" for any Imperial Stout fan, it just didn't rise to the same level as BBCS. This is my first Souther Tier beer and certainly won't be my last. I'm excited to try their Imperial Oatmeal Stout this weekend."
"O- I'm usually not a huge fan of coffee flavored stouts, but this one is nicely done. Mixed with the chocolate flavors make it very enjoyable. Can't wait to have another bottle of this."
"This is the best stout I've ever had to date. I like my stouts heavier on chocolate than coffee and it reflects my rating. I honestly don't think they could improve this in any way."
"O- Can it get any better than this? Better than Jahva, better than Choklat!!! The perfect blend of each! Bitter, sweet, dark and fruity!!! Do urself a favor and age some of this... it'll be worth the wait... trust me!!!"
"O: Sort of a disappointment honestly. Wanted a bigger more balanced flavor. Probably wouldn't get it again."
"O: I have never really been overwhelmed by ST's stuff, but maybe this Blackwater Series will turn me on to them. If this is any sign, I see good things ahead."
"O - A strong flavored Imperial Stout, if you are looking for bold flavors this one has it. Probably overwhelming for most, but nice once in a while."
"Overall: I liked it as a desert, could I drink it all the time, probably not."
"I feel full body on the tongue. It's definitely not thin, but the higher than usual carbonation for an imperial stout isn't helping this beer shine."
"Overall this is a pretty decent one, but not as good as the jahva. Looking forward to the creme brulee later this august."
"this poured a nice dark black with a nice one n half finger khaki head that is leaving lacing on the glass. the smell is all choklot with hardly any hints of coffee, at least to my partially congested nose but once you take a sip its nothing but coffee chocolate mix and its awesome, its like drinking desert but its not to rich or thick that you cant finish the bottle. i prefer this far over the choklot because it atains more balance and leads to better drinkability and that helps overall"
"Overall: While this is one of the characteristic sweeter dessert beers in the Southern Tier lineup, it has a nice balance and a great chocolate/coffee character"
"This is a great beer. A lot of chocolate imperial stouts tend to overdue it with the chocolate or the sweetness, or just the alcohol in general. Mokah, however, is an organic balance of all three, and much more."
"Thanks to BobCS for this one!! You must have read my mind."
"Great flavor, but the lack of body here just is leaving me amazingly under whelmed."
"O-My favorite of the Blackwater series. I love this beer and wish I had access to it year round. This is a fantastic dessert beer."
"Mokah pours out as a very deep brown color with a creamy looking tan head on it. The lacing has some decent retention along the glass. The smell of this beer is a really good mix of Chocolate and Coffee. It's very sweet smelling and just by the aroma should be considered as a dessert beer or a night cap. The taste had a big amount of coffee upfront that fades into the dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is a thick and rich silky smooth brew that leaves you wanting more. Overall this brew is better than the Jav-ah in my opinion. Although both brew are pretty good all around."
"O - A little more drinkable and balanced than Choklat. Very enjoyable."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 1 inch khaki head that fades to a thin cap. Good rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smells of Cocoa Puffs cereal, Hershey's milk chocolate, and coffee hard candy. There is also some dark roasted malt smells. Taste is like an alcoholic milkshake made with Cocoa Puffs, Hershey's syrup, and coffee flavoring. Very rich and very sweet. Low carbonation level makes for a very smooth and very creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good stout with a very tasty chocolate and coffee mix. The best of the Southern Tier stouts I have had thus far. With that being said, this is extremely sweet almost to the point of being cloying. Definitely a beer that is made for sharing."
"Overall, super impressed with the chocolate impressions implemented here. Liquid dessert."
"O- I am a huge fan of Choklat, not so much of Javah, but their lovechild is pretty solid. I really like that they blended two of their own big beers together to make this."
"Not my favorite, honestly. I just did not enjoy this as much as other offerings by ST. Thus far, in the Blackwater series, this is my least favorite."
"This is fantastic beer that will satisfy a craving for a coffee beer or a chocolate beer and is one of the best examples of either."
"d - supremely drinkable and enjoyable to the last drop. probably couldn't do more than a bomber of this in a night, but that's fine. worth seeking out."
"O: This one is really nice. Rich and complex, I think I might like this one better than the choklat. I'll have to revisit the chocolate and review it, but this one is awesome. Definitely will be getting this one again. Oddly enough, it gives me more coffee/java flavor than the java stout. Go figure..."
"Overall: I will not revisit this bottle, unless I can figure out that this bottle was very old. I got it from a store with a good reputation so I am not banking on it being too old. There are far better examples of both chocolate stouts and coffee stouts. As I saw in a previous review, the chocolate and coffee flavors that are noticable taste very artificial and it is a huge turn off."
"The drinkability suffers some because it's a bit saccharine."
"O: This is probably good with vanilla ice cream or with tiramisu. Drinking the entire 22 oz bottle by itself, however, is a chore."
"Poured into a snifter. Dirty motor oil color with no head and slight lacing. Aroma is strong of chocolate and some coffee scent. The mouthfeel is dry, almost grainy. Taste is of chocolate, black coffee, and nuts. Not as sweet as other Southern Tier stouts, and therefore, very good."
"This beer pours a opaque black color. The head is a half inch of tan foam that recedes slowly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of milk and dark chocolate, roasted malt, and a faint hint of chocolate. It is a very nice aroma, but if there were just a little more coffee it would be perfect. The taste is similar to the aroma, but with some strong heat in the finish. Again, I think it would be better if the coffee showed a bit more. The mouthfeel is full bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a really good beer, but it is not quite great. I would, however, happily drink it again."
"Taste is also predominantly chocolate, however, the difference is in the finish. Nice bitterness in the finish makes the sweetness not very overwhelming. The alcohol warmed me up with every sip. Definitely a sipper. Full-bodied, silky and creamy mouthfeel. This is a big beer and definitely worth a try for those who like a mix of chocolate and coffee in their stout."
"D - I'm in love with this beer. It is liquid chocolate cake and the alcohol is nowhere to be seen."
"Bottle. Poured into a MB tulip glass a dark brown boardering on black color win a fluffy 1 finger tan head. HUGE notes of chocolate in the nose with a touch of coffee and vanilla, seems the ST Chocolat dominates the nose in this one. The flavor has more of the coffee flavor which is rather nice. Sweet chocolate start mixed with a roasted coffee flavor. The coffee is much more prevalent in the taste than the nose lets on. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. Lingering roast bitterness."
"Overall it was good but not great southern tier brew I've had"
"A really nicely flavoured, big, chewy stout. A great dessert."
"This is incredibly drinkable. The alcohol is hidden entirely, and the beer is incredibly smooth and creamy. Overall, a delicious brew."
"m- perfectly carbonated with a creamy feel to it. The beer is like silk. I am getting impressed more and more with this beer."
"Mouthfeel: another full bodied beer. Smoothest Blackwater Series beer yet from Southern Tier. I think I like Mokah the best out of Chokolat, Creme Brullee, & Mokah! It is close thou. It bit more complex & it bit smoother out of the 3 I have tried."
"Generally, more approchable than the Creme Brulee though both are good in their own flavors"
"Overall - Another superb example of an imperial stout from Southern Tier although again a 650ml bottle is way too much... definitely recommended though..."
"Mouthfeel is just about medium-bodied, but more so on the thin side. Not as substantial as I had hoped. Drinkability is fair and average. Could definitely use more drive in the flavor profile, notably in the ""mocha"" sense. Very, very muted in the coffee, milk, chocolate flavors. Personally, it's suffering from the 'Jahva syndrome,' with the beer not tasting like its intended name."
"CHEERS"
"Drinkability is good. Pleasant coffee flavors meld with chocolate nuances to provide the titular taste. Southern Tier has done very well with their Blackwater series of stouts, with most of them being quality brews, and Mokah is no exception. It's a finely crafted brew and worthy enough for a try."
"What a treat. Just as it sounds, and has lived it up to what I thought it would taste like. Pitch dark. Poured into a tulip glass. The aromas of chocolate danced in the glass. Swirled with a nice head that slowly disappeared. The sweetness melts in your mouth, and goes down smoothly. High ABV hidden by it's sweetness. Served at slightly cooler than room temp. Dessert beer for sure. Something to share and enjoy with a friend."
"Rather timid appearance for an imperial stout--a far cry from pitch black with a wimpy head that quickly fades. Other than that it's all good. In-CRED-ible chocolate aroma makes me unable to keep my nose out of the glass. Not enough roasted malt in the taste, but the combination of coffee and chocolate flavors is quite well done. hi abv and cloying sweetness detract from the drinkability, but i don't think i'll have any trouble finishing the bomber. Haven't had jahva or choklat yet; this beer, while very good, doesn't do much to convince me to pull the trigger at $8.50 a bomber."
"Cheers..."
"This is a great beer, which is to be expected from Southern Tier. I am happy that they have decided to distribute to North Carolina and we are expecting them in the area this month YES."
"Another great, big beer from a great brewery."
"Not as sweet and creamy as their Créme Brùlee, this remains another reason why Southern Tier is one of my favorite breweries."
"Haha. No kidding! Well... That explains a lot in terms of the flavor... I actually almost bought a bomber of this last week-- glad I held off! Thanks to Seth for another beer!"
"Great desert drink, or a perfect evening closing sipper. Excellent stuff."
"Notes: This is a mix of the choklat and jahva stouts, and fittingly so, it tastes like the 2 were combined very well, neither of the 2 dominates the flavor but both are definitely there"
"Flavor overload, very good but our taste buds are being worked over on this one. Set this one aside for the obvious dessert beer or digestif. The name says it all."
"Too much chocolate in this one... Needs to be balanced a bit better."
"Overall a very remarkably indulgent stout. A was happy to taste bitter, charred flavors because the sweet smells had me fretting this would be a cloying glob of an ale - but it's not. Everything is just so luxuriously over-the-top. A great beer to share with a couple friends to break up a session of IPAs maybe? Definitely a dessert beer, better enjoyed fireside with a comfy flannel robe and fuzzy slipper. Thanks for spoiling me ST!"
"Pours jetblack with a 1 finger head which dissapated pretty quickly. the smell is awesome, hints of vanilla chocolate and coffee. it smells like breakfast. tastes like theres a lot of choklat and not as much jahvah. its really good. very sweet syrupy chocolate and coffee taste. the after taste is a little bitter, but pleasant. a really sweet beer, very tasty. i really enjoy these ST beers but sometimes i wonder if they should just start calling them malt beverages. Slow Sipper, share with a friend."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, slightly filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is a very nice big creamy stout worth drinking for a while if you're in the mood for the style."
"Off tap this beer was a truly opaque black color with a meniscus the color of root beer. The two finger head left killer lacing all the way to the finish of my glass. The aroma was so chocolaty it was amazing. In addition to chocolate I also smelled vanilla and hints of toffee. The flavors were stunning. Milk chocolate, dark chocolate, dark roasted malts, molasses, maple, coffee. Similar to a Tootsie Roll candy in flavor, which is wild given the %11.2 ALC. The mouthfeel was good, the body full and the carbonation average/soft. Very drinkable for a ""Big"" beer and for someone like me with a sweet tooth this beer was a true joy to imbibe."
"Drinkability is good. I couldn't have more than one in a sitting, but talk about a desert stout."
"D- Very drinkable for a sipper. Take it slow. The bitterness takes a little getting used to, and the alcohol boozy taste makes it one to take your time on. Be careful. Its good enough to sneak up on you fast."
"D- Very nice beer. Very drinkable but also very heavy in flavour. Viscosity is quite heavy which is very en"
"I'd recommend anyone who gets the chance to give a try to the Southern Tier Mokah. Overall, a pleasant (however, not perfect) Imperial Stout experience."
"D: Too much chocolate, not enough stout. Not very well balanced. It was good, but I won't place it on my list of things I must try again."
"D: Simply an absolutely delicious beer. I polished off a bomber on my own and if not for the 11% ABV I could easily drink another. The high alcohol content is incredibly well masked, which can easily lead to trouble if you're not careful with this one since it's just so incredibly delicious. Outstanding. Compared to its cousin ""Jahva"" (which is no slouch), this brew is in a league of its own."
"D - the abv is hidden deceptively well in this and I had no problem polishing off a 650ml in no time. It's good for a dessert beer, but give me Old Rasputin instead. I don't think this beer deserves the hype it gets but it's good."
"Overall, a nice sipping dessert beer. I recently had the Choklat, and must admit to liking that one much more than this. I'll have to grab another bottle of it and review it sometime!"
"Pours black as ink with a very nice beige head that fades to a ring. Fantastic aromas of very rich dark bitter chocolate and rich black coffee, perhaps with just a hint of cream and sugar. Not very sweet, lots of nice bitterness here. The taste has lots of strong, high quality coffee flavors with a finish that is more bitter chocolate, cream, and a touch of sweetness. Very big beer, but very smooth and quite enjoyable. Not nearly as cloying and sweet as the Creme brulee, but delivers an equally flavorful hit. Very good."
"Thick, a little syrupy, with a rich full body and negligible effervescence. Oh, baby this a really, really good beer. Awesome dessert beer, either with a dessert or as one. Bartender, another please."
"I have looked for this on-tap elsewhere, but haven't had any luck."
"i do not like flavored beers in general, and i do not like chocolate, though coffee is nice--iced coffee, cafe au lait, starbucks, any kind of coffee except coffee in my beer. i made a mistake ordering this beer, and left it on the table and finished my wife's widmer hefweizen"
"This beer is excellent. Southern Tier is a master of American Imperial Stouts and this is no exception. The only one I have left to try is Oat and I hope it lives up to my expectations. This beer is Choklat with a hint of Jahva. I recommend this one wholeheartedly. The blend of coffee and chocolate is masterful. Southern Tier should be proud of what they've done witht his beer. Do your best to pick this one up!"
"D - no thanks, too bitter."
"M/D: This beer is silky smooth, with a sweet finish. The beer is pretty well balanced, maybe leaning toward the sweet side. I would pick another one of these up for sure."
"D/N: Drinkability points? Well, don't drink this if you're in the mood for red bull-vodka and clubs (I know, you wouldn't be reading this if you were, but fair warning all the same). Pretty much any other time is acceptable, though. There's nothing remotely off-putting about this beer and would be enjoyed by many who don't normally like beer. Just remember to share."
"Drinkability: I might be Southern Tier homer, but this is a very tasty sweet Imperial Stout. Have some more in the cellar, curious to see how it holds up, as it was still really enjoyable with this much age on it."
"D-This is a fine beer. Best enjoyed by sipping. Southern Tier brews some excellent imperial stout."
"D - I've had much better Imperial stouts. A shame really, as I wanted to really love this offering from Southern Tier but sadly it just didnt do it for me. Theres much better ones out there."
"D: I really wasn't excited about finishing the bomber."
"All in all, this is another good brew from ST. I def love the over the top flavors of this brewery. Definitely try if you like Choklat or similar thick / heavily carbonated stouts."
"Drinkabilty - With Its high alcohol, and bitter mocha overload, this beer doesnt do it for me. Couldnt finish the 220z. I dont want this again, so much better coffee stouts out there. This smelled better then it tasted to me."
"D: One of the more powerful stouts that I've ever had. This one really makes a deep and lingering impression."
"Drinkability: Depends on how you define it... You start feeling the high alcohol towards the end of the 1st glass. I'm not sure I'd attempt to drink a 2nd bottle unless I was in a serious drinking mood. I love it anyway."
"Pours jet black with a nice light mocha head. Good retention and a bit of lacing on the way down. Great coloring. Nose brings loads and loads of chocolate as well as a strong amount of coffee. The taste is all about the chocolate and coffee, but can get a tad bit sweet, as there is some roasted malt, but not enough to balance out the sweetness. Feel is fairly heavy with a bit of alcohol. Drinks really well and I prefer it to Choklat."
"D-the first time i had this, i drank it quite slowly, then after awhile i just started falling in love with this. the ABV hits quickly but its so tasty that i would drink this til i got sick."
"D: another well-executed beer by s.t."
"Black with a sandy head. Looks like dark coffee. The smell is of chocolate that overpowers any other aroma that might be trying to get your attention. You pick up the chocolate from accross the room. As one might expect the taste of chocolate is incredible with a nice coffee finish. This is a smooth, medium to full bodied beer with light carbonation. One is enough for me, preferably as a dessert after a nice meal."
"Very nice, I still prefer Southern Tier's Choklat, but this is a nice change of pace."
"This is a great beer to have on a special occasion or to pair with dessert. Just keep in mind that drinking a whole bomber might be difficult unless you spend a lot of time on it."
"coffee finally reveals itself in the flavor, with the bitter chocolate contributing beautifully as well. Little heat in this bottle, just beautiful balance and thick malts. Outstanding way to start the day.."
"D: Off the charts for a beer of this strength, but still - a big body and notable alcohol will slow you down a bit, so no 5 here."
"Chokolat is perhaps a more impressive Southern Tier stout but this one might be a bit better balanced. Definitely less potential for cloying. Tasty times."
"Was hoping for a little more but this beer is a superior candidate for bourbon or whiskey barrel aging, IMO"
"damn, thats a good beer, but its a bit more chocolaty than i expect from an imperial. great beer from southern tier, but not so good as jah vah or iniquity."
"Lots of cocoa to the tongue from the initial sip to long after the swallow. Interestingly, there's no indication to the high level of alcohol present. Lowly carbonated, given this beer a thick oily mouthfeel."
"Southern Tier Mokah is a solid black beer. It takes a heavy pour and then cascades to form a thick, dense, light brown foam that leaves thick sheets of lacing on the glass. It has a huge, sweet, chocolate aroma with a note of coffee. It has a very smooth, full body that's chewy with a clean finish. It has a huge chocolate flavor. Yes, stunning amounts of chocolate. It tastes like a 60%-cocoa chocolate bar. Later in the taste comes medium roast coffee and a lemon peel bitterness. This is serious business. I'm a big fan of chocolate beer, so this got me pretty excited. It's thick and strong. Like a lot of Southern Tier's stouts, this one is for dessert."
"drinkability: So well balanced that the intense flavors and surprisingly dry finish make this much more drinkable han expected."
"If this beer was a person it would be Michael Clarke Duncan in The Green Mile when he played, wait for it, John Coffey. I would recommend splitting a bottle over dessert with 3 or 4 people."
"D - Good stout but could be better. Higher ABV so be careful. Overall not as good as Chokolat which is one of my favorite stouts and is ranked up there on this site but still delicious."
"Southern Tier please distribute to TX soon!"
"an intense syrup of coffee and chocolate. Pours a thick black with a finger of head. Nose of nothing of quick's chocolate. Palate is like a candy RIS with a rich sugar. Lean feel with body backed in sugar and non-fermentables. Not really something with an intense body to back the alcohol but sugar to high the broad somewhat aggressive abv. Warm but no palate abrasiveness due to the dulling carob cocoa."
"D: Delicious brew but almost an overwhelming amount of chocolate and not enough coffee for balance"
"I love this style and really like how Southern Tier isn't afraid to take chances and create good beers like no others you've tasted before."
"Drinkability is excellent. This might be my favorite stout. Perhaps overly simplistic in it's overt chocolaty, but my is it tasty. So rich, the ABV is lost. Not a guzzler by any stretch, but so indulgent that I had to order another, even though I shouldn't!"
"This beer has a pitch black appearance and thick head upon first pour that dissipates to nothing. The mouthfeel is think and creamy. There are some really nice chocolate and coffee notes in the taste, but to me, the flavor of the alcohol is not masked well. I can smell it in the glass and it over powers the other flavors of the beer. It is 11% so it is certainly a strong beer, but I do not like the boozy quality that only gets worse as the beer warms up. I want to work through the ST Imperial Series. I enjoyed Pumking and Big Red, but I do not think I will get this one again. I hope Chokolat, Javah, and Creme Brule are better."
"Complex, deep chocolate flavors accompanied by the promised mokah with a hint of dark cherry. Body is moderately carbonated with minimal head, and its sweetness aside, it's easy to drink."
"Poured into a snifter Mokah is nice black stout with a fat furry head . Aroma is sweet "" moon pie "" esque smell . Nice lacing on glass but after that, is where I have an issue with the brew. Tasting this over and over during MNF .The sweetness is too much .It is OK but not thick or chewy enough for my liking . It is not nasty but , this has been aged over a year and the flavors have not evened out. This is not Creme Brulee sweet but it is not my thing . Choklat is still my fav . If this had more of a coffee flavor then it would get a better grade . Good but not great ."
"Taste-Big onrush of sweet Belgian chocolate laced with smooth Jamaican coffee with cream. Alcohol hidden way back in the bushes to grab you later if you're not careful. Long, sweet, warming finish. One of the more chocolate-forward imperial stouts I have had."
"Pours a two finger light tan head that vanishes leaving no lace. Black color no highlights. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Chocolate and coffee nose. Flavor is a good chocolate/coffee, some sweetness. High ABV is hidden. $7.69 for a 22oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"D - Ambivalent about this one. Big flavors and high ABV. But, it reminds me of the pound bag of peanut butter M&Ms...I know I should stop, but it is so good..."
"Although I was anticipating more coffee flavor, Mokah provided an interesting and complex taste profile that has inspired me to taste Jahva and Choklat, the Southern Tier Imperial Stouts that were combined to produce this offering."
"Oh man. This beer is like drinking a coffee milkshake. Mouthfeel is silky, and this beer tastes strongly of chocolate. You would never know this is 11% ABV. I don't usually have a sweet tooth, but this is an amazing beer. This isn't something you can have more than a bomber of, and you'd have to drink that bomber slowly, but wow. This is delicious. Highly recommended - will absolutely get this again."
"OK, I will keep my door open to this beer, but only under 1 condition. I would try this again if it was paired up with a proper meal that (gag) may actually compliment this hideous creation."
"D: ridiculously smooth and easy to drink. Fantastic for a local shelf beer. Cheers!"
"D - A sipper for desert or on a cold winter day. It can be versatile that way but it's certainly not the easiest drinking beer. No alcohol involvement either but it'll knock you down soon enough."
"Thick, stout mouthfeel but the big alcohol presence in the taste really destroy this."
"As usual for Southern Tier's big beers, this is best for those with a sweet tooth, especially if you're tackling a bomber by yourself. Sweetness is big here but not as overwhelming as their Creme Brulee at least. Great dessert beer."
"Pours deep amber to a black color, with a light tan head. In the aroma, sweet chocolate and a pronounced mocha flavor. In the taste, bitter mocha flavor, kind of like hot cocoa mix. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry, bitter, hot cocoa mix in the aftertaste. Kind of like a sweet imperial stout with some Swiss Miss mixed in it, with a small bitterness."
"Mouthfeel is excellent, starts out as a bitter beer, the carbonation provides a nice mouthfeel, while the chocolate provides a finish reminiscent of chocolate milk. This is an exceptionally drinkable beer due to how it changes throughout, especially a 22oz bottle over time warming up a bit."
"This is definitely a sipper and aimed squarely as a complement to dessert or as dessert itself. ABV is never a detriment; which is why beers like this are dangerous for me."
"D- This beer was very good. Drinkable is not really the right word for this. The ABV is the only downside to this beer. Oh well can't have it all and it limits you to a pint or two before you might start to feel it."
"O - This is definitely a nice sipping beer for the morning, although you may need a nap after finishing it."
"O: This is an amazing beer. A little more carbonation to enhance the creamy feel and this would be perfectly on point. Would do well pairing with some awesome dessert dishes. I love the blend and they pulled this one off very well."
"Poured a jet black into a pint glass, with a bit of fluffy caramel head that leavs a bit of lace on the glass. Smell is amazing, chocolate dominates the nose with lesser undertones of fig and tree. Taste is spot on, with a nice boozy warming feeling of coffee spiked with a nice roasted malt taste, with hints of sweet molasses. Overall how can you not like a coffee brewed beer, two of my favorite drinks blended amazingly well."
"Bomber poured into a chalice. Dark black with light head. Smell is intensely sweet chocolate. Taste is mostly chocolate.. with an emphasis on semisweet dark chocolate chips. Coffee definitely takes a backseat to the chocolate here. Finishes slightly bitter with a bit of hoppy flavor. Very similar to Southern Tier's Choklat. This is extremely delicious and very drinkable for being more than 11% ABV."
"I love this beer and the extreme thickness helps balance the abv."
"D: It is very easy to drink if you are used to bitter stouts or barleywines. The bitterness is not too strong but it is there. If you can sit down and drink a cup of coffee without thinking twice, this is the beer for you. It is mocha in every sense of the word. At 11% ABV it will knock you off your feet. I was originally going to give the beer a 4.5 for drinkability because of the slight alcohol flavor, until I looked at my bomber bottle and realized that it was nearly empty!!"
"Drinks rather well. Very sweet, and almost over-the-top flavoring may not be for some, but would do well for many people who claim to not like beer. Perfect dessert beer that packs a bit of booze in strength and flavor that detracts slightly from its drinkability."
"Due to my love of coffee this takes the cake over S.T.'s Choklat which is a chocolate bomb. 22 oz. bomber is best shared as dessert with chocolate chip cookies. Yumm. Overall this is one fine beer. Yumm...."
"D: Compared to Creme Brulee, which was tooo sweet and tooo much vanilla to get through a bottle, this stout is very much drinkable. I would have preferred a lower ABV to cut down on the Alcohol bit though."
"D: I'm planning on sipping on this for the rest of the evening, but it's going down pretty quickly. Overall, a very good imperial chocolate stout."
"D- This beer has alot of flavors going on through out the mouthful. A strong Imperial with coffee and chocolate and oh so goodness. A must for another."
"Drinkability is not bad for an Imperial Stout, the alcohol is very well masked beneath everything else that's going on. However this beer is extremely sweet and bold, which means I'd normally settle for a single glass in a sitting."
"D- Overall, I really enjoyed this one. The fusion of chocolate and coffee was really well done. The alcohol is a little hot when fresh but some aging will help this. I'm interested to see how this one ages after a year or two. Recommended!"
"That being said, this still scores well with me as I am a sucker for both chocolate and coffee beers, and this really hits the spot in many ways. Glad to have finally tried it."
"Cheers"
"Overall this is a solid beer and people who love Choklat will especially be a fan, however it lacks the complexity to be very good. Still, it's worth a shot."
"D- Wow no thanks on this one. Nothing other than chocolate and it was pretty hard to drink."
"D- the sweetness knocks it down a notch. Its certainly a delicious beer...but yeah, can be a little much. Total sipper"
"D: This is a deceptive 11-percenter. It felt like it wasn't that strong while drinking it. I recommend sharing this beer with someone else because of how strong it is. Pair it with a dessert, or drink it as a dessert. I had mine with a hazelnut gelato, and it was a perfect combination."
"Very well done and tasty."
"D - Theoretically, this would be my favorite of the Blackwater series, but in reality it is a distant third at best. Still, I will drink the hell out of this."
"Poured a nice black into a pint glass. Gave about 2 fingers of head but left very little lacing. The smell is fantastic. The only thing I picked up was chocolate with a little coffee picking up the rear. The taste was equally amazing. I actually felt like I was drinking chocolate milk mixed with a nice dose of coffee at times. Not a bad thing in my book. Its actually what I was really hoping for with this beer. Mouthfeel was great. Silky smooth on the tounge with a very nice aftertaste. Drinkablility was good. I definitely would never have guessed its 11% but its just a little too sweet to make a session beer. Loved this beer and would recommend it to all!"
"A bloody fantastic dessert beer. ♥"
"Salud!"
"This is a good beer. I love it."
"D= If you've had one of these backwater series stouts you've had them all. This is no different. Tastes just like the product then name it after. Worth the money to try once at least."
"Drinkability: Sipper. This beer can split you in half at 11.00% ABV."
"Drinkability: Tasty, but one that would be best suited as an after dinner beer or as a sipper."
"O: Great conversation beer, but would probably benefit from lower abv. A bit like Las Vegas. Nice to visit, but only in moderation."
"M- Full, thick and syrupy as expected. Pretty warm from intense alcohol."
"D: For such a big, sweet beer, it goes down remarkably easy...however, it's definitely a sipper."
"D - one to sit back and slowly enjoy; one 22 oz bottle at a sitting will suffice."
"Draft courtesy of Underground Bluz. Aroma was primarily of light coffee but also with dark fruits, some chocolate and alcohol. Pours black with mahogany highlights. A 2-finger creamy tan head coats the top. Lacing is thin and gets thinner as the beer sits. The taste is rich and dark-chocolate sweet. The sweetness is not that cloying kind of sweetness like sugar or honey. Bitterness is of the coffee variety and stays toward the front of the mouth rather than digging into the back. It's not a hoppy kind of bitterness. Medium creamy mouthfeel. The beer stays consistent as it warms. The alcohol is more noticeable in the nose than on the palate. I am normally quite attuned to too much alcohol burn in the beer. Primarily this is why I don't enjoy some imperial styles. But I did not find the same kind of burn in this beer. Very good."
"D - not sure if this beer is really drinkable do to what i said about how it tastes it maybe better off pouring over a scoop of ice cream"
"This beer like Choklat has a strong, up front, and in your face nose. It is a perfect blend of Javah and Choklat in one beer. The nose follows straight through to the taste of this beer. It's sexual. The mouth feel of the beer is smooth as silk and leaves a nice lining on your glass. It is a perfect sweet coffee stout. I personally could drink this year round. Buy it while it is out, since it is a limited release. It will age well till next years release."
"D - Big, sweet, thick and surprisingly well balanced considering the divergent points of the flavor compass that it hits. The aroma is somewhat subdued, with a subtle spicy chocolate note as its most prominent aspect. Nonetheless, while it may be a somewhat one dimensional aroma, being simply the aroma of chocolate, it is still enticing as it is the aroma of very good chocolate. The beer only really comes alive once it hits the tongue with a combination of rich, creamy chocolate and intriguingly spicy coffee that melds flawlessly. There is a lot of caramel in the background, which works nicely with the chocolate character and seems to highlight the chocolate's richness in particular. I an inclined to think that the national origin of the chocolate used in a beer would be of little consequence, but whether it is real or just a placebo effect, I can't help but think that the chocolate character in this beer has a smooth, buttery richness that I would normally associate with Belgian chocolates in particular. The coffee is quite interesting as well. I don't know if it is a varietal characteristic or something from the malt bill, but the coffee notes are unusually spicy and chicory like, which plays nicely off of the subtle pine hop character and acts as a contrast to the creamy thickness of the chocolate. I am usually of the opinion that chocolate and coffee are wasted in most stouts as they rarely achieve flavors that malt, if used skillfully, could not by itself, but this beer is a stunning exception. This is the best Southern Tier brew that I have tried thus far, and it is a unique and very well executed interpretation of the style."
"Overall, however, Mokah remains amazing, just know it requires some laying down for, oh, I would guess six to nine months before getting the heat out . Then it should be heaven. (btw, pairing this with some salted caramel chocolate, courtesy of my friend Jon, and the combination is dang near transcendent)"
"D - At 11% and fairly syrupy idk that i could drink more than one 22oz bottle im on the second half of the bottle and its getting hard to drink"
"I like this its much more balanced than Southern Tiers Chokolat which I found to be to much chocolate. Nicely Done."
"D: This beer is a good sipper and the alcohol doesn't stand out too much in the taste, but it's very difficult to drink an entire bottle in one sitting. It would definitely pair well with a chocolate dessert."
"It's really had to compare the two but I really loved this beer anyway and was glad to try it. I love every big beer produced by Southern Tier and I hope they keep making them for years to come!"
"This is what I want a chocolate and coffee stout to be! Rich chocolate and freshly pulled espresso from the most talented barista. The velvety texture is completed nicely with a soft carbonation. This is clearly an eleven percent beer, but despite the heat this goes down smooth and easy. Simply not a stretch to get lost on the rich flavors of this masterful display of an Imperial Stout."
"D- despite the alcohol, the brew goes down really smooth. I've said this before.... southern tier has some great brews that can introduce others into another side of craft beers. Remember though... even though it's smooth... you should sip this bad boy"
"During the pour, this brew appears a bit thinner than it ought. In the bowl, though, it sits starkly opaque, a cool obsidian in color, with a finger of foamy, light khaki head. Like ST's Creme Brulee, this pool of darkness gives off a scent most desserts would kill for. Luscious chocolate syrup tops a blonde vanilla cake, while an aromatic cup o' joe sitz steaming nearby, waiting to provide a pleasant bit o' liquid accompaniment to the baked goods at hand. Digging in, the coffee takes more of a lead, and it is evidently a darker roast than initially figured. The chocolate syrup has hardened into a brick of bitter dark chocolate, and it is clear that the cake is composed primarily of darker grains, malted and roasted. A small vein of vanilla still slices through, but quite thinly. Though not as alluring as the nose, I would order this tasty dessert every time I found myself at this particular eatery. Just as suspected, the body is thinner than usual, but only slightly so. This, coupled with a low-lying carbonation and a sweetly moderate coating of the mouth, makes for a rather drinkable sweet stout."
"I am interested/nervous to try their choklat after having this."
"Pours a clear black (very dark brown) with dark brown edges, thin cream colored head, a couple of blobs of lace. Smell: hot chocolate with a buttload of chocolate, a little roast. Nice, but that's it, not getting much from Jahva. Taste: chocolate syrup, very lightly roasted, earthy hop finish, boozy in the finish. Mouthfeel: carbonation is a little low and the finish is a little sharp. Chocolate stout with a ton of booze, and not the best chocolate stout at that. Javah is occasionally here but most often not. Still enjoyable."
"This is one of the best Imperial Stouts I've ever had, and I've had dozens upon dozens. I'm definitely recommending this one. Great job by Southern Tier."
"The perfect dessert beer. Seek it out. Please. If Southern Tier stops making this becuase it gets overshadowed by Choklat, Jahva, and Oat; I'm coming after all of you."
"Its hard to follow a nose like that, but this beer makes a good, if not as enjoyable effort. Far more coffee in the taste then the nose, and a little less chocolate than I would have expected. A bit of alcohol burns on the end of the drink, and there is light carbonation that lingers under the medium/heavy body. This is the sort of drink you should enjoy with cheese or dessert, but it will hit you hard at anytime - you definitely feel the 11% ABV."
"D- Alcohol is generally well hidden on this one. The sweetness, bitterness and astringency are almost over the top... keeping this beer from rating high in the drinkability department."
"taste is overwhelmingly chocolate. Problem is, it is overwhelmingly artificial chocolate flavoring. It reminds me of Rogue Chocolate Stout. Seems like they are trying too hard on the chocolate, and instead of balancing it, they try to overwhelm it. I had high hopes for this beer, but was utterly disappointed. On a better note, the high abv is well hidden, but I suppose if you pump enough chocolate into it, it will do that."
"D- A perfect five here- I really like this brew, and would have it firmly on a ""beer dinner"" list, paired of course with dessert!"
"D- I really like this ST brew. I recall it being one of my favorites, if not my favorite, of the ST stout line-up on-tap. The bottled version doesn't quite meet what I remember but this is still a very good brew overall. I'd say the overall impression is a sweet mocha coffee blend (duh)...and that is clearly what ST is going for. Still, ST stouts (with the exception of creme brulee) rank among my absolute favorite overall."
"Certainly seems more like a 60 Choklat/40 Jahva combination to me. Very decent."
"Flavor is great. Definitely needs to be drank a little above fridge temp to celar temp. This beer's flavor is seriously masked to the palate at fridge temp. Once it warms, tons of mokah like(coffee/chocolate) flavors take over. The aftertaste is all chocolate. Its a very sweet chocolate at that. Mouthfeel is medium body, medium to high carbonation. Booze isn't even a factor. A great beer from Southern Tier!"
"The beer pours a dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma is milk chocolate with some coffee as well as some cream. The flavor is heavy on the milk chocolate with some creamy coffee notes. Thick mouthfeel and low carbonation. A excellent, full bodied stout that is very heavy on the chocolate."
"Looking forwards to this one it pours a dark expresso coffee hue with decent carbonation that leaves a fast vanishing one finger head and sporadic spotty lacing,the aroma to be expected is quite a standout with a nice mix of dark expresso and belgian chocolate not much else gets thru on the nose past these two aromas,it has a very sweet chocolate milk taste which coats the mouth quite well with a nice bitter coffee finish and also a dash of fruity hops right at the end but not much and leaves a coffee taste on your palette very nicely just like you have had a coffee,overall its a very decent brew that i would definately revisit although its not for everybody with its sweetness and almost close to a Milk Stout in my mind but could easily see this being paired up with a nice rich dessert."
"Appears very dark in the glass with two fingers of mocha colored head that had very good retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Large amount of lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is more on the chocolate than on the coffee side. Dark chocolate is complimented by some cream. Smells almost like ice cream. Alcohol is also detected. The flavor is more chocolate than coffee. I would of preferred it the other way. It has a chocolate milk quality. Slightly sweet with just a hint of coffee. Alcohol heat also plays a large part in the finish. A little too hot. Not a huge body but it is substantial and slightly chewy. Coats the mouth well. Carbonation is low and has a nice texture. I would like this much more if it featured coffee more and the alcohol toned down."
"d - I've been holding into this one for about 7 months or so and finally drank it and thought it was amazing. I'm a big fan of ST's Choklat & Creme Brulee and this is right up their with them. Amazing chocolate smell and taste and will definitely try again."
"Velvety and full bodied mouth feel to this beer. This is one fabulous offering from Southern Tier."
"It's good underneath the alcoholic heat so why not just tone it down?"
"D: There's no reason in the world that a beer like this should be so friggin' easy to drink...but it is. World class!"
"D- Easy drinking.. the 11% isn't hidden very still it's got a sting to it. Smells great but lacks the complexity."
"A world without stouts is a nightmare not worth contemplating; I'm grateful to have relative access to the four amazing beers (and this blend of two of them) that comprise Southern Tier's incredible 'Black Water' series. Although I hope these beers will be around forever, I'll continue to stock the cellar with them as if they won't."
"22oz bomber pours a dark black with a decent amount of foam. Smell is of dark chocolate. The taste is of strong chocolate with a hint of coffee. So much fucking chocolate in this beer, its beautiful. I swear I just ate a hersey bar. So damn smooth for the 11%. Loads and loads of chocolate. I can't wait to try the Choklat. Very damn awesome beer. Everyone should buy this beer if they see it."
"It's hard to figure out why the combination of two out-of-this-universe American double stouts wouldn't lead to something better than this. Don't get me wrong, Mokah is good stuff and is worth a purchase. That said, Southern Tier could eliminate it from the lineup and I would not shed a tear."
"D: not sure what to think of this, pretty extreme. This brew is the port wine of the beer world. I could see this as an after dinner delight. Make sure to share this beer as I am finding myself wrestling to finish this one. Wild stuff!"
"D: I was surprised by how easy to drink this was given some of the other Southern Tier beers. While it's certainly high in alcohol, the flavor is not cloying."
"D: Highly drinkable. Very good job in hiding the 11%ABV!. One of the best of the style. I have another aging for one year or two! This one was bought at Liquor Depot in New Britain, CT and was aging on their shelves for about a year!"
"Probably couldn't have more than one bomber. Great as dessert."
"It is highly drinkable with a lingering dry bitterness like a medium roast Costa Rican coffee on the finish. Handle with care. The impact builds up quickly."
"Notes: It´s a rather top notch dessert brew, and in that context one of the favorites I´ve tried from Southern Tier. It may not make such a lasting impression in non-beer crowds like their creme brulee but it is a good ale to offer closing the table, or opening it with and after dessert..."
"(D)- Dont get me wrong, this tastes good; I just wish there was something more to it than an alcoholic milk chocolate shake. Very one-dimensional to me. If I had this again, it would definitely be as a replacement for dessert. Way too filling & sweet to me to enjoy fully on my own. Share a bottle with at least 2 people."
"D: OK, but not great. Personally I enjoyed the Jahva much more. It's a little thin and seems to have a stronger alcohol presence then others of this style"
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was really black and poured a really this disappointing head. The beer smelled and tasted like oatmeal and was of course chocolaty. I liked the beer and will buy it again. It was expensive. The little bitty head was tan colored."
"D- While I really enjoy the flavor and smell of this I don't think I'd want to drink too many of these. It is very sweet and the alcohol is high which don't bode well for drinkability. However, I would definitely recommend it and look forward to having it again in the future."
"Serving- Bomber"
"d: Jahva is a pretty good coffee stout. Choklat is a great desert beer in small doses. I was hoping hoping an artful blend would elevate both beers. Instead all I found was another syrupy sweet desert beer from ST. Creme Brulee, Oat, Choklat, and now this. Pretty good in small doses, but that signature ST sweetness wears thin after 6 ounces."
"This beer sure hit everything spot on. All of the expected flavors come through in one way or another. I'm glad I split it with a friend though, as I would have struggled to finish the bottle on my own as the ""hotness"" was a bit strong for me. Still, this would make a great dessert beer."
"I finished the bottle myself but wished for someone to split it with half was thru one glass was enough in one sitting. A interesting brew I may buy another to share as a desert"
"The bottled version of ST Mokah is still a very solid offering but pails in comparison to the tap version... The only component which is consistent between the two is the stellar aroma... All other categories are a downgrade in bottle form, the two biggest drops being taste and mouthfeel..."
"Mmmmm...coffee and chocolate. 22 oz. bomber into a tulip glass and the goodness began to roll. Black, thick pour (a bit oily IMO) with a slight tan head that dissipated quickly. Sweet chocolate smell dominates with a little coffee at the back end. The taste was more balanced than the smell, with chocolate and some vanilla tones up front and a mellow coffee finish. Mouthfeel...smoooth. Thick, with little carbonation. Overall I'd say great drinkability, especially as an after dinner selection. 11%? Hard to tell until after the fact...great beer!"
"Overall a pretty good chocolate coffee beer but more on the chocolate side. A good choice for a desert beer but not something I would have very often."
"Poured into a pair of shaker glasses. Mokah appears a deep dark brown color with about an inch of fluffy ecru foam. Not really getting much coffee notes here. Mostly that sweet tootsie roll smell and flavor that is so very prevalent in Choklat. Milk chocolate, and sweet caramel dominate the flavor and aroma. Medium to full bodied with adequate carbonation."
"Mouthfeel: Very viscous; moderate alcohol warmth; soft subtle carbonation"
"Silky and smooth with only slight carbonation. After aging for a year, the texture is a bit syrupy, but it has retained its coffee character phenomenally. This is a good one to share, as its a bit too much to handle, both from a sweet and a buzz standpoint. A great after-dinner beer."
"Taste follows suit.Chocolate, coffee, and a small hint of vanilla all fill the taste. This is a rich brew, better suited towards an after dinner drink than anything else. Very tasty though. Smooth and adequately carbonated. Very tasty, and I look forward to having more of these."
"Overall this an outstanding chocolate/coffee imperial stout that is well-crated and deeply complex. If i did not know that this was a blend of Choklat and Jahva I would have thought even higher of this beer, but if I'm in the mood for a chocolaty beer I would prefer to go with its superior brother, Choklat. This beer however is quite nice and if your looking for a little more Jahva in your Choklat than this is for you. Recommended."
"D - Very drinkable brew, there's almost nothing I didn't enjoy about it. Mouthfeel is a bit rough, but not necessarily bad. Overall this was a pleasure to drink and I'm looking forward to picking up some more Southern Tier brews."
"Being a huge fan of Jahva, I was looking greatly forward to this. Still can't find Choklat in this area, but if this is the meeting point of the two aforementioned (as stated on the label), then I guess I'm halfway there. As expected, Mokah is completely, utterly wonderful."
"On-tap at Cole's. Pretty good coffee beer, with significant and above-average mouthfeel based on mokah. Dark brown, creamy, tasty, bitternsweetness, though leaning on sweet. Pleasant mochah aroma. Expresso coffee beans and chocolate in secondary.A must try."
"This is a rich, tasty stout, but with the 11 percent ABV, it's definitely a sipper. It is definitely not to be taken lightly."
"It's easy to drink, but not without consequences. As you gulp down this baby, your get dizzy, peachy, rosy, and finally sleepy..."
"overall a superb beer..my first from southern tier and i have to say im thoroughly impressed..this would make a great dessert beer all on its own..a nice sipper"
"22 ounce poured into a pint glass on Thanksgiving day. I didn't care for this one at all. There was virtualy no head or lace to speak of. Some burnt coffee and vanilla but I'm smelling and tasting mostly just alcohol. I'm quite dissapointed with this one because I'm a stout lover and was looking forward to it after seeing so many good reviews here. Possibly I got a hold of an older bottle but being an imperial I would figure it would have some decent shelf life. It was a struggle to finish."
"Highly drinkable, but better as a dessert beer than one for regular enjoyment."
"A great beer, something I would have a cold fall night like tonight, probably a great dessert beer."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large dirty brown foamy head with good retention and some great lacing. Aroma of nice black chocolate malt with nice creamy espresso notes. Taste is a nice mix between some very well balanced black chocolate and some creamy espresso with a nice dose of lactic sugar. Body is full with nice carbonation and a great creamy texture. Very well done with all the ingredient well balanced out and doesn't taste too artificial."
"Sip-purs, no doubt. Take your time with this. Ok, but far too one-dimentional to be one of my favorites."
"A sipper for sure and the smooth, light carb aids the sipping. A dessert beer, wouldn't want this with a meal or summer. A bomber is the max but for what it is, relatively drinkable."
"P St. Whole Foods/$9/22 oz"
"Have to try this one more time to make up my mind, but plan to share the bottle among four people - in my case, a large chunk ended being wasted (divided in two)."
"Drinkability: It is interesting to me how these two beers when combined do not mix. It is like having the two separates tastes one after the other. I will have this again, but would just as well have the two beers separate depending on what I am in the mood for."
"D - definitely a sipping beer aimed squarely at dessert or a select few complementary meals, but given that target it's right on. ABV is never a detriment; all to easy to get hammered on it. Only the overly one-sided sweetness keeps it from a higher drinkability rating."
"Overall, I highly recommend this beer. I've had Choklat, which is another great beer, but I think Mokah definitely trumps it. Rich chocolate and coffee. This is a perfect dessert. Thanks Southern Tier!"
"Overall a pretty standard one of Southern Tier's offerings as far as what I've come to expect... which is to say: it's not an amazing chocolate stout or coffee stout, but it would make a pretty good dessert sauce."
"D - Awesome winter stout that has to be slowly sipped."
"Overall - Feeling a little tipsy right now, but It was worth it. This one's a little one-dimensional compared to many other Impy Stouts, but the few notes it plays are harmonious and awesome. A great treat for mocha lovers."
"Black in body with off-white head that dissipates quickly. Deep, dark chocolate, coffee bean aroma that sends my mouth watering. Tastes of cappuccino, smooth dark chocolate, coffee with cream and sugar,chocolate cream. Medium in body with no carb that gets in the way of the decadent flavors. An enjoyable ale that is a let down to finish. ""Enjoy with or as your dessert!"" I like where your heads at Southern Tier."
"Tastes great, a good amount of bitterness but it mostly comes from the chocolate. The coffee and chocolate make a great mix and keeps my taste buds happy. Smooth mouthfeel and pretty drinkable for such a big beer."
"D: Good if you enjoy ST Chokolat. However, a little too sweet to drink in excess."
"- Certainly another desert beer from Southern Tier.... and easy to drink. I am wishing I had aged this one even another year or two..."
"Feel and Drinkability: Feel is nice, lighter in carbonation than the Jahva which works very well, too high would kill the chocolate in here. Feel in heavy (but lighter than both the Jahva and Choklat at the same time) and smooth too, just as are the two separate brews this comes from. Its not as smooth as the Choklat but smoother than the Jahva (Smooth as in velvety feel). This is very easy to drink, as aforementioned the best of both worlds. Very easy to drink and dangerous too. I'll be enjoying the rest of this bottle. I recommend this, highly recommend this. My choice of the three are Choklat, Mokah, Jahva."
"Drinkability: This is a fine dessert beer with great potential for sipping slowly after dinner while chatting with friends or reading a good book. In other words this is a beer worth taking the time to relax and enjoy one a night. However, it is also a beer to keep on hand for after dinner or late night enjoyment."
"D: I've had both beers that make up this blend (Choklat and Jah-va). I thought Choklat was decent and Jah-va compete mess, and this one falls somewhere in between. It very sweet, almost cloying, and this gets too much after a while. It's reminiscent of a dessert without high quality dessert flavors."
"Definitely is one for when you only want _one_. It is almost too drinkable, especially with its alcoholic content."
"Pours a deep, dark brown. Compact but dense khaki colored head that dissipates into a ring, leaving some lacing. Smell is of dark and semi sweet chocolate, hints of coffee, hops and booze. Taste is rich dark chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate, with touches of dark roasted coffee and sugar. Hops and Booze noted on the back end. Chocolate is very forward on this puppy. Mouth-feel is surprisingly thinner than i expected, could be creamier. Another very good beer from Southern Tier, but another where a 22oz bottle pushes the limits on how much i can handle of an extreme tasting beer. Definitely better at colder temps."
"Because of the heft of this beer in both abv and sweetness - it's not a beer that could be imbibed freely over an evening. Definitely a tasty after dinner beer - perfect for desserts - or as a dessert. Pour over vanilla icecream and enjoy!"
"On the palate the body is good with plenty of cocoa, coffee, roasty flavors, with some alcohol warmth. I suppose it is higher than many Imperial stouts. Hops help to balance some but who cares - the chocolate & coffee are to die for!"
"Drinkabily is moderate to high. We're looking at fairly high ABV here which limits it's sessionability quite a bit, but it's well incorporated which always makes for easier drinking. The flavor profile is fairly pleasing as well which makes for pretty easy drinking. All in all it's a pretty decent beer."
"Another champ from Southern Tier."
"Roasted coffee bitterness up front. This is quickly replaced by sweet caramel and chocolate malt notes. There are also some rummy dark fruits with a smoky, charred edge. Espresso and herbal hop bitterness pick up near the finish. Dark chocolate and vanilla mix in. Bittersweet finish with a healthy dose of roasted coffee. Lingering chocolate syrup. Warming. Full-bodied with a slightly oily feel. Pretty damn good!"
"Overall: This is an excellent desert beer. I think it would pair best with any dark chocolate cake. Not something I'd drink with a meal. I found it highly enjoyable, but I can see why some may not."
"Beer is warm in the taste. Probably due to the high alcohol. There is some roastiness on the back end of the flavor. The midpalate flavor is full of chocolate again. The coffee flavors definitely come at the end. Mouthfeel is fine. Neither thin nor thin. Imperial stouts should have some body to them, this hits the low end of that. Drinkability is surprisingly high considering style and ABV. Overall a very good, albeit, flavored beer. Imperial stouts are not my favorite, have to admit, but this one is good."
"The aroma is exactly like chocolate milk with coffee and toasted malt. The alcohol is well hidden. The appearance is dark brown with a smaller tan head. The taste has the same elements as the aroma but the bitterness is overpowering and unexpected since the aroma has no hops. The palate is smooth and almost thick but right about what I was expecting. Overall a fantastic smelling beer now they need to match the taste to it."
"Poured this one into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass, debated between that and a snifter style glass. I think either would be a good choice, I don't regret my choice. Pours a thick dark brown/black color that gets slightly lighter on the sides. A chocolate milk colored head that goes away fairly quickly, but it has some ok lacing to the glass. Smell is nice, dominated by what smells like a few different types of chocolate, mostly strong and bitter types. The taste is quite good. Some roasted malts to add to the different chocolate type flavors. Doesn't taste too bitter, has a sweet flavor to it as well, would be the perfect dessert beer. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth. It's very thick, might be a little too sweet if you weren't expecting it. The drinkablility is very nice eventhough it's very thick. I really enjoyed this beer but I'd recommend it really as a dessert beer only, it's so sweet that it's really tough to think of it in any other way. Still a very solid brew by Southern Tier"
"Cheers"
"It seemed to be the kind of thing I'd want to sip on to warm up by a nice fire."
"D - aided by the thin mouthfeel, this is not necessarily a weakpoint. I finished the 22 oz easily alone, and wish I had another! southern tier continues to be one of the most impressive breweries on the east coast."
"Notes: Bravo!"
"~ Purchased this 22 oz bomber from Big Z Beverage in Huntington, NY. As I start to describe this jewel, I stopped and asked myself ""what can I say about this that has not already been said before?"" Well, If you like beer, chocolate, coffee, or any combination of the three, then you are simply going to love this. If not, you will probably wind up rating this a c+ or b-. I am delighted to say I side with the majority. This is amazing! A Southern tier offering never ceases to amaze me. The brewery is always pushing its beer to the outer limits. All the mouth-watering flavors mask the 11% ABV like it's not even there. A truly delicious treat! Highly recommended! ~"
"Poured into a imperial pint glass a deep as an oil slick with no light showing thru when held up to the light,a thinner almond colored head atop.Heavy roast in the nose along with notes of vanilla and bitter chocolate,some sweet alcohol came out as it warrmed a little as well.Much sweeter on the palate than the nose,caramel/vanilla flavors mixed with some dark fruit and chocolate stand out most,the roast keeps it from becoming to sweet.Another impressive beer from ST,the sweetness is pretty big though."
"Drinkability: The flavours are rich, dark and incredibly filling; it feels more like a meal than a drink! Having said that, the flavours are brilliantly balanced, not too bitter and not too sweet, just right. It's slightly more coffee than it is chocolate, which prevents that cloying taste that is common with chocolate based imperial stouts. This is a decadent beer, and a real treat."
"Assertive and aggressive, but what else to expect from Southern Tier??..."
"Nice carbonation, medium level. Not much sign of alcohol as the sweetness hides it quite well. Good dessert beer that I would mind having a pint, but probably not more than that."
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy/creamy tan head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with lots of chocolate/toffee notes. The taste is sweet, malty, very good dose of chocolate/toffee, nice vanilla notes, very slight roasty notes. Medium body. Very drinkable, a very tasty brew, way to go ST."
"Damn good overall. My girlfriend loved it and she doesn't really like stouts. We agreed that it was pretty smooth in flavor but I think what got her was the slightly sweeter flavor of the chocolate. I'd love to have another bottle of this stuff."
"OVERALL: A great beer with a top-notch taste profile. One of the best coffee flavored beers I've had, and works very well with the chocolate of course. Quite drinkable too. Unfortunately the average look and feel held it back a bit in the ratings, but that certainly won't stop me from picking it up again. Very enjoyable. Recommended."
"taste is creamy, cocoa, some weak coffee in the back, a little licorice, and a little vanilla, ends dry and a touch of bitterness."
"Taste is creamy and roasty chocolate with a hint of coffee bitterness. I also get some walnut and pecan nuttiness. Aftertaste is more along the lines of a cup of joe. This would make a great breakfast drink, it's full bodied but not as viscous as, say, a ten fidy. ABV is very well hidden and the beer is dangerously drinkable at 11%. I am usually not a huge fan of coffee beers, but this is exceptional. Great beer!"
"The thought going through my head with this was: This is the kind of beer that a non-beer drinker could get started on. It's sweet, it's chocolatey, it's overall easygoing, with plenty of oomph without being overly aggressive."
"a very good beer overall. if it was readily available to me, i would buy it consistently."
"D-Love it for desert. You will have to be in the right mood for it. I can't believe (at first) it is 11% ABV, but I can certainly feel it by the end of the bomber. Southern Tier sets the bar for desert beers."
"Intense and flavorful, each sip brings some new complexity. A sweet beer, which may make it hard to drink for some, this is a beer to be shared and sipped slowly, perhaps with a canoli? or tiarmisu? Really a tasty beer. Hats off to Southern Tier."
"Pours a very dark black with almost no head or lacing at all. Tastes just as you'd expect with a name like Mokah. Very coffee on the start but quickly goes into some intense chocolate after a bit. Vert interesting beer to add to their line of crazy desert beers. Better than choklate but not quite as good as creme brulee."
"Southern Tier and especially their Blackwater Series, is the bomb."
"Drinkability: Way too boozy of a stout for me. 11% is high, but it is not hidden at all. The beer almost stings. The chocolate and coffee flavors are nice, but not smooth like I like. Very difficult to drink."
"This is a truly amazing beer, a great caramel color wen poured that settles dark with a very small head. Itsa stout brewed with chcolate and coffee and its amazing aroma smells very pleasing as you get a great hint of both flavors. It goes down so smooth a little bitter which is expected but leaves an amazing taste in your mouth when all is said and done."
"It's sort of like drinking a beer version of a starbucks frozen mocha drink, the kind that has loads of milk and ice. A good beer for sure, and even though I love the chokat, I gotta say, this not one of my favorite Southern Tiers."
"11% ??? yikes."
"D: Rather good actually. Another solid beer. Without the bit of artificalness it would be great."
"Pored a deep, deep brown with good carbonation and a small tan head. Nose is light but good with hints of light cocoa and coffee. taste is smooth and balanced, just the right mix of cocoa and coffee, very subtle and nice. Mouthfeel is smooth, tasty creamy. Drinkability is very good but one bomber and its time to retire."
"medium body, quite smooth and creamy, though can get quite astringent too towards the finish. mild to moderate carbonation is tingly but also creamy."
"D: Mokah is another outstanding offering from Southern Tier. Amazing flavor and texture. The chocolate and coffee aroma practically burst out the bottle. The only drawback, is the sweetness and high ABV make this one a sipper."
"I've had this bottle in my fridge since May. I don't know why I drank this on an August night. Partly because the weather was kind of cool, and partly to clear room in the fridge, I guess. I have never had Choklat or Jahva before, so I cannot comment as to how well this blend accommodates or improves upon those offerings. I am an imperial stout kind of guy, but this is huh wow (to borrow a message board meme). Southern Tier Mokah is straight up enamel-erasing. I feel like I've eaten an entire box of Russel Stover assorted candies. And taken a couple of shots of booze on top of that. I didn't come into this review with the intention of bashing the beer or writing funny lines or anything like that. But when a beer has such strong flavors that clash against each other, never making a cohesive whole, then I have little choice."
"D: I would not specifically trade for this, but I might take a sip of a future bottle."
"Black. Thin brown head. Lace is minimal. It is what it is. Very rich smell of rich chocolate. The good kind. Like Belgian chocolate. Almost like smelling a melted down bittersweet chocolate bar...but a good one, like a Belgian chocolate. Good smell overall, even with minimal barley aromas. This is like tasting a melted down bittersweet chocolate bar....but a good one. Like a Belgian one. That has been diluted a little bit so it's not like molten polymer in the mouth. The body is pretty full, but not like molten polymer. Which is good. There's a lingering bitterness that is agreeable. The bottle says its brewed with Jamaican roasted coffee, but I don't get a lot of coffee on the the buds. Slight roasted malt notes come and go. But chocolate overrides everything, which was probably the intent. It is what it is and I'd hate to find out how many calories I just ingested with this 22 oz bottle."
"Mouthfeel is good -- thick and hearty without being cloying or syrupy. ABV is very high, and although it doesn't wallop you on the tongue, the alcohol is there and makes this more of a sipping/nursing beer. The bottle suggests that maybe this *is* your dessert, and it's certainly both filling and sweet enough to fit the bill."
"This poured a clear, nearly black mahogany with a bit of tan head. It smelled like creamy milk chocolate with fresh roasted coffee, and a bit of muted barley and salty yeast. It tasted like lots of milk chocolate with roasted coffee, and a bit of toasted oats and copper. It was somewhat thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter coffee aftertaste. Overall this was a very nice, clean tasting stout. It had nice body (although I was personally hoping for a bit more) and it hid the alcohol very well, so it was very easy to drink. As much as other Southern Tier's big beers might be gimmicks, I think this one is actually a very well-rounded double stout that I would consider drinking (somewhat) regularly. It also seemed like age would make this beer even sweeter and smoother, as the coffee's bitterness fades. Great beer."
"This beer certainly is interesting, and the chocolate and coffee flavors are done really well, but I found even a bomber was a bit hard to drink because it is so sweet."
"It's actually better as a crossbreed than either of its two parent beers are individually."
"More of a sipper, but the lighter body makes it a little easier to drink. One or two is about the max on this. A really nice RIS. Makes me want to try the Choklat version."
"A: Dark black to ebony colored beer, only a hint of light passes at the edge of the glass, mildly frothy head, some visible viscosity to the beer, there are minor patches of stick foam along the edges - 4.25, S: The chocolate and coffee that are mentioned on the label dominate the nose, there is a powdery sweetness that reminds me of Nestle Quik, slightly herbal - 4.50, T: A thick syrupy sweetness to the beer, alcohol is noticeable but considering that it is 11.0% it is remarkably well hidden, as expected chocolate and espresso command the palate, some pitted fruit flavors such as plums and possibly peach, a touch of raisin and vanilla is also noticeable, an exceptional beer - 4.50, M: Extremely creamy and thick - 4.25, D: Very drinkable even at the high alcohol content, rivals their Chokolat Stout beer, complex and a beer that I would unquestionably drink again - 4.50"
"Notes: This is a huge beer with big bold flavor and hefty 11%abv."
"Poured a deep rich chocolate, barely a head, leaving fine lacing. Nose of chocolate, chocolate, chocolate! Mouthfeel alcohol and light, the ABV comes in at 11% and is very obvious. Easy drinkability, but the high alcohol content makes deters from drinking to quench the thirst. There is a slight hint of coffee, and a creamy sweetness to the aftertaste. Another smooth, great tasting brew from the folks at Southern Tier."
"Overall I'm glad I tried this beer, but no way it would or could be a regular drinker for me, it's just over the top. I like what they are doing, but these massive sweet beers are very limited in when and how you drink them."
"Very nice, one finger, tan head that slowly recedes to nothing. Very dark molasses brown with some molasses-like viscocity. Some black char colors, and no bubbling. Creamy caraml atop a sweet coffee and chocolate treat. Vanilla and milk chocolate with some gourmet, medium roast coffee aromas. Starts with a Starbucks coffee liquer blended well with milk and dark chocolate. The palate feels liquer warm yet sweet. While the finish is a combo of both the dark chocolate and roasted coffee bitterness. Very slow and soothig finish. Great warming and flavorful sipper."
"Similar to the Creme Brulee, this is a 22 oz and done beer for me. It is so sweet and rich that it's good as a dessert beverage, but a night of drinking the Mokah would be a bit much for me. Plus, at 11% ABV this is a sipper, but that's OK since there is enough alcohol to feel the effects of a slowly nursed beer. Overall this was an after dinner treat that I would love to try on draft. I can't wait to pull more Southern Tier off the shelf."
"Overall, not bad but a letdown from my first experience with the beer. Found this to come across as a fairly harsh blend the second time through and would prefer to have either the Jahva or the Choklat instead on its own as a result."
"Overall: Worse than Choklat, but better than Jahva. A must try. Cheers!"
"Drinkability - Very rich and filling. 3"
"The beer is Dark brown and opaque, just a hint of ruby-colored light gets through at the edges, relatively thin tan foam (several millimeters at most). The main aroma is chocolate, it smells like a chocolate shake. The taste is sweet, chocolate and malt, not much coffee to speak of but maybe in the slight bitter feel at the end of each sip. Too sweet to be sessionable, this is a dessert beer. The thick body adds to the impression of an alcoholic chocolate malt, really tasty and memorable. One is more than enough, the sweetness gets old before the bottle is empty."
"Overall, A super sweet chocolatey stout. Not necessarily for me, but something new and different. Was very good, but for a bomber it was pretty cloying sweetness by the end. Good in moderation, but can be somewhat overpowering."
"A little overdone for me, beware of its richness. Something just didn't sit right and it made me (and my Dad) feel sick from the sweetness, but we will see next time I can grab one."
"Black brew with a small tan head that faded quickly. Aromas are all chocolate milk, momentarily taking me back to my nesquick days. Flavors are huge chocolate and some unbelievably pronounced dark berries. The vanilla melds nicely with the chocolate, and a mint flavor pulls through with a bit of warmth. Wow...like mint chocolate chip ice cream! Viscuous mouthfeel. This is a really wonderful brew. One that deserves sipping with undivided attention, and maybe a brownie."
"A fine choice though it may be my least favorite of the Blackwater stouts. I'd say if you like Jah-va, you'll like this one as well."
"Conclusion: A different animal than on tap; I actually think I like the bottled version better...great dessert beer, served this one with dark Belgian chocolate with espresso beans"
"I've been missing ST's Choklat since I first had it in New York a year and a half ago and the Mokah fulfilled my desire for some chocolaty goodness from Southern Tier. A very enjoyable beer."
"D - This is a great beer. ST is really hit or miss for me and this beer was a big hit. I will be buying some bottles of this soon..."
"Had this one on tap before so I ended up picking up a bottle of it the other day. From the bomber to a pint glass pours a black color (with very little ruby highlights when held up to the light) with a small light tan colored head that quickly goes to just a small ring. Leaves little to no lacing down the glass. The smell right away is mainly chocolate with some coffee. Mainly it's just the chocolate and a very sweet smelling chocolate. There is something else sweet in there too, vanilla or caramel? Either way the smell is very sweet and nice. Taste is the same. From the name I was expecting more coffee upfront but it's almost all chocolate with a hint of coffee in there. Delicious to say the least. The alcohol is hidden rather well and with a higher ABV it could be dangerous! I'll have no problem finishing this bomber though and I'll enjoy every drop. Overall an excellent beer. Both on tap and in bottle, I'm going to grab a few more of these next time I'm on a beer run."
"Drinks a touch slow between the ABV & heft. I am loving this for what it is, not for everyone I'm sure, but in my wheelhouse! Maybe my ultimate dessert/breakfast beer??? Nah, but close"
"Overall, a good beer, and I might have to pick up another one, to age for awhile."
"This beer poured a thick, deep, opaque dark brown, boardering on black color. A thin 1/2 finger tan head formed on top that didn't last, spots of wispy lacing left. Nose is much richer on tap than from the bottle - more pronounced notes of rich blegian chocolate with a touch of coffee filtering its way in, notes of dark malts can also be picked up. The taste is of sweet belgian chocolate up front, moving in to some the darker, more roasted malts, and finishing out with coffee notes - subtle yet very present. Alchol content is extremely well hidden. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy actually almost a velvety feel, full/heavy bodied, very light carbonation. This is one of my favorite offerings from Southern Tier and is even better on tap than bottled."
"Awesome."
"Pours a solid black with a thinnish tan head that dissipates quickly. Smells of chocolate syrup, alcohol, coffee, toffee, and caramel. Taste is of chocolate syrup, toffee, caramel. Lots of sweetness in this one. A little alcohol burn mid to end with a lingering alcohol and bitter hop finish. Thick body, chewy with a bit of a syrupy feel. Low carbonation. This is not my favorite from the black water series, but certainly drinkable. I would put this one in the same realm as the creme brulee to be enjoyed as a desert beer."
"Highly Recommended."
"Delicious beer that is far too drinkable. While drinking a beer which comes in a bomber you are usually not looking for something sessionable, this in no exception. Enjoyable and easy to drink from beginning to end."
"I'll certainly look to put this on tap at home once the cold season comes around."
"Alcohol is somewhat noticable. Medium body. Not as full and creamy as some of the others in this series. Fair amount of residual sweetness. Overall, solid, but not quite what I hoped for. Maybe a bit more of the Javah would have done well."
"D-I enjoyed this brew for desert (as recommended on the labe), and it was superb. Thick and indulgent, I think it's a great brew, though as a rare treat."
"Drinkability: My comment above about re: how long it's been since I have a Southern Tier beer ring true on some level, and I think that level is as follows: these are well-made, innovative craft beer, but they are not friendly, drinkable, everyday beers. These are not the kind of beers you find yourself populating your fridge with, whether its the Choklat (delicious, as an occasional treat), the Jahva (a little less delicious, as an occasional treat), the Mocha (see above), or, um, the Creme Brulee (ummmm ...). And at 11%, you can't really afford to, to be honest. That being said, yes, wonderful beer, slightly more ""originally"" authentic in its melding than either the Jahva or the Choklat singularly, but still a little on the ""faux"" side of the line, a little boozy, and a little decadent. Definitely worth trying once."
"(PS if you do not enjoy sweet beers avoid this one!!)"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" dark tan head over the clear, barely translucent dark brown brew. Heads recedes gradually, ample legs, and and slow-falling lace. Aroma is deeply of chocolate and alcohol, reminds me of a boozy chocolate Tootsie pop. Taste mirrors the aroma, this is a good thing, alcohol aftertaste may be a touch harsh. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, and drinkability is good as well. A tasty treat."
"D: At 11%, this one is a challenge to get through, especially on a July afternoon (I'm not holding ST accountable for the weather in my score). A bold stout no matter how you slice it."
"wife, friends, and guests."
"D- pretty good drinkability for 11%. recommend this to any chocolate or cream stout lover that maybe want something a little bigger."
"Na Zdravje!"
"D and overall impression: I can't even tell this is a 11% beer. It is a dessert beer, and if you're in the mood for it, the drinkability is huge. This is the third blackwater offering I've had, and it's my favorite. This is a dangerous brew, drink this one in place of dessert, it'll do the trick. Skal."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle shared with psycohops. Poured into a pair of shaker glasses. Mokah appears a deep dark brown color with about an inch of fluffy ecru foam. Not really getting much coffee notes here. Mostly that sweet tootsie roll smell and flavor that is so very prevalent in Choklat. Milk chocolate, and sweet caramel dominate the flavor and aroma. Medium to full bodied with adequate carbonation. Not too shabby, but I was all smiles when my glass was empty so I could move on to something else."
"D: Downgraded here because of the price and the let-down. I will try to progenitors and see if one or both of them surpass this combo-brew. Not bad by any means, but many better beers can be had at this price point."
"D - Southern Tier does it again with an incredible Imperial Stout that's off the charts. I don't know how they do it, but virtually anything they put in a bomber is liquid gold, and this is no exception. While this is eerily reminiscent of Choklat, this is nevertheless a fabulous brew in its own right."
"D: I prefer the parts greater than the sum. If you want this beer hold on to choklat and jahva for a year and you will get the best part of this beer."
"Quite good. High marks for uniqueness (different from other RIS's). Definitely recommended. Bought my bottle at Blacklick Liquors in Columbus."
"NOTE: this beer opens up a lot more as it warms and becomes slightly better"
"Jah-Vah plus Choklat equals Mokah...at least in Southern Tier's beery little world. Poured on tap at Trivia Pub in moon, thanks god only a 10-12 oz pour. Tasty dessert beer that really hits you with the Hershey's sweet chocolate syrup with a touch of toffee. Pitch black pour with a deep toffee colored brown head, minimal scattered lace with the booze well hidden among the chocolate candy sweetness. Flavor is great but the roasted coffee beans were overshadowed by the layers of chocolate I already descrbed. I'm glad I tried this, mouthfeel was thick and syrupy with moderated slow bubbling carbonation pretty much chewy in nature. Drinkability overall is great in moderation, one of those beers that are great when you get a sweet tooth but not for my everyday imbibing. I had Choklat and JahVah in the past my heart lies with the Jahvah."
"A little of Southern Tier Mokah goes a long way as the chocolate and coffee flavors dominate, rather than compliment, the ""beer," which gets completely lost. A bomber of this wouldn't be bad split among four people with dessert, but it's too much for one person. After a while, it smells and tastes like cheap chocolate candy."
"Poured a quickly disipating tan head on top of a murky black body. The aroma first strikes me as chocolatey, although not overpowering. You can still discern different malts like coffee, roasted, toasted, and hints of caramel and/or toffee but make no mistake - the cocoa malts are what really drive the beer. Smooth, creamy, slightly chewey although mostly a medium body, this is an easy to drink stout that is rather sweet with only a minor dry backbite for a rather clean, coffee-esque finish. The body is mostly sweet and mostly chocolate, so while not sweet like a milk/sweet stout be prepared for some sweetness; gets smoother and a little dryer on backend as it warms but the ABV is hidden for the most part."
"D: Not bad and I really have to say as far as all the Souther Tier dessert beers that I have had, this one was the easiest to drink. Sure it is a sweet beer and has some wieght, but its not as cloying as Creme Brulee or Choklat was. Plus it doesn't sit as rich and sweet as the others tend to do as well. It works nicely in most categories. Sure it could be a bit more cohesive in that ""mocha"" flavor but it is still nice. Needs work on the look as well. Still another good beer from ST and it really hit the spot when my lady and I were in the mood for a sweeter brew. Dig it."
"Crème Brulee 1, Mokah 2, Chokolat 3"
"Drinkability: Moderate at best - the alcohol is pretty high and hot, the beer is pretty heavy - almost a meal unto itself. Would make an excellent desert or accompaniment to one."
"D - I'm glad I shared this to top off a good dinner...great for sipping and dessert...now I just have to try Choklat and Jahva"
"Again, a great brew for dessert on its own."
"After trying the Chokolat, I had no qualms about picking this one. Just as succulant, irresistable, and delecident as the ultimate chocolate beer that preceeds this version. Blended with the coffee-ee goodness of Jav-ha, and the richness, depth, and boldness is taken up a knotch. Light espresso notes are the perfect companion to the chocolate character. Where the Chokolat is more chocolatey, this beer gives more complexity and depth. An absolutely outstanding taste. Heavy textured with very little carbonation makes the beer heavy on the palate and becomes a bit lifeless in the end. Some would call this a good desert beer; I say it is the desert all into itself."
"Really nice! A stunning dessert beer!"
"D- this stuff is some sweet sippin nectar I'm greatly enjoying just slowly rolling through this bottle on this father's day afternoon."
"Drinkability: Definitely a sipper, because it's so sweet, rich, and thick. I really didn't get any coffee flavor out of this - to me, this tasted like a watered-down version of Choklat, but just a rich and sweet (if that makes sense). It's definitely best to split the bomber - almost impossible to finish one of these by yourself."
"Easy drinking and enjoyable but way over the top with the chocolate coffee taste."
"I bought this one at Charleston Beer Exchange last week for $9 a bomber. I've had Choklat and Jah-va in the past, and I was excited to try this blend. The bottle pours a deep, dark, ultra-brown color with a tiny ring of head. As far as appearances go, this looks more like a really dark brown ale than an imposing imperial stout. The aroma brings back memories of Choklat with its dominating, heavy, candybar, chocolate character. I don't detect the Jah-va in the aroma. The taste backs up the aroma. It's definitely sweet chocolate up front, and it then turns a bit drier in the finish. The change in the finish might be the Jah-va trying to come through, but it's hard to detect. The yummy chocolate flavor totally dominates in this brew. I'd like to say that the coffee flavor is a solid back-up to the chocolate, but it's very hard to find here. This doesn't surprise me since Choklat is probably the ""most-all-around chocolaty"" beer I've ever encountered, while Jah-va was only mildly coffee flavored. Do I like this beer? Yes...but, this beer is all about the Choklat portion of the blend, and it seems the Jah-va got lost somewhere along the way. It's too bad ST couldn't squeeze a stronger coffee character into this brew. Whatever the case, this is still a good brew and one that is probably most appropriate as a dessert."
"HV"
"Deep black in color. Not much head to speak of. Muted aroma of coffee and chocolate-somewhat sweetish smelling-almost a caramel/vanilla highlite. Just a great big chocolate flavor upfront though it doesnt blow you away. Well balanced against a very mild coffe flavor. Great lingering sweetness of vanilla and cream. Some roastedness to it. Great body-velvety smooth. Just a great beer flavor and drinkability wise. Not as sweet as some of the beers that are similar to this. great job."
"Yum, mmm!"
"Flavor follows aroma and is all about well-balanced chocolate. Other than a touch of roasted finish, this one is all about chocolate."
"drinkability: wish it was easier - way too boozy, too rich and sweet. not impressive"
"Wow! I was expecting over-the-top chocolate in a too-alcoholic imperial stout. Boy was I wrong! This stout definitely packs a wallop at 11%, but it does not overwhelm. Nor does the chocolate. The flavor is upfront and definitely present, but it is still extremely drinkable. Save this one as a stand-alone or as a dessert complement."
"In the mouth, again, chocolate, smooth and sweet all the way. It IS the perfect thickness for the flavor profile. Can't drink it fast, but it's pretty delicious as a rich indulgence."
"Definitely something to be sipped relatively slowly, but not as revoltingly sweet as it easily could have been. The balance makes it quite drinkable, though the richness will easily prevent me from wanting another any time soon."
"22oz. bottle appropriately served in my ST tulip at the recommended 48 degrees. Poured the color of cola with a half inch khaki-colored head; frothy, but not dense. Cap eventually recedes into a tight band around the perimeter of the glass; some slashes and spots of lacing are revealed as the brew is consumed. Great nose - chocolate, coffee, dark fruity esters and caramel. Chocolate takes the forefront in the flavor department, albeit it comes off a little chalky. Some acidity is revealed towards the back. Not getting much of the coffee and caramel in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is somewhat on the thin side for the style; really just shy of medium-bodied, but lacking the viscosity or chewiness of an American Double IS. Alcohol is extremely well-hidden on this one; just a feint suggestion of heat at the very back of the throat. As such, this brew goes down pretty easy. IMO, not as good as Jahva, but better than Choklat. Nonetheless, a solid big beer from ST."
"Bottle. Pours black with hardly any head. Aroma of a brownie sundae--rich chocolate fudge, Hershey's syrup, and even some peanut butter chocolate notes. Better aroma than Choklat? I think so! Flavor is chock full of peanut butter chocolate and rich chocolatey malt. Definitely more like Choklat than Jahva. The weakness in this beer is its palate--this is a rich, sweet, and somewhat cloying beer. A pint is fairly drinkable, but I wouldn't combat more than that. Alcohol isn't present in the flavor, but this does start to get to you after a bit! Very tasty! Better than the last Choklat I had for sure."
"To make my usual musical references, think of this as blue grass legend Earl Scruggs. It may be one of the very best of the genre, but I readily admit, it is not for everyone."
"It was served with a finger of mocha-brown head with good retention. The nose was like an Arby's Jamocha milkshake - heavy on the chocolate, underlain with coffee. The color was a Stygian black. The mouthfeel was thick, full, and chewy. It really was like a milkshake, but a quality one, not one of those watery messes that they foist on us now. Lots and lots of dark, rich chocolate on the tongue. Man, I hovered on the brink of diabetes with each sip. The finish was equally intensely sweet. As a hophead, this would not normally be my first choice, but in this case, it was a rare opportunity on draft."
"D: This is dessert reincarnated as a beer. I would drink these all day if it weren't for the ABV."
"In terms of flavor, this beer is second to few. It is absolutely delicious, with the only downside being that it is a touch syrupy which keeps the drinkability in check. Likely a good thing, otherwise I would breeze through this bomber way too quickly. This is an amazing beer though. A must try if you like the style (and even if you don't). Have it after dinner on a cool night and relax."
"Pours quite dark with hints of rusted mahogany. Tan head thins rather quickly. Delcious nose has rich fudge, coffee, fruity malts, bitter molasses and subtle hops. Taste is also powered by the chocolate but perfectly balanced by the bitter coffee flavors and black molasses. More big malts, a tinge of booze and quiet hops through the finish. Thick, creamy body, but the carbonation was a bit rough. This 22oz bottle drank way too easy for 11%."
"This is a standout beer."
"drinkability is nice. as mentioned above, the alcohol is very present in this one, warming every part of your mouth on the sip and spreading through the rest of your chest following. i think this, like the gemini, just isn't as good as the beers that went into it. still, it's got some pretty big shoes to fill and remains darn tasty anyway."
"Pours a deep dark black, very oily looking, thick tan head forms, quickly settles down to a thin layer and ring around the glass, disappears rather fast, some lace spots, looks good. Smell is neat, really intense, like chocolate covered banana bread, biscuity, chocolate, coffee roast, lots of caramel, touch of vanilla, raisins and dark fruit, milky, pretty nice. Taste is nice, like chocolate milk, really rich, light coffee roast but not as intense as the aroma, some banana and fruitiness, strawberries, some alcohol, caramel and brown sugar, lightly toasty, pretty nice. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, pretty smooth, some warmth from the alcohol, pretty nice stuff. Thanks Jenn!"
"The beer pours a dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a sweet, chocolate scent that's right in line with the style. The taste is great! It has a smooth chocolate flavor with a nice complimentary coffee taste. This is a damn nice dessert beer. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tremendous beer. It's a bit on the sweeter side, but I'm a huge fan."
"this beer pours a deep black with only a bit of highlights when backlit, the tan head recedes to a thin sheet. the aroma is right on with the chocolate right up front and the coffee hiding in the back with the roasted malt. the taste delivers the chocolate with surprising results, the bit of hop bitterness really sets off the sweetness. the full body and good co2 really make this far too drinkable to for an eleven percenter."
"Rich dark color but not much head. Great aroma coming of this one. Very chocolaty smell and something slightly fruity. Could catch a whiff of malt as well. Immediately tasted big chocolate flavors and a little coffee. Was there a little cherry taste in their too? It's not overly sweet which is a plus in my book. It also had more body than I thought it would, which is also a plus. Nicely done but as rich as it is it would be hard to drink more than one at a session. I will seek this beer out again."
"I still wonder about the appearance of this beer, and wonder if the bar was getting near the end of the keg. However, it certainly tasted as if it were fine (and relatively fresh), so who knows. However, will revisit this beer soon and see if it appears the same as it did last night at the Bench. I may need to revise my appearance score."
"There really wasn't any question that Mokah would be impressive beer. I mean, how can one go wrong with a mix of Choklat and Jahva? The only question (for me) was, how impressive will it be? That's a tough call. It's extremely good beer, but it falls just a little short of both. But, not by much at all. The coffee aspect is notable here, but isn't all that strong. Non-coffee folks shouldn't be intimidated by this one. If it were a little stronger, it might improve a little overall. Who knows? Maybe not. Having said that, it's still great beer with a lot of great flavor. I like it a lot. The hoppy twist on the flavor is really nice and appealing. I have no reservation recommending this one. It's another gem in Southern Tier's Black Water Series."
"D - I split this bottle with a friend and we both agreed that this would be incredible with a nice dessert such as tiramisu or rich chocolate cake. Definitely not a 'lawnmower' beer. Like all of the other Southern Tier products, this is worth a try."
"this is a very very sweet bomb of a brew. don't ask how, but i did have two in one sitting. and i was rather goofy feeling afterwards. like a kid who had too many milkshakes. one should have been enough, but i wanted to catch that aroma and flavor again."
"Feels fairly light for how big this beer is, just a little bit slick. In my mind this one is better than the Choklat, as far as drinkability, but probably still best consumed with vanilla ice cream and a spoon."
"A very nice treat."
"Smell is some roasted coffee, a little chocolate and a good amount of creme brulee. Wasn't really expecting that much vanilla, but it's there. And it's even more prevalent in the taste. Just enough chocolate and a small amount of coffee to reel it in. Much easier to drink and quite enjoyable. This isn't cloying or tiring to drink. There's no sign of the alcohol at all. Decent beer."
"Pours a near black color with a small tight light brown head that quickly settles into a light ring. The aroma is very similar to the Choklat; brownie batter all around, nice chocolate aroma, some alcohol vapors in the end. Nice sweet and bitter chocolate flavor up front, not as sweet as the Choklat. Noticable roasted coffee flavors are present but clearly take a backseat to the chocolate. There is a bit of a metallic taste to it and a fusel alcohol presense. The body is thick and chewy but with prickly carbonation; finishes mostly sweet with some roasted bitterness. The alcohol presense is pretty raw, could use some aging. An ""Irish Twin"" to the Choklat as they are not that far apart. The brew could be a bit smoother and the ABV needs to mellow. Once that happens, this is one good brew; more balanced than the Choklat."
"Drinkability- Overall not bad. Its certainty not as good Choklat or OAT but it's a bit better than Jahva and Crème Brulee (especially the later). Southern Tier defintily gets creative with these beers and they are a fun novelty. Definitely worth the try."
"Mokah pours just like a good Imperial Stout, super thick and hearty. Not much in the way of livelyness or carbonation, though. Smell is absolutely fantastic. Just like Hershey's chocolate syrup, and that is also exactly what it tastes like. Sweet Hershey's syrup. It has a bit of slightly bitter kick at the end that goes away as it warms. I found that the Javah tempers the bitterness of the chocolate from Choklat, it tastes more milk chocolate than semi-sweet. Definitely makes for a far more enjoyable beer. Mouthfeel again is a little dead, I know this is the kind of beer that works with less carbonation, just lacks that ""killer instinct"" zing to it. Amazingly drinkable though, the perfect desert beer (and a damn good regular beer too, if you really like chocolate). Now, I was really underwhelmed by Javah, and thought Choklat was just a pretty good beer. This one is definitely more than the sum of its parts."
"D: This is a great dessert beer. An 11% ABV makes this a long sipping beer. I could have two in a sitting but no more."
"D: Not too bad. Could definitely finish a bomber no problem. Would want it at the end of a session however."
"My only complaint would be the dominance of the chocolate and my desire for my coffee flavor."
"M + D: The big alcohol of both brews is hidden under the intense flavours. Very slow going, as it can become a little too intense if it is consumed in any sort of rush. The more it warms, the more the sensation of alcohol will be noticed. Big, thick, and syrupy, paired with a modest carbonation that suits the style. This one might be a little on the cloying side for my palate. Like the Creme Brulee, it is something I would probably enjoy much more in good company than alone."
"Pours an opaque darkness with full finger foamy dark tan head that fades slowly leaving spotty patterns of Belgian lacing behind. The smell is aggressive and classic Tootsie Roll and rich gooey chocolate brownie. Full bodied, the mouth feel is heavy and creamy. A slight effervescence and tang from the 11% ABV on the tongue keeps things alive. Full flavored, sweet rich brownie chocolate taste that finishes with the coffee notes and with chalky malted Necco wafer texture. A really nice sipper. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The mouthfeel is almost full bodied. I am like Mix-Alot I like em round and big. The carbonation is low but works well. Drinkabililty is really good. I couldnt believe how fast the beer left my glass. This is a dam near perfect effort."
"Taste was almost irresistible. $16.99 for 64 ounces(plus glass)... err. Better then $9 for a bottle, but still something I just can't do much of. ...I remember when UnEarthly was $5.49."
"D: Quite tasty. Better than java or choklat. Yet, one glass is enough for satiation."
"While this is a very enjoyable beer, its strength and thickness make it a slow sipper."
"I split this with a couple friends and really wish I hoarded the whole bottle to myself. It was super easy to drink even at the high abv."
"Overall, I actually prefer Jah-va and Choklat, indepedently, to this brew. That being said, it's still a pretty darn good brew. Worth checking out."
"D - ABV is well hidden. Makes for a nice after dinner sipper for dessert."
"According to the bottle it's a combination of Choklat and Java, and I think the sum is more than the parts, this really is an incredible combination of flavors and one of the most unusual and satisfying brews I've had. Well worth the price and this would make an incredible desert."
"D - Not the most drinkable but high on flavor a bit too sweet w/ less actual mocha taste - too little java taste. It is a real dessert, a rich beer best shared at 11%. I would probably prefer 10oz or less and would like it in cooler weather"
"Bomber bottle, pours darkest shades of brown, with some ruby hues shining through, the head is dark tan, better the average reteniona dn leaving some spotty stickage. Nose is boldly of the advertized coffee and chocolate. Thick on the tongue, bold on the flavors, high on the quality department. Loads of coffee and over the top chocolate notes. Tasty sipper. More fine brew from ST. World class dessert beer, IMHO."
"22 oz. Almost black, brown pour. Small tan head that disappeared completely. Heavy dark chocolate, mocha and light roast malt and coffee aroma. Taste does match, quite a bit of chocolate and mocha with accenting roast malt and espresso. Medium, somewhat milky body, but just enough carbonation to keep it honest. Finishes like a mocha Starbucks drink. A little sweet, but not quite as overwhelmingly chocolate as the Choklat. A little better drinkability than the chocolate milk like Choklat. Still like the Java and Oat better though."
"An outstanding achievement."
"D: As far as I can tell, this is pretty much indistinguishable from Choklat. And the parts that are different are worse. I don't really see the point of this."
"D- As I get older, I find myself to drink less and less in the blackwater series because it's just too much. I love Southern tier's desert beers, but only in about 5oz samples in a sitting. As for Mokah, it's a great beer but in the future i'll just pick between the two base beers and share amongst friends."
"D: Served in a pint, I wish it was in imperial pint."
"D: I thought it was drinkable, but I like all the other really strong flavored Southern Tier Beers. I finished the bomber and was sad it was done."
"Poured into a pint glass. 3 finger head and smells like chocolate pudding for sure. Some roasted coffee notes coming through as well. Taste is great and feels like I am drinking dessert. Mouthfeel is a little on the heavy side and this is definitely not a super easy drinking beer. Great for dessert and I would def. try it again."
"D= This was a big disappointment for me. I usually like Southern Tier a lot and have enjoyed many of their more adventurous brews. This one really fell flat for me."
"It's a little sweet for me but still a nice treat every once in a while."
"drinkability - you would have to be a sweets lover to drink more then one of these or even the whole bomber(i split this one) - and its not a beer i would want more then once every few months or so"
"A rich chocolate/coffee dessert that has an easy drinkability for its richness and abv."
"Pours a dark brownish black color with a thin tan head into a tulip glass. Good retention and some lacing. Smells of chocolate, tootsie rolls, caramel, and cream. Tastes of milk chocolate, caramel, cream, dark chocolate bits, and tootsie rolls with a touch of roasted malt and a bit of coffee in the finish. Medium-full body with low carbonation but a nice pop. Smooth and sweet. Amazingly easy to drink and hides its alcohol very well. A little too high in ABV and sweet for me to want to session this, but it is a real nice treat!"
"I drank a bomber of this without a problem. Granted, it lasted me all night, but this is an excellent beer."
"I'm not sure that this is a double stout. I'd probably put it more in the sweet stout category. And I'd make it my favorite sweet stout. Maybe Imperial Sweet Stout?"
"D - Pretty good beer."
"Dark brown pour, almost black, small tan head that was gone quickly leaving no lacing. Aroma is full of chocolate. Tootsie roll chocolate to be exact. Pretty much smells exactly like ST's Choklat. No coffee can really be found in the nose. Big time chocolate flavor on this one. I'm still having trouble distinguishing this one from Choklat. I suppose there is a light smattering of coffee in the background, but the thick luscious chocolate flavor pretty much washing everything else out. A nice roastiness is also present, but this is a chocolate dessert drink like no other. Mouthfeel is medium-high, average carbonation. Alcohol is very well hidden in the taste, but a warming can be felt on the way down. Really, I can't say it enough, this pretty much tastes just like Choklat with only a little bit of coffee mixed in. Not bad, but really nothing new it seems. It really does taste great and I think some age would do wonders for this brew."
"I can't comprehend how people could hate this beer. Yes, I think Jahva and Choklat are better on their own, however, this beer is easily in the top Tier of Imperial Stouts. Might need some aging to mellow out the alcohol burn, but a wonderful treat for all."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. The aroma is nice and sweet. I mostly smell chocolate, but with a bit of roasted malt and coffee noticable. Taste is pretty much like the aroma. The strongest flavor is of milk and bittersweet chocolate, with some roasted malt and coffee in there too. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and coating. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and easy to drink (well, if you like sweeter tasting beers like this one). The 11% ABV isn't very noticable at first, but it does catch up to you after a while. It's a pretty good beer, I liked it a lot."
"Upon opening the first thing to notice is the aroma right out of the bottle.. it is amazingly chocolatey with smaller hints of espresso. Like coffee-ice cream with chocolate syrup or chocolate rootbeer float.. Pour isnt as viscous as would be expected/wanted, its not really a solid dark color and the head is a dark tan/light brown. Also its fizzier than expected. Taste is quite sweet, like chocolate-covered espresso beans with slight bitterness like black chocolate or coffee.. theres also a chocolate syrup-like element. As it warms and opens up it tastes like a chocolate-flavored candy or such, like a chocolate dum dum lollipop and this becomes less appealing. Mouth, again, is much lighter than expected, but its still full-bodied. Carbonation is a good medium level. Its certainly quite delicious if you enjoy sweet stuff, not as heavy as I'd like for a stout. If you're not into sweets it may become a bit much, I didn't even finish the entire bomber. The chocolate flavor becomes almost artificial tasting around the last few ounces. Still very interesting, though.."
"A very sweet beer, but not too rich like some of the other ones. The bitter Belgian chocolate seems to go better with the characteristics of an RIS better than regular chocolate. Recommended."
"poured from a bottle"
"We both agreed that this beer kinda blew. It was very hard to drink and we struggled to finish the bomber between the two of us. It ended in a chug just so we wouldn't waste it. Very disappointing."
"Besides tasting overly of Choklat, the actual flavor of this beer is flooringly tasty. There was even less of an alcohol presence in this than I expected given 11% abv. This goes down smoooth."
"I've never tried chokolat, but I have tried jahva and I think jahva is much more enjoyable. I did like this and was glad I tried it, but it had too many distractions along the way."
"Bottle #5, dessert. Had to grab this one for the chocolate pie ending. Pours almost completely black but illuminated by the tan head. I wanted to see if this smelled and tasted more like jahva or choklat... Choklat clearly winning on the nose, so rich! The palate follows gracefully without being cloying or overbearing. The flavors are rich, and for somethat tried it that night, too much chocolate. Balanced in my opinion, and went very well with the dessert."
"Overall: It is a very good beer, the only turn off for some might be the large chocolate presence."
"Feels pretty thin which is my biggest complaint. A stout this tasty should be dense and heavy. It's not so easy to drink either, it would be hard to finish a bomber by yourself."
"D: Overall, this is a drinkable beer. It might not be for everyone, but it is well made and tasty."
"Overall: Mouthfeel is pretty good it's very well carbonated however a little thinner than I would have expected, although 27 plato, it doesn't feel like it. Very drinkable however, this bottle is not problem. Not worth the premium ST price, I'd rather get choklat"
"Full and rich mouthfeel. Decent drinkability, but could use more balance and bitterness. Too similar to Choklat IMO."
"I just didn't get a lot of tastes, especially the coffee, in this bottle. It reminds me more of Choklat than Jahva. While I love chocolate and sweetness there's a little too much of both, personally, for me. One glass on tap at a bar would've suited me better."
"Some may accuse me for hating on ST, but I like their beers. Somehow as mentioned before, I have 1 or 2 of things like this and don't go back to them. The only ones I come back to the trough for are oat and pumking. And I liked creme brulee. This is good but it seems too much like a gimmick from a marketing sense. Guys, it's time to stop the pump & dump and stick to making good quality beers that people come back to time after time instead of hoping that every beer obsessive picks up only a couple bombers of each every season. Loyalty will be rewarding in the long run. And Cuvee #3 better be damn good, by the way..."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with a big maltiness. Goes down rather easily while being a bit on the sweet side. Overall, a damn fine blend here that shows of the tasty nuances of both beers. Yummy stuff that would be great made into a shake!!"
"Drinkability: this is one of the most drinkable beers I have had at this alcohol level. Easy to quaff and numerous glasses could be had over a session but it will hit you eventually. Great beer."
"Poured a dark, and deep brown (bording on dark black, but I could see brown when I held it up directly in front of the light), with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of milk chocolate (as with the Choklat, it reminded me of walking into a small chocolate shop), caramel, lighter coffee, and vanilla. Tastes of coffee, chocolate, caramel, and some dark fruits. Light to medium alcohol in the finish. I had some chocolate brownies before this which put me in the mood to have this one. Definitely a dessert sipper."
"Overall very good and just what I expected it would be like. I love the tow originals so this was a natural progression. I would buy this again."
"STBC line-up of Blackwater Imperial Stouts series."
"Another creatively yummy brew from Southern Tier! If ya like Choklat: this will be its twin!"
"Mouthfeel is heavy and smooth with a bit of carbonation."
"D--This bomber is disappearing too quickly. I can't believe that this is 11% ABV, it drinks almost like a session stout. Great beer from Southern Tier"
"D- i cant find anything about how equal the blending is, but if id have to guess id say more choklat than jahva. thats not a problem as far as im concerned. my glass pretty much drank itself and left me wanting more. the only thing making this drinkability not perfect is the massive ABV. another bomber of this would make for a very bad next day. check this one out if given the chance."
"D - This is so delicious it that 11% ABV doesn't mean anything with how delicious this was. Extremely drinkable. One of my favorite American Doubles."
"Nice idea. I like it."
"Mouth is thick and viscous, any thicker and it would have chunks. Drinks slow but is a damn fine treat from Southern Tier. Damn you Kevin for making me finish this alone!"
"good drinkability, even for an imperial stout."
"Smooth and easy to drink I would recomend at the very least spilting it with 1 person if not more, its real sweet and heavy. I have come to expect nothing less thank things like this from Southern tier."
"22oz. bomber served in a snifter. Poured a dark brown/black with a sparse tan head. Lots of coffee and chocolate in the aroma, also some caramel. Full bodied and rich. Flavor is more of the same. I found the coffee to be very bitter, and the chocolate to have a bittersweet quality as well. Long dry finish of chocolate and coffee. Some alcohol also present. There is a bit of hop bitterness. I find Southern Tier to be very hit of miss. I either really like it or not. This one is a miss for me."
"While not something I will be guzzling in the summer months, I will definitely pick up some more of this for when it gets cold. Between this brew and their barleywine, Southern Tier has persuaded me to try every one of their offerings. Everything I've tried from them has been well-crafted and is of high quality, and this beer is no exception"
"Pours complete darkness into a snifter with nice 2 finger dark brown head. Smells like chocolate syrup with some twangy alcohol scents. Taste is in your face kick you in the pallet chocolate followed by a nice roasted coffee bitterness. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth, thick, and oily with little carbonation. Alcohol can be felt warming your guts while this oil slick makes it's way to your stomach so I'm going with a 4. Very tasty brew. Play on ST. Phin, Paul, and Jared, nice job!!!"
