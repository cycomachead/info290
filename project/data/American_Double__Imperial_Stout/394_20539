I found this to be a little stingy and harsh.  I got a fizzy head on the pour and the aroma of dark fruits.   The taste also was very strong and fruity almost?

It gets a little better as it warms and could be rated higher when room temperature. I think some age would tone down the oat presence and bitterness. Still a solid beer as my first offering from Stoudts.","Bone53","Oct 09, 2014"

Stoudt's has really knocked it out of the park with Fat Dog.

The body is just a tad, I mean a tiny bit, light, which is a blessing if you want to drink 2 or 3 of these puppies! The flavours are interestingly complex and evolve as the beer warms.

The beer smells of dark roasted malt with some hints of coffee. I also pick up some alcohol. The flavor is of dark roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, oatmeal, toffee, and a touch of alcohol. There's a touch of back end bitterness and roastiness. The body is full and thick with low carbonation. The beer does stick to the mouth ever so slightly and leaves some aftertaste. The alcohol can be felt in the back of the throat. This is a good beer.","acevenom","Apr 28, 2013"

The flavor is sweet and malt with a bit of sugary caramel malt with some roasty milk chocolate. Earthy hop with a hint of wet cardboard round out the flavor. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet oily mouthfeel.

I don't know what exactly (who knows, maybe I've changed!) but I think the chocolate/malt/caramel flavors have become a little more subdued in the last 5-10 years.

Then, the cocoa, roasted malts, espresso, and a hint of dark fruits all barge their way in, along with a bit of warming alcohol. This orgy of flavors lasts all the way to the finish.

Black liquid, certainly opaque, does offer up a dark brown to orange at the very bottom of the glass. Richly layered nose of chocolate, cocoa, café au lait, cinnamon spiced oatmeal, maraschino cherries and blackberries, brush of pine cone, the hops bring more stiffness than scents into your nostrils, pleasingly unforced length. Full-bodied, while massively scaled manages to avoid heaviness and any leaden qualities. Even with a bitter quality to the dark chocolate and mocha crisp component, still sweet with flowers, orange juice, cinnamon, cherry, blackberry to blueberry fruit, dab of raisin and molasses too. Carbonation keeps plugging away, credit due for insistence. The oatmeal flavor is distinct and at times sort of brings a nuttiness to the show. Some tar and asphalt notes in there at the end. Dry and crisp finish, the roast and the orange citrus arguably last the longest. Given its overall makeup and character, stays damn drinkable.","farrago","Apr 17, 2011"

A touch of spotty lacing and a very thin collar around the edges of the beer. The nose brings forward a bit of black anise and some roast. Coffee and chocolate linger in the background. A touch of a metallic character is it warms. The taste melds things together a bit more, though the anise flavor certainly stands out in the finish, which also has a slightly-pronounced bitterness. Other than this, there's a touch of balanced sweetness and roast going back and forth. Body is a bit too thin. Drinks fairly well overall.

The brew tastes like dark fruit, roasted and burnt/charred malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, oats and some hops. The taste is a little more bitter than I expected it to be, but that's not a bad thing. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and coating with moderate carbonation.

The oat seems to have diminished with age, and the carbonation is too high at first (settles after 15 minutes or so). Thin body as the appearance suggested, with a smooth finish and lingering bitter roastiness. A big plus is that the alcohol is very well-hidden (another potential byproduct of aging). Fat Dog is not a bad beer by any stretch, but it's probably not in my top 50 imperial or oatmeal stouts. Still glad I got to try it, though.","wagenvolks","Jul 20, 2010"

It has a full, roasted flavor like dark roast coffee with a small touch of caramel sweetness and notes of chocolate and salmiakki. A bitter juniper flavor provides the finish and the aftertaste.

Body is a bit too light and a bit over-carbonated for me. Oatmeal stouts are supposed to be creamy and full, and this one lacks that.

Little zesty twang of spicing also, which was a pleasant surprise. Has a funky little kick at the end. Bitters a bit at the end, but does not overwhelm.

It's honestly hard to describe why I love this beer so much. It doesn't blow me away in the way I'd expect from a stout (Brooklyn's is my favorite example of the style). Rather, it's inviting and non-threatening. The bitterness factor is very low. The dark, bitter chocolate I expected from the nose has transformed into sweet, milk chocolate. Hints of anise, coconut (!), and a tiny bit of hops make this a pleasing brew to sip. I wasn't expecting much, but man was I blown away from this beer.

Full body, medium carbonation there is a creamy mouthfeel with a smoothness from the oatmeal. The strong hop profile blends very nicely with the heavy flavors of this stout creating an easy drinking beer despite the 9%.","scottg","Dec 05, 2008"
3.4,-15,4,4,3,3,3.5,"Appearance is pretty standard black with a nice thick tan head. Basically what was expected but well done. Aroma is of light spicy hops, nice and clean and airy, maybe a little minty or at least just a very light and refreshing aroma that hits you like you're smelling some sort of liquor. I personally think that the idea of an imperial oatmeal stout is an abomination. The alcohol completely overrides anything that makes it an oatmeal stout- the creamy, smooth mouthfeel and the dark roastyness lying underneath it. Both are totally destroyed by making this beer extreme. Furthermore, most imperial stouts have some nice hop flavor to balance out this alcohol, which this beer is noticeably missing from the experience (although it's there and would be delicious if the beer was about 5% abv lower). On top of all of this, the carbonation was a little high. This plus the alcohol made me feel like I was drinking sparks. This probably isn't a badly brewed beer, I just think it's a bad idea.","wiseguy142","Dec 04, 2008"

This is a really nice stout, not too thick or syrupy, but warming and nourishing, without having a throaty alcohol presence. There is a slight bite to the beer in the finish and there is some alcohol presence, but for a 9% beer, this one masks itself as well as any.

The oatmeal adds to the heft of this brew and balances it a bit more... were it not for the creamy body, the carbonation and dry finish would be far too much. As it is, this is one to savor, and certainly not one to down a few. The sweetness and bitterness could stand to be a bit more balanced, rather than being at odds in a bipolar sort of way; taking turns on the palate. The finish is a bit too alcoholic for the rest of the flavor, as it, along with the dense roasted grain, leaves the mouth both warm and dry, detracting from the final impression.","khiasmus","Oct 28, 2008"

The head was a lighter beige than I expected and slowly expanded out to just a rim around the glass. The aroma is big on sweet milk chocolate with coconut milk also really coming out. Sweet cream comes out in the finish of the nose. The taste is bit one-dimensional. Heavy chocolate malts overwhelm and kind of push many of the other flavors out. The one really surprisingly good part of this beer is how well the 9% ABV is hidden. It almost seems like I'm drinking chocolate milk. The mouthfeel is the only part of this beer experience that I found disappointing. With the amount of oatmeal involved I thought it would be much creamier. Instead it had an almost dry finish to it. Even when it warmed up and the creaminess really comes out of an oatmeal stout, this one fell flat. All in all its really drinkable. Its simplicity makes it easily sessionable even if the ABV makes it about impossible. I really would have given it a 5 except for the mouthfeel of the beer.","hwwty4","Jun 25, 2008"

A good finger and a half of thin mocha brown head formed from a rather gentle pour, then quickly dissipated into a thin ring of foam around the glass. Did leave some soapy streaks of lace on the glass. Smell was chocolate, thin coffee notes, black licorice, toasted oats, and a bit of molasses. A tiny bit of booze was also noted in the nose. Taste was just a tad better. Nice thick flaked oat flavor matched up with some semi-sweet chocolate. A little bit of burnt coffee and caramel finished this up nicely.

Hints of licorice and dark fruits arrive as the beer warms up, all with a nice creamy espresso finish. Medium-full in body, very smooth and creamy.

There is a nice coffee and malt and chocolate flavor in there, but the feel of everything just knocks it down a notch I say. Just too thin, or maybe it is just that it is thinner than the others I have tried. There is also an odd saltiness to it I think. Drinkable, sure.

Nose presented with strong aromas of molasses, malt and brown sugar. Flavor similar to the nose, as well as strong flavors of coffee and chocolate, that become more palatable through the tasting.

Two additional notes - I can't confirm the date for this bottle because the date code appeared to be water-soluble, and the alcohol content was not to be found on the label - I hunted three times - so I'll have to assume the 9.0% reported on Ba holds for my sample, as well.

Initially quite roasty, just shy of acrid, but gives way to more chocolate flavors that are distinctly bittersweet in the finish. The alcohol is quite well hidden here. There is a bit of a harsh aftertaste that is likely from the roasted malts, its not terribly prominent but detracts a bit from my opinion of this beer.

In the chalice the aroma was faint, yet the tall pilsner allow the aroma to rise slowly. Roasted malt, molasses and resin was upfront. Followed by a hint of smoke and soy sauce, that ended nicely with a scent of vanilla and licorice. The flavor was bold sweet dark plum and raisin to begin with that was short live with a bitter sweet chocolate and espresso ending.

Smell, this is an American style? For some reason I get hints of a british style, but maybe that's just me. Anyway, the 9% seems to appear at first in the nose, alcohol is definitely present. I'm not really getting the "oatmealy" smell. Smell is of chocolate, lots of brown sugar, and burnt coffee, not the best of odors. Taste is much better than smell leads on. Malty oats appear (I was waiting for them) and a very nice caramel malt smooths it out almost perfectly. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with little to no carbonation. So smooth for the abv, I hardly detect any alcohol on the tounge which makes it pretty drinkable so be careful with this one. Can I get the dog on the label as a pet, he would be bad ass.

This one feels like a meal in a bottle, very pleasant and chewy- much easier on the palate than other double stouts.

This is nicely roasty with some coffee. I thought the oatmeal was quite subdued and nicely melded in. Alcohol not noticable at all. This beer was not as sweet as I expected- a good thing.

Alcohols are nicely pronounced, reminding me that this is not my daddy's Oatmeal Stout. It has some kick.

On the palate, initially cloying sweetness dissipates somewhat as the beer warms. Dextrine sweetness crops up at the front, then some coffee, but the taste isn't nearly as complex as the aroma. It's just generally sweet instead, and kind of a let down. Mouthfeel is huge, very thick and chewy, with little balancing carbonation.

The brisk carbonation cuts the sweet raisin and port flavors, so the beer boasts depth and body without being too dense or cloying.

Perhaps I'm drinking this during a dumb period, and it just needs to age longer. But that still won't fix the thin body. Drink it fresh and enjoy, otherwise, don't even think about aging this one.

A bit of smoky burntness in the background. Perfect amount of alcohol flavor and warmth really complements the malt flavors going on. I am reminded of a warm brownie.

4.64,16,4,5,4.5,5,4.5,"Picked up a 12oz earlier today. Popped the cap, and the beer pours a dense opaque black. A modest topping of khaki head, thinning down to a tight film. Negligible lace. Smells like the Cadbury's fruit and nut chocolate bar. Sweet and very chocolatey, with a creamy smooth oatmeal vanilla presence. Coffee beans intensify with warmth, taking on a whipped mocha feel, with a shot of cherry syrup. Just a touch of booze. Very inviting. The flavor opens with chocolatey, creamy roastiness. Very delicious. Smooth and silky. Dense fruit syrup and whipped cream, it's like drinking a dessert. Full bodied and full flavored. The complexity feels smoothed out somewhat by the incredibly soft mouthfeel, but it is there. Definitely on the sweet side, but this is luscious and decadent, the way a great dessert should be. A hint of charred roastiness tones things down in the finish, a spot of clovey, smoky phenols as well. The barest touch of alcoholic, fruity sweetness as well. I''m enjoying every sip.

The color of the brew is opaque with an amber-ruby edge. The aroma is of plum/chocolate pudding, roasted pumpernickel bread, and coffee. The taste is nice and smooth up front. The chocolate, roated barley, and bitter coffee flavors are highlights. The astringent bitterness is very strong and never leaves your mouth. It is just the same mouthfeel as drinking black coffee. That fact alone makes this a one session brew; it is a good one just don't one more than one every once in a while.","phishgator","Jul 23, 2006"

This beer poured completely black with a small light tan head that lingered in the glass. Aroma was of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and licorice. Taste was nicely meshed with flavors of espresso coffee, dark fruits, chocolate, some winey/alcohol notes and sweet malts. As the beer warmed, flavors of burnt currants and some liqueur like notes became more apparent. This beer was medium bodied and had a slick and oily mouthfeel. Nevertheless, it was easy drinking and hit the spot on a cool and rainy night in early July. My only wish is that Stoudt's products become available in NC.","rodrot","Jul 06, 2006"

4,0,4,4,4,4,4,"Bottled on 11/16/05. Murky, impenetrable dark brown, like the thickest espresso imaginable; modest but dense tan foam cap. Chunky, flaky grey sediment all over the bottom of the pint glass. Nose is all chocolate mousse and vinous dark fruits. Big and sweet chocolate flavors swarm all over the mouth -- I recognize some cocoa flavor that reminds me of these chocolate flavored Twizzlers I used to enjoy as a kid. A big fusel alcohol taste washes in immediately thereafter, fizzling out to some bitter earthy hop flavors. Roastiness abounds throughout. Mildly sour aftertaste. I'm a sucker for the silky mouthfeel of anything brewed with oats, and this one has it in spades. But that big-ass alcohol content keeps buzzing in and breaking it up. All this alcohol distraction mellows out as the beer warms, but this dog definitely needs some time to chill in the kennel. Mouthfeel otherwise big and chewy. A promising big stout, but give it 6-12 months to tame before drinking. Score in good measure earned on credit, i.e. for potential with age.","orfeu","Mar 22, 2006"
4.2,5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Musings: As a lover of oatmeals, I didn't know what to make of this in the store. It is not a true oatmeal - and leans more towards an IS.

The smell is dominated by sweet, huge roasted malts with noticeable alcohol right off the bat. Coffee (like the ridiculously dark, bitter Sumatra coffee that the local cheese shop roasts up themselves), brown sugar, bitter chocolate, some vanilla extract and some light licorice. That taste is quite meaty literally in some respects. Of course the taste follows the aroma in that its malt-dominant, but it has a beefy au-jous flavor and mouthfeel to it. It has a thick, syrupy texture and very low carbonation The finish is bitter, long and warming. A good beer for long winter nights.","ski271","Jan 29, 2006"

Taste is very nice: your typical impy-stout bitter chocolate roastiness and mega-smooth mouthfeel as a result of the oatmeal and low carbonation. A touch of alcohol comes through in the taste, though not as much as the aroma would have you expect. Alcohol most noticeable as it warms.

Pours a half finger light brown head over a pitch black liquid. Just the faintest edging (brown) when held to light. Smells chocolate, lactose sweet, roast coffee. Some alcohol and searching also pulls up some grassy hop aroma. Tastes, whoa, the alcohol is much stronger on the tongue than in the nose. Noticable alcohol burn that persists from start to finish and has some rubbing alcohol qualities. Chocolate is present, but the alc sting makes a dry coffee stand taller. I think the alcohol is also hiding a grassy hop edge. This beer needs to age.

Taste is sweet roasty malts to start, slowly giving way to the strong alcohol flavor.

Pours black with a half inch brown head that reduces to almost nothing and leaves no lacing - looks like a black wine. Smells of alcohol, chocolate, coffee, anise, and hints of dark fruits, with alcohol being the most prevalent. It is harsh and alcoholic on the first sip with a body that is thinner than I'd like. The malts are roasted and contribute some bitterness along with some chocolate, coffee, and anise or dark fruits. The green/citric hops have a mild bitterness at first but intensifies a some toward the end.

3.5,-12.5,4,4,4,2,2.5,"Rather dark and opaque in color with a thick texture as it pours; relatively viscous in appearance. A mocha colored head with good retention and some lacing. The aromas I detect are that of: nuts, chocolate, mocha, cocoa, and bread. The taste contains elements of all of these as it warms. I'd like to add that this beer is smooth with a dry, sharp aftertaste with a bit of bread-like chewy character. Although, I enjoyed this beer, the aftertaste was just way too bitter and strong for my liking. With time, the aftertaste transforms into an unappealing entity in the back of my throat. A decent stout worth trying, but I won't be having anymore of this anytime soon.","jaluria","Nov 02, 2005"

The high ABV was not apparent in the taste until near the end of each swallow, when the alcohol fumes took off.

It had the sourness of an oatmeal stout, but there was just something missing. The dry mouthfeel didn't do it for me either, but in the end, it evened out to a balanced, drinkable imperial brew.

There is also a slightly sweet molasses flavor in there that is followed by a roasted malt and hops bitterness. The finish is bitter and dry and the alcohol makes for a biting finish.

It is certainly reminiscent of chocolate milk shake. The finish is slightly astringent, with roasted malt notes. This beer is nicely drinkable for an Imperial stout, it is so smooth and creamy and not too thick. This makes for an easy drinking Imperial stout.

Taste largely mirrors the aroma, with bitter, roasted coffee, roasty malts, dark fruits(prunes) and a lactose note that adds some creaminess. No alcohol is noted amidst the complexity of flavors.

Sharp-ish light acrid astringency and sherry-like flavor strikes the palate at first, some tannins, sweet black coffee, light fruits, cola, spicy alcohol, powdery light chocolate, paper, thinned underlying bitterness with a touch of rawness.

Slight coffee at best in the flavor profile, more chocolate and sweetness.

Flavor is a mix of malt madness with chocolate, coffee, brown sugar, and some oats (cheerios). The finish leaves a roasted malt and oaty taste in my mouth with just a pinch of sweet twang on the swallow. None of the hops on the nose are to be found in the flavor.

Pours an almost opaque dark brown with a miniscule tan head that was gone right away. Very little lacing as well. Toasted malt and coffee aroma. The body is rich after awhile but it is so dry, with so much hops and coffee on the front end it made my hair stand on end. Malt and chocolate show up to the party later. The finish is dry and roasty and bitter. I would get this again but as an Imperial Stout it falls short, as it needs more body and more balance.","Dogbrick","Jan 02, 2005"

The only draw back on the appearance was that the head went flat rather quick and completely disappeared. The color was a super black color with a tan head. The head started out big and fluffy, but then faded away. The smell was of dark chocolate malts, dark fruits, and a little alcohol. The taste was similar, but also had elements of coffee in it. Even though it had a rather strong alcohol content, it was hardly detectable in the taste. The taste and mouthfeel was actually very smooth.

As the head receded it left much lace clinging to the side of the glass. the smell was quite roasty and full of alcohol flavoring coupled with some lucsh caramel and chocolate. The taste was full of the oatmeal stout flavors that you would expect only with an increased alcohol content and a little more of a warming flavor in the after taste. The mouthfeel was flat and smooth, just how I like my stout. This was an excellent beer and a good experiement.","GreatPondBrewer","Dec 19, 2004"
3.98,-0.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Break out some hearty beef stew with root veggies and a big loaf of crusty bread for this bad boy. Or perhaps dessert is in order...try a homemade chocolate pudding to compliment the flavors that this "super stout" has to offer.","Zraly","Dec 15, 2004"
4.05,1.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Drinkability and Overall: This is a suprisingly drinkable beer considering the ABV, but not quite a session brew. This is the second of the new Stoudt's I've had, and I must say they've done well. A rich, full-flavored Stout that might just do wonders with age. Try it.","santoslhalper","Dec 12, 2004"
4.35,8.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Tonight I'm trying Stoudt's Fat Dog Stout in their new 12oz bottle. Poured very dark, nearly jet black. Had a nice tan head that settled slowly, and left decent lacing on the glass Smell is of coffee, roasted malt, and some alochol. The taste is of rather sweet, with notes of coffee and chocolate. The mouthfeel is amazing, smooth as silk. If i had more of this beer, they would have been consumed tonight, but, as fate would play out, I only had two. I will be getting me a case of these bad boys very soon.","soulfly967","Dec 07, 2004"
4.13,3.3,4.5,4,4,5,4,"Imperial Oatmeal Stout. 12 oz. bottle. Stamp for bottled on date was not lined up, and both lines were printed on top of each other. No worry. Pours a dark, pretty much pitch black liquid with no highlights. Thick, creamy tan head. Good look for any type of big stout. Head retention is good, lacing is decent. Smells of coffee, notes of alcohol and maybe some chocolate. Big roasted malt, almost burnt. Oatmeal sweetness, some coffee in the flavor as well. Good amount of hop bitterness. This is a big beer, as the alcohol is certainly present. Mouthfeel is a great aspect of this beer. A big, creamy, velvety beer. Soft and velvet from the oatmeal, low carbonation. A nice new version, good concept for an imperioa oatmeal stout. Despite the noticable alcohol went down pretty easy.","Bierguy5","Dec 07, 2004"

4.92,23,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Appearance: Pitch black awesome nectar of the gods the most imperial of an imperial oatmeal stout, whatever that means. Pure black coffeee tone huge massive tan head leaves evenly dispersed scattered lacing. Aroma: Deep notes of coffee, fusel alcohol, whole hop leaves, and chocolate this one is hard to beat along with a big grainy sweetness from the oatmeal addition. Taste: Smooth velvety pit of chocolate coffee tones wow what a big bodacious beer (I've never used that word before) however it descrirbes this one perfectly just amazing multi layers of herbal hop tea and black chocolate enhanced coffee melds together so nicely. Mouthfeel: Full bodied chewy at times smooth drinking completely coats the palate with a smooth sipping brew can be this enticing. Drinkability: Simply amazing brew that is hard to describe in simple English words you need to hear the groans and grunts of happiness that have occureed mmm mmmm mutha fuck^n good.","WVbeergeek","Nov 23, 2004"
4.43,10.8,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Good old fat dog has been revamped I have been waiting to try this. Pours out a pitch black with a glass filling brown head peaking out of the top. The head has decent staying power and leaves rings of lace all around the glass. Aroma is full of coffee and roasted malt. The smell seems surprisingly tame after taking a sip and seeing how much flavor this really has. Taste here is full and rich with sweet caramel, dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt and alcohol all coming together perfectly. There is a good bit of bitter earthiness here and notes of oats/grains. Alcohol is surprisingly prevalent but with the richness of the other flavors it mingles in quite well. After taste is a bitter roastiness. Mouthfeel on this is full and slick with a great warmness about it. I could definitely put down a few of these and want more. Great revamping of an old favorite. It definitely lives up to the Imperial Oatmeal Stout name, very tasty offering indeed.","meathookjones","Nov 23, 2004"
4.35,8.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability: I really like this. I can't say I ever had the "original" Fat Dog Stout, but this new Imperial Oatmeal version is great and unlike any other 'big' stout out there. I couldn't really throw this back unhindered, but I sure wouldn't refuse another one, especially on a chill winter evening. This new bottle conditioned series is 2/2 in my book so far (I have yet to get to the triple). One note: I notice quite a bit of tan yeast/protein/sludge in the last sip of my beer. It might be sage to slowly decant this guy if you're turned off by such sediment.","99bottles","Nov 17, 2004"
4.06,1.5,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"This is a medium / heavy bodied brew. The start was smooth and the finish was smooth and thin with a coffee, chocolate, and alcohol tones lasting briefly on the tongue. This is a great drinking brew and having more than one is quite easy even with the higher alcohol levels.","Gavage","Oct 29, 2004"
