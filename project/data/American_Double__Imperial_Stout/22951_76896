4.35,5.1,3.75,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,"Pours a clear deep brown that appears ink black (deep ruby highlights when held to bright light) producing barely a finger of frothy, shortlived, mocha head that leaves only splotches & motes  of lacing. Aroma is smokey bittersweet chocolate, like smoked Hershey's chocolate syrup (if there was such a thing), toffee, bitter coffee & cream, a hint of anise, char & booze. Taste starts as a bittersweet balance of burnt & smokey malts, Hershey's  chocolate syrup, creamed coffee & charcoal developing a phenolic/plastic character mixed with chocolate cherry cordials at or just after mid-sip & finishes with a intensifying burnt, chocolate, charcoal bitterness & alcohol that becomes a decreasingly bitter, roasted, slightly burnt, chocolatey, yet slightly phenolic aftertaste. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with light carbonation, alcohol spiciness, very chewy, silky & creamy. Complex. This would definitely get an even higher rating if it were not for the cloyingly odd, plastic/phenolic taste.","mothmanscott","Apr 01, 2015"

Aroma was a nice dark chocolate, seemed to shift notes a bit, but mostly chocolate/cocoa.  Taste had a bit of bitter alcohol up front, but shifted to a nice sweet cocoa flavor that lingered in the mouth for while.  Coated well, a bit overly tingly from the carbonation.  Overall, not bad at all.  Flavor wasn't as complex as I was hoping for, but nice and solid.","mountdew1","Jan 27, 2015"

Aromas of bittersweet baker's chocolate, cream sweetness, bitter roasted coffee, subtle boozy notes, vanilla, crème, and earthy notes. Flavors are heavily roasted, with bittersweet chocolate forward, mocha notes, cream and vanilla highlights, earthy tones, hints of booze, and subtle molasses notes. This beer is heavy and tasty. The body is huge, but dry, which increases the drinkability. Wow! The aftertaste is more of the roasted and bitter notes, with chocolate leading the way.

Aroma is chocolate milk, coffee, malt candy, raisins, vanilla, toffee, and faint whiff of wood char, smoke, and rum-like booze. Rich and sweet. Like a milk stout on steroids, creamy and smooth, the sweet elements on the nose translating very well on the palate. Each sip features a tripartite chocolate milk/coffee/toffee beginning, dried fruit in the middle, and an earthy, pungent, boozy coda. Cacao powder and mellow ash in the rather dry finish. Alcohol does not burn although one certainly knows its there in spades. Almost a curry-like spice at times (!). The wicked cool label doesn't hurt either. A smokiness does develop over time as the sweetness subsides a little. I might consider sharing this with a buddy next time ... Body on the thick side which amplifies the sweetness, gentle carbonation. A beer for the bold intrepid stout fan, to be sure. I continue to celebrate the arrival of Clown Shoes in this province and this is a more than fitting toast. I could stash a few crates of this and Crunkle Sam and do just fine on an island for a week or two.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 23, 2014"

I would rank this on par with the Brooklyn BCS, and there is some overlap in flavors between the two with the dominant chocolate and spicy booziness.","spacebear09","Jul 21, 2014"

Tasty, and enjoyable overall, I suppose, but the hops are somewhat disappointing in their support of the term 'American', the result seeming less than worthy of said nation's better examples of the style.","biboergosum","Jun 25, 2014"

Smell of licorice, chocolate, coffee, and some dark fruits are noticeable in the aroma. Nice, big flavor of dark cocoa, coffee, and anise. Taste of some bitter hops are present too but in a good way. Really smooth; like velvet. Thick, creamy, smooth and so easy to drink. Picked this up on a whim cause of the really sweet label and now glad I grabbed two of these. My first Clown Shoes brew and it did not disappoint. Highly recommend this to any Imperial Stout lover!","dpgoblejr","May 23, 2014"

Completely black liquid, no sign of any other color, no way you can see any bubbles, solid. The nose slowly builds, not aiming to knock you out with one blow, milk chocolate toffee, vanilla layers itself like a thick cake, plum, black cherry fruit, hazelnuts and Brazil nuts, there’s a grainy bite and a sweet smokiness too, does kind of lurch as it dissolves but the alcohol isn’t vicious, just clumsy. Full-bodied, dense and making it slow to react. The plum, cherry fruit sweeter here, like a fruit cake. Not to downplay the milk chocolate, coconut, caramel, oatmeal notes. The carbonation starts to lend it creaminess then oddly stops. Very light citrus and flower accents, has a tea leaf to tobacco leaf smokiness. Its weakest point might be its lack of flow and thirst quenching capability, both of which seem within its reach. Enjoy how the sweetness trails off through the finish, making it fresher and potentially more food friendly.","farrago","Mar 22, 2014"

Really liked the complexity of the taste, which really came out as it warmed up. There was a little bit of carbonation in the mouth, but was still substantial. I really enjoyed this beer.

4.23,2.2,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a really nice beer and a really nice example of a Smoked Stout, the smoked aspect and the Stout aspect were balance very nicely and neither one was too overpowering and I think that gave this beer the pretty much perfect amount of balance that a Smoked Stout should have. This beer had good drinkability, it was fairly smooth, the alcohol was hidden well for the most part and was a little warming, it was rich, pretty filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, If I really wanted to I think I could take out the bomber by myself, but I think this is a good beer for splitting with someone and I think one glass is close to the right amount for me. What I liked the most about this beer was the balance, to me that was the highlight of this beer and it was just where I would want it to be. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad at all, but I wish it had just a little less carbonation. I would buy this beer again if I saw another bottle and I would like to see how it changes over time. I would recommend this beer to people who like Smoked Stouts and I think it's balanced enough that most Stout lovers would like it to. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, I heard it was pretty good and usually brewers bring out some pretty good beers for anniversary's, but I was still impressed with how good this beer is and it pretty much has everything that I look for in a Smoked Stout. Great job guys, this was very enjoyable beer and I liked that you released a style that I think doesn't get enough credit, thanks a lot and keep up the great work. Now I'm really kicking myself for not buying the barrel aged version when I had the chance, I won't make that mistake again.","StoutHunter","Jan 10, 2014"

It's a shame that some asshole had to ruin this awesome beer's name by suing over something stupid. Check out the article, some dumbass actually though this could be confused with Vampire Pale Ale - a belgian pale ale.

4,-3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Got in a trade with Cyde. 22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled 12/2011. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light char, toast, toffee, wood, smoke, coffee, vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark and roasted malt notes with moderate smoke presence; and good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, toffee, light char, wood, smoke, coffee, vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, toffee, light char, smoke, coffee, vanilla, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors; with moderate smoke balance and zero cloying flavors on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick, creamy, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice smoked imperial stout. All around nice balance, complexity, and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the gravity. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 23, 2013"

Aroma is nice, the brew smells like dark fruit, chocolate, burnt/charred malt, and a bit of coffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some molasses, smoked malt and vanilla. Has a good sweet and burnt/roasty flavor overall. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and slick with moderate carbonation.

The color was a mix of dark raspberry and dark roast coffee beans, with a thin layer of foam, which on looks alone, seemed very promising. However, upon first sip, I found it somewhat syrupy and not as smooth as its looks, with taste notes that was a cross between black licorice and soy sauce. This was not a thirst quencher, but more like a meal. For these same reasons, it's probably a great drink for those who appreciate a good hearty imperial stout. As a fan of True Blood, glad I tried it, but may have been too big of a bite for this IPA-er.","SweetBrown","May 11, 2013"

The appearance is nearly perfect, black as night with a pillow of fluffy tan sitting on top, coating the glass with sticky lace all the way through. It smells beautiful, with vanilla extract and dark fruits being subdued by roasted grains and dark chocolate. The aroma does nothing to suggest how smoky this brew really is. As a fan of Rauchbier, this was much to my delight. The initial punch of bittersweet chocolate, caramel and dash of espresso is followed by an even more bitter dryness and charred feel. It's very boozy, I am feeling slightly buzzed already after drinking down this bomber myself. Perhaps I rushed a bit because it's so good!

The factor that stands out about this beer is how well done the smoking is.

4.35,5.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Wow. It's carries a really nice three-way balance between smoked malt, charred malts, and sweet dark fruits. The smoke almost makes for a sort of psuedo-tartness that fades out as the smoke vacates in the finish, leaving just the char and sweet to linger in the mouth. If I had to pick something to criticize, it would be the nose, which does NOT display all of the flavor elements as faithfully as it could have. MIA from nose but present in the flavor: nuttiness, a faint olive oil background garnish, a majority of the dark fruit sweetness, and almost all of the chocolate malt tones. Even so, it's worth saying that the nose isn't terrible per se... it's just muted and not as complex as the flavor.","WastingFreetime","Dec 22, 2012"

Some lacing is left on the side of the glass as the head dissipates. There are aromas of dark roasted malt, dark fruits, chocolate, coffee, and some of that 10% alcohol comes up to the nose. I get some of that smoke as well from the smoked malt. The flavors are very complex in this stout. There's nice dark roasted malt flavor with creamy chocolate, black coffee, dates, smoked malt, and some alcohol. It's a wonderfully balanced flavor. The body is full with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The carbonation is moderate. This is a very easy beer to drink despite the alcohol presence. This is an excellent beer.","acevenom","Dec 13, 2012"

4.65,12.3,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Recommended by Beer Lady at Tully’s in Wells, ME - THANK YOU! This is a very nice stout. Not much of a head on the pour - kind of a smallish khaki/tan head, nice mahogany tints. Expectation was for a whallop of flavor, but found it more subtle and with a lot going on. Cocoa, some smokiness,, a bit of vanilla hiding in there, just enough hops to keep the flavor interesting. Nice malts, good "undertones" of the coffee/roast flavors. Not as "thick" on the tongue as other imperials, but very nice. Minimal aftertaste. Definitely high on the list of faves. No doubt about the 10% ABV...it isn't shy. A lot of complexity and subtle flavors going on, yet it isn't "work" to drink. Good effort from CS!","LeRose","Nov 25, 2012"

4.18,1,4,3.5,4.5,5,4,"The beer pours a rouge black near to midnight with a light tan quarter fingers width head. It sits in the glass completely opaque, which is quite encouraging. Lacing is thin and splotchy along the sides of the glass. On the nose the beer smells of a mélange of different things. Slight roasted malt sits alongside dark chocolate, coffee, a damp bready smell, and the faintest hint of citrus hops and an even fainter hint of sweet alcohol. This beer tastes rich and creamy with great splashes of coffee, chocolate, and the faintest hint of smoked malts and woods. The beer begins as sweet cream and slight alcohol before opening into cream and coffee with chocolate side notes and a lingering faint bitter note of citrus, pine, and smoky camp fire. This beer feels fantastic of on the mouth. Thick and creamy with a soft carbonation that caresses the tongue in a beautiful embrace. This beer has a light chewiness to it as well, and leaves the mouth slightly wet, but the tongue feels dry with coffee and smoke. Overall this is a great success from Clown Shoes. The mouthfeel is succulent and smooth, and overall this beer is delicious for sipping with nice complexity, and great full flavors. This beer is worth drinking for sure!","Maxwell","Nov 09, 2012"

What may be the best aspect about this beer is how drinkable it is, and the fact you can't detect any alcohol. I sat on this several months, but will sit on the Blaecorn Unidragon even longer. It'd be nice if they brew this again.","haazer","Nov 06, 2012"

Blacker than coffee. I don't really smell anything -- chocolate and maybe some light malt/molasses, but not much (smell increases over time to incorporate warm chocolate and booze). Taste is awesome. Chocolate, coffee, molasses and a bit of smoke and tobacco, yum. Mouthfeel is very nice, smooth with prefect amount of bitterness. Overall this is a great beer, wish it smelled a bit more intense, would love to have this agian. Cheers.","rodlavers","Nov 05, 2012"

3.61,-12.8,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"22oz. bottle served at 52 degrees in my KTG snifter. Pours about a shade darker than cola with a frothy, half-inch, khaki-colored head embedded with ringlets. Head eventually dissipates into a thin tight band around the shoulders and a creamy dollop across the center. Some spots and thin arcs of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose is fairly average - a suggestion of dark malts, a hint of char and a slightly metallic quality. Taste follows nose - malt profile is a bit more evident. There's also a bit of sugary sweetness (brown sugar and/or molasses) that peaks out towards the middle, but is quickly replaced by an earthy bitterness at the finish. There's also a bit of an artificial sweetener character, and the slightly metallic quality evident in the nose also re-asserts itself. Mouthfeel is medium-light (but closer to medium), with a slightly oily consistency and somewhat of a coarse carbonation. Overall, not sure what the hype is about this beer. At $9.99 for a non-BA bomber, I was expecting something a bit more than what was offered, but what I found was a fairly lackluster stout that doesn't really come together for me.","Jwale73","Apr 27, 2012"

4.51,8.9,4.5,3.5,5,5,4.5,"Ooooh...wow. For a 10%'er, this is freaking fantastic! Very smooth and chocolaty with very little bite or astringency. Very nice Clown Shoes. I liked the Unidragon well enough to buy a couple for the cellar, and was skeptical of this one at first trying to separate itself...but hot damn! This one is tasty and smooth, the ABV is absolutely nowhere to be seen (though I am sure I will feel it soon). Hops still play a factor on the flavor and finish, which adds a nice dimension to it. Yeast is clean and the sweetness is just about perfect. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy with just enough carbonation. It reminds of a fresh (and good batch) of Buried Hatchet with a little bump in alcohol. Just so smooth and tasty. I have not been this surprised by a beer in quite some time. Dont think this would age well though, it is not overly complex. I'll be buying a few more of these for sure, although I would buy alot more if these bastards would put it in six or four-packs at a decent price.","twiggamortis420","Feb 03, 2012"

4.45,7.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall, this is excellent Imperial Stout fare, though anyone not already a fan of big, black, ash-laden stouts will likely gag at the flavors. The beer really is like a cup of strong black coffee and a cigarette, as well as a small caramel candy held under the tongue. Personally, the combination is a huge success, and while I admit that the beer does perhaps suffer from what is perhaps an overabundance of ash (especially in the aftertaste, which becomes overwhelming at times), it still earns Clown Shoes a place of respect in my books.","jondeelee","Jan 29, 2012"

Roast and milk chocolate aroma, a bit of smoke and citrus, alcohol, cocoa and sugar. Sweetness and alcohol up front with bitterness dominating later on the palate. Caramelized sugar, smoke and roast, slight fruity notes towards the end, caramel and milk chocolate. Full bodied and smooth in texture, alcohol warmth, lowish carbonation, slight astringency. I enjoyed it, though I wonder whether it's made much of an impression on me since there was nothing that really stood out.","DrJay","Jan 28, 2012"
4.28,3.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured into a 20 oz Duvel tulip, bottle dated 12/11. Pours opaque black, with a large 3 inch head, with great retention that slowly settles into a layer of patchy bubbles, and leaves lace all over the glass. Smell is expresso, tobacco, smoke, and leather. Taste is expresso in the lead and all the other flavors in the background, with a hit of smoke in the finish. Body is large, good amount of life for its large ABV, very lush, and drinkable for its style. This is a very good RIS.","SawDog505","Jan 27, 2012"

The hops are toned down allowing the richness and smokey flavors to come out. More of an export stout then a true imperial stout, at least in my eyes.

4.17,0.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Watching some 40oz Crew vids on YouTube and rockin' a new smoked stout. Good times. This stuff pours a straight onyx topped by over a finger of dark tan foam. ...Maybe it's light sienna... Anyway, the nose comprises heavy chocolate syrup with a twinge of smokey peppers in the distance. Simple, but damn enjoyable! The taste holds notes of dark chocolate/cocoa, mild mesquite smoke, roasted malts, light char, and a nice vein of molasses. Nice. The body is a strong medium/light hefty, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly syrupy/lightly chewy feel. Overall, a very nice stout, one whose smokey components are subdued without being fully subservient (humble, perhaps, is a better word) and the whole thing coming together tastily. Good times, indeed.","TMoney2591","Beers"

4.33,4.6,4.5,4,4.5,5,4,"Overall pretty good, lots of dark malts blended well, light smoke, plenty of roast, chocolate, caramel, then earthy spicy hops, all help to down out the alcohol as it's 10% but doesn't drink like it. The only downfall is the briny light burnt bitterness from all the roasted malts in it, but this is much better than most at that. I think a few of these in the cellar will be nice. This reminds me a lot of Goose Island Night Stalker.","jlindros","Jan 05, 2012"
