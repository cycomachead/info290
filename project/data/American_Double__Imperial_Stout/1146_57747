The Coffee Stout lives up to all the hype for me. It has a better balance overall than the regular BCBS (which I like as well). I like that the coffee taste does not overpower, it seems to offset some of the sweetness of the regular BCBS. Highly recommend!","tjcapture","Feb 12, 2015"

I do feel as if the coffee flavor had faded a bit but the taste was still a very smooth, sweet malt, dark fruit,toffee,molasses, and a hint of milk chocolate.

I had this alongside Abraxas and Berserker, as part of their Strong Ale Fest, and it was interesting to compare these three Imperial Stouts.  At first taste, the BCBCS seemed a little in the shadow of the other two beers, both of which have quite a few more strong flavors competing for your attention.  But over a forty-five minute time drinking all three beers, BCBCS really came to the fore.  It's so smooth, so perfectly balanced.  It's just the right combination of an incredible stout, with coffee, vanilla, and whisky flavors all blended together harmoniously.   It's got a quiet intensity and great depth.  At the end, my wife and I both agreed that it was our favorite among these three exceptional stouts.","VashonGuy","Jan 15, 2015"

This beer takes the extremes of the beer world and mashes them together. Imagine a cross between the sweetness and creaminess of a really good milk stout with the viscosity and complexity of a Russian imperial stout. That is BCBCS. Flavor was deep, sweet, rich, oaky bourbon, tons of chocolate, vanilla and coffee. Perhaps there was a hint of amaretto too. Incredibly complex. The texture was oily, thick, and barely carbonated. I split a 12oz bottle with 3 friends and it was incredibly satisfying. I could have drank a little more, but the full bottle would have been too much for me. I need more of this stuff.","yannimou","Jan 09, 2015"

The Bourbon is big in this, without getting too boozy at any point, while producing a pleasant, oaken warmth with vanilla notes in it, complimenting to the slightly bitter coffee, as well as the scorched, earthy malts and sweet milk chocolate. The coffee becomes visible on the palate, paired with slick caramel and cocoa nibs, while a wooden earthiness adds to the subtle coffee sting, resulting from the harmonious, convenient integrated Bourbon. Finishes with sweeter toffee, as well as molasses and hints of coffee, while smooth, slightly sweeter milk chocolate represents the foundation of this beer.","aleigator","Jan 03, 2015"

Finish is coffee, chocolate and a bit of bourbon burn. Heavy bodied with a pleasant creaminess. My first of the many variants of the original BCBS, which has always been a favorite. The coffee is blended well with the other flavors and adds a surprisingly smooth new dimension. Like the base version, a world class imerial stout. I'd buy this again, but will never spend the time or gas required to get a single bottle of this. Delicious but too hard to find.","LiquidAmber","Nov 09, 2014"

4.7,0.2,,,,,,"Almost black in color with a dark tan head that quickly disappears to leave just a small amount of lacing.  Big coffee and roasted malt with sweet bourbon and chocolate in the smell.  Taste matches the smell, roasted malt and espresso and chocolate with a bourbon finish.  Full body, silky smooth, medium carbonation.  Excellent beer, so smooth for such a high ABV.","ksimons","Sep 14, 2014"

4.25,-9.4,,,,,,"Overall:  I liked the brew.  In the class of high-alcohol Imperial Stouts (well, I guess there really aren't any low-alcohol Imperial Stouts), it is certainly a stand-out.  Nice complex flavor and the coffee notes were just about right.  Good finish; the product is well-rounded.  Definitely a beer to sip for special occasions, and not something I'd put on a ""go to"" list, even if it was easier to find.  Despite this site's notes about smoking and tasting, I fired up a ""1990 Vintage"" Rocky Patel for the last third of my glass.  The beer holds up well to a good cigar, which in my experience is unusual.","Veeblefetzer","Aug 30, 2014"

4.85,3.4,4.75,4.75,5,4.75,4.75,"2013 Edition: It poured a deep brown to black with a slight to no tan head. The aroma hit me straight out of the bottle of coffee, heavy stout and bourbon. The taste was otherworldly. A perfect blend of the base stout that exuded bittersweet chocolate and a deep roasty flavor with the coffee and the bourbon barrel characteristics. As it warmed the bourbon booziness came out as well as a stronger coffee tone that was akin to espresso. Hints of vanilla and charred oak emerged and really capped off a world class beer.","brurevu","0"

4.97,6,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Bottle date 11/15/13. Pours pitch black with a 1/2 finger caramel-colored head that dissipates quickly. Nose is coffee spiciness/bitterness combined with sweetness from the base beer. Just a phenomenal nose that evokes the finest coffee liqueur imaginable. Taste is sweetness & coffee beany up front. Spiciness all around, particularly toward the back of the mouth. Oak in the mix too, of course. The finish alone has more complexity than the entire experience of most beers: coffee spice, bitterness, sweetness reminiscent of maple and molasses, oak. So many flavors that fit together so well. Mouthfeel is a thick, almost syrupy consistency. Well-carbonated. Overall it's a phenomenal beer that never fails to impress, year after year. Regular Bourbon County Stout is awesome, and it's hard to believe anything could improve upon it. But that's exactly what coffee does: substantially improves upon a near perfect beer.","foobula","Jun 02, 2014"

While none of the Bourbon County beers would be noted for their subtlety, I was surprised at how much the coffee flavors were beaten into submission by the other huge flavors here. NOTE: Had the '13 version a few days later from the 12 oz. bottle. While substantially the same experience, the coffee was more noticeable from the beginning, the bourbon was more integrated, and was on the whole a better drink.

Slight brown head with very little retention. Intense coffee in the aroma. You can easily pickup the strength of the alcohol in the aroma, strong bourbon, hints of vanilla, and tobacco. The coffee is up front as I was hoping for. Still very sweet but a bit toned down from BCBS, which is a huge positive for my taste, just the right amount to round out the flavors of anise, vanilla, oak, and raisin that dance and marry very poignantly.  Serious viscosity here with very little carbonation, you can almost chew on this beer. Was not disappointed in my first BCBS variant!","Phigg1102","Apr 20, 2014"

The nose is strong and mouthwatering and is dominated both by rich malt and boozy bourbon with notes of chocolate, espresso, vanilla, toffee and nutty oak. On the palate is big bourbon and malty toffee/caramel sweetness, dark chocolate and loads of coffee/espresso. The mouthfeel is very round, smooth, velvety and huge on the palate.

A bit foamy at first, but the head is gone, never to be seen again, after about 5 minutes. Looks oily and viscous. The nose is incredible: roasted espresso beans that have been soaked in bourbon. Heavy amounts of roast, espresso, and sweet bourbon vanilla. My god. Taste follows the nose, then hammers it out of the park: equal parts iced espresso and bourbon. Both flavors are there, and neither overpowers the other: complementary. Am I drinking a bourbon-spiked espresso, or a bourbon with a shot of espresso in it? It's both of those things, and something else entirely. The booze is definitely there, warming me up but not knocking me out. Lovely vanilla marshmallows round out each sip. Mouthfeel is thick, viscous, and smooth. So luscious and decadent. Simply astonishing: the balance between the roast coffee, the heavy bourbon, and the luscious mouthfeel is out of this world. The finest beer I've ever had. I've got one BCBCS left, and I'll be enjoying it on my wedding night. It's that kind of beer. Cheers!","blankenhoney","Mar 30, 2014"

Tastes something like a oaky, coffee, less-sweet port wine or something. I'm getting frustrated that I can't pick out all the scents and flavors, but it's pretty damned good. It'll probably come to me later. I'll finish here and continue to sip.","Mikeluzzjr","Mar 24, 2014"

The smell is strong with chocolate, coffee, and a good amount of booze. The taste brings all of the flavors together - starts with coffee and chocolate and finishes with vanilla and oak. No flavor really dominates, which makes this really smooth and drinkable. Overall, this is one of my favorite beers ever. It's a truly magnificent creation","mc4z","Mar 10, 2014"

4.32,-7.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"2100th review! 12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 11/15/2013. Pours dense pitch black color with a small fairly dense dark tan head with decent retention, that reduces to a ring of lace that lingers. Minimal lacing on the glass. Aromas of huge dark chocolate, roasted coffee, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, oak, clove, light char, and roast/oak earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge dark chocolate, roasted coffee, cocoa, toast, roasted malt, caramel, vanilla, toffee, oak, clove, bourbon, light char, and roast/oak earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, coffee, cocoa, toast, roasted malt, caramel, vanilla, toffee, oak, clove, bourbon, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great malt/barrel flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic BA imperial coffee stout. All around awesome complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 07, 2014"
4.58,-2.3,4.25,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Edit: had 2014 and 2013 back to back in a snifter on 1/3/15.. Both poured black as night, with limited head and light lacing. Smell was dominated by dark fruit, vanilla, coffee, and dark chocolate. Taste followed suit. 2014 had more raisans, plums, and dark chocolate, while 2013 was silmilar, but had more coffee and dark chocolate bitterness. Definitely a great beer. I liked the fresh version a little more though both were great.","OneEye78","Mar 07, 2014"

Nevertheless, while it contains a little less heat and barrel sweetness overall, I daresay that's the main reason that I enjoy BCBS to begin with. Still, any self-respecting beer geek would be crazy to not seek this out - it's by far one of the most memorable coffee infused stouts I've ever had. This vintage would not benefit with age, in my view. It will get progressively earthy and lose its coffee profile. Without any of the spiciness, it won't be as thrilling. I'm absolutely curious how the 2012 vintage is drinking right now - will post an update as soon as I get around to trying it!","magictacosinus","Feb 09, 2014"

4.68,-0.2,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Overall I thought this was a very good beer and a very good example of a strong barrel aged Stout, the coffee had a really nice flavor to it and it for sure lived up to the name of Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout and I feel that the Coffee was showcased in the beer, it helped the beer in some ways, but it also hurt it in other ways. This beer had nice drinkability, it's a sipper, but not as much BCBS, it's fairly smooth, rich, a little sticky, a little filling, lightly boozy and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, I might contemplate drinking two of these, but just like BCBS one might be the perfect amount for me, and it males for a great beer to a sip on a cold winter morning. What I like the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, I think the coffee caused it to not be as sticky as BCBS and I really liked that. What I liked the least about this beer was that the coffee was just a little too dominating in the taste, if it was dialed back a notch or two I think it would allow some more of those chocolate and bourbon flavors to come through while enhancing the pretty light coffee flavors that BCBS has, I would for sure buy this beer if I ever saw it, I haven't seen BCBS around here so I doubt I will see the variants, my friend had to get this one shipped to him from North Dakota. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Coffee Stouts, especially if your a big fan of KBS. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, i do think it could be balanced just a little better,but other than that I think it's pretty close to being world class and I might even like it a little more than KBS, I would have to have the two side by side to figure it out. BCBS is still my favorite of the series so far, but this one came fairly close. Great job guys, this was another great beer and I'll be on the look out for the other variants, keep up the kick ass work.","StoutHunter","Feb 03, 2014"

It's pretty rare to find something so varied as this that also felt so harmonious at the same time and even more rare to find a beer that reminded me at the time I drank it of how impressive a ""liquid bread"" can be. The truly great beers make you feel at the time of their consumption that you're damn lucky to be alive in a place and time where sheer happiness is obtainable and thankfully, this was one of those beers that reminded me of why I love beer so much. If you can find it, ignore the price posted and just get this. All 5 of your senses will thank you indefinitely.","JerzDevl2000","Jan 19, 2014"

On par with KBS although this offering is slightly better than the 2012 KBS that I have in my beer fridge. I can't even deduct points because it's owned by Budweiser! The vanilla and toffee tones are outstanding. The high alcohol is well hidden. Cheers to Goose Island for living up to the hype on this one.

This beer is damn perfect with a ton of coffee and bourbon notes in the aroma and taste to go along with roasted malts. Overall, this has to be my favorite beer I've every tried. HIGHLY recommended!

Poured from bottle into pint glass, with minimal head notwithstanding intentional efforts to render big foam with an aggressive pour (perhaps I served it too cold). Lots of tiny mocha bubbles in deep, dark background. The view is like looking into an inviting black hole, enticing the viewer to leap into the abyss. The smell is off the charts, like the love you lost in college. And that first taste reminds me of my first hint of eroticism...mystical and captivating, yielding pangs of guilty pleasure (somehow, I know what I am about to do must be illegal). The coffee flavors are almost too intense and overpowering, but not quite. Toffee, vanilla, espresso, and caramel all appear here. And the finish is so silky smooth and sweet that I didn't realize the entire experience was over, until it was. Alas, BCBCS will tease and intrigue forever, and I shall continue touts for her now more than ever. One taste is both my original sin and my eternal condemnation...","JohnParadee","Dec 24, 2013"

5,6.6,5,5,5,5,5,"Midnight black, thick pour with a quickly receding finger of head. The aroma is to die for, like sticking your head into a bag of fine, fresh roasted coffee beans. The flavor opens up, beginning with powerful espresso notes, and segueing seamlessly into deep, dark chocolate, followed by vanilla beans, and finally, lovely bourbon. The body is syrupy and rich, although perhaps a bit thinner than regular BCBS, due to the coffee infusion. The finish may also be a tad less lengthy, but the intensity is greater, as it positively envelops the palate in a crescendo of flavors. This is, hands down, my favorite coffee stout, and perhaps my favorite stout in general. Well worth the hunt.","Impfan","Beers"

If only the head would have been thicker and longer lasting, or even traces of lacing on the glass, and some of my lower “4” ratings may have gotten bumped up a quarter or even half point.

4.39,-6.4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4,4.25,"The beer pours an inky, midnight black, much like regular BCBS, a dark tan head briefly forms and then fizzles away to a scrim; the head is slightly lighter than the head that forms on BCBS. In body, the beer is thick, viscous, and opaque, and when swirled, the beer leaves a brief set of alcoholic legs on the glass. On the nose, the beer shows its departure from regular BCBS. Rich fruity coffee buffets the nose with just a trailing hint of spicy solvent and alcohol. The coffee smells of a beautiful medium roast, moving from cocoa beans, to touches of vanilla, dark chocolate, earth, cinnamon, nutmeg, and even a touch of chili powder as the coffee interacts with the spicy alcohol. This beer has a truly delicious nose to it, reminiscent of sticking your head inside a bag of fresh coffee beans. The stout beneath the coffee does get a little confused in the richness of the coffee, blending in places, and muting in others, but I’m not all that disappointed by that as I see this beer’s nose as a vast improvement over the boozy BCBS. The barrel is light in the nose, but seems to be contributing to the vanilla notes, and perhaps also the slight boozy notes. On the tongue, the beer tastes richly complex, blending fruity coffee, rich bourbon barrels, and boozy stout. Sweetness pairs well with the bitters of the coffee, creating a nearly chocolaty sweetness, while rounded tannins lightly touch the finish and provide mild structure in the mouth. Coffee acidity is also present, giving the beer a slight tingle. In flavor, this beer is far superior to BCBS at this age. Rich, fruity coffee beautifully blends with the barrel as the beer touches the tongue bringing fresh medium roast coffee, prunes, earth, and rich dark chocolate flavors. Vanilla and soft oak dance alongside the coffee notes as faint roasted malt character is sensed along the edges of the flavor. As the beer splashes over the back of the throat, hot alcohol does come through, providing spicy notes of cinnamon to coincide with the rich coffee flavors as the coffee is slightly muted. The finish is briefer than BCBS, bringing notes of raw coffee beans, and then freshly brewed coffee, as well as spicy alcohol. In the mouth, the beer is full and slippery, feeling thinner than BCBS but still full with a silky mouthfeel and weak carbonation. The beer remains chewy and luscious, though the coffee has certainly diluted the initial fullness of the beer. Alcohol is smooth and warming, with just a touch of bite. Overall, I like this beer more than I like BCBS. I’ll admit that part of that is how the coffee hides the alcoholic bite in this beer, but I’m also a coffee-lover and the coffee flavors found in this beer are rich and complex, beautifully blending with the barrel aging. This beer is not KBS, however close it might come, and does still carry some booziness in the finish. I wouldn’t age this bottle for more than a couple months, seeing as how the awesome coffee flavors will die out, but I would certainly advise picking up a bottle and trying this puppy out. Good stuff.","Maxwell","Dec 11, 2013"

I am getting vanilla, lots of dark roast coffee of course, some milk chocolate, little booze for ABV and peat/roasted malts. The coffee competes with the bourbon making it slightly less apparent than the base beer which is too bad. The body seems lighter than the base beer to me having had them back to back but still full with light to moderate carbonation.

Gets more barrel flavours as it warms up although when it gets room temperature warm, it's not quite as good. So I would enjoy it at cellar temperature when possible.

While they age nicely, I prefer them slightly more fresh. The different roasts each year bring out their own individual characteristics.

I've had FBS nearly a year old that tasted no different than one less than a month old, so no excuses for this beer.

Got to share this awesome Coffee Stout at a Alchemist Heady Topper tasting that I did in Chicago on 6/5. After the Heady Topper was gone, the guests dragged out and a couple of 12 ounce bottles of the Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Coffee Shout and a bomber of the Bruery's Black Tuesday. I rated both beers the same score, and both were top of the line brews, but I would have to give the edge to Black Tuesday. But I might have flipped the edge if I had the Black Tuesday first. Both were just a total joy to consume; especially with all my new friends that came to share my Heady Topper Tasting.","ricknelson","Sep 06, 2013"

Aromas of earth, oak, booze, vanilla, molasses, chocolate, roast and hints of char. Very rich and robust nose. Flavors of booze forward, with a heavy bourbon/vanilla rich and sweet follow, rich molasses and roast caramel blend in the backbone, bitter and roasted coffee notes, and some oaky/earthy notes. Amazingly and delicately balanced on a rich, smooth, dense body. The aftertaste is boozy, with a rich vanilla and coffee blend giving sweet and bitter characteristics. Smooth, creamy finish, with a bittersweet linger. Amazingly drinkable, but the warmth and booze builds quickly. This is tasty!","GarthDanielson","Aug 30, 2013"

Aroma includes marshmallow, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, bourbon, some alcohol and some of those wafer cookies. Taste follow suit with some molasses notes and brandy. Thick, viscous and rediculously good.","KickbacksSteve","Aug 21, 2013"
4.27,-9,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours black and rests beneath a half-inch thick layer of brown, frothy head that resides for a couple of minutes. The aroma is of bourbon, oak, ground coffee, a bit of espresso, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, and a touch of almond and hazelnut towards the end. It tastes of bourbon, vanilla, coffee grounds, hazelnut, oak, maybe some cedar (or other dry wood), some nuts (almond, cashew), and chocolate with a nice roasted malt finish. Mouthfeel is lively, yet thick. It readily coats the mouth, but the carbonation keeps it from leaving a sticky residue. Finish is clean, but I wouldn’t call it dry. Overall, this is an impressive stout. The base beer is wonderful in its own right, and the addition of coffee adds a whole new dimension.","eclipse54","Aug 21, 2013"

The aroma was quite boozy with notes of dark fruit and burnt malts in the aroma. On the initial taste one first notices the booze. After this, one notices a chalky texture filled with dark chocolate, cherry and chewy malts. The coffee seems fairly masked in the overall scope of the beer. In the aftertaste, the warming of the alcohol comes to the front. In addition, the burnt malts and chocolate continue to make an impression. While I enjoyed this one, I did not find myself as impressed as some people. Still, this is a way above average stout.","JohnnyHopps","Jun 14, 2013"

Not just any coffee, you can tell this is premium beans with its distinct aroma and flavor. 2013's BCBS is hot to begin with, and everything blends perfectly. Caramel colored head that dissipates rather quickly, just the right amount of carbonation to open your tastebuds. Compared to 2012, this blows it out of the water. It might blow every other BCBS this year out of the way. At the tasting, the beers included BCBS Barleywine, BCBS 2013, BCBS Coffee, BCBS Templeton Rye, BCBS Backyard Rye & BCBS Proprietor's. I saved a small and equal portions of each for a grand cru.. and this still came out prevalent. I don't think I even want coffee anymore, I just want this.

I have had this beer fresh and it was probably a 4.5 overall but with a few years on it an amazingly complex beer has devolped, glad I held onto this one.","joefuzz","May 26, 2013"

Just a maniacal explosion of coffee beans; roasty, bitter, creamy, and sweet all at once. Crazy oak, bourbon, vanilla, and cocoa tones with a nearly perfect balance. Sweet and warming with such an amazing delicacy. Insanely drinkable for such a high ABV. I battled over and over in my mind if I liked this better than the original BCS (especially the '08 vintage) and it took me a while to decide, but I believe this is top dog. Nevertheless, if its got Bourbon County on the label, you really can't go wrong.","tectactoe","Mar 24, 2013"
4.85,3.4,4.75,4.75,5,4.75,4.75,"Overall, this is an amazing bottle of beer, and remarkable for not only how flavorful, nuanced, and potent it is, but for how utterly smooth and drinkable at the same time. Many high ABV beers end up being vodka or bourbon bombs, but this is so highly polished that it slides seamlessly down the throat, and is dangerously quaffable.

A “Top 5 Beer” for me, which is making typing this difficult because the ABV is kicking in, but this review is worth writing to boast about this unbelievably complex and tasty beer that hides the ABV perfectly and goes down easier than it should. A very high recommendation, buy a bottle of this if you can. It will be worth every penny spent.","CHickman","Mar 23, 2013"

Having had this fresh on tap at Top Hops in NYC, it is a very different beer. The 2012 was hugely coffee forward, and the bourbon was even more present. It was abrasive, but in a great way. I do believe that is what the brewers intended for this beer. Having said that, the 2011, even with the faded coffee, is an awesome beer and super drinkable. I would drink this often, but for very different reasons than BCBS and fresh BCBCS. It's a different animal. Loved it. Thanks again, Brad!","montrealbcr89","Beers"

This is a true sipping beer, what a decadent treat. I'm tackling this bomber alone and it will probably take me near two hours to drink all of it, but I'll savor every sip. Huge thanks again to my good buddy Nick (durb777) for sending this to me. Hopefully I'll get to try BCBS Cherry Rye one day, but for now I'm totally happy just having this, and knowing that I have a few bottles of plain BCBS in the cellar.

The finish was really smooth, and the alcohol was decently hidden. So it was surprisingly easy to drink, but should be sipped.

Aroma offers all the same characteristics of the original (bournon and its barrel, chocolate, a little roastiness) in addition to some coffee beans, which are there but far from being as aggressive or bold as I expected and hoped for. Flavor offered everything the original offered, though perhaps a touch lighter on the bourbon and its barrels, and just a touch of some subtle coffeee. Honestly, were this a blind taste test I do not know if I could have differentiated between this and the original. A great beer but I docked points because I was hoping for a hopped up coffee version of BCBS and I didn't find that here in all honesty. A full, creamy, velvety mouthfeel. Overall, this a great beer. BCBS is a great beer too. I'll take the original version over this as I liked that it has more bourbon and its barrel character than this, but also (and probably more importantly) when you put 'coffee' in the title I go in with certain expectations for the beer (big, bold coffee flavors) and personally felt that this did not deliver in that respect. Still, a fantastic, fantastic beer.","denver10","Mar 01, 2013"

Huge flavor and alcohol, yet so smooth and delicious that you could sip on it all night and not even realize you are drinking a massive 14% beer and you probably won't be able to feel your legs when you stand. This is by far my favorite GI BCS (haven't had my Rare yet, so for now it will remain), the addition of the coffee beans really does this beer well.","mavbrew","Feb 08, 2013"

Tastes litterally identical to bcbs, but with a wee bit of coffee up front, and a bit of a burnt coffee aftertaste, but in a good way. Lots of bourbony goodness, but never overpowering, and a great stouty base. Moutfeel is almost perfect, but if they could take the mouthfeel from Baudenia, and replace it with this, it would be perfect. Overall, great beer, and the third installment of the Bourbon County line that I have had the priviledge of tasting. Only complaint- could use some more coffee, otherwise, it just kinda tastes like the original... which is fine.","Goosey","Jan 24, 2013"

The aroma is a big whiff of booze along with roasted malts, chocolate and vanilla. Not noticing much coffee. The taste is bourbon upfront followed by the coffee. Sweet and boozey but not cloyingly sweet. Vanilla and coffee towards the end. Warming alcohol finish. Honestly, there isn't a huge difference between this one and the regular Bourbon County. You can taste some coffee but there isn't a whole lot. Heavy mouthfeel. $20 for 1 bottle compared to $24 for a 4 pack of Bourbon County makes this a one time buy; maybe pick up a second for the right price to age. Overall, its a damn fine beer but just isn't a major change from the Bourbon County.","PicoPapa","Jan 03, 2013"

A lot of activity on the nose: bourbon, of course, plus a raisin sweetness, and a general dark chocolate roastiness. The coffee has faded a significant amount, but all of the other flavor blend together so well: just a roasty, dark chocolate, decadent treat. It reminds me of drinking a glass of flourless chocolate cake that has been soaking in booze.","ChiPool","Dec 09, 2012"

4.05,-13.6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Served sightly below cellar temp, this beer pours a deep black with a loose, dark tan head that leaves a slight, oily lacing. The head falls flat quickly...and remains down for the count. This beer has an incredibly bold nose with intense notes of wood and vanilla followed by a rich toffee sweetness. The alcohol fades in the nose faster than expected allowing for more of the other flavors to come through. I'm reminded of maple syrup and molasses while drinking. The same bold flavors present in the nose get down and dirty in this syrupy malt base. It's definitely a slow sipper, although the coffee acidity on the back end helps balance out the beer's intense sweetness. To be honest, the bold coffee flavors and aromas I was expecting are not present; instead the coffee helps build body and balance. Overall I wouldnt say that this beer is extraordinarily different than BCBS, except it has greater chocolaty smoothness and drinkability. I'm always blown away by how drinkable this beer is, but I woud have preferred more roasted bean aroma and flavor.","ThePorterSorter","Jul 10, 2012"

I am not a coffee drinker and I think I'd prefer this with at least a year on it to let it settle down a bit. In fact I do have last year's batch as well which I will have to add to this review at some point. I find that I prefer regular BCS over this. Coffee sort of drowns out the complexity and balance of regular BCS.","Dope","Jun 25, 2012"

The aroma is dominated by the coffee but also has some chocolate and a caramel and hints of barrel to round it out quite nicely. The flavor is thick and sweet with a sugary mix of caramel chocolate and coffee. The addition of coffee seems to round out the bourbon and oak of the regular version quite nicely. Thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet creamy sugary mouthfeel. This is a big thick sweet monster of a beer that I thoroughly enjoyed.

The smell is GREAT love BCBS and with the addition of coffee it adds another level to the taste. The beer is like black syrup with little to no head. The smell is of bourbon and espresso orated coffee (huge coffee nose on this one). The taste is outstanding I love what goose island is doing with these beers.

Scent kicks off with a cup of dark roasted coffee, more brewed than bean, solid notes of vanilla combine with semi sweet baking chocolate, solid notes of whiskey and bourbon, some oak, coconut and dark fruit to boot, nicely layered scent but needs to be a bit more aggressive. Taste brings an initial hit of vanilla, sugar and cream before the dark roasted coffee and semi-sweet chocolate hit, strong whiskey and bourbon notes almost take over the palate, but beer smooths into a well layered and blended drink with additional notes of dark fruit, oak and coconut. Full bodied, not as dense despite the stickyness of the beer, lingering sweetness and booze.

As it warms up the coffee mellows out and blends in with the other flavors better. Mouthfeel is pretty full-bodied and a little bit sticky.

Being a relative novice in the craft beer scene (1.2 years and counting) I sometimes miss certain elements of the beer or don't consider other factors, such as mouthfeel, to be as important because I lack the perception. Well, after drinking this brew, I can say I now know the feeling of a great mouthfeel. I have had bc vanilla, bc regular 11', king henry and now this. Bourbon county coffee blows them all away. The nose is rich with bourbon sweetness, a little heat and some subtle coffee and vanilla notes. I am not blown away by booze from the nose which invites me to take a sip. Now, solely comparing the three I have tried, this is by far the best. Smooth as silk, coats the mouth like the vanilla did, but with a wonderful complexity and relatively easy drinkability. the taste rapidly changes almost as it warms each degree. I get smooth bourbon, nice subtle blend of coffee and chocolate. it is not cloying, rather smooth and luscious. When I swirl it in my mouth, huge coffee notes are unleashed at a ferocious rate.

Taste is very good, but I feel like the coffee and bourbon are fighting each other instead of marrying. That being said, it will probably come with age. Mouthfeel is good, but I'd personally like a bit more carbonation (maybe it's just this bottle). Overall, a great beer that I look forward to shelving my extra of and revisit in two years.","b3shine","Feb 01, 2012"

The aromatics off of the beer were the obvious notes of coffee and sweet bourbon, but even beyond that there was a candy like sugar smell and rich sweet milk chocolate aroma on the nose. One of my top beer smells ever. The aromatics amplified my enjoyment of the taste as well. The flavors were of a bourbon dark chocolate syrup to the point were I might consider this a dessert beer. The coffee is smooth and dosen't add really any bittering notes to beer what-so-ever. For something with dark chocolate, bourbon and coffee beans that is considered able to age for up to 5 years, this is smooth as heck right now. If it wasn't for the high ABV, I would have no problem drinking this all day long. Overall it was a great beer one of the best I've ever had the good fortune of trying.","Vdubb86","Jan 30, 2012"

The smell is the only thing I scored under 4.5 mostly because I was hoping for a bit of a stronger coffee aroma. I smelled the sweetness of the aged bourbon more than the coffee especially as it warmed. This isn't necessarily a bad thing and still warranted a 4.0 because it smells amazing. When I finally decided it was time to taste this beer I was overwhelmed by what was going on. You get a great coffee note up front. This blends its way into an almost vanilla like bourbon sweetness. The back end is where the barrel really shines and you can taste the bourbon and wood with some lingering coffee taste still peeking though. It's definetly not as strong of a coffee flavor as one might think. Get your hands on a bottle and please drink it fresh! I see far to many year old reviews of this beer where people talk about its lack of coffee... this isn't something to age unless you have had it fresh once and want to see what it turns into.","PlinytheFarter","Beers"

They increased the alcohol to 14% this year, and I still get no alcohol burn. I suspect the bourbon flavor hides it, but either way, it is impressive.","kif","0"

4.36,-7,3.5,5,4,4.5,4.5,"Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout pours total black. Nigel Tufnel might say that it could be none more black. Three fingers of mocha foam rise up to crown the beer. Head retention is very good, but lacing is pretty much nonexistent. The nose is absolutely fantastic, I don't think I could ask for anything more. Rich milk chocolate, fresh brewed coffee, and smooth bourbon each jump out of the glass, no aroma dominating, but all of them quite pungent. The flavor doesn't quite live up the expectations set by the out of this world aroma. The milk chocolate aspect of the beer appears at the open, but fades quickly. That leaves the coffee, and a bourbon flavor that has a bit more bite than the nose would have led me to expect. The body is very full, with a perfectly subtle carbonation. The mouthfeel just doesn't have that creamy edge that would have completed the picture though. Almost two years later I'm impressed by how much coffee presence is left in Bourbon County Coffee Stout, and I'm looking forward to the next batch of this excellent bourbon barrel aged stout.","axeman9182","Jan 03, 2012"

A thin coaster of light brown bubbles manifests itself atop the beer, then dissipates leaving a thin ring around the outside of the glass. The nose is coffee and char with some malt sweetness poking through. Taste opens with sweet roasted malt flavors. Coffee and oak follow in copious amounts. Caramel and vanilla, presumably from the barrel, fill out the flavor profile. Finish is dry with a very nice coffee aftertaste. The beer is full bodied. Thick and viscous with a low level of carbonation. This is a great coffee stout. The barrel has imparted a wonderfully complex melange of oak, vanilla, and caramel which compliments the coffee and roasted malt perfectly. Booze is almost undetectable, and at 13% that's saying something. Really enjoyed this one. Recommended.","Sideswipe","Nov 04, 2011"

I had another bottle of this about 6 months ago, and the strong coffee presence went perfectly with the sweet vanilla bourbon flavor.

Very dark coffee overlaid on the boozy bourbon helps bring the booziness down a touch, intermingled with chocolate, roasted malts, molasses. Yum. This integrates really well. The mouthfeel is really huge and viscous, with lower carbonation. This is really a fantastic beer.

Melts on the tongue, very nice coating of the palate, very delectble brew. Coffee notes were very subtle, I wouldnt have known it was a coffee beer had it not been for the label.

Unfortunately, no big, brown, beautiful lips here, so I'm left to just sip this one, which I'm perfectly happy with, because it is definitely a sipper. The 13% ABV, while not nearly as harsh as a year ago, is still very present. I'm definitely feeling a little warmth as I drink it. A great way to spend a couple of hours.

I thought the aroma were closer to a nice scotch from the Islay than a bourbon.

Palate is rich and smooth, nice alcohol warmth. Excellent.","Luk13","Aug 03, 2011"

It looks pretty well carbonated and lively, with a constant stream of fine bubbles. The first thing that hit me was the bourbon, the smell is strong boozy bourbon with lots of woody vanilla. I got a bit of that roasted coffee bean smell but it is much more subtle than I was expecting. The first taste was a bitter dark chocolate, with the same heavily booze bourbon that was on the nose. Towards the end the coffee begins to assert itself with a fairly mellow medium bitter taste. There is definitely some vanilla sweetness in there and a slight toffee flavour. It produces a nice warming whisky-like alcohol finish, which I find the best part of all the Bourbon County Brand Stouts.","PartyBear","Jul 12, 2011"

Tastes of Sweet coffee up front, followed by the little hint of fruitiness, and finishes with a sort of vanilla booze. Goes down pretty darn good for its 13 percent abv.

Tastes like a regular BCS, with the exception of a faint coffee wave in the back of your palate. Also get to taste the vanilla and the boozy bourbon/oak. When drinking, BCBCS leaves a sheath of oily bourbony coffee-y(now i'm coining that!) goodness in your mouth. Very easy to drink, not too hot at all, for the big beer that it is.

It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty tasty brew. As hinted by others some of the coffee aspect has definitely faded on this one sitting in my cellar, however, with me not drinking coffee at all it is still definitely present for myself. I really liked the toffee aspect I got on this one to add a little sweetness to the roastiness you get with the dark chocolate and coffee present. Really glad I got to pull this one out of the cellar for the tasting I was planning on doing myself someday, but getting to share it with some awesome BAs at the same time.

4.85,3.4,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Pours pitch black, tan head with minimal retention. Leaves a collar of head. No lacing, but has legs for days. Nose is bourbon, dark chocolate, oak, a hint of vanilla but not a significant amount of coffee. I suspect it has faded, over a year since it's bottling. Taste has some warming bourbon, oak, vanilla, more oak and more friggin bourbon. Finishes dry and roasty, and the chocolate and espresso notes don't really come through until late in the finishes. Layers upon layers of flavour and complexity here, just unreal. More keeps coming through well after the sip is over. Alcohol is mellowed and the body is so full. Low carbonation, minimal alcohol burn and aids in its drinkability. A real sipper, but drinks like a charm. Extremely impressive, and I'd be very curious to try this fresh with more 'coffee.' This set a new bourbon barrel standard for me.","liamt07","Apr 14, 2011"

The coffee is unfortunately undetectable and I probably would not have even picked up on it at all had I not expected to find it somewhere. Really the only way I can tell that this beer has coffee in it is the fact that it's not quite as sweet as its non-coffee counterparts. I know the coffee may have faded some, but I've had other bbal coffee stouts with a year of age and could still detect the coffee. The bourbon again dominates the flavor and the nose like it does in the other Bourbon County series. Not a bad beer, but I would need much more balance in it to call it good.","n2185","0"

There is a very evident alcohol residue coming down the sides of the glass after swirling. The aroma is big bold vanilla and mocha aromas. some bitter espresso notes and some bourbon, but much more subdued bourbon than the regular bcbs. This really seems balanced and i can pick up the coffee easily. Great caramel or toffee sweetness on the aromas too. The taste is simply balanced. Really nice coffee integrated into the deep malty and chocolate body. Great bourbon integration and not a smack over the face with the bourbon this time around. Great dry finish on this, though it does have some serious booze coming through on the back end. Not perfect, but near perfection on this bourbon barrel aged stout. Mouthfeel is great to. It has a nice level of carbonation that really works well with this brew as its low carbonated. This is a definite sipper, though it is something that would be better shared than drank on its own, its still easy to put back. Worth seeking out for sure.","Augustiner719","Jan 16, 2011"

The beer is black, with very thin layer of head that dissipates into thin lacing. This however simply looks rich. Smell that bourbon! The nose is right up front with a big bourbon, hints of caramel and vanilla and a rich aroma of bitter espresso. The smell is very balanced, the bourbon and the coffee have really compliment one another, still not overpowering anything and letting other aromas shine through. The taste follows the smell wonderfully, starts nicely with bourbon and finishes with a nice bitter coffee flavor. Dark malts, caramel, oak and vanilla entwine themselves in the mix. The mouthfeel is heavy and chewy with a silky texture and subtle carbonation. A bit of a sipper, but certainly something I would enjoy again.

In that regard, it can be somewhat of a challenge to drink quickly, but then that's not the point. The point is to enjoy this beer slowly over the course of an hour or two, lingering and appreciating every sip. In that regard, it makes perfect sense and has very good drinkability.

4.35,-7.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Reviewed from my notes. Split with BlessedBeBeer. The BCBCS is a dark brown beer. It has a great brown foam head; very thick and pretty. There are a lot of scents in the aroma. I can detect sweet malt, dark chocolate and bourbon. It also has a very complex flavor. I can taste two kinds of chocolate, milk and dark. Ther eis also a lot of bourbon. The alcohol provides a very sharp finish. This is a full-bodied, creamy beer. It has medium/high levels of carbonation. There is a hot alcohol burn when you swallow, but it's pleasant. Personally, I like that trait in a good bourbon barrel aged stout. For what this is, it is pretty drinkable. Some age on a bottle would temper the heat from the alcohol and would probably improve this already great beer. Consuming the entire 22oz bottle would not be difficult, but I wouldn't want any more than that in a sitting. Still, this is a great one to share. Try it if you can.","ToasterChef","Aug 10, 2010"

There's some brown sugar and vanilla that come out as the bourbon is subdued.

Excellent lacing, and dense looking body, no surprise given BCS well deserved reputation. I'm a bit disappointed by the aroma, it's good, don't get me wrong, but I love a powerful (and delicious) coffee aroma in my coffee stouts, and while its there, this beer is just so big, it doesn't come through the same way some of a big favorites do. A heated alcohol somewhat masks the coffee... not to mention bourbon. The taste certainly falls in line with the aroma.There is sweet molasses and chocolate sweetness up front with bourbon and coffee (nicely paired with with some heavily roasted malts) coming out more as it warms up and primarily in the finish. Much like BCS, the mouthfeel is thick and creamy, wonderful. Excellent beer, I wish I had more than one, as I'd love to age it, but I fear further loss of coffee in aging, so I had to drink it reasonably soon. I would love for the intense heat to subside, so that some of the other characteristics could come through further.

It pours a beastly pitch black topped by about a finger of fizzy, dark tan foam, which, sadly, dies away rather quickly. The nose comprises oak, bourbon, coffee, light vanilla, and nothing else. Period. For something this big, I expected more than this. The taste holds notes of dark roasted malts, a shit-ton of bourbon, oak, chocolate, light vanilla, light coffee, and a tiny bit o' bitterness. Honestly, I felt that, like the normal BCS, the bourbon was kinda overpowering, and, in this case, the coffee was strangely, haphazardly tossed into the trunk and forgotten until a few days into the vacation, by which time the sunburn is so bad that the sunscreen in the bag has been rendered pointless. You know what I mean? Simply put: too much bourbon, not enough coffee; good, but disappointing to say the least.

It's a little cleaner, fresher, more rounded, and more ""full"" than the original GIBCS, if that makes sense, with the coffee addition doing a lot of good - smoothing out the body, filling in the malt base, cutting down on the alcohol heat in places - but also necessarily having its downsides (the increased slickness and thinning out of the body foremost, in my opinion). Definitely worth seeking out, though I wish they offered it in the 12 oz. bottles like the original - 22 oz. is tough for this one, especially if you're doing it on your own!

The aroma is lots and lots of bourbon, oak, coffee, raisin and bitter chocolate. I was worried after the nose that the bourbon barrel would overpower the other flavors but it did not. The main progression of flavors was fairly linear to me with a few subtleties that are harder to place. The main progression goes bourbon, dark chocolate syrup, bitterness from the hops, then coffee followed by a lingering coffee aftertaste that's nearly indistinguishable from the aftertaste of a good cup of coffee. Subtleties throughout of anise, oak, and some dark fruitiness that is raisin-like as in the nose. Feel is creamy, thick, and warming but just not quite thick enough for a 5. While probably not a good idea I would have no problem polishing off an entire bomber of this stuff, something I don't say too often about big beers like this.

I thought this beer was brewed with top notch Intelligentsia Black Cat Espresso. Taste is of more bourbon with slight creme'd sugar and lactose. Can I get some toasty malt or some hops in this, please? Taking another whiff of this, I get cheap vanilla extract with more milk chocolate (hence the lactoce again). The body is rich and full without any stickyness. Finish is one dimensional with bourbon straight through. I hardly want another sip.

Thick coating of lacing recedes back into the liquid after each sip. The aroma is everything you hope for in a coffee infuses, barrel-aged stout. Each element is equally balanced. I smell whole bean, freshly roasted coffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, chocolate, and alcohol. The flavor is almost equally awesome. It only falls short because of the alcohol heat. Coffee flavor that is almost the best I have had in a beer. The barrel-aging lends bourbon, vanilla, and woody notes. Still a substantial stout under all the other flavors and that is very important. Awesome thick, chewy, and creamy body. The best of Goose Island stouts is still evident in this beer. A great beer that I will need to find another bottle and age for awhile. A relatively good value as well, I could see several local breweries selling this for $10 more a bottle.","morimech","0"

4.35,-7.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours into a snifter an extremely viscous, thick oily pitch black. Hard pour produces a light tan thin bubbly head that quickly fades to nothing and no lacing as expected for this style of beer. Aroma is primarily composed of cocoa and bourbon and not quite as much coffee as expected though that becomes stronger as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is near perfect as expected from experience with the original BCS. Extremely thick, chewy and smooth with light carbonation and an endlessly lasting finish. The flavor has a much strong bourbon presence than expected, but it is much smoother and balanced than a fresh bcs is and the coffee becomes more obvious as the beer warms and the longer you savor the taste on the palate. Flavor also gains vanilla and molasses like sweetness that lasts long through the finish. I was expecting much more of a coffee presence from this and from this sample I'm much more optimistic about aging this beer.

Alcohol becomes apparent in the mid-palate, at a harmonious level with the rest of the flavors, lending a sharpness that balances the initial sweetness.

4.37,-6.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a thick, oily black color, with a thin cap of mocha foam. Initial aromas of dark chocolate truffles, bourbon, vanilla and dark fruit, although rich coffee aromas become more prominent as it warms. Flavors of bourbon and oak, chocolate covered espresso beans. Nice creamy mouthfeel, with perfect carbonation and a lingering warming alcohol presence. An outstanding beer.","emmasdad","May 09, 2010"

I was lucky enough to snag a single bottle of this today at Bermans in Lexington; thanks for setting it aside for me. With a motor oil like consistency, this beer pours out pitch black with just a lacing for heading. Nose is very rich with coffee, espresso, chocolate and molasses. The taste is pretty much the exact same, and when I say rich, that is exactly what I mean. Very slick on the tongue, and again, like motor oil. The alcohol is masked somewhat by all of the big flavors, which makes for an interesting drinking experience. Is the hype deserved? Yeah I suppose so. Get your bottle today if you see some.","jamie2dope","May 06, 2010"

I'm so glad I have never given a perfect score to any beer before, because none comes close to this. I first sampled this at WhiskyFest in Chicago, where there was no shortage of extraordinary beverages, and this one blew them out of the water. It helps that the alcohol presence is incredibly mild for a beer this strong. As someone who likes the regular BCS better fresh, I can't see enjoying this a great deal more with age. Glad I still have a few bottles to savor. Completely deserving of my first perfect score.","ommegoose","May 04, 2010"
