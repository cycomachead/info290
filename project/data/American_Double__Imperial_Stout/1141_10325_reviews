review_text
"After having it on tap I considered seeking asylum in Canada.  So imagine my excitement after bringing the legal allowable limit back into the states to be rationed out until my next possible visit.  Alas once having it on tap, the bottle version was a let down.  While unfair to compare it to the tap version I will forever feel that slight pang of heartache upon the first sip from the bottle ... well of the beer, poured from the bottle."
"Looks like a black abyss. Strong, pleasant aroma. Bitter coffee aftertaste; could be more refined, but very smooth for a strong stout."
"this beer makes me proud to be Canadian. Incredible nose, the sweetness, the coffee, the chocolate. Unbelievable. A great beer to share with non beer geeks - i guarantee you will blow their minds. I have never met anyone that did not love this beer. Not saying it's the best but it's damn close for me."

"Overall : Warming good craft without the elegance. Overly spicy, slightly stale, missing some body, and not very accessible. Overhyped in my opinion."

"It just isnt FBS pretty close but no..."
"Overall - A sold stout, though one I may not repeat."
"Enjoy"

"The alcohol is well hidden; while this is definitely a sipper, one could have several of these before unceremoniously falling off a bar stool."

"12oz bottle poured into stout snifter. This beer is black with highlights of cola at the edges. A gentle pour yielded a thin head that receded to a ring. Dots of lace are left behind as the beer is consumed. Aroma is of roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate. Taste is bitter espresso, dark cherries, some vanilla, unsweetened chocolate, and a smoky/roasty malts. On the low end of full body, creamy and thick texture, soft carbonation, and a long bitter finish."

"This is one of the best imperial stouts I've tasted. You will enjoy it if you like a bold stout with coffee flavors. It is complex, and every time I drink it, I get something new. Definitely a beer to drink again. The more I drink it, the more I like it. One of my favorites."

"Nice dark colour; it's well balanced with a tinge of alcohol with a nice coffee feel. It's really understated but well balanced."

"OMG!! What an impressive imperial stout this is! Coffee and dark roasts are in the smell and flavor. An overall hardy mouthfeel. You know you are drinking an imperial stout the second it gently rolls over your taste buds. Everything improves as it warms in your snifter. It was disappointing to see the bottom of the glass. This stout shall be forever in my ""wants""."

"is an intensely black and dense beer with very pronounced roasted flavours. Fair trade coffee is infused during the brewing process, intensifying the bitterness of the beer and giving it a powerful coffee taste. Péché mortel is brewed to be savored"

"O: [4] Where some IPAs might be a ""hop bomb"" this is a ""coffee bomb"".  I like coffee stouts - but this was almost too one dimensional.  I wish there were some hints of chocolate or roasted malts.  The mouthfeel is very good - but the nose and taste lacked depth beyond the coffee.  I thought I would be burned out by the coffee, at the end, but it actually tasted better as I reached the end.  I think this nudge it up a fraction."

"In the end it feels a bit.. over-roasted (not totally burnt, but close to it), so there's a bit of unpleasantness stuck down the throat, but the dark chocolate at the start of every new sip helps you get past that. Excelent."

"O: Fantastic coffee stout - I would argue this pretty close to being on par with the likes of Founder's Breakfast Stout. Drinks well below its 9.5% ABV - smooth, roasty, altogether delicious. A fantastic beer for brunch (if you're into that kind of thing) or served as a nightcap. Recommended."

"I've had this from a bottle a couple of times but to have it on-tap was a rare treat, as it transformed into something even more special.  If you see it at a bar or at the Dieu du Ciel brewpub and are a fan of big stouts, do not hesitate to give it a try."
""
"If you can get your hands on this, get as much as you can!"
""
""
""
"O:  A great stout, but expensive at $10, nearly a $1 an ounce.  At that price, you would think it would be BA.  So many other stouts, that are more reasonably priced and just as good."

"Pours a midnight black with a beautiful two finger mocha head. It smells like freshly brewed espresso, bakers chocolate, and darkly roasted grains. There is also a very big freshly ground espresso bean note, like the smell when you open up your coffee grinder and that dusty, intense coffee aroma flows in to your nostrils. The taste follows the nose, with intense, oily black espresso at the front. There is a light amount of sweetness to make sure the bitter coffee doesn't overwhelm. The beer is nicely carbonated and body is not quite full... The mouth feel is perfect for the delivery of the flavors. The astringency is spot on. This is a world class beer; try as hard as you can to get a taste. It's by far the best imperial coffee stout I've tasted."

"In the Coffee Stout category this one fires on all cylinders. No weaknesses this is indeed world class and one of the best I've ever tasted."

"I was excited to try such a lauded beer during my time in Montreal. This is a stout with many of my favorite qualities of an IPA. It was quite bitter, but had a lot of flavor to back up the bitterness. And that flavor was complex, with prominent coffee as well as a smoky taste. This is an excellent beer, and brewery, that you should seek out if you have the chance."

"Overall a solid beer but I prefer FBS/FIS/BGBW"

"D: A sipper brew for sure with its thicky thickness and intense dark roast rich with mocha flavors. The coffee does seem a bit stale at times but it is a nuanced addition to the beer and not center stage which is appreciated. Not really sure why I don’t pick this one up more often. Well worth seeking out. Would love to try the BA version."

"Jet black in color with a faint wisp of khaki colored head surrounding the edge of the glass. Intense aroma of coffee is prominent with roasted barley taking a back seat. The flavor is an assault of dark coffee and dark roasted barley. This is foremost a coffee beer and secondarily it is an imperial stout. This flavor is truly amazing. The mouth is thick and chewy."

"O: Great expression of an imperial coffee stout. The drying finish and lack of sweetness really accentuate the roasted notes of the malt and the bitter espresso character. I prefer a bit more balance in my imperial stouts in regards to residual sugar and a bit more sweetness, which makes me think that I would LOVE the bourbon barrel version. Still a fantastic beer, and I'll definitely grab it again whenever I see it."

"Overall, this beer delivers some of the best coffee and chocolate flavors that I've had in a stout. The coffee even brings a bit of cherry to the table. But the whole experience seems a bit thin and boozy, and at times bitter and astringent. There's a strange abrasiveness around the edges, especially when juxtaposed with the utterly smooth and luxurious flavors that are found elsewhere in this beer. Hmm, I'm conflicted but I find myself getting past the boozy bitterness and really enjoying the dark fruit/cherry center."

"O: I love this beer. I pick one of these up quite often because it's an outstanding beer at a very reasonable price. It's actually quite hard to beat such high quality at this price point. The beer looks and feels great but falls short due to low carbonation. The smell and taste are just superb giving a very balanced coffee/chocolate bitterness. I would love to see how this beer improves with a nice long slumber in a bourbon barrel and perhaps a bit more carbonation, because that may be close to fives across the board. I will definitely be drinking many more of these in my day and am very pleased with how easy it is to acquire/what it doesn't do to my wallet."

I am very into how in check the alcohol is with all that this beer has going on. It does not overwhelm you with boozy flavors it just seduces you in to the rich deep body and flavor and gives you a warm embrace. It is best at cellar temperature and could do well aging I am sure. I will get this again!!"

"Pours a hazy very dark brown, one finger thick creamy light brown head. Settles slowly to  a thin cap, rings down the glass. Smell: big espresso... caramel, dark fruit, dark chocolate moderate roast and earth, slight smoke; plum, brown bread. Taste: dark chocolate, plenty roasted with caramel gone a little burnt, in the back soft overripe pear sweetness and plum skin; lots of earthiness. Velvet feel. World class coffee stout... all of the coffee, all of the stout, all delicious."
"Finished off an evening of dining and beer tasting with this one. Poured into a tulip. Nearly opaque with small brownish head that dissipates quickly. Roasted malt and fresh brewed coffee aroma. Taste is of roasted malt with coffee that lingers after the malt disappears. Overall a perfect beer to end the meal...like having an espresso after dessert."

"Poured from the bottle into a pub glass at Kawa espresso bar here in Calgary. Basically pitch black, opaque with no trace of light refraction or other sources of color other than the light brown sponge-toffee like head. Aroma is surprisingly vinous and fruity, with some caramel, dates and red wine along with the more-expected burnt coffee and singed grain elements. This beer is extremely well-regarded and I now understand the hype. There is none of the overpoweringly burnt flavor reminiscient of a dry ashtray that one can get with less well-crafted coffee stouts. The coffee flavor is bold and rich but balanced by caramel, milk chocolate, pecan, almond nougat, and red wine notes, and the coffee itself comes across like a smooth cappucino as opposed to gnarly, abrasive instant crystals. Features a moderately syrupy body, a silky smooth mouthfeel adds to the cappucino effect, and the carbonation is decidedly low-key. Finishes dry and spicy, with a little faint ash that does not detract and some black pepper. The fruity sweetness continues to linger for some time as well. The coffee features prominently but is checked just enough by fruit, nut, and caramel notes to avoid any nastiness. Wonderful beer and the best coffee stout I've yet to sample."
""
"O- this beer is huge, and I love it. A bit too much alcohol on the palate though."
""
"Had on nitro tap at the brewery on recommendation, silky smooth head, delicious with a even smooth carbonation. Taste is more towards delicious espresso, dark chocolate, dark cherries, towards the end there is building roasty bitterness, very tasty. The mouthfeel on nitro is sublimely smooth and prompted me to up my rating."
""
""
"A nice coffee stout that I'd be happy to drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Suprise find at flying saucer, pour a rich roasted coffee color.  Hints of malt coffee and chocolate in the nose.  Smooth hight viscosity mouthfeel with strong chocolate and coffee but well balanced, mild bitterness on the finish.  Awesome beer but smell does not do it full justice."

"Pours a dark brown with a very attractive mocha head. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, light cherries and a bit of cream. Sweet, creamy flavour with lots of coffee, some chocolate and hints of dark fruits as it warms.

I feel like it has the fermentation profile, velvety smoothness, and subtle sweetness of some American-made, Belgian-style stouts I've tried, but the coffee and roast flavors seem genuinely American.... whatever, doesn't matter, why label? - this is a kick-ass creation!"

"Poured from bottle into tulip glass. Deep, dark brown/black color. Initially, a 1-inch thick tan foamy head, which dissipated somewhat abruptly, yet leaving a collar with innumerable tiny bubbles and fine, sticky, beige lacing throughout the experience. The coffee scent jumped from the bottle and was noticeable even from a distance within moments after hitting the glass. Upon further inspection, roasted chocolate with notes of licorice and cinnamon spice were apparent, all of which were replicated on the palate at first sip. A little more carbonation than expected (based on the nose), while subtle hints of vanilla & coconut emerged. A little more sweetness and a little less bitter carbonation (a la BCBS and KBS) would make this stout truly special. Still, a very fine example of the style."

"Overall, a very good take on the coffee imperial stout style. As far as I'm concerned, the taste is the star of the show, but beer is for drinking, after all. If you are going to get one component of your beer right, might as well make it the taste. I will probably continue to pick bottle of this here or there as I run across them, as it's really quite good."

"an amazing stout, worthy of its high status, but i almost like aphrodite more, with the vanilla and cocoa nibs. the coffee in this one is robust, rich and thick, wildly bitter, but still in reasonable proportion to the stout, in other words, it still tastes like a beer above coffee. deep dark brown in color, dense, and showing very little light. an inch of creamy mocha foam, like the top of a good espresso. the drink starts out with that coffee bitterness which transitions into malt bitterness from the dark barley. its not overly complex, but it doesnt need to be, and i think thats part if its charm, its simplicity and streamlined elegance for being such a big stout. alcohol is entirely absent from the flavor profile too. it has a hit of sweetness to balance the bitter right before the finish, and a clean finish for what this is. dense texture but somehow soft in feel, again, like properly made espresso. full bodied, just enough carbonation. overall an incredibly satisfying stout, expertly made, and brought home for a very reasonable price. i wish this was available on the market all the time. rich and delicious."

Rounded off with an awesome mouthfeel and good head retention for a beer of this style. Highly recommended for fans of coffee stouts. Would love to try this fresh or once it’s been aged in a barrel."

"This is an excellent, smooth, creamy, and tasty coffee stout. The coffee is smoother, if not exactly more subtle, than in beers like FBS. This could easily work as a breakfast or dessert stout, as the coffee works for the former, and the sweetness for the latter."
"Overall this is a world class brew, espresso is awesome, lots of flavor layers going on and a delightful feel to it. Worth every penny - treat yourself to this if you can find it."

"this seems to be a stout that doesn't get the attention it deserves. Aroma is ridiculous, coffee, chocolate, dark fruits, and more coffee. This is actually is some ways, more impressive than bourbon county, just that it's so incredibly bold without being overwhelming. This is a fantastic stout, a MUST try. If you like stouts, this should rank in your top 5, beer snobs included."

"An impeccable beer and absolutely wonderful for when it's cold or looking for something to relax you. I only wish this was at least a seasonal beer instead of a rotating one."
""
""
""
"O- one of the best coffee stouts I've ever had, the coffee and chocolate lingers on the palate long after the finish. The meshing of coffee and chocolate is up there with FBS and I find myself continually sniffing the glass. This is an amazing beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One thing that strikes me is how smooth and creamy the mouthfeel is. Really feels like a dessert beer here on the tongue. Taste wise, it definitely has the coffee in bunches there and the typical dark chocolate notes...but what I'm struck by is how pleasantly sweet the beer is. There aren't any real bitter notes to speak of here....it isn't really roasted....it's just smooth, creamy, and rather sweet. So tasty, this is what I wish coffee stouts were ALWAYS like!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The taste is like the aroma with a dark malty character, mild sweetness, and more earthy bitterness at the end. You wouldn't know this to be a 9.3% ABV beer because the alcohol is non-existent. Yet while is has some good Impy Stout characters it is definitely not in your face."

"Overall: I have passed this up o the shelf many times at one of my local beer spots and absolutely will not ever do it again. It isn't my favorite imperial stout but definitely hits the top five.Chuck the money and buy a bottle....Salud!"

"Impressive big coffee and dark chocolate aroma and flavors combine with a velvety mouthfeel. A world class breakfast stout."

"O - 4.75 - This is a great imperial stout and has is unique. It does have a lot of coffee flavor, which is obviously the whole point. Great beer"
"Pours a beautiful thick black with a tiny tan head, good lacing. Smell is coffee upfront with some chocolate notes. Taste is coffee, but not as bitter as a lot of coffee stouts. I also get some milk chocolate and vanilla. Silky and smooth. Full bodied with a low amount of carbonation that works well with this beer. Overall excellent stout worth seeking out."

""
""
""
""
"Found a 12oz bottle of Peche Mortel at a local high quality bottle shop in San Francisco. Poured into a snifter, the brew had no head whatsoever, and amazed me with its pure thick dark black color. Carbonation is medium-strong and offers contrast to the thickness of the beer. Peche Mortel smells like espresso more than it smells like beer. No strong recognizable hop aromas come through, just the beautiful dense smell and flavor of pure dark chocolate and espresso. The beer truly hides the 9.5% alcohol well, even while warming. Toffee is also the only recognizable third flavor besides chocolate and coffee. This is a deep dark imperial espresso blast; a complex offering that is a peak example of the style."
"O-This is a very good beer, but perhaps because my expectations for this brew were high, I felt a bit let-down. The coffee flavors are nice, but a bit dull and metallic when compared against the best of the style. On the other hand, the balance between coffee and beer is nice and unlike some beers, you don't feel like your drinking charred, bitter coffee grounds."

"Damn good beer. I stuck one in the cellar, but I'm questioning whether that's really necessary. Not sure of the age on this one. Can't imagine it's too old. This beer is brilliantly bold. The name, when translated, means ""mortal sin."" I heard a person say once, ""If you don't love your sin, you're not doing it right."" I love this sin."

"Pours inky black with small tan head. No retention and not much lacing to speak of. Aroma redolent of coffee and cocoa. Beautiful aroma. Dark roasted coffee dominates the palate. Lots of dark, toasty notes on the tongue, bitter but not harsh. Hints of vanilla, dark cherries, and licorice come through mid-palate through to the finish.  Nicely complex and exceptionally smooth. Nice warming from the alcohol. Medium bodied with little carbonation. Overall, an extremely well crafted and balanced stout."

"O: First of all, I don't care for it and I would not have it again. This is a perfect example of Personal Taste. I don't really get the rave reviews. I like Deschutes Black Butte Porter but this is not a style that I will probably gravitate to."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is as full of body as it is flavor. Balanced and enjoyable until the very end. I would go as far as to say that this is one of the best coffee stouts I have had that has not been aged in a barrel."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a deep, pitch black, with a thin ring of tan head. The body is deep and beautiful, an obsidian gem, but the lack of any real head is slightly disappointing. Scents of coffee, roast malt, chocolate and slight soy sauce. A nose that is quite coffee heavy, predicting the beer's flavor. Flavors of black coffee, espresso and roast malt. Slight undertones of dark chocolate and cocoa powder. The black coffee and roast malt biterness linger on the aftertaste The flavors greatly increase in intensity as the beer warms, becoming very rich and satisfying. It's incredibly forward on the coffee and roasted malt, which is excellent. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with moderate carbonation, quite a good sipper, despite it's 9.5% ABV there is no alcohol warmth present. A very good feel, silky, thick and satisfying. Overall this is an amazing Imperial Stout, showcasing it's coffee overtones above all else. It does doing an excellent job at showcasing the rich, deep flavor of quality coffee mingled with the roasted malt of a fine stout. Highly recommended."
""
"- Overall a quality beverage, no doubt, but also too bitter/unbalanced. I can imagine the barrel age ones add a lot to balance the coffee and provide complexity."

I love this beer, and wish it was more available in the States. If your a coffee lover this is the beer for you. The alcohol in this one being at 9.5% is no where to be seen. Highly recommend this."

"Delicious coffee stout. The coffee may be a bit too strong for some, but as a man who loves his coffee black like the devil's soul, this is a fantastic beer. Its price point ($5.99 for a 12oz bottle) makes it a once-in-a-while treat, but it is certainly a delicious treat."

"I had always heard about this stuff and wondered if it was really as good as everyone says. Short answer... yes, it is. It's fabulous. If you're a coffee lover and addict, like myself, then you need to treat yourself with this beer. The coffee element is nearly second to none with it's excellent aroma, flavor, and layered characteristics. Definitely one of the top coffee stouts I've had to date."

"Drink them instead of the crappy Henniken they serve at the festival."
"O-Improved as it warmed, but it could have used some slight chocolate/vanilla flavors to make this beer amazing."
"It doesn’t get much better than this. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a glass. Immediate notes of coffee. This thing smells and taste like coffee but in a great way. One of the best coffee stouts I have ever had. Also get notes of a toasty chocolate. Pours dark black with a decent head. highly recommend"
""
""
""
""

"Pours deep brown to black with a small mocha head. Aroma of big spicy earthy coffee, roasted malt, and hints of chocolate. Taste is big coffee with a nice sweetness and balancing bitter, lingering cocoa and espresso on the palate and a big roast presence. Heavy but not syrupy and the perfect solid medium carbonation. Maybe could use a bit more body, but this is very drinkable for an impy. Nice brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a beer that should never be forgotten in the midst of so many bigger and supposedly better beers. A true world class effort that I'm always happy to find on a shelf. Now, to make myself a hypocrite and find the bourbon barrel-aged version!"
""
""
"Overall, it's bordering on perfection across the board. While it's high in ABV, it's easy to drink, mostly because it's so good. The alcohol is well-hidden, but just present enough to let you know it's a manly beer. Really an exceptional beer."
"MF – A smooth start, a little fizzy on the palate. Medium bodied, but thinner than expected (-). Medium-dry finish."

"Peche Mortel is a stout of the highest quality. I don't drink coffee very often but I love me a good coffee infused beer. This is one if not the best coffee infused beer I've ever had. Not only that but it's one of the best stouts I've ever expierenced. I only wish I had a few more bottles sitting aside. This is a must try lie, cheat, or steal do whatever it takes to get yourself a bottle of Peche Mortel."
""
"Peche Mortel pours a very dark color, being virtually black with a tan colored head from a brown 11.5 ounce bottle. It smells intensely like coffee. The flavor is coffee, so much so that I want to look at it to make sure it's beer and not coffee. If you like coffee and you like beer, this is the beer for you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a dark black color with a finger width light brown foamy head. Huge coffee aromas, I love it. Roasted malts and some cocoa as well. Big coffe flavors on every sip. Dark chocolate comes through as well. Awesome flavors all around. Some alcohol heat comes through too. Full bodied but a bit thin on the back end of the to gut. Sticky on the finish as well. A great coffee brew!!"
""
""
""

"Overall - This is a great stout with very prominent flavors on a great malt backbone and really nice mouthfeel. The best beer I've had out of Canada to date"

"Overall: Great stout, found the last bottle in my local shop, lucky to have picked it up. This one will knock your socks off."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not quite FBS tier but its close. A very impressive coffee infused imp stout and one that is super easy to drink. However, the price point is a bit high. Still, if this was available regularly around me i'd more than happily consume it regularly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slick black with a fuzzy, tan-colored head. It smells like chocolate, big roasted malts, but hardly any coffee. The taste is similar. The roasted malts really take over the beer. Dark, bitter chocolate, burnt toast, strong bitterness, slight coffee vibes. As it warms, the coffee starts to come out more. There’s not a huge amount of depth but the flavors work very well here. Mouthfeel is decent, but not as good as it could be – there might be a little too much carbonation…it feels a little harsh with all the bitter roasted malts. This is still a very solid imperial stout."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Admittedly, I still prefer Aphrodisiaque to Péché Mortel, though I was very happy to have given this a good aging to perfect it. This beer has a lot of complex flavours that were drowned out by the alcohol last time. Wish I would have aged a few more."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: This is one I'd definitely buy again. However; if I'm looking for a big coffee taste this one is a bit more hidden, melded in with the flavors of the beer itself. Definitely a complex beer and one you should check out."
""
""
""

"An amazing imperial stout from DDC. The bottle says bottled on January 2013, so it's only about half a year old. Tastes nice - though I'm hoping to age a few bottles for a few years and see how it improves, hopefully with the alcohol burn gone. Great beer."

"O - Awesome version of this style. Now one of my faves. Too bad it took me too long to try this one. Highly recommended for I.S.lovers."
"Palate is like drinking an espresso/stout shandy. Very dominant coffee flavor but very well done. Too often the coffee can taste off or stale if the flavor is too heavy but the coffee part of this stout tastes just as nice as the stout. Other flavors of chocolate, pine and roasty malts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is easily one of the best coffee beers out there, and it's not even barrel aged to add additional flavor. I could, and would, drink a lot of this."
"Atmosphere is pretty damn good. Dark intimidating hue, slight bubbly head, and some spotty lacing. Nose is full on roasted grains and coffee beans, chocolate, and licorice, all with a little bit of an oaky character. Tastes like it smells. Very well-balanced combination of roasted grains and espresso, accentuated with a hint of bittersweet dark chocolate, and bitter licorice. Thick and hearty, yet soft and smooth. Overall, this is a great quaff."

"On tap at Dieu Du Ciel! Pours a pitch black color with an inch of frothy khaki head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is boozey with some nice coffee, roasted malts and smoke. Hints of chocolate but the main focus is the roasted coffee. The taste is no surprise, coffee, along with some sweet chocolate, roasted malts and earth. Maybe even hints of licorice. Not a huge alcohol presence. Silky and creamy. This one is almost like a delicious coffee milkshake. Good mix of roasted coffee and earthiness. Overall, outstanding brew I'm glad I got to have on tap. I look forward to drinking the bottles I grabbed as well."

"O- A solid stout to say the least. A wee bit pricey (7$) but definitely worth trying once. I would love to try the bourbon barrel version."

"I had heard a lot about this beer and was really excited to finally get a chance to try it. The best part is that I have two more bottles of it to look forward to. If you don't like coffee or coffee stouts, avoid this beer like crazy. If you like coffee-focused beers, seek this one out. It can be a bit pricey, but worth trying once (or three times)."
"Buy this beer in a bottle for sure but go out of your way to try this on tap. You will not regret it."

"Overall: A gem of a beer. This is one well crafted gem in all aspects, especially if you enjoy coffee stouts. This one is hard to beat in the non barrel aged category. Delicious!"

"Pour's black as sin into my Duval tuip, a slight, khaki colored head manifests. Seriously the carbonation was clear but the head was just a ring and despite a full bright light only the slighest cherry edge is visable. This growler's been warming all night and while I'm missing the masssive coffee smell, I do get alot of subtle balanced notes: coffee, chocolate covered cherries, echos of vanilla and lace. It's amazing how smooth and drinkable this is! I get the coffee bitterness, easily fading into subtle vanilla with cherry cola echos. Vanilla, cherry, cola echoing back and forth, then overcome with bitter coffee on the finish. The intesity of the lace on the swirl is impressive, as is the complete cloaking of the abv. Seek this out!"

"Poured into a tulip glass. Pours very opaque black with a thin tan head. Some lacing is left behind on the glass as the head retreats. The aroma of coffee hit the nose even as the beer was being poured. There's some dark roasty malt in the nose that really blends well with the coffee. There's just a touch of chocolate in the nose. There's some nice dark coffee in the flavor with some good dark roasted barley malt in the flavor. The coffee aftertaste lingers in the mouth. There's a touch of chocolate there as well, which is something I found in the nose. I don't even taste the 9.5% ABV. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. The drinkability is high for an imperial stout. This is an excellent beer."

"O - An amazing coffee imperial stout! one of my favorite of the style and overall!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O-the coffee flavor in this stout is superb. It has great flavor and balance. A truly enjoyable sipping beer."
""
"O. So smooth and complex with a long finish."
""
""
"O: Overall, this is one dang tasty beer. Mostly dominated by the aroma and tastes of coffee with little else. Very tasty, I would get this again (fortunately I've got another in the fridge)."
""
""
"O - Great flavor with incredible integration and balance. Definitely worth the hype. Be sure to grab one if you can find it."
"This is pure perfection here in terms of coffee-infused beers. Never had anything like this to date, and while not my to-go style of imperial stouts (I prefer chocolate over coffee), this is still one of the best beers I've ever had, and definitely complex and ambitious as well. Incredible stuff - don't ever pass by the chance to try it."
"Rich, deep and balanced. Opaque body with swirling beige marbled carbonation, surrendering a richly smooth sugared nose that evolves dark chocolate into into freshly roasted coffee that clings with the palate and imagination long after consumption with power and size."
""
""
"I know that this beer is a little more expensive (in my store sold by the bottle at around $5). I recommend this beer thoroughly. This is an amazing beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this is really good. The pricetag can be a bit of a turnoff, but it's an exceptional beer"
""
""
""
""
"One of the last from this brewer to be tried by me (that I can find). Why did I wait? Amazing beer."
""
""
""
"This is an amazing beer that I never would have heard of if not for Beer Advocate. The aroma is amazing and what sets this apart from many other coffee stouts is the mouthfeell and drinkability. Very smooth without the thin aftertaste I find in a lot of other non BA stouts. Definitely in my Top 3 - 5 range for stouts behind FBS and Expedition."
""
""
""
"This beer is near perfect. The two things that stand out the most for me is the flavour and mouthfeel. The mouthfeel it is very silky and smooth and has the perfect amount of thickness to it. The flavour is fantastic, it is the perfect balance of bitter and sweet. It really excites my taste buds and is far from a burden to finish the entire bottle. As a matter of fact I tally up the remaining stock in the fridge as I drink it. A nice flavourful beer and easily in my top three. For 9.5% this beer is remarkably balanced. If you like dark beers this one is a clear winner."

"O: this is a delicious stout, and deffinatly a sipper, great chocolate and coffe notes, great full bodied creamy mouthfeel, everything I look for in a stout.... Now unjust need to seek out a fresh bottle, to really see the vast character if this beer."
""
""
"In short, an espresso type coffee dominated Imperial Stout. Being seduced by the serpent was a nice experience I cannot regret (330 ml, Bottled on 07-2009, into tulip)."
""
"O: Definitely one of my top favorite espresso imperial stouts. A must have in my book and easily one of the most balanced yet still an espresso bomb. If you see this and Hahn tried it you must buy!"
""
""
""
""
"O - An excellent, quaffable imperial stout. The alcohol is in the background. The coffee is a bit more subdued in this batch than when I rated it in 2012 and it really suits my taste buds. Great stuff."
""
"O: Peche Mortel is a perfect night cap, warming and rich, uncompromising in it's smell & flavour. The brandy notes suggest a luxury and excellence few brews can match. Well worth a long search to find Peche Mortel."

""

"Verdict: A good solid stout that highlights the coffee element, certainly enjoyable throughout the drinking experience. I think it's lacking a bit of depth and complexity relative to other stouts on the market, but this is still a fine beer and one I would happily drink again and again."
""
"O: This is one of the best beers I have ever had. There isnt a single part of this beer that isnt amazing and cant wait to grab a few more bottles."

"O - well worth its spot in the BA top 50. Very drinkable and the 9.5% ABV is well masked and feels just right."
""
""
"355mL. Pours almost opaque black with a thick, tan head that has good retention and magnificent lacing. Aromas of cocoa powder, dark unsweetened chocolate, roasted coffee, and vanilla. Taste is well balanced and not too sweet or bitter. Lots of roasted malt and coffee with a background of dry hops. Burnt sugar and roasty finish with some spicy alcohol. This is the least artificial smelling and tasting coffee stout I have tried. Very natural in every way. Alcohol is beautifully masked. Excellent! 1/22/2009 8/5/8/4/16=4.1"
""
""
"Overall: Very impressive stout, deep, rich, and bold flavors. A beer that deserves its reputation."
"O: This is an excellent beer. Probably the best non barrel aged coffee stout I've ever had. I'd take this over FBS or any of the other standards given the choice. Pick this one up."
""
""
"O: All in all a fantastic beer! I A must try."
"Peche Mortel pours jet black. Two fingers of mocha foam quickly fill the glass and threaten to spill out. Head retention is decent, and foam is left in a thick ring at the top of the glass, and fairly spotty below. The nose has a wonderful, potent fresh coffee aroma. It's offset by a subtle, perfectly complementary dark chocolate note. The flavor has that same great coffee presence, but it's a little bit more domineering here. There's still some chocolate, and a light earthy hop note, but the coffee is far and away the center of attention. It's to the point where the beer becomes a little bit one note. The carbonation is nice and subdued, but the body could stand to be just a little bit more rich and full. I find Peche Mortel to be consistently very good, but a step shy of outstanding in most aspects. That considered, it's definitely one of the best coffee stouts available year round."
"Pours a dark opaque black with a light brown two finger head. Excellent head retention and significant splotchy lacing. Strong espresso, dark fruit and roasted malt on the nose. Opens with espresso, rich roasted date, baked black cherry, and charred raisin joined by rich dark chocolate and finishes slightly bitter with strong coffee and slightly bitter earthy hops. The mouthfeel is incredible. Thick, silky, smooth and creamy with a perfect level of carbonation. This is one of the most complex beers and definitely one of the most complex imperial coffee stouts I've had. The coffee is very evident, yet doesn't overwhelm the other rich flavor aspects of this brew. Truly a masterpiece."
""
""
""
"O- The mouthfeel is fantastic, just big smooth and delicious. I know this wasn't a super fresh bottle but I'd love to get a new one to see if the coffee takes over."
""
""
"O - Great coffee stout, and a good benchmark for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This one never disappoints. One of my all-time favorite beers (if not THE favorite)."
""
"O: A successful coffee stout from Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel. I'll be seeking out more of their brews. This has a wonderful coffee aroma and taste and I really enjoyed the mouthfeel on this beer. Really drinkable despite the ABV. I'm putting it up on my list with the Speedway Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer reminds me a lot of Speedway Stout (but not quite as good). It has a nice roast and caramel flavor with a bit of dark chocolate. I really enjoyed this - my glass was empty in less than 20 minutes."
""
""
"Tastes smoky, and of coffee. Long coffee finish. Nice thick mouthfeel coats the tongue. Almost oily - pleasantly so. Really nice balance of coffee and beer. The usual notes in a good stout as well -- chocolate, malt, molasses... Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An excellent creamy imperial stout in many ways, more bitter and dry than sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've been up and down on the du Ciel beers I've had, but this is genuinely fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, probably the best straight coffee stout I've experienced. Put this beer in a bourbon barrel, and it would rival bourbon county stout or kbs."
""
"Overall, very good brew and probably one of the best Dieu Du Ciel has on offer, but the Aphrodisiaque stout is better. Hope I can find this again after I leave Canada."
""
""
""
""
""
"I tried a '10 Peche Mortel (aged 2 years) at a tasting a week or two ago. Compared to it fresh, it lost most of it's coffee taste but definitely had a little bit more dark fruits that came out which were mostly hidden in the fresh version. I definitely liked the fresh version better, but the aged one wasn't bad. I'd recommend trying it fresh, but if you want to try something a little bit different you can definitely age it."
""
""
"O:I am glad I tried this. Was suprised to find a battle in a local bottleshop in Melbourne Australia."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. This gives Founders Breakfast Stout a run for its money, and I actually think I prefer the Peche Mortel. Near-perfect from start to finish, make sure you try this beer if you have the opportunity."
"Creamy and smooth. Very grateful to have had the chance to try this one!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty solid coffee stout, but I'm not getting the coffee flavors I was hoping for. Was hoping for something more robust. Super easy drinking for a 9.5% beer."
""
""
"As both a coffee and beer lover, this beer speaks to me in ways others cannot. Dieu du Ciel! isn’t shy about featuring coffee in their brew, and for such a strong one--a whopping 9.5%--they deliver a remarkably drinkable product. Peche Mortel is not a beer for the faint of heart (mortal sin in French), but for dark beer drinkers like myself, this beer’s bold, complex flavor and silky texture set it apart from other stouts. Hot or cold, rain or shine, Peche Mortel will do you right."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Just a great beer"
""
""
""
""
""
"A definite sipper, this is certainly an excellent beer, and a must-try. Sharp coffee bitterness is balanced out excellently by the creamy texture. The 9.5% is only evident once you finish the bottle."
"O: solid beer with a fantastic smell. Would have again, no doubt, but wouldn't cellar it. This 2011 version was still excellent, though, so who knows?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle courtesy of tobelerone, thanks man! Dark black, decent head that has a slight rim to it around the glass. First whiff was chocolate, subsequent aromas were all coffee, nice. The taste was strong coffee, stout, sweet chocolate, nice stuff here. I can;t believe I haven't drank this beer before, definitely one of the better coffee imperial stouts that I have had."
""
"They should have beers like this at '4/5 Star' Restaurants. I frequent high end, creative restaurants and its surprising how people with lots of money will spend on quality for everything but beer! this would pair well with Tiramisu, Chocolate Mousse Cake. Perfect on it's own."
""
"Pours an oily deep black/brown. Tan color head with stick oily bits stuck in the lacing. Fantastic aromas of roasted coffee and chocolate malts. Taste is great, smooth chocolate coffee roasted malts, dried fruit, and boozey. A bit bitter hop, but otherwise very very drinkable. Such a fantastic brew and lucky to have on tap at the source. Deff a world class brew."
"o- awesome beer. i want more of it! this is up there with wake-n-bake and fbs."
""
""
""
"O: One of the world’s greatest coffee stouts, hands down. I can’t even imagine what this would be like fresh, with the fair-trade coffee just busting out of the seams at every opportunity. A year may have been too long to age, but this is a ridiculously good stout even after 13 months; what a beer."
"Drinkability – An excellent, easy drinking stout."
""
""
"O: This beer is awesome. It can stand up to KBS and other coffee based stouts. I will be seeking for more!"

"Drank on 4/16/2012."
"A friend brought me back a fresh bottle from a recent trip to Canada. This has always been one of my favorite stouts and I'm surprised I haven't reviewed it sooner."
"Two year old bottle. Poured into a pint glass. Dark brown color. Low carbonation. Taste is chewy, heavy, espresso bitterness, leather. Surprisingly smooth given the alcohol content. Would like to eat with some creamy cheese or mint chocolate chip ice cream."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - An absolutely fantastic Canadian imperial stout. Crafted remarkably well in all departments, with the fantastic head and lacing, the rather unique aroma, the delicious and highly drinkable flavor profile, and most of all, the monstrous mouthfeel this brew packs. It's not hard to see why this is ranked as the top beer in Canada."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Note to Self: Ranked #1 Top Beer in Canada, #16 American Double / Imperial Stout, #53 Top Beers - Popular when I tried it on-tap."
""
"Pour is pitch black with no head whatsoever. It smells kind of weak. Hints of coffee and roasted malt. The taste follows suit exactly. A bit weak for my tastes. I was expecting this robust thick stout, but what I got was a complex porter. For some reason, alongside the obvious dark malts and coffee, I got vanilla somehow. Everything seems to be so subdued, but I think it was a really old bottle (the notches on the side say 04-2005)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm glad to have tried this, but disappointed to find out that the coffee note is of the family I don't care for."
""
""
""
""
" Such a drinkable beer at 9.5% leaves you wanting another as soon as you're done, sadly, I only had one."
""
""
"O: well crafted beer, I wish I new the age on this to determine how this might develop further. That takes a large chunk out of the overall category for me. 4.5/4.5/4/4/3.5~4.03"
""
"O: this is an incredibly well rounded imperial stout, the only thing i didnt like so much was the taste which lingered on the palate, it was intensely bittering and stuck around for a long time"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I can see why this beer is so highly regarded. This is one beer that lives up to the reputation. Wonderful flavors and aromas."

"Overall a great imperial stout with a hint of coffee. Will most definately re-visit!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Body is medium-heavy to heavy, with strong enough carbonation to make this thick beer foam up slightly on the palate. The result is a fairly smooth, pillowy mouthfeel. Ethanol warmth is obvious from the beginning in the nostrils, and it can be felt burning the tongue and back of the throat as well; this is to be expected from a 9.5% ABV imperial stout. Finish is quite dry."
""
"A-"
"O - A wonderful brew! Super glad I got to try this one. Thanks for the killer extra Andyavalanche. I cant imagine a better trader. Highly recommended brew!"
"O: This is probably my favorite of all of the coffee stouts that I have had. The flavors of the coffee combined with the espresso bitterness, smooth and creamy flavor, and beautiful aroma make this beer special. This is one of the those beers I always want to have. I have had this beer many times in the past and will have it many times in the future assuming I can continue to find it at bottleshops. Very little presence of alcohol in this beer as well."
""
""
""
""
"O: the flavors of coffee and roast blend nicely, a crisp stout, very earthy and robust - probably the best coffee-infused stout I've had"
""
"O - Overall a fine stout, but not quite what I was expecting. I'd heard it was a coffee bomb and while it certainly has a great deal of coffee flavors, they are balanced with a fig flavor that doesn't pair especially well with the coffee. I'd rather have an FBS, since that has brilliant coffee flavors which are better paired with other characteristics. Same goes for Speedway, I prefer that too. Reminiscent of Mephistopheles, but toned down a bit and with a great deal more coffee, of course."
""
"I had being looking forward to trying this for quite some time and it did not disappoint at all. A great beer by a brewery that has really impressed me."
""
""
"O - A well balanced Imperial Coffee Stout. I was very surprised how well everything came together and complimented itself."
""
""
"Overall this was worth the money, maybe even a revisit if found around 5 bucks. One world class stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Impression- A very deep but never ""too intense"" type of Stout. I highly recommend ANYONE picking this one up because of its nice character and unlike other stouts, is drinkable. A delicious, Slick, Coffee Infused with Dark Chocolate Imperial Stout. This is what sums this one up!"
"Overall: I'm a die hard fbs freak and this hasn't displaced but damn, it's good."
""
""
""
""
"Overall (5): Exactly what you would want and expect in an Imperial Coffee stout: stark coffee malt flavour, a touch of dark chocolate, an amazingly creamy mouthfeel and a coffee grind aftertaste all tied up with nice hop balancing, alcoholic touches, and a dark dark body. Couldn't ask for better."
""
""
""
"D - WOW! stumbled across a bottle of this... where can I get more!! Very well done!"

"O: Good stuff, above average coffee stout, going to get some more soon"

"O: A big coffee stout, strong, rich, warming."

"This is a good coffee stout, but not worth the price tag."
"O- A really great stout, one of the best coffee flavored stouts I've had, it really packs in the coffee flavor, I think I liked it a bit better from the bottle, but this is still an amazing beer."
"O - Exceeded my expectations, this was a fabulous coffee stout. Seek it out if that's your thing."
"Overall: A solid take on the coffee-infused stout. Very nice malt profile and a high drinkability. I always keep one of these in the fridge."
"O - Easily one of the best stouts for your money. Tons of tasty flavors and very little alcohol detectable. The perfect beer for a cold winter night."
""
"Overall this is a great on. A good treat for a coffee and beer lover."

""
"Overall – A damn good coffee stout, and I’d be curious to see how this was fresh."

""
""
"Péché mortal would do well with food, on its own, or as an ingredient if you dare. I am enjoying it immensely as a sipper. It develops to be more mellow with time and warmth."
""
""
""
"Poured an opaque black with a moderate tan head, decent retention and lacing. Aroma of coffee, cocoa, dark malts, some dark dried fruits. Big coffee/espresso taste, but decently balanced with sweet malts, caramel, dark chocolate, hints of dark fruits, ash, and light indistinct spice. Pretty nice. Full-bodied and quite drinkable."

""
""
""

""
"D - It's place as best beer in Canada is well deserved. It's a bit pricey in the US but a steal when I'm home in Toronto (when it's available). Looking forward to the bourbon barrel version, although I'm a bit apprehensive about the feel holding up to the barrel aging."
""
""
"D - Extremely high quality and bold flavors make this one a must have, especially if you're a coffee lover."
""
"Overall, this holds up to the hype. It reminds me of an ""imperial"" version of Surly Coffee Bender, which is a good thing. I am really glad this is available relatively easily in my area, as it is one of the best coffee beers I have had."

""

"High A-"

"I've had the opportunity to have this a number of times, but recently I think it's been harder to find. This particular bottle I reviewed appeared to be pretty old. Regardless, it was still very good. This is a very well-rounded and balanced coffee stout. A must-try."

"Overall- A really nice flavoured Imperial Stout. This has been on my want to try list and has lived up to the hype."

"Enjoyed this offering on brisk winter night out of a 11.5 oz bottle. Presents midnight black with a small dark brown head. Light to no carbonation with excellent lacing. Smell of toffee and coffee with lingering sweet notes. Taste is wordclass. Robust sweet espresso that lingers just long enough and masks the 9+% ABV very nicely. Thick on the palate as it should be with this style. If you have chance to try/buy this one its a must!!! Even better on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Go for it!"
""

"A very interesting, deep beer with a lot of layers; has a sort of quasi-Belgian vibe to me, combined with the big time coffee hit. Wish I could find this one a bit more often and easily in my neck of the woods and that it was a little more affordable when I do."
""

"o- if you've not had it, you should..."
"Mouthfeel is about right, pretty damn thick. Carbonation is a solid medium. Overall a good stout, worthy of praise. However, I wasnt as impressed as some reviewers seem to be."
"The beer appears opaque and near black. A thick beige head hangs out for a few minutes before settling to a thin layer of crema, leaving a nice sheet of lacing in its wake. The aroma brings abundant coffee and chocolates amid a bed of roast and subtle booze. Well balanced, though coffee presence does emerge more than other aspects. Teeming with flavor, roast and dark chocolates are balanced by a delicate bitterness that keeps the sweetness in check. Full bodied with appropriate carbonation. Overall, a terrific stout. Highly recommended."
"An excellent winter sipper - not flawless, but pretty darn close. I am not a big fan of most heavier/imperial stouts, but the balance in this one is so good that even I can appreciate the brew. Seek this one out, it deserves the praise it gets."
"In my small world, truly a benchmark beer."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a slick black, with a massive 3 inch dark tan head that sticks around, amazing lacing. Smell is dank roasted coffee, hints of chocolate, and licorice. Taste is all of those things, the roasted coffee is the main attraction for sure. The body is a bit thin, plenty of carbonation, and fairly easy drinking for it's abv. This is good beer, but based on the reviews I really expected more."
"O - Still a great stout but tap version is more subtle and balanced. I would highly recommend this bottled version as well."
"Overall, it didn't live up to expectations. Think it would have been better without the dry bitterness in the taste. It was a good overall stout, and the coffee played a very nice complementary role."
"11.5 oz bottle poured into a balloon glass. Aggressive pour gave a good two-finger mocha head. Smells of nice roasted coffee, chocolate, and some molasses. Taste is dark and sexy, like a naughty witch at a college Halloween party. The coffee notes are roasty but smooth with very little bitterness, rich chocolate notes. An excellent beer to help celebrate Halloween. Cheers."
"Overall: I was really happy to get to try this beer. I had seeked it out for a couple of years. It was not as amazing as I imagined but I would like to have it again sometime."
"Overall - An outstanding beer. Balance is superb in this beer, especially with the fruit balancing out the coffee."
"overall- tasty. I knew the beer had a great reputation, and it didn't disappoint."
"I am blown away by the taste on this thing, never had a stout taste this incredibly varied and balanced on top of it. No wonder I can never find this beer everyone probably buys it cause it's just fantastic tasting, which it is."
"Perhaps the best, always-available coffee imperial stout on the market (it certainly ranks with Speedway!). This is tremendous beer! Exceptional."
"D - Pretty high, even though I already feel a teensy bit buzzed just from what I've drank reviewing this."
"Overall: This is the last of the big beers that I've been tasting for the past couple weeks. I think I've assaulted my tastebuds enough and I am ready for some less demanding beer for a little while. This was the perfect beer to end with, though. It is definitely a big beer. It's got a lot of flavor, a huge coffee profile, definite alcohol strength, but it just carries it all off with this sense of easy refinement that is very refreshing and inviting. This beer doesn't challenge you to drink it, it welcomes you, and after feeling like I was entering into a boxing ring with a lot of the beers I've tasted recently, this is a welcome experience. I highly reccomend you grab some of this beer."
"taste - coffee, coffee and more coffee. i'm not a huge coffee fan, but this is well done with minimal bitterness. warm maltiness, the chocolate malt backstops everything. great mouthfeel, a hint more carbonation would be appreciated."
"D- Dieu du ciel's signature. One of the beers that opened my eyes to good beer. A great way to end a meal, substituting for dessert."
"Overall a superb imperial coffee stout."
"O - Overall, this is not quite the beer I remember. I will definitely need to revisit this one when it first hits the shelves."
"Overall - This is a world class beer. It is incredibly well balanced and definitely one of the best stouts that I've ever had."
"Good beer, but not as good as the ratings for me. Maybe my palate is spoiled by a constant supply of Founders stouts. I'd rather have a FBS when in a coffee stout mood."
"Pours very dark coffee brown with a finger of nice, solidly packed dark khaki head which sticks around for awhile and leaves a modicum of lacing. Smells very good: medium roast coffee and chocolate malt, some cola, cashew, and dark dried fruit, with a surprising amount of vanilla bean. Taste is big roasted malt and a lot of coffee, leaving behind a bit of roasted bitterness and coffee aftertaste on a medium length finish. Smooth, medium-low carbonation and medium body. Overall, this is a really solid coffee stout, well balanced and good flavors. I can see putting this in the regular rotation, if I had easy access. Pairs well with dessert in place of coffee."
"jd"
"At $6 a 12oz, there's so many better options out there. Thought the same brewery's aphrodite was superior to this one in almost every aspect, if not every."
"I may have gotten a bottle that either wasn't fresh enough, nor aged enough to be great. The taste is solid, but I can't get past the chemical trait of the aroma."
"A very nice stout. Tastes like a milk stout to me. Could definitely have again."
"O: I have a tumultuous relationship with coffee stouts. Too many simply taste like stale coffee, which could be an issue with freshness, but this is as perfect as you can get."
"a beer that I will buy repeatedly"
"Drinkability? I could drink this daily if it was regularly available to me. For now I will just grab some everytime I see it."
"O - This brew hit a grand slam with the espresso/coffee attempt. This is the closest thing to espresso or black cofee without being so."
"Interesting that they've added coffee. I think that kicks it out of the stout category and puts it into the 'specialty beer' category."
"Overall: Definitely one that I'll be seeking out again. The coffee flavor was fantastic in this one! The body was a bit thinner than I'd prefer, but I quickly got over it. All in all, I really enjoyed all of the delicious flavors and aromas that this brew had to offer."
"T: Big and roasty. Lots of dark roasted coffee and dark chocolate with a huge amount of acidity. For me, the acidity was a little overpowering and didn't allow much else to shine. Still, a pretty great coffee stout."
"Overall: Very impressed as far as coffee stouts go this is easily one of the best I have had and I would definitely recommend hunting one down."
"Overall this is an excellant representation of a coffee infused imperial stout. More of a sipper and something I'll enjoy in the winter when my bones are chilled. Thumbs up."
"O - Great stout that I'm glad is easy to find in my area. Looking forward to trying Aphrodite next."
"O- I was really blown away by this offering. This is everything I want in a coffee stout. This is certainly one of my favorite beers. Dieu du Ceil really knocked one out of the park with this beer."
"O: I've been enjoying coffee inspired beers a lot more lately and this one is simply great. So well balanced and has a great mouthfeel. I will enjoy this again and again. New goal: find this on draft!"
"Overall: Definitely a tasty beer that is very deserving of its recognition as a very good coffee beer. However, compared to the top shelf of beers with coffee, I prefer the more integrated and duet-like offerings, like Speedway or Beer Geek Breakfast/Brunch. Worth trying, for certain."
"Jet black, one finger of sticky tan/brown head, good amount of lace on the glass. Smell is of roasted coffee beans, dark malt, baking chocolate, tons of espresso, mild vanilla notes that seem slightly oaky at points. Taste is rich with bittersweet notes, roast malt, coffee, some warm alcohol, more coffee in finish and aftertaste with some roast in the finish as well. Med carbonation, full body, silky smooth texture, near perfect feel. Like always this beer is phenomenal, very drinkable, slow sipper that drinks a lot faster than it should."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. From a pure coffee standpoint, this beer definitely ranks up in the highest echelon, as from start to finish to aftertaste it brings the roast in spades. In terms of a beer, I highly enjoyed it, but the one-tracked mind of it makes it rough to drink a whole lot of this. A great pick-me-up beer that could substitute for an early pot in the morning if one so inclined."
"o: one of the best coffee stouts i've had. cant believe it held up so well. cant wait to find more for the coming fall season."
"Black with thin, brown, bubbly head which dissipates quickly. Rich, roasty aroma; plenty of dark chocolate and of course coffee - strong and earthy. The flavor is just about all coffee. Very roasty and bitter up front, becoming more mellow with dark chocolate. Plenty of sweetness to match up with the coffee flavors. Just tons of complexity. Thick, full mouthfeel that nice and crisp on the back of the tongue."
"O- Very nice chocolate and coffee flavor, they nailed the flavor profile, very drinkable, alcohol was just barely noticeable. I like it."
"O: A great, great beer. I'll admit that I'm not a big stout kind of guy, but I found this to be a tiiiiny bit overrated. Delicious in every way shape and form, but not necessarily world class. Still, as my first coffee stout, I'll give it the benefit of a doubt. A must try."
"O: My conscience is clear after partaking in this ""Mortal Sin"" and I see myself getting more. I am no huge fan of coffee, but suggest this beer to any stout fan. Superbly solid brew."
"Take the number of people on Beer Advocate, and from that number, subtract 204 (the number of people who have this on their Want List), and you will arrive at the number of people who SHOULD have this on their want list. This is one ridiculously good stout. Received a few bottles of this from a fine gentleman in Nova Scotia. I will be seeking this out at EVERY opportunity. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Guinness pint glass (wide mouth). Poured a thick, 2-3"" head that quickly dissipated. This sucker is onyx black. Completely impervious to light penetration. One of the single best smelling beers ever. No joke, I could hold the glass under my nose and just inhale its aroma for minutes on end. Tons of chocolate and bourbon scents, despite the fact its not a bourbon-barreled beer. The most sublime taste. Caramel, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla... This beast is complex. This is so smooth. Doesn't rest heavy on the tongue or coat the inside of your mouth heavily. The taste left behind however is long lasting. You'll still taste this beer long after you've taken your last sip. I recommend this to absolutely all beer drinkers, even if stout isn't your bag. Seriously, if you don't like this, I'm quite certain we can't be friends."
"O: This is very nice beer. I'll definitely be stocking up as the weather turns cooler."
"O: Exceptional. One of the better beers i reviews that night."
"Pours an oily midnight black, small brownish cap forms and little lace is left behind. Aroma full of coffee, roasted malt, chocolate, and vanilla notes. Really nice espresso character, and the coffee blends seamlessly to the deep roasted malt flavor. Vanilla and coffee linger on the palate which is certainly welcome. The 9.5% alcohol is nowhere to be found, always nice. Overall, this is a fine example of an Imperial Coffee Stout. Recommended."
"Overall:"
"O: This was one amazing find. I got 3 bottles automatically, and in retrospect, I should've gotten the other 2 without thinking twice. If I see this again, I'll snatch it away like a thief in the night."
"Ink black is the pour and the head is minimal and shortlived...smell is of alcohol and smokiness. taste is dark. chocolate/coffee/dark fruits/beef jerky, smokiness, it is all here. Mouthfeel is full bodied and stable por la carbonacion. Overall, wow, hefty offering this one is..enjoying this one, and possibly another one in my future..def. not a sesh brew. Enjoy"
"Pitch black, even when held directly to the desk lighting, with about a centimeter or so of light brown (or tan) head. It dissipates somewhat quickly, but leaves gobs of lacing behind. Smell is of roasted malt, coffee grounds, a touch of chocolate, and even less plum and raisin. Very minimal sugar is detectable, and the alcohol is completely hidden here. The taste shifts gears a bit. It begins with a sweet, dark fruit flavor, moves into a bit of chocolately, coffee-like center, and finished with a touch of roasty, almost charred malt in the rear. As it warms, some vanilla comes into play as well. No flavor is particularly overpowering, however, and it just seems very well balanced. Alcohol is completley hidden, but along with the carbonation, it's presence seems to help thin the otherwise viscous body quite considerably. Mouth finishes dry and a touch sticky on the roof of the mouth. Overall, a very good stout that I am very happy to have tried."
"O: A well done beer. I can see why so many people love it, but coffee beers just don't do it for me. I would much rather drink Aphrodisiaque for example."
"This is such a wonderful beer, but due to it's heavy nature and cask conditioning, one was more then enough. I highly recommend seeking this beer out, and look forward to my next encounter with this dark and brooding Imperial Stout."
"Peche Mortel has a creamy and silky consistency with a medium to full texture. Very good level of carbonation in this one too, as it is evident, but just a footnote to the overall feel. A bit too sweet in the finish, which knocks the flavor and feel down a little, but this is a great coffee stout. Unfortunate that it's so damn expensive."
"Overall, this is one of the more solid Imperial Stouts I've had, and is the kind of beer I feel I should be eating with a spoon. Fantastic, and definitely not for the faint of heart."
"O-coffee flavor is a bit overwhelming"
"O- This is a fantastic beer if you are looking for a coffee stout. Alcohol is very well hidden and the coffee is up front and in your face. Worth every penny, can't wait to get more."
"Overall: Possibly the strongest coffee flavor I've found in a beer, and this one may be older than two years. Enjoyable, and with some nice complexity, especially in the smell. Overall though, its a little too coffee-y for me."
"O: Great beer from a nice little brewery. These and Aphrodite have been delicious. Can't wait to try more from them."
"Overall: Abyss in a 12 oz for me, but way more coffee. Quite delicious, I very much enjoyed it and it deserves its superb ratings. Only gets more interesting as it warms."
"O I was hoping for a more balanced beer, but I did enjoy it. If you like coffee, you will love this beer."
"I'm very glad to have tried this beer, probably top 3 coffee beers ever and the smoothest beer I've had in quite some time."
"O- Excellent Double coffee stout. Has enough coffee flavor and bitter chocolate that balances the beer very well. Will search this beer out again."
"M: This is exceptional. Totally creamy and coating, just magnificent to drink."
"O - For such a big stout, this drinks very well. Alcohol not really apparent. The coffee intensity may be too much for some, but I think it works really well here. I've wanted to try this for awhile and was not disappointed."
"O: This is a coffee stout, and MAN is it a coffee stout. Just awesome. Glad I've got another sitting in the cellar!"
"O: This is one he'll of a java stout, not to the point where the coffee influence shadows the other subtle characteristics. Maybe one of the best beers I have had in the style, although it does taste very similar to another beer I have had, but cannot place at the moment."
"O: An Imperial Coffee Stout to be reckoned with. The coffee flavors are strong and blend beautifully with the dark chocolate and other flavors. No sign of the 9.5% abv. This makes a great dessert!"
"This is smooth drinking from start to finish. The alcohol is only noticable as a warming sensation while drinking, not in the flavor. One of the best coffee stouts I have had."
"D/O- A special treat here. The mouth was superb. Top tier of coffee stouts although I don't know that its the best I've ever had. First time I've ever seen it so I had to have it. Good dinner choice fdkayti!"
"M: Dry and reasonably carbonated. The alcohol is noticeable at the end and the beer feels like it evaporates quickly off the tongue. 4"
"O - This isn't the best imperial stout I have had. It is the best coffee beer I've had though. Simply world class."
"This beer pours a thick black color with thick tan head that retains and laces well. The aroma is string with chocolate and coffee notes. The taste is strong with coffee bitterness and chocolate, and a hint of citrusy hops. The mouthfeel is nice and velvety and it finishes smooth. Overall an amazing beer."
"In Montreal in the brewery. Very excited. Pours a black, but takes some time for the bubbles to dissipate. Head is thick, creamy, and ever present. I almost have difficulty getting through the head. Scent is of roasted vanilla, roasted malts. Bittersweet chocolate on the tongue. Heavy doses of vanilla and warming and super creamy mouthfeel. Overall, unbelievable!"
"O: Overall this is a damn good brew. Imperial stouts aren’t exactly my favorite style, but this is certainly up there as one of, if not THE best one I have ever had. I’ll definitely try this one again, particularly is I ever see it on draft."
"Overall, this is a nice coffee stout. It's not the biggest, boldest or most nuanced stout that I've had, but it does a lot of things well, and I would gladly drink it again."
"11.5 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled 2/2011. Pours opaque black color with a dense 2 finger tan head with outstanding retention that reduces to a thin lacing cap that lasts. Some decent lacing on the glass as well. Aromas of strong espresso, dark chocolate, caramel, citrus, and roasted malt. Very nice aromas here. Taste of strong dark chocolate, espresso, caramel, roasted malt, and a bit of vanilla. A good amount of bitterness on the finish that lingers for a good period of time with espresso, dark chocolate, and roasted flavors. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel with no alcohol in the taste and a very slight warming on the finish; very well hidden. Very drinkable for 9.5% as well, with great balance. Overall, an outstanding imperial coffee stout, tons of great flavor and balance."
"Highly Recommend"
"Pours pitch black with a gorgeous dark brown head. One of the best aroma’s I’ve ever experienced, I found myself sniffing this for quite some time before I finally brought myself to try the first sip. The complexity of this beer is also amazing. Chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and oak all combining perfectly."
"This brew poured out as a jet black liquid, the head was thick at first and a little foamy. The head leaves a good lacing. The smell of coffee and roasted malts are on the nose. The taste is very bitter and has a light sweetness upfront, the aftertaste was dry and bitter. The mouthfeel was oily thick making this one a sipper. Overall I found this beer to be quite good."
"O: A silky smooth and balanced coffee stout that has a weird mellowness to it despite the alcohol being a little hot and having a very espresso bitter finish. Has pretty good depth and complexity, though nothing mind blowing. Overall it's a very good coffee stout, one of the better out there. I don't think it was quite as good as I remembered it on tap though."
"O- A very good IS. Quite easy to drink and enjoyable to sip on. Not overly heavy or overpowering. Would like to try on tap if ever available. Sum is better then the parts on this one. Very well done in all aspects."
"Absolutely benchmark."
"I instantly fell in love with this beer. Definitely high up on my favorites list. A must-try."
"Overall: I was *this* close to finish a 32-oz growler in one quick sitting. I love this beer! Drinks so well, despite being boozy. Beautiful taste and everything else. Had it before on cask at a bar (d.b.a. in Brooklyn) and out of a bottle; firkin growler is my favorite serving, then bar cask."
"O- My second Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel offering. I must admit that I like Aphrodite better, But only a little bit. A must try. YUM!!"
"Very good stout all in all, got a couple bottles i'm sitting on, wonder how this is going to age?"
"D: For a beer labeled as an Imperial Coffee Stout, it really nails it. The beer is exactly as you would expect a coffee stout to taste. Very rich in flavor, easy to drink and smooth. Overall, this is a great beer!"
"O: This was a very tasty beer and a slow sipper for sure. Without a doubt, I'm looking forward to the next time it comes to town."
"D-Not incredibly drinkable due to the very apparent hot alcohol notes."
"Overall: really one of the best coffee stouts I have ever had! Its damn tasty! Must try beer, hans down. Way to go Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel! This is the first beer of this brewery i have tried; i am holding this brewery to high standards... that it created from me trying this beer!"
"Mouthfeel is rich and full. Very luxurious and rich in the mouth. Excellent beer. Thoroughly enjoyable. Great beer!"
"O: This is tasty, but it is more of a coffee drink than an Imp Stout"
"I highly recommend this."
"Tastes are, well, charcoals, fresh dark-roast coffee, blood cake, coffee beans, black malts, (well hidden) booze, a little fruitiness here and there, hiding hops, roasted grain, toffee, yeast, black teas, cream, maple syrup and soapy bath water. Truly amazing."
"O: Really had high expectations of this beer, and it sure backed them up. I loved this beer and cannot wait to get more!"
"it had a nice white to brown foaming head, with black coffee grind aromas. It looked very high in alcohol...oh wait it is. but they do a very good job of hiding it. The beer was wonderful once it warmed up... man this beer was tasty. it had dark coffee, dark chocolate taste with a grape skins finish. This was my first dieu du ciel so i can't wait to taste the other beers from the brewery."
"Overall, this is so very good. It drinks smoothly and dangerously easily for its high ABV. This lives up to the hype, and I look forward to sharing it with others."
"Overall: Worldclass RIS!"
"Sensational"
"Overall - Two thumbs up!"
"O - I was kinda bummed that it came in such a small bottle but the flavor definitely makes up for it. This is one of my new favorite coffee brews. I searched high and low for this and finally had a taste...now I'm hooked."
"Overall, this beer was rich, smooth, decadent, robust... the list goes on. All of the flavors come together perfectly. A little thin for my taste but the smell, taste and smoothness of this beer makes up for it. Excellent beer. Thanks again JR. Cash money on your part"
"O - I will be seeking this one out again for sure, one of the best coffee dominant brews i've had and would like to think is out there. highly recommended thanks to rutager for this one and i am at a loss of words. This Beer is King"
"Edit: Ok, apparently I didn't know what I was talking about when I had this. Prohibition Pig had a 2011 keg on (as of July 2013) and it was incredible. Upping my rating accordingly."
"Overall- An amazing imperial stout although a little heavy on the coffee flavours at times although it is very well balanced by a perfect amount of roasted malts and a slight hint of dark chocolate. The smells again are of a lot of coffee then the taste comes through almost the same as well but it finishes with this very nice burnt malt smokiness that is very pleasant on the palate. Hides the high ABV very well, I can’t even taste any alcohol in this one what so ever, dangerously easy drinking, smooth, creamy and rich. A definite go to if I could ever find this one again, please bring this back to Ontario!"
"O - This is a really, really good stout. While it was delicious on tap I found the bottle to be just a few hairs better than this. Still, its worth seeking out!"
"O- Overall this is definitely a good coffee forward beer. I liked it and will certainly have again but I don't think this is as great as it's made out to be. Not knocking this beer at all, but it does fall a little one dimensional."
"Tastes of espresso and toasty malts predominate, with more minor burnt, vanilla, and chocolate flavors. Nice, fine carbonation. This stout is indeed heavy on the coffee, but I think it's blended in very naturally and it doesn't seem at all out of place. This is an excellent, complex, and well-balanced stout, and I will certainly buy it again at the first opportunity."
"Poured in my small Westvleteren chalice the beer looks very good, millions of tiny little bubbles making a one and a half finger head. Nice lacing in the glass. Deepblack to darkbrown fluid with the alcohol pretty well hidden. A bit too much coffeenotes for me but a feast to drink."
"Poured from bottle into tulip glass. Pours intense black with a fluffy dark cream head, a medium to heavy-thickness oily body, and deep black-brown in color. Creamy vanilla, rich, roasted coffee and a powdery cocoa sweetness predominate in the nose. Also, some minor lactic sugars, caramel, dark cereal grains, and light bourbon. The body is very smooth, and all at once both rich and bitter. The coffee aspect of this beer builds throughout, allowing the finish to culminate in a interesting way with a roasted coffee and bitter earth combination. Up front, there’s some creamy lactic sugars and vanilla, then some minor dark fruits. Toffee, light bourbon, and toasted grains as well. The aroma and flavors play well off each other, though I’d like for the aroma to stand out a bit more. This beer was definitely brewed to be savoured. Very good stuff."
"All told, I like this beer about 4.0 overall, but I'll give an extra .5 for the aforementioned aspect of ""here's a hearty stout with hearty coffee," aspect, the excellent balance, and the uniqueness of the flavor (lots of big stouts run together, in my opinion). Not sure it's worth $6 for an 11.5oz bottle, but it is definitely a great beer."
"Excellent. Flavors are complex and balanced, makes for the great experience."
"Overall a solid imperial stout, I think it works so well because all of the flavors are very balanced and not one dominates the others. I would defiantly pick this one up again in the future."
"Drinkability - Good carbonation, especially for a stout."
"O: Very well balanced coffee stout. The coffee adds a little bitterness and roastiness, but isn't overwhelming."
"Pours an absolute pitch black with a huge 3 inch beige head that fades to a small cap. Very nice rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smells strongly of fresh brewed coffee with some roasted malt and cocoa powder. Coffee is definitely the dominant smell and this is one of the best coffee stouts I have smelled. Taste is of Hershey's chocolate syrup infused with fresh roasted coffee beans. The roasted coffee bitterness is very noticeable after each sip. Mouthfeel is very thick, creamy, and smooth. Very rich and heavy. Overall, this is a fantastic stout with an unbelievable coffee aroma and taste that is just delicious."
"O) This is too easy to drink at 9.5% Can very easily see why a lot of folks like this."
"I need another one."
"O- This is a coffee lover's dream beer, and at 9.5%, it goes down way too easily. A great example the diversity within the Imperial Stout category."
"You must let this beer warm up before or while you are drinking it. The flavors change dramatically!!!"
"At 9.5% this beer is dangerously drinkable I could enjoy several that is for sure. Overall a great beer that is finely crafted."
"O; good stout with a lot of flauvors and manny that i cant trace. i have fallen in love with this beer."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the mouthfeel. It was quite unique for the style, in the fact that it retained a glorious creaminess and slurpability, but was so airy and light. Many imperial stouts can be overly thick and syrupy, which is nice, but can become overbearing. Here we avoid that altogether, as we were delivered a beer that comes through in all the robust aromas and flavors, but remains highly drinkable and light."
"O - This is a stellar beer, a paradigm."
"This is a good, but not great, coffee stout. The malt base doesn't give it as much complexity as some others, and the coffee has a light burnt/bitter flavor to it. But it's still pretty tasty, and well worth drinking. And surprisingly, I don't pick up the alcohol anywhere."
"O) Easily one of the best Coffee stouts I've ever had. I've had this beer several times, and it never wavers from anything but wonderful."
"A deep, thick, oily black velvet with fumes of coffee aroma mixing with dark chocolates, cocoa,dark fruit like plums and a smokey campfire. A burnt edge that fades under a silky wave of roasted malts and stout coffee. Thin head, but strong and bold flavors. A mocha bomb wrapped in stout goodness with earthy hints of hops peaking through. Awesomely sipper of a beer. Take your time and savor."
"O - This is now one of my favorite stouts ever! I only wish I had easier access to this beer. Anyone who loves Imperial Stouts should try this beer."
"O - what a superb brew. i don't think there is another espresso/coffee stout that could top what dieu du ciel has done here."
"O: Really nice imperial stout with coffee. My only real complaint is the overly strong presence of alcohol in the nose. I would definitely be buying more of these if they were available locally."
"This is an amazing Imperial Stout, and one that I will do my damnedest to have as often as my pocket and ability to track it down, allows. Fantastic. Highly recommended."
"Overall, a great beer, and an excellent imperial stout. One of the great things about it is the fact that the coffee is notable, but not overpowering. It occupies a prominent place in the mix, but not to the exclusion of other flavours. Very nice."
"M) Thick, creamy mouthfeel. Not very carbonated. Doesn't leave much of an aftertaste although there is bit of lingering coffee bitterness."
"O: Really easy to drink for a 9+ abv beer. If you are a coffee stout person, this is a must try beer."
"EDIT: Re-reviewed, higher score given. More prominent coffee, excellently brewed and combined within this stout. Aromas and flavors are strong and not acidic. Very good beer. Previous Score: All 4's."
"I will try this again. I want to believe it's as good as everyone says"
"O: Awesome. Highly drinkable as an interesting, tasty beer that you won't want to stop drinking. The flavors are fairly balanced, with just enough sugar, molasses and chocolate/cocoa sweetness to cut through all of the coffee. In the bottle, I thought this beer didn't live up to its reputation. From the cask, I get it."
"This beer is exactly, and I mean EXACTLY - how you should brew a coffee based Imperial Stout. The coffee neither overpowers nor is masked by the base beer - a full-bodied and very rich RIS. This is fabulous beer and thanks to Brian44556 for the trade. One of the best beers I've ever had, a must find for you folks."
"This is an outstanding beer, and I can't wait to hunt down some more. This has given me the courage to go out and try more stouts rather than sticking with what is safe (IPA/IIPA). There's clearly more out there to be explored."
"O- I have said it all ! ! ! New fave that I could not forget ."
"Overall, this is a great coffee stout (and I do love coffee stouts!) W'N'B is still my favorite with FBS a close second, but this is up there for sure."
"D - A little boozy and probably a little overpowering for those who aren't fans of coffee in their beers, but this sucker is awesome."
"Finally managed to pick up a bottle of this in NY. Served in a thistle glass, it poured a thick, black color with a huge tan head that laced beautifully down the entire glass. Aroma was like sitting in a coffee shop! The taste was a great, dark complex mix of chocolate, roasted coffee and malt. For 9.5% the taste was surprisingly sweet and easy drinking, with a pleasant aftertaste. Really a fantastic stout."
"O - This is an amazing espresso/coffee stout. Hearty, smooth, and full of flavor. One of the better coffee stouts I've had. I love the complexity of this beer."
"Silky smooth mouthfeel that goes down easy with almost no notice of the alcohol. Very well done. Great beer."
"All in all, one of the best beers my wife and I have had the pleasure to taste."
"D - this is so dangerously drinkable, never guess 9.5% abv, the coffee feature is in your face but does not take away from the beer characteristics, there is a reason this is currently rated the #1 Canadian offering on BA!"
"O - I drink more coffee beer than I drink actual coffee, and this one is the one that I measure all other coffee beers against. Blows me away every time I have it."
"O (D) - A tasty and great smelling beer, very enjoyable and easy to drink. Looking forward to the one in my cellar."
"Cheers..."
"D- Very easy beer to sip and enjoy. Not something you can sip all day, though, because it is very drying. You might want to make this the last beer of a session if you are drinking multiple beers."
"Drinkability: It's interesting for about 5 minutes, then it gets real boring."
"Another well done Imperial Stout, though that's about the extent of my impression. While I enjoyed it quite a bit, it lacks anything to make it really memorable."
"The taste is mostly coffee, too. The beer is surprisingly boozy for being less than 10% ABV. The coffee overpowers what I was expecting from a double stout. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, too. Hrm. As I drink on, I can pick up nuttiness and chalkiness at add to the depth of the flavor. However, the coffee dominance and overall thinness detract from what this could be."
"m/d - creamy feeling, but not overly thick. mouth is cooling and a bit bitter. overall, this is a solid beer and i understand the praises (esp at the price point), a bit more bitter than i prefer. i could definitely drink this again and again, but won't be the first imperial stout i reach for."
"D: I don't care how much booze is in this one, i could easily drink more than one. The dark fruits make it a step above the other imperial stouts and puts it in a league of it's own!"
"I'm going to age a bottle and see how this one does. I know the coffee will be much less, but I think this it is a big enough beer to really kick ass aged as well"
"M&D- A full mouthful of chocolate and espresso beans."
"*After revisiting this one in recent stout tasting, the aroma seemed significantly improved and was one of the better aromas of the night. Upping the score.*"
"D- The drinkability of this brew is high because of an awesome balance between the ingredients. this one holds up to the jype as far as coffee flavored stouts . Glad I grabbed as many as I could. DELISH"
"Cheers."
"D - The 9.5% abv is pretty well hidden making this one very drinkable."
"D- Very impressed. Very, very impressed actually. Unfortunately, the alcohol is strong in the ethanolic nature of finish at times. It starts to become a problem taking too many drinks in a certain time period. I also wanted this to be thicker, almost syrupy like. It balances itself out to be a good beer. Almost a great one. With a bit of age, perhaps a month or three it could be miles better, who knows."
"This will be short and sweet. This is a great beer! Pours dark as night with tan creamy head. Retention and lacing is ok, not the greatest. Smells strong of coffee, caramel, and vanilla, little sweetness to it. Taste has a nice coffee (shocker!) and sweet chocolate syrup touch to it. Little vanilla as well and again, an overall sweetness. Mouthfeel I thought was a little too thin, but not bad at all. Overall a great beer, abv is very well hidden and I really enjoyed that this was more coffee focused rather than just chocolate and roasted grains."
"This beer pours a nice black body topped by a dark tan foam. The aromatics convey a sweet coffee nose as if blended with french vanilla. The taste carries over a lot of what the nose provided but the beer is a touch too acidic to make it all work well together. The acidic nature combined with the surprisingly light medium body of the beer is really the downside of this beer. This is a very nice and easy beer to drink and as it warms it opens up nicely. I must say I'm glad to have it available to me locally now. It's an solid Imperial Stout."
"D - Very drinkable. Very nice flavors all around and the 9.5 abv is very well masked. The coffee flavors are really strong (as well as the chocolate), however, the very nice balance keeps the beer very drinkable."
"Notes: This big full bodied beer is its own dissert or if you have room maybe serve with a slice of apple pie ala mode. Either way this is an outstanding Imperial Stout."
"Drinkability- easy to drink and the coffee taste stays throughout the entire glass."
"Drink this slowly and take the time to taste it, it's a dessert in a bottle."
"Overall- Excellent beer, one of the better coffee infused stouts I have had. Awesome name, awesome label, great reputation, and the beer backs it up."
"I love this beer out of the bottle and to finally have this beer cask conditioned off the hand pump was a real treat. I mean, this is about as unadulterated of an experience that you can have with a coffee beer IMHO. The intense combination of the alcohol and roast here on cask was something that I won't forget for a while. Just completely awesome stuff."
"This has a fantastic mouthfeel. Absolutely fantastic and super drinkable. I wish this was available more often. It is a very solid beer but at the same time not quite worth the money."
"D: i see why this is so high up on the list for top beers. i stumbled upon one of these by chance and im pretty sure it had some years on it. super stoked. get some if you get the chance."
"D= since you only need 2 I scored it well here. I don't think I could go for three, but drinkability is good enough until you have had enough alcohol! If you drink a whole lot like I do sometimes, the drinkability is lower, I just don't want more than 2 12oz bottles, but this is an awesome brew !"
"Full bodied, pleasant creamy texture, and a bit chewy. Slick, smooth drinking, and clearly a very nice imperial coffee stout but not quite better than my all time favorite, FBS."
"Poured into a chalice. DARK black, thinner tan head low carbonation. The nose is of coffee and roasted malts. The favor is much the same as the smell, but there is an astringency much like black coffee. The body is full and the brew coats the entire mouth. As much as I like the intent I just wasn't wow'd by this brew. The astringency is too much for my liking."
"Mouthfeel is lackin on cask, it's a bit flat. Otherwise it's phenomenal, rich and roasty with a nice light bitter finish. Phenomenal."
"Sat on this for over a year. Snifter pour and I am met with a beautiful black ale with a huge mocha colored foamy head that clings to the glass. The robust smell of coffee and chocolate are in the aroma. Roasted malts, vanilla and some light booze are also there. Awesome. The taste is out of sight. Chocolate on the front and more chocolate on the swallow. A nice blend of bitter at the beginning followed by a rich creamy cocoa, roasted malt finish. Smokey goodness lingers after the swallow. Light bitterness on the aftertaste. Perfect! Smooth and creamy all the way on the mouthfeel. A little oily but does not detract. Great drinkability...but the best way to enjoy this is in a snifter with light sips to fully get the most out of this phenomimal beer."
"Mouthfeel is just superb, as it is creamy and smooth, leaving a generous coating in your mouth with each sip. This one is INCREDIBLY drinkable, with not even a peep from the 9.5% abv, and an awesome bitter finish that makes you want another swig. I don't what to say AwYeh, other than maybe your bottle was messed up, because this beer is simply phenomenal."
"I suspect that this is indeed a 2007 bottle, which would explain the faded coffee and chocolate flavors. If that's the case, another big thanks to seeswo for hooking me up with such an old/rare bottle, BUT this may not be the best candidate for cellaring. I will definitely try to have a fresher bottle of this as soon as I have the opportunity (inspired by my good buddy madvermin's positive review of a 2010 bottle)."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is in between medium and heavy bodied, and very creamy. I'd call it just a bit light for the style, but I won't retract much from the mouthfeel due to the general creaminess. Overall, a pretty drinkable beer. Not the most drinkable I've had due to the sheer amount of coffee bitterness, but still absolutely worth a shot."
"Mouthfeel/Drink- Pretty good mouthfeel, medium to full bodied. Seems a little bit watered down. Drinkability is very good. Can't taste much of the alcohol at all."
"Cheers!"
"Tried this one few months back and was not all that impressed. This time I was blown away. Really nice and different."
"Poured into a Vertical Jewbelation glass from an 11.5oz bottle. Pours a deep black with a 1/4 inch head, minimal lace. The smell is light, but very complex. The coffee is right up front, fresh beans. After the coffee there are nice roasted malts, cocoa and a touch of booze. The taste follows the smell but is very rich, glad I picked it as my dessert beer. The coffee is certainly a dark roast, the chocolate bitter sweet, the roasted malts bring a sweetness and charred taste. Smooth and thick going down. I rate this up with AleSmith's Speedway Stout for sure. A very fine example of the style. My second beer from this French Canadian Brewery and I'm sold."
"D. A very well crafted Imperial Stout. If you like coffee beers I can't imagine one better than this. I love Imperial Stouts but don't necessarily love the big coffee ones. This is a great beer for sure, just not my favorite Imperial Stout."
"This beer pours black with a nice mocha colored head. the aroma is coffee roasted and a hint of booziness. the taste is coffee up from with the roasted malt coming through after that with a hint of the alcohol at the end. a little over carbonated for the style, but a very drinkable beer. get it when you have the chance"
"Pours pitch black with a big tan head. The head has nice retention, almost there till the last drop, and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is pretty strong on coffee, pretty much dominates the smell. Other smells are a little bit of chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is pretty much identical to what the smell has. And as this one warms up it gets better and better. I like this one a lot because although the taste and smell are pretty heavy with coffee it's not to much and overwhelming, unlike other coffee flavored stouts. The mouthfeel is very creamy which I didn't expect from this but it's very nice. Drinkability is kind of dangerous on this one. almost 10% ABV and I don't detect any alcohol. If I had more I could do a couple of these no problem. Overall I'd pick this up again for sure. Only the second beer I've had from this brewery and both were top notch, especially this one."
"D= Very drinkable even though it has a higher ABV,one of the better beers I have had."
"I don't think this one lives up to the hype, but it is good."
"Smell has coffee right away, along with roasted malts, some vanilla too. Taking a sip of this long awaited beer for me, it tastes like coffee, chocolate, alcohol, bitter finish. A full bodied brew with a creamy texture. With the high abv, that you are likely to expect from the style, this is a sipper. It is a nice imperial stout, but for me, it did not live up to the hype."
"I love this brewery."
"I'll be looking for this in the future."
"Overall impression: very bold stout with excellent texture, but one bottle is enough."
"An absolute show stopper and the stout by which all others should be judged."
"This is a must have stout for coffee lovers. Probably one of the smoothest imperial stouts available.... anywhere."
"Overall, the reputation of this beer precedes itself, with a powerful, nearly overwhelming roastiness balanced by a plethoric range of bitter and sweet. Not exactly smooth drinking, and the label's admonition to drink in moderation is duly noted, but damn, I want me another one of these (right now, same session) in order to come to grips with just how coffee-""lish"" this is."
"Drinkability is very high, and comparable to expresso yeti and FBS (my two favorite ""coffee"" stouts). This is a really good beer, probably not worth the price tag on the 12 oz bottle that I had to pay to try it, but the beer is excellent. Again, not being able to date it is frustrating and I can only fault the brewer on this."
"I waited awhile until this hit the shelves again in Atlanta and it was worth the price tag, but at $4-5 a 12oz, buying it frequently would be pricey. Nicely done!"
"The beer is thick and rich, and has a decent drinakbility. The sharp bitterness detracts just a little."
"D: This is rather high for me given the abv given the style given the intensity of flavor and due to the overall dryness of the beer. It drinks like coffee."
"D - Very high. The viscosity and ""sipper"" qualities this has have me hooked."
"Don't forget, Russian Imperial Stouts are great for aging due to the high gravity of the style, they can even improve in character over this time."
"Great mouthfeel, a balanced bodied, and a perfect dessert beer or digestif. One was enough for 3 of us after the meal."
"Drinks easily and lightly. I could easily drop two of these back to back. The aftertaste is peaty and sticky."
"A nice dark pour with a deep tan, thick head. The smell of coffee immediately makes itself known. You then get hints of a nice roasted malt and burnt toast overtones. Taste is like drinking a cup of black coffee that you have just dunked your burnt toast in, but it is not offensive at all. It is very smooth on the palette and very drinkable. Well worth the top 20 rating on BA."
"Have been able to try some awesome stouts recently, this one definately has its place among the top A great beer experience for my one year anniversary on Beer Advocate."
"The CPJ"
"Overall: one of the best coffee beers out there, no question this is a world class beer and I wish this thing was not so damn hard to find because I would drink more of this to be sure!"
"M/D - medium body, and balanced. A super easy drinker and a delicious coffee stout. It's ranking is well deserved."
"drinkability: I could drink this for breakfast lunch and dinner."
"warming rich sweet and fancy for cold weather like right now."
"A colossal RIS even without the coffee. Dieu du Ciel hits this right out of the park. For breakfast, evening or anytime!"
"Drink- Outstanding stout. A very well done Double Stout."
"Oh well.. based on previous reviews, it'd probably be heresy, but I'll probably drain pour the last 5oz of this beer and open up a Silva Stout or Stone IRS or something like that. I just don't like this one :("
"Mildly creamy body, moderate carbonation, no alcohol noticeable throughout the sipping. My word, this is one inviting and deceiving mistress. Tread lightly."
"It's sister beer Aphrodite is really nice as well."
"Full bodied and slick beer, viscous and oily, coating your tongue with flavor that lingers, but not overly bitter at all. Your taste buds will be beaten into submission by the intense coffee and chocolate, making it beg for the next sip."
"Smooth and a bit creamy, this beer has a very nice mouthfeel, and well concealed alcohol. Impressively drinkable."
"Poured from a bottle into my Zatec fluted glass. Black. Tan thick thick 3 fingers of head. Does not recede. Just stays. Jim Koch mentions that you can float a bottle cap on Sam Adams head. Well I think you might be able to do that on this! A blast of espresso up my nose. Smells incredible. Toasty. Some sweet malt. Sweet malt up front on the palate. Then a blast of dark chocolate, and a double blast of espresso deliciousness. Creamy but light on the mouth. Does NOT taste like 9.5. An epic stout."
"D: Very drinkable, especially for an imperial stout."
"Medium body with above average carbonation. Drinkability is pretty...good...not stellar because of the 9.5% abv, but good for that level of heat and the style. I must say, I kept reaching for it and had no problem drinking it!"
"D: Delicious; very drinkable; alcohol is virtually undetectable; awesome beer. This is one of my favorite coffee stouts, no question... this completely blows away the draft I had a few months ago."
"Pours a jet black with a medium brown frothy, bubbly foam that dissipates at a medium pace leaving little dots of lace all over the glass. Aroma is delicious with strong coffee, cream, and chocolate...almost an iced caffe mocha smell. There is also an understated dry roastiness here that is very nice and keeps it from being overly silky sweet. The taste is bitter, fruity coffee upfront followed by a blast of dry dark chocolate and finishing with a chocolate covered coffee bean aftertaste on the tongue. Very slight booziness, but it is completely overpowered and overshadowed by the coffee and chocolate that ranges from bitter to sweet and back to bitter again. The depth of flavor here is phenomenal. It's creamy and smooth in the mouth with just enough carbonation to keep it lively. I could probably have a couple of these in a sitting, and the strong flavors don't stop me from wanting to go back for another sip. One of the best coffee stouts I've had."
"Drinkability: I always seem to order this whenever I see it on draft, it's that good. Definitely my favorite Canadian beer by far."
"D: This is a good beer. I really enjoy the mouthfeel and I think that it makes a great start to the drinking day."
"D: Pretty thick, but I could drink 2 or 3 12 oz. bottles"
"Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured almost black with hints of dark brown with a minimal tan head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and alcohol on the followthrough. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. It wasn't very complex as I would have hoped for, but it was still pretty damn tasty. With that being said, it was still kinda boozy. So I will say this... If you like liquor in your coffee this one is a must! If you don't, maybe you should try it sometime. It helps to get rid of 'a case of the Mondays'."
"I could drink this every week. A little hard to find in the area and pricey from what I hear, but i will definitely be seeking this out."
"D. For an Impy Stout, this drinks quite easily. More than one in a night might be a stretch but there is no denying that this is an excellent beer. Highly recommended."
"Overall - Great, full bodied with out being heavy. Smooth but not over bearing"
"A great one to split for my wifes birthday on a cold night in December."
"D- Not a huge fan of coffee beers, I am not a coffee drinker. However I do love to try these beers and this one was very good. I would drink another one of these if I had one."
"D: Great coffee stout. Does not claim to be a chocolate stout although those flavors are present as well. Loved this beer, if I found it more often I would buy it more often!"
"when i first opened, smelled, and tasted this beer, i was almost a little disappointed. i didnt get all that huge coffee. then after about ten minutes, the coffee/ expresso REALLY opened up and continued to improve. a great beer. highly recommended."
"Additional Comments: I expected more on the coffee/aromatic end of this beer. I have heard so many good things about it. While it wasn't spectacular, it was a good beer that I will be more than willing to try again... But it is by no means a top contender for my favorite beer."
"Enough typing, I have beer to savor!"
"As has been stated, if you love coffee and love stouts, you absolutely have to try this one as it magnificently brings together the best of both worlds."
"rainy day here and this stout just lit up my life. its pitch black with a tan head of medium bubbles. no lacing to speak of and its warm enough to taste. you can smell the roasted and burnt malts. taste is a creamy chocolat, viscous and thick. it feels great in my mouth and its extraordinarily drinkable. mm mm good"
"I'm happy to get this review in while another bottle sits waiting for my Beer Secret Santa recipient. He'll be a lucky guy drinking this one. Plus it's like... Medusa, right? Badass."
"Overall, Peche Mortel is a fine example of a coffee infused stout, but others like it shine through. Wake and Bake by Terrapin comes to mind, as does Mokah by Southern Tier. This stout would do good in the cellar, or in a barrel, or aged with oak...anything that would give it more notes then coffee. I do, however, have thoroughly enjoyed this brew!"
"Overall, I dont think I will be seeking this one out again. Its a bit pricey, and I that price it really should be better than mediocre."
"The beer felt silky smooth in my mouth, with a light but noticeable amount of carbonation. There was a chewy thickness to it. The flavors are pretty intense and quite enjoyable. I found it very drinkable."
"I was happy to read in one of the other reviews that this beer is brewed with fair trade coffee. The smell was both of coffee and chocolate. It's a thick smooth stout which may be my favorite of it's kind (Founders Imperial Breakfast stout is a close second)."
"Cheers!"
"D: Was it as good as the Founder's ""Breakfast Stout"" series? Hmmm... that's a tough one. However, I think it would be really be cool to have a blind tasting involving all of those great beers and this one. I totally had coffee breathe after this thing, but it was all worth it!"
"D: Pricey bottle, but an absolutely remarkable beer. I'll buy it again and again."
"D - alcohol is hidden well. A bit more bitter than is ideal."
"d - alcohol tastes like it's barely there, aka, could drink these all day (if only they were more available around me)"
"M/D - The mouthfeel of this beer is great. The weight and smoothness of the body makes swishing it around feel heavenly. While the alcohol is certainly present in the taste I still feel like I could gladly drink this all night (If only one could be so lucky). Therefore I give it high scores for drinkability. I've poured two of these into a snifter before and it was still great from start to finish, something impressive for a stout with a body and ABV of this weight."
"D-I liked this very much, but don't expect to buy again due to the price. Prefer AleSmith Speedway Stout and The Abyss to this for the price. I must admit, though, that I wish I had more now that is gone."
"Drinkability - I had to step back and evaluate this beer from a BA point. This is not my style, i would not stock this beer. But from a brewery side, they have made a great beer and really nailed it."
"D - I finished my one bottle surprisingly easy. It would be too strong to drink too much in a night, but this was definitely the easiest drinking Imperial Stout that I have ever had."
"D - this beer is outstanding, but the coffee is definitely dominant, which will probably limit me to one per sitting. That, plus the 9.5% ABV, which is nothing to sneeze at."
"M/D - Heavy body, low carbonation, and a dry finish from the coffee. The ABV is present if you are specifically looking for it otherwise it is mostly hidden."
"D: Not bad, but the char is a tough off-putting."
"These guys know what they're doing. My second hugely hyped beer of the evening and this too exceeded expectations."
"As an aside, this is a very good beer from the bottle. On tap at the brewpub, this is probably the most delicious beer I've ever tasted. If age improves these bottles, I will try to remember to re-rate."
"The taste is very similar to the smell except that the molasses abates, leaving a clean finish which is a great end to wonderfully silky smooth body. Even warmed up the bitterness is pretty strong, but that's a good thing here. The alcohol is almost undetectable...only shows as a slight burn at the back of the tongue... which makes this dangerous. It's delicious and I could drink one after the other, but I know I'd pay for it in the morning."
"Emperor- IX Equilibrium"
"Then again, not giving it a second try would be considered a Mortal Sin. Would it not?"
"D- Very wonderful stout. All the complexities in this are very well paired, and the beer goes down very smooth. Not an everyday beer, but a beer that has to be had and every once and a while for sure."
"Very enjoyable."
"Once again, Montreal proves to be among the finest brewing cities. A fantastic brew, certainly well worthy of the hype (and the wait). One of the finest uses of coffee/espresso I've seen in a stout. Seriously, I'm almost getting a coffee buzz here, despite nearly being at 10% alcohol! About two bottles of this would be about all I can handle in an evening, but nevertheless, the drinkability for such a thick, hearty, high ABV stout is still high for me. I will most definitely be back for a few more for cellaring and extensive sampling on my part."
"Overall this is one of the thickest heaviest stouts I've tried. Bold flavour which would seem to age well to tame some of the alcohol taste. 9.5% puts this as a sipper and a stand alone brew."
"Peche Mortel (Mortal Sin) is a tremendously good coffee-flavored Imperial Stout. It has a great aroma, with coffee, roasted malt and caramel. The beer taste better than it smells, with a dark roasted coffee acidity and sharpness, bittersweet chocolate, molasses, burnt raisin and earthy hops. It was delicious."
"Fantastic Imperial Stout. I could have one of these everyday if I could afford the 6 dollar per 12 ounce bottle. It is pricy but totally worth it, I just wish I had more than the one I just drank."
"Black body with dark brown chalky hues at the edges. A dark tan head that is both creamy and loose seals in all that coffee goodness. Nose is roasty and full of espresso notes. Flavors of dry dark chocolate, rich oily espresso, some hazelnut and lots of chewy thick malts. The bitter coffee flavors are really strong and welcoming and the sugars seem to dry up at the end of each sip. The best coffee/espresso flavored beer I have had to this day."
"Pours jet black with a lovely coffee colored head which fades to a thing ring around my Allagash chalice. Some fine belgian lacing is left by the head. Aroma is coffee up front, chocolate, licorice and heavy dark roasted malts. Slightly one demensional aroma. Off the bat I get dark chocolate and deep roasted malts, some hop presence, in the middle a great cappuccino flavor comes through and the beer finishes with a slightly bitter note that lingers in the back of your palate. Slick mouthfeel, a bit ""oily"" perhaps put style appropriate."
"Let it out on a snifter and it pour a dark black brew with a brown creamy crown. Awesome on the nose with aromas of dark roasted coffe, roasted malts and dark cocoa beans. An exact mirror copy on the palate. Firts off is the not overpowering dark coffe followed by the bitter roasted malts and finishig it off with the dark cocoa beans that gives it a perfect finish, with a nice chocolately aftertaste that lingers on smoothly. Great drinkability, very refreshing. Taste even better a little bit warmer."
"D - A remarkable beer. A touch hot because of how fresh it was."
"Drinkability was probably the highlight of this beer. Even though it looked and felt almost flat, the flavor was tasty enough that I could still drink it."
"Poured from the bottle with a deep, luxurious chocolate brown under a billowy beige head of densely-packed micro bubbles. The aroma is fairly light and clean, with notes of bittersweet chocolate, a dark roasted malt sweetness, a bit of a mineral quality, and only a faint hint of coffee. The flavor is much more aggressive, but it still doesn't scream coffee for me. The flavor is more of a standard imperial stout, with characteristics of charred malts, bitter chocolate, maybe a bit of black licorice. The coffee is certainly there, but it comes out subtly at first before becoming more prominent in the achingly bitter finish. The texture is smooth but resinous, and although not tremendously boozy, it is easy to tell that this beer is potent."
"Very nice beer overall. Not my favorite Imperial Stout, but very very good."
"Pours a perfect pitch black, couple fingers of tan/mocha head. Fantastic retention, and excellent lace. Nose is the epitome of roastiness, dark chocolate and espresso. Huge coffee notes, and I'm sensing a bit of the alkeehawl in the background. Taste follows to a degree, blast of the rich roastiness is the initial impression. More espresso than you can imagine here, the coffee is almost overpowering; I almost get a sense of some cream or milkiness, can't tell if I'm fabricating this because of the mouthfeel or if this flavour is actually present. Regardless, alcohol isn't hidden by any stretch, well known as this hits the back of my throat. Definite creaminess and fullness in the mouth, slick as can be and just coats every part of my mouth, but finishes dry and bitter (coffee bitterness). Thick, fat and sludgy perfection. Drinkability takes a bit of a hit, chances are I couldn't sit down for more than a couple of these but that more a function of the ABV than the beer itself. Exceptional stuff."
"d-drinkable but I found the coffee and alcohol flavours started to overpower things. I may have enjoyed this more had it been substantially colder out."
"Notes: Definitely a coffee forward beer. Sometimes the coffee flavors are sweeter and other times they are more roasted and bitter. Overall I liked it but didn't love it, and it just seemed a little out of balance. I would definitely have it again, but with the price I don't know when I would buy it again. Definitely worth trying, especially if you love coffee."
"D- This intensely flavored, coffee infused beer is very good, and I recommend having this as a sipping brew rather than something that you drink in large swallows. It really needs a strong cheese to go with it and I think it would be at it's prime with some food. On it's own....very good but I'm done after 1 bottle as it's a very powerful brew. I now know why this beer is rated as the best Canada has to offer....it's superb!"
"D-I love this beer."
"drinkability: not over rated. it's world class."
"A fine beer, and a treat for coffee lovers. Between this and Founders Breakfast, I will go with the latter because of the price, but that doesn't alter the scores!"
"This is a solid drinker and I have not had anything like it. I would recommend this unique brew to all beer lovers."
"Drinkability: Very delicious and well-balanced, but probably more of a sipper."
"D- wonderful brew. This is what a coffee stout should taste like. One of the best beers I've ever had on tap."
"Not only is this a world class stout, but it really has a uniqueness to it that I appreciate. Drinking this is a lot like drinking fine iced coffee, but with pleasant beer characteristics as well. I found it to be quite drinkable with none of the ABV showing through at all. This beer lives up to its reputation."
"O: Finely crafted and a great recipe. Highly enjoyed upon the recommendations of so many that I know. My only beef is with the mouthfeel and head development and retention. Had to pour aggressively to get the head to form up and wasn't very apparent. With a heavier dose of head and creamier mouthfeel, this would be perfect IMO. Otherwise outstanding in every other category."
"Melted French chocolate with wisps of vanilla, roasted mocha java coffee, milk chocolate brown head, scattered lace, black as pen ink body. Taste...dark chocolate followed by coffee...followed by roasted barley...followed by a dominating bitter alcohol kick in the back. The finish to me is just too intense for some reason. Maybe its the combination of bitter coffee, burnt malt and alcohol, but it kicks harder than some 11% and above stouts I have had. Finish aside, the ingredients somehow manage to showcase their uniquely enjoyable qualities while managing to be integrated; nevertheless there is some astringency. The low to medium carbonation accentuated the oily, medium-bodied, velvet-like mouth feel. So smooth..A solid coffee stout for sure."
"D: smooth, but not easy to drink"
"D: This is a very complex beer that I will certainly have again. The heavy bitterness does knock it down just a wee bit for me, though, as I wouldn't want to have too much in a sitting."
"D: Very drinkable, this is an exceptionally beer."
"Ultimately, I think the tap version is optimal, and that a year of age slightly edges out the fresh. Regardless, I think that whatever form this beer is in, it won't cease to amaze."
"It doesn't have the best drinkability. It does get help for drinking like a 6-7% abv beer and not 9.5, but the bitterness comes out a little too much, and the briny salty flavor takes quite a bit from it. It also doesn't cling to the mouth as much as I expected, which also helps the drinkability. Althought, I think the age of this one helps, being about 1.5 to 2 years old, so it doesn't drink as hot as a fresh one would."
"If you like coffee stouts this is a must try. It really reminded me of Terrapin Wake-N-Bake and GI BCCS. Although I might go after the Terrapin first due to price."
"D: Not the most drinkable coffee stout I have had, but not that bad either. Overall this seems more like an exercise of how much coffee can you get in a beer. It's almost like drinking a cup of coffee with some schnapps added or something. Interesting, but not overly drinkable. This is the first beer that I can honestly say I'd be intrigued to try ABOVE room temperature."
"MF/D: an initial sizzle of carb that gives way to a smooth, but bitter/dry, finish. certainly couldn't handle more than one in a night."
"Feel is smooth and creamy. Finish is dry. This beer is extremely easy to drink because it hides the alcohol so well. It is definitely a sipping beer and one that can be enjoyed slightly cool but it really comes alive as it warms."
"This is truly a world class stout!!!!"
"Drinkability : a very good beer in the style Imperial Stout"
"Mouthfeel is velvety and thick. It fits the beer well and helps the flavors along nicely. It's quite drinkable, and I'm not someone who usually takes well to lots of caffeine in my coffee stouts (and this one definitely has a lot of caffeine). It's just such a good coffee flavor with such a rich, smooth feel that the jitters aren't too noticeable."
"2007 Vintage. Pours quite viscously into my Stone Old Guardian Snifter. Huge, tight, creamy, light brown head covering an absolutely pitch black body. Immense rings of lacing left by each sip on the glass. The head remains fully intact throughout the entire experience. Intense fresh roast coffee aroma, accompanied by French Vanilla, sweet chocolate, and some smoke. Taste is, wow, amazing if you even remotely like the taste of coffee. Naturally sweetened coffee up front followed by a chocolaty and coffee bitterness, with a light brandy aftertaste. Best tasting cold espresso that I have ever had. Thick, syrupy, mouthcoating mouthfeel, with light, playful bubbles. Alcohol is well hidden. Great stout!"
"Drink - potent stuff, lots of coffee flavour.. best to be drank with small sips after a meal. At 9.5%, it hides the alcohol very well. Another great beer from Dieu Du Ciel."
"This is certainly a beer I'd be happy to buy again. The alcohol is still a little higher than I'd prefer, if only because it masks some of the amazing flavor in this brew."
"D: One glass is enough."
"Pours jet black with a small toffee colored head. Lacing is the best I've seen and swirls nicely in a snifter. It has a very strong smell of roasted coffee beans and smells nothing like beer. While I am not a coffee drinker, it tastes, to me, like black coffee with a dark chocolate fusion. There is an ever so slight alcohol bite at the finish, but it seems impossible to be a 9.5% brew. It is extremely smooth and only got better when I let it get to room temperature. I could see this become a regular purchase for me and I only wish I took the time to visit Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel while in Montreal two months ago. Fantastic."
"D - An exemplary American Double Stout that also doubles as one of the best coffee added brews out there... I didn't know Canadians knew their coffee or their beer - I was proven wrong on both fronts... A terrific treat for both coffee and beer lovers..."
"Fantastic."
"bottom line: this is a tasty, tasty coffee stout and i'm really enjoying it. that said, IMO it has so much stiff competition within the style that it falls shy of the upper eschelon. would love to try one bourbon bbl aged."
"D: Fairly high drinkability for what it is, but more than one might be too much."
"This beer is a treat. Looks beautiful and pours nicely. Would be a great beer to have ice cream with I think."
"Taste-Full-on dark roast robust coffee, dark chocolate, dry espresso finish with some warming alchohol. Strong coffee flavor throughout, with an underlying backbone of fermented dark fruit. Huge character and very well-balanced. Each sip takes you to a different level of flavor. I would love to try this beer fresh to see if the flavors would be even more intense. As it is, this brew would be the perfect fireside ""closer"" on a cool evening. Sip, savor, and enjoy. S'mores anyone?"
"Seriously, if you can get this.... GET THIS!!!"
"Drinkability - One of the best. The first few drinks i was having a hard time with the unique coffee afteraste but by the end of the bottle i was loving it. This is pricey so id view this as a speciality, or holiday treat. Check this one out"
"This beer is a joy to drink. From the aroma to the aftertaste, everything comes together perfectly."
"OVERALL: Completely worth the high ratings. The head could perform a little better and the palate could be a bit bigger, but the flavors and aroma are world class. A very complex and flavorful imperial coffee stout. Hopefully the LCBO will make this a regular release every winter. Thanks for picking some of these up for me Jill!"
"D - I am definitely enjoying it. It's a good/solid stout, but not upper echelon, in my humble opinion. I wouldn't turn it down, but I wouldn't seek it out either."
"Thoughts: I like the balance of coffe and choc and I also like that sweet cheery like twist in the flavor."
"D - Extremely drinkable for a 9.5 ABV Imperial Stout. This is my favorite beer (flavor and drinkability mixed together) I have ever tried and it constantly amazes me. Almost near perfect for me."
"Overall this is a great beer, and a must-try."
"D: One of the fullest, richest, and smoothest stouts I've had the pleasure of sipping. Amazingly rich, roasted, and complex flavors. I'm not a huge coffee fan, but this beer is actually pretty good."
"cheers."
"Drinkability - A pretty easy drink for an imperial stout. Knocked one back in about 20 minutes, which means that this is perfectly drinkable without price involved. Now when I pay over $5 for an 11.5 oz bottle of beer, that is not drinkable to me. I'd drink 2 or 3 in a night if I could afford to. Also, love that it had a twist off top."
"Bottle, sampled at beer tasting at De Klomp, Linköping, Sweden."
"M/D: Way to easy and pleasing on nitro. A big medium body begging you to have another sip, so drinkable. As about as good as it gets! Great beer on nitro, a must have!!"
"10/30/10-I had Founder's Breakfast Stout for the first time last night and I would choose the Peche Mortel over it every time."
"Drinks: Already a big fan of coffee stouts, my mind was again bent at what this beer did with the caffeinated ingredient. One of the best."
"M: Crisp and very smooth, medium-to-heavy body, medium carbonation, finish is very clean for the style."
"This Stout is outstanding and wasn't sure about the whole coffee infuse stouts but this is heaven in a bottle. I like beer and I like coffee what a combo."
"D: The beer goes down very smooth and tastes like creamy espresso. I could sip this beer all night long and will definitely try this again if I can find it on-tap because it tastes even better than it does in a bottle."
"I was somewhat disappointed with this one. A very good beer, but I was hoping for a little more."
"Pours a very dark, viscous, yet not syrupy black color with a great 2 finger tan head that leaves nice lacing. Dark as night. The aroma is great. Has a nice fresh pressed coffee aroma, some dark chocolate notes and even some vanilla hints. really pretty. The taste is very good too. Just a touch on the hot side as i can detect some of the high abv on this one. Otherwise, its got a very rich creaminess to it that really sets the tone of this beer. Also has a nougat like malt profile that keeps it light enough to drink easily. really fluffy body, a touch thinner than i thought. Mouthfeel is great as well. Slightly more carbonated than i would have hoped, but still a great feel on the palate. Light weight which keeps this easy to drink. The slight alcohol burn is all that is keeping me from giving this a near perfect score. needs some time in the bottle."
"More drinkable than I would have thought on my own... but also a little over-hyped. Still good, though."
"D - This certainly lives up to the hype, incredibly dark and smooth, with no hints of the ABV. I will definitely be enjoying more of these in the future!"
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with a golden brown 3 finger head that sticks around pretty well, but laces little. Smell is very bitter with burnt malts, coffee malts and chocolate malts predominate. Taste is quite bitter as well a again tastes heavily of malts. Feel is pretty crisp, with light carbonation and a lingering aftertaste. Overall a good stout but not at the too of my list."
"I'm not a huge fan of coffeestouts but this one tastes really great and feels quite balanced. Probably one of the best coffeestouts i've tried so far."
"Drinkability is slightly limited due to strength and hop aftertaste but I like this beer: alot."
"Had this in a flight. Looked and smelled like your typical russian imperial stout. The usual hints of toffee, cocoa, and mainly coffee in this one. Taste amd drinkability were extremely lacking. Highly over-rated beer in my opinion. Too cloying and sweet with no balance in the coffee/malt/hops. Lack of carbonation doesnt help but not typical of style anyway. Worth tasting but not shelling out $8 for 8 oz or even $7 at a store for a 12 oz. Seek out others if you have a choice."
"Drinkability is not my favorite category to rate as it is usually irrelevant. However this beer isn't too sweet or syrupy and hides the alcohol very well so I suppose I wouldn't mind another bottle.."
"Tasted from 11.5oz bottle from Lush Roscoe. I have chosen this beer as my 100th rating. The pour is an opaque deep, dark brown with a big, light brown head that slowly recedes, but never fully leaves. The primary smell on the nose is coffee, but underlying are aromas of molasses, super roasty malts, dark chocolate, and caramelized brown sugar. On the front of the palate, this beer is creamy and features the sweeter creme brulee notes. The roasted bitter coffee and chocolate notes begin to come through on the middle of the palate, and the back is dominated by coffee and dark chocolate bitterness. The body is full and creamy with very lively carbonation and a super-long bitter coffee finish. The alcohol is very well integrated, and this beer is extremely drinkable. I am glad that I chose this beer for my 100th rating. It has lived up to the hype of being one of the best beers in the world."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. The beer pours out jet black, literally no light can go through. The head is quite unique, it's a creamy brown/orange/amber color. I expected it to be darker, but I was very intrigued by the slight orange color in it. Has some decent lacing that sticks around until it warms up. The aroma good, but doesn't smell that much like beer, more like a dessert liquor. Mostly coffee and chocolate when its a little colder but as it warms up it tastes like a dessert liquor or some type of ""Irish Coffee."" Still smells very good though. The taste is very good. For a 9.5 ABV, there isn't much detection in the taste. Here's where you start to realize it's a beer again. The strongest portion is the bittersweet from the coffee and chocolate, but the malts are very noticeable as well. Hops are a little more difficult to detect, but as it warms up they make themselves known. The Mouthfeel is perfect. It's it's smooth yet finishes clean, certainly a full bodied beer. The beer is very drinkable, dangerous for a beer of this alcohol content. 2nd beer I've had from this brewery 2 for 2!"
"D - This beer would be alot more drinkable if the alcohol was masked more by the coffee that is supposed to be present."
"I'll definitely be returning to this beer. Definitely fine to drink alone, but I'm very curious to try pairing the strong espresso flavors with dessert or a full breakfast. Nice to know this beer is easy to find."
"Pour is a jet black with a thin layer of brown slightly creamy head. Aroma is coffee, some more coffee, and a bit of dark chocolate malt. Sharp flavors of bittering hops and cocoa / coffee hit my tongue and the lack of carbonation leave them to linger for awhile. The beer seems to be a bit on the acidic side. Body is fairly light and there is little to no stickiness with the beer."
"Espresso Espresso Espresso, slightly chicory, smokiness, chocolate covered espresso beans, burnt sugar, and smokey malt. I'm not huge on coffee or espresso stouts, but this was pretty good. I liked how there is a distinct difference in flavor from regular coffee stouts and this ESPRESSO stout. It was done well, although splitting a 12oz bottle is all I can do."
"The only real knock I have against it is that beer borders on being too 1 dimensional with the coffee. While I preferred the GI BCBCS this is more readily available and a great substitute if I'm looking or a coffee fix. Definitely will seek this one out again."
"Upon opening of the bottle smell is of chocolate, maple syrup and rum. Pouring from bottle into my great divide snifter. Pour is jet black with no light coming through with a 1.5 inch creamy brown head which has now receded to a steady 3/8"" head which is seeming to last. Nose from the glass is chocolate, rum, and almost a sweet cream smell. Taste is dark chocolate with a hint of sweetness. Taste sticks with you. I am suprised by the taste not being syrupy as it smelled from the bottle. Alcohol is not as apparent from the taste as it was from the smell. Beer is quite nice and alcohol is well hidden Mouthfeel is not nearly as creamy as I expected from the smell either, but is also pleasant. Only my second venture into the espresso-stout style, but I am well glad I bought this beer."
"An elite stout would be an understatement. One of the best I've had."
"D: Very Easy, so easy that at 9.5 it's tricky."
"I really can't imagine that there could be a better coffee flavored stout than this. It is without a doubt my favorite non-bourbon beer."
"Pours pitch black with a medium brown head that fades quickly into a thin layer. Deep rich smell of ground roasted coffe and milk chocolate. Tastes like a cup of espresso coffee with a lactic feel. As it warms, you get more of the chocolatey and rummy flavors. Well balanced alcohol only a slight warmth in the finale. Not one of those imperial stouts you want to put away but fab to drink fresh."
"Péché Mortel is about as one-sided as CNN news, but it has a certain indefinable quality that makes it, for my money, one of the most rightly sought after and venerated Imperial Stouts out there. And, despite the overwhelming presence of coffee, it is mystically intricate and notably distinct. The real sin is that these guys can't distribute everywhere!"
"This beer poured an oily black body with a dark tan colored head which was present until the end. The smell was of roasted malts, a really strong smell of alcohol, and a hint of coffee. The taste caught me off guard a little. The first initial taste was bitter, then the alcohol took over, followed lastly by an intense coffee flavor. I must say, after drinking the Mikkeller Breakfast stout, I was expecting the same result, but to my surprise I really enjoyed this stout. This is definitely a sipping beer, but the drinkability for 9.5% was pretty good. All in all, a very tasty beer!"
"A very good beer in a genre that is absolutely saturated with amazing choices. Péché Mortel is as good as any in this category."
"D: Very easy to drink, but due to EtOH should keep a limit to one. Love this beer and should be shared with friends. Enjoy!"
"Pours a black color with a nice caramel colored head. Has an aroma of smoke, coffee, and chocolate with hints of dark fruit. Bitter with the coffee bite, then some nice chocolate notes. Smokiness on the backend. Some dark fruit mixed in nicely. Very subtle. Lovely brew. Worthy of it's high praise."
"If you like the combination of heavy roasted malts, dark roasted coffee and semi-sweet chocolate with a bitter finish, then you'll just love the Imperial Stout. The color is very dark, dark brown with very little tan foam and no lace on the side of the glass. Although this stout has 9.5 alc/vol, you can't really tell unless you read the bottle or drink it on an empty stomach. The flavor and bitterness hide the flavor of alcohol."
"This is one of the best beers I've ever had."
"D: Could have another one of these no problem - after that it will be brutal as I would be in the bag."
"This was the second time I've tasted this beer, but the first time that I've been able to give it a fair review. Overall, I am VERY impressed. This one is just outstanding."
"Drinkability: If you like coffee, especially the dark roasted kind, this is your pride and joy. One might call it a one trick pony as this beer is all coffee, but seeing as how that's the point...it's spectacular. The coffee in this brew tastes fresh and used perfectly...outstanding."
"Highly drinkable, especially for the 9.5% ABV. Very good beer, I recommend it to every fellow coffee lover."
"O - This is not a good beer, it's a great one. I love coffee stouts, and this one hits all the right notes for me. I just wish I could find it for a cheaper price, I'd drink it for breakfast every morning."
"D: Good. I think I could go through a couple during the winter/fall, but here in some, I can do more then 1"
"D - The high ABV is not overly noticeable making this a delicious, but dangerous, bevy. A nice dessert beer, jam packed with flavour. Dieu Du Ciel comes through with another winner!"
"D - this is a fantastic beer. I love the coffee/roasty taste that is mixed with dark chocolates. I could drink this all day and night. Fantastic."
"This is one freaking huge beer. As I mentioned before, it is not exactly down my alley, but I honestly could not ask any more of a coffee infused imperial stout. For fans of either strong coffee or stout, this is a beer not to be missed. For me, it's a bit too much coffee and not enough beer."
"Overall, an impressive beer. Especially if you like coffee/espresso."
"Overall I would say this is a one hitter quitter for me. Big bold flavors that leave a big impression on the palate. Glad I finally got to try this."
"D: Excellent dark, alcoholic brew. Great to sip and enjoy the flavors, which are dynamic and change every time."
"D - This beer tastes pretty damn good, even at 9.5% i would like a few more."
"The only thing holding it back from a higher score is i would want a change of pace for bottle two."
"Delicious as a sipping beer, but some of my tasting compatriots were a bit off put by the intense aromas. Not sure I could handle a full pint of this 9.5% desert-like treat."
"A tasty stout. Maybe this isn't the best bottle but I feel as if the coffee flavour isn't prominent enough. Still quite good."
"EXCELLENT."
"D: very good and intresting beer that was big on the coffee but had lots of other ingredients to accent the overall flavor. Drank well all the way thru and wasn't too sweet. I'm glad I had the chance to try it."
"D- Definetly one of my favorite imperial stouts, Great beer."
"D: This really is exceptional, and totally worth the price. Buy it if you see it! You will not regret it if you like a great RIS."
"Poured into my Russian River tulip glass. Pours a motor-oil black with very little carbonation. Strong coffee smell with hints of dark chocolates and bit of an alcohol smell. Tastes like deliciously strong coffee. Sweet malts balanced perfectly with bittering chocolate notes. Perfect amount of warmth in the mouthfeel. Amazing drinkability."
"Arguably the most drinkable Imperial Stout I have ever had. Was gone before I knew it. Alchohol is very well masked. Pissed I only bought one. Simply amazing."
"D - This is a stout of the highest order."
"That about sums it up. Easily drinkable too. Half the bottle has gone without any trouble, yet it's easy to sip slowly and consider all it's atributes. Very nice."
"As far as it goes, if you love coffee and you love stouts, then you'll love this beer. I personally haven't been a coffee drinker in a few years, and even when I was, it wasn't gourmet coffee. It was late night Denny's coffee. This has a roasty fragrant spiciness that I can only attribute to the coffee used. This is certainly interesting and worth a shot, and when graded vs. other coffee stouts, this manages to score pretty well. In my personal experience, however, there are more than a few other stouts I would take over this one."
"I'd recommend picking up a bottle or two of the Peche Mortel. Everywhere I've seen it it's been priced at 5.99 per bottle."
"This is not a beer I could drink all the time. I will put a few of these away and see how they mature over time."
"D- Deceptive amount of Alcohol in it, felt like I could drink more, but this is probably one that is better left for a night in rather than a night out."
"Poured bottle into white wine glass. Tan head reduces leaving more of a film than lacing. Smells like coffee with some dark chocolate and is quite nice. Taste is very bitter, but balanced expertly with the malts. Substantial mouthfeel is a bit syrupy, but again balanced (this time with effervesent carbonation.) Alcohol peaks through on the finish, but I like the zap with the bitter carbonation."
"drinkability - not sure i can take more than one of these at a time, this is a sipper for sure"
"Very drinkable, in small quantities. Not for a session."
"A pleasant winter warmer, roasty and nicely bitter."
"D: Coffee stouts, for me, represent yet another example of a strange dichotomy I've noticed in my taste for certain foods and beverages- I hate olives, yet I love olive oil; I enjoy tomatoes and but I can stand tomato juice. I'm a big fan of a well-crafted coffee stout but black coffee is not my thing. I'm not sure why that is, but I'm not going to think much about that now- I'm too busy enjoying the heck out of this Peche Mortel. I'm not familiar with this brewery at all, but if Peche Mortel is any indication of their brewing prowess, I'll be on the lookout for more examples of their work."
"Brown bottle poured into a pint glass. It appears a very dark brown color with some lighter brown and redish hues around the edges. The head appears more than 2 fingers strong with a foam of brown creaminess that retains well and laces in patches all about the glassware. The aroma of this beer is a very rich sweet chocolate mingled with coffee at first. Than the dark grains and a slight touch of mineral character that is intertwined with the hops and this beer almost starts to presents itself a bit musty. Taste is roasty grain bitterness mixed with black coffee and a nice alcohol presence that warms the mouth and can be felt going all the way down when swallowed. Little bit of hops are evident in the finish that is a bitterness entensified by the roasted malt character. Lingering flavors of the dark malt are left in the mouth coupled with the alcohol which leaves tastes of chocolate and coffee lingering long after each sip. There is a medium feel with this beer and a modest amount of carbonation. Very good double stout, just the right amount of coffee that doesnt completely overtake the beer and the ever present alcohol feel plays well with the other flavors."
"Drinkability -- This was immensely satisfying; I can only imagine how exceptional the barrel-aged version would be. Great coffee flavor way out front, smooth, great balance of chocolate-like sweetness and burnt bitterness, abv well hidden. Definitely a treat."
"Very rich body and suitably low carbonation."
"All and all this is a great coffee beer. But I haven't had a coffee beer that I didn't like. Not my favorite of the style but deserving of it's place. I can't wait to age my other bottles and see how they taste in a few months."
"Drinkability - an amazing beer, definitely one of my all time favorites. Meant to be sipped slowly and savored like Scotch. Can stand alone without a food complement"
"dangerously drinkable considering that it's almost 10%! this is fantastic beer - rich, decadent and certainly worth seeking out."
"D-- Well hidden ABV%, though a lot of warming sensations very quickly and very smooth for being very bitter in some ways. Goes back to being very well balanced and the right touches of chocolate. A coffee bomb. Impressive to say the least. Very good to see this brewery replace the no longer distributed Unibroue in Australia. A must seek out beer."
"Simply the best beer I've ever had, bar none. This is truly exquisite. Fortunately I have a reason to go to Montreal from time to time - next time I'm going to Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel to hopefully see the magic in action!"
"I just said it: an exemplary beer. The booze is very well hidden, or is used to great effect where present, leaving it a very drinkable beer given its intensity and alcohol content. An absolutely wonderful stout, superbly well done."
"I was recently discussing this brew with another BA and he informed me that this brew is available in Tampa! I'm going to go stock up on some next time I head up to Tampa!! Can't wait!!!"
"THis is one of the premier big coffee stouts on the market. Dangerously quaffable @ nearly 10 percent! A helluva brew for coffee fans."
"D-a great tasting beer with a huge coffee taste definately worth having again"
"Hype is a dangerous thing. I have to admit I was expecting to absolutely blown away by this beer. I was very impressed. Not the messiah of beers but very good. Nose is quite potent, could smell it well before I got it into the glass. However it's a fairly stock-standard Imperial stout nose. Heavy on the coffee and roastiness, bit of vanilla. Very nice but perhaps lacking any individual charcter. Silky smooth, it just slides down with an extremely long and satisfying finish. Some tasty chocolatey sweetness stands out. A mighty tasty brew indeed but a touch too much espresso for me."
"Notes-I am both a coffee lover and a chocolate lover, I'm one of those people who wakes up every morning looking forward to that mocha latte to give me that cocoa and coffee fix. This beer is basically that in alcohol form and crafted brilliantly, if you're at all like me in your love for things chocolaty and coffee-like you should definitely pick this one up."
"D: I'm not really sure what the hype is here. Good but not great, at least to me. I'll have to try another down the road. At the time of this review, and much to my surprise, Péché Mortel is in BA's Top 100 and I'm not exactly on board the hype train."
"However, looking forward to possibly finding this on tap when I head to Montreal. I'm thinking the bottle I found here in Grand Rapids is pretty old and dusty. I think I need to taste this from the source, and then re-review."
"A rich and flavorful stout. Flavor is big and bold, but restrained."
"This is truly excellent, does a great job living up the hype that has been established for it. Looking forward to more of these in the future."
"Drinkability is great. Its a nice flavorful coffee stout and goes down pretty easy for me. The alcohol was only barely noticeable after if warm up for a while. I would still say its a once a time brew for me, based on price but certainly worth a try."
"This is my final brew from this brewery so hopefully ive saved the best til last,it pours a jet black oil hue that lets no light in whatsoever with average carbonation that leaves a one finger mocha laced head and a rim of clingy lacing,the smell from this brew is a mix of boozy alcohol,dark coffee,blackcurrants and dark plums,it has an above average mouthfeel which is a cross between thick and medium which is rather easy to down and makes drinking more than one of these tempting even though the ABV is recognisable it is somewhat hidden to give the appearance that this is less than its 9.5%ABV and exudes tastes of dark expresso,plums,blackcurrants,mocha and really rich dark chocolate,overall this is a really decent brew that id rate probably second best of the six offerings i have had from this brewery and would drink again."
"Drinkability was wonderful, on an imperial curve as this is a 9.5% and means business. But I had two pours because one just wasn't enough. Loved this beer, worth a trip to have on tap. Thanks to the Lizard for bringing in this lovely treat!"
"D- not one of my faves by any means, nothing horrible at that. I can finish the bottle no prob, but I don't think I'll drink the second- rather save that one for a later date."
"Reviewed from my notes. My pour was from a vintage 2009 keg. The beer is black with a tan foam head. It is thin in the center, but thick and clinging to the sides at its edge. There is a healthy amount of clinging and rising carbonation. They are working their way through the foam, causing a few bubbles to appear on top. It has a bitter, roasted dark chocolate aroma. It smells a lot like fresh coffee beans. The flavor has tons of coffee bitterness throughout. There is some sweet malt flavor in the back that provides a great base. I don't have much else to say about the flavor, other than the simplicity of my review doesn't do the taste justice. This is a medium bodied stout. It leaves a good coat behind that is sticky but not overly sweet. In fact, it's mostly bitter. I find it to be a pretty drinkable coffee stout. I'm not a coffee drinker, and though the coffee flavor is strong, it isn't too bad. This beer is recommended."
"D - I find this to be quite drinkable."
"D - the flavor is good but the alcohol taste and burn would push it out of the all-night arena."
"Notes - Really a twist off cap?"
"pours a thick black color with maybe a hint of cherry with a nice thick head and sticky lacing that recedes to a tan fresh head..the smell is semi sweet chocolate and roasted coffee toffee smells and malt..the taste is the same but with a smooth coffee and chocolate blend much different then the smell..the taste is bold and super rich but very balanced between coffee and malts and chocolate..mouth feel is full and thick and coates your tongue in coffee and chocolate..not a big alcohol burn either @ 9.5 its well hidden..its a costly stout but worth the $ for the taste highly recommended"
"Well, this one's definitely a sipper; exceptionally big and very heady with a high ABV. Obviously it's delicious. While I'd love as many as I could put down, there are only so many one could drink at a time."
"very, very worthy of any beer freak's time."
"I know this is $5+ per bottle in the United States. I know. It's $20 or less for a six pack in Quebec, so if you get a chance to visit, buy a lot of it. But for now, reconsider the $8+ bomber of stout you're going to buy from some American microbrewery and buy a 12 oz. bottle of this instead. You'll be oh so glad you did - and you'll be inadvertently helping out the Montreal tourism industry - as a trip to Vices et Versa and the Dieu du Ciel brewpub will be in order ASAP."
"M/D: The lingering taste of this beer goes on for quite some time. Very thick mouthfeel, the drinkability is the same as a starbucks coffee. It is really good while you drink it, but as for a repeat, you dont need another one for a couple of days. I enjoy this beer, and I have to say, I like it better then beer geek brunch. Both are great though."
"Pours a deep dark black color, with an appropriate level of brownish foam. Intense espresso/coffee bean aromas on this one, along with some roasted malt and a bit of hop. On the palate, I again get a huge hit of coffee, balanced nicely by roasted malt, dark chocolate and alcohol. I had heard nothing but raves about this beer, so I was a bit let down. Still, it was pretty solid."
"There are many expert reviews of this wonderful beer and there is not much more to say.. I saw its biggest strength as mouthfeel. I'm often disappointed with stouts or variations that feel watery. This was perfect. What an amazing balance between the coffee taste and bitterness. It gives IPA fans like me a bitterness fix but with rich cofffee instead of fruity flavours on the front end."
"D - Incredible drinkability for style and ABV."
"Very rich, thick and big. Drinks like it's over 9.5% alcohol. This is one of the best beers I've had of this style! Fantastic offering!"
"D: Very drinkable, this is an exceptionally drinkable beer. The flavors blend so well that it's really a joy to drink this one."
"D: Nice sipping beer. Deep rich flavors without being overly sweet. Can work either as a dessert beer or on its own."
"This was my second time trying this beer, first in the bottle and then here, on tap...liked it a lot more the second time as I was able to detect more complexity than just overall one-sided coffee at first..."
"D: A very well balanced RIS with a high ABV. This brew is easy to drink, if you enjoy the style."
"What complexity! Great coffee flavors, a medium roast, malty, chocolately, smooth and creamy, very slightly boozy. A little vanilla perhaps?? A great drinker! This goes down so smooth and easy. I'm very much impressed. Carbonation is medium to high, yet not overkill. Awesome beer!"
"D- A wonderfully stimulating beer, and the alcohol is very well hidden. Very drinkable given the high ABV."
"Poured a beautiful jet black color with an ample two finger tan head, however the head quickly dissipated into nothing. I am smelling heavy coffee and roasted flavors. The taste is heavy on the coffee/espresso flavors. A very nice tasting beer that has good balance to it. This was a very nice change from the beers I have been consuming recently. In my opinion this beer has lived up to the hype, the high ABV is well hidden behind the smooth nature of the beer. A very nice tasting beer."
"A little more hype than substance in my book, but overall respectable. I have just had so many awesome stouts recently that this one is hard to take notice to."
"Overall - Wow, this is very different from any other beer I've ever had, yet it definitely has beer character. Like a cross between an RIS and a cup of black coffee. Moste Excellente x 2"
"And the color ... my goodness, a darkness that swallows every surrounding light ... you can't even see à light bulb through this beer ... very dark and mysterious!"
"The only reason I couldn't drink this all the time is the price. And I would likely get hammered off of the unapparent 9.5% ABV that doesn't even seem to exist except in a slight warming of the tongue. God I love this beer."
"D: If you love coffee in your beer then this is certainly the beer for you. I would be hard pressed to name another beer that has a more dominant coffee flavor then this. The beer slides down smoothly, but it is the aftertaste and lacing of the lingering dry roasty fade that provides pleasure long after its off your tongue. A rare treat that I certainly wish I cold indulge more into. A ""mortal sin?", it would be to miss out on this one."
"Cheers!"
"d - I thought this stout was pretty good but I personally like Aphrodisiaque MUCH more. It had a nice smooth coffee smell and taste but I thought the high carbonation hurt it. I would try it again but wouldn't seek it out; I'd much rather have Aphrodisiaque."
"D - Great flavor and body. Easy drinkability considering the higher alcohol volume. Definitely a sipper and highly enjoyable."
"Nice rich chocolate sweetness then a deep dark roasted coffee finish. Nice bitterness and a crisp finish."
"D: alcohol very well hidden in this, also not at all cloying."
"Would have again, definetely worthy of it's rating. All in all a good, but strong, coffee style stout"
"The only drawback of this brew is its reputation. Its a great beer but its rep makes one feel as if Krishha is going to bestow sweet teat nectar if one drinks this on tap... Sweet teat nectar it is not. Good brew it is."
"Although the darkness here is not as all-consuming as elsewhere, it's still definitely post-twilight here; a fresh bit of tan congregates at the surface, but in crescendo fashion falls back into the night, leaving a few stragglers behind, I'd assume to keep tabs on things. Though their activities remain mostly unknown (classified?), they're definitely drinking some dark roast, to the point that Matt Murdock hisself wouldn't be able to pick out much of anything else though some molasses and chocolate might penetrate those superhuman nostrils. From beneath their posts bursts forth such roasted coffee flavors as to expect a green and white label on the bottle. The bitterness runs a bit high, but not so much as to cause a cringe. The molasses and chocolate are just as discriminated against as before (when will we come to our senses?), but still make their voices heard amidst the throngs of beans, keeping the proceedings from breaking out in a caffeine-fueled riot. The crowd is not too thick, though it still ain't easy to push your way to the back; the members are pretty somber; and, despite the numbers, they're able to move around as a unit pretty easily. As peaceful and good-willed as things are, it might not be that easy to mill around all that often (so many people...). It all depends on personal preference toward the group's message, I'd say."
"This is the best coffee flavored beer and that is why I gave it a 5 on flavor. Everything else is good to average about this beer and should be expected to be as such. Buy it for the intense espresso infused dark brown nectar you expect from a french press, close your eyes, and enjoy!"
"Just an all around nice beer."
"I now see what's so special about this one and am sure I will buy it again. I'd love to try it with some good food. Grilled meat is my first thought but anything really. It will probably keep growing on me."
"D: Coffee is strong but this is a great, drinkable brew"
"Overall I was not disappointed by this treasure. I am so glad I found it while on a trip to Boulder. Not inexpensive at around $6 a 11.5 oz bottle, but well worth it."
"D - dangerously drinkable"
"D: Smooth and creamy. Definitely did not disappoint one of my favorites of the genre. Overall, a magnificent beer and did not disappoint. My only qualm was paying $6.50 for a 11.5 oz. bottle. Would love to get my hands on a barrel aged version."
"Pitch black with thin tan foam. Intense coffee ice cream, dark malt, and dark sugar aroma. Taste is coffee, strong as hell, with a tasty creamy undertone. Excellent! MF could be a bit thicker in my opinion. Definitely a sipper for sure, but this is so good, like a fine liquer. And only $5 for such a gem."
"Very drinkable for the abv. Overall, a fantastic coffee infused stout."
"Mouthfeel - Smooth, full body and little carbonation."
"D: The bitterness is just a tad harsh, though as this warms I enjoy it more and more."
"This offering earned its respect as being in the top 100. Best as a desert brew. Drink suffers a bit from the dominate coffee flavors, but worthy."
"Drinkability - has a unique characteristic, plenty of alcohol, good for one beer and then that's probably it"
"Overall this really is one of the best ""pure"" American Double Stouts (if there is such a thing). Loads and loads of dark chocolate and roasted flavors backed up by mild coffee flavors. Definitely worth a shot."
"I have had this on cask as well, but I was drinking way too much to properly review it then. On cask it is amazingly smooth and possibly the best stout I've ever had."
"is viscous and has low levels of carbonation and is fairly velvety. The finish is slow and sweetens as it gracefully comes to an end with a kiss of warming alcohol."
"delightful, a beer that surely put us on the path to success with our most efficient mash ever."
"Consumed: 3/3/2010"
"D: Very drinkable for the style and the 9.5% is very well hidden."
"Huge complexity, bold yet inviting."
"D: This is a sipper. I couldn't get 2 of this one in one evening. However, it is nice to drink in one evening. Thus the drinkability is below good."
"D - Just don't like it enough to drink a lot of this."
"D: Drinkable, but more savorable than anything else this is some thing that I would like to have one of and two at the max."
"It might be a little off putting for some to pay $5-7 for the small bottle, but it is definitely worth the price. Will be picking more of this up as soon as humanly possible!"
"D - I could drink it all night. Far too high quality for you to be able to detect the 9.5% I drank it quite slowly and didn't want it to end."
"SO in conclusion, the absolute best canadian beer available. Hands down. In my extremely humble opinion this beer can deliver on par with the trappist Belgians. Probably it will never be popularly seen that way (too new world yet not american) but its a contender. Ive never had a beer that i have enjoyed as much from sip to savour to settling flavour. Truly outstanding."
"A smooth, silky, BOOM! Pours with a small to medium tan fine head and some lace. Color is as black as hell, but a lot nicer. Aroma is imperial stout and coffee. Flavor is extremely well balanced coffee imperial stout: fresh dark roast coffee, black patent malt, chocolate malt, dark ripe fruits, caramel, toffee, burnt sugar,cocoa, yeast, and a bit of hop. Body is unusually smooth for this kind of beer and has very good carbonation. Finish is lightly alcoholic for as strong as it is and thre is a nice long lingering bitter/sweetness. Very finely crafted beer. A real masterpiece. Dangerous in a way as it's so well done and balanced you could easily knock back enough to get knocked out."
"Drinkability is great--really good bitter coffee flavor, without overpowering the palate. Very enjoyable."
"D- this is a beer that will always get me to return. I may have some gaps between my visitations but this is one of the kings of coffee RIS's in my mind. I always save bottles I get for a good night"
"D= 4.5 this beer hides 5% of its alcohol. I had a dream I had this with breakfast on my last day on earth. It didn't forgive me for my sins, but it was mighty tasty."
"D-If it were not for the price, this would be my go to stout. Simple fantastic."
"D-great beer with a very high drinkability"
"A pleasure to drink. Robust and rich but never overbearing. There is a reason why this beer is held in high regard."
"D- Good drinkability that I really enjoy. This is a very coffee forward stout that I would recommend to actual coffee drinkers. The ABV limits this one per say but I would have no problem either having it as a night cap or two of them in a row before going onto something else."
"Been looking forward to this one since I picked it up at Christmas time. Pours deep black with a light mocha head which left strong lacing at first, but over time left nothing. A nice nose with chocolate dominating and coffee lying beneath it. Upon sipping it though I was disappointed, it is good, just not the ridiculously super good it had been pumped up to be. The coffee is mellow with a rich chocolate malt brew that leaves a bitter finish. Feels too light though, and the carbonation was low. Quite sip-able, just not as mind blowing as I had been expecting."
"Taste is very nice as well with a nice balance of roasty coffee, vanilla-almond nuts, strawberry-esque fruit and edgy alcohol. Body is not as creamy as I would like in a stout this big, but that is a pretty minor complaint. I would recommend not adding the yeast at the bottom of this one, as it imparts a bit of a sawdust feel and taste to the beer. Very, very good beer, might not be able to hang with the best of the best...but it is not very far behind either."
"ABV is never a factor. This one went down much quicker than I expected it to. Just a really impressive beer. I'm not a coffee guy at all, but I highly enjoyed this one."
"11.5 ounce bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip. One finger head, dark beige, floating on an opaque body. Lacings slides quickly but leaves a thin film of oily resin on the glass. Aroma is of chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, some alcohol and some hops. Taste follows suit, mainly with a coffee/chocolate taste dominating. This one gets noticeably more delicious as the beer is allowed to warm. Can't wait to put a bit of age on a few of these. Awesome experience."
"Very good coffee stout. I prefer several that have more roasted malt to go with all the coffee, but this is a pretty enjoyable option to sip on."
"Full bodied with moderate carbonation that feels plentifully robust. Definitely a coffee bomb, and quite a delicious example of one. It's hard to make a specific complaint against this brew, but it definitely elevates coffee beer to high levels, above the rest of it. I probably shouldn't be drinking this at night."
"D- Really drinkable I'm shocked to see that it's 9% (I figured it out after I finished it), this one will sneak up on you if you aren't careful."
"I think I started drinking this beer too cold. I was really hit hard with an ash-like flavor when I started, but as it warmed up it became much more balanced. Beer is medium bodied, strong coffee roastiness. There is a definite alcohol flavor up front and some malt syrup sweetness. Overall, it was pretty good, not my favorite coffee stout though."
"This is a good stout, perhaps not worth 6 bucks but it is Canadian so it is reasonable I guess."
"All in all, if you like coffee and hops, then this is your perfect brew. Very good."
"Overall, a reallly good coffee stout, but with too much coffee and not enough balance throughout. ABV is extremely well hidden, but the bitterness can wear thin quickly. Even as a coffee lover, I found this beer to be a bit one dimensional."
"While this is a very fine beer, I thought the flavor profile was a little too coffee-centric. I like coffee flavors in big beers, but here it was more center-stage than optimal. Nice, big malt with even bittering finish. ETOH was just a little hot at the end."
"All an all a great example of the style that I'd recommend for any beer lover to try."
"Probably not my favorite coffe stout, but definetly one to try, very tasty."
"D: An infinitely complex brew that displays such depth of character because its soooo balanced with a body that integrates yet lets me distinguish the many different flavors present. This one is a sipper though, not because its hot or boozy, but because its just really enjoyable. Completely under-rated imperial stout. This is a definite winner."
"Very drinkable! The ABV is hidden very, very well. This beer has moved to the top of my list for this style!"
"This was a major surprise. I had heard about this one, but had never really given it much thought until I realized I knew the name when looking in the store. Fantastic coffee flavor in this one, moreso than I could have imagined, yet its not as overwhelming as the first sip, and really ends up fantastically easy to down. Not even a hint of the 9.5% alcohol really, its hidden behind that massive coffee and malt explosion. Excellent brew I *will* be revisiting."
"Pours jet black, seems even darker than many big imperial stouts. Not much head, still exciting. Smell is of roasted malts and coffee very smooth. Taste is again dark malt, coffee, and some silky dark chocolate. Very good taste coffee and roasted flavor are very prominent and well blended. Moutfeel is thick very oily, but not at all in a bad way. Drinkability is excellent. Extremely smooth for a big imperial stout."
"My favourite beer. You gotta like imperial stout though. It's almost closer to an espresso than a beer. Everything is great from the strong coffee smell to its incredible taste. It could have had a little more body. Otherwise, an incredible beer. I yet have to find a better imperial stout."
"D-this is so tasty and big, smooth and creamy. give me more!"
"Drinkability- To me this beer is taxing to drink, just too much unbalanced coffee dominating every aspect, its also extremely heavy and daunting, would take me few hours to probably finish this whole thing, i guess maybe if you were a coffee fanatic you would be rating drinkability certainly quite higher then i am, something i am glad i got to try and though i appreciate its complexity just nothing id go crazy looking for again,"
"The alcohol was very well hidden in this beer which is scary. This is an amazing coffee stout. It is a very drinkable beer as it does not leave your mouth feeling bitter and dry; it only leaves it wanting more."
"glassware: tulip"
"Overall- This is very well-made beer. It is a unique Imperial Stout with a very focused emphasis on a couple of flavors. It is an intense sipping beer that may not be for everyone and would probably be best paired with some kind of dessert or even, dare I say it, tobacco. If you are the kind of person who spends 8 bucks on designer chocolate at the healthfood store, you'll probably love this."
"D= Awesome brew. The fact that I picked this up locally is really nice. This beer rivals some of the more famed stouts namely Dark Lord. If DL had coffee in it I think it would taste like this beer. Intense flavor and an awesome showcase of thick roasty malts."
"The alcohol content does not show itself in the taste- very good balance. If you are a stout aficionado, this is a must try."
"Mouthfeel is thick with moderate to low carbonation. Drinkability is good, I really enjoyed this one. It's strong but the alcohol is well hidden. The coffee comes through very well and isn't overbearing, and the mouthfeel is very good. I very good beer in my opinion."
"D - downright delicious and complex, yet no-fuss. one of the best beers i've ever had, and certainly a world-class coffee stout."
"thanks to beerisheaven for this one. A nice black beer with a tannish head. Smells of espresso, vanilla, and lightly of chocolate. Everyone says coffee, coffee, coffee... for this but I hate coffee and i like this interesting beer. a beautiful melding of chocolate and espresso with a hint of vanilla in the mix. This is velvety, smooth, and creamy. Just yum in my mouth. I could easily drink a handful of these with ease and then pray i didn't pay for the alcohol content after. Sometimes expectations are hard to meet, but in this case it surpassed any thoughts i had on what this beer would be like."
"This is an excellent beer, and I'm definitely a coffee guy-- grind them whole beans and brew a mean pot to get me going almost every morning. Yet, when I drink an imperial stout I don't really want to be drinking coffee, coffee, COFFEE. Maybe I'll have Peche Mortel for breakfast sometime."
"Final Thoughts: Well played BDC, well played. I do not think I will experience a coffee beer that is quite this good again. This beer is so good, I'm pretty sure I won't be able to drink another Mill St Coffee Porter ever again. It's deserving of it's spot as the #1 Canadian beer that is for certain."
"Overall, delicious. Great sipping beer. Like chewing on good coffee beans."
"Finish is long and full of coffee like bitterness."
"The taste is a real zinger for me. The deep coffee and mocha flavors are just over the top. This has the flavor of strong ground coffee grinds, ABV, and just wild expresso. We sometimes refer to stouts as having some coffee like flavors, but in comparison to this beer, most of the porters and stouts that claim the coffee mantle are just pale imitators. This is the reigning champ of coffee beers if there ever was such a thing. The beer is quite creamy and smooth as well. I wish I were a coffee drinker and perhaps I would have enjoyed this beer, but alas no. The appreciation factor is just not there."
"DRINKABILITY: Coffee, chocolate, perfect mouthfeel. Theres not too much worng with this beer. (besides limited availability and a huge price tag). I could definitely drink another or two of these. If you can find this beer i recommend picking it up. What a treat."
"Very good stout, one of the best impy stouts I've tried in quite a while."
"An exceptional stout to say the least. Big flavours, perfect balance, excellent mouthfeel, and a ridiculous drinkability. DDC is a world class brewery and this beer proves it."
"Big coffee, slight alcohol, some chocolate, hint of citrus, slight bitter kick, a blend of roasted and pale malt flavors, some woody/earthen notes, and a nice warming finish with a bit of alcohol, coffee, and slight hop bitterness. For such an outrageous beer, this one is wonderfully balanced. Extraordinary body on this one, just very full and coating, without being syrupy and sticky. Creamy and velvety. Tremendous. Drinkability is great, especially considering the ABV. I could slug this down, though I want it to last for quite a while. I guess the closest thing I could liken this brew to is an amped up Founders Breakfast Stout. The finesse in this brew, however, is far superior to FBS (in spite of FBS's greatness). Definitely one of my favorite stouts, especially in the non-BA category."
"Overall - This beer has a lot of potential, maybe this was a bad batch but I really could see myself enjoying this if it were more than one dimensional bitterness."
"D- quite drinkable despite the ABV, a very addictive brew"
"A complex sipper would be an understatement. This imperial stout has a lot going on in it's flavor profile. A little less coffee flavor than I was expecting. Still a great RIS to try despite the price."
"It was like drinking burnt wood and charcoal in a burning house. Completely overpowering and smothering every other taste."
"Dark hazelnut brown to black in color with almost no head, just a halo of khaki colored foam that leaves little lacing. Gives off a roasted coffee smell, toffee, vanilla, chocolate, and hints of dark fruits (prune, raisin). There is some smoke in the nose as well with some woody earthy olive notes. It was a delicious first sip, with deep chocolate and coffee flavors that are beautifully subtle. Smooth roasty flavors of coffee merge into a dark chocolate finish with a comforting warm alcohol finish that lingers. The flavor plays well with a rolling sweet throughout going from roasty to bitter coffee to sweet booming once more. This is a very good beer. It is rich and complex, subtle yet very bold when all the aspects of alcohol, coffee and chocolate combine in a delicious harmony. It has a slick mouthfeel, chewy, full bodied and leaves a stick on the mouth with residual warmth relative to a barrel aged beer."
"Pours black with a dark tan head. Aroma is strong black coffee with some roasted malt. Flavor is similar with a lot of coffee and some bitterness. Also get some dark chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium-thick and very creamy. This one lived up to the hype."
"Overall this was a truly a wonderful Imperial Stout that certainly lives up to the hype. If only this were not $5-6 per 11.5oz. bottle, I would drink this quite often. Thanks again Kevin for the Darkness glass that is so well suited to Imperial Stouts. Highly Recommended."
"D - A nice imperial coffee stout I'd love to enjoy more (if it were a bit lower in price) but proves to be a slow sipper. Nicely done. If you spy this one, pick one up but make sure you like coffee."
"Not for quick drinking. Suitable for lingering over and savouring. A stern, but well made and enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability is pretty high, alcohol is practically absent. If there was more going on than the huge coffee profile, I'd find it to be more drinkable. A quality beer but one is plenty for me."
"Awesome brew to drink. I wish I had a 22 oz. It'd make a nice brew to have a few to warm you up on a cold winter's eve."
"Pours a beautiful black with a huge tan head that is very persistent. Awesome bitter coffee aroma with a bit of chocolate and a hint of underlying sweetness. Huge but very pleasant coffee taste. Dark roasted malt. Significant bitterness from the roasted malt and coffee. Maybe a touch of hops in the finish. A bit one dimensional but actually the coffee flavor has a lot of complexities. Very good creamy mouthfeel. Quite drinkable for the strength. I wasn't expecting this to be so good but it just works really well."
"Overall: C'est tres excellent!!!!"
"D: A dangerously drinkable Imperial stout, the alcohol flavor is practically non-existant. Great coffee flavor and very smooth on the tongue."
"I've been waiting a while to try this. I was going to go to Julio's to pick it up, but I surprisingly found it at Table & Vine a few days ago, so that saved me a trip. I drank it while eating eggs, bacon, and rye toast with apple butter, and it fit pretty well. Pours black with a decent tan head that leaves lacing all the way down. Smells of bitter coffee. Taste is quite amazing, big coffee taste obviously, a little bit of chocolate and vanilla. Alcohol is pretty much undetectable, the intense flavors cover it up very well. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and more or less perfect. Founders Breakfast Stout blew my mind when I first had it, this is very similar so it didn't have the same effect. It's a tad pricey but I will be buying this again in the future. Excellent."
"Good coffee stout but overrated. Nice head with very tiny bubbles like a thick mousse or whipped cream. The nose is bitter roasted coffee beans and ethanol. More espresso shows up in the taste with some roasted malt character and burnt dark chocolate. Not as complex as I'd hoped and the mouthfeel is that of a nitro can. The feel was medium thick, but thin on flavor and low on bubbles. Almost like it was sitting out open for a few hours. The mouthfeel is subdued; if the bubbles were sharper the beer would be better."
"Considering the powerful (coffee) stout this is, I am shocked at how well it drinks! I don't care what others have said, I could drink all four of these tonight with ease!"
"Black pour with a 1 finger tan head that fades quickly to a thin ring. Coffee, brown sugar, molasses and semi-sweet chocolate aroma. Lots of bitter black coffee and dark chocolate flavor with hints of raisins, alcohol and some faint vinous quality. Great depth and balance of flavors. Oily full body with lots of carbonation."
"D: This is a very complex and ""heavy"" beer. It got almost everything you want in a Imperial Stout. Some parts of the taste and smell is a bit more than I expected, but in the best of ways."
"An excellent coffee stout!"
"Give this one a try if you get the chance, I promise you will enjoy."
"D - A definite evening sipper, there is no mistaking that this beer is the product of lots of brewing time and effort. To me, it's a bit one-dimensional and could definitely stand a touch more depth. Still, it's a standout in its class, but definitely NOT to be compared to bourbon barrel-aged versions of the style."
"D - Not something I'd go to regularly, but good nonetheless. Light for the style."
"Is the coffee excessive? Some may say so...I think it's damn tasty! Coffee lovers will rejoice for this fine brew. I'd like to try this sometime in the future side-by-side with FBS to compare the coffee character."
"An impressive imperial coffee stout."
"D: One of the finest coffee stouts on the market. Worth seeking out."
"The mouth feel is also just right, the small and creamy bubbles makes the carbonation seem perfect for this kind of beverage and it foams up quite nicely with a swirl or two on the toungue."
"Slick mouthfeel. Little slick for an imperial stout."
"Overall a great coffee stout. A touch boozy but that usally doesn't bother me. Very happy I enjoyed this on my 200th review."
"8 years ago, this beer was notorious, and I'm glad I tried it, but there are much better beers of this style out there now."
"Drinkability. This beer is a sipper to the full meaning of the word. It is big, and full of dank flavor, and the alcohol is very, very well hidden. This beer is as drinkable as a big stout can get imho."
"D: One of the better imperial stouts I've had. The likeness to coffee/espresso is really impressive. I guess that's what you get when you brew with fair trade coffee beans. I think I would have liked this even more if there were some other flavors to balance out the coffee and make it more complex. That being said, however, this really is a world class RIS. Definitely give it a try."
"Drinkability - Smooth and delicious, as expected. This is by and large the best stout I have ever had."
"Overall - If this beer is a sin, then kick my ass to hell, because this one rocks. It doesn't have the same heady, luscious vanilla of KBS, but makes up for it with its amazing roasty coffee character."
"Pours an extremely dark brown color body, with a small tan brown head, diminishing. Strong aroma of coffee, espresso. All I get is the coffee. Very carbonated, strong coffee taste, biting. Might be the alcohol. Alcoholy aftertaste for sure. Roasted taste. A little too strong coffee and not much else for my liking."
"Pours the darkest brown color possible with a massive brown head. Aroma is a blend of espresso and dark chocolate. Taste is the same, starting with the bitter coffee flavor, blended with a bit of vanilla, but finishing with a dark, hershey bar flavor."
"The mouthfeel is a touch grainy, but overall really smooth. It tingles a bit and it's warm. It feels like melted chocolate in my mouth."
"M&D - despite being monotypic, this is a supreme beer, rich and flavorful, mellowed and smoothed from the lactose sweetness, it almost nears a milk stout to me, hides a near double digit ABV very well. this would be a beer cellar staple if they distributed in CT"
"I poured from a 11.5 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours like used motor oil, jet black and has a 2 inger tan head. The aroma is like walking into a starbucks, lots of coffee. The flavor is heavy on coffee, chocolate and maybe some vanilla. The finish lingers, slightly bitter. It is well carbonated and has a creamy mouthfeel. Peche Mortel is a solid coffee beer, but not a great coffee beer."
"D: Easy to drink, but I find the alcohol to be more prevalent compared to other Imp Stouts. Would not have more then one of these in a sitting, but will definitely purchase again"
"I bought a 12oz bottle for only $5-6, which is a pretty good deal for something this good. It doesn't' affect my rating, but is worth mentioning."
"While the majority feel this is a great beer, the alcohol is too heavy to enjoy the entire package."
"The more the beer warms up the better the beer tastes. I just wish there was a bit more body or less carbonation."
"Dark black, opaque, with an impressive tan head. Smells of espresso, chocolate, raisins, and some sweet malt. The flavor is much like the smell, with the coffee flavor being the most dominant. Alcohol is also present in the flavor, but is not overly dominant. Creamy and full bodied with good carbonation. A very nice beer which is a pleasure to drink. It would be a mortal sin not to try this one."
"D - Very goo example of style. Pretty easy drinking style to boot!"
"Pours an opaque black color with a brown head. Strong, powerful coffee aroma. Taste is like black coffee with some chocolate and roasted malts. Very, very good! Creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol was well hidden at first, but started to become noticable after the beer warmed up. Overall this is excellent, one of the best stouts I've had."
"This beer turns it up to 11, see. It's worth all the trouble it might get you into."
"Drinkability is amazing. If I had a few of these it would be hard to abstain."
"One of the best coffee stouts out there."
"This beer is like drinking velvet one of the best stouts I've ever had and truly a supreme example of a well crafted extreme stout."
"Yes it lives up to the hype. For me the best coffee stout I have ever drank."
"overall stands toe to toe with valdez as the best coffee stout available...."
"Why did I wait so long to try this? This one is a bargain, almost no matter what the cost. Go out a get a few, you'll be sorry if you get only one!"
"Mouthfeel has a thick velvety texture. Chewy body that paints itself across the tongue. This is a great sipper, and I'm really excited that it is now locally available."
"Without a doubt the best coffee stout I've tried (haven't had Founders yet though) - and one of the better stouts in general."
"Damn good drinkability. Good flavor but I doubt I could have more than one - kind of strong and might get a little too sweet after a while."
"(*I didn't mean to review this beer constantly referring to another beer, but truthfully this beer was EXTREMELY similar to Midnight Sun. Which means they are both great beers. But one is criminally underrated. Maybe it's because of the alcohol content...)"
"This is a perfect beer for when those Autumn nights start to get chilly. Its not viscous enough for a winter stout but its certainly warming enough. If you enjoy coffee stouts then you can't pass up Peche Mortel -- the coffee flavors are just so well-executed. I'm not convinced that this is better than Founders Breakfast Stout, but it is certainly in the discussion."
"Good full body, soft carbonation. Drinkability is good."
"Very good overall, no idea how fresh the bottle is as there is no date on it. Wonder is the coffee flavor is more pronounced in a fresher example."
"The first sensation is the smooth mouthfeel. Then the flavour explodes, launched by the power of the higher octane alcohol. This power subsides by the third or forth sip as my tastebuds calibrate to the amplified flavours. Like the smell, the same flavours are there. The finish has a medium-high bitterness that lingers with the alcolol-fruits and coffee. My only critisicm is that it's a bit acidic in the after taste. Otherwise, a great coffee stout."
"Review from notes taken on: 10/10/09."
"Pours a dark brown, almost black. Decent amount of carbination. Smells of coffee and roasted malts. A nice bitter coffee/roasted malt taste. So damn smooth. How the hell is this 9.5%? Just amazing. This is definately worth the hype. Fantastic beverage. I might have to buy another case of 24."
"12oz bottle, no best by/bottled on date, purchased at RSVP in Portland, ME on 10/2/09 consumed on 10/31/09. Poured into a shaker pint. Tight three finger tan head dwindles to one finger and sticks around, this sits over a black body. Huge coffee nose, chocolate syrup, dark roasted malts, coffee++. Huge bitter coffee and roast malt taste, some smooth chocolate, a little alcohol booziness that is pleasant, not too hot. Nice full body, thick, a little slick on the tongue, very creamy and smooth. Great lacing as the beer slowly disappears. This is a damn good coffe stout, I will definately be picking up some more, some to drink now and a few to put away for awhile."
"Highly drinkable, I can't believe how fast I'm drinking this. Thick, syrupy and pretty carbonated mouthfeel. This beer has everything."
"A wonderful coffee-infused stout. Delicious. Strong all-around, yet drinkable for abv."
"This and Founders BS are definitly the best stouts out there in my opinion."
"D - The 12 oz bottle was the perfect amount. I'd really like to get some more of this and have it around for one of those nights where I feel like treating myself."
"D: For 9.5% this goes down so so so smooth! For an imperial coffee stout this is dangerously drinkable and overall a fantastic beer. This is a world class beer for sure and one to be tried and tried again!"
"Well, my review got deleted for this one, I guess BA picks on me when it goes down, 10 reviews deleted so far. I remember the ratings but not the exact wording. Had this one in Montreal on tap, it really changed my beer drinking life, got me into craft beer. I used to describe this one as ""starbucks"" with 9% alcohol. Pours oil black with the most beautiful dark tan head that looks like coffee ice cream. Good lacing and head retention. Smells and tastes of roasted coffee and malts, some chocolate in there too. Its definitely the best coffee beer I have ever experienced thus far. Mouthfeel was a tiny bit watery for me, it was definitely creamier on tap. The carbonation is smooth and no alcohol really comes through. Perfect drinkability, the taste is enough for me to buy this one over and over again. The price tag does not matter when a beer of such quality is contained within the bottle. Amazing DDC."
"(D)- A superb stout that really puts the coffee addition front and center in the profile of the beer. Very much a stout and very much like coffee. This really gets better with age; it smoothes out and becomes a silky beauty that I actually prefer than fresh. Seek this one out if you enjoy coffee."
"D: Any mystique aside, this is one of the best beers I've tried in my life. Yes, I had to actively hunt it down, but this in no way skews my rating...I wouldn't care if you could buy this in front of the washroom of a Nascar event, or in a backcountry gas station....this beer is EXCEPTIONAL. Never thought a Canadian beer would ever exceed something by Unibroue....I thought wrong."
"Drinkability is fairly good for such a high ABV brew. The look, smell and taste certainly entice you to drink more. However, unlike coffee, you probably shouldn't down a lot of these to try and wake up. As an after-dinner dessert-type drink, definitely."
"Starts off with a nice nearly black pour into a goblet with a a medium bodied dark tan head about half an inch and dissipates in seconds leaving some minor lacing. Smell is of strong coffee with slight hints of chocolate and roasted malts. Alcohol sits at 9.5% giving it a bit of a kick but worth it all the while. Flavor is excellent with the coffee standing out tremendously but very well balanced with the other ingredients. I would have to say this is the best beer provided by Dieu Du Ciel and have drank it several times and hope there are many more to come. I revisit it regularly and have several in the basement aging just to see if it develops to be anything different. Can't wait to see what comes of it if anything. This is definitely not a beer to miss out on. If you have a chance to try this delicious concoction, take it."
"This is one of the great Stouts, scratch that, beers in the world. Rich, complex, impossibly easy to drink. A must try, especially if you like coffee."
"D- Moderate. Almost too much like a coffee. If you like coffee in your beer, you will go nuts for this one. I really enjoyed it, although I don't know if I'll be seeking this one out again... maybe I like my beer a bit more beer-like. The abundance of coffee has decimated any so-called 'beer qualities'."
"I wanted to open another as soon as I finished my first. I have class tomorrow, so I wont. I really want to though. I want to buy more and hoard it jealously, but I'm not sure if I could hold onto it long enough to consider it hoarding."
"Very dark maroon color with thick off brown head, good lacing and sustainability. Aroma of freshly roasted coffee with notes of espresso. Taste is reminiscent of burnt espresso, when you leave the pot on the stove too long. And the finish, unsurpisingly, is coffee."
"What really marks this beer out is how ridiculously drinkable it is. Without doubt its the best coffee beer I've had, and certainly the best coffee accented imperial stout. The flavours are in perfect balance, and there's just enough sugar to cut through all of the coffee roast to make it insanely easy to drink. Péché Mortel is widely viewed as the best offering from this brewery and the best beer out of Canada. It should be considered one of the best beers in its class in the world."
"This beer to me is the essence of ""doing one thing extremely well"". Yes, the beer is one dimensional, but it's a bloody amazing dimension. I really see this beer shining most when paired with food. The easy way would be paring it with a rich chocolate for dessert, but I think it could really shine next to a Vindaloo or some other extremely pungent food as it has the fortitude for pretty much anything. Be daring."
"This is my new go-to impy stout when I can afford it since we don't get Founders here. Thank you Canada."
"Pored pitch black with a sand colored head, smell was good with a bit of unpleasant soy saucy aroma in the background but it smelled mostly coffee and toasted walnuts. Taste was heavy on the coffee/espresso with a bit of smokiness towards the end. This stuff is smooth and pleasant to drink, Im contemplating having this with breakfast some morning. It tastes like 3/4 coffee 1/4 stout. The abv is extremely well hidden making this an easy drinker."
"This may very well be the best beer (or at the very least stout) that I have ever drank. If at all possible, try it."
"The beer is thick and full bodied, but well carbonated. The 9.5% abv is well hidden by the strong flavors, this is a very good coffee stout."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I would like. Perhaps a bit too carbonated for my taste, but still a very solid beer overall. Drinkability is very high given the ABV and style. If only I had this available in my area, I might just have to start my morning with this one."
"Notes: Part of the hype is justified: it is a notable and quality brew. The employment of fair trade coffee would feel more like an actual incentive and not a borderline frivolity if it specified from where or what they are using, in this form it feels gratuitous but tastes all right. A total sipper for coffee and stout lovers. I have a couple of coffee friends I want to share the next one with."
"A great brew for all coffee fans. Absolutely worth the high honors."
"D: The flavours in this beer are phenomenal, but the alcohol is very prominent, making this hard to drink more of. It's a great beer on occasion or for dessert."
"Drinkability is large, but make no mistake, this is a sipper. I love big beers, but would have trouble going thru more than 2 of these due to the bitterness."
"The Kings Of Hop"
"I always seem to miss this one on Bay Area shelves and ended up buying it in New Orleans. This is well worth the hype and a great blended coffee stout."
"Not as much of a sipper as one would think. Well hidden alcohol. Hard to set this down. One of the best examples of the style."
"D- A really interesting brew that is a must try for coffee fans."
"Overall: Good for a stout, but for an imperial not as full as I would expect. Smell was the standout of this beer for me. Would be in my top 20 IS's but that's about it."
"Great beer and drinkable. Thanks to joerodiii for passing this one my way."
"This is a thick beer that pours a nice black with brown edges when held to the light and a small head that settles quickly to a brown ring that lasts for the rest of the experience. It smells like roasty coffee. Very pleasant but not quite 5-worthy. The taste is a lot of coffee but not the bitch slap I was expecting. Much more complex than the smell... it's changing as it warms with the chocolate becoming more prominent. The mouthfeel is good and drinkability would be high except there's some alcohol taste towards the end and the price prevents me from buying much of this. Overall an awesome beer; one of the best coffee stouts I've had but not perfect."
"This has a sweet initial taste with a huge bittering aftertaste. The mouthfeel is super smooth and I couldn't ask for more. Toffee and dark chocolate accompany these espresso flavors. This is one intense beer and a grand imperial stout."
"This brew is a sipper, not to be drank to get buzzed - although a few of these will easily achieve that. It is a brew to sit and savor. A very big coffee flavor and aftertaste, very roasted brew. This brew is very good."
"God, I wanted to not enjoy this thing due to the price in all honesty."
"Consider this your fair warning. This is serious beer with all the intense roasted and acrid character of a freshly-pulled espresso shot. It is quite the punchy, balls-to-the-wall beer."
"Thoughts: This sin is definitely a win. I would like to try this with some age on it."
"Drinkability: delicious but with this ABV and cumulative flavor effect, I think I'm limited to one."
"Drinkability: This may be my favorite beer out of any I have had. The intensity and boldness really makes this a real sipper. I just wish I could get this a great deal easier."
"A very nice offering from our neighbors to the north. This one easily lives up to it's reputation. I think it'll be even more up my alley with a year or so on it. Looking forward to revisiting it."
"Medium to heavy bodied with a sense of oiliness and just a bit sticky."
"Pours a pitch black with a nice swirl of tan espresso foam. Aroma is roasted malt, some dark fruit, traces of hop, and pounds of vanilla. Coffee was barely detectable. Flavor was absolutely delicious: more vanilla with a pleasant and clean bitterness, with an alcoholic exhale. Strangely, an effect like coffee without the coffee flavor. Extremely rich and robust! Mouth was on target as well. It seems to coat your mouth, with a deep, alcoholic warming effect. Lovely!"
"Taste is very light compared to the aroma, you think its just going to hit you in the mouth but it doesn't. You taste coffee from start to finish, that's it. Not very complex or compelling. Mouthfeel is bad, not very drinkable."
"I love this."
"drinkability is good maybe a bit heavy for a 5 but a beer like this is a sip sit back and enjoy"
"D: Tasty, but not terribly complex. One of the most drinkable Imperial Stouts I've had - maybe even sessionable (though I'm feeling that alcohol). I'd order another pint, but I think this one is priced out of the buying-a-sixer range for me."
"Whoa... Tastes like coffee with a smooth, silky malt character. I also notice the instant warming feeling from this. It's as drinkable as coffee in my book. The coffee flavor is incredibly concentrated and the nose I get as I drink from my snifter really makes me feel like I'm drinking coffee. Towards the end of the taste is a bitter bite from both the alcohol and the bean flavor. There may be just a bit of dark ripe fruits, but not as I've tasted in other RIS's. The concentrated goodness that is this beer is an amazing thing to have pulled off. The mouth feel was a little flat I suppose but I can hardly hate it for that."
"Drinkability: If it looks like a coffee, smells like a coffee, tastes like a coffee, then it must a coffee? Wrong! It's actually a beer! The only problem I see with this beer is that this small bottle is pricey! It's pricey, but it's worth it! That is if you really like good beers and a finely roasted coffee."
"D - Drinkability is decent on this one. Alcohol is too noticeable or this would be a little bit higher. Flavor is really good tho...good beer overall, one in a sitting is perfect for me."
"This is an elite brew. If you can get your hands on it, do it. Theres only one place here I can find it, and I have been told that they wont be carrying it soon. :( I guess I'm going to have to buy up all that I can..."
"D: A really fine imperial stout that would be better off with less booziness and some downshifting in the coffee department. That being said, this is a unique taste experience that will be loved by coffee-stout heads everywhere."
"D - Good, but the coffee bitterness makes it a bit of a sipper."
"J"
"It will be like this until we begin to die off, no doubt. There's nothing we can't forgive or get past, no time that really matters all too much, the bonds were forged long ago, we'll always be the best of friends, the things our wives will never care about, we'll always have this in common."
"D: At 5.49 per 11.2 oz bottle, it would be tough to drink a lot of it. However, it is surprisingly drinkable and well balanced for the style. Bottom line is this beer perfectly marries coffee and beer and is among the best if not the best coffee stout I have tried."
"D: A fantastic brew with amazing balance and a wonderful mixutre of flavors. This was a real tour de force and certainly lived up to it's hype. Quite a powerful brew with the hops and the coffee providing quite a punch, not for the faint of heart. My first brew from Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel, but based on this experience certainly not my last. Definitely a ""go out of your way to find"" brew, so get searching!"
"Pours a dark, black color. 1/4 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, hops, alcohol, dark citrus, yeast, and some roasted malt. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and creamy with an average carbonation level. There is a noticeable tartness and slight bitterness. Tastes of coffee, roasted malt, hops, alcohol, dark citrus, and slight yeast. Wow, a great beer overall with some slight dryness associated."
"This beer is awesome the best coffee stout I've ever had I strongly recommend it to anyone likes coffee or beer but be warned this beer is not for the faint of heart."
"There's an upfront, rich, sweet, pruney aroma on this brew with obvious coffee. I get even more coffee in the flavor, but there's still a lot of that pruney/raisiny character. The coffee flavor is strong, although I've had better coffee flavors in other beers. The coffee in this brew seems a bit like old coffee grounds and/or overly charred coffee beans. I've had this one in the past, and I liked it better back then. I've had plenty of other coffee brews from around the world since then, so my tastes have become more refined. Having said that, I think PM is still a decent coffee brew. If you like coffee brews, definitely give PM a try, but there are plenty of other superior North American coffee brews now on the market."
"One of the best beers I've had recently."
"D - A tasty beer for sure. This is a bit of a sting from the alcohol. I think a bit of age might help that. Otherwise, a very very good beer."
" This all rounded to a somewhat sweet, long and warming finish."
"D - Definitely worth the hype as it is a great beer. Very rich and full-bodied. Wish I would have busted out a cigar."
"Overall, would I buy it again? Definitely. I think this is one of the best stouts I've had in awhile. Perhaps it is only surpassed by KBS in my books so far."
"D = This is a tasty good brew, but it is not highly drinkable. A little goes a long way. That said, I will definitely come back to this one though."
"Pours pitch black with a thick tan head. Smells like pure coffee. Has a medium to heavy mouthfeel. There is a subtle creaminess to it as well. Tastes like I'm enjoying a nice dark roast coffee. And I really like coffee. The coffee is way over the top and I really like that. Only slight hints of malt and hop appear here. This brew is for coffee lovers only."
"Pours a deep brown with a reasonable head due to generous carbonation. Aroma is very nice, chocolate and coffee dominate, but you have to take it in strongly. The taste is more of the same, great sweetness and coffee presence, almost like a chocolate milkshake but with a hint of alcohol and a nice balancing bitterness. The mouthfeel is near perfect for me, it's creamy and weighty without turning into an oil slick or sludge. I could drink this all night. Bonus for a great label design. I love this beer."
"Very enjoyable, the alcohol is detectable but not overpowering. The coffee flavor mixes well with the full mouth feel, giving the beer a balanced bitterness. If it wasn't almost $6 a bottle I'd look forward to having this again!"
"Overall I would say that I was pretty happy with the characteristics if this brew. Subtle/smooth flavors and smell with a 9.5% abv could get some of us in trouble"
"coffee stout indeed. would like to have it fresh on tap some day."
"Have one more in the cellar. Wonder how it'll turn out..."
"12oz bottle purchased at The Lighthouse in Manchester, Maine. Pours an opaque black body with a good inch of light tan head. Rich espresso and dark chocolate dominate the aroma. Roasty espresso and dark chocolate hit the palate initially, with some nuttines. Full bodied without being viscous, rich with vigorous carbonation from the bottle conditioning. One sip definitely invites another and this beer was gone way too soon. A bit pricey, but no doubt one of the best impy stouts I've ever had. No description I can give will do this beer justice."
"well done DDC keep making wonderful beer what more can i say"
"If Péché Mortel is not a mortal sin, it should be. And I shall. This beer is so dark it should be spelled with six e's: Beee eeer! Péché Mortel is incredible, and worth the price. It pours black, but there is this cool magenta corona where the side of the glass, the bottom and the light meet. Try it. The aroma was coffee, with alcohol bringing up the rear, (caught ya, you counted the e's in beee eeer, didn't you). The taste was coffee with a little cocoa, powerful but not abusive. The feel was thick, decadent and oily as hell. Drinkability, not really, but at 9.5 ABV go ahead and have two (you pig). This beer is definitely underrated, come on BA's. God, would I love to try this on tap once before I die."
"One of the best Imperial/Coffee Stouts I have had. Way too easy to drink, full of flavor and character, and absolutely refreshing."
"Had you make the trip out to julios lately to get this one. Vigorous pour create a creamy looking 1 finger tan-mocha head that leaves behind some frothy lacing. Big coffee bean nose with some alcohol in there. Taste is an amazing espresso chocolate rollercoaster with a roasted coffee bean aftertaste that leaves the tongue satisfied yet thirsty for more. Complimented by the rich mouthfeel with hint of carbonation and an extremely masked 9.5 the beer easily sits atop my list. Save it for a good day."
"the mouthfeel is good. perfectly carbonated, though a little too light. great drinkability."
"An excellent beer."
"D- I honestly wishi could drink this in the morning on the way to work. this is a phenomenal beer. I am impressed and it is by the far the best Imperial coffee stout i have ever had."
"Pours a pitch black with two finger tan head with lace sitcking to the glass. Coffee malts dominate the aroma, although I pick up traces of roasted and black chocolate. Taste is more of the same with a pretty much coffee malt taste along with some black chocolate and something like chocolate covered cherries for a slight fruit taste. Finishes dry but there is still some sweetness mixed with the coffee malts and some roasted malts. ABV hidden well and this is a great beer to enjoy anytime. Meal in a bottle pretty much."
"D- Easy to drink but rich indeed."
"This beer is one of the best coffee stouts I have ever had, if not the best. Being a big coffee drinker I find this beer highly drinkable with the only knock on the drinkability being the strong alcohol presence. If 9.5% ABV is not your thing, then I would recommend Surly's Coffee Bender. Another great coffee beer that is more along the lines of a session beer. But in terms of imperial coffee stouts, Peche Mortel reigns supreme."
"This may be the best coffee I've ever had, let alone the best coffee stout. Yum yum."
"Overall: Okay drinkability, the flavors are really strong. Very sweet with a smooth transition to very bitter. A lot of smokey character especially in the flavor. Great beer but best kept for special occasions or when you just want to sit and savor a bunch of different flavors."
"Overall, an awesome stout that has a very complex flavor that is dominated by the coffee. Yum."
"I really love this beer, perfect beer in the morning with some breakfast and whats better than starting your day with a nice buzz."
"D- Overall, this is a world-class coffee stout without question. I think it is a little overrated and overhyped on here, but it is a fine beer that is definitely recommended!"
"D: Good dessert beer, but not the best ImpyStout that I've ever had. Still tasty, and I like the coffee, but a little more chocolate, molasses, etc...would have been nice. Definitely a beer for someone into coffee beers. May try again with a little age. Maybe a barrel aged version, that could be interesting."
"Lots of great bitter and roasty characteristics here, coffee, chocolate dominate and complement each other very well. It had some alcohol spice to it, but was very full bodied and a joy to drinkn."
"M/D: Very full bodied, as expected from a stout. The alcohol isn't as powerful as I thought it would be, making this one pretty drinkable... if you've got a fortune to spend."
"I stuck it out and gave it my best but I'm glad that I only purchased a single bottle. Not my cup of tea, but based on the scores here it apparently is enjoyed by most."
"Completely deserving of the scores this beer receives. I'm very impressed with this Canadian brewery's brewering skills. Highly recommended."
"A thick, brown, impenetrable head. This beer is as black as motor oil! Aroma consists mainly of espresso, alcohol vapor, milky chocolate syrup, and a bit of vanilla. The taste is very bitter coffee, dried cherries, sweet chocolate and bourbon. Very assertive in every aspect! A very enjoyable brew, but one I could only have once in a long while"
"D: this is a brilliant stout. I look forward to enjoying another."
"D- This is an intense beer. Alcohol is hidden fairly well but the powerful espresso awesomeness makes no effort in subtlety."
"D - Definately a sipper. The flavors are so big and the alcohol is high. It's so delicious to drink though."
"Drinkability: While the flavors, mouthfeel and smell are all amazing, the alcohol definitely hurts its ability to much more drinkable than just above average. I am definitely loving this beer though and I will likely pick up another and let it sit for a while to see if it cools down any."
"Drinkability: Moderate at best. It is a very tasty beer, but a little overwhelming for sure."
"D: Rather drinkable for such a big stout. Nice coffee flavor, but it doesn't taste like coffee with a shot of beer added, which to me preserves its integrity as a beer. I think I may have let it warm a tad too much, because at close to room temperature it got a bit harsher. Keep this one in the 50-55 degree range and you're golden. Once it approaches 60-65, things get a bit harsh."
"This beer pours a very thick black colour with an equally thick, dark roasty brown head that has ok retention and leaves some patchy lacing on the glass. Incredible coffee aromas waft from the beer with definite notes of chocolate and a roasty nuttiness that lets the drinker know this beer packs a flavour punch. Taste is deliciously roasted coffee-forward with rich dark chocolate undertones, subtle dark fruit and caramel (I get a bit of maple sugar in there too). Mouthfeel is very rich and ridiculously creamy, mouthcoating and smooth with a spicy, roasty kick on the finish and linger. This beer is very heavy. However, it does hide its high ABV very well, so the drinkability is actually quite impressive. Truly a work of art. This high mark is well deserved."
"Drinkability - one was enough for me"
"If I liked coffee, I'd love this beer. But, I don't like coffee, so the best I can do is appreciate it. Very interesting and well done. Not that it's off the list, I think I'll pass in the future. But you should give it a bid."
"Great imperial stout, one of the best and more simple I've had"
"D- A more confectionary taste and less complex then the Founders Breakfast Stout. Probably a little more drinkable."
"Drinkability: On point. A very good RIS, especially for a coffee drinker, which I'm really not. It's a big one, but it's balanced and it's a pretty special package overall. I'll be interested to see how some of these age."
"kind of a slick mouthfeel. you can almost feel the alcohol too."
"D: My wife is trying to steal this right from under my nose. This is drinkable for the style and for the alcohol content...if you get it for a party, it may be too heavy for most casual beer observers, but that would mean more for me..."
"smooth and full bodied."
"D - Obviously not a sessioner but I'd read a lot about this beer and brewery and it lived up to expectations. Would love to have this again."
"The taste is great, but this is definitely a sipper. Due to that drying sensation, I'm not sure this is a repeat performer -- rather, I'd savor the one I had & either move onto something lighter or call it a night. Definitely a good showing."
"Overall an excellent take on a coffee Imperial Stout."
"Jet black with a super thick creamy head. Big time coffee on the nose. It makes me picture a cup of coffee in my mind. Taste is out of this world. Tons of coffee and chocolate but silky smooth. The coffee is perfectly clear and again, makes me think of a cup of coffee. Even better on tap than bottle. Certainly world class."
"Thanks to kkulacki for 12oz bottle! Color on pouring into a pint glass is dark, but with tones of brown as well, so it's not totally black. The head is cream-colored and with a fantastic amount of lacing. Taking a whiff of this thing, you can start to smell the coffee...and some alcohol from a few inches away. Closer sniff is all coffee/espresso and roast. On to the taste. The first hit is all coffee. Very strong coffee...then as it moves to the back of the palate, more of the bitter chocolate tones come through. There's definitely a taste of alcohol and it's very bitter on the finish, but not overwhelming. As far as drinkability, I'd probably only have one or two - it's definitely good, but a strong one and quite bitter and heavy."
"#18 at time of review."
"Alcohol bite is minimal if even present. Makes this one great for summer evenings or a winter breakfast."
"i would not rate this as a boom in your face extreme style beer like a a big RIS, and i think it fits itself well with where and what it is trying to be. the alc is high, but you wont notice"
"Drinkability is great; pretty much all you'd want out of a 10% RIS. I'm impressed."
"This black bodied beer has a dense and tightly packed dark brown head resting on top. The retention and lace qualities are very, very good. The nose consists of nuts, cocoa, dark berries, rum, anise oil and heavily roasted coffee bean. Very thick aroma and very complex. Absolutely perfect. Heavy flavor too. I am very happy with this one. Dark roasted malts ride out the whole experience. Char and burnt malt give some bitterness. Blackberry and ainse oil intermingle nicely. Again, with some heavily roasted coffee flavor. Nice oily texture. Alcoholic presence is minimal and integrates nicely with the bold flavors. Body could use a boost, but that's a very minor ""imperfection"". Otherwise, we are dealing with an exceptional beer here in all facets of the game."
"Great stuff."
"Simply one of the best coffee stouts I've come across. Pours jet black with only a hint of dark mocha when held up to the light. Has only a faint mist of head pierced by slicks of the beer underneath. The smell is of freshly poured cappuccino with generous amounts of cocoa powder combined with a bit of brown sugar. Mouthfeel is silk smoothness; not as thick or syrupy as some impys can get. The taste delivers on the strong preliminaries: pure mocha bliss. Just when you think that the bold espresso lead-in is going to be overwhelming, the sweetness of creme brulee (and a bit of banana bread) comes in to provide a bit of restraint. The sweetness then fades, leaving a lingering coffee aftertaste that is strong but not overly charred. I'll try to cellar a couple of these, but I must say this tastes fantastic fresh, leaving very little room for improvement. Should pair quite well with medium dark chocolate, smoked ham and gouda."
"Poured jet black, opaque, with dark brown edges. Fat, creamy tan head that sticks around and leaves a thick film of lace. Roasty coffee aroma, very strong. Some chocolate and vanilla, but dominated by the coffee. Viscous mouthfeel with a long, long finish. Powerful taste, possibly one of the strongest tasting stouts I've ever had. Bold roasted coffee and espressso throughout. Its laid on really heavy, like the blackest, most bitter coffee out there. The chocolate is not a reprieve. Dark and baker's variety. Just a bitter, bitter stout. Light vanilla and caramel flavors pop up periodically, as does a fuggels-like hop bite. Amazingly, this beer does the bitterness while avoiding the dreaded soy-sauce taste. The 9%+ is masked completely. Great beer."
"Drinkability- This brew is definitely one which I would have again."
"D- Wonderful, this stout caught me by surprise so much intense flavors hitting you all at once but in the end it all works out wonderfully. Thick, creamy, robust, malty, and just a pinch of sweetness makes this stout exceptional!"
"excellent beer! what a nightcap."
"An extremely rich coffee stout, without being too rich with overpowering sweetness. Very enjoyable. Recommended."
"Full bodied mouthfeel, long finish, sweet and roasty bitter, and delicious. One of the better stouts I've had in a while, and a fantastic coffee beer as well. Will seek this out again. Cheers!"
"one of my top 2 favorite beers...this beer is unreal...a must buy...its a toss up between this and oak aged unearthly ipa..gotta try unearthly 1 more time to decide."
"Highly recommended. I bought this bottle at Blacklick Liquor on Broad St. Probably not worth the $5.89 for a 12oz bottle I paid, but quite good nonetheless."
"A stunning big bold stout, on par with many I've had before however this has a stronger and more prevelant rich coffee bitterness"
"For the ABV for this beer this has a scary drinkability. At first the coffee amora is a little over powering but once you get your mouth around it it is an amazing IMS. Could I have more of this fuck yes, will I have more of these fuck yes. I have had this on tap at the brewpub in the past but it took an impressive bottle at home for me tonight to rate this....and good night."
"In the end, I feel that the Hitachino Espresso Stout is in the same upper price range, and is every bit as good, if not significantly better. Again, this ""Mortal Sin"" is damn good, but just doesn't live up to the hype."
"D-the body and alcohol would keep me from drinking too many of these. That rubber though... not sure what that is. Distracting."
"I couldn't drink more than a 12oz of this, I kind of struggled with that to be honest...very nice, just not my favorite."
"As expected, pour is thick gorgeous black crude. Sizable head of very dark chocolate mocha. Quite nice. Smell is all bittersweet chocolate, burnt coffee, and a touch of alcohol. Taste is much less hot than I anticipated, but there is a bitterness that I do not much care for, along with some char. The coffee is definately there, the dark chocolate too, but that sweetness has to contend a little bit too hard with the bitter burnt tastes for my liking. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, but not as smooth as say, Speedway or Ten Fidy. This is a sipper for me, and not a repeat purchase. The alcohol is in check, but the flavors are just too intense and aggressive for me. It is a good beer to be sure, but there are other impy stouts I prefer to this one."
"Bottled 11/07, finally, I get to review one of this country's finest, my Canada includes Dieu Du Ciel. Opaque black with a thin tan head and sparse, wispy surface. Thin but sticky lace, a fair bit of sediment is left in the bottle. The aroma jumps right out of the glass with rich molasses, tree bark, cloves, dark chocolate, burnt coffee. Taste features a bit of hoppy astingency that is well under control, black coffee, bakers chocolate with an aftertaste that lingers; bitter notes, dry brazil nut texture and mouthfeel. Alcohol cleverly integrated, superbly handled. Dense, rich in the mouth, head easily regenerates. Wow. Very, very nice. I would not hesitate to stock my cellar with this at every opportunity."
"A tasty find- I will be getting more to put down and try later in the year to see what aging does. Good out of the bottle as well."
"Smells like coffee, bitter chocolate, caramel and a hint of hops. Tastes pretty much like it smells. Chocolate and coffe up front with a strong roasty finish. Alcohol content is covered extremely well. Incredibly smooth, perfectly carbed. I could drink a bunch of these easily!"
"Péché Mortel is the perfect after-dinner drink, but also enjoyable on a hot lazy afternoon. It was a great experience that would appeal to non-beer drinkers as well as beer advocates. Very very nice."
"This is what it is about. Excellent beer. It is a little expensive at $5.50 a 11.5oz bottle, but it is worth every cent. It has got more complexity and body than Founders Breakfast Stout, so check this out if you like that brew. Highest recommendation."
"The taste for this Coffee Imperial is straight up Coffee, but it does not blow out your taste buds. The Coffee flavor is the dominant taste that is backed up by a Mollasses and Chocolate flavor. The three flavors for me felt well balanced with the Coffee in the front. This brew was very smooth and carbonation was perfect. This brew I think is the perfect example of a well hidden high alcohol percentage brew. After threw drink it's self the alcohol level still did not hit me and I left wanting to have more. Love this stout and will continue to drink more of it."
"This one pours a deep, dark brown - near black - with a tan head and lacing. The aroma is awesome - it is definitely coffee dominated, with some brown sugar and light, raisin esters. The taste is very good - nicely balanced, with notes of coffee and milk chocolate. The alcohol shines through in the end with a little heat, and mild astringency. The body is a little thin as well. Overall, an enjoyable imperial stout, but I would like to see a little more body and a little less heat from the alcohol."
"So drinkable. This beer is really intense so I wouldn't want to drink it too often or in too large a quantity but it's a beer I end up craving regularly. This is easily the best coffee stout I've tried and the standard by which I measure all others (until I find a better one, I suppose, but I'm still waiting...)."
"I'm not going to waste a lot of time with this review, because it's the simplest one I've done...hands down! If you like coffee, and you like beer, then this is your perfect brew. To me, it's almost like an iced coffee without the ice. The alcohol is barely even present, and all you can taste is COFFEE, COFFEE, COFFEE, and MORE COFFEE! It's as if you are chewing on coffee beans. As you can tell, I like coffee."
"This poured black as hell with the slightest red highlight appearing only when held up to light. The thin brown head didn't hang around for long at all. Aroma was of super strong coffee and chocolate. The flavor was totally dominated by super burnt malt and roasted coffee. I love coffee beer but i think the coffee flavor was taken too far. The feel was super velvety smooth. One bottle of this is all i would need due to the extreme coffeeness goin on here but its fairly drinkable as the alcohol is well hidden."
"single bottle from The Perfect Pour, Elkridge, MD"
"A lovely, let you down easy imbiber, in the sense that it makes you forget the initial full-frontal, and maybe overbearing flavour assault, so that you immediately plunge in for another go-round, and...repeat, until you're surprised the glass is empty, and the booze you didn't notice at all before decides to fully join the party. Worthy of its rep, a probably a lot more. Mon dieu, et d'habitude, je n'aime pas même de café..."
"This is a good beer, but I'm afraid that I'm in the minority who will not regularly seek out it out. For me it was just too one-dimensional on the coffee end. I'd much rather hit up some Founders Breakfast Stout if I am in the mood for an espresso beer."
"This beer pours an opaque black, with a half finger of tan head that recedes to a 1/3 inch film that remains the whole way down. Nice wispy lacing left on the glass. Nose is strong coffee, almost espresso-like in nature. There is a touch of dark chocolate, and the alcohol is very much present in the nose. The taste is very boozy up front but as the beer warms it subsides and is virtually undetectable. Deep roasted malts, with espresso flavoring hit the taste buds first. There is brown sugar, dark chocolate and a dry roastiness that borders on burnt. The finish has a light hop bitterness with some fruitiness that is perhaps slight black cherries. Fuller body, with decent carbonation, clean feel with a dryer finish. This is a great beer to sit with, a lower AVB would make it a way more sessionable beer but too good to want to put down!"
"Pitch black with a finger or so of brown foam. Nose is coffee and solvent like alcohol. Expecting this to be a very heavy brew. Flavour is dark sugars, black coffee, cocoa, toffee, dark fruity raisins and prunes, green apple, and a hint of vanilla and licorice. Magnificent soft, silky body is lightly carbonated and oh so smooth. Surprisingly not particularly boozy given the abv and aromas. Strong though, and warming. I see why this particular beer is so highly rated. Beautiful balance of coffee bean and rich dark beer. It's like a liquid coffee-bean-chocolate truffle."
"D: Definitely one of the most drinkable Imperial Stouts available."
"A really amazing example of this style. Highly recommended for beer lovers, coffee geeks, or dark chocolate lovers equally. This might turn a non-beer drinker into one if served properly and at the right temperature."
"Never would have guessed this was 9.5% just by tasting it. Very well masked and there was never much of an alcoholic burn that hindered the drinkability of this in any way."
"Great art on bottle i would love to date the girl with the snake !"
"Another beer I wouldn't have looked for if it wasn't for BA. Too bad I did not know about this when I was in Montreal last Spring to se eif it was on tap. Just an incredible imperial Stout. lots of espresso beans, chocolate, and some fruit character. Well balanced, not over the top. Worth a second go around."
"Update: I had this on tap at Dieu Du Ciel this weekend and it was a near-religious experience and it may well top my list as the absolute best beer brewed in Canada. Everything I liked enough to give it an A seemed heightened and the mouthfeel seemed much creamier so I knocked this up to full marks for everything."
"Drinkability: At 9.5% ABV, this beer is a sipping experience. Eminently drinkable. I really like this impy stout. Tis' a shame that this beer isn't more widely available. Well, might have to be convinced to take that trip to Canada after all..."
"D- This is a really nice coffee stout. I'm not sure it quite lived up to the hype but on the other hand it's kind of raw and just it is what it is which I like."
"Overall, slightly better than the breakfast stout, but not as good as the kentucky breakfast stout. A good beer that is easy to get a hold of, though a bit pricey."
"Drinkability: Wow...this is a fantastic brew. Very smooth, easy to drink, with a nice chocolaty sweetness and the robustness of coffee. It is a bit thick, but that is one thing I have come to expect and enjoy about an Imperial Stout. This beer is very drinkable, and fairly high in ABV, so be careful. I will be keeping my eye out for this again."
"Overall, I had high expectations for this beer and it did not disappoint. An excellent imperial stout - chewy, complex, and satisfying with massive coffee / espresso flavours. Well done, Dieu du Ciel."
"Success. Tasting at Julio's Liquors on 6/1/08. Delicious rich coffee aroma. Smooth like Santana. This is a fantastic stout. Sticky, sweet, a bit smoky. Hides its ABV extremely well, not caustic at all. This was almost impossible to find for months afterwards, but now is carried in most well stocked New England beer stores. Dessert in a bottle."
"Bottle Pours a deep black with a brown head . The head lasts well, and peduces excellent lacing. Aroma is of sweetness and smoke. Nice touches of coffee and nuts. Has a good carbonation. The mouthfeel is good. The flavor is a jacked up starbucks coffee but it's beer. A strong amount of coffee and sour bitterness. Has a watery texture with a medium to full body. A hearty full body. Arobust finish with a great lingering aftertaste. This is a solid good beer."
"I went on a coffee stout/porter kick a couple of years ago, but eventually got tired with the mediocre options available. This beer is excellent, however. For coffee lovers in Alberta, this is the one! The sweetness provides some balance, but the taste if you don't enjoy coffee, avoid."
"Immediately after cracking the bottle, I got a big whiff of rich bitter coffee.  It looked awesome after being poured into the glass; pitch black body (honestly, light could not escape this) with a medium tan coloured head that gave off lots of coffee aromas and maybe a bit of alcohol. The beer tasted amazing.  Lots of espresso right upfront, then some alcohol warmth and a bit of sweetness from the malts.  Left with a pleasant bitter coffee aftertaste that forced me to keep sipping.  Only small sips though, the amount of flavour in every little gulp was incredible. Of the few I've tried, this is by far the best coffee stout I've had."
"D- Moderation is key with this one. Although it drinks quite smooth, I would recommend against having more than one at once."
"D- This is not a beer for the faint of heart. Sit down and enjoy this one with a friend and relax. I could definitely drink another, but 2 would be my stopping point."
"This is the best beer i've ever had. Drink ability is great. For such a strong, flavorful beer i could go through a couple in a session. Words cant really express the full greatness of this beer, do yourself a favor and get ahold of one ASAP!"
"d - black coffee isn't really my thing, but a good beer is, and due to that fact i'd have this any time. probably not going to be for a session due to the high ABV, but i'd have a glass or two of this if i could get it again."
"D- Very non-offensive on the palate and the stomach. But I'd still drink it slowly as to enjoy it best."
"A semi-sharp feel and taste of raisin-coffee. Expected a bit more smoothness, but no biggie. Complexity fell short. This is a solid beer. A good warming with the abv, and a nice bite in the back. Thought the coffee would be more prominent, but to me the shortcoming of it was good..."
"D- A big sipper and a little one dimensional. I am a big coffee fan, and this is one of the few coffee beers that actually lives up to its name. The richness knocks down the drinkability just a bit."
"Péché Mortel pours an inky black that doesn't allow a bit of light to pass through, opaque even when held up to the light. The small brown head fades at first but comes back to maintain a nice thin frothy layer on top of the beer. The aroma is a first sweet dark and roasted malt that quickly gives way to rich oily coffee. There is just a hint of damp, stale coffee as well. Like the aroma, the flavor leads with sweet chocolatey dark malt but it quickly gives way to strong dark coffee. The crystal sweetness comes through again in the finish, but rich coffee lingers in the finish. There is just enough bitterness from the coffee and hops combined but no hop flavor to speak of. The alcohol is hidden but the sweetness shows the beer's strength and makes it a sipper for sure."
"Not quaffingly drinkable, but it shouldn't have to be. Every sip is dramatic and very enjoyable."
"11.5oz bottle. Black with a medium tan head that settles to a sparse foam slick. Slightly burnt green vegetal coffee aroma. It's a bit harsh to start but after thirty minutes or so, it mellows into a simply sweet and stale coffee aroma. A bit sweet on the tongue, but with an over-roasted and vegetal coffee character, that ends on an alcoholic and slightly burnt bitterness. Syrupy but also a little thin. I don't get this one. tastes like they burnt the coffee beans and then let the coffee sit out overnight before adding it to the beer. Honestly hard to finish this one."
"Mouthfeel is a little overly carbonated right off the bat, but as the beer warms this gives way to a smooth creaminess. Huge coffee bitterness all over the mouth on this one! An Imperial Coffee Stout this one is. This melds beautifully with the toasted chocolate that is also present. This is a heavy, heavy beer, so drinkability is not the highest. I honestly couldn't have more than one in a sitting. But drinking that 'one' is one of the more pleasurable experiences of my beer-life. Excellent beer."
"D - I think a coffee drinker (which I must admit - I am not) will really like this beer. For me, the creamy texture and toasted malts work really well to give a strong flavor but not so much an overpowering presence. The high alcohol that slowly builds in fire help to allow one to try this beer possibly to have more the one. Good after dinner drink."
"For the style it's great. For me... well I am not much of a coffee fan, so the bold coffee flavors are a bit of a turn off, hampering drinkability."
"D - Stunningly delicious coffee stout that is definitely worthy of all the hype and acclaim. This is simply an outstanding, world class coffee stout to say the least."
"Pretty amazing, even the alcohol is masked so well I'd call this a fantastic session stout if I didn't know any better. Plus the coffee blends in so effortlessly with the roasted malts that if I didn't know about it in advance I'd say that it was all on the part of the malt. Very nice to come across an overhyped beer that finally lives up to its reputation."
"D: An excellent brew that you want to take your time with in order to properly savor it. Definitely one of the best (if not the best) coffee beer I've come across. And as a coffee lover, I am picky about this. Highly recommended...seek this out!"
"Péché Mortel pours pitch black with a slow forming, thick, dense, lumpy, mocha-colored head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a strong roasted coffee aroma. It is full bodied and very smooth with a quick finish that kind of leaves the tongue in shock. It is well bittered and very roasty. There is a slight hint of sweetness, like molasses. It's well balanced and warming. It's not for chugging. It took be a couple hours to get through the glass."
"No hint of the big alcohol, sip with care."
"An exceptional beer, too much coffee roast for me to have more than 1 in a sitting but it is a great 1."
"This is among the best beers I have tasted. The beer is dark with a decent espresso colored head. The smell and taste of coffee in this beer is unlike other coffee stouts I've had before - the taste is strong throughout and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. The mouthfeel is of moderate thickness, really perfect to complement the taste. I could certainly drink this one every night."
"Pours the blackest black with no light coming through. A hard pour gives a thick tan head that settles to about one inch. Aroma is burnt coffee. Taste: WOW that coffee hits you right up front and is a bit overwhelming. As the coffee finally settles down you get the alcohol warming through. All the senses are there to indicate this is a well-crafted beer; there is only one problem. I don't like coffee. Obviously this is not the beer's fault, and I was able to enjoy it anyway. But for anyone who does in fact like coffee, this is surely one of the better beers you'll come across."
"This is a great beer, plain and simple. I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but I liked this beer a lot. Still, if you don't like coffee, you might want to stay away, as the coffee flavor in this beer is huge. If, however, you do like coffee, or are indifferent about coffee and just like good beer, then this beer is worth seeking out. Recommended."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is carbonated and sticky. The body of the beer is rich chewy and very thick. The finish of the beer is very nice and lingers pleasantly on the palate. I must say that this is a great beer. It has the depth, the richness, and full body flavor like a RIS. Now, this beer has a depth that needs to be further explored. As my mouth relished the wonderful taste that this beer presents on the palate, my taste buds are tingling with excitement and are rejoicing. I love this beer. I am going to round this up and say wow. The hype must live on."
"Poured from 11.2 oz bottle into snifter. Pours jet black with a line of tan head. Smells like liquor and coffee. Taste is amazing, a perfect mix of coffee and roasted malts with good chocolate undertones. Light medium mouthfeel. Great drinkability. Great beer but not quite on the level of Founders Breakfast Stout and Great Divide Espresso Oak Aged Yeti, which I believe are better especially for the price. I would definitely never turn down a bottle though."
"Very creamy and smooth. A touch of the alcohol as it goes down. This beer an impressive blend of the chocolaty sweet stouts and the bitter complex coffee stouts."
"Well... right upon opening take a good sniff right out of the bottle, it smells DELICIOUS.. coffee and vanilla bean and some cocoa, amazing.. Pours a brownish/black, not totally opaque when you pour it (though it is in the glass) with very thin cream-colored head. Doesn't look like motor oil, unfortunately.. Tastes like cappucino, dark chocolate, etc.. not super strong flavor like KBS, though definitely very good. It does have an organic, natural quality to it. Bitter black coffee at end of the sip. Mouth isn't the most viscous thickness ever, but still very nice. Slightly chewy with prominent carbonation. Overall its pretty great, not too heavy so you can have more than one, but just short of perfect."
"glad I got try this, and wil certainly go for it again!"
"This poured an opaque black with dark tan head. It smelled like fresh coffee grinds and alcohol, with some roasted barley and licorice. It tasted like strong bitter coffee (fresh grinds, roasted beans, and burnt beverage), with potent alcohol and some licorice and charred oak. It became much richer and creamier as it warmed, and the alcohol notes subsided. It was oily with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste with some alcohol warming. Overall this was a very strong beer that's definitely meant for sipping. It had a very nice coffee flavor, but was nearly overwhelming. Alcohol was pervasive at first, but became much more subtle as I drank. Very nice body, too. I think age could help mellow this out, since it's pretty hot fresh. This is otherwise a great beer."
"D= Wow this was an outstanding beer worthy of any hype it generates. I found it to be supremely drinkable and surprisingly the abv was not a factor at all."
"I will buy this one again and again as I see it in the store in singles for myself or one for every two people at a tasting."
"Perfect Imperial coffee stout, so well balanced, and drinkable. It is very easy to overdo one aspect or another of a beer like this, but it all played so well together - the malt, coffee, alcohol, and roastiness."
"4.5 D: I could drink the hell out of this. If it didn't have alcohol, I'd be downing these like crazy when finals period comes around."
"With this many ratings and this high of a score, it's not like I'm going out on a limb with a statement about how wonderful this beer is."
"Overall I have to say I was expecting more out of this one. It gets a lot of hype, but I'm having trouble pinpointing what about it would set it apart from other top-shelf imperial stouts. The balance is quite nice and it's highly enjoyable, just not as good as I was expecting. That said, this is still a fantastic stout which seems to really open up with some more complex flavors as it warms."
"Mouthfeel left a little to be desired for me. Slightly thin and lacked the viscosity you expect from a big stout. Still is was very smooth and drinkable. Extremely highly recommended if you enjoy coffee stouts -- Doesn't quite live up to FBS in my book, but a close second in class."
"great work DDC!!!"
"Taste is well worth the hype. An absolute coffee bomb, tastes like fresh coffee, without being too over the top about that aspect. The coffee flavor dominates, licorice and sweet cream sugar take a second. Not a lot of chocolate malt, the roastiness and coffee reign supreme, and are the lingering flavors thereafter. Just a hint of hops to help cut through all the gobbledegook. Nice and creamy, not the biggest, awesomest mouthfeel, but enough to carry the flavors forward. I don't like to give 5s easily for any aspect, this is right on the cusp, but the flavor is concentrated enough, yet carries enough else to it that it warrants it, barely. Drinkability is great for something of this magnitude. A little boozey on the throat after, but you hardly notice, since you're drowning in coffee awesome. I want more, nao. Top notch!"
"D - Creamy, delicious. Unbelievable in flavor and needs to be experienced. One of the best beers in the world for sure."
"I've just had my first Peché Mortel and I'll tell you this: it's not going to be my last, not by a long shot. Big, roasty flavours with complexity and balance, liveliness in the mouth (but not too much; think Unibroue on just a sweet little dose of valium), and a very more-ish drinking profile combine for a near-perfect brew. Best coffee stout I've had yet. A ""mortal sin"" worth perdition."
"Overall this might be my favorite beer if I had to pick one, but it's definitely in my top ten. If you're in the mood for a coffee/chocolate stout, this is the best bet if you can find it. Derishous."
"Pours black as night with a nice tan head into my Dogfish Head snifter. Smells like coffee/expresso, and sweet chocolate. Tastes like strong coffee stirred with milk chocolate along with a small dash of alcohol at the end. The finish on this beer is great...just like I finished a cup of freshly ground coffee or took a nice expresso shot after dinner. Mouthfeel is rich and think (but not too think for this beer) and I enjoy every sip. I will drink this beer again, no doubt. This is a great beer to end a wonderful dinner or just when you're looking for some expresso/coffee without drinking actual expresso/coffee. A must-try."
"A fantastic beer. Definitely let this baby warm up, when its cold, it has that mineral taste which is very off. That said, a very good beer, very powerful, definitely a sipper."
"This is the best beer that I have ever had. If you like chewy, balanced, knock-your-socks-off flavor, seek this one out"
"If you like coffee stouts and haven't had this, you are missing out."
"I picked this sucker up at MarCellars in Idaho Falls. It's in a bottle, but the date mark is not informative enough for me to be able to announce her age;) This Coffee Stout pours dark dark like motor oil, but not so thick; it's dark as night as a whole, but really thin, so when it's held up to a bright light, it's difficult to recognize how dark it is because it appears to be a darker nut brown. It hit my mouth with a rather lite/bubbly booze reinforced warm Imperial feel. The decent and rather thick head dissipated quickly to not hardly a trace being left on top and nearly no lacing either. Huh...odd I think, but hey...it's a double stout pushing the 10% mark, so I suppose that it should be expected. Quite frankly I'm a bit embarrassed to say that there's not enough coffee coming out in this one, rather a chocolaty alcohol. Most certainly belongs with the bitter ones which lingers on and on. One thumb up for the beer on its own and one down for being a five buck brew to marcellars, but muchO thanks to Marcellars for carrying some really good beers!"
"it pours black with a decent tan head. great retentive lacing on my Triple Karmeliet glass. the nose is dry chocolate, bitter coffee, spicy hops, a little bit of alcohol spice. the taste is very bitter, dry, coffee beans, dark chocolate, subtle wood,full bodied, low spritzy yet smooth carbo. leaves a long lasting delicious taste in your mouth. Good stuff..."
"This one left me with an incredible buzz from just one bottle, maybe because its brewed with coffee. The appearance is a dark black with a light brown head. It smells of spices and strong coffee. It tastes much like a great coffee with so much intense flavor, definitely meant to be sipped and enjoyed. It has the slippery feel of oil in your mouth. This is a true masterpiece"
"Overall a fantasic beer. The appearance was dark and chocolate. The smell was really good for a beer like this. The taste was exceptional, burnt, chocolate sugars, coffee, mouthfeel burns like it should. The drinkabilty was fantastic for a beer like this. Don't pound it just enjoy it !!!"
"In all, a great beer. I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of stouts."
"I expected a world class imperial stout and was not disappointed."
"Merci beaucoup, Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!"
"Poured a dark brown, with a thin tan head. Smell is of coffee, with only a hint of malt sweetness. The taste was more of the same. A good stout. If it was available in Northern California, I could see myself drinking more of this."
"If you like coffee stouts this is your beer."
"Drinkability - Full, rich flavor. Very nice sipping beer that does a dangerously good job of masking it's alcohol content."
"This is one great coffee stout. So rich and complex while still highlighting the coffee front and center. I'll keep this one on my wants list!"
"Drinkability: The smell is amazing. I could probably only have a couple due to the high ABV. The alcohol is noticable to me. Very good and complex. This is a sipper and this beer gets more bite as it warms."
"Poured from a 11.5 ounce bottle into my shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a dark brown, nearly opaque color with a solid two fingers of creamy chestnut colored foam. The foam leaves a thick lacing on the inside of my glass as I sip my way to the bottom. The nose is unmistakeably that of fresh roasted espresso or other rich coffee beans, dark chocolate, deep roasted grains, alcohol, and molasses. The taste is full of coffee and chocolate. I can tell that a high quality coffee was roasted and infused into this stout. Bittersweet chocolate and baker's cocoa are also present as well as molasses and mocha. I'm not to keen on the bitterness that comes through in the finish, it just seems out of place. If it was wasn't for said bitterness, I would have scored a 4.5 for taste. Full bodied with medium carbonation. Overall, a fantastic coffee infused stout. If you like coffee, you'll dig this one."
"Peche Mortal is one of the biggest coffee stouts I have ever had. It pours out black and thick as coal and has an aroma of fresh roasted coffee and hint of chocolate. The taste is almost pure coffee with splashes of chocolate,anise, and alcohol. It would make a good after dinner beer or for the hardcore a great breakfast beer."
"D: Very smooth for such an intense beer. If it wasn't $10 a bottle, then I'd rank this higher"
"D: This is a great beer with a wonderful espresso-like coffee profile. Rich, rather complex, powerful and dense. Even though the coffee flavors take the lead, it still feels very well balanced."
"D: this ought to be available in 750ml bottles, I wish I purchased more, quite complex and unique for the style, I haven't really experienced a combination of smokiness and coffee like this in a beer before"
"Thanks RyanC84"
"D-This is an awesome beverage, and my last bottle I brought back from this brewery on my trip to Montreal. At least I saved the best for last. This Imp. Stout produces a feeling of well-being that extends beyond the palate."
"Overall I would say this is a very good beer. I am not sure it is worth the price but I am glad I got it and would recommend stout and porter lovers to try this beer. Great coffee and smoke notes great beer."
"D: Delicious and pretty high in alcohol, but I don't think that could dissuade me from drinking several of these in a sitting."
"Overall, this one is a sipper. Very complex AND filling. Very flavorful and I really enjoyed the coffee. I don't think I could enjoy two of these in one sitting."
"D - Very good. A great, complex dark malt character that never becomes cloying or harsh and allows the beer to be an unusually drinkable example of the style. This is a wonderful beer that lives up to its hype."
"Notes: In my opinion Peche Mortel and Founders Breakfast Stout are very similar beers, but I think that Founders Breakfast Stout is just a little bit better. While they're both coffee intensive, Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel's Peche Mortel is almost too much like coffee and too little like beer, whereas Founders' Breakfast Stout it much more balanced. Despite that fact, the richness of this brew is almost unparalleled, and you can't help but to feel a bit sinful while drinking it."
"Mouthfeel is great.. silky smooth but drinkability for this style is average.. no one is pounding these back."
"Overall: I really love this beer and wish it was easier to get a hold of. Very unique and fruity variety of stout."
"D: The big huge bitterness of this one makes it a slow sipper for me. Its feel help make it go down a little easier."
"I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes good coffee, and some bitter dark chocolate."
"A fine stout to be sure with a burnt blackness well in control and balanced with an ease about it thats quite unique and easy to handle and drink. Glad to see its become available here in the TC area...finally. I'll probably pick up a few more bottles next time I see it stocked."
"Pours dark black with a small tan head that quickly settled to a thin cap. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Has a chocolate malt aroma with hints of dark fruit and coffee. Just a hint of alcohol is detected. Malt flavor up front. Chocolate and slightly fruity. The coffee does not come into play until the finish. This coffee stout is much more balanced than other coffee infused beers. A little warmth from the alcohol in the finish. Big body with low carbonation. Creamy and a good texture overall. I enjoyed this beer. The high ABV and high cost limits the amount I drink of this beer. Not the big coffee beer I was expecting but a balanced stout with fresh coffee flavor. This is a good stout with coffee flavors, not coffee with some beer flavor."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a true, opaque black color. The tan head was three fingers thick and retained nicely as a cap that became rocky after a while leaving excellent curtains of lacing all the way down. The aroma smelled strongly of fresh coffee, bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt. The flavors were rich and delicious. I tasted hints of chocolate malt sweetness first then lots of deep, rich coffee, bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt, espresso and hints of pipe tobacco. The bitterness was distinct but not biting and the finish lingered pleasantly on my tongue. Notably acidic, especially because of the coffee, but this helped cut through the thicker body of the beer. The mouthfeel was smooth, the carbonation soft and the body full. I thought this was excellent, like drinking a cup of fresh brewed coffee that just happened to be alcoholic and served chilled. If you like coffee stouts like I do you cannot miss this."
"D. One of the most drinkable Imperial Coffee Stouts out there. I can see why it placed on the ""Top Big-Ass Stouts"" list. Delicious, and very easy to drink. I'm glad I bought a few bottles."
"Opaque and pitch black with fizzy tan lacing. Smell is loaded with coffee, with some orange and nuttiness in the background. Taste is a nice mix of dark chocolate, orange peel, espresso, and mint. Alcohol only rears its head in the slightest sense. Mouthfeel is very thick, creamy, and silky, and possesses some milkshake-like characteristics. This doesn't taste anyway near its strength and is extremely drinkable. Excellent."
"Bottle from fiver29. Poured black color with a large brown frothy head that mostly lasted with . Moderate to heavy roasted coffee and dark chocolate aroma. Medium smooth body. Good complex combo of sweet coffee and bitter chocolate with a moderate to heavy roasted bittersweet finish that was strong and lasting. This is a standout brew."
"A bit complex to be very drinkable, but I could definitely enjoy a few of these."
"D: 9.5% are you lying? Great beer, will seek out a few and make others drink some."
"Thick as hell and silky. Coats the tongue with bittersweet combination of citric coffee and tons of dark chocolate. Slight hop bitterness, and I am suspecting that some of those hops are contributing to the citric flavors as well. Finishes sweet and sugary, doesn't quite get to the point of being cloying. Alcohol is noticeable and is accompanied by the same hints of dark fruits as in the nose. The alcohol adds richness to this similar to the way rum adds richness to tiramisu. Definitely a sipper."
"D - Spectacular. This beer could be equally at home with brunch or for a nightcap. It does offer a slight buzz, but there's no hint of alcohol on the palate. A great slow sipper, this beer exceeds all my expectations."
"An absolute must-try for the coffee-loving BA. Dieu Du Ciel has absolutely nailed the style."
"For a rich, filling, Double Stout at 9.5% abv, this is simply delicious and all I want is another one. I remember loving this at the VT brewer's fest. Thank God that this is now available in MA. Hands down, this is one brew to seek out. I can't wait to sample Dieu Due Ciel's other offerings."
"D: A little too strong and pungent to be excessively drinkable, although it is still quite drinkable for its style. All in all, this is an excellent offering and I'm quite glad I was able to finally get my hands on some."
"The alcohol was very well hidden in this beer. You could probably sit down and drink a couple of these."
"Overall: Wonderful wonderful stout. This is what i look for in a stout and I'd put it up there with the best of 'em!"
"D- God I wish it was lighter! If so, it would be a great session beer. Because of its heaviness, as all coffee stouts are..its a dessert beer..to be slowly savoured and enjoyed. Boy did I enjoy it!"
"Pours dark milk chocolate color and settles in an opaque, near black liquid with a modest cream coffee colored head that slowly dissipates to a thick crown with some bubbles. Nice lacing and liquid tends to slowly coat the inside of the glass. Aroma is exactly like ground coffee beans with a slight bitterness. Body is very thick and creamy, with little carbonation poking through. Strong milk chocolate sweetness and coffee dryness, but little bitterness. Alcohol also provides a warming sensation in the finish. Definitely upper tier of coffee stouts, but missing something for me to put it over the top into the omg-category of stuff like the founder's stouts or speedway."
"coffee gets overpowering. im glad this beer is only 12 oz."
"Smooth creamy mouthfeel, nice and soft. Goes down smooth, and with 9.5 ABV it goes down EASY, I love this beer, and Im going to have to go back and pick up more of these to share with friends."
"D-If this was cheaper i would be in real dangor of being an alcholic, this is the type of thing I could make an excuse to drink woth any meal any time"
"mouthfeel is an upfront bitterness that quickly givesway to smooth and rich finish. This would be dangerous if it were cheaper."
"Drinkability- Great drinkability for a big and thick beer. Very very good overall. Certainly worthy of its status as one of the best."
"Very nice! I remember it being much better on tap but if this is the closest I can get to it, it's more than good. I'd definitely buy another bottle to age."
"Drinkability: Incredibly well balanced, and one of the first beers with coffee that didn't have an overpowering coffee flavor. Very good beer, and well worth the hype. If it weren't so expensive, I'd definitely seek it out more often."
"D - Can't give this a 5 as the alcohol does creep up on you as get into the beer. But damn is it inviting. A great beer, a great coffee stout, however Founder's Breakfast Stout still holds my number one spot. I did buy two other bottles to compare after a year or two, but I'm not sure I'd want any of the bitter roasted flavor to fade in this one."
"A great representation of the style combined with an impressive aroma. I wonder if I am going to get a caffeine buzz. Highly recommended."
"D: An epic brew worthy of its cult following. I don't even like coffee that much, but this beer makes it work."
"Jet Black creamy off white/brown head starts thick ends up 1/2 "" Swirling produces short lived but serious lacing. The aroma is prominent coffee, malt, some hints of chocolate and an occasional whiff of sweet cream and butterscotch. Taste produces initial sweetness, the coffee is immediately apparent. This is quite complex with bittersweet bursts of taste weaved in between syrupy malt. This reminds me of Founders Breakfast Stout with espresso and some syrup. The last taste is a bit on the bitter side with a strong alcohol warming. This is thick and chewy just like I enjoy em. For me mouthfeel is hard to describe but when I taste them I know them. Drinkability is great for what this is but I'm afraid I am 1-2 and done for this one. This here is a tremendous offering but not at all sessionable."
"D: Not bad. I tried this mainly out of curiosity, because coffee stouts aren't my thing. However, on general stout terms it has a very good body and feel, and it certainly lives up to its claim of being a coffee-flavored beverage. If I ever get into coffee stouts I'll come back to this one."
"A very tasty brew that gives Breakfast Stout a run for it's money. Time for a side-by-side comparison."
"Man this baby is smooth I put a couple of these away no problem to bad I only have one."
"This is a drinkable beer that should be savored by sipping. The alcohol content is covered so well with the coffee flavor, it's almost like having a coffee drink rather than beer. Interesting."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly drinkable - even dangerously so. A great stout."
"Absurdly drinkable and delicious."
"I would seek this out again for sure but you can't drink a bunch in a row. It is pretty heavy."
"Péché Mortel is pricey, but well worth it. My new #1 Imperial (coffee) Stout. I can get FBS for about 11$ a 4-pack, so it will always be a great go to beer for a coffee stout fix, but Péché Mortel will be the one when I want to treat myself."
"D: Pretty drinkable for how big of a drink this is, its just light enough in body to stay a bit above ""sipper"" level. This is one of my favorite beers hands down. Pick this one up or trade if you're a coffee fan."
"D - Peche Mortel is an excellent coffee beer but in the end this isn't one of my favorite styles. However, I can certainly see how it excels over many of it's counterparts. Ultimately big strong coffee flavored beers with the added big ABV make this a little less than drinkable for me. Objectively the experience is an intense one, and personally these just aren't flavors that I care to gulp down too quickly. A decent beer, but not worth the money for my palate."
"Notes - Fantastic. Just fantastic."
"Pours very black and viscous. The light brown head is made of very fine creamy bubbles. The smell is without a doubt coffee. Not so much of a smell from roasted barley, but more a definite authentic coffee. There is some sweetness behind there as well. The taste has much roasted barley along with the additional coffee flavor. Sweetened dark chocolate in the taste as well. Thick and creamy in the mouth but not tooo thick. Very good beer, although the roastiness/coffee left in the mouth would limit me wanting to have too much of it."
"D- I wouldn't drink this late at night, I'd be up all night. Personally I like my coffee in the morning but still very enjoyable and would drink again"
"Impressive, to say the least. This one might make me drink coffee again. Fairly one dimensional... not as much depth as some of the other coffee stouts, but the beautiful roasted coffee notes makes up for it. This one is almost too easy to drink - the alcohol hides nicely... definitely worth seeking this one out."
"D - I am glad to have kept this on my wants. I have almost finished this one and am ready for another. A delicious stout that isn't overly sweet or filling like so many others out there."
"Pours a very dark brown color with just barely there ruby hightlights. Nice fluffy brown head that dissipated into a cap. The aroma is of coffee and high grade chocolate milk, some vanilla/rum spice that lets you know there is going to be some booze in there. Very big roasted coffee bean flavor hits hard and often right at the bell. Bitter sweet chocolate makes its presence known throughout with a touch of raisins in the end. Exceptional feel, thick and chewy, smoooth yet has a light prickly carbonation that breaks up the body. Finishes bitter from the strong roasted coffee flavor, alcohol is well hidden. Great coffee stout, excellent flavor and feel. It is heavy and has a high ABV so that would limit me to one but very nice."
"Mouthfeel is fairly thick, but with a light, sharp carbonation. Pretty smooth overall. Delicious, even for a non coffee-drinker like myself. Very, very good."
"D - This one's definitely a treat, and if it weren't my last bottle, I'd definitely be asking for round 2."
"I still give it high marks for the ""bean"" boldness that it puts forth. I really am floored by this brew!"
"Drinkability is high, this is a quality coffee brew. If you don't like coffee brews, this won't be your converter, but if you do, it doesn't get much better."
"Very nice. Not hitting me as best in the world caliber but I wouldn't kick this out of bed... or out of my glass."
"Overall, the coffee flavors took the spotlight on this one. This had the most coffee flavor of any beer that I've had to date. Exceptional and easy to drink. Highly recommended."
"Just a little too much coffee to keep me wanting to drink more and more of this."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer and I think the complexity to the taste and aroma make it a very interesting beverage to have. I will hopefully get to enjoy it again in the near future."
"D-A very tasty beer, with a strong coffee character, but not even close to drowning out the other flavors. Exquisite!"
"Overall: I put off trying this one for a while and now I have no idea why. This is an amazing imperial stout. I think coffee makes a nice addition to any brown, porter, or stout but in an imperial stout it might be the best because of the way it balances out the sweet malts. This is a must try and it's completely understandable"
"Well this one didn't let me down. Certainly delivered on all fronts. Sweet, but not too sweet. Definitely recommend this."
"this is maybe almost a 5/5"
"11.5oz bottle into a Corsendonk Tulip. Pours a dark almost opaque black with a two-finger tan head. Aroma freshly ground coffee and cocoa powder, quite fragrant. The taste is like a smooth chilled mocha drink, alcohol is barely noticeable at first sip, but does show some presence in the finish. The beer is medium bodied, like I already said, the alcohol is very well hidden. This one is without question, one of the best stouts I've ever had."
"Overall quite good, but over-rated."
"Edit: Almost an hour later (yes im still drinking it), and I still have a 1/2 finger of head."
"D - This is a very good Stout, very thick, I do not need more than one in a sitting, but that one really sicks with me"
"I've had a lot of high rated coffee stouts and this one takes the cake easily, without a doubt."
"I could not manage to drink more then one of these. Its a little to bitter for my taste though."
"I loved this beer. A nice smooth black pour with a head of tinted cream on top. One of the best (if not the best) coffee/chocolate tasting stouts I've have had. I love coffee stouts but when I tasted this one, all others (except for Founders Breakfast) left my mind. A strong mocha espresso aroma with a hint of alcohol. The flavor was very rich espresso with chocolate waves and a bit of bitterness. I was amazed at how easy it was to drink considering the ABV. I will be keeping the other two bottles in my cellar for awhile!! This is a must try for every stout lover!! Thank you Brasseris Dieu Du Ciel, everything I have tried from you is amazing!!!"
"D: Really nice overall and highly drinkable. Reminds me a bit of Founders Breakfast Stout. Sold in the proper bottle size too - 12 oz."
"Poured a deep black with a tannish head. Nose had vanilla, coffee bean, cocoa, caramel. Taste was just terrific with a lot of coffee and espresso plus vanilla and bitter chocolate. Mouthfeel was really good. Drinkability is so good that it is dangerous. Well disguised ABV and great taste. No wonder its in the BA Top 100"
"Home Run Straight 4.5's from me!"
"Edit* Upon a second tasting against Founders Breakfast Stout, I am further strengthened in my opinion on the high quality of this coffee stout. It is truly a exemplary brew."
"D. I really think I could session this 9.5% RIS with no problem. No, seriously."
"Pours a solid opaque black color with a nice, frothy creamed coffee colored head and left some generous sheets of lacing down the glass. I've been enjoying several coffee stouts as of late, and this one has one of, if not THE best coffee noses I've come across so far. The aroma is all espresso back up by some light chocolate, lots of roasty notes and some alcohol. Upon my first taste, my first words were, ""Oh My God!"" This beer is rich in complex coffee goodness. It tastes exactly like those chocolate covered espresso bean treats. Flavor weaves in and out of chocolaty goodness and strong, bitter roasted coffee. This is easily the best coffee stout I've ever tasted. It's roasty, toasty, chocolaty, coffee goodness that just doesn't stop. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, incredibly smooth despite the large amounts of coffee and the bitterness. Alcohol is very well hidden and alcohol is barely noticeable. It's just way too easy to drink for it's strength in flavor and alcohol, which is dangerous considering the ABV. This beer is just fantastic. I'm glad I picked up two bottles, as one will surely makes it's way into the cellar area of my basement. Coffee stouts, or any stout for that matter, just don't get any better than this. SEEK THIS OUT."
"Overall an exceptional beer that was just fabulous and oh so complex. Wow, I'll need some more of this. Excellent."
"This beer poured almost completely black with a generous tan head that lasted a long time. The aroma was dominated by the smell of coffee with chocolate also coming through. The taste was similar and balanced well and also had a bit of a nutty taste. Mouthfeel was proper for a stout. Drinkability was high for a beer of this abv."
"Definitely not a session beer but extremely drinkable."
"Pours an extremely dark brown with a big, finely bubbled, brown head with excellent retention; that leaves rings as you slowly sip it down. Smell is very interesting: aromas of stale coffee (which is so interesting that I don't consider it a bad thing), dark chocolate, and burnt wood. Fascinating taste: roasted coffee loud and clear (but that was expected and isn't necessarily an endorsement), dark chocolate truffles, smoke and charry bitterness - I love it. Full-bodied but perfectly carbonated. For 4 dollars for an 11.5 oz bottle I was hoping for this kind of quality and I'm relieved that it delivered. I will definitely buy this one again and show it to friends. One of the most interesting stouts I've ever had."
"Pours pretty much black with a large tan head. Moderate carbonation. Aroma is pretty big milky cocoa, malts, oaky and slightly ashy. Flavor is bitter cocoa, light hops, molasses. The mouthfeel is dry, chalky and bitter, and I love it like that. This one was well worth the wait. Now I have to hoard my three remaining bottles."
"Aroma is absolutely magnificent - like unsweetened chocolate with an undertone of rich roast coffee. It pours like motor oil and comes out opaque sable, just a shade this side of black, with a thick, fine, persistent tan head. Fabulous flavor is chocolaty but not sweet, with tones of coffee and smoke, nutty hints, and a touch of hops. Texture is tingly and lively so it practically dances down the esophagus. Strongly recommended, especially to Stouties."
"D: This is just straight up good beer out of Montreal, Canada. If you don't like it there's something wrong with you. Quite deserving of its top 100 status, a treat."
"Drinkability: Best coffee beer I have had."
"Drinkability is just average. Not exactly undrinkable but it certainly didn't make me want to drink another. This one really didn't live up to its reputation. I wish I had tried it when it was more fresh, but it has been in a fridge since I bought it. We were so disappointed that we had to make some coffee afterwards to make up for the disappointment. I have another bottle in my cellar and I am regretting shelling out the money for it. The Derniere and Route de Espice were much better. Maybe I can trade my second bottle to somebody that would enjoy it more."
"Dark black pour with a foamy, frothy top. Great lacing and retention. Stays around like tan sea foam. Thick grains in the nose. Roasted and sugary. Goes down thick and oily with a clear flavor of roasted coffee. Has a lingering coarseness and a noticeable bite of alcohol. It can't get much better than this."
"couldn't finish it."
"M/D - Medium body with good carbonation. Drinkable, but two would be enough."
"D: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easily, slightly filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is definitely one of the better coffee-flavored beer that I've had. It's certainly one that is worth sticking with for a long time."
" D - The drinkability is top notch - I like the dry approach w/ the beans adding more bitterness and there is less sweetened coffee taste - more or less good if you like your coffee w/out the sugar this will suit you. Peche Mortel has more spice and java than most + yet still a great Imperial stout underneath it all."
"d - good beer but this is one that i should have aged longer than the ~4 months i did."
"boarderline thick almost viscous put the mouthfeel in a category that i would call a RIS. possibly due to lower attenuation, but i really don't mind, this beer is neither cloying or too sweet, it is however a complete experience."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable for such a big stout. This one is a sipper for me. I'm pretty impressed with this beer."
"Excellent combination, very nicely balanced."
"A pleasure to consume."
"D- outstanding i wish this came in a bigger bottle and was easier to get. onwe of my favorites to date."
"Drinkability: Savor the bottle!"
"Pours a dark thick black with a dark brown creamy head. Aroma has a lot of coffee with slight tones of alcohol. Taste is rich with coffee with a pleasant aftertaste. Well balanced and smooth, slight hints of alcohol and bitterness. Good heavy texture. This beer is on the heavy side and although I would only want to have a couple at a time it is a very enjoyable beer."
"By far the best coffee stout I've had, and one of the best beers I've had overall. Here is a beer that lives up to its hype. Exceptional."
"Notes: A great, big badass stout with obvious coffee smells, tastes."
"This one pours out black with a giant, sticky brown head. The head falls back slowly, and is gone by the time you finish. You get decent lacing, as much as is expected from bottle-conditioned beers. The smell is coffee, but its not quite as coffee rich as some other similarly styled beers. You get a note of the roasted flavor, like the soy sauce flavor that accompanies the darkest of malts. The taste is really great. The backbone for many coffee beers is usually a bit sweeter, but this one is dark and roasty. Very interesting. You get the bitterness shining through, but there's also a very silky feeling to it. I'm a bit afraid that without the coffee you would get all soy sauce without the saltiness. But it's a flavor that I enjoy (though I doubt most other people would actually like it). You get quite a complex burst of flavors, that make you want to sit around and think about it. There's coffee and bittersweet malts, and the roasted flavors, all with a kick of silkiness, and you always want the next drink. I don't think this is as good as some other coffee stouts, but it's still good. I can't say I would buy cases of this and continue drinking it (which is quite normal for in my case most of the stronger stouts), but the likelihood of me finding it over and over again is rare enough that I would probably buy it if I see it again."
"Thanks to both Viggo and bobsy, I'm glad I have more than one of this!"
"This is going down pretty easy considering just how big this beer is. A great treat on this bitter, windy winter night. I could knock a few of these back quite easily in one sitting, although the alcohol would catch up to me sooner rather than later. It does reveal itself with a palate and belly warming quality that is just what this bag of bones needs on this frigid winter solstice. Highly recommended for fans of coffee stouts. Im glad i have a few more bottles of this one to enjoy later when the mood strikes. It wont be too long."
"If you like coffee, no make that GOOD coffee, this is a beer for you."
"Awesome. Really a great beer. I expected good, but not to take the front spot on my list of favorite stouts. Thanks again to trading, one of the most enjoyable things I have gotten into."
"This is a fine coffee stout. However, I find it somewhat one-note with regard to the flavors. Fantastic appearance, aroma, texture and alcohol balance, but the flavors are slightly short of my expectations. Strong roasted malt and coffee flavors, but it mostly stops there."
"7/4/9/4/16 (4.0/5)"
"Great example of the style. Few coffee stouts pull off this dark roast profile so well."
"Absolutely delicious and deserving of the accolades."
"A beautiful brew!"
"A deep, chocolate/java layer cake. Decadent thick cocoa milk shake balanced by a dark coffee roast. A spectrum from sweet mocha through cappacino with a bite. Malt provide a toasty dry ride with hops just to level the playing field. The real treat comes from the espresso chocolate chip brownie. Awesome."
"This is a style I'll be staying away from in the future."
"One of the (if not the) greatest beer I've ever had the privilege to drink."
"Black pour, not even much light getting through arount the edges. Small dark brown head. Very nice roast coffee and roast malt aromas. Med/full bodied with a descent amount of small carbonation, not quite creamy. Coffee, coffee and some mocha or bakers chocolate, coffee bitters in the finish. A little bitey, but mellows nicely as it warms. No messin around, very good straigh forward, yet slightly different than the norm Imperial. More of a good java stout than a straight Imperial. Not quite a good as the Bell's or Southern Tier I've had. Still worth finding however."
"D - Extremely enjoyable and easy to drink. Probably one of my favorite coffee stouts I have had thus far."
"Future outlook: I'm sure we'll meet again in a snifter someday down the road"
"That being said, I just realized it's getting late and that this beer probably has a lot of caffeine so I don't think I'll be finishing it. Damn...why did I open a coffee stout so late."
"Great beer. Beautiful black with a creamy chocolaty head. The aroma and taste are full of sweet coffee - really nice blend with the other ingredients. Alcohol is hidden perfectly. This was more carbonated than most really good stouts I've had, but it was still really full-bodied. Straight 5s for me - one of the few best stouts I've ever had."
"This is a great one, but my expectations were high - and not quite met."
"D - Nice sipper here on a warm night, for coffee lovers."
"Pours a deep dark brown with brass highlights, a tan head and delicate lace. The smell is like chocolate and fresh ground coffee beans.what a great taste. Different than any stout I've had. A very complex rush of flavours washes over the palette. I'm not too good at describing these things but it's all roasted malt and dark chocolate with a soft bitter slightly burnt after taste. The alcohol definitely is there but doesn't overpower. A perfect beer for coming in out of the snow and sitting in front of the fireplace. Mmmmm."
"Mouthfeel is insanely creamy and chewy. Perfect match to the flavors. A nearly 10% ABV beer should not drink this easy. Incredibly smooth."
"D: Highly drinkable, one of the better examples of the style that I have seen."
"Drinkability: A big, bold, impressive beer that is meant to be sipped and savored. Well blended, with great body and a nice balancing carbonation. I look forward to slowly pulling these out of the cellar."
"Easy drinking. Very complex and equilibrated beer. What I habitually look in a good imperial stout. Cheers"
"Mouthfeel was a bit numbing. Zing on the tongue from carbonation. Alcohol was well hidden."
"Thanks to Greggy for this one. This beer pours a thick motor oil black color. The head is large, dark tan, and never really recedes. The aroma is of graham cracker, dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, nuts, and hints of cherry. The taste is full of dark chocolate, coffee, graham cracker, and nuts. The finish is a nice lingering roasted malt bitterness. It is a lot like the aroma, but not quite as nuanced. The mouthfeel is wonderfully chewy with a silky texture, and low carbonation. Overall, this is one beautiful beer. I really appreciate how balanced this is for an Imperial Stout. I like how all of the gorgeous malt flavors are allowed to express themselves without tons of hops getting in the way. I would love to have this available in my area."
"Pours a sludgy deep dark black with thin coffee colored head. Aroma is dominated by strong roasted coffee. Chocolate, toffee, roasted malt and alcohol also present. Very strong roasted coffee flavor with hints of chocolate, toffee, burnt bread and a nice alcohol warmth in the finish."
"D- Nice and easy drinking delicious Impy. The ABV is well hidden making it quite drinkable. Will plan on having again. Big thanks to JoeyBeerBelly for the tade."
"Drinakbility: I'm not a big coffee guy, but this brew can convert me. Not at all overpowering- adds to the drinakbility. A sipper nonetheless due to its complexity and ABV."
"Is this the best imperial stout I've ever tasted? No. But it's definitely the best one in Canada. Not much to complain about, although it does seem a little too sweet at times, and I think I could handle a bigger roasted flavour. This is minor quibbling though, it really is a fine beer."
"D- Its a sipper but good."
"3/4/5/4/4"
"this beer pours a really beautiful black with a thick rocky head that fades slowly to a variegated spotty lacing that clings to the side of the glass. the aroma presents a wallop of coffee and roasted earthiness that is even more evident on the tongue. sweet at the beginning and bitter at the end. kind of like the sour patch but the other way around. the mouthfeel seems a bit on the under carbonated side, but otherwise nice, full and warming. thanks for the great beer wes."
"Poured from the bottle into a Goose Island Tasting Glass. This beauty is black and beautiful!! Coffee aroma hits your nose upon pouring. Has a small brown head that dissappears quickly. Burnt coffee and malt dominate this beer. Leaves behind mininal lacing. Mouthfeel is appealing and full. Where is the alcohol in here, very well hidden. I have been holding on to this one for about a year now and have another cellaring. This is a top flight Imperial Coffee Stout for sure. Can't wait to taste it with more aging. Highly recommended for coffee junkies!!"
"I find this comparable to Founder's Breakfast Stout in terms of a stout you actually could enjoy for breakfast. Otherwise it reminds a Southern Tier's Jah-va in terms of flavor. In the end, Peche Mortel is its own intriguing beer. As for the 9.5% alcohol, I have no idea where it's at, which increases drinkability to a dangerous degree. But this stuff is pretty pricey, so it probably won't be replacing the morning cup of joe anytime soon. If I could find this in our area, I'd buy on sight again with no hesitation."
"Drinkability is amazing and certainly one to savor."
"Without a doubt the best coffee stout I have ever had. Well worth the hype. In the words of Homer Simpson ""You would step over your on Mother just to get one."""
"A delicious brew, well deserving of its high rating, and one I will enjoy as often as I can. Edited to change appearance rating, as subsequent pours had significantly better head production/retention."
"Excellently drinkable. I can't argue with so many before who have rated this brew so highly. It truly is worthy of it's praise."
"Pours an elegant black with off brown head. Enticing scent of roasted coffee, black licorice, a bit medicinal but sweet overpowers. A wonderful taste awaits full of dark roasted coffee flavors, earthy notes, and chewy dark chocolate covered hops to finish the drink. The alcohol is hidden extremely well behind the full bodied taste and density. One of the best stouts I've had, definitely worth experiencing."
"Peche Mortel pours a dense pitch black with a multi minute lasting thick foamy tan head. Carbonation bubbles are very compact. Smell is strong of roasted coffee beans, malt, chocolate, with a touch of tartness. First taste bolts out huge expresso flavors with a slight coffee ground bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel has an oil like film on a dense, viscous dark liquid. There is a medium and somewhat sharp carbonation. Sticky bitter coffee chocolate like resin lingers on the gums. This is extemely sticky and dense. Overall this is an exceptional brew at the top of its class. Tons of coffee expresso flavor with a fantastic finish."
"Overall: An amazing beer. A perfect example of a coffee stout...a must try."
"Pours black with a lumpy brown head of frothy goodness. Sweet roasted coffee aroma with some fruitiness and bittersweet chocolate. Loads of coffee and chocolate in the flavor. Big roasted malts, semisweet chocolate morsels, subtle fruits...deliciously smooth and creamy in the mouth. Certainly one of the most flavorful coffee stouts I've ever had. Mmmm. Full but not too full bodied finishing with a slight dryness. Alcohol is never an issue. Oh yeeeaaaah..."
"honest good stout but maybe not as good as the hype. founder's breakfest stout waaayyy better. should be higher on best of ba."
"Top quality. May have to make a trip across the border when I head up to Vermont for my ski trip. Reminded me a lot of the FBS, but a little better."
"Note: All three wisemen rated this beer. It was so delicious and had such a unique and amazing mouthfeel that we opened the only other bottle - we had to get at some more."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, but the high alcohol level and the intense coffee flavor helps us to escape this mortal sin."
"Peche Mortel...Mortal Sin...FTW. This is a flat out excellent beer. Perhaps my view of it is a little skewed by my love for coffee. I believe it'd be difficult for someone who's not into coffee to get into this beer. Coffee is just so central to the flavor that you almost have to like it to like this beer. But, I'd recommend this to anyone. It's truly an epic beer."
"opaque black with small latte head. sweet and liquor blend. feels great. milky, sweet, toffee malt, light coffee, light chocolate milk. bourbon vanilla even, a touch of smoke. carried very nicely by the density. its all there. a meal and dessert at the same time. fantastic. one of the best of the year..."
"Pours black with a one-finger tan head. Retention is decent, and it eventually dissipates to leave a foam film with nice lacing. Smells of roasted coffee which dominates the slight chocolate malt and a syrup/molasses presence. Dark, sweet fruit esters in the background. The taste is more coffee, but this time the roasted notes are more evident. Chocolate earthiness comes through, making it slightly bitter. The feel is thick and verging on oily. Overall, a really impressive beer that I quite enjoyed in spite of the fact that I'm not a coffee drinker."
"A nice velvety creaminess leads to a strong sharp roastyness with some dark sweet fruitiness in the mix. Strong burnt tastes almost metallic like very woody with a dry nuttiness with a dusty chocolate coating and intense expresso and fresly roasted coffee throughout finishes with a mouthfill of dark freshly ground coffee beans. Quite drinkable just too flavorful to be followed by another.One to sip, suprizing how well hidden the alcohol was. 500 is now in the books!"
"Pours out a thick is tar and as dark as night. Not a hint of light coming through the edges of the glass, but a billowing head of surprisingly light ochre puffs right up, leaving substantial webs of lace as it slowly subsides. Bright fruitiness, grape and cherry, is immediately apparent in the nose. The coffee is irrepressible though, and there are darker notes of treacle and currant as well. Taste is assertive and deep. The coffee is more obvious, and there's a mild note of dark chocolate that I hadn't yet picked up. The fruitiness is subdued, but still present, the cherry notes getting a bit lost. Mouthfeel is only a shade flat, the body making up for it. Drinkability is very, very good for such a big stout. Revelatory and truly imperial, this is a beer that is worth its reputation."
"The body is moderately full to full. Some creaminess texture and noticeable astringency in the malt. Overall even for a coffee beer this is really out of balance and way to yeast for a stout. IMHO this beer is over rated."
"Pours a ridiculously solid obsidian color with a superb, thick, fluffy yet dense, tan head. Pretty thick pour, very viscous. Immediately roast coffee hits my nose. This is unlike any other beer I have had. There is no joking around with the coffee aspect if this beer. It smells like the spent grains from an espresso shot...wonderful. The taste follows the smell but also brings in more complexity. You get a lot of burnt and roasted coffee, along with ample amounts of dark chocolate and burnt sugar. The bitterness and balance of this beer are incredible. This is addictingly good."
"A welcome beer in my cellar. Cheers to this achievement!"
"A: Moves like a warm maple syrup, thick, cottony head, obsidian black, a marvel to look at - 5.00, S: Heavy on the espresso, some slight tar (not in a bad way), baker's chocolate, as a coffee enthusiast you would expect me to enjoy the aroma and this one does not fail to impress - 5.00, T: Finally the hops I was looking for on the nose become apparent on the palate - quite bitter, quite boozy, an element of sweet dark molasses, as it warms the chocolate strengthens, geez is this a flavorful beer - 5.00, M: Some creaminess, medium bodied - 4.50, D: My first beer from Dieu du Ciel and it is an exceptional beer, I'm averse to giving out perfect scores but this one edges as close as you can get. A great beer for sipping late night - 4.50"
"This is one tasty brew for sure but do not know haw many I could put down."
"Excellent."
"Drinkability is great a very good a huge stout full of flavor so damn good. Only down side is its a little pricey but next time I see any I will be buying several to hold on to for those special occasions that demand a great stout. Highly recommended."
"Deep black in color with a very nice cocoa colored head. Moderate amount of roasted aroma-mild coffee smell to it. Incredible deep roasted flavor. Very grainy with a deep, deep chocolate flavor. Running under that is a great coffee flavor that is well balanced and not over done. Great mouthfeel-the heavy roasted/coffee flavor is just perfect going down mouthfeel wise. Incredibly enjoyable. I could this one all night. Boy I need to get some more."
"Cola brown pour, with a big 3 fingers of semi fizzy froth. First whiff brought strong aromas of coffee. As she warmed a little, the phenol became apparent. Roasty chocolate malt and somehow it seems this has a nice hoppiness to it. Hint of vanilla, some nice marshmellow gooey sweetness. A touch oily but what a beautiful blend of coffee and hop oil. Well done"
"This beer pours a very dark brown with a dark tan head and lots of lacing. The smell is of roasted coffee beans. The majority of the flavor is of bitter coffee, strong and in your face. The mouthfeel suffers a little dry a dry aftertaste, probably from the high abv, which you can not taste @ all, very well hidden with the massive coffee flavors. For a 9.5% abv this is a very drinkable brew!"
"Coffee stouts aren't my cup of tea however this is good. Was not the biggest fan of the beer however it does deserve the marks. Just not a fan of the style really."
"Overall, very solid. It makes me think that there really should be a category for coffee stouts. There certainly are many good ones available."
"Very nice mouthfeel - smooth and slick. Would be sessionable if not for the ABV."
"Why we cant get this more easily in the states is a crime"
"Overall: love/hate"
"D - a very good tasting stout, but it's one to be sipped to be fully enjoyed."
"11.2 oz. bottle served in a snifter. Bottle conditioned. Poured a deep brown/black with a finger of tan head. Huge coffee aroma, a bit acrid and slightly metallic. Very bitter coffee flavor. Full bodied, but not syrupy. Warming alcohol. I found the coffee flavor to be a little harsh. Very dry finish with chocolate and more coffee. I was a little disappointed with this."
"D - This beer was worthy of the hype. I am not a coffee drinker, but this was outstanding. If coffee tasted this good I might take up the habit."
"Very good flavor with this one but the aroma seemed underwhelming. I always see people saying that this one used to be better. I wish I could have tried it back then because this stuff is pretty damn good now."
"Taste is roasted malt with coffee. Basically this is the concept of the beer. This beer deserves a 5 for execution. The roasted malts add a nice maltbiterness and some chocolate notes. There is little carbonation, which is good too. Mouthfeel is superb, smooth and creamy. I wonder how they do that. The coffee never gets sharp or astringent and unlike my own coffee beers, it's aftertaste is smooth. Bitterness is medium and hops are a bit American, not sure if it is, but they appear a bit citric."
"This is the only Dieu du Ciel brew I've had, but very impressed."
"Mouthfeel was a little thin, in my opinion. Bubbly and slighty thin but a very nice overall. Glad I was finally able to purchase a fresh bottle of this. A bit expensive for drinking often a very nice celebratory or ""special evening"" type beer"
"I remember when this beer began to buzz around the beer circuit a few years back. I saw it on the shelves a few years back and I was surprised to see it priced at $19.99 for a small bottle. Well, here it is, years later, and greater distribution provided me with a more reasonably priced bottle. I poured this into my Delirium snifter and the midnight black body formed a mocha colored head of medium sized carbonation. The body is totally opaque and the head provides wonderful lacing. Heavy carbonation lines the rim of the glass. The aroma is wonderfully expressive with massive espresso and cocoa bean notes. The sweetness is fresh ground coffee fills the nostrils and provides a wonderful entry point to the taste. There a remnants of malted milk balls that add anticipation. I am not sure if it is the odd or perfect. Just one of those aromas that seem familiar, yet so unique. The taste is filled with coffee and roasted malts. A big dose of bittering hops adds a wonderful balance of bitterness to the heavy malt body. The high abv is hardly noticeable although it adds a slight warmth to the mouthfeel. The body is rich yet thinned out and dried by the high carbonation. As this beer warms up, the delicate flavors open up a bit more and the sweetness comes out. This is a wonderful beer that is worth the hype. Not your everyday beer, but definitely one that should take up some space in your cellar."
"D- this is a drinkable beer, could drink more than 2 in a sitting."
"D- Totally awesome brew to drink. Highly recommended. Going to find some more of these for sure."
"Drinkability is great, but this should be enjoyed at a reasonable pace."
"D-Scary good. If i found a place with this on tap, it would be a scary night."
"M/D - Very full-bodied and smooth, almost creamy. Easy drinking despite the high ABV. The only thing holding this back is the dominating coffee taste with little to balance it out."
"Begs to be related to Expedition Stout. This is better i think. And I'm sad to say it. (Keep in mind, I have an irrational aversion to mass, weight and alcohol unnecessarily present ...)"
"a stand up beer."
"This is a really drinkable double or imperial stout. No booziness or alcohol warming, not too heavy."
"This is stout heaven...probably the best Imperial Stout I had the pleasure of tasting. Nice dark pour, smooth and rich mouthfeel, and drinkable anywhere, anytime. I bet this gem is a beast from the tap!!! Looking for a trip to Montreal just to have the pleasure of trying this gem from the tap."
"Pours totally opaque with a skim of caramel-colored foam. Aroma is like the best mocha/espresso ever. Coffee beans, dark chocolate, tons of cocoa nibs, and some roasty/smoky malt. Flavor is more dry coffee, espresso, and cocoa. Higher carbonation and lower viscosity than other big stouts results in a beer that's more drinkable and more like some sort of coffee/beer hybrid than just a beer with coffee added. More intense coffee flavor and aroma than any other coffee beer I've tried."
"Drinks really easy for the style & ABV, a great breakfast beer! Not into many coffe beers, but this one is exquisite. Only founder's surpasses this IMO"
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter. Poured thick black with light carbonation and chocolate lacing. Smell was light with hints of coffee and roasted beans. the taste is what caught me, it was quite light and sweet with a very subtle yet noticable coffee flavor. It was pretty much dead on perfect. It was an amazing stout with just enough coffee to really set it apart. carbonation was light. I plan on picking up a few more of these."
"Bottle from Capone's in Norristown, PA. At $7, this is the cheapest I have ever seen or heard of this beer being sold. So that's a good start. Pours extremely dark brown, almost black, with a short tawny head. Very little light makes its way through this beer. Smells strongly of raw dark chocolate, carob beans, espresso, rum. Taste is a big roasted cocoa bean punch, burnt and black and bitter, mixed in with a strong deep-roasted coffee bean smack, aggressive and grainy. Definite alcohol presence on the finish, along with a restrained dark fruit flavor. Nice mix of flavors, very well done. Maybe a step away from being full bodied. Overall very interesting and not just a one-note coffee stout."
"Drinkability is fair. It is a bit of a strong coffee taste for me -- and that's saying a lot. I'm a one pot with fresh ground beans in the am kind of guy."
"I would looove another."
"D: I want to like this beer, I really do, but the bitterness is just too much. I'm a big fan of stouts, but I'm also a big fan of balance. It's kind of a struggle for me to get through this, but its redeeming qualities make the drinking experience enjoyable if not entirely easy."
"Awesome beer for a coffee lover."
" Body is big, rich, and smooth, with a good creamy mouthfeel. While a slow sipper, this is a very drinkable high-gravity stout. Super tasty and rich, one of the best stouts I've ever had."
"It's almost cheaper to trade for a sixer or two of this stuff from Canadia than to buy singles in the US...hell , I think it is for sure! Regardless, I'll probably find myself splurging on a single every now and then...damn, maybe not. Founders is coming!"
"If this isn't on your top 5 of all time favorite stouts (or even #1), you seriously need to reconsider you selections! Top notch in every way!"
"The perfect imperial stout and possibly even the perfect beer. A deep, menacing pour with a khaki colored head. Nose of espresso and secondary hints of cafe mocha made with dark chocolate - like sitting next to coffee being roasted. Flavor is what you would expect, given the aroma. Great mouthfeel. Perfectly balanced with intermingled sweetness and bitterness that slide gracefully between each other during different parts of the sip."
"Damn, this is an incredible beer. Between this and Founders Breakfast Stout it's pretty much a tossup, but the Founders is easier to get and more widely available, so I'm not quite sure this can knock it from its perch of best coffee stout in my book. But it's damn close. Incredible beer I will certainly seek out again."
"D-This is a great beer and I am happy I was able to find it and have the opportunity to try it. This beer definitely gets better as it warms so give it a chance to after you pour it. I really like this stout and will have it again."
"D- very easy to finish and a rather unique tasting beer. very glad i got the chance to try this one. it lives up to the hype."
"There are beers out there that taste like coffee, and others that taste like chocolate. This beer tastes like your eating espresso beans. Not drinking espresso mind you, I mean actually eating raw(well toasted dark, not green), but eating raw espresso beans. Very interesting. Could go amazingly well wtih vanilla ice-cream. Although.... chocolate or a coffee desert might pair really well, I'd just be afraid it's complete and total overload. A great beer, but it's such a one trick pony, I'd really find it hard to drink more than one in a sitting."
"Pours an absolutely beautiful pitch black color with a deep tan foamy head. Aroma has lots of roasted coffee aroma, with a faint alcohol note. Wow, smells more like coffee than beer. Taste has a slight initially boozy flavor, but that quickly fades to a heavy black coffee taste. Amazing. The darkest roast coffee you can imagine. Mouthfeel seems a bit thin for all the flavor that is crammed into this one. Hmm. Also seems a bit fizzy. If you like coffee stouts, then this can preety much hold it's own against the best. Well done."
"Notes: I've had better coffee stouts... Not to say this one's bad, but for the price, I'll take Breakfast Stout for $12 a 4-pack as opposed to the $5 a bottle for this."
"strong coffiee, black and rich and hops with a burnt malt as the finish, this is like beer meets campfire coffiee (smud coffiee as i call it), this is like coffiee on the warmer all day, this is great i could drink this with steak and eggs. this beer makes me wonder why thay havent invented a hop flavored coffiee creamer, hell maby i have stumbled on to somthing. back to the beer at hand, this is the second best coffiee stout i have ever had, the first is wake and bake from terripin. if you can get one of theese take the oppertuinity, i wish i had goten more!!"
"Mouthfeel is rich & full, with that thin coffee veneer overtop. Didn't live up to the hype for me, but a good beer, & I'm glad I got to try Peche Mortel"
"WOW brew for me. Dark rich with some coco and coffee nibs. Cleaned up with nice acidity and no noticable alcohol. I could see this brew aging quite well for a couple of years. Would seek this out again though I haven't seen it on the West Coast yet."
"Very tasty beer. Definitely one I'd track down again."
"Tastes of dark bitter chocolate, some hop bitterness (but the bitterness mostly comes from the malts) and obviously loads of coffee. This is easily one of the best beers I have ever had."
"D, notes: This is a serious sipping beer meant to be savored slowly. Very smooth. The coffee character enhances all aspects of the beer and through the flavor. Smooth flavor shifts. bitterness is not acrid or harsh. I think this is a beer that lives up to its substantial hype."
"D- Like my coffee, I like to savor this one and enjoy it to the bottom of the glass."
"D: Split the bottle which is fine. This is a great dessert/ eye opener beer. Not quite up to the Big Boss coffee stout but damn fine. Just want to shout out two traders who sent me this within a week as extras. RustyDiamond andswnicholson. Though the bottle I am drinking I got on my own as this is finally (sort of) available in NY. Cheers."
"Like the smell, this is a milked coffee beer. Great body; simply superior in every way in that it provides a blend that, at a slower pace, is exquisite."
"Poured an 11.5oz bottle into my New Belgium globe glass. This beer pours a jet black with a big 2 inch tan head that leaves just a little lacing on the glass. This beer is really dark. It reminds me of what coffee looks like after you've left the pot on the burner for 24 hours. The aroma is straightforward espresso, with just a hint of cream. The taste is spectacular. It reminds me of Starbucks Espresso Ice Cream. Huge coffee taste with cream, chocolate and just a hint of vanilla with a slight alcohol burn at the tail. This is a great tasting brew. The mouthfeel is full and creamy, leaving a nice coating in your mouth. This beer is so drinkable, I think I'll start popping one every morning instead of the pot of coffee I normally drink. This would go perfect with any breakfast."
"i finally get this off my wishlist (originally put on 9/18/2006) ... from LS .. lots of chocolate, tobacco, and coffee aroma's ... great brad pitt lacing ... it really coats the mouth so wonderfully .. very nice aftertaste ... is roasty and has an espresso/ chocolate battle going on ... not overdone, but very bold .. a great brew!"
"D: Just and amazing beer, not a five in taste as I feel there is just a pinch of room for improvement but it is something to behold and to drink, incredibly tasty and only Founders Kentucky Breakfast surpasses it for sheer coffee goodness. Just a joy to drink."
"Thanks to Deuane for the sample."
"Pours to a thin, creamy tan head and virtually opaque ruby-black color. Aroma is of freshly ground dark-roasted coffee, roasted barly and caramel malts. There is also vanilla and yeast esters peeking through in the smell. Flavor is coffee and chocolate malt dominant with some hop and roast bitterness balancing the sweetness of the generous portions of malt in this recipe. the flavors work well together and are very strong. Mouthfeel is full-bodied. aModerately low CO2 enhances the coffee experience. Finishes with a strong espresso aftertaste. This is s beer for coffee-lovers and one of the finest beers to have with dessert, or as a dessert itself."
"Drinkability- This is a great and drinkable beer, and worth the hype here on BA. If I had many more, I would drink many more. It's almost a perfect excuse to go to Quebec."
"Overall- A great brew that is well suited as an after dinner beer. I don't like coffee but I couldn't let that cloud my judgement of this beer. Overall this beer was fantastic but something I wouldn't drink again because of my personal dislike of coffee."
"A real winner of an Imperial Stout!"
"I'll be revisiting this often (when I can get it) Sinfully good....& highly recommended."
"D - I have had this before and at time it seems very smoky and at others it is a nice complex RIS."
"Poured into a goblet. Color is deep dark chocolat brown with a slight head. A rich roasted aroma in the nose. This beer is creamy in the mouth, full bodied, with a bitterness of coffee subtely lurking behind a creamy mouthfeel of cocoa and roasted barley. This beer has a long finish and bitterness is well controlled, not overpowering. This stout is a mouthful and very approachable."
"Pours black with a crème head. Malty coffee nose. Just an insane flavor. A mass of thick coffee with a firm malty backbone. Intense, but not overdone at all. Just a great flavor ride. Feel is smooth on liquid. Even better than I remember it being on-tap."
"D: I finally got this, and such a well worth it wait. absolutely amazing. well worth a try."
"M,D. The mouthfeel is quite thick, which leaves the drinkability low, but quite a fantastic beer, one of the best RIS!"
"Overall a superior coffee stout."
"340 reviews as of this writing. I picked up a few of these as they have started showing up in MA more and more as of late. So, I'm a fan of starbucks coffee. This beer is like going to starbucks and drinking thick black coffee with a side of alchohol. In the words of a friend, wow, that's what's for breakfast these days. If you like the idea of a strong dark roast coffee layered over a dark beer go for it. If any of the above doesn't work for you, try another stout."
"d - I could drink a lot, but I'm not really diggin it all that much."
"Right on stylistically no doubt... unfortunately the style isn't my favourite. Even so, I wouldn't turn this one down."
"Poured pitch black with the thickest, heaviest head I've ever had the privelidge of seeing atop a beer. The head stayed perfectly intact for what seemed an eternity, even as I swirled the beer around and took a few sips. Rich coffee aroma with some deep malt and tastes much the same. Mouthfeel was very smooth with some alcohol at the end. Very easy to drink, which was pretty dangerous due the high alcohol content and me coming off a five hour drive. A few hours of drinking these at the bar hit me pretty hard come last call, but it was all well worth it."
"Pours jet black, with a dark tan head. In the aroma, big roasty malt and big coffee. In the taste, just like the smell, big roasty malt and coffee, yet coffee being quite smooth. A light bitterness and bg mouthfeel, with a semi dry roasty coffee aftertaste. Nice big beer, big flavor and a nice smoothness."
"D - Drinkability is good. It goes down easy enough for a beer this ""big"". Limit for me would be one bottle at a time given the abv. The alcohol could stand to be hidden a little more - which would shoot drinkability through the roof. Still, This is a very tasty brew that I will have again and again. Highly recommended."
"D: I could drink many of these right now, but I feel that may be a mistake. This beer is damned near perfect. If this beer was a woman, I would ask her out. She would absolutely turn me down, but I would buy her a car for her time. Ridiculous."
"Drinkability: Turns out I didn't need my coffee this morning! The best coffee-infused beer I've ever had. Absolutely delicious, and it really covers the full range of potential coffee notes you can get from a beer, from dark to light, sweet to bitter, refreshing to warming. A really excellently crafted beer."
"Drinkability - There is no doubt that this beer achieves it goal as the mother of all coffee stouts. Yeah it can be overwhelming at times, but thats exactly what this beer is about. Could I have one every night? No, but when the mood strikes for a coffee infused beer there are no substitutes."
"D-An excellent beer that lived up to the hype. It's very complex and a great beer that you can't get enough of."
"D-Would drink this one all night all. Great at all temps, cold to almost room temp."
"My impression is that its just a tad too bitter for its own good. I like it a ton, but it just isn't quite right for me. But, for all the effort it took to finally haul in this one, it was worth it. A fine, fine beer."
"Picked up a couple of bottles in Maine when I was there, JUST before they became available in Georgia. Oh well. Poured black with a healthy dark tan head that settled to a cap. Some lacing as well. Nice aroma of ground coffee in the nose, as well as a touch of dark fruit. Taste is similar- lots of ground coffee, some dark fruit, and a tiny bit of molasses sweetness. Overall, though, this is more bitter than sweet, and much more like black coffee than some with cream. That is unfortunate, because I really like the coffee stouts with a touch of creaminess to round out the coffee bitterness and acidity, and because the quality of the coffee used in coffee stouts, while often good is not always absolutely top notch. I'll drink my coffee black if it is something like Batdorf and Bronson Sumatra Tarwar, but if it is something less robust and more acidic, I like a little cream. Perhaps it is that the freshness of the aromatics in coffee are even more fleeting than those in hops, and that almost no one gets it just right and captures the balance and complexity of a really great cup of coffee in a stout. Those that do tend to have a creamy finish and more noticeable malt than this one has, or to have a winey complexity that goes beyond just ""dark fruit"". This is good, but for me it is not the alpha and omega of coffee stouts. Mouthfeel is substantial, but overall this brew is a bit too one dimensional- though it does have power. It also nicely disguises the alcohol."
"Black with brown edges and a creamy, foamy light brown head. Aromas of coffee, vanilla, roasted malt and burnt sugar. Really good flavors of the same too. I turned my back on my beer for two minutes (to go get some French Vanilla ice cream for this beer) and the only roach that lives in my apartment had already started climbing the glass. He only comes out when I leave the good stuff unattended. Full bodied with a roasted malt, bitter chocolate and coffee finish. This cockroach is fearlessly hanging around on the table waiting for me to turn my back again, but I don't think so - not this time."
"D : Not a bad stout but I would have preferred the coffee to have been toned down some."
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter. Pours a jet black with a fluffy tan head. Coffee, coffee and more coffee on the nose. Some burnt sugar smell as well. Taste is the same. Magnificent flavor. I love coffee anything, and I have said it before, but this one is my new fave for extreme coffee flavor. It may have to do with the extremely full and creamy mouthfeel to go with it. Amazing beer."
"The tastes and mouthfeel come together for a really pleasurable experience here. However I wasn't as blown away as I thought I would be considering how highly this beer is rated. On par with some other excellent stouts I've had, actually reminded me of Bell's Java Stout, which I also enjoyed immensely."
"A fine example of a coffee stout. From Montreal huh? Look forward to trying more from this brewery. Seek this on eout. Stands up to all from the style IMO."
"D: They don't get much better than this. A must have if you are a stout lover."
"D-- for the coffee enthusiast you have a beer that nails it. For a curious individual like myself, I have tried the ""mortal sin"" and have a new appreciation for it"
"Overall: This is a hell of a coffee beer, it reeks of coffee and coffee flavor just runs throughout it. As one of the best in the world.... well it is if you like coffee, I do so I found it very enjoyable."
"D - Beautiful beer."
"Excellent coffee stout. The only downsides are the feel (when cold) and the high price (~$5). If you like coffee or stouts at all, definitely try this - it's amazing."
"Unfortunately got scammed into paying $18 for the 12oz. bottle so that's the last time I'm drinking a bottle of beer at a bar. Anywhere."
"This beer pours dark black with a small head that disappeared quickly. The smell and taste is overwhelming complex and it is difficult to pick out the various coffee flavors. The mouthfeel is creamy and nicely carbonated. The after taste is bitter. The drinkability is high on this one considering the high abv. I could easily see drinking two or three of these if this was readily available to me. By far my favorite coffee stout."
"D- Surprisingly drinkable, although you need to sip at it"
"Pours opaque jet black, with the merest hint of the suggestion of red highlights at the edges. Tan, almost reddish head that disappears into a lingering film. Aroma: notes of coffee, rum, port, roast malt, with hazelnut and dark chocolate as it warms. Flavour: strong coffee flavour, complemented by a nicely balanced sweetness. Plenty of dark roasty bite, but not unpleasantly astringent. Finishes with plenty of dark chocolate nuttiness. Port. For a beer this strong, it hides its alcohol well. Until it warms up, I would never have put this beer at 9.5. Not at all harsh, even when the alcohol starts to come out. Chocolate milkshake mouthfeel. Just enough carbonation to enliven it. Wonderful."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and the carbonation consists of many fine bubbles. Really enhances the coffee bitterness. Drinkability is tough to rate for such a big and bold beer, but given the relative price and expectations the drinkability is only a shade above average. I can't complain overall, but I expected more. Worth a try for its unique qualities."
"Ok, well it's almost an hour later and it has mellowed quite nicely. The flavors go together smoothly and don't bash your tongue. All except for that bitter/astringent flavor that still dominates and leaves an ashy aftertaste. Even without considering the price I think this will be my last Peche Mortel."
"Bitter coffee is what this is all about as well. There is some warming alcohol to it as well especially on the finish, and a hint of sweetness underneath it all which does just enough to prevent the coffee from being too pervasive. It's definitely a good coffee stout, but it doesn't overly impress me. It has a very creamy mouthfeel with excellent carbonation. For coffee fans, this is excellent."
"D: Dangerously quaffable for 9.5%. Coffee is just a bit more pronounced than I would prefer, but still a great sipper."
" This one has a very authentic coffee flavor that plays with the chocolate currents very well.I don't think you'll find this one hard to drink."
"This is a Stout I would recommend to anyone who likes their Stouts as bitter as an Ex-wife"
"I blame Canada for this one. And thats a good thing."
"I wanted a change of pace after months of drinking lighter lagers and IPAs. This was a nice welcome interruption."
"Mouthfeel is thick and creamy."
"This beer is really a treat. Can drink it all day, despite the dense body and strong coffee dominance. A real stand-out."
"This delivers the goods, and while not cheap at slightly more than $4 a bottle (11.5 oz), it's not the bankbreaker it once was when bombers pushed upwards of $15. In fact, it's close to a steal at this price, as it rivals the best in its class."
"Black with a big tan head. Lack of lacing was a little bit of a let down. As expected the smell is a big burst of coffee. Some chocolate and dark fruits manage to just barely creep in. Also some bourbon notes. Taste smacks you with coffee up front. Some burnt malt notes and some major bitterness kick in also. Big thick chewy mouth. This one smacks you across the face with the coffee smell and never lets go. Not for the faint of heart but those of you who are up for something different and in you face will want to try this one for sure."
"Well done by one of the best micro in Montréal."
"Overall, this is a great example of a coffee stout. Don't expect much of anything else though."
"The beer pours opaque black with a creamy massive tan head that holds and laces nicely. The smell is full of roasted espresso with sweet chocolate and dark fruity hints. The taste is up front with roasted espresso as well and massive chocolaty sweetness. It is amazing how well the coffee flavor comes through and integrates itself into the beer so nicely. Amazing flavor. THe beer had a full body with creamy carbonation. Effervescent without being overcarbonated. Very well done. Overall, an amazingly drinkabout 9% coffee stout. This one hides the abv quite well. I'd be tempted to have it for breakfast if it was around all the time."
"If I where going to go to hell for drinking this beer I don't think I would care, it's that good."
"After I was finished with this one, I didn't want to lose the flavor in my mouth. I waited a good half hour before finally moving on to something else. I put a few of these in the cellar, and can't wait to pour another one of these on a cold winter's day."
"This is a very drinkable and pleasing coffee stout. I remember this going down easy last April on a cold Dark Lord morning at Three Floyds. Very nice."
"This pours a deep pitch black with a finger of beige head when poured into a large snifter. Lace sticks to the sides of the glass like boil over foam on the sides of a brew kettle. Head dissipates down to swirls and contrails of bubbles. The aroma is of sweet malts and iced Sumatra coffee; it's like mixing sweet wort with your morning brew then throwing it in the fridge to enjoy once it's cooled. The taste is like the aroma, sweet coffee with bitter hints of espresso. I pick up very faint chocolate flavor, but for only a split second then it evaporates away like somebody threw a quad shot of espresso at an ethereal apparition. This is outstandingly well balanced between the caramelized sugar flavor & coffee, with the coffee riding out the taste buds for an outstanding aftertaste. Wow, it's hard to imagine that there's any alcohol in this brew, let alone 9.5%. This is one of the smoothest drinking stouts that I've had, and that's helped with a nice medium mouthfeel and light effervescent carbonation that sticks around till the end. This amazing stout has truly lived up to my anticipation, it's not just hype, it's damn near perfect in my opinion."
"been after this one for a while, and from beginning to end, it was wonderful. jet black coming out of the bottle, and the way the head rose was just amazing. black beer with a coffee 'n' cream colored head and ruby slippers. lace was great. this is how i want my stouts to look. scents of coffee, milk duds, root beer barrel candy, a hint of booze and faint musty herbalness are what i get from the nose. nice complex mix in the taste with bitter, roasty, smoky coffee up front, myriad of stuff in the middle, and back to smoky, roasty bitter in the creamy warming finish. wonderful. a real treat. in my top five best stouts of all time, maybe top three. i need more...."
"very nice."
"M + D: Rich, and just creamy enough for the style / flavours. The finish lingers on the palate forever, allowing each sip to be savoured for quite some time. An excellent beer, I prefer it over some others of a similar style such as Alesmith's Speedway Stout or Southern Tier's Jah-va. ABV makes it a sipper, but it's a challenge!"
"by far one of the nicest stouts I've had in recent memory. a silky smooth layer of rich yet balanced coffee starts it all out and continues to the long finish all the while never losing any balance with the malt, hops, and other delightful undertones. if you see this beer, buy it!"
"I see why this beer is so highly regarded! It has a very nice thick rich sweetness that mingles with the coffee but is never overrun by it. The problem with large coffee beers, in my experience, is that they tend to become Starbucks drinks. This one teeters near that edge but doesn't fall over it, which is impressive. The malts are incredibly thick and rich, the mouthfeel is just luscious. There is a nice sweet malt backbone providing a bit of dark chocolate that mingles with the nice coffee flavors to produce a fine drink. The alcohol helps the acidic coffee finish dry the very sweet beer out, allowing for the next sip. A very nice concoction that, despite everything, is fairly straightforward. There is a slight note of oxidation in the bottle, which possibly suggests that it is a bit older, but the liquor store I bought it at is known for its quality control so I am forced to conclude that it is the brewer's fault. A very good beer, though ultimately a little one-dimensional."
"The beer pours a deep black color with a thick frothy tan/brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a nice coffee infused earthiness that lends itself nicely with the black malts. It's quite dry and bitter. The taste is good. It's smooth, but with a dry earthy finish. The coffee and patent malts create a very bitter flavor that would be a little easier to swallow with some chocolate malts. The mouthfeel is decent. It's a full bodied beer, but I would have liked a bit more body. It seems a little thin for a BIG beer. This is a very tastey beer. I love that Canada is brewing some world class craft beers. My hats off to them. Thanks to jjayjaye for the opportunity to try this one."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Great flavors make for easy consumption. I could drink coffee all day, but I'd rather it be beer so this works out great."
"up to all the hype. Santé!"
"Smell is amazing fresh coffee, chocolate, and earth. This beer is very different from other coffee beers I've had. The coffee is dominating, almost to the point of eating a coffee bean. Flavor is roasted and it grows quickly and powerfully. Bitter chocolate backs up the java nicely. The taste of coffee stays and is a welcome guest; this beer rocks it."
"Merci beaucoup, Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel!"
"Drinkability - the other bottle will get some cellar time. I know it will affect the coffee flavors but I want to see what it also does to the char. As is, a fine brew that earns its rank. Disappeared way too fast for me, palate adjustment and warming make this one outstanding."
"D-What can I say...the ONLY beer during our marathon tasting evening that I had TWO of! This stuff is crazy good...but you best be ready for a coffee and roast assault. This is a beer with some serious kahones. I like this brew from a bottle just fine, but on tap it is a different beast."
"Pours a beautiful dark brown color with a hint of red - thick foamy 1 inch caramel head. Smells of rich roasted coffee dominates. Heavy lacing clings lovingly to the glass. First sip is all coffee, not just coffee but really good coffee. I love coffee (not as much as beer). This brew is brewed with really good java! Mouthfeel is creamy, bordering on milkshake like. There is some chocolate coming through but make no question, coffee is the star. Very good...close to World Class!"
"Great sipper, a wonderful brew."
"Overall decent drinkability. Not something I'd drink on a daily basis, but a good treat every once in a while."
"I think this beer will mellow a bit with age. I would love to try this again in a years time. Im a little torn on Peche Mortel, its a good beer, its a big beer but it needs some time to balance out before it can be considered in the same league as the big boys."
"drinkability: pretty good, given the bitterness and abv"
"After a slow pour a black brew with hues of ruby is topped off by a thin dark tan head that fades fairly quickly with some jagged and clingy lacing left behind. Plenty of complex aromas here with deep roasted malts and burnt wood up front, roasted almonds, cigar smoke and dark chocolates in the middle, and some caramel and a bit of breadiness in the back. The taste is incredibly smooth yet complex and fulfilling with big roasted malts up front that are mixed in with dark and sweet chocolates, coffee, some dark fruits, and a sweet and spicy middle. The palate is left with a nice lingering essence of hops and maybe a slight bit of cream for the coffee. Mouth-feel is full bodied yet drinkable despite the alcohol content and somewhat crisp at times despite the aforementioned creamy quality. Carbonation is active more so than most stouts of this magnitude. This is a brew is one to be savored and respected."
"M&D - Thick, but not as thick as something like ST's Choklat or Dark Lord. Certainly not thin, either, but with a decent amount of carbonation. I'd compare it to Left Hand's Milk Stout as far as overall body goes. This is certainly a drinkable beer, but if I'm in the midst of a night of fine beer sampling, I don't know if I wouldn't want to try something else instead of having another go at this. Again, a mighty fine beer, but nothing that I would place in the highest echelons of beerdom, or stoutdom."
"Pours a solid black that lets no light through. Has a large fluffy mocha/tan head that subsides quickly, but laces the glass on the way down. Aroma is roasted coffee with some flowery hops distant in the background. Taste is heavy on the coffee, with some mocha hiding in there as well. A roasted bitterness consumes your mouth after each sip. Carbonation is a bit high for the style, but lends to a creaminess that offsets the bitter coffee. You need to like coffee flavors to like this one because that flavor is intense here. I enjoyed drinking this."
"I'm wondeirng why this beer is so well regarded. Extreme excess of both hops and coffee, no balance whatsoever."
"As you can see from the score... I still very much enjoyed this... the higher carbonation didn't seem to make the beer spritzy, or unduly heavy or thin.... it aided in the creaminess, to my tastes. But I think they should reign that mineral quality in just a tad."
"D- Easy to drink, nice and smooth."
"I had tried this a few months ago and was not impressed at all, but im glad i gave this another chance, it was wonderful. One of the best coffee stouts out there."
"Pours an opaque darkness with better than a finger deep foamy dark tan head that fades fairly quickly, leaving spotty patterns of lacing. The smell is amazing deep dark gooey chocolate, roasted malt, a bitter coffee and some of the alcohol in the form of a cherry-vanilla. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is silky smooth, medium bodied. The flavor is big and chocolaty java. The coffee bitterness lingers along with the kiss of vanilla from the 9.5% ABV. Nicely done. A little lighter than i expected. Highly Recommended."
"Wow, delicious beer. One of the best coffee infused beers I have had. No alcahol warming to be found, which is not a suprise. As this is one full bodied, full flavored beer. I'm glad I still have another bottle. Gonna let this celler for a few years and update the review."
"D: Velvety delicious. This should be a sipping beer, but is so flavorful...I had to use restraint."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Poured from the bottle to a Unibroue Tulip glass. Pour looked like cola - dark brown/black and completely opaque. A finger of head supported by perfect, fine bubbles which formed such a neat order they looked like stacks of pearl necklaces. Smelled like it tastes - fine quality coffee and roasted malts. The hops come out and linger after the initial coffee and roast flavors subside. I can feel the warmth of the etoh only slightly. A little syrupy on the tongue but can still feel the mild carbonation. Has a bit of a bitter bite. Definitely a beer to be sipped - would probably only want to have one due to high alcohol content and fairly big flavor. Delicious."
"Tremendous coffee and dark chocolate notes lash at the palate upon the first sip, and continue until the very last. Balancing the onslaught are notes of gooey caramel, dark rum, and raisin. A well-carbonated finish of warming booze and hops round out the velvety-smooth, thick body. Peche Mortel leaves a sweet, bitter coffee aftertaste in its wake, although the body is a touch on the over-carbonated side. All in all, this is a heavenly beer, and well worth the $5.00 price-tag. *kicks hisself for only buying three bottles*"
"11.5 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, it pours dark brown/black with about an inch brown head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The aroma is great, it smells like roasted malt, coffee/espresso and a bit of chocolate. The taste is similar to the aroma, the roasted coffee/espresso taste is strongest, but bittersweet and milk chocolate are noticable too. There's also a lingering bitter coffee aftertaste. The alcohol is very well hidden. Mouthfeel is medium/full, it's rich and silky with average carbonation. It's also very smooth, which along with the taste makes the drinkability very good. I think this is an excellent beer. I definitely recommend this to others to try, especially if you like coffee."
"Excellent! Certainly one of the better coffee stouts around."
"Spotted a few bottle of these at Green's at Buford Highway, and went ahead and picked one up. Poured into my Stella Artois chalice. Pours a deep brown, nearly black color. Milk chocolate head that leaves just a little residue along the side of the glass. Smells like roasted coffee beans and tastes like a deep, rich espresso. Some chocolate undertones come out as well. Mouthfeel is silky smooth going down. Overall, I wish I had picked up more than one. This is an outstanding beer."
"Bottom line: This is a world class example of the style and I'm super happy that I got to try it and....I have a few more bottles so I can revisit at my leisure. A must try for anyone that's a fan of the style!"
"D_I am generally somewhat skeptical of the high intensity stouts that are rated so high on BA. To me it almost seems as if anything big gets rated highly and a sort of cult of personality following takes over. As this was my mindset going in, I have to say this delivered the goods. A wonderfully full bodied stout redolent of coffee flavour. At $5.35 a single, it is a bit pricey, but to me well worth it. I am glad a bought a few more."
"This is a definite example of perfection in its style."
"d: Big, big thanks to abankovich for the chance to try this one. Comes in a notch below Founder's Breakfast Stout, but it is still one of the best I've tried."
"Beer. It's not just for breakfast any more."
"Reminds me of Founders BS."
"D- awesome sipper, thanks for the trade"
"Will be very difficult to cellar the remaining case."
"D: A great beer to have on a cool or cold night. Wouldn't want this anywhere else. Very rich and complex, one of these is enough for me in a night. But a wonderful beer and great representation of a stout both in look and taste."
"Mouthfeel hits a nice balance with me. This is definitely one of the finer examples of an Imperial Stout. Balance is what makes this beer great. Highly recommended."
"Recommended..."
"Drinkability - Is Fantastic! A real gem! Glad I had the chance to try it. ABV hidden dangerously well. Definitely worth checking out if you can find it."
"Still solid, can't add much to my notes above."
"Thanks a lot for this one Harry! Dark, black liquid poured from the 12 oz bottle, and left a frothy, creamy, mocha head that lasted. In the nose, I got freshly brewed black coffee, rich dark chocolate, some vanilla, with a touch of wood smoke and hops. The flavour profile was quite enjoyable to me, as I love coffee. Fresh dark roast with loads of bittering hops, vanilla, dry, bitter dark chocolate, some smoke. Bitter with long lived coffee aftertaste. Creamy, and very drinkable considering the ABV. Quite a treat. Thank you Harry! :)"
"Great sipping beer here, not to rich and not too weak. Completely a coffee beer and if you don't like coffee you won't like this."
"Overall an amazing beer and i'm happy I got a chance to try it given that I found it by accident at the local shop. Seek out and enjoy!"
"the alcohol is very well hidden in this one, but it will sneak up on you. this isn't dark lord or the abyss, but it is top notch and worthy of the top 100 for sure."
"Ovr: This is an extremly good beer. I found myself comparing this to Devil Over a Barrell becuase I had it recently. This beer has mucuh more of a hop spice to me, and is a bit fuller tasting, though Devil is technically a porter. Overall fantastic."
"Split this among a few friends last night in celebration of the Hockeytown boys winning Lord Stanley's cup.Poured a jet black with a thinner creamy dark tan colored head,aromas obviously had deep dark roast coffee tones mixed with dark fruit and a hint of bitter chocolate.Mas what a silky smooth mouthfeel this is what make a very good beer a great beer no faults to its mouthfeel whatsoever.Flavors are rich but not overly so,smooth dark coffee and dark chocolate like a mocha espresso with a hint of spiced rum in the finish.A fantastic brew to end a fantastic night."
"Tastes rich and full. No bourbon type fusil or butteriness. Complex and seamless integration between the bean and grain. body is perfect. This is a beer that I would spend the night slowly drinking two of these. I was fortunate to have this on draft also, along with several other beers from this brewery and Hopfenstark (maybe the best saison I've ever had) at Spuyten Duyvil. Sorry, i had to brag a little. What a night!"
"Hard to come by but when and if I could have a lot of these, I would drink four or five right in a row."
"D - Very high drinkability on this one, especially for coffee fans. Alcohol is not present at all. Could easily pass for a 5% beer, except for the obvious symptoms of intoxication as I near the end of the bottle."
"Drinkability - The smoothness of the mouthfeel makes this brew extremely drinkable - it is so easy to quaff. The smell is incredibly alluring. Taste is over the top - one of the best coffee stouts I have ever had. The ABV is completely undetectable. Simply an awesome beer."
"Drank this one to celebrate passing my 1st kyu test in Aikido. Served in my DFH snifter. Poured an opaque black with a half-inch, tight, tan-colored head consisting of copious tiny bubbles. Dissipated into a fairly consistent cap within minutes. Sheets of lace; some legs, but somewhat spotty. Scent of roasted coffee dominates the nose on a malt background with just the slightest suggestion of sweetness. Taste consistent with nose with the roasted flavor more pronounced without being burnt; just the slightest suggestion of hops expressed at the finish. Mouhfeel is not quite medium-bodied with quite of bit of effervescence across the tongue, revealed as a slight burn. Faintest hint of alcohol and hops bitterness lingers at the finish between quaffs. Good drinkability, but not readily available in my area. Definitely need to make the trip to Montreal to sample more offerings from Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel"
"incredibly smooth and velvety, an amzing texture to it, medium body. slightly creamy with a good carbonation at the front of the mouth. the coffee flavors are very strong and do not let up on the aftertaste. sweet, roasty full flavors are there too."
"I was quite looking forward to trying this beer, and I was pleased when I did. It poured a deep black color with almost no head. I was looking forward to the coffee aspect of it, and I didn't note very much coffee on the nose, but when I started to drink it, and especially as it warmed the roasted coffee really started to come through. Although I was sharing the bottle after dinner and some other drinks, I found it highly drinkable and will look forward to enjoying it again soon."
"This beer is outstanding and well worth the $5.50 I paid for the 12oz bottle. For the next bottle, I will let it sit out for 30 or so minutes before popping the cap. The taste as it warms is as good as any stout I've had."
"Overall- Delicious! This is a dessert on its own!"
"Nicely drinkable for style - still a sipper."
"This is a once in a while beer IMO. A nightcap, or morning pick me up, but definitely not a session beer. Not a beer for the meek. not a beer for those who dont love coffee. IMO, slighty overhyped but still very good."
"Edit - My S.O. was cooking wings while I was drinking this and the smell of the chicken mingling with the flavor of the coffee made it start to taste like bacon. Which is awesome, IMO, though not entirely apropos of the beer review... digression apologies."
"Poured a beautiful pitch black with a nice one inch head. Smells heavily of coffee with some chocolate undertones. Each sip begins with a nice sweet coffee and finishes with the bitterness of a black coffee. The mouthfeel is medium with a nice creamy finish. I think I could have a couple of these at a time, a nice treat, but not something you could have continuously. Really glad I have a few more of these in the cellar for some aging."
"It is bit creamy, with a medium to full body and just a little too much carbonation (for my taste, anyway). This is certainly a most enjoyable coffee stout; I'm glad I spent the money and time getting to know it."
"Pours jet black with a thick tan head. Strong aroma of roasted coffee, chocolate, molasses, and licorice. Flavor has many of the same notes. The sweet malts and coffee present right up front and then disappear leaving a strong lasting bitter coffee finish. Mouthfeel is medium/thick and carbonation is medium/high. An excellent beer that might even be better with age."
"The beer poured a deep, deep black hole color, opaque. There was a thick 1 inch head, deep brown. The head receeded quickly. The aroma was strong coffee and chocolate that was pleasing, not overpowering. The taste had a pleasant and strong roasted malt character but was also a bit sweet to balance things out well. There was also a nice peppery note on my tongue that was interesting. A full bodied beer and definitely worth getting your hands on."
"D. I enjoy this very much, after it warms a bit. Not a session beer for sure, or for new beer drinkers. If you don't like coffee beers, leave this for someone that does. I was suprised that it was a twist-off bottle."
"large creamy dark lasting head with excellent lacing. cloudy black color. aroma is roasted nutty malt with notes of molasses.light notes of alcohol considering its 10pt its hidden well. toffee, smokey, brown sugar, under a full body of coffee beans this beer dances on the palate. average duration mainly sweet acidic, with liight bitterness. great beer."
"Smooth creamy carbonation. Fairly full texture, with some thickness, and some fine astringent powderiness. Plenty drinkable, for a coffee lover."
"D - I was expecting a whole lot of coffee and that's what I got. If this is what you are into, you will enjoy this beer."
"Black in color with a carbonated head of beige bubbles. The nose was filled with coffee, chocolate and citric hops. This continued into a medium to full-bodied beer with lots of carbonation to keep it fresh. Well-balanced and I think I will prefer it in a year or so once the hops have faded a bit."
"An extremely well-crafted brew that should find itself on the 'at least once' list of most enthusiasts."
"A bit thin in the mouth. Alcohol is very well hidden. A bit more vinous as it warms. Pretty nice."
"I wish my coffee tasted more like this. It appeared pitch black, of course, with a tan head and lacing. The aroma and flavor are both a little heavy on the phenols, too much clove, but aside from that being out of whack, this was a wonderful coffee-infused beer. The java took centerstage and really ran the show, the beer provided all the background of black roasted grains and a hits of dry cocoa. I do think this beer is a bit over-rated. I didn't get the sort of flawless complexity I get out of the other top beers. Still, this is worth trying once despite the high price tag."
"Pours an onyx black with a bold one finger dark brown head that slowly falls to a thin layer of bubbles. A fair amount of lacing is left on the sides of the glass. Smell is big on bitter coffee grinds, super dark chocolate, and some charred wood. Underneath all that is hint of booze and molasses with a touch of espresso. There's a tiny bit of lactose in the nose as well that fits in perfectly. I have a feeling this is about to get even better. Taste begins with smokey coffee and sweet caramel malt with a booze-like sting. More chocolate, more espresso, and some dark fruits as well. Aftertaste is sweet syrupy molasses with a slight alcohol burn. Just a big bold coffee beer with lots of underlying complex flavors. Mostly a smooth and creamy full feel with a slight tingle from the carbonation. Just an amazing beer experience, especially if you're a coffee drinker. Definitely a must try."
"Thank you for the trade again Adam."
"Peche Mortel is a fine coffee stout, but I question its position on the ""best of BA"" list... it's certainly not in my top 25 brews. But it's tasty and hard to find fault with. I don't often crave coffee stouts, but if this hits my state, at $5 a bottle the price is right for such a delightful, well-made brew. Recommended, just don't commit any grievous sin to get it."
"A really good beer overall, definitely one to seek after if you enjoy coffee stouts."
"Appears a pitch black hue absolutely no light shines through when held up to the light, although it does form a large tan moccha frothing head rising at least an inch above my Gulden Draak chalice. Aroma is full of dark chocolate black patent malt cocoa powder kind of scent with a strong smell of fresh roasted coffee. Some mild herbaceous hop notes follow but mainly I'm getting dark bitter chocolate and dark roasted coffee. Flavors break through with strong filtered coffee blended with whipped cream, truly a another great breakfast beer. Strong dark bitter chocolate flavor but tastes like coffee note much like a Bell's Java Stout or Founder's Breakfast Stout. That flavor comes off a bit one dimensional but it's okay with me I'm enjoying it, not much alcohol burn very well hidden. Not much noticeable hop notes either, but the dark chocolate and coffee bitterness reign supreme. Mouthfeel is full bodied soft even carbonation quite silky on the palate. Drinkability is challenging due to the complexity and rich chocolate and robust coffee flavors, not much alcohol noticeable but I guess that's the part that could get you. Definitely a beer that will make you crave it, I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it right here down the street from my house in Steubenville Ohio at Valley Wine Cellar."
"Drinkability is good, a tasty, very full flavored beer then most big stout fans will really enjoy, and whose heavy load is well carried. However, I don't think I'd want more then one, and I can see how some would criticize it for depending to much on the adjuncts. Something about the strength of the chocolate and coffee, combined with the phenolic nose, however, seem a bit homebrewish."
"Drinkability is kind of medium when cold but its nice once warmed. You can get a hint of the alcohol but its hidden pretty well. Can't have more than one or two of these bad boys."
"D--This is a tasty beer, particularly if you like these types of beer. A rare treat to be sure, but definately worth a try."
"D: This is one hell of a coffee stout and I would certainly put it on my short list for best impy stouts. The coffee flavor comes across a bit astringent but I'm nitpicking."
"12oz bottle purchased from Metro Joanette in Montreal. Pours black with a thin brown head. Nice, strong roasted malt aroma. First taste is very strong - an initial tanginess followed by the roasted malt, coffee and chocolate flavours. The pleasant tang remains throughout to the aftertaste with a decent level of bitterness."
"The body silks over the palate with an active carbonation. A delicious stout. Well balanced considering the amount of coffee involved."
"I need some eggs and toast after this. What a treat! If you're a coffee person, get this beer immediately! If you're not a coffee person, well... get this beer immediately!"
"Poured from 12oz bottle in Fin Du Monde Challace. Emptying bottle into glass results in 1.5 finger coco/kahaki head. This stout is so dark that it might have sucked the light from the room. Bouquet is of Burnt coffee and unsweetened chocolate. Taste initially of coffee, no surprise here, bitter chocolate, and more burnt coffee. Slightly bitter. Moderate drinkability, due in part to high abv I don't think that I could put back more then 2 of these in a sitting. Alcohol is completely masked by complex mesh of flavors. Slightly dry finish. Mouth feel is perfect, not cloying like other stouts of this variety. lingering taste of coffee. Highly recommended."
"pretty full, slick and oily. Slides down easily. This could be a dangerous beer at 9.5% and drinking this easily."
"Drinkability: At 9% the alcohol doesn't overwhelm you, but it'll creep up on you. A very intense flavour, maybe 2 of these, if I could find another one."
"One small bottle is more than enough, but this is one coffee stout, to me a style in itself that I would get a few more if I had the chance. Well made indeed."
"Fine fine easy drinking stout."
"A terrific brew that complimented the Triple Chocolate Decadence brownies I had perfectly."
"D: I could drink a lot more of this."
"I had the earlier release of this beer a few years back in a bomber and it tasted completely different than this. The earlier bottle had a luxurious, velvety, espresso flavor. This newer release has a burnt coffee flavor. Decent mouthfeel, but I have to think that there is something slightly off with this bottle."
"Great drinkability, but a definite sipper at the price it's available for now. But it's well worth it, not to mention how long it took me to get a hold of these bottles."
"I'd have to say this is the best coffee stout I've had, but if you're not a fan of coffee I could see you not liking it. To those who like coffee, this is a treat."
"D: Very tasty and drinkable. I enjoyed this beer a lot."
"Was it good, yes, was it worth what I paid, maybe, but I've had better stouts for lower costs."
"Drinkability: wonderful beer that is enjoyed slowly. One of the best big stouts I have ever had."
"Pours a pitch black with good fluffy light tan head and good lace. Nose is a ton of coffee with some roasted malt, but mostly coffee dominant. Comparable flavor to KBS, but not quite the masterpiece, but close. Great coffee flavor with roasted malt and some sugary sweetness. Some slight chocolate. Very very robust flavor. some slight hints of vanilla in here. Mouthfeel is just a touch on the thin side, but quite good. Drinkability is excellent. The abv is dangerously well hidden. Overall a fantastic stout that will surely be appreciated by many. A great coffee stout. Defenitely my favorite beer from Canada so far. Excellent"
"Overall, I'm usually not real big on beers that have lots of coffee flavor, but this one is done very nicely. In fact, probably the best I've had. Highly recommend."
"Re-review 2009 : I hate to say, but either this hit me just right when I had it last year, or this latest batch wasn't the same. Thinner than I remembered, and too much of the powdery chocolate taste that a lot of stouts have. Still a good beer, but not nearly as good as my favorites (Speedway, Ten Fidy, Expedition, Stone). We'll try it again next year..."
"Poured into a snifer glass from a bottle. Appearance is motor-oil dark. The smell of coffee and espresso are very prominant on this beer. The taste is great. A true sipping coffee stout. The mouthfeel was very pleassant and quite enjoyable. Amazing drinkability. This is one of my favorite stouts. Highly reccomended."
"Mouthfeel is ridiculous. It has a heavy, creamy body with ample carbonation, but it just vanishes from the palate with an exquisite dryness that coerces the next sip. Outlandishly drinkable."
"D- A strong desert beer to end the day with. Very good overall. particularly well balanced, which is rare for this style (from my limited experience)."
"Very drinkable, definite recommend. A awesome Sunday brunch brew"
"Drinkability- After first taste, I really enjoyed this beer thought it had possibilities; after the second, I'm almost 100% sure this is the best beer I've ever tried (to date). The only complaint that I have with this brew is that it's a bit warm toward the end but a little bit of time will cure that nicely. Although if I had to choose between keeping the intensity of the coffee and or loosing a bit of warming, I'd definitely keep the coffee. Great beer that I thoroughly enjoyed (wish it was American), big thanks to Ed!"
"Drinkability: Instead of chiming in with a half-snotty remark, let's just say it's ""alright"" and leave it at that."
"Mouthfeel is thick and viscuous, if not tremendously ""chewy."""
"Pours a deep black color lacking light with creamy tan head, ok retention, good lacing and oily residue on the glass. Smells of coffee (duh), anise, roasted malt, and a hint of alcohol. Tastes of espresso, roasted malt, and licorice with a finish of coffee, hops, and alcohol. Full bodied, good carbonation. Smooth and creamy with lots of coffee flavor, easy to drink but I wouldn't want more than 1 in a session."
"I had this one hyped up in my mind and was rewarded with a delicious tasting, well made stout. Maybe not as much as I hoped, but would not hesitate to jump at the chance to obtain more...."
"HV"
"Pours black with a medium nice head. Smell is lightly smoky, roasty, and coffee like. Taste is roasty coffee and rich dark chocolate with creamy cocoa like bittersweetness. Medium to thin bodied and very drinkable. Medium body and medium carbonation. Alcohol is completely hidden and I enjoyed the well blended coffee and chocolate flavors, neither of which dominated the other."
"Try that with brie or a blue (stilton), you'll be amazed to see how complex this potion is. Also, some bitter chocolate will do it justice too."
"D: This is definitely a sipper, especially once it warms. Tasty brew. Very glad I got the chance to try this."
"Drinkability is superb. This is the one area the Pisgah Valdez is a bit better than this classic coffee beer. Here the alcohol shines a bit more in the finish. But just enough to remind you that you are drinking beer. Which is a good thing. This is a beer for all of the coffee lovers out there. This is one of the best coffee beers I've had and one of the best beers period!"
"D- Great Imp Stout. Like a rich after dinner treat. If I could, I would probably drink several of these, but not really an option for me. Definelty does not try to disguise its 9.5%"
"Cheers!"
"A tasty treat for sure and well worth the hype (and PA single bottle price)."
"Edit: had an americano the next day and I thought 'peche mortel' before I thought 'coffee'. There you go."
"Final Statement: A remarkable achievement in beer. The perfect coffee beer. Highly recommend."
"Bière très lourde et riche en bouche, elle en est d'autant plus agréable à boire. Un % d'alcool qui passe presque inaperçu !"
"Notes - A great coffee stout, one of the best I've tried."
"Overall, this is a great beer. Not really what I was expecting BUT great none the less."
"Update: I just tried this one again. I would echo the nice coffee taste and lingering alcohol in the finish. To extend to comparison to the Breakfast Stout, I would say the coffee taste in this one is a bit more thin/watery that the BS but still quite good."
"Soft creamy mouthfeel and medium body make it more drinkable."
"This was a very, very nice stout. Would definitely enjoy another."
"D- I got a couple bottles of this and I am very happy to dispose of it. I like this beer a lot."
"franksnbeans thanks for letting me try this ""mortal sin"" I am truly indebted to you for this one."
"Have really wanted to try this brew since joining this site, have heard nothing but great things about this brewery in the past, will definitely drink again in the future and stock up on it when I finally make it Quebec some time, cannot wait to visit the source of this great beer, highly recommended even if you are not a big can of coffee in your brew, unforgettable taste, need more of this stuff soon"
"Very balanced, quite dangerous as the glass goes down fast and the alcohol is very well cloaked."
"I would love to try this one after spending some time in a bourbon barrel."
"A milk chocolate brown head with big bursting foam bubbles races to 3 fingers and has amazing retention. Body is as black as Elvira's eye shadow. Nose is big with fresh coffee but also brownies with walnuts baked in. Super smooth on first sip as it rains off the tongue and floods the mouth with creamy sweetness. Roasted coco beans are rich and stay chocolatey on the back of tongue long after each swallow. An ever so slight bitterness does arrise twords the end of the palate, but this just adds to the balance. Some winey dark fruits even show there face as the beer warms a bit. Rich bitter coffee like feel makes up a long but welcome mouthfeel. Alchol is well disguised and only shows itself in the belly. A very very good stout worthy of all the praise over the years."
"This beer has amazing flavor, perhaps not the ultimate in complexity, but it's well rounded enough that I could drink one anytime, all the time. Thanks to northyorksammy, I've been wanting to try this one for awhile..."
"Perfect beer! Appearance like a guinesse, smeel coffee, torecfation, chocolat, caramel. So a complex beer and one of my favorite! I try this beer at my home and my friend said : WOW MAN THIS IS AMAZING.... I dont know what i can say about this . Ah yes, AMAZING"
"M/D: Full bodied, carbonation is light, a little slick on the tongue. Drinkability is good on this one, smells and tastes like a cup of coffee. If you love coffee, you could easily tie this one on."
"Alcohol is totally hidden."
"Overall this was excellent, really a finely crafter beer and one of the best examples of the style I have ever seen. The use of coffee was superb and the sweetness brought into the mix really helped to balance out the whole profile. This was easily something I would have to recommend and to be honest, something I would really like to seek out. Go get this if you can."
"Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"D: Incredible! This is the last of a three bottle Peche Mortel haul I made and I've been sitting on this bottle for about a year now. I am amazed at how sharp and flavorful it has remained (especially the hop flavors). Why is it that the good ones are so hard to find?"
"How highly acclaimed is this beer? Well, when I was at the brewpub, the bartender shared stories of customers driving 10 hours out of their way and paying as much as $80 a bottle to try it!"
"Poured into my Surly Darkness glass. A seemingly worthy beer for the darkness. Beautiful ebony with a surprising amount of milk chocolate head. Nose- all about the coffee so far. Really nice roast- not too dark. First sip- wow what a mouthfeel. Just glides on down. Really unique- the particular coffee used along with the drak malts imparts a sharp bitterness/burntness to it. A much darker burnt roasting than the nose suggests. At the same time, there is a touch of sweetness to the malts. very complex brew and commands attention! Very drying in the finish. Excellent beer, but the strong ash/burtness is a little overdone."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a huge foamy head with excellent retention and some nice lacing notes. Aroma consists of espresso type coffee with some notes of black chocolate. Taste is a well balance mix between some sweet and roasted malt with a dominant taste of espresso coffee with some notes of black chocolate. Very well balance overall with a full body and a creamy texture. Not cloying or overly dry in any way and alcohol is not apparent."
"noir comme du charbon, la mousse en subit, elle qui est brune aussi, nez puissant de café torréfié, au goût le café ce fait sentir encore plus, il est piquant, la finale est longue et amère encore une fois piquante, l'alcool ne se fait trop sentir. produit intéressant mais à mes yeux pas exceptionnel. à revoir"
"Drinkability is very good. The hype is justified. This is an excellent stout. I prefer this to the two ""Breakfast"" stouts from Founders. I bet this beer would even taste good served hot."
"A great winter beer, I am going to savour this 6-pack all season long. It's among the best in the world and is worth seeking out."
"Crazy roasted malt and coffee bitterness up front. Dark, strong espresso-like in intensity. Hints of dark, stewed, sweetish fruits show through mid-palate. Oily, rich, intense roasted coffee and dark chocolate bitterness take over again though and dominate through the finish. Wow. This is the strongest coffee-tasting beer I have ever had! Full-bodied with an oily feel. I am afraid that this will keep me up all night!"
"Drinkability: A supurb beer that I have been sitting on for about two years since I purchased it from Brawley's; bottled 8/05"
"Considering the strength, and the fact that I'm not a coffee drinker, this is one very drinkable stout. I have to pace myself, as I don't want it to be over too soon. Fantastic beer, my thanks again to my friend Jay who delivered a mix of Dieu du Ciel beers after a recent trip to Montreal."
"D: Dangerously drinkable."
"Pours a rich dark black color with a light brown, khaki colored creamy head that builds up and dies down quickly to leave a little lacing. Smell is of mild coffee, toasted malt, light bready, sweet doughy smell. Taste is slightly sweet, followed by a slight bitter taste. Creamy mouthfeeling on this one."
"Pours opaque black with a dark chocolate head that dies to nice lacing. Smells of roasted coffee beans and chocolate notes. Tastes of delicious coffee beans, some bakers chocolate and a minor hop bite. Medium in the mouth with a tickle of carbonation. Surprisingly very easy to sip, could go for another. Weird combo but complements my quiche very nicely."
"Had on cask at the brewpub in Montreal during the beer fest. This is a tremendous beer. Black as night, like motor oil. Tremendous espresso and chocolate aromas. I can only describe this as liquid chocolate. Intense cofffee flavours, rich, smooth and creamy. The alcohol is not apparent at all, and at 9%, this is one dangerous and potent brew."
"Bottled August 2005. Pours black with a light brown and tan head, some yeast remnants evident in the end of the pour, the head recedes to a ring. Strong roasted malt and earthy aroma, slightly twangy but mainly roasty with some coffee and sweet cola in the aroma as well. Coffee and roasted malts up front are soon followed by a strong sweet cola presence in the taste. A soft and subtle chocolate sweetness in the background of the medium body, finishing with a tangy roastiness that dwells into the somewhat dry aftertaste. Sweet cola seems to dominate the taste, hard to belive the alcohol is 9 percent as it is fairly non evident. This beer is holding up great for being nearly two years old, if the bottle wasn't marked I could easily guess it a fresh beer. Very nice beer when you're in the mood for a coffee stout. Thanks Dave for the opportunity."
"Drinkability- Damn, I really can't find much at all wrong with this beer. Frankly it's pretty damn incredible. It was aged for almost two years. I wonder what fresh would taste like or if I had sat it down for another year or so. Mucho thanks to Jetsbeer for this wonderful experience!"
"Got this one on-tap at Monk's on the recommendation of Elliot the bartender. Pours a deep dark brown-black, a touch of tan head on top that dissolves eventually. Nose is nice and strong, lots of coffee and chocolate tastiness. Taste is delicious. Similar to the head, although exceedingly smooth. Lots of coffee deliciousness, with a good amount of roasted malt, a little citrus, caramel malt, really a tasty and smooth beer - can't conceive of anyone not feeling this one. Feel is full and smooth, tasty. Drinkability is high; I can't believe this one is so high in ABV cause the alcohol does not even show up a bit. Really a fantastic beer, one that I will try and find again."
"Got in a trade with BeerBeing - thanks! Bottled in Aug 2005. Has a cool label with a picture of Eve and the snake and a story about the name Peche Mortel (mortal sin). Was a 660ml bomber and poured into my trusty pint glass. Was pitch black in color. Had a two finger brown head that quickly settled to a partial thin foam. Lacing was minimal. The aroma was coffee, coffee, coffee with a good hint of the alcohol within. The flavor has been described by others as ice coffee and I'd agree. Mouthfeel nice and solid. To be fair, I'm not a coffee drinker and generally don't like things with a lot of coffee flavor so the taste and drinkability take some hits for that. Still, I'd highly recommend this especially if you like coffee. Not a top 100 for my tastes but I can see why it gets a high rating by others. Was great to try once. (3.5, NA, T, O)"
"On tap at the pub. Huge coffee flavour with a ton of caffeine. At 9% you can barely taste the alcohol at all. This beer albeit expensive, is a must try for any and all BA's. Very dark, almost black, 2 finger head, modest lacing. Slight malt flavour. In a two word description: ICE COFFEE. Highly recommended. Chris"
"Excellent beer all around...worthy of the high praise bestowed upon it. Not quite on the level of Kentucky Breakfast or Dark Lord, but not far behind."
"This is a magnificent beer and perfect in every one of its complex dimensions. It was almost like drinking a perfectly pulled double espresso with a shot of alcohol."
"Overall Impression- This was part of the flight entitled Extreme Beers. It was very big and very robust. That's my kind of beer and I think I could drink quite a few of these."
"This produced a big, thick, deep-brown head with magnificent retention. The color was black. Jet black. Black as the Ace of Spades, it was. Even the white bits was black. Oh, aye, it were black. The nose gave off light banana esters with a heavy burnt-bean coffee scent overlaying everything. The mouthfeel was thick and chewy with a charcoal taste on the tongue. The finish was biting with a burnt aspect to it followed by a smokiness on the extreme finish. I was actually starting to sweat from drinking this one!"
"The final beer from my sampler at the Sunset Grill and Tap - 5 oz. in a miniature pokal-type glass. It is possibly the most beautiful stout I have yet encountered: jet black, with a quarter inch of dense tan head. After taking an hour to eat dinner and review my first three samples, the head did not budge one millimeter, and it retained for the additional half-hour it took to consume and review this beer - I've rarely seen such head retention, especially in a brew of this strength. The aroma is packed with espresso, hot chocolate, and roasted malts - reminiscent of kahlua mixed with creme de cacao. There is a huge espresso presence on the palate with notes of chocolate/creme de cacao, apple?, green hops, and an assertive bitterness on top of a thick, incredibly smooth, drying, almost powdery body that leaves a prolonged finish, lasting until it is washed away when ""Oaked, Smoked, and Ruined"" with the Bros. and other BAs at the Deep Ellum. Overall an expressive coffee stout loaded with flavor, and one I was happy to find (especially on-tap), but it was a bit too much in some respects."
"On tap at Ebenezer's Pub in Lovell, ME. A truly sublime beer. Dark black, fairly thick mocha head that lasts well. A strong, pleasant aroma of coffee. Espresso taste, with a little burnt malt and sweet chocolate. Very well balanced. Smooth, creamy. I could drink this all night."
"Overall, an outstanding stout, ideal for savoring on its own."
"Pours out black with a creamy off-white head that leaves very good lacing. A little more head and I'd have given it a 5. Smell is full of coffee, hints of nuts and cocoa are present as well. To be honest, this one smells and tastes of a Christmas morning breakfast one could conceivably only think about. Waking up to the perfect blend of coffee with some vanilla whipping on top. That's what this beer is; don't let it fool you, there is a lot of coffee, but this is no simple beer for simple-minded folk. Mouthfeel is creamy and rich, I wanted more and more but I had to pace myself or Christmas would go by much too fast. An exceptional beer for sure, one I will be seeking out again. I can only imagine a fresher bottle would show me how badass this beer really is."
"Pours a big head that falls into almost nothing, but has a good lacing. The smell is beautiful coffe smell that's just wonderful. The taste is a big hit of different coffee tones that hit you from first sip until the aftertaste which is a great coffee flavor. There are also notes of nice chocolate. The mouthfeel is smooth, nice. Overall I would love to have more, but fresher belive it or not."
"As far as I know (or frankly, as far as I could understand the waiter who served me), this beer is only available at the Brasserie in Montreal. They do bottle it, but it's not allowed to be taken off the premesis. There are apparently plans to expand the production facilities and distribute the beer. My waiter said sometime in the spring it should be more widely available. Also, a big thanks to him, it wasn't on the menu, but he managed to snag me one from their private stock in the basement."
"Poured into a chalice a black color, nice carbonation, not much of a head or lacing afterwards. Looks like some oil slick on top. The nose is of roasted malts, hops, toffee aplenty, and slight alcohol. The taste is superb of malts/hops, and tons of toffee. I believe I've never so far had a brew with this much toffee in it. Nice warming effect when going down. Medium body, well rounded brew. Very drinkable, a very very nice American Double Stout."
"D: The stout is absolutely drinkable. A big dark murky brew full of robust stout and coffee flavors, this is a must have."
"Due to it's overwhelming qualities, one bottle is enough in one sitting. Worth trying once in a lifetime..."
"Bottled in 08/2005. Poured into a snifter, it looked a chocolatey brown. But in the glass its another story. All black, with a medium brown, tighly bubbled, fizzy head that actually managed to hang out for a bit. The aromas and flavors are all Starbucks. Maybe one of the venti mochas or macchiatos that I get on Fridays because they open at 0520 instead of 0600. I have to say, this is the second coffee imperial stout Ive had in three days (Southern Tier Javah), and I really dont like the way carbonated coffee feels on my tongue. It almost feels like Im eating a damn cactus. I can certainly see why this beer scores well. Its big and bold, and it will put you down in a hurry. I just cant see myself really enjoying this beer regularly."
"Is it worth it? For me, it is certainly worth the splurge to try it once but in comparison to similar beers from Bells, Alesmith, and Founders it just doesnt hold up for repeated visits because of price and obscurity."
"Cheers!"
"Very well done and if you like espresso this is your brew. Very expensive, $16 for a bomber in Ohio, and I bought 3. One to sample and 2 to lay down for a few months. Closest competition is Bell's Java Stout or Alesmith Speedway. I really should do a tasting with my Dark Lord included."
"Much thanks to JesseDaniels for sharing this gem."
"Pours deep dark black, some red in the edges, small tan head forms, some lace spots. Smell is awesome, very malty, toffee/chocolate and tons of coffee aroma, very raw and very powerful. Taste is malty and choclate/toffee notes are in the front, followed by a big coffee roast hit, lots of coffee in the finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full bodied with low carbonation. I really enjoyed this, better on cask than in bottle, and I understand this was the first time DDC has ever done Peche Mortel on cask!"
"Appearance was a black, even held up to light, with a small dark brown head that dissolved into a ring of brown bubbles. Aroma of black coffee, dark chocolate. Taste was like chocolate-covered espresso beans, very complex and warming and got better with each sip. This was the smoothest beer I have tried, silky and thick and the high ABV is almost inperceptable. Wow... So glad I tried this, best beer Canada makes IMHO."
"drinkability is also excellent. i wish i had steady access to this beer. i'd love to try this one with a year or two of aging as i think it'd be even more amazing. highly recommended to everyone."
"On tap at Dieu Du Ciel served in a tulip glass. Just exceptional appearance, black body with a dark brown head that persists, beautiful. Smells of roasted coffee. Taste, well let's just say it hits with a bang, what flavor! Very rich espresso flavor with a hint of caramel. One of the best tasting beers I've ever had. Mouth feel is medium bodied with light carbonation, very smooth. I found this beer quite drinkable despite the richness and high alcohol. It didn't take long to go through 2 glasses along with a nice cheese plate of assorted Quebec cheeses. I highly recommend this beer."
"A fantastic beer. I am a big coffee fan, so that probably helped. If you don't like coffee, this beer may not work that well for you. It is pricey ($20) and hard to find, but I would still encourage a try, though, as there are so many other things going on in it. Another one of those ""How am I going to get some more"" beers."
"Overall: This beer is great. It is exactly what I expected. Thank you Himerman for this great beer."
"My opinion: Peche Mortel is a great beer, maybe best of its under-represented style, but nowhere near worth its price."
"D: Not a lot of bad things to say about this beer. Carbonation could be a touch smoother and the head could be a bit bigger. The beer itself is delicious. Highly recommended."
"Notes: Damn, this beer is gonna haunt me. So good that I went back to have it again the next night, but they were out of it. Searched for bottles before I left town, but came up empty. Not only one of the best stouts I've had, but one of the best beers I've had."
"Very nice mouthfeel, full mouthfeel, light oiliness that adds to the drinkability and breaks up some of the alcohol. Still dangerously drinkable."
"Pours a two finger light brown head that fades quickly leaving traces of lace. Black as coal. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Strong coffee nose. Starts with a strong roasted coffee flavor and stays that way, the 9.0% ABV is totally hidden, easy to drink, you have to like coffee. Pricey - $17.00 for a 660ml bottle from Liquid Solutions Tigard, Or."
"Drinkability: A little different and more dessert-like than many beers in the style, the whole thing is silky smooth and well crafted. You have made a very good ber Dieu Du Ciel. Too bad you charge an arm and a leg for this stuff."
"Mouthfeel- Good and creamy and malty. Inky, oily and silky all at different intervals. I wouldn't recommend having this beer with anything. Just drinki the whole glass by itself and then eat myabe a chocolatey dessert."
"Cheers."
"A dark brown/black beer. Has a nice foamy brown head. It smells like chocolate covered coffee beans. There is also an earthy malt note in the background. The chocolate coffee bean character continues in the taste with the coffee taking full control at the swallow. If you have ever eaten a chocolate covered esspresso bean then this comes mighty close. Especially with that coffee flavor that sits at the back of your throat long after you are done."
"I find it interesting (and ironic) that a brewery named 'God of Heaven' brews a double stout called 'Mortal Sin'. Peche Mortel could use a little of that tension, a little of that fascinating dichotomy, instead of being a steamroller of a coffee beer that doesn't allow complexity to flourish and, therefore, ends up being one-dimensional. For the millionth time... if you love coffee as much as you love beer, then Peche Mortel should be at the top of your wish list."
"Poured an opaque black color with a thick brown head. Smell is roasty and coffee. Taste follows suit with a creamy double espresso taste and texture. Wow. This is the best coffee stout I have ever had bar none. Seems like a ton of Cafra malt? Coffee beans? Whatever it is, I want to switch my regular coffee to this just dont think my boss would enjoy that. You would never know this is 9% ABV until the tingle at the end of the 22ozer. Worth the price."
"Excellent beer. Dark brown with head about an inch thick. Great coffee smell and taste. This is one of the best beer I ever had. You gotta love Dieu Du Ciel in Montreal for making this fine example of a coffee stout. Alcohol level is high but doesn't over power the smell and taste of the beer. Any one who loves beer and coffee needs to try this beer. Only draw back is that it is very hard to find. I know Monks Cafe in Philly had it about two months ago so if you are in Philly - drop in to see if they have it"
"This is way too easy to drink, the 9% alcohol is nearly invisible. I love this beer. I gotta find a way to trade for some more!"
"Sticking my nose in the glass was like walking into a starbucks, the coffee so overwhelming it was useless to go for anything else, Taste was also coffee dominated,but not as rich full and intense as thearoma would lead you to believe,a touch of sweetness coffee bean bitterness in the end. The price makes it an occasional treat, an honest to god caffine buzz for several hours after consumption"
"rich, full mouthfeel and a medium carbonation. strong coffee flavors throughout, with the finish a touch sweeter and a little vinous. strong coffee component gets stronger as the beer warms and gets slightly tiresome towards the end of the bottle."
"Drinkability... not bad for a double stout, but the price knocks it down a bit. I am glad I had it, since it is my goal to try as many of the top 100 (and worst 100 as well)... but I don't think it was worth $15.99. I thought Speedway Stout was better."
"Cask on in fall 2007 was way too much coffee grinds and did not work."
"660ml bottle: Bottled 08/05. It was with great anticipation that I opened this beer. I was a touch disappointed, as I thought it may fall into my top ten beers. It pours a somewhat thick, inky brown color. There was a good bit of a tan head on it that lingers for awhile. The aroma definitely has coffee in it. A bit of a smokiness to the nose also. The taste is definitely coffee, with some of the smokiness in there also. The taste is somewhat bitter, but there is a hint of sweet chocolate malt hiding in there also. This beer is quite good, but I dont quite agree with some of the very high ratings."
"22er. Black color. Thick, creamy head. Moderately aromatic, mainly just pure dry coffee grounds and perhaps a touch of vinous fruits and chocolate. In terms of the flavor, there isnt much besides the coffee addition. Its substancial enough to still retain loads of flavor, but its devoid of anything close to malt complexity and the body and texture is definately lacking as well."
"Drinkability is solid but not as varied and palate coating as I would have expected with the nose this gives off. Sort of unfair but minorly disappointing to be honest."
"This was certainly not as easy to drink as Founders Breakfast Stout, or my local favorite Terrapin Wake and Bake. Unlike those beers, this was missing the rounded oat texture. Without that aspect, it felt slightly harsher and edgier."
"Beautifully done. I'm glad I have 1 more of these in the cellar. We'll see how it reviews a year from now. If I can forget about it for that long."
"I've had this beer sitting down in the cellar for about 4 months and its about time I tried it. Poured fast into a pint glass with a light foamy head that dissipated quickly. Three was not a shred of light getting through this beer...black as night. Smell was intense with coffee aromas dominating and hints of chocolate, espresso and whiskey hiding in there somewhere. The coffee was even stronger upon tasting...similar to Founder's Breakfast Stout except with more coffee if you can imagine that. Not cheap instant coffee mind you, but intoxicating Columbian coffee that will leave its presence with you for a while after finishing. As it warmed up a bit, some of the chocolate characters really made themselves known, offsetting the coffee ever so slightly. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and a tad lighter then I had anticipated, but the big flavors made up for it completely. One of my favorite things about this beer was the 9% alcohol...not weak by any means, but strong enough to make its presence known. Me being somebody who enjoys a good cup of coffee, I could drink this beer often without feeling too intimidated by the big tastes. Final verdict is that this is an exceptional beer. It might not appeal so much to people who don't like a cup o joe every now and again, but even so, its still a beer that is worth sampling for the complexities alone. It may be a bit pricy if you find it in your area at $16, but I can say that I'de pick it up again and save it for a special occasion. It is unique, rich, interesting and damn tasty. Anyway im gonna stop reviewing and get back to drinkin. Try, Try, Try"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy with a good steady carbonation. It's a touch lighter than I expected but still definetly makes its presence known. It's very enjoyable to sit down to a bottle of this...but I think one would be enough in a sitting. Rich, decadant and a sure bet for any coffee stout lover. Thanks to Shelton and Dieu Du Ciel for bringing this to the USA and into my beer loving hands, even though the high price will keep it out of my hands most of the time. Guess it's time for a trip up north!"
"Body is between medium and large, I was expecting huge. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with minimal carbonation and a dry mouthfeel. Good, but for the price I was expecting something that would blow me away. This did not."
"I have one more of these and I can't wait to drink it. We will see what happens with that one."
"22 ounce bottle. Bottled on 8/05. Purchased at Brawley's."
"The beer is dangerously easy to drink with no hint of ABV anywhere to be found. Quite a well crafted brew."
"Drinkability: Just an excellent coffee beer. Very drinkable not to sweet and not to hoppy. Just perfection in a beer bottle."
"Overall: A great, great stout that uses the coffee flavors creatively and daringly. Worth the 23 bucks I paid for it? Well, probably not, but it's an interesting taste to try once. I'd try it again at a reasonable price."
"The beer pours dark brown/ black with a big tan head but what really stirs the senses is the strong nose of coffee followed by rich dark chocolate. The first taste follows the coffee/ chocolate theme with complexity and smoothness combined in a marriage parfait. Truly one of Canada's best beers and a benchmark for coffee stouts."
"D- This is a unique beer it has many different coffee flavors some off and some very nice. I couldn't taste any of the grains and hops that would have really giving a nice compliment or balance to the coffee."
"Cheers"
"Bottled on date of 8/05. Pours out a thick opaque black with a nice sized velvety tan cap of foam. Some streaky lace was left around the glass as this was consumed. HUGE roasted coffee bean and espresso aroma more so than any other coffee beer I have had. Lingering underneath the giant coffee scent was some dark chocolate notes add a nice sweetness to all the coffee bitter. Taste follows suite with a big coffee punch with plenty of roasted malts and a good bit of bittersweet dark chocolate. This is definitely all about the coffee and while it may seem over the top it was never too much. Dry roasted espresso finish. Nice solid body that carries the big flavor very well and stays smooth. Pretty damn drinkable considering how powerful the coffee comes on. Great stuff especially if you like coffee."
"Bomber bottle, cost me $15, high cost, but a fine brew. Pours the expected jet black , with a dark tan head, leaving moderate lacing. Its no suprise to announce that this is a rich, dense, flavorful, chewy brew. Loaded with roasted, burnt flavors. Also loaded with heaps of chocolate, coffee, smokey, and burnt flavors. Big and bold, coffee stout lovers rejoice, glad I got to try a bottle of this stunner."
"A slow-sipper for sure. This is not a beer to drink on an empty stomach."
"and, happily, this is a sipper, which means I get to enjoy it longer than other beers that slip down the gullet with more ease. I just might be set for the night."
"It was nice to try on-tap without having to drop $17+ on a bottle. A coffee lover's dream.. and would be a fantastic dessert beer as well."
"My dessert pairing on this thanksgiving night. Pours straight black with a thick creamy tan head. Aroma is pure espresso and anise, and it's strooong. The alcohol doesn't hide either; present mildly in the nose and moreso in the taste, showing itself throughout, into the finish and warming in the aftertaste. Flavor shows off notes of dry roasted cocoa and a huge wallop of bitter Italian coffee beans. Blackened espresso. Yow. There's a lingering hop bitterness, but the coffee/espresso flavor brings all the bitterness you'll need. Sharp astringency on the tongue leads to a creamy smoothness that gradually thins out. This is very good; however now that I've had it I do think it is quite overhyped, and way too pricey."
"Overall, an interesting coffee stout (my first). It seems pretty one dimensional to me (all coffee), but it is enjoyable and decadent."
"i might like coffee now"
"Don't get me wrong this is quite an enjoyable beer, for the most part; The finish really is a bit too harsh, and the nose has a bit of the harsh notes as well. I wish that all of this beer had the balance and richness that is found up front in the taste."
"World Class in my book."
"edit: after drinking more of this beer, it was an absolute must to increase my ratings. This is probably my favorite beer at the moment, but it's a shame that I bought and drank the last bottle in stock (and probably the last we'll see at John's Grocery for quite some time)."
"(Swigged with great joy at this batch's NY debut at Spuyten Duyvil)"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass carefully, and still formed a 3 1/2"" dark brown head over the totally opaque dark brown/black brew. Head fades oh-so slowly, with HEAVY foamy cappucino-type lacing. Aroma is deep, rich coffee. Taste begins with a sweet dark maltiness that is quickly overpowered by the same rich coffee flavors indicated by the nose. Closes with dry coffee grounds in the mouth, and not a bit of alcohol indications. Mouthfeel and drinkability are exemplary, especially for the style. Search this one out, if you needed to be told again..."
"Beer is good - NO! EVIL!!! Happy EVIL sinful beering. (4.44/44) Moo-hoo-hoo-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!!"
"g/f thinks this is too 'alcoholey,' but i dont get that at all, maybe im too conditioned to big beers. sure, its smooth and drinkable, but there's not much more to it. maybe the best of the coffee stouts (not the best if you count dark lord), but that would only really matter to a coffee stout head... which i am not. a perfectly quaffable and enjoyable beer. next time i have $8 to spend, and its between this and a chalice of st bernardus abt 12 or another staple big beer, ill skip by the peche mortel..."
"Nitro Draft 7/05... Creamy mouthfeel with a great balance of chocolate and roasted coffee malts. Faint alcohol in the background. Now I see what the big deal is."
"Bomber provided by PatYoda...thanks for the opportunity! Bottle date = 11/04. Pours a one finger walnut brown head over a stark black liquid. Dark even when held to light. Smells woody coffeeish (a little bit like french roast coffee) and vanilla. A hint of something...not quite terpentine, but in that line. In context with the other flavors, it's not a negative, it's interesting. Tastes rich coffee, but also a really rich chocolate. Like crunching on a couple coffee beans while holding a mouth full of sweet dark chocolate. There is a bitter from the coffee and/or roasted barley, but the wet sweet of the chocolate counters it to the point that the aftertaste leaves my mouth watering for more candy. Too bad my wife wasn't around when I cracked open this one...she would have loved it. I've only had one glass (I shared the bomber with absolutesites), but it's quite filling. Alcohol burn is barely noticable during the swallow, as it mixes with the coffee bitter that is covered by the chocolate. Very intense flavors, but only flavors of coffee and chocolate...not much else. Considering the intensity of the flavors, I would have expected the body to be more than medium. Also in the mouthfeel, I should note the aftertaste almost felt like there were tiny pulverized bits of roast floating around in the chocolatey nectar that hung on my tongue. Carbonation is moderate and the head has hung around until the very end. Both the smell and taste are very enticing and I kept putting the glass to my mouth immediately after drawing it away from the last sip. This could become a banned substance someday."
"Drinkability: This is an all around great beer. Of course, if you like coffee, this is indeed your beer. On the flip side if you hate the taste of coffee, stay away. This beer combines dark chocolate and espresso flavors wonderfully. Very tasty."
"Enjoyed at the brewpub after an afternoon at the Mondial. Aged for one year, labeled as #42 from Avril, 2004."
"Pours a very dark color with a tall, creamy head that has good retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma makes me think oatmeal coffee stout. The flavor has a lot of coffee and a lot of dark malts, but the alcohol is very apparent. It's a nice big, malty coffee stout, but it has too much alcohol in the flavor, makes it slightly burny. The mouthfeel is a little more thin than I would like it, but still moderate to thick. Drinkability is ok. Don't think I could do a whole bottle of this."
"Drinkability is very good for a 9% ABV. There is only a light warming in my stomach, and a light puff in nose. Very good beer. The flavor is intense but not offensive. Too bad this was my only bottle. I won't hold the gushing against this beer."
"Holy shit! Thanks to Kev for sharing this one. 22oz. bomber that spewed for 30 seconds upon opening, then poured into a snifter. It pours a deep jet black color with two fingers of medium tan head. There's a good amount of lacing. The smell is so incredibly strong, with lots of espresso and a touch of chocolate. There's some candied plums too. The taste is very rich and malty. There's lots of roasted malt with lots more coffee coming through. A warm mocha finish with just a tad bit of alcohol. The mouthfeel is nice and thick, and for 9%, the drinkability is through the roof. A damn fine beer. Thanks again to Kevin, I owe him bigtime!"
" Edit: As this was my first review, I was afraid to give fives. But, after my second bottle, and a little more experience reviewing beers, I feel less ripped off for my $25. The flavor is certainly not one-dimensional, but perhaps like mixing a Rogue Imperial Stout 01 with a Perkuno's Hammer from the cask with a lot of good coffee. Awesome. I think I'll make some pancakes with good Canadian maple syrup to go on top."
"And when you factor price into the equation, this beer is wildly overrated."
"Poured from bottle (11/04 freshness date) into my pint NERAX tumbler a bit below room temp this beer formed a good inch of medium coarseness head. Smell immediately reminds me of chocolate covered espresso beans. The head collapsed to a solid quarter inch with light brown lacing down the sides of the glass. The taste is immediately that of chocolate malt and coffee beans fading into cherry tart on the back of the tongue but the taste of coffee never really surrenders. A swig is pretty silky on the tongue with a mat of light carbonation raised as it passes into the throat. Overall a pretty entertaining and interesting brew (if you're into coffee) but I think the espresso taste kind of overshadows a lot of potential subtlety for me. Purchased for $16 at Uptown Liquors in Davis Square..."
"Deep black in color with slight ruby highlights. It was topped with a thick, clingy tan head made of oversized carbonated bubbles. The nose hits you with a sharp coffee/espresso aroma up front followed by chocolate a little cherry and roasted malt. WOW, a lot of coffee in the aroma. The heavy coffee aroma allows you to breath it in as you drink the beer. The coffee is followed quickly by a tangy citrus hop character, then the roast malt, and finally some cherry chocolate on the finish. There is a mild bitterness that retains for a while. The beer is thick and rich, and has a decent drinakbility. The sharp bitterness detracts just a little."
"One initial impression of this beer is: it's a one note beer. It is a coffee beer on steroids, and if you love good rich satisfying coffee (and beer), then it's one to be savored. If you don't, order something else. Pours were noire, with a lovely 1/4 inch coffee crema style head. Aroma was full of wonderful things like cocoa nibs, dark roastiness, raw beer. Sorta great European coffeehouse meets low earthiness. Taste for me was a total espresso experience, some astringency, dark roastiness, again cocoa nibs. The body stands up to this overwhelming taste experience. My only small complaint was that it was hard to find the beer in there. On the other hand, this is a one of a kind tasting experience which I'm glad I got to indulge in."
"As a coffee lover, this is truly amazing. A trip north of the border may be in order."
"$15.95 for the bottle is a bit extravagant though!"
"Wyll-"
"Pours a dark crimson black with a light tannish colored head, with large carbonation bubbles. Smells of sweet java, coffee beans, espresso, maybe some chocolate burried beneath all of the coffee aromas. Taste is pure coffee. There is a definite nutty background to the brew. You can almost literally taste the caffeine in this beer. This thing definitely packs two buzzs at once. The mouthfeel is a little thinner than I would prefer for a stout like this. Make this puppy a little creamier and I would lap it up all the time. A nicely drinkable stout, they didnt over do this one. The price definitely hurts. I could get a lot more breakfast stout for the same price. A worthwhile try definitely, especially if you are into coffee."
"This beer poured as black as the night and formed a huge dirty tan foamy head coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A good deal of carbonation is present. The aroma really smacks you over the head with expresso coffee, malt and a slight peanut odor. The flavor was of malt, coffee and chocolate. The body was creamy, but a bit on the thin side for the style. The warming aspect of the alcohol level is present in the slightly burnt coffee finish. A great beer, but at the current pricing, I would be hard pressed to have this on more than just a rare occasion."
"A good brew to quench your thirst after mowing the lawn this is most definitely NOT. ;-)"
"-a big thanks to nick at bauer for grabbing this one from the back for me."
"Nice roasted, almost burnt bitter finish."
"Also on taps the coffee flavours are more present compared to the one in bottle."
"Notes: This stuff is awesome! Why-oh-why can we not get this in the states. I really wish that Montreal would change it's laws so Jean-Francois Gravel can start filling growlers of this stuff to go, or better yet bottling it for export. This is really one of the best beers out there!"
"This was a great one, oh yes. I tried it at the Mondial de la Biere in Montreal, and at the Brew Pub as well, a few times. It's very very black, like espresso with a tan head of foam. It looks brutal. It smells like bitter strong coffee/espresso, not too much though. It tastes awesome, very roasted and strong and not as bitter as it looks and smells. Like a malty espresso. Mouthfeel was perfect, not as thick as it looks, but not even close to thin. No taste of alcohol either, which could be dangerous if you drink enough of it, but I probably wouldn't just because I can't drink too too much of such a roasty imperial stout like this one. However, I was so glad to have the glasses that I did, and I look forward to visiting DDC again to hopefully have this one again!"
"Jean-François Gravel and Dieu du Ciel should be proud of this magnificent creation and example of how infinitely diverse beer can beer."
"As Black as it gets. The nose is not so affirmative, but it smells coffee. Full mouthfeel which is very smooth and easy. Complex flavors which you can just admire: huge malt, rich coffee flavors, burnt chocolate milk is invented. Nicely balanced if you love desert beers. I'd like to compare with Alesmith's, but heaven is not that close."
"This is the way to do an imperial stout. Much better than Storm King and its fellows with their slimy hop oils that interrogate and sentence all the classic stout flavours."
"The finish lingered long, and pleasantly i might add. A wonderful dry, coffee finish. A perfect after dinner drink! To me, this is a true classic. High marks for amibitious creavtivity!"
