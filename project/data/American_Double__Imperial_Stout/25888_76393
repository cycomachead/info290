4.73,6.3,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Overall: I did like this one more than Huna, now after almost exactly a year the 2014 Huna I drank might have lost some impact, this bottle is not as old, they came out in (early November?) I believe so it has held its adjunct impact pretty well in that amount of time, now after a year in bottle like Huna I may be saying the same thing. I really need to revisit Huna as soon as I can to give it a more thorough analysis. So far, however, I still like the heat and earthiness of Bomb the best of the ones I have tried from this style. This is a close second. Love the cinnamon impact, goes really well with the combination of flavors they are working with.","humuloner22","Mar 18, 2015"

4.49,0.9,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"On draft at Chuck's 85th.  This is really an exceptional beer.  Pours murky dark with a tan, frothy head which dissipates quickly.  Aroma of vanilla caramel, cocoa, cinnamon, raisin, roasted malt.  Sweet on the tongue, some earthy notes, followed by some fire from the alcohol and peppers.  Very creamy, full-bodied, lightly carbonated, huge and long finish.  Truly a pleasure to drink.","PacNWDad","Dec 21, 2014"
4.54,2,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,"Earthy, toasted malts and bakers chocolate build the foundation, with sweeter malts on top of them, including molasses, cane sugar, syrup and a hint of dried dark berries. The uprising sweetness gets balanced by creamy milk chocolate, cocoa nibs, cinnamon and spicy, then peppery, burning, herbal chilies. The chocolate qualities get complimented by a noteable amount of bitter coffee, which got a dry note to it. The taste of this beer in general is extremely versatile, it begins silk and creamy, and while it remains throughout smooth, it gets quite a bit heat to it, resulting from the chilies, acting as a convincing counterpoint to the upwelling sweetness, while accentuating the earthy malts and pleasantly bitter coffee. Has a very long finish, beginning right after the chili bite, along with a coffeish bitterness and an earthy note, as well as a toffee glimpse, while the chili burn warms up the belly. Every single flavor is put outstandingly well into this brew, all components unfold on the palate in an enjoyable way, while none dominates the taste on its own.","aleigator","Dec 21, 2014"

Spices integrated perfectly. Just the right amount of heat from the peppers. Dreaming of the BBA version. Five stars out of five.","ronricorossi","Dec 19, 2014"

Bitter coffee and dark chocolate, black strap molasses, more chili pepper skin and a decent amount of cinnamon on the finish that makes it super dry. Very minimal, boarding on nonexistent chili heat. This is heads and shoulders better that the aged one I had. Drink fresh.  I would still go with MC > Huna > Abrax.  Much closer though.","Davepoolesque","Oct 20, 2014"

4.47,0.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Picked this up from a great trade with Evan! Bottled Nov 2013. An aggressive pour yields a beautiful pitch black body with a quickly fading one finger caramel-colored head with minimal lacing. Rich, roasty, complex nose with lots of cocoa up front along with hints of cinnamon, dark chocolate, vanilla, subtle coconut, and the chilies are surprisingly prevalent as well. The taste is big and rich and just as complex as the nose. Loads of roasty cocoa and cinnamon up front with the chilies not far behind. Hints of chocolate fudge, coconut, vanilla, tobacco, and espresso. The mouthfeel is rich and flavorful, thick and creamy, with perfect carbonation and excellent balance. Overall, this was a hugely enjoyable beer and not far behind the barrel-aged version. The cinnamon, cocoa, and chilies were bold, yet equally represented and this was extremely drinkable for a 10% ABV beer. Highly recommended!","beerdrifter","Jun 14, 2014"

Sweet, slightly spicy, reminds me a bit of autumn. A bit bitter mostly from chocolate and possibly from hops, residual and up front. Finishes smooth almost like sweet chocolate milk. Cannot wait to try this again, hopefully even a barrel aged variant.","friendofbeer","Jun 03, 2014"

Aroma of massive chocolates, a hint of spicy pepper, and a bit of cinnamon. Really nice. Flavor is super sweet chocolate, light roast, a bit of cinnamon dryness, with a lingering dry cocoa powder and light chile flavor left on the palate. The heat picks up a tad as I sip and the cinnamon definitely comes out as it warms. Thick bodied with low carbonation, but not as thick as I was expecting after watching the pour. Pretty good stuff with both sweet chocolate and bitter roast shining through here. Hoping to find the BA version someday.","BMMillsy","Apr 12, 2014"

Vanilla and chocolate are there as well, but in the background a bit. Really nice flavor, with cinnamon leading the way. Rich, roasted malt with hints of coffee. Thick body with a delicate sweetness throughout. While Hunahpu's still reigns supreme, in my opinion, Abraxas is certainly a delicious and well crafted beer well worth seeking out.","Huhzubendah","Apr 01, 2014"

Aroma is cinnamon and the slightest hint of pepper. Flavor seemed heavier on the cinnamon with discernible vanilla, not much pepper on the flavor.

While a lot of other breweries try to spice their imperial stouts with different things, it either A: doesn't work, or B:gets lost behind the chocolate and coffee tastes that are normally prevalent in imperial stouts, or C: is overpowering with one individual spice. But this beer does not fall into those categories. It is complex yet enjoyable. The ancho chili peppers, cinnamon sticks, and cacao nibs are very prevalent but enjoyable.

4.13,-7.2,4,4,4.25,4.25,4,"Poured a dark brown, almost black body with one finger dark brown head (so I guess the body is black since I differentiate) that left lace patches and had an aroma of sweetness like chocolate and toffee, maybe caramel, hint of cinnamon, and some roasted, bready malts as well as coffee and chile (although I may pick these up more b/c others say they are in there than on my own without prior knowledge). A thick, almost chewey body that is sticky at times but so easy to drink and so calling for me to drink it. Great balance as I get a lot of chocolate and touches of cinnamon (and I still think toffee or caramel) with a very dry, coffee-esque malt base. Picks up on the end with a little heat so I'm assuming both the alcohol and chile are coming in and thankfully not overpowering me at all. A very enjoyable sipper and another great beer from Perennial.","clayrock81","Jan 17, 2014"

The cinnamon shines and the ancho just kicks in right behind it. It never gets spicy though. This beer tastes like an incredible Mexican hot chocolate. The mouthfeel is in perfect harmony with this beer. Thick but not even close to motor oil consistency. It has a nice chew to it to complement all of the flavors that mesh so well together.

I would definitely recommend drinking this at closer to cellar or room temperature rather than chilled. The chili peppers are there in a slightly vegetal manner, with some spiciness on the back end- not a lot like Mexican Cake, but just enough to complement the base imperial stout and the cinnamon. This is easily my favorite Mexican style stout by far, having had Hunahpu and Mexican Cake already. And I will definitely attest to the fact that BA Abraxas is just that much better- just add in a lot of vanilla bourbon marshmallows to this and that's what you got.","Stevedore","Dec 02, 2013"

The nose is marshmallow-vanilla, chilies, and some bitter cocoa on the back end. It's not potently aromatic, but all the different notes come through in time. The taste is sweet and marshmallowy upfront, but there is much more distinct cocoa compared to the nose. It's full bodied, lightly carbonated, has rich and distinct flavors, masked alcohol, and a slight heat from the chilies in the finish. This is a fantastic stout, with a rich, full body, bold adjuncts, and seductive drinkability","ThePorterSorter","Sep 30, 2013"

The nose comprises earthy peppers, cocoa, roasted malts, and apple cider spices. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some brown sugar and cinnamon and a healthier roast. The peppers provide a steadily increasing, though always mild, heat in the back of the throat. Basically things boil down to this: cocoa-centric mole goodness! The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a damn fine pepper stout, easily superior to the ever-vaunted Hunahpu.","TMoney2591","Feb 15, 2013"

The taste is complex. I like to think of the taste of this beer like going to a Yonder Mountain String Band concert. The band plays together beautifully, but when each band member has a chance to solo you can really hear each component. The same is true for Abraxas. A taste of Abraxas develops in stages. At first it is a chocolate but as it warms up you experience more vanilla/espresso taste, but cold/warm it finishes with a chili spice and cinnamon perfection.","T-Leb","Jan 21, 2013"

Aroma is heavy on dark bitter chocolate, cacao, licorice, molasses, and roasted malts. A touch of pepper is present on the nose in the background. The taste is incredibly dry and full of cacao. This features that raw chocolate flavor which makes for a very robust and deep flavor. This pairs nicely with the thick stout base. Notes of licorice and cinnamon come through in the middle and cayenne makes an appearance at the end. The heat is minimal and builds slowly as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is thick and sturdy with moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a tasty, full flavored, and rich beer. Definitely worth a try.

4.43,-0.4,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.25,"Wedding tick: New tick #1 for the week. This beer pours a full bodied midnight black in color with a beautiful, creamy dark mocha head. It looks perfect! The nose is rich and malty. There is a lot of cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg spice in the nose with dark chocolate, bitter coffee roast, and slight fresh, green (in terms of maturity) pepper. The nose changes as time goes on, making this one very complex and more enjoyable as you proceed. The flavors are big and full of bitter dark chocolate and coffee roast. There is also plenty of spice presence, cinnamon and nutmeg. There is also some freshly cut pepper in the finish but it is somewhat subdued (on purpose I would imagine, to satisfy more people). It has nice flavor and all of the ingredients work in unison. It drinks full in body and coats your palate. It's a nice beer and well worth the $19 or so per bottle. This is the closest thing I've seen to Hunahpu yet and perhaps better than current batches.","aasher","Jun 16, 2012"
4.28,-3.8,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Coming from Tampa, FL, the land of Hunahpu, it'll be interesting to see another brewery's taste on the formula. This beer pours out deep black with two fingers of thick, mocha head. The aroma is more heavy on the cinnamon and chocolate than the roast, with a surprising amount of smoked character to it as well. Some of this might come from the Ancho chilis, which don't have a high level of heat, but plenty of spicy flavor. The taste is pretty heavily spiced with the cinnamon and the flavors of the chili. The chili really dominates this beer without contributing much heat at all. There's some roast, coffee, and vanilla in here for sure too, especially in the beginning. The mouthfeel isn't really that heavy, and it goes down fairly slickly. Some more heft on the body wouldn't hurt, but the heavy chili flavor excuses some of it. The drinkability is actually quite good. Overall, it's a good chili imperial stout. Come in expecting chili flavors without the heat, and you'll be happy.","shand","May 30, 2012"
