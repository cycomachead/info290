"easiest drinking 9% I've ever tried. Less spice than I thought it would have, but very tasty."
"Not Xocoveza but pretty good!!"
"The label was better than the beer."

"Tastes decent but leaves a strange aftertaste that I'm not too fond of. Can't really taste the chili pepper, at least not in a way that I was expecting to. It's okay, but I was a little underwhelmed and disappointed, especially considering they're the company that brought me Undead Party Crasher, one of my favorite stouts."
"If you liked the Stone Xocoveza Mocha Stout, you will enjoy this. Good balance of spice and chocolate taste mixed in."

""
""
"Overall - A stout that has a good base but lacks in the flavour. The chilies are lost in translation and the flavours seem watered down to me. Some modifications need to  be made to make this more true to the style."
""
""
""
"Nice color but, didn't care for the taste.  Seemed a little watered down."
""
"Look: very dark brown, thin head that disappears quickly. Smell: creme brulee, faint coco. Not a big aroma on it. But what is there is nice. Taste: bitter chocolate, vanilla , a very subtle Chile taste but not spicey. Dark cherry.  Pretty sweet but not cloying.  Feel: is smooth, lasting carbonation. Overall: this is really good, a excellant chocolate stout but none of the Mexican qualities stand out which is a bummer."
"Doesn't  compete with the other beers in this style. Lacks chili peppers and spices. Too much chocolate."
""
""
"Ultra smooth but the flavors don't come out. Maybe if it was a bit colder but a true stout shines as it nears room temperature."
""
"Pours black with a finger thick dark tan head. Smells of dark chocolate, damp cloth, mocha, and dark roast malts. Tastes of milk chocolate, vanilla, some pepper spice, I don't pick up the cinnamon but I might be masked a bit with the pepper. I expected it to be a bit more bold for a spiced stout. Otherwise pretty tasty. Medium body and light carbonation. Chocolate and vanilla aftertaste."
"Yes, from where I sit."
""
"The roastiness and vanilla bean reveal themselves in the finish, which tapers off slowly and lovingly. It's got moderate body and pleasantly warms as it goes down. Overall, this is a very creative and special beer, for stout fanatics and also for the average person who likes a beer to taste like a real treat. Glorious indeed!"
""
"Very different from Undead Party Crasher, more chocolatey and less sweet. Lots of toasted malt gives a slight ashy note. Very good but I would only drink this one occasionally."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours black with a lace of head. Nice aromas of chocolate malts not too sweet. Taste is very complex. Starts off smooth and chocolate, then goes down with hints of roasted malts and bitterness. The 9% alcohol is very hidden here. Very good imperial chocolate stout, recommended."
"I was very on the fence about this beer the first few sips.The more it warmed up, the more I warmed up to it. I really picked up on the ancho chili....that gave it a unique smack. Oddly attractive......but don't write home."
""
""
""
""
"O- the base chocolate stout is good, but it was hard to pick out the rest of the adjunct ingredients, was hoping for at least a bit of chili heat on the flavor"
""
""
""
""
"Not as ""chocolatey"" as I was led to believe. Maybe they should change the name."
""
"An awesome beer - just as a chocolate stout should taste!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It is an average stout, but below average for a chocolate stout. If you're looking for a chocolate stout I would give this one a pass. If you're looking for a higher ABV stout I would say flip a coin."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"

"Excellent beer.  Chocolate was pronounced, but the cinnamon could be found on the back side.  Very good beer.  Excellent qualities."
""
""
""
""
""
"Wasn't super chocolate! I have had better but way better then shock top! Tasted like beer still!"
"Chocolate Sombrero brewed by Clown Shoes, with an ABV 9.00%  This brew pours out a dark brown color, with a light brown head. Looks like coffee or cola. The smell is sweet with  Chocolate. You also pick up on grains, malts and hops. The taste is bold with flavor. You pick up on a hops and the chocolate.  There is a mild bitterness in the taste of this brew.  You do not pick up on the high ABV in this brew, not saying that is a bad thing. The mouthfeel is bitter sweet. This Clown Shoes, brew has a nice smoothness to it. There is a lot going on in this brew, but it has a nice balance to it.  There is nothing overpowering in this brew.  Overall I'm giving  Chocolate Sombrero a a 4.25 out of 5. I would buy this brew again."
""
"  Overall, I'll give Chocolate Sombrero - Clown Shoes a  4.25. For a brewer that makes loads of IPA's , Clown Shoes delivered with this offering. Me gustsa el Sombrero de los Chocolate!"
""
""
"Dark, coffee-like appearance. Thin lace. Rich, malty, and spicy scent. Nice, full malts and chile up front. Semi-sweet chocolate and malt gives way to a nice, mildly bitter and spicy finish that holds. Nicely done. I would recommend as a unique chocolate stout. The chiles really excel in this beer."
"Not too much lacing and a tad thin although the beer does go down velvety smooth. Loads of Chocolate, malt, a touch of vanilla been, and backing of char/smoke......wish the chile was more pronounced as I find it only faintly coming out in the char finish."
""
""
"The taste is full of semi-sweet chocolate goodness that ends with an abrupt but highly enjoyable pepper and bitter sensation."
""
"Wish the vanilla were less pronounced and the acrid character didn't exist. Fruity specialty malt and phenolic notes also become evident and clash. Body is lighter than it should be. I held out a lot of hope for this beer, and it's slightly disappointing."
""
""
"Overall, good stuff."
""
""
""
"Good but not great. Year-old bottle, though, from a trade."
"Was hoping for a little more complexity based on the ingredients.  Very mild chili taste almost non-existent."

"A slightly above average imperial stout that delivers the expected flavors of dark chocolate, light cocoa, Bosco chocolate syrup, roasted malt, and cream.  I was expecting the chocolate to overpower the roastiness but that was not the case.  Worth a try, but I have other favorites in the style."
""
""
"Full bodied, smooth and creamy with aa hint of drying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I wanted to enjoy this more, but I'm afraid the advertised spices and flavors are not pulling through enough for me. Not horrible per se, but it is definitely not a repeat purchase for me."
""
""
"O: good brew, was expecting more chile spice"
""
""
"Overall, a beer that I have wanted for some time and while it is not disappointing, it's not quite what I expected.  Lacking is the chili flavor and not quite enough chocolate.  Wanted a little bit more.  Still this is an easy drinking beer and there is only a small semblance of the 9% abv.  Worth a try though."
"I've tried many stouts and porters and I believe I found the one. This beer doesn't give any bursting scents for the nose but let me tell you it's worth it! What you smell will not determine how this beer is. The first sip it blasts you with flavors: chocolate, coffee, vanilla, a little fruity taste. I didn't pick up on the spice so much because I myself can tolerate spicy stuff. The mouth feel is silky and full I like it a lot. Overall this beer is a must try if you can get your hands on it."
""
"O - This was really great.  Lots of great flavors and an incredible mouthfeel."
"Color is black with a tan head.  Produces pretty much no head even on a aggressive pour.  Aroma has lots of roasted malt and sweet chocolate.  The taste has roasted malts upfront followed by vanilla and sweet chocolate in the middle.  Very mild cinnamon and pepper show up in the finish with roasted malt for a somewhat bitter finish.  Full bodied, creamy texture to this, no booze at 9%, and very little carbonation.  Overall, a very well balanced stout with the roastiness/pepper/cinnamon evenly matched with chocolate/vanilla flavors.  Only complaint is I wish the peppers were more prominent, but this is still a great, flavorful stout at a great price too."
""
""
"2013 vintage.  Pitch black pour with a nice two finger caramel-colored head with good retention and great lacing.  Roasty, chocolaty nose with hints of cinnamon, cocoa, licorice, espresso, and vanilla.  The taste follows suit with big roasty chocolate fudge notes with hints of cinnamon, espresso, cocoa, licorice, and as it warms, the chilies finally emerge but don't overpower.  The mouthfeel is maybe a little thin for a stout, with a mouth-coating finish and a subtle burn from the chilies.  Overall, this is a really flavorful and extremely drinkable chocolate stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I don't think I will get this again I like my stouts sweet and this one is peppery, skunky, and bitter with overbearing roasts. Curious to see what age would do to this but frankly I really don't care. Pass"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with khaki colored head. Spice, chocolate, and roasted malt on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with spice and sweetness."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Chocolate Sombrero pours a black color with a small lacing head.  There is a big roasted aroma with big hints of vanilla.  The taste is roasted, noticeable vanilla notes, the smallest hint of chili peppers.  Good flavors, comes together nicely, but very flat body.  Overall its very tasty, easy to drink, but flat."
""
""
""
""
"O:  Easy drinking and tasty stout.  I wish the spices were more prominent but this is one I would grab again."
""
"O: I love this beer....period. If you find it, buy it, then drink it. You'll enjoy it. Or you won't. Either way,  you'll agree it's a freakin' trip.....and one worth taking (at least once)."
"Overall a beer I find interesting and very drinkable.   I love all the chocolate notes...not bitter dark cocoa and not sweet rich milk chocolate.....kind of in between..."

"Overall: This rules. The goofy cartoon on the label made me balk a bit, but this is a top-notch chocolate stout. Get into it."

"Lacking the depth of an Imperial Stout in exchange for the chile and cinnamon spiciness."

"Mouthfeel: Rich velvety chocolate stout with a touch of chile pepper sting on the finish and lasting down the back of your throat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A lot of roasted malt in this one with considerable amount of char. There are hints of chocolate, coffee intermingling with a smooth creamy feeling vanilla. I didn't notice any pepper any where."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Veg. and spice add some nice layers of flavor but the underlying stout isn't anything exceptional.  Still tasty though.  Great value at a $9 4-pack."
""
"Clown Shoes Chocolate Sombrero pours a dark color almost black. It has a dark tan head  and leaves nice lacing around the glass. the aroma is of chocolate and coffee. It has a slight scent of chili pepper and vanilla. The flavor is chocolaty with some coffee.  The vanilla and the Ancho chili is subtle.  There is no heat to the pepper in the beer. The mouthfeel is smooth and fairly creamy. Overall a good stout."

"O - Punchy and tasty.  Perhaps a bit blunt, but rich enough to be enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown with a khaki head that laces the glass. The smell is full of all kinds of flavors such as the vanilla and chocolate which is full force, but also some coffee scents and a little bit of pepper. The taste was heavily layered with a lot of great flavors. The spice was an interesting tingle instead of being too hot, and it melded well with the chocolate and other heavy flavors to give the beer a nice personality. Liked this one a lot."
"Overall - Really good. A bit more spice would've been nice, because it's fairly buried and therefore doesn't quite deliver on the promise of the label. Regardless, this is a nice, easy drinking Impy Stout with loads of chocolate. Unfortunately for the price, I'm probably one and done. I expect more out of a $10 bomber."

"This was a big want, and I have been holding off o the $12-13 bomber. Glad to find a $3 12 ounce to share with the wife. Split into 2 stemless wineglasses. Poured a deep, dark, dank brown no head to speak of (expected though). Aromas of roasted coffee, chocolate, deep malty goodness, and a hint of chile (which became more pronounced as the warming progressed). Nice roasted malt on the palate, hint of chocolate... things were a bit muddled together... and some mild chile on the aftertaste (again picking up some steam, and a bit of the promised cinnamon, as the glass warmed up). Slightly watery mouthfeel for a big 9% stout, but a good aftertaste. Nothing exceptional, but it was good. I definitely have more preferred go-to stouts... however, I am glad I tried this if only for the exceptional label on the bottle, and creativity of Clown Shoes."

"Very good, but lacking a bit of depth and body."
""
""
""
""
""
"Chocolate Sombrero succeeds in its simplicity. Soft, light feel with nearly identical aroma and flavor. This is disguised as a mocha stout with charred malt and lactose properties. Dry chocolate, cinnamon and an ancho chile kick it's an enjoyable and easy drinking ride."
""
""
"Overall (3.75), this is a fine beer in its own right, but I can't help but be a bit disappointed by the failure to deliver on the spiced portion of this stout. The cinnamon was all but nonexistent and the vanilla was barely detectible, making it a decent, but not particularly remarkable chocolate stout. I'd drink it again if it were readily available in my area, but as it stands I have to get all my Clown Shoes through the mail, so I'm not likely to drink this one again."
""

""

""
""
""
""

"Near black appearance with a beige cap. Chocolate, roast, laugh spice aroma. Chocolate dominates the flavor. Chili heat is mild. A touch of vanilla, cacao, distant coffee. Sweetness throughout, perhaps a little much. This was ok, but could certainly stand a few improvements."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is very good; I think what keeps it from the upper echelons is the timidity of the peppers (not looking to get destroyed, but a little more) as well as vanilla not quite putting itself out there.  A little more teamwork and it's up there with the best."
"Would try again in a 6 pack but I have only seen bombers."

"I got to say that this is a great stout.Nice chocolate taste and at  9.0 abv you have to try it.Looked at the ratings and i have to say i think it`s a bit low.Not much of a head but the smell is a fantastic chocolate.I love what this beer did for me.Shitting out on the porch listening to led zeppelin and i really liked what i was tasting.Give this a try and you will not be disappointed.Would i drink this again.Yes and again and again."

"Bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pitch black brew, no colored halo with a decent sized tan head, about 2-3 inches tall. Aroma is roasted yet quite sweet, chocolate sauce, light roast coffee, ample vanilla bean, mellow brown spice, and a hint of earthy hops. Palate is similarly sweet, spicy, and earthy, chocolate cake, coffee, cola, and strong vanilla with a slight bell pepper fruitiness, dried raisins and currants, wood char, black licorice, caramel, and a noticeably (for the style) assertive hop bite in the finish. Quite thick and the carbonation is on the low side, although something in the brew prevents things from being disturbingly sweet and syrupy even if this is on the sweet side for my liking. Quite smooth on the palate. Very slight detectable spicy heat either from the chillies or the hops (probably the former). Alcohol is very well-concealed. A rather solid dessert beer that doesn't taste gimmicky."
""
""
""
"Overall: Would drink again. Wish this one was a little spicier but it’s certainly fun."

"Pours a nice dark brown black with a decent head that dissipates quickly. Smells ok and tastes like a typical dark stout. Can't detect much chocolate, ancho chiles or cinammon at all. Slightly sweet at the end. Goes down well but I am not that impressed for a beer that touts all these different ingredients, it has a very generic taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very drinkable well-made stout containing chilies. The chili and cinnamon compliment the chocolate, with the ancho chilies being mild enough to taste without burning my taste buds out. I’ll definitely buy this again."
""
""
""
""
"Disjointed (I'm certain that I've used this word in relation to this brewery of late - just sayin'), engaging, furtive, and frustrating - those are the associations I have with this offering. More specifically - chocolate, chili spice, vegetation, bread, and in the end, sweet alcohol. Curtains for that wack Mexican clown wrestler, and curtains for me."

"Achieved a rich, tan two finger head that dissipates quickly. Nose is bitter coffee, dark chocolate, tobacco, and roasted malt. First taste strikes me as very complex and not necessarily in a good way. The tastes of cinnamon, dark chocolate, and bitter roastyness are all there, but they run together to give a cardboard-like taste and there's really no order to what's going on. The aftertaste is lingering and by far the highlight of the beer for me, this is where the BS goes away and a nice lingering bitter chocolate dominates. Nice mouthfeel, just a little carbonation which is good. Not a stellar offering from Clown Shoes. To be fair as the beer warmed it was considerably more palatable and at room temperature was not unlike chocolate milk."

"this beer is pretty sloppy, i dont think all the interesting flavors are particularly well integrated or balanced, but the base stout is quite large and tasty, i just dont think it needed all they did to it here. comes across confused. dark as night, thick and viscous, heady too. the nose is a weird mix of dry and sweet dark chocolate, as well as cinnamon spice and chili pepper, all very muddled. the complexity and richness of the base stout is lost with all these additives i think. chocolate is robust in the flavor all the way through, and the peppers come out mostly just in the finish. they arent super hot, but there is a warming sensation for sure. combined with the hotly alcoholic thickness of this beer, its tough to drink very much of. maybe something to try again in colder weather, but the promise of something interesting and unique here gave way to a lackluster brew bogged down by mediocre use of strange ingredients. not worth what they ask for it."

"The taste is another winner for Clown shoes, love it the colder the better this is a nice Sunday sipper."
""
""
"Pours out to a deep walnut, near black, forming a modest light tan head with good retention and lacing. Carbonation is moderate. The nose is of black walnut, cinnamon, vanilla, carob, and strawberries. The mouthfeel is slick, mildly acidic, and full bodied. The taste is a recap of the aroma. The strawberry is an interesting note. A touch of soy sauce. The cinnamon is rather subdued, as is the chili. Not much heat...very very mild. There is subtle oxidation towards the finish. Overall on the sweeter side. Bitterness is very very mild, as is the roast character."

"Poured from 650 ml bomber into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted on 8/24/2013."
""
""
""
""
"This is a tasty beer, but it doesn't seem to hit any of the wickets I really anticipated and wanted. It's both thin and too fruity for a stout, and the chiles are too much in the background. That said, it's still a good beer, and worth trying out if you can get it at a decent price."

"Poured nice and dark into a snifter with a half-finger, dark tan head. Not the most impressive smelling stout I've ever had, but I feel like the ancho chile is lingering there somewhere. Taste is all right. Maybe I just prefer my stouts to be a bit more chocolatey or coffee-ey. This one is pretty solid, though. I do get a spicy bite at the back end, which is cool."

"On paper I was expecting something pretty great with the cinnamon, chile and especially vanilla extract in this chocolate heavy stout but the dark malts are overpowering and the beer just lies there, flat on the palate. The upside is that Clown Shoes is constantly evolving and tweaking so I'm sure this will get even better in subsequent years."
""
""
"Overall - a very well-done spin of an American Double. Fireside beer for sure. A fine beer to toast the Kentucky Wildcats and the Uconn Huskies on their championship run. No dog in the hunt either way but an excellent game, men. Cheers!"
""
"3.75 D: Pretty good beer overall. I wish the chiles and spices played a bigger role in this, but it's good enough to try once."
""
""
""
""
"Light black in color and somewhat penetrate lee to light. Just a trace of light brown foam covers a small part of the top of the beer. Brussels lacing. I get chocolate,roasted barley,and cinnamon in the nose. The mouth is silky smooth and viscous. I get roasted barley, cinnamon,and fig throughout the palate. This is a very sweet finish after a bitter start."

""
"This is an all around solid beer and a nice easy to get example for a style that generally is hard to get and comes at a huge price point. On a blind tasting I have no doubt this would fall underneath Huna, Mexican Cake, and Abraxas, but I don't think the gap is as wide as one might think. Check this out for sure if you are a fan of the style."
""
""
"Overall: this is one of those fantastic top-end beers that one has only every so often. A great chocolate stout that's well worth the expense. At approx AU$20 a bottle, I won't be able to afford this all too often, but I'll definitely have to make it as regular as possible."

"A pretty good stout, nice flavor and great body. The chile is just there enough to add some spice but doesn't really come through in the flavor. Enjoyable and worth trying."

"Deep brown to black in color. Poured with a thick, dark beige foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap. Sweet, powdery chocolate malt aromas are dominant with roasted malts in tow. Vanilla and ground cinnamon aromas in the background with funky roasted hot pepper expanding as this warmed. Nice complexity in the aroma. Full bodied with rich carbonation and a chewy feel up front and a tangy bite in the middle. Chocolate and roasted malt flavors up front followed by hop bitterness into the middle. Hop bitterness transitions to tangy, hot chili presence to the end. Finished with roasted malt aftertaste along with hop bitterness and a touch chili heat. An interesting variety of aromas and flavors that work very well together. Thoroughly enjoyed this."

"TL;DR: A very enjoyable Imperial Stout that hides its alcohol well and presents a nice flavor, but the description of the beer had me expecting something completely different."
""
"Chocolate Sombrero is more interesting on paper than it is in the glass, but I don't mean to rein on it too much - it's a nice stout in its own right. I, personally, wish the spices were a little more forward - I bought it for that reason - but their subtlety plays more into mainstream palates. This may be the first (only?) chili-infused Imperial Stout to be agreeable to just about anyone."

"This is the first time I've had one of these mole-inspired ``Mexican Stouts'' and the flavor is really nice. I've had (and enjoyed) Chocolate Oak-Aged Yeti, but the little hints of vanilla and cinnamon enhance the flavor really nicely. I'd like for this flavor combination to catch on and for more brewers to experiment with this style. It offers a new kind of complexity that I'd definitely like to explore more of."
"Poured a blackish body with one finger tan head that left some lacing on top of a mostly roasted and chocolately, plus a little vanilla, aroma and hints of said chili notes. Smooth, dry, slightly chewey, the chilis don't do much as this beer isn't really heated or anything. Just easy going with good roasted and chocolately tastes notes (little bit of vanilla sweetness). Simple beer but realy enjoyable."
""
""
"o: quite good. i really like the mixture and balance of the sweet, bitter, and spicy in here. all the flavors play well off each other, and the spice doesn't ruin any of the other stout flavors - rather it enhances the experience."
""
"Taste-Dark roasted malt,chocolate, cinnamon, very subtle ancho chile. Very smooth for the high ABV. Flavor left me wanting more ancho chilies in the mix. Double the dose would bring more more flavor and a little more heat without overpowering the balance, in my opinion.Still, a fine brew."
"Yep!"
"I like this quite a bit. Nice texture, good flavor, good balance. Wouldn't mind a bit more chile heat. Not a trace of heat from the 9% ABV!"

"O-I've had worse but this is probably the least impressive beer I have had in a while. I feel like it tries to be many different styles of stout at once but ultimately is just weird and not that good."
"This is a nice stout, but I would've liked to pick up more cinnamon and chili peppers. They deliver on the chocolate though. It's ultimately enjoyable. Good stuff."

"Third beer from Clown Shoes, and they have all been stouts and they have all been great! They truly are masters of the style. Another solid one here, but not as far off the beaten path as I was expecting. It is a solid stout but I had a hard time pulling out the ancho chiles and cinnamon that they were claiming on the label. There is lots of vanilla and chocolate and the right amount of sweetness. Body is good, color is good. All around terrific, just wish it had more robust spice."

"Midnight oil is burning as we speak, I'm working hard on drinking this high quality Mexican American hybrid, it's a beautiful beer that more folks need to get to know! An intimate combination of black patent, chocolate malts with mole' esque experience serving the vanilla/cinnamon/ancho chile experience in a glass. This beer is new to Ohio and Pittsburgh markets, I'm blessed to have options of good beer. These Clown Shoes folks are dark beer specialists, thus far if it's dark and it's from Ipswich, MA the beer can do no wrong for me. Dark bountiful body with a tan head forming froth fully above the rim of my chalice, leaving behind layered intricate lacing patterns. Aromatics offer up dark chocolate notes, hints of vanilla and smoked chiles, cinnamon spice combo that works so well together. Flavors bring the dark chocolate and adjuncts together to form somewhat of a liquid mole' suauce, I'm in love. Mouthfeel is amazing silky smooth even flowing carbonation big medium to full bodied perfect finish. Overall buy this beer and share it with good beer drinking friends and admire the beauty!!!"
"Overall - This is pretty good, a nice spin on a stout for sure. Its actually balanced well, not too malty, not too sweet or too hot. Might be my favorite clown shoes so far. Very easy to drink, drinks closer to a American stout then a ris. Good stuff, worth a drink."

"Unique and pretty tasty. Worthy of a try but not one to seek out."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and a good example of the style, it does a good job of showcasing the added complexity that some of these Mexican styled stouts have with none of the aspects being too overpowering. It was very chocolaty and the spices and peppers took a back seat. This beer had decent drinkability, it was fairly smooth, creamy, a little filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention but I couldn't see myself wanting anymore after drinking a bomber of this and I think it's a nice bottle to share. I liked how chocolaty this beer was the most. What I liked the least about this beer was how light the spice and pepper flavor and aromas were, I think this beer could have handled more of both. I might get this again when I want a very chocolaty beer, but I think if I'm in the mood for a Mexican style Stout I'll grab Mayan Mocha Stout instead. I would recommend this to anybody who likes this style of beer. All in all I thought this was a pretty nice beer, it wasn't as unique as I thought it would be but it still turned out to be pretty nice. When comparing this to Mayan Mocha Stout I prefer the chocolate and malt base of this beer, but I think Mayan Mocha Stout does a better job at showcasing the spices and peppers, so overall I think I prefer Mayan Mocha Stout. Good job clown shoes, this was a nice beer and I appreciate the effort, Keep up the good work."
"O - It is an enjoyable stout. I was hoping for some chile spice, but it was still a good experience. Maybe I need a fresher bottle next time."
""
""
""
"Overall- Well, the name sounds like something you'd look up on urbandictionary, and it comes off as a little boozy, but for a choco-holic's brew it's not bad. Certainly better than 90% of the chocolate stouts out there, but really, really suffers in the style and drinkability departments. Actually, I'm considering snagging another of these to sit for a few months- I've got a feeling it'd be spectacular. As it is, though, it's worth trying but not worth revisiting."

"Flavor and Aroma: rich with ample dark chocolate. Starts mildly sweet but ends mildly bitter. High ABV is partly evident in both the taste and feel."

"Medium bodied but not as thick/viscous as expected with a prominent spicy chili pepper presence up front that lingers over the roast and sweeter malt notes into a dry finish. Unfortunately, it's not as complex as the nose suggests, but the chili presence is more prominent with lingering spicy heat. Cinnamon and peppery spice compliment the ancho chilies and adds another layer of flavor to the already complex malt bill. There's a nice roasted malt character providing some dry bitterness but its not acrid or over the top. Hints of burnt toast, oatmeal, robust coffee/espresso bean and bittersweet chocolate. Again, I'm not getting much vanilla. It must be pretty faded at this point but there is plenty of dessert like chocolate malt sweetness to balance things out. Silky milk chocolate with lactose and baker's chocolate rounding things out in the finish. The high ABV is very well masked with little to no alcohol flavor, huts some warmth in the chest. Overall, this is a really solid beer. I'm not a big fan of Clown Shoes but they did a really good job with this beer. Complex and easy to drink with great flavor. Recommended."

"Got in a trade with icetrauma. 22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 10/22/2012. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, coffee, vanilla, dark bread, light cinnamon/chile, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roasted and chocolate, notes; with good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, vanilla, dark bread, light coffee, light cinnamon/chile, and roasted earthiness. Slight touch of chile heat on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, vanilla, dark bread, light coffee, light cinnamon, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of roasted/dark malt and vanilla flavors; cinnamon/chile notes must have diminished over age. Great flavor robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and moderately slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial stout. All around good balance and complexity of roasted/dark malt and vanilla flavors; and very smooth to sip on. May have to pick up a fresh bottle to see if the chile/cinnamon is more pronounced; but it was still very enjoyable offering otherwise."

"Hmm... Well, color me a little bit impressed. Good balance of flavors, and Chocolate Sombrero abides by the one (personal) rule I have when it comes to chile beers: do not overuse the chile peppers! Though the mouth feel can't compare to some of the big name stouts out there, it's nice to know that I can tide over my Mexican Cake and Hunahpu's cravings with a bomber of this stuff from my local store."

"This seems like a good companion to my spicy pork sandwich... It pours a straight onyx topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, cocoa, cinnamon, brown sugar, and a hint of vanilla bean. The taste brings in more of the same, though here the spices take a back seat to the stronger contingents of cocoa and roast. There ain't any peppers to be seen, though... The body is a hefty-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a very nice spiced stout, but the lack of any chile character leaves me wanting a bit. Still, good times."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very drinkable imperial stout which I would certainly recommend to anyone who likes the style; but its flavors weren't nearly as unusual/interesting as I had hoped they would be."
""
""
""
"Overall I think Clown Shoes does some great beers and this is another one. Really love the chiles in this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: would recommend if it's available. Picked her up at a local beverage warehouse for 3 bucks and change. A nice, rich stout when enjoyed at an appropriate age. The rich cocoa is really the feature of this beer while chiles and vanilla sing in the background."
""
""
""
"super tasty stuff"
""
"O: In total other then the smell and the sort of lacking feel this is a pretty impressive beer. The taste is well balanced with a whole bunch of different flavors. Its like a super ultra baby version of hunapu's but its definitely worth a try I recommend it."
""
"I was really surprised by this one. Despite the age, this one is really delicious. If you like dark chocolate and a bitter roastiness, this beer is for you. Very enjoyable."
""
"Rich cocoa and dark chocolate flavors. The swallow has a nice spicy hop along with some warming alcohol bite. The body is rich with an elevated level of carbonation. Not very sweet. An easy-to-drink stout. Taste-wise, it's hard to believe its an Imperial styled one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I did not enjoy the harsh bite up front. I liked the silky chocolate and vanilla taste and feel in the middle and the hint of heat from the pepper at the end. Good beer, will drink again, but what I assume is a harshness from the alcohol up front leaves it wanting a bit in my estimation."
""
"Overall, there are some good notes in here, and they’re nicely balanced and flavorful, but what the beer ultimately needed was simply a bit more oomph from the sugars, the medium-range 9% ABV simply not enough to create the full mouthfeel and flavor power of a good-quality stout. The ancho chilies were, however, an excellent choice, and very nicely play off of the chocolates and dark breads."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown-black with garnet translucence around the edges. Mocha brown foam persists and leaves curtains of lace. Smell is roasted malt, cinnamon, figs and chocolate. Tastes of cocoa powder, green chilies, roast malt, lightly sour dark cherries, fig newtons, and just a trace of cinnamon. Mouthfeel is slick and velvety with a medium heft. Carbonation is just right. Pretty decent. It's not spicy, the chilies have no heat. The first couple of swallows I wasn't super impressed, however this one has grown on me. Another well made stout from Clown Shoes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Opens on a roasted malt note, then progresses to a drying ancho flavor mixed with bittersweet chocolate. The finish is just a touch watery and brings a touch of milk chocolate and cinnamon. The flavors are good, but the mouthfeel is just a bit too light for me. Still a solid beer."
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty tasty beer."
""
""
"O: If you really like dark chocolate malts, this is a nice stout that is 't too bitter or toasty. The chili peppers are very subtle and are only noticeable in the finish."
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, and cinnamon. Taste is much the same a cocoa flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness and chile heat on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some interesting aromas and flavors."
""
"Overall-- I like this beer-- I'd rate it ""third"" in Clown Shoes RIS line-up of RIS beers. Don't let them trick you-- where they got the idea of ""Sombrero"" is still a mystery (to me)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very deep brown with some amber color along the edges. Not too much carbonation, and the 1/2, dark-tan head quickly goes down to a thin layer. Sweet smell - for me, lots of vanilla and malt, no chocolate whatsoever; some booze on the nose, which is kind of expected but becomes too noticeable as it warms. Very sweet-tasting; again, more vanilla than chocolate, some banana, and there's a slight sourness in the aftertaste that I associate with vanilla extract. I am not sure what makes this beer a ""Mexican"" chocolate stout. I was expecting some cinnamon - either its scent or its taste - as it is almost always present in Mexican chocolate or hot chocolate, and the cinnamon's just not there. Very fine carbonation, which works well for me, but the syrupy sweetness just coats everything initially, and the sour after-taste gets a little unpleasant."
""
""
""
""
"O - Too sweet for me. Was impossible to finish the bomber."
""
""
""
"Poured into a snifter, the body is almost pitch black, just a few hints a dark amber come through when you shine an extremely bright light through it. The head is thick, almost bullet proof I swear, creamy and is a light tan color. As for the carbonation, I’m sure it’s there I just can’t see it. The aroma is purely roasted malts, coffee and chocolate, maybe a slight hint of caramel and butter. The lacing is as tight as virgin’s ass and covers every inch of the glass. The mouth feel is thick and creamy, and the beer simply envelopes your tongue with roasted malt flavors, mild chocolate comes through in the aftertaste. This is right out of the fridge, but as it warms up more flavors breakthrough, caramel, and vanilla. It is a bit bitter overall, but the alcohol is well hidden. Another good beer from Clown Shoes…"

"22 ounce bottle, label says bottled 5/2012. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like roasted malt, chocolate, and some chilies and vanilla. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but the chilies are more noticeable now, along with the addition of a bit of cinnamon. The chilies aren't hot at all, but the mild chile flavor works well with this brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit creamy and slick with moderate carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, although I do wish the chilies would have been hotter. But with that being said, it's worth trying and I would buy this again in the future."
""
""
""
""
"O: I probably enjoyed the chilis in this beer (it being a big stout) a lot more than I have in some of the others I have tried. I found this beer to be interesting - a lot of the different flavors of a mole but not combined in quite the same fashion. Added it to a chipotle citrus pork that slow cooked for tacos and enjoyed them together - a very nice combination."
"Dark ebony with a small tan head that recedes to a film of different sized bubbles and scraps of lace on the glass. Semi sweet chocolate, cocoa and anise with faint vanilla, cinnamon and even fainter chiles in the aroma. Semi sweet chocolate and cinnamon with a touch of acidity and some detectable vanilla and mild chile heat. The flavors work well together overall. Medium bodied and slightly chalky with a little more carbonation than I prefer in an Impy Stout but I'm nit picking, this is a fine beer. A fine ""Mexican-style"" stout if that's what you're looking for."
"A solid beer, where the chocolate and spice comes through nicely. Quite light in body, which is both good and bad. It's relatively easy to drink, and the alcohol,is well hidden, but it may be a tad too light- a little more body and sweetness would help the heat and chocolate to shine more. I do like the ancho flavor- it's mild enough not to dominate and just add an accent, but not so light you can't notice it for what it is, and it marries very well with the chocolate. Some cinnamon and vanilla flavors round it out a bit, but those could be deeper. All in all I definitely enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is definitely a good buy for under $10, but I wouldn't go much over. It's a fun and unique take on one of my favorite styles. It's worth a shot if you find it."
"One of the better new stouts I've had lately that I'd never even heard of. This concoction works, period, & I'll be out to grab another bottle. Excellent beer."
"Overall: Pretty solid beer here. Seen it for some time, bought, now waiting only a month to enjoy it. Should of bought it sooner."
""
"Pours very dark black - not remotely brown. Fast acting brown foam atop the darkness. Nose is dark chocolate, espresso. Taste is a rich roasted coffee/malt, which fades into a very subtle hot pepper/jalapeno. Ever so slight kick to close. Zing! Really blends well with the chocolately malt deep flavor. Really like this one."
"Overall: A nice tasting imperial stout. Good roasty chocolate flavors. The spicing could of been a little stronger. Good overall."
""
""
""
"O: pretty good imperial stout, definitely like the chocolate character and the fact it had a little spiciness to it as well."
"This is my first time drinking it and I fell in love with the first sip and definately recomned to anyone who drinks stouts."
""
""
""
""
"Smells of that faint musty zest that dried ancho chiles have over a more recognizable roasted malt aroma with just a touch of chocolate. It could have benefited from a slightly stronger chocolate nose IMO. However, there is lots more chocolate to be found in the flavor than the nose promises. The chile heat is only presented as a faintly rising warmth in the finish accented by cinnamon dust. The cinnamon and chile heat needs to be amplified by about 20% to help counterbalance the chocolate sweetness of the malt better. The ABV is rather well hidden, though. Pretty good, but not amazingly good."
"Then the first sip. Full like I wanted a stout to be, but bit off with the chiles. It had almost a bitter aftertaste. On my second and third sops, I kike the little heat, but still the chiles used were not some of my favorites"
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the aroma. The nose is hit with smooth vanilla, hot chilies, depth of malts, and added chocolate sweetness, all at once. It gave the drinker a lot to amalgamate, as each component was so strong on their own, but in the end things were nicely balanced. The flavoring came nicely to follow, but we found it more bland than we were hoping for, particularly in the way of obvious chili pepper spice. This lacked, as did the look, placing this hombre somewhere in the middle for the style."
""
"D - Very well balanced and tasty."
""
""
"O - 4.0 - I got this because Clown Shoes had yet to disappoint and I can say it still hasn't. This is an interesting beer and I haven't had one quite like it. I also got it because I thought it might be the closest I could come to a Hunaphu's due to the chile, chocolate, cinnamon, and vanilla. So it's nice to get a hint of that chile in the end. I'd give it just under 4 in this category if I could."

"Tastes alright but still not much in the way of complexity. Roasted malt and some light vanilla traces and a little earthy sweetness that could possibly be attributed to ancho chilies, but not for certain. Medium bodied and fairly smooth. A slight tingle in the aftertaste that points to ancho again, though chocolate dominates. A good stout overall."
"A decent beer overall, but lacks in several areas. I wouldn't buy this one again at the bomber price of $8.69."
""
"Nice looking beer. Opaque body with a chocolate brown head that leaves nice lace. Aroma is very inviting. Chocolate and caramel malt. Roasted malt. Slight pepper. Flavor profile brings more of the same. The pepper is there, but very light. Perfect for this beer. Chocolate/caramel malt base is superb in this beer. Roasted, coffee like tones are subtle, but there. Light amounts of pepper heat. And a really nice milk sugar, milk stout like presence on the buds. Light-medium bodied and smooth and velvety. Quite enjoyable. Hitting 3 for 4 now with these Clown Shoes beers."

"Flavor wise its a combination of the way it looks and smells, it has an almost gritty texture to it. Its loaded with cocoa nibs and all kinds of chocolatey goodness with a tiny amount of hot pepper. I just wish I had gotten more than a single snifter. There are tons of flavors going on."
""
"Something like an imperial sweet stout with peppers. It's as unique as it sounds. Definitely worth a try. Might revisit again later."

"Comes out of the bottle a rich, warm sable just a red tomcat whisker above black. Head is fairly thick, fine-bubbled, and toasty tan. Aroma has chocolate, coffee, nutty and earthy notes, very appealing. Flavor fills the mouth with semi-sweet chocolate, quality coffee, nutty and earthy notes plus hints of caramel and hops. Full-bodied texture has plenty of tingle and fizz. Now, how does one say ""Excellent beer"" in Mexican Spanish?"
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is smooth and easy drinking with a nice mix of flavor. Its worth a try and nice balance without the pepper inclusion being too dominating."
""
"Despite the disparate ingredients, this beer worked well. The chile taste began in a subtle fashion, and intensified as the beer was sipped. Very enjoyable, and a nice change of pace."
""
""
""
"22oz bottle with Bottled 5/2012 on the side. Pours a dark black color with a half inch of frothy light brown head. Fair amount of lacing. Aroma is spicy with some cinnamon and chocolate. Roasted malts and hints of smoke. The taste has mostly chocolate upfront followed by the cinnamon and chiles. Spicy and tingly at the end. Odd mixture but it works. The more I drink it, the more heat I get from the chiles. Overall, its a decent beer that I couldnt drink all the time but would buy every once in a while."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thick black pour, with small retained head. Chocolate and sweet spicy aroma. A quality chocolate in liquid form, with spiciness and some heat. Fuller mouthfeel.Good drinkability, but woe to the one who drinks it all, a la me. I was burping up the chile and Cinnamon eight hours later."
""
"22oz. bottle shared by Dave Guay. Pours slightly darker than cola with a creamy, half inch, tan-colored head. Nose expresses cocoa, lactose, cinnamon and a hint of spice. Taste consistent with nose; however, there is also slight vanilla presence and the chile flavors are also revealed, albeit somewhat subdued and in the background. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a lively carbonation and just a slight, residual heat from the chiles. I have to say that I like this beer more than I though I would. The flavors coalesce nicely without any aspects really over asserting. All and all a pretty nice beer."
""
""
""
"Overall – not a terribly original type, but still pretty true to it and good-tasting."
"What a unique description! An imperial chocolate stout with ancho chile, cinnamon and vanilla. I had to try a bottle. The result? A pretty decent imperial stout, but not one that stands out in the crowd. All of the elements that would make this a singular beer are hard to detect. The chile is all but absent, but there is a hint of cinnamon. Don't get me wrong, I love a good chocolatel & vanilla stout, but there are better ones that aren't as expensive. I've purchased another one of Clown Shoes' imperial stouts and I hope they bring a little more pizzazz to my palate."
""
""
"Another riff on the Hunhapu's formula. Let's see how this goes. It pours out black with a small mocha head. The aroma is full of chocolate, with some roasted malts and a touch of peppers. The flavor is very heavy on the chocolate, with roasted peppers providing balance. There's some roasted malts in the back of everything. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, and fairly highly carbonated, and the drinkability is good. This is a solid imperial stout, with a unique flavor balance and nice use of peppers. It's just missing a little something to really make it stand out. It's really worth a try though."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice chocolate stout; rich, thick and tasty."
"Served on tap at Jerry's. Appearance is dark brown, not quite opaque, auburn highlights at the edges. Aroma is all chocolate with earthy notes of tobacco and mild cayenne. Taste is rich and chocolatey with hints of spice and roast. Earthy qualities resonate throughout. Mouthfeel is somewhat light for style with moderate carbonatiOn. Overall, this is a tasty beer the would benefit from more body."
""
""
"Dark brown in color with a tan head. Heavy on the roasted malt with mild coffee and, despite the name, only a moderate chocolate aroma. The flavor is somewhat bitter, perhaps even astringent. There is some mild vanilla, a bit of chocolate and coffee, and quite a bit of roast. Another mediocre beer from Clown Shoes."
"A decent beer, but really nothing special either. I'm not a big brown ale fan, and that's what this comes across as... a brown ale that has had a considerable amount of chocolate added to it. I really did pick up much of the chili flavor at all."
"D: This was a great concept that was executed fairly well. Not on the same level as Huna, which may have been the inspiration. But the scent was still very nice, even though the taste wasn't as unique. The body was excellent, and the finish was smooth, so it was easy to drink. No reason to age this. Nice beer but not exceptional."
""
"overall - I was actually expecting bolder flavors. It could be cranked up."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is nice and toasty with lots of caramel. For those that dont get traditional Mexican candies, this beer doesn’t stray too far from the intended flavour. Man...You might be able to simmer some shredded chicken in this and pass it off as mole! Good beer, great concept and the Clowns have executed this one damn near perfectly! Props on this one!"
"Definitely worth a try and comes recommended."
""
"O: I don't know...this is a good beer, but I'm a HUGE pepper fan...was hoping for a bit more pepper flavor, but all I got was a touch of heat and that was pretty much it. Other than that, this is a good Imperial Stout at best."
""
""
""
" Taste of the chocolate malt is high in this stout with cocoa presence and slight creamy spicy flavor with vanilla and noticeable heat with pepper and cinnamon coming through. The alcohol is noticeable but the cinnamon flavor is pleasant when blended with the cocoa and pepper. The strong toasted flavors create a backdrop for the slight cocoa lingering in the finish. Overall this is a pretty good beer all in all it is mild in spice though which is better than going overboard most of the time. I would drink this again since it has a nice amount of cocoa flavor and is quaffable, even if not the best of the style."
"O: The burnt malts really dominate this beer creating an acrid flavor that is not very pleasant."
"Pours a two finger khaki head that vanishes leaving traces of lace. Black color, no highlights, a little yeast left in bottle. Light-medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Baked chocolate nose and flavor is sweet baked chocolate. No hint of the ancho chile. Higher ABV is hidden. $8.99 for a 22oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT. Bottled 2/2012."
"O: A pretty solid beer, overall. Lots of nice chocolate and spice notes, though it's not terribly complex."
""
""

"O: A unique brew. Cinnamon, chili and chocolate stout. There isn't much chili so if you're a pepperhead then don't expect too much. It's mainly cinnamon and chocolate, not much else from the roasted malt is present. That's not to say it's bad, but it's fairly one-dimensional (two-dimensional I suppose). However, as a fan of stouts, chocolate stouts especially and all things spicy, I enjoyed it."
""
""
"O - Disappointed. I was really hoping to get some complexities from the vanilla and cinnamon, and some heat from the chilies, but if those hadn't been in the description on the bottle I would never have known they were in there. Neither of us were impressed, and we did not finish the bottle between us."
""
"O - I have been impressed by the Clown Shoes offerings I have tried lately. This sounded interesting, so I picked one up. The flavors are complex, with a hint of spice. My biggest knock would probably be that it is a little bit sweet for my taste. Still, I like it and bonus points for value on a $6 deuce deuce."
""
"Overall: I dug it! I do enjoy cinnamon, and I do enjoy some chile heat, but, at some point, both can get summarily ghastly quickly. Thankfully, I found the levels of both to be pleasant and well-incorporated within the rest of the beer."
"I like this beer just fine. A few shortcomings, mostly regarding the qualities comparable to others of the style. 4.0"
"This is a really smooth stout with tremendous flavor. The spices blend nicely with the rich chocolate base. The coffee and roasted notes play nicely throughout. This was a really enjoyable stout. It's definitely worth trying."
"From the 22 oz bottle purchased from Food and Friends in Philadelphia. Thoroughly pleasant, and highly sippable, but hardly worth the freight for my wallet."
"Yet another winner from Clown Shoes. They really do stouts well. Chocolate Sombrero is almost a Hunahpu light- not as big, rich or complex but it hits many of the same notes with a much lower price tag. Well worth at least a try for any stout fan. I'm not sure what aging will do to the subtle chili and cinnamon but I'm gonna sock 1 or 2 away to find out."
"Poured jet black into my imperial nonic,a thinner deep beige colored head atop.Alot of vanilla and chocolate in the nose,as it sat more the alcohol sweetness along with some dark fruit came into play,not much ancho presence.Flavors of vanilla and bakers chocolate were nice but the ancho chilli flavors were very light wich I was hoping to get more of,nicely roasted in the finish.It's a double stout with rich flavors just lacking the chilli flavors wich was the main reason I bought the beer."

"a pretty tasty beer, you really have to let it warm to bring out some of those hidden flavors. i was a little disappointed in that there was really no chilie pepper flavor, as i was looking forward to that the most after i read the label. also after reading the label, i couldnt help but think that maybe they got influenced by hunapus a bit, but this definatly reminded me way more of victory at sea."
""
"O- Although it's an idea that's been done before, Clown Shoes hit the nail on the head with this one. I'm going to be pretty bold in saying that it ranks up there with the Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti, that's how nice it is."
""
""
""
"Overall: the multi limbed, beer loving, chocolate loving Mexican wrestler on the label is awesome."
"O- Overall, this was an enjoyable brew that gets extra points in my book for being so unique. The flavors of the ingredients come together almost magically at times. Highly recommended!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I would have liked some more heat in this beer. Not a ton, just enough to know that the pepper are there. Not bad, but not mind blowing."
""
""
""
"O - Not my most favorite brew from Clown Shoes, but not their worst either. The flavor profile was just missing a few key elements for me to really love this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium full bodied with moderate carbonation and a creamy, slightly sticky overall mouthfeel. Very smooth and tasty."
""
"Feels like the pepper really added subtle effects other than pepper heat. Very well done."
""
""
"O – Quite good. Very enjoyable. Not quite as complex as New Belgium’s “Cocoa Mole”, but better and more “southwestern” than Sam Adam’s “The Vixen”. Awesome as a dessert beer (which is how this was sampled). A worthy effort."
"O- nice chocolate and pepper combo and drinks well."
""
"O: Clown Shoes continues to impress me, especially with their recent stout entries. they are quickly becoming my new ""Southern Tier."""
"Overall, decent stout for the price and I will gladly re-visit it."
""
""
"O: A grand brew. Sure wish it wasn't 12 plus dollars a bottle tho."
""
""
"overall this is a great representation of a chilie beer. I would have it again and recomend it as well."
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style with carbonation being moderate. Overall, it was an interesting beer with a lot of bold flavors to it. It came together pretty well, but the flavors just didn't really stand out to me. Decent and interesting beer overall and I give them credit for getting all of the flavors to work pretty well together though."
"This is one of the better Pepper beers I've had, the kick isn't muted too bad. Would drink again and definitely enjoy."
""
""
""
"CHEERS"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I didn't care for this beer, and moreover, I found the quality to be lacking. I wasn't a fan of either of the three chili stouts at the tasting, but with the other two at least it seemed like the flavors just didn't sit well for me, whereas I can't picture people actually liking this one."
""
"not bad. not crazy, not wonderful, but drinks very well. good novelty beer."
"Fantastic!!"
"The beer pours a very dark brown to black color with a tan head. The first thing I get in the aroma is a ton of chocolate, with a little bit of roasted malt. I also get some nice cinnamon notes in the aroma. The flavor is a little more complex. The chocolate notes go very well with some nice heat and flavor from the peppers. There is also a little cinnamon, but it is stronger in the aroma than the flavor. Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice beer, glad I got to try it."
""
""
"This beer pours a medium bodied dark brown that turns to black as it pools. It had a nice one finger beige head that turns to a sticky lacing around the glass. The nose is pretty simple, yet effective. It's comprised of milk chocolates with a touch of coffee. The flavors too are simple yet smooth. It's milk chocolate, milk chocolate, milk chocolate, with a light roast. I don't get any spice or pepper, and I believe it was supposed to? It's fine regardless. It's nice and chocolaty. It drinks medium in body and is very smoooth and light. It's a pretty nice stout, and one I wouldn't mind having again."
""
""
"The body is full and silky with soft carbonation. Overall this one is tasty. My biggest qualm is there are so man ingredients on the label and only a handful come through."
"This is pretty good, but I am slightly disappointed that the flavors aren't a little more pronounced."
""
""
"Served in a snifter, a dark brown-black color with a thin chocolate brown head that receded to a ringlet within a minute or two. Mostly roasty dark malts in the aroma, and not much of anything else. Taste was roasty as predicted, dark malts, coffee bitterness and cocoa up front, with an underlying sweetness. I didn't like this very much at first, but with time and a bit of warming, the bitterness faded, and the mouthfeel became much smoother, some semi-sweet chocolate came out, though the flavor actually seemed to wane quite a bit. Still a decent brew overall and quite drinkable, but I probably won't revisit it any time soon."
"Overall, I was really pleasantly surprised by this beer. The chocolate isn't as strong as I thought it might be, but the chiles work really well and are present but not dominating. The vanilla is a bit on the sweet side, but it works against the spice. I would definitely try this again."
"Overall: A really fun beer. This may be my favorite Clown Shoes offering. Has a fairly similar house taste, but really works within this 'style'."
""
""
""
"O: I wasn't expecting too much from this one and it really surprised me. This is about as good as Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti although I do think the Yeti has a bit more pepper heat than this one."
""
"D ~ One & Done. Wouldn't get again. Too broad of flavors. No focus. If they would've omitted the Vanilla & added more Roasted Malts than they would've gotten somewhere with this one. Not recommended. If you're looking for a Mexican Chocolate beer, then try Cocoa Mole."
""
""

"Interesting looking label found it's way into my shopping cart the other day. Pours a solid dark brown/black with a decent sized fluffy brown head with moderate retention. Smells like chocolate, lots and lots of syrupy milk chocolate. There's some roasty grains and earthy hops in there as well but the nose is lots of chocolate. Taste is roasty with a hint of coffee and earth and again lots of sweet milk chocolate. I get a hint of chile heat in the finish but it is really subtle. The cinnamon I can't find but I don't really miss either. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a creamy velvety and slightly ashy mouthfeel. I liked this one a lot. Lots of chocolate, creamy and very tasty."
""
""
""
"Pours a brownish black with a fluffy white head. The Ancho Chile hits my nose first, then vanilla, not as much chocolate as I would have thought, but it is there, a dark cocoa, and roast. The taste and mouthfeel combine the subtle flavors of chile, cinnamon, and vanilla with the chocolate malts beuatifully, with an excellent texture. Great beer!!"

"Another winner from Clown Shoes!"
"Well, Clown Shoes got me to at least buy this beer. The label was cool, it sounded really delicious and tasted nothing more than a mediocre stout with chocolate and plenty of booze."
"Overall not bad, interesting malts and chocolate flavors, but a bit of a bad spoiled chocolate like flavor, bit of hops, bit of booze, somewhat drinkable."
"Both the body and flavor of Chocolate Sombrero are sadly much thinner than expected. Lots of chocolate, for sure, but the other ingredients get pushed aside. Slightly vegetal flavor in the middle and lots of dusty cocoa in the finish. The heat I was so looking forward to results more from the booze than the chilies, unfortunately. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and low in carbonation. I really want to like Clown Shoes, but I've slowly come to the conclusion that their exciting-sounding releases are just, well, slightly disappointing. Chocolate Sombrero is another 'hat' which fits that bill."
"O/D-The chile spice sneaks up on you but I enjoy its still not-overwhelming intensity. I love Clown Shoes and will always try their new brews. This was an ambitious attempt and as far as I am concerned it was a success. Not my favorite from them, but its a good time, and its unique."
"O - Overall, not all that impressed by this. On paper it really looked like something I wanted to get my hands on. Just really don't find it as well balanced as their other stout offerings."
"Very good! I'm buying another bottle for aging purposes."
"Pours a deep brown with transient small white head. Smells of chocolate and light roastiness, along with a slight sweetness. Taste mirrors the smell with the addition of a faint bite and a subtle tickle in the throat. Upon reading the label I see that this beer was made with ancho chiles, cinnamon and vanilla. Some nice notes that have ruined other beers with a more heavy-handed use. Body feels a bit thin for a 9% abv stout, but this also adds to the drinkability. Overall worth picking up."
