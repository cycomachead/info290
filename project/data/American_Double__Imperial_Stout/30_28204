4.28,1.9,4,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"The flavor profile can be summed up in one word...intense.  Sip about a quarter of it to let your palate adjust to the alcohol, then you can savor this remarkable uber imperial stout.  You first experience a wave of rich chocolate over an equally rich heavy malt base that screams molasses (with caramel notes) and vanilla.  The middle accentuates the vanilla and malt before the alcohol lends its spicy heat as if from a hellish caldron.  The finish produces the only bitterness, which is slight, a final wave of rich molasses like sweetness and lingers with a somewhat astringent alcohol burn at the back of the throat.  This devil will light you up!!","tillmac62","Mar 30, 2015"

Head is a thin-yet-dense formation of level, brown froth. Milder lacing. Smell is different. It seems to have a bit of hops to it. Pine hops. Dark malt, dark bread. I could venture to say it smells like the 'go-to' coffee and chocolate but I'm not certain it actually does. Dark fruit. Not very impressed with the aroma. The flavor is better. It tastes more traditionally Stout-like. could it use some age? Yes. I find the alcohol dominates the experience more than the specific flavors. Really leaves a lot of heat on the back of the tongue and in the cheeks. However, I schelled out $11 for this bottle knowing how much of a monster it would be so I will not complain from here on out. Syrupy dark malt. Almost like dark malt extract. Burnt malt. Bitter cocoa and roast. Almost tastes bourbon barreled.  Finishes hot and stiff. Thick bodied...no shit! Carbonation is low enough to make me nervous that it would hold up to much aging. I will sip this beer with determination and probably die in my sleep due to its evil powers.","VelvetExtract","Jan 30, 2015"

4.45,6,,,,,,"Poured from a bottle into a Fremont small snifter.  2012 vintage. Pours pitch black with a fine one finger brown head with great retention and lots of lacing. Rich aroma of dark toasted malt, chocolate, latte coffee, light vanilla. Flavor is semi-sweet dark toasted malt, cocoa chocolate, hints of anise and vanilla, dark coffee. Finish exhibits light cherry and slight hopping.  Rich and boozy, but nicely balanced. Nice heavy, creamy body.  It's hard to understand how this can taste so much like a quality liqueur at its lower (but still substantial for an ale)  ABV. The deep, rich flavor is more than a match for the alcohol, but a few sips of this are still warming and inspire slow sipping. Glad to get back to this for a review, this may well have been my first introduction to a big ale many years ago, and it was both mind blowing and overwhelming at the time. One of the great big stouts, although I don't think it's barrel aged, it has a lot of the same characteristic depth of a barrel aged stout, without the woody flavors. It is quite boozy, its only real drawback, although one that seem unimportant as the glass is emptied.  Perfect aperitif or dessert beer.","LiquidAmber","Aug 22, 2014"

4.4,4.8,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Wow, just when I thought that a stout couldn't get any darker or more chocolatey and deeply caramelish, I come across Avery's Mephistopheles' Stout and it knocks me backwards. Stunning! It reminds me in many ways of Samuel Adam's Triple Bock in that it's super-rich, but somehow not overdone! It just is what it is. There's alcohol for sure, 16% by volume, but it doesn't seem like it as it's not brimming or drenched in alcohol, and it doesn't seem hot (well a little, but there are no higher alcohols). Nor is it too malty or full; and there's a really beautiful fruitiness to it that helps to round out and polish the edge of alcohol (think berries, figs, prune, and maybe even some cherry). It's rich and complex, but at the same time it's neither too rich nor too complex - and that gives it a certain amount of drinkability once you ascertain that it's a large, intensely flavored sipping beer. But what about the density of flavor? Well, that changes as you progress through the glass, but there are notes of dark chocolate, fudge, cocoa, brown sugar, deep caramel, golden caramel, wort, berries, cherries, soft melon, alcohol, and raisins/figs/prunes.","NeroFiddled","Jun 29, 2014"

Not quite as thick as the pour indicated, but by no means thin... I'd call it medium heavy? But incredibly smoothe. I can't wait to get another bottle and let it sit for even longer to let the alcohol mellow out a little more, because this is great as is, but with that sorted out it could be galaxian... you heard me.","kemoarps","May 04, 2014"

A very appealing looking beer; I really enjoyed tilting the glass and watching the thick, molasses consistency like lacing crawl down the glass. A very inviting nose of nutty chocolate and port wine which followed through to the taste. Very creamy mouthfeel which just settles in your mouth. As mentioned, this was probably way too strong fresh, but now it’s like some liquor infused brownie or something. I wholeheartedly recommend grabbing a few bottles of this next time you see it around and saving them for a future date. I bet this beer could even go another year before it starts to go downhill.","CowsandBeer","Mar 14, 2014"

So far, so good. Next is the deep aroma of, what? Deep, dark decadence? Don't care, I've got to taste this... I get hit with an overpowering mixture of flavors that my humble palate is incapable of describing, followed by the fumes of alcohol that run rampant through this brew.

Taste: Intense notes of thick, dark chocolate, massive complexity, toffee, burnt caramel, thick, oily, roasted coffee, roasted barley, bourbon and plums. Overall, very thick and agressive booze that lies in the finish and a continuous dark chocolate bar/fudge that stays on the palate. Very good stuff, very thick, very boozy but still that booze is pretty well blended with the malty flavors. A+ rating.","IAmAPenguin","Dec 20, 2013"

Roast is strong as well and along with the alcohol and mild hops, dries things out nicely on the finish. Dark fruit kind of creeps out of nowhere as it warms and provides some needed complexity. Mouthfeel is as thick as any beer out there, silky too. Great beer that I have passed up on the last few years for no apparent reason.

This beer was bottled in January of 2006 so it has a bit of age on it. The aroma is dark fruit and a touch of coffee. The flavor is intense, lots of fruit a bit of alcohol, some coffee toward the end. There is a lot of sweetness, not to the point of cloying imho, but your mileage may vary. This is an intense, big beer and is pretty decent if that's your thing, if not you might not care for it.","Drew966","Sep 03, 2013"

4.12,-1.9,3.75,4.25,4.25,3.75,4,"I acquired this beer in one of my first trades which was with Schmittymack back at DLD 09. This is batch 1 bottled in January 2006 with a listed ABV of 15.1%. Appearance is dark black with almost no head or light passage. Not quite as viscous on the appearance as I'd expect for a 15+ abv brew. Nose starts with heavy amounts of dark fruits and molasses. Figs, brown sugar, plums, and dark cherries join forces to make for a very sweet smell. Roasted malts come in towards the end along with cocoa which rounds out this massive aroma. The taste starts with a very sweet malty presence with much of the dark fruit characters that I detected on the nose. Molasses and brown sugar dominate the mid palate with a rush of roast on the finish. This brew has aged into a very complex sweet imperial stout. My last experience with this beer (fresh) was over the top boozy. This cellared version, while still boozy and big, is much more complex. Mouthfeel is smooth and big with light carbonation. Overall, this beer is in the realm of Dark Lord and World Wide Stout in terms of its high abv and residual sweetness. The age has been nice to this brew as I find it much more enjoyable than when its fresh.","homebrew311","May 30, 2013"

Plenty of burn in the nose (my other bottle will age yrs) but it dissolves quickly to rich dark malt, the yeast rises again before the dark fruits smooth it all away. Some rye tannin's and alcohol burn are that's keeping this from being one of the best beer's I've ever had! After a few years to smooth this will be a Giant.","templar316","Mar 05, 2013"
4.73,12.6,4.5,4,5,5,5,"Another home-run for Avery. Holy crap did they knock this one out of the park. This I'd have to compare this with maybe 2 others to side-by-side to really say whether or not I think this is the best stout I've ever had, but it's definitely a front-runner. I split a bottle between 4 friends and that was two days ago, so sadly I can't be TOO specific about this beer. what I can say is that on top of the delicious typical stout flavours, they managed to give it just the right amount of earthy flavour that I like. Absolutely perfect. Anymore and I feel like it would have started to get that soy-sauce flavour that can really destroy a super-strong stout. But god-damn was this spot on. It didn't have too much of any one flavour to cover up any other either, to further that trend of perfection. It had coffee, malty, and chocolate notes all swimming together a deliciously warm sea. I'm referring to alcohol warmth, which was very present, but had less of a bite than I was expecting. I actually like bite in my beer, so I actually prefer Avery's The Beast to this one because it's a lighter bodied, sweet brew with about the same alcohol content, providing more of an alcohol bite. But stouts aren't about bite, so this was really more about stout perfection. The perfect mingling of flavours. The feel was great too. It wasn't too acidic or gritty. It just felt good in my mouth. Great stuff, Avery. Keep it coming.","ElCommodoro","Mar 03, 2013"

Pours a typical opaque dark rustic brown with tan head that disappears quickly with very little lacing. Dark chocolate, grape and curry... seriously that's what I smell... permeate the nose and do not entirely play well together. The rest is okay but not world class. Taste begins with a satisfying rush of intensity from the alcohol. Fortunately I didn't taste the awkward spices that I could very clearly smell. The flavor blended quickly into mocha, grilled fruit, and very light but noticeable hops bitterness on the end. The mouthfeel was good. Nice, thick. This is a beer you can really chew on. In the end most of my complaining is wiped away by the fact that this in in fact a fairly well balanced stout. Not going to deny it, the taste is actually pretty good, but just not as good as some others, granted with far lower ABVs. You can tell on I'm kind of on the fence about this. I apologize for the wavering review. Bottom line, it's worth try, if the pocketbook can afford it ($9 a 12oz bottle at my store, eee-ouch).","Kevin73","Dec 19, 2012"

Pours a dense pitch black color with a small fairly dens tan head with decent retention, that reduces to a ring of lace as expected. Slight foamy lace on the glass with a ton of alcohol legs. Aromas of intense dark chocolate, burnt malt, roast, toast, raisin, molasses, prune, caramel, toffee, earth, and slight herbal. Very nice and incredibly complex aromas with good intensity; no booziness at all. Taste of huge dark chocolate, raisin, prune, toast, roasted malt, biscuit, molasses, burnt malt, caramel, toffee, earth, light herbal spiciness, and a touch of soy sauce. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, toffee, molasses, raisin, prune, roast, burnt malt, earth, and light herbal on the finish for a while. Incredible array of flavor complexities shift across the palate during sipping. Very nice balance as well, with absolutely zero cloying sweetness. Low carbonation and very full bodied; with a nice creamy, slick, thick, and lightly oily mouthfeel. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden with pretty much zero warming noticed after the finish surprisingly for 15%. Overall this is an absolutely outstanding and very big Imperial Stout. Huge flavor complexity and balance; and very smooth to sip on for such a high gravity beer. Fantastic stuff, highly enjoyable.","superspak","Aug 09, 2012"

Scent is heavy on the chocolate side with a good amount of espresso. Some dark malt, but mostly chocolate cocoa and espresso beans. A good amount of vanilla as well. Taste is WOW...much better than I was expecting. Honestly, I was thinking this beer was going to be a boozy mess, but it is nowhere near that. First I get chocolate cake with some nice vanilla and a bit of toffee. Some coffee notes linger, along with some solid alcohol booze (not overwhelming at all though). Very sweet, with just a tiny hint of anise. This guy is a chocolate bomb though. Mouthfeel is medium bodied (more thin than expected) with a very warming sensation. Drinkability is SCARY high for a beer that reads 15.9% ABV. Overall, this is a delightful sipper.

Pours a thick pitch black color with a large mocha head (surprising considering the ABV). The smells are of dark roasted malts, not the alcohol smell I was expecting. The feel is thick. The taste is good, I do get the alcohol I was worried about, there seems to be some sweetness to counter it and there is the bitterness from the dark roasted malts.","DavidST","Mar 15, 2012"

Syrupy, with hints of dark fruits like cherries and grapes following. Huge dark chocolate and bitter alcohol on the initial sip. Smokey tobacco and oak flavors hit the palate hard, with heavy molasses and brown-sugared fruits. The dark chocolate rolls into a sharper cacao bean mouthfeel towards the end of the drink.

Notes of Madeira, cedar, oak, vanilla, soy sauce, licorice, and earthy tobacco surround the big malty sweetness. Wow. Very complex. Faint herbal bitterness and a little coffee in the finish, but it's mostly lingering sweetness. Full-bodied and syrupy, with gentle carbonation.

Some chocolate, sweet coffee and earthiness. Taste is boozey chocolate upfront. Coffee and caramel as well. Some vanilla at the end. The alcohol dominates but I think the age helps pick up on the other flavors. This is certainly a heavy, chewy sipper. Reminds me of DFH World Wide Stout. Probably not as good as WWS, but a fine beer in its own right. Big alcohol burn but its done well. Very interested in trying a fresh one now.

Yes, you read that right, an effing growler. We killed it too... One of the dumber things we've done so far. Anyways, this one poured pitch black with a minimal light brown head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, caramel, and brown sugar. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, caramel, brown sugar, and big alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. Just a heads up, do not mix this brew and tequila shots later in the night as my doppelganger found out (lead to a blackout). This thing lays an assault on your palate with the alcohol just like a nice glass of bourbon would. This definitely kills the drinkability of this one for sure. But who buys a growler of this and doesn't expect to be wasted???

The taste was pretty straight forward in that it was a crazy boozed of version of a great many dark beers. There were on or two fancy notes in there that took me to fine European desserts, but ultimately a Russian invasion of vodka like alcohols swarmed the palate like angry bees. I longed for a creamy mouth-feel that was at times suggested, but did not stand a chance against the cruel alcohol overlord in this beer.

There isn't much lacing but the head stuck around from start to finish. The smell is boozey, chocolatey, and has some old leather aromas on the nose. The taste has a rich chocolatey flavor mixed with a heavily roasted flavor with a alcohol burn. There's even a sweet caramel flavor too. The mouthfeel is smooth, it's got a light carbonation to it. It's drinkable for the massive abv this has. Overall this is a killer brew, it's really worth trying if you see it around.","Knapp85","Jun 05, 2011"

4.26,1.4,5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pour was inky black, opaque, with a thin caramel brown head that dissipated quickly. The nose was predominantly chocolate and sour cherries, actually quite vinous. The first taste is espresso, chocolate, and dried fruit. Raisins, figs, and sour cherries predominate. The initial mouthfeel is smooth and full. The finish is a peppery astringent bitterness that is a little surprising for an imperial stout. This is a more Belgian than American stout. To be honest I prefer Founders KBS, Deschutes Abyss, or Ballast Point Victory at Sea, which are more creamy and less vinous. That said this beer covers the alcohol well and delivers a memorable buzz. I hope I get a chance to try it on tap. I will definitely buy a couple of bottles to cellar, I believe it will improve with age.","tomfneph","Apr 14, 2011"

Some alcohol aroma, definite malt sweetness, some roast, some chocolate. Beastly. The flavor is exceptionally well integrated, not sure the age on this batch, but it is outstanding. Starts with roasty sweetness and chocolate, the alcohol burn begins several seconds after the swallow is consummated. Egads! Delicious, the sweet, sweet burn. An outstanding beverage from the fine folks at Avery.","dragonWhale","Mar 23, 2011"
4.28,1.9,4.5,4,4,4.5,5,"Pours out flat black with a 3/4"" chocolate-milk head. Shows amber where thin. Head falls to a solid ring with a wispy cap. Aroma is very powerful but one dimensional, chocolate chocolate chocolate. Super rich expensive cocoa powder, dry and dusty but unmistakable chocolate. Hints of a meatiness, perhaps a little yeast autolysis since the bottle is five years old, very nice though. Maybe a touch of raisins or other dark dried fruit, but that's really really trying. No sign of any alcohol. The flavor brings some warming brandy-booze, chocolate covered red/dark fruits, maybe even a touch of very sweet blueberry. There's a touch of tang at the sides of the tongue, and a finish of roasty nuts, hazelnuts I think. The mouthfeel on this thing is great, super smooth, very easy to put down, leaves the tongue tingling slightly. Thankfully doesn't finish overly sticky, the palate finishes cleaner than expected for a beer of this... heft. The drinkablity on this monster is terrifying. It drinks easier than a wine of its strength, and it also drinks easier than a beer a third its strength, absolutely no suggestion of its impressive abv.

The music get louder and more extreme, the fanbase follows suite, but the number of followers may drop off. Mephistopheles seems to be the punk rock of brews. It pours a thick head that quickly dissipates into nothing. The peer itself is extremely thick, giving a syrupy dark chocolate taste right to your face. You are left with a sort lingering bite, but overall, the massive ABV is largely hidden, at least to the drinker, though passers-by may notice the effects. One might also notice how sweet the beer is, with maybe a light tone of butter. Perhaps even slightly tart with a touch of spice. The aroma is very much of the roasted malts and coffee, but is somewhat subduded compared to the taste. This beer is black as black gets.

The taste walks the same line, though the roast is not quite as dizzominant, some molasses and cedar are added to the mix, and a small boozy kick comes in at the end.

It's eventually settles down to a cap of foam with sticky lace. The aroma on this is really rich. It's not all to different from your run of the mill stout but it's like it has be reduced to intensify the aromas. Lots of charred smokey aromas and fresh out of the jar molasses in the nose. The flavor is much like the nose just kind of seems intensified. Smokey molasses flavors; really a lot of sweetness going on here and some dark fruit undertones. The body seems a bit flat and it kind of seems to have an icy hot kind of feel. If nothing else the feel is pretty unique.

I was surprised that the smell of this beer is fairly subdued compared to the taste. The taste is fantastic. Almost like a taste bomb going off in your mouth. Coffee first, then chocolate w/ a hint of liqorice thrown in. Also LOTS of malt. The mouthfeel is amazing! It's like a journey w/ every sip.

The aroma is very roasted and sweet. I get booze, dried dark fruits like raisins and plum, vanilla, wood, liquorice, espresso coffee, and a slight burnt note. Flavor is also very complex and very roasted. There is alot of espresso coffee in the flavor, a charcoaly burnt note, liquorice, dried dark fruits, wood, slight and faint amount of hops, tobacco, a slight smoky note and booze. The body is full and creamy, with a very sticky oily mouthfeel. The high ABV is extremely well hidden thus making this a very dangerous (and drinkable) beer - couldn't have asked for a better logo to portray that warning.

Very heavy, thick, creamy but flavors abound with a buttery stickiness - molasses, syrup, bitter chocolate, caramel, toffee and wood w/ hint of vanilla are all over. Not much of a hop or fruit flavor profile as malts are so intense they leave a cloying sweet sensation all over tongue.

While is it definitely not a beer to be downed quickly, the intense booziness does not detract in anyway from the beer, and in fact makes it more enjoyable. It is definitely a sipper, but I find it easier to drink than DFH's World Wide Stout, as it is both tastier and better balanced. Let this one sit for a few years, I can imagine it'd be pretty hard to drink if fresh. Overall the beer is a great take on the extremely high ABV category of imperial stouts, and gets better an better with age.","greenmonstah","Dec 29, 2010"

The head disappears quickly and leaves no lacing. Smells a bit like molasses, with a hint of licorice. And it reeks of booziness. The taste is also alcoholic and warming. Bitter chocolate or cocoa, with undertone of coffee. I love a strong beer with this intensity of flavor. It is not by any means a balanced beer, but they clearly weren't aiming for balance. More boozy than Dark Lord, but at 15.9%, it should be. Body is light for the style, again, due most likely to the immense volume of alcohol. It makes me want to play in the snow with shorts and a t-shirt, and maybe sandals.","compass40204","Dec 23, 2010"

4.31,2.6,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Reviewed from notes taken on 01/29/10 at the Roadhouse in Brookline, MA. Awesome beer to see on tap since I never wanna get the $9-10 bottle, but on tap, why not? 8oz pour into a very nice looking wine glass. The beer allowed no light to penetrate into it and had a very nice dark tan/coffee colored head that was filled with very small bubbles. The head was about a pinky in size but had very nice retention. As I started to sip this monster the head left behind a nice coat of lace. The nose was good. A huge amount of roasted malts and some raisin like dark fruit hit the nose initially. They are followed by smaller hints of cocoa and coffee which I assume are from the malts. Mixed in there with all of this I got some notes of caramel and molasses in the aroma. Of course with a beer listed at 16.03%, there is a pretty large amount of alcohol in the nose. The alcohol does not take over the aroma but mixes in fairly nicely with the other elements. The taste is great in this beer. The massive heap of roasted malts is exactly what I would look for in a 16% stout. This is balanced with a surprisingly moderate level of alcohol, less present here than in the aroma. Some molasses and sweets are found in the taste but are nicely balanced with cocoa hints from the dark malts. I really think the balance is great here and just what I would want from such a big ABV stout. I also get some earthy hops in the after taste which add another nice element to the beer. Mouthfeel is also right on, the only criticism is the body could be a TINY bit thicker. The heat is high but not unrelenting, something I enjoy in huge beers. There is a nice cream to the texture and the low carbonation works very well in huge stouts. I also get some oily texture in the MF. Drinkability is awesome for any great tasting beer. The only problems here are the price for enjoying this beer regularly. The $8 pour was worth having as of now but I wouldn't do it all the time. The expensive bottles are not practical to enjoy regularly. Alcohol will take over this one after one pour. This one is a sipper and well worth trying. Great example of how super high ABVs can be used to make good beer.","cbutova","Jan 31, 2010"

Mouth feel was full bodied with just a little carbonation. Drinkability was not so good. The high ABV combined with the boozy taste almost makes you want to drink out of a shot glass.

Smells of a lot of dark fruit, brandy-like alcohol, roasted flavors, coffee, and chocolate. You can taste all those things as well as a biting, piney hop finish with more bitter flavor than I would have thought. The alcohol is extremely warming; like a port wine or something. These massive imperials are kinda like the ports of the beer world I guess. As it gets warmer, you get a liquor-like alcohol sting when you sip it. All around a pretty unique beer.

Thick, black, creamy light brown receding head; rich coffee chocolate bitter sweet...dark fruit(s) in the nose and mouth; smooth-can an incomplete sentence be a run-on?

The smell seems nice, sweet and syrupy. There's a strong roasted note, some fruity esters - plums, etc., and quite a bit of the dark cane sugar smell. There's also a burnt kind of note, perhaps from the huge alcohol, perhaps from the roasted malts. The beer itself tastes upfront of some sweetness, just a bit of a roasted flavor, then the turmoil comes. The elements seem to be there, but just not in the right balance. I'm hit with a huge fruity alcohol burn, just barely helped out with a bit of a chocolate flavor. It finishes just a bit oily, with a kind of burn roasted taste. The alcohol seems like just a little too much, and all of the effort that went into getting the alcohol seems a little too intense. I wonder what a bit more of a subdued version of this would be like. Probably pretty good, but this isn't about counterfactuals. The mouthfeel is of course dominated by the burning, there's a kind of full taste, but this makes me cringe from time to time. Of course, this one is a monster to finish on your own, even one bottle. It's like a battle filled with flinching, fleeting moments of joy, and a massive effort to swallow it.

It smelled like burnt coffee and bitter chocolate, with prominent licorice and alcohol, and hints of orange, fig, and sweet yeast. It tasted like rich dark chocolate and maraschino cherries, with some coffee and oak and licorice, along with noticeable alcohol flavoring. It was oily with no carbonation, and had a lasting burnt aftertaste with definite alcohol warming. Overall this was certainly a sipping beer, quite similar to the World Wide Stout. I wish I could try this fresh, but a 2 year old bottle was all I could find. Regardless, it has held up well, with very powerful and decadent flavors. I just can't say enough about how rich and complex this beer was. It had good body, but I wish it was a bit thicker to match the extreme flavor.

Luscious three-quarter inch mocha-colored head dissipated into an oily slick of foam that coalesced primarily around the perimeter of the glass. Solid sheet of lacing present during the tasting. Strong nose of dark fruit, alcohol and coffee. I could actually feel the alcohol burn in my nostrils as I tilted the glass back for my first sip and inhaled the aroma. Taste is similar to nose but much more intensified. Sugary sweet (brown sugar and molasses) with a slight hoppiness present at the finish. Alcohol is clearly detectable in this one, but it definitely mellows as it warms. Mouthfeel is extremely full-bodied and viscous with a mild carbonation present in the mix. Drinkability is somewhat limited by the pronounced alcohol presence; however, it definitely evens out over time. Took me about two hours to get through this one. I can't stress enough the importance of serving this brew at the appropriate temperature. Just allowing this beer to warm totally turned the experience around for me.","Jwale73","Apr 11, 2008"
4.36,3.8,4.5,3.5,5,4.5,4,"My sample is from batch #2, brewed in November of 2006. This devilish brew pours an opaque black, as if straight from the abyss. Virtually no light, no color hues show through ... a monumental head of chocolate brown emerges from the pour, threatening to overtake the tulip glass I've poured into and leaves a streaky lacing behind. The nose is quite warm with dark roasted malts, black strap mollases, coffee grounds, and smoke. The palate is almost shockingly sweet up front, then yielding to an incredibly full malty character that is so thick you'd swear it was a syrup rather than a beer. Following the cloyingly sweet beginning, a smoky dry element arises from within the blackened soul of this beast and hints at a unique burnt finish that is oddly dry. The bittering hops do their job in keeping this substance from being overwhelming in it's thick, black sweetness. The 16.03% ABV is well hidden, although you can tell this is not your average imperial stout. As my wife put it upon tasting this beer, ""this is an imperial stout on steroids."" One of the strongest, most complex imperial stouts I've sampled, hands down. I'd be hard pressed to drink more than a single 12oz bottle at any given sitting, partly because of the sinister ABV and partly because it is just so incredibly thick and sweet. This beer leaves you thirsting for a sip of water as if you've been parched by hell's own flame. Not just an ""extreme beer"" - this beer from the fine folks at Avery is an incredibly well-crafted and complex treat with a truly devilish appeal.","beerphilosopher","Apr 08, 2008"

Some dark fruit (cherry maybe) and alcohol. The burnt coffee flavors are noticeable first in the taste, followed by malt and a fairly fierce dosage of hoppiness. At first this seems smooth, but then the alcohol absolutely begins to rape and pillage the palate. Dont get me wrong, for 16% this is drinkable. Alcohol taste along with the remains of the coffee flavors and some bitter bitter chocolate and hops on the finish. Mouthfeel is the jewel of this one IMO. Almost perfect, nice and viscous. Drinkability is ok for the abv, but you will feel the alcohol in this one. I think this would benefit from a year or 5 in the cellar. I will defenitely be stashing some.

Aroma curls one's nose hairs, assaulting it with dark fruits, carob, dark roasted and scorched malts, hops, and one tremendous alcohol kick. Without a doubt, one could say that the alcohol plays a major factor in the taste profile, too. A lot of sweetness, somewhat sugary, with black patent, chocolate and dark roasted crystal malts providing some counterbalance. Hops are certainly there, but only provide bitterness, hard to detect any specifics. I feel like I should be lighting up a cigar with this beer.

Incredibly sweet taste- caramel malts, some roasted flavor and a big hit of currants and dried fruits. Gritty dry mouthfeel is somewhat unappetizing, but the alcohol is hidden very well despite the huge ABV with only a small burn to the throat. There is a slight herbal bitterness on the finish which helps counteract the extremely sweet brew. Definately and sipper.","kernalklink","Aug 19, 2007"

The nose is very malty, prunes, figs, dates, raisins, vanilla, oaked, toffee, chocolate, and some caramel. The taste is awesome, malty, sweet, oaky, nice touch of dark fruits, lots of toffee/chocolate/caramel.

I don't recall when ""American Double Stout"" came on the scene, but this beer should be pictured with the definition. Poured a tar black with a slight dark mocha lace ring. Aroma of brown sugar and a hint of apple. Mouthfeel initially borders on syrupy, but then goes a bit thinner when you acclimate to the density. Density is also the description for the flavors - the turbinado sugar used in brewing is evident in a strong maple syrup flavor that integrates quite nicely. Alcohol is evident, but not overpowering. One of these is plenty, but, having said that, I found it surprisingly drinkable.","Brent","Jul 25, 2007"

The smell was surprising subtle but was roasted malts, chocolate covered cherries, coffee, and a big hint of the ABV within. It set you up for what to expect. The taste was excellent with a good bite from start to finish. It had a slightly sweet finish due to the high ABV coming from fruit sugars. The mouthfeel was excellent as well - full and creamy. Overall, this is a tremendous beer that you have got to try. I generally don't like the high ABV's as they tend to feature the heat too much but this has a great balance.

The smell of the black malt, fruity esters and chocolatey tones are beaten down by alcohol in the nose. Starts off with tons of roasted malt and chocolate but is followed by an awkward fruity, lactic and boozy middle. Finish lets the hops come out a bit, nice and herbal. Coffee and smoke in the aftertaste as well as some vanilla once I let it sit for a while. Mouthfeel is viscous, a little too bubbly for my taste, and the alcohol has a numbing effect on the tongue. Alcohol makes it hard for this to be drinkable. I really like the flavors presented here, and I find this pleasantly more roasty than their Czar, but it's way too young to be on the shelves.

Deep dark chocolate pour, with a coffee and cream head. Flavor is the most ridiculously power packed punch. Im surprised how easy it is for me to recognize the distinct character of the brewers yeast, in a sultatory sugary and planty presentation. The intense pack carries both a sweeping cream of bourbon vanillas and a rich deep oak char, followed by characterful fruit, yet its so cloyingly sweet I cant believe it. It blows me away. The palate falls away as almost unattenuated and slightly too hot, but the alcohol carries this incredible nutty profusion over the currents on a bright profusion of intense dates, apricots and cherries. All around some of the most intensely packaged beer. Even the juniper comes through, before flourising out in an intensley packaged presentation, with a fresh hop finish. Wow on the flavor.

Roasted malts, currants, black cherry, anise, gooey caramel, burnt malts and booze. The taste brings some of this goodness over. It's quite boozy from the start, in the middle and at the end. And it's pretty sweet too. Boozy sweet doesn't usually do it for me, but this is drinkable and does have some redeemable qualities. Black licorice and spiked fruit punch come to mind. Some of the burnt caramel aspects. Roastiness. The body is light for the style. Light-medium I'd say overall. I would expect a lot more body and viscosity in a beer like this. And the alcoholic sting lingers after the swallow. This isn't one I'd need to revisit, even if it were only $3 instead of the $6 I paid for it. It's not a bad beer, just not one of my faves.

The smell is very deceptive and does not prepare you for what you about to endeavor upon. At first sip, all I could do was smack my lips...they were covered in a sugary taste, like eating maple-sugar candy. I then realized that the sweetness reminded me of chocolate covered espresso beans. That bit of sweetness followed by a roasty, nutty coffee flavor. There is also a mild resemblance to dark chocolate rum cordials. I think that I will be sipping on this for a while. This is a must have, especially if you have been following the demon series.

The finish becomes more roasted with a dry mocha taste and hint of cherry. Initially it burns going down but gets better after the first few sips. At 15% ABV it's not too bad, and could easily pass for 10%. The mouthfeel is fairly thick, but maintains a good smoothness, not chewy. Decent amount of carbonation.

The roasted malt comes through with a silkiness in flavor and feel. Coffee flavors remain mellow, yet strong. Sherry and soy sauced decorate the fringes. Cherries, dates, figs, plumbs, and a hint of vanilla liven the beer a lot. Sweet and strong alcohols compliment the brew from sip to finish without becomming overly harsh.

This one is all about thick and sweet aromas. Incredible. Flavor is big and sweet. Initial sip brings lots of molasses and brown sugar sweetness with some very solid raisin notes. This moves very rapidly to a full coffee infused with sweet chocolate, finishing with a touch of almond to sherry-like flavors. I enjoy this one a lot. The mouthfeel damn thick and with a lot of syrupyness. Carbonation is really light to nearly absent. Even with the warming in my stomach and the swimming in my head, this one remains drinkable.

In the end this beer ends up being a bit too cloying, after the first 4oz it becomes a chore, even a 12oz bottle of this is too much. I think there is some potential here; I can actually see this getting quite a bit better with age, what complexity this beer currently lacks, will be added to and made better by some years of aging and subtle oxidation.

4.03,-4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Smells of dark roast grains and some chocolate. A hint of sour from black patent and some grassy co-ho from hops. Tastes of alcohol burn over a dry roast and woody. The alcohol umph is typical of Avery offerings. Stingy and fairly clean of the rougher off-alcohol edge. In addition to the dark grains, I get some green apple and a hint of smoke. A malt sweet saves this beer. Now, I'm not saying this is a sweet beer, I'm saying there is enough wet to keep the dark grains and alcohol intruging, rather than dominating and intrusive. Yeah, Adam Avery knows WTF he's doing. A nice offering. This is the kind of intense stout I'd like to homebrew...minus the potent alcohol. I see this beer doing well in my cellar, so I need to find a way to afford a 12-pack.","mentor","Feb 07, 2006"
4.22,0.5,5,3,4.5,5,4.5,"You really have to slip this slow. The alcohol can burn out some of the other flavors, but as you sit with it and sip tons of different flavors pop out. There is complexity to spare, but personally the alcohol isnt well hidden. It really hammers the throat and that is hard for someone who is naturally a fast drinker. That and the vaguely meaty aroma are the only off points.","Jredner","Feb 06, 2006"
