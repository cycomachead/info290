It is certainly unique & complex and all that jazz, just not for me.  It reminds of a camp fire after it has been rained on.  The bourbon / oak / vanilla is mixed in there somewhere but the charred elements overwhelm it.","ajm5108","Tuesday at 06:27 PM"
4.52,-1.7,4.25,4,4.75,5,4.5,"This is a 2012 bottle that has been sitting in my cellar for about 2 years  at this point.  The beer itself pours with NO head at all, almost no ringing at all.  The beer is inky black, not redness on the edges here.  The nose is rather subdued here, unlike most stouts, I have no hint of coffee at all.  There is some mild candied fruit, but it is very mild.  The taste is  a bit malty up front, quickly fades to some very sweet malt, and then fades with a lingering boozy sweetness.  This beer has great mouthfeel and is silky smooth.  Beer is a bit boozy, but nothing extreme.  Its also a bit sweeter than anything that I am used to but its not bad at all.  Its an interesting beer, but nothing I would buy again.","Bowdoinbeerboy","Tuesday at 06:20 PM"

But also, strong bourbon.  That smell mellowed a bit over time. Flavor was similar to smell.  The bourbon mellowed a bit during the middle but reappeared toward the end.  The mouthfeel redefined what a score of 5 is to me.  Incredibly smooth, creamy, thick, lush.  I do not care for a strong bourbon taste and this has it, even though it's a bit mellow, but I would drink this again just for how it feels!  If you like bourbon aged stouts, I strongly suggest you get ahold of this beer.","marieli","Mar 12, 2015"

The smell is harder to describe, but you can tell it will be worth your while. Upon tasting this masterpiece of a beer, one is immediately overwhelmed by the flavor of bourbon and vanilla. This will be a wonderful experience, of course, if you appreciate bourbon. Such was the case for me. The mouthfeel was indescribable. Silky smooth yet effervescent at the same time. This is absolutely a world class beer!","LoganRyanMurphy","Mar 09, 2015"

Balance is reasonable, all things considered, as the other flavors pop in the middle.  It begins with bourbon over a rich caramel and chocolate sweetness.  As the bourbon fades, alcohol comes to the forefront.  In the middle, the alcohol flavor masking effect fades and the complexity of this stout becomes discernible.  Waves of vanilla, sweet chocolate and slight plum cascade over an oak background.  The finish is a slow fade of sweet caramel and vanilla over a receding oak.  The finish leaves that burn at the back of throat, an astringent alcohol pucker and a touch of sweet caramel and chocolate.","tillmac62","Mar 06, 2015"

4.75,3.3,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,"The Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout gets its reputation for a reason.  It is a full tilt face melting drinking experience that starts at your lips and rides down your throat grabbing every pore of your internal orifice on its way.  The beer poured an opaque black with a subtle tan head.  The bourbon aroma hit me when I opened the bottle and continued to waft from the glass as I leaned in for my first anticipatory sip. I also detected vanilla and hints of anise coming from the glass. The taste took over my mouth with a huge hit of bourbon that melded into large doses of vanilla and cocoa. There was a slight burnt bitterness at the tail end that lingered along with the bourbon.  The BCBS was a big bourbon bomb that was surprisingly smooth and drinkable considering the ABV.  With more and more Bourbon Barrel-Aged beers on the market it is still at the top of the list and one that should be emulated.  In the end: You don’t drink a BCBS, it drinks you.","brurevu","Mar 05, 2015"

Smells of caramelized sugars with hints of roasted malts, vanilla and booze.  Tastes are dominating by complex vanilla flavors from the barrel and the bourbon.  Stout or coffee is barely noticeable.  Sort of like a smoother 3 Brothers Resolute but not 14 Surly Darkness Rye Barrel Aged smooth.  Lots of alcohol but subtly hidden.  Ridiculously drinkable high ABV beer.  Medium bodied in the mouth.  Not as thick as you would expect.  Silky.  Not the best beer I have had (14 Surly Darkness Rye Barrel Aged) but not far either.  It's up there. Extremely good beer and one you would age and enjoy for years to come. World class.","uvachief","Feb 10, 2015"

Poured aggressively but no head and only a slight few bubbles of carbonation made it to the surface.  Black as night and thick like molasses.  The aroma had subtle hints of vanilla, licorice, phenol, wood, and of course bourbon.  Taste was sweet, big and bold like the smell with maybe even raisins and chocolate covered black cherries mixed about the heat of the booze. Thick, creamy, and coated the palate beautifully.  I must say I had my doubts since I've been let down before; but BCBS did not disappoint!  I loved the experience and since it's a rather big beer it is a delightful sipping stout.

The bourbon was foremost, but it wasn't drowning in booze as I had expected, and was mixed with sweet notes of molasses and a hint of coffee. Delicious.

4.63,0.7,4,4.75,4.5,5,4.75,"Tastes of earthy, wooden, toasted malts, mingled together with an unbelievable chocolate creaminess, giving this beer its incredible smooth mouthfeel. Even though this is a sipper, it drinks fairly easy, as the alcohol isn't hidden, but a fundamentaly, well integrated aspect. The Bourbon builds up on the palate above the malt and chocolate foundation, inviting sweeter flavors of molasses, toffee and nougat to the taste, which not only provide a well fitting depth, but also are responsible for wrapping up any alcoholic burn in a very pleasant way, providing a rich, complex, slightly burning Bourbon character with oaken qualities to it. These then again blend well into the malts, leading to a sweeter finish, with a subtle coffee bitterness in the end, calmed by lots of bakers chocolate, exiting with a short, sharp bourbon bite.","aleigator","Dec 19, 2014"

The aroma is rich with coffee and roasted malt and the tongue follows with similar flavors and others all blended together to make a unified whole that is unfathomably deep. It's viscous velvet on the tongue with no alcohol burn at all, just a gentle warming. Low carbonation. Full bodied is an understatement. One of the most remarkable stouts I've ever tasted.

I bought a regular 16oz bottle for around $7 and served it in a snifter as suggested on the back. I split it with a friend cause we where excited about this beer. We had trouble finishing it.

Although this is clearly a 5.0 beer regardless of vintage and one which has aged well, I will prefer my BCBS fresh...giving my nod to the 2014 vintage for its more 'extreme' aroma/flavor profile.

I also aged a couple of bottles a year later but again held up on a review because I felt I didn't appreciate the style enough to do the beer justice.  Well, now it's the end of 2014 and I recently had BCBS on tap, and I'm here to say with the rest of the BA's that this beer is outstanding!  The depth and subtleties of the bourbon flavor make it a complete stand out.  I only wish I had saved the 2012 coffee bomber I had because now I could have enjoyed it properly!","ELS","Dec 07, 2014"

5,8.7,,,,,,"2014 vintage. Midnight black with a dark tan head. Only thing I've seen darker would be Ten Fidy. Smell is strong, rich bourbon. Some sweet chocolate is faint in the nose. Taste is bourbon up front with some strong heat from the alcohol. Not as much alcohol bite as I expected but a very present alcohol warmth. Finishes with strong chocolate bourbon notes. I'm currently burping what feels like a glass of bourbon neat. Mouthfeel is unbelievable. Like velvet chocolate and rich toffee. Silky smoothness rounds off the strong first taste. Definitely changes as it warms/my taste buds become accustomed. More pronounced chocolate and roasted malts coming through without the boozy bourbon. This is such a complex beer and so perfectly brewed to be ready and enjoyable at just a month or so old while also standing up to time with the best. Can't say outright that it's the BEST BA stout I've had, but short of a 2010 Abyss last week and maybe the Barleywine variant with a year on it (I prefer it over the coffee) this is as good as it gets.","ILMbrew","Nov 30, 2014"

Huge viscous aromatics that almost seem to stick to your nostrils coupled with the deep char, bourbon, and vanilla overtones on the palate. The mid-palate is mindboggling, concentrated flavors and full bodied texture. Not very many high octane stouts keep you going back for more, this one does.","mtboozeaddict41","Nov 30, 2014"

The smell is full of flavor from dark plums, a bit of wood and bourbon, light vanilla and coffee. Very good set up to the taste. The taste itself was very layered and complex. Wood and bourbon with a bit of alcohol, light sweet fruits like dates and plums, coffee and dark chocolate. It has it all and nothing seems to overpower anything else too much. This is a wonderful beer and I can see that most of the fawning over getting a bottle is very much justified.","WhiteHillsStore","Nov 29, 2014"

I am not a fan of bourbon so this was a stretch for me -trying one without aging.

The flavours & smell were wonderfully complex but fell short of being overpowering, the taste in particular being a real treat. Amazing stuff, I'll definitely be picking up another couple bottle of this when I next see it in the UK; just incredible.","flyingpig","Nov 28, 2014"

I said then and I say now that BCBS is the best beer I have ever encountered.  Pitch black color, creamy, velvet mouthfeel and tremendous chocolate, roast and bourbon flavor.  A true sipper, amazing amount of flavor in each sip.  Booze is not overpowering but is felt in your mind almost immediately.  Lucky enough to attend a Goose Island tap take over at a local bar (Nov '14) and thoroughly savored 2.5 more delicious 12oz pours.  Looking forward to the release of the '14 edition.  Very lucky I live in Chicago. Salute.","Guas11","Nov 25, 2014"

Dark gold rim of foam settles on top at the end of the pour. Heavy bourbon aroma upon the pour and as it settles in the glass. Initial sip is like a punch to the face. Whiskey and maltiness followed by a minor burn of alcohol. I enjoyed it more and more with each sip. The mouthfeel is extremely heavy. Coats the mouth and tounge. Beautiful stout. I don't know if it's worth sitting outside all night to wait for. However, it's probably the best stout I've ever tasted. If you're a stout enthusiast then you need to find this beer.","elped83","Nov 15, 2014"

Aroma is a rich dark roasted chocolate malt, dark dried fruit of raisins plums, has strong sweet bourbon barrel alcohol essence with some wood barrel undertones. Taste is a sweet rich dark bourbon alcohol flavor with a bit woodsy notes, some chocolate and dark fruit raisin, plums, some vanilla notes, roasted malt and bitterness on the end. Palate is a full rich creamy viscous body, leaves a bit of an oily resin mouth feel, but smooth going down. Seems a bit heavy on the bourbon though, a bit overpowering on the alcohol. Leaves a long lingering flavorful sweet bourbon alcohol flavor and a bit of woodsy vanilla notes on the end. This is definitely one to sip and share on a cold winter eve.","Samp01","Sep 29, 2014"

Maybe some raisin smell too. Very complex aroma. French toast maybe? Sweat, yummy taste. Wow is this good. Picking up on caramel, raisin, definitely bourbon. At 15%, I thought I’d taste more alcohol but I don’t. Even with taste I’m getting this familiar toastyness, but can’t figure it out. Maybe French toast again. This is very good. Would recommend even though it is pricy.","kkleu357","Sep 03, 2014"

Taste is exactly how it smells, dark fruits, fig, coffee, roasted coffee, sugar cane, bourbon barrel wood taste, tad smokey. My mouthfeel comparison may seem weird, but here goes. The feel on my tongue is the same as when I change motor oil. This thing is oil thick! No carbonation, just smooth, oily, goodness. All in all, the only down side is the abv per 6oz. Clocking in at 14% this is not something you should drive to get at a bar. I wish they made this more available through notable contracts such as Stone and give a case to the higher selling contracts. It would be safer to drink this in a place you don't have to drive after is all I'm getting at. Worth trying. Get it if you can.","santomark","Jul 15, 2014"

5,8.7,5,5,5,5,5,"Overall - If you enjoy bourbon and stouts, then this is an absolute must. In my opinion, this is the bar by which this style should be rated. If you come across this beer, go ahead and try one fresh - but do yourself a favor - cellar the rest of them, at least a few 4-paks. As with most imperial stouts, age is a wonderful thing, and will allow all of the flavors to mellow and mature. The only possible "knock" I could possibly give is for appearance, but you're not going to get a big frothy head and great retention on a 15% ABV beer. With that said, I will not penalize it for something it can't be, and I'm giving it all 5's. I may be a bit biased as I enjoy a good bourbon, and I love impy stouts... and this is nirvana.","blackcompg","Jun 29, 2014"

I've heard of Goose Island, but when I was out an saw it on the menu with 15% ABV next to it's name, I thought, wow, I should try that. I was amazed. I then looked into it and quickly realized it's one of the most sought after beers. I thankfully eventually stumbled across some moths later at $15 per bottle. I reluctantly bought 4, knowing I was being ripped off, but didn't care. This one I'm reviewing is my second of the four, leaving two left to age.","EvoRich","Jun 05, 2014"

FWIW the only 2008s I have got straight from a store that cellared them so these were cellared very well. I RARELY give any attribute of a beer a 5 so that tells you how much I love this stout but as most can attest it is hard to beat a 2008 BCBS.","TheBeerDrinker","May 08, 2014"

Taste is full but I didnt feel that the beer was a thick viscosity.Be ready for the alcohol content which is very apparent on the finish. I sipped on this for about 45 min and even though it went from cold to about room temp in that time it was enjoyable to the last drop.

It was served a bit too cold, as most incredible craft beers are, but I couldn't resist the first sip anyway. WOW. This stuff is awesome! I steadily warmed the snifter in my hands to wake up some of the cold coma induced flavors that hid bundled within, shivering from the "typical darn right chilly" environment from which they were stashed. Patience is difficult for one with un-medicated ADHD, but knowing this stuff had so much more to offer, I persevered with the warming and enjoyed every last sip of this magical elixir.

A must have for any beer appreciator. Aggressive, full, and boozy, it hits everything a bourbon barrel stout should be, and hits all marks with perfection, or as close to perfect as any beer can be. It's also readily accessible (on Black Friday). Buy as much as you can when you see it.","Trifecta1","Mar 11, 2014"

Smells like bourbon, wood, chocolate, toasty malts, dark fruit. Smells great. The taste is a bourbon bomb. All bourbon upfront and a nice heated bourbon on the backend. Also notes of dark chocolate and the barrell. Nice slick mouthfeel, medium, a somewhat easy drinker at such a high abv. The bourbon hangs around for a while on the aftertaste. A little bit of sweetness, too. Warms you right up. Very good bourbon aged stout. Could not be happier that I was able to get a case. Had a year old one on draft and it had even more flavor and was smoother. Less heat and more stout flavors and the bourbon was a bit subdued. Fresh, or aged, it's great.","Mikeypnh","Feb 22, 2014"

The smoothness of the beer actually carries the bourbon aromatically and really limits that "bourbon bite". Its taste certainly isnt brief but doesnt not stain the mouth with a lingering taste. It's high ABV is indicative of the subtle sweetness behind the chocolate and caramel. If you can find this beer, go for it. Its one of the best bourbon stouts.","CHSeattle1","Feb 17, 2014"

The aroma is an intense raisin-prune and light licorice malt composite with a touch of the bourbon you expect. Luscious. The flavor jumps all over these same ideas with deep dark fruits and licorice malt and the tasteful blanket of bourbon throughout. This masterpiece is full bodied with fair carbonation for the style and presents a thick, stick to your ribs feel going down. Pretty impressive although I always prefer these beers minus the bourbon/whiskey flavors myself. Not my favorite mix but I expect I'm in the minority. Well done GI!","Durge","Feb 07, 2014"

4.69,2,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.25,4.75,"Overall I loved this beer and I thought that it is a very good example of the style and I think it lives up to it's reputation, everything I want in a strong barrel aged stout was there and the combination of the aromas, taste, and mouthfeel just made it feel luxurious. This beer had nice drinkability, yeah it's on the sweet side and yeah it's boozy, but to me both aspects never get too out of hand, it was fairly smooth, warming, rich, fairly filling, and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, I would be perfectly fine sipping on a bottle of it and I think one is pretty much the perfect amount for me, I think it makes a great winter time beer, especially on a cold and snowy day in mid Michigan like today. What I liked most about this beer was the taste and aroma, they were both awesome and very memorable, that toasted coconut aspect set it apart. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there wasn't anything that I would change, but do wish I could actually buy this locally, but my part of Michigan always gets way less then it should and I don't think I've heard of any shop within a 50 mile radius that has got any. I would for sure buy this beer if I ever saw it, I would get as much as I could and I would recommend it to anyone who likes barrel aged Stouts, it's about as good as it gets. All in all I was very impressed with this beer, I really like Barrel aged Stouts and to me this one embodies the spirit of what a great sipping beer should be. KBS and Blacknote were my favorite barrel aged Stouts, but after trying this beer it's pretty clear that this is now my #1. Awesome job guys, keep up the world class work.","StoutHunter","Feb 01, 2014"

Mind you, that would take loads of class given the experience those stouts presented myself. But never once did I have in mind of comparing BCBS with anything I've had before. I don't think beer should be compared rather than all of it appreciated. But after having a fresh BCBS I can say with complete honesty that its simply one of the best stouts ever brewed. Is it the best? I've had so many its hard to say. What I can say is that BCBS deserves its respect as a true pioneer and great example of what brewing is today in the great country we live in. I just can't give Goose Island enough respect for such an outstanding BBA stout. I suppose I should give InBev a bit of applause as well given there is a whole lot of us who wouldn't have had BCBS in stores without the expansion. So while they didn't create this gem, they did ensure a whole lot of us got a pack in 2013. And I say keep it coming!","BradtheGreat7","Jan 19, 2014"

It tastes like a big stack of smores mixed with some rich fudgy brownies. You still get quite a bit of alcohol taste on the finish but it is not overpowering like in the aroma. Moderate bitterness and the higher alcohol presence helps cut the sweetness to a nice level where is able to be the star of the show and flourish but never be cloying. I can't believe this is 14.9% ABV, I was expecting this to be a lot boozier than it was.","Hoptometrist","Jan 04, 2014"

I think that there are better examples of a bourbon stout right here in Chicago at Revolution Brewery, but they are better because of the lower ABV which allows you to pick up the other flavors a bit more, and experience the best of what this style has to offer.","barryjr8883","Jan 04, 2014"

But, I'm not into beer primarily for its looks, but its flavor, and this monster in incredible! It's a black mystery at first look and then the first (and subsequent) sips reveal all the underlying depth and complexity of robust dark malts, a well-balanced big booze presence that does not overwhelm things, the whole thing being deep and complex yet easily satisfying.","beergoot","Jan 03, 2014"
4.56,-0.9,4.25,5,4.25,5,4.5,"BCBS pours like almost a syrup. Nice thick looking beer although very little head. The smell is unreal, delicious with a hint of alcohol, probably due to high alcohol content. Just as tasty as it smells but you can certainly notice the alcohol, but at 14% it gains bonus points overall. Great beer and actually not a bad value due to high alcohol content. Will definitely treat myself again in the future.","JamieDuncan","Jan 03, 2014"
4.18,-9.1,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"One of the few heavier stouts that I could constantly keep on chuggin if it weren't for a little sickness/alcohol poisining. Never got my hands on it before and lo and behold it's on tap one time only at local pub so had to have it. Poured a black body with decent sized head that died slow with minimal lace patches. Smell is a cross between old indian cherry bourbon (actually whiskey) and vanilla, oak, roasted malts, chocolate. For such a boozy and heavy beer I find that this beer has an incredible smoothness and is so easy to drink. I get bourbon, booze, woodiness, chocolate, some roasted graininess, vanilla, even some dark fruits like black cherry or figs (minimal, mind you). I didn't really get any ABV burn but it didn't take me too long to sip on this (never really warmed). A definite must try.","clayrock81","Jan 03, 2014"

The smell is all bourbon with a slight hint of chocolate and malts. The taste is very smooth with great bourbon flavor followed by that very slight chocolate kick. Mouthfeel was on the thicker side. The bourbon def stays for a bit. Overall this is a great beer. Great beer to just sit back and relax with.","NHbeerguy","Dec 22, 2013"

Shit, craft beer has definitely changed from those days and I longed to have access in So Cal to Bourbon County once again. This was the year and the beer did not disappoint. Today's price is almost that for a 12 ozer but damn this is a good beer. Here's to hoping the pipeline to So Cal opens up even more so I can have continued access to this gem.","IKR","Dec 22, 2013"

Poured black as night into a tulip glass. Overwhelmingly power smell of alcohol specifically bourbon eminating from the glass. Slight brown head. Small amount of carbonation at the top stops fairly short after the pour. Not many bubbles lasting the entire two hour journey. Very powerful on the tastebuds. Robust malt flavor, with hints of chocolate. It's almost like drinking a hard alcohol beverage. Leaves legs on the glass as if it were a Cabernet from Napa Valley. I recommend to all and would say yes, it's worth the $9 a bottle, but next year if it crept up to $10 a bottle I'd opt for something else.","Ryanm1","Dec 21, 2013"

On the nose, this beer is boozy with dark chocolate, a touch of dark roast coffee, oak, vanilla, and chocolate covered raisins running across the nostrils. Soft toasted coconut and a touch of pralines and toffee also make it into the rich nose of this beer, but at its base, this beer is all about the boozy bourbon character which comes through beautifully. I’m getting the sense of a boozy, chocolate covered pretzel for some reason… On the tongue, the beer tastes boozy hot, and sweet with a drying boozy finish. The heat begins a little too hot but is smoothed out by the chocolate sweetness, while mild tannins dance at the finish alongside a roast bitterness, and just a hint of hop bitters as well before the booze makes one last hurrah. In flavor, the beer begins briefly as hot fusel alcohol, morphing into rich and boozy bourbon it develops flavors of vanilla and oak and then the stout comes through giving dark chocolate, raisins, molasses, and then chocolate milk flavors. The finish is hot with alcohol while mild tannic wood presses through alongside slight charred smoke, the finish eventually unfolds further stout characteristics, but only after the heat has moved down the gullet. A touch of char comes through in the aftertaste. In the mouth, the beer feels perfect for the style. It is richly full in body, like milk or even heavy cream, with a soft carbonation that is nearly nonexistent. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and silky with a thick chewiness that completes the beer. After the beer leaves, the mouth is left tingly with alcoholic burn, yet dry with only hints of salivation at the sides of the mouth. Overall, this is BCBS, a classic of the Bourbon Barrel Aged Stouts, and it is a great beer. I personally would sit on my bottle for a little while longer as the heat is a little too hot for me right now. The beer is rich in everything you want from a barrel aged stout, though, and is a damn fine beer. This is a whale worth hunting down.","Maxwell","Dec 11, 2013"

Pretty syrupy and ranges on Dark Lord sweetness the more this warms up. At the same time, the flavor is pretty top notch, but perhaps this is best when aged.

As you can see, it is higher in alcohol so splitting it with someone would be allowed (maybe even encouraged). There is nothing like a tasty, hardy, stronger stout on a cold winter night and this is the perfect beer for that. I also put one aside (had to hide them from my brother-in-law) and will crack it open next holiday season.","NERM","Dec 10, 2013"

Deep opaque black with a thin chocolate colored head. Head lasted well under a minute. No lacing, but some sticky legs. Lots of vanilla, bourbon and molasses in the aroma. Not much else in the nose. Nice bourbon warmth throughout the taste without it being overpowering. Typically I don't like a ton of bourbon booziness in a stout, but this holds it up extremely well. Bourbon taste without the booziness. Nice vanilla sweetness in the front with some toffee and chocolate up there as well. Mid-palate is some of that molasses with the bourbon and earthy oak at the end. You certainly don't get any of the 14.9% abv in this bad boy. Mouthfeel is nicely viscous without being thick, very low carbonation. Great beer...but I am slightly underwhelmed by all the hype.","mverity","Dec 09, 2013"

Sparse, filmy surface coat of tan colored head. Looked oily and thick when poured. Aromas of vanilla, oak, booze, cocoa nibs, and mocha coffee. Very rich, very robust, and very inviting. Flavors are very roasted and bitter on the forward tongue, but with a subsequent vanilla and cream character that provides an amazing balance. Chocolate notes, bittersweet, present mid-tongue, with more of the woody and booze characteristics coming, as well. Building warmth as you drink, as a 14.9% ABV is wont to do. The body is velvety smooth, and supports all the rich and robust character perfectly. Rich, bitter roasted aftertaste, with coffee, vanilla, and booze all lending themselves to a linger. The finish is smooth, but boy does it finish slow, which is exactly how you want this beer to leave your palate. This is a heavy beast, and a sipper to be sought after. Great beer.","GarthDanielson","Dec 09, 2013"

Goose Island prints on its label that it can age over 5 years in the bottle. I don't doubt that, and I'm excited to see how my other 7 bottles will develop over time. If you're on edge about trying one, I suggest you buy/trade for one now. Cheers!","oN3xM","Dec 01, 2013"

The beer is pitch black in appearance exactly what i expect to see in an stout only disappointment is there was no real head to speak of, but at 14.9% what do you really expect. Now on to the taste 1st on the tongue you get the taste of oak followed by notes of maple, dark chocolate and roasted coffee. At 14.9% you really don't taste the alcohol the only thing you really get is a slight warming in the back of the throat to give you some warning of the alcohol content of this beer. Overall really complex beer so complex I really dont think I can put it in words, you defiantly have to try this beer for your self, well worth the hype.","timahood32","Dec 01, 2013"

4.65,1.1,5,4.25,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Starting with appearance... this is the epitome of what a stout should look like. Pours absolute, sheer black, thick and like crude oil with a thin brown head. Zero light comes through even with a 600 Lumen flashlight on the other side of the glass. BLACK. At the very edges, it has a golden hue as opposed to the more common black with a reddish hue. Good lookin beer. Smell is well... bourbon... And lots of it. Bourbon, mild coffee, chocolate and coconut. Like a Mounds Bar... soaked in bourbon. The taste is simply incredible: robust but smooth bourbon comes first with the oak and vanilla you would expect. Bright notes of roasted coffee, molasses, vanilla and chocolate linger well after you finish your sip. The booze is very apparent, but not undesirable. This is a warmer; you feel it in your gut! Feel is heavy, thick but silky smooth. Almost zero carbonation. Coats your mouth and everything else on the way down leaving a boozey warmth wherever it touches. Fantastic beer overall; tons of good flavors, a perfect dessert or sipping beer, and it's affordable to boot. A must try.","Samuel906","Dec 01, 2013"

I had heard so much about this stuff and figured they would change the ingredients, go cheap or just short-change everybody but I am very happily surprised. I place this one at the very top of my list, among the other excellent brews that are just a notch above the very good ones. the flavor hits me the most as it goes down my throat and leaves a thin coating of sweetness. this review lacks the adjectives and descriptions but that is only because it is all already covered by so many others today. my bottle says bottled on Aug 20 and is 14.2%. even the thick label gives it some personality. two down, two to go... and still in the hunt for more...

4.34,-5.7,4.5,4.75,4,4.25,4.5,"2012 bottling year of Goose Island's Bourbon County Stout. This beer has a bit of a cult following but is getting easier to find nowadays. I've had it on tap and thought it was a bit too boozy for my tastes so I was curious to see what a year would do for the bottled variety. The smell is the best part about this beer when you pour it out. Black as night and a minimal amount of toffee colored head which quickly dissipates. The sweet bourbon and chocolate aroma is amazing. Initial sip starts with rich, almost milk chocolate with a tinge of booze. Much better than the alcohol smash of having a fresh glass. Then comes the problem, the beer is simply too darn sweet. The mid-taste profile of this beer is complex for sure with chocolate, vanilla, coconut hints and LOTS of bourbon which I love, but darn is it sugary too. It reminds me almost of the sweet tooth smack of a vintage port wine. It's not undesirable, but just really unbalanced in what is otherwise a really darn good brew. Overall, a 4.5 and a very good beer that is worth seeking out, but I hope you have that sweet tooth! I prefer the bitter, thick chocolate flow of KBS over this, but it is still a tasty beverage.","blackcoyote13","Nov 08, 2013"

As I get closer I get black licorice, molasses, roasted barley and a lingering sweetness from the bourbon. The mouthfeel is thick and sticky. Plum, raisins, roasted barley, and then the burning warmth of the alcohol coat the tongue and gently warm your throat.","Franziskaner","Sep 28, 2013"

Smell is loaded with bourbon, oak and vanilla, bakers chocolates, fudge, incredible roast qualities, a bit of alcohol heat, light coffee as well, an incredible nose in every way. Taste is similar to the nose, roasted malts and bourbon, vanilla, oak, various chocolate flavours, fudge-chocolate chip cookie flavours, a little heat from the alcohol, more bourbon in the aftertaste. Lightly carbonated, big full bodied chewey feel. Just incredible every bit as good as I had anticipated but I still enjoyed BCBCS more, wonderful stuff here.","peensteen","Sep 13, 2013"

The carbonation is flawless and helps to create a creamy texture, giving an ideal mouthfeel for a big stout like this one. The beer is never cloyingly sweet and is mildly hot, unlike some other massive beers I've tried before. I give it very high marks.","MusicaleMike","Sep 07, 2013"

Lots of bourbon on the nose, milk chocolate, leather and booze. Very sweet and warming on the palate. There’s more bourbon, along with chocolate, coffee, leather, cabernet sauvignon grapes, prunes, and black currants…amazingly complex. Smooth and ridiculously creamy in the mouth, this drinks dangerously easy for its ABV. There’s a slight bitterness and also an interesting acidic quality that make all the flavors work together really well.

4.48,-2.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"D - A huge stout, that delivers and then some on the promise of bourbon flavor. But the substantial boozy heat and somewhat straight forward flavor doesn't quite do it for me. Maybe my expectations are too high coming into these reviews for big stouts, but I find them to sometimes be overly boozy and offer a one-dimensional barrel aged character. I taste bourbon and booze, but not a whole lot else, and they certainly don't offer a great deal of complexity. If I wanted a bourbon I'd have a bourbon. But, that being said, this is superb beer and to me pushes the envelope for how far craft beer, especially big stouts, can be taken. But if I had the chance to drink this everyday would I go for it? Probably not. Too much alcohol and residual sweetness for me. A late-night sipper but I certainly couldn't drink this often, and there's no way I could have more than one. A great beer, but as silly as it might sound, I'd take an Old Raspy over this 9 times outta 10.","Converge","Aug 09, 2013"

Taste is incredibly strong, lots of bourbon up front with strong vanilla, and alcohol flavors through the middle and back. Ends with a lingering chocolate flavor. LOTS of warming but the alcohol is not overpowering although very clearly present. Very good but I may not have the palette to discern all the more subtle complexities. It is clearly an insanely complex beer that is done very well and tastes great. That being said I've had other imperial stouts I prefer.","BreweryRun","Jul 26, 2013"

What a great welcome to Chicago as I found a 4 pack in mid May of BCBS bottled in August of 2012 for $25. I find myself looking for more on the flavor side of things as I did not sense any coffee overtones whatsoever. It is truly a bourbon stout though. Big and sweet and quite hot. Lovely.

The main flavors of vanilla and bourbon are still there but it loses something, at least in my opinion. It's also a lot sweeter. If you've never had BCBS it is a must-have for a beer lover.

Definitely a sipper, this guy needs time to develop. I would recommend letting this beer stand at room temp for a little while before diving in. You really can tear apart some of those deeper chocolate/ fruit flavors after its had time to breath a bit. This beer was recommended by a customer and from his description I was really looking forward to trying it. In retrospect I feel like I should thank him the next time I see him, this stout totally lived up to everything he said it would be. You can pick up the aromas of this beer the second you crack the top and the carbonation exhales form the bottle. I got a strong woody/fudgeness going on right off the bat. The pour wasn't all that exciting,(not subtracting from this beer in anyway) a slight fizzy head that dissipated rather quickly to a slight brownish halo, which stuck around a while. Initialing I found the bourbon flavors most prominent, which was nice, I mean it for sure lives up to its name. The best part by far though was after about 20 minutes. That is when it warmed up and the real depth developed. The high alcohol content is alway there, but the balance between it, the strong woody/ bourbon tones, and the chocolately/fruity/stout characteristics really was spectacular. I can see why this beer has a real cult following. I would recommend it to anyone who challenges that beer cant equal the depth wine has to offer!","Tmolaskey","Mar 27, 2013"

Smell is bourbon very strong, with sweet undertones. First sip and taste is...mind-shattering. Incredibly complex, the taste explodes in your mouth with bitter chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, coffee, everything. This is an experience in a bottle. Alcohol comes in at the end to finish with a nice burn, but still a lot less than you'd expect from 15%. Mouthfeel is slick and wet. A glorious beer.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Mar 17, 2013"

4.62,0.4,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"That being said, this type of beer is brand new to me. I never imagined that bourbon and a well-crafted stout could combine to this level of perfection; with devastation looming on each and every side of this creation, the balance that needs to be achieved in order to be delicious is a daunting undertaking. With each successive sip I give this beer my blessing, and yet I might rate this somewhat artificially low just so that I force my hand to adjust the score when I am a more well-rounded and experienced beer drinker. In any case, know this loyal fans, THIS BEER IS OUTRAGEOUSLY GOOD, LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF AN F. SCOTT FITZGERALD NOVEL. But then again, if you don’t like bourbon, I suggest a hard veer away from this monster.","KKB","Mar 12, 2013"

I am not going to go into detail on each and every attribute of the beer, but the taste is the flippin best!!!! The thickness of this stout is great and the bourbon is sl strong and nice and great tasting.

Definitely worth the $8 I paid for a 3 year old bottle. I also have a buddy who has a reserve of 09, so I will buy more in the future. This beer has a serious bourbon bite, but not too alcoholy (if that makes sense). The taste is mild chocolate, VERY light coffee, and mild dark fruits.

The only negative is that it's not a beer to take lightly- open one up when you have something to celebrate or are hankering for a bone-warmer in front of the fireplace- you prepare yourself to take on a beer like this. Don't open one up if you want to hang out with some buddies after work- open up a Zombie Dust or something if you do that- respect BCBS. (4.5)","Stevedore","Feb 03, 2013"

So unassuming in its drab label and 12 oz. classic-style bottle. Pop the top--kaboom! It pours a very dark grayish brown, with a mocha head that barely forms before it completely attenuates. Chocolate syrup, vanilla extract, and oaky coconut on the nose. The mouthfeel is quite viscous and chewy. Smooth flavors of chocolate, vanilla, tobacco, minced meat pie, and oaky bourbon. Alcohol appears midway, bittering the last half and finish a little too much. But, it does temper all the sweetness. Very Parabola-like.","DocJitsu","Jan 26, 2013"

This one's a beast but it's worth taming and savoring for all that she's worth.

I really wish this beer came out West because it truly is worth seeking out or trading for. My local bourbon barrel aged stouts are good, but for a non-California beer BCBS is every bit as good if not better. Be careful though, with its high drinkability and 15% ABV, it's a dangerous little bottle.","radium","Jan 16, 2013"

Nice bourbon and its barrel alongside a nice, rich and sweet chocolate, molasses, and a kiss of vanilla in the finish alongside some nice unaggressive roasted malt. Sweeter than I anticipated, not a critique but an observation. A fuller, velvety and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this beer is phenomenal.

I enjoyed my first bottle last night and I have to admit that it was truly an outstanding bourbon-barrel aged Imperial Stout! The aroma is amazing and it is chewy, creamy, and thick on the tongue. I believe that BCBS is a much better example of what the style should be than Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout. It is one of the few beers that I have encountered that truly deserves all the hype that it has received. I compared it, side-by-side, with a Great Lakes Barrel-Aged Blackout Stout of the same vintage year, and the BCBS was by far, the better beer.

5,8.7,5,5,5,5,5," Initially shocks the palate with bourbonyness, i mean was this aged in barrels or did they just straight up pour a bottle of bourbon in this pig. some oakiness apparent as well but slight. the boozyness is well masked...initially, i will get to that in a bit. then theres all kinds of beautiful gnarly radical goody grandiose cool groovy flavors that all come out and dance around, this stuff is COMPLEX! i get some caramel, toffee, sweet roasted malts and then awesome coffee flavors all perfectly balanced with bourbon and swirling/dancing on my palate. then the enitre time the most exquiset (spelling?) silky smooth mouthfeel ive expirienced... finally after all of those flavors are dancing / battling for the predominant flavor to rise to the top, it continues in the aftertaste wich lingers for well over a minute. FINALLY after about a minute and a half the booziness comes out...slowly...subtley but DEFINATLY there. starts in the back of the throat then works its way slowly down the esophogus warming but not burning as it descends and actually warms the stomach upon contact leaving me blissfully and comfortably numb.... PERFECT BEER IN EVERY WAY! (for this style) wish i could crack open the last kbs thats in my fridge just to do a side by side, im leaning towards this one being the winner in that EPIC battle.","Beerlover","Nov 30, 2012"

At this point the alcohol is still very prominent in the flavor profile and the rest of the flavors have not finished blending together. But, the oak in this beer is very strong and just what I want in a cask aged beer. There is also some good complexity with the dark dried fruit, chocolate, and grain supporting the malt sweetness, bold oak, and alcohol heat. This beer is a “must try” for fans of big bold oak flavors in malt-centered big beers.","Beer_Runner","Nov 13, 2012"

First sip follows the nose with a fiery taste of bourbon that smooths into what you'd expect from a great imperial stout. After several sips I also got hints of black licorice. The smell and taste of bourbon is great and sticks like cigarette smoke.

Smallish fizzy looking dark tan head that does not last long and there is more of a creep down the side of the glass than there is lacing. Smell is a real head turner. Bourbon this smooth is rare. It is balanced by a RIS sweetness and lots of chocolate and coffee. Notes of vanilla and oak, cherries and molasses. Good amount of alcohol but it is exhilarating. Taste is so smooth and complex. All the things that are in the nose but so well integrated it drinks easily and deliciously. A deep chocolate covered cherry body. Lots of wood aged bourbon and lightly singed caramel. Coffee from the nose is latte and cappuccino smooth and mellow on the tongue. Feel is lightly syrupy with a touch of slickness. A perfect carbonation gives enough of a break to your tongue to give a restorative quality. It may be a thick rich luxurious brew but it drinks so easily that it is almost scary. This is an extraordinarily well crafted beer. It has superb flavor, feel, and drinkability. Refined from top to bottom. The nose is seductive. Palate is complex and it develops as it warms.

4.79,4.1,3.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Picked this up from a great trade with muskabeatz (Evan)! An aggressive pour yielded a pitch black body with a beautiful caramel-colored one finger head that unfortunately faded almost immediately with minimal lacing. The nose is nothing short of heaven! As soon as I popped the cap I could smell it. Huge and roasty with tons of bourbon and double chocolate fudge along with hints of coffee, oak, vanilla, booze, and molasses. The taste is just as big and just as bold. Chocolate fudge and bourbon are again the stars along with a ton of oak. And the chocolate is not subtle. It's like eating a chocolate fudge brownie. Absolutely amazing! It's nicely complemented with hints of vanilla, espresso, tobacco, molasses, and a touch of black cherry and smoke. The mouthfeel is smooth as silk and thick as molasses. The finish is spicy with an amazing alcohol burn. Yeah, it's 15%, but I could easily drink another. Bourbon aged stouts are my favorite style, and this is the best I've had to date. Probably the best beer I've tasted!","beerdrifter","Oct 27, 2012"

This is a beer that really blows me away every time and I would recommend this to anyone that has a palate for big imperial stouts and bourbon/whiskey barrel-aged beers. I will also suggest putting aside a few bottles and cellaring them for a few years down the road. They will age very well!","Stoutfan23DJ","Oct 27, 2012"

The nose is dominated by big bourbon booziness and heavy oak barrel with lighter accents of dark fruit. Opens with a blast of bourbon and oak joined by vanilla, raisins, plum and notes of black cherry. Finishes with strong bourbon booziness and more vanilla and oak. Full bodied, low carbonation, smooth and at times syrupy mouthfeel. This beer is a bruiser and delivers exactly as advertised: a big tasty imperial stout that packs an unmatched bourbon punch.","chanokokoro","Oct 26, 2012"

I would almost say it is very well balanced at the expense of complexity - everything comes together so well that it's harder to perceive the different layers. It's pretty easy drinking in terms of not being so intense that it makes you put the brakes on, but it does pack a nice wallop on the buzz front. Very nice. 2013 tasting - Fantastic. Even better than when I had it closer to fresh. Such rich brownie chocolate offset by enough booze to stand up to it, with a touch of cherry something, all in a malty baked goods environment.

The way this sits right now, I think I'd prefer to just pour myself a neat couple ounces of Woodford Reserve. I'm not sure if it was the amount of bourbon in the barrels, the type of bourbon used or the base beer, but something happened on this one. I'll be sitting on the rest of my bottles for a while. The next time I get around to opening an older bottle, I'll revisit this review and hopefully do BCBS justice.","claaark13","Oct 04, 2012"

Nose is spectacular: superlative chocolate ganache, walnuts, amaretto, butter pecan, loads of cinnamon, fatty flank steak, banana bread, savory mild soy sauce. Taste is wildly rich and silky with the superlative imperial stout palate: ultra silk, butter reduction, thick and full. In the body, hot chili peppers linger in the finish with mild warming alcohol like a good bourbon or Scotch. Tastes like someone took a really good imperial stout and put it in a red wine reduction to up the intensity and body. Feels like this was made without strike water...as if Bells Expedition was a watered down version of this. Insanely good. 7/11/2011 9/4/9/5/18=4.5","tarheels86","Oct 02, 2012"

The taste is sweet upfront that then switches over to a slightly smoked flavor with a chocolatey bitterness in the finish.

Definitely worth the $24 4 pack I paid for. It was similar to Dark Lord 2012 in taste but it was much softer. Dark Lord slaps you in the face with these similar flavors while this was way more gentle and balanced with a great finish.

All notes from scent present, bourbon the star backed by lots of chocolate notes, oak/vanilla/coconut notes smooth out the taste, coffee and char notes take a back seat, mild fruit pops up. Towards the end, alcohol pops up and not the bourbon kind... not quite harsh, but noted. Full bodied, not as oily or sticky as had expected, minimal carbonation, maybe a splash more needed.

The aroma has equal waves of dark chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon crashing over my nose. I wish the latter was a little bit less intense than the former two though. The flavor profile is a bit more smooth and nuanced. Dark chocolate is intense up front, only to be met by bourbon, vanilla, and some spicy oak notes. Then, some subtle plum and fig dark fruits come in on the finish. The body is full and rich and creamy, everything I'd want from a big, barrel aged imperial stout. The low to middling carbonation completes the luxuriant mouthfeel. Bourbon County Stout is a superb beer, best described as a milkshake for adults. It's also the main reason I'm excited that Goose Island has come to NJ.","axeman9182","Jul 31, 2012"

Maybe not the best beer to start the night... this one is a doozy and one of the stronger beers I've tried. Yes I know it's 14.5% ABV, but DFH's offerings of this alcohol seem to go down a lot smoother. Anyways... a thick beer reeking of bourbon taste, with a strong alcohol bite.

The nose of this stout might be the best scent I have experienced on a beer. The maltiness and the bourbon somehow morphed into a coconut aroma. I wanted to take a bite out of the glass. The initial taste was a very smooth and sweet chocolate with tart coffee in the background. Also making noise was the vanilla notes produced by the bourbon. The bourbon notes were not as active as I aniticipated. The stout finished with a warming almost sticky aftertaste. This stout was some serious lingering powers.","JohnnyHopps","Jul 04, 2012"

Smell is big and always the same, every time I have this beer. Rich dark roasted malt, rich bourbon with wood and some char, smoke. The dried fruit comes out with a lot of warming. The smell of Chicago is what I always say. Wow. this beer is big, and bigger from what I can see from the last time I have had it. Bourbon is the winner, vanilla from the oak, molasses out the ass, dried fruit with warming. Traces of smoke. All in all a big ass stout. The alcohol comes out kind of a bit and is felt. Drinking this ponied up at the bar is not the place for this if in big pours, but 4oz's yes. At the house a bottle I would dig on for two three hours or so. The body is big and full and rich and hot.

Pours pitch black, no carbonation, a few lazy bubbles rise at the end of the pour, then dissipate; no lacing. Sweet, dark malt and bourbon aroma. Heavy bodied, delicious bourbon, dark malts, chocolate, molasses. A hint of mint at the end? Complex and absolutely integrated. A masterpiece that has aged into a mellower, well blended beauty.

Smell is a wonderful mix of bourbon and chocolate - literally like a bourbon-soaked brownie. It's actually pretty incredible that the aroma isn't very boozy considering how big this beer is. Flavor follows the nose and really takes it to the next level. The bourbon and chocolate flavors really come together perfectly. It's sweet, but not overly so, and it's got a nice little bit of roast in the finish. Very smooth and easy to drink given the ABV. Mouthfeel is very thick and mouth-coating, but still has good carbonation. This is the beer that really taught me that I could love stouts a couple of years ago when I thought stouts weren't for me, so it will always hold a special place in my heart. It's really a phenomenal beer and one that can rarely be beat by other, rarer, harder-to-obtain stouts.","starrdogg","Apr 02, 2012"

There is a lot of complexity in the aroma and the taste and it appears that by aging, the harshness of the alcohol has been completely diminished (it is hardly even noticeable).","dbrauneis","Apr 01, 2012"

To me, this is the epitome of aging beer in wood. You absolutely get the bourbon character but it isn't overpowering. And, the beer is incredibly integrated. I buy bottles whenever I can, but I'll never forget my first experience, which was on tap at Brasserie V in Madison Wisconsin. It was love at first sip!","ProfPayne","Mar 21, 2012"

4.62,0.4,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2011 vintage bottled 11/11/2011. Pours viscous pitch black color with a small tan head that fades away to a ring of lace quickly. A fair amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big bourbon, caramel, dark chocolate, toffee, roasted malt, molasses, vanilla, oak, and a touch of herbal, and booze. Damn nice and complex aromas, and hardly boozy at all. Taste of huge dark chocolate, caramel, toffee, bourbon, vanilla, oak, molasses, roasted malt, butterscotch, and a touch of herbal earthiness. Hardly any bitterness noticed on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, chocolate, bourbon, and molasses on the finish for a bit. Fantastic balance of flavors; with absolutely no cloying sweetness. Light-medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a huge creamy and lush mouthfeel as expected. Definitely a sipping beer, but is surprisingly smooth for 14.5%; with only a warming alcohol presence on the finish. Overall this is a phenomenal barrel aged imperial stout. As it warmed up it got much more smooth and complex.","superspak","Feb 26, 2012"

Mouthfeel is extremely thick with no carbonation/foam. The taste is crazy. There are a ton of levels to this. First I got dark chocolate when it my the tongue, then the boozy oak on the swallow and then roasted coffee on the finish. It was in that order distinctly. There was just a touch of heat on the back in but it dissipated fairly quickly. Overall, I really like this beer a lot but it isnt one that i would put in my top 5, although for sure top 20.

Big time bourbon in the aroma, along with scents of roasted malts and semi-sweet chocolate. Huge complexity in the taste, with obvious notes of bourbon-drenched oak up front, accompanied by some alcohol warmth. Mid-palate brought in notes of chocolate-covered cherries, dark malts, vegetal vanilla bean. A huge coffee profile in the finish. Incredibly smooth mouthfeel, full-bodied and robustly chewy.

4.5,-2.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"2009. Poured very aggressive into a 20 oz giant Duvel Tulip. Pours so black, with a huge 3 inch mocha head that settles quickly into a tan film, with no lace at all, but not surprising. Smell is Bourbon, burnt coffee, dark chocolate, smoke, and some licorice. Taste is all of those things with Bourbon being dominant, but not in a bad way. Body is big, but not insane. Good amount of life for it's size and it is a supper that should be cherished. It is amazing how much you look forward to the next sip and you realize that this beer would scare the shit out of the average beer drinker. Such a memorable beer.","SawDog505","Dec 24, 2011"

It fizzled out very quickly and left no lacing at all. This is liquid cherry cordial on the nose, with just a tad of vanilla. The booze is definitely hanging out behind everything else, but so so so muted. A bit woody as well. Taste follows nose, with a quick blast of the cherry cordial. Again, the abv is there but is hidden beautifully. Surprising amount of snap on the carbonation, but it doesn't impact the mouthfeel at all. Syrupy but not in a bad way. This is a sipper, and it will slam you, but it is truly fine. Glad I have another bottle poised and ready for Christmas Eve.

Don't quite know if it's the best I've had, I'd have to do some serious side by side by side by side by side tasting to determine that. Let's just say this is one superb, world-class beer that everyone really should try. From what I remember of the last time I had this 2009 vintage, this beer is aging wonderful and just seems to grow more and more complex as it ages. Can't wait to have some 10 or 11. I didn't look back at the first review before this one and the only discrepancy between the two came in the overall rating where I gave it a 5.0 in the first review and a 4.5 here. I think here it's really more deserving of a 5.0 overall score, so that's what I'm going with.","matttttYCE","Dec 17, 2011"

4.29,-6.7,4,5,4,4.5,4,"D/O: It would be easy to gently compliment this beer and move on if it did not represent such a pivotal contribution to the craft beer world. This particular time capsule from 2006 was brewed at a time when spirit-infused and wood-aged beers were almost unheard of, yet it holds its own with the contemporaries of today. The smell is swoon-worthy, delivering some really remarkable dark chocolate even five years on. Other qualities are not as noteworthy, but the predictable flavors are still pleasant enough. It is kind to the palate, with an appropriate amount of spirit coming through in the taste without being hot or fatiguing. While it was a long time in coming, this one was worth the wait.","beagle75","Sep 22, 2011"

Mouth is rich, gooey chocolate brownie, silky feel. Perhaps a touch drier and less intense on the finish than Rare. Fantastic batch, easily the best bottle of this I've had, though I haven't had a lot. Raising my score a bunch.","JAXSON","Sep 12, 2011"
5,8.7,5,5,5,5,5,"O - I'm not sure what else to say. Everyone has to try this beer at least once in their life. Here in Texas we don't get this beer, so I look forward to try the other bottles in my cellar. I'm not sure what it tastes like fresh, but I imagine that a year of aging did this beer some good.

It's a world-class pioneer of the style and doesn't falter in continuing to set the standard.

4.66,1.3,3,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Big thanks to BA BanditBrewingCo for the sample. 12 oz. twist-off longneck, bottled 11/12/09. Brewed with two-row, Munich, chocolate, caramel, roasted, and debittered black malts; hopped to 60 IBUs with Willamette and aged in a bourbon barrel. No sound upon opening - hope it's carbonated. Pours black with just a hint of tan collar and no hope of lacing or head retention at this ABV. Very aromatic, with vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, caramel, toffee, dark fruits, stewed raisins/prunes and perhaps some minty rye from the bourbon. Excellent, but I wish it had a bit more stout character. It is in fact carbonated, and tastes very rich, a little sweet, with notes of burnt caramel, milk chocolate, vanilla, maple syrup, bourbon, spicy oak, peppery ethanol, blackberries, black cherries and raisins. You can just barely find the stout beneath, but it yields roast, dark chocolate and a moderate bitterness. Very thick and viscous on the tongue, lightly-carbonated, quite drying, tannic?, chewy and almost syrupy with a long finish. Even after two hours and nearly flat, the mouthfeel is still fine. Very highly-concentrated and quite complex, with lots of bourbon (wet barrel?) and an effortless drinkability. Almost more bourbon than stout, but this is a wonderful beer that deserves its reputation and could probably age for a decade or more.","mmmbeer","Aug 15, 2011"

I think before this beer hits the bourbon barrels it needs a bit more of a polished and refined base beer to withstand the test of time. Hopefully these bottles will mellow out their sweetness over time, and luckily I have one left to test this theory. For me as this sits now, it's overly sweet and just a bit messy.","ShanePB","Aug 15, 2011"

The flavor starts with a bourbon like quality and finishes with dried fruit and vanilla. The alcohol is very well disguised. If any negative can be said about it (and it's only a slight knock) is that it's a bit toward the sweet side. However, this makes it the perfect after dinner beverage.","LittleDon","Aug 11, 2011"

Big thanks to marine1975 for bringing this one to the tasting! 2009 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Vieille Provisions Saison Dupont Willie. Poured pitch black with a half finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and big sweet alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was pretty freaking tasty! I've had a few of these sitting my cellar for awhile now and have been wanting to tap into them. The alcohol on this one was still a prominent on this one for me. It wasn't overwhelming by any means, but I'm sure there are some more subtle characteristics to this one masked by it regardless. On the nose this one is quite big, but the flavor has mellowed some. Really nice backbone going on here. Really glad I got to try this one!","thagr81us","Apr 27, 2011"

Initially, nothing else is evident, but sitting on this for a bit some oak and vanilla comes through along with a mild, mild chocolate note. Taste drops a massive bourbon bomb on the palate, and hits with some alcohol right away; alcohol burns and tingles the tip of the nose. More chocolate and roast comes through, along with more oak and vanilla sweetness. Very complex integration between these flavours. Body is super full, sticky and very rich, but the flavour is so complex and layered. Outstanding.","liamt07","Apr 23, 2011"

Some roasted malt, charred burnt notes, a bit oaky, but bourbon whiskey dominates. The taste is not as hot with alcohol as the aroma would suggest. Flavors of roasted malt, some chocolate or cocoa, and the bourbon barrel; vanilla, oaksmoke. A nice beer with a background of bourbon, not overpowering alcohol burn. This is a sipper, to be enjoyed slowly.","BigBry","Apr 23, 2011"

It has coffee and dark toast, esp. in the finish, mostly caramelized sweet coffee & prunes, burnt sugar & a slight medicinal cough-syrup quality, esp. at the finish. It is boozy and alcoholic, with a rummy quality, but it is fairly mellow and very smooth and it is not rough or overly boozy, esp. considering the strength. It has some good complexity, with enough depth of character and with no single element overly intense or overpowering everything else. It is quite drinkable and never gets tiresome or boring, despite the fact that it is pretty strong and definitely a slow-sipping drink. It is excellent overall.","Offa","Apr 22, 2011"

Dry, bitter, roasted malt in the finish, with dark chocolate, espresso coffee in there also. As the beers warms the vanilla & bourbon are the dominate flavors. Would pair nicely with a cigar. Low carbonation, with velvety mouthfeel, sticky upfront. It warms the belly as it reaches room temperature. I find this not really complex it's pretty straight forward. Bourbon, charred wood, vanilla, some dark fruits, with dark chocolate & espresso coffee not getting much else. The warmer it gets the more there's just vanilla & bourbon, and starts to get heavy in the mouth. Becoming hot & boozy, more bitter in the finish.

Jesus Christ, I could smell bourbon before I even started the pour. Unbelievably boozey smelling along with some roasted malts. Black licorice and a bit of oak, but bourbon dominates. The taste is surprisingly less boozey and very well balanced. Flavors of vanilla, oak, roasted malts, dark fruits, chocolate and then the warming alcohol. It really is shocking how boozey this smelled but how it didn't taste like a glass of bourbon. This is one heavy, slow drinking beer. This brew had about a year to age and I am curious how it is fresh and also how it is with a few years on it.

The taste was interesting and was not bad by any means. The bourbon was of course up front supported by the sweet malt in the back ground. To me even though the Bourbon was stronger by far I feel they melded together pretty well. The brew was a bit hot fresh.

The bourbon is there, but it's mellowed out a lot in the taste and there is a lot of sweetness from molasses, dark chocolate and some vanilla. The alcohol is evident, but not overpowering, which was nice. The aftertaste leaves a dry, peaty bourbon taste on your tongue that leaves you wanting more, but slowly. Definitely a sipper and one you might want to age a bit.","notchucknorris","Feb 09, 2011"

I decided to try this tonight because i have never had it and i am constantly searching for more. This thing has been begging to be popped since I bought it and i realized that i am not going to get anymore. So pour into a nice chalice with vigor. Beautiful black with a nice off white head. Smelling this beauty is not what i was expecting at all. It reminds me of Jewbelation, which i love. I get big dried fruits, chocolate. Some wood and bourbon. Taste follow nose with a hint if not more of copenhagen snuff. A bit too sweet not at all what i was expecting. Very viscous. And pleasing as it coats my tonguel.

Sweet malts and bourbon are perfectly blended with coffee tastes that leave an incredibly sensational aftertaste that lingers graciously.

The bourbon aroma is much more subdued now than in fresher batches. The taste is just as complex and rewarding as the aroma. Full heavy mouthfeel filled with bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and oak flavors. The bourbon makes a bigger appearance in the taste as it warms but still is not overpowering.

4.62,0.4,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"BCS is an incredible beer. It's relatively easily available and puts many hyped beers to shame. While it's not quite the best barrel-aged stout in the country, it defines the sub-style for me (and, I assume, many others) and has held up very well against a horde of fancified newcomers. The beer is jet black with a healthy brown head, when fresh. The head is much smaller with older vintages. The aroma is big and rich with flavor. There's a ton of bourbon, but it doesn't drown out the dark malt and other barrel notes. Coffee, chocolate, roast, vanilla and oak aromas blend almost perfectly with the bourbon. The taste is strong and assertive but also smooth and luxurious, just as a big stout should be. There's a good deal of booze, but it's a warming, pleasant presence and the beer is better for it. Mouthfeel is smooth and full. Not to take anything away from the base stout, but Goose Island is simply better at barrel-aging than the vast majority of breweries. I don't know if this is experience paying off or if Greg Hall is just a genius brewer who nailed it on his first try, but Goose Island BCS is a modern classic of American beer.","popery","Sep 06, 2010"

Nose of vanilla, chocolate, malt, and, naturally, whiskey. Sweetness features prominently at the start with an alcohol bite at the back. Imperial stout. This is followed by a gentle-but-authentic sweeping bourbon finish. Vanilla all over the aftertaste. A bit of breadiness, perhaps a charred smokiness, as well. Heavier mouthfeel suited to the style.

Hefty mouthfeel, with the ABV really apparant in the body of the beer, along with the barrel aging. This is a sipping beer. There's really no comparing this to anything else on the market.

Taste is ... a loss for words. Vanilla, oak and cocoa but joined with a mouthfeel that is so extraordinary, in it's creaminess and fullness. It only loses a few points to its not quite entirely hidden alcohol that makes it kind of prickly. The best imperial stout I've had so far.","Luk13","Jul 15, 2010"

The color and texture are gorgeous, but the taste is all but offensive. Most of the elements of a nasty sub-par bourbon are present, none of the charming woodsy flavors or alcohol kicks, and all of the foul composty, earthy tones. Something is rotten in this brew.

Not surprising due to the high abv. I don't even need to lean into the glass to smell the bourbon. In fact, when I cracked the bottle cap halfway off I got a big hit of bourbon. It's a little tough to pick up on anything else in this but there are faint aromas of cocoa and roasted malts. Rich toffee lingers in the shadows of bourbon. This really smells nice, but it is predominantly bourbon. Wow! I figured I'd get a lot of bourbon from the smell but this is outrageous! Rich bourbon hits the tongue with notes of toffee, cocoa and coffee. Bourbon really shines through in this one though. The only thing it loses on for me is that I can taste alcohol just a bit, but a 13% bourbon bomb like this I can't be surprised. Wonderfully silky mouth feel. Just enough carbonation and the body is nice and heavy. This beer is tough to drink. It took me three hours to tank through the behemoth! I've had big barrel aged beers, but he bourbon flavor got so heavy at the end it really drank more like a whiskey than a beer.","Bendurgin","Jul 01, 2010"

Sweet chocolaty up front, then the bite of alcohol, dark fruit and more chocolate with some subtle bitters on the finish. Very complex. Has a creaminess to it.

A small brownish tinged head formed but dissapeted quickly, a little lacing but not much. My first sip immediatley I thought of that dark choclate candy that my grandmother used to carry around with her, it was choclate laced with a slight peppery flavor very rich. The acohol is noticable as I thought of some fine moonshine. I sipped my beer for about an hour and didn't finish as the beer is very filling and rich.

While the appearance was nothing spectacular and the feel somewhat off-putting, the nose and taste were done really well. Bold flavors that don't seem out of place, with lots of nuances going on throughout the whole drinking experience. There are some other bourbon BA stouts that fit the bill for their subtle complexities, but this is an in-your-face bourbon stout that will grab hold of you and not let go. If the palate were a little thicker and fuller, this would be one for to write home about. For now, it's just one to check out if you get the chance. Recommended.","Jeffo","Apr 12, 2010"

The aroma will really knock your socks off, with a huge bourbon presence upfront, followed by vanilla and caramel, coconut, burnt bread, some dark fruits, and a big alcohol presence. The flavor is similar to the aroma with big bourbon notes initially, followed by some coconut and vanilla, charcoal, caramel, dates and plums, a little coffee, chocolate and some fusel alcohol. The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety and drinkability is not very good (though you wouldn't expect it to be).

The lace is mostly absent, excepting a few clusters of small spots that slide into into the stout. Density is high! The alcohol is evident and warming. I imagine it would be excellent in a snifter.

The spectrum of scents is so incredible that it could be a vapor course at Moto. The taste demands an hour's repose. Dark, bitter chocolate precedes the vanilla, caramel, smoke and charred notes of fine bourbon. Dried cherries and raisins form in a holy alliance with classic stout traits of coffee and cream. It is thick enough to be a foodstuff. The finish makes me wonder how they bottled silk? This particular day I paired with a 2007 Kentucky Black Gold cigar aged in Woodford barrels for two years. The earthy, mellow notes meld flawlessly with the rich, smoky character of the brew. Yes, this certainly is the greatest cigar beer in the world. And this is why I always have a few cases around.

4.45,-3.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,"Out of a bomber bottle generously provided to me by a BA friend this brew was as thick and dark as molasses. The retention of the head was good and the lacing impressive. Swirling it in my tulip, it moved like chocolate milk, so rich and viscous it was, only black and oily. The aroma was rich and enticing; I smelled chocolate, tobacco, whiskey, oiled leather, coffee, dark caramel and hints of vanilla. The flavor profile was equally complex and robust. Again, I tasted that zip of bourbon whiskey, this time right from the start, followed by the dark chocolate and chocolate syrup flavors. I also tasted leather, dark malt, molasses, coffee, leather, prunes and the alcohol punch. As it warmed up some elements of wood and vanilla appeared reflecting the oak barrel aging. The sharp, punchy elements were off set by the soft, chocolaty elements creating a nice balance. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body full and the carbonation appropriate enough to help it feel full without being heavy. A truly enjoyable brew and well worth going out of one's way for.","thekevlarkid","Feb 16, 2010"

Huge notes of bourbon, malt, malt, and more roasted malt. It's lightly hopped, but heavy on the ethanol. The malt does much to hide its monstrous 13% AVB, but nothing short of a preemptive carbohydrate feast will mitigate it's effects.

I have to take an issue with the alchol burn though, it is the one thing that takes the drinkability down. The KBS i had earlier didnt have nearly as much of a burn and hid the alchol much bettter.

Would like some more strength in the elements besides the whiskey. Tastes of nice cocoa and whiskey blend with some oak and vanilla, a burnt taste at the end adds a nice element. Some brown sugar sweetness is also nice. Mouthfeel is pretty thick and oily. A coat of whiskey cocoa onAa the tongue with some huge heat. Low carbonation helps this kind of beer.

The flavor delivers big sweet malts and a dash of alcohol upfront followed by hints of candied fruit and finishing with a lingering definite coffee flavor layered with chocolates.

Over the top but not in a bad way. Even has the slight alcohol burn that you get in spirits-not like an overly alcoholic beer. Lingering burnt and bitter flavors-deep dark chocolate and roasted malt.

(Can't really detect much of a hop presence, but know it's there to balance out the sweetness of this beer.) The nose is full, sweet, and pretty. The beer has a syrupy texture, alcohol sweetness/burn/tingle, complexity, depth, and a long finish. Overall a very good beer that is extremely thick and syrupy sweet. Due to it's huge alcohol content, the beer is a bit off balanced and not exactly smooth.

Poured into a snifter it pours jet black and thick like motor oil with a one finger dark tan head. The head quickly fades away and leaves little to no lacing down the glass. The smell is whiskey at first and upfront, it's followed by vanilla, oak, and chocolate. It seemed like the 2008 had more of a whiskey smell to it at first and as they warmed up the 2009 became more whiskey smelling and the 2008 had more chocolate when warming up. Taste was whiskey, vanilla, and chocolate. The 2009 had more of a whiskey taste while the 2008 had more of a chocolate taste making the 2008 way more drinkable and pleasant to drink. Both however had some whiskey in the taste it just wasn't as apparent with the age on the 2008. The mouthfeel differed greatly, the 2009 was kind of thin and the 2008 was very full, thick, and chewy. I thought it was pretty awesome how different these were with only one year between them. The main difference was taste and mouthfeel and with the one year it made it from a good beer to a great beer! I've also had this with about six months age on it and it was pretty good. The drinkability depends on this one. Fresh I'd give it a lower score (but still good) but with some age it become great even with the high ABV I'd love to drink a few of these. Overall fresh it's really good but I'd really recommend aging these for at least a year if not longer as it becomes more delicious. I'm going to age a few more of my 2008s for a while and I have plenty of 2009s to age and drink.

Begins with a subtle grapefruit flavor which is followed by robust whiskey/alcohol flavor. Throughout the drink, there is a nice backbone of sweet malt/toffee flavors and a warming alcohol sensation.

There is a strong bourbon, very heavy alcohol and bourbon taste with heavy, dark chocolate and a really full body. Alcohol goes right up the nose and produces some quince and vanilla on the mouth with a slick, but not syrupy, feel.

I am impressed it showed as well as it did considering the ABV. Intense aroma of bourbon, vanilla, caramel, dark fruit, and alcohol. I can tell right now this is going to be a hot one. After one sip, it sure was hot. But there is plenty of flavor to make it worth drinking. A lot of vanilla and bourbon upfront with more subtle notes of chocolate, plums, and toffee. Finishes boozy with a lot of warmth. Full bodied with nice carbonation. If this had anymore carbonation it would be harsh with all the alcohol. This is the type of beer because of ABV and price, that is reserved for special occasions. I will need to save one for just such an occasion.","morimech","Nov 09, 2009"

The coffee and chocolate notes are also very assertive, and the sweet malt notes get swept away but the hops at the finish. The vanilla-laden bourbon flavors linger.

The smell is just all bourbon. A little more bourbon than I was expecting, and its a 2008. I'm not even sure that I can detect anything else with out trying very hard. I mean, if you want a bourbon stout - this should satisfy you. The taste is like sweetened bourbon, with quite a bit of chocolate and a hint of coffee. I get a little hint of sticky malt, but mostly woody, slightly burnt bourbon flavor. Really interesting, and the bit of roastiness cuts the intensity. The body is really great. Thick and heavy, and the alcohol and burntness kind of helps to make it feel thin enough to swallow. The carbonation is dialed back, which is definitely a good thing. The drink is very slow.

What was overbearing sweetness in the Lees, was just right in the GI, even though they were similar. There was an alcohol taste in both, should not have made much difference. Maybe it was the over ripe fruit taste in the Lees, whereas, the GI had a coffee background... I duh no. I just love the Bourbon County Stout. It poured as black as a January midnight in Barrow, Alaska. A modest head that quickly reduced to a collar. The aroma was largely alcohol with some coffee.

It is very, very rich and very, very boozey. The strength of the flavor may take away from it a bit by some. Mouth is also as good as it gets for heavy stouts. Super thick. Viscous like molasses.

There is a lot going on in this beer, more than just booze, which I was somewhat afraid of at first. Much like the smell, there is bourbon up front in the nose, but the sweet chocolate flavor is there, and hints of vanilla and some other sweetness I can't quite put my finger on, but there is more!

Taste is a bit less complex, but substantial nonetheless--the salty teriyaki component is there, roasty coffee beans, creamy syrupy malt. Mouthfeel is very thick and juicy.

I didn't think much of it, and I'm lucky I tried it again, because this beer is fantastic. A deep viscous black and a purposefully agitating pour yeilds a nice brown head, fades. Strong fumes of bourbon, vanilla, tons of roasted malt, chocolate, raisins. This beer is hot but manages to come across as soft and refined, not brash at all. Flavor is pretty spot on. Bourbon up front, plenty of vanilla and oak surrounds a full on roasted malt profile of coffee, chocolate, deep tobacco, dry smokiness, and a delicious cakey flavor. Sweet and fluffy but has a deep char and leather character as well to balance out the sweetness. Somehow the 13% ABV is kept in check and only adds more complexity to this brew. Velvet mouthfeel, full bodied but not too heavy surprisingly. Goes down the gullet all too easily for a beer this big.

Smells of burnt toast that's right on the edge of being still edible, molasses, oak, tons of bourbon, and treacle. Tastes of booze soaked rich roasted coffee beans, plum pudding, raisins, bitter baking chocolate, hint of smoke and a gigantic bourbon sting in the mouth. Yep, the bourbon is still VERY much a part of this experience even after almost three years in the bottle. This could sit for at least three more.

I found it to be better than Kentucky Breakfast Stout. The bottle version requires a little aging to smooth it out. A++","atpben","Apr 09, 2009"

There also is a chocolate flavor in there that tastes like the darkest chocolate I've had times two. Definitely more of an earthy/woody flavor with a sweet dark fruit finish.

There's chocolate and dark licorice and plum brandy. And raisins. And treacle and other molasses-like things. But it's too sweet/thick in the mouth. Ah well.

Slight bitterness through the end with some hops (about in the middle, as far as RISes go), and an absolute coffee blast at the end. The booziness and the coffee are what linger, but the booziness (aged taste) makes you shudder in a great way, not from acrid bitterness, but from how well those flavors merge with everything else going on. First and foremost though, this is a hugely sweet RIS. The sweetness never completely relents, just is tempered into the rest of the flavor. Mouthful is coating, filling, lingering in all the right ways, amazing spunk behind this beer. Pretty creamy, just rolls off the tongue. The ABV doesn't come off nearly as much as in the smell, it hides it better probably than any Impy Stout I've tried so far save Abyss. As it warms, the bourbon aspect comes out more and more, but while it gives a nice kick, i don't feel it really detracts a great deal from drinkability. I think the fact that mine is 2 years old makes this aspect stand out more than it normally would. After drinking, the lingering flavors are like from one of those flavored coffee drinks from Starbucks, except those feel overly sweet and artificial, while this feels hearty, naturally/perfectly sweet and delicious.

The smell is very sweet with caramel and vanilla. The taste is great, like I already mentioned, thick malt presence although not in an overwhelming way, more in the taste. I also taste that vanilla and some raisins and caramel, I also taste something that's not really coffee like but some of that style of robustness is hittin my tongue. Their is enough hops to notice it, but this is definitely strong on the malt. The aftertaste is good although I do feel a little of the alcohol burning as I exhale. I'm guessing this beer is going to improve as it gets a bit warmer and I'm also excited to try this again after it ages a year or so.","bheilman","Jan 28, 2009"
4.17,-9.3,3.5,4,5,4,3,"Incredibly complex even though the predominate flavor that jumps out is bourbon. Tons of caramel and toffee flavors. Incredibly smooth in swallowing, but fairly sweet and sticky mouthfeel that really rides the top and bottom of your mouth. Great roasted malts that produce a very nice texture and flavor assortment. Some cocoa and vanilla are present in the background, and are greatly overshadowed by the bourbon. Very bread-like/cracker after taste. Hints of oak are in the background as well. Definitely a slow sipper but a fantastic one at that.","CoolJosh","Jan 27, 2009"

Smelled of vanilla, bourbon, dark fruit, chocolate and molasses; rich, sweet and complex, it hid the ABV well and was more like a port wine or merlot. Tastes very sweet with vanilla, bourbon, dark fruit like cherry, dates or chocolate dipped strawberry, sweet rum-like flavor, chocolate, licorice, brown sugar, and molasses; there is a bitterness like burnt coffee and syrup or toffee melted in it, almost like a dark chocolate malted ball candy that was dipped in booze.

4.37,-5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Robust, yet smooth beer. The flavors are very outgoing, and maybe a bit too much. Very dark with a decent head, doesn't really stick, and I wish it did - really makes each sip feel better in the mouth. Smell is quite good - very molasses and tons of sweet bourbon, and some spice underneath. Taste is also quite good, but I feel like there is so much bourbon and molasses that it isn't quite balanced. It seems to cover up the high alcohol content (13%) a little too much - I like to have a nice alcohol bite in a big and heavy beer like this. It is still remarkably warm and soothing, and the beer definitely gets better as you drink it, so I'll give it a 4.5 there. Feel is, like the general taste, silky smooth and very warming to the palate and throat. Maybe all that bourbon I'm tasting is actually the alcohol, but in that case it is extremely well masked (not hidden. masked). The alcohol may be masked well, but you certainly feel it after the bottle is near done - this is as strong as most wines, and it is so expensive ($24 for the 4 pack) that I can't give it a really high drinkability rating, but I certainly enjoyed this beer, and I really look forward to aging it and tasting it later on. If you're looking for a beer with a super outgoing character, definitely check this out - extremely memorable and every sip is very fulfilling.","prsguitarsr4me","Jan 22, 2009"

4.82,4.8,4,4.5,5,5,5,"This beer pours a thick used motor oil black color. The head is a quarter inch of tan foam which recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of chocolate, graham crackers (it reminds me of smores), roasted malt and booze. The taste is like the aroma times ten. There is so much chocolate, and roasted male that it is nearly overwhelming....nearly but not quite. There is some firm heat in the finish, but it really adds to the experience. The mouthfeel is extremely full bodied with a vibrant, silky texture, and appropriately low carbonation. Overall, I have a true love for huge imperial stouts. Sure I couldn't drink them every day, but I love having one every other month or so. I really like how this stout isn't overpowered with hops. A hoppy stout (along with a hoppy hefe) is kind of beer I just can't stand. I could taste some hops in this beer, but they were in the background, and I'm sure will fade with age. It seems that a lot of other huge imperial stouts have coffee, or chocolate, of wood, or bourbon in them. I like that Bourbon County doesn't. It truly is a classic imperial stout, but bigger.","KarlHungus","Jan 20, 2009"

I found it to be a little distracting. Beneath the alcohol there was some toffee and vanilla cream. The taste wasnt terrible, the best part about this beer. A complex blend of caramel, vanilla, expresso, alcohol, and sweet chocolate syrup. Very thick mouthfeel. Perhaps the thickest, most dense beer I've ever had. Not the most drinkable beer. While I did enjoy it, I certainly did not fall in love with it. The look was off, the smell was overpowering, the taste was very intense, and it was heavy as a brick.

Taking your time with sipping it, the alcohol starts to burn a little more, but more the chocolately, malty backbone comes through. This is a heavy, full bodied beer, with very little carbonation and coats the entire mouth. The finish is amazing and lingers forever with dark chocolate and bourbon flavors and a surprising hop pinch. Overall, a very impressive beer, but I'm a little disappointed in the end. KBS is one of my favorite beers, and while just as big as this seems more balanced and complex, but also more drinkable.

The mouthfeel is very thick for this beer one of the thickest beers I have ever tasted, feels wonderful in my mouth. I would love to say I could drink this all night but @ 13% this is something I can only have one or two of BUT it is very drinkable, I would be afraid of these catching up to me too fast @ 13% though.

Malt backbone is enormous, anise and licorice flavors round out this brew. Finish is slightly bitter and leaves a drying effect.

The aroma is full of dark roasted barley giving off chocolate and coffee flavors, vanilla and hints of coconut from the bourbon are present along with the light presence of the charred oak. Sipping the beer, and the massive amount of darkly roasted barley hits your first and then the bourbon comes in to take care of the rest. The first flavors to pound your tongue are chocolate and coffee and massive sweetness, but the bourbon balances this out with vanilla and enough charred oak to keep the sweetness in check. The beer is a full explosion of flavor, but everything has been put into balance incredibly well.

This is just spicy, vanilla bourbon heaven. Incredible chewy mouthfeel, lingering spiciness on the tongue....it's fair to say I'm losing my mind here.

Poured obsidian black with zero light penetration. No head to mention, but a thin tan ring around the perimeter of the bowl and some isolated spots of foam in the center. Lacing consisted of a khaki-colored band around the circumference of the glass that was revealed at each sip. Boozy nose, predominantly bourbon and oak with a very sweet backbone. Taste similar to nose; however flavors of vanilla and molasses reveal themselves in the mouth. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and silky without being overly viscous. Some carbonation tingle present across the tongue, but just enough to add a little liveliness to the texture.

The aggressive pour left little head that disappeared quickly, but left nice little rings around the glass after every sip. This beer is making me interested already. Aroma is a myriad of smells. Definite whiffs of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, toffee and roasted almonds. But there are also dark fruits, raisins and figs finishing with a flash of booze. Really complex...still holding my attention. Taste is what espresso smells like, not like it actually tastes. Definitely vanilla, dark chocolate and roasted almonds. The one thing it reminds me of heavily is of a waffle cone, the kind you get at Baskin Robbins. You take that waffle cone and douse it in dark chocolate and vanilla and drizzle some Makers Mark on top of it, well there ya go. Mouthfeel is full bodied with light carbonation. The oily nature of the beer sticks with you making it linger in you mouth. The only points I can take off is the fact I could only drink about 1 a week.

Pours big, utterly black, and incredibly viscous with little head. Wow. The aromas are incredible! Starts with a big hit of Bourbon folowed immediately by licorice pastilles, then fades a bit to developfurther aromas of coconu, oak, vanilla, a finer Bourbon purity, dark fruit, and a ton of chocolate. After it breathes for a while it becomes even more licoricy. Taste is equally as incredible. Very powerful, but also amazingly integrated. Licorice up front, then vanilla, chocolate,and a long Bourbon finish. Huge and delicious. Mouthfeel is huge and very smooth and creamy. Very much a sipper,but so, so impressive.

The aroma is divine: you can smell the bourbon fragrance rising from the surface, along with molasses and treacle. After that, the taste is almost an anti-climax.

Nice bourbonesque undertones. Smells kind of like barbecue from the blackened graininess. The nose is just saturated with richness. As I raise the glass to my lips alcohol stingers whip my oropharynx. The taste is of most delicious chocolate and boozey fumes. Definite dark fruitiness. This thing is just ripe with flavour. It would probably light on fire. It has a nice bitterness that is completely an afterthought and is almost lost in the cascade of flavour. Just utterly delicious and such a pleasure to consume. This one makes me feel classy as I drink it and the power of it casts a pleasant warmth over my being. The mouthfeel is thick and oily. Very substantial and heavy bodied. I'd love to see the nutrition facts for this sucker. The drinkability is great considering what I have here. The flavour definitely rewards me for taking it slow and experiencing the subtleties as the temperature warms. This is a great beer. Worth the price of admission with all things considered.

The first initial smell is bourbon. Followed by dark chocolate, black coffee, sweet malts, and a hint of smoke. Tastes like it smells but more powerful. Rich bourbon, mix of dark and milk chocolates, coconut, burnt toast, sweet malt, vanilla, oak, smokey campfire and tons of warming booze. Very complex, a lot going on in flavor. Mouth feel is thick, but creamy and some stickiness as well. Some carbonation, but not much. Overall drinkability is exceptional. Deliciously bold and extreme.

Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. The beer poured an opaque black, with no head. The aroma was an intensely strong bourbon along with a slight hint of chocolate. Complex, but hard to define due to the high alcohol aroma. The taste is extremely complex. The taste starts off with the strong flavor of bourbon, and then gives way to a smooth chocolate flavor accompanied by hints of vanilla and wood. Highly complex. The mouthfeel is just like a stout should be, very thick and smooth. This is what I consider to be a sipping beer, and not exactly a sessionable ale. The high abv. keeps this from being sessionable.

Smell is of big sweet molasses with some swet caramel notes. I sense a bit of kahlua in the nose as well, yummy. Taste is rich! Starts of with the sweet molasses mixed with a gooey chocolate brownie. Bourbon taste definitely comes through midway and warms as it goes down. The taste gets more and more complex as it warms. More of a dark chocolate flavor emerges with hints of espresso. Mouthfeel is full bodied with minimal carbonation. Silky smooth, wow. I'll definitely look for this one again.

4.37,-5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"This beer is a great example of what I call "purposeful excess." Anyone can overload a batch of beer with malt or hops, but the challenge is to make it a great beer in the process, and Goose Island has succeeded with this one. There are red highlights as you pour it, but it sits instensely black in the glass, with a thin, mocha-colored head. The aroma is all bourbon. The flavor is amazing, coffee-and-chocolate-noted malt intensity with loads of bourbony earthiness. Unlike many bourbon barrel-aged beers, the liquor flavors don't come through in any way as brandy -- it's much more of a true bourbon flavor. The malty whallop is great, and yet there's a back-taste that's almost reminiscent of port wine. The mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth, but aromatic  yes, like bourbon. So, so satisfying. But here's the nit -- twelve ounces is too much, and it's hard for me to find someone to share this with. The second six ounces aren't quite as enjoyable as the first six. If Goose Island would put this in a smaller bottle, I'd buy it a lot more.","Flyer","Jun 25, 2007"
4.47,-2.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Oak laced chocolate flavors hit the taste buds like a wave. Chocolate flavors give way to vanilla bean notes that give a subtle smoothness to the overall flavor. Licorice notes blend well with a touch of dark fruits, which contribute to a nice sweetness that comes through in the aftertaste. Thick and juicy mouthfeel comes through pretty hard with a hotness. Bourbon booze is hefty but not over abundant. A nice brew this one is with a ton of flavor and excellent smooth mouthfeel. One to sip and enjoy if you get the chance. I bet this also cellars well.","bjohnson","Jun 16, 2007"

The aroma was one of the strongest I've ever encountered. I poured the beer from the bottle into a Stone Imperial Russian Stout snifter and set it on the kitchen counter. I could smell the beer from there while still standing upright. The aroma was dominated by roasted barley but quickly followed by roasted coffee, bitter coffee and plenty of oak. The beer tasted strongly of rich espresso with a decent bitter cocoa flavor and a noticeable presence of Bourbon. The alcohol was somewhat well hidden and the beer set a slightly heavy-medium on the palate. This is def finitely a sipper, but a very enjoyable one nonetheless.","atsprings","Mar 27, 2007"

4.87,5.9,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"2006 bottling. Many thanks to czoch75 for sending me a sample. Served at cellar temperature. Pours extremely viscously into a 17-ounce snifter, with only a thin wisp of burnt ochre foam that quickly disperses to a miniscule ring on top of a ponderous, tar-like body that is as black "as the night itself, Mayor." The nose is outright decadent, with boozy vanilla, toffee, chocolate, and rum-soaked raisin aromas. An almost medicinal dark berry essence wafts up as well, with slight coffee notes emerging here and there. Extremely complex bouquet, to say the least. And the taste exhibits at least as much complexity, if not more. But first, there is the mouthfeel: it is a velvety, chewy, expansive, creamy oil-slick, with a beguilingly syrupy quality that causes the beer to roll around the entire palate, almost to the point where it threatens to escape in order to coat the lips. Amazing. The taste, now: dark chocolate bitterness, with liquified cacao nibs melds with black bourbon-infused cherries coated with the thinnest of toffee-mocha candy shells. A sharp, alcohol nip at the finish, along with some vanilla coffee roast flavor. Mild to medium oaky tannins throughout, with a lingering woody pucker that remains alongside some chewy date booziness in the aftertaste. This is a stellar sipping experience as of right now, one that begs to be drawn out for as long as possible. However, I imagine some careful cellaring would do wonders for this gargantuan stout, inching it ever nearer to perfection. A monumental achievement in brewing.","orfeu","Jan 08, 2007"

Smells of intense sweet licorice, and raisons. The taste is very rich and sweet, not milky thick, but definitely substantial. Lots of sweet malts licorice not so much bourbon, like I'd hoped, but some seriousness all the same (its very strong). This is a very interesting beer, its more of a special occasion beer.

The bourbon flavor seems to completely take over and dominate any other typical stout flavors this beer may have had. GIBCS is heavy and boozey. Even after 15 month this beer still seems unbalanced and needs more time to mellow out.

Flavor starts out with chocolate, burbon and oak, it then fades into a bit of dark fruit, and finishes with a long dose of coffee that lingers for quite some time.

So with this in mind I can't really answer the appearance and smell section due to the fact I couldn't see it and the smell was extremely concentrated which is why I market them as average because I cannot give an indepth answer. On to the beer, I liked it the taste was a stout without a doubt with a major bourbon after taste that knocked most of my friends over that tried it.

Bourbon presence is interesting but a bit too powerful for my liking since it brings too much alcohol, which is not something that I necessarily enjoy. Body is full and has a creamy texture, which I quite enjoy. Overall, this is a very interesting creation, which Im glad, got a chance to try but I feel I would probably prefer the non-barrel aged version more.

Others have said how much the bourbon stands out, to me it was definately present, but I found the chocolate and coffee flavors to be much more dominant and much to my delight. Mouthfeel is thick and full bodied with low carbonation, just how I think it should be. I'm stuck on where to rate this for drinkability; it was very enjoyable throughout, but it is a sipper.

Poured into a large snifter, this was quite an amazing pour, thick viscous black with angry cappuccino-colored frothy head that recedes to just a ring around the glass. The smell might be the absolute best thing about this beer: coconut, chocolate (think almond joy candy bars), a little banana, and some noticable alcoholic fumes that are a fitting preview of what's to come. The taste introduces itself with just the slightest char, which is quickly smashed to bits by a straight-up bourbon flavor, but with a bit more malty goodness, as if you made a chocolate cake with bourbon (I have, and it's good), or perhaps had a black organic coffee with a hefty dose of bourbon. The alcohol is not that well-hidden, honestly, and that means drinkability is where I have to take off the points.

There's a rich roasted quality as well, but this is overpowered by everything else. Malty and sweet with a fair bit of chocolate starts things off on the first sip, followed by massive whisky/alcohol and vanilla in the middle. It mellows out again at the end, with chocolate and roast coming forward again, and it finishes with lingering alcohol warmth. Low carbonation and quite creamy.

Obvious alcohol presence peaks throughout the blackberry and grapey fruitiness, all in a tar like bold malt base. Port and Madeira reminding finish, very alcoholic, bubble gummy and strongly roasty (tobacco). Expert palate rounding, full bodied, soft in texture, intense mouth presence. Good stuff if not particularly my style.","Rastacouere","Sep 11, 2005"

4.61,0.2,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.75,"The flavor is too full to absorb in one or two sips, and only reveals itself fully about 1/4 way into the glass. There's almost too much to mention, and its flavors don't seem to appear in any order. So here's the list: whiskey (not necessarily bourbon, but there's definitely some! And I think also notes of something more salty, like an Islay Scotch), delicate fruit (apple, light red berries), coconut, hot alcohol, chocolate (as in German chocolate cake or raw, melted milk chocolate), molasses, coffee, spice (from the alcohol), dark fruit/the skins of dark fruit, dark red wine, pineapple/mango, dark caramel, smoke, wood, char. Stunning! But it is a sipper... there's way too much alcohol to take this in, apart from savoring it very slowly. It's so good, in fact, that the smell alone sholud keep you busy for quite some time. Overall, this is one full-throttle beer that's exceptionally satisfying, rich and drenched in alcohol! And although you CAN'T really drink more than one, it scores big because you will want to go and grab another bottle for another night!","NeroFiddled","May 17, 2005"

This stuff kicks ass if you like big stouts find some and try it, if you don't like it mail it to me I will gladly drink it. Many thanks again to merlin48 for this wonderful beer.

And yes, somewhere in the aroma is a touch of bourbon itself along with some vanilla overtones from the oak and some caramel presence as well. Mouthfeel is amazingly rich..

4.55,-1.1,4.5,4.5,5,4,4,"Inky black as night, with a modest but slightly imposing looking shoe polish brown head that slowly dwindles down to a rich rim around the glass. Aroma is a heady and befuddling mix of fermenting dark fruit, roasted nuts, bourbon and a woody weirdness. Certainly not what I expected, but very intriguing. Taste is a mature blend of bourbon and roasted malt, chocolatey and rich, loaded with complexity. Rotting dates and plums struggle against the bourbon infused tide to make their presence known, amongst the heat of the bourbon and the many layers of malty goodness. Chocolate mingles with hazelnut and molasses, with more heat and sweetness building in the finish. Woody flavor and traces of vanilla are prominent in the finish as well. This is one heavy hitter of an imperial stout, and a bold effort. Thanks to MJR for this black beauty.","mikeys01","Mar 17, 2005"
4.28,-7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a motor oil black that just looks so viscous that I know this is going to be a meal for a beer. A thin head rises with a firm chocolate color and laces the glass nicely. Aromas are all over the place with this brew. Strong expresso, roast and molasses like aromas part way for a barrage of vanillas and bourbons with strong tones of dark fruits. This almost reminds me of Sam Adams triple bock but more robust and well put together. Initial tastings start off with a strong dose of molasses and roast that give off a bittersweet combination that follows with some sharp expresso tones. Some dark fruits find their way into the mix but quickly strong roast and caramels take over. The finish is simply dilectable with a strong warming bourbon flavor that takes away some of the sharp roast and expresso tones and fills it with vanilla and some slight sweetness. The body to this brew is like a milkshake and a subtle carbonation lifts this beer off of the pallate in a most excellent manner. For 11% this brew is scarily drinkable and its what I started off with for my 22nd birthday on this fine St. Patricks day.","bigbeerdrinka","Mar 17, 2005"
4.87,5.9,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"Feel is powerfully heated with a bourbony sweetness and back-throated burn that is absolutely awesome to behold. Thickishly full body with an oily front and somewhat creamy length throughout the rest of its stay that mediates under the overall heat. If it were a notch less heated it would be phenomenal as far as its feel and drinkability. It could be quite a drinkable treat if it weren't so ABV hitting. Although, there's nothing wrong with slowing down and enjoying it, appreciating it, ...loving it, cuz that's what it's all about with this one.

3.94,-14.3,5,3.5,4.5,5,2.5,"this puppy pours out the thickest most opaque black I have ever seen. Very small dark brown head present. Smell is sweet bourbon. Very sweet and malty, but the bourbon definitely overpowers the smell, good if boubon is your thing, and I am definitely one not to pass up on a nice glass of makers on the rocks, anyways, back to the review. I lowered the rating on the nose due to being able to smell only bourbon. Wow, bourbon definitely hits the mouth first. The alcohol sting of it is there and doesnt shy at all. But luckily the dark malts of the stout make a nice appearance near the end. Sweet bourbon followed by black coffee like malts. Bliss in the mouth. The bourbon is a little overpowering and a blended version of this may have made it a little more stout like, but this is definitely a bourbon drinkers beer. Rating this one high, but it could be better in my opinion if more of the stout qualities showed up. Mouthfeel is thick and full and perfect for a stout of this nature. Drinkability is another story. How do you rate this one, it is not drinkable in the sense of being able to sit back and drink a lot of them. The price also limits the drinkability on this one.","bnuttz","Mar 08, 2005"

Pours a dark, thick, oily black with a thin (half-centimeter) reddish-brown head which quickly diminishes to nothing but a ring around the glass. Giving the glass a swirl leaves a nice thin coating of medium brown liquid wherever the beer reached up to on the glass. Smells strongly of oak, vanilla, and roasted malts. Some bourbon notes come through in the wonderfully strong and complex aroma. Feels full-bodied and oily smooth in the mouth. A very good tasting beer. Tastes of bourbon with strong oaky vanilla flavors particularly in the finish. Chocolate and roasted malts lend some nice bitterness and contribute to the very full and multi-dimensional flavors. Very well balanced overall. Quite filling and not a beer you'll be likely to have more than one of in a sitting, but one youll definitely want again.","tar","Feb 01, 2005"
