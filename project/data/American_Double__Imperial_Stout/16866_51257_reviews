"This beer is a sipper! Great Flavor, can't wait to try mocha and grey!"
""
"O- Need I say more? Best BBA Stout I've ever had hands down. This thing is a monster, so it may not be for everyone, but if you are looking for something to blow you away, this'll do it."
""
""

"Pours fairly black with brownish edges when held to the light, fat tan head that sticks around for a few sips with no lacing, but amazing legs like you would find with a fine wine. Aroma is vinous - cabernet, barrel, dark fruit, bakers chocolate, vanilla, coconut - almost like a German chocolate cake soaked in bourbon - phenomenal! Aroma carries over into flavor - very wine-like, a lot going on but all in perfect harmony.......tons of bourbon, but not over the top. This beer is hot, make no doubt about it, but at nearly 20% it's to be expected - the sweetness of the stout works so well with the booziness in this one - again, such a great balance, medium bodied with a dry finish."

"O. I was very excited to trey this and I'm a fan. I have high regards of the Bruery and I think their HIGH-gravity stouts are truly world class. This is a staple of their collection and I'm all about popping the others. Based on how big this beer is, I c=recommend sharing it with some friends. Well crafted. When the time is right, I will crack open my other."

"â€™11 vintage shared by Chris at the District. Black pour. Licorice nose. Sweet caramel, dark malt, toffee flavors, kind port like with a boozy finish. Good stuff...."

"Whoa.  This is awesome - it is hard to believe this is such a high ABV.  This beer is much like my Tuesday's - very boozy.  Nice job"
""

"KInd of thought it would be a bit more subdued after nearly 3 years, but still a very solid stout, especially clocking in at 19.2% ABV"
""
""
""
"Final beer of the short-notice share with Justin and Morgan in FL. 750 ml bottle poured into red solo cups. Jet black body with tan head that slowly fades to a film. Legs but no lacing. Aroma of chocolate, bourbon, oak, roast malt, coconut, marshmallow, and dark fruits. Flavor is moderately sweet with cocoa, brown sugar, and plum notes, but also decently bitter with barrel, booze, and unsweetened chocolate highlights. Full body, oily, thick texture that coats the tongue, minimal carbonation, sweet, boozy hot finish."

""
""
""
"2013 vintage: Hard to believe that this is 19%, seriously super drinkable for how heavy it is."
"Waited to try this for a long time and finally enjoyed the 2014 vintage when my neighbor shared with me. Lived up to my expectations - loads of sweet and savory flavors and quite drinkable. Everything about it was extremely well balanced, a very nice mouthfeel and an inviting smell. Can't wait to try again someday."

"An intricate and challenging brew that takes a few dives to reach its depths.  I recommend enjoying every moment, but don't forget to take your time while ascending for air."
""
""
""
""
"Big, bold, thick, and black. Massive bourbon presence."
""
""
"In the category of thick, heavy, no holds barred RIS:  this is fantastic. It is like BCBS x 1.5, eclipse x2. Wow."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"From a 2014 bottle.  Lots of sweetness and heat and a bit thinner than I had hoped.  Some nice flavors in there, but a bit overwhelmed by the heat.  A sipper for sure."
""
""
""
"Super boozy (obviously at 19%) but not moonshine status surprisingly.  Oak and bourbon notes at first, followed by vanilla and sugar.  Very sweet; a desert beer in my opinion.  Not the best barrel aged beer, but a good one.  Hardly worth $40 a bottle though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Yeah... It's that good! And Chocolate Rain and Mocha Wednesday are even better! Now send me some Grey Monday!"
""

"Buy it, trade for it, sell you first born."
"O-Share with friends."
""
""

"Pours black as night. Smells of bourbon, caramel, chocolate. Mouthfeel is slightly thin for a beer this viscous. 2013 bottle is still pretty boozy and a bit of a palate shock as it's very sweet. Looking forward to trying another vintage."
""
"Truly exceptional, delicious beer."
""
"Smells like a bourbon bomb. Taste is obviously very very sweet due to the high ABV but still a fantastic barrel aged stout. Only knocks i have on it are the beer is a little thin in the mouthfeel and a touch too sweet."
""
"This is the best beer I've ever had. Each year is slighty different, but I've never been disappointed. I have a few bottles I'm going to sit on for several years."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Split a bottle with a few friends... certainly lived up to the hype."
""
""
"I would have liked a little more head to this one, but I cannot really complain for something 19+ to tasty this amazing.  so rich, smooth, and easy to drink.  Just WOW"
""
""
""
""
"You know what, after having more stouts this one is a little bit more abrasive then I was hoping.  Still damn good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Amazing beer.  You can't drink the bottle alone. Extremely smooth and hides the incredible high abv unbelievably well.  Brandy and bourbon and refined oh my.  Burns but not badly. Refined drinking that will annihilate you."

"O: Something really special if you get can get your hands on it, a great base beer for all their variants."
""
"I thought this was very tasty, I'm glad i have another one on the shelf. I need to try the Run barrel aged one"
""
""
"Overall-this is an extremely impressive beer, drink carefully, you can't really taste the 18.9 percent abv but it's there!"
""
""
"Wow.  Simply an amazing beer.aroma is strong of booze and bourbon.  Looks dark as night and black as death.  Tastes like sweetness mixed with goodness and love.  Heavy on the notes of barrel and vanilla but really couldn't discern much bourbon.  Amazing and really unique.  This is what world wide stout wishes it was like.  Much thanks to  steveb24 for sharing"
""

""
"2014 version, opened for the birth of my son Nathan."
""
""
""
""
"2011 Vintage. Simply incredible. Strong bourbon aroma, but easily drinkable."
""
""
"O - Starts out hot from the alcohol, mellows as it breathes, and lets more flavor emerge."
"This is my first time having it. 2012 vintage. I don't know what to think... The color really threw me off as it was almost a deep brown opposed to the usually opaqueness of stouts. Second was the taste. Only other stout with a similar taste profile I can think of is DFH WWS. It's a helluva tasty beer, but not what I expected."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2012 vintage poured December 2014 into a snifter."
"It was awesome I loved it it was gross I hated it I rate it 3.6"
""
"Overall, this is one of the best beers out there.  Not what I would call a typical BA imperial stout - it's clearly in a class of its own."

"This beer was really nice. It was a little hot when I had it, but was among the top BA stouts I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
"Big rep beer that lives up to the hype (at least when sampled at tap room on 2014 release date)"
""
"Fantastic stout.  One of the most surprising aspects of this beer is that despite the high alcohol content, it is not overly boozy.  It has a nice smell and is really smooth.  One of the best stouts I have had."

"Pour at a tasting. Dark thick black body. Big Sweet aroma. Wow, huge big sweet chocolate taste. Tastes like a chocolate covered caramel. So good. After warming up a bit though, that big 19.2% alcohol burn starts to be noticeable."

"Smells like a rich, dark chocolate candy bar, dropped into a pan of hot chocolate pudding, quietly burning on the range. Complexity of this beer is off the charts. I have had several of The Bruery's blended beers that incorporate Black Tuesday, and I've had Grey Monday, but I will freely admit I was not expecting the zany flavors this monstrous brew delivered to me on the first sip. Abundant fig, oak, hazelnut, almond, vanilla, sweet cream, molasses, molten caramel, pudding, semisweet chocolate... I don't know, man. Blown away. Was all ready to be objective about it and then the first drop hit my tongue. BT is entirely worthy of the reputation it has garnered."
""
"Will I buy it again? Of COURSE; Will I buy 3 bottles? NO (wish they served a 2-4oz taster on tap, smh); Will I join the reserve society to get a hold of this bottle? No"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, Black Tuesday is one of the best straight BA stouts I've ever had, maybe slightly ahead of BCBS and slightly behind the king of the roost, Parabola. The flavors are rich, complex, and hard to capture adequately with words. If you're a BA stout fan, you'll love this one."

"A must-try, just make sure you have someone/s to share it with!  Had the 2012 on 11/14/14"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: This is fantastic. Tons of rich dark chocolate and bourbon notes with a touch of chocolate covered cherry, raisin, port and char. A huge beer, but it's really smooth and there's no real burn at all, which is pretty crazy. Definitely deserving of its reputation."

"2014 vintage. Poured into a wine glass. Absolutely incredible. lots of dates, raisins chocolate, bourbon, charred oak and sweet molassas  in the nose. the taste is true to the nose. Bourbon chocolate and sweet raisins. it's a sweet beer but not overly sweet. this absolutely blew me away. i can not smell or taste the alcohol for the 19.7%. I would have to say this is the best bourbon barrel aged imperial stout I have ever had."

"Fantastic beer overall. The epitome of what a barrel aged stout should be."
""
""
""
""
"Well hidden ABV - drinks like 'just' 10%.  Very smooth and mild for 19.2% ABV."
""
"2012, poured dark as the night, smell of bourbon, cholocate, slight vanilla and a bit of booziness.  Taste was much of the same characteristics, bourbon up front, sweetness, but not cloying, and rich stout.  A slight bit of booze, but no burn and not overpowering.  Definitely a monster beer."

"O: This is a delicious beer, one that I'd recommend to any craft beer nerd who is also into bourbon ( which is almost every craft beer nerd I know).  Lots of heat going on as expected, but the aroma and flavor pack the punch to make this an all around enjoyable beer."
"2014 vintage. Massively flavorful and intense. Every single thing I could possibly want from a stout."
""
""
""
""
"One of the best BA imperial stouts out there! If you love ""boozie"" than this is the beer for you. I'm lucky enough to get my hands on a bottle this weeks 2014 release, sadly just one bottle, but will be looking to trade for more. Totally worth the price."

"Overall impression:  While still exhibiting the character of a wood-aged Imperial Stout it also reminds me of a well-aged English Barleywine.  There is depth to this beer that shows different layers each time you sample it.  Truly an amazing feat.  This is the best barrel-aged beer I've had.  A treat worthy of all the hype."

"2013 vintage. Pours pitch black with no head and little to no lacing. Lots of bourbon, dark fruit, and tobacco.  Caramel, chocolate, fig, anise, bourbon, and dark roast coffee on the palate. Some alcohol burn. Full bodied with little carbonation. Overall this beer is a monster best sipped. Quite delicious."

""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great beer, but I'm not sure it is worth the price tag and the effort to procure. Still, a great beer that I would seek out and drink again."

"Thick, viscous, black body. Surprisingly, some frothy foam in the pour but dissipates quickly. Aroma is stellar; rum cake, ,molasses, sweet bourbon, maple syrup. Aroma jumps as soon as i uncap the bottle. Flavor follows the same path as the aroma. Fudge cake, bourbon, maple, maybe not as intense as the aroma. Very sweet and that's a lot coming from me. Feel straddles the line between beer and spirits. Very special and happy to have had the chance."
""
""
"Absolutely spectacular stout. Sweet, dense, creamy and one of the best stouts out there. Incredible balance between chocolate, coffee and vanilla. A definite sipper. Wish I could get some more. The only way to improve this would be to age it with cacao nibs and vanilla."
""
""
""
""
""
"Both beers were top of the line brews, but I would give the edge to Black Tuesday. Just a total joy to consume; especially with all my new friends that came to share my Heady Topper Tasting."

"Pours much, much thinner than I expected. Looks like cola, but slightly more concentrated, with a thin khaki head. The aroma is chock full of raisins, maple syrup, dark chocolate, coffee, a mild roasty note, vanilla, bourbon, and some toffee. On the palate, the beer feels thin and finishes hot, which is to be expected of an 18-19% ABV beer such as this. However the flavors are rich and intense, with the same notes as evident on the nose."

"To be honest, I didn't care for it the first time. It was way too sugary sweet and burned too much as well. It's still very strong in both of those arenas but have considerably mellowed out and allowed other flavors to come through. Overall, a good choice for my 1000th review as it demonstrates a good usage of cellaring. I think I'll sit on my 2011 bottle until I hit 1100 reviews (at my current pace, it might be awhile)."
"O - High expectations weren't quite met, but this is still a good barrel-aged stout. You really need to be a fan of sweet beers to like this one. Served at room temperature this is a bourbon-soaked dark fruit stout with some balls. Very good, but in my opinion (and I can't stress enough: MY OPINION) it didn't live up to it's reputation."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - One of the booziest beers I have ever had.. but this is not a bad thing. I was expecting this to be cloyingly sweet, but instead it still manages to remain quite drinkable especially given the ABV - not that sweet at all either. Definitely a good bottle to share and worth seeking out."
""
"Bottle: Poured a clear light dark black color ale with a nice dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of rich thick black chocolate notes with light molasses and some roasted malt is quite sublime. Taste is an incredible mix of thick black chocolate with some roasted malt and some light molasses. Body is quite full with good carbonation and surprisingly no alcohol is easily apparent. Light oak and vanilla notes can also be detected. I was expecting somewhat of a messy overly sweet beers bit this is actually very smooth with plenty of complexity."

"Pours a deep dark brown, but still see through which surprised me; short ephemeral brown head. Big nose of chocolate, big dark roasted malts, massive bourbon and vanilla and some hot alcohol. The taste is so smooth and balanced especially for such a big beer, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, roasted malt. The body is big but doesnâ€™t reflect the 19.5% ABV with low carbonation for a silky smooth stout. Overall and incredible balanced and deep stout, wow!"

"O- a very delicious beer that really captures the style. Gotta drink it slow though. Very hard to find something wrong with this beer. If there was anything it would be the heat from the alcohol. But even that is done so well for a beer that is almost 20%. To me this beats out BCS because the sweetness from the bourbon blends way better in this beer. Glad i have another bottle."

"2013 bottle shared by some great people after Hunahpu's Day 2014. Great deep black with some tan head, decent legs, not much for lacing. Hot hot hot. Even with a year on this, the bourbon heat is alive and well. Aroma is boozey up front, vanilla, toffee, and molasses behind that bourbon heat. Taste is also very boozey. I get the vanilla, some faint dark fruit (raisin or something of the like), some good oakiness. Slightly thin in the mouthfeel, but I enjoy the low carbonation and fairly thick body."

"Smells big and intense yet tasty even to me. Rather intense/big taste but still felt smooth to me over all. The taste, to me, didn't seem to linger on the tongue so long that I couldn't taste anything else, which was a nice difference to me at least. This baby is big and can slap you in the face at 18-19% but if you're a fan of stouts and bourbon barrel aging, definately get this."

"O: Seems like this beer is a huge hit or huge miss for a lot of people and I have to say it was a huge hit for me. Its not as sweet as I expected and the alcohol is actually far less detectable than I had anticipated even though it plays a pretty big role in both aroma and flavor. Really nice beer."

"Overall: Again it's a Bruery beer. I'm not impressed with the flavors that they developed, I'm more impressed that they created a beer that was 18.9% ABV. This isn't my style but I'm not going to give it poor marks because of that. It is what it is, it's a super strong beer that has a slight chocolate flavor with a hint of bourbon."
"I was really looking forward to Black Tuesday, and it did deliver. It is on the sweet side, so if you don't prefer sweet stouts this probably isn't for you. I was expecting something more dry like BCBS, but nonetheless the flavor profile worked for what it is. Share this one or split it over a few nights, it's a meal!"

"I'm pretty sure this was a 2012 bottle, consumed Jan. '14. Dark brown-black pour, no surprise there, topped with a thin brown head that receded to a ringlet; minimal lacing. Aroma was fairly sweet, notes of dark chocolate and vanilla, pretty hot with bourbony booze, licorice, brown sugar, some dark fruits. But the booze was the dominant factor. Fairly sweet up front in the taste (not quite Dark Lord sweet, perhaps), lots of booze, bourbon-soaked oak, bitter dark chocolate, licorice, tobacco, dark fruits, more subtle vanilla, the oak and herbal hops came out a bit more in the finish, and even more so as it warmed. While this was definitely pretty hot and boozy, it still drank fairly well, considering the extremely high ABV. Body was on the fuller side of medium--might as well just call it full--with a slick and somewhat unctuous mouthfeel. A decent brew overall, but doesn't really live up to the hype (welcome to the Bruery). I can get a World Wide Stout at my local shop and experience pretty much the same thing this beer offers (or better), in a better package (aka smaller bottle) and for a better price."

"750mL bottle. Pours a pitch black viscous color with a 1/2 inch of brown head. Minimal lacing. The aroma is a whole lot of booze with some nice vanilla, oak, raisins, dark chocolate, black coffee and earth. The taste is boozey with a great chocolate presence that somehow isn't overpowered by the bourbon. Vanilla hints with some caramel as well. Chocolate and alcohol burn towards the end. More warming alcohol at the finish with dark chocolate. Almost tastes like boozey Hershey's Syrup. Heavy, chewy mouthfeel. I'm surprised that the taste is so complex given the very high Abv. Its not just a boozey mess. Probably one of, if not the best, Barrel Aged Imperial Stouts I have had. Amazing beer."

"Black Tuesday has to be one of my favorite beers. This is the beer I use to judge other bourbon aged stouts against, and I haven't found many that stack up to this one. If you're a fan of strong, bourbon aged stouts, then Black Tuesday has to be on your bucket list."

"Overall: I enjoyed this beer tremendously, the variety of complex flavors make this a unique and delicious beer. It's got about as much flavor as I would think you could possibly get from a beer with an ABV this high. I've drank 10% stouts (almost half as strong) that have tasted boozier than this beer, and that to me is an amazingly well done job."
""

""

""

"The aroma is just as big, bold, and overpowering. Monster stout plus dark Belgian ale plus barrel aging means thereâ€™s a lot to unpack: dark chocolate, coffee, raisins, figs, floral esters, vanilla, leather, and some booze all come to mind. Each sip unravels another element of the same. Lots of heat. Too much, in fact, to bring it together as it warms. At least for this reviewer I found the heat distracting when it should be inviting. Another year or five, howeverâ€¦"
""
""
""
"O/D-Lucky to try this one. I enjoyed it but was far less enamored than most. I appreciate Black Tuesday's epic delivery but would not consider it to be anyway near one of the best beers I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Imagine crossing a highly quality RIS, Tawny port, and Kentucky bourbon, and you have Black Tuesday. So many flavors and profiles to pick from, and I'm happy I have two more bottles that I plan on cellaring for a good long while. I'd imagine this would soften up further, and cut the sweetness down in a more elegant manner. Definitely not one that I'd want to have too much at a time, unless it's all I'm drinking that night. While it's not perfect, it tastes pretty amazing. Cheers to the Bruery for this successful experiment!"

"Wow, this beer is not what I expected. Too thin, too sweet, not a whole lot of flavor. Not offensive, just not so great either. At least it was better than chocolate rain."
"Appearance is cola brown, quite a bit lighter than I expected. Thin head, no lacing, some clarity. Nose is bourbon, fudge, char, and oak. Tons of sugar on the nose. Taste is super sweet with chocolate and vanilla, bourbon. Very hot towards the end, cloyingly sweet. Mouthfeel is hot with mellow carbonation. Overall, this is a very sweet beer but the astronomical abv is well hidden."

"2013 version, opened too soon, but was jonesing to try it. Incredibly rich and full-bodied, with a ton of malt-y sweetness, laced through with coffee and caramel. A bit one-dimensional at this point, but I would imagine this will be great in a couple of years."

It's kind of on its own as far as uniqueness. This is a big intense beer. Don't recommend opening it by yourself. The Bruery just kills it time and time again."

"Picked this up from a great trade with Mike! (2012 vintage) An aggressive pour yielded no head or lacing with a rather flat looking pitch black body. The nose was huge and amazing. Tons of bourbon, oak, and roasty chocolate along with hints of vanilla, booze, espresso, and a touch of black licorice and soy sauce. The taste follows suit with huge notes of dark chocolate, bourbon, oak, and vanilla along with hints of booze soaked black cherries, espresso, molasses, port wine, and leather. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy and boozey and hot. There really was very little tangible carbonation. Overall, I've had this at tastings several times, but this was my first actual bottle of it. And although it's bold and full of flavor, it's so hot and boozey that it really detracts from the experience of drinking such a big beer. I drank this over the period of several hours and the booze was just relentless the entire time. I think I'll keep my other two bottles in the cellar for a while and see what happens..."

"O: First of all, this was good. There's an awful lot of barrel character and booze, to the point that even if the ABV wasn't so high, I wouldn't want to drink it all the time. My biggest complaint was the body. Perhaps I'm spoiled by the amazing mouthfeel of Cigar City's stouts, but this really fell short in that department. Very good, but not quite great."

"Black Tuesday is a beast of a beer - a true night cap and a sipper if there ever was one. It'll take even the manliest of men a while to pounce through their pours of this one. That said, it's quite tasty and really an enjoyable experience, but you better leave the Motrin on the night stand if you plan on tackling this one alone. Huge, sweet, and boozy; unabashedly so. Thanks again, Tommy."

"O - This is a great beer that I have just never gotten around to opening. It was a nice bbq with friends over, so we opened some good beers. This was one of the hilights for me. Lots of boozy bourbon, heat, and layers of chocolate and vanilla. Wonderful beer."

"O - I can't say I was let down here in any capacity. In fact, this beer exceeded my expectations. It betters as it warms a bit, with sweet, potent complexity assuming the best of everything within this bottle with a coat of beer-sexy on your tongue. Giddy-up."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Delicious. It's like drinking bourbon and port together. Thick thick beer that is very sweet but not cloyingly so. As mentioned above, the problem is that its got too much alcohol in it- I can smell it in the nose immediately as its being poured, and it definitely gets hotter as it gets warmer. I think its a deliciously sweet barrel-aged big stout but for the $36 it costs per bottle, I'll take 6 bottles of BCBS. It's not a very good value IMO (which does not detract from the overall scoring in this review), but I'm glad to have at least tried it."

"This poured out as a deep rich black color with a light brown head top. The bottle was a active and started foaming over. The retention hangs around the edge of the glass with a very thin lacing and a little syrupy. The taste is loaded with flavor, it's sweet, roasted, malty, bourbon, vanilla some molasses and a subtle licorice in there. The mouthfeel is oily and thick, lightly carbonated and boozy. Overall this beer is impressive, very good on just about every level. It's a huge beer... Almost over the top but very good nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
"edit: drank a fresh one last night as a midnight toast for the new year. i have to say, i was surprised that this wasnt alcoholically hot. the year on the one reviewed here i thought had done much of the mellowing, but its mellow as its made. i have even more admiration for this beer now, really really special stuff."

"Overall â€“ there are controversies about this type of imperial stout, but I absolutely loved it. I split this bottle with my wife and we took approximately 90 minutes to finish it. The experience was worth every minute of that 90. We drank a toast to Kevo2007 (the wonderful BA who sent me this bottle), the FedEx driver who delivered the package, the brewer at The Bruery who created this beer, and everyone else in between."
""
""
""
""
"O: I'll be honest, initially I was thinking not the best. About 2 sips later it improved. The further I got into this baby, the more I appreciated it. For a super boozy beer, this is top notch. You will definitely notice/taste/smell the booze, but for 19% or so, I think it blends VERY well. The more I think on this beer, and miss the flavor, the more I admire it. Definitely share a bottle with 2-3 others (even if I did not do the same...yikes)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fist of all, I could be happy just smelling this beer for hours. I had the 2012 batch (twice) and both times it was incredible. Chocolate and coffee notes, nuttiness in the middle, great hop and malt balance - a true whale. It will linger in your mouth forever, so don't plan on drinking anything else for the rest of the night."

"Mouthfeel is creamy and pretty nice. Overall it was good but not amazing. Way to sweet for me. Got down about 8 oz, which was just enough."

"Overall, this one was ok, but just a little over the top for me. Perhaps being consumed at the end of a long, intense stout season had a lot to do with it..I will let the other bottle I have sit until the fall and revisit hopefully a little more mellowed out version, and with a renewed desire for big, barrel-aged stouts after a summer of sours and IPA's."

"O: Absolutely massive sipping beer. Split between two of us and we finished it in a bit over 2 hours. Very nice boozy flavors as it warmed up. Great stuff, I will be on the lookout for more. Can't wait to open the Chocolate Rain and Grey Monday and make some comparisons."

"Holy crap, huge beer (2012 vintage). First time with the BT. Weren't sure what to expect when we cracked this, after a few whiffs and a couple of sips, cracked the benchmark by which I compare all BA Stouts to - BCBS. While the BCBS (2012) got the BT today in smoothness, drinkability, overall experience, the BT was damn good, albeit, HOT! I would go as far as to say, as big as it is today, it may have more potential than BCBS in the future. The BCBS is just so damn good right now. Glad we have a few bottles of the BT to age, look forward to revisiting in 12-18 months. We should have sat on this one longer, but glad we tried it."

"A thick black viscous liquid coats the inside of my glass with great legs. Aromas of chocolate, brown sugar, caramel, molasses, raisins and other dark dried fruits, along with a fair amount of ethanol. The flavor is sweet with dark and burnt sugars but that is countered nicely with a present but not overpowering alcohol heat. Roast and chocolate molasses round out the flavor nicely. Thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet syrupy mouthfeel. This is a monster of a beer, but its frikin tasty and devilishly deceptive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I shared this with my brother and even though he is not a craft beer drinker he helped me with 8oz of this. As I type I still have 2oz (of my 16) and it's so hard to choke down. I guess it's true that some people rate things higher when they pay the ""rare"" cost."
""
"O: This is a beer I've always wanted to try, and it almost lived up to the hype but not quite. This beer is a great candidate for consuming with friends as an after dinner drink, or laying down to forget about for a few years.

"Verdict: Despite this beer being nearly 20% and fairly hot, it's very drinkable which is quite impressive, but I'm not blown away by this. I've been fortunate enough to try a variety of vintages of this and even with time it's still a alcohol forward beer which isn't really my preference. A worthy beer for anyone who enjoys a barrel aged stout, but there are plenty of better ones on the market, and many of them for a better price."

"What a classy beer from a classy brewery. Just as the bottle suggests, this is one elegant beer. Appearance and mouthfeel are both good, but the smell and taste are darn right awesome. Lots of flavors come through as it warms.. chocolate, molasses, fig, burnt sugar, bourbon, and a touch of vanilla. Delicious! Worth seeking out if you can."

"O - This is one thick and syrupy beer. It is solid across the board. It is definitely a sweet beer with lots of chocolate and vanilla. We had the 09-12 and I'd say this is one beer that is definitely better with about 2 years on it. It helps mellow it out and allows the flavors to blend together well"

"2010 bottle: Had this with a few friends for a Christmas party... All I can say is how much hedonism can you fit into a bottle? At least that's what my notes said. Big chocolate syrup notes, dark fruit, coffee and unsweetened cocoa powder. The mouthfeel is silky and immense, It was almost hard to drink between the three of us, at least it would have been if it wasn't so delicious. That being said, this beer is probably the most extreme examples of a stout there can be, and definitely worth picking up and sharing with some good friends."
""
""
""
"Pours dark brownish to black with almost no head. Aroma is straight bourbon and licorice. Pour looks thin but it is anything but thin. Viscous with low carbonation. Flavor begins with licorice and heavy bourbon. Strong alcohol warmth but not out of control for this ridiculous abv. Chocolate flavor lingers with sweet molasses on the palate. Quite a sipper but pretty nice. Great base beer here but no reason for such a high abv. Just comes in too hot...let it age and mellow."

"Pours a very dark cola brown with a very short-lived caramel-colored head. Aromas of sweet coconut, brown sugar, alcohol, and when the alcohol fades, milk chocolate. Very, very rich. Phenomenally creamy mouthfeel. Barely any carbonation at all--and that's appreciated. A lot of chocolate, a bit of coconut, alcohol, and maybe some vanilla. Very sweet, very potent. Like Parabola with more alcohol. I love it. Trying to sip it, but its so delicious that I keep wanting to drink it."

"This is a full bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It has a huge alcohol impact that really suppresses the overall drinkability. There is quite a bit of complexity here to take in and I gotta say this one has me scratching my head. I dont want to be ""that guy"" who proclaims the Bruery and this beer has changed but quite frankly, this is not the same beer I remember enjoying in years past. I realize the recipe isn't the same each year and the alcohol varies but this is a significant variance from years past. This is more like a fruity/vinous dark belgian strong ale than the thick and syrupy chocolate smoothie of a beast stout I remember."

"O: The new online allocation system allowed me to grab two bottles of this difficult to obtain brew. An Imperial Stout with an amazing 19.2 ABV. The alcohol is present but not overwhelming dressed with a melange of flavors which makes this an amazing beer to experience. A holiday beer that I am thankful to experience this holiday season."

"This is a syrupy, absurd creation. The level of crazy here is hard to assess. It's somewhere between genuinely disgusting and uniquely charming. I'm very happy that I had a chance to sit down with a full glass of this. It's really not suitable for a small pour at a beer fest. I'll be skipping it at future Extreme Beer Fests."
"This beer is big, sweet, and massive. This would be an amazing beer to split with 10 people. It's a solid take on a dessert beer/beer for people that don't like beer. It's a liqueur made of bourbon soaked dark fruit. It loses some points in the long run because anything outside of a 3oz pour is difficult to finish. So heavy and sweet and heavy on the bourbon it's hard to really find the depth."

"O- Black Tuesday was not cheap and was frankly very difficult for me to get my hands on, however, it was worth every penny. I am so glad I was able to enjoy such a truly unique, special beer. This one is not for the faint of heart, but if you are going after it I would guess that you know what you are getting into. I'll see my second bottle in a few years...if I can wait that long."

"BT 2011, pours a deep black color, Medium sized tan foamy head. The aroma is chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, vanilla and woody with some alcohol. A full bodied Imperial Stout. A VERY BIG Imperial Stout. The malts are chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, some bourbon and some cherry. The hops are herbal. This beer has a big alcohol presence the first sip and smell are dominated by the alcohol, after that the other flavors start coming through. There is a nice mix of malts, sweetness, vanilla and wood going on here, once you get past the big alcohol blast. This beer has an awesome potential for aging. It is very good now, but a couple or five years of bottle aging would make this beer even more amazing. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
""
"O: This is a fantastic beer! This is the reason I drink craft beer. I have had many BA stouts (Stone BA IRS, Parabola, Eclipse, Marshal Z, Hunahpu, Silva Stout, World Wide Stout, Abyss and the list goes on and on) and Black Tuesday is the best. It is a prime example of balance in a big boozy, sweet barrel aged stout. This is a must have beer, it lives up to the hype. My overall score will improve as this beer rests for a while."

"Black Tuesday is a full bodied beer, it's heavy with a lingering flavor, but not quite heavy enough where you completely have to chew it (close though). Silky smooth the entire session with a nice carbonation level. Warm finish that doesn't burn at all, just a nice tingling heat to let you know that it's there. 18.3% is nothing to scoff at and how potent this beer is, if someone were to tell you it was a bit lower, it'd be believable based on how drinkable this beer is. This is not a beer to chug, but instead a nice sipper for a night cap. Crazy, crazy drinkable. I could drink a bottle myself, but it's too good not to share and should really just be consumed on occasions where it will be appreciated. Home Run, Slam Dunk, Overtime Goal, Game Winning TD or whatever you want to call it from The Bruery!"

"O: Overall, very good-bordering on great, but IMO not elite. Â I do find it incredibleÂ how they were able to produce such a drinkable beer with the crazy ABV, and in that sense this beer is a masterpiece. Â Unfortunately, I am not a huge fan of the flavor profile, as I tend to shy away from the overly sweet stouts. Â However, unlike some of the other crazy sweet IS's (I'm looking at you Dark Lord), this one has much more of a balance, which I mostly attribute to the big bourbon presence. Â I dont plan to seek this out as aggressively as some of the other big stouts (for example, KBS, BCBCS, Imperial Biscotti, Darkness, The Abyss, and even MZ are all beers that are far easier to obtain and better beers IMO). Â That being said, this Â is definitely a beer I would drink any chance I got, I would certainly recommend, and Im glad I got to try."

"Tap at The Bruery barrel room for the RBSG Grand Tasting. Thanks to Patrick Rue and the gang. A pleasure meeting you all. Pours a deep brune, thick tan head erupts. Nose is thick, sweet tomato paste; bourbon, maple, whoppers candies, vanilla extract. Taste is very sweet, whooo, that is a sweet one. Maple, booze, vanilla try to save something that is overloaded with sweetness from the alcohol level as the brewers are telling me this one actually attenuates very low. So the perceived sugar is really just the abv. I thought the Chocolate Rain felt a little less sweet than this one. The finish on this is also pretty hot unlike the CR. 7/24/2012 7/4/5/3/12=3.1"

"One of the best barrel aged stouts I've had. Drinks as easily as a stout with half the alcohol. Thick, sweet and complex. I very much want more."
""
""
""
""
"O: ""Diabeetus in a bottle"" is how I've seen a lot of BA's refer to it, and I see why. The penultimate sharing beer, as it constantly balances on the fine line between a barrel aged big stout and alcoholic syrup. If you have a similar palate to me and like your coffee and dark chocolate as well as your sweetness, you'd most likely go for a Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead the 5th. Though I must say that Black Tuesday is A LOT more balanced than say a Dark Lord, I feel sad to say I won't be counting it amongst the best stouts I've ever had. At least not in its 2011 form. Maybe a bit of age will work wonders on this beast. That 2009 bottle in my cellar is looking mighty tempting now..."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the aroma and the flavoring. These are both near perfection. The abv is a bit scary, but they mask it expertly. They somehow were able to eliminate most of the burning, fusel qualities of the ethanol that make taking shots so bad, while keeping the juicy, warming, spiciness of the bourbon. The chocolate and sugary inclusions helped to keep this in check, no doubt, and we were surprised to find such an ultimately sweet tasting beer. This is a superb beer, and we are so thankful that we got to enjoy it."
""
""
"Terrific double stout, very sweet, full of flavour. When drinking this brew I had that calm euphoria folks must have felt in the late 1920s with stocks at what Irving Fisher described as a ""permanently high plateau"". The high ABV hit me a short while later, with the high sugar content causing an irreversible crash. With a brew this good, however, it won't take a war to get me on my feet again. Terrific stuff, well worth a pickup. Share this brew, or don't come crying to me later."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A delicious beer, the richness and complexity of flavor is really incredible, it's a fantastic sipping beer but is also not as hot or sweet as you might expect for such a massive beer, this is my favorite beer from the Bruery, which is really saying something."
""
"O- It's amazing how undrinkable this beer was. Way too much sugary sweetness paired with the harsh booziness. It was a chore to drink 3 ounces. The hype behind this and Chocolate Rain confuse me as both are just hot boozy messes."
""
""
""
""
"Medium to thick mouthfeel and low carbonation. Thanks again Greg for sharing this bottle."
"Bottle 2010 vintage shared with many people, thanks to Weisguy! Beautiful opaque black brown with red shades, although very little head. Extremely volatile, the alcohol brings an wide aroma spectrum: dark fruits, cherries, bourbon, molasses and coconut. Flavors are pure chocolate (almost brownies) and bourbon with some cherries. Rich bodied and low carbonation, almost like a syrup. It was very tasty but too heavy to be pleasant to drink in large servings. An event in itself."
""
""
""
"Finally decided to open one of these. About 6 months on it I believe ,give or take. Pours jet black, with zero head. Nose is a bit boozy, but huge ""usual"" stout smells. Wayyy more chocolate than a typical stout though. The bourbon blends in nicely and doesn't overpower the beer at all. Just so much chocolate. A bit hot still, but I suppose that'll happen with 18% +. Mouthfeel, to me, for the size of the beer, is actually a bit small. Not as thick and vicious as I would expect, but still pretty full. Overall, this is one that I cannot wait to age for the next 5 years. Fantastic beer that lives up to the hype. So glad I finally got to try this."
""
""
"Black Tuesday is one-of-a-kind. That said, World Wide Stout scratches the same itch, IMO, and WWS is so much easier to get. But don't get me wrong -- Black Tuesday is without a doubt the superior beer. So incredibly smooth for 18%."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer is a beast. And at 18%+ it drinks like 10%, which isn't saying much because that is still big. the alcohol burn is there, but not what you would expect from something this big. I has Melange #3 which i thought was fantastic. This beer has reached the expectations that I had for this beer. I will seek out again for the cellar. When the Patrick and Tyler do it right, they do it right."
"Overall this one has tons of flavors that work together alright. After a few sips I think this just destroys the pallet. That's really what kill it for me; you can only taste it for the first few sips, afterwards your pallet is just hot ruined."
"This is of course a full bodied slow sipper with subtle carbonation. I like this. I would get it again."
""
"Pours a thick dark oil like body with light tan head that rings but doesn't lace. Liquid chocolate. Hints of liquorice & bourbon. So easy to drink. No heat at all for the high ABV. Sweet, but with a thinner finish. This is dessert in a glass. I could drink a whole bottle of this to myself, and then find myself under the table..."
""
"O- What can I say? Huge beer with a ton of sweet chocolate and big bourbon notes."
""
"O: Awesome beer, had back to back with Chocolate Rain. This one has a strong alcohol heat that leads to an intense sweetness. As it warms to 70 degrees appx, It really smooths out. Another sipper. Take your time and enjoy this one. It's a solid 4.4 to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer poured about as black as possible. Smelled very sweet, maybe fruit and chocolate. Taste was very much like the nose, Raisins and dark fruits took over on my pallet. I could get a hint of some chocolate mixed in but was not featured. I could taste a little of the bourbon barrel, but once again back seat to the fruitiness of the raisins. A solid beer I wouldn't mind having it again."
""
""
""
"*Anything in ""quotes"" was said by my girlfriend."
"Overall a great beer, but a couple things need to be better balanced to hide the bourbon a bit more and to ease the drinkability... needs to be smoothed out. I had a 2011 bottle so it's likely aged bottles will be better balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
"Next up: Chocolate Rain!"
"The mouthfeel Is oily and a little thick with carbonation being low. Overall, it was pretty good but not as great as I anticipated. The hot, boozy alcohol overshadowed some of the really great flavors to me. I can easily imagine this moving from very good to great with a few years of age on it. Hopefully I'll get a chance to revisit."
""
""
""
"A must taste - yet as a side note - many of the bourbon barrel aged beers at the Bruery are very similar."
""
""
"The beer pours jet black with no head except for a thin halo around the edges. The smell is slightly bready with tons of booziness. The cloying sweetness is absolutely absurd at first considering it's far sweeter than most barleywines I've had. However, the magic that this sweetness works is a beer with an 18%abv is now suddenly very drinkable and the alcohol that made this beer smell nearly toxic at first has literally vanished from the beer's profile. The taste leaves a lingering caramelized sugar/maple syrup sweetness followed by a slight burn from the alcohol letting you know it's still there. It has a potent, warming mouthfeel and I can see why this beer made such an excellent addition to the melange 3. This beer did me in for the night...couch time."
""
""
"O: Huge and delicious beer. Honestly, it tastes like someone mixed a big stout with a big english barleywine and barrel aged it. There is a SUPER sweet molasses and caramel element to go along with the bourbon and roasted malt that really reminds of of a barleywine. It cannot be emphasized enough how sweet this beer is, it is pure craziness. I actually wish there were more roasted malt to help balance out the sweetness, but given the huge ABV it would probably make the beer very harsh. Regardless, an intense beer that isn't just intense for the sake of a laugh. It's actually very tasty, reasonably well balanced and pretty drinkable given the ABV. I enjoyed it a lot. All 1200+ calories. Whew."

"I had the 2011 when it first came out and remember it being way too sweet and too hot at the time. On the other hand, the 2009 is fantastic, the sweetness and alcohol burn has mellowed and the flavors are complex. I think age has helped this beer a lot, although some say the recipe was supposedly different. Delicious beer overall, just have to remember to pace myself with it next time around - waking up the next morning was rough."
""
""
""
"O - This is among the best BA RIS I've ever had. This year in particular, not at all the '10/'11. Maybe it is the different recipe, maybe the time in the barrel, maybe the bottles just need time. There are a lot of wonderful similarities between this and an '07 BCBS. Barrel forward, fudge is evident."

"Overall an amazing brew. Pure ris with an American twist"
"O: Super beer with an extremely delicious very sweet aftertaste."

"I must say, this is fantastic. So complex, so much going on. At first the alcohol was a bit overpowering, but after drinking a glass of this you see that it fits in perfectly. I would like to try one of these with 3-4 years on it to see how it tastes a bit more blended. Wowâ€¦"
""
""
"Jet black, no light coming through this at all, ring of dark tan head, decent retention with very light lace. Smell is full of bourbon and oak, sweet scents come off in the way of bakers and milk chocolate, roasted and charred notes, coffee grinds, getting some coconut as well at points, but possibly the finest integration of bourbon and oak to a stout I have ever smelled. Taste like the nose is full of bourbon, definite sweetness but not cloying and about halfway through the glass it was basically unnoticeable, roasted malt, chocolate and coffee show up in generous amounts, incredibly complex, alcohol adds some heat but not as present as I expected. Lightly carbonated, full body and creamy, full feel but a times a little syrupy and thick, needed some sips of water every so often during this. Incredible stuff here, wish I had a bottle of my own to open up 5 years down the road but I was more than happy with a tulip of this beauty that I thought I would never get to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is undoubtedly one of the best imperial stouts out there. When it is fresh it can be a little too harsh for my liking but once the booze mellows it really comes into its own. I will never turn down one of these."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque super dark brown with a tan head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. No lacing on this one. Smell is of dark roasted malt, vanilla, wood, and bourbon aromas. Taste is amazing and is of dark roasted malt, dark fruits, vanilla, wood, and bourbon. This beer has a light level of carbonation with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an exceptional stout with a fantastic barrel aged presence."
""
"D - Really enjoyable stuff - the 2011 seems to be developing nicely as I thought it was a bit boozy last time I had it just before Christmas. I know there's been backlash against the hype on this beer, but it's really excellent and among the Bruery's best offerings. Just make sure you have friends on hand, as drinking more than 6oz will put you in the fast lane to incomprehensibility."
""
""
"Chocolate, coffee, bourbon, booziness. More bourbon than I care for, more chocolate than I require, and the coffee was OK. Black, small head, a ring of lace. Lots of coconut flavour, not unpleasant. All of the above are liked more by others. Some vanilla, it is very rich and smooth, I am highly preferential to Kate TG and even other imperial stouts in the ratings race.Thanks Tom for hooking me up with a 2010."
""

"The 2010 BT we had a few weeks back alongside Chocolate Rain was a significantly better beer. I won't be opening my other 2011s for at least 1.5 years. Great potential, needs time!"
""
""
""
"O-This beer is really hard to describe. It is pretty much everything you would imagine it to be. Incredibly alcoholic and tastes better than most other beers. Super thick yet slick with very good flavor that is masked in bourbon. The bourbon is strong but overdominates a little but I do not care that much. It is a great brew for special occasions."

"Wow. Let me just put that out there to start. Poured a super deep black, with a nice subtle tan head. Everything you'd expect in the aroma was right there. Big bourbon notes, with that burnt sugar/toffee/caramel scents. One of the best tasting beers I've had in a long time. Utterly complex, full of bourbon, toffee, and hints of vanilla that completely hid the ABV. Nice smooth finish, something truly amazing."
""
""
""
"When the crown was pried on this one, it was a gusher despite being fridge cold. The beer gushed maybe two ounces of beer, then immediately died out. It's like the beer was force carbonated, but the carbonation never actually made it into the beer. Pours black and obviously viscous with complete opacity. I could smell this beast as soon as I tapped it - it was like a chocolate tawny port. The nose on the beer was amazing with stone chocolate, dates, malt, malt, malt. The alcohol on the nose is strong, if not intimidating, but oddly inviting - like a bully in school you really admire. The flavor of this beer is fucking awesome. I am not particularly articulate in this form of verse, but I can say this - that bitch is fine! Thick and flat, just like in the Rare BCS, the lack of carb was fitting to this beer and I believe allowed for higher appreciation of the notes. A sincerely delicious beer, it made me smile when I drank it. The beer won the night for me."

"I was very lucky to obtain my overall #1 want in BA Secret Santa, courtesy of awalk. 2011 vintage, split with my cousin. The pour is tar black, viscous, thin tan head. The aroma has lots of bourbon, some cocoa. The taste has lots of bourbon, cocoa notes, strong malt back bone. Finishes hot. The beer is full bodied, light carbonation, obvious high abv. Lives up to hype, thrilled to have had the opportunity to try it."
"O: This is most certainly an A+ beer for me. Probably in my Top 3 for sure. It's just so well balanced and delicious. And with the ABV hidden the way it is, I was just blown away. Bravo to the Bruery. Solid work!"

"Overall this is a great imperial stout, a great sipping beer to be enjoyed with caution. Enjoy in front of a nice fire on a snowy night, just be careful not to end in the snow after a few glasses."

""
"Poured a pretty thick looking black with a small light tan colored head that fades into a lasting ring that leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is everything I could want in a stout. Bourbon with big roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. The taste is almost as good with lots of creamy chocolate, coffee, vanilla and roastiness the bourbon and alcohol also incorporate. Its got a creamy full body with light carbonation and a bit of heat, very enjoyable for a big stout. Would drink over and over /10"

"750ml brown bottle, shared by the Three-Rivers crew. 18,2% alc/vol therefore 2010 vintage. Nice brown colour with red hue, but where's the head ? The heavy alcohol transport all thso flavors of chocolate, cocoa, black chocolate, cherry blosom, blackstrap molasses, coconuts. This is one of my all-time ever favorite nose. This Imperial Stout tastes like molasses (it has the same viscosity !!) and some bourbon (it has the same alcohol content !!). I'm surprised how much I love this beer or is it all the alcohol that make my judgement off-road ?"

"Pours motor oil black with a thin mocha tan head that dissipates quickly leaving a flimsy thin layer head throughout. High alcohol heat and bourbon aroma are detected along with some burnt caramel and licorice, oak, vanilla, molasses which is exactly what the flavor suggests as well. As the session continues, the special-release brew offers a smooth and silky finish. Sticky medium-body with soft carbonation. A very nice and memorable high ABV Russian Imperial Stout. This was the first big beer of 2012 for me and glad I started the new year with a bang!"
""
""
""
""
"In thinking about the difference between this and a great RIS like Dark Lord, it strikes me that I would love for someone to figure out how to make a great RIS that was constantly available and very affordable. For Black Tuesday, on the other hand, I can't imagine having it more than once every four months or so, regardless of what it cost. Truly memorable, andI'm glad I had the opportunity."
""

"O - I don't give out many 5's but this one deserves it. The best RIS I've had, hands down."
""
"Overall: more please. I wish I could snag another couple of these to see how they develop over time!"
"1.5 D: This is a nasty, violent, and disease causing beer. I'm pretty sure I had temporary alcohol poisoning while I felt my beta cells shutting down. If I am still diabetes free, then I guess I won. I finished my glass, but didn't want to and certainly didn't want any more. If I ever want to drink this again, I'll save myself some money and mix equal parts vodka and maple syrup. Beers of this nature can be done with great success. Kuhnhenn's Solar Eclipse presents with the same booziness you'd find in a 7% IPA. WWS is a decent beer that becomes fantastic with age. This is a utter failure of an 18% stout."
"Wow absolutely amazing complex delicious flavors. Big alcohol burn in the chest and could take some time to open up but just delicious. Sweet melted chocolate fudge, milk chocolate, oak, coconut, toasted vanilla, blackberry, cherry, heavy cream, coffee, milk, leather and asphalt. Mouth is medium but matches what the ABV throws out. Delicious."
""
""
"Overall: Way too boozy. It was funny to have this one next to the 24% abv BD5 in which the alcohol is much more hidden. The opinions about this beer head-2-head with the BD5 differed at the end of the evening, but the majority preferred the BD5 over this one. For me it was not even a fair contest. Overrated and K.O. first round against the BD5!"
""

"Beer pours with minimal hed. Not quite as dark as I would have expected. Ring of off white head remains around the glass. Aroma is big vanilla, caramel, dark fruit, and bourbon. Flavor is pretty sweet. Lots of caramel, vanilla, dark fruits, and a bit of bourbon. Very nice and warming. A bit lighter mouthfeel than I would have expected. Nicely carbonated. Wow. I have had a few other bruery beers, but this one is clearly the best of the bunch. Though it was sweet, I would have expected something that was over 18% to be sweeter and boozier. Heat was well hidden in a nice smooth warmth. Outstanding beer."
"Overall, this is a nice beer. Not one of the Bruery's better efforts but a nice enough Imperial Stout. Not worth the price tag or effort to obtain for a Midwest guy with a shallow cellar."

"I had a 2011 Brooklyn black ops after this bad boy courtesy of R Moe Nay... It tasted like poland springs compared to the BT. I seriously thought he emptied the Black ops out and filled it with Guiness. This is one of those once in a lifetime beers that makes memories. Killer."

"Dr: A wonderful sipper, but difficult to drink on account of its high ABV. It's affordable for a small amount at the brewery, but rather unfairly expensive out of the bottle. I'd have it again at a fair price. Really quite nice."

"Black Tuesday is the best beer Iâ€™ve tried from the Bruery. I expected that. It is excellent beer. Itâ€™s packed with tons of flavor. The bourbon flavor is excellent and works its magic extremely well. My only two small complaints are that itâ€™s a bit too sweet and the alcohol is a bit much. I suspect itâ€™s integrated some over two years, but perhaps not that much. I didnâ€™t try it fresh. Itâ€™s definitely excellent beer nonetheless. Well worth seeking out."

"O: Yeah, this beer is awesome. Not worth more than the $33 I paid for it, but not worth less either. Lots of delicious, rich flavors, and very sweet. Black Tuesday joins the Dark Lord at the top of my favorite stouts list."
""
""
"O: Drinkability is well, good. For the style it is awesome but man is it hot n heavy by the numbers."
"Pours black with amber tinged edges, smallish brown head. Aroma is bourbon vanilla, juicy raisins, chocolate, redman tobacco, juiciness. Sweet chocolate, vanilla and oak, very decadent indeed. This is what SA TB should taste like sans the soy. Carbonation is medium low, fairly thick mouthfeel."

"Overall: I can definitely see why this one is so sought-after. EXTREMELY well-done!!! The bottle label says it can be cellared for ""decades", which did not surprise any of us. At 18%+ ABV, it's far from being a session beer. If you can get a bottle, though, I'd recommend splitting it among 3 or more friends as cosmonick did. You'll be the toast of the tasting!"

"O- Simply a must try beer. Not for the meek."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium to full body, light carbonation that is very soft, slick and oily on the tongue. For a 18+% beer, the alcohol is relatively well hidden, with some booziness on the nose and some warmth going down. A very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers to the folks at the Bruery!"
""
""
"O: Easily one of the best beers I've ever had. I was shocked how balanced and almost mellow this beer was fresh at over 18%. So much complexity and richness without ever being cloyingly sweet. This is going to be a perpetual top want of mine. It lives up to the hype."
"Edit - 2012 revisit. The malts got carried away in the newest vintage and it's just too sweet. Docking slightly for consistency because this vintage really isn't that great."

"o - overall the treats keep on coming and this was certainly not a let down. that being said, i am a bit surprised with all the hubbub about this beer when there are MANY as good or better beers out there that are not nearly as hard to get ahold of. not a disappointment by any means (as i loved it), but i guess i had a bit higher expectations."
""
""
"Overall an amazing beer. I really enjoyed this and would love to have it again."
""
""
""
"O- incredible. The crazy thing is, I think it will actually get BETTER with age, this really is a masterpiece. Probably my favorite beer."
""
""
""
""
"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. The sweetness and alcohol heat keeps it from being on par with Chocolate Rain, but it is still very much up there in terms of imperial stouts. Probably doesn't come across as much as the ABV would suggest, but it is noticeable. Although I am drinking half a bottle of this and half a bottle of Chocolate Rain side-by-side, I couldn't imagine drinking a whole bottle of this alone, but Chocolate Rain would probably be feasible."
"O: The drinkability is a bit tough on this one. In the end, it is very sweet and very boozy. Half a bottle was honestly a bit much to put down. With that said, it was phenomenally tasty and I was very happy to have tried it. I just was expecting a bit higher drinkability. Very good overall."

"overall, this was definatly one of the better stouts ive had, different than most. this one focuses more on the maple, sweet, sugary flavors where most focus on the roast. the alcohol may hurt this beer a little, mainly the aroma, but that could age out nicely. cant wait to try chocolate rain!!!!"
""
""
""
"I was really disappointed by how sweet and cloying this stout was. I've had the 2010 before (which I thought was a soy sauce bomb) so I wasn't expecting much from the '11 but, it didn't even meet my lowered expectations. Really, how does this beer have an A on BA? It's like the Bruery chaptalized the hell out of what may have been a very good base stout. I realize the residual sugar has to be high for a stout with 18% abv but, this was really over done. I think I need to go to the dentist..."

"I'd prefer this aged for at least a year to take out some of the sweetness."
"Overall this is my second favorite stout of all time. Simply superb. Makes me want to buy a reserve society membership just for this."
"What a treat! Thanks GraniteSkunk and abecall98! One of the best beers I've had all year. Amazing you see these people with dozens of this beer and we're all in astonishment just having one in our presence."
"O: What can I say..this lived up to the hype. Exceedingly drinkable. One of my favorite BA Stouts to date. Truly in a class of its own. I shall and will obtain more."
"O: I am happy to try this one, but I don't really want more than a 6 oz serving. I think that this is fine piece of work, however it is not really my bag."
"O: So glad I got 5 bottles of this year's vintage. Can't wait to do a side by side with my 2010 bottle."
"O - This is so fantastic. It lived up to the hype. Simply amazing!"
"Overall: A fantastic beer. This was split with my father and was enjoyed prevalently by both. What a fantastic beer to share. This one is going into my top 3 beers of all time. Took two hours to enjoy. Fantastic and amazing beer. The Bruery really knows how to make beer. What an amazing beer. Cheers to the Rue family."
"Overall: This is hands down one of the best barrel aged big stout if not the best one on the market. I had my reservations that at $30 a bottle this one would not be worth it but damn was I wrong. Almost perfect"
"O: Not my type of beer, but I can see why it is so popular."
"Overall: BT continues to set the standard for nose as far as I'm concerned, continues to present a very complex tasty palate, and continues to be sweet with a roasted malt finish that keeps it from being too sweet. The sweetness will be too much for some, but any brewery who can brew a high gravity monster with a great nose,a tasty, unique palate, and make it absurdly drinkable for the ABV is alright with me. I'd like to compare the 2010 and the 2011 in a year or so to see how the heat from the 2010 fares and how the sweetness in the 2011 comes through."
"A true dessert beer. The sweetness (surprised more reviews don't mention it) is the only thing that keeps this from being spectacular. It is also the first time a beer really made me feel more drunk, sip by sip. Very well hidden alcohol, would take some alcohol flavor for a cut in sweetness though."
"Can't say enough about it, it's one of the best beers EVER produced."
"Between this, Chocolate Rain, and S'More Tuesday, this was my least favorite."
"Overall: a great beer. Very complex, boozy, but not overly so considering the ABV. Worth the hype."
"750 ml bottle generously shared by colonelforbin. Thanks Mike. 2010 vintage. Pours a dark black with a small light brown head that disappears pretty quickly. No lacing, which isn't surprising given the ABV. It does leave some legs on the glass when swirled. Aroma is big fudge brownie, vanilla, bourbon, and certainly quite a bit of alcohol as well. The taste is quite sweet with a lot of fudge brownie. A bit of vanilla, some caramel, and lots of bourbon as well as a bit of oak. Warming alcohol is noticeable on the finish. There's a light astringency as well. Full bodied. Manages to be very sweet without being syrupy. Low carbonation. Very good beer. I'm glad to have tried it, but it is not something I could drink a lot of."
"O: Simply wow! I don't believe in hype, but i can see what the clamor is about over this one. It is a bit sweet & boozy, but that seems to be the hallmark here. The way all the flavors are weaved in is simply mouthwatering. Quite an impressive brew. Older vintages must be drinking amazing."
"To put it simply: this is a masterpiece."
"D - Unbelievably drinkable...19.5%, really? Drinks like a much lower alcohol beer. This is unbelievably good stuff. Thinking about cracking a second bottle, but don't think the trading partners who already have this reserved would appreciate that."
"The hype behind this beer is definitely merited. With so many competing flavors at work, this beer could have easily been a muddled mess. Instead, it borders on perfection like no stout I've tried before. I shudder to think what the 2009 version tastes like today, though this one is drinking pretty perfectly right now. Worth every penny."
"anybody got a spare bottle?"
"Black Tuesday pours just like the name suggests. It might have been my imagination, but I'd swear the lights actually flickered when I cracked the bottle. The dark caramel head drew itself up to about three fingers in height, before fading away somewhat quickly, and not leaving anything in the way of lacing. I starting picking up the nose a little bit when I popped the cap and poured, but when I first leaned into the glass my nose got absolutely blasted. This thing smells rich beyond belief. It's the aroma of a decadent chocolate cake that had some bourbon added into the batter. It's pungent, and it smells great, but if there was a little bit more complexity it would be perfect. Ask and ye shall receive, because Black Tuesday absolutely crushes it flavor wise. That bombastic bourbon chocolate cake is still by far the centerpiece, but it's supplemented by sensations of dark fruit and molasses. There's a slight warming from the alcohol, but it's pleasant, and nowhere near how intense it should be for a beer its size (even after a year). The body is impossibly rich and creamy, and the carbonation is perfectly dialed in to prevent the beer from becominy syrupy, while maintaining its malt forward nature. I wouldn't change a thing. Holy hell does Black Tuesday live up to the hype. I grabbed two bottles last year, and cracked this one to see if it was worth trying to get more bottles going forward. The answer is a resounding yes!"
"As a comparison, the 2009 was everything I hoped it would be. Easily an A+ beer. The flavors of the base beer were allowed to come forth and play a better supporting role for the beautiful bourbon barrel, which resulted in an absolutely decadent brew. Massive and superbly balanced nose and palate, with a great look to boot, this might be my favorite American brewed bourbon barrel aged imperial stout. With some time, I can only hope the 2010 vintage will smoothen out like this, and hopefully future vintages will follow suit. I will constantly be on the lookout for this brew. Thanks to everyone for a great time, and another huge cheers to those who made this evening possible."
"Cheers!"
"Poured an absolute pitch black with a slight ring of mocha head that recedes to a slight haze. Ominous. Nose is fantastic, just huge aromas of dark, sweet malt, chocolate, and molasses with insane Bourbon characteristics of oak, vanilla, and caramel. Taste follows the nose in the best possible way, nothing but darkest malt, molasses, chocolate and Bourbon. So smooth and complex. Mouthfeel is expectedly syrupy and viscous, with a full body and low carbonation. Bit of pleasant chest-fire from the +18% ABV, but I sure don't mind! Overall a mind-blowingly insane beer, so excited to finally experience this beast!"
"O: Very unique brew, too much alcohol in the nose takes away from the experience but tastes quite good, especially as it warms up. Nice warming after each sip.."
"O - Awesome brew. It definitely deserves the hype but maybe note the price ;). Great full body with awesome flavors that linger for a long time."
"O: Overall this was a pretty good RIS. Not as thick as I was hoping for, but the barrel aging component of this beer was damn good. A little sweeter than I expected, but this doesnâ€™t detract from the overall experience. In fact, I liked it that way. 4"
"Overall, way overhyped! Probably the best BA stout I have had, but not worth trading a cellar over. I love this stout, but would easily keep some Bourbon County over it. Once it is more readily available, we'll see."
"-GFunk"
"O: I was definitely a fan of this one, but it's a beer you really only need a small amount of. We split the bottle 4 ways and that was just fine with me, I didn't really need to have more than that. We all kinda came to the conclusion that it's a great dessert beer, but I'm not sure it's more than that. I'd love to try it with some age, and I'm glad I got to try it, but I can't think of a time where I would really ever be craving to drink this beer again."
"Overall: This was a good beer and I think the Bruery executed what they wanted out of this beer, but I think it is just too over the top for me."
"O-- Had no expectations on this and it was impressive. No way I could drink a 750 on my own. Found it to be enjoyable and interesting mostly due to how complex it is. I thought very similar to Bourbon County Vanilla but much smoother and more complex."
"Overall this beer was very enjoyable and unique. Do not think I could handle a huge amount of this beer myself due to the large doses of residual sweetness, but it works well in a tasting context. Very much worth trying."
"O= This isn't as transending as I thought it would be. It is mostly just different because the hype and following this beer has. Worth checking out for sure and an amazing beer but it isn't nearly what people have said it is. In the end this is still a huge RIS with a ton of sugars in it. For what this beer is and where it came from I will say it is great though. Worth checking out but not worth blowing the bank. I think most local RIS's have a more nostalgic effect and are usually better per individuals taste."
"O- Very grateful to dougofthefuture for bringing this beer to the dinner tonight, Iâ€™ve been wanting to try any vintage I could get a hold of and now I finally have. Big Big beer that I hope to get a hold of again."
"Overall this was good but the booze was very in your face unlike the previous vintage. Also, I didnt get nearly enough of the bourbon barrell character that I did in the '09. This one needs time."
"This 2009 bottle was awesome, i really dug it. i wonder how this beer is fresh though."
"2009 vintage. This one pours a viscous oily midnight black with no head. It smells of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and intense dark fruit sweetness. It has a really sweet nose. It drinks of chocolate coffee syrup and is insanely flavorful despite the sweetness. The chocolate and dark fruits work very well together. It's smooth, thick, and syrupy and could be hard to finish due to sugar and alcohol but its an intense imperial stout. This is just a massive beer and despite the abv, is not too hot having mellowed slightly, being the 2009 vintage. While good, I don't know why this vintage demands so much on the trade block."
"O: A really solid and impressive beer that is not for the light of heart. There are better stouts out there of this caliber, but over-all the hype is pretty close to worth it. Thanks again Mike for the pour."
"The reveal: Bruery Black Tuesday. Dude you are a maniac!"
"Recommended, but maybe a bit underwhelming - just not as complex as I'd hoped for - maybe with more time the bourbon would chill out a bit and mingle in with the other flavors but for me that overly bourbony aspect detracted from my overall enjoyment of the beer."
"This is pretty much the concent of my group - not sure about the high ratings on here"
"The beer pours like motor oil with a thin barely there dark head. the smell is sweet boozy with a noticeable bourbon smell. the taste is hot boozy and cloyingly sweet. this beer reminds me of dark lord, ( which i thought was highly overrated). the mouthfeel is thick and its hard to get the coating feel out of your mouth. between everyone at the tasting it was probably a 50/50 split of love hate. i gave the rest of my pour to my brother who enjoyed it. in my opinion this beer is one to avoid"
"O: Overall, very impressed! Very complex flavoring, that is beyond my less experienced palette. Also, want to give a BIG THANK YOU to The Bruery for pulling our ticket in the lottery give-away. We now have a bottle of Black Tuesday to keep and save for a special occassion. VERY excited to try it again!"
"Cheers!"
"Ultimately I am really glad I was able to try this. So much hype around it that it pulls you in. It was a good beer but not excellent or the best I've ever had by any means. There were other stouts poured at this tasting as well. In my opinion Rare was far superior. If you don't have to trade away half your cellar it is worth a shot."
"The taste is just as much going on in the beer as the smell, if not more. I get vanilla, bourbon, caramel, a little roasty, and just a great balance of a ton of flavors. This beer is super-complex and super alcoholy, but quite delicious."
"A brewing achievement but not beer like; delicious nonetheless. I am very glad that I got to try it, and I don't think I could have without Joe's generosity. Thanks again!"
"The noticeable abv makes it a dry finish after swallowing, but this beer was super sweet with lots of rich malt and thereâ€™s no way I could enjoy more than 3oz."
"O: This is one that lives up to the hype! Very, very happy I have a bruery connection and can look forward to having another one of these, bourbon aged stout heaven!"
"Rich and fudgy (understatement), caramel toffee, almond fudge, fried plantains, warm chocolate syrup. Mucho dry roast and bitter bakers chocolate in the aftertaste. So decadent. Impossibly dense, fudgy and chewy to the nth degree, a perfect liquid dessert. About 4 oz. is enough for one sitting, although I could certainly drink more if I forced myself."
"O: I found this to be slightly better than average. The alcohol makes it near impossible to finish by yourself. I figured after 2 years that it would have tamed down some but it was still pretty hot. This might be better in another couple of years. I will re-visit in 2 years and re-rate."
"Overall: This is a tremendous beer. It is like an almond joy bar in liquid form. If you don't like big sweet bourbon bombs, this is not the beer for you. But, if you are like me and love sweeter stouts...damn this is good."
"Drink- I sat on this bottle since its release in October for a special occasion and I fiqured a birthday to be one of them. I am sure Ill keep trying to acquire this year to year. Wonderful brew! To the team at The Bruery. Nicely done."
"O - I did not find this brew to be exceptionally hot; it is, however, definitely on the sweet side. I tend to like some relatively sweet beers, if they are well done; exquisite (and disparate) examples that come to mind are JW Lees Harvest Ale, Kuhnhenn Raspberry Eisbock, BCS Rare, TREAT, 100% BA Coton, Vanilla DL, Brandy Hunahpu, Westvleteren 12, Gouden Carolus Cuvee Van De Kaiser Blauw, etc. This is definitely a brew of that ilk, in terms of being a delicious nectar of the Gods, and it is as good as any one of the aforementioned brews."
"Old draft review. Poured a rich, oily midnight black color with a hint of dark brown foam on top. Aromas of bourbon, dark chocolate, oak, vanilla and roasted malt. On the palate, this one is thick and full bodied, with flavors of dark fruits, huge bourbon, oak, vanilla, dark chocolate and hot alcohol. An insanely delicious and exceptional beer."
"Overall - great beer, I realize its very hyped but I'm impressed with what I got when I got to try it"
"D - I could probably drink half the bottle myself before the sweetness would take it's toll, however I would never do that because this a gem that can only be shared with a few people. What a great treat!"
"[edit: since had this a few times and am dinging it a bit because none of my other goes have been quite as good as the original review]"
"Overall - It's great. Very happy to have enjoyed this beer. I am supremely excited to open up the rest of the bottles I have in the future, and am looking forward to going to the Black Tuesday event again this year."
"M/D: Thinner than the style would suggest, good carbonation. Thought this would have benefited from being thicker, or maybe I just should not have expected it. The alcohol is very present, but it makes itself known after the swallow right in the middle of the chest. Very much like a whisky would. Awesome beer though."
"Mouthfeel is extremely thick and it really coats the mouth and lingers long after the sip. I think this one will age well but its kind of hot and intense now. Without the hype, I doubt it would get such high numbers."
"The hype is well-deserved â€” Black Tuesday is a monstrous, flavorful, delicious beer made for sipping and sharing. Pair it with chocolate-dipped cookies like I did and even a stock market crash wouldnâ€™t phase you."
"There is a prickly alcohol presence with due to the gravity of this delectable brew. This isn't so much balanced, per se, but rather well proportioned, as nothing with this much bourbon, booze, and barrel characteristics can strive to be anything more balanced than this is"
"O: An amazing beer, and real treat to taste every time. (though I do like Chocolate Rain better) It's not hard to tell that the claim on the bottle (will age for decades) will likely be true, given that it is over 18% ABV, so it will age much like a Port wine imho. I'm very thankful I still have a bottle of the 2009, and two of the 2010 in my cellar. As part of the RS,(which to me personally, was worth every penny, and I'm enjoying being a part of it) I'm looking forward to the 2011 batch."
" A cage match in a glass between the sweet and the booze which can be fatiguing. Think I'll skip the next train fuel station and just pour Black Tuesday into the tank. A powerhouse of a stout."
"D: Split amoungst 8 people, the group was unamiously impressed by this beer. Certainly worthy of the praise it gets but may be a little too high on the hype scale. Trust me, I would drink this all the time if possible but it's just way too hard to get"
"Poured into snifter revealing a deep brownish black color. Slight head that was erased without any residual lacing on the glass. Really enjoyed the smell on this one. I picked up sweet chocolate and brown sugar with some vanilla and oak. Tasted very similar with brown sugar shining through with some chocolate, toffee, bourbon and sweet vanilla. Pretty thick and syrupy, but it blended pretty well and anymore could have been too much on the taste. Very drinkable for + 18% and as it warmed up I enjoyed this beer more even though it was the last one open at our tasting."
"D. Incredibly drinkable for 18.2%. Complex and interesting. Sweet without being too cloying."
"Pours a very dark black with some gorgeous reddish tints on the edges, a touch of off white head. Very Solid thick appearance. Smells incredibly sweet and chocolatey. Tons of brown sugar o the nose. Tastes like chocolate syrup and brown sugar! Tons and tons of sweetness. Very sweet and overpowering but incredibly drinkable for being 18.2%. Surprisingly drinkable.."
"O-wow. Definetly worth they hype. Delicious brew"
"EDIT: Man, just had my first bottle of the 2011 last weekend during the Lesnar/Overeem fight. Might be the best one yet, and the appearance is just delightful."
"O: Split four ways, it was a long drink. Excellent for an evening movie but a challenge at a tasting. We mostly just enjoyed small sips. Glad I tried it but wouldn't trade as much as I did for another."
"D - Not the easiest thing to drink. Thank God that I didn't have to drink this by myself. Although it was a pretty good beer, I think the hype train has taken this for a ride. I'm really glad I got to try it but I won't be seeking it in the future. We even mixed a bit of it with some 120 IPA to make a really extreme black and tan...it was an improvement. Thanks Ryan!"
"The bourbon and oak are backed down a bit in the taste on this vintage, and sweet caramel, molasses, and dark fruits reign supreme. The oak and bourbon fall to the background. A very sweet dessert beer. Heat is evident, though it presents more of a warming than a burn. One of the best out there. Wish there were more chocolate and bourbon flavors like the 2010, but just as good if not a little better than last years."
"The fullest of full bodies, lower carbonation, syrupy and sticky from top to bottom. This beer is ridiculously drinkable for the ABV, and the flavors are as absolutely mindblowing as the internet hype makes them seem to be. Don't be fooled, this is a one-of-a-kind beer."
"Wow, what a beer! Celebrating Fat Tuesday with a Black Tuesday. This is from the first batch. For such a high alcohol beer there is an impressive head and while there is no lace the covering and ring on top is pretty. Smell leaves me impressed with the barrels used. Bourbony alcohol and light oak hit first but then there is a huge cherry and faint chocolate smoke. Vanilla and burnt caramel accentuates the overall sweetness. Taste is superb. It follows the nose but builds with a bigger oak component and a sublimated bourbon. Cherry sweetness has me seeing a box of Godiva as the chocolate is so milky. Vanilla flavored dark roasted malts, Bourbon is perfectly integrated and this reminds me of a bigger BB version of Kate. For the abv the alcohol is nigh on invisible. Don't get me wrong. You know it is there but nowhere near the actual level. Feel is amazingly carbonated for the amount of booze in the glass and it compliments the light syrupy feel perfectly. Sticky but easy to swallow and Pappy Van Winkle smooth. Drinkability is criminal. This goes down like Brooklyn Chocolate stout at almost twice the strength. So glad I've finally opened a bottle."
"Black Tuesday is absolutely worth it's hype. It's a beer every craft beer lover needs to get their hands on an sample at some point in time. Nicely done, boys."
"D: Strong? Indeed. A good stout that makes use of its barrel provenance. It's big though, too big to really dig into."
"I'm really glad to have gotten the chance to try this. Imagine the combination of Abyss roast, Dark Lord sweetness, and Black Albert molasses and cigar character, all with a champagne wine character vs. port."
"Thanks Abel!"
"Truly an outstanding beer, well worth the hype. It takes talent to craft a beer so massive and still being absurdly drinkable. From the aroma, to the flavor and mouthfeel everything about this beer is exceptional. The alcohol is very well disguised, very minimal burn. This is certainly not drinkable in the sense of quantity, it is however in the sense it would be far too easy to drink too much."
"D - My wife could not finish hers (too boozy), so my 5ozs turned to around 9ozs. After that much, I was done, but the booze began to dominate. I dinged it a couple points just because of that."
"Well done, Bruery! You deserve much respect for this beer. Cheers!"
"Great beer overall and Patrick impresses me yet another time."
"Before i begin, this has been one of the best beers I've ever had. It pours a midnight chocolate with a beautiful inch-thick head. You can immediately smell the bourbon-barrel and chocolate/cocoa nibs. Also get some vanilla scent towards the back end. This thing tastes like Heaven. I immediately taste the dark fruit, chocolate and bourbon. Breathe while twirling the beer in your mouth and your palate will also pick up on some vanilla and slightt oak. Not too effervescent, and after every sip, I felt like an oil sheath of Black Tuesday was left on my tongue. In terms of drinkability, I would replace this with water if I could..."
"D: Considering the extremely high ABV this one went down fairly easy, but with notable alcohol in the aftertaste. I would definitely have it again, but to be honest was a little under whelmed given the enormous amount of attention this beer gets."
"I got told by this beer. Period. I wanted to hate it, but it was amazing. My standard proclamation needs an addendum - ""support your midwest breweries, but get your hands on some Black Tuesday."""
"All in all, this is a great beer. Super thick and hot. Very chocolaty and delicious. If you like stouts, you definitely should try this at least once. If you don't like boozy brews, then this is not for you."
"I was fortunate enough to attend a tasting put together by ShadesOfGray and this gem was definitely the highlight of the night. Serving was a 2009 vintage. Appearance was very dark with an almost maroon-ish head which disappears quickly. Smell is of coarse a very strong bourbon highlight, dark chocolate, and dark fruits. Plumb maybe? As far a taste goes I'm blown away. considering we just had Kate previous to this, BT is a big step up. Strong bourbon taste, good amount of vanilla thrown in there. Chocolate is big in this, and a variety of darker fruits. Its very thick, motor oil thick. Nice hearty burn on the way down. This is by far the best stout i have ever encountered."
"2010 version - it seemed that molasses wasn't as prominent and this was not as sweet as the 2009 version, albeit it was still extremely sweet."
"D-For 18+% it is surely more drinkable than expected but it becomes tedious and uninteresting after awhile. I don't think I could ever drink an entire 750 ml bottle on my own without some money on the line. Good? Sure! Life altering, no!"
"This thing is unique and complex, but it's also a sticky, jumbled mess. I don't want to try this one again."
"D: Sweet as hell, but man is this tasty. A sipper for sure, but complex and amazing. Damn, I see why Overlord drinks this everyday."
"D - Definitely boozy overall and unbalanced toward sweetness but very good and different regardless. This begs to a) be sipped and b) be shared. I wouldn't open a bottle of this without at LEAST two other guys to share it with."
"""This was my beer of the day!"""
"Overall this beer is pretty tasty and easier drinking than expecting considering the ABV but it's a bit one dimensional and thinner bodied than I prefer for the style."
"Thanks to BeerFMAndy for sharing."
"2009 Vintage! Served from bottle into a snifter while at Beechwood BBQ with a lot of Cali BAs after the Bruery Party. Poured pitch black with a minimal tan head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, dark chocolate, and slight alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, alcohol, and maple syrup. It had a heavy feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this brew was nothing short of excellent. Had a great flavor and aroma going on here that invited you to come back for more. This vintage was still a little hot, but still great. Massive thanks to the BA who shared this one (can't remember who it was but BM me if it was you and I will give you appropriate credit). Definitely glad I got to try this one!"
"This beer absolutely lives up to the hype and is worth seeking out by any means necessary. I have never had a beer at this high ABV (19.5%) and been able to detect very little of the booze. You do have to drink it slowly, because of how heavy it goes down and just for the purpose of enjoying every last sip. My friend and I both agree that this is like a fudge cake/brownie wrapped into one of the most unique and exceptional beers you can have of this style. It is without a doubt a special occasion beer and one worthy of that occasion. I think the year of age on it as well had some to do with the drinkability."
"I like this beer and would like to drink some more of it, but you really want to have someone around to help share it with as it will mess you up."
"Overall a great beer, but not something you could ever drink an entire bottle of."
"I think that 2011 will be a good year. And for a year that starts out with a glass of Black Tuesday, it has already eclipsed the previous year."
"Kept this for a year and then opened it today to enjoy it's earthly pleasures; slow sipper is an understatement, I nursed this bomber. Outstanding taste and beer experience, this was delicious and while it messed me up from the high ABV, I enjoyed each and every sip of this world class brew. I highly recommend this beer and advise everyone to grab a bottle if they can."
"M + D: Thick and rich, yet slick and smooth and easy to take back. Nice warming without being ""hot"" or otherwise boozy. Again, a well balanced big beer that I'm pleased to have tried"
"Low carbonation, probably due to the way I had it, but it worked well and I thought it was a nice creamy match for the flavors. The only real negative is the packaging, this type of beer should be sold in smaller bottles. I would never want to open it without a small crowd. Excellent."
"Poured into a tulip glass a dark brown with slight reddish brown highlight on the rim. The head is very slight and forms a tan head around the collar of the glass. The aroma is very boozy with notes of molasses, vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate, and toffee. The alcohol burns the nose as you inhale a deep breath. The taste is sweet with hints of bourbon, dark roast, chocolate, and booze. The booze somewhat overpowers this and I kind of wish it was dialed down a tad but that being said, for the abv this is pretty smooth drinking. Warms as you drink this beer. No lace but it has legs for gods sake! Medium/heavy mouthfeel. This beer is pretty sweet flavor wise. For being such a high abv beer it really is decent but given the choice on an everyday basis, I would rather have a lower abv imperial stout."
"Lets be real here, your not going to pound a 16oz glass of this but damn would I love to try. This is very slow sipping and isn't for the faint of heart so its drinkability is a little lower but still makes for a epic tasting ale."
"I actually looked into airplane tickets to attend the brewery release this year. At the time I thought it may not be worth it after adding up all the costs. Hopefully Patrick Rue can make a few more bottles of this for next year and maintain this level of quality because I will be trying like crazy to get tickets for the 2011 party. If I manage to do so, I don't expect to be the only new face there. This never was a secret to faithful local patrons of The Bruery and now I'm very much in the know as well. I hope to see everybody there next year!"
"And the elusive Black Tuesday sits in my glass. Nice. it pours a straight obsidian topped by a half-finger of light ecru foam. The nose comprises rich bourbon, chocolate syrup, roasted malts, molasses, and oak. Smells like the hype might ring true. The taste, though, ensures that it does not. The bourbon is far too hot, the chocolate is just a step too sweet, and these combined with a hefty dose of roasted malts produce an unnerving prickle on the tongue. It's clear there was a damn good idea in place for this beer, but it doesn't seem as though it was carried out very well. Perhaps some age would have done it some good, but I'm not sure I'll find that out. As it stands, the flavors are just too all over the place to work properly. The body is a hefty-ish medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a semi-chewy feel. Overall, though disappointing, I was very glad to have been able to try this brew. I can see why many would love it, but it's just not working for me."
"This beer pours a decently black brown with a little bit of beige head up front. This beer is nice and bourbon and fruity esters on the nose. The oak flavor mixed with caramel and brown sugar work really well with this. I'm truly enjoying this beer, I wish I had the willpower to have aged this at least a year because the high ABV is still running a little hot. I still have no problem enjoying this beer and drinking it with my many friends."
"(D)- A sipper if there ever was one, however a tasty one at that. Extremely rich and sweet, but bringing it to a warmer temperature helped that out a bit. Glad to have finally tried this, but it is not worth giving your firstborn child for. It is very good mind you, but not THAT good to require you trading away your prized beers from your cellar to acquire."
"The drinkability is low due to the fact that you can't have very many of these. It's so rich and heavy in alcohol. It's quite the treat but a doozy."
"This is a great beer, but I think it is over-hyped. It would probably be in my top-10 of stouts, but not top 5."
"D: What a tasty brew. With time this will probably be a five for me also, if only I can get someone to trade me one of these! I've tried trading lots of stuff for this on here already and honestly I'm glad I never went all out to get one, as it is great great beer but not one to give all you have for. I'm so fortunate that I could get hooked up with this last night, it's a great brew! I may be planning to go to the release next year if I can!"
"d - Overall I thought this was an amazing beer; one of the best barrel aged stouts I've ever had. While this beer is super hyped and I have been disappointed with some of their hyped beers in the past, this one lived up to the hype. I think it looks and smells great, and has a wonderful mouthfeel, but is a tiny bit hot. I think in 6-12 months this could be even better, if the heat dies down a tiny bit. Either way, if you like bourbon barrel aged stouts you'll still love this one now. Would love to get another bottle of this."
"Overall this beer has always had a ton of hype and i can tell you that it has exceeded all of my expectations, this probably was one of the most epic beer moments for me. I can say one thing for sure and that is ""I will be at the next release of this beer""."
"Pitch black pour with a dark tan head poured into a chalice. Sticks all over the glass I swirl it around. Deep roasty, fudgy, chocolate, and sherry aroma. Some molasses and burnt sugar there as well. Flavor follows the nose. Dark cocoa bar with a sweet bourbony/brown sugar backbone. Roast takes a back seat to the sweet stout flavors. Great thick body, sticks around long after the beer is gone. Unbeleivably drinkable - the 19.5% ABV is incredibly well hidden (compared to other high ABV stouts / strong ales that I have had). Totally lived up to the hype, very happy I got to try this."
"D: My second time having this. I like it enough, but I'm not a big fan. It's overall too sweet and too 'big', and my palate is too overwhelmed to pick out the nuances. Still, $30 is a decent price point for one or two bottles, because the beer goes over very well with my family. It makes the centerpiece of a nice tasting; beer nerd and layman alike enjoy it. The primary value of this beer (to me) is not in drinking it alone or even trading it, but in using it to convert beer neophytes. The Bruery fills that niche very well."
"I had this once last year and was lucky enough to score a bottle again this year, and it really is an exceptional beer. Definitely one that lives up to the hype. A great beer to enjoy slowly and with company on a cool evening."
"drinkability 4.5- i would only like to say that i didnt give it a 5.0 because of how strong the the abv is for a beer. so i dont want people to think this is a negitive 4.5..its just my thoughts...whould def have to agree with my best man that this is by far the best stout i have ever have and i would take alot for one to beat it"
"It pours a deep seducing black, with a carmel head that dissipates gracefully. Once you pop the wax cap off, the enormous aromas fill the room, at times too strong for the weak of nose. Bringing your face closer to the glass, your nostrils are filled with the thick aromas of chocolate, coffee, caramel and vanilla. The bourbon barrel aging makes it's appearance here, but it's not until the first sip that you can tell how long it has been sitting there. The Bourbon is strong, but smooth. At 18.2% the alcohol is definitely present, but it glides across your palate effortlessly. The sweetness is incomparable. Like a rich brownie, I find myself struggling to lift it to my lips, but the notion of how good it tastes keeps me trucking through. I'm mortified to see how this will age. My favorite stout by far!"
"D: Thick, delicious and smooth, however a couple of half pours is about all one needs to completely enjoy this amazing beverage. This is definitely one to be shared with friends."
"I'd say this is more of a dessert beer. It drinks very nice but don't think you can finish a bottle by yourself."
"Dark, dark brown, almost black. The smell is pure sweetness. The taste is syrupy sweet and complex. Surprisingly little alcohol taste for a beer of this ABV but after drinking I definitely get the warm mouthfeel that lets me know there was a lot of alcohol in there. The most amazing thing about this beer though is the way it coats the tongue. This is like beer concentrate, it coats the tongue like an oily syrup. This beer is a truly amazing experience. For a beer of this ABV it is amazingly drinkable. The sweetness is a bit much, I don't know that I could drink a pint of it but it would be wonderful served in a snifter or tulip glass as an after dinner drink."
"D- This is such a delicious beer. Smooth and rich. Full bodied and quite filling, yet I want to drink more."
"D - Huge. Couldn't even imagine drinking an entire bottle, but a glass with a few friends and some light cheese, it's very easy."
"Drinkability - The few ounces I had dissipated relatively fast given the alcohol content. I did not taste alcohol in the beer, though I did feel its warming effects. A very enjoyable beer and I am glad I was able to make my way with it. I will look for you again soon, my Black Tuesday gal."
"This is a huge beer, I'm glad I got a chance to try it. If you like bourbon this beer is for you. Even though I enjoyed it, I don't think I would seek this beer out again. It's not bad, just way to strong. Took forever to finish it."
"Sampled at GABF on 9/18/2010. This Imperial Stout pours a deep black color from the tap. Medium sized tan foamy head. The aroma is chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, vanilla and woody with some alcohol. A full bodied Imperial Stout. A VERY BIG Imperial Stout. The malts are chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, some bourbon and some cherry. The hops are herbal. This beer has a big alcohol presence, I mean a whole lot of alcohol, the first sip and smell are dominated by the alcohol, after that the other flavors start coming through. There is a nice mix of malts, sweetness, vanilla and wood going on here, once you get past the big alcohol blast. This beer has an awesome potential for aging. It is very good now, but a couple or five years of bottle aging would make this beer even more amazing. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Black Tuesday, I take back all the bad things I said about you. You pour the deepest black with a charcoal head that crowns you for ages, clinging to the sides of my tulip, coating my glass in alcohol as I tilt it. You smell of chocolate covered cherries, sherry, sizzling burnt brown sugar, the aroma touching my nostrils like a solid. You taste of Zeus's nectar, candied cherries, port wine filled Belgian chocolate, tingling umami and a finish of the finest sherry. Your alcohol touches me, causing exaltation, erotic in sensation yet questioning in just how smooth you are. You animal. You chewy, oily, full bodied beast. You coat my palate and touch my throat nearly erotically in your thickness. You satisfy me. You touch my lips, my tongue, my throat, and my soul; your drinkability is spiritual. Your flavor is robust and gorgeous, you defy expectations for the umpteenth time. I love you."
"[Bottle] shared by tytoanderso. Pours a not very viscous looking black with a quickly dissipating tan head. Aroma is very sweet, and I actually get some cabernet sauvignon, touch of smokiness, oddly a touch of tartness, strong alcohol, chocolate, light soy sauce, and, of course, alcohol. Ungodly sweet, but the alcohol manages to dilute it a little bit, kind of tastes like syrup without the thick gooey texture, amazing alcohol presence, roasted malt, not too much else. Really lacks the complexity that something like the Hunapu's has and the subtlety that the Narke has."
"Well, damn. This is an excellent, excellent brew that I'm going to be sipping for a good hour or more. Memorable, & worth the effort of seeking out."
"D: I wonder if I will ever get to try this again? The only way I see how is if my work schedule would allow me to take time off to fly to Cali and get some on that day. Or....I could just wait for my friend to score another bottle. I'm still in awe of this amazing brew and of the fact that I got a very generous sample of it!"
"D: While it definitely seems like a strong beer, I am amazed that it weighs in at 19.5% abv. That's insane. I had 6-8 ounces and thoroughly enjoyed every sip. Highly recommended."
"Pours like glorious motor oil. Very dark, with a very thin head. Smells great, vanilla, coffee, roasted malts, chocolate, bourbon, oak, and alcohol. Starts with a very strong flavor including vanilla, coffee, and chocolate, followed up by a stronger bourbon, oak, and alcohol taste. Simply amazing. Very hard to drink fast though. It's pretty hot, but way to hard to put down."
"D: This is one of the richest, boldest, and most complex beers I've had. On par with Utopias, but a stout instead of a barleywine. The scent and taste and body were all nearly overpowering. The alcohol was clearly present also, so it must be sipped, but it was so delicious. Just 3 ounces is more than enough for a serving, but that little bit can be savored for a long time. Fantastic brew that meets the hype."
"I don't know if any beer deserves the hype that this one has gotten, but it sure does it's best. Great beer."
"I love the complexity of this beer and it's very heavy indeed so go slow. The mouthfeel is moderately heavy but the complexity of flavors make it seem more thick. Love this beer"
"D: Not particularly drinkable. Tasty in limited quantity, and at cellar temperature or refrigerated temperature. However, a full glass is a disaster in waiting, and room temperature is out of the question."
"O: Really? That's It? You just reviewed one of the most EPIC beers ever in ~ 63 words? Yes I did and here is why. This beer tasted pretty straightforward to me: It's sweet and rightfully so for an 19% beer. Comparable to Dark Lord, if you removed the fruit and complex notes, I believe you would have black tuesday. Black Tuesday is boozy and sweet. Did the beer hype around this one blow my mind? Yes...The beer itself? Not so much. Tasty yes, drinkable yes, would I give my first born? No. I'm glad I can put to rest the aggravating ambitions of trying to secure one of these bottles for myself."
"This is a stunning beer in that it is overflowing with flavor, clocks in at over 19% ABV and still drinks way, way too easily. Compared to the few other beers I've had in this ABV range, this is the only one I would categorize as world class. Well done Patrick."
"Drinkability: Because of the ridiculous ABV, this is obviously a sipping beer. Because of the cost, I would call this a very special occasion beer. I thought this was everything it was cracked up to be."
"D--I say it's great, though most would disagree due to the high alcohol content. I counter that by saying just share it with someone or sip on this one for an hour or more while watching a good movie, game, etc. GREAT beer."
"Drinkability: Well, 19.5%. Do I need to say much more? It's a great brew to share for a very nice event, but I'd never have a large glass of this."
"Overall, tremendous brew that as much as it sadens me say, lives up to the hype and billing. Great Imperial Stout from Cali!"
"Drinkability is amazing for an RIS, especially one at 19.5% abv. Normally I would penalize a beer so boozy as this one, but this is so quaffable and delicious, I could drink much more than I was allotted... Cheers."
"The beer is thick, viscous and ""chewy"" with adequate carbonation. The flavors compliment the high alcohol nicely, making this much more approachable than it should be. I couldn't enjoy an entire bottle, but for this high an abv, the beer is very drinkable. I wish there was another glass in my near future."
"Poured a dark as night black like motor oil with a very thin head and almost no lacing left on the glass. There was a lot going on in the aroma which consisted of chocolate malts, coco nibs, brown sugar, slight bourbon notes, vanilla and toffee. It had a sweet nose which probably included dark fruits as well. You can definitely smell the bourbon. The flavor was really complex with the chocolatey brownie striking first on the palate with bourbon, toffee, vanilla and caramelized sugar accents. After a couple sips I also got slight coco like the nose and booze for sure. Black Tuesday was full bodied with a low amount of carbonation that had a silky sweet and boozy finish. It was pretty drinkable considering the ABV on this beast. I actually enjoyed it more on tap before they released last year don't get me wrong it is still a great beer I just had to put in my two cents on it that's all. This is something everyone should try at least once."
"Drinkability: So much to say about this beer and so few characters in which to say it. First, there's no way in hell I'm going to give a beer: 1) this overwhelmingly sweet; and (more importantly) 2) this overwhelmingly high in alcohol anything above a 4.0, and as a self-respecting beeradvocate, I just can't do it. This is nonetheless a really enjoyable beer, and every sip I took made me wish more and more I had a piece of fudge or a slice of German chocolate cake to pair it with. This is the quintessential dessert beer, the sweetest beer I've ever had, and an absolutely over the top decadent treat that I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to have. Is it - to quote a memorable BA thread - only a matter of time before it becomes the #1 beer on BA? Clearly (as its fall from the top 5 indicates) not. It is, however, a great beer, one showing both a mastery of production as well as of craft, and one I was thrilled to have the opportunity to try. Worth seeking out ... though, honestly, not worth trading what a lot of people have probably traded it over."
"D: It's 19.5%, but manages to mask that in a complex shroud of sweet delicious desert flavors spiked with bourbon. I would have guessed it's abv to be much lower if I wasn't already aware. It is definitely something you will want to sip on and savor, but I could see myself drinking a whole bottle (which would be an epicly poor decision)."
"D: All hype. How could I think anything else? Waaay to boozy and waaaay too sweet. Its sad since there's a lot going on here and the feel is near perfect but why does it have to be 19.5% and why does it have to flaunt every single % in the taste and nose?!?! I'll give it another try down the line but as it is now, definitely not my cup of tea and DEFINITELY not worth the buzz and trouble."
"D- I am very pleasantly surprised by this one because its a 19.5% beer that drinks like an 11%. This was split amongst 5 people so I had a good 5 oz-but not a whole serving. A good beer overall-but inconceivable for it not to be shared-so I am hesitant to give the drinkability a 4. Surprisingly not boozy with the exception of the nose and VERY sweet. This brew is quite complex-but not really balanced."
"D-this is huge as expected but no where near the boozy mess I thought it was going to be. the alcohol is there, much more so in the nose. the balance of roasted malts and sweetness is done well and the bourbon notes are present; but a complete lack of any oak and a little hot in the back."
"Hype can be undoubtedly bad for a beer, just as it could be good. My opinion of this beer suffered greatly through my first sips, expecting a life-changing event after reading how great it was. Upon more thorough contemplation, and drinking much more Imperial stouts, I realized the intensity of flavor this beer offers. This is a must drink in my opinion."
"Okay, at 19.50%abv this is too easy to drink. Nothing this 'high-octane' should go down this easily. I'm sure that I'd regret drinking an entire bottle by myself, the next day or something, but I'd have a great time doing it, and don't think that it would be a problem to do so. It's so smooth and easy and delicious."
"D: Its sweet and high alcohol, so you cant drink a lot of this, but overall, I thought my 3rd of the bottle serving was perfect."
"D- Fairly easy to drink maybe just a little too sweet for me tastes but still solid. Split this one with a great group of guys at DLD."
"Overall-- I'm going to say that this is a great beer-- but as far as all the hype-- I think that the ABV is the real reason this has become a bit of a whale. They do a great job creating a flavor profile around the huge ABV, as opposed to trying to cover it up. It is worth trying, and I'd like to see all of the hoarders give up a few bottles here and there to guys willing to let others in on a tasting."
"D - Way way waaay to drinkable for 19.5%. Are you kidding me? Dangerous stuff."
"Overall: Its a beast of a beer. Drank side by side with Chocolate Rain, my preference goes to Chocolate rain over Black Tuesday, but you gotta have a great base beer to make Chocolate Rain."
"drinkability is great. excellent balance, especially impressive for a beer of this size. great balance with the barrel. tons of depth. a great beer."
"Overall I am glad i didnt spend 30$ on a bottle because this to me isn't as good as say The Abyss, and thats 12$."
"I did really enjoy this beer. Though it is hard to rate, and hard to categorize. Similar to Utopias in how extreme the beer is. Overall this is very good, and something that is great to share with friends. Very much worth a try, but it is still not among my favorites of the style."
"Mouthfeel is oily and thick, big body, low carbonation, some heat going down but drinks no where near 20%. Some hype? Of course, but in this case it deserves it, this is great stuff. Thanks Eric!!"
"An amazing sipping beer. Really really rich and inviting with flavours coming out as it warms. I think this is a winner. It does live up to all the hype. a ""Wow"" beer."
"A ton of effort and $ went into getting this beer and I thought it might be a touch of a letdown. It wasn't. It's a great beer, perhaps not my all time favorite but certainly in that top echelon."
"Well worth trying. Kinda hyped, but actually worth it. Definitely a sharer, but a unique experience as far as beer is concerned. Thanks again, Eric!"
"Pours opaque, dark with a full finger loose foamy tan head that fades fairly quickly with little lacing. The smell is aggressive, intense and complex. It starts off with a full on cherry vanilla assault over caramel and chocolate character. As it warms up the bourbon aroma becomes more intense, eventually maturing into an intense black licorice. Full flavored, the taste matches up to the nose really well, step for step. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied and creamy; a small sip coats the entire mouth thoroughly. The after taste lingers on and on with and the bourbon licorice and dark fruit notes. The 19.5% ABV is ever present but not distracting. Shared this one with my sons the day of the last snow, after-Easter christening the beginning of the 2010 BBQ season. This one is phenomenally complex. Very similar to my favorite Double Stouts but with a tad extra edge."
" Body is thick and rich, and just a touch sticky. Holds the flavors really well, the perfect vessel for the ridiculous complexity of this beer. Just phenomenal."
"Overall, an exceptionally well made brew and easily one of my favorites of all time."
"It's an Imperial Stout and 19.5%! It poured pitch black, hence the name, and smelled of: vanilla, dark chocolate, malt and bourbon. It tasted like molasses, brown sugar, chocolate malt, prunes, raisins, espresso, slight anise and an oaky bourbon finish, which actually wasn't that strong of an alcohol burn considering it's 19.5%! All in all, it was delicious."
"Overall, just flat out too sweet. Couldn't help but think I would contract diabetes after drinking this. There is a depth and complexity there, but for the most part it's masked. Glad I finally got to try it, but won't be seeking it out in the future."
"This is the third time I've had it, and it still is just as awesome as if I had waited 4 hours in line to get my bottle allotment."
"The two aspects that really make this beer shine are perfect mouthfeel and powerful flavor, which some will claim is cloying. Non beer drinkers who sampled this also really enjoyed it."
"Have had this on two occasions and just wasn't that impressed. Appearance was what you would expect for this type of beer. Felt it was better served at cellar temperature. Seemed to be drinkable at this temp. As it warmed the malty sweetness really made this hard to finish. Not overly heavy on the bourbon. Was definiely a sipper. First bottle was shared with about 8 people with each getting about 4-5 ozs. And all felt that was a large enough sample. Bottle two wa sshared with 4 other people . With half the bottle left unfinished."
"Taste is very sweet. Intense malt. Bourbon isn't as prominent in the flavor profile as expected. Oak is there but backlashed by the overall sweetness. Alcohol is amazingly well hidden behind this barrier of sugary liquid. Not much of a surprise."
" This beer is viscous, full bodied, but also smooth, with low carbonation. This is quite an experience. Quite drinkable, but at 19.5%, I would not want to drink a lot of this in one sitting."
"the only way to finish this beer, with just a half ounce left, and a black sheen all over it, is by a few ounces of swirling with pliny the elder. this is the life we were born to lead."
"Motor oil black pour with a loose brown head. The aroma is heavily charred oak and smoky bourbon with notes of vanilla bean, 100% cacao chocolate and boozy dark fruit. The begins with bitter dark espresso and blends to bourbon, smoke, and oak. It finishes with lingering dark chocolate, a dark fruit liquor, and a hint of amaretto. The FULL body is oily feeling with a moderate carbonation level and a big alcohol burn."
"Edit 2: again, forgot to mention that after we had finished our glasses, we were ready to drink anything. this beer wasnt overwhelming in any negative way. we moved on to other beers with no problem, and wouldnt have hesitated to drink more of this one if there was another open bottle in front of us. mmm!!"
"Did you notice I wrote ""This is the best feature of this beer"" too many times? Yeah, that's because this beer is awesome! Very appreciative for getting to try this."
"The mouthfeel is syrupy and viscous, and while I thought it would be too much, it is not where near cloying for me. This beer is huge in every way possible but is extremely drinkable considering the 19.5%. We all thought that it tasted much more like a 10% beer."
"D: I am torn. It is a singular effort but it is not that drinkable a beer. We split the 750 6 ways and people had a hard time finishing their glasses. Granted we were in a restaurant but this beer probably needs quite a few friends and many hours with no one driving afterwards. I would drink it again though."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a 1/4"" brown head that fades to lacing. The aroma is out of this world. It's warm and dark with excellent bourbon barrel character. The black and roasted malts are present and accounted for. The taste is perfect in my opinion. It's a strong black, earthy, roasted beer with a thick rich flavor that goes down warm and finishes the same with a nice bourbon character. The bourbon really compliments the overall experience. The mouthfeel is exceptional. It is a full bodied beer with near perfect carbonation. This is my new favorite beer in the world. It has everything I'm looking for in a drinking experience."
"Beer is sweet up front but has a good body to it, medium. I'm definitely not drinking rubbing alcohol but I'm also not chewing it. There is some bitterness in the back but again, the alcohol is completely masked. I'm knocking it down on drinkability because I honestly don't think I could drink a lot of it, its builds on me in both sweetness and bitterness but its a great beer. Think Bourbon County on steriods."
"Overall it's a good beer, pretty impressive, but nowhere near the ""god"" of all beers like people say. Wouldn't go out of my way to have it again, happy i got a chance to try it though."
"All things considered, this is not a very drinkable beer but under threat of violence from the bourbon I have been instructed to wrap up this review on a positive note. It actually is pretty damn good in small doses but drinking a bottle would put a man six feet under.Â "
"I was very interested in trying this beer, and I liked it more than I thought. I'd like to try next years release, which I think will be an improvement over the first attempt."
"VEry good beer...So glad i was able to try this one!"
"Thick, black pour with no head. Aroma is sweet and of bourbon. Flavor is very balanced for something this big, very sweet and malty but not as hot as I would have expected. Overall a great brew, but I'm not sure it was worth all the hype that surrounded it."
"I thought this beer would be all about the hype but i was wrong. It is a super-thick imperial stout that hides it abv extremely well. I would not want more than 2-3oz of this during one sitting. So damn filling."
"Killer stuff."
"Great beer, but IMHO, does not challenge either Dark Lord or Westy 12 for the first place in my cellar."
"This is a phenomenal beer. It is a little hard to drink primarily due to the intensity of flavors, as well as the ABV. It should be shared and could easily overpower just about any food."
"Well after finally getting to try this, I can definitely see how just how polarizing of a beer this can be. Everything about this (OK, except maybe the look) is just outrageous and I think that one's enjoyment of this will depend on their like of these types of flavors or big Stouts in general, as they are totally taken to the nth degree here. I personally loved every drop of it! I will say that a little bit of this goes a long way. I had about 4-5 oz from the bottle and that was plenty for me. This was definitely a bottle meant to be shared by friends."
"D - The drinkability is hard to compare to others of the style, very high quality and enjoyable to savor, yet not something you would want to pick up and drink all that often. For what it is it is highly drinkable. The flavors evolve very well and the abv while evident is still not close to what you might expect 19%+ to be when consuming this"
"A 750ml bottled shared by Deuane. Poured into my Selin's Grove wine glass. The stout appears a pitch black color akin to dark molasses. Repeated vigorous agitations only managed to produce a thin layer of dark ecru head. Nose and flavors consist of milk and bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, mellow bourbon notes, dark brown sugar/molasses, smoke and a bit of char, deeply caramelized malts, dark cherries, raisins, more chocolate and smoky bourbon. Smells a tad better than it tastes. Some, but certainly no where near enough alcohol heat to lead you to believe this beer is pushing 20%. Full bodied and rich, but rather sweet. The perfect bottle to split between 6 or more people. Thanks again D!"
"J"
"Vintage 2011. Although I have changed my mind about this beer, I still don't believe it is a world class brew. The body is too light for the ABV, and it is very sweet and very boozy. It MUST be served at room temp! The flavors and nuances of the beer come out much better at 55-65 degrees. All in all, this is a huge beer, and one that I am glad I revisited."
"Overall- similiar to Bourbon County Stout but not as good. I would prefer an Abyss or BCS over this, but it is very good. The alcohol is strong so a 6 oz pour is enough."
"It is a great beer and worthy of the acclaim. Other than the over the top boozy profile, it is REALLY good. Thanks to the above mentioned again for the hook-up."
"Almost 20% abv? Amazing - ususally something that big turns out to be a fiery mess, but here we have a surprisingly smooth big beer. Dense and a bit sweet, with caramel and brown sugar notes, overlapping intense roasted malts. This would be the ideal fireside sipper."
"O: Alcohol is strong but good, thick viscous and syrupy, Similar to the bourbon county stout (which i think is a bit better), a 6 oz pour was perfect, much more and it would have been difficult to finish, sweetness is balanced an unobtrusive, overall a great beer"
"Drinkability isn't exactly huge for any beer of this style, but this one especially hides its high (crazy high) ABV well. The alcohol feel and taste is definitely present, but it is so well-balanced by the full flavors and full feel of the beer that it goes down much too easily."
"Wiseman Justin: A+ (4.90)"
"It pours out a thin motor oil, it doesn't have the thickness you see in Dark Lord. A thin brown head tops off the top but fades away quickly. No lacing but it does leave a slight brown film on the glass. The bourbon aroma smacks you hard in the face even from a distance. There is also a dark fruit coming out with the chocolate. Almost no roast aroma. At first sip this beer tastes just like it smells. So well balanced. Bourbon, chocolate and a slight apple tart. Once your mouth is coated with that alcohol you can really get into this beer and see that it's just amazing. The year in the barrel has made this incredibly smooth. Which makes it one of the most drinkable Imperial Stouts I've had. The 19.5% ABV if correct, is hidden very well. One thing that I'm missing in this is the coffee or the roasted malts."
"D: A bit too boozy and sweet to easily drink a ton. Still a great beer. Damn did it hit me hard after a full glass. I would drink this 6oz at a time."
"There's no chance this is 19%, but there's also no way I could polish off the whole bottle by myself either. It's a very unique, dessert-forward RIS that should do some interesting things the longer it sits in the bottle. Good stuff!"
"This was never a chore but it was quite intense."
"3.5/4.5/4/4.5/3.5"
"Bottled at The Bruery this last weekend, thanks to a certain photo shoot that went down on friday. Meant to get some more during the initiation party the next day, but I was having too good of a time drinking Two Dirty Hookers in the main room to make it over to the special pour room. Oh, well, the several ounces on friday was more than enough of this beast. Very thick black with a small head and leaves lots of syrupy coating on the cup. Massively intense aroma of chocolate and a shit ton of bourbon without the alcohol sharpness. A touch of oak, but mainly sweet bourbon and chocolate. Hugely thick and rich flavor. Very sweet and chocolate-bourbon flavored on the front on the tongue, but with a toasty and bitter roasty finish that manages a surprising balance. In the initial sip you don't really detect much alcohol, but it really comes out in the finish once it eats through the residual sugar on your tongue. Insanely thick and mouth coating in an almost gross way to be honest. An exceptional beer to be sure, but I can't really decide if I would ever be interested in it beyond a two-ounce sample every now and again. Total props to The Bruery for making a beer this tasty and envelope-pushing, but it really fills a tiny niche in the beer world."
"All in all I need to acquire more of this beer, like copius amounts of it, because this is just the best beer I have ever had. Thanks Patrick and The Bruery gang."
"Drinkability: A phenomenal, fierce brew! It's about as easily drinkable as something of this magnitude or degree of sweetness can be. Take it slow, bring some friends, and enjoy yourself."
"Wouldn't drink a Ton because It is very rich tasting but one of the best beer I have ever had. Glad to try this."
"Well, what to say about this one, probably the most hyped beer of 2009? In short, it's a really good beer and it is impressive how balanced it comes out despite the intensity and range of the flavors it showcases. Don't think it's in a league of its own though, there are some fine imperial stouts out there that surly could match it."
"No way could anyone really enjoy a full bottle of this alone, so how about crowing Black Tuesday the best beer of all time in a new ""dinner party dessert beer"" category?"
"I got a pretty small pour of this one as it was split many ways at the tasting, huge thanks to the man who brought it. In all honesty, I don't know if I'd even want more than a couple ounces. The aroma is all sorts of heady, with tons of bourbon, chocolate, and sugar going on. The taste is similar with lots and lots of sweetness. Some underlying chocolate and vanilla from the bourbon. I've said it before, but never has it applied more - this one's a sipper. The first thing that came to mind for me was the similarity to bourbon county stout just from the full-on rush of sensation. The tastes are similar (although this one's a little more sweetness and chocolate and a little less outright bourbon) and since I'm a huge fan of BCS that can only be a good thing. Glad I got a chance to try this very special beer."
"O - wow, even better than the first time I had this beer. So good. Something everybody should try."
"O - The reason for the perfect review is because of the vibrancy of each flavor and its how each note does not over power the next. This is one of the best beers I've ever had."
"D - Very tasty and pretty extreme. A good bottle to share with 5 others!"
"Notes: After standing in line for 4 1/2 hours in a dark, cold, wind-swept alley to obtain this beer, I became increasingly skeptical if the beer could ever live to all the hype. As hard as I tried to find a chink in the Black Tuesday armor, the only thing I could come up with was the lack of head after the initial pour. Smells incredible, tastes phenomenal, and makes Goose Island Bourbon County Stout feel like a porter! As for its drinkability, the 19.5% is hidden so damn well that drinking an entire bottle is not nearly as cumbersome as it might sound in theory. No doubt it's a sipper to be reckoned with, but it went down much more easily than I thought it would. Two thumbs way up!"
"Believe the Hype!"
"Overall a good brew, but not a stand-out for the style. Certainly the ""biggest"" but that does not mean ""best"" as well, at least in my book. A good exercise in over-loading each part of the brewing process with malt and then tossing it in a barrel, but nothing I would need to try again - similar to seeing the bearded lady, etc. I've had the 09 and 2010, the 10 was much hotter and the alcohol made it feel thin."
"D: With this much flavor and alcohol, this beer should not be this enjoyable. The bottle was split three-ways and it was divine. A truly amazing accomplishment from the Bruery. The hype was more than met here which is a really nice bonus."
"Overall, this beer is very good and definitely lives up to all the hype. The 2009 is drinking great right now, aging does wonders."
"Overall, this is an exceptional barrel aged stout and one of my favorites now."
"Shared this 3 ways so i had a very generous pour courtesy of myself as usual.First impression was thinking this tasted like a 08 Darkness on steroids.Then it seemed more like a 02 DFH World Wide Stout..This one packed a punch in a warming way. Made my ears warm. Heavy syrupy flavors of molasses and grain sugars abound throughout. So many flavors coming through it's hard to pick out at times exactly whats going on. Very good and highly drinkable and hides the 19% alc. very well but does have the warmth you would expect from such a high content. This is more like a liqueur than a beer. Would be interesting to let this one sit for a few years and try it again..I think I will with the other bottles I have! Seek one out and enjoy if your lucky enough to land one."
"Overall I am really left rather speechless by this. I had my hopes dampened coming into this one as people have said it was not worthy of the hype, but I beg to differ, it was worth every bit of it. This is quite simply the biggest, baddest, strongest RIS I have ever come across and it deserves its title. Still in awe of this one."
"Overall, this beer is good, but I can see it getting a lot better with age on it. People claim that the abv doesn't show at all, well I am going to have to call that a lie. There is definitely a fair amount of heat showing in this beer. I will be reevaluating this beer once I get to try it again with some age on it."
"Overall, this is a very impressive beer and as much as I want to hate it, I just can't. I am glad to have had the chance to try it, and would recommend that bottles be shared at cooler temps (closer to 40ËšF) between at LEAST 6 People."
"D: I, as did others, sat on this one for quite some time. I couldnt even think about having one all to myself, or even half a bottle at that. It did live up to the hype and I am very happy to have had the opportunity to try it"
"This beer basically lived up to the awesome hype. I was a little worried that it wouldn't, and we all wanted it to bomb out so we could downgrade the score. Instead it did the opposite and made is happy but sad at the same time. I would love to see how this does with a few more years under it's belt. I hope they continue to make batches of this and make higher quantities. The only difficult part of it was the sweetness that was a little overbearing at times, and it was hard to finish, even slowly, but that just pushes the sipping aspect of it, which is very thankful as it masks the 19.5% so well you could just put it back much easier otherwise."
"D- Moderate. A little goes a LONG way. I enjoyed my first glass, and my second glass sat for about 3 hours before I mustered up the strength to finish it."
"poured jet black with a small dark tan head that disappated quickly leaving a slight lacing on the glass. Smell is sweet w/ hints of molasses, vanilla, bourban, oak and alcohol. The taste is much of the same. This is a big sweet stout, which is to be expected with such a high ABV. Shockingly enough the booze was fairly well hidden, but the sweetness was a bit much for me and cancelled out some of the subtle flavors that could make this beer great. I think with a few years of aging this could be a spectacular heavy and complex stout. I am certainly glad to have tried this ale...I've always felt as though this was an over hyped beer, but after trying it I can honestly say that it is a supreme effort at a high alcohol stout and reminds me a big of DogFish Head's World Wide Stout which is one of the finest ales to age IMHO. Good Job to the Bruery and I hope to try this one again in a few years when some of the sweetness dies out. Thanks again Derek!"
"D - My 5oz (approximate) was way more then enough for me. I was done with this one after my initial taste and I don't think I could have gone back for seconds (or enjoyed it). I've had many other stouts that I consider to be superior to this brew. Although it's good, I don't consider it to be great."
"i was impressed, it lived up to the hype. the ABV was well hidden although in the back of my head I knew it was there. it was a tad too sweet though, that as the only flaw i found. i would drink this again but with other people. 19.5 will wreck you."
"Did this live up to the hype for me? No, not really. I'm glad I got to try it and if I came across the opportunity to trade or buy a bottle for a reasonable price I would, because I'd like to age this and see if a year or two can mellow this out. If the booziness can tone down a little, this beer would be out of this world."
"D: All that being said for 19% it is damn drinkable. Great Great beer, was not epic though."
"Drinkability: It's essentially 40 proof. It's not easy to drink more than a few glasses of this, that's for sure. In that way, drinkability is low. In the way of masking the ABV, seemingly clocking in around GI BCS' 13%, it's eminently so. Catches up to you quickly, too. Altogether, no doubt one of the best beers I've ever had, and I don't even really love bourbon barrel beer. It's not the hype that's made this beer world-famous, but the smoothness, complexity, and fantastic flavors of a beer that clocks in at almost 20% ABV."
"A couple of thoughts about this beer. This is an extremely impressive beer, one that was an absolute treat to sample. That being said, it really doesn't have any place in my life. Like the DFH WWS and 120 IPA, this is the sort of beer you can drink once in a blue moon, with no need for repeated applications. Not sure when, if ever, I'll want to try this beer again."
"All in all, there's some complexity here to make it one of the higher-rated beers but don't be fooled by the hype, which sadly may be its downfall. If you get a chance to try this beer, I suggest you ignore the hype and approach it without expectations for what it is."
"Now I've had this more than several times, I'm inclined to bump up the scoring. When this first came out, there was this massive aura of HYPE WHALZ around this and it negatively impacted how I , along with several other people viewed tis beer. As it has progressed through the years and lessened that hypeness, it has grown to hold its own among other great BA imperial stouts and I can safety say it's a beer I'd seek out."
"It's quite good and extremely drinkable but is it the best? No, IMHO, but it is definitely one of the better stouts out there."
"Overall I have to say that it lived up to the hype. I think the best thing about this beer is how well integrated all of the flavors are while managing to not taste overly hot. Not the best beer I've ever had but it certainly has to be part of the conversation."
"I have had the pleasure of having this beer both on tap as well as out of the bottle. It is amazing both ways. The most recent time was a couple nights ago we opened a bottle for a friends birthday. The beer was a beautiful dark chocolate color with a nice head to it. All of the aromas from chocolate to bourbon were present as you take your sip from the glass. Even though the ABV is about 19, it goes down smooth and without a bite. Personally I am not a stout drinker, but this is the best beer I have had. It is fantastic!"
"And I understand the this has to be rated to style, but part of what makes an Imperial Stout so great is when it is drinkable. 2/3rds of us couldn't finish our glass. It was to sweet, to sticky, and to boozy. It was a really different experience... going from what started as an amazing experience to 20 minutes later being on the complete other end of the spectrum. Good beer for sure, by no means my favorite from the Bruery or from the style. Glad I was able to try it"
"I have to say drink ability is not great, but its not horrible. All the sweetness and booze that appears as this warms really kills the drink ability. I find it really hard to believe a lot of these ratings that are giving drink ability such a high score, these people mush be missing a palate and taste buds...Patrick is a great brewer and i applaud the effort, but its a little much..."
"If this astronomically high ABV is correct I can't believe how drinkable this brew is. Clearly meant to be sipped and enjoyed like a distilled beverage, I have never wanted to drink so much of such a potentially dangerous beverage. Hats of to the Bruery. I count myself extremely lucky to try this rare treat."
"-despite all the hype, miles driven, money spent, long wait...would have to say this is the best beer i have ever had"
"At the end of the day, it is a very enjoyable beer, but it leaves a somewhat tinny, bitter metallic aftertaste that lingers long after the sweet luscious flavors that make this such a great beer. I would imagine this will be great after two or three years in the bottle, but I am not sure it is actually quite ready for drinking yet."
"Easy to go down, but rather hard for me to finish the whole bottle in a timely manner. I opened it on the wee hour of Thanksgiving and continued to sip away the next morning."
"D - it is a little strong but it goes down so smooth that its amazing that its 19.5%. plenty other IRS have a much stronger alcoholic flavor"
"Poured into a Bruery tulip, pours a wonderful jet black with a ring of brown foam around the outside, upon swirling a bit of foam builds up and quickly dies down. I stick my nose down into the glass with bright notes of vanilla and oak are the first things I smell, next comes this awesome roastiness and smells of chocolate, expresso, molasses and dark sweet fruits like raisins. It smells so good! I could smell this beer for days! The dark chocolate smell in this beer is predominate, and in the finish a little bit of an alcohol bite. I dive in for my first taste and wow, just wow! This beer is so good! It was served a little cold but, as it warmed up, it got better and better. The taste is similar to the smell, oak, vanilla, dark chocolate, expresso roastiness, molasses and dark fruits. This beer is over the top! just big in every-way! It is complex and the flavors are just layered over each other. It is a bit on the sweeter side but it is not cloying. It finishes super smooth and is just amazing. The beer is lightly carbonated and very full bodied, this beer has some real substance to it. It is hard to give this beer a 5 on drinkability, even though I would kill to be able to drink this beer all the time, it is 19.5% and it is just so over the top and bold. Overall, this beer is just amazing and I am addicted, I went every chance I got to try this beer. I can't wait to crack open one of my bottles!"
"Overall this is a very nice imperial stout and I look forward to trying it again. I could see myself drinking this one in place of a nice port after a meal or when I have a craving for sweets."
"Huge thanks to Thirstybird for sharing and stevemcqueenjr for carrying it cross-country. Pours an inky black with no light penetration. A quarter inch mocha-colored head quickly dissipates into a swirl of foam and a tight band that coalesced around the perimeter of the glass. Incredible nose - sweet, vanilla, bourbon, malty, brown sugar and a little booze. Taste follows nose - this is an incredibly sweet and decadent beer I have to say. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied; not overly carbonated, but just a tad too much, such that it cuts the viscosity. This is definitely a beer to sip and savor; however, the abv is well-hidden, all things considering. A truly incredible experience - believe the hype."
"Definitely will drink this beer again and look forward to taking one of my remaining bottles back to the East Coast to share with a couple of friends and family."
"This thing would be wonderful if you still loved to eat chocolate cake until your gut could no longer take it anymore. It's little but a chocolate fudge liqueur. Nothing RIS about this one. No roastiness, no balance, just tons and tons of chocolate syrup. Alcoholic, liquid chocolate cake."
"Help. Me."
"Mouthfeel is heavy bodied and oily with a small bite of carbonation. As expected, the mouthfeel is perfectly smooth and heavy, but not quite flat."
"Notes - I treated this beer as any other beer to review. Honestly, I don't give a crap about how hyped up a beer is. A beer is a beer and if your tastebuds enjoy it, then great. If not, at least you gained experience. Personally, I thought this was an excellent beer, although I would have preferred slightly less bourbon in the nose. That was really the only thing that I could complain about. In terms of taste, I can definitely appreciate the subtleties of a year's worth of bourbon barrel aging. It is very much like a vintage Goose Island Bourbon County Stout. In fact, I think I enjoy the balance in GIBCS a touch more than BT. However, its velvety smoothness and lack of alcoholic hotness is what gave it its exceptional texture. Overall, I felt that this was an awesome experience. Thanks again, Richard."
"Thanks again, Topher!"
"D - Finished my glass incredibly quickly. Way, way too easy to drink. This was at the end of a large tasting, and the BT sent me over the edge. Still have a headache from it as I write this."
"Big, big body. Sticky texture. Obviously, not a very easy drinker. Definitely glad to try it, but it's not worth $30 to me, and it's certainly not worth trading away way more than it's worth."
"This is a very average beer, nothing special."
"Bottle pours pitch black with tan head. Aroma is amazing. I detect subtle notes of bourbon, slight oxidation, dark roast, coffee, chocoate, and dark grain. This has a really pronounced dark grain aroma that just dominates. If you have ever brewed with dark grains that is what it smells like. Those black grains just stand out the most for me in the nose. Dense and viscous mouthfeel. Flavor has a touch of alcohol, bourbon, coffee, grains, and finishes somewhat chocolate sweet with a slight grain astringency. The sweet chocolate and grain astringency finish knock this beer down a bit for me. I don't care for the sweetness or astringency. And that is what I'm left with as it finishes. It has all the layers of complexity that make it a remarkable if not one of the best beers on the planet. I just wish it finished better. Still a nice beer to try either way."
"I couldn't imagine drinking an entire bottle of this to myself and splitting it 3 ways I was close to buzzing! A sharing bottle indeed. Drinkability is just above what I would consider average."
"D: 25.4 oz = 24 hours. Definitely something to share. I have to say this is a very unique and interesting beer. I don't feel it is worth all the hype, some maybe but not all of it. Very good don't get me wrong but you Cali guys can just keep holding on to those bottles for yourselves."
"D-Well I wish I had twice as much. Yes, it is a huge beer with lots of abv but it is by no means overly hot. As it warms a bit more of the heat comes out so Im thinking with some time this will be a perfect 5 in my book. Amazing beer from an amazing brewery, keep up the good work."
"Wow, stunning packaging from choice of inks, paper and wax on this bottle. Admirable attention to detail in every respect. A gentle pour into the glass renders a one inch dark khaki head that soon recedes to the liquid surface. Rich, viscuous retention on the glass suggests some serious liquid extract. The body is black and dense as any world-class Imperial Stout. The aromatics are fantastic! One of the most lush dessert scents like Vahlrona lava cake and pure vanilla extract. No trace of booziness anywhere. My senses are fully engaged in anticipation at this point. Anchors aweigh, my boys! The attack is phenomenal. All sorts of extravagant analogies such as young vintage port, chocolate cream liquer, and black barleywine coming to mind. Neither the bourbon nor barrel component is overdone. The sweetness however is a slight challenge for me...moreso than I expected, but at these extremes is very well-managed. The finish becomes slightly one-dimensional due to the sweetness, but does reveal traces of alcohol. Ultimately delicious in every way, I truly believe that another year in the barrel would have made this even more integrated. It certainly deserves its place in the pantheon of all-time greatest stouts. While in the bar of my dreams, this would certainly be on tap, but I can't say that it is my all-time favorite. I will be checking in regularly to see how it ages though. So does it set a new benchmark for it's category? Absolutely. I, however, believe that The Bruery has the potential to produce even better beers than this one. It just reminds me how grateful I am to be alive during this unprecedented golden age of craft beer."
"D: The epitome of a sipper. As I noted above, I wouldn't want to drink a lot of this in one sitting, but a good 8-12 oz serving would probably last you well over an hour if treated right. The flavors and aroma are so complex and amazing - I wish I had a few bottles of this to sip on during the cold winter months. I was ready for a let down after all the hype, but after trying this I think most of the hype is definitely deserved. I'm not sure it deserves to be on the ridiculously high pedestal most traders put it on, but it is most certainly one of the best beers I've ever had the pleasure of tasting."
"All aboard. This is one of the best Imperial Stouts around and you'll just have to deal with it. Black Tuesday is a paragon."
"Black Tuesday actually reminded me of some of those big foreign stouts including some Mikeller stuff, Dark Horizon and the like, only with the American twist of doing it even bigger."
"Cracked open a bottle of this last night with some friends. Pours viscous black with mocha head. Smells amazing - we all kept sniffing this over and over before even taking a sip. Sweet bourbon, brown sugar, and vanilla are all quite prominent. Tastes quite bourbony and sweet, with more brown sugar and vanilla. Maybe a hint of butterscotch in there too. After sampling this at GABF, I wasn't sure if I'd find it to be too sweet for my taste. Thankfully that was not the case. This tastes to me like Goose Island BCS squared. Body is very thick, and well supported by ample carbonation. Overall, an extremely delicious brew. My biggest complaint is that this is sold in 750 ml bottles. Absurd, given the high ABV. If I want to share with friends, I can just open a second smaller bottle. No need for the large format."
"One of a handful of beers I could legitimately call the best I've ever had. I will treasure this ""twenty malt"" version."
"Plenty of hotness and alcohol coming through in the flavor. This is a good beer, but I doubt it's worth what people are giving up. I would take Vanilla Bean Dark Lord over this beer easily."
"EDIT: Just split a bottle with my Kels and the bourbon is much more pronounced in this bottle. Still not massive on the bourbon but definitely a step up and a nice improvement. Gonna bump the aroma up to a 5. Fantastic."
"One of the best beers I've ever had. I'll be interested to see what a few years of age will do, if anything."
"D: I think I could finish about 1/2 of a bottle but that would be about it. Not just cuz of the 19.5 ABV. But the sugars seem to get a little too sweet. Almost like a Liqueur. A very very tasty liqueur. Maybe not quite worth $30 a pop but still quite nice."
"Overall: The only major difference between the tap and bottle version...at least in my opinion...is the nose. At warmer temps, the alcohol is easily detectable...and at times, felt like I was getting buzzed even before I took a sip. Yet, I was able to extract more flavors and nuances than with the tap version. With that said, BT is among the top Impy stouts in the world. A must try. Cheers!"
"D: Huge alcohol, malts and maple. Couldn't drink too much of this. It appears to me that the brewer threw everything in the book at this beer and left nothing left to chance. Huge alcohol, huge bourbon, huge malts. There is nothing subtle about this whatsoever. Doing so, I think it lost some appeal with me. I think its smoother than other big dogs out there, but I am not getting on the hype train with this one."
"Wow, lots going on, recommended."
"Drinkability improves after you get a few ounces in you. The booziness subsides, and the amazing flavors underneath come to the forefront. I think 8 oz. is probably the perfect serving size for this, so split your bottle 3 ways for best results. I really wish this came in 12 oz. bottles or smaller, because I would like to be able to drink it more often. An absolutely stunning beer."
"3.5/3.5/3.5"
"Overall - This is the new standard. Hope you got some bottles of it."
"Drinkability isn't especially high, it did take me a couple hours to finish 1/3 of a bottle, but with that said it never became cloying or harsh - it's just such a filling and intense beer that I can't see myself wanting to drink it often or in large quantities."
"Hype aside, this is overall one of the more interesting beers I've tried recently. It's definitely an extreme beer though, so probably not for everyone. It's quite an accomplishment in itself making a beer this strong that isn't a sticky cloying mess, let alone making one that's highly drinkable and delicious but Patrick and the crew nailed it."
"Overall: This is probably my favorite beer of all-time. It's certainly among the most complex and well-constructed beers I've ever had. Hot damn, I'm glad that I've got more of this. Don't listen to the cynics that tell you that this beer is ""overly hyped"" or that its scores are artificially inflated. This beer is the real deal. It would be tough to claim that there's any better imperial stout out there."
"Is this the best beer in the world? One could certainly argue for or against and have valid points on both sides. What is indisputable to me is that Black Tuesday is a tremendous brewing achievement that shows great finesse in a huge package. All I know is that I spent nearly two hours drinking this beer and when I swirled the last sip in my mouth and swallowed I was deeply satiated."
"Overall, this is a really incredible achievement in the style. Managing to get the ABV this high, and having it not taste like rocket fuel and fire, LET ALONE having it taste damn good in the process, is just amazing."
"A jet black beer with a slightly brown twinge at the edge of the glass. Chocolate brown head that dissipated quickly. Lacing drips vertically down the glass rather than horizontally. Reeks of bourbon, charred oak, molasses, possibly chocolate cake, and dried dark fruits. Tastes like a vanilla bourbon truffle with a sprinkle of espresso. Coffee flavor comes out in the finish in what is otherwise dominated by bourbon, molasses and vanilla. The taste of Tuesday lingers for over a minute after each sip is gone. Taste buds are saturated and nearly overwhelmed by the depth of flavor. Mouthfeel is thick and rich, but lightened by adequate carbonation. Considering the 19.5% abv, the drinkability is silly. An amazing beer that is the best of its style."
"MF&D - the carbonation is a bit low on this guy, but I find it enough for something with so much flavour and booze. the lack of carbonation is justified when one realizes the body isn't like a motor oil, it is thiner, and thus to get that syrupy feel some absence of carbonation is required. drinkablility? oh man, for a beer with 19.5% abv this brew is like drinking silk. the booze never chokes me up, never makes me gag, it goes down with its lovely burning and thats the end of that. it is a masterful piece of brewing and I wish that I could have regular access to such a prize of a beer."
"worth the wait and glad i got to try this batch fresh"
"D - Unbelievably drinkable...19.5%, really? Drinks like a much lower alcohol beer. This is unbelievably good stuff. Thinking about cracking a second bottle, but don't think the trading partners who already have this reserved would appreciate that."
"Overall I am glad i didnt spend 30$ on a bottle because this to me isn't as good as say The Abyss, and thats 12$."
"If I didn't start to feel it after a few pours, I would not believe the 19.5% ABV. Impressive."
"Overall: This is one hell of a beer. i felt that this beer could never live up to its hype, but i was wrong."
"If you hadnt told me the abv i wouldnt have been able to tell you what it was. remarkable. I have to admit I was skeptical going into it but I would gladly say that this beer is worthy of its hype and I really hope more people get to try it."
"Serving type: on-tap at the Bruery release"
"There was some discussion at the release regarding aging Black Tuesday, but I'm not sure what it could gain. If the bottles are force carbonated and not bottle conditioned, then they should be ready to drink and I can't imagine this beer getting any smoother."
"The pour is black. It was poured straight from the source. I wrapped my nose inside the tulip glass and it smelled like bourbon,molasses, and burnt caramel. So many different flavors that smack you as soon as the beer hits your palate. It is well balanced, and does not feel like a 19.5 alcohol beer. It has an aftertaste that reminds you of a chocolaty licorice(good licorice taste) taste. It is a thick mouthful, causing one to fill a full bodied beer full of sweetness and dark malts. I did not taste any bitterness in the beer, and it still tasted great. If you do not like imperial stouts, then you will probably still love this beer. It is very drinkable, and after one sip the palate craves another drink."
"D- I had no idea a beer of this ABV could be so drinkable but in a tasting i would put this up against a port wine. Gave it a 4.5 because its almost like molasses in the finish."
"D: Well, this could do well to sit in a cellar for about 5 years. But, it's still so wonderful now that I would not turn a serving down. This is one beer that truly has lived up to its hype (for me, anyway) and I look forward to sharing my bottles and my friends bottles whenever we feel so moved. An absolutely world class beverage!"
"So beautifully executed. Patrick is a pioneer and a true alchemist - blending art and science into something that really speaks volumes of American ingenuity."
"Just a couple small samples from the Bruery crew themselves at downtown johnny browns 22nd annv. Huge brew, alc and bourbon are not that noticable esp considering the alc level is 18-19%. Great part is if you ever open one of these you will need several people to share 1 bottle with. Dark rich thick sticky bourbon. like sweetened condensed milk but with stout and bourbon. not that sweet i guess. super complex and it opened up and grew bigger with just a couple minutes in a glass. not sure how / if this will age. hoping a long long time but it's a freak and can't wait to re-rate from my own bottle and the black rain!"
"There was a huge line for this one, worth the wait. Their other beers are also wonderful."
"I have not had darkness, dark lord, or DFH WWS, so cannot compare, but have 2 out of 3 in the cellar so will note on comparisons when I pop them."
"no shock to anyone, this pours black, with lots of bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar and other flavors. It's complex, tasty, and basically great. The smooth chocolatey flavors of the stout are complemented wonderfully by the vanilla/oaky bourbon barrel notes. This is an extremely well crafted beer."
"I am more of a RB guy than a BA guy, but I feel this beer must be appropriately explored on both sites. I have been blessed enough to have this beverage at least 15 to 20 times by now. Simply a glorious beer! Originally on tap at the brewery (Bruery?) Pours with a large brown head over a black body. Alcohol legs, brown coating and lace all left behind on the glass. Aroma of tar, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, dark fruits, and caramel. Taste is dark fruits, tar, bourbon, oak, candi sugar, plums, tobacco and bitter chocolate. Extremely long duration. Super viscous mouthfeel, light carbonation, amazing! Hides alcohol immensely well, does not taste or go down like 19.5% (not even close)! Really looking forward to the bottles. Fantastic beer. I never thought I could find a single beer from them better than Melange #3, but it turns out that a comment of that beer was better than the sum that made Melange Numero Three!"
"Rob"
"D: Exceedingly drinkable. A four-ounce pour is not nearly enough. It's too bad the pre-orders were all filled up, but I'm incredibly happy that I ended up in Orange County at just the right time!"
"On tap at the brewery- sad to see allocations are done. Smell is huge bourbon, oak, and sweet cocoa. Ripe, dark fruit. It's black, slightly viscus with a nice lace. Taste is amazingly smooth. It's silky on the tongue, not thick at all but very smooth. I could drink A LOT of this. Taste is ripe raisin, some prune and other ripe fruits followed by a sweet cocoa and then a slight bitterness. I don't pick up much alcohol in the finish at all- quite amazing... Lives up to the hype"
"D - ABV is EXTREMELY well hidden. And not to sweet like most high ABV beers. Although this is IS a little bit sweet for a stout, it's very balanced. A little hot, but not what you'd think, it's scary drinkable. I would compare this to GI BCS, but a ton more complex, higher ABV, and more drinkable."
"and it looks like I got a little lengthy anyway... sorry."
"But it's a hell of a beer. (Edit: It was obviously on-tap. I have corrected that.)"
"(Update: After opening the bottle version of BT, I hereby renew my enthusiasm for Black Tuesday. It's by far my favorite imperial stout. I actually think the bottle version was a little better than the tap.)"
"Have had a few four ounce glasses at the Bruery in the past few weekends, served in their tulip glass, color is pitch black with not a glimmer of light anywhere, thick sludgy looking stuff, big 1 1/4 inch tan to medium brown foamy and creamy head, good lacing at first, head did not budge for close to five minutes, aroma consists of molasses, oak, rich dark chocolate, some mild coffee, roasted malts, mild port, tobacco, vanilla, sweet cocoa, prunes, burned caramel, and bourbon, flavor starts off with a big oak, taste, some sweet chocolate and vanilla in the middle, finish has a nice syrup taste mixed with tons of oak, bourbon comes through later on more pronounced but nothing major being a hair under twenty percent, easily the top three best tasting beers I have had of this alcohol content, some brown sugar and complex malt flavors come out as it continues to warm, almost like a marshmallow flavor by the end, very creamy with minimal booze in the flavor somehow, dry, roasted, bittersweet, oaky, and chewy mouthfeel, full bodied, very soft carbonation, taste lingers incredibly well, best mouthfeel for a stout that I have come across, drank this with no problem at all, cannjot explain how the alcohol is hidden well but it drinks like a beer maybe have of its ABV, not heavy at all, could down a 750 ml bottle and probably will at a later date, amazing drinkability, one of their best brews yet and that is sure saying a lot, the story about this beer is almost impressive as the beverage itself, this thing is going to age wonderfully too, good thing I was able to get a bunch of bottles to experiment with that, will be drinking again sooner than later, highly recommended"
"I can say that the Bruery hadn't impressed me until my trip there in which I got to try Black Tuesday, White Oak and Papier. I am a believer."
"This is one big beer. Insanely complex and tasty. Obviously, this one's a sipper."
"We may have a new standard for big stouts;....or, we simply may have a whole new catagory..."
"I was worried this would be like World Wide Stout or Mikkeller Black and be extremely alcoholic with limited enjoyability. Fortunately, that is not the case. Black Tuesday black out the booze and stimulates the taste buds. Indeed, this is marvelous black water. Oh, and don't fret too much if you miss out on a bottle initially, because this beer will be brewed again in the future."
"I caught a bunch of cocunut on the intial taste that mellowed out to the beautiful nut and cocoa flavors."
"D: Aside from Partridge in a Spice Tree this is my favourite beer ever from The Bruery, and it will actually be available for more than a weekend. I can't really find a fault with this beer. So easy to drink for its style, it should be illegal. It's hard to say $25 or $1/oz. for a bottle of beer is even a good deal, but for this one it's a steal."
