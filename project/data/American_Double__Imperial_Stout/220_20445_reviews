"Outstanding."

"This is a dynamic stout!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"too much of a coffee taste for me but heck its a cappuccino stout. got a growler for The Growler house in Cincinnati."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The ABV is reflected in the strong stout flavor.  I appreciate the subtle difference they were trying to impart with the cappuccino vs. it being a coffee stout, but still wish they had  packed more punch with the accent.  Still a good buy, wouldn't shy away from it for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours black with a mocha head that quickly dissolves. No lacing. Aroma of roasted coffee, dark chocolate, burnt dark fruits. Taste is as advertised. Don't know why, but compared with some other coffee stouts, I thought this one might hit me a little more. It's good, but not something I'd purposely seek out again."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very enjoyable beer, and the best part about it is the value!  I purchased mine for $3.95 for a bomber, which is flat out one of the cheapest out there.  Coming in at 8.9% with great coffee flavors, and hints of chocolate is very nice.  I will pick this up any time I see it!"
""
""
"On point,  the coffee flows through with a full body feel."
""
""
""
""
"I definitely enjoyed this one and $5 for a bomber in PA is an amazing price. The rest of you lucky SOBs probably pay 3 or 4. I'm just finishing up my case of Founder's Breakfast  Stout and I recently tried Victory at sea for the first time. This is good, but it doesn't measure up to those guys."
""
""
""
"Pours very very dark brown with a finger or so of head that dissipates moderately slowly. Strong smell of cocoa and coffee. Strong coffee and darker chocolate taste, heavier on the coffee. Smooth, almost no bitterness. Malted barley aftertaste with nice hint of coffee. Overall, a very fine stout, may be in elite status. I really though highly of this brew."
""
"I was really surprised to see how strong this is. While drinking, thought this couldn't be any more than 6%. For that alone this beer gets big ups. Overall this beer is quite smooth with a muted coffee flavor with a nice strong roasted barley malt quality."
""
"Smells of chocolate and Colombian coffee grounds. Strong coffee taste but it's different, I like it. Very evident dark chocolate taste which is rich and satisfying. Carbonated nicely. A very well done stout from Lagunitas- I would buy again."
""
"Poured into a shaker pint glass. Dark reddish-brown color, nice thick head and good lacing. Aroma is lots of coffee, and some dark roasty malts, and a slight peppery smell. Taste is nearly identical to the smell, with lots of coffee up front, and a very slight pepper tone on the back end. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy - very nice.  Overall, this is typical of almost all of Lagunitas' beers, great beers at a nice price."
""

""
"Good, decent stout.  Nothing special.  But for the price I will get again."
"Poured from 22oz bomber into karmeliet tripel glass. Very dark appearance as expected. Smells very good rich coffee scent. Taste is everything you'd want in a coffee stout. Good mouthfeel with minimal alcohol burn.  Overall a great example of the style."
"O- surprisingly spicier than I expected but it mixes well with the coffee."
""
""
"Overall, this beer was NOT expensive.  It is yet high quality.  Some bitterness but really well balanced and loaded with flavor.  Not as high of a gravity as some of the heavy hitters but is enjoyable to drink and I hope it is not a really limited edition."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nose is all roasty coffee with hints cocoa. Taste is bitter coffee up front that finishes with lingering burnt caramel. Feel is much slicker and chewier than I expected. Overall a very good imperial coffee stout reminiscent of GD Espresso Oak Aged Yeti that finishes slightly less bitter."
""
"Bottle. Started at 59 degrees.  Maybe a little warm but it is an imperial.  Dark brown.  Big frothy head that had staying power.   Reminded me of a root beer float!  Smell was underwhelming.  Some coffee and malt but not much.  Disappointing.  Flavor is coffee.  A little cappuccino bitterness in back end.  Mouth feel is strongest attribute.  Creamy.  Medium plus.   Overall this is a one note flavor beer.  Not very complex.  A bit boring after a while."
"Overall: nice to try once but not my favorite lag release. Not much coffee and a little thicker than I had imagined. Hides the alcohol well with a moderate hop finish."
""
"Randomly picked up this delicious stout today at my local grocery store, wish I picked up more."
"This motherfucker is MAJESTIC. Beautiful, dark, and fluffy out of the bomber, this stout is gorgeous. Every last drop is a treat that drinks like a coffee milkshake. Readily available as well - pick one of them bitches UP!"
""
""
"-overall a great coffee stout one always a good style and this beer was a decent example"
""
""
""
""
"Lagunitas Cappaccino Stout is true to its' name. Strong Coffee flavor and not much else going on. Too one dimensional for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent coffee-infused stout. The drinkability for such a dense, high ABV beer is pretty outstanding."
""
""
""
""
"Gotta love lagunitas they have the golden touch haven't had one of theirs I haven't liked I stopped drinking them for a while.. But I remember why I love them great taste high Abv economic price hope they keep up what they're doin."
""
""
""
"Delicious stout for my facehole."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor is green pepper dominant initially, becoming sweet and cocoa mid palate, and finishing a touch bitter and dry."
"My first sip was ""wow, this really tastes like strong coffee"".  And it does.  But I like coffee so it only took a few sips get get comfortable with it.  Get aroma, well balanced, nice body, really no negatives at all.  A fine brew."
""
"Damn the alcohol taste is very noticeable. Very strong coffee taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A very good coffee stout priced well at $4.49 a bomber."
""
"As coffee stouts go = OK. For the price, damn good."
"This beer was average.  Good stout.  But was expecting more prominent coffee tones."
""
""
""
"Beer snobs may not agree, but as others have said, at the price this is another Lagunitas winner. More details after my cold is over and I can appreciate it more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle into mason jar. Nice creamy head. Not as thick as I was hoping for a double/imperial. I had no problem finishing this one."
""
""
" Lagunitas can do no wrong. This is the first coffee stout that i can actually drink..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hefty bitter notes that remind me Starbucks or some equally bad French roast. Also not clear on what would constitute a ""cappuccino"" stout. Since I'm a coffee snob in addition to being a beer snob, I feel it necessary to point out that cappuccino is by definition a drink made from espresso and hot steamed milk. So, unless there is milk in this brew (or, more imaginatively, had this been a milk stout rather than an imeperial) then what we have here is a misnomer. It's an espresso stout at best. But, again, the only traces of espresso I get are of burnt beans..."
""
""
"rich in flavour"
""
"Great coffee notes and espresso flavor. A great stout!H"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A very nicely made beer by a company who obviously takes pride in its craft brews. I would absolutely buy this bear again. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"Coffee, coffee, coffee, For the price it's great, but only good not great when compared to similar coffee stouts. As always with Lagunitas however, at the price point it is a great beer and hard to beat if not impossible."
"Overall I'm glad I picked this up. Wanted to try it for a while. More chocolate than coffee as the name states. A little too boozy for me but still a great grab!"
""
"Very nice black color to it. Being a huge coffee person, I was pleased with the amount of coffee it provides. It is definitely not overwhelming in coffee flavoring what so ever. All at the same time, it keeps the foundation of a well structured stout. I can totally picture myself drinking this by my fireplace.."
"Dark beer with hardcore coffee flavor."
"Dark fruit with very little of any thing else in the flavor mix. Not bad but not good either."
""
""
""
"Black but letting some red light through, with a fluffy head that leaves lacing all the way down the glass. Smells like sweet espresso. Great espresso flavor, some sweetness, spicy almost.  Good body.  Awesome bomber for the price!"
"One of my favorites and pretty cheap. Very bold coffee flavor on top of a very full body dark roast malt base."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Nicely done again by Lagunitas, wonderful value and great flavors."
"Smooth and well for an evening by a fire"
"Big and smooth, but not so much on the coffee. What coffee there is leans to the oily, bitter side of the beans which, combined with a certain unctuousness, adds up to something like instant with Coffeemate. Plus an oddly twiggy hop bite, an unwieldy strength - a very drinkable stout, don't get me wrong. But also a lot I don’t like from a brewery I otherwise love and dies a death next to something like Founders Breakfast. 3.75"
""
""
""
""
"O: Delicious and cheap, especially for what it is. This is why people love Lagunitas, or used to."
""
""
"One of my new favorites"
""
""
""
""
"Easy drinking stout. Nice flavor. Had in bottle. Get again"
"Solid beer. Great looking stout. Nice balanced taste of coffee with only a slight alcoholic taste for over 8% ABV."
"Nice dark pour with a tan head. Lacing down the glass. Coffee notes and burnt malt, but not overly strong. Taste is really good, coffee comes though well, but doesn't overpower. Great evening beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great roasty taste, not bitter.  Light bodied, nice chocolate milk head."
""
""
""
""
"O: Was expecting a richer, sweeter brew. It's still ok, but not my favorite."
""
"This is a wonderful beer. The coffee flavor is not as pronounced as I prefer but still good. Its got a great black coffee bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good investment for a beer. The Alc. is 9%, and the cost is small; not to mention, the taste is good."
""
""
""
"O: Overall I thought this was an outstanding beer. The thing I love about this beer is that it is without a doubt centered around the coffee. The coffee is definitely the main player as opposed to faintly existing along with chocolate and big roasted malt flavors (as in some imperial stouts for example.) If you love coffee, I would highly recommend this beer. I am definitely getting a few bombers of this with my next haul!"
""
""
"Another great brew from lagunitas. So glad this beer made it to knoxville , tn."
"under five bucks and a world class stout."
""
""
"A real treat! A delicious, strong coffee stout. Another great brew from Lagunitas!!"
""
"Overall- Wonderfully brewed to the style, big coffee aroma and taste, intense and falvorful. The interesting aspect of this beer is the green pepperskin produced by the coffee beans, adds a nice feeling of heat and warmth. Great depth of flavor, rich mocha, chocolates, caramel, and hints of vanilla. Very enjoyable."
"Overall: Massive coffee notes abound with enough sweetness to make this an excellent breakfast beer or dessert beer."
""
""
""
"Nice coffee nose.  Malt, chocolate and coffee on the palate.  A nice, easy drinking stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Damn I should have not been too eager. I'm not sure about the cappuccino part - it's not that sweet - but there is some coffee and bittersweet presence. Let this one sit to enjoy...but not too long."
""
""
""
""
""
"When is it coming to Corvallis, Oregon??"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance 4.25, Aroma 3, Flavor 3.75, Palate 4, Overall 3.75"
""
"As it warms, it becomes much more expressive w/r/t to coffee/espresso notes. Top flight coffee stout. Consist high quality"
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the best tastings coffee brews i have had so far."
""
""
"Amazing stuff. I'm a huge fan of coffee stouts but this takes the cake. The alcohol flavor is very mild behind the strong, sweet coffee flavor. Very silky mouthfeel but with adequate carbonation. Extremely easy to drink especially considering the ABV. Wish they made six packs. Definitely buy"
"O-  Great stout.  Sweetness much enjoyed with the balance and required hop."
"Pours an incredibly deep brown, with just a hint of light getting through towards the bottom of the glass. It has  a thicker and creamier light tan head which most of it burns off pretty quickly but does linger and leave some small sticky/soapy lacing. The aroma is pretty mild, with faint hints of coffee and alcohol. The taste is more stout that coffee, with the coffee taking a back seat to the robust stout flavors and earthy hops. The body is a little oily with a bit of an alcoholic tingle on the finish."
""

""
""
""

""
"Overall: if you like dry Irish stouts this a beer you will like. It was not my favorite. But not terrible."
""
""
""
""
"Decent stout. Not lagunitas best"
""
""
"At the price point I would be hard pressed to find a better RIS. Delicious and complex contrary to some of these reviews."
""
""
"Not sure Lagunitas canals a bad beer. Although this one won't make it into my regular rotation, it's another solid selection. Nice coffee nose without being too heavy. At 9.2 ABV you taste some alcohol but it's not a drawback here. Very smooth. Good stuff."
""
""
"The coffee was a little more subdued then I'd like but this is still a great buy and the price is very reasonable. It's a quality stout with typical flavors. Nothing mind blowing but still worth a pick up."
""
""
""
""
""
"Glass- Snifter"
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad coffee stout, especially for the price. I thought the coffee was noticeably more subtle than other varieties of this style, such as Breakfast Stout or The Devil Made Me Do It, etc. That may be just fine for some but I expected a more coffee-forward brew, but it's acceptably tasty and drinkable, and again a great value."
"Good price, beautiful dark brown/coffee head, good taste!"
""
""
"Bomber for $4.99 here in Chicago you can't beat it! Great sweet espresso flavor hides the booze well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Rich&creamy lots of coffee flavor...excellent"
""
""
""
""
"Bitter stout with some roast & vodka finish."
""
"Apparently you can't give a beer a good rating without a review.  I liked this a lot....very similar to breakfast stout.  Sorry it's an outlier, but it is really good."
"Edit: This is 9.2%?! Wow, this does a great job at the level...and price. cheers"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thick milky white head that keeps a layer on top throughout the glass.Lighter taste that I seek out in these type of beers. Strong hints of the coffee. Very satisfying."
""
""
""
""
"Best coffee stout out there!"
""
"AP: pours a murky brown, with a nice two finger khaki head that moderately dissipates to a nice lingering layer with lacing that chases down the glass. AR: more caramel and brown sugar notes than coffee. Some dark raisin bread. TA: more coffee lingers in and stays around to the very back. Dark raisin toast and over ripe dark fruits are in the middle. Quite a departure from the aroma. Just enough bittering in the end. MF: semi sticky coats the mouth, but doesn't consume it. Semi drying at the end leaves you wanting more. OV: there are worse ways to spend $6. There are better coffee porters/stouts out there, but not many for the money or size."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I do like this beer and I think it is one of the best examples of a stout brewed with coffee that I've tried so far. I still prefer their standard Imperial Stout but there is no question that this beer is world class. The price was killer too: $4.50 for a bomber!"
"This is a very good beer.  The coffee flavor, as the name suggests, comes off a bit too ""intentional"" for my taste...but the label warns of this.  I thought I'd like it less than I did.  If you like a coffee scented beer, you'll love this!"

"This is my first review. Been using ba to find new diamonds in the rough to try each week. Drinking from a 22oz bomber... This beer is delicious. This tastes more like a porter than a stout to me lacking the fullness of a stout although  best in the category I've had to date so far. Hides the abv well. Not as dark and full bodied as a stout very smooth and perfect for Christmas night! Would not pass up if I have the opportunity to purchase again."

"Bomber poured into a Lagunitas mason jar glass (snagged two of these in Montana of all places). Pours a dark chocolate brown (near black) with around three fingers of tan creamy foam. Aroma is dark roast, earthy spice, and resinous hops right off the bat, with a whiff of sweet rum. Unique stout, this. Notably hop-forward, leaf and earth but little aggressive ashy character (a plus in my book). Getting some strong spicy notes that recall ginseng (read: dirt) and turmeric, along with the expected dark roast coffee, a little toffee or butterscotch, some assertive boozy flavors coming through. Any actual coffee flavor is nicely melded into the mix. This is not a particularly sweet stout. Nor is it particularly ashy or burnt. Really, and maybe I'm just strange, its the earthy and spicy hops coming forward, along with some chocolate and diacetyl that starts low key and slowly becomes more prominent over time. Low carbonation and mid-range body, not terribly thick. Finish is interestingly devoid of harsh bitterness but there is ample hop flavor and more roasted notes. A curious beer, this. Perhaps more to my liking than other coffee stouts that register more in the charred range."

"Overall - A well-executed and enjoyable coffee stout from Lagunitas. Excellent espresso notes with a good supporting cast coming from the malts, chocolate, and molasses make this a definite stand out. Well done, Lagunitas."

"Thin dark pour with a good frothy head. Smells like coffee. Not much else can be picked up over the coffee aroma. So good. Dark roasted coffee taste with a good amount of sweet mocha flavor. Thumbs up!"

"I'm very impressed by this complex, flavorful, and very smooth stout (and quite boozy hehe).  What is most impressive is the use of coffee in the brew without the flavor coming across as stale, overly bitter, or metallic.  Well worth the 6 bucks I paid for the bomber at the Hennessey Market in Butte, Montana."

"Not a very smooth stout. This beer has a rich flavor, with a decent amount of bite - which is not my taste. This was an adventurous choice for me (price-wise) and I wouldn't get it again. Very dark and full, but the overall flavor wasn't to my liking."

"A very nice offering from Lagunita's brewery. Beer pours a dark brown hue with some rays of light coming through. Nice tan head that dies down to a thin layer of foam and tight beaded lacing. Color is a little odd for a stout, but still very nice. Smells of chocolate, strong coffee, and a hint of sweet cream and vanilla on the nose. Nice mouthfeel, thick and coating, with strong dark brewed coffee and bitter chocolate on the front with a light sweet vanilla taste in the background. An excellent stout."

"Overall: I didn't realize this would be this good. I liked the cute puppy on the label, and I like coffee stouts so figured it'd be worth a shot. Wow, I'm glad I gave it a try, and I'm tempted to go buy a few more bottles."
""

"O - another overall hit from one of my favorite brewers. Great beer to get started with. If I was going to drink a beer before noon, this is one I would pick."

"This is probably my favorite stout, so far. The cappucino flavor is pretty intense. The blend of roasted malt, coffee and caramel was outstanding. It poured a very appealing dark brown with a light tan head in a pint glass. It is a quite heavy beer, which is my preference, so I was very pleased with this beer. I bought it in a 32 oz. growler, should have got more. I haven't found it on draft since, but when I do, I will definitely buy this one again."
""
""
"O - For the money this is a great bargain. The flavors are very big and bold. A must try for fans of coffee forward stouts."
""
""
""
""
"O - Pretty good stout, especially if you're looking for a bit of kick in the flavor."
""
""
""
"Poured into an icicle tulip glass from a bomber bottle. Appearance is dark brown with a small tan head that dissipates slowly. Smell is of rich sweet malts and fresh roasted coffee. Taste is  started by a solid sweet malty front with a fresh coffee background. Roasted malts and dark chocolate round out the finish. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with a wet slightly dry finish. Overall very enjoyable anytime of day, from dawn till dusk. I really enjoyed this brew."
""

"Fresh, heavy coffee flavor above a roasty stout of medium thickness which helps keep it drinkable."
""
""
""
"Pours a nice dark brown coffee with a tremendous thick creamy head. Nice smell of coffee. Tastes like coffee, literally. Very slight bitterness at the end just like coffee. Creamy and easy to drink. This one hits the mark. If you like coffee taste, this beer duplicates it perfectly. I was even tempted to put some cream and sugar in this thing. Great beer! And just a warning, I had half the bomber at supper time and for some reason I could not fall asleep!"
""
"Dark brown to black in color with deep amber hues on the edge of the glass. Poured with a short light beige foam that slowly reduced to a light wispy cap. Dark roasted malt, sweet dark chocolate and roasted coffee aromas with sweet dark fruit notes at the end. Medium bodied with a  initially grainy feel that quickly transitioned to a viscous oily feel through the middle to the end. Sweet dark chocolate flavor quickly followed bt dark roasted malt. Bitter hop flavors through the middle that are intensified by bitter dark roasted coffee and charred malt flavors from the middle to the end. Finished with a slightly dry feel and a intensely bitter pine hop and black coffee aftertaste."

""
""

""
""
"Amazing beer for a surprisingly low price, nice light color head, aroma blew me away didn't know what to expect from a cappuccino stout. Taste was on par with the awesome coffee aroma, mouthfeel was very pleasant just the right amount of carbonation. I took my time drinking this one, wish I had bought a few more."

"Have tried in the bottle. Very good. Tried on draft today. Solid base IS, with rich coffee aromas and flavors. This stands up with other great coffee stouts like FBS, in my opinion. Tons of coffee packed into this one. Lagunitas stands up to its rep for quality beers at a great price."
""
""
""
"I am partial to the java stouts. My favorites are probably Bell's Java Stout and the Hitachino's Espresso Brew. However, this crew has a great aroma and flavor. The head was sturdy and a light caramel in color. The aroma was truly exquisite with a combination of chocolate and vanilla...and obviously chocolate. The only things better than the appearance and the smell were the taste. Smooth, ""tasty"". A definite must have...just don't drink too many."

"O: This would be an excellent breakfast stout. The melding of coffee and stout is not new - but if it works keep doing it. I love this combination and it works well in this beer. The 9.2% ABV is up there in the imperial range - but you taste none of the alcohol. The low IBU keeps the hop bitterness in check. It is a well done example of a coffee stout. I will drink more. Cheers."

"I love good coffee and I love good beer. This seemed like a no brain-er so I picked up a bottle. The appearance was a very dark hazel with a coffee colored head. One sniff and you are blasted by the smell of roasted coffee beans which carries over to the taste. If you do not like coffee, then you will not like this beer. It is anything but subtle but I liked that they used such good ingredients because I thought it tasted fantastic. A perfect beer for kegs and eggs."
""
""
""
"Overall: its a good brew love the freat coffee wish it was aged and was a more thick. But still a great fresh stout to enjoy."
""
""
"O: This is a very interesting stout. For a 9.2% ABV, it is one of the mellowest stouts I’ve had. The mouthfeel was absolutely surprising but enjoyable. However, being mellow has its disadvantages in that the taste itself is rather gentle. Overall it is very good but could benefit from a stronger flavor."
""
""
""
""
""

"Excellent beer poured into my trusty pint glass. Dark black color with an okay head. Taste just like cappuccino. And it is irrestisable and very addicting. Probably the best i have had from Launitas. i would like to see more beers like this one. By far the best of the coffee type stouts i have had"
""
""
""
"The taste has such a nice combination of sweet dark malts and coffee that it becomes rather easy to drink. 9.2% ABV? Hardly. Well, what I mean by that is that the alcohol is well-masked but I'm sure I'll be spinning a bit later. Coffee seem to be a big rage in 2014 and this one is right up there with the best."

"For the price this is one of the best bargains in beer as its full of flavor and the flavors are top notch."

"My girlfriend got me into stouts. Before her I generally just drank IPAs and Trippels. I find stouts a good change of pace from those types. In any case, I'll generally buy a good stout I've never seen before if I come across it since she likes them and it's a good excuse. She particularly likes stouts with coffee in them, so this was a no brainer. I'm really not a beer expert in the sense that I know what constitutes good ""mouthfeel"" or can detect notes of coriander. I just drink a crapload of beer. This is definitely one of the best I've had. I think the only one I like more is Founder's Breakfast Stout. Still, the difference is minimal enough that you could serve me a glass of each and I probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference."
""
""

"This is a very nice coffee stout. It doesn't try to be anything special or out of the ordinary, but just stays true to the concept. It might not be a game changing coffee stout, but it's on point and very enjoyable. Well done."

"O: I really liked this coffee stout. Lagunitas has always been a reliable brewery and a go-to for me. This a pretty good coffee stout, maybe not the best, but definitely worth trying. Especially since a bomber of it is only about five dollars. I recommend it!"

"0verall this beer, like most Lagunitas products, is a great bargain. Big on taste -- like a milk stout on steroids, dosed with coffee -- but wont weigh you down. Doesn't drink like a 9.2% beer -- it goes down easy, but you'll feel your body start warming up pretty quickly."

"comments = overal good coffee brewed stout beer. when thinking of a cappuccino stout, i was looking for a creamy flavor that would coat the tongue. Almost like the creme from a fresh brewed shot of espresso. i have another bottle that i will attempt to age. i think it will taste much better with time."
""
""
"Pours a little on the thin side but nice creamy, off white head. Not as black as I'd expect for a stout. Aroma of bittersweet chocolate and coffee along with a distinct happiness. Cold coffee flavor with a fairly strong hop presence. The coffee and hops along with the hight alcohol lend an almost chili pepper flavor. For a beer called cappuccino stout I expect something more creamy. This beer is just too thin bodied. It's a nice coffee stout but it really needs more body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a solid, tasty stout. Definitely a dessert-like sipper."
"Pours dark brown with some ruby around the edges and a big two-finger khaki head. The nose is rather subdued, but what's there is coffee, roasted malts, and maybe a little bit of chocolate, if I strain really hard to get a third descriptor. It tastes of ground black coffee predominantly, with dark chocolate, some dark fruit qualities, and vanilla far in the background. There's an earthy hop bite and it has a medium mouthfeel. Lagunitas makes some great stuff and I love coffee stouts, but this comes as a disappointment. Not terrible though."

"Snap edit: As I'm sipping on this (about 45min later), the feel seems to be completely different. It's got a great silkiness to it that I was looking for when I first cracked the bottle. Where it came from/how it developed, I'll never know, but it's made me knock up the mouthfeel and overall rating from 3.75 to a 4. Fabulous brew."

"O I'm not impressed by this beer at all."

""
""
"Body is thin with high carbonation. Really would like a thicker, chewier body here. If this beer had that, I think it would be great, but the water feel definitely takes away from the overall enjoyment. However, this beer really packs a huge coffee punch which I appreciated."

""
""
"O- Simply average."
"Overall: Pretty much what I expected when opening up a espresso stout. Lots of black coffee and dark chocolate accents. Nothing that well blow you away but no doubt a brew that is worth of a try if this type of brew strikes your fancy."

""
"A very well-put-together coffee-infused stout."
""
""
"Man, I really enjoyed this, and this really confirmed to me that Lagunitas can really do no wrong overall when it comes to the quality of the beer vs. the low prices they're charging them for. This is an excellent coffee stout - simultaneously bitter and sweet, with a light spiciness, and ridiculously easy to find just about anywhere around here. Definitely difficult to tackle a bottle all on your own, but can be easily split. Delicious stuff - in my book, at this point, Lagunitas has crowned themselves as one of America's definitive breweries of the New World style brewing that occurs here."

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: If you like coffee stouts, you will not be disappointed with this one. Very good."
"Finish is long coffee and alcohol dominate the malt that is present. Hop bitter is there and balances along with bitter coffee and chocolate. Really its balanced but not necessarily with hop. Kinda cool. The lack of malt sweetness lessens the need for a heavy bitter and this beer actually responds to that need with a nice complex but mild bitter from multiple sources."

""
"O: 9.2% goes down like water for a reason - the beer is outstanding, not exactly sessionable only because it is of such a quality that it should be savored slowly, but certainly makes you want more of it sooner rather than later. Well-balanced in every respect."

"22oz bottle $4.99. Solid black but if I hold it to the light it is more brown like a porter. good half-inch of head. Aroma of wet coffee grounds, bitter ones. Sweet flavor, sugar and coffee grounds, bitterness too. Actually this has some real bitterness to it. Solid beer for the price."
""
""
"Overall: I actually really like this stout. It's very balanced with the hint of sweetness with all that bitterness from the coffee. This isn't something that I would drink every day but it's something that every once and a while would be nice. This is a saturday or sunday morning beer for sure."
"O: Very enjoyable. Very agreeable coffee flavors without being overpowering. Not near as intense as, for instance, Santa Fe's Imperial Java Stout, but seems very balanced and pleasant given the stronger alcohol content. Recommended to any fan of coffee stouts!"

"*The Smuttynose Robust Porter I had after this, at 6% abv.,was more robust than this beer in every way, shape, or form. This was a fairly tasty coffee stout but a forgettable imperial stout for sure and will stick with their hoppy beers from now on."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 1/18/2014. Pours crystal clear nearly opaque dark brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of roasted coffee, chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, brown bread, light roast, herbal, floral, light pine, and floral/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of coffee and dark/roasted malt notes with moderate hop presence; and good strength. Taste of roasted coffee, chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, brown bread, light roast, herbal, floral, light pine, and floral/roasted earthiness. Fair amount of floral/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of coffee, chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, brown bread, light roast, herbal, floral, light pine, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and coffee flavors with moderate hop presence; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice coffee stout. All around good balance and robustness of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Dark, nice effervescence, nice tight head, and some fair lacing. Nose is roasted malt and coffee, with some sweet balance. Roasted nuts and coffee. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"O: Damn good imperial stout for the price, I might pick up another bottle and try aging it to see if it improves once the hops fall off."
"O - I haven't had another stout specifically labeled as a Coffee Stout so I can't compare, but this is good. Definitely different from Lagunitas's Imperial Stout. It's not an all the time thing for me, but I don't regret it every so often when I find it."
""

"O: Really good, but ultimately nothing that stands out among other coffee stouts."
"Overall: this is a good coffee stout. It lacks a bit from being phenomenal! The visual piece is where I find it lacks the most (beer snob remark). It isn't a dense black body that I have become accustomed to. It stands it's own, don't get me twisted. I can recommend this but it falls short in comparison with other coffee stouts on the market. This brew is worthy."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bomber into a Lagunitas mason jar pint glass. Was a dark brown with slight transparency around the edges, a inch or so of khaki head. The smell was dominated by a dark roast coffee. Taste backed up the smell with an earthy coffee taste as the primary flavor, with the taste waning a bit as it warmed. The beer was pretty thin in the mouth for such a strong coffee smell/taste, and felt even a bit acidic as it warmed up. Not a bad beer, but not nearly as good as others in it's class."
"Overall, definitely a solid coffee stout, even if it's nothing to proselytize about. Still, for the price point, it's an easy purchase, and one I will definitely make again."

"It's one of those find it and don't hestitate to pick this up otherwise you have FAILED IN LIFE! Yes I will go that far to describe this beer. I love coffee, and I love this beer so damn much it is the icing on the cake to what is already finely established with Guinness Beers but it adds just the extra kick that is needed for the tastes inbetween tastes. I found this at the store and I gobbled it up and bought out the store. Why? This is my hands down best tasting and expertly crafted beer I have ever tasted in my goddamn life, ever. This beats out Real Ale Coffee Porter, if the porter is a daily go to, this Stout is the grand mutha final boss. Why because it has the taste, AND the kick to whack some sense into ya. While the porter is like yeh expertly crafted coffee aftertaste. If i had to go to an island and i had to pick one thing. it would be a truckload of this beer in some forever ice cold fridge on some paradise island. End of story. Period."

"the nights are gettin a little colder here- so i decided to try this cappuccino stout from lagunitas. this beer is a near opaque black- held up to the light there is a coffee brown hidden deep in all that darkness. the smell is rich with chocolate malts, there is a little coffee there, but its not super heavy. the taste is nutty and bitter with a coffee tinge at the back end- the after taste is practically the same as if i just drank a cup of black coffee. some of the best stouts i've had are coffee stouts. when i see one from a quality brewer like lagunitas ill definitely give it a try."

"Overall, this is a very nice stout, the cappuccino notes in here thankfully largely blending nicely with everything (as opposed to overpowering them, as often happens), and the wide range of sugars balancing out the dark ashes. There is still a rather large coffee presence that does slightly overpower some of the more subtle notes, and the alcoholic vapors in the aftertaste are quite potent, but there’s still much in here to enjoy."
""
"a bomber bought for a friend in december '12, opened sept '13. dark, dark, dark, but a bit of light shines thru from my phone's flashlight, a deep blood/garnet red. delicate lacing on the top transitions to nice, stronger lacing down the glass. smell is thick, sweet malty dark roast coffee. it's picked up some smoky old world character, taste is mellowing out a touch. very approachable for such a coffee forward brew, and with an abv that's sure to get you in trouble if you aren't careful. interesting that it seems to be missing some of their characteristic sweetness. i was a big fan of this specialty from lagunitas, no i am even more so, and will look forward to grabbing several this winter to age longer. very recommended."
""
""
"O: I've had a couple of better coffee stouts, but just one or two. This is really good, and impressive in its complexity and balance (not many brewers could fit this many flavors together and have them work so well together). I could nit-pick about how it could have been creamier and a few other minor issues, but that would take the focus off the fact that this is a mighty good beer, and very reasonably priced for the quantity and quality you get."
""
""
"From my tasting notes: The Cappuccino Stout poured a deep brown almost black with creamy tan head. The aroma held sweet malts and the punch of coffee that was a good sign of things to come. The taste had everything I was looking for in a coffee stout. It was big and bold with a good coffee flavor and a deep bittersweet chocolate malt on a full creamy body that was full and satisfying. Lagunitas made another great beer and exactly what I wanted in a satisfying coffee stout."

"I really like coffee stouts, especially when they actually have a coffee taste. This beer definitely has a coffee taste right out front, but it falls into one of the traps that I find with anything that has coffee flavors, it tastes like coffee grounds, not the actual coffee. I think this beer is good, but there are so many other coffee beers out there now that if I am going to make a choice this is probably not going to be near the top of my list."

"a great stout, in some ways due to the method here i think, but a great beer in other contexts im sure. i had this as a pairing with a fresh strawberry and vanilla ice cream dessert, its like an affogato orgasm, no kidding. the dark malts and the chalky bitter coffee balance out the melting ice cream and sweet strawberries, a dessert of unrivaled complexity and satisfaction. the beer itself is also lovely, although maybe not quite so divine as a standalone. it has a dense brown glow and less than in inch of airy mocha lace. the coffee isn't as forward as it is in some of these, its sort of right in balance with the dark malts and bakers chocolate elements. light in feel for its size and strength, made possible largely by its lack of sweetness and dry feel, uncommon for the style. this is one of the better lagunitas beers, and i say that because its different than the rest of them. i don't taste that same old yeast strain, and its just a little less arrogant, a little more subtle. a sleeper with a caffeine hit, go figure!"

"This pours a dark brown color with a foamy beige head. The aroma is very malty with hints of bitter hops. The taste is fairly malty with a smooth texture and a lingering cappuccino taste. There is a little bit of a spicy, hop finish. This is a pretty well rounded."

" Taste was bitter roasted coffee, Caramel, tobacco with a hint of sweetness. Also noted was a bit of pit fruit tang from the hops, finished with bitter coffee and some spicy spikes on the tongue. Overall a very nice brew and for a American Double/ Imperial Stout it does the job, with more Cappuccino flavor as it warms and a 9.20 ABV it's a solid choice and I will pick this up again."

"generally, after i've overstuffed my gullet on a big meal of mashed potatoes, roasted asparagus, vinagretted salad, and (seemingly discordant) kimchi, followed by a course of various hard cheeses from spain and portugal, i binge further and help myself to a mugful of breyers vanilla icecream. i know there are better dessert options out there, but in terms of consistency and availability, said flavor really shines. what i do not want, historically, after giant dinners with menus akin to the one above described, is beer. enter lagunitas espresso stout, which breaks all precedent. i was full like thanksgiving, stuffed to the gills, but not ready to let the night end, and all out of breyers. so i reached into the cellar and withdrew this whopper (which, at $4.99 for twenty-two ounces, is among the best-priced beers on the market) from the cellar and pried off the cap. the first sip was a total knockout--terrifically bitter, but, beyond that, unbelievably complex. it poured handsomely with a short, dry head that dissolved quickly. i took my time drinking it, such that by the time i had an inch-or-so left in my collins glass, it was well warmed. hot coffee gone cold i find repulsively unenjoyable, but chilled espresso stout turned room temperature? outstanding. those final sips even tasted a bit like vanilla ice cream."

"O- Really no complaints about this one. Big flavors, very drinkable, solid."
"Overall - I will be returning to the store to pick up another couple of these before they go out of season. Delicious imperial stout. Will most certainly look forward to trying this beer whenever I see it and I'm in the mood for a creamy, sweet stout."
"Overall: great for the price (4.99) but id rather drink a Stone Espresso IRS or a Founder Breakfast Stout. I like the chocolate and coffee presence but the hop bitterness seemed little much for this type of beer. It tastes a lot better once you let it sit and warm for a bit, i will be trying this again in the future."

"O/D - A nice coffee stout. I expected more richness b/c of the name, but it does well. If the coffee was hammered down a bit better you could ignore the lack of complexity. Tasty enough though."

"This pours a roasted caramel color, the shade of a dark coffee or cola. It has a nice aroma of toffee and coffee notes, rounded and smooth. The flavor has a lot of the coffee and toffee notes as well, without being sharp or overly roasty. It’s a mild taste with a sweet finish and a light body. Really enjoyable!"

"O - Next year when this comes out I will pick it up for sure if I can find it. Very nice, great sipper, and at 3.99 for a bomber I'm sold!"

"Overall – Quite delicious. A big sweet coffee/cappuccino stout with a nice smooth flavor profile and feel. Give it a chance if you can."
"Overall: I really enjoyed the flavors in this beer, I just feel that it is a little thin in mouthfeel, although still sweet. This thing drinks like a cup of coffee, not like a coffee stout, which is what I think they were going for. Considering the price-point, I would say this is a great buy, and will certainly satisfy any coffee lovers cravings."
""
"Overall: Extremely pleased with this. If it weren't for the abv, I would drink a pint before I went to work. Or pour cereal into it. It's that good. A great experience that I'll hold as the bar to judge others with. The only improvements I could see is a bit more complexity with the nose, and a bit more of a cappuccino taste. (After all, it's called a cappuccino stout) otherwise, awesome!"

"This beer lives up to the name. It's coffee forward with a sweet cream background. nice roasted malts with vanilla accents. Very nice for breakfast or dessert...or anytime really. This is a great stout for the $"

"Cappuccino Stout pours a black color with a long lasting creamy white head. The aroma is quite weak, and has a lactose like smell. The taste has a nice roasted malty flavor, with a lot of sweet coffee flavors; cappuccino flavors. Good full flavor and easy to drink. Overall a fanatic coffee stout, strong cappuccino like flavors."

"Delicious. Grabbed this at non descript NJ liquor store, run of the mill craft but this one stood out and was stored cold. Better than I thought it would be. Beautiful dark brown, great head and retention throughout. Smells and tastes like cappuccino, with a little hop presence. Aroma gets better as you go. Drinks so easy, very creamy and pretty thick. This beer really sizzles on the tongue, leaving a great, memorable experience. Great value buy, glad I got 2."
""
"O: I expected more coffee out of this one, i mean it IS a cappuccino stout after all. A good stout though, just didn't wow me in the coffee factor."
"O- $4.99 for an RIS this good! Are you kidding me? Shhh... don't tell Lagunitas that this is better than half of the $15-20 Stouts on the market. Amazing depth, a fantastic inter-play between bitter/sweet/sour fruit. I need to put out an ISO: for a 2011 bottle so my vertical from 2008 will stay intact. Why buy a Starbucks coffee for $5 when you can have this beauty?"

"For 4.99 a bomber, this is one of the best deals out there for an imperial stout. Tons of great coffee flavor."

"O: This beer is deceptive in it's strength as the alcohol is extremely well hidden - I really enjoyed the coffee flavors which become even more pronounced as the beer warms up. Pretty easy to drink."

""
""
""

"Overall- Not too bad. I have had coffee stouts with more coffee flavor but this is still worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Lagunitas has always been at least fairly impressive, and I would rate this around that area. It's got a few twists to the coffee porter/stout that I like, but it does nothing spectacular."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is just not my thing. I can see coffee lovers digging this but it's just strange to me. I do think this should be drunk at a colder temp than other stouts as the warmer this became, the stranger the taste became."
""
""
""
""
"Dark stout color with coffee undertones and plenty of mouthfeel. Pours heavily and with a nice head that lingers. Aromas of chocolate and coffee with alcohol that gently snips from the glass: but a heavy enough beer that disguises the alcohol content. Mouthfeel is full and smooth and not overwhelming. Very drinkable. Plenty of character but not too heavy. I'll have another."
"The only thing I found a bit out of balance in this beer is the alcohol, the sharp note in the smell comes through in the taste of the beer, rising off the back of the palate and muscling out some of the nice malty notes in the finish. Overall, definitely worth a try."

"Don't be discouraged by it's appearance, and trust the genii (that's plural genius for all you geniuses out there [I know. Shut up. {fine}]) at Lagunitas to do their job well. Which they do. Also they are really friendly, and the brewery is awesome and you should go there."
""
"This is definitely one of the best coffee beers I've had. It definitely has a sedating but uplifting buzz to it from the coffee they inject into the beer. It tastes like a bold coffee but still like a beer because of the hoppy bitterness.... a fantastic beer."
"I am enjoying this beer. Not as complex as some other imperial stouts that I have tried but I am happy to have had it and will likely buy it again. Going out to the bar after this one and hoping for a caffeine kick!"

""
""
""
""
"Appropriately pours a dark coffee brown capped by a two finger fluffy off-white head. Great retention and tons of splotchy lacing that coats the majority of the inside of the glass. Espresso, some dark fruit, a hint of vanilla, and alcohol. Sweet malt joined by espresso, charred malt, hints of bakers chocolate touched by vanilla throughout that finishes with warming alcohol. On the heavier side of medium-bodied, slick with a hint of creaminess. Overall, this brew was enjoyable, solid, but nothing special. Definitely worth the price point."
""
""
"Pours black with a thin white head that lingers with bubbles and leaves excellent lacing. The smell is mostly of spent coffee and vanilla without much else. The taste is big and chocolaty with a lot of coffee flavor as well, with some earthy bitter notes that linger for a long time. The mouthfeel is creamy and makes the beer a slow drinker but not out of form for the style. Overall I am impressed with this one from lagunitas, Im happy it caught my eye."

"O - a good beer, if not so good in the mouth. I'd love to try it on tap because I think the mouthfeel would benefit from kegging. Lagunitas continues to produce quality IMO."
""
""
""
"As the beer warms it gets a bit better. More depth of flavors for sure. I increased my rating slightly because of this."
""
"O: This is a great beer and for its price I don't know why I don't hoar this must have brew. Coffee is definitely there but obviously works well with the roasted malt and bitterness of the hops."
""
""
"O- good beer, can't complain when you can get a bomber of 9% beer for $5!"
""
"D- very pleased with this one. Not so milky as cappuccino, but if you go into this one expecting a big snifter full of 9.2%abv espresso, you won't be disappointed. It's gettin me buzzed up too like I might go clean the house now idk. Great price at $5.99 as well."
""
"Tomorrow I will finish the bomber- perhaps the coffee will be more accented, but at a cellar temp there is a mellower taste."
""
""
""
"O - Overall, a good stout. But the alcohol is a bit too pronounced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- of the coffee infused beer I have tasted on my beer a day journey, I would say that this is a close second behind Black's Dawn. I would like to have multiple half pints of this on draft while I read the paper in the morning. It is a bit of a novelty to drink this one while the head is thick and present. very tasty indeed. Like most coffee stouts and porters I would love to taste it on nitro."
"Overall - I like this offering from Lagunitas and buy several during the winter. It's slightly above average for its style. Nothing world class about it but I always remember that if I want a quick caffeine/booze fix, this does the trick quite well. I think it has a great value at $4.99 a bomber for a high abv stout at 9.2% ."

"Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout ---4/5"
""
""
""
"O- I honestly expected more from this beer. It was way too bitter for my liking, and I drink bitter espresso daily. Lack of complexity just leaves me wanting more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was a really good coffee stout. Went down way to easy."
"OVERALL: Get past the thin look and light feel on this one, which is totally not up to standards for the imperial stout style, and this is actually a flavorful and aromatic coffee stout. The cappuccino definitely takes the lead here and makes it a bit of a one-man show, but some other elements are still able to play a role. Another enjoyable Lagunitas beer. Thans again Doops!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Balanced, delicious, and delivers exactly what it promises! I will have to do this again, great beer from a consistently enjoyable brewery."
""
"So good !"
""
"O - Solid coffee stout. I especially liked how it brought some elements that I love in both light-roast and dark-roast coffees. I think some additional chocolate and vanilla would provide a bit of needed balance. Scratches the coffee itch."
""
""
""
"O: a good coffee flavored stout if you like a strong espresso kick with a hint of fruity sweetness"
""
"Overall, would have given if it 5s across the board if it had been more true to style. An incredibly enjoyable beer for those who are looking for an intro into the world of stouts and porters. Would recommend in a heartbeat to anyone. Cheers!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good but not my favorite. Probably my least favorite beer made by Lagunitas."
"O- It is a very tasty and well-made stout. It is accommodatingly rich and is hard to tell it is 9% ABV. The sweetness is well-accepted, but once again I'd like a more sugary cappuccino taste to it. Although. for stout fans, I would recommend giving this one a taste, especially considering the reasonable price. I got mine for $6, but It's been known to go for $5."
""
"Overall a great chocolate coffee stout. Perfect on a cold winter day, sitting in front of the fire. The more Lagunitas I drink the better I like that brewery."
""
"O - A well blended coffee stout that packs a punch. Nicely balanced and flavorful, this is definitely a seasonal release to revisit."
""
"The mouthfeel is creamy with the perfect amount of carbonation."
"When it comes to stouts, this is the absolute best I've ever had (so far) and I really look forward to future ""dates"" with this brew..excellent!"
""
"Great take on the style, really interesting and flavourful. Worth a try."
""
""
""
"D: A solid, but not great, coffee stout. As mentioned above, not too complex but the coffee note is very well done."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good stout, but nothing to get into a froth about. I'd have another, sure, but I'm largely ambivalent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. It's a bit overbearing, but it is exactly what you would want from a cappuccino-inspired stout, if that makes sense. Good, but more than one and your taste palette is ruined."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was really excited to try this one but the off taste was off-putting. It totally ruined the beer for me. Knowing it's a seasonal, I can't imagine the bottle was old."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not as good as I was expecting, perhaps my expectations for Lagunitas have been put up too high based on their other brews. Still a very solid stout, but I would've liked more of a heavy coffee flavor and maybe less of a bourbon burn."

""

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was an above average example of a Coffee Stout, it had all the aspects that I look for in the style but it didn't seem as robust and as well rounded as some of the best Coffee Stouts. This beer had decent drinkability, it wad fairly smooth and the flavors held my attention but the alcohol could have been hidden a little better, one bomber is enough for me and I wouldn't mind splitting it with someone. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, it looked pretty damn good in my snifter and it's one of the better looking Coffee Stouts I've seen. What I liked the least about this beer was that it was jut a little thin and the alcohol stuck out a little too much, I thought those aspects could use a little work. I would probably buy this beer again if in the mood since it was pretty nice and the price was very good, but it's not going to beat out Founders Breakfast Stout as my go to Coffee Stout for the season, If you like Coffee Stouts I recommend giving this a try. All in all this was a solid beer, and I expect nothing less from Lagunitas since they are a pretty good brewery and I've never had a beer from them I hated. It can't hang with the best of them but it's nice for what it is. Lagunitas makes good beers at great prices, cheers guys."

"A nice beer, probably one of the darkest I’ve had. I don’t drink coffee, but if it tastes as good as this, then I might start having it."
""

"Overall certainly a sipper, the alcohol is very obvious. A fairly decent beer but not great by lagunitas standards."
""
""

"Overall: It’s a quality brew, but a bit overdone…the extreme cappuccino flavor is tasty, but dominates everything in sight leaving absolutely no room for anything else…this could be dialed back a bit to give a more balanced flavor, but that’s just me…the abundance of coffee does produce an acidity that I don’t normally find in beer, which I can’t say I like 15 ounces into my bomber…it’s good and drinkable, but not something I would get overly excited about in the future…I chose to drink this one ‘cause I was getting tired a little too early in the evening and I’m pretty sure I’m now gonna be up for a good couple of hours…maybe I should recommend this for a morning football tailgate…(3/5)"
"Overall - very delicious. Since its cappuccino stout, I expected something more creamy and smooth... This actually goes the other way with being big and smokey, with the coffee being well balanced, instead of in your face. Very well done, I would love to have another!"
""
""
""
"O: pleasantly surprised. Follows suit with pretty much all lagunitas beers. Never gonna be bad. I got a case gifted so not sure the price but guessing 5 or 6 bucks. Can't complain. Goes great with pb&j and Ron burgandy"
"O- a little more boozy tasting than I'd ideally like but still great flavores with a ton of roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate and just enough enough hops to remind you that you're drinking a Lagunitas."

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:solid stout tastes as advertised but I wish flavors were stronger. Though on the other hand it was drinkable and hid alcohol well so I'd say if you like cappuccino flavors in your stouts give it a try if not its not a must have but it's good"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice coffee stout with plenty of coffee presence while preserving the stout qualities. A nice breakfast sipper or night time warmer, this one is extremely versatile. Definitely worth picking up"
""
"This is my favorite coffee stout to date. Fantastic roasty, dark malt presence on this. Coffee is prominent on the nose & on the palate as well. Mouthfeel is medium-thin. In some other coffee stouts, the coffee flavors have not come through as well as this one. This seems like a great example of the style. I might be in the minority, but I'll take this over FBS. Flavors seem to blend together very nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice alternative to other winter beers which are typically spiced. Strong and very tasty. I foresee myself buying a few more of these for the holidays."
"Overall - As previously mentioned, a true favorite. Differs from the barrage of other coffee stouts out there, due to the fact that THIS one tastes like it has coffee in it. Also worth mentioning in this category : Real Ale Coffee Porter (Blanco, Texas), and Santa Fe Imperial Java Stout. Cheers!!!"

""
""
""
""
"great all-around coffee stout. coffee taste/fragrance really comes through nicely"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very good drinkability, very well done ! Coffee is relatively discrete in my opinion but the aging might be in cause..."
""
""
"The high 9% ABV is impressively well hidden in the flavour, with only a hint of alcohol warmth at the end. The initial flavour is very coffee-forward, but both chocolate and caramelized malt sweetness are also prevalent. There is a nice west-coast hop backbone that offers some contrast and the finish transitions to bitter eventually, but for me this is definitely a desert beer."
"Sometimes I feel like Frasier when I pick up some beers... Anyway, this stuff pours a deep black-brown topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises dark coffee, roasted malts, and toast. The taste brings in more of the same, with, unsurprisingly, the coffee taking center stage. Somehow, despite an even darker roast, the flavors never become too bitter or acrid, something I'd like to see happen more often. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a tasty, if a bit monomaniacal, coffee stout. 'Nuff said."
""
"O: A very good, smokey, coffee stout. But the sweet taste upfront is a bit off-putting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from 22oz bottle into HF tulip. Poured a deep brown, but somewhat see through. Nice tan head, gone quick. It looks good, but deff not like a stout. Smells is fantastic. Great roasted malts, coffee, and nice boozey notes. Taste is very good...caramel like, coffee, and good slightly bitter roasted malts. Easy drinker and very very tastey. Highly recommend this brew, especially for the price of $5.99/bottle. Just dont think its a stout..its more like a light porter or roastier/hardier brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really think this could have used some more sweetness. Not bad, but there are much better coffee stouts."
""
""
""
""
"O: I absolutely love Imperial Stouts, but this is not one of the ones that I would go back for. It is decent, but not great."
""
""
""

"Ridiculously drinkable for an imperial stout. The coffee flavor is very strong indeed, almost not even a beer! There is a touch of chocolate and vanilla too. Great balanced flavor. One is plenty because of the alcohol, but damn, Lagunitas knows what's up!"
"Review from 9/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a deep ruby amber. Minimal tan head with lacing.. Dark malt and chocolate aroma with a little coffee. Dark malt, coffee and chocolate with a light hop and coffee finish. A decent, well made stout, but not exciting enough for me to stay up all night from the caffeine."
""
""
"This is not what I would've expected from an imperial stout. The coffee flavors and aromas seem to be muted but it's still tasty. Not sure that I would spring for a bottle of this again."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A good winter beer."
""
""
""
"I think the outstanding aspect of this beer is how well the alcohol is masked. The other flavors are not blowing my mind per se but it's still a pretty solid beer. Gonna pair it with some chocolate on my second glass."
""
""
""
"This beer is a dark reddish-hued liquid. The head is light brown, foamy, but it quickly dissipates. The aroma is intense...malty, sugary, with notable roasted coffee scents underneath. The malt clearly stands in front of the coffee. Moderately sweet, some bitterness. Limited hop profile. The beer has low carbonation, but is also less full and robust than expected. It's a sweet, but balanced, bitter, slightly coffee'ed beer. Interesting, but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with a cm or two of head. Some dark malts and a lot of coffee in the nose. Taste is exactly what a coffe stout should be. You could warm this up and drink it in the morning and not know the difference. A little boozy on the finish. Very nice silky mouth feel. Overall I really enjoyed this one and wouldn't hesitate to buy it again when I'm in the mood for a coffee stout."
""

""
""
"O- Not really impressed at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2015 Update: Had this again and the pour produced a foamy 2-3 finger thick tan head that faded slowly and left great foamy lacing and rings as it went down. Tastes and smells like a very burnt Starbucks coffee, with a lot of charred notes and some rich cocoa and vanilla. Smooth and yet bitter at the same time, it was damn enjoyable again. I love coffee stouts and this always delivers."
""
""
""
""
"This stout falls apart all over. I'm really let down by this. What a shame."
""
"This one is really focused on the coffee which is as it should be in a coffee stout. It has a good balance in flavor and the aroma is simple but powerful. It’s like a Cuban coffee with alcohol, intense and enjoyable and not to mention affordable."
"O: A let down. I get very very little coffee/espresso in the nose or in the flavor. To even get it to come through I have to agitate the crap out of it. A muddled mess that could use lots of refinement."
""
""
"Pours a translucent dark brown with a quickly dissipating root beer head. Aroma is characterized by notes of chocolate, coffee, and tobacco barn. The flavors are unique, balanced, clever, and fun. Flavors of coffee and green olives make this a very interesting beer. That, combined with the creamy, viscous, appealing mouthfeel make this a magnificent beer. Lagunitas is hit and miss, but this is a success."
"poured a deep brown into a pint glass, 1/4"" tan head that stayed for a while. very sweet smells of milk, cocoa, coffee, vanilla bean, nuts, roasted grains. roasted coffee taste up front followed up by a sweet lactose taste. hints of vanilla bean and oatmeal. for being a 9% stout, it has no alcohol taste present, which is a very dangerous thing! a very creamy mouthfeel, full bodied with moderate carbonation. decent amounts of lacing too. this a damn near perfect stout overall. very flavorful, very pretty looking, very aromatic. there's barely anything to improve, aside from making the switch from a seasonal to year round!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was expecting a very full bodied and textured, coffee forward stout, Instead what I got was a shockingly thin bodied imperial stout with some slight notes of coffee. If this was a 5 percent Dry Irish Stout, fine, but when I try a 9% percent imperial stout, I don't want a thin, refreshing stout. I think with some tweaking in the malt bill this can be a very good stout."
""
""
""
""
"D - Very nicely done, this beer combines coffee with the rich sugary potential of a sweet stout in a very effective way. It finishes sweet, to the point that I would call it out as a flaw if it didn't somehow work so damn well. One of the best from a brewery that makes quite a few excellent brews."
"Overall: I enjoy all coffee stouts so I tend to grade these higher. This one is nicely complex and captures a nice coffee flavor while reducing the coffee bitterness."

"O -- One of my favorites. The newest edition doesn't disappoint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very dark. The head had a tan tint to it. I could smell coffee and chocolate, and I think a hint of malt. An amazing taste, a mix of coffee and malt with a roasty aftertaste. I think I picked up a little chocolate in there as well. No alcohol burn. The beer was very easy to sip, maybe a little too easy."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this is one of my favorite coffee stouts for a variety of reasons. I feel the smooth, somewhat sweet, character of the beer is unique to most coffee stouts. It also remains a true stout, where I feel most coffee infused brews fall a bit short and feel almost empty. If you are a coffee lover I strongly recommend this brew."
"O- I'll pass on this next time. I'm not impressed and I imagine in a few weeks' time I'll barely remember this beer. Much better offerings of coffee stouts may be had for a couple bucks more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Another treat from Lagunitas. ABV is very well hidden and this was very easy to drrink on a rainy afternoon."
"O-a steady imperial stout."
""

"O- a decent brew, perhaps it would have been better if I had drank it fresher, however it is not really all that old. Especially seeing as the hops are still noticeable. I feel like this brew needed more coffe, and a thicker body."
"Overall: A very nice Coffee Stout with a strong and robust body to support the added coffee. It really has its own flavour. The strong ABV is not overwhelming, although it is evident. I think the beer could managed with slightly less alcohol just fine. Great beer though!"
"Overall: Do you like Coffee? Check. Do you like Beer? Check! Combine the two and you get what you expect. A very well balanced Cappuccino Stout that is perfect as a breakfast companion, dessert pairing, or a stand alone. This one is buzz worthy!"
"D - Very drinkable. Really big and strong coffee flavors that really stand out, but still feel somewhat balanced and incorporated."
"D: Big coffee flavors and at $4.99 for the bomber it’s probably cheaper than Starbucks. Surprising amount of hoppiness. It works well without becoming harsh on the palate. The much lighter body is a bit of a letdown but does lend to a more accessible stout."
""
"T: Coffee, thick roastiness, smoke, and some unsweetened baking chocolate. Mouthfeel is really thick and way too syrupy. Not really a fan of this one."

"Taste-French roast coffee/cappuccino, citrus zest. Smooth and creamy. Alcohol not evident. Great character and coffee flavor. Highly recommended."
""
"Overall: my hopes were really dashed by the flavor here, since I like the aroma quite a lot. This is still a decent stout, but I don't think it lives up to what it could be."
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Smooth mouthfeel and silky coating. Perfect carbonation level. Great aftertastes of coffee and roasted malt."
"The coffee tones come out beautifully in the flavor however. Big burst of bold dark roast coffee both in the front and then again in the back with a balanced middle of dark roasted malts that complements the coffee very well. A touch of earthier hops helps bring a nice bitter taste in the back as well, but doesn't interfere with the coffee. There is a nice fullness to the flavor without being overly thick in the mouthfeel. It still has a nice heft to it, but its smooth as can be without being overly creamy. The two major flavor combinations do very well together making for an excellent coffee stout, even if it isn't very complex. Its very drinkable and at 9% ABV, thats saying something. Good beer here, I definitely recommend if you like coffee stouts."

""
"This is yet another Lagunitas beer that I have enjoyed. The brewery keeps earning more and more respect from despite the fact that I did not love the first offerings that I tried. The ABV in this one is hidden quite well."
""
"O: Very good brew from Lagunitas. Their brews always seem to be great and this is no exception."
""
"O - A very delightful coffee beer. The stout really helps accentuate the coffee in this beer and I think the two are at great levels. A lot of coffee beers you get either too much of one or the other and this beer has just nailed it. Definitely give this one a shot if you see it."
"This offers a lot of flavor and is easy to drink; not the best stout I have ever had, but very good."
""
""
""
"Overall - I like it. Its not balanced, but its still a pretty darn good stout. The flavors are what they're supposed to be, and nothing really rubs me the wrong way but the finish, which is a little bitter...and yet, its pretty mellow for this style of stout."
""
""
""
"Overall: Has a nice great BIG coffee flavor and aroma. Medium bodied with a great balance. This is a definite coffee lovers choice. Cheers."
""
""
"O: Easy to drink, refined coffee-stout with great mouthfeel. Limited bitterness given the substantial coffee component that leaves a lasting aftertaste. Excellent cold but improves with a bit of warming."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Most worthwhile for me is the warm belly and the nice alcohol rush this one exudes. Each element falls just short for me though."
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown beer with a tan, 2 finger head. Nice lacing. The aroma is coffee and chocolate. Flavor is coffee and dark chocolate with a touch of sweetness, possibly cream and sugar. The mouthfeel is on the thin side and the aftertaste dissapears quicker than I’d like. Too bad because it’s very good. I discovered this beer 6-7 years ago and seek it out every release. A good example of a coffee based beer."

"O- I think they may have gotten with your looking for in 'cappuccino', but I'd imagine this could be carried out to a greater effect. it's almost a good beer. I remember liking it more fresh. At 6 dollars its worth another shot."
""
"The beer is a medium bodied. With a thick chewy mouthfeel. Good balance and very easy to drink. I didn't think it was exceptional by any means but another solid offering from Lagunitas."
""
""
"Overall: I like this beer. I don't gawk and rave over every beer, and rarely ""dislike"" one, but this one is good for those that like stouts, but don't like a real sweet stout. Lacks the lactose in it, but has enough sweet to balance to big, bitter coffee taste to it. First lagunitas brew for me, and I'm impressed. I'd get more of this if I find it on draft at my growler place."
""
"O: Really good, best coffee stout I have had. Normally I do not like super bitter beers but the balance between the two types in this one makes it unique and doable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Highly disappointed. Don't even try it."
""
"Beer is medium to light in body, roasty up front and on the back end, mildly bitter, finishly cleanly and nicely, hides the alcohol well too. A decent coffee stout, you like coffee? You like stout? Drink this."
"Espresso beans are a big flavor in this beer. Thick and chewy. Grainy up front. Flavors are pretty well blended. Burnt coffee and espresso beans on the middle of the palette with a touch of cocoa powder. Tastes better than it smells. More subtle than it looks. Good but nothing outstanding. Good espresso flavor if your into that kind of thing."
"Mouthfeel:A light medium body with a creamy touch. It does a have some harshness on the finish"

"overall, didn't seem to be a very complexed brew IMO but it was still very good and easy to drink. will grab another bottle if i come across it."

"D: more of a big stout than a coffee stout. pretty disappointed on the ""cappuccino"" aroma/flavor."
""
"Great stout, coffee is pleasant and not overwhelming. Very smooth, some sweet characteristics to balance the coffee. great"
"O- 3.5"
"A more than decent coffee stout. Good value for the price"
""
"I didn't find this to be hugely intense as some imperial stouts may be (Night Tripper comes to mind). I found this to be very drinkable with a comparatively moderate body for a stout. The 9% ABV was well concealed. Smooth and silky in the mouth delivering the flavor and bitterness without astringent bite. Well done and a great value at $4.79."
""
"O: A very smooth and easy-drinking coffee stout, especially for such a big beer. Could maybe use a little less of the syrupy sweetness but it's still very good."
""
""
"This is a good simple coffee stout. It's not huge, it's not record breaking but I enjoy it. There are plenty of better coffee stouts out there but I'll still pick a bottle or two of this every year. Another quality and good value product from Lagunitas. "
""
""
""
"Another Lagunitas winner."
""
""
""
""
"O: Damn good beer, I'd like another, but first I'll be getting some Surly Coffee Bender and seeing how it compares."
"Overall- very impressed with this beer. Well balanced coffee style stout. Complex but very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Its good, but it isn't great. Although the coffee is there, it's quite hidden and overall complexity is lacking in the flavor category. I would certainly drink it again, but I would probably try to find a different coffee stout instead."
"Cheers!"
""
""
"All in all, a great stout that I thoroughly enjoyed."
""
""
""
""
"Disappointing for a big stout, but still a solid offering from Lagunitas."
"Cheers Go Giants!"
"Don't tell lagunitas, but I mixed this beer with boulevard chocolate ale and it tasted like I was drinking a dunkachino! I will be doing this until one of the kegs kicks :) cheers!"
""
"O: somewhat disappointing considering that it is a cappuccino imperial stout, there are much better examples of the marriage of coffee and stout, this one is okay"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I liked this, and it is what it advertised. It is not as likable as I want it to be, but it is pure in spirit. Worthy."
""
""
"Overall, this was one of the best beers I have had in a while. I will be buying more of this to drink."
""
"D - quite nice, better than I expected and I will be revisiting this one."
""
"O- Overall, this is definitely a middle of the road beer. I have to say that I am a big fan of Lagunitas, and I was expecting a little more out of this one. Im just not too comfortable with the flavor or the smell of the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I had a bad experience with this one in the past in a bottle, but I'm glad I tried it again on tap. Coffee stouts are generally my favorite style of beer, and while this isn't one of the best of them, it's worth a try, it's reasonably priced, and it would definitely be a good starting point for people who haven't had a coffee beer before."
"Overall - This is my 2nd go-around this this beer, the first being on New Year's Eve. I was a bit thrown off by expectations the first time; I'm now finding an appreciation for this Lagunitas offering that wasn't quite there in my initial voyage. Too bad they don't offer this in 6-pack form, because it's certainly one I'd grab occasionally in winter months."
""
""
""
"I do admit that the carbonation is somewhat lacking but otherwise, this is a solid coffee stout."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'd have to count this as a miss. Espresso/Coffee stout makes more sense as a title, as I didn't get any creaminess in the mouthfeel or flavor. The balance is off. The only thing I can't fault is the price ($4!)."
"The coffee used in this definitely gives a very unique character that I have yet to experience in another beer. As mentioned below, not in the same category as some of the top-rated Imperial Stouts, but in my opinion very enjoyable and well brewed. I wouldn't expect this beer to be enjoyed by everyone, but I found it quite nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- All in all a decent imperial stout, but it doesn't crack the upper eschelons of imperial stouts for me."
"Served from a 22 oz bomber into a bruery tulip. Comes out a dark brown soda color with a light brown head, about 3/4 inch thick. The head settles down quite quick. Smells like a nice milk chocolate with a light coffee flavor. Tastes is a little bit different. Not overwhelmingly like coffee but a nice balance. Light hop precense in the front palate. Alcohol is well hidden. Nice earthly malt balances out this beer quite nicely. Very nice mouthful. medium body with a dry aftertaste. Not too shabby. Overall this is a decent stout. It certainly didn't ""wow"" me, but is certainly worth a try. I will not be seeking this beer out in the future."
"Overall, this is a nice beer, and I wish it were a year round offering. Moreso, I wish it were a 12oz offering as the beer is good, but big, really big."
""
"A suprisingly ""meh"" beer from a good brewery in Lagunitas. Fairly disappointed in this one."
"I've enjoyed this beer more in the past than I have this time around. It's hot for under 9%, surprisingly fruity, and a bit misnamed; but it's a good brew. An enjoyable Imperial Stout that means business. Still worth seeking out."
""
"Poured into snifter. Not too impressive an appearance for the style, dark but not pitch black, slightly translucent with reddish tinge. Smell has milk chocolate, and a grassy quality. There's a sweet cream character, but not getting that coffee bean touch I expected. It all comes together on the palate. First noticed again is chocolate, mostly up front. But the coffee is definitely there, fresh coffee beans, almost a burnt flavor to it as well but rounded off by the sweetness of the chocolatey flavor. Worth a try, wouldn't spend more than $5 for a 22 oz of it though"
""
""
"O: At roughly 4 bucks a pop, a solid- above average limited release. I would expect a more complex coffee profile, since it's a Cappuccino stout, but I feel the abv may hinder some of those delicate coffee notes. More of an Imperial Porter in my buds; a quality beer regardless. B."
"This one's ok - not great. Bold for sure, but lacking tbe breadth and creaminess I like with stouts/coffee stouts."
"i got a bomber bottle at bevmo for ~3.50. it has been selling well and co-workers seem to like it. i'm not a fan of coffee, but i decided to give it a try. to me it tasted like firestone's velvet merlin with mocha. i'll have to go back to the velvet merlin, but it was really watery for a categorized imperial stout. however, the abv saves it. drink-ability is there, but impression fails to satisfy."
""
""
""

"Overall is an interesting stout. The coffee flavour is not over the top and works well with the rest of the flavours present. Really drinkable beer that I would happily drink again."

""
"Overall, another very enjoyable beer from Lagunitas."
""
"Overall it was pretty good, has a high 9% abv and was easy to drink. Interesting flavors that you dont/wont get from non craft beers, but not a refined gem. This beer is cheap and worth a shot! Its not a favorite of mine but I have no regrets, I drank the entire thing so it couldn't have been that bad."
""
"O: kinda on the sweet side and very much reminds me of soda, however it is still tasty and very drinkable. not bad."
""
""
"Pours a super dark brown color with a sliver of a cocoa head. Head disappears quickly. Average lacing on the side of my snifter. The nose is a touch on the weak side for me. Coffee, malt, hops, and some chocolate are there- but not strong enough to get a higher score. The taste, fortunately, is a step up. Big malt, hops and chocolate on the first part, gradually turning into coffee and hops on the end of the taste. Nice creamer/hops aftertaste. I'd actually like the malt to have more presence on the back side for a slightly higher rating. The coffee isn't actually that present in the taste of this beer, and it actually works well. A lot of bad coffee stouts out there. Overall, this is a good beer that's worth trying if you like the style. I tend to like their hoppy beer a bit better, but this is a solid offering. Cheers."

"This stout pours jet black with the most subtle garnet hue when held to a bright light. The head moderate light tan head diminished to a skim and left some lacing down the sides of the snifter. The aroma medium-high roasted malts, coffee, and maybe a bit ashy. The flavor is comprised of roasty malts, coffee, pleasant acidity. The finish is slightly dry with lingering coffee and maybe just a hint of the ABV. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and rather fully, with moderate carbonation. Overall a well made coffee stout, great flavors and very good feel to the beer. The bomber went down way too easy, I'll buy it again."
""
"O: Not a bad beer, but definitively my lease favorite Lagunitas offering I have had to date. It comes off as a one note beer to me. It delivers a nice coffee taste and that is about it."
"O: Very good. Get it if you can."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm completely confused on this one. The Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout is not very ""stout-ish"" nor very ""cappuccino-ish"". It's quite drinkable, and very smooth, but just not what I expected it to be. I'm going to have this one again soon, to make sure I'm giving it a fair shot."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good version of a coffee stout. Still has plenty of stout behind all that coffee. Recommended."
""
""
"A good coffee beer. Doesn't try to blast you in the face with coffee like FBS, but its a nicely balanced beer that I could see drinking at least once every winter, especially for the price. A good buy that won't disappoint."
""
""
"I like coffee as much as the next guy so give this one a go if you feel the same way"
""
"Mouthfeel is rich and quite creamy. Overall, Lagunitas presents you with a thoroughly enjoyable coffee stout that makes for quite a nice nightcap."

""
""
"Overall, a really nice coffee stout with one of a kind flavors. Really affordable and easy to get too. I really don't remember liking this so much. I'll get this again for sure."
""
"A sweet, malty body backs the whole thing up and it washes away cleanly at the end."
"Overall - These are really good flavors here, the balance and complexity here are nice, but it just all seems a bit lighter than it should for a 9% Imperial Stout, I expected bigger and bolder flavors here. The biggest coffee presence is actually experienced between sips, there is definitely a black coffee aftertaste going on. Glad I tried this, and I love Lagunitas offerings, but this may be my least favored so far. I like it, just don't love it."
"O-Good beer, nothing super special. Could be good with some aging. Wish the flavors would stand out a little more. Overall pretty decent."
""
"I had this in between 2 very tough beers to compete with Mikkeller beek geek B-fast and Founders B-fast Stout and the two biggest gripes I had in comparison were sweetness and mouthfeel. It pour on the slightly flat side, but did not feel flat at all. It felt a but watery especially for a near 9% beer. It was sweeter than the other two coffee stouts and the coffee flavor was weakest of the trio. It was too crisp for me. Maybe if I added sugar and half n half this might be a delicious frappuccino."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I can't say enough about this beer. I'm a huge coffee drinker, it's the only thing I drink besides beer, so to me this is a big friggin treat. If you are into coffee stouts or are into coffee and into beer you need to try this. It's well balanced and very easy to drink for a 9% brew. You don't need to meditate with this one in your mouth to pickup the highlighted flavor. I'd like to try the actual coffee they made this with. It would probably be one of the best cups I've ever had. Oh yeah, the price point on this is really good. I feel like I won when I bought this. Big daddy chuck would love this shit."
""
"Highly drinkable for almost 9%abv! I don't even realize that the bottle was half gone!"
"This is my first time rating, the motivator being disappointment. This beer did not live up to expectations. I’ll try to build my expertise and provide greater detail in the future. However, for now I’ll describe the front-end taste as being ok with a nice coffee hint. However, the finish just had something off about it, which I just can’t put my finger on."
""
"Poured aggressive into a 20 oz Duvel tulip glass. Pours a dark brown, with some light penetration. Big 3 inch tan head, that slowly settles, into a layer of bubbles with plenty of lace. Smell French vanilla coffee, toffee, brown sugar, and molasses, lacking a roastyness that I love in my stouts. Taste is creamy, much more my style than the smell. Coffee is more assertive in taste and much more real, the smell seemed like it was made from abstract. Body is a tad thin, nice carbonation, very drinkable, and lush not dry. This is a good stout."
""
"O: The price is right and the taste is spot on with the name. I enjoy this a lot, it's definitely a beer for coffee drinkers. I highly recommend this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not a bad beer...not the best, but I enjoyed it"
"This is a rich, smooth stout with a solid, complex flavor. This is well worth the $5 that I paid for the bomber."
""
""
"My trepidation level was in the orange, at least, for this offering, when I considered this brewer's predilection for amping any and all shit up. Turns out, the coffee is just a nice side player, for a big, chocolaty, tempered booze beast of an American stout. An ironically good, stiff swig, before I go watch the Canadians put the Yanks out of their self-inflicted misery at the WJHC here in Edmonton, and then on to the Headstones' NYE 2012 show. Boo to the fuckin' ya!"
""
"O: Overall I thought this was a very solid beer. It's not as up-front as say Southern Tier's Mokah, but it's still really good. I'd buy it again."
""
" Overall this is right up my alley as coffee infused beers are my favorite! And that is exactly what this is.Very straight forward and to the point."
"The mouthfeel is about average for the style with carbonation being moderate. Overall I loved this beer and I can't believe it's taken me this long to try it. I loved how smooth and drinkable it was while also having so much flavor. The cappuccino flavors really stood out to me in it and helped give it a little something different in comparison to all the other coffee beers out there. The aroma didn't really impress me that much, but the taste really blew me away. At only $5 a bomber this is one I'm going to buy more of for sure."

"Overall: Good beer great coffee flavor. Well done."
"O- Having developed a liking for Lagunitas, this was a disappointment for me. Sat on for quite awhile. Perhaps not stored properly?? However, having said that...I could see through this brew. Again, too thin for a stout."
"Love Lagunitas, finally got around to trying this one. Pours a brownish red color. Aroma is of faint coffee. Taste is medium to heavy bodied, great mouthfeel to it. Nice hop taste on the tough, roasted coffee comes through strong, lots of roasted malts come through as well. Delicious beer, tons of taste and hides the ABV well. Glad I gave it a go, try it out for a good beer,"
"A good buy."
"Interesting beer. Not your typical coffee stout. With a name like ""Cappucino"" you expect a lot of milky creaminess and rounded, smooth coffee character. The coffee you get here is more a black roasted espresso flavor. Not much sweetness either. And frankly the roasted aspect isn't particularly strong when compared with other coffee stouts. It tastes good, though, and is worth a shot at the (usual) Lagunitas low price."
"Lagunitas beverages are usually big. Most I've reviewed have been something big and bold and wonderful and lingering. What we have here is a plate of pancakes with molasses all over and no butter. Smell was a little less that stellar, advertising winey and raisin notes, not coffee. Appeared as good as any quality stout. Little lace. Little light came through. Mouth is sweet, syrupy, with raisin and alcohol. Taste: see above. Actually, where's the coffee? The burnt malt and hops really don't make this all that bitter and maybe there's a hint of coffee in the back but it's muted. Overall, a really tasty imperial with a lasting sappy flavor."
"This pours a dark brown almost black color, but it lets a bunch light through, it has a large tan head which dissipates down to a film which remains for a long time. The smell is of coffee, espresso with a little roasted malts. The feel is medium. The taste is of espresso, a little dark chocolate, and some roasted malts. Overall this is a pretty good stout."
"Overall, a really good, almost great, stout. All the flavors played well together, and you know what you're getting from the way it smells. Also pretty darn good with fried chicken. Enjoy."
"Overall: A very good take on a coffee beer. Somewhat light bodied for a stout but very full flavored."
"O: this one may have spent a bit too much time in my fridge, but it has all the hallmarks of a very good beer still. Very well crafted if down a little on flavor from sitting in the fridge for awhile."
"There are coffee and chocolate flavors/smells, as well as hints of caramel flavor. It's a sweet, malty brew ... delicious!"
"Overall-Like I always say, for the price and quality you can't ever go wrong with Lagunitas. With the intention of this being a coffee stout it definitely fit the mold, just a little bit boring after 12oz."
"O: Very drinkable and I think some age would definitely help. A small sipper for an Imperial Stout. Would score higher with a better mouthfeel."
"O: A delicious 8% stout at 4 duckets per 22 oz'z...whats not to love?"
"O-This a great stout. I like this very much. Super drinkable for 8.8% ABV. Can barely taste the alcohol. I'd definitely get this one again."
"Overall a very good beer... it is a ""Limited Release"" too so if you see it you should definitely try it."
"Overall this beer is very good, but I'm afraid it will be a bit polarizing to non-coffee hounds. I happen to think it's yet another big hit for Lagunitas."
"M - Thick and chewy like a good stout should be. Possibly over-bright carbonation that makes some of the flavors seem a little too sharp for my liking."
"O: Great coffee-flavor stout. It wasn't too heavy for a summer evening and not too complex that it was overwhelming. Style wise, I think they did a good job. Would definitely get this again."
"O. This is a pretty decent beer. It's nothing mind blowing. Tastes like a lot of similar coffee stouts. No extreme accents that made it stick out. It's a beer worth trying, because Lagunitas makes some very fine beers. However I wouldn't go out of my way to find it."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. I'd definitely recommend this, especially if you're a coffee lover (which I'm not). Another solid offering from Lagunitas."
"special credit to this beer for being from CALIFORNIA!!!"
"O: A beer I enjoyed drinking, but am not sure will have again soon since many others from this same variety remain more memorable."
"VERY GOOD, GET THIS!"
"O-I never drink coffee, I drink the stuff maybe twice a year if that but i really enjoyed this brew. I would drink this on a nice cold night to warm me up, would definitely buy again to sip and relax..."
"O: Very decent beer. Although for a Imperial Stout it doesn't really live up to the style. Would be a great regular stout or top notch coffee stout, but just don't fit here. For $4.99 a bomber I would buy again though."
"Cheers!"
"O: I like coffee stouts, but this is not for me. It is overly bitter and lacking balance. I may try this again when they do the release later this year."
"Thick one finger head of light brown, with solid clinging lace. The color matches a 33 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is rich and full with aromas of chocolate, coffee, molasses, malt, and vanilla. Taste is bold and robust with flavors of coffee, coco, molasses, vanilla, and malt. Mouthfeel is very full and creamy, with a bit of a bite on the back of my tongue. This beer has good taste, lots of character, and a reasonable price. I will have another."
"Overall, a pretty good stout. Strong coffee flavors, with little bite of alchohol. Definitely worth a shot for those who like this style of stout."
"Overall: I like it, not as much as their imperial stout, but for $4 a bomber it’s hard to say no. It also went very well in a batch of brownies my girlfriend made."
"This pours very dark brown with a nice tan head. There is some lacing and retention, but not a lot. The smell is strong caramel and sweet coffee. The taste is very dark and toasty. I would even call it woodsy and smoky. There is a heavy body here that limits your intake, and the syrupy sweetness also doesn’t help the drinkability. This is a solid stout, but not my usual style."
"D- Overall, a fantastic brew. The ingredients are expertly paired, and meld together to create a unique flavor that is Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout."
"Another quality stout from Lagunitas though another stout of theirs that isn't heavy enough for my liking. A coffee stout that I like."
"Overall this is a nice, easy to drink American Double stout that was a great value for the price. I'd be happy to recommend this one for coffee stout lovers anytime."
"O - Good beer for those who prefer dark coffee stouts, but leaves a little to be desired."
"O-Very good stout. Good use of the coffee, and surprisingly easy to drink. Not the best Imperial Stout i have had but definitely one i am happy i tried."
"Pours a semi-opaque dark brown with a 2 inch tan head that fades to a thin cap. Fat rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smells of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and espresso grounds. Taste is of rich dark chocolate covered espresso beans and roasted dark malts. A slight cocoa/espresso bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a bit of a thin body with a good level of carbonation that makes for a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good coffee/espresso infused stout from Lagunitas. I tried a bottle of this a while back and I didn't like it from what I remember but this bottle was very good. For the price this is a great beer and an easy decision to make when you want a tasty brew for little money."
"Overall pretty tasty, just a little light in the mouthfeel"
"D - I really like this, well balanced very tasty. Leaves a nice coffee/chocolate finish"
"O: This is a nice, tasty stout from lagunitas. I honestly feel like I've had a cappuccino after a couple sips of this. Will buy again."
"This is a good beer. It's what you want in a coffee beer even if you don't like coffee (I'm not a coffee drinker unless it's in beer), just notes of it, nothing drastic."
"Try it on tap, if you can."
"Overall- I’m not sure if this is a stout or an ale, for a stout there is not a whole lot going on, but for an ale it has nice flavours although coffee really dominates all aspects of this one. For coffee lovers this would be an amazing brew for you, but for me this fell a little short of what I was expecting this to be. I would have liked to see more of a sweet cappuccino taste as opposed to the strong almost bitter coffee grinds taste that I got out of this one. All in all a more average brew that I would definitely not go out of my way to acquire, but at the cheap five dollar price point for a bomber it is a good bang for your buck and a higher ABV well hid by all the coffee flavours."
"O: This is a stout for people who drink their coffee as a shot of espresso. There is no creamy flavors or textures. Its pretty good"
"Overall - I was surprised by the taste. The smell was very underwhelming but the taste was spot on. Pretty good beer"
"If Lagunitas ever needs a Canadian ambassador for their brands, I'm officially calling dibs. Consider me the regional president of the fan club. This brewery seems to turn out nothing but winners and, although their specialty lies in making uber-hoppy offerings, this coffee stout is a respectably solid delve into the dark side and is every bit on the level with their usual standards of quality, value and delicious quaffability."
"Super dark brown. Almost black. Very thick with a nice creamy head that fades fast but leaves nice lace. The smell is of roasted coffee, sweet malts, caramel, dark chocolate, and toffee. Earthy citrus peeks through and some dark fruit notes are in there as well. The taste is of sweet malty honey and caramel with a good dose of roasted coffee, char, and a touch of smoke. Good earthy notes througout with a touch of citrus. An overall good and easy to drink stout."
"O- A great beer, one of the better coffee flavored stouts I've had, the flavors all work very well together and the 8.8% ABV is nearly invisible."
"Overall, what we liked most about this brew was how bold the coffee aroma and flavoring was. Of the two the nose produced the most robust aspect of tasting, with bold coffee bean scents crashing throughout, but not overwhelmingly so. The tastes followed through nicely, and this brew stayed true to its name, with a bold coffee kick, and a smooth creaminess, just like a proper cappuccino should be."
"Overall very easy to drink and has a complexity to the flavors that I like"
"Light vanilla & coffee notes. Very subtle. Pours what appears to be a jet black with tannish head. A woody, oaky like flavor with light, subtle espresso notes deem this one a very likable beer. The ABV seems nonexistent. Wish this was served larger than the snifter it came in. Very impressed. A very nice beer once again from this very solid brewery."
"poured into a pint glass a dark dark brown almost black. had a one finger khaki colored head that quickly disappeared. smells of strong burnt slightly smokey coffee. tastes like it smells with sweet malts. mouthfeel is thin (i like my stouts thicker) good carbonation and goes down easy. worth every penny."
"overall - good example of style, not great - but a solid brew."
"O) Price shouldn't be an issue when rating a beer, but it's unavoidable to not mention the fantastic value this (and other) Lagunitas brews are. There are many better coffee stouts, but this one is no slouch in the category, and the fact that it remains much more reasonably priced, it makes it a happy addition to my shopping cart whenever I am in the mood for a coffee stout."
"O: All in all, this is a decent beer. Lacks in the first few departments, but excels in taste. Definitely try if you like coffee and stouts!"
"overall - it has its moments, the body could be pumped up and the alcohol/bitterness subdued, but it's okay overall"
"Pours a very dark brown with a small tan head. Smells of coffee and dark chocolate with earthy undertones. Mouthfeel is very light with slight carbonation. The taste is not what I expected. I can taste the dark chocolate and almost a date or fig flavor. I taste a trace amount of coffee on the finish, but not that of my expectations. Still a very nice beer that I will have again."
"O - A very tasty brew. Just a great blend of all sorts of items that go well into making a stout."
"22oz bottle. Pours a dark, dark brown color with a thin layer of tan head. Strong aroma of cappuccino/coffee. Somewhat earthy but mostly a big wallop of coffee beans. Smells strong. Big cappuccino taste. Roasted malts, somewhat sweet with a bitter dark coffee aftertaste. Maybe a bit of vanilla or cream perhaps. Not too boozey but its a heavy mouthfeel and lots of coffee flavor so this one will take awhile to finish. Doesn't really have the typical Lagunitas big hoppy and sweet flavors, although it is somewhat sweet. Overall its a solid choice. I may be interested in aging one to see if it mellows out the big coffee taste. I will look for this again."
"Lagunitas is making quality stouts??? Huh? They actually executed this one quite well, but I wouldn't call it a stout based on the look and flavor. Perhaps ""Dubbel Cappucino"" would've suited this better."
"O/D - Pleasently drinkable... being that it is of a lower ABV for its class... i would have to say it makes it that much more drinkable in a sense that you CAN drink more then one. roasted to perfection, i would want to take this to work with me in my mug anyday..."
"Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout pours with a black colour and a 1cm tan head that lasts well. It smells very malty with some coffee character. The taste is malty and roasty into a more bitter coffee flavour. The aftertaste is charcoal and coffee flavour. It has a delicious milky mouthfeel. Overall, a lovely beer, but the bitterness and charcoal build a bit too much."
"O- great beer for a great price, i will revisit this again for sure."
"Pours a surprisingly light brown for an imperial stout. A bit of nice off-white frothy head. Smells incredibly coffee heavy a touch of malt on the back of the nose but overpowered by coffee smells. Tastes similar. A bit thin for my taste but a very solid coffee flavour. Overall not too shabby"
"Overall, Cappuccino Stout is another solid offering from the folks at Lagunitas. It's a rung below FBS and Wake & Bake, but still a nice coffee stout. Worth seeking out if you like the style."
"Notes: Overall a solid coffee stout with a good blend and balance of flavor."
"Poured a very dark brown color with a small amount of beige head on it. Smells of heavy chocolate and coffee. Taste is about the same. Very Strong tasting, not bad though. Strong coffee flavor upfront with a bitter chocolate finish. Very syrupy heavy mouthfeel. Pretty good beer overall. I've never had an imperial stout before, but this one was a good one to try."
" Overall, this is was a decent brew but not one that I would go after again."
"D - Coffee beers are amongst my favorites and this one is quite well executed... Doesn't excel in any on category, but well above average in all facets... Lagunitas continues to churn out solid beer after solid beer and this one is no exception..."
"Overall this beer is great and very tasty. I could really drink a lot of this one. The label says limited release but I see it all over the place here in San Diego. I imagine they may be referring to the coffee that is being used for this batch. Maybe they will use another blend the next time. If you like coffee stouts then pick one of these bad boys up, or would it be dog because of label. In that case pick up one of these good bad dogs up. Your mouth will thank you."
"Notes: The cappuccino tastes don't take the central role that they should. The flavors here don't mesh together well. They clash and leave the palate confused and wanting. The thin body did not impress me either. Not absolutely terrible, but I won't be buying this one again."
"O: Not really the best coffee flavor and not a terribly good base beer either."
"The beer pours a deep mahogany, the head tall and tan with good lacing and retention. Nose is malty with notes of coffee, nuts and peach. Taste is malty sweet with a mild fruitiness. Finish is burnt coffee, hops delectable in their spiciness, very dry with a modest acidity, a thick and tongue coating aftertaste lasts long. A fine sturdy stout. Well blended."
"PROST!!!"
"MF: Creamy without being too over-the-top with its coffee or chocolate flavors."
"M/O - The mouthfeel is slightly thin and not as creamy as I would have liked. A harsh bitter aftertaste and the mouthfeel keep this beer from being fantastic, but still a decent brew."
"Pours dark brown. Has a fantastic brown head with awesome retention. Nice amount of lacing as well. Smells very toasty and coffee like. Lots of roasted malts and graininess up front with a slight sourness in the background, along with a bit of alcohol. Very straight forward and aromatic. Taste is mostly of roasted coffee and sugar. There are hits of vanilla and chocolate as well. Finish is toasty and has a bitter chocolate aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit thick with moderate carbonation. Very smooth and velvet like. Sits soft on the palate. Very nice mouthfeel. All in all its a very tasty coffee stout. Although a bomber is as much as I can have. Its high in flavor and alcohol. At 8.8 ABV. Im planning on picking up another bottle. 5.59 a bomber is a damn good price. I love Lagunitas price points. There quality is top notch as well."
"A dark brown with some orange highlights and a toffee coloured creamy head. Great nose for a stout. Its all about the espresso and molassess. The taste is coffee and terrific with a nice sweet start and a bitter finish. There is a bit of smokey and boozy flavours to accentuate the roasted malts and esters. The mouthfeel is very creamy with a low level of carbonation. The alcohal is well hidden and all I have left to say is yum! Not only is this a really good stout but as it turns out, makes a nice midmorning breakfast drink."
"Wasn't wild about this beer, for an imperial stout it seems so light. I had a more robust beer in my mind. I didn't have a very clear palate at the time, so maybe that's to blame. However, I am thinking not, there is light notes of cappuccino and a bit of malt, other than that, not much came through to me."
"Pours a very dark brown almost black color with a nice one finger khaki colored head which gives way to some nice lace. The aroma is of coffee with a slight hint of sweetness. The taste is the same a big coffee taste, but the taste has a nice sweetness to it, maybe malt or vanilla. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall it is a very solid beer, the sweetness to it, cuts the coffee enough that it keeps you very interested. The abv is also very well hidden."
"O: Overall it is not a bad beer just okay. I liked giving it a try but and not sure if I would buy another."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I'd expect, but is otherwise solid, and the drinkability is quite good. This is just a pretty good stout. Nothing to search out, but a bottle isn't anything close to a bad thing. Worth the low price it commands for sure."
"O- it's fine. I've had better. But it's not bad."
"Overall - A really nice treat of a stout. Mild and very easy to enjoy. Couldnt realize by drinking it was 8.8%. A glass or two is fine. A real winner here, cant wait to try in a bottle."
"Mmmm as the name states cappuccino it is a very smooth and lite a froothy taste. A small alcohol numb is on the tongue. It taste great and the bitter finish typical with coffee beer is drownd in a sweetness."
"Pours a nice thick dark color with a light tan head. Very quickly dissipating though which was a bit of a let down as I generally prefer my stouts to have that thick long lasting head. The smell caught my attention immediately and gave me some notes of a dark roasted coffee to start with. The first sip hits you hard with the coffee but then rounds off to the malt side of this beer. Malt flavors of chocolate, molasses, and some light fruitiness keep it fairly well balanced. The carbonation may be a touch to much on this one though but not to the extent of ruining this beer. Overall it is a great brew and I look forward to buying this one again for sure."
"Overall: The body of the beer is thick and the finish is full. This beer has a lot going on it it. There is flavors all over the palate. A very good beer nonetheless a little unbalanced."
"Pours a deep brown with reddish highlights and about two fingers of beige foam with very good retention. Aroma of rich caramel, dark fruit, and a bit of roasted malts, not much ""stout"" going on in the nose. Flavor of smooth and lightly roasted malts, some dark fruits, and rather light velvety smooth coffee flavor. Nice smooth finish. This is better than the Imperial Stout From Lagunitas. This seems to have nice Balance between the Hops, Chocolate, and Coffee."
"Just cracked this Cappuccino stout... an amazing beer I must say,it poured great, and had a thick head on it an pretty decent lace. This beer did not taste like a cappuccino at all, however it gave great notes of roasted coffee beans, mochoa, dark chocolate,vanilla, a bit of charcoal, with a silk alcohol flavor at the end. The beer wasn't very drinkable at first.... until the second gulp. By far another great beer by Lagunitas."
"Although this is a cappuccino (coffee) double stout you could confuse it with a chocolate stout due to its smell and taste. So I decided to have a slice of chocolate cake to go with it and man did they pair nicely. The sweetness of the cake cut into the roasty bite."
"D: Beer tastes fine but the mouthfeel held it back big time."
"D - This is a really good coffee stout. Actually one of the best coffee beers I've ever had."
"I am pleasantly surprised by this one...I'm going to have to get a few more bottles to share with friends!"
"D: Fairly drinkable, though the heavier flavors don't work particularly well with the higher carbonation."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly high for such a high abv beer (9.26%). This is very smooth with no sharpness or unpleasant edges."
"Lagunitas does make a nice assortment of beers. This is a good coffee stout. Dark as pitch with a caramel head. Smelled like... well.. coffee and caramel. Taste was as you would expect, bold but not overwhelming coffee flavor mixed with a hint of caramel. The mouthfeel was quite smooth and long. Easily drinkable if you are in the mood for the style."
"On the other hand that thinner character improves the drinkability of this beer. Very little detectable alcohol."
"However, I gave a few charity points for a decent mouthfeel with some chewiness and the ample carbonation makes it perfectly drinkable - but nothing earth-shattering."
"This beer is what it says it is: a coffee stout. It executes that well. I am buying more tomorrow."
"[After drinking this again recently (February 2012), I dropped my taste rating from a 5 to 4.5. But I still think it's an excellent coffee stout, and one of the best I've had.]"
"Pours a barely see-through, deep brown. A bold, tan ring washes the glass with foam. Smell is dense and earthy, dark malts taking over on a leaf-litter bed. First feel is melatonin-inducing smoothness, with an alcoholic edge and a tight, coffee bean flavor. Finishes tannic and bitter, like a shot of cappuccino appropriately. Drinks good, but can tell this is a *heavy* beer. Darn tasty."
"D- The coffee is aspect is certainly part of the body, but the brewers seem to have elements of a milk stout to give this brew a frothiness I have not experienced outside of the milk stout average. I would definitely like to have this beer again."
"Fuller medium body, higher carbonation, decent creaminess, a bit chewy. Definitely drinks pretty quickly, and the alcohol is masked really well for almost 9%. This is essentially on par with other Lagunitas beers, but isn't anywhere near delicious as FBS or WnB."
"Pours black with a thin, light mocha head. Very faint aroma, but it has notes of dark-roast coffee, chocolate roasted malt, and some faint hops. Taste is mildly bitter slightly charred malt and coffee. not much from the hops except a slightly green aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit astringent but fairly smooth for a heavier stout. Could be much more drinkable as the flavor just isn't really appealing for a heavier stout due to the lack of bold flavors."
"This is a nice stout, does not have the dry finish lthat I like in a stout, however, this is a nice enjoyable beer."
"Tasty but not really a sipper, this is very worthwhile. Lagunitas strikes again."
"Good drinkability at the ABV. Good taste too. Overall recommended and killer at its price point."
" Cheers , Matt"
"Overall a slightly above average beer, lacks any depth beyond the cappuccino. To me this is more like a dark brown beer that has coffee flavor then a stout. Would like to see more body and balance to this beer."
"As a coffee lover, this beer is right up my alley. The aromas of coffee and chocolate complement the beer extraordinarily well."
"D - smooth going down, but flavors a little too muted for me to be really interesting except for the cream; perfectly fine, but doesn't wow me"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is jet black, with a slight tan-biege head that starts out around an inch but slowly recedes to a thin film of head. There are extremely heavy coffee ground smells, specifically the grounds after the coffee has been brewed. Smells delicious. The beer is initially nondescript in mouth when you first take a sip. It lingers for a second, and then BAM! you get the coffee flavors. Bitter, dark, roasted coffee, with a slightly sweet, malty backbone that does well to balance the flavor without influencing it too much. If you like coffee, you are going to love this beer. I hate coffee, and I actually like this beer. The beer is a bit on the dry side, and crisp, which goes well with the flavor characteristics. The aftertaste is all coffee, and despite the body, the finish lingers for a bit in mouth, just like a cup of coffee will. It never overpowers, despite the strong flavors and the lingering finish. Very easy to drink, and great on a cold night when the wind is a whippin. Very decent stout."
"If I didn't love coffee this would have been a complete loss for me."
"D: The booziness hampers the drinkability."
"D - I would only recommend one or two of these because...really...who drinks a lot of coffee stouts at one time? Also this beer is 8.8 % in a 22 oz, so it takes a toll as a heavier beer."
"Drinkability: This is fairly mild beer, whether reviewing it as an Imperial Stout or as a Coffee Ale, as even the just over 5% Surly Coffee Bender has more flavor and complexity. That said, it does have a nice flavor, is very easy to drink, and (similar to all Lagunitas brews) masks its high alcohol very well."
"D: A solid beer. Not enough secondary flavours to keep me really interested, but at $4.50 a bomber, it's very inexpensive in the style, so worth a pick up for the coffee fan. Not really my cup of tea with the overt bitter coffee flavours, but I can see the appeal."
"Notes: very easy-drinking stout. not as robust or intense as many."
"Conclusion: As a non-coffee/cappuccino drinker, I would have to rate this as my favorite coffee-inspired product above coffee ice cream. Lagunitas provides an excellent brew which rates high among my favorite stouts."
"D: Jeez for ~9% alcohol and a few bucks this is definitely drinkable. It can be drunk slowly or gulped down since the flavors are not too complex and the bitterness is toned down. Really for the price point and compared to other Imperial Stouts, this is a solid buy. It's not the best IS ever, but certainly one of the best price/quality stouts."
"D - This isnt a bad stout, no, but its just a little off for me. Getting more of the bitter notes of coffee than the aromatic qualities. The carbonation also throws this one off for me. Perhaps with some aging it would get creamier but right now, I'd rather have a different one."
"A good beer and worth drinking, but does not live up to the expectations of it's name."
"D- Seems to fall apart in the second half. Really a tough beer to drink if you take the time to think about it. The flavors aren't that great, the feelings are nothing amazing, and it just feels like a lackluster attempt at a commonly loved style. I guess I'd have to say I'd never drink it again."
"Taste alright, but a little too watery and too much carbonation."
"A very good West Coast-style stout. Makes me proud to be born in CA/the West Coast."
"D: A delicious brew at an appealing price... 4.39 paid for the bomber. A little light on the coffee, but it is functional, adding complexity to the beer's natural flavors rather than masking them. Worth a shot!"
"D: Unpleasant mouthfeel and not very good taste make this a pretty undrinkable beer. Lagunitas is normally solid, but this is definitely a miss for them."
"Cappuccino Stout literally made me think I was drinking an alcoholic iced coffee. The wonderful smells of vanilla and coffee were present. The appearance was dark and opaque. Once in the mouth, Cappuccino Stout was creamy and chewy. Coffee was the most obvious taste- a concentration similar to espresso, with the light sugary hints of cream and sugar. Very drinkable! Enjoyed this one quite a bit..."
"Overall: Not my favorite from Lagunitas. This tastes like a sugar and cream-less Irish coffee. It's big, ugly and tough to finish. Maybe it needs a few years to mellow, but right now its not for me. Try Two Brothers ""Red Eye Porter"" if you need a espresso/black beer fix."
"The drinkability isn't bad. You could rock a few of these, but you could possibly get tired of them after 2 or 3."
"D- Its a heavy beer, and that bitter coffee flavor is pronounced (makes since its a coffee stout) But it could be blended better, to make it more stout than cappuccino. If you are looking for a pronounced coffee beer than this will do great."
"Pours a very deep red/brown/black that light can just barely penetrate with a khaki head that fades and little lacing. On the nose it lacks the very astringent, day-old coffee note that kills Bell's Java Stout and Dark Horse Perkulator for me, so that's a plus. It's actually a pretty subtle nose for a coffee stout. Obviously coffee is present but it's deep down, among vanilla and other stuff. The Bros mentioned blood oranges, and I think I get that, too. It's a subtle bouquet but it's a very good one. On the tongue the coffee stands out more than on the nose and the other stuff gets lost a bit, but there is a hop presence that makes itself known. In the mouth it isn't a huge bodied beer and there is a nice prickly, carbonation + coffee + slight alcohol effect that lingers. It's pretty drinkable for a big stout. I'm a pretty big fan and at the price I'm not sure it can be beaten."
"D-Not a bad stout but not one I would go out of my way to purchase or recommend."
"D: Very drinkable thats why I am moving on to my second."
"At the end, I did enjoy this Cappuccino Stout. Not at the top of my list, but something you need to try"
"Really enjoyed this beer, could barely detect the alcohol. Coffee was pretty solid, but there were some off notes that i detected. I'd be curious as how they added the coffee in this beer."
"Good day, neighbor."
"D - Extremely. This is a crazy drinkable stout for and ABV of 9 plus."
"D: Nice and smooth, the alcohol is present but definitely drinks below its weight. Doesn't fill me up like the stouts I'm used to, which is nice for a change."
"Very drinkable, reliable flavor. A sippable session beer can stand on its own."
"Overall: i was excepting more of a cappuccino sweetness from this beer. So i was dissapointed. Still a tasty beer for those who love coffee stouts, lacking complexity to me. Maybe they could rename it coffee stout."
"D - The drinkability is good. Its great tasting and easy to drink. Its a good beer for the winter time. I think it would be much better though if it had more body to it. Overall, I think this is a good beer, and I'd try it again."
"edit: after drinking more of this beer from the bottle, I can't finish it. The things that seem off, intensify as you drink more of it and I just didn't enjoy it anymore."
"Shared with my Pop. Pours a shade or two lighter than black, has some mahogany edges. Head was two fingers thick and lasted for some time. Interestingly enough, did not have a huge aroma, really subdued. I expected a big coffee presence. Taste was huge however. Big cappuccino up front, with a little char, just enough sweetness and some bitter notes at the end. Mouthfeel was a bit thin for this style. This stout hides the 9% rather nicely making this a drinkable beer. Thumbs up!"
"D- Drinkability is high. This is both good and bad. I expected more of this cappuccino stout in terms of depth and flavor, but in retrospect it was nice, smooth, and easy. I would have one again, but would not pay a premium."
"Drinkability: It wasn't hard to drink, but not something I feel a need to repeat. It smells good."
"D-This is not a bad beer. And, it did provide the needed relief from a very discouraging day at work. But, it is not remarkable in any appreciable way, except good ABV for the money."
"Everything about this beer is thin. It appears much thinner than even a ""regular"" stout, let alone an 8.8 percent stout. It looks almost like a brown ale rather than a stout. The smell is truly the best part of the beer. It smells thinly of cappucino and generic malt, however the cappucino/coffee aroma is strong enough to make the smell generally pleasant. The problem with the taste of this beer is that all of it's flavors are too weak. Stronger taste of roast/malt, hops, or coffee/cappucino would make this a much better example of a strong coffee stout. As it stands, all three of these major style flavors come across evenly and weakly. Because of weak flavor, thin mouthfeel, and boring taste, this is a barely drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: I'm kinda of dumbfounded by this beer. Call it am imperial coffee brown ale and I'll bump up my appearance and mouthfeel on this one. Overall at $5 not a bad beer, but the mouthfeel just makes it a bleh beer. Would try again, as the nose and taste were really good."
"D - It was a drinkable beer, but one I doubt I'll pick up especially as a gift. A little to much coffee flavor, but what should I expect from a cappuccino stout. Just not my thing I guess."
"Drinkability -- For a coffee-infused stout, this manages to stand apart from the crowd: no small feat. The lighter body and classic Lagunitas hop profile give this some serious personality in an overcrowded niche. That said, It's not my favorite. However, this still proves that a bomber of Lagunitas is always a good bet."
"Cheers!"
"On tap at Cambridge Common. I was hoping for a big, warm Something to finish off a meal on a frigid Sunday night, something that would launch me into my work week in a happy, malty mood. Alas, I should have known better to go with Lagunitas, a West-coast brewery that invests more in label copy than beer. Although a suitable color for a stout, it's got very little aroma beyond some light chocolate and a peas. The taste is loaded-- *loaded*-- with old coffee grounds. Not even good coffee grounds, but the kind from the Bunn-O-Matic you used to operate in your high-school job at a Ponderosa Steak House; the kind that have been sitting around for hours, drying out and getting sour. Also making a cameo appearance is... lettuce. Unless that's a flavor you value in beer, pass on this one."
"FourthBeer potential: ABOVE AVERAGE. The similarity to coffee could make this a good closer, but the hidden alcohol might make that a bad idea, and there are certainly more complex stouts out there."
"Big on coffee but not a very good stout. I like my stouts pitch black and thick as motor oil. This one wasn't. Or maybe this is a bad bottle. . . .???"
"Poured semi-aggressively giving a royal 2-finger head, reduces to a strong 1-finger head, very impressive sticky lacing, color is basically black...can't see anything in the light. Aroma of perfectly roasted coffee, a touch of super dark chocolate, on a bed of dark malts. Taste of super fresh coffee, and maybe a touch of sweetness....not sure if lactose is in play here. This is the best balanced coffee-beer I've ever tasted by far. I love coffee black, and this is the beer version. Full of win."
"Final Notes: A very unimpressive Imperial Stout: light and somewhat watery. It would make a great session beer if they toned down the alcohol, but for the American IS style, it's just not there."
"(2011 vintage)"
"Note: This beer does not age well in my experience. Loses the coffee and picks up an unpleasantly strong raisin-y taste."
"Had this at a beer tasing. Pours a small frothy tan head which dissipates to slight tan lacing. Smells of black coffee beans, touch of sweet graininess. Tastes of acrid black coffee, touch of espresso, some lingering bitterness on the finish. Medium bodied, light carbing. Kind of hard to finish a small tasting. The acidity is that killer here. $8 a bomber."
"Drinkability is good, with the lighter mouthfeel actually making it easy to quaff. The coffee taste is there too, albeit in a very tempered way. It's not very complex, but it's still got some good flavor behind it. A solid and affordable coffee imperial stout from Lagunitas."
"This beer poured black with a decent tan head. It had a bitter coffee aroma which was very nice. The taste was very similar to the aroma with some added sweetness thrown in. This was a full bodied beer. Overall it was enjoyable, but not anything special. Good, but not great. It was a coffee stout, nothing more, nothing less."
"When I think of buzz beer on the drew carey show I imagine it tasted just like this. The beer pour coffeish color with a tan head, the smell was smokey and sweet like a sugar sweetened coffee. The beer was bitter sweet with a finish of coffee, it wasn't overwelming just enough to set it appart from other beers, it wasn't the most intense coffee beer but drinkability wise it was very much a drinker"
"D - Moderately drinkable, but I won't get this again. Not a bad beer, just not what I'm looking for."
"the mouthfeel is surprisingly light for an imperial stout, and not really that close to the style, but this is a delicious beer, and extremely drinkable, definitely worth trying, but not the best for the style."
"D- Good stout, good, not great"
"overall...this is not a coffee stout by any stretch, but since it's listed in the DS/RIS category...well...it doesn't drink like one of those either. cappuccino stout? well it defies a category but it has more porter like characteristics than anything else in IMO. a good, relatively tasty, high ABV beer for the price."
"D. It wasn't to bad, was expecting some more sweetness from a beer that has cappuccino in its name. I like a good bold cup of coffee and the beer had that flavoring to it. Think it would of been better if allowed to warm up some more."
"Worth a try for those who love stouts."
"O: An ok coffee stout but not up there with any of the greats like FBS or Peche, and it reminds me slightly of Wake Up Call though Wake Up Call is superior in my opinion. Still, a good value and an easy drink."
"App 3, Smell 3, Taste 3, Mouthfeel 3, Overall 3, Score 3"
"D-For me, I love Lagunitas, but I won't buy this again. They have some awesome beers but this is not one of them. This almost seems like it should be mixed with the World Wide Stout I just reviewed to make a balanced beer. The difference is that the WWS can stand on its own as something cool and different. This is just average."
"A decent coffee stout although the alcohol dominates the palate a little too much to reign supreme in the drinkability category. There are several other options on the market that I would chose first but that's not saying that this is bad in any way."
"One bomber of an 8.8% ABV stout is good enough (or more than enough) for most but it didn't take long for all 22 ounces to disappear. No hint of alcohol, but after a while the bitterness from the coffee may make you want to take a break anyway."
"Overall flavors are not as big...namely I expected to taste more coffee. Still this is a nice blend and a worthy brew."
"drinks pretty well. pretty simple execution, but a tasty brew thats worth the reasonable price every year. not one I'd go too far out of my way for, however. does everything good, but not great."
"It's good, and easily drinkable. It's got a richness to it that isn't in your face. A bit of a middle of the road with this one. Glad I had it, and have more but at the same time I'm not going to stretch myself to gather it up whenever I see it."
"Solid, but how can a big beer like this be so drinkable? Coffee Stouts have been all the rage over the past year, though Lagunitas was ahead of the times and near the head of the pack."
"This isn't a brew that will change the world, but it's very drinkable, tasty and surely one of the best values out there. Definitely worthy of repeats."
"D- I love black coffee so this is right up my alley. Just like drinking cold espresso x10. Not bitter at all, just nice and smooth. Even though the espresso tends to be the strongest characteristic it doesn't overshadow the other flavors at all. Another great offering from Lagunitas and easily my favorite coffee stout to date."
"D: Definitely a hearty meal beer...couldn't imagine drinking multiple of these in one sitting."
"D: I did some research about green pepper off-flavors, but could not find anything in a quick search. I definitely do not remember green pepper flavor when I tasted this beer at Binny's."
"D: one bottle is enough. Kind of a speedway light only the mouthfeel isn't as smooth"
"Pours a fairly-dark brown though not as dark as I would expect for the style. Single-finger tan head falls down slowly and leaves a bit of spotty lacing. Good collar as it fades. The nose brings coffee and cream, though it is pretty tame on both. A bit of a metallic note hits behind the roast. The taste is strong, bitter coffee with some scalded cream. Not particularly pleasant. Really, really metallic in the finish. Dry with an off bitterness. Not sire why I got this, as I haven't had too much success with any non-hoppy offerings from Lagunitas. I would not drink this again."
"D - This is drinkable, but it is lacking in body and character. Not the usual quality I am used to from lagunitas."
"I am not sure why this is a ""cappuccino"" stout. I think I was expecting something much milkier and smoother than this, and so the prickly mouthfeel and somewhat abrasive/alcoholic end was upsetting and causes me to mark down drinkability."
"A drinkable beer but no more than a bomber at a time. I'll keep my coffee separate and get it from a Thai restaurant when I want it cold."
"D- This was a decent stout. Not something I would come back to but I enjoyed it."
"Pours a clear dark brown with two fingers of medium brown colored, dense foam, slowly settling, with rings of fine lace left behind. Smell: espresso, earthy, milk chocolate, sweet citrus note. Taste: big milk chocolate hits first, then espresso, and on into dark brown sugar with an earthy hopping in the back. Exceptionally creamy, giving it a very rich feel that's cut slightly by the coffee. Not crazily complex, but big flavors. Great coffee stout."
"It's actually not bad but seems strange for what the label offers. It does represent the coffee aspect decently though so I could drink it again no problem."
"Poured hard into my snifter. Not at all what i was expecting, brown like neecastle with a lite head. Smell is all coffee. Taste is bitter coffee. Would never buy this crap again. The only reason it wasn't a drain pour, it was my last beer. This pisses me off because i love lagunitas."
"Cheers..."
"D - Drinks on the medium side of stouts, especially for a double stout (or is it a Double) my bottle states 8.8% Alc., different from the 9.2 stated above"
"Lagunitas is one of my favorite breweries, and never fails to put out a quality product. I recommend giving this a try, along with any other Lagunitas you may come across!"
"Poured a very dark garnet hue with a medium head. I was surprised this one wasn't darker, knowing the style. Smells of coffee, what else? The coffee is very forward in this one, maybe too little malt body to hold it's own against the coffee but it's a very good coffee flavor. Makes me want to go out and get the coffee they use. Too often, coffee stouts tend to taste a bit stale to me - like the pot that's been on the warmer all day. That's not the case with this one, a great coffee flavor. The mouthfeel is a bit too light for the style. There's a bit of body but I like my doubles to really coat the mouth. That said the great coffee flavor and light body make it seem like I could have a couple of these in a sitting. I don't know if I'd try that with the 8.8% ABV but I feel like I could. Overall a very enjoyable brew, if it had more body (in mouthfeel and malt) I think it would be a top beer."
"Good body when poured and substantial aroma. The alcohol content was not overly - recognizable which made it easy to drink. I recommend it and according to the label it is a limited release."
"Another fantastic beer from one of my favorite breweries. Lagunitas never ceases to wow me."
"This is a fine coffee stout, very enjoyable."
"D: I am somewhat disappointed with this beer. This was pretty much a middle of the road coffee stout."
"Much lighter mouthfeel than I expected (and wanted), and a bit overly carbonated too. Would be easier to drink if it were less bitter and/or more creamy. This brew is far from balanced (in true Lagunitas style) but solid nonetheless."
"D: I enjoyed this beer but maybe not as much as other coffee stouts. Also enjoyed Lagunitas Imperial Stout a tad more than this one. Overall though, a well made stout."
"Appropriately dubbed as cappuccino, less appropriately dubbed as an imperial stout. Silky smooth mouthfeel with above average carbonation. I'm at a rating crossroads here. As a nice coffee delivery vehicle, this is quite nice if not simplistic. As a 9% self proclaimed Imperial Stout, this fails to deliver the goods. Overall a decent drink, but doesn't quite meet style."
"D: Pretty drinkable for the style, but maybe a little bit too much."
"I was very surprised when I saw that it wasn't rated at least an A-. But can't knock a B+. Very good beer"
"D: pretty desh, not the world's best imperial but, certainly not the worst. I would have liked to see more in the way of body, carbonation and hops but, I don't think that's what they were going for and I respect that. On the upside everything is very well balanced. I would drink it again though I doubt that I will."
"22 ounce bottle, says 8.8% ABV on label. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is coffee, roasted malt and some chocolate. The taste is the same as the aroma, it's all coffee, roasted malt and dark chocolate. There's also a lingering bitter roasty coffee finish. No surprise at all, but the coffee is strongest in both the aroma and flavor. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy with moderate carbonation. However, it seems a little thin for a big stout. Drinkability is OK, it's smooth and goes down easy enough. I think it's a decent overall brew."
"I am one that is up for a good cup of coffee, and in turn coffee stouts, or stouts that have great coffee flavor in them (Victory at Sea comes to mind) However, if they are done well. In this case, beyond the coffee aroma and general flavor, there are no roasty or creamy flavors in this. Being ""cappuccino", I was expecting a strong French or espresso roast, but this did not have it. I sipped on this beer out of the fridge cold, 20 minutes in, 40, an hour, and then some since I was wrapping Christmas gifts at the time. Warmth of the beer did not bring any complexity I was seeking."
"D- This is a delightful stout that rests well overall. You cant beat the price @ $4.50 so you can bet on me drinking another one of these soon....And one in a year to check for development."
"Verdict: Very nice and worth the price."
"Overall this doesn't live up the style. The alcohol is well hidden, but the flavors just don't pop. Maybe it's my interpretation of the style. Either way, it's a nice beer, but I won't go back to it. Plus, I'm not much of a coffee guy."
"Pours a dark red into my 22oz glass. Had a good amount of head that dissipated quickly. On the nose I get the coffee that was used in this beer and it's very nice. When I take a sip I get more of the coffee but it's mellow and lingers on your palate. This beer is a winter release and I can see why, it'll be nice to sip on this while sitting next to a fire on a cold night."
"drinkability: Wow, for a 9%+ and an intense cappuccino this is remarkably smooth."
"This is an alright beer. The aroma needs some work, and the taste could use some boosting (a little bit more coffee flavor, perhaps), but otherwise, it's a very easy to drink beer. Beware it's ABV though. It's dangerous to have more than a bomber or 2 in a night."
"Consumed mid March 2010."
"D: Interesting brew. A high ABV and a bitter brew makes this a one and done for me, but it is worthy of a try."
"D - Well hidden alcohol, not rich, and surprisingly easy to drink."
"I would recommend the growler fill, but would not get this beer in a bottle."
"Drinkability is surprisingly good. I love a good stout, but my heart lies with a great IPA. The bitterness of this beer makes it all that much more attractive to me."
"A very good stout, and the cappucino is as advertised."
"Drinkability: Somewhat aggressive, but thats what makes it stand out. A hop head's breakfast or brunch beer."
"D- the coffee flavors are not too overpowering, providing as fairly drinkable stout. no real prominence of the higher alcohol content."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly high for such a high abv beer (9.26%). This is very smooth with no sharpness or unpleasant edges."
"Notes: Not bad, but not great. A coffee purists coffee stout."
"O: I think some people will love this beer but I just can't get past the odd hop flavor and the lack of distinct coffee notes."
"D- One of the better coffee stouts I've tried so far; really interesting brew worth trying."
"I would never guess this beer at over 9% because there is not a hint of alcohol in the taste. Medium bodied with a good smooth feel. Easy to drink and very enjoyable. If I had not split this up among some friends I could ave easily drank this whole bomber on my own."
"D: OK, nothing seriously wrong. Flavorful and smooth."
"D- The high abv isn't a problem but the overall package of this beer makes me think that a bomber is even too much of it and I love coffee stouts."
"D-This is one of the easiest drinking coffee stouts I've had to date. This is especially true considering how high the ABV is on this one."
"The only thing I do not like is the very sweet taste, but if you like that then it is for you!"
"Overall - A fine, light, stout, but one that could use more malt sweetness to balance out the bitterness in this beer. Coffee flavor is good, but lacks complexity and additional flavor elements. This beer is fine, but not very interesting."
"I've enjoyed this twice now at Leon's Full Service. This beer had a surprisingly light colored rocky head and body. Dark amber hues were visible in the sunlight. I love this style of beer, so I was very pleased to find the taste of clean coffee leading the way for the roasted malts that followed. This is a fantastic gateway beer for coffee lovers! It's the first beer my parents have ever agreed to enjoying!"
"While clearly not the worst tasting beer in the world, this is nevertheless a disaster. Calling it a stout at all is being generous, and overall the beer is a case study in imbalance. If you like coffee, like alcohol, but don't like moderation, this may be the perfect beer for you. I like both, and I like drinking a lot of both, but I need more to be impressed by a beer. Poorly executed on most fronts. I suppose aging it would mellow out the alcohol, but I'm not convinced there's any reason to bother."
"Drinkability: So overall, a pretty decent beer. Nothing bad about it really. Compared to good imperial stouts, its weakish and boring. Compared to my idea of something called a cappuccino stout, its not very coffee-ey and not silky smooth in the mouth. A bit of a let down, but pretty cheap and worth getting to try or split with someone, as it does drink nice if you don't overanalyze it. Its actually much better than my numbers make it seem, but in reality, its not in the same ballpark as the really good imperial stouts."
"D: It is relatively easy to drink this stout and the alcohol is well hidden."
"(D)- A good stout with an unfortunate off-putting aroma, but the rest of this brew is good. A good coffee beer."
"D - It drank easily and was very smooth and well rounded. A good choice for beginers."
"M/D - Medium body and generously carbonated for a stout. The alcohol is hidden quite well by the cappuccino/coffee flavor so no worries of off flavors. Finishes a little on the dry side like a cup of coffee would but still has that stout texture present."
"Smooth, tasty and easy drinking big beer. Not as full looking or feeling as expected. Solid, respectable brew, but it isn't particularly complex and doesn't push any boundaries. I'd be proud to have made it, but it ain't Espresso Yeti. A good value for the price."
"A good coffee stout. Try it, you'll like it."
"d - I thought this was a really nice stout. Very nice mix in the smell and taste and I was glad the coffee didn't dominate either. Would have been a little better with less carbonation but definitely worth trying out and I'll be having it again."
"Tropical notes of alcohol jump out of the gate followed by a burnt, roasty and mildly sweet combo of astringent coffee and malts. Followed up by some toast, hop bitterness and more throat-warming alcohol on a dry finish. I am certainly no coffee expert, but is the name on the bottle influencing me into thinking the coffee flavor is a bit different? I've probably only had 3 cappuccinos in my life and two of those were probably from a gas station coffee machine. Maybe it is the hops, because Lagunitas loaded this beast up with plenty. The body is really not all that full, and I find the alcohol every bit the 9.26% it claims...and then some. I do not find this to be one of my favorite releases from the crew in Petaluma, but I like it enough to buy one more to see what happens in the cellar. I think it might be more suited to my tastes after a year or so of mellowing - chill out dawg!"
"Notes: This a very drinkable american double imperial stout. A remarkable brew. Cheers."
"Very drinkable. I could go back for more."
"I picked up a 22 oz. bottle for ~$3.50 at one of the Binny's in Chicago - it was the last one on the shelf. This limited release brew is extremely interesting. The high alcohol content and strong mix of easily discernable flavors are exceptional, but the body is a bit of a turnoff. However, I feel that the pros outweigh the cons, so I strongly suggest that you try this beer if you get an opportunity to do so because I know I will get this again at some point."
"Would recommend especially given the price and will buy again."
"D: Flavors are bold and alcohol is high making this a beer to take your time with. As another reviewer put it, this stout is not that ""hearty."" The flavors are rich but there's just something missing."
"Overall, not the heartiest of stouts. Too much light getting through this one for my likings, also lacking in body. It does, however, pack a good amount of coffee and espresso flavors. If you like coffee and you like beer, this one is worth a try."
"D: I'd rather drink coffee, or beer."
"Poured from a bomber into my 12 ounce snifter. Poured very dark brown with about 3 inches of head and suds that clung to the side of the glass. Rich coffee and malty scents. Roasted creamy chocolate and coffee flavors. Mouthfeel is sort of watery for the rich flavors. Certainly a sippable beer one that is rich and tasteful."
"Cola brown-red in color, it's clear with little signs of carbonation. Begins with a nice, albeit not too thick, tan head that dissipates quickly. Caramel and a tinge of alcohol in the aroma. Some alcohol up front, but definite signs of coffee in the middle and finish. Alcohol is very well disguised. Thinnish mouthfeel. Mild bitterness in the back end."
"Cheers!"
"Notes: Another winner from Lagunitas. The first stout I have from them I think, but it keeps the standard form the brewery rather well, and the price-quality ratio for these bombers keeps on being outstanding."
"""This particular beverage is produced less than 50 miles from my home. Generally I love the Lagunitas brand, but personally I found this variety to be somewhat of a disappointment. This interation of the lagaunitas brewery appeared in the local grocery store and as I am a periodic coffee lover I thought I would give this ""limited issue"" beverage a try. I purchased two bottles. The first was consumed, I found the beverage to be pleasantly bitter, but the coffee overtones to be somewhat intimidating, the mouth feel was appropriately long lasting, not watery. Flavor was like nothing I had ever experienced, not wonderful but tolerable. The second bottle as consumed several days later. I am sorry to say that I was unable to finish the serving. It may have been my mood or something else but I was unable finish because of the seemingly too strong coffee flavor along with bitter hop characteristics. """
"D - doable but not my bag."
"D- This a pretty easy drinking stout for the abv. I could have a couple of these a night easily."
"Overall it's tasty but needs a little improvement in body and aroma. Still a good imperial coffee stout."
"Overall, I enjoyed this pint. It's a solid stout and basically lives up to it's name. Good stuff."
"This is a really nice stout obviously rich with strong coffee aroma and flavor. During the pour I noticed a little less carbonation than I would have liked. The head was thin and dissipated quickly. The aromas are huge. Like a big piece of double chocolate cake and an esppresso. The mouth feel was a little thinner than what I would have xpected but all the big chocolate espresso flavor is there with very less bitterness than expected. A very drinkable stout. Too bad it's just a seasonal. I could drink this year round."
"On-tap at Sierra Grille into a 8 oz glass. Pours dark brown with a decent beige head, sticks around and leaves some lacing. Not picking too much up for smells, faint bitter espresso and maybe a touch of dark fruit. Has a pretty good espresso taste the first few sips, but the taste becomes less and less strong as you go on. Slight pepper, milk chocolate. Drinks more like a porter than a stout. Tiny alcohol taste. Mouthfeel is thin. Drinkability, it's easy to drink and the price is definitely good. It mostly suffers from not being interesting, there are plenty of coffee beers that are better than this, and more stouty than this. Decent but nothing to write home about."
"The body is a little thin for the style. I expected the body to be a bit thicker. Carbonation level is moderate. Starts out pretty sweet, like a cheap cappucino. Some plum(?) in the middle a bit, and a good black coffee finish. I like the aftertaste. This is just a little too sweet for my liking, but this would be a good starter for one wanting to get into coffee-beers. Not bad."
"F: Semi bitter with a little sweetness, a little spicy, lots of roast and coffee flavors lingering. Some syrupy sweet malts and bitter taste that is a little bleh. This was actually a little disappointing to me for all the amazing beers Lagunitas puts out. Perhaps it was just a bad time for me to review it, and it seems to have some off flavors. Anyways, for what it is it's still a pretty decent beer."
"Nice beer. Definitely worth a try. Given the price and availability I will revisit this one again."
"However, if this beer were categorized as a milk/cream stout or coffee/espresso stout, I would rate it above many others in those categories."
"Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout is a very dark reddish brown ale with a thin, dense, khaki head that leaves solid sheets of lacing on the glass. It has strong roasted coffee aroma that's maybe a touch sweet. It smells delicious. It's medium bodied with a quick, dry finish that gets slightly gritty afterwards. It has a nice, roasty flavor that's well balanced. It gets bitter at the end-- both a coffee bitterness and a green bitterness. There's a lingering coffee aftertaste. It's almost a robust porter; a very nice beer."
"D - I will totally try this again but with so many coffee stouts still untried I will have to seek this out and try it again in a year."
"D- A VERY strong beer, but if you like dark roast coffees like I do, you will really enjoy this beer (that is if you don't add any cream and, or sugar to it!). Definitely can't drink this beer fast, but that just means you are forced to enjoy it longer! I really appreciate this beer, and it would be a really good choice with a dessert!"
"Pretty good on drinkability, though the lackluster aspect of this beer doesn't make me crave more."
"Overall an excellent imperial stout and one that will be in my regular fall & winter beer list."
"Well done."
"D- This 25 oz. bottle needs to be shared with friends at a table. Poker night was a great time to sample :)"
"Conclusion: Really pretty tasty coffee stout; hides the alcohol very well; this is a great beer for people that love chocolate in their coffee stouts. Really nice balance between coffee and chocolate flavors...only issue is a BIT more depth would be nice."
"Overall: Very nice body and malt character balance this beers relatively high 9.26% ABV (is it really necessary to go to the hundredth decimal?). This is quite a sweet stout especially to be considered a coffee beer. While the sweetness is pleasant, it detracts from the expected coffee character. I would like to see a much stronger coffee presence here and there is room in the beers profile for this."
"Not big and bold, just an easy quaffer. I like it."
"Pours a rich, dark brown with nice khaki head. Decent lacing. Smell is of roasted grains and spent coffee grounds... pretty basic. Taste is of roasted grains and a nice blend of coffee beans with a touch of creamy/milky sweetness. Body is not as heavy or thick as would have liked, slight watery quality, minimal aftertaste. Nice beer, would have more, but not necessairly seek out."
"Pours a dark chocolate brown with thick brown head that dissipates. Aroma is a rich chocolate with notes of espresso hidden. Flavor is of coffee and malts a bit milky as well. Not as much chocolate in the flavor as in the aroma. Body is medium but not as thick as expected with light carbonation."
"Drinkability: The ABV is untraceable, making this a very drinkable imperial stout."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is a little soft. Overall, not a high quality coffee, too much of a charred flavor, just not one of the better coffee stouts out there. Probably won't pick this one up again. Skal."
"""I think it tastes like potatoes... boiled potatoes."""
"I reeeeally enjoyed this"
"Edit: I tried an experiment last night. I recapped this bomber about half full and reopened it tonight to conclude consumption. It took a straight down pour to get a head, but it was a nice and lasting quarter inch or so which has left some nice spidery lacing. I haven't detected any detrimental effects of opening and recapping after 24 hours."
"#3 in my Super Bowl of Lagunitas bombers. This beer pours a slick, oily Americano black with a decent sandy brown head that quickly dissipates into a thing ring around the outside of the glass. The aroma of this beer is pretty straightforward. Large amounts of freshly brewed espresso mixed with sweet cream, a bit of chocolate, molasses and overly ripe fruit. The flavor is very similar, and leading the way is what reminds me of a excellently made Mocha. Fresh ground espresso mixed with Ghiridelli chocolate powder and fresh sweet cream. Also a bit of hazelnut comes through. It kind of reminds me of Nutella with coffee. The mouthfeel is nice and oily, coating the mouth with a nice coffee flavor. Overall, for its price, this is a great beer. Very tasty. When this beer comes out again, I'm going to buy one fresh and compare against the aged version."
"D: Not that drinkable of a stout. The sweetness and then the high alcohol bitterness and bite in the finish is unique but might get too much."
"not my favorite imperial stout, but good."
"taste was alot like the smell, Coffee dominating this biznattch! medium body feel"
"D- Had no problem finishing the bomber although I took a break from the bottle for a hour or so between snifter fills. I think the alcohol could be tamed down a bit and the coffee boosted(especially the roast) slightly as I think the additional ingredients are holding this back some. This is a great beer that I hope to find on a nitro tap someday."
"Overall I feel this is one of Lagunitas' best beers. Perfect combination of a coffee flavored ale but also enough to keep non-coffee lovers interested. I like that fact it only comes in bombers as a 12 oz. would not do this big beer justice."
"drinkability: solid stout and good coffee flavor. I would rank this up with other similar coffee stouts"
"Eh..."
"Poured from bottle into a large snifter. Pours dark black, nice color. About a one inch head foamy off- white grows from the meniscus, quickly fading away leaving mocha colored foam on top. Moderate lacing left on the glass. Smells decent. I pick up on the coffee and roasted malts. Faint alcohol. Baking chocolate. Something else I can't quite put my nose on...almost metallic. Tastes like it smells, minus the weird aroma I was picking up on.Black coffee. Expresso and ""burntness"". Alcohol is there but not overbearing. Roasted malts are balanced by a slight bitter hop profile. I find the body is lacking. It is very drinkable, but the body is thin. Overall a decent beer, nothing spectacular, but decent."
"D - Overall, a solid brew that gives a very nice bang for the buck. Not mindblowing, but really pretty enjoyable, and for $4.50 a bomber, definitely a good purchase."
"Overall, this is a great beer, but it is a little more bitter than I would like it to be. The coffee flavors are present, but not bold that they should be called out so strongly. I would move the word ""cappuccino"" from the title to the description, more like the cayenne in Great Divide's Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti, and then my impression of the beer would more closely match my expectation."
"I think I'll stick to just coffee."
"D: A really drinkable beer, particularly for the price."
"bizzare take on a strong stout. for a beer with ""cappuccino"" on the label, thre was very little coffee or cappuccino anywhere to be found."
"In general this is an enjoyable, high-powered drink with a very pleasant but not exceptional taste."
"D-this is extremely tasty and has a great body. another solid offering from lagunitas, one of my favorite brew pubs in all the land"
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Pours jet black with a half finger of tan head. The head dissipates quickly, Leaving a thin white ring. Little to no lacing. Smalls great! Like my morning coffee. Tastes like it too! Sweet malt, and awesome coffee flavor. Little carbonation, and a slght hop bitterness. 9.26 ABV? Alcohol is completely hidden in the creamy coffee taste. Drinkability is very good. This beer goes down super smooth and tastes like a creamy, cup of cappuccino! Delicious!"
"Drinkability- I thought it was pretty good but I thought the coffee wasn't strong enough for my tastes."
"Quite nice, though cappuccino is not brought to mind quite so much as mildly roasted coffee. Sure, there is some residual sweetness from the malt that sings at parts, but a bit more sweetness would help pull things together a little better. Still, alcohol is well-hidden, and this is a beer that would serve as an excellent pairing for roasted, caramelized meats or rich chocolate dessert."
"D- A good stout to try, but there are better ones out there IMO. I'd have it again, but only if Rogues' Shakespeare or chocolate or Yeti were not available."
"D- Probably one of the best coffee stouts Ive consumed so far. Quite a great offering from Lagunitas as this is my first from them and look forward to possibly finding them again."
"Drinkability is good, but a bit too much coffee ground & booze warmth. Let this one warm up a bit past cellar temps for better results..."
"I thought this beer tasted really nice, which is most important. Everything else felt average."
"First off - I am a HUGE Laguinitas fan - basically every beer I've had by them I have been a huge fan of. Except Cappuccino Stout. Don't get me wrong - it's a phenomenal beer - but maybe it wasn't the beer I was looking for. Recently being on a stout kick, nothing has blown Founders Breakfast Stout out of the water, and I was hoping that this one might. Top notch beer with a great dark color, pretty good smell, excellent coffee taste that is medium bodied and very easy to drink - masking the 9.26% abv quite well - just not the beer I was looking for at the time."
"Drinkability: Other than the appearance, this was a very good beer. Share it with a friend or drink it on your own, but beware of the alcohol content - it's hidden very well."
"D-There seems to be a slight astringency, but it's very drinkable for such a big beer."
"After 1 and ½ glasses I'm left with the unfortunate conundrum of whether or not I feel like finishing the bottle. It has definite merits: nice malt, good sweetness, hellish bitterness, high alcohol I think; and it has definite downfalls: the over-the-top coffee ground harshness. Well I can say one thing: it was well priced at Central Market, less than $5/bomber. If I had paid $10 for it I would be disappointed. If you're into the coffee beers, it may be your thing. My experience with Lagunitas is that it is either impressively good or impressively disappointing... it's like they have two head brewers who are evil twins."
"makes it worse but at the same time nothing to make it better than any other coffe beer out there if coffee beers are you thing it's worth a shot"
"D - This was a pretty good stout. Bold enough to keep my interest, yet the flavors didn't play out as I hoped. I was wanting a little more coffee"
"D- a damn fine brew, you can't even detect the 9.26% ABV 'till it creeps up on you, so delicious you can get carried away, easily one of the best coffee stouts i've had"
"-bye"
"D: this beer could be the poster child for drinking beer at the proper temperature. At first, when still at near-fridge temps, Cappuccino Stout was fairly average. But man oh man if this brew didn't morph into a beautifully complex yet well-balanced beery masterpiece. I bought 2 bottles of this one with the intention of cellaring one for a year or so- I think I've changed my mind about that plan. This beer is good for many reasons, one of them being the unexpected hop profile- I'm starting to think that aging this beer would eliminate that feature to the beer's detriment."
"The only trouble is, this is supposed to be a cappuccino stout, and there was nothing vaguely coffee-like about this beer."
"Drink ability was good. For such a strong beer it was sessionable and alcohol was very light. Wish the head stuck around longer and the body was thicker. For only 5 bucks a bomber this beer is very good. It's like a poor mans version of Peche Mortel and Beer Geek Breakfast."
"Light chocolate pour, light lacing. Smooth coffee aroma, almost heavenly!..taste is as expected, smooth, yet that bitter coffee flavour just blends in nicely with the malt and chocolate. Thanks to Lagunitas for a flavourful stout that is palate pleasing!"
"Taste, how can something be so bitter and smooth at the same time? This is some strong coffee, but something, I dunno, manages to roll the bitter and smooth around and hide the alcohol. A great amount of everything in this stout, burnt malt, big hop character, well hidden alcohol and smoothness at the same time that enhances the chewiness of the beer. A lot of cool stuff rolled into one here."
"I got plentiful amounts of coffee in this unlike some others. The body lets light pass through it, and the nose isn't quite there. Mild coffee and roasted barley in the nose. In the taste is more supreme coffee, roasted coffee beans and a burnt bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel offers very sharp bubbles, almost a seltzer quality. Is lacking a mouthfeel similar to other high abv stouts. More watery like a 6% porter."
"Pours dark brown with beige head. Aroma is lots of roasted coffee with some hop bitterness. The flavor is teh same with lots of coffee and hops. The finish is more roasted malt. This is one of the hoppier coffee beers I have had, but not quite as hoppy as Mikkeller's Beer Geek Breakfast. A good beer with a great, creamy medium-thick mouthfeel. Recommended."
"The flavor brings it. Boozy, with tons of sweet notes to balance a fairly bitter ale overall. Coffee and chocolate are notable at first, with caramel and dark fruit coming in to relieve. Smooth sipper with a well-attenuated mouthfeel. Carbonation is right on, balance is all there. An overall pleasant sip and probably my favorite Lagunitas stout."
"A little thin for a stout, but definitely on-par for the style. This one is dangerously-drinkable to a degree, but I've certainly enjoyed more pleasant coffee stouts in recent years. A sipper."
"Drinkability isnt too high becuase I think 1 was good, but another would probably be pushing it. Its actual drinkability its high becuase its pretty good but as for ""amount"" drinkability rather low. It would probably be better around breakfast time!"
"Pours a clear, dark red/brown color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of roasted malt, coffee, sweet malt, slight alcohol, and slight hop. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of coffee and roasted malt up front, then slight hops and sweet malt background. Overall, a complex aroma, strong coffee flavor, and good body."
"No bad, but nothing special. Worth a try, not nearly as good as some other coffee stouts though."
"The Cappuccino Stout shows a jet black in the glass with a light tan froth, above average lacing, & good retention. Aromas of bitter espresso, smoke, subtle chocolate, light citrus/orange hops, & roasted barley follow through as flavors on the palate. There is definitely a hop presence in this beer, but is well hidden by bitter fresh espresso quality. The full, bread-like texture presents the well integrated, but warming alcohol aspect. The beer drinks well from beginning through the long finish, but I really should have had this beer for breakfast as opposed to an after dinner drink. The reason I say that is because I get a caffine kick from this beer....just don't tell the FDA. Overall, a solid beer that I highly recommend due to it's limited release."
"Pours very dark with some ruby/mahogany highlights in the glass and a nice head that leaves moderate lacing. Strong smell of coffee in the nose along with something I can't quite place. A sweet rather than dry stout, but not too much. Mouthfeel is good if maybe a little on the thin side. Not a bad beer, but not a great one either. I like it."
"D - This is a good, but not great stout. If the bitterness could be turned down somewhat this could be improved."
"I find Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout to be a hidden gem. Good flavor and aroma, good value. The only knock, and a minor one, it is a little on the thin side for an imperial stout. Recommended."
"Bottle poured into my Duvel tulip. I immediately notice that for am American Double it isn't too dark - it ends up being a fairly translucent deep brown. The head was minimal and dissipated pretty quickly. The smell is sweet and has notes of cocoa and maybe some brown sugar. The scent is probably the best thing this brew has going for it as I would soon find out. The taste is a little thin in the mouth. At least it doesn't dissappoint in that it really has some powerful coffee flavors to it. If this brew had a stronger body and thus more complexity it would be infinitely better. But I paid $3.99 for it plus tax - I can't ever recall having seen an American Double for cheaper! Certainly worth a try."
"Poured black with some brownish notes, the pour was thin for such a big brew, very small dirty head. Nose of cappucino and maybe chocolate. Taste was thinner, overcarbonatied, astringent, lackig flvor and body. Not a fan of this brew and given the ABV, not very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is great. Not nearly as sweet as many others of a similar gravity in the style. It shows no hint of the 9+% ABV. The neutral flavored back end makes this beer insanely drinkable."
"drinkability: very much my style. affordable with a pretty well masked high abv."
"Overall Impressions: Gets much better as it warms and the very slight astringency (puckering) lessens. It was actually hoppier and not quite as malty as I expected. The coffee flavor was weaker than I thought going in (that was influenced only by reading the label). Overall it was OK, but not great (looking back not near the top of my Lagunitas brews). I would like to try it again closer to room temperature to see if my impressions change."
"- Very drinkable, and if the brew was truly an imperial and as strong as it states... this puppy would be a 5. But after polishing off the whole bomber rather quickly... I can only guess that this stout is about 6.5% Alc... not even close to the stated 9.26%. It's a shame... seems very watered down..."
"In spite of this, the beer went down easy. Perhaps my bottle was old and the coffee taste faded?"
"Thanks Lagunitas for once again making another awesome beer."
"D - I could have a couple of these, but the richness would get to me after a while."
"~ Purchased this 22 oz bomber from Frank's Beverage in Glen Cove, NY. The appearance of this stout is nothing crazy, but then again, you are buying this beer for the taste. The aroma is predominantly coffee followed by some roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate. The taste is of rich dark coffee and roasted malts. It finishes off with a bitter coffee aftertaste. The 8.3% ABV is well hidden behind all the flavors making this one truly drinkable. A well-behaved stout overall, but it's far from outstanding. ~"
"seems like it would taste good with a scoop of vanilla icecream."
"D - A little above average, especially if you're going to classify this as an imperial stout."
"Overall, the look and smell is great, especially if you are a coffee lover. However, the mouthfeel is very carbonated with a strong, syrupy taste. Although, I do feel the aftertaste leaves you with that nice coffee flavor. I don't know if it was this particular bottle that had too much of that Carbonated/Fizzy taste or not. It did get a little bit better as it warmed up, but not much. I don't think I will be buying another."
"As far as coffee beers go, this is good, but pretty middle-of-the-road. As it warms, I'm enjoying the interplay of the coffee flavors and the beery flavors, but it's nothing remarkable. A solid B+."
"D: A nice beer, tasty and delicious. Good stout, and I like the coffee kick."
"D-One is enough. Its not bad at all, but I can't see myself having more than one. Its a sipper for sure."
"Pours a heavy dark brown, average lacing and appearance. Typical thin mocha head. Smells like coffee grinds, seems like it will be on the more true-to-coffee side, and it is, but it has plenty of sweetness to balance it out. Lightly hopped for a Lagunitas beer. Despite the thick body, doesn't carry great weight in the mouth and finish, but is decently drinkable if you like coffee. Not a rich coffee bomb, but like fresh espresso. Not bad."
"This stout pours a dark brown / nearly black, with a smallish light tan head that dissipates quickly, leaving a ring around the glass; lots of tiny carbo bubbles. Aroma is a letdown - sweet malts, chocolate, light roasty notes, not really much coffee (considering its a coffee stout). Taste is also average: dark chocolate, maybe a little hazelnut, pretty sweet, alcohol occasionally peeks through; there's a slight hint of coffee / cappucino that comes through in the finish. Kind of tastes like a sweet stout to me. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, nearly full-bodied, with perhaps a little too much carbonation. Its pretty drinkable, but kind of boring. I felt that this was pretty lackluster for a coffee stout (as there was very little coffee character)."
"You know, I LOVE coffee stouts, and I didn't like this stout. At all. Too much superficial sweetness made it taste like instant coffee. Additionally, it is leaving a bitterness in my mouth. Perhaps a hoppy bitterness, but nonetheless inappropriate. My opinion: avoid. Very surprising coming from the usually-reliable Lagunitas."
"Pick one up! It's worth a try."
"Overall, this is just a slightly better than average stout. It's very thin body and less pronounced flavors detract from the overall experience, but it does have decent taste."
"Aggressive pour just gets half a finger of cream brown foam, this dissolving down to the thinnest coating possible, lacing pretty much out of the question. It's pretty murky rather than pitch black, dark brown at the core taking on a yellow cast further out. Curiously, it's the grapey plum, cherry fruit that you notice first in the nose before the rich coffee grounds, malt, mocha, butterscotch scents spread wide, some sweet scone notes, black licorice, over time a banana edge comes out with sweet baking spices. Full-bodied without a great deal of heaviness, the carbonation as well as generally firm mouth feel ensures that it moves pretty nimbly. The licorice and ginger, cinnamon spice stronger here, as if you're drinking infused coffee - once that coffee, mocha, caramel hits the set it moves more towards a traditional center. Grape, apricot, cherry, pear fruit, an enjoyable mixture. While not bitter, does stiffen towards the end, a welcome textural change. Lack of chewy density might help make it a warmer weather stout choice."
"Notes: Well, I am a sucker for mocha cappucino's, so I thought I would absolutely love a cappucino stout. To the contrary. While this is a solid effort from one of my favorite breweries, I thought it missed the mark just a bit. The chocolatey cappucino flavors were good, but they didn't feel like they came close to reaching their full potential. And the citrusy hops just didn't help matters, in my opinion. Everything seemed kind of scattered out and never really melded together like it should have. A solid effort, but not one I feel the need to drink again."
"The feel is thick and milky; gritty on the way down. It's sweeter than I expected but well-balanced. Not bad at all."
"Poured a dark opaque brown with a frothy head. As I drank there was much stickage to the glass; love that. Smelled of roasted malt, caramel and coffee. Taste was big coffee, along with roasted goodness and sweetness. Finished easy; not much bitterness. Mouthfeel was good, nice carbonation all the way down. Drinkability was good, as this was very tasty and easy to drink. Very enjoyable."
"Good beer, but not what you expect out of an Imperial Stout. This was more of a strong brown or milk stout and very underwhelming in the cappuccino department."
"A lot more malt taste than coffee taste in this one. It goes down like a porter. I was hoping for a bigger taste than I got from this stout. In the future, I think Lagunitas could push this one a lot more. If they beefed up literally EVERYTHING about this beer, it would be crazy delicious. Unfortunately, it remains the victim of my high expectations... Nor-cal does hoppy better than stout (imo and with the exception of Big Bear Black)"
"From bomber, pours a dark amber/red-brown color, one finger tan head with minimal lacing. Can smell the alcohol along with the roasted coffee beans, has a bready feeling. Can taste the hops, chocolate, and malts- fairly balanced. Alcohol bears a stronger presence in the after-taste. Medium body with mild carbonation (wish it was heavier). But good stout none the less."
"There's no doubt this one is drinkable. It's not as good as some I've had, as it seems the coffee used might have some natural acidity that mars it a little, but worth trying if you're into coffee stouts and still good."
"how is this a stout? pours a caramel/coke with light coming through without even holding it up to the light. okay head, very spotty lace with pretty bad head retention. there's some but it's only a ring around the edge. smells of alcohol and a light cappuccino/coffee/burnt thing going on. tastes of burnt coffee and has a very light mouthfeel similar to a bad porter. this is not a very good beer and maybe if i had it a bit fresher it would've been a little bit better, but this is basically a crappy beer. lagunitas really let me down on this one."
"D: Very easy to drink, especially with the lighter mouthfeel. Reminds me a lot more of a coffee porter than a stout. The alcohol isn't noticeable at any part of the session (during OR afterwards). Another Lagunitas goodie, though not my favorite."
"Fairly drinkable stout. I liked it. Not my favorite, but if you do enjoy American style stouts reach out for this one to sample."
"This beer was a disappointment. It seemed like it was constantly off on the style requirements of a stout of this style. It could do very well to up the mouthfeel to full-bodied with a creamy smoothness while also darkening the color. This could help the flavor too. More roasted malts and coffee if that's what the name is going to be. Close, but no cigar."
"Pours a dark brownish amber with a bit of a light tan head. It smells rich of chocolaty coffee. It's got a thick, solid body which let's the richness of the flavor slide down your throat like an oil slick of goodness. Very drinkable and delicious. Can't beat the price of Lagunitas either. Highly recommend!"
"My first Lagunitas brew. A dark/reddish brown,like coffee with a small tan head,light carbonation,and loads of lacing. Aroma of coffee with sugar,and just a dash of cream. Flavor is pretty rich for the body being on the thin side, flavors of coffee,sugar,toffee,and hints at chocolate, I detected little hops or any of the higher alcohol content, smooth creamy mouthfeel with a sweet coffee aftertaste, very nice but I would have liked a touch more coffee type bitterness. A very drinkable brew despite being 8.3% ABV, I picked up this bomber for under $5 a very good value IMO,"
"Looks reddish and lighter - similar to Coke-a-Cola. White head that stays lacey. Doesn't look like a typical stout. Smells of fruit, roasted barley, and sweet malt. Ouch.... thick pour as it hits your mouth. A little strong and tastes of real thick coffee followed by molasses then the burn of alcohol as it coats down your throat."
"This is a big roasted coffee-bomb of a stout that is certainly not the most drinkable stout, especially for the relatively low ABV. Nonetheless, it's a good stout."
"Tastes like cappucino with burnt brownie chocolate and vanilla. Sugary up front, bitter in the back. Mouthfeel is tolerable but a tad thin."
"I'm certainly going to have more of this beer."
"Well, that was less exciting than expected. It looks like an Irish Red, and taste like coffee. Not a bad beer per se, but a dissapointment in the field of double stouts."
"This beer is balanced well with some really nice flavor character. It's does not over power with flavor but is enjoyable with each sip."
"Worth a shot - good Lagunitas offering."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Great subtle texture, seafoamy and slick at the same time. I couldn't/wouldn't recommend this one, as it feels like it should be in my morning to-go carafe with a milk and extra sugar. It doesn't work as a beer."
"Final Thoughts - Cheap bomber from Lagunitas makes for a good night starter. Definitely worth a shot for the various coffee flavors through out."
"I really enjoyed this one. Can't beat the price ($3.49) either. Reminded me a lot more of a milk stout than an Imperial, but it was highly drinkable and I would purchase it again."
"Mouthfeel is a little thicker than I expected from the light color, but nice and warming with the higher abv expected from a Limited Release. Drinkability is decent, although I would hate to drink two or three of these and have to wake up early in the morning."
"D: For 8.3% ABV, a singular coffee stout with a lot under the hood. Tons of flavor and the uniqueness one comes to expect from Lagunitas."
"Drinkability: It's very sweet, and quickly becomes too cloying to drink. It's best to split the bomber with someone else. Definitely not something I could drink multiple of, or that often."
"Poured from the bomber to a dark brown with ruby tints. Aroma was a coffee-toffee mixture, with a hint of roasted nutty malts. Mouthfeel was full and slightly chewy and the taste mirrored the nose. The only surprise was that the 8.3% alcohol never made itself known in either the nose or taste. Nonetheless, the finish was smooth and long."
"Nice, but not particularly impressive. I think the mouthfeel is the best thing going on here. I expected there to be a little more going on here besides coffee."
"It actually drinks pretty well. The abv is held in check and the flavors are all pretty subdued. Easily drinkable, just not the best example of the style."
"i liked this beer but it is not exceptional i know lagunitas does a good job but this is not one of there best"
"I find this brewer to be hit or miss so far. This one was a whiff for me. Prehaps it would fit better as an American Strong Ale instead of a stout."
"I highly recommend this one for any stout lover."
"Pretty decent beer, not one to seek out but not one to turn down either."
"Pours black withone finger tan head. Smell - coffee, hint of chocolate, alcohol. Taste - definately coffee, not sure if it's cappuccino or not, dark chocolate, roasted malts. Alcohol hidden pretty well. Rich and smooth, creamy, very good beer. It's drinkable for ABV. Would definately have it again."
"This beer poured a dark opaque brown with a two-finger head that lingered for a while. The smell is surprisingly malt-dominated with a bit of coffee and chocolate as well. The taste starts right out of the gate with a some bitter coffee flavor that gives way to malt sweetness with some chocolate character. That's followed by some bitterness and definite alcohol presence. The mouthfeel is thick with low carbonation and a bit of warming from the alcohol. This is an interesting beer that while not being absolutely stunning, is still decent and affordable to try out if the price I got it for is any indicator."
"D- I am really enjoying this beer. I would rate it pretty high for drinkability."
"A great example of a coffee stout. This is one I would dfinitely seek out."
"After having seen this brew on the shelves for a while I thought I would give one of Lagunitas offerings a try, plus heard some good things about it on the BN. The brew poured to a dark brown color which was very surprising since this brew is suppose to be a stout. The head as not overly that large and had a real light light tan color. The retention was not that great though what was there id leave some lacing. The aroma has a nice solid coffee aroma that has some coffee highlights and seems to be anchored by a hefty alcohol scent. The flavor at first gives me the impression that the coffee flavors are going to be a little harsh but that thought quickly fades. The coffee flavors are clearly dominant here while being quite smooth. Flavors that I am also getting is chocolate but plays a minor part. Seems to have an ample hopping that I think comes out in the end as there is a nice bitterness, either that or it is from the coffee flavors but I don't think so as it seems to be a little citric. For being a +8% brew the alcohol in the flavor is very well hidden though it does come out a little more as this one warms. I understand that this brew is labeled as a stout but does not seem to have the viscosity that you normally see in this type, seems to lead to a slightly watery feel, though the overall flavors trump that. Overall this brew gets two thumbs up as it is very good, worth additional looks!"
"D - You won't be pounding them, but nothing terribly distracting in this regard."
"This has decent drinkability, would be more drinkable if it didn't come through so hot."
"One of the more coffee flavored beers I've had but somewhat average for an imperial stout."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"D 3.0 - was just okay all around, not a standout in my opinion"
"I got this 22 ounce bottle for $3.99. The ABV says 8.29%, however, and not 7.99%. It pours out very dark brown. Almost black. It churns up a pretty nice tannish and lasting thick head. It has a semi-sweet coffee and chocolate smell to it. The first impression with the taste is sweet coffee with roasted malted barley followed by a somewhat bitter aftertaste (similar to coffee) and a throat-warming alcohol sensation. It's got a nice thick creamy texture and moderate carbonation. Too heavy to drink in any quantity but this 22 ounce bottle is a great start to the beer drinking day."
"Truth be told, I have not had many coffee stouts, but I have had a few, and this one is definitely memorable."
"Drinks a lot easier than the 8% on the label."
"It goes down real smooth I don't think I'll have a problem finishing this 22."
"Overall, this was a decent, easy to drink stout, but not as sweet as the name would imply (or should I say as I was hoping). I would prefer more coffee characteristic."
"This one is lacking what a stout needs, namely some roastiness! I'd take it over some other beers, but as a coffee beer, this one is somewhat of a failure."
"Drinkability is ok. I would have it again but not before trying something new if offered."
"D - A good Imperial Stout that burst with coffee flavors, but doesn't offer a creamy mouthful like other stouts"
"Drinkability: More mild mannered than many coffee stouts out there, but still good. The higher ABV is hidden very well, making this a pleasant sipper. A decent showing from my first Lagunitas."
"D: goes down easily and pleasantly. Not my favorite stout but worthy of a try. Would behappy for a 2nd...if you're buying :)"
"I think this is one of the best stouts I have had on the market and I get excited every time I see it on the market."
"D - Possibly was served too cold at pour, for it did become better with temp. Struck me as too intense for my palate and overwhelmed with coffee. I like coffee & I like beer, though the balance seems to be off with too much coffee flavor. A toffee-like finish is noticeable after several seconds. In addition to this, a coffee ground taste was prevalent. Not so drinkable in my opinion. The coffee used didn't seem to be of high quality and was very acidic. The bitterness might be more due to the coffee and its poor quality than from the hops utilized in brewing the beer. Though the beer balances out better with time, I still found it to be too overwhelmed by coffee and isn't something I would personally seek out again."
"Overall: I thought that it would have been hard to make a below-par Coffee Stout but I really didn't care for this one, on the plus side it was pretty cheap. Can't see myself trying this one again."
"Overall, I am getting more impressed with the beer as I drink it, as the first impression was a little weak. I would certainly have it again."
"The only question left is if I will brave Lagunitas again. At what was I think $3.99 for a bomber, I'll probably give them a try on one more style."
"This Cappuccino Stout by Laguntas reminds me of what an Imperial Porter and a good Doppelbock would be like if blended together to make one brew. Uniquely dark and tangy with a tinge of coffee and a wonderful presense of goodness and yummyness across the nose and palate. Down right drinkable to the point of that 8% catching ya off guard a bit. Nothing wrong with that if ya think you can handle another..."
"Other comments: A pretty good brew. Not sure how much coffee is in this, but hopefully it will not keep me up all night!"
"Bottom Line - a very drinkable, unique stout with a hint of coffee when allowed to warm to room temperature."
"Strangly light brownish pour with a cream head. Roasted aroma of coffee and some malt. Good roasted coffee with some mocha/chocolate. A bit medium bodied, but a pretty serious brew. Low carbonation but not creamy. Pretty straight forward coffee drink, but not really a stout. Not quite sure what to make of this, I feel like there is much unrealized potential here. Almost like they got lost in creating another strong ale forgetting this was supposed to be a stout. Ends up not being poor, but not what it should be."
"The mouthfeel was slightly better, with some of the smokey and light coffee flavors coming out in the mouth. However, a cappuccino doesnt taste like dunkin donuts coffee. Drinkability is average, but again, far too inamicable to finish like a real stout."
"Notes - In general, I thoroughly enjoyed this brew, with it being only the 2nd beer I've sampled that comes close to Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout concerning the characteristics of smoothness and creaminess (Stone's Bitter Chocolate Oatmeal Stout being the 1st). On the whole, a great brew that earned quite a bit of my respect for Lagunitas."
"Overall, a worthy choice for stout lovers and coffee lovers alike. It's quick to punch with bitterness, but it goes away quick enough to remain drinkable through the entire bottle."
"I was really interested in trying to beer because I really enjoyed stouts and the cappuccino addition sounded good. So I gave it a shot because the bar i was at had it on tap. The pour was a very dark brown color. The smell had some interesting aspects such as a coffee and chocolate. Unfortunately once I started to drink the beer I felt it had a strange bitter after taste that I just could not get past. I also didnt really get the strong cappuccino flavor i was hoping for."
"As I finished this beer, I found myself wanting another."
"Incredibly creamy whole milk flavor that leads into a bum rush of bitter coffee and chocolate"
"MF&D - A little thinner than I would have liked, but not bad. Lots of alcohol make this one a sipper."
"Drinks fine, but not the best. Hides it's 8.6% well"
"taste is smooth, malt, dark chocolate, a small touch of coffee, some caramel, a touch of roasted nuts, ends slightly bitter and somewhat dry."
"D - Almost 9% ABV. Not a bad beer but it seems like false advertising. No coffee that I could taste (or smell) and not really a stout. It did get a bit better as it warmed."
"Very good beer from Lagunitas, a distinct Imperial Stout to which I'll gladly return."
"D: This is a decent brew that has some ground to make up in the fields of look and aroma. The shocking part is that the aroma really doesn't kill the taste. The aroma does make me not want another but it wasn't too bad finishing off the glass that I had. Not a bad beer and I will revisit this one later."
"A nice, enjoyable, fun brew from Lagunitas-- i'd just love to see this as a thicker, richer stout as this one is more in the porter realm for me.."
"I get the feeling there was something in the bottle I got that the brewer had not wanted in there (contamination?). I did not downgrade my rating. I think a good bottle of this might be boardering on amazing. Try it if you get a chance."
"This beer is interesting, not sure ill buy it again, but probably wouldnt turn down a bottle if it showed up in front of me."
"Drinkable for an imperial stout, but not necessarily sessionable. My bottle says the ABV is 8.29%. It's not an everyday sort of brew, but great on a cold snowy winter day. I'd have it again."
"Living in Marin County, I fully appreciate how spoiled I am by living down the road from Lagunitas. They really have a knack for producing big, strong brews that make a statement but don't overpower. I haven't met one of their offerings I haven't loved and I'm looking forward to giving this one another try."
"This beer pours a deep brown with some mahogany hues. A small, light tan, quite foamy head with no head retention. Also, no lacing to speak of. Aromas of toasted malt with a sweet caramel scent. Alcohol is notiacble, but not overpowering. Thick flavors of cream, chocolate and toasty malt. There is no cappuccino or coffee flavoring that is noticable. Given that this is a Cappuccino stout, the lack of flavoring on the coffee/cappucino side highly disappointing. Mouthfeel - left a thick, creamy coating. Alcohol is well disguised. It's an ok beer, certainly not a cappucino stout in my opinion. I wouldn't go looking for this beer, nor would I purchase it again."
"Pours a bit more translucent that other imperial stouts; mouthfeel not quite as thick. But that doesn't mean that this limited release is short on taste. The coffee is prominent, as well as chocolate and cream. At 8.9, it sure goes down smoothly. Like all Imperials, let this one warm a bit, and enjoy!"
"This should be a winner with any lover of good coffee and strong beer. Felt like drinking a big, alcoholic Italian mocha."
"A nice coffee stout, not really cappuccino, i just read the article in this month's BA regarding caffiene in beer, and was surprised in how much there is in this one"
"Decent brew overall. Pours a dark brown color that is slightly opaque with no head. Roasted cappuccino taste is very prevalent throughout. Mouthfeel is very thin. Very bitter roasted coffee/cappuccino finish. Would drink again, but wouldn't seek out."
"Just the thing you need to get you going in the morning!"
"The website says 7.99% ABV, but the bottle in front of my says 8.29%"
"This is a darn good beer and a great value at just a few bucks per 22oz. Perfect serving if you're looking to enjoy something full of flavor character and are ready to only have a beer or two."
"Closer to a sweet stout. Pours dark mahogany with very little head. Aroma is coffee and roasted nuts. Taste is very smooth with a light to medium mouthfeel. A lot of coffee, but not overwhelming. Kind of like Speedway Stout's younger sister. A good, smooth beer."
"In the end I expected more coffee flavoring, more head, and more roast."
"Drinkability: A nasty aftertaste is turning me off to coffee beers but since I've only had a couple we'll see, keep the mind open..."
"D - A quality coffee stout, I like it. Despite the 8% ABV, this gave me a decent caffeine jolt, testifying to the amount of coffee in here."
"Pours a dark brown with one inch of tan head that had decent retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. The coffee aroma is surprisingly subdued in this one. Has more of a roasted malt aroma. The coffee comes through more in the flavor. Slightly sweet overall with a coffee bitterness. Some alcohol warming is noticed. The body is a bit watery for a stout. Also a touch overcarbonated. This stout was a bit of a let down. An OK stout but I was expecting much more. Coffee lovers should look elsewhere for their fix."
"Great dessert beer. Serve in place of coffee with chocolate. Light in color and body for an imperial stout. Looks like a porter. Smells like coffee, sweet chocolate and toffee. Tastes like slightly bitter strong coffee. Thickens as it warms and gets better with time as well. Very drinkable for a dessert beer, which is where I would place this. A great beer to serve to those who may have opted for coffee."
"poured a dark garnet brown but was not extremely thick as light easily passed through it. nice medium sized dark head with some nice lacing. Nice coffee and dark malt aroma. Taste was of dark malt with some bitter coffee notes. didn't really get any cappuccino flavor at all.Extremely thin and watery for a stout. A mild disappointment for me a I have enjoyed other lagunitas offerings, or maybe I'm just spoiled because I can't help but compare it to founders breakfast stout which Is readily accessible to me."
"D - delicious, a little heavy, bit overall good drinkability."
"D: On the whole, like many of Lagunitas beers, this is a solid entry. Not the most mind-blowing, but certainly a good, drinkable beer."
"I really wish I knew how old this bottle was so I can tell if freshness has much to do with it."
"Not normally a fan of these ""big"" beers, I did enjoy slowly sipping this one."
"The beer is light in color for a stout and has minimal coffee flavor. The overall taste is bitter and earthy - quite different from other stouts and coffee-flavored stouts I have tried. I likewise hope I just got a bad batch because I have enjoyed other Lagunitas offerings."
"Future outlook: Repeat business likely."
"mouthfeel is smooth, thick, and sweet with a bitter twist, great heavy flavors, alcohol is hidden well"
"D: Worth trying, but not stellar by any means. I was expecting a more robust coffee experience. Not as fragrant, flavorful, or intense as the benchmark for the style: Central Waters' Brewhouse Coffee Stout."
"Pours a clear black color that turns to a dark garnet when held to the light, a 2 finger tan head made up of large and small bubbles with great retention and thick patchy lacing. Aromas of alcohol, raisin, plum, espresso, cinnamon, and brown sugar. Lots of coffee flavor with brown sugar, cinnamon, chocolate, roasted malt with a lemon rind/ bitter espresso finish. Full body, medium carbonation, this is creamy and mouth coating. Every sip has a different flavor come to the front, good drinkability."
"D: I find this beer very enjoyable! Slick as a whistle and as inviting as a burlesque house. I am always in favor of having my two most favorite drinks at once: beer and coffee! A nice brew"
"This may actually be a baltic porter style though."
"D - Awesome and super enjoyable"
"Pours a very dark brown. Thin tan head. Nose is mild and malty coffee. Flavor is robust yet smooth. Bitterness is balanced by a consistent coffee flavor. Not really complex, but thoroughly flavorful. Smooth on liquid and slightly lower on carbonation. Very drinkable and very tasty. And very full of caffeine! This gets me wired!"
"These guys make excellent beers!"
"Overall: I would have rated this higher, but the abv is a little high for an American Stout. Other than that, I really liked this beer. This is a really well done stout and the flavors and aromas are accentuated w/ a few months of aging."
"This beer pours a clear dark, dark brown, but not quite black color. The head is a half an inch in height, and just sits there holding firm. The aroma is of roasted malt, cream, and some burnt malt. The taste is full of roasted malt, hints of dark chocolate, and some faint coffee in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, with a velvety texture and appropriately low carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer, but there are better coffee stouts to be had."
"Poured a dark mahogany brown color with amber highlights. This is a stout?? Looks more like a porter or a doppelbock. Very nice tan colored head leaves some generous lacing. First aroma is a strong dose of hops, light coffee, and some roasted malts. Hints of chocolate are in the background, but it's not much. Very light nose, but we'll see how it goes as it warms. Flavor has a much bigger coffee presence, a little bit of chocolate and cream, almost like coffee flavored ice cream. Dark fruits are showing up in the flavor, but there's a light sour aspect to them. Could this be a bad bottle? There is also a light citic hop note in the background. Slightly sweet at first but a dry, earthy finish. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, average carbonation. I'm not so sure about this one. Not the color, nose or flavor profile that I look for in a stout, let alone a coffee stout, especially one that sits at 8.29% ABV. I was a bit let down by this brew. It's not bad, but it's not as good as I expected from this brewery."
"D: It is definitely a coffee stout with a light body and nice flavors. It is a bit strong and dry for a session brew but it is a nice one and done stout."
"Drinkability is fairly close to incredible. full flavor with rich coffee and cocoa notes that open up beautifully as it warms. The 8.3% abv isn't detectable at all... which could be potentially dangerous. Add in the reasonable pricing, and you've got an impressive beer that's impossible to pass up. Loved it last year, and this year is no different."
"D: Very. Just put down a bomber and no shit I am headed to the liquor store to pick up a few more. This one will be a winter staple as long as it is on the shelf at the liquor store. For the price it is hard to beat."
"The flavor is the aroma liquefied, except for the fact that roasted coffee notes get kicked up a healthy notch. A boozy, dark, fruit-laden warmth washes over the back of the palate, lending itself to a spicy earthen hop presence and a kiss of roasted java. The medium-bodied mouthfeel benefits from a lively carbonation level that jazzes up the palate and makes the coffee come alive, although it does get a bit harsh after half a bottle. Nevertheless, Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout is a winner for stout- and coffee-lovers alike. I will definitely be purchasing this brew again soon."
"I would recommend a 12 oz of this, maybe even to share with a friend, but as time passes, the endearing qualities of this brew overstay their welcome, and you are left with the same thought that Jeffrey Dahmer's mother had, if only I knew then what I know now."
"Pours a nice dark brown with a small frothy head.Aroma is nice and malty, with the coffee notes becoming more noticeable as it warms. Taste is very much a deep dark roasted coffee flavor. Very nice! Mouthfeel has just a bit of syrup feel, and a faint bit of powdery chocolate texture. Drinkability is quite good. ABV isn't too high to knock you back, but do take it a bit easy."
"Medium bodied with a slightly oily texture. Drinkability is good for a relatively high alcohol stout..and 22oz is easy to handle. Overall, definitely another worthy brew from Lagunitas."
"D- This is a bit of a sipper @ 8.29% (per bottle), but it's definitely a nice coffee stout. Give it a shot!"
"THis beer looked beautifully dark with a little bit of head, and gorgeous reddish brown hues on the edges. The aroma was barely there at all with a malty wet cardboard smell. The bitterness of the over charred malt and the burned coffee overwhelmed everything else. It did have a coffee taste to it, but it wasn't a good coffee taste. The finish had a bitterness of boiled vegetables. I thought that more flavor would develop as it warmed, and as my palate adapted to the bitterness, but it remained fairly 1-dimensional."
"A very nice American Stout. One of the most in-your-face coffee beers out there, but still retains the balance that is necessary. Recommended."
"Overall a graceful and poised coffee stout. No rough edges or hardness whatsoever. The dark fruit is reminiscent of an English cream stout. A crackling fire, fleece socks and a couple glasses of this would make a great winter afternoon relaxer."
"Easy to drink and quite enjoyable. While not my favorite, it is very drinkable and was available at a very fair price."
"Drinkability: I could drink this all night if it weren't for the high alcohol content (bottle says 8.29%). After drinking almost the whole 22oz bottle I'm feeling almost euphoric... more so than with other alcoholic drinks. What are you putting in your beers Lagunitas? Actually, I don't want to know, but I like it; keep it up."
"Overall this is a solid beer for the price. There are better out there, but this is worth a shot."
"D- A very decent American Stout. 1 or 2 every now and than would be enough,"
"Unusual. Don't know if it's my fave, but interesting."
"D- This one is confuing. For me its just a tad bit sweet to be a really drinkable beer but 22 oz is easy to finish. One is enough for me. I would drink this again."
"This one was after a long day of drinking at The Trappist in Oakland as a nightcap so my memories are a little hazy. Not going to do a full in depth review. It's no question a coffee stout, but it doesn't taste too strong or like used coffee grounds. Surprisingly dry and not sweet, especially when you consider that most Lagunitas are the opposite. Overall, I thought this a good brew. I was pleasantly surprised"
"Drinkability: This beer went down nicely. I would surely drink this one again, but in a single sitting, I think one or two pints would be enough."
"Woulda liked less carbonation, more coffee and a creamier texture to smooth things out."
"D: Absolutely drinkable and recommended. Though admittedly i know little about the style it went well with a night of reminiscing. For the price I'd like to trade in my morning coffee for a couple of these. And who knows, maybe I'll throw one in the mix every few Fridays."
"Overall, this is worth a try, though there are many better examples of the style to choose from."
"Middle of the road for me. The coffee overpowers most of the stout like flavors. That's probably the point. Still can't go wrong with the under $5 price."
"Drinkability: Again, certainly not a session beer but I wish I had paired it with some food. If you don't like coffee this will kick you in the teeth but otherwise a solid, drinkable beer."
"The drink is full-bodied and perfectly-carbonated with a silky feel. Wonderfully good drinker with no real trace of the 8.3% abv."
"This was a solid stout. Well crafted and highly drinkable, but watch out for the ABV at 8/3%."
"Drinkability - When I poured this one, I was a bit disappointed by the look, but it has redeemed itself from there on out. Great buy I will be revisiting."
"The alcohol presence in this one cuts down on the drinkability a bit, but certainly well worth a try."
"Seems a bit thick in the mouth which does take away from the drinkability slightly. To me, this needs something really sweet."
"I like drinking with friends. I shared this one with a friend. We drank at the same time - he spoke first ""Wow - that's like eating a second meal"". As most stouts are. There's nothing light about cappuccino or stout. If it weren't dark - I'd be worried. Stout lovers will like this beer. Didn't knock me out - but I'm glad I tried it."
"This poured a dark, clear mahogany with no head. It smelled like fresh coffee beans with a hint of barley malt and mint. It tasted like powerful ground coffee beans with a bit of milk sweetness. It was slightly thick with no carbonation, and had a bitter coffee aftertaste. Overall this has a very one-dimensional flavor, although it was very clean and drinkable. It could have used a bit more balance or depth, although I still enjoyed it. But if you don't like coffee, definitely avoid this beer."
"D - A good after dinner/night cap beer. Light in some parts while heavy in others. No a beer for people who aren't too fond of coffee."
"Poured a dark brown color with a quarter inch light tan head. I expected something quite a bit darker considering this is a coffee flavored stout. The beer had a light aroma of roasted coffee and not much else. Taste was coffeeish with a light roasted malt flavor and just a touch of alcohol. The finish was slightly sweet. Mouthfeel was light in the palate and thin in body. Overall, I was disappointed in this beer. I expected something more aggressive in taste, aroma and body. Instead it was quite boring and nothing especially memorable. One and done for me."
"Kudos Lagunitas!"
"D- the finish and after taste on this one is much better than i was expecting. a great bargain brew, one bomber was enough but ill try to revisit before its gone."
"M + D: Carbonation seemed maybe a bit sharp to my palate, though it does mellow out a little bit and become a little more creamy. Not too bad a brew - it seems to have been a decent choice to come home to after a long day at work."
"This is a solid Cappuccino beer. Very drinkable, but very different than what I expected. With first pour it looked very average, and didn't look that special. I smelled it and I was not impressed. The taste is where it earns most of its points. It is a nice semi-sweet stout w/ a slight coffee backbone to back it up. Not overly coffee flavored like some stouts I see these days. The mouthfeel I felt could of been a little better. A tad bit thicker maybe. Overall, it is very drinkable for under $5 for a bomber. Give it a try. Lagunitas=quality."
"Drinkability> Perhaps I was just drinking this in good company but I enjoyed it quite a lot. Perhaps I was just really excited to find a Lagunitas that I wasn't just 'indifferent' to."
"Now granted, I tried Beergeek Breakfast for the first time not too long ago and I think this unfairly altered my expectations for coffee stouts, but this beer didn't blow me away. The body was thick and creamy, the aroma was sweet cocoa. I really get much coffee or espresso from this thing, mostly cocoa. Still, a nice stout I will surely try again as I only had a sample, maybe 4 ounces."
"D: One bomber was enough of this for me to say I had it. This would be a nice after dinner beer, pretty nice to drink especially as a one time beer."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Worth a try if it's sold in your area, but don't go out of your way to get it."
"D: I can barely finish this first bottle. There might be a market for this, but the taste is definitely something either loved from the beginning or acquired with TIME. There are considerably better stouts out there. This is nothing impressive."
"Pours a solid black with a tan head that laces fairly nicely as the level drops. Nice coffee/malty aroma. Taste is extremely pleasant. Roast coffee flavor, with a fair amount of sweetness and malt presence. Very little bite of alcohol; this is a smooth drinking stout. Highly drinkable; would make a nice breakfast choice on the right winter morning :)"
"this brew pours up a solid schwartz color with a big bubbly tan head. some decent retentive lacing. the nose is roasted malts, chocolate, coffee bean, subtle sweet vanilla, a very sweet aroma. the taste is a super roasty flavor, slight alcohol, roasted coffee, wood, full bodied, frizzy carbo,. another unique one from Lagunitas"
"This beer does a good job does an excellent job with a difficult task. The coffee threatens to overwhelm the flavor of the beer, but Lagunitas did a great job balancing out the flavor with an excellent stout. The beer pours a dark brown but not quite thick enough for my ideal. The nose is thick with roasted malt and strong espresso. The flavor chimes in with a good deal of chocolate, a ton of coffee and the malt heavy stout. It gets a bit sweet, but I'm not sure it could be any better with all of the flavors. The mouthfeel could be thickened up, but it's not a big deal. I could drink a lot more of this beer than I had initially thought. It's really well done considering the strength of flavors present."
"A very tasty beer with some interesting balance and overall nice character. Creamy body and higher abv make it difficult to drink a lot of, but sips very nicely as a coffee stout. I really liked this one."
"Drinkability: The strong coffee taste and sweetness completely offset the 8% ABV in this beast. Enjoyable."
"I love strong coffee and I love stouts. This is a good beer! Pours like a stout...dark brown with reddish tinges. Light tan head that seeps down into a nice ring around the glass. Lacing is minimal and off white. First whiff is like the fist smell of a fresh cup of joe. Very intense with almost no other aroma. Tastes great. Very much like a coffee stout should. Coffee hitas the tongue first followed by the bitterness of chocolate malt then the bitter aftermath of unsweetened coffee. Mouthfeel is OK for what I was expecting. Probably a little too bitter for mass consumption."
"D - Great beer. I love stout's and this is a great one."
"Drinkability: This is one exciting stout. All profiles conclude that I'll be buying this beer again. With a 22-oz. bottle and 8.3% ABV, this is a good beer to share or drink over an extended period."
"www.theviceblog.com"
"this one is not real thick or bitter, it pours a nice hevy brown bordering on black color. the smell is coffee and hops with a carmal roast, and that is exactly the taste that comes across to me. this one is good but is not as good as terrapin's wake and bake coffee oatmeal imperial stout."
"Overall, a good stout, well balanced, could use some tweaking here and there, but definitely in the higher tier of stouts. One bottle is quite drinkable, but not something to drink on a regular basis."
"My notes on this were minimal, but my pleasure in the drinking was not. Very nice coffee stout. I'll return to this one again!"
"This would make a fine morning indulgence for those without a job or a life...but boy is it tempting. I questioned my sanity for busting this out on a muggy, sticky, hot evening, but it's totally doing the trick. A super-enjoyable stout, completed nicely by the label's Ode To Coffee, a take on the famous Psalm 23 (from the Bible, you Heathens!). Recommended."
"D: A very nice, big stout, but nothing remarkable. For $3.25 a bomber an excellent purchase, but would not seek this out again."
"Right off the bat, this one is so much better than their Imperial Stout. It actually reminds me a lot of the Bushwakker Pickard's Oatmeal Cream Stout; good body, initial sweetness, and tasty roasted finish. The coffee doesn't really dominate (if it wasn't called Cappuccino Stout, I'm not sure I could say for sure that coffee was added to the beer), but it is there. I think what makes the coffee blend in so well with the base beer is the low hopping (30IBUs) and use of crystal malts. The end result is a fantastic beer that I will most certainly seek out in the future."
"Tastes of sweet roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and hop bitterness. Very drinkable cause I love a good coffee stout."
"On the taste front though, the cappuccino comes out a lot more, from beginning through the middle, if not longer. As it progresses, the roasted malt characteristics come out more, the bitterness doesn't subside so mush as coast, and finishes dry and astringent. The body is decent, not really full, but better than medium, but definitely smooth, which just a touch of carbonation. In all, by far not the best coffee infused beer I've had, but still pretty darn tasty. Can't say Lagunitas has ever disappointed me."
"Definitely worth the cost."
"Overall - I found this decently enjoyable. Quite different from some of the other stouts I've had. Could do as an after dinner/dessert beer with cheesecake. I personally am not a fan but I'm sure others enjoy it more than I do."
"Not as heavy as expected, which makes for quite a drinkable effort. Could use a little more synergy and hop presence. Overall, a solid offering."
"I'll admit, I'm not a big coffee fan, and I've had my fix of this stuff halfway through the bottle already. However I've been around the block enough times to know that this is a pretty damn good cappuccino stout, and will highly recommend it to everyone I know who's into that sort of flavour experience. Very decent job on this blend."
"22 oz bottle. Pours opaque black with 1 cm of tan head that diminishes somewhat quickly. Aroma of coffee dominates but some chocolate comes through as it continues to warm. Initial flavor dominated by the bitter coffee. Flavor more balanced towards the end as the chocolate comes in to make it more even. Aftertaste is still slightly bitter and lasts. Light carbonation, limited lacing, medium body, and some alcohol noted. Drinkability is pretty good, better than some other coffee stouts and better than its current score suggests."
"Very clean and smooth for a stout, and very drinkable. Worth a try."
"D - flavors blossom as it warms, sip slowly and enjoy."
"HV"
"With all of Lagunitas's humorous beer names they should have went with ""wake and bake stout"" but I guess they wanted to keep it to the point. Pours a rich opaque brown with a frothy head. Smells of dark roasted coffee, hint of baker's chocolate and a kiss of toffee. Taste like it's fresh from Starbucks with black coffee upfront and a smooth, drying finish with a good hop balance. I think I'm getting a caffeine buzz."
"Cappuccino Stout is a nice balance between coffee and stout. It's definitely good but doesn't blow my doors off like some of Lagunitas' other offerings (I'm not a big coffee drinker though)."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a glass and received a thick, syrupy looking beer that resembled cola in both stature and color. A decent head that stuck around for a minute, minor lacings. The smell is dominated by the coffee malt (it is a cappucino stout, after all), so it is not bad but not intricate. However, the brew is also dominated bythe coffee malt and it is great. The body is medium to full and slightly syrupy, but this stout is coffeeish and a tad sweet with no drying out of the tongue by the malt. One of the smoothest stouts I've ever had. Can't desribe it too much more, I mean there might be caramel or honey in there that would account for the texture and sweetness I picked up, and it isn't like the hop presence is real noticeable. A great beer to try if you haven't, stout fan or not, but not sessionable due to price and high ABV. Still, I am glad I got to have one."
"M/D: Full bodied, a little towards the lighter side, low carbonation. Pretty good drinkability. Very easy to drink, not really mind blowing and there are better examples of ""coffee"" stouts out there, but a good beer regardless."
"This is the first Lagunitas beer i've had, and after hearing a lot of good things about this brewery, I have to say I'm pretty disappointed. As a lover of both good beer and good coffee, I really like coffee stouts if they are done well, which they are usually not. This one was far to bright and acidic tasting for a stout; not a lot of roasty or creamy flavors, just a lot of acidity from the Columbian coffee, probably in conjunction with citrusy American hops. The choice of coffee might be the problem here; a darker roast like a french or espresso roast usually translate better to stouts. Overall I'd avoid this one."
"Carbonation is just about perfect, body is a little thinner than it could be, alcohol is nowhere to be tasted."
"Not a knockout, but a good solid coffee stout."
"650 ml cap stout. Though the abv on here says 7.99, this bottle says 8.3%. As always a nonsensical story on the side, this time biblical in nature. Always good reading, especially after two or three glasses of the stuff. Poured into my glass a lovely ebony hue, with a great, healthy looking bed of light brown/off red head. Lacing is spotty but thick. Delicious looking. Aroma at first struck me with sweet coffee, or damp cardboardish vanilla like notes. Unexpected, this. I mean after that and as the beer warmed I got some extremely sweet coffee notes, but the initial hit was a tad...underwhelming, shall we say. Pretty one-sided coffee/root beer aroma, but that's to be expected...or is it? Again a strange herbal tinge as I take the first sip. Almost medicinal, like a brief hint of Jagermeister or something. Good news is this a tasty coffee beer. The coffee taste is not souring or distracting, but rather complementing. Not the best I've tasted, but good. Decent bitterness and actually, conversely, a deep maple syrup finish. There isn't a hell of a lot else to describe in the taste. But it gets the job done. Mouthfeel was a little lacking, seemingly due to not enough carbonation for me personally. Drinkability? I'm the wrong person to ask, because coffee stouts/porters have never been my preferred style. For me, drinkability is good enough at one bottle. Worth a try, all. Worth a try."
"Drinkability: I'm down. For coffee lovers especially, with lots of residual bitter coffee flavors, cappuccino sweetness, and much orginality, this is a pretty great and original stout. Another kudos to Lagunitas for bringing it, and something I'd certainly try again."
"Overall, a fantastic beer."
"Drinkability: one a night...strong"
"Pours very dark with no light coming through when held up in front of a lamp. Nice ½"" head with a tan color. Smells great, with hints of coffee, chocolate, and a hint of alcohol (which makes sense when you realize it's 8.3%). Doesn't taste as strong as it smells but definitely coats the palette with a coffee flavor. It reminds me of coffee-heath ice cream. Medium-to-heavy bodied beer with a decent drinkability. It's good, but there are several other milk-style stouts I'd chose over it in the future. Rogue's Chocolate Stout to name one. I'd buy this again, but wouldn't put it on tap."
"A very enjoyable beer. Too bad it's a limited release. Another good one from Lagunitas."
"Drinkable by itself, I'm not sure it woul;d go with much other than a rich, darkly chocolaty dessert. Not something I'd reccomend repeated pints of, but I wish I had saved it for the end of the night when I get home from work, as I'm quite sure it would really hit the spot then. I'd really like to see some more coffee stouts make landfall here. At least until then, I'll buy this again."
"D: A great rich cappuccino stout that is hearty, full bodied with a great complexity of flavors."
"D - Very nice probably wouldn't have too many in a night but definately woeth a try."
"What truly makes the Cappuccino Stout a winner is that the taste has been crafted to highlight not just a great stout but also the brilliant infusion of coffee into this stout in a way that is unparalleled by some other brewers."
"Pours a deep mahogany brown, almost sable and barely translucent, with a very thick, tan, fine-bubbled head that hangs around a while. Aroma is rich, like well-roasted coffee, smoky and mouth-watering. Coffee flavor dominates the taste, and there is a surprising amount of hoppy bitterness. Smooth, rich, has a nice ""thick"" feel."
"Based on its statistics, it's basically a Double Stout, but one would be hard pressed to guess it. The body carries a fair amount of empty-feeling weight. For it's strength, it's quickly drinkable, but in long run, it lacks the depth and overall argreeability to really crave more."
"My first from this brewery and it's enough to make me explore them further."
"Not a bad coffee stout I had better but I would drink it again"
"Verdict: Cappuccino Stout is a big, bitter, and bold Stout, but unfortunately it's just a little muddled and forgettable. Just keep in mind that this new recipe, you really have to watch out for the big alcohol punch."
"Popped open a 22 oz bottle of this to finish off last Saturday night. Poured into into two glasses. Large fluffy head, with a dark black color to the body. Smell was of roasted barley and coffee. As for the taste, I don't know where I stand on this beer. Granted, it was quite a unique stout, so points for that. But was that really what a cappuccino stout tastes like? Tasted more like milk and coffee syrup blended into a stout. I was hoping for a more refined flavor, something a bit more memorable. A bit too sweet for what I was looking for."
"D - Very good drinkability. Impressed."
"Overall a solid coffee-Impy Stout but certainly not in the league of say an Alesmith Speedway"
"It is well-balanced and is quite drinkable. I could handle three or four of these 22oz bombers in an evening."
"I may be able to finish this beer, the Worcestershire and burnt coffee are faint enough to notice the beers other redeeming qualities."
"Drinkability - not quite what I had hoped for, but it's tasty and if offered, I'd have it again. 11/18/08 - though I want to edge the taste up .5, I will settle for a kick here in drinkability. Age a bottle for comparison and see if you don't like the overall balance better."
"22oz brown bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a deep brown/black with one finger of off white head. Coffee and cocoa in the aroma. Big coffee flavor dominates. Medium bodied. There is some hop bitterness in the middle. Kind of a one dimensional beer. The base beer didn't come through very much."
"This is a very drinkable brew, although at 7.99% ABV you might only be able to have a couple at a time. I know the one 22oz bottle that I enjoyed gave me a nice mellow beer buzz."
"Nice but far from essential."
"Mouthfeel is very thin and lifeless. Takes away from the rest of the beer. Drinkability is helped by the thin mouthfeel, but this isn't a beer I'd grab again. At $3-$4 it isn't a big loss. Coffee taste is there and enjoyable. I'd like to give some of the coffee they used a try....as coffee."
"The flavor matched the aroma, not everpowering, but with a hint of malt and a hint of coffee. While it obviously cant be tasted, the caffeine was there, as I had no problem drinking the bomber and staying up well past me bedtime, all in order to watch Tina Fey make her return to SNL. The beer was better than the episode."
"Dark, dark brown to black pour with a big lasting tan head. Smell is a nice roasted malt and coffee smell, but a noticeable metallic smell as well, as this beer is probably a year old. Smell is not too big, but noticeable. Smooth, mouthfeel with light carbonation, a nice roastiness and cappuccino flavor on into the finish and aftertaste. Some light bitterness. This would be quite a bit better fresh, but still is pretty decent. Nice coffee stout that is not overly hopped."
"Pours a jet black with a creamy tan head that lingers for several minutes. Aroma of roasted coffee and dark chocolate. Taste is spot on, rich coffee flavor without the burnt/bitter flavor that seems to plague a lot of coffee inspired brews. Mouthfeel is creamy and coats the tongue. Sweetness is held in check and is at the perfect balance for this brew. Excellent Stout, one that I would like to see available all the time instead of a limited version."
"D: Good drinkability. Great mouthfeel complimented by an excellent taste."
"Easy drinker. As a life long third shifter, I have enjoyed many cups of coffee, stronger the better. As a BA I have enjoyed many good beer, more creative the better. This is a blend of both. I hope they release this one a few more times. I know there is that rule about drinking before noon, but this bends that. Good beer for breakfast."
"Pours a deep brown almost opaque black with a decent light tan head that diminishes to a ring and leaves spotty lacing. Aroma is certainly reminiscent of cappuccino, both espresso and cream are present. The taste is heavier on the roastiness, but the cappuccino is right behind. The beer is on the light side of medium and the stated 8.3% abv is very well hidden. This is a very enjoyable brew on to wrap up what will hopefully be the last really cold day this winter."
"D - Friggin' great, what can I say? This is just a flavor combo that pushes my inner beer geek buttons in a good way when done well. I found myself finishing this bomber quickly on an empty stomach which isn't my M.O. I like the subtleties and the seemingly effortless blend of all the flavors means this is a Very well crafted ale IMO. I loved the roast taste it made me want coffee from Sebastopol, CA and the stout was too smooth to be believed @ 8%. I recommend it highly, just wish it wasn't limited release only. This ale went well w/ my teriyaki rice."
"Overall, it's a little better than I expected and for the price of $2.99 for a bomber I'd say it's a good deal."
"Med to heavy bodied and the correct soft effervescence. Reminds me of the gentleman pugilist enjoying a smoke in a leather chair at the country club. You sense the knock-out punch underneath the tweed coat, but appreciate the well-mannered conversation."
"Dark mahogany with huge light tan head and big lace. Citrus hops and alcohol malt aroma. Solid bodied with deep coffee malt and crisp lemon hops bitterness. Smooth, and fair drinkability for the style. Sweet and bitter in a smooth mix. Very enjoyable, another Lagunitas masterpiece."
"1 Pint, 6 Fl Oz brown bottle copped from Buy Rite on Oak Tree in South Plainfield... ""Ale Brewed With Columbian Coffee"" on the logo sticker along with a ""Limited Release"" title... as far as the appearance is concerned, the brew pours a jet-black, ebony hue, with an impressive reddish-tan frothy head that left apparent lacing... smell is strongly suggestive of cocoa, malts, and espresso... the beer possesses a strong flavor that does well to complement the attractive aroma, with dark lattee, coffee, espresso, caramel, and a noticeable sugared and fig taste... the flavor is very aggressiv on this one, and bursts through with powerful cappuccino essences... an excellent brew from Lagunitas - one of the better ones I've sampled from this California brewery... this one is terrific in the aroma and taste, and is a top-notch representation of the style... the hefty 7.99% ABV is well masked behind a rich, creamy, and thick conglomeration of intricate flavors and smells... Excellent stuff... Definitely recommended..."
"Served in a nonic. Poured an extremely dark opaque brown. Two-fingered tan head subsided gradually into a thin layer of foam. Some lacing, but thin and inconsistent adherence. Strong scent of coffee, malt and molasses or brown sugar. Taste similar to nose but with a bit of a pronounced coffee grounds taste at the finish; not unpleasant, but just lingers a little (similar to the Bells Java Stout I just reviewed, but not as overpowering). Mouthfeel was very effervescent and tingly on the tongue, although a bit watery. Alcohol was very well hidden. I really enjoyed this brew and would purchase it regularly if more widely available in RI. It would have been outstanding if a little more full-bodied."
"Nice beer,I didnt know if I would like it.I would recommend this to coffee heads that get Lagunitas beers.Cheers Lagunitas"
"Drinkable? I've killed a bomber by myself before without much trouble, though in general I'd think of it as one just as well shared. For that reason, I'd like to see it in 12-ouncers if they ever decide to make it again."
"D: Very good. This went down pretty quickly, with no evidence of the 7.99 ABV to slow me down."
"D- Good and I wish I was in a better coffee stout mood. This is really good and I'm not appreciating it enough. I really like coffee, tho this isn't my usual style. Still, wish I had more."
"D: More balanced toward hops than many stouts I had but this was a big plus. Anyone who doubts the appropriateness of citrus character together with roasty coffee (I did at first) should try espresso with the lemon peel soaked in it for a minute. Serve this with French Toast at breakfast or apple pie a la mode for dessert."
"D- mmm delicious. I really enjoy this one."
"Overall, not a bad brew, but i've had better Lagunitas. Nothing very exceptional."
"D: Tasty brew and I'll have no trouble finishing this bomber."
"D - A little too heavy to be a session beer. One or two would be okay, but three would be hard to do."
"For a beer named after a type of coffee, I was expecting to be hit over the head with coffee flavors, however, the beer was pretty well balanced. No more coffee flavor than any number of ""regular"" US stouts. Pretty good beer none the less."
"I would drink moire of these, but would probably opt for other stouts -- like mine."
"A good coffee stout worthy of a try!!!"
"Worth checking out if you like the coffee stouts that every brewer seems to play with these days. This one has more personality than most."
"Feels good on the tongue and tastes more like an after dinner drink or a good breakfast beer."
"Overall a very nice stout and especially one for coffee fans."
"So, do you take sugar in your coffee? if no it's an A, if yes, it's a B-. Personal preference dictates balance in this situation. Overall, whatever your preference, this is a beer worth trying. We'd get it agian."
"Pours a not quite opaque shade of dark brown with some slight ruby highlights in the light. Generous amounts of off-white head is formed. Aroma is full of sweet coffee syrup, and just a touch of roastiness. Not what you would expect from a stout; I would imagine this will be lighter than most. On the palate, it first comes across as almost thin and a bit watery for a stout. The coffee flavor is pronounced but not overboard. Overall, I would say this is a bit underwhelming and a disapointment coming from this brewery. Bells and Southern Tier make much better coffee stouts than this."
"I had high hopes for this beer, but it had a little too much coffee/ muddy texture than what I expected. Don't get me wrong it was decent. It just seemed to be a bit overkill. Maybe that I like coffee porters better than stouts. This stout was a bit too thick and not too carbonated. Not a bad brew, but I have had others that were better."
"Again, nothing overtly wrong just not my cup of te...eh cappuccino stout."
"D- drinkable, enjoyable and creative. I wouldn't chase this beer, but i do think its a great example of what you can do with beer"
"A big American Stout; bold in flavor and texture. The complexities of the intense flavors make this a tough session brew, but worth a try."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Very good, perhaps underrated beer from Lagunitas. I've been a big fan of their other offerings I've tried, and this is no different. They definitely succeeded in pulling off the cappuccino idea. I've got to get up to Sebastopol and try some Hard Core Coffee."
"D: like anything from Lagunitas...its extremely drinkable."
"Overall- a nice stout, worth picking up again, would be a good beer to finish a rich desert with"
"This is a great beer if you like coffee stouts, or even if you just like stouts. The coffee flavor is quite prominent, but this beer has a lot more going for it than just coffee. I don't remember what I paid for the bomber, but I'm pretty sure it was less than five dollars, making it another great deal from Lagunitas. Definitely pick this up if you're a fan of such beers."
"Poured from bomber, about what it should be ... light head, thins out after a while. Smells delicious. Tastes even better. The same sweetness as in the Brown Shugga (sp?), but with plenty of bitterness to balance. I'm not sure if the sweetness is what makes it cappuccino instead of coffee, but it's working. I don't like gimmicky beers, and I generally don't like sweet beers--and, for that matter, Lagunitas has let me down a lot lately, but this is a true winner. I could drink this forever."
"Overall- Very impressed. Not much for coffee, but love the coffee brews in the winter time. It has gotten cold here today and this hits the spot!"
"As a note my 24 oz. bottle listed a 8.3 % AC. In the bottle smells of sweet and roasted malt, coffee and a hint of cinnamon. Pours to a very dark brown with a creamy tan head. Taste is mostly roasted malt with a coffee background and a delicious tart bitterness that finishes cleanly. The finish is silky, with the warming of the AC present. The mouthfeel is very creamy and the carbonation is low but perfect. This is a very complex and flavorful brew. Incredibly enjoyable. I would look for again."
"Good finish, real easy to drink."
"Served at cellar temperature, into a pint glass, from a twenty two ounce bottle. Poured out a deep brown, just on the brink of black. Two fingers of thick, creamy, coffee brown head formed. Head slowly settled into a thick gob in the glass, and left tons of thick clingy lace behind. Smell was of creamy milk chocolate, bitter burnt coffee, sweet roasted/toasted malts. A bit of toffee and caramel round out the nose nicely. Huge coffee and sweet chocolate hit the tongue first, with some roasted malts, and more caramel and toffee. Just a bit of dark fruit is buried in the background. The 8.3% alcohol went unnoticed, and there was little carbonation. Mouthfeel was a bit thin but mouth coating. Awesome drinkability."
"D: Fairly drinkable. The bitterness cuts it down a little bit. The lack of a super thick body makes it more drinkable. If it had a thick body it would be hard to drink with all the bitterness. No hint of the ABV. I had this on tap twice a month ago or so. The first time it was amazing the second not so much. Like most beers seek it out on tap if you can."
"d- ok drinkablility. I really enjoyed this one, I had it at the end of the night. I would love to go back to it to give another taste."
"o -- decent coffee stout, I like it but if you can get your hands on some coffee bender I like it a lot better."
"Pours a dark brown, almost black from the bottle with a thick tan head that sticks to the sides of the glass. It has a very rich roasted grain smell with some sweetness from sugar and a hint of coffee in the aroma. The taste is really good with a very thick and rich base of roasted malts and layering flavors of chocolate, coffee, and sugar. It really blends well together and has a very smooth and rich mouthfeel. It is a higher gravity beer so it is kind of hard to drink more than 1, since they come in pints."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, however, would be better if it featured the flavor that it is named after. This beer comes across a bit muddled as all of the flavors seem to battle for dominance. Not the most balanced beer around. Decent stout, not a great coffee stout."
"dark brown with ruby highlights/feet. tan head has poor retention but leaves some nice lace. nose is of light roast coffee - not dark roast espresso like the name would lead you to expect - with hints of cream and sugar, and a faint roasty malt and hop scent. not big and strong and robust as i was hoping for. taste was almost the same. kind of a let down really. light roast with some malty tastes, some sweet tastes, and a little bitter bite. mouthfeel was thin, not thick and chewy like a nice big stout usually is, or a cappuccino even, for that matter. this is the first time i've ever wished i had actually not spent the money on a lagunitas product. maybe if larry bell or founders didn't make such damn good stouts, this wouldn't have seemed so weak to me, but they do, and it did. not so hard to drink, but i won't be revisiting this one."
"D: a hefty stout with some good complexity, but still quite drinkable"
"Lagunitas Brewing Company's Cappuccino Stout poured a ruby color that was translucent and clean. The beer had a one finger head with an off-white color that left lacing down the sides of the glass, but thinned as I drank the pint. The smell was a mixture of roasted barley and subtle coffee notes. The taste was similar to the smell, but had a slight alcohol aftertaste. Neither the coffee nor the roasted malts stood out in this brew making it seem like the flavors did not blend well. The flavor is average for any other coffee stout I have had, the boost of alcohol makes it a different stout but the flavors were not powerful enough to overcome the taste of the added octane. If you like coffee stouts, it is worth a try if you find it at a good price. Otherwise, this bottle wasn't bad, but also was nothing special."
"D - This one's a little out of whack. Coffee is missing, when it;s advertised as a cappucino stout. Some other flavors seem wickedly out of balance."
"D - not bad. This isn't Terrapin Wake-n-Bake or the Real Ale Coffee Porter, but it's good and I'd definitely say try it. Will enjoy finishing it off."
"D: A very drinkable stout, it's smooth although not all that complex. A decent stout but there are many better ones out there. I'd like to see a stronger coffee profile from a beer that calls itself a cappuccino stout."
"Wow. This beer is so potent and rich, it's really hard to finish. The astringency, bitterness, grapefruit, and burnt grains really limits it's drinkability. I can barely finish half a bottle, so it's a good thing I just bought this vacuum bottle sealer. I'll have to finish the rest tomorrow."
"The beer was ink black wit a thin, nearly non-existent head. I detected a slight roasted aroma before the first taste. The beer had a decent roasted barley flavor with the usual bitter, toasted undertones. The roasted flavor dominates at the top and back of the mouth, with not much to light-up the taste buds on the tongue. I can't say I disliked this beer, because I didn't, but it wasn't really noteworthy like some of the other Lagunitas beers. It had a nice, pleasant aftertaste with some residual alcoholic warmness. A nice effort."
"This is one robust and flavorful stout. It's isn't the most complex stout ever, but it is loaded with flavor making it a real malt bomb. This one is a winner for malt lovers. Recommended."
"burnt coffee after taste. $6.99 for a 22oz bottle from Haggens Beaverton, OR."
"Notes - Quite good and better than last year's batch from what I remember. The coffee character is strong but I'm impressed with the fresh, aromatic quality of it."
"Drinkability is pretty good, drinks like a huge imperial stout but is a bit lower then average at 8.3, with a nice touch of cappuccino providing another layer of depth."
"This has always been one of my, if not my, favorite stouts. The more subtle, by comparison, coffee notes make this beer much better than most coffee brews. Its dangerously drinkable for its girth. I could definitely knock back a few of these with out problem."
"Overall a nice dry , high ABV offering."
"Ummm - WOW! Sure the coffee is there but there's also a dry chocolate flavor that dominates too. Not much of a head but a nice creamy mouth feel. Exceptional and very very unique flavor roasted and not too sweet. Very little bitterness but I recommend this to those you enjoy coffee -- remember when Red Hook's stout was made with Starbucks coffee -- this is similar but 10x better."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 22oz. bomber. The beer pours a dark brown, forming a 1/2 inch creamy tan head. Medium rings of lace stick to the glass. The aroma is less coffee based than expected, with more emphasis on the roasted malt, which isnt really that bad. The taste follows a similar pattern. Strong roasted malts up front, followed by a good amount of chocolate, and then ending with a light creamy coffee/cappuccino flavor. The flavor is quite enjoyable, but again, not like I expected from a stout labeled as a ""cappuccino stout."" Thick mouthfeel coats the inside of the mouth, leaving a thick aftertaste. Decent flavor, slightly above average abv., and good mouthfeel, make this an enjoyable and drinkable stout. Overall, not quite what I expected, but when viewing this as just another American Stout, I have to say it is definitely above average. Worth trying!"
"D- Another bang-up Limited Release from Lagunitas, this is one big bold stout with a jolt of West Coast hops, the alcohol is far from mild and can detract from the overall drinkability but this is a wonderful overall entrant in this category"
"The bottom line: Cappuccino Stout isn't a mouth ripping, soul crushing stout by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a pleasant, smooth drinking winter beer at a remarkably low price. It's not big enough to be one of my gold medal favourites, but for a standard stout, as opposed to an Imperial, this is very tasty stuff and I will definitely be picking it up again."
"The aftertaste is a bit strong and lasting but this is a good tasting beer."
"D- Not very coffeeish for a coffee beer. At least the alcohol was hidden well."
"D - Not many stouts of this caliber are session, and most can get old over one glass. I like this one, though. Tasted coffee for hours after. Yum."
"Robust in flavor, but moderately bodied. Somewhat thinner in texture for the style; which is not necessarily bad. Not low gravity, but not syrupy either. The mouthfeel certainly fits the flavor. Moderate/high carbonation makes for a clean finish that still allows some flavor to linger."
"This was poured from a bomber that I was given half of. I was given my half a day after it was opened and re-sealed, thus the reason you get no head at all. Body is like a black hole, letting no light thru. Nose warns of syrupy sweetness and soft coffee and coco tones. Super smooth on first sip much like cold coffee. Almost tastes like a Yahoo chocolate drink if you have had it. Overall almost taffy like sweetness and realatively thin mouthfeel for the style. Slight thickness and bitter tangle on the finish. Not bad but I will try again a little fresher next time."
"22oz bomber poured into an imperial pint glass. Pours a dark black color with a light tan head that has good retention and lacing. The aroma is dark roasted malts, and an explosion of coffee flavors and some hops. The taste is much like the aroma with roasted malts and a good amount of bitter coffee flavors in the finish. Overall, this is a very nice stout that is not lacking in the flavor department. Recommended."
"Overall, this is a brew I wish Lagunitas would keep around for the whole year. When it does hit Boise, there are always a mess of other seasonals and winter brews that catch my interest, thus limiting my ability to stock up on it for the year ... Though, this brew (and most Lagunitas) kicks the hell out of value. Lagunitas is a shifty but still great brewing company and this brew is not my favorite, but definately up there."
"I like it, try it once if you enjoy the style. If not, you wont like it."
"D: This is a solid stout - not spectacular, but very drinkable and very enjoyable. The hoppy notes were quite unexpected, but blended very nicely."
"Cappuccino Stout pours a very dark brown with a touch of ruby around the edges and a thick, tan head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. There is a very nice aroma, chocolate and coffee both being prominent. There is an appropriately thick and silky mouthfeel, but the carbonation is slightly prickly. I get quite a bit of the hops up front, a touch of citrus, but really more grassy. There is some chocolate flavors toward the middle and then bang, the coffee comes in hard. I find a lot of coffee beers taste like green pepper to me, thankfully, this one does not. Very good. Definitely worth a try."
"black color. boney/tanish head. very malty nose. And the taste does match the nose. Although there are definite grassy hint, even dare I say hints of mint, this is a malty brew. A full bodied brew. You can detect the coffee from the beginning, but it isn't overpowering. There is, however, a lot of flavor here. very creamy mouth feel. Overall, a great brew, one of the better I have seen in the category."
"In the past I haven't been much of a Lagunitas fan, but their Cappuccino stout really caught my attention. The intense acidic coffee flavor and clean feel really caters to my palate. I love this time of brew season. All the winter brews are coming out or are already out, this a good example of what's to come this season from all breweries, excellent and flavorful brews. Enjoy"
"Drinkability- For the price and availability this Coffee Stout cant be beat. Sure, its not on par with the greatness of Founders BS or Bells Java Stout but it still has its place. Definitely worth picking up if you stumble across it!"
"Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side with moderate carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer. Almost too drinkable."
"D-Awesome flavor for a stout or coffee lover. This is a little less intense as Founders BS, but it is still extremely drinkable."
"d-a bottle is good enough, its a big bottle"
"Taste was mostly of roasted malts and coffee but there was a real mellow after taste that was enjoyable. As far as mouthfeel, I don't think I could desrcribe it any better than the last person. Its ""chewey"" but somehow light. Not sure exactly how to describe it. Overall a good beer and would drink it again."
"The limited release of the Cappuccino Stout poured a dark black with a nice foam head that left some sea foam lacing on the side the glass. I did not see a freshness date. The aroma was dominated by the smell of coffee. I tasted the deep roasted malts with the coffee in the finish. The mouthfeel was long lasting and savory and the chewiness of the brew satisfied. Very enjoyable drink, I wish I would have bought two."
"Pours coffee black with a slow rising tan colored head that will creep up on you and overflow if you're not careful. A solid wash of sticky lacing coats the inside of the glass as the foam recedes at a steady pace. The aroma is of roasted coffee, crayon, caramel malt and something resembling dandelion. The taste is just as advertised. Very strong cappuccino flavor that is actually better than I had expected. That dandelion character is in there as well, and I find that to be enjoyable too. Sweeter up front and then finishes with a pretty strong coffee/baker's chocolate bitterness. The alcohol is imperceptible behind all this flavor. The mouthfeel is watery in comparison to a lot of the other big stouts I've tried, and the carbonation is somewhat restrained as well."
"Overall a tasty stout with a brawny ABV. However, I would have preferred a bit more dryness."
"Highly recommended American Stout"
"One of my favorite stouts. Great aroma and a utterly fantastic taste! The fact that it comes in 22 oz bottles at almost 8% is also good in my book. It has a wonderful coffee/chocolate (well, cappuccino) taste that coffee lovers who like beer would truly enjoy."
"if it wasn't a limited release i would get it quite often, especially considering how affordable it is in my area."
"Serving Type: 650ml bottle poured into Spaten stone stein."
"D: You don't really pick up on the 8% as this is very drinkable. A nice treat on a cool Friday evening...."
"Pours a dark brown/red, very light, thick tan head, some lace spots, thin layer, seethrough, pretty light colour for a big stout. Smell is sweet caramel, sugars, roast coffee, some chocolate, candies, bit of fruit, alcohol, smells kind of like a cup of coffee. Taste is malty, some toffee, sugary sweet middle, roast, vanilla, light coffee, more roast, bit of iron. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, some warmth going down. Almost sickly sweet, don't get very much stout in this, more like a brown ale to me, and hardly any coffee comes out. Thanks Alexa!"
"Pours a black/ deep mohogany with a small tan head. The aroma is a sweet malt and coffee. Tastes of a sweet malty coffee, and a touch of hops in there too. A very smooth stout with a bigger body than expected. Hide the alcohol, and a nice coffee taste, which just proves that this isn't just for breakfast anymore."
"Overall- A delicious after dinner beer. I believe this would be good for breakfast too!"
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a rich, black malt and coffee scent that is dry and earthy with a warm alcohol feel. The taste is good. It has a great malt flavor that's thick and rich with loads of coffee and patent malts. It's smooth with a slightly warm finish. This is a good drinker. It doesn't overpower you with the coffee. It has a nice malt balance. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an excellent beer with lots of character. I love the coffee stouts. Cheers."
"This beer was very easy to drink. I could have a couple of these very easily."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation. I could see drinking this beer again with no problem at all. A solid coffee stout that doesn't fail to deliver. Easily one of my favorite Lagunitas brews so far and I look forward to having it again."
"D: Plenty of flavors swirling around in this brew. A tad thin in the mouthfeel catagory but all in all a nice change of pace. Recommended."
"22 oz bottle. Pours a deep brown to black with some cola colored highlights. Thick light brown head that sits atop the beer for a good while later forming a thin sheen of foam. Some lacing and stickage. Pleasant aromas of dark roasted coffee, black patent and chocolate malts, bakers chocolate and a light wafts of hops. Creamy and smooth, carbonation is subtle and spot-on for the body. Malty and chocolatey sweet with bitterness coming at the finish from a combo of scorched malts, coffee and hops. Very nice but a little sweeter than I expected. Further character develops as it warms, and the coffee and chocolate become more pronounced. A very nice stout I've tried on-draught before reviewing this bottle; this would be interesting to try nitrogenated."
"If given the chance, would keep this one on hand for Sunday morning brunch year-round."
"The mouthfeel is only medium thick and the carbonation is low, so this is an easy drinker. The alcohol is pretty well hidden for being nearly 8% as I only found a trace of it in the aftertaste. Overall a good tasting stout but not a great one."
"Very dark brown, nearly opaque, with mahogany highlights. Fine tan head with decent retention and some stickage. Aromas of dry cocoa, roast, ground coffee, and caramel. Moderate bitterness and caramel sweetness to start, some dry roasty coffee and cocoa in the middle with mild alcohol and a hint of hops at the end. Creamy, fine carbonation with a medium/full body. A little dry in the finish with some alcohol warmth. Pretty good stuff. Nothing really exceptional, but solid all around."
"Cheers!"
"Appearance is dark brown with a wispy tan head. Nose is of sweet coffee and malts, very nice. Taste is of sweet coffee with a hint of chocolate with a pretty decent hop presence. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and creamy, almost perfect except that it is a bit thin for the style. Drinkability is good. There is a pronouced boozy presence but the smoothness makes this beer enjoyable."
"Overall, I thought this was a pretty good offering from Lagunitas, and probably my favourite from them so far."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light-meidum body. Lightly carbonated. Not overly ""creamy", yet this beer goes down quite easily. The 8% a/v is barely detectable. This is a pretty decent coffee stout. Worth the $4 sticker price per bomber."
"Poured out a super dark brown a thin foamy tan head. The nose had good malt, roasted barley, choclate, and yes, coffee notes as well. The taste was creamy, metallic, bitter, cream, cherry, chocolate. Coffee ws in the finish, or even later. The second sip was more metallic and creamy. Tasted more of the steamed milk than the espresso component of a cappucinno. Finished rather creamy, and overall is a fairly enjoyable beer. Strange that a 'coffee' styled stout would have so little coffee in its flavor though."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied and very easy to drink. Very, very smooth. I think the abv is perfect for this beer. It doesn't really hinder drinkability at all. Overall, it's a very good beer. I'm impressed."
"The taste is great. Full of flavor - the aforementioned malt, chocolate and coffee with a surprising hop bitterness. The bite of the hops, the sweetness of the chocolate at the acidity of the coffee balance well together. It's has an after dinner quality to it, but I could also see myself drinking this in the morning - after all it does have coffee in it ;-)"
"Shared a bomber if this with my wife on a Sunday evening. She's a stout fan, and didn't like it. I thought it was alright, but not the best coffee-infused beer I've had. Poured surprisingly light-coloured for a stout; a clear deep reddish brown. Small head, even at near-room temperature. Not a lot of aroma, but definitely some coffee in there, as well as something sweeter like cotton candy or caramels. Taste is surprisingly sweet; this almost seems like a milk stout rather than a more traditional stout; reminds me a lot of Dragon Stout. Very little coffee flavour, and not bitter enough in my opinion, until the aftertaste which is mildly astringent. Overall, worth trying but nothing spectacular."
"Poured a very dark brown,almost black witha huge Tan three inch high head. The retention rate was huge and when it finally relented it left a ton of lace down the sides of the glass. Smell was suprisngly hoppy, with lots of hints of sweet coffe, sugar and milk. Very nice. The taste was very smooth and refreshing, very nice indeed. Extremely hoppy for a stour\t, with lots of hints of citrus flavors, orange, pineapple, mixed in with the very robust flavors of coffee and sugar, awesome balance and texture. Such a dry, almost IPA like finish that lasted literally forever. The was an extremely unique stout. I found this to be one of the most enjoyable brews I have tasted and would definatly want to try it again,great job \!!"
"Mouthfeel lacks the creaminess I'd like in something so skewed towards the luxurious. Still, at nearly 8% ABV, the smoothness of this beer is admirable and I could probably have a few before giving in to fullness."
"Drinkability - this is good, not great. High abv also holds down sessionability."
"D - Pretty good and definitely worth trying, it is a damn good stout."
"Bottle courtesy of Shp555: Poured a medium black color ale with a medium dark brown foamy head with good retention. Aroma of coffee is dominating (what a surprise!!!) with some subtle bitter roasted malt. Taste is also dominated by the coffee with some roasted malt. Body is a bit light IMO with some adequate carbonation."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little tan head, not much lacing afterwards though. The nose is nice of roasted malts, and coffee. The taste is very nice of roasted malts, and coffee. The finish is dry and slightly bitter. Medium body. Very drinkable, a nice stout from Lagunitas."
"I could imagine this working as an after dinner drink at Thanksgiving."
"D: It wasn’t quite as filling as most stouts. The conflicting flavors detract from the tastiness of the beer and how well it goes down, I typically like the coffee-flavored beers but this one just wasn’t that good."
"D - Overall, pretty enjoyable...the ONLY thing is that the alcohol crept up on me much more than I expected. A real sneaky bastard. Other than that, a very drinkable stout."
"Tastes of espresso. Espresso against an odd chocolate. Milk chocolate. Both. Only they don't blend all that well together. The swetness of the malt is great, and the bitterness of the espresso is nice but there's no bridge between the two. Still, it's certailny not bad: the finish is a wonderful roasted malt and dry hop, and it's pretty tasty all around, but the lack of cohesion prevents this beer from reaching greatness."
"In the end, I guess some may say it's futile (and it has nothing to do with the beer itself), but I really like when micros/crafts put together a nice, classy bottle and label. Lagunitas always has simple labels printed on nice paper. I appreciate that."
"Man, that roasted coffee flavor just stays with you - kind of like how a good double ipa has bitterness that just stays and stays. I love it. This straddles the line between stout and imperial like a pro! Highly recommended!"
"This beer poured into my glass with a terrific black coffee appearance. A decent foamy dark tan head lingered pleasantly on top. The beer had a soft nose of bitter sweet chocolate and hops. This stout had a nice dark chocolate start, with weaving traces of coffee and hops. The finish of this medium-light bodied beer was crisp, with a surprising floral hoppy trail. The lighter body makes this beer easy to session with, when craving a good stout taste. Paired great with a honey baked ham that was finished on the grill to give it subtle smoky tones...Enjoy"
"A pretty good brew, but one bomber certainly is enough for me."
"This beer poured with a reddish-brown color, with LOTS of tan head. Aroma and flavor were both of coffee, but with a bit of sweetness added. It is a bit like a coffee stout might be, but with less coffee flavor and more sweetness. So, mission accomplished as far as making a beer that tastes as it is named. Lacing on this beer is beautiful, like a sheet on the far side of the glass. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good."
"It's snowing like a bastard out right now and I DGAF because this beer has me completely internally lit. A must have for any stout fans or any nay sayers of the style."
"D - All coffee and no stout in my opinion. Not a bad beer but it needs a bolder stout behind it."
"Pours black with a small light tan head that fades to a ring. Aroma is chocolately with some fruitiness. Cherries and a bourbony aroma as well. Taste follows with more of the chocolate up front and a very small amount of cherry and cola as well. Some roasty bitter coffee notes in the somewhat dry and warming finish. Alkcohol is somewhat noticeable but well proportioned and in place in the finish. A very nice stout, I didn't get as much coffee aroma or flavor as I expected from the name, but a very nice stout"
"Drinkability: If thou shall drink thy fine libation, thou shall be filled with much joy as a shepherd watching over thy sheep grazing in a green pasture! That was my take on the Lagunitas creative information paragraph. Basically what I was trying to say was that I enjoyed this beer very much and I would definitely drink it again in the near future. Is this beer just as good as a hot cup of exceptional cappuccino? Almost, but this beer would be a lot easier on the wallet than the cappuccino."
"Nice stuff. Like a big, fat, brown ale with a coffee edge."
"Poured a dark, opaque, slightly viscous black color with a cream colored head that was nice and thick slowly dissipating to leave behind some nice lacing. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, sugar, and cream. The taste was sweet with roasted malt flavors; very much like a milk stout. Roasted coffee bean flavors and the hops add a nice bitterness to the beer to keep it from becoming too sweet. Rich and creamy with a slight alcohol warming sensation. The coffee taste is clear and remains throughout taking a back seat to no one."
"Good drinkability, but I'd much rather have the tap version. A decent stout with a reasonable amount of coffee flavors, but not over the top like some others."
"The maltiness was very up front and strong, as was the cappucino taste. Definitely mellows as it warms. Nice milky taste in the back that rounds out the medium to heavy mouthfeel. A little chocolate. Nice stout, just with a little more to it. Overall really tasty. It makes you want another once it's gone, and better than Dunkin Donuts any day.."
"Mouthfeel was a bit of a let-down, but otherwise this beer is top shelf stuff in my book. Aroma, taste, appearance are all excellent. Will definately be getting more of this for myself and to share with friends."
"Drinkability was exquisite. The high alcohol level was almost undetectable over the rich roasted malty goodness. Definitely a sipping beer that you never want to run out of."
"This disadvantage, too, gets turned on its head, as the brew's lack of ""heaviness"" and potency made it all the more drinkable as a result. I have several stouts in my refrigerator, and invariably, these brews tend to survive longer than the IPAs, the Belgians, and other cousins as I have to be in the right mood to consume one. However, this offering from Lagunitas is so tasty and smooth that this could very well be a brew I drink with some regularity were it not for the fact that it's not that readily available."
"Appears a very dark red in color with about an inch of tan head that fades into about 1/2 an inch of head with good lacing within a minute. Smells of chocolate, coffee, cream, and roasted malt. Taste is a very bitter coffee, almost like its been sitting on the burner for a bit. However, this is well balanced with a good malty presence as well as a nice floral hoppy finish. As the beer warms up, the smoother and more cappuccino-like it becomes. A smooth stout with a bit of chewiness to it. With its balance, flavoring, and smoothness, it's a very drinkable beer, especially for a coffee lover."
"Poured from a 22oz. bomber into an Imperial pint glass a nice dark brown with an inch of tan foam with decent lacing. Smells of sweet roasted malts, cocoa powder, coffee beans. Tastes of fresh roasted coffee and malted grain, bittersweet cocoa, mild hop flavor. Very creamy and smooth with medium carbonation, slightly oily. I went through this bomber in no time. Glad I have a few more."
"Steps into the 2007 NOBY (number one beer of the year) position."
"D: Sort of feel like this should be categorized as an Irish stout. Enjoyable brew but rough on the palate. Probably would have prefered to have shared this one with someone. I could really use a sip of water at this point. But quite tasty really!"
"D: A decent stout. I would think that a ""cappuccino stout"" would taste a bit more like its namesake, but still good, especially for the price tag."
"A nice coffee-ish stout. More bitter than expected for the title, but it works. If you like stouts that are bitterish coffee in character, try this one."
"D: I grabbed this bottle at a Joe Canal's in NJ, so I need to plan another work trip to the Garden State for this one. The coffee flavor deviates from the ground beans that are so prevalent."
"An excellent brew. Appearance was a 5.0...chocolate brown, great pillowy, creamy head and outstanding lacing. Smell is a nice blend of coffee and hops. Taste is an excellent blend of coffee, floral hops and malts...mmmm! Mouthfeel is smooth, witha nice chewy quality. Because of smoothness and dry , tart hoppy finish, drinkability is very good."
"Will not consider another bottle of this, even though I was eagerly awaiting this first bottle."
"Nice mouthfeel, very smooth. Overall a very well done beer; the cappucino lends itself nicely to make this a smooth drinking beer."
"Pours a jet black/mahogony with a large tan head. The head lasts forever leaving great lacing. The smell is very ""bisquity"" with chocolate and coffee scents. The taste is thick and creamy with coffee,chocolate, and bitter hops. A nice flavor to this beer,very creamy and warms you up. The m/f is heavy with all flavors mixing well. A jet black glass of oil that will put a smile on your face and keep you warm on a cold winter night."
"D: Pretty drinkable, but not a bold in the cappuccino flavors as I would have thought. Not a bad offering from Lagunitas, especially for the price ($4). I would grab this on tap to see if theres a difference."
"Overall, a decent coffee stout. As I drank, more licorice and tobacco came out that I didn't really care for."
"Bomber poured into a snifter. Dark, dark brown, but not quite black in color; frothy tan head that is nearly 3 inches thick! Big, sparking bubbles and thin lacing. The nose is pleasant, yet not overpowering--coffee beans, roasted malts and some black licorise. Bitterness noted up front; roasted malts and dark roasted coffee beans. Some leafy hops are there and are blended in quite nicely; sweet chocolate and some more roasty-malts come to the fore-front. There is a bitter sweetness towards the finish, and the alcohol is completely masked. Finishes a bit chalky and dry, but has some great notes. This is one of the better 'coffee-stouts', with the hops and all. Definitely worth a try!"
"Poured from a 650 mL into a pint glass. Has a moderate amount of thick creamy head that holds its shape, but not quite rocky. Doesn't have much of a scent, though I do get some coffee. Tastes of coffee and heavy dark roasted malt, fairly sweet, seems like all bitterness is from malt roast and not hops - very good. It's thick and creamy on the tongue with a lasting finish, very well balanced sweet and bitter. It's pretty filling, so I couldn't drink much of it, though I'd want to. This would definitely keep me warm on a cold winter morning."
"the coffee is not exactly dominant, and the beer not as sweet as i might have expected...a bit portery, actually. the bitterness is robust and melds well with the coffee. it seems to be the end of each sip that features most notably the beer's main selling point"
"The Cappuccino Stout by Lagunitas Brewing is a very pleasant brew. It pours a dark, but not dark enough, color into the glass. The head is descent in size and duration. The smell is a rather nice aroma of bitter coffee. The cappuccino taste, for which the stout is named, is tasty. I am happy I bought multiple bottles, and I recommend you do the same."
"Drinkability: this is one of those beers that is a bit unique which makes it more interesting. But I found this to be easy to quaff and I wish I had another bottle to enjoy during the session."
"Drinkability: What a confusing beer! Here I am expecting a coffee stout and I have something more akin to a black and tan blending a coffee stout with an IPA; not sure it works very well for me, however, as I was really looking for more coffee flavors"
"Slainte!"
"Verdict: less coffee flavor than most if not all coffee beers I have tried, which is nether good nor bad nessesarily. More of a stout than a coffee stout. I would recomend this beer, but not quite a seek outer."
"The drinkability is good, I kind of put this one down fast and it was nice, Very Nice. Think coffee, Thats what this one is, Prosit MK"
"Pours a deep black under normal light; shows a deep ruby red when backlit. A thick, moussy tan head that lasts. Has an aroma reminiscent of my espresso machine when the first drops hit the demitasse cup. Some coffee and chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium with no carbonic bite. Flavor is surprisingly mild, with a strong taste of sweet coffee and no bitterness. No hops evident in aroma or flavor. Alcohol is masked, like in a Mudslide. Very drinkable; one of the most drinkable beers of this abv I have had. It's not a good ""american stout", it's more of a novelty beer for me. But I like it!"
"Its great to see more and more Lagunitas brews showing up here in wny,poured a deep but not pitch black there was ruby highlights shown thru out when held up to the light a well formed one finger mocha colored head atop.Big espresso roast coffee aromas and dry unsweetened chocolate lingers,roasted to the hilt flavors somewhat earthy in the finish but the coffee flavors really steal the show.A light earthiness in the finish rounds out the beer nicely,if you like big roasted uncompremising stouts this is for you and with the alcohol very well hidden it goes down easily."
"Mouthfeel is creamy without being too thick. Very drinkable."
"This was a beautifully laid out stout. The color was near black to black with light tan head. The lacing was exceptional, straight rings from the top to the bottem. The aroma was full of coffee and a little nutty as well. The taste copied the aroma, but added some balancing hop flavor and brought out a little more sweetness. I found the texture to be a little odd as it felt a little thin on the palate, reminding me more of a porter than a stout, but I could still go through a couple pints in a sitting."
"Note: I took the advise of DogFood11 and tried this stout more at room temp with just a slight chill. Good call."
"Notes: I enjoyed this very much. Drink this a bit warmer than you might ever expect it really gets better with every degree upwards to room temp."
"Deep black in color with a nice fluffy white head. Somewhat roasted and metallic like aroma. Mellow roasted flavor-the coffee taste I am looking for isn't overly present. Fairly subdued. Nice graininess flavor to it. Good mouthfeel though not as ""thick"" as I would have expected. Finishes somewhat dry. Very drinkable and enjoyable. I would drop the word ""cappucino"" in the name if it was me. Still a nice beer."
"Overall, this is a pretty good beer, especially if you are a coffee lover, but it struck me as being a bit unbalanced."
"Pours clear dark brown & ruby with small creamy head and really thick sticky lace. Smells sweet and deeply toasted; rich with chocolate and coffee malts that remind one of dark chocolate bars & espresso. Flavor is quite hop-forward, making this a definitively American stout. Pine and citrus hops flash across the tongue at first sip. These are followed by rich grainy malts & thin powdery coffee notes. The hops come to the fore again in the finish, which is dry and leafy. Fleeting toasted bread notes complete the flavor profile. Body is pleasantly creamy, but a bit thin for an 8% stout."
"Pretty good, but I remember the '05 being better."
"Pours a nice tan head with doughy retention and lacing. The color is a deep, deep brown that sill allows some garnet highlights in the middle of this brew. Almost more creamy than coffee. But I gues a true ""cappuccino"" beer just by the smell. The makes me think think of a classic English stout with a caring dash of coffee. Hints of caramel and amber malts linger around. Almost like I'm tasting Godiva like chocoalte with coffee. No tartness That I expect from beers with coffee added. Great, smooth palate with a lot of mild stou qualities that is refreshing. Full bodied, but not thick necessarily."
"Pours black ruby in color with a thick tan head that fades into a sheet of lace. Nose is sort of a mix between fresh brewed coffee and chocolate milk. Taste has a nice blend of coffee and chocolate malt, but these flavors are a bit subdued at first until the beer is allowed to warm. A lightly fruity hop bitterness follows the initial coffee and chocolate flavors. The alcohol level is nicely hidden."
"The flavor was overpowering on a piney taste. It had a very bitterness along with a touch of sourness. I didn't think this was an overpowing good beer. In fact, I was a little dissapointed with the flavor and mouth feel."
"drinkability: fine"
"In conclusion, this is a really nice, well-balanced cappuccino stout. The coffe flavor doesn't over power, but definitely is quite apparent and very nice."
"D: I wish the roasted coffee flavor that enticed me into buying this bottle was more evident. Unfortunately, it's an average tasting stout I'm left with, one I'm pleased to have tried but would probably not buy again."
"I like the concept of coffee stouts, and my favorites of the style are incredibly tasty (Founders Breakfast Stout, Kona Da Grind). But this version could've used more coffee flavor. With the cappuccino name, you'd expect a more robust coffee aroma and flavor, but it wasn't there. Not a bad beer overall, but just an average example of its style."
"Rich and robust, and all that  I was just expecting more on the creamy capp. side and less coffee stout. A solid brew, but I bet you can find local coffee stouts at a better price ($6 for this bomber, I can get same quality $6 local brewery sixers)."
"Very drinkable and tasty with the ABV being very well hiden, will be having more of these, well done again Lagunitas."
"Hense the perfect 5.0 score. The roasted malts,rich coffee flavor ending with a soft chocolate finish. Makes you want to stay up all night and drink this fine stout. Get this one while you can. limited production and available only in 22 oz. bombers. But at only $3.00 a bottle what a bargain for a high gravity big btl."
"Overall, it could use more malt to balance out the roasted coffee flavors."
"I wouldn't kick this beer out of my bed, but I was not excited about it. A Cappuccino Stout Bomber seems pretty impressive by sight, but I didn't find the flavors complex, big, or difficult at all. Get that hint of an aftertaste I experienced into the main flavor and then we could talk. I also question the ""Limited Release"" on the label, considering the hundreds of reviews on it."
"D-The flavor is good in the coffee and cream but there are not many stout beer qualities coming through. Not much complexity to this brew."
"Mouthfeel = rich & creamy, very good. Drinkable, too though I think a few 8% stouts may get to you pretty quickly."
"Top notch."
"A wonderful mouthfeel with lots of hoppy tang and bite. Big and chewy and creamy. Full bodied. If I hadnt already had lunch, this would surely suffice and satiate my appetite. The alcohol is hidden very well. Although it is nearly 8% abv, you cant taste it. This beer could get me in trouble if I ever find it in the bottle to take home. An excellent beer!"
"This is a great stout, especially for coffee fans. Very smooth, very tasty, with no downsides at all. A bit more refined than other knock-your-socks-off American stouts, but all the better for it."
"Dark brown in color, with a mild haze, the beer is topped by an effervescent tan colored head. Mild nose. I get a little bit of cappuccino, and a touch of roasted malt, but there just isnt much there. I hope the aromas open up a bit as the beer warms more. The flavor is more pronounced. Nice balance of cappuccino/coffee, mild light chocolate, roast malt and a hint of citrus bitterness on the finish. All of the flavors are subtle (as I should have expected from the nose, but the blend nicely. The mouth feel is a touch then, but I dont get any alcohol heat. Nice drinkability. Its great to experience a subtle coffee stout."
"Pours a very dark brown, bordering on black, with an appropriately coffee-esque head forming a ring around the beer. The nose is full of roasted coffee notes, a bit of chocolate malts and some slight citrus fruits. Initial fruitiness followed by bitter coffee notes that never overtake the malts and hops. Creamy malts surround the tongue mid-palate; then the hops come out toward the end, as well as warming alcohol. Throughout, all the flavors are integrated very well, with none overpowering the others. The alcohol level and coffee bitterness contribute to a mouthfeel that's a little rough. There's little evidence, to my tongue, of dextrin or other sugars being added to enhance smoothness. Overall, this is quite a good stout, and definitely one that lovers of beer and coffee should check out."
"The alcohol is well-heeled (or overshadowed by the heavy roastiness). Impressive. I'm not sure that drinkability follows with that though. This is more of a ""power"" pint... and, of course, I refer to an Imperial pint. I don't think I could go beyond that. It's just such an overload; but I'd consider it, so...."
"Full, juicy body, very enjoyable stout."
"Drinkability: This is all wrong. This beer does little to deserve the label ""cappucino."" The pained lack of richness and coffee flavor was a real letdown."
"drinkable?: indeed, nothing slows you down with this beer."
"Mouthfeel was a bit thin, more like a porter. However it was really smooth and non-cloying. It is a very sessionable brew. It's a good beer, just not a good stout."
"Poured into a nonic, served cool. Cream-khaki head is initially noisy, then settles to a cratered mass on top of a mahogany body with russet highlights. Black malt and light toasted cocoa aromas up front; further sniffing reveals a husky grain scent along with subtle coffee notes. The coffee is far more apparent in the taste, which begins with toasted grain traits, then moves to a chocolate-vinous middle which is subsequently overwhelmed by a significantly bitter, almost acrid, and deep dark-roasted coffee flavor. This coffee aspect near the end is punctuated by spicy alcohol notes (damn near 8% abv shows just a bit, but not in an unpleasant way), and lasts quite a while in the aftertaste. Some mellow pine-flavored hops populate the burps. By and large, the mouthfeel is on the creamy side, with an occasional appearance of alcohol astringency and an off-dry finish. Not the roastiest of stouts, but certainly the most coffee-flavor I've had in a beer that I can remember. Bigger than your average stout, but far from ""Imperial"". If this was available where I live, I'd certainly pick this up on a regular basis. Undeniably drinkable. Go for it if you have the option."
"Overall mouthfeel is pretty smooth, seems milder as it warms. Not a huge, chewy type stout. One 22 oz. bomber at a time sounds about right."
"Got a bottle of this at Sam's since we don't get the Lagunitas in South Bend. Poured not quite opaque with a massive foamy ""cappuccino"" head on a dark, dark body. head settles and becomes super creamy. Odor isn't much but what is there is sweet smelling, with hints of sugar, maybe molassess, and roasted coffee beans. Taste is sweet and bitter with nice vague hop flavor up front. coffee and sugar and milk are all the real flavors i ""get," they they've got the cappuccino thing down. but is that a good thing? there's kind of a metallic note to this beer that grows quite a bit over time and becomes distracting and unpleasant. and the coffee flavor actually becomes a bit overwhelming after a while too, which hurts it. I like coffee, and coffee beers, but this isn't a good one. mouthfeel is creamy, a bit thinner than the style might suggest. the beer kind of made me a little jittery too, which, i suppose, is what cappuccino does to me as well...i just dont want that from a beer."
"Not impressed, although I really like most of Lagunitas' other offerings."
"D - tasty beer. Would have liked to have more malt/coffee flavors come out, though. Hops are in front here and if you like that in your stouts, go for it."
"M&D - the chocolate and coffee flavors result in a smooth mouthfeel, what a great beer, another quality brew from Lagunitas"
"This one leaves me craving a bit more...still a good beer, but like their Imperial Stout, a tad thin to keep my interest peaked."
"The beer smelled roasty and bold, with the aromas of dark roasted coffee and burnt grains intermingling agreeably with toffeeish odor of the malt. The taste was a blend of the classic stout elements Broadcast first by the smell. It was a stout balanced midway between sweet and bitter extremes, and finished with a hop flourish that rode atop some alcohol warmth. Apart from the absence of vinousness this was an archetypal flavor profile. As it warmed, the beer turned a little prickly and astringent due to the presence of real strong coffee, which made the mouthfeel a touch more jagged than I prefer. Despite this, quite a drinkable beer, and worth seeking out for the fans of this style."
"Decent drinkability but I probably wouldn't have more than a glass or two."
"Deep black in color with a thick, fluffy brown head. Some sticky lacing as I drink it. The coffee is most noticable in the aroma, but there is a nice chocolate complement to it. Also a light touch of hops. The coffee wasn't as up front in the flavor as I thought it would be. The chocolate seems to stand out more. It's creamy, almost like a milkshake, and well carbonated. Seemed to improve the longer I let it sit."
"Had it 2.5 years later and great coffee taste still."
"What a nice treat this beer was, and quite a lucky find to be honest. I am just honored to have been able to try this tasty brew."
"The finish is ushered in with a burst of floral hops followed by a beautiful malt fade."
"I want more...and more...and more."
"The BS on Lagunitas' labels make Stone's ""check out the words we came up with"" anniversary blurbs sound much less pompous. Anyways, the pour is dark, almost black with red hues. Its tan head is thick and foamy. The nose has medium city roast coffee, some chocolate, and a barely noticeable hops. The taste is roasty and fairly creamy. There is the coffee with some of its acidity, semi-sweet chocolate, sweet malts and a faint hoppiness. This is the coffee lover's stout."
"Received from Zorro in BCG-BiF and cellared a few months"
"Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout is very good beer. It's odd how the coffee portion of its personality fades with time and drinking. I would have been fine if it had stuck around, but I'm equally fine with the beer that I experienced in the second half of the bomber. Outside of the outstanding Brown Shugga', this is Lagunitas's best beer. I really wish they would re-think that 'limited release' thing."
"Standard dark brown body, tan head. Smell and taste are very rich and well laced with cappucino. The cappucino does tend to take over teh taste and overall experience of the beer, but that may not be necessarily a bad thing. I enjoyed this beer, although the body was a little thin, could be a little thicker."
"Surprisingly subtle coffee flavor. Lots of roasted malts though. Tinged with vanilla around the edges. Found this beer to be (dissappointingly) one-dimensional. The carbonation kind of tingles on the tongue. A tad more than medium body. All the roastiness almost makes this a taste bud killer."
"Drinkability is actually quite high. Lacks the coffee appeal that it named for but in a way that makes in easier to drink. Solid stout with a hint of coffee flavoring, worked for me."
"Mouthfeel is alright, kind of creamy and just carbonated enough. I'm still on the fence about this beer. I think my final verdict will be ""it's alright."" Not great, not amazing. I'd drink it again, though."
"Thanks Sean. This one pours an incredibly deep ambered brown color with a light tan head over top that maintains very well. Clarity seems good. This one is not quite as dark as I expected it to be. Nose is complex. Good notes of chocolate, fig, and a solid coffee. Good balance between the different notes. Flavor right on with the nose. The dark fruityness and chocolate really seem to be the dominant flavors here. The cofffee hits on the finish, with a good hop bitter on the finish. Very tasty. The feel is moderate with a solid moderate carbonation. No hit at all of alcohol. Its well hidden in the flavor and aroma. I think there is a lot of dark fruit character in this one, and it dominates over the chocolate and coffee notes. This is a nice stout. I'd have it again."
"Pours a dark color with a moderate head that falls slowly and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma is all about the chocolate, roasted malts and there is a bit of lactic sweetness in there. The flavor is all coffee at the beginning then fades to a more chocolaty thing and leaves a bit of sweetness on the tongue. Very tasty. The body is thick and the drinkability is very good on this one. Great brew."
"I could definately drink a couple of these in a sitting. I didn't really notice a warming affect at first, but it does kind of creep up on you, and is definately noticeable as you get towards the bottom of the bottle. This qualifies as a comfort beer in my book."
"at first I thought this would be an OK offering. but the taste really develops and this one shows it's pimp hand well. If you like russian imperial stouts.. try this, you might be pleasantly surprised. I am glad I picked up 2 bottles.. at $3.99 this is hard to beat."
"Deep bister in hue, with surprisingly clear, bubbly flashes of crimson when held to light. Brown sugar sweetness and cola - like caramel hit the nose at first. A deep inhalation reveals notes of dilute mocha and floral hops. Tame in coffee character, but innocuous overall aromawise. In flavor, the initial surge of burnt barley and charcoal bitterness is immediately superceded by a pleasant, albeit one - dimensional milk chocolate sweetness. The coffee presence is present at a low level throughout, and contribute only a subtle, but rounded smoky and tannic notion that complements the residual, molasses - like malt sweetness. Thin in body, and approaching brown ale - like in that regard. Constant hop bitterness melds well with coffee tannins, and provides a bitterness that offsets residual sugar aptly. Finishes abruptly yet warm, with quickly fleeting notes of dry baker's cocoa and ethanol. A relatively enjoyable stout all around. I would've appreciated a more dextrinous body and a more pronounced coffee component. Its best attribute is its dangerous drinkability. Honestly, it drinks like a brown porter."
"Drinkability/notes: Wonderful as a dessert beer, and most pleasing in cold weather. Share it with friends."
"Surprisingly, this is my first Lagunitas product. I'm impressed. Hope their year round brews are this good. This one is definitely recommended."
"This thing smells unreal. I wish it had the body and flavor to match. Im not saying dont drink it, its good, and I'll try it again when i see it, but its not a beer Id go searching for."
"A delicious beer that's a real joy to drink. Much of what this coffee stout offers is in superb balance with bold flavors that don't intimidate. Only slight elements of inconsistency keep it from higher scores."
"P.S. I finished my review and most of my tulip glass but then remembered that theres the rest of the bomber in the fridge. Score!"
"Dark brown, almost black color with a medium thick and foamy beige head. Thin wisps of lacing. Coffee is in the aroma naturally, along with some sweet malt. Medium-bodied with a coffee flavor that is actually pretty subtle. Sweet malt, caramel and hops flavors are evident. The finish is hoppy with a little cappucino kick. If this beer were richer with a more pronounced coffee flavor I would have enjoyed it more."
"Drinkability gets high marks I'll buy this again soon especially since it was only $3.99."
"Decent lacing. Very bitter fore with a lot of alcohol for just a plain stout. That is more ABV than at least one Impy I can think of and almost as much as many Impys. The coffee and chocolate notes arrive together in the finish followed by a hint of black licorice in the aftertaste. Fairly big stout that probably could be in the Impy category."
"To me this is such a great treat to have. i wish i could have this one on demand. I would love to get my hands on this one again. freakin love it! But i think this one is one that should be enjoyed a little bit colder than warmer, if possible. As it warms up, it doesnt have that exact taste i love, but it isnt bad."
"Fathead's draft. Appearance: Dark ruby brown tan head leaves nice even lacing down the pint. Aroma: Chocolate coffee creamy edge dark dry roasts along with lucious layers of creaminess and a touch of herbal hops. Taste: Sweet marshmellow creamy edge wrapped around dark bitter roasted malts cocoa powder and coffee flavor nice dark beer. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied evenly carbonated silky smooth going down, nice. Drinkability: Excellent all around coffee stout from the folks from Petaluma, I could definitely have stuck with this brew for a couple more."
"A bit thin for a stout, but certainly an easy drinker. Cheap, too."
"Pure unadulterated coffee... I love the boldness and audacity of the flavour... this beer pretends to be nothing it is not, and I credit them for that... good job Lagunitas... my favorite beer of theirs."
"The taste was very bitter at first, but quickly faded as more flavors became apparent. Roasted coffee, sugar, toffee and caramel, hops. It was overall quite a bit more bitter in the beginning than it was sweet at the end. Rather smooth and defintiely got better as it got warmer. I personally could drink a few of these, but not many more. Overall a very good beer."
"I think this beer would make a good session beer. While the alcohol content might be just a little high, the non aggressive flavor in great. I can and will drink this beer all night long."
"Cheers!"
"22 ounce bottle."
"22 oz. bomber. Pours a deep brown, slight ruby highlights around the edges. Thick foamy tan head, disappeared over time. Nice patch lace on the sides of the glass. Coffee with cream aroma, not too strongly roasted. Good amount of sweetness, with a creamy coffee flavor. Not as robust as I would have thought, though not subtle. Thin in the mouthfeel. Overall, I was expecting a stong coffee flavor, but this was enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is medium but thin for the style. Tastes more like iced coffee than a real beer, much of the stout flavors are lost with the addition of the cappuccino. Decent, but maybe a touch more malty sweetness would take the edge off."
"The major selling points of this beer are it's mouthfeel and it's visual presence. I felt this was not nearly bitter enough to take on the almost syrupy sweetness. This is stomachache material."
"Overall Impression: Just a great coffee stout. The more I drank it, the more I enjoyed it. Well made and recommended. Thanks to Pegasus."
"Hard to believe this is an 8% beer at first: it's so drinkable, even quaffable. But I do feel it after finishing it. A very tasty offering from Lagunitas."
"The color is dark brown with a ruby glow when viewed against a light source. The average-sized head is light brown and creamy. The aroma has an overall mild strength. Rich, semi-sweet chocolate smells are most prevalent with just a bit of coffee and roast. Taste is dominated by dark malt flavor, mostly semi-sweet chocolate flavors with a bit of dark chocolate bite. Cappuccino flavors mix in throughout alongside a mild roastiness. Anyway, the flavor is fantastic, maybe not as filled with coffee as expected, but still a very rich and flavorful combo. Only the 7.9% hampers the drinkability. Highly recommended."
"Pours a deep dark brown with crimson highlights. Head quickly settles to a fine laced cap. Smell is of sweet toffee and subtle mocha. This brew has a medium body that is bitter-sweet and smooth on the palate. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, but expressive enough as to not be a weakness. Taste is of semi-sweet chocolate, coffee dreg, and hop spiciness. A solid brew."
"Opinion: I really like this beer. It is really flavorful, and hides the 8%ABV well. I am not a big roast beer fan, but I will definitely be drinking this beer again if I am so fortunate to get some before it is all gone."
"I was expecting a coffee bomb, but instead I wound up with a rich, creamy stout with a hint of roastiness. The aroma doesn't really give much of a clue as to what's inside, just a faint roasted chocolate smell. The overall sweetness blends well with a slight bitter chocolate flavor.Very nice. I think Lagunitas might do well to release this on a more regular basis. The best big American/Sweet stout I've had in awhile. From the Elk Grove BevMo."
"Dark brown, semi-translucent color. Basically the color of coffee. Large pillowy head actually reminds me of frape (greek style shaken ice coffee). Hint of coffee on the nose. Basically smells like beer with a little coffee aroma in the background. Taste is bittersweet like dark chocolate (more sweet than bitter). A bit of molasses. Stale coffee in background. Not a big fan of this. Although, strangely, I think this would make a good holiday beer."
"Edit: I had no idea this beer was 8%! It masks the alcohol incredibly well."
"Quite an exceptional stout. Pours a dark black body with a creamy brown head, great lacing. Creamy, full bodied and thick. Full of chocolate and coffee flavours. Hides the alcohol very well. Finishes dry and bitter chocolate. One of the best stouts I've had on the west coast."
"The beer after its deportation from the 22-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a soot black, the head tall and chocolate in color, the consistency creamy, as it slowly dissolves the lace forms a glutinous blanket to cover the glass. Nose is that of rich roasted coffee and bitter-sweet chocolate, hints of malt sweetness, nut-like tones also present, start is sweet and thickly malted, the top full. Finish is burnt coffee bitter, hops delectable in their spiciness, very dry with a modest acidity, a thick and tongue coating aftertaste last quite sometime, a fine stout that hits my beer spot."
"Cheese helped to cut down on the perception of sweetness and realy brought out the creamy chocolate flavor"
"Nice and sweet up front, like a frapuccino - very chill. Follows with a shy bitterness, while the espresso notes are still jumping around the tongue. A bittersweet black coffee aftertaste begs you to take another sip. Lots of sweetness and creaminess. Dark chocolate and brown sugar. Develops a more concentrated sweetness as you let it sit. A fine Lagunitas offering."
"As the beer warms up a bit it begins to get a bit fuller in the mouth, a bit more coating, and a bit more creamy in texture, and quite a bit richer. The body begins to gain that heft that I had been wishing for earlier; this beer definitely would benefit being served initially at about 56°F (13°C). Throughout the process of drinking this beer there is that backdrop of roasted character, which does dominate the flavor profile. This beer only gets better and better as I work my through it, as it warms up it becomes much more balanced and tasty."
"Drinkability: Excellent. The coffee brings out the smooth sweetness and dark flavors of this stout beautifully. The coffee flavor might be a bit over-the-top for some, but I love it. Another good one from the fine folks at Lagunitas -- keep 'em coming!"
"A session type of Stout, what a deal, well balanced with a smooth finish. Buy it while you can find it."
"Slàinte!"
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"One of the better stouts,"
"Very thin, stock ticker crawl of bubbled sheeting with piling on the edges. Deep dark black hue. Difficult at first to pull out the bouquet, but eventually the coffee and blackstrap molasses notes pull through. Roasted coffee bean on the mouth and almost too sweet, perhaps from bakers chocolate and acidic notes in combination; some charring. Wouldnt have any more than one of these."
"Notes: I think there are other bigger and better examples of this style out there. That being said, this style is like pizza for me...I love all of them! If your not a fan of coffee and stouts stay away from this one. Thanks again to absolutesites for this good one!"
"This poured a very deep burgundy brown color. Easy to mistake for opaque, but the clarity is noticeable when held up to the light. Nice wall of tan cream-like foam slides down the glass after the first sip. The aroma is rich with bubblegum/fruity notes. The taste is fruity, tangy with toffee and sweet with dark candy. Buttery and fruity sweet. Some butterscotch comes through in the aftertaste. A bitterness remains in the throat after the beer is gone. Overall, this is an interesting tasting stout  flavorful, but maybe not entirely my cup of tea."
"Pours a deep brown with some maroonish hues. A small, light tan, quite foamy head sits aloft. Aromas of toasted malt with a sweet creaminess. Alcohol is notiacble, but not overpowering. Thick flavors of cream, chocolate and toasty malt. No cappuccino/coffee noticable, but adds to the milky texture. Coating mouthfeel, but not too heavy. Alcohol is well disguised. A pretty good beer, but nothing too exciting. The coffee component is not strong enough, IMO. The creamy texture is a nice diversion from those dry stouts. Give it a try if you find it, but no need to really hunt it out."
"Milk chocolate brown. Murky, with a small, tan head. Nice lacing clings to the glass. Smells of light roasted coffee, vanilla, big sweet malts, and alcohol fumes. Light, toasty-singed bitterness up front. Big, chocolate malt sweetness comes on strong. Some vanilla/sweet cream. Roasted coffee bitterness leads into the finish, but sweetness dominates. Medium-bodied, syrupy feel, borderline cloying. Warming, alcoholic. Not as coffee-accented as I expected, but still a good after dinner/dessert beer."
"Flavor is rich, chocolate type of base stout with a good medium sweet body leading into a a slightly coffish and acidic finish."
"In someways a little light for a Stout, but it had a nice flavor profile for something marketed as ""cappuccino"". Great drinkability."
"Drinkability: Yeah, I could suck this bad boy down, bottle after bottle. It's not a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination, it's just not my idea of a stout. If someone were to hand me a pint and say, ""Here's the best brown ale you'll ever have", I'd say ""No, you're full of crap I hate brown ales (and I left the second comma out on purpose)."" But they'd be right. Unfortunately for this mythical person who (if the knew me) should freakin' KNOW better, it's called a stout. Based on that, I have to say it's a disappointment."
"Drinkability  If you live in Seattle and go to Starbucks three times a day like a lot of us do, this is the stout for you."
"Each sip left me wanting another, and the bottle of the 22ozer came all too quickly for me. A really fine beer from a brewery which has done a lot to impress me. Their specialty brews are always something to watch for, and this one is no exception."
"Overall: maybe it's just me but they need to change the name on this one. Coffee flavor just wasn't very intense and the milk flavor gives it that bit of wateriness. I expected more."
"This looked like a fantastic beer so I had to pick it up, Lagunitas makes great beers. Pours a nice black stout but this one had brownish hints, not crude oil black like most specialty stouts, the smell was fantastic, cocoa beans with whipped cream and molasses, taste was suprisingly not coffee tasting, more of a metallic cocao butter with toffee and nut afterlings, not a bad beer but being a coffee nut I expected this to have more coffee flavor, you know since the name has Cappuccino right on it, oh well still a good beer."
"Very drinkable stout, smooth without that annoying burnt taste they sometimes get."
"Another great micro from Lagunitas. Different stouts and ales make life interesting. Dark brown beer with hardly any lacing on the tulip glass. Definite malty presence with a very mild coffee taste in it. Drinkability, well, I have a high tolerance, am a moderate drinker, so I could drink these all night long. Gave it the ""Girlfriend Test"": it failed miserably (Note: She doesn't like any beer to date, which is fine with me. Don't have to worry about my beers gone missing). Cannot go wrong with this fine Stout from Lagunitas. Enjoy!"
"While the taste hints at coffee, I noted more of a vanilla bean flavor alongside customary bittering. The total effect was soothing and sensibly balanced. Given the potentially menacing flavor profile of a coffee stout, Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout was very drinker friendly."
"An enjoyable offering, as the label says Coffee is My Shepherd, I shall not Doze, hey I may even consider taking one of these to work in a Starbucks Cup tomorrow!!"
"First taste does away with any pretense of this seeming creamy. It's not rough, but instead has much more body than the nose had suggested. Big roasted characteristic at firstand a slight lactic milkyness, then that coffee/cappuccino characteristic comes in through the middle and carries on for a long time. Though not as big as some of the coffee stouts out there (Alesmith's Speedway, etc...), this is still great for a ""normal"" coffee stout."
"Its nice, but I'm glad to split the 22 with my wife."
"Loving it!"
"Brown. Aroma is full of coffee beans, milk & cream, chocolate and caramel. Subtle, mild, non offensive flavor with again, a strong taste of coffee beans continues on in the flavor profile along with chocolate, roasted malts and creamy. Well hidden alcohol. Finish is lingering and dry."
"Vanilla bean and coffee with cream is present throughout the finish, which ends up just dry enough to beg another pint. What a great, creamy mouthfeel, too... I really loved this stout."
"Nice drinkable stout..I liked it a lot."
"The taste was a let down as well with a hint of coffee, a nice kick of roasted malts and a slight woody flavor, but not nearly the flavor I would expect from a beer brewed with ""hard core coffee""."
"This beer looked kind of thin and wimpy for a 7.9% cappuccino stout  more like a dark amber than a dark stout. The nose was also not what I had hoped. The first taste cold did not do this beer justice. Once it warmed the tastes really came together  iced black coffee, good quality bittersweet chocolate. I tried it with the cocoa petes chocolate (the one with coffee) and it matched well. This is a good intro to the concept of beer/coffee with Alesmith being graduation day. Bevmo in Albany."
"A treat to try a pint of this elixir on cask at the Blind Tiger in NYC. Pours near black, tan puffy and soft head, left some moderate lacing. Nose of, guess what, coffee beans. This is a very creamy, silky smooth ans soft on the tongue stout. Rich flavors of multiple differant shades of coffee, cafe au lait and coffee beans. Vanilla also slides accross the palate. Stout lovers and coffee lovers rejoice."
"This is a nice beer; I need to get some more of this stuff."
"The cappucino flavor is actually kind of mild, more hoppiness than I expected but it works, also some roasted flavor from the bottom of the coffee pot and a tiny bit of dark chocolate. Nice mellow coffee aftertaste. This stuff was the absolute perfect companion for the Belgian chocolate at the end of the bar."
"Try it...you won't regret it. Tasty to say the least."
