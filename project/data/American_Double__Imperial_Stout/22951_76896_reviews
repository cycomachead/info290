"Pours a clear deep brown that appears ink black (deep ruby highlights when held to bright light) producing barely a finger of frothy, shortlived, mocha head that leaves only splotches & motes  of lacing. Aroma is smokey bittersweet chocolate, like smoked Hershey's chocolate syrup (if there was such a thing), toffee, bitter coffee & cream, a hint of anise, char & booze. Taste starts as a bittersweet balance of burnt & smokey malts, Hershey's  chocolate syrup, creamed coffee & charcoal developing a phenolic/plastic character mixed with chocolate cherry cordials at or just after mid-sip & finishes with a intensifying burnt, chocolate, charcoal bitterness & alcohol that becomes a decreasingly bitter, roasted, slightly burnt, chocolatey, yet slightly phenolic aftertaste. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with light carbonation, alcohol spiciness, very chewy, silky & creamy. Complex. This would definitely get an even higher rating if it were not for the cloyingly odd, plastic/phenolic taste."

"Woah now cowboy. This is way over rated. Not worth the 10 bucks. Poured it out half way through. What a bummer. Interesting bummer none the less."
"Black as knight, I'm getting some cherry  at about a foot away from the glass. Also getting the alcohol and roasted malts in the smell as well. Excellent taste with sweet cherry and nutty and just the right amount of roasted malts to finish. Great beer"
"From tasting notes. Appearance: Dark brown to black under a 2” pillowy tan head, lacy. Smell: Malt and smoke on the nose. Taste: Very creamy, chocolate, some roast, spice, some alcohol on the finish. Mouthfeel: Chewy, fine soft carbonation."
"Opened a 2013 bottle of ""Vampire Slayer"" and I have to say that it has aged beautifully."
"Enjoy"
""
""
""
""

"Really creamy and terrific mouthfeel.  Flavor is great.  You can taste the oak chips but its so subtle that it works great and balances the  sweetness.   Yum."

"While I generally like Clown Shoes, I haven't yet been really impressed by one of their stouts. With that in mind as I opened this bottle, I was very happily surprised at the rich chocolate taste of this stout. Sweeter than I expected also, but doesn't cross into the sweet stout territory. Alcohol very well hidden. This would be dangerous on draft. For me, best Clown Shoes stout this far."
""
""
""
""
"Delicious. Vanilla, sweet scent. Great full, malty, oak up front. Slight bitter chocolate and ABV show up on the finish."
"Very smooth - excellent tasting beer. Can't beat it for the price!"
"very smooth chocolately taste. I'm not big on stouts, but this one is persuasively enjoyable."

"Freaking awesome smoked stout. makes the new version undead party crasher a must try now."
""
""
"Tastes of molasses, glazed toffee, earthy malts with hints of bitter coffee, coated up by a decent creaminess. Roasted coffee beans provide an enjoyable balance to the sweet, warming toffee. Turns even sweeter during the finish, with sugary coca-cola, molasses and a gently, dry, bitter chocolate note."

"22oz old label Vamp slay. Not sure how old. Real nice sweet finish. Room temp opens it up."
""
""
""
"It's a solid smoked stout. It's a bit underwhelming on its own, but it has some character. A bit sweet overall."

"Overall: This was a very enjoyable beer to drink. It wasn't the most flavorful but at the same time it had enough flavor to make it tasty. The real winner is the drinkability of this beer. It's nice and smooth, and easy to drink. If you like stouts I would recommend it."
""
"Poured into an oversized wine glass.  Color was a completely opaque dark brown with a very thin (basically lacings) light brown head.  Aroma was a nice dark chocolate, seemed to shift notes a bit, but mostly chocolate/cocoa.  Taste had a bit of bitter alcohol up front, but shifted to a nice sweet cocoa flavor that lingered in the mouth for while.  Coated well, a bit overly tingly from the carbonation.  Overall, not bad at all.  Flavor wasn't as complex as I was hoping for, but nice and solid."
"2012 2nd Anniv. Vampire Slayer. Aged really nicely. Wish I had a couple more."

"After spending some time with this beer. Im rather impressed that they took such a good ABV and made it taste as smooth as a good low ABV stout. I am officially a fan"
""
"smooth and powerful....buckle up and enjoy the ride"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: fantastic brew and one of the best I've had from clown shoes, great aroma, the roasted malt has a slight bite to it or sharpness."
""
""
"Black as night with no light permeating it.  A fingernail of beige head covers the top.  Brussels lacing.  I smell plenty of dark malt and black licorice along with chocolate notes.  I taste plenty of sweet dark malt and black licorice.  There's some chocolate and bitter coffee flavor.  The mouth is thick and viscous."
""

""
""
""

"Dark and smooth. Love the hickory taste that comes in. One of the best Imperial Stouts I've ever had. Strong like bull. Already drank 1 and I'm buzzing lol. Review over! Haha go buy one!"

"o: A flavorful and easy drinking IS, dangerous considering the high ABV, which is hardly evident except perhaps as part of the tongue burn."
"Earlier today I had barrel aged Narwhal for the first time, so this beer had a lot to live up to.. This obviously wasn't quite as good, but I would like to see what barrel aging could do to this. Very nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""

"Delicious imperial stout. Dark, dark malts give this pitch black ale a creamy, smooth taste that makes this one an easy drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O 4.25) Overall this is a  good stout. I'm not a huge fan of the smokey flavors that dominate and this keeps me from thinking it's exceptional, better than average yes, but not remarkable."
""
""
""
"This beer is wonderful I can drink this for breakfast or any other time of day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Age seems like it  did not do this beer any good, mainly malt flavors, little to no chocolate or coffee."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall the disappointment doesn't take away from the fact that this is a good beer. The smoked malts don't overwhelm this beer in the least. In fact if I looked at this as a smoked beer instead of as a stout it would recieve high marks from me in that category. As a stout though I would reach for something else next time."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light and surprisingly crisp. Overall, nice beer."
""

"Mmmmm. Chocolatey, fruity, with notes of coffee and liquor. A liquid Fig Newton. Wonderful."

"11%? REALLY?? Excessively smooth. Traditional Imperial Stout flavors with the dark fruits taking the foreground."
""
""
""
"Tasty and complex but a bit expensive..."
""
""
""
""
""
"This tends a bit towards a coffee flavor than sweet or chocolate, and is pretty well done.  The flavors are like a bold dark roast, with some light hints of cream and sweetener, and a light bite of alcohol, both accentuating the main taste well."

"A nice, big old-fashioned Imperial Stout, what I used to think was the best kind of beer. I’m a lot more well-rounded now, but I still greatly dig a beer like this. The only flaw I can think of is that I think it could hve used a tad bit more bitterness, like maybe some coffee notes , but it's still extremely tasty. Reccomended, and I’m a little bummed that it’s retired (though it wouldn’t be available where I live anyway). Thanks again, Nathan!"
""
""
""

"O: Overall, very tasty. I would definitely get this one again, worth the price ($9/22oz)."

"Pours a dark black with a tan head that trails the glass. The smell is full of coffee and dark chocolate with some floral notes on the end. The taste is full of the same notes. Very deep flavors of bitter espresso with sweet chocolate hints through out. Wonderful mouthfeel, thick but not syrupy, thought it was a very nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is jet black, oily thick, with a dark tan, bubbly, foamy head. Aromas of bittersweet baker's chocolate, cream sweetness, bitter roasted coffee, subtle boozy notes, vanilla, crème, and earthy notes. Flavors are heavily roasted, with bittersweet chocolate forward, mocha notes, cream and vanilla highlights, earthy tones, hints of booze, and subtle molasses notes. This beer is heavy and tasty. The body is huge, but dry, which increases the drinkability. Wow! The aftertaste is more of the roasted and bitter notes, with chocolate leading the way. The finish is smooth, velvety, but at the very end, turns dry, which teases you to drink more. I should have bought more than one. Wow!!"
""
""
""
"Overall - one of the few beers in this style that I think is better colder. The dark fruit aspect is a little too strong for me, but still an excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This starts with a thick inky pour and a short lived dark brown head. The nose is rich and presents cocoa powder, lactose-sweetness, marshmallow, whipped cream, caramel malt, light char and molasses. On the tongue it's thick and dry with char, embers, cocoa powder, roasted coffee bean, a strip of marshmallow sweetness(very light), some dark fruit and a finish of charred oats. Clown Shoes has not impressed me but I must say they know how to make a stout!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Overakk: A pretty typical chocolate stout for the most part. And yet, the rich mocha and spicy hop notes make it a little bit more of a standout."
""
""
""
""
"Bomber poured into a tulip glass. Nearly opaque black brew with a rich, creamed coffee colored head. Aroma is chocolate milk, coffee, malt candy, raisins, vanilla, toffee, and faint whiff of wood char, smoke, and rum-like booze. Rich and sweet. Like a milk stout on steroids, creamy and smooth, the sweet elements on the nose translating very well on the palate. Each sip features a tripartite chocolate milk/coffee/toffee beginning, dried fruit in the middle, and an earthy, pungent, boozy coda. Cacao powder and mellow ash in the rather dry finish. Alcohol does not burn although one certainly knows its there in spades. Almost a curry-like spice at times (!). The wicked cool label doesn't hurt either. A smokiness does develop over time as the sweetness subsides a little. I might consider sharing this with a buddy next time ... Body on the thick side which amplifies the sweetness, gentle carbonation. A beer for the bold intrepid stout fan, to be sure. I continue to celebrate the arrival of Clown Shoes in this province and this is a more than fitting toast. I could stash a few crates of this and Crunkle Sam and do just fine on an island for a week or two."

"22oz Bomber.Nice stout with a great kick to it.I could taste a little Chocolate and some Raisins in this.It was going down real good last night listening to some Black Sabbath.Very soild stout with a 11.0 ABV.Give it a try.I would drink again."
""

""

"An excellent, straight-forward, no-frills imperial stout.  This is a huge, huge beer, and it can't help but hide it...but it's very good. The emphasis is rightly on the roasted barley, and it comes through in big waves. Not the best or most creative stout, but a great beer."
""
"Cheers"

"Extremely pleasant overall, one of the better stouts I've had as a stout lover. Highly recommended for any stout fans of fans of clown shoes."

"O- I have reviewed a fair amount of high end stouts in the past 6 months or so, this one stands up to the test. It's the kind of beer that makes you want to see what else the brewery has to offer and then drink the hell out of that too."
""
""
"Jet black, ring of tan head, lace spots as well. Smell is big and roasty, chocolate, quite hoppy as well, when cold almost in Black IPA territory, dark fruit with smokey and lightly chared notes as it warmed. Taste is roasty and smokey almost peaty at points, chocolate and a big hop bitterness, cold coffee and dark chocolate aftertaste. Lightly carbonated, med-full chewey body. Good stuff here, a nice full flavoured imperial stout, would certainly have this again."

"Overall- A solid RIS. Not my favorite, but very good. It would warrant another purchase sometime (at $11 per 22oz bomber) but I would still rank it below Old Rasputin, Founders Imperial Stout, Stone IRS, Great Divide Yeti, and Great Lakes Blackout (all readily available in my area for cheaper prices). I would rank this on par with the Brooklyn BCS, and there is some overlap in flavors between the two with the dominant chocolate and spicy booziness."

"O: This is a fantastic beer with great flavors and a killer mouthfeel. This one nails it in the American Imperial Stout category."
""
""
""
""
"Not cheap at 13$ a bomber but I don't feel ripped off, yet another welcome addition to the shelves in Alberta, let the good times roll!!"

"O- Nice stout for the price. Rich and malty... I could swear coco nibs were involved"
""
""
""
""

"O - Good Imperial Stout, but the booze can be a bit much, its rather complex too, has a lot to offer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bold flavor profile. You can taste the big chocolate notes, with the coffee notes. Some vanilla comes in, and it's like chocolate milk. I get a slight milky profile. Some roasty characters, not smokey. But huge flavors bursting. This is great for the price, and it feels like I'm drinking a barrel aged stout that should be marked up ten more bucks."
""
""
"Pours a half inch head.Smell is dark malt and coffee up front with chocolate lacing.A little boozy on first sip but actually well done and a great aftertaste.Melts in the mouth.Not as good as Fidy but a little better than a Stone.And they named this one an American Imperial Stout!Skal!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow, and for a few different reasons - mostly, the overall lightness of being of this supposedly heady offering - there's just so little weight to it all - as well as the crazily integrated 20-proof booze - hard to sense any of it, at any time, a nervous tic inducing state, I can tell you. Tasty, and enjoyable overall, I suppose, but the hops are somewhat disappointing in their support of the term 'American', the result seeming less than worthy of said nation's better examples of the style."

"Beer pours dark black silk..thick and viscous..oily almost with a dark toffee/caramel colored head that dissipates quickly. Dark and aroma..following the toffee/caramel head to the flavor as well. Coffee and molasses. Mouthfeel is not too thick but is creamy and full. A sweeter Russian imperial. Overall pretty legit!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I am a fan of clown shoes, but this is just a little strong even for me, I'm going to say its the Smokey aspect. It's worth a bottle to try and clown shoes makes many fine beers."

"O: Both very good and somewhat different imperial stouts."
""
"Dark-black color in nature with a pretty big creamy mocha-colored head most likely due to the unintended aggressive pour. No lacing to speak along the glass. Smell of licorice, chocolate, coffee, and some dark fruits are noticeable in the aroma. Nice, big flavor of dark cocoa, coffee, and anise. Taste of some bitter hops are present too but in a good way. Really smooth; like velvet. Thick, creamy, smooth and so easy to drink. Picked this up on a whim cause of the really sweet label and now glad I grabbed two of these. My first Clown Shoes brew and it did not disappoint. Highly recommend this to any Imperial Stout lover!"

"Pours a very dark brown - almost black, with small beige head. Rich aroma consisting of malt, coffee, and caramel. Tasted very similar to a mocha. Included hints of roasted wood and malt. Slight tinge of hops and smoke in taste. If you like smokey flavored drinks this is the beer for you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is a dark brown to black color with a finger of beige head. There is a slight roastiness to the nose. The flavor profile leads and finishes with healthy roast and the finish has a sweet quality to it. The body is robust and substantial, but this offering is not quite as big as the best double stouts around."

"The taste has a wonderful toasted dark malt character with a token sweetness as well and a low to moderate hop finish. This beer is not hoped up but it is very well balanced and I wish I had another."

"MF – Medium-heavy body, semi-slick, viscous, warming. 3.75"

"While the pour yields over three fingers of foam, it is almost all big, delicate bubbles which are able to sustain longer than you’d think, surface looks like the top of a milkshake, the glass sides are all but fully covered in lacing, as if spray painted. Completely black liquid, no sign of any other color, no way you can see any bubbles, solid. The nose slowly builds, not aiming to knock you out with one blow, milk chocolate toffee, vanilla layers itself like a thick cake, plum, black cherry fruit, hazelnuts and Brazil nuts, there’s a grainy bite and a sweet smokiness too, does kind of lurch as it dissolves but the alcohol isn’t vicious, just clumsy. Full-bodied, dense and making it slow to react. The plum, cherry fruit sweeter here, like a fruit cake. Not to downplay the milk chocolate, coconut, caramel, oatmeal notes. The carbonation starts to lend it creaminess then oddly stops. Very light citrus and flower accents, has a tea leaf to tobacco leaf smokiness. Its weakest point might be its lack of flow and thirst quenching capability, both of which seem within its reach. Enjoy how the sweetness trails off through the finish, making it fresher and potentially more food friendly."

"Overall: I haven't had Vampire slayer fresh, but this bottle was absolutely delicious so I can't imagine the age did anything but improve it! I will have to get a hold of a fresh bottle to see if this is indeed the case."

""
""
""
""

"Overall, a pretty good imperial stout with most components playing nicely with each other yet with a slightly disjointed feel. Still, the beer is rich and flavorful, keeps the ABV reined in nicely, and generally fits the bill for the style."
""
""
"O- This was an awesome beer! I usually drink half of a bomber before sitting down to review, but this time, I only had about a cup left before it even crossed my mind. I loved how the mouthfeel complimented the flavors. I can't really explain how it did, but they went together wonderfully to me! I would drink this again in a heartbeat!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Nice beer, but for the price I'd sooner grab a 4 pack of Grand Teton Black Cauldron for my smokey impy fix. More roasted depth would've been nice. Likley a one and done for me due to the high price tag."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bomber into a wide mouth pint glass. Was a deep black with little transparency around the edges, and very little head. Smelled of chocolate, a hint of coffee and smokey alcohol. Taste was led with a dark chocolate flavor, followed by a mix of smoke and coffee with a tart cherry and cranberry finish. Really liked the complexity of the taste, which really came out as it warmed up. There was a little bit of carbonation in the mouth, but was still substantial. I really enjoyed this beer. It was balanced, yet complex. A very satisfying stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If there is such thing as the perfect imperial stout, in my eyes, this is it! This beer truly left me in awe. This bottle made it's way to my cellar from Alabama over a year ago when Clown Shoes wasn't available here in Iowa - oh how things change. Clown Shoes is now readily available here and if this beer is any indication of the quality they're capable of producing, consider me a fan for life. This is art, no question about it. With a few small tweaks to encourage head retention, this would be perfect! Do yourself a favor and grab this if you see it - you will not be disappointed!"

"Overall - A really nice American stout. Really balanced well, smooth and easy to enjoy. The smell might make you thing this would be a smokey monster but, with the added sugars, and chocolate, really balance this beer out. Great drink, glad I got to try."

"O: Even with a good dose of smoked malts, this beer is seamlessly smooth and pleasantly drinkable. Time was very kind to it as well. One of Clown Shoe's better offerings."

"Overall I thought this was a really nice beer and a really nice example of a Smoked Stout, the smoked aspect and the Stout aspect were balance very nicely and neither one was too overpowering and I think that gave this beer the pretty much perfect amount of balance that a Smoked Stout should have. This beer had good drinkability, it was fairly smooth, the alcohol was hidden well for the most part and was a little warming, it was rich, pretty filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, If I really wanted to I think I could take out the bomber by myself, but I think this is a good beer for splitting with someone and I think one glass is close to the right amount for me. What I liked the most about this beer was the balance, to me that was the highlight of this beer and it was just where I would want it to be. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad at all, but I wish it had just a little less carbonation. I would buy this beer again if I saw another bottle and I would like to see how it changes over time. I would recommend this beer to people who like Smoked Stouts and I think it's balanced enough that most Stout lovers would like it to. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, I heard it was pretty good and usually brewers bring out some pretty good beers for anniversary's, but I was still impressed with how good this beer is and it pretty much has everything that I look for in a Smoked Stout. Great job guys, this was very enjoyable beer and I liked that you released a style that I think doesn't get enough credit, thanks a lot and keep up the great work. Now I'm really kicking myself for not buying the barrel aged version when I had the chance, I won't make that mistake again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a solid stout. I definitely like the balance of the smokiness though, as many smoky beers can be overwhelming."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth as Lou Rawls' voice and rich with just a hint of drying in the finish. Full bodied with a commendably light carbonation. A serious sipping beer, deserving of at least 30 minutes to warm and come into its own full bloom. Get one, or three, and enjoy."

"Not bad at all. It's not exactly anything unique or out of the ordinary, in my opinion, but it's well crafted and pretty enjoyable."

"22oz bomber: This one pours an inky, opaque dark brown color. There was a very small brown head on it that didn’t linger long or leave any lacing. The nose is good. Touch of smoke, just a hint of alcohol. Chocolate, dark fruits, hint of spruce: there is a lot going on in there. The taste is good. A bit of a sweetness to it. Some espresso, chocolate, spruce, dark fruits and some bitterness/dryness in the finish. This is really good!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a blackish body with one finger tan head and slight lacing around glass. Aroma is mostly roasted malts with some chocolate and a touch of coffee mixed in. Smooth, slightly sweet due to chocolate malts, easy to drink with decent balance, a little bit of caramel and vanilla as well. Not the most active stout but balanced with no overpowering malts and the booziness is kept to a minimum."

"O-A decent imperial stout that was much better than I expected. Even though the licorice is dominant to me I still really enjoyed this and plan on buying another bottle to cellar for a year or 2 to see how it may mature."

"Clown Shoes Vampire Slayer ---4/5."
""
"Overall, $10 for 22oz equates to... I don't know. $5.40 or something like that for 12oz. Given that, it's not exactly worth that price, considering there are some Imperial Stouts that are nearly as good (or better) for quite cheaper. Take for instance, FBS. Because of the price, I give this beer a 4.25 overall, but the look, taste, and feel are all on point. I'm impressed. One of the very best beers I've had."

"I don't know that Vampire Slayer was actually brewed with holy water or malts smoked over stakes that were used to kill vampires, but whatever Clown Shoes did, it worked. The world may not need more vampires but it can never have too many roasty, chocolatey, high-gravity stouts so far as I'm concerned. This anniversary ale should have been made eternal."
""
"Overall these guys really do make a good imperial that makes me wonder how much better the Bourbon aged version of this would be. On the other hand it's kind of an expensive so its defiantly not an everyday beer. I love imperial stouts and this ones a winner."
""
"Pours black with a small foamy head that quickly fades to a ring. Aromas are burnt wood, citrus hops, brown sugar, dark roast malt, light smoke, and dark fruit. Taste has a very nice brown sugar sweetness up front with a strong bitter, hoppy finish. Burnt wood, roasted coffee, and dark fruit show up strong as well. Medium body, nice mouthfeel."
""
""
"O - Slightly disappointing and definitely not worth $10 (this is Maui though, so everything's pretty pricey). Maybe it wasn't stored appropriately for the 6 months before it met me. Who knows. Good not great, but I'd still be interested to try it fresh, if only for comparisons sake."
""
"I've really enjoyed this one, though not perfect, it has a lot going for it. Pitch black color, dark tan head, lots of nice lacing throughout. There's not much in the smell - liquorice, some chocolate, alcohol, currants; just OK, not one thing jumping out. I'll say that the feel is just about perfect for me and an imperial stout: creamy, not too much carbonation, no syrupy stickiness, just heavy enough. There's a bit too much booze in the flavor for me, right up front, and sugar. But more liquorice, anise, some charcoal and smoke, dark chocolate, some sour maltiness."

"single finger thick tan head on a jet black body with no light getting through. Nice lacing. Aroma of dark fruit, vanilla, some roasted malts, smoke and licorice. Flavor follows with a fairly sweet flavor with mostly chocolate, vanilla, roasted malts, oak, and brown sugar. Thick full body and lightly carbonated. Very good and complete/complex imperial stout. Its a tough genre to be memorable in but this one is solid."
"Black body, dark tan head. Aromas of vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and whiskey. Thick malt up front with dark milk chocolate and lots of coffee. Medium thick body, average cqrbonaatin, and a fairly sweet finish. Nicely done, very rich aroma and a flavor profile to match."
""
""
"Main gripe: a bit too sweet."
""
""
""
""
""

"I do like this beer. I pours nice and dark dark brown with a thin tan head. Caramel and campfire come through on the nose. A little roast astringency intertwined with spicy hops create a little twang in the nostrils. A little hot on the tongue, but the caramel and hints of smoke come through nicely. Not overly long but pleasant and drinkable. Good mouthfeel, a little thick a little oily. I would have expected hoppier from an ""American imperial stout", but perhaps the ""American"" is the smoky twist. Good stout."

"Black in color. Poured with a thick, rich, cappucino-like, beige foam that left random sticky lacings on the glass. Dark roasted malt, dark chocolate and charred malt aromas up front. Earthy hop and brown sugar aromas at the back end followed by definitive booziness. Rich, smooth, slightly chewy feel. Dark chocolate and dark roasted malt flavors followed by charred malt. Dark fruit flavors into the middle as pine hop bitterness engulfs the malty, dark sugary sweetness. Finishes with lingering pine hop bitterness, charred malt, dark chocolate and boozy notes. A fabulous variety of bold flavors. The hoppiness sneaks up on you at first but does a great job reigning in the intense malt flavors."

"I think this'll be a pass from me from now on, not only because of the price, but because I enjoy some of Clown Shoes' other available offerings much more than this one. The sweetness was more on the anise, dark fruit kind of side (though chocolate was still a big factor), but I really was yearning for more brown sugar, vanilla, etc... Not bad, just not exactly my thing."
""
"I downgraded my taste and overall, on the more I drank, the harder it was for me to finish."
"Big sticky, bitter and sweet. I can see myself revisting this. Especially for the sub$10 price."

"Overall - 4.25 - It's a good beer to enjoy slowly. Doesn't taste like any other imperial stout, which I like about it. I like the bottle. It's a shame that some asshole had to ruin this awesome beer's name by suing over something stupid. Check out the article, some dumbass actually though this could be confused with Vampire Pale Ale - a belgian pale ale. F*** that, this is an awesome beer, and I love it's name just the way it is."

"Got in a trade with Cyde. 22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled 12/2011. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light char, toast, toffee, wood, smoke, coffee, vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark and roasted malt notes with moderate smoke presence; and good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, toffee, light char, wood, smoke, coffee, vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, toffee, light char, smoke, coffee, vanilla, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors; with moderate smoke balance and zero cloying flavors on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick, creamy, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice smoked imperial stout. All around nice balance, complexity, and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the gravity. A very enjoyable offering."

"o: i think this needs some time to let the alcohol mellow. its still an easy drinker, but the alcohol could be a little better harmonized. its not a bad imperial stout, but there are better ones out there"

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Fair head and minute lacing. Nose is complex combination of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, licorice and something floral...I think. Pungent malt, roasted coffee, and a harsh liquor character. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"22 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like dark fruit, chocolate, burnt/charred malt, and a bit of coffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some molasses, smoked malt and vanilla. Has a good sweet and burnt/roasty flavor overall. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and slick with moderate carbonation. I think it's an enjoyable brew, I'd buy it again. $10.49 a bomber."

"Like Kim Kardasian, looks are deceiving. A full body apperance, with a trunk full of junk. That is a little too harsh as i know how well reviewed this offering is, but you get my point. Flavor complexities that still need to be worked out, with high points of coffee grinds, burnt chocolate but a thin, syrupy mouthfeel that missed the richness of some others. The dark, thin head stayed, with low carbonation that needed more balance for me to want to try it again."
"I don't always drink stout, but when I do, it will most likely not be another Vampire Slayer. The color was a mix of dark raspberry and dark roast coffee beans, with a thin layer of foam, which on looks alone, seemed very promising. However, upon first sip, I found it somewhat syrupy and not as smooth as its looks, with taste notes that was a cross between black licorice and soy sauce. This was not a thirst quencher, but more like a meal. For these same reasons, it's probably a great drink for those who appreciate a good hearty imperial stout. As a fan of True Blood, glad I tried it, but may have been too big of a bite for this IPA-er."

""
"Overall, a decent imperial stout."
""
"O: At first sip, this beer was great; the more I started drinking it, though, the rauch tastes really cut into the impact of the roasts and the residual sugars, leaving the whole palate a bit subdued. That said, even at “subdued” levels, this beer does not disappoint, and not only because it’s one of the only stouts like this I’ve tasted – it really is satisfying."
""
""
""
""
""
"The alcohol comes through in the taste. The body is neutral for the style. The carbonation is similar. Semi-sweet chocolate is the predominant flavor. I do not detect much hop. The alcohol warms the swallow, but the aftertaste is short with a touch of chalkiness."
""
""
"This is the second in the Anniversary Ale series. If I'm not mistaken though, this will be generally available year round. The appearance is nearly perfect, black as night with a pillow of fluffy tan sitting on top, coating the glass with sticky lace all the way through. It smells beautiful, with vanilla extract and dark fruits being subdued by roasted grains and dark chocolate. The aroma does nothing to suggest how smoky this brew really is. As a fan of Rauchbier, this was much to my delight. The initial punch of bittersweet chocolate, caramel and dash of espresso is followed by an even more bitter dryness and charred feel. It's very boozy, I am feeling slightly buzzed already after drinking down this bomber myself. Perhaps I rushed a bit because it's so good! Recommended to share with or a friend or when you are feeling like staying in and enjoying a rich & decadent treat!"

""
""
""
"Poured dark brown-black, translucent around the edges, transient head and no lace. Smells of roasted caramel malt and chocolates. Taste is toasted marshmallows, charred toast, semisweet chocolate, hint of anise, dark roast coffee, dark cherries, interplay of light bitterness and light sweetness. Medium body, velvety mouthfeel, mildly carbonated. Very tasty although the body is a little lighter than I expected. Good one."
""
""

"O: Very nice take on the style. A warm, happy sip."
"O: Not as interesting as the Unidragon, but a solid effort nonetheless. I enjoyed trying this one from Clown Shoes, don't know why their bombers have to be so expensive."

""
"O: A fine addition to the Clown Shoes stable. Welcome it into your household. Its bite makes you want to become one with the night."

""
"D: This was more like a smoky RIS than a hoppy American stout. Either way, I really liked the scent and taste and body. The finish was smooth with well hidden alcohol, so it was surprisingly easy to drink. Could probably age well, but nice fresh. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is definitely very good stuff. I love how expressive it is, and yet how it manages to make something new of a well-established genre. The lightness in the feel and the balance that it brings to the palate is very pleasant indeed. Very, very good stuff."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I am not picking up on any coffee and really minimal milk chocolate tones. Also I'm not getting any licorice or anise flavoring that I have been reading about and expecting, which I love in a stout. Nonetheless, this is delicious and definetly worth a try to see what you may get out of it. This is coming on-tap soon in my area and I'm looking forward to it."
"overall - a good beer for their 2nd Anniversary, but doesn't top their other stouts, or the 1st Anniversary beer, the Hoppy Feet 1.5"

""
""
"Overall: Clown Shoes is two-for-two for me. I cannot wait to try Blaecorn Unidragon and their other offerings as well after this and Muffin Top. The factor that stands out about this beer is how well done the smoking is. Typically, smoke overpowers everything else and mutes other flavors, but here it helps the coffee bitterness and mingles well with the chocolate. The folks in Ipswich really know what they are doing. 17/20"
""
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter, bottled on 02/12. This pours a motor oil looking thick, pitch black color with a finger and a half thick mocha colored head which has good retention and leaves a lacing. The smells are of dark chocolate, coco, espresso and roasted malts. The feel is thick and creamy, nice carbonination. The taste is very good, lots of dark chocolate, nice and bitter with a little mouth coating coco. This is an excellent dark chocolate tasting stout, far exceeding expectations."
"This is a solid stout, and I highly recommend it. It is well-made and has a nice complexity as it warms. May be in my top 5 for imperial stouts."
""
""
""
"After trying the Blaecorn Unidragon i didnt think they have another Stout in that calibre anyways lets find out hey and it pours the darkest kola hue with no highlights just pitch dark and leaves a very creamy three finger khaki head with similar lacing,the smell is coffee,smoked wood,bourbon,tobacco,booze and dark chocolate,the mouthfeel is creamy full bodied with moderate carbonation and has tastes of chocolate coated cherries,mocha,molasses,a nice hit of smokiness,brown sugar and finished with a dark chocolate bittersweetness and overall its very nice and yeah id buy it again cheers."
""
""
""
""
"O: A good big double stout, without adjuncts or barrels or any of the other bells or whistles. Smoke component was lighter than I thought it'd be (judging by the label). To my palate Blaecorn Unidragon is a bit better."
""
"This is a medium to fuller bodied brew with a modest amount if carbonation. It is chewy and slick in the feel almost oily like cacao nibs or an imperial version of an oatmeal stout. Pretty dexent and worth seeking out. The alcohol is hidden very well. Now that I know I cak acquire this within the state, I might pick oke of these up again."
""
"Overall, a very good beer, which needs to balance the taste with the aroma. A smoother flavor should come from the taste- the current finish offsets balance in the beer."
""
""
"This is a very good beer. Sadly, I think I'm more amused by the holy water and vampire killing stake-smoked malt gimmicks than the actual beer. It tastes like a Castlevania game, but not the best in the series. In other words, this does not reach a Castlevania: Symphony of the Night or Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow level of excellence. But it's at least as good as Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia. To the small percentage of the BA community that gets this analogy, I thank you."
""
""
"Overall: A very enjoyable ADIS that can be enjoyed over and over. Merry Christmas to me. This can be enjoyed any day of the year too."
"O: Good imperial stout, but fairly plain. Wouldn't recommend it, but it's definitely serviceable."
""
""
"Wow. It's carries a really nice three-way balance between smoked malt, charred malts, and sweet dark fruits. The smoke almost makes for a sort of psuedo-tartness that fades out as the smoke vacates in the finish, leaving just the char and sweet to linger in the mouth. If I had to pick something to criticize, it would be the nose, which does NOT display all of the flavor elements as faithfully as it could have. MIA from nose but present in the flavor: nuttiness, a faint olive oil background garnish, a majority of the dark fruit sweetness, and almost all of the chocolate malt tones. Even so, it's worth saying that the nose isn't terrible per se... it's just muted and not as complex as the flavor."

"Served in a tulip, solid black, minimal head of dark colored foam. Sweet and mildly roasted malt nose. The flavor has a nice medium sweetness to it. Light chocolate, coffee, roasted malts with a hint of smoked malt. Very smooth and feels lighter than 10%. Surely would not have guessed this to be that high of an abv because the alcohol is not detected at all. Overall a very nice imperial stout that drinks quite easily."
"The beer is opaque. Thin light brown head leaves spotty lace. Aroma is molasses, dark chocolate and cherry. Flavor is solid. Great base of roasted malts and chocolate tones. Roasted malts even bring a nice little bitter astringency to the profile. Also some dark fruits, anise oil and leaf tobacco. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated. Somewhat velvety. Alcohol is barely present and incorporated nicely into the whole context of the beer. Nice beer."

"O= This is another great imperial stout from Clown Shoes. I will say I think the other one I had is a little more impressive but this is a fabulous beer regarless. Check this out if you can. It's a fine beer."

"Poured into a large brandy snifter. Pours black with a finger-length tan head. There are some visible bubbles along the underside of the head and along the side of the glass. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass as the head dissipates. There are aromas of dark roasted malt, dark fruits, chocolate, coffee, and some of that 10% alcohol comes up to the nose. I get some of that smoke as well from the smoked malt. The flavors are very complex in this stout. There's nice dark roasted malt flavor with creamy chocolate, black coffee, dates, smoked malt, and some alcohol. It's a wonderfully balanced flavor. The body is full with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The carbonation is moderate. This is a very easy beer to drink despite the alcohol presence. This is an excellent beer."
""
"Overall, a very solid beer from Crown Shoes. I really like the hints of smoke, works well here."
"Overall: rich but harsh as hell nose. Mellow, creamy and complex taste. Interesting, decadent imp stout."

"A little spice on the backend may actually be leftover from the gwack-a-mole, but either way it's enjoyable. I was excited for this beer, and it was warranted. Definitely one to find and drink if it's around."

"Recommended by Beer Lady at Tully’s in Wells, ME - THANK YOU! This is a very nice stout. Not much of a head on the pour - kind of a smallish khaki/tan head, nice mahogany tints. Expectation was for a whallop of flavor, but found it more subtle and with a lot going on. Cocoa, some smokiness,, a bit of vanilla hiding in there, just enough hops to keep the flavor interesting. Nice malts, good ""undertones"" of the coffee/roast flavors. Not as ""thick"" on the tongue as other imperials, but very nice. Minimal aftertaste. Definitely high on the list of faves. No doubt about the 10% ABV...it isn't shy. A lot of complexity and subtle flavors going on, yet it isn't ""work"" to drink. Good effort from CS!"
"Notes: Full bodied and very flavorful, with incredible balance. Alcohol is hardly noticeable, except for a slight warming sensation with each sip. I really enjoy this beer, and wish I would have bought some more to age. With this being my first experience with Clown Shoes, I can say I am thoroughly impressed. Well-done!"

"overall, i thought it was a well made imperial stout. nothing that blew me away, but an enjoyable drink. nice creamy texture and rich flavors, but seems a bit muted and not terribly complex. still, the price wasnt terrible at $9 a bomber and i might pick it up again. a good imperial stout, but nothing that makes it stand out and take it to the next level."
"The beer pours a rouge black near to midnight with a light tan quarter fingers width head. It sits in the glass completely opaque, which is quite encouraging. Lacing is thin and splotchy along the sides of the glass. On the nose the beer smells of a mélange of different things. Slight roasted malt sits alongside dark chocolate, coffee, a damp bready smell, and the faintest hint of citrus hops and an even fainter hint of sweet alcohol. This beer tastes rich and creamy with great splashes of coffee, chocolate, and the faintest hint of smoked malts and woods. The beer begins as sweet cream and slight alcohol before opening into cream and coffee with chocolate side notes and a lingering faint bitter note of citrus, pine, and smoky camp fire. This beer feels fantastic of on the mouth. Thick and creamy with a soft carbonation that caresses the tongue in a beautiful embrace. This beer has a light chewiness to it as well, and leaves the mouth slightly wet, but the tongue feels dry with coffee and smoke. Overall this is a great success from Clown Shoes. The mouthfeel is succulent and smooth, and overall this beer is delicious for sipping with nice complexity, and great full flavors. This beer is worth drinking for sure!"

"O- This beer made me realize I definitely have a strong liking to smoked beers. The smoky element definitely add's to this and makes it really work. What may be the best aspect about this beer is how drinkable it is, and the fact you can't detect any alcohol. I sat on this several months, but will sit on the Blaecorn Unidragon even longer. It'd be nice if they brew this again."
"Served on draft, poured into a narrow tulip. About a finger of tan head recedes after a few minutes leaving pleanty of cling, but nothing else. Looks awesome. Blacker than coffee. I don't really smell anything -- chocolate and maybe some light malt/molasses, but not much (smell increases over time to incorporate warm chocolate and booze). Taste is awesome. Chocolate, coffee, molasses and a bit of smoke and tobacco, yum. Mouthfeel is very nice, smooth with prefect amount of bitterness. Overall this is a great beer, wish it smelled a bit more intense, would love to have this agian. Cheers."

"Clown Shoes makes a decent beer, but I really don't like their labels. Anyway, this beer pours a remarkable head considering the strength of a beer. On that alone I have to give it the 5 for appearance because I can't recall ever seeing such a thick head on a beer of this strength. Smell is of burnt malts, taste of bitter chocolate. A little syrupy feel. Overall, it's a tasty beer. Any fan of imperial stouts will enjoy this, but they may also have a hard time remembering it."

"Drink- I was a bit gun shy to grab this one back in June, so I bought it anyway and let it sit. Dont think it changed much since bottling in Feb. Good stout with great base flavors. Lacking a little bit of pop, but much better than Blaecorn. I would have this one again."
"O-its not an original tasting stout, but its very good. it came at a pretty decent price considering this big flavor. it'll definitely satisfy any big AIS craving you have."

"O - 4.25 - This is a fine stout that starts off maybe a little simpler than I'd like but improves throughout the bottle/glass. Be sure not to drink it straight out of the fridge. I gave mine about 20 minutes sitting out and it still improved as it warmed from that point in the glass and open bottle over the next 20 minutes. It's more complex by the end, both in nose and body. I place this somewhere between solid and excellent."

"O:	Very complex while remaining balanced and very drinkable… in fact, I just realized now that this is also a 10% ABV. You would never know it was given this brew’s appearance, nose, or taste. The alcohol is well hidden within this multifaceted beer. As I mentioned above, the bitterness from the hops is a great changeup for a beer of this style; it’s not always quite as detectable. This is a very well crafted beer, indeed. Wonderful stout."

"Overall another solid brew in the Clown Shoes lineup - definitely worth a shot."
"Whew, this tastes big and I'm not sure if the cask does it any favours. A bit more body might have helped to round things out. As is, the low carbonation let the alcohol run a bit wild."
""
""

"overall, not a bad beer at all. Don't know if I'd have it again. This is obviously not a session beer."

"Medium bodied but a bit thinner than expected with a strong roasted malt presence that is sligtly dry and acrid but not overwhelmingly so.  Hints of burnt toast, deeply roasted coffee, dark chocolate and oatmeal.  Very bitter with subtle hops complimenting the dry, roasted notes.  Subtle lactic presence and some chocolate sweetness. Finishes with boozy heat that gives off a lot of alcohol flavor.  Astringent dry boozy finish.  Looks and smells nice but the flavor doesn't follow through."

"The beer is black with a half inch of tan head. The aroma is a bit sweet, lightly roasted, a hint of coffee and chocolate - smells fine. Nice flavor. Rich and medium to full bodied. Moderate carbonation. A light bitterness in the finish with a hint of coffee. Overall, this was enjoyable. I would have this again."
""
"O: Very nice imperial stout here. All the flavors blend into each other well and are noticeable with no one particular note overpowering the other. Clown Shoes does it again!"
""
"M - Medium body. Creamy. Light carbonation."
"22oz bottle with a Bottled 2/2012 on the side. Pours a dark black color with an inch of brown head. Lots of lacing. Aromas of smoke, roasted malts, dark chocolate and earthiness. Taste is smokey with some chocolate and roasted malts. The smoke flavor sticks around for awhile. Dark chocolate and smoke finish. Somewhat boozey but drinks fairly easy considering the ABV, chocolate and smoke flavors. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. I would be intersted in seeing how this one ages. Overall, a nice smokey and chocolatey Imperial Stout."
""
" Just wish I wish had bought another bottle to cellar a bit. I wish it had eithet a bit more hop bitternss or roasty bitterness, but its a damn fine beer."
"This is a fantastic beer. It has great chocolate notes throughout and great complementary roasted malt and coffee notes. The drinkability is pretty high considering the ABV. Overall, I give this a must try."
""
"O- I'm not a smoke beer fan, this is an exception though. This would really go well with a dessert of some sort or a nice BBQ meat choice."
"O- This was a very good imperial stout. I think its pretty much up there (especially in aroma) with stone's RIS, Speedway Stout, and other imperials in the top 100. The light smokiness definitely added a nice complexity to the beer. Along with Blaecorn Unidragon, Clown Shoes definitely makes some great imperial stouts. I definitely recommend trying them, they are among some of my favorites."

"Compared to the pitch black Blecorn Unidragon I pored yesterday, this beer looked lighter in color. It was almost ruby red to dark brown with a beige head. The aroma was quite smoky with lots of chocolate and hops coming through as well. The taste was astringent bitter at the tip of tongue, tempered immediately with a mocha like sweetness which lingered. The finish was dry and smoky. Very easy drinking for a double digit ABV beer. The buffy (heh) body was quite chewy, with a grainy palette. Very good take on the style, with a creative label embellishment. Since it contains holy water, all sins I commit before, during, and after will be washed right away."
"O: an impressive beer that improved as I continued to drink it. A fine effort from the folks at Clown Shoes. Cheers."
""
"Overall, very glad to have had the opportunity to try this one - thanks man!"
""
""
""

"Pours a pitch black with a huge foamy coffee colored head that left a lot of lacing and you could float a bottle cap on. The smell has lots of coffee and milk chocolate with an herbal hoppy background. It tastes of sweet molasses and bitter dark chocolate with coffee grinds and a slight citrusy bitterness. It's thick with low carbonation and a dry finish. This is an awesome beer, up there with the best imperial stouts."

"O - I was looking forward to trying this beer and snagged one on a recent trip to Total Wine in Claymont, DE. I thought it was fantastic and I ill seek it out again. At $6.99/bomber it's a steal."

"O - This is an interesting stout with a unique composition. I heard many good things about the brews from Clown Shoes, namely that this was their signature beer. That said, I paid around $10 for a 22oz and I cannot justify such a steep price for a beer I see as average amongst the wide selection of quality stouts, of which are much more widely available."
""
"Pours a two finger tan head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Black color, no highlights.  Medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied.   Roasted malt nose and flavor is slightly sweet smoky chocolate. Decent imp stout.  High ABV is hidden. $10.35 for a 22oz bottle from Bert's Better Beers Hooksett, NH"
""
"(D)- Overall, a solid stout. Definitely heavy towards the dark fruits realm, but it is well-done."
""
""
"This is probably the best Clown Shoes beer I've had. Very drinkable impy stout."

""
"The beer pours a deep inky black color with a tan head. The aroma is full of heavily roasted malts with a little bit of chocolate and some alcohol thrown in. The flavor is a little more complex. I get a lot of roasted malt and a slight bit of char, as well as some dark chocolate and alcohol. There is also a little bit of sweetness that is similar to molasses. Medium carbonation and thick, full mouthfeel."
""
""
"22oz. bottle served at 52 degrees in my KTG snifter. Pours about a shade darker than cola with a frothy, half-inch, khaki-colored head embedded with ringlets. Head eventually dissipates into a thin tight band around the shoulders and a creamy dollop across the center. Some spots and thin arcs of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose is fairly average - a suggestion of dark malts, a hint of char and a slightly metallic quality. Taste follows nose - malt profile is a bit more evident. There's also a bit of sugary sweetness (brown sugar and/or molasses) that peaks out towards the middle, but is quickly replaced by an earthy bitterness at the finish. There's also a bit of an artificial sweetener character, and the slightly metallic quality evident in the nose also re-asserts itself. Mouthfeel is medium-light (but closer to medium), with a slightly oily consistency and somewhat of a coarse carbonation. Overall, not sure what the hype is about this beer. At $9.99 for a non-BA bomber, I was expecting something a bit more than what was offered, but what I found was a fairly lackluster stout that doesn't really come together for me."
"O: I actually dug this one more that their RIS and I think it will be much more acceptable to people."
""
"Strong, smoky aroma has notes of licorice, quality coffee and molasses plus a hint of semi-sweet chocolate. Pours a deep, warm sable with a thick and fine-bubbled tan head that leaves some generous lacing. Lip-smacking smoky flavor has firm chocolate, coffee, molasses and toffee notes with hints of licorice and caramel. It is somewhat sweet, but not overly so. Smooth texture has above-average body and a decent amount of fizz that leaves a fairly persistent tingle in the mouth and on the lips. I’m a big stout lover, and this is now on my list of faves."
"Rich, with nice depth. I want more of these."
""
""
""
"O: Fantastic!!"

"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being moderate for the style. Overall, it was a pretty solid beer of the style. Nicely balanced and relatively easy drinking. Very enjoyable beer to sip on this evening."
"Highly, highly recommended."
""
"O: This is a tasty stout and something I'd like to see with a year of age or more. Some of that dark roasted flavor needs to be rounded out to make this really good."
""
"D: certainly a well-made stout from clown shoes, but im not exactly blown-away here. maybe i just had some higher expectations from some other high reviews/past clown shoes beers. worth trying, but not worth going out of your way for."

""
""
"22 oz bomber pours an opaque black with tan head and great lacing. Initial aroma note is alcohol, with smokey malt, cocoa, and coconut. Taste is roasted malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, slight licorice. Mouth feel has a kick while at the same time smooth with nice aftertaste which leaves you wanting more. Overall a very solid Imperial Stout, complex, smooth, and highly drinkable."
""
""
"Another really good thick stout from Clown Shoes. Yum."
"O: Overall a very nice Imperial Stout. Great roasted malt flavor balanced by a nice sweetness. A bit on the bitter side, but not over the top bitter. Nothing really wows me about the beer, but it's quite nice overall."
"O- This is my first beer from Clown Shoes and it is a good one. There is a good amount of smokiness, and it is not overwhelming."
"O: This beer is definitely drinkable. It's a potent, enjoyable brew."
""
"Until this month, never even heard of these guys, but they sure know their business when it comes to imperial stouts - Russian and American."
"Overall: Paired well with a revisit of Super Castlevania IV for the SNES, one of the few games from my aging childhood gaming systems that doesn't require too much in the way of blowing out or Q-tip rubdowns."
""
"O: Very little presence of alcohol in this beer - not really detectable in the smell, taste, or mouthfeel - which is surprising considering the high ABV. The beer has a very nice flavor and aroma with a significant amount of complexity. I really enjoyed sipping on this beer and would gladly have it again in the future."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice black color, nice carbonation, with a nice little fizzy/creamy light tan head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is very nice, malty, with some very nice chocolate/toffee notes, nice vanilla scent, roasty, nutty. The taste is exceptional, malty, very nice vanilla note, chocolaty, toffy, with some coffee notes. Medium body, kinda chewy, ABV hidden very well. Love these Clown Shoes brews, thanks Ben."
""
"O: Tastes like a chocolate milk shake. Not sweet or heavy. Very rich in flavor sitting right between complex and simple. Perfect beer for dessert after a hearty meal."
""
""
""
"O: The alcohol in this beer is remarkably well hidden, which makes it quite easy to drink compared to others in the style."
"Pours an opaque black with a 1 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and some slight smoke aromas. There is also a cinnamon aroma that comes out as the beer warms. Taste is of dark roasted malt, smoked malt, and coffee bean flavors. The alcohol comes out more as the beer warms. There is a nice roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a slight crispness with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good stout that rises above its gimmicky description for a really tasty beer."
"22 oz bomber in a duvel tulip. Pours black with a 2 inch beige head that slowly recedes to a finger with great sticky lacing. Aroma is roasted barley, dark coffee, smoke, and there's a sweetness to it. Taste is tons of toasted barley. Semisweet chocolate, coffee, smoke, and sweet cream is there too. Mouthfeel is kinda chewy and alcohol is well hidden. Will buy this again for sure."
""
""
""
"Overall a touch above average. After hearing so many good things and the local stores selling out immediately. I figured this was exceptional but in the end just a decent stout."
"O: Great smokey flavor and a highly recommended imperial stout. This one was very easy to drink and really hit the spot. Thanks again Rizalini!"
""
"Was excited to try this beer when I saw it on the menu at TJ's. However, I can't say I was exactly bowled over by the beer, though it was decent. Oh well..."

"This beer poured out as a deep black color. It had a thin brown colored head on top. The smell of the beer gave off some nice roasted malt aromas along with some interesting chocolate and coffee note. The taste was roasted with a light sweetness up front along with some bitter coffee notes finishing it off. The mouthfeel had a good amount of body to it, there were some light bubbles in there to break up the oily texture just a bit. Overall it's a good beer and I would enjoy having it again some day."
"O/D-Overall, this is a pretty tasty brew. Another good anniversary beer. Very flavorful, and the smoke is great. Clown Shoes creates awesome beers, and this is one of my favorites."
"SOLID; NOT A MUST HAVE!"
""
""
""
"Poured jet black into an imperial nonic thick one finger deep beige crown atop that left multple ringes of lace as it settled into a frothy mass.Chocolate,roast,smoke,and fruity esters in the nose,it's very nice if it packed alittle more puch it would be off the charts.Full chewey feel to the beer really enhances the flavor nuances.Lightly smoked and earthy rawness mixed with bitter chocolate and mild fruit on the palate provide for a well rounded brew.A great beer in my mind,the best Clown Shoes beer I have had,a tad above Hoppy Feet 1.5.As I drink more some alcohol induced and molasses-like sweetness comes into play more."
"The feel of this beer is big but does not put on airs. It hides the amount of alcohol it has with some nice body that is smaller then the ABV would make you believe. It drinks real well and is a bit deceiving for a beer this strong."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, roast bomb, beast stout. Tasty, well-balanced. It will be purchased again."
""
"Vampire Slayer goes in the glass looking black like a stout. Black as night with a tannish head up above with splotches. Nice retention. Smell is Very roasted malt forward. A pungent scent ala Storm King. Some old world character,dark fruit with some coffee and licorice and bakers chocolate. Tasting this, It's apparent this is a big ass stout. Chocolate, coffee, licorice, cocco nibs, a hint of alcohol. One thing about these clown Shoes beers is that the alcohol is hidden very well in most offerings. Feel is full, carb is there, goes down smooth with a bit of warming. Glad I had it on tap because 22oz's of this would of been a chore."
""
" O- I like this imperial stout, but it's nothing mind blowing. I've only had a few imperial stouts that have a big time grape flavor like this one, so it gets a little bonus for being a bit unique. The smooth mouthfeel stands out as well. I like this a bit more than my score indicates. I like this as much as other beers I have rated 4.2 or so, the problem is that no one rating category on this beer is super high."
"A highly enjoyable double stout, and the mld smokiness is a nice touch. Worth trying. But if you're really looking to slay vampires, it needs garlic."
""
"I'll go find some unidragon to compare this too and re-visit this some time. Very promising."
""
"The body if full and chewy with silky carbonation. Real nice bottle here from these guys. Very enjoyable."
"Cheers!"

"This is the best beer I've had from Clown Shoes and the most recent I've had since Blaecorn Unidragon. I'm beginning to think they should put out some more stouts, because they do them exceedingly well."
""
"Another satisfying brew from Clown Shoes. Happy 2 years to them. I look forward to trying even more of their lineup now that they've expanded distribution in Georgia. It was probably even better than I reviewed but had the distinct misfortune of following a glass of Abyss. Nonethess, I had zero problems putting away the entire bomber myself, enjoying every drop. I'm glad to have tried it and plan to age a few to see how it evolves."
"O: All in all, this is probably the best beer I've had from CS. It's definitely a smoked stout, but it has some nice roasty porterish notes blending well with the smoke. If you like your stouts roasty, give this one a go."
"Dense mouthfeel that shows very little of alcohol for the high abv. A very drinkable and enjoyable brew."
"Certainly the favorite Clown Shoes release that I've tried."
"Another impressive stout from clown shoes!"
"O- Overall, I really enjoyed this beer and hope Clown Shoes adds it to their regular lineup or at least makes it a seasonal. Happy Second Anniversary!"

"If you're ready for an RIS, this is one to try-- walk a mile for it!"

"O – If you like Imperial Stouts on the sweet side with a lot of chocolate character, pick this up immediately! I can’t get over how much this actually tastes like a S’more. Obviously couldn’t drink more than one, but that’s like saying you couldn’t eat more than one chocolate cake; it’s that rich. Overall, an exceptional effort. This will now be my dessert beer of choice. Kudos to Clown Shoes."
""

"O: I wish this beer was easier to get is western PA. It has exactly what I want in a stout. Guess I'll just have to wait for Stone RIS to get here."
""
""

"This is a very tasty beer that's got a nice mouthfeel. It's very drinkable for 10% abv."
"Pours near black with a thin off white head and a touch of lacing. Thin lacing. The nose has a good bit of chocolate and some faint roast. The flavor is fairly similar with good chocolate and a bit of booze. Medium body with adequate carbonation and a slightly-boozy finish. Pretty good."
"This is an excellent beer. Great bold roasty and chocolately flavors and aromas lead the way but don't completely take over and let some secondary characteristics show through. Definitely surprised that the beers feels the way it does with such a high ABV as well. Very well done."
""
"Overall, I think it rocks. I am generally skeptic when trying such big and monstrous beers, but this one really shocked and impressed me. I may be more willing to try and big ones more often now."
""
""
"As far as this beer goes against other big stouts I wouldn’t put it up with Stone’s RIS or North Coast’s Old Rasputin but I like it a lot. It delivers a lot of flavor and kick. As mentioned above some of the flavors are not consistent the whole way through. Part of me thinks it could be a little more ironed out and another part thinks it’s more than fine the way it is since it’s got a real punch. In any case, 22 ounces of this is much more than satisfactory. I'm looking forward to try some more more the Clown Shoes offerings based on this one."
"Beer is medium in body and sweet on the palate, it is nice, a little coffee like bitterness on the end but both my wife and I enjoyed this beer. I'd even have it again."
"What an excellent example of the style. The Russian Imperial Stout places a bigger emphasis on the roasted malt while the American version gravitates more towards sweet, dominant cocoa notes."
"O: This is an exceptional stout, and although I have a weakness and bias toward Guinness...this is a stout on a completely different level of complexity. I will surely buy this again."
""

"O - Overall this is a definate winner from Clown Shoes. These guys can really make a tasty stout. Well worth the pick up."

"O- Very nice brew. I had an expectation of a purely smokey beer, but the depth of this one was a great surprise. Definitely recommending this one to some buddies."
"O - I was truthfully surprised how much I liked this one. I didn't have big expectations for this one at all, but was basically blown away with how good this stout really was. It's available on the shelf, at a great price, and is super-solid. How can I not recommend this beer? Must-try."
""
""
"Pours a solid black color with a creamy white head that shows great retention and lace. Smells of chocolate, coffee, and roast mostly. A modest earthy hop provides little balance. Tastes is roasty and chocolatey as advertised in the aroma. Creamy smooth silky mouthfeel. medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. Nice stout, like a creamy mocha shake, I need to find some bottles of this."
""

"O: Goes down very easy, very tasty, somewhat filling, very well hidden kick, and a nice representation of style. I would absolutely get this brew again!"
""
"D - This is quite good - definitely the best Clown Shoes beer I've had. I'd buy this one again and hope they continue to produce it regularly."
"Ooooh...wow. For a 10%'er, this is freaking fantastic! Very smooth and chocolaty with very little bite or astringency. Very nice Clown Shoes. I liked the Unidragon well enough to buy a couple for the cellar, and was skeptical of this one at first trying to separate itself...but hot damn! This one is tasty and smooth, the ABV is absolutely nowhere to be seen (though I am sure I will feel it soon). Hops still play a factor on the flavor and finish, which adds a nice dimension to it. Yeast is clean and the sweetness is just about perfect. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy with just enough carbonation. It reminds of a fresh (and good batch) of Buried Hatchet with a little bump in alcohol. Just so smooth and tasty. I have not been this surprised by a beer in quite some time. Dont think this would age well though, it is not overly complex. I'll be buying a few more of these for sure, although I would buy alot more if these bastards would put it in six or four-packs at a decent price."
""
""
"O - Overall, I enjoyed this beer and I recommend giving it a shot if you enjoy an ""Imperial American Stout"" now and again."
"o - Overall a pretty nice stout; I liked it a little better then their Blaecorn Unidragon. Some smoke in the nose but I liked the taste better. Would have it again."
"Overall, this is excellent Imperial Stout fare, though anyone not already a fan of big, black, ash-laden stouts will likely gag at the flavors. The beer really is like a cup of strong black coffee and a cigarette, as well as a small caramel candy held under the tongue. Personally, the combination is a huge success, and while I admit that the beer does perhaps suffer from what is perhaps an overabundance of ash (especially in the aftertaste, which becomes overwhelming at times), it still earns Clown Shoes a place of respect in my books."
"Overall: Monster beer. The alcohol is a bit hot and it has me wondering what a year or 3 in the cellar might produce. As it stands today, I'm not sold. Still, a bold and generally clean beer that I would like to try again... when I don't have to wake up the next day."
"There was a shot here for a much higher score, but for some reason, I'm just not feeling the whole package the way I want to. That said, it's an interesting effort and I will recommend it to friends."

"Nice drinkable RIS with good cocoa and fruit notes. Not sure about the holy water but its a good beer for sure. Maybe ill spontaneously combust once finished."
""
"O- This beer is very, very, good right now. When it mellows out with some aging it should be incredible."
"Black with faint ruby edges and a fluffy mocha cap. Good head retention and sticky, clumpy lacing. Roast and milk chocolate aroma, a bit of smoke and citrus, alcohol, cocoa and sugar. Sweetness and alcohol up front with bitterness dominating later on the palate. Caramelized sugar, smoke and roast, slight fruity notes towards the end, caramel and milk chocolate. Full bodied and smooth in texture, alcohol warmth, lowish carbonation, slight astringency. I enjoyed it, though I wonder whether it's made much of an impression on me since there was nothing that really stood out."
"Poured into a 20 oz Duvel tulip, bottle dated 12/11. Pours opaque black, with a large 3 inch head, with great retention that slowly settles into a layer of patchy bubbles, and leaves lace all over the glass. Smell is expresso, tobacco, smoke, and leather. Taste is expresso in the lead and all the other flavors in the background, with a hit of smoke in the finish. Body is large, good amount of life for its large ABV, very lush, and drinkable for its style. This is a very good RIS."
"O: A very solid imperial stout. The smokiness gave it another layer of complexity that I enjoyed and overall the best offering from Clown Shoes IMO."
""
""
"Overall I really like this beer. A little more roasted and smokey than other imperial stouts. I will have this again."
""
""
"Pours jet black with a light mocha head. Smells very toasty, with roasted malt aromas. Taste is rich and heavy, toffee and chocolate notes with a dry hickery smoke finish. The hops are toned down allowing the richness and smokey flavors to come out. More of an export stout then a true imperial stout, at least in my eyes. Overall this is a wonderful smoked stout worthy of a try."
""
"overall - this stout rocks and one i would not age - these smoked stouts do not age well imo - very impressed and if i get the chance i will pick another bottle up to drink before winter is over"
"O - I really like this beer. I consider all the attributes to be a definite re-purchase for me."
"O- Another great beer by Clown Shoes. Great roasted malt and chocolate notes along with the creaminess make this a great imperial stout I could drink regularly."
"A nice imperial stout that is big on the chocolate and roasted flavors. It is lacking something to make it truly exceptional, but is still worth drinking."
""
""
""
"An atypical Double Stout, but no less exciting. Unique and definitely one that I would return. Watch out for the 10% ABV, the dry, nutty, bitter flavors really mask it."
"I have enjoyed all I have tried from Clown Shoes so far. This might be the best one yet!"
"Watching some 40oz Crew vids on YouTube and rockin' a new smoked stout. Good times. This stuff pours a straight onyx topped by over a finger of dark tan foam. ...Maybe it's light sienna... Anyway, the nose comprises heavy chocolate syrup with a twinge of smokey peppers in the distance. Simple, but damn enjoyable! The taste holds notes of dark chocolate/cocoa, mild mesquite smoke, roasted malts, light char, and a nice vein of molasses. Nice. The body is a strong medium/light hefty, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly syrupy/lightly chewy feel. Overall, a very nice stout, one whose smokey components are subdued without being fully subservient (humble, perhaps, is a better word) and the whole thing coming together tastily. Good times, indeed."
"Another excellent beer from Clown Shoes. I prefer the blaecorn unidragon better, but this one is tasty in its own right."

"O- I can see why this is best beer from Clown Shoes. Balanced and full of flavor. One of the better available imperial stouts that isn't some crazy -bal or special release version. Really makes me eager to try a Blaecorn which should be on it's way! Really wish I could give a 4.25... Also, holy water? Really?? Ok, Brewdog..."
""
"There's a big hubbub over the use of holy water in this beer. I don't know that it's any different than a kosher Hebrew beer but my girlfriends Catholic and says it is."
"Overall pretty good, lots of dark malts blended well, light smoke, plenty of roast, chocolate, caramel, then earthy spicy hops, all help to down out the alcohol as it's 10% but doesn't drink like it. The only downfall is the briny light burnt bitterness from all the roasted malts in it, but this is much better than most at that. I think a few of these in the cellar will be nice. This reminds me a lot of Goose Island Night Stalker."
"Pours a deep dark brown, almost black, with moderate mocha head. Smells of roasted malt and faint smoke. Head fades away after a few minutes. Taste is a blend of equal parts roasted/bitter malts, chocolate and smoke. Warming alcohol is felt but not tasted. Lightly carbonated leaving a smooth almost creamy mouthfeel. Pleasantly surprised with this one, will recommend."

"i did not expect to enjoy this beer as much as i did. one of the most unique and memorable stouts i've had in a while. recommended."

"Overall, a nicely balanced stout with a great smoke character and great balance. The idea behind the holy water might be a bit gimmicky, but the beer delivers. The ABV is really hidden well. I will definitely seek this out again. Probably best fresh based on how smooth it is."

"M - No carbonation. Smooth, roasted, malty, delicious beer. Huge fan of this Imperial American Stout. At room temperature it really shines. There's a white/tan sediment layer at the bottom of the glass of which I've never seen in a stout but it's no bother."
