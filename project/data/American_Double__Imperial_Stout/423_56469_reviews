review_text
"12 ounce bottle into snifter, best before 11/4/2016. Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky tan head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, fig, pepper, herbal, light smoke/char, and yeast/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, fig, pepper, herbal, light smoke/char, and yeast/roasted earthiness. Good amount of herbal/roasted bitterness and yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, fig, pepper, herbal, light smoke/char, and yeast/roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Outstanding complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/roasted malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a great malt/yeast and roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and fairly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome Belgian imperial stout. All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/roasted malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
"O - Very good stout - powerful, varied, and avoids being a sipper.  The bite in the close is a bit harsher than I prefer, but still delicious and enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O - Could definitely benefit from being a little heavier, but the yeast choice took this interesting brew to an entirely new level."
"A really good Belgian stout.  A real nice mix between a stout and Belgian Strong Dark Ale."
""
""
""
""
"A Truly Great brew.  The plum and smokey tastes that are proclaimed are also delivered!"
"O: Different, but really quite good. I've had it before where the Belgian yeast stands out a bit more, but I think a little age mellows it out nicely."
"Mouthfeel is very nice.  Possibly a bit thinner than this beer's appearance leads on, which is probably a good thing.  This thing is INKY black."
""
"Overall- A real good stout.  Highly recommended."
""
""
"T: Has quite a bite.  Bitter, dark chocolate. Lots of herbal character.  Plums,  raisins and char. Needs some time to warm. Otherwise the fruit belgian yeast sweetness works perfectly with the bitter char. Pleasant aftertaste."
"Poured into the tulip. This isn't the prettiest stout... lots of floaters, darkest brown with a ring of mocha bubbles and a hint of lacing. Aromas of dark malt, delicious dark fruits (raisins, figs) and spicy yeast. Definitely opens up as the glass warms. Unique flavors (like all Boulevard I have tried), and wasn't expecting the Belgian influence. Had to do a double take at the bottle label. Roasty goodness, bitter chocolate notes, and a nice hint of smokiness. More chocolate/smokiness on the end of the taste. Dark fruits and spicy yeast emerged as the experience continued. Chewy mouthfeel, but not overly so. Definitely hearty. Nice lingering, with hints of the last sip carrying over to the next. Smokestack series is amazing."

"Wonderful beer.Beautiful color and pour.Dark fruit flavor really comes on strong mid-glass.Silky smooth feel and just nicely balanced overall."
"Was going to wait till 2016 to open this but decided to have it tonight. Not quite what I was hoping for. A bit too boozy and not a lot of flavor to  back it up. Definitely something off about it."
""
"Pours a heavy earthy black with a nice brown head.  Aroma is of fruity ester with alcohol and some coffee notes.  Nice bitter beginning with lots of earthy flavor and good mouthfeel...like a stout should have.  Alcohol is very noticeable with a bit of an astringent finish.  Good beer"
""
"O: A solid Imperial Stout. The only thing that could make it better is if the hops were a bit more pronounced; the dark/malt notes are great"

"Not into this kind of stout......"

"Boulevard Dark Truth Stout -----4/5."
""
""
"This is one fine beer.  Yummy slightly cocoa-ish darkness, but crisp in the mouth, not syrupy - with a bracing stouty aftertaste.  This could be an everyday stout if I lived in KC, excellent pleasing specimen."
""
"Lots of ripe fruits in this, plum, raisins, pear, breadish malts, sweet toffee and a sharp espresso note, preventing the beer from being too sweet. Warm, coffeeish bitterness stays very long on the palate. Very smooth mouthfeel, more creamy than oily, great complexity. Fantastic balance, the beer goes from sweet to bitter to earthy, without letting one impression become too present. Even hints of smoke and alcohol, as the beer warms up, adding to the earthy, warm character."

"I was amazed at how good this stout was, best stout I've ever had"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a good stout that unfortunately just didn't speak to me on any great level. I felt it was a little thin, and though it has some great roast coffee chocolaty flavors, it just didn't have anything too complex or different about it. Glad to have tried it, it's a great beer, but just not worth seeking out again. There are better options on the shelf IMO."
""
""
"I didn't much like this one. It does't really taste like a stout."
""
""
"O: a rich, dark imperial stout that is a bit more bitter than average."
"This is not a complex beer, but this is a nice belgian stout. The belgian yeast is very light. The booze is fairly hidden. This is very easy to drink for a 9.7% abv beer."
""
"The belgian yeast should be replaced and it would be outstanding."
"O - A nicely done beer and for 9.7%, the ABV is deceptive and well hidden."
""
""
""
"This is a unique stout. Fits the bill of being a ""Belgian Stout"". Besides the faint aromas, this beer has alot going on. The craftsmanship is extremely impressive. Well done."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"Been a Boulevard fan for quite a while especially the unfiltered  wheat.  I enjoy exploring their various  offerings"
"As a stout fan I did not enjoy the level of hop flavor and I wasn't expecting it. This is a high quality drink but it's definitely an outlier in the stout world."
""
"Pours a deep impenetrable black with a nice light tan head that holds on quite well. Nice lacing left behind. The aroma is complex roasted notes, fruity, sweet, burnt, with earthy hops. The taste is equally robust, if not more-so. The body is lighter, but with nice oily slickness to it."
""
"Welcome to Ohio enjoyed this beer it's a solid drinkable stout for any stout guy out there"
"O: While I enjoy the dark fruit aspects that the yeast esters introduce, this is on the hop-forward side for me, as many of Boulevard's offerings have been. That unfortunately means that I inevitably miss out on much of the flavor that underlies those hops. While this was drinkable to me, the hop presence ensures that I will not repeat this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Rich and complex flavor of coffee, toffee, leather, smoke, very faint Belgian yeasty note, dark ripe fruits, ashy charred bark and licorice.  Lots of interesting flavors swirling around. Rich and full and creamy mouth feel. Really nice beer."
""
""
""
"Wonderful Stout!  Very smooth surprising flavors.  I enjoyed this very much."
"Great stout. I enjoyed this one immensely. My first Boulevard."
""
""
""
""
"Nose is a mix of roastiness and belgian yeast. Thick smooth body that readily carbonates fine bubbles in the mouth. Flavor is dominated by belgian yeasts with an enjoyable maltiness that is sweet but not cloying. Alcohol is expertly cloaked. Slightly astringent hops nicely round out the finish. Only the absence of a greater roastiness or the advertised ""smokiness"" on the palate keeps this very enjoyable ale from a higher rating, as it is very distinctive and otherwise nicely balanced."
""
"This is a not your normal stout.  Brewed with belgian yeast, it doesn't have the typical roasted notes that usually accompanies an imperial stout.  It is extremely well carbonated.  With a swirl of the glass, a 1 1/2 finger head was created.  The 9.5% is not noticed at all.  Overall a decent outing."
""
""
""
""
"Great chocolate flavor that is smooth to the palate. Very flavorful with a touch of sweet"
""
""
""
""

"This beer should probably command a much higher price than it does as it far outclasses many special release stouts which sell for 4 times as much. I can't help but think it would have a higher rating if it were bottled as such, but I'm certainly happy Boulevard offers Dark Truth as a reasonably priced 12oz 4-pack."
""
"M: Full bodied, high carbonation, lacing is sticks to the glass, alcohol warmness. An interesting take using a Belgian yeast in an American style hybrid stout. A lot going on & Belgian esters are too hot but overall a good ale. Does a good job of balancing the various characteristics & all are restrained but the esters."
""
""
""
"Too much boozy afterbreath.  Nice mouth feel though."
""
""
"Poured a clear very dark brown, one finger thick dense light brown colored head, spray of delicate lace. Smell: molasses, big on the roast, also big on plummy fruit, with a mild smokey note. Taste: plum and dried fig, french roast, mild earth and graininess with just a little smoke, fairly clean balancing hop bitterness. Finishing sticky with a pop of burnt sugar. The hybrid of stout and BSDA doesn't always translate for me, but this one did pretty well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really nice body - big, but still dry enough to leave some lingering roast notes."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is one of the better surprises I've had recently. Plenty going on tastewise, decent alcohol content, but still very easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Not your normal double/imperial. I get almost no chocolate notes at all which is common in this category. It is instead a mix of quad/porter flavors with a nice dose of coffee flavor. I dig it. Definitely different and unique. Nice balance of flavors. Go for it if you have a chance."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice black motor oil color with a 3in tan/brownish head that lasts several minutes. Good lacing and carbonation. Can smell the burn figs, prunes and coffee. Tastes outstanding for imperial stout. I generally drink light american lagers and dopplebocks. The beer is great. Can taste minor hints of coffee and prunes and a chocolate aftertaste. Watch out the high AbV will sneak up quickly"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Lots of complexity to the flavors and aromas with well hidden alcohol makes this pretty darn enjoyable - though this is definitely a slow sipping beer best enjoyed on a cold afternoon/evening in the winter."

"Different than a regular imperial stout.  It's more like a ""Black Quad"" or a Belgian Stout or a regular Imperial Russian or American Stout that has been spiked with a little bit of prune juice and red wine.  Still, a nice, unique offering; but if you're looking for your strong dark chocolate and coffee notes--typical to stouts--you're probably better off looking elsewhere."
""
""
""
"Overall, the nose, once settled into the glass, came freakishly close to that of Chimay Red, but with a touch more sweetness.  Not surprisingly, the taste followed suit, but again, with a much richer and smokier finish.  We think the real “dark truth” here is that this is a starkly Belgian beer masquerading as an American imperial stout.  The yeast is just so characteristic of your hearty Belgian dubbels or strong dark ales.  Those fruity components are so pervasive that they even act to lighten up the malts rather significantly, despite all the soy sauce and smoke they can throw at it.  All of this makes for a surprising beer when you’re expecting something stouty.  They do, however, do a great job of describing the beer on the label, so you aren’t broadsided.  This review marks our last one completed in Missouri for this trip.  It’ll be a few weeks until we’re back in the state, and we’ll continue to look forward to trying many more unconventional beers such as this one."

"O - This was better than I expected. Very drinkable despite the high ABV."
""
""
"Boozy, with hints of figs and dates.  Sweet yet a little tartness in the aftertaste.  Im getting some kind of berry or plum flavors.  It's interesting to my palate.  I would drink this again!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not gonna say too much about this. I drank all 4 in the pack hoping it'd warm up to me, it didn't. Way, way, way too sweet. I don't find it very deep either, though as stated on the label it does finish with a slight smokey feel and flavor. To me, it hits me with so much VERY sweet raisin/black currant that I can't enjoy this. It's very sugary and rich and I feel like if I dropped a bit on my computer desk it'd be sticky within 20 minutes. Something about this beer is very viscous. It's incredibly rich like a good stout, but somehow doesn't taste like one. Anyway, just my opinion. I'm glad everyone else enjoyed it enough."

"Overall:  good imperial stout.  Balanced well....even though it's boozy."

"O: Solid imperial stout.  Sweet and sour fruit flavors"
""

"O. Very good. I’m going to cellar the rest of the 4 pack, I hope it keeps. One of the top IS I’ve had but then again RIS are my favorite style of beer. Very weak buzz for 9.7% ABV. The alcohol stays in the chest but in a good way.5"
"12 oz into a pint glass. Big, dark khaki head on black. The aromas were of some coffee, some chocolate, some caramel with the dominant being the chocolate. The taste delivered the same as the aroma, only the caramel/dried fruit was the dominant, with a nice roasty malt finish. Good stickiness at the back. Held the flavor. My personal preference is for stouts with less sweet, more coffee bitter; I love coffee, not chocolate. However, the Belgian yeast on an English stout profile yielded a very nice drink. A sipper for a lightweight like me."

"Two plus fingers worth of late to develop ultra rich ultra lush creamy inviting dark brown colored frothy goodness...  Some large chunky bubbles mixed within...  Rock star world class head retention...  Loads of carbonation cling tot he sides of the glass with some stray bubble rising randomly and quickly throughout...  The color is a flat opaque black...  Gobs of sticky lacing cling to the sides of the glass...  A big rich aroma or cocoa and lightly roasted coffee...  Some roasted malt is mixed in as well...   The flavors that materialize on the palate or spot on with the aromas...  Smooth...  Sophisticated...  There is a very refined charred character throughout...  World class Imperial Stout...  I love the beers that Boulevard turns out and this is no exception...  Actually, this may be one of their best..."

"Classic imperial stout flavors and aroma but with that Belgian yeast ""funk"" thing going on. Pretty tasty."

"In my short experience cellaring, this was the best experiment. I did not care too much for the fresh beer and left it in the back of my basement avoiding it. The beer was cellared for about 12 months, it was remarkable. One of the best beers I had in 2014. The Belgian yeast shows off, creating  a complex layer of flavors, quite a treat. The ratings for the older version is 4.75 and 3.9 fresh."

"Pours black as night with a nice head. Scents are roasted malt and a bit of chocolate. Somewhat burnt, which brings the score down. Taste is similar to smell but with a good deal of hops. Not excessive but more than I'd like. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel yet more carbonated than most in the style. A solid imperial stout."

"This is a delicious brew! Pours a blacker then black color with a nice thick tan head. Lots of lacing left on the glass after sipping. Couldn't ask for a nicer looking beer. The smell is also very good with a lovely smell of roasted malts. This beer is very complex on the flavor for me it tastes similar to chocolate malts but they aren't listed in the description. I do pick the slight sweetness up with nice toasty malt finish. Leaves kind of a sweet dark after taste on the palate. Not to heavy but super complex on the flavor and a really neat bottle to boot. :) For sure will buy this one again!"

"This is an inky black beer with a beautiful creamy, foamy head. I didn't pick up a lot of aroma but the taste is phenomenal -- spicy throughout, with notes of sweet dark fruits and coffee. Smoky with a dry finish. Easy to drink but the high ABV packs a punch. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"O - I loved the smell. The bitter finish was not for me. I think I would have preferred this beer with some age."
""
"Overall I think this is a unique experience with the spice bite on each sip. Other than that, I thought this was kinda ordinary. Maybe some age on this would change my mind. Not sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Interesting blend of flavours. The smokey/fruity notes make this one a little different from your typical RIS. A good beer but I think I prefer the stereotypical flavours."

"Serving type: bottle poured into a pint glass"
"I was a bit leery of trying a beer with over 15 ingredients in it. Wasn't sure if they'd get in the way of each other or become a complete mess, but this isn't the case at all. The resulting mix is a really excellent porter. I highly recommend trying this one."
""
""
""
""

"O- This was a damn good beer. The more you drank, the more you knew how much work was put into it. Aromas moved around, the flavors shifted delicately from sip to sip, and the mouthfeel was smooth and lightly viscous. I would have again in a heartbeat."

"Overall, a great stout with not much that is singularly outstanding. Just very pleasant to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a jet black with just about a 1-finger tan head that settles down just to the sides of the glass. Some light lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is of chocolate, roasted malt, hops with some spice. Taste was the same as the aroma with perfect carbonation with a coffee malty finish. Actually wasn't bad at all. Very nice balance overall."
""
""
"."
"Tan head that dissipated quickly, black color. Very sweet and dark fruity smell, as well as a sweet flavor with lots of coffee, chocolate, and rich fruit flavor--I feel like it was sweeter than most stouts I've had but not in an unpleasant way. High carbonation. Very nice and interesting beer."
"Another excellent beer from Boulevard's Smokestack Series.  Rich aroma and flavor.  Some notes that brought a smoky/peaty scotch to mind.  Perhaps a touch too bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with a foamy brown head. It dissipates quickly and leaves very little lacing. There's an aroma of chocolate and dark fruits along with smoky wood. Chocolate, coffee, plum and cherries come through in the taste. A nicely bitter aftertaste. The alcohol begins to come through as it warms. Medium mouth with nice carbonation. There's a lot going on here, but it all comes together nicely. I like this a lot."
""
""
"A nice flavorful stout. It is fairly complex, although leans towards the sweet side. This is a good beer for a cold night, it will do a nice job of warming you up. Very much worth a try, the Smokestack Series rarely disappoints, and this is a nice entry in the line."

"I had no expectations when I picked these up, but found an excellent beer! Plus it's widely available and pretty inexpensive."
""
"Dark as night with a quarter inch thick tawny brown head. Brussels lacing. The aroma is subtle but in it I detect a bit of fig and black licorice. The flavor is initially bitter with roasted barley and then you get a quick follow up of sweetness along the lines of plum and fig. The mouth is somewhat tongue prickling bitter from the barley and then you get a rush of warmth from the alcohol."

"O: This is a totally drinkable beer, surprisingly so for a 9.7% abv offering. This may be one of the most unique stouts available mixing smoked malts with Belgian yeast and German hops. The complexity of these ingredients together is unique, in a good way. This, like all of the other Boulevard Smokestack series, is a drinkable beer, and will definitely be in my rotation of regular beers."
""
""
""
"Overall - It is a pretty good American Imperial Stout."
""
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with carbonation of high intensity, resulting in a fizzy, then fully foamy mouthfeel. A bit overcarbonated for the style. Ethanol felt as a slight burn on the palate and back of throat, very little warmth in nostrils, though; ethanol fairly well integrated and hidden in beer. Closes dry, with heavy stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."
""
""
""
"Overall - A very fruity, jammy stout. Red wine lovers might like this a lot. Just enough coffee / roasted malt bitterness on the back end to keep itself close to the style. Maybe a beer I'd go to once or twice a year, though if I'm being honest, there are impys for less that I'd rather go with. Great beer, all the same."
""
""
"O: Very pleased with this one. Would love to try more. Recommended."

""
""
""

"O: This beer is quite drinkable because it hides any traces of alcohol. There is an interesting complexity between the roasted and smoked malts, Belgian yeast and spicy hops."

"This beer has a big feel to it at first and then eases up some toward the middle. The aftertaste lingers some with some but is not off-putting."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I’ll admit I shouldn’t have aged this one as long as it’s developing some cardboard like, fusel type notes. That aside it’s an amazing look imperial stout with a sweet, delicious nose. As for the taste I’d like to get more of the chocolate notes instead of the lingering hop bite and heat. Spot on mouthfeel for an aged imperial stout. Overall, it’s worth picking up a single for your mix six. Though where it’s at now I’d say drink this one fresh over aged. Much more enjoyable with some aged cheddar and raspberry bars I had in the kitchen."

"Overall:  I love the way this beer incorporates the Belgian yeast into a heavy stout.  This an outstanding brew, and very underrated in my opinion.  Well done Boulevard!"
"Poured a black body with one finger tan head that died quick with minor lace. Mostly a roasted, coffee malt aroma although the chocolate is pretty noticeable and hints of dark fruits (mostly figs). Taste is the same as a good balance between chocolate and roasted, coffee-esque malts come into play and there are some figs/toffee tastes that come through as well (other dark fruits that people notice like raisins/plums/black cherries I am not getting). Can't say anything spectacular about this beer but it's slightly sticky, smooth, fuller bodied and just really hit the spot for me and had a nice little sweetness in the aftertaste."
"beefy, viscous stout with belgian characteristics from boulevard. poured an impenetrable black with a light tan head into the pint glass. considerably clinging lacing on the sides. nose is the weakest part of this brew, though. definite notes of plum/prune, some candied apple, and hints of chocolate but not as potent as i would have hoped for a beer described as an amalgamation of roasted english malt, belgian yeast, and german hops. in fact, i barely got any roastiness until the beer was across the palate. as it goes down, i get fruitiness at the front, dark chocolate on the mid palate, and a bittersweet, roasted malt/coffee finish. the rich, filling, mouthfeel is probably the best aspect of the ale; a pleasingly robust, american stout profile to be sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Again, I can't really get behind Belgian style stouts. I'm not a big fan of the esters thrown into a nice roasty beer. With that said, Boulevard nailed the mouthfeel and this beer is much better than I expected. Worth a try I suppose."

"*-This is awesome stuff. Has a nice malty, coffee-ish/dark fruit flavor from the British malts, with a slight undertone of German hoppy spice. Not a huge fan of this when warm, so I'd recommend it cool. Awesome stuff."

"Overall (4.0): This is an interesting stout, that’s for sure. It’s quite good, but a bit of an oddball, what with the roasted malt character colliding with the estery Belgian yeast and subtle, spicy hops character. But, as mentioned above, it’s all blended surprisingly well. In the end, its strength lies in the subtlety of its layered character: it’s easy to miss some of what’s going on here if you don’t pay attention, because at first it just seems like an oddly fruity imperial stout, but eventually it all melds quite well. Recommended."

"o: Not my favorite Belgian stout, but this doesn't miss by much. Dark ir not, this stout is the truth."

"Dark Truth Stout pours a black color with a nice large lacing tan head. There is a weak roasted malt aroma with a sharp bite. The taste is boozy, and has a sharp malt flavoring. Rather easy to drink, and good full body. Overall its a good Imperial Stout."

"Very smooth and creamy. Nice imperial Stout with chocolate and roast."
""
""

"Overall the I really enjoyed three quarters of the drink. But as it warmed up, it just became a bit too boozy and the flavor just seemed to mellow out. I'd prefer drinking this just slightly chilled, not room temp. Very glad to try. It's definitely has some differences than other stouts in comparison. I liked the aroma of black licorice and the subtle flavor of dark fruits."

"O: Interesting ""Belgian-style"" American Double/Imperial Stout (if that makes sense). I prefer my stouts to be more roasty and chocolatey (i.e., less fruity) and more creamy than fizzy in feel. But. . . this one is well made and good, in a different kind of way."
""
"O-One of the few beers that pulls off the plums/belgian notes in a stout. Still not top notch but better than most."
""
""
""
""
""
"label reminds me of darth vader for some reason. dark, deep blood red, almost black. foamy at first, dies down to very thin layer, spotty lacing. smell of smoke, leather, raisin, malt. taste is the same, with a smoke that i've never tasted before, mature , malty, a gentleman's stout. mouth feel is a bit off, oddly a bit foamy, but still has good chewy backbone behind it and an impressive finish, dry just like the label said (didn't expect it to be so). quite solid, would try again"

"Pours jet black with a creamy one finger beige head that left a broken sheet of lace as it settled very slowly.Aromas are a mix of plum and raisin along with chocolate and some nuttiness.Flavors are roasted with alot of fruity tones,the raisin flavors are really magnified with a hint of char in the finish,the alcohol comes into play more as it warms.This is one of the fruitier impy stouts I have come across,it's not a big roasted dry earthy bomb,a nice change of pace for an American version of the style in my opinion."

"Overall: Haven't been disappointed by Boulevard yet. This is a nice imperial stout but a little too astringent. Fairly easy to drink. Good for cold nights. Balanced with lots of flavor but points off for my indigestion"

"A very unique take on a classic style. The Belgian yeast that is used in conjunction with the dark, roast malts, really kicks out a lot of sweet, juicy plum and fig characteristics, but the roasted malts really help balanced everything out. Really interesting stuff, but I am left wishing that there was a bit more of that classic stout roasted character in the back end of the beer. I'd definitely recommend this for some one who digs both stouts and Trappist style Belgian beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'd definitely drink again for the fullness of the experience. You won't be knocking these back, that's for sure. Drink when you want to nurse a lovely brew over conversation and a card game."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really interesting beer. The Belgian yeast gives it a unique quality that makes it stand apart from other big American stouts. A bit one dimensional in flavor, but solid nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"By the end, this was a very decent beer. It still didn't excite me so much as to make me effusive in my praise, but it had won me over by the end. I'm impressed that a beer that didn't start off looking or smelling particularly dark ended up being fully impressive on that score."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- the herbal hop notes add another dimension to the dry-roasty malt. The Belgian yeast also adds an interesting layer as well. Very complex and one I would gladly try again"

"Found in 4 pack at World Market for 8.99 on sale, I drank it out of Hangar 24 chalice, with all stouts, I hold them up to the light to get a true sensse of it's color..this one ..one word..Inky..So, I pour, nice head retention and lacing, medium carbonation...The nose is heavy, with molasses and malt making it a very nicce smell..so, the beer, roasty, dark, chocolately, malty, a very well rounded Imperial, not to crazy, not so everyday either.. stout, thick and nice, perfect for a dark night, or a chilly morning to get you going..would I buy it again..hmmm..I already did. Enjoy the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really quite enjoyed this. It isn't a pinnacle beer, but it is a masterful expression of the style. Boulevard really made this a pleasure to drink. This is probably one of the best stouts I have had, period, and I will most likely pick it up again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not crazy about this stout. The aftertaste is funky, the booze isn't masked well, and the mouthfeel is a little harsh for the style. The aroma was definitely the best part of this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really, really enjoyed this stout, and will certainly be getting it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice two finger head of dense, dark brown microfoam, even surface with minimal dimpling, retention is above average, leaves quite thick streaks of lacing behind as well. Obligatory pitch black liquid, opaque yet near the surface you can just make out a strong presence of bubble beads, little to no hue change to orange or yellow. Powerful nose of bitter dark chocolate, roasted coffee, caramel, flowers, licorice and plum to cherry fruit, there’s cereal grains and oats in there plus some pine sap and more leafy herbaceousness, has a good deal of discernible hops for the category and in no way overly sweet. Full-bodied, while generally creamy in texture it is on the dry side and can stiffen up on you. Again lots of chocolate, here the licorice to anise almost outmatches the coffee, molasses, caramel, certainly plays into enlivening the flowers and white citrus. Fewer grains but more pine and garden herb notes. At times smoky, does a great job of shifting on you so you can’t really peg it down. Takes awhile for you to more consistently register the plum, date, golden raisin, cherry fruit. Long lasting without being pushy, you taste it some time after you have swallowed. An achievement of complexity without excessive makeup."

"O: A very good imperial stout with lots of complexity. From the Belgian yeast to the roasted malts, there is just about anything you could want in a non-BBA imperial stout. Great value as well, at $10.99 for a 4-pack"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Nice finish without the bite of a dark roast coffee. I do not taste the smoky finish the brewer extoles on the bottle. It has a bit of that raisin/dark fruit finish I personally don't like from Belgian yeasts."
""
""
"Overall: A unique and very good imperial stout. Big roasted malt taste with a nice fruity kick from the Belgian yeast."
""
"O: This is an interesting American double stout, with the Belgian yeast and German hops; it works as something different, but it's not something I'd have the urge to have more than one of - it's definitely an interesting twist to this style, though; great mouthfeel and very smooth - 9.7% is hidden very well. (Best By Date: 5/18/14)"
""
"Pours very nice, dark and rich, huge brown tinged fluffy head with great retention. Smell is pretty mild, even as the beer got warmer, mostly chocolate and brown sugar. At first I felt this beer was way too sweet; it was kind of overwhelming at first. It is very sweet, but it does help the balance of some of the very potent flavors. Chocolate, molasses and apple up front, roasted malt, smoke, charred wood, and coffee at the end. No booze in the flavor but you can feel it in the warmth. Feels very thin considering the type; I would prefer a creamier, heavier stout. Overall, not too bad; huge flavor, a little too sweet,"
"Overall: This is a great tasting interpretation of this style. I love it, roasted coffee, chocolate and hazelnut. Brilliant!"
""
"This is a great non barrel-aged Imperial Stout! The dark fruit really helps add some complexity, but the high carbonation is a definite turn off. It's not so much to impact the beer too much, but a much lower carbonation and creamier mouthfeel would have been nice. Great beer to try though and pretty cheap!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer shows more of its belgian yeast complexity and drinkability when it is consumed on the warmer side, but didn't impress me to say the least."
"An interesting beer, but not one that will please every palate. I haven't had a double stout like this one before. It has a unique flavor (to me) and drinks very nicely. I would probably try this again someday."
""
""

""
""
"Well this pairs with the greats of the KC music scene. If you are into bebop get Charlie Parker's Quintet Jazz at Massey Hall. But if you swing Count Basie"
""
""
""
""
""
"This bottle had some age on it and the beer was quite smooth. Everything worked well together."
""
"Pours dark black with a thin ivory head that fades to a very slight ring. Dark malt, molasses, chocolate, and a fruity Belgian yeast. Nice, but nothing new. Taste is similar, more roasty malt, molasses, dark fruit, and cocoa. Mouthfeel is smooth, with a medium-full body and ample carbonation. Tasty stout, nice bitterness and roasted quality."
""
""
""
"This brew really benefits from a little warming, so I'd advise being patient until the temperature reaches the sweet spot. Once it does, the dark fruit and chocolate become more evident on the front end, offering some needed depth. The Belgian yeast becomes more noticeable as well. Overall, this is a nicely balanced stout with a very palatable consistency. Not remarkable, but very solid. I'd love to try it on tap."
""
""
"not a bad imperial stout, but a bit lighter tasting that i'd imagine DARK truth to be like. lots of subtle and sweet flavors. i'll have to get a fresh bottle to compare."
""
""
"O: I started off enjoying this beer, but the more it warmed the less I liked it. Not one I'll be buying again."
""
""
"I’m usually pretty impressed with Boulevard beers but this one was just okay for me; somewhat forgettable, with little to distinguish itself from others in a pretty wide field."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good beer. A slightly different take on an impy stout that brings some new, dark fruit flavors to the table. Definitely one to try, especially since it is always readily available."
""
""
"O: This is by no doubt a quality brew, allthough in my opinion it could gain some complexity with a little more sweetness. I believe it could benefit form aging and become even more interesting over the years."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good brew. well balanced , good aroma, I wouldnt guess this is a 9% ABV. leaves beautiful lacing on the glass as well. This will become a regular in my fridge."

"can be a very dangerous beer as the ABV is deceiving. great offering from boulevard."
""
""
""
"O- The mouthfeel and appearance on this beer are world class. Definitely much more along the lines of a belgian strong dark ale in flavor and aroma, but with the mouthfeel and appearance of a stout. It has a lot going for it, but the flavor profile is not really jiving with me enough to seek this out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice addition to Blvd's line up. The chocolate is strong initially with hops coming in and finishing it off. Belgian yeast leaves a strong after taste that's quite nice. Overall solid beer that comes in a 4 pack and priced to move. Nothing to complain about here."
""
"Overall a good stout. There are better ones but I can say I would not hesitate to try again."
"O: While I like the idea of a belgian stout, Dark Truth doesn't really do it for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"First product from Boulevard and didn't know what to expect. Complexity is finely tuned, as no one element overpowers another; malt and coffee are duly represented and know how to share the couch with licorice and hops. A dank, interesting stout I plan to buy again."
""
""
""
"Medium body, decent carbonation and slightly sticky on the lips."
""
"Overall: I am very happy I picked up this four pack at the grocery today. I'd been eyeing them every time I came in, and no one in my little town drinks the craft stuff, so there's dust all over that section. Stout fans should absolutely give this one a try. Very nice, warming winter beer."
"Overall: I think this is a really great Belgian stout. My comments seem negative, but its mostly nitpicking. I do think that a Belgian stout has to carefully balance bitterness, especially roasty flavors, or it doesn't taste right with the Belgian yeast and dark fruit. I think they overshoot that a little."
""
"Love this beer. Pours pitch black with a thick tan head made of lots of tiny bubbles. Lots of fruit in the nose, not much cocoa, but it comes on full in the front of the taste, with the fruit following."
""
""
""
"Good beer to try but not something I am going to be stocking up on."
""
""
""
""
"O: a very tasty imperial stout with good flavors and a surprising amount of hop flavor. High marks all around on this one."
""
"O: This is an interesting and damn tasty stout. I love the Belgian overtones and the fact that this brew doesn't try to hide its 9.7%. Let this warm a bit and its complexities really show."
"Poured from a bottle to a glass. Pours a beautiful black with a full creamy yet that retains carbonation. The smell left a little to be desired, but tasted of roasted malt and coffee. To me the mouthfeel was fantastic. First drink retained enough carbonation to leave me coming back and mellowed out after the subsequent drinks. Finished creamy and delicious. Overall a great Stout that is easily drinkable, especially on those cold fall nights."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a rich, complex, smooth, highly enjoyable stout. There are notes of dark fruit and licorice in addition to the huge roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate. I thoroughly enjoyed this offering, and I'll definitely be having it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Good stout, got it for a steal of a price and would definitely buy this again, if I can get it for the same price ;)"
""
""
""
""
"O – Good beer, glad I picked it up. I would definitely recommend it for the fall/winter season. I love the labeling by Boulevard here as well, it would have definitely caught my eye if I didnt already search out this beer. Cheers!"
""
""
"O: For me a poor example of an Imperial Stout, the beer simply was never interesting and left me wanting. Even at the low price point this is a pass."
"Mouthfeel for the beer was full bodied, dry, medium carbonation, a bit of boozy warmth, and very delicious. I was overall impressed with this beer. Got it from volunteering from the BBF last month and could of held it till 5/18/14. Of well, still a solid beer and can't wait for another."
"Overall with a little less roasted barley and some more body this beer would have been a knockout."
""
""
"Got this in a multi-small bottle gift pack. Usually not my style of beer, but I was pleasantly surprised. Poured well, nice dark coffe with cream colored head, good retention. Mounthfeel was comforting, without the bite or buzz some stouts leave. Initial taste was smooth, much more so than expected. Dark chocolate, espresso flavors were clean and clear but not overwhelming. Finished well with off flavors. Aroma was mild, maybe a little light, but nothing of concern. The glass down easy and was a little dissapointed when it was gone."
""
""
""
"O: After sampling other Boulevard offerings on trips to Chicago (Long Strange Tripel, Tank 7) this was a disappointment. Maybe some time would help the heat and allow some conditioning. Not great and many other better stouts out there."
""

""
""
"overall: The ""Belgian Stout"" is getting more and more appealing in my book."

"O - 4.0: more on the malty side than is ideal, but a great aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
"O – An excellent stout. I really like this beer... I recommend it if you enjoy Big Imp Stouts!!"
"O – A quality brew from Boulevard. Other reviews that say “I hate Belgian beers so I didn’t like this one” are missing the boat (and the point). I will seek this one out again."
"I like it."
""
""
""
"Overall: Very good example of the style and maybe my favorite beer of the “Smokestack Series” to date."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Belgian yeast provides a plum like fruitiness. with layers of espresso, roasted fig, reme brules, and spicy, herbal notes."
""
""
"Very nice Stout, would definitely recommend., and I will try more from this brewery."
"Overall I'm really happy I picked up a few bottles of this. The ABV is masked very well and the Belgian yeast makes this a tasty treat. Bravo."
""
""
""
"Dark Truth stout pours a solid black, with two fingers or so of khaki colored foam sitting atop the beer. Head retention is alright, an a respectable amount of lacing is left clinging to the glass. The nose is on the subtle side, but there are some solid aromas of chocolate and plums present. The flavor is starts off very nicely, calling back to what was present in the aroma. The front half of each sip tastes like plums and raisins covered in dark chocolate. A bit of roasty smoke comes in on the back end. It provides a nice contrast with what came before it, but the almost ashy quality cuts off the chocolate and esters a bit too early for my taste. Were there a style for Belgian stouts, his beer would probably be a textbook example. As is though, the mouthfeel has a bit too much of a Belgian lean t it. The body is a little too dried out and the carbonation a little too bubbly for a near 10% imperial stout. I really enjoyed Boulevard's Dark Truth, one of the finer examples I've had of trying to fuse together a stout and a Belgian ale."
""
""
""
""
"This is a solid brew with an interesting and unique flavor profile. Nothing earth shattering but certainly worth a try for fans of the style. Boulevard is two for two with me so far. I'm looking forward to trying more from them now that it's available in Georgia.  "
""

""
""
""

""

""
""
""

"O - Smooth and smokey for the style. Nice drinkability for 10%."
"M - Medium body, creamy. Light carbonation."
"This was nice. The Belgian yeast added a ripe dark fruitiness that paired up nicely with those rich American Stout notes of spicy hops, sticky sweetness and roast and the drinkability on this was top notch for the size. I’ve been overlooking this one!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Very complex and very tasty stout. Aroma lacks, but the flavor more than makes up for it. Rich and delicious!"
"Pours a pitch black with a thin brown head. Dark chocolate and coffee, sweet fig, alcohol. Initial flavor is of dark roasted coffee and then the Belgian yeast kicks in with some sweet fig and plum and a bit of funk. Finishes with a dark chocolate and smoky roasted malt finish. Body is full and silky smooth. Sweet finish with a bit of bitterness and alcohol burn. I really like the addition of the fruit to the stout. It adds another dimension and blends perfectly. Another excellent beer from the Smokestack series....which is one of the best series of beers in the US."
"Flavor: Cherries were noticed first but were quickly blown away by the incredible smokiness of the beer, as if it had been held over a fire! This was met with the roast malts and super thick and creamy mouthfeel, but I think I might have waited just a bit too long as I think the bitterness could've been balanced just a touch. I think it still fits just fine in this broad style, but maybe doesn't need to be cellared as much as I did."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A strong stout that just misses the high end for me."
"O-Definitely more of a RIS than American imperial stout. It's okay. Not terrible for the price."
""
""
"Review from 5/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark brown with an aggressive tan head, leaves moderate lacing. Aroma of malt and sour fruits. Light roasty malts and moderate dark fruits and malt. Dark fruit and malt middle with a mild hop finish. An unusual stout transition with more fruit than malt. Moderate body. Not as complex as some other stouts, but perhaps a more interesting flavor combination"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - First off, this is a decent stout. Nothing ground breaking or even overly memorable but solid. That said, it is too one dimensional at this price point to warrant a repeat performance. Would have liked to have more body and character to help it stand out amongst a very crowded category."
"Thanks Bruce! Pours black with a small, light-brown head that takes some time to go down. Scent has some smoke to it with a bit of burnt malt and lots of milk chocolate. Chocolate helps balance the bunt malt...making it not overly bittering. Subtle vanilla with a hoppy finish. Taste is almost like it smells, but a bit hoppier and more bitter than expected. Not a citrusy bitter though (like the imperial stout from Victory), which is very off-putting for me. This one works well with the hoppy bitterness. A lot more dark fruit flavors than the nose implied. Drinkability is high. Mouthfeel is dry for an imperial stout. Overall, this is definitely different for the style, but it's great!"
""
"While I wouldn't put this up there with the IRS royalty out there (KBS, CBS, black note, abyss, etc.), this is still a pretty tasty, well made beer by Boulevard."
""
"An enjoyable enough Imperial Stout, nothing too spectacular but still pleasant."
"O - Found this one on a recent beer run to State Line Liquors in MD. Not a brewer I am used to having access to, so I picked up a few of their offerings. This one was toasty and bitter, which I enjoyed. Improved considerably as it warmed and new flavors joined the party. I really enjoyed it and will get it again."
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark ruby-brown to black coloring with a thick, frothy, dense, tall, light brown colored head. The head retention is ridiculous...looks very tasty. Aromas of oak and char, with a subtle smokiness. Smells rich. Flavors are chocolate and apple sweet, with an oaky and earthy presence that keeps it balanced and avoids the cloying feels. Dark, roasted coffee is consistent throughout the palate. Rich, slick feel in the mouth with a slight smoke and nut aftertaste. The finish is crisp and bitter, with some of the coffee characteristics imparted for a while on the palate."
"o- a decent impy stout. Would try again at a bar on tap or if offerred but I feel there are some better options out there that are easy to find."
"D: This was an enjoyable sweet stout with elements of a quad. The scent and taste were nice, but the body was fairly weak. The alcohol was well hidden, and the finish was very mellow, so it was easy to drink. Curious how it would age, but nice fresh."
"O: Eh, not a huge fan. It's an okay sipper, but it just seems unbalanced and hard to drink. I'm glad to have tried it, but I wouldn't seek it out again, most likely."
""
""
"O - Overall this was nice, but far too sweet and booze heavy for me."
""
""
""
"Overall, Boulevard beers have shown up recently in my area for the first time, boy these guys are good... they are dam good."
""
"D - Very drinkable. The booze is extremely well hidden and the beer is excellently balanced. The yeast character is a nice addition."
""
"3.0 D: It's not bad, but the roasty astringency gets old fast."
""
""
""
"Overall - Bad bottle? No idea. It's not that off for me to think infection, but there's a lot of off flavors. Maybe they're just from the yeast. Maybe I'll have this again and change my mind."
""
""
"Moderate carbonation with a full but not syrupy body. Finishes a bit sweet, but that is to be expected, and it is delicious. A sipping beer to have with cheesecake for sure."

"a darn good stout, but this is my least favorite of the smokestack series beers so far. pours a heavy looking chocolate syrup color, with some shine and a smallish tan head. the smell is burn malt and oak, not a lot else really happening, some coffee back there somewhere. flavor is a bit more bold than the nose, plenty of earthy malt, sweet cocoa, and espresso beans. its big but not undrinkably big. mouthfeel is quite heavy, thick liquid without much carbonation makes it kind of a slow sipper. the alcohol is well hidden, but the buzz is not. to be fair to this it was not anywhere near my first beer of the day, but its not nearly as good as the other smokestack beers in my opinion. worth a try, but not before the sixth glass or double-wide, thats for sure."

"Not quite an easy drinker for an RIS, but on the easier side of the spectrum. Good solid, interesting and enjoyable."
"This is another one of those beers I can tell is a well made beer - but it's just not a beer that's made for me... and that's okay. I can live with that. I just don't think I'll be buying any more of it. I'd like to try some of their other beers though."

"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Poured a almost pitch black completely opaque with a light brown creamy head. 2 finger head lasted around 10 minutes, before leaving a thin layer that clung extremely well to the sides. Aroma at times was a sugary sweet lactose sugar, a creamy milk chocolate, and a smokey smell as well. Taste started off a burnt bitter, and changed to a slightly sticky sweet, akin to a thick barleywine. Felt dead on. Coated very well with just a touch of carbonation. Pretty much how I look for a stout to feel. Over all, a good beer. Flavor was a bit off compared to the rest of it, that kept it down a smidge."

"think I let this one mellow but it is still a delicious stout"
"I'm a huge Stout fan and I was eagerly awaiting my Dark Truth Stout experience. The color and the head poured marvelously but the taste was lacking something. A great beer, but to be picky I think it was lacking that ""it"" factor so many other stouts have. I don't think it is terribly different from the Boulevard Stout, just a little higher malt content and, therefore alcohol content."
""
""
""
""
"A complex brew to be sure and one to peak your interest, but the bitterness overshadows the other flavors, pushing them down into the darker recesses. Get past that and it's a really well-crafted beer."
""
"Overall: very interesting beer. The aroma is particularly surprising. Overall a must try beer."
"After the absolutely breathtaking Rye on Rye from Boulevard I was eagerly awaiting trying something else to see if it was on the same level. The Dark Truth Stout is solid, but honestly it doesn’t blow me away. Seems a little unbalanced."
"O. I would love to see what a barrel treatment on this would come out like. This is one of the best imperial stouts I have had. It packs a lot of flavor (and ABV) while still retaining a relatively light mouthfeel. While I think a thicker mouthfeel would improve the beer, I have to say I'm impressed at how smoothly this drinks at 9.7% and with this much flavor. Every now and then, a beer reminds of how powerful simplicity can be, when the trappings of bourbon barrel this and brett-fermented that are shunned for just doing it the old-fashioned way. Dark Truth Stout is one of those beers for me. Thanks, Boulevard!"

"O: This was a one-and-done for me. The flavors at work here don't mesh very well. I find the burnt malt tastes and estery Belgian yeast to be at odds. The thick body makes this one a sipper, and it sits in the stomach like a rock. Might be good in or with a hearty stew."
""
""
""
"Overall one of the most inviting stouts out there, and a definate must on a cold winter night in front of a roaring fireplace."
""
"This is a great beer. Tons of complexity, tons of potential in the cellar."
""
""
""
""
"I am really impressed with this beer. The relationship between the rich roasted malts and generous Belgian yeasts works perfectly."
"Quite dry and light for the style even though mouthfeel is solid. Fairly unique, better as it warms."
""
""
"A nice stout, good from start to finish and relatively unique."
""
"This beer proves, ""Too much of anything is just enough."" Belgian yeast. Roasted Malts. German Hops. Its a lot of flavors. And it works. The 9.7% alcohol wasn't even a consideration until the last drop was gone. And I found a bottle at my local Packy for $2.08?!? I'm going back to clear that shelf."
"O: Unusual stout where the roasted malt isn't at the forefront. Lots of dark fruit and lots of smoke. No chocolate or coffee. It's not bad but I'm not a fan of smoked beers, and this is very smokey."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Nice stout, but at this price point I would not buy this again."
""
"O: a good imperial stout, overall. Nice and roasty with a great aroma."
"Boulevard's description mentions the Belgian yeasts, and the fruitiness they impart. I wouldn't have picked up on that myself, but I can start to taste the yeast in the finish."
""

"Poured from bottle into tulip. Pours a deep oil black with brown fizzy hesd. smells ofroasted malts and coffee. Taste is of sweet roasted coffee malts, well slightly sweet. A bit bitter mouthfeel, but likable in the style. I can compare it to the bitterness of a guinness (a beer everyone knows). Overall, nice Imperial stout..alcohol is well hidden and good flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very enjoyable stout. I don't like it quite as much as some of its barrel-aged brethren, but it is a strong entry to the field (and readily available here in Kansas City, thankfully)."
""
"This is an enjoyable stout"
""
""
""
""
"O: Can't say for sure (as I'm not a Brett expert) but this was funky for a stout. Definitely still drinkable though, and surprisingly I liked the way the flavors worked together."
""
"Otherwise, wow, maybe there really is something good about Missouri. I wish I could get ahold of more of this, but there's not much distribution on the East Coast. Darn."
""
"O- This beer is rich and yet soft. It has the right amount of roasted malts and yeasty/fruity character to balance a malty and bitter-dry finish."
"Overall really well done. Glad to see this guys in Mass."
"This is pretty decent. I would drink again."
"Overall, a bit disappointing,- but it's a Boulevard beer, so it was worth sampling."
""
""
""
"O: To be honest this stout was somewhat disappointing. For a double/imperial stout, its a bit too sweet without enough bitterness to balance it, and lacks body. However, enjoyed it's wonderfully dry finish."
""
"O-- Fresh I bet this is quite sweet and probably a bit undrinkable. This bottle is 6 months past expiration and it is very well balanced. Gives the feel of an shiraz barrel aged beer. Very well melded with time. Must get more of this"
""
""
""
"A different type of stout than I'm used to but it's good. At 9.7% I think I'll hold on to my last bottle for a year or so and see how it does."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Gives its dues to the style and leaps beyond. I haven't had this one fresh, but I feel as though the past year has treated it well. The yeast strain used really brings this one over the top thanks to the big spicy, fruity character, without tipping the scales too far towards the Belgian style. Bold, complex, and unique, I'll definitely be picking it up again, and soon."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Impressive. The combination of flavors in this beer is just awesome. Boulevard has done it again, but I’m not shocked by that. It’s like this beer has two personalities…The first is at the pour, when you first bring it out of the cellar or fridge or whatever. The second emerges as the beer warms and the head cools off. Let this guy warm up before you serve or consume it, and it is much better than if it is too cold. When, and not if, I drink another bottle, I’m gonna let the head settle completely out before I even touch it. With a close to 10% ABV, you knock back a gang of these and end up in jail in no time. Excellent beer, kudos to Boulevard."
"O: I think this is a pretty good beer, but I feel like a lot more could be done with it. Some of the stone fruit notes get lost in the intense chard nature of this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a pleasant beer. Not the best I've had from this category but not bad either, I definitely recommend giving it a try."
"O- If you're among the legions of strong ale fans, you will adore this brew. It might not make your top 5, but it'll certainly leave an impression! At a modest yet hefty 9.7% this is a beer to sip and savor for an entire evening... Enjoy!"

"Pours dark black, nice tan head. Dark chocolate, dark fruit, hoppy, malty aroma. Taste is about the same but not as bitter as I was expecting (+.5) with a nice bit of coffee for a very nice tasting treat. This is a solid stout I will most definitely drink again."
""
""
""
""

"O: This is a really solid RIS. Boulevard makes some delicious beers and this one doesn't disappoint at all. Can't wait to sample their RIS in the larger caged and corked bottle."
""
"Overall: This one was a bit of a disappointment. It is my least favorite from Boulevard and probably the only one I would not buy again. This is not a bad beer, but not on the same level as the others in the Smokestack series. I do not think the flavors jump as much here as some of their other beers. Those who like stouts, this is worth a try, but is not my cup of tea."
""
"Overall - There are some nice flavors here for sure, but the higher carb is a bit off-putting, and doesn't seem to match very well for the style. Probly worth a try, but I won't seek this one out again."
"Cheers!"
""
"O - Excellent belgian style stout, and with the hardly noticeable high alcohol presence potentially dangerous."
""
""
""
""
""

"The light smokiness is there on the palate as well, extremely dry stout here, one of the only dry double stouts I can think of. Quite well done frankly, and the fact I can score this for $10/4pk all the way in Oregon? Nice, very nice. This is probably the best Boulevard beer I've had. The alcohol is a little pronounced, but not really for just being a hair under 10%. Its just that the beer is so dry, that you can easily feel the alcohol, but it isn't the type that saddles you with it during the drinking experience."
"mmm. A wonderful brew, and a great value when bought in 4-packs. very flavorful, a slight bit boozy, but it stays well in the background to the plethora of flavors in this beer."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. Falls black with a mocha brown head. A nice 1 1/2"" head sits and mellows nicely. Sweet roast. Brown sugar, molasses. Awesome. Silky smooth. What a great beer. I love how they decided to go with the 12 oz. Great offering."
"Overall I like Dark Truth, and if you're looking for a big dry stout it is among the best I've had."
""
""
""
"Bottle poured into a chalice. Dark black with a light foamy head. Smells include sweet chocolate mousse, dark plums, and roasted malts. Taste is heavy on sweet chocolate and cocoa powder. This is very sweet, but surprisingly easy to drink. Overall, I enjoyed this one."
"Crap quality underscores this deceptive beer. AVOID."
""
""
""
"Overall: It's nice. No, really, it's nice. But, can I have the BIS instead??"
""
""
""
""
""
"This stout strikes a nice balance of smoothness and complexity. I must admit, the 9.7% ABV is quite deceptive."
"A fairly good beer for a cold night."

"Overall I think this is a winner. Much better than I was expecting."

""

"O- I really enjoyed this. While the nose was a bit weak, the flavor was interesting and enjoyable and the body was excellent. Another great beer from Boulevard that I wish was more easily accessible"

"Taste starts out with a roasted malt front, a dark fruit presence then works its way in, definitely picking up the plum vibe, lots of heat though, the flavors do its best to conceal the heat but it still comes through, finishes with an above normal dryness for an imperial stout."
""
"Thinner bodied than expected, slightly watered down with soft carbonation up front and a deeply roasted malt character that provides a lingering bitterness. Hints of burnt toast, oatmeal, dark chocolate and coffee bean. There's also some rye sweetness along with some subtle dark fruit notes. The ABV is well masked but this beer is a bit one- dimensional and boring."
"Well brewed and tasty, but lacking in the deepest darkest vigor. Gets a little deeper with warming as well."
""
""
"Quite a good impy stout. One of the better ones I've tried."
""
""
"O: Overall a delicious beer, although quite dangerous. With the alcohol hidden so well I can see myself easily drinking a few and getting way over my head."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is thin and thick at the same time, the alcohol thins out the front palate and the back half is a full bodied beer. Some roast comes through a good beer overall, mildly bitter, pretty sweet up front, I'd have it again if I had a small bottle of it and some proper glassware, otherwise probably not a repeat for me."
""
""
"The beer is a dark brown shade, nearing black. The head is an inch or so thick and absolutely plasters the glass with sticky lacing. The aroma offers roast, chocolates, smoke, dark fruits, alcohol. Smells pretty good. The flavor brings roast with some dark chocolates and hints of smoke. The body is oddly thick and thin, coating the palate and yet feeling a scoche watery at times. Interesting. Lingering aftertaste of charred malt, roast, chocolates. Overall, a decent stout. Worth a try."
"Not a straight forward stout with the Belgian yeast element. Not sure if it was totally successful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: very nice stout, and the 9.7% is hidden fairly well."
"O: A very good Stout to drink. I'm sure it will make it into my regular rotation."
"This beer isn't bad whatsoever. Perhaps it isn't superb, but it is indeed rather good. Heavy and dry with a pretty bitter aftertaste. Looks beautiful poured into a fancy glass!"
""
""
"I understand that adding Belgian yeast to non-Belgian crafts seems to be popular these days, but I haven't been impressed with these hybrids until Boulevard's Dark Truth. The anise flavor and active texture are a surprising compliment to this stout's rich coffee flavors. Well done."
""
""
""
"O Solid beer from Boulevard, A good sipper."
"Beautiful beer with nice tan bubbles. It finishes strange to me though. This beer confused the heck outta me from the first sip to the last. I do like it however it's just not what I expect an Imperial Stout to be."
""

"A decent effort, but even if this were available in NYC I can't see myself purchasing it when beers like FBS are still on the shelves."

"O: Very interesting and good. I did not think I would like the fruity undertones in this stout, but they work very nicely with the other ingredients."
"Pours with a four finger tan head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Black color, no highlights. Medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Molasses and chocolate nose and flavor is more molasses with chocolate, then a light burnt molasses aftertaste. Decent imp stout. $3.49 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma. Best by Jul 2013."
""
"M: The rich mouthfeel, smooth and sweet, goes down way too easily. A bold stout that could probably last another year or so."
""
""
""
""
"Overall (2): Pretty disappointing as the owner of Whip In hyped this beer to me and the first two bottles fresh weren't nearly as bad (iirc). Maybe it just doesn't age well (?) or my palatte is just off today. I'll re-visit this in a couple months with the last bottle and change my review if necessary."
"The aroma and appearance is really where this one shines and I really enjoyed the dark fruit aspect of this one. That being said I remember it being better. While not a ""bad"" brew the sweetness and mouthfeel are really too much to overlook. Too sweet with a thin mouthfeel that has way to much carbonation."
""
""
""
"O: Not bad, though it really isn't all that memorable."
""
""
"D/O: This dark and roasty imperial stout is derailed early by unruly acidity that depletes the best of its other qualities. Textures are also undermined by the presence of acidity, although the heavy viscosity shows potential. It is saved from being categorized as unappealing by the pure roasted qualities that linger favorably on the palate after acidity has run its course."
""
""
""
"Sweet glass bottle that says boulevard brewing. Pours black and similar to a Guinness. Super nice brown head and lacing. Smells like roasted malt and dark fruits. Tastes the same but with some sweetness. Dark fruits and lotsa roasted malt dominate with Belgian spices and yeast. The hint of smoke is just perfect. More than that makes me sick. The only thing wrong with this beer is the feel. Too thin. Tasty tho! Very drinkable."
"O: I was expecting a little more from this beer. It is a very solid Imperial Stout and I am not bashing it, but it just needs a little more work to be perfected. Other than that, it is a very good beer and I enjoyed it a lot."
""
"I would say this one is kind of middle of the road for the style. I have had much better and have had far worse. I wouldnt necessarily seek this one out but it was nice little treat on this warm, 65F Thanksgiving afternoon."
"Overall: A very impressive, complex stout from Boulevard Brewing Company located in Kansas City Missouri. Some may consider this a Belgian Stout, as it has many hallmarks of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Excellent drinkability for a nearly 10% abv beer. Dark Truth Stout has that unique way that the woody flavors balance out the bitter coffee that dominates the initial taste. Overall, a very smooth, complex imperial stout that is well worth a try, then another...and another."
""
"Think chocolate chips with coffee grounds. Lots of burnt malt flavor. The swallow is also bitter from notable hops. The alcohol is very much present, but is overshadowed by the powerful flavors. Rich body like one expects in this style."

"Overall, this was a tasty stout. With a little more body this could be an exceptional beer. Glad I picked this one up for sure."

"O-Overall I enjoyed this one. Nothing spectacular, but solid nonetheless. Solid drinkability and good flavor."
"Overall it is a good beer, very easy to drink as ABV is not over the top. Smell could be a bit more powerful but overall is a good beer that I am glad I tried."
"Overall- A very enjoyable stout. I like the fact that you can't taste the alcohol despite the high content(almost 10%)."
"A bit sour for my taste, but a good full-bodied stout. I would drink this again."
"Curious looking 12 oz bottle caught my eye and made the ride home with me. Pours a deep brown color bordering on black with a huge fluffy tan head that shows moderate retention and mad lace. Smells roasty, chocolatey and dark fruity. Slight caramel and licorice and hints of yeasty esters round out the aroma. Taste is roasty, fruity, and Belgian like. Lots of dark fruit, caramel, and chocolate mixed with a quad like fruity and yeasty Belgian character. Medium to thick body, moderate level of carbonation, sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. I normally don't enjoy ""Belgian Stouts"" but wow this one is very well done and very tasty. It seems to have just the right mix of stout and quad character to help me really enjoy it."
"Overall, this is good stout, and the dark fruit flavors revealed in later mouthfuls provide nice counterpoint to the initial coffee and tobacco ash bitterness. The mouthfeel is oddly light, given the strength of the flavors, and the ashy aftertaste can be a bit much, but this is still worth trying for stout-lovers."
"Pours as black as you would expect with a nice frothy head. the aroma is great, coffee is the most overwhelming scent but also has some chocolate in the mix. The taste is good, but one thing about higher alcoholic content stouts is that you normally dont get the alcohol bite but with this one it is very powerful. It is almost too strong and takes away from the other flavors of the beer. Mouthfeel is nice and full, not watery at all. Overall i think it could have been a better if they had a less pronounce alcohol presence."
"Pours jet black with a tan head. In the aroma, a dry coffee roast and a small sweetness. In the taste, a nice coffee roast and a sweet to dry small alcohol presence. A small bite and a medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, with a dry coffee like aftertaste. Nice stout, big coffee and hides the ABV well."
"Jet black with quite the tan foam head on top-almost too much carbonation took 3 pours to get it into my imperial pint glass. Deep roasted/espresso aroma. Very india ink like. Strong roasted and grain flavors. Sulfury and yeasty tasting. Plums/dried fruit/black currants. Nice full and somewhat smooth mouthfeel-lingering acrid bite to it. enjoyable enough. Lacks the smoothness and finesse to make it a bit more enjoyable and drinkable."
"O: Goes down easy, tasty, somewhat filling, good kick that is ok blended, decent representation of style."
"12 oz bottle. Pours pitch black with fluffy tan head. Alcohol, caramel, toffee, with the belgian yeast aromas coming through in the background. Plum, alcohol, smokey malt are the predominant tastes. Smooth for a 9.7% beer, with a dry finish. Honestly not a fan of mixing Belgian Yeast with non-Belgian styles but this one is interesting and well balanced. Probably wouldn't do it again but worth a try."
"Overall - This is another outstanding example of what separates the Smokestack series from Boulevard’s other staple sessions and seasonals. Boulevard Dry Stout, for instance, is a fine stout - an equally fine stout to get in a six pack. Dark Truth, however, is like an upgrade worth spending time with. It’s characteristically dry, full, sharp. But the sweetness isn’t just a hint of sugar or cream, it’s an entire separate profile of ripe fruit, chocolate, and yeast. Dark Truth is a one-and-done sort of beer, a complex imperial to sip on."
"Overall it's a solid beer. Although I've strayed from bigger stouts in recent years, I am finding myself enjoying this beer quite a bit. The appearance is almost ideal to me. The flavor profile is basically what you would come to expect in a beer of this type, but it is just becoming common place. I love that for almost 10% ABV it's not boozey. I also think there is some fantastic subtlety that is lost on many palates. Solid, but it wouldn't show up on my best of list."
"Fantastic beer. Was the first i've tried from the Boulevard Brewary and i'm very impressed. Nice mocha finish to it and pours nearly black. Was extremely shocked by the alcohol content after first tasting the beer, certainly does not taste like a stout that contains 9.7% alcohol."
"Medium to thick mouthfeel with a touch of the alcohol present. Solid stout that would very likely do well with age."
"A little tough."
"O - A very nice stout. I wasn't sure how much I would enjoy this based on the smell, which had nice components, but seemed slightly off somehow. But the taste came together well, and having a bit of sweet chocolate, which I am normally not a big fan of, helped to counteract the heavy roasted character. I would have this again, but wouldn't stock up on it."
"Takes some time to balance out but when it does you get a pretty nice Belgian stout, interesting stuff. It will be cool to see how this ages in a year or two."
"Poured from bottle into snifter glass. Barley, wheat, rye and oats provide the foundation for this big stout. Layers of complex flavors slowly emerge from the glass: espresso, roasted fig, creme brulee. Belgian yeast provides a plum-like fruitiness, noble German hops reveal spicy, herbal notes, while the rich, velvety mouthfeel mellows to a dry, smoky finish. Such a robust beer stands well by itself, but also makes a wonderful end-note as a dessert itself."
"Overall: This beer is not bad but it is nothing special. Definitely worth a try however"
"O: Great stout from Boulevard. A little too much roasted barley getting through, but that could be because of the age on the bottle"
"O: Not a bad beer but nothing I would go out of my way to find."
"overall good. I would suggest trying this stout. I would suggest serving cold"
"O - Great looking beer, but the bitterness in the taste combined with the alcohol burn was a little overwhelming."
"O. A VERY nice beer. Another solid creation from Boulevard. Their ability to brew big beers and make them this interesting and available is quite an accomplishment. Quickly become one of my favorite breweries."
"Notes: This one is mean and ugly almost sinister what a monster and dam tasty. Cheers."
"A nice big stout but a bit too fruity for me, it is a nice flavor but would work much better toned down just a bit. Still worth trying for sure."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. This is a fairly bold stout and definitely delivers on all of the flavors. I'm liking the addition of the darker fruits and the shift to a more bitter kind of flavor compared to the overly sweet stouts that some breweries are churning out. I'd like to get a few more bottles of this to set down for a few months or years."
"O - Drinks more like a standard stout as opposed to an imperial. The thin body and overall smoothness go along way towards giving this impression. The excellent balance here is what makes this stout. Complex with lots of little nuances to the flavors. Really nice - for me, the overall impression of this beer is better than the individual components. Glad this one is now readily available on the MA shelves...will definitely get some repeat business on this one."
"12oz. bottle served in my Old Stock snifter. Best by 7/27/13 printed on the bottle neck. Pours the color of cola with a dense, two inch, khaki-colored head. Copious tiny bubbles adhere to the bowl of the glass as the head sizzle and pops and gradually recedes into a frothy cap. Thin swaths of lacing and cascading droplets adhere to the sides of the bowl during the tasting. Nose expresses dark malts, brown sugar, a trace of vanilla, a suggestion of oxidation and a slightly sour vinous/dark fruit character. Taste expresses coffee, ashy char, a slight metallic quality, burnt sugar and a suggestion of acidity towards the back - all of this on a roasty, dark malt backbone. Mouthfeel is medium-light (but closer to medium), with a carbonation that is just a bit too assertive for the style (actually a bit prickly) with some residual burn at the back of the throat. Overall, it's a pretty solid IS. I think it could use some time to perhaps diminish the carbonation and even out the body, but I think this beer has very good potential. It's very malty, without being a malt bomb, and it has a slightly different flavor profile (less sweet and more earthy/roasty) than many examples of the style. Definitely worth a try, but I would suggest giving it a year or two of cellaring to allow it to grow into its potential."
"One of my favorite stouts. While Imperial stouts aren't something I drink often, this is a real quality beer"
"O: All in all, this is a good beer. Solid. I could drink this many times, despite the over-carbonation of this brew. It's a good stout with a unique faint fruitiness from the Belgian yeast stain used. Good try for a stout if you have access."
"O - Huge fan of then head staying thick during the entire taste, loved the smokey aftertaste. Not a huge fan of the plummy raiseny taste as compared to other stouts I've had but would drink again"
"O: Found this on the shelf in San Diego of all places, really great find since Boulevard is not distributed here to my knowledge. (cost $3!!) I wish this was a regular off the shelf beer here, as it is a good stout, & well balanced."
"Another solid offering from Boulevard. The Belgian part of it adds an interesting characteristic, both good and bad. I will finish the rest of my 4 pack and probably move on to another stout. Definitely worth a try though."
"D: Not one of the better stouts that I've had. Flavors didn't work well together and overall it was somewhat harsh"
"O: Very well done and full of unique flavor mixtures. The carbonation and appearance are spot on. Was hoping for a more smoked malt character."
"D ~ A really fantastic take on the Imperial Stout...Honestly I am starting to like the semi-style of Belgian RIS to the style of Belgian IPA, the flavors really seem to cohere more fluidly. Seek out; this cellars very well."
"I've had a lot of stouts toated as Belgian stouts, but this one actually nails it. Very interesting/complex flavor profile. Creamy smooth body. I'm very impressed."
"This poured an impressive, pillowy, two-finger tan head. Head retention was decent with very good lacing. Nose big on coffee and smoke with a hint of molasses. Well, ladies and gentlemen, know I understand why they call it the ""smokestack series"". The smoke flavor is huge. WOW. Think BBQ cookout. Also the flavors follow the nose with dark fruits, smoke, coffee, molasses and bitter chocolate. The booze is hardly noticeable (thumbs up). The aftertaste tastes like eating a piece of chicken covered with char. But interestingly, not in a bad way as one might think. At first the mouthfeel is incredible - creamy and thick with just enough carbonation to keep the beer going; however, it turns a bit syrupy near the end. Overall, all I can say is it works. Very interesting how the smokiness helps to balance out its sweetness. I would recommend giving this a shot, especially on a chilly autumn/winter night"
"PS: I imagine Tom Waits drinking this one!"
"I appreciate the big char character."
"Poured dark black with a small tan head. Could see a lot of carbonation. Slight burnt chocolat and alcohol smell. Oak taste and also a slight bite of alcohol. Too much carbonation. Not a favorite but it seems to grow on you. Not a bad aftertaste. Not bad overall, still unsure if will buy more."
"Solid offering. Not my favorite RIS but I enjoyed it and was happy it was available in 12 oz singles. Drinking a 750 of a big stout is tough on weeknights!"
"Dark, dark dark. Just as expected from a 9.7% Descent tan head, I would like it a little darker but still looks pretty good. A lot of sweetness on the nose, plum, maybe dark cherries and phenol. Taste is exceptional, very layered. Smoked wood, coffee, not as sweet as I would have expected from the smell. I could sip on this all night. Wonderfully made beer. Definitely recommend this for stout lovers. One of the better beers I've tried in a while."
"Sometimes you pick up a bottle in the store and the shape fits in your hand so nicely, you can't put it down. Before you know it, the bottle is in your car and headed to your house and THEN, a few hours later, it's open and its contents are in a glass. Dark Truth comes in such a bottle, but the anticipation I felt while cooling down (but not too much) the beer was somewhat deflated once I actually removed the cap. The overwhelming flavor here is... sugar. Way, way, waaay too much sugar. It hides the smoke; it clobbers the hops; it makes the teeth ache as if you've eaten too much fudge. Reduce the sugar in this beer and you'd have a decent, smokey stout. Otherwise, it's just a boozy, sugary beer. Not bad, but bring your toothbrush."
"overall a really good stout. with so many worthy competitors in the style that line the shelves, it's not one i'll be bending over backward to try again. but i'd certainly be up for it."
"Not sure what to make of this one. I like the shape of the bottle for starters. I like the color and the head that forms from an average pour. I like the fact that hop bite is minimal. The rest is a bit confusing to me. I think I taste molasses, maybe caramel, certainly some nondescript sweetness, but it doesn't create an identity. It doesn't have a uniqueness which makes it stand out from the rest."
"Fruity flavors compliment roast and chocolate flavors. A real well put together Belgian stout. No flaws but nothing that is really wowing me. Definitely worth your time."
"A really solid, tasty imperial stout. Nothing about it is average, nothing outstanding, but really good all around."
"Overall i really enjoyed this. I usually smell the underside of the cap when I crack a new beer and I did with this one and all I could smell was wheat and Belgian yeast. I am so glad none of that was in this brew. My first Boulevard taste and thanks to davesway10 for the chance to enjoy this. A must try if you can!!"
"Received this as an extra from sweetwillyrolbar. Poured from a bottle into a 5 oz. snifter. Pours opaque with neary a head. Smoke, bourbon, and vanilla rip your nose up. It's beautiful. The the taste is also dominated by smoke and bourbon with some tart cherry tossed in. The mouthfeel is a bit astringent, but otherwise this goes down without a hitch. Would gladly drink again."
"Mildly carbonated, and oily in the middle. The palate is left dry and ready for some more of this sweet treat."
"This is a medium to full bodied brew with a lively level of carbonation. The alcohol hits with a warmth that seems even more than the listed 9.7%. Overall a complex and enjoyable brew but possibly needs some time to mellow out and really come together. Each of the flavors seemed individualized and didnt quite meld together that well. I like bold flavored brews but this one was a little rough around the edges."
"Now for the best part. The taste is astounding. Better than I expected from the smell, even. As anyone who’s read most of my ratings knows, I’m not a fan of hops. I think that in many beers, they’re overused. Now, the hops in this beer hit first. They play a noticeable role and they are definitely astringent, however they are present in jus the right amount. It is the perfect mix of hops, malt, and sweetness. It provides some astringency that allows the beer to be thick and dark without becoming cloyingly sweet. These are hops used right. As for the rest of it, it’s thick, malty and sweet just like a stout should be. It’s a bit thicker, stickier and sweeter than many stouts, almost like a cream stout, but it’s also pretty high in alcohol for a stout, so that’s not surprising. Man, what a great beer. I always thought that a stout high in alcohol would be a good idea. I was right. This stuff is absolutely delicious. Plus, I can’t even taste the high alcohol content. I almost find that disappointing, but this brew tastes so good, I can’t complain. Good job, Boulevard. You are a good brewing company, even if your irish reds aren’t quite up to par."
"O-one of the best that I have had from Boulevard and I will be getting more this to keep around because aging in the fridge didn't hurt this one bit"
"O: The booziness is evident but not overpowering. There is a great smoothness to it, similar to an oatmeal stout. Very nice sipping stout. I would recommend people seek it out to try it."
"Good meld of aromas and flavors though the roasted and hop flavors are a little high so it may benefit from some aging. I think my expectations were a little high so I didn’t really enjoy this as much as I thought I would. It was certainly a nice dark accompaniment to Johnny Mnemonic."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass long-neck bottle, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
"It's still an okay beer, but Boulevard has been nothing but awesome in their smokestack series thus far. This one doesn't quite measure up."
"Interesting beer, and my first from this brewery- really nice truth be told. Exactly what I expect the style to be. Lots of roast and dark chocolate, relatively dry, no hops to mention. Despite what my review numbers may say, definitely B+/A-/"
"Overall: a decent beer, but I like my big stouts to be more complex and less dry -- this beer really seemed like it was overattenuated."
"Pours a rich, opaque sable with a very thick and rather persistent yellowish-tan head. Nose-filling aroma has tones of chocolate, quality coffee, fresh-cut wood and molasses along with hints of caramel and licorice. Fabulous flavor is rather sweet but not cloying, like mocha made from excellent coffee and fine chocolate. A woody overtone provides a little hoppy bitterness to offset the sweet flavor, and hints of caramel, molasses and licorice round out the lip-smacking flavor. Texture has substantial body and a fair amount of tingle, Finish is fizzy and has chocolate and woody tones. Recommended!"
"Over all I give it a 3.75... I want to unmask this beer and see what it is hiding. Until then, I just cannot go any higher..."
"This stout was my dessert tonight and I would love it to be my dessert again. This fall I have a date to sit and sip one out on the deck in a crisp, clear night."
"O: Dangerously drinkable for the alcohol content, relatively inexpensive and always available. A go-to imperial stout. Well done, Boulevard."
"I was on the fence for a long time with this one. I could tell is wasn't a bad beer, so I let a couple age for nearly a year and they smoothed out pretty well. Plan on storing it and drink it fairly warm."
"Overall: I am really a fan of Belgian Imperial Stouts (need that added as a style), and I seem to enjoy them more than most since I always have big positive rDevs on these. Loads of flavor, but not quite as heavy as a standard RIS."
"O: Decent brew, but left me hanging. Will probably pass on next time I see it."
"O - Fantastic nose on this beer and some great complexity. I really need to try this again when the temperature is below 90 degrees, but I was hardly going to turn this one down today. Always happy to have a Boulevard brew, and this was no exception."
"Overall, this was a pretty good stout. Pretty interesting and unique with the full body and high carbonation. The aromas were ok but the flavor was better. The characteristics do seem to be a bit delicate, hence the best by date on a stout with an ABV nearing 10%. I'd like to see this one fresh and compare."
"Mouthfeel is thick and heavy, as you would expect for the style. Overall, this is a nice solid imperial stout."
"Pretty tasty treat, I can taste the Belgian influence in this beer, has a lot more dark fruit and Caramel compared to say Old Rasputin. Pours a dark brown with a nice head, head quickly fades but leaves a little lacing on the glass. Smells like dark fruit and caramel, light coffee and chocolate notes. Feels nice on the tongue, I could use a little more body, but that is my biggest gripe with most stouts out there. Long lasting finish, great dark fruit and caramel notes. No booziness, balanced beer. The finish is fantastic."
"O: Overall, I enjoyed this beer. It is not as good as the Imperial Stout from the Smokestack Series, but I like that it comes in 12oz bottles (I got a 4-pack). I'd recommend checking it out."
" Moment of truth...Would I willingly drink this again? Definitely. And recommend it."
"D: Drinkability is pretty high for the style and the characteristics.  The moderate alcohol level and somewhat thinner mouthfeel certainly help.  Overall, this is a good take on the style, however, it is a bit fruitier than I was expecting.  The dark fruit are really amped up, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just may not be for everyone.  I enjoyed it, but it's kind of a mid-range stout in my opinion.  "
"O- Really good beer, would love to lay one down."
"A nice, dense, big stout that does not go over teh top in any area. Inky black pour with a bit of sweet-ish malt in the nose. A little thick, leaning toward syrupy on the tongue. Deeply roasted malt is predominant, with some brown sugar and caramel in the background. Finish dries just a bit."
"O: Despite some of the things I mentioned describing smell and taste, this doesn't really taste like anything. However, since it was pleasant and wasn't particularly expensive, I would have this again if the opportunity presents itself."
"750 mL bottle shared at the July Santa Cruz tasting. Pours clear darkest brown with red highlights and a fluffy light brown head. Aroma is boozy with dark chocolate and some smokey molasses. A touch of dark fruits too. Flavor has notes of dark chocolate, acidic red fruits, mild prune, and black coffee. Also some chocolate cake and dark caramel as well as a bit of burnt, roasted character. Palate is soft and moussey for such a big stout. Pretty nice beer."
"Overall a very good beer to accent a cigar or smoked sausage, or just accent it with the other three bottles in the pack."
"dark as night with a small cap of tan that appeared right on the top, settling down slowly it leaves a touch of side lacing and a nice bit of foam around the edges. Ten minutes in the top is bare though and only some light lacing on the sides remains. Aroma is sweet, licorice and brown sugar, hints of chocolate coming together nicely, but missing that little bit of push to really throw it over the top for me. Smooth, creamy and full bodied it started to grow on me as the session wore on. Bitter, dark German chocolate, coffee, hints of something else, fruit, maybe but probably not. Hard to place but there is something else there providing another flavor of some sort that is hard to discern. Dry finish with a light alcohol warmth to it and last tastes of cookie dough and coffee."
"This is a unique, complex stout. Maybe almost too much going on here, but certainly worth investigating a few more times to make up my mind. I could see myself enjoying this a lot, especially in winter."
"Crazy powerful flavors mixed with dragster fuel. Sweet on the lips with a long bitter finish. More than a touch of the burnt malt taste. Slight sour, woodiness to go with the big malt. Raisiny sweetness, yeast, nose of toasted fruit bread. More astringent than most big stouts. Flavors just don't quit. Not just a sipping beer, but one that demands small sips. Aroma is more of alcohol than anything beery. smoke seems to creep in after some tasting."
"Overall-Average Imperial Stout. Much better ones out there. Probably won't ever go out of my way to revisit this beer."
"mouthfeel - thickens my saliva way too much, smooth going down and then bitterness lingers on the tongue unpleasantly"
"Overall I enjoyed, and loved the smoke in it. Bought a sixer and glad I did, I think I will age three of them and enjoy the others soon."
"Enjoy!"
"Pours dark rich black color. Have a very sweet and caramel aroma, with a medium and creamy head. Has an even more rich and flavor then Guinness without the heaviness. the ABV doesn't stick out right away takes awhile for it to creep up. This is one great stout!"
"O: Just above the ""middle-of-the-line"" stout beers. My first from Boulevard. Looking forward to seeing what else this microbrewery from Kansas City has to offer."
"Pours an opaque black with a 2 inch foamy beige head that fades to a small cap. Broken rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smells of dark fruits, dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and slight bittersweet chocolate. Taste is of dark roasted malt, roasted coffee, bitter cocoa nibs, and dark fruits. Slight roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip quickly fades. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a slightly bubbly and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good stout from Boulevard and I am glad I got to try this one."
"O - I like this one, I don't love it. It has some great flavor characteristics that I look for in a stout, but it was a little light on the pallete for me."
"Appearance is near black with two fingers of tan head to it. The smell has licorice, coffee and molasses. Not as impressive in the nose as some imperial stouts, but still pleasant. Taste has some more coffee, along with some roasted malts, ash, bitter chocolate. MF is medium-full. It was a nice beer to try while in Texas."
"slow poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Had about 1 finger of of dark tan foamy head that left beautiful lacing on the glass. Smells of cofffee, chocolate, and hints of vanilla come through. The taste is creamy and smooth, sweet chocolate and molasses with some bitterness on the back end as it moves down my throat. The carbonation level is good and mouthfeel is full. It's very easy to drink and hides the nearly 10% ABV very well."
"O: Overall this is a very unique Stout and I have been very impressed with it. The blend of American stout, with German hops and Belgian yeast is a very creative idea and the beer represents that."
"O- Classic. First stout I ever loved and still love it. I could drink this all night long."
"O- The nice flavor has smooth rich depth and is very easy to drink with some interesting fruity ester yeast character for support."
"Overall one of the better stouts ive had, a lot lighter in the mouthful which is a nice change for a stout"
"Velvety on the tongue, loaded with more chocolate, earthy/herbal hops, nutty dark malts. Moderate fruity alcohol bite well hidden in the rear. Complex and flavorful stout. More high quality brew from Boulevard."
"$10 a 4/pack, this is a great deal. I will likely be getting a few more packs when i see it, this beer hits a flavor aspect i dig."
"O - This is a bold and beefy beer, but ultimately not quite my cup of tea."
"Taste mellows out on the palate nicely as some of the alcohol and roast drop away to reveal a deeper chocolate and yeasty fruit flavor. Interesting combo and one of the better, if not the best Belgian stouts I have had. Yeast esters range from blackberry to strawberry to bubble gum. I admit I usually like the cleaner, sweeter stouts, but this one I find to be mighty tasty. I think the rye actually is pretty noticeable, but the oats not so much and they fail to deliver and ultra-creamy mouthfeel. This would make a very interesting candidate for aging, I will be sure to pick up a few for the cellar...if I can keep them from 'disappearing'."
"Overall, this beer has a lot going for it. It looks impressive and feels impressive. However, the nose and the taste are just above average. That being said, for its price, its a very solid beer."
"I'm rating this overall 4.5 as I consider it the type of beer that if I saw it at the store I would need extenuating circumstances (i.e. budget) not to at least get a bottle or two."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a nice light brown foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of roasted malt and light lactose notes. Taste is also an easily drinkable mix between some lightly dry roasted malt with some lactose notes and a black chocolate finish. Body is quite full with creamy texture and good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Not the most complex beer ftom this brewer but well brewed nonetheless with good complexity level."
"Overall: This is a tasty stout that is in a class all its own. Never really had a beer like this before. The plum was distracting to me and could have had less of that, but other than the plum its a well made beer."
"Overall: not bad/not great. If it was a local I would try it again. Good job hiding the abv"
"I was looking forward to trying this beer. I love a good stout, but am not a huge fan of Belgians. I am disappointed in this beer, but allot of that is personal preference."
"O- its an interesting take on the style. certainly more fruits than i would expect from a double stout. the alcohol could be a little better hidden. im curious to see how this one ages, but the bottle tells me its best before it gets to be a year old."
"D - Good drink; I love it; explosive Dark Lord flavors and texture; one of a kind; I'll have another"
"Overall- Nice stout by Boulevard! Part of the Smokestack Series, I enjoyed this one thoroughly. Could have another as well! Very strange attributes with the sour aroma and cherry taste. Will like to have again."
"D-Overall i loved this stout. Especially for the price. Would get this again. Maybe alittle on the lighter side of stouts but def. one to try."
"This is a great entry from Boulevard's Smokestack Series. A definite sipper with a pleasent warmth to remind you of what you're drinking. I drizzled a few teaspoons of this over a slice of chocolate cake that had gone a little dry, and it did wonders for it."
"Pours black with a huge, creamy, mocha head. Good retention and decent lacing. This one has a nose of bitter chocolate, roasted malt, and a touch of caramel malt. As I take a few sips I detect more chocolate, dark fruits, coffee, vanilla, and Belgian yeast. Full body and medium carbonation. Another great offering- I loved it."
"Reveal shows a Boulevard Beer, this one is Dark Truth Stout, actually clocks in at 9.7%. Whoa, this is good, and goes down easier than the ABV suggests, thanks pitasoup, this is a keeper."
"Overall: This was a great one! I loved the complexity of the aroma and flavor, the balance between the malt and hops, and the brewer's ability to create a >9% ABV brew where the beer dominates the alcohol profile and not the other way around. Excellent job, Boulevard!"
"M - Syrupy, thick and chewy. Mid-to-mild carbonation. Drying finish."
"Overall this is an incredibly solid Belgian-style imperial stout. It hits everything out of the park and is still familiar enough that it won't likely alienate those who aren't so familiar with or crazy about Belgian beers. The only negative is that its incredibly rich flavor, intense sweetness and high ABV rule out a second serving - make no mistake that this is a sipper! Boulevard has once again outdone itself with Dark Truth."
"A descent double stout. Could use a bit more complexity in the smell and flavor departments. Tasty nonetheless."
"12oz bottle poured into my bruery tulip. Pours dark black with a three finger head, good lacing and a head that stays. The aroma on this is crazy good. Malts, coffee and an Irish cream aroma, smells even better than it tastes. Taste is similar to the nose yet less dynamic. Not as complex as aroma, malts and coffee. A decent mouthfeel but not spectacular. Very good but not great."
"Overall, very untraditional take on an imperial stout but it seems to work out alright. I was wanting some more roasty flavors when I was drinking it."
"0: Started at 38 degrees finished at 55. Definitely a more refined taste/finish on the warmer side. Would drink again. Also would love to try this on Nitro!"
"O: This is a well integrated Belgian style imperial stout. I think I would prefer it with an American yeast, but for what it is, I think its pretty darn good."
"This is a drinkable beer. The ABV is well-covered. However, I think it was a bit too acidic and sour for a double stout."
"Very good beer overall."
"D- Strong carbonation. Oliy and mouth coating. A nice stout."
"Overall: This is a great beer. I'm glad to have received this smaller bottle to sample as I've had a 750 sitting in the closet for nearly a year now. I would think that with another year, the big burning alcohol will mellow a bit more; great nose, excellent flavors and a big filling mouthfeel, it's definitely worth drinking. If only Boulevard's beers were available to me on a regular basis. The only thing really slowing this down is the ABV."
"Overall- This isn't quite as good as I anticipated. I was hoping for a little more chocolaty tinge. This doesn't mean that i didn't enjoy it, however i think i was just a little more disappointed than i thought i would be."
"By far, the best Boulevard beer I have had. Glad they entered the Chicago market - looking forward to trying more of the Smokestack series."
"Overall- This is better than I anticipated. I thought the yeast would impart a bigger flavor that I may not have liked, but it didn't."
"This is not quite the beer that the Boulevard Impy Stout is but it's still tasty."
"Mouthfeel is full and creamy and delicious. Carbonation is more than adequate for a close to 10% beer, which I believe is absolutely necessary. Overall this is a big win for me. I love the unique flavors for the style. The Imperial stout category is so saturated nowadays with average run-of-the-mill flavored beers so when a stout is brewed that tastes great and is memorable it is an accomplishment; case in point."
"Opinion: Well, this is probably my least favorite out of this series of beers. I would take a Tank 7 over this any day. I mean, this is a tough style to make anything that really stands out, and this one really doesn't blend on my palate like I feel that it should. I guess that has to do with the roast being a bit high compared to the alcohol, so the residual mouthfeel is where it is lacking IMO. If you really love Imperial Stouts, by all means give this a shot as it may be YOUR beer. There are no fermentation flaws or anything, but the blend just isn't my cup of tea."
"D - I have to admit I'm having to get used to these stouts being brewed with Belgian yeast. It definitely adds a new and unexpected twist to the taste. I had the first one out of the four pack and decided I didn't like it, but kept trying them as time went by. Now on the last one I'm starting to appreciate the unique flavor they are bringing to the beer world. Its a style I will have to continue trying (and I look forward to it). Good flavor, body and aroma."
"Overall more solid beer from boulevard, great sipping beer and an even better stout"
"O - A solid beer, maybe this is just one of those styles that shouldn't be made or just isn't particularly enjoyable."
"Future outlook: Happy to have tried and not one I'd reject, but not available here, and not one to seek out."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a dark, inky opaque brown color. There was a finger of a dense, dark beige head on it. It lingered and left some lacing. Good aroma of mainly chocolate and roasted malts. Maybe some espresso too. The taste is very good. Only a little bit of sweetness to it. A nice blend of roast, chocolate and bitterness are the main flavors. I'm picking up some faint fruits, but they are hard to discern exactly what they are. Alcohol is well hidden. Touch of dryness to the finish. Nice."
"The mouthfeel is about average for the style, as is carbonation. Overall it was a decent beer, but not one of the better Imperial stouts in my opinion. It leaned a little too much on the sweet, sugary notes and didn't have enough roasty, bitter ones to support it. The finish was interesting with some of the fruity, spicy notes to it. It was an enjoyable beer overall but not an outstanding one of the style."
"This stout has a nice if somewhat jumbled complexity. Love the Belgian yeast element -- kind of like a quad crossed with an imperial stout. Glad it's now available in the 12 oz bottles, as the sweetness limits the drinkability somewhat (although the higher ABV is well-masked)."
"Drinkability: easy drinking to start, struggled to finish by the end of the bottle. Still very good and enjoyable - wouldn't want to drink more than one at a time."
"Medium body, not fully attenuated with tons of cocoa and a light carbonation."
"Overall decent, nice dark stout flavors, nothing crazy but a good tasting stout."
"OOOHHH SH%T! What an awesome STOUT! I love chocloate stouts that have a creamy smooth body...kinda like the way I like my women! But I digress....The color is dark...like dark chocolate, the head is tan and creamy which yield a nice lace. The aroma is a mix of sweet chocolate and booze! The high ABV detracts from teh mouthfeel, but it is a very good beer. No way to session this bad boy unless you want a huge hang-over. Try this beer with some chocolate, brownie or cookie....BOOOYA!"
"D: wouldn't go out of my way for another bottle, just not for me."
"The dark truth is that Dark Truth Stout is disappointing relative to expectations. That's what Boulevard gets for creating Imperial Stout, one of the best Imperial stouts in the Midwest. This is pretty good beer, but there are too many better choices for it to be a repeat purchase."
"Overall, I like the complexity and smell but the mouthfeel totally ruins this beer for me."
"Still not quite sure what to make of the Belgian Stout. This particular stout is quite sweet. It's sweeter than most imperial stouts, or Belgian ales. Boulevard has done an amazing job at hiding the alcohol of this brew. The 9.7% abv is almost nonexistent. This one dangerously drinkable brew. I am not sure I am fully on board with the Belgian Stout. Nonetheless Boulevard has crafted another tasty and highly drinkable brew. Another worthy addition to the Smokestack series."
"Pours black with a tan head. Looks almost oily. Bump for the nice looking bottle and for it being 12 oz's. Smells of roasted malts and a bit of dark fruit. The taste is similar, but the Belgian Yeast jumps in as well. Ends with some hops and a touch of smoke. Both the taste and the smell are decent, but unspectacular. The mouthfeel is pretty heavy and rich with aggressive carbonation (a burping beer - should be toned down, imho). In general, this beer is somewhat interesting, but nothing special."
"Well done Belgo-imperial stout. If the flavors could harmonize a bit more this one would be even better."
"Pretty darn drinkable that's for sure...the odd combination of the belgian yeast & roasted malts give this a unique, yet complex flavor."
"The CPJ"
"Glad I got two in my trade!"
"A high gravity stout fermented with Belgian yeast is an oddly tangled web which is often difficult to navigate. Unlike, say, a plain stout or Belgian ale, nothing about it is standard or straightforward. Kudos to Boulevard for transforming the elemental into the extraordinary, the simple into the sublime. And kudos to Sam for sending it my way! Much enjoyed."
"D- Very well bodied smoked stout. The Belgium yeast really brings out the fruitiness in this which im not sure i am to fond of. Overall its a good one to have ever now and then. Wouldn't drink more then one a year"
"M/D: Medium bodied with a slight alcohol burn. Pretty drinkable, love that it comes in the 12oz bottle, as a 750ml would be a tough task."
"M - tons of carbonation. Too much for my tastes. Otherwise, quite nice - creamy - thick and dry."
"D- good drinkability from the yeast makes for a velvet smmoth stout"
"m/d - Leaves a bit of a charcoalish smokey aftertaste. Very nice cooling tingle. This is a big beer though. I'm a fan of smoked beers and this one is fairly subtle in the smokiness. The roasted malts are pretty heavy. This is a beer to drink in front of a fire on a cold winters day. It's bold and beautiful and a MUST try for fans of big stouts."
"D= Quite an interesting and tasty beer...pretty drinkable too despite the huge ABV. I would buy this again, not as a staple but as a once-in-a-while treat. Very enjoyable."
"Big time flavors going on. Sweet, roasty, earthy, fruity, smokey, tart, spicy, etc. Another winner for the smockstack series. Not your everyday Imperial Stout."
"This beer is awesome. I didn't pick up much character from the belgian yeast, but so what? Awesome roasted malt character, nice hop presence, luscious mouthfeel, and VERY well hidden alcohol content make this beer fantastic in my opinion."
"Hefty body for this big stout, as expected. Light spritzy quality with a moderately-high carbonation presence. The yeast-y aspect comes through in the flavor, but not as strong as I thought it would, which is good. This then gets masked by a heavily roasted coffee flavor, and finishes bittersweet, with hints of fruit and toasted sugar. Decent stout, but I will echo some of the other reviewers and say that this really needs to be called a Belgian Stout. Thanks again, Derek!"
"DB - 1 is good."
"Full bodied, a bit sticky and syrupy, creamy softness, medium carbonation. This is definitely different, but pulled off pretty well. I like the addition of the dark fruit and Belgian yeast, and would definitely drink this again."
"D: I would rather have shared this with others. Not great. I think the I am disappointed in the yeast addition to this beer."
"This beer pours an opaque dark brown color. The head is an inch and a half of tan colored foam that recedes very slowly into a solid cap that sticks around. The aroma is very fruity with plums, lemons, and some earth. Roasted malt and chocolate balance things out. The taste is roastier than the aroma, but there is still a noticeable fruitiness. There is a sharp bitterness and alcohol kick in the finish that really distract from the rest of the beer. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with rather high carbonation for an imperial stout. Overall, this beer just doesn't do it for me. I can see how others might really like it, but I will most likely pass on drinking it again."
"Boulevard knows how to make a stout."
"Yet another masterpiece from Boulevard- one of the most under-rated breweries out there in my opinion, and they are bringing some creativity to the craft beer scene."
"Boulevard has done a very good job here."
"Like a black hole with no light escaping. Big fluffy light tan colored head. Good to fair amount of lace. This one needs to warm up a bit. Noticeable alcohol in the aroma, less when it gets warm (more burnt sugar than alcohol). Flavor also improves on warming. Again, alcohol predominates when cold, more roasted malt when warmer (the alcohol is still noticeable, though). Medium to heavy body and a bit high on the carbonation. Bittersweet chocolate finish."
"D- Not my favorite type of beer. Not big on Belgian yeasts, and smoky beers. Of course there are occasions. I may like this more in another setting and it could grow on you."
"Drinkability: Boulevard has knocked it out of the park with their version of a Belgian Stout; let's call a spade a spade - it is time to set up Belgian Stouts as a seperate category as this beer has little in common with American Double/Imperial Stouts"
"D: A bit thick for ordering another, but honestly, how many of these huge stouts should you drink in an evening?"
"D- Actually overall I find this beer to be quite odd. I love belgians and I love stouts-but belgian stouts-and for that matter-sour porters/stouts or weirder to my palate than the American Black Ale. Its fairly enjoyable and yes very drinkable-but weird-the fact that this is funky and not sour is certainly a benefit."
"I find this very drinkable, especially in a 12oz bottle."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than expected thanks to the Belgian yeast strain, but with a bit of elevated carbonation to make up for things. Quite nice, and ridiculously drinkable - the fruitiness goes a long ways towards hiding the alcohol."
"D: I was going to give this a 3, but I had just eaten some food, and might have been slightly full, so 3.5 it is. In any case, this is a very hearty brew, and drinks like a large piece of delicious, but dense chocolate cake. You want more, but it isn't always easy to finish all of it. I've had some 10% abv or higher brews that drink a little easier, but it isn't too bad."
" While it isn't the best stout, I have a special place in my heart for Boulevard beers, and this is one of their best efforts. I was not disappointed at all, and as long as you go into this with realistic expectations (above average stout, but not the best) you will enjoy this beer thoroughly."
"The flavor opens with a burst of roasty, bittersweet chocolate molasses and toffee flavors. Prune fruitiness. Well integrated flavors, blending seamlessly from start to finish. Heavy body, with strong, surging carbonation. I could do with a little less bubbles, but it's fine. It would be so soft and silky with a bit less carbonation. Mild hops. Lingering molasses aftertaste. Not a standard imperial stout, more like Hercule from Ellezelloise."
"Would be nice with some vanilla ice cream."
"The creaminess of this stout really entices you. You do notice the alcohol, and that is what holds you back. Really a wonderful beer for great sipping."
"Nicely drinkable but flavors are a bit sharp. Really loving this roasty stout. Cheers to Boulevard on putting it in 12oz. bottles!"
"D - Very drinkable, not overwhelming and pretty tasty, well done."
"D - unique to say the least. almost more of a robust Americanized Belgian Dark Strong than an Imp Stout. has its moments yet seems a bit misguided and confused at times."
"Drinkability: This is the first Smokestack Series beer I have had from Boulevard, and I am very impressed. The dark truth about this one is it is a very good imperial stout."
"D: Doesn't taste like its 9.7%. Its good, but I don't think the belgium yeast works that well in this, its a little odd."
"My biggest complaint with the beer is the mouthfeel which seems too thin for this style and ABV. Overall a fine imperial stout but there are better beers for the money. I'll cellar the remaining four beers and update this review if the beer changes very much over time."
"Very heady, dark and inviting. Ripe plum and faint phenols show the Belgian yeast off in the nose, even through the dark malt aromas. Insanely smooth and creamy, lush, full body. A bit of clean alcohol, tart plum, burnt sugar, taffy, grilled bread and a faint herbal hop are the more forward flavors in this complex brew. On the sweeter side, but there is a whole lot of char activity to keep things exciting from sip to sip. Too drinkable for the strength; an amazing beer."
"D - Different from your normal stout and I noticed the bottle mentions rye and a Belgian yeast. Not sure I would have been able to pick those out but they do create a noticeable difference."
"D- This beer was good don't get me wrong. The alcohol was a constant which limited the drinkability as a whole for me. ABV was high but you could taste it. A nice drinker from Boulevard."
"Atmosphere is great. Dark intimidating appearance. Great ruddy head, and a nice sticky beer ring. Nose is a great roasted malt with sweet and woody components. Flavor is hearty and robust. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"Has some real unique qualities for the style. As mentioned before, I'm just not sure how well they work together. I can't say that I would seek this one out again, but that's just me. Love that it does come in 12 oz. bottles though."
"D: Big fan of the smokestack series, but this one isn't quite up to snuff. The balance of hops and malt is off. It is still a decent brew and certainly drinkable (esp for ABV)."
"D - I really don't know how I feel about this beer. I feel like it had nice complexity, but the flavors didn't seem to mesh well for me. If the citrus flavors were toned down and the chocolates turned up this would be an awesome stout. Not that this was bad, but I think I'll grab something else from the smokestack series next time."
"D: Really nice. Holds a great heavy presence but I could definitely have more than a few."
"Bravo to boulevard for making smokestacks in the four-12oz format. I will surely buy far more of these beers in this format than in the 750 size."
"D -- Very nice, worth a repeat for any Impy fan."
"Very easy drinking."
"This is not a session beer. It is drinkable, yes, but I'll enjoy this one today and save one for another day. Great in late morning or after dinner."
"With the exception of the raisiny dark fruit elements, I didn't get the Belgian yeast character. And I definitely didn't find any German or other hops with all the bold roast."
"Still, good stuff, and well worth a try. Boulevard has produced one of its most fascinating if perplexing beers to complement its rich and rewarding Smokestack series."
"Overall this is an amazing imperial. Being my first one I am very surprised and pleased at how smooth and drinkable an imperial can be. All the way from the first pour to the last drink this beer was an amazing adventure. GREAT BEER BOULEVARD BREWING!!!!"
"Given the lighter body and rummy notes, I'd say there was a good amount of sugar that was added to this one. A nice complexity was the result."
"D - a bit too bitter for more than one glass."
"750 ml bottle, Batch 2010-1. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with a couple inch frothy tan head. Head retention is pretty good, with a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is dark fruit, roasted malt, molasses, chocolate and some smoke. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted and burnt/charred malt, dark chocolate, coffee, smoke, and a bit of milk chocolate and dark fruit. There's also a nice lingering bitter roasty finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit syrupy and coating, but also seems a bit thin as well. Good carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's certainly not hard to drink at all. I think this is a decent enough overall brew."
"Not a terrible beer at all but not a stout that I would crave to keep me warm.."
"D: not too shabby. I actually like this better than Boulevard's Double Wide IPA, a minority opinion it seems. There's something about Boulevard beers that remind me of homebrews. But that's not to say I didn't enjoy it."
"Drinkability: This beer presents itself visually as a huge beer, but when it comes to flavor, seems a little lacking in complexity and volume. Not bad, but not one of the best stouts I have ever had."
"This beer only shows a hint of the almost 10% ABV, and the creaminess just leaves you wanting more after every sip. If you are a malty guy, this beer is close to heaven. I originally bought a single bottle of this because of the flashy artwork on the bottle, and because I knew Boulevard as a brewery with the potential for some outstanding brews (and a few flops.) After 3 of these bad boys, I'm completely sold - this has taken the crown from Ten Fidy as my favorite Imperial Stout, and its one I'll be buying for as long as I can find it."
"Drink- Pretty good. I think I'm spoiled on the west coast though. It was a 12oz bottle. Ill have to try for the 750ML when I go back to visit KS."
"Pours pitch black, with a big tan head that doesn't want to go anywhere. Leaves big whisps of lacing on the glass as I drink. This beer looks about as close to perfect as it gets. Aroma is dark chocolate, a little smoky, fruity. Flavors are dark fruit, roasted malts, mocha, and touch of oak. Medium bodied, smooth smokey finish. Overall, a really pleasant, drinkable stout from Boulevard!"
"Drinkability is pretty good, a nice strong stout. That said, it''s nothing particularly special, regionally, that I'd buy it or age it again, especially for the cost of the upscale packaging. Good enough for the midwest I guess, but not standing up here..."
"Overall, tis tasty but not quite up to par with the others in the smokestack lineup. The aromas weren't in your face, and the flavor was going in too many directions. Probably wouldn't try this again as it is quite costly."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is a bit light with quite a bit of carbonation. It certainly isn't as smooth as a lot of other imperial stouts I've tried. However, leaning towards medium bodied really does make it very drinkable for the style. I could put down a few of these with no problem."
"Good drinkablility, medium body, slightly hot."
"Pretty easy to drink. I'll finish the bottle solo... Tasty enough to enjoy, and sippable enough to drink several glasses of. Pretty nice."
"Poured into a tulip. From notes. It is a pitch black with a nice mocha head. Minor retention and lacing. Strong roast coffee and chocolate characteristics. Surprisingly, a strong bitter hop smell was present, not surprising that it was there, just surprised about how strong it was. Taste was good, roastiness, sweet malts, a touch of dark fruit and that hop bitterness found in the nose. This is a mid to heavy mouthfeel but was thinner than expected, a little let down. Decent drinkability. I was a little let down on this one as I love most of the other smokestacks as it was just okay."
"Overall/notes - The Smokestack series have all been real treats so far, this one included. I'm glad I finally got to appreciate the imperial stouts of the world. It was a style I locked myself out of before, but once I realized that in spite of my hatred for coffee, it tastes delicious in beer. Good stuff, and definitely worth a taste or two."
"Big and delicious, i'd say this drinks dangerously smooth. I have a 4 pack, so i will probably hold on to one of the bottles to see what a few months does to this beer. Will buy again, and highly recommended for any lover of stouts."
"Notes: Really enjoyable stout. Great balance of malt and hops with a nice bitterness. The label says there is English malt, Belgian yeast, and German hops which mix well and are quite tasty. I would definitely recommend this beer."
"D: Overall my first beer from the smokestack series that didn't wow me. I have bottle in my cellar and hopefully some age will improve this one."
"Overall a pretty good imperial stout but not one of the best. Still probably worth a try if you love the style."
"Overall: Not sure about the finish, it's a bit of a kick, otherwise, very interesting."
"This is rather unique, kind of an odd confluence of bitterness, esters, sweetness, and smoke-- I enjoyed it."
"(D)- A good stout, but that peanut butter like creamy nut thing really throws off the flavor in my opinion."
"I would highly recommend this beer for pairings with deserts especially something sweet and chocolaty."
"Drinkability -- Interesting stuff, reminiscent of a lot of Belgian Export Stouts/RIS's: highly roasted malt, lots of fruity/spicy esters from the yeast. The malt bill is interesting: barley, wheat, rye, and oat. While the wheat isn't as apparent to me, but the mouthfeel from the oats and the spiciness from the rye is apaprent, and welcome additions. While not necessarily the beer I would reach for, I like this a lot, more than many of the Belgian RIS's that this most resembles."
"Picked up a small bottle from Princeton's for $3.25. Poured pitch black with a short tan head. There's a rich chocolate aroma with hints of rum and creme brulee.The flavor opens with chocolate liquor, cherries, toast and bitter baker's chocolate and citrus finish. I couldn't tell there was Belgian yeast at first, but the beer is fairly fruity for the style and has a little extra spice. It's appropriately thick and a great dessert beer. Check it out."
"D - Thankfully this bottle is shared three ways. This is an ok brew but doesn't stand up to the other beers I've had from the Smokestack series."
"I really like the carbonation and the feeling it gives the palate. Creamy and bubbly really make this a super drinkable, sippable beer."
"Pours near black with a thin tan head. Nose is roasty with black malts, rye and hops. Taste is dry with a bit if bitterness. Lacks complexity. Medium body over carbonated. Intersting stout, but not worth $10 a 750. I think this would be much better if they turned it into a coffee stout. Right now it lacks direction."
"D: Very nice beer. A little to sweet for my Imperial Stout taste, as I prefer the drier Russian Imperial Stouts, however, this is a very quality brew that I will by again."
"D - it's a tasty beer, but definitely needs to cool off. This was my first time trying the beer so, as always, I like to drink a bottle before aging one. Anymore that I receive will go into the cellar to sleep for a year or so before being enjoyed."
"Very easy to drink impy stout. ABV not apparent at all, at least in this bottle."
"D - Excellent. A great tasting stout and very drinkable. And just noticing that it is 9.7% ABV... never would have guessed by the smoothness."
"D: Not for me. A rare fail for Boulevard. This was such a huge miss that I wasn't even sure what they set out to achieve."
"B+ in the Imperial Stout category actually converts to about a D, so I think Im being generous."
"Even at just under 10%, this beer is very drinkable. Because it is a tad on the thin side, it is easier to drink quickly than some of the thicker beers of the style. Another fantastic beer in the Smokestack series from Boulevard!"
"D - Quite nice. I could drink this often. Boulevard is such a good brewery."
"SkÅL!"
"Medium plus bodied, sticky, chewy, and properly carbonated. Not as smooth or creamy as I would like, but a nice beer all the same."
"D. Extremely drinkable. This goes down very smooth and easy. Interesting Imperial Stout. There are some smells and flavors that you don't normally find in other Imperial Stouts."
"Pours very dark with a huge head that shrinks to a constant 1/4"" throughout the drinking. Smells kind of sour but with lots of coffee and chocolate like you'de expect in a big stout like this. Don't know if I necessarily care for the smell. The first sip is all dark chocolate (think bakers chocolate) with a bit of dark, dark coffee. Once the palate gets used to it a bit (and it warms a bit) more some of the sour notes poke through but in a good way, but still with a late light finish of dark chocolate. I don't know if it's the marketing but I can almost taste a dubble or quad trying to fight it's way out of the dense chocolate and coffee notes. Some might not like the slightly sour note but this is very interesting and very tasty. I don't taste a bit of alcohol but I can feel it. The mouthfeel is nice, not too light. I could drink this fast, too fast for the 9% alcohol."
"I have mixed feelings on this beer. For one, it's probably infected. But besides that, it's not bad!"
"Despite the thin(ner) mouthfeel, this beer drinks rather heavy. The abv is not detectable. The deep roast on this one is just way to much for me. It was easy to enjoy one glass, but a chore to finish a 750ml."
"I never knew that a Mariners fan would provide a ChiSox fan like me with so much joy. This brew pours a solid onyx topped by over a finger of burnt sienna foam. The nose comprises maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, toasted oats, chocolate powder, and what seems like a bit of figs. The taste follows pretty closely, with some late additions to the squad: bitter dark chocolate, burnt biscuits, coffee, rye spice, plums, and a dash of floral hops. The body is a very light heavy, with a light moderate carbonation and a somewhat dry feel and finish. Overall, this stout is all over the dark-beer map, but still manages to maintain its composure, allowing for an enjoyable drinking experience."
"taste is of milk chocolate, some sour malt, a little coffee, some roastiness in the back, and some dark fruits, ends a little dry and a touch of bitterness."
"Mouthfeel is pretty solid mid bodied and creamy. Goes down easy, no alcohol presence. Not as good as the other Imerial Stout I had from Boulevard, but still worth trying."
"M + D: Head was big, and body has a sparkling, assertive carbonation to go with it. Body is medium, quite smooth and slick with just a bit of hop bitterness left behind. Soft warming follows up, but it's almost like it's delayed... at least at first, and then it starts to pick up a little more as the glass goes on. An interesting brew, and one that I'd be happy to have another run-in with."
"I continue to be impressed by the Smokestack Series. If Boulevard were available in my area I would have it on hand at all times. Dark Truth isn't in the stratosphere of the elite RIS's, but it is damn close. This is a beer that flies under the radar, and IMHO, it is better than it's rating would suggest. Give this a try."
"Overall I found this to be a fairly complex and well done big stout. The yeast was a nice addition to a solid beer - be sure to give this one a shot."
"D: solid"
"Very, very good brew. Another winner in bomber form from Boulevard."
"D: I was expecting more from Boulevard on this beer. I didn't think it was bad, but sort of bland and uninteresting for a big, bad, imperial stout."
"D- I drank the whole bottle myself. It's better if you share this hefty one w/ a friend, as the abv shows up as it warms. Still was a very enjoyable beer."
"Mouthfeel ? Drinkability: The body of the beer is on the lighter side. The carbonation is light. This was a very easy to drink beer. No alcohol present in the smell, taste or mouth. Well done."
"Overall, I feel like this has potential, especially since it seems to hit many of the key elements in the guidelines, but needs work. Would certainly be willing to try it again next year to see if some of the kinks get worked out."
"Poured into a chalice a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus creamy tan head, with some big oil slicks and sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with lots of chocolate/toffee, some dark fruits. The taste is very nice, malty, chocolaty, nice touch of toffee, and some dark fruits. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a fine AD/IS."
"This is a great stout. If it weren't for the alcohol burn it would be stellar. Nice change up from the typical ""tastes like coffee and chocolate stouts"""
"Pours a black color. One inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of dark citrus, cork, slight hop, sweet malt, roasted malt, slight coffee, and slight alcohol. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation. There is a noticeable dryness. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, slight alcohol, slight hop, dark citrus, and cork. Overall, good appearance, great aroma, and good body."
"After wrestling the top off this pours deep brown/black and is dominated with a nice big brown head of nearly 2 inches that all but disintegrates and remains the whole way down. Nice dark fruit smell with a hint of roastiness that borders on ash. The dark fruit and roasted malts really come out in the taste, bit of marshmellow as well but it has a rather average mouthfeel and the ash flavor i detected in the smell just lingers a bit too much. Hides the alcohol well for a big stout but in a crowded class of stouts on the market I'm not sure I'll revisit"
"After another tremendous struggle with a Boulevard cork, I managed to prevail, and prepared to enjoy the spoils of my labor. Pours a very deep, dense black color, with a nice cocoa colored head. Aromas of espresso beans, cocoa powder and Skor bars. On the palate, I get rich, chocolate fudge, more freshly ground espresso, tobacco and dark brown sugar. Alcohol here is well-hidden, especially compared to some of the alcohol bomb imperial stouts being released these days. Another good one from the smokestack series."
"D: Yeah pretty good. ABV doesn't really show itself in this. Just not something I really want to drink all that much. I can see others liking this but doesn't do it for me."
"Thanks BlueOkie!"
"This beer was good, I'm working on the whole 750ml bottle myself and I don't really feel full or bloated after this much. I'm a little bit disappointed in the mouth feel of this beer, especially since they classify it as an imperial stout because its on the verge of too easy to drink. Nevertheless, it was enjoyable in the whole and I'm glad that I got the chance to give it a try but I doubt I will seek it out again. This really isn't my favorite style of beer but hell I'll never turn a beer down especially ones that I will never have a chance to try again. Drinkability is pretty high on this, nothing to complex and overpowering, and I feel like a wide variety of beer drinkers would enjoy giving this a try. So if you see it I'd say its worth the dollars and maybe a fair trade if you get a chance"
"D: Pretty good overall"
"A very enjoyable stout. Another hit from the Smokestack Series. Something I would recommend."
"Opening with a big bitterness, the burnt malt character has just a touch of acridity, lending a level of bitterness that I like. Hop bitterness is also present more German/Czech in persuasion. That's rather novel, but I'm not sure it quite comes together. There's also a solid cocoa bitterness. Burnt caramel and a little smoke are present, there's also a distinct spiciness - is there rye in there? Finishing a touch sweet with a distinct bitterness, this beer is medium-full in body and has a delicious, creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is a touch high as well, but the palate is excellent. This beer is interesting, unique and nuanced, but unfortunately, also disjointed. In any case, I'm very thankful for having had the chance to try this!"
"D: Interesting and enjoyable. Its balanced, but not real complex."
"I got this as an extra from mar, thanks very much for the opportunity. This stout pours out completely black with a hell of a large tan head show, almost three fingers worth. The smell is very spicy and earthy...bitter in places too. Roasted malt is what I mainly get from the taste, along with some bitter dark chocolate, and a slight metallic twang. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy. It certainly does not feel like a big beer when considering its strength. Drinkability is about average for me....not hating it, but not loving it either. Overall this is one of the more disappointing brews from the Smokestack Series that Boulevard makes IMO."
"Overall, I wish I bought another one to keep in the cellar."
"D- Overall I found this beer to be very enjoyable and drinkable. It is a bit young, but should age magnificently for another year or two."
"D: Its dryness and boldness of flavors makes this a sipper but it's definitely a beer you can drink slowly throughout a long evening"
"Sort of a letdown... Good but not really good as I was hoping..."
"D: Fantastic! No trace of ABV. Very nice, indeed."
"Drinkability? Setting aside the fact that this is 9.7%abv, this is by far the hardest to drink beer I've ever had from Boulevard. Now my decision is, finish drinking it or pour it down the drain."
"This is a good Imperial Stout that isn't too sweet, too roasty, or boozy at all. I'm not sure that it will improve with age, drink it when you like."
"Feel is about medium, perhaps a bit more porter/stout then Imperial girthed and heavy with thickness. Soft, smooth, dry, smokey, spicy, and subtle. Perhaps a notch more creamyness in malt would really boost this to a thicker, sinking, palate soaking experience. But as is, it's favorably easy to handle as its complex character and flavor tones make for a nice display of sweet, dry, and spicy. Another Smokestack series winner by Boulevard!"
"4/3.5/3.5/4/3.5"
"Very unique and well done, but somehow less than the sum of its parts. Something just isn't clicking or it's just slightly off. The hops, cloves and spices are perhaps a little overdone or maybe it's all too light and thin. So good, but off just by that much."
"Fresh, sweet & sour berries hit the front of the palate; again I'm getting a blackberry/raspberry combo. The middle is where Dark Truth falls apart slightly, as it tastes a bit thin and watery before giving in to a long, lingering finish of smoky malts and Baker's chocolate. Grainy with a big mineral presence. Mouthfeel is dry, bubbly, and of medium consistency. Not your typical Imperial Stout...more of a Quad/Impy Stout/Old Ale hybrid in my opinion. Another quality release from Boulevard, but not my favorite of the Smokestack series."
"I thought this was a very drinkable brew. Nice finish and refreshing."
"The high alcohol content didn't prevent something easy drinking. The bubbles were too big, too much. Worth the $8-9?"
"Mouthfeel was smooth and medium bodied, it seemed to thin out a bit as it sat. Adequately carbonated."
"Drinkability: A pretty good imperial stout, earthy and toasty, with just a nice amount of Belgian yeastiness. This wasn't a bad beer by any stretch, and perhaps the score doesn't do it justice. I just think it was a little dull in places, and had a few too many ""procedural"" faults to elevate it above the rest, particularly above the rest of what I've had from Boulevard, a very fine brewery with by and large excellent beers. This one could be sharpened up a little and could become a Belgian-ified version of their RIS, which was absolutely phenomenal. As it stands the, 9.7% was not too noticeable but I felt it after 60% of the bottle, so beware. Worth seeking out, though I don't know if it I'd grab it over, say, a Saison Brett or a BBQ."
"D. For what this beer was (a specialty stout with a Belgian yeast) it was quite good. It could have been maltier but that would have hidden the yeast character even more. It was well balanced enough that no one ingredient stood out above the rest and it was very easy to drink. I did not realize it was nearly 10% alcohol until I read the label on the empty bottle."
"Taste is slightly sweet with some nice chocolate flavors. There is also some fig and raisin-like fruitiness. The finish is of roasted, espresso-like malt and spicy rye. Mouthfeel is full, fairly smooth, and creamy. This is a very unique and enjoyable imperial stout. Another good effort from Boulevard in the Smokestack Series."
"Another winner from the Smokestack Series."
"Notes: I really enjoyed this one and found it to be very enjoyable. I was glad that they didn't overdo the roasted character in this one."
"M&D-Very full complex mouthfeel smooth and creamy. Far from somthing I could just pick up and drink any time but I am very glad its a standard Smokestack and I'll have access when I have the craving"
"drinkability: try one. it may be a tad expensive but it is definately a unique beer and worth the experience. and even if you dont like the flavor, with 25 oz of a 9.7 you wont be too disappointed."
"Overall, another solid beer from the smokestack series. A lot of good flavors blend together well to produce a quality beer. I am glad that this one is available in the area. I recommend it."
"All those non-traditional ingredients certainly make for an interesting take on the style, though I don't consider it a success. One glass was plenty for me. I liked the first imperial stout better, though I wasn't totally crazy about it either."
"Notes: Not a hoppy stout but close to some of those offerings. Lacks the think and creamy sense of others but offers a nice flavor and feel balance. A good, unfortunately not excellent, but very likable offering from the Smokestack series."
"Flavors of charred black malts, robust dark roast coffee, trace bitterness of bakers chocolate. Some green hops in there buried under the roast. Chocolate note becomes more noticeable as it warms. Medium bodied, a trace of alcohol, sort of astringent. I'll do my best to finish the 750, but it's probably best shared, and served on the warmer side of cool."
"D - Yeah."
"Overall, an interesting beer with lots going on. I didn't really care for the blend of everything though and there were some off notes."
"Overall this was a tasty stout. Nice complexity of flavors and the belgian yeast lends an interesting character."
"drinkability is bad - i will never drink this again and i think they should stop making it"
"Medium bodied, but very, very drinkable for a stout. This is good, and for $9, I'd buy again if I'm looking for a sessionable RIS. Everything is good, not great."
"It's not my absolute favorite of the Smokestack releases, but it's not my least favorite either. All of the Smokestacks are great though. For my palate, Boulevard is finally making some truly great beers. Please keep it up!"
"Very creamy with more carbonation than I was expecting - very smooth going down. Really, really enjoyed this beer - makes me sad that the weather is getting warmer and the heavier beers will be nothing but great memories...."
"This is a dark brown beer that has a big, thick rolling head off a slow pour. Retention is excellent. After it slowly breaks apart a thick web of sticky lace is left. Smells oddly tangy at first with an undercurrent of malts. A little shake opens things up a bit and some dark chocolates reveal themselves. Otherwise not a lot going on at the nose. Tastes sweet and malty up front and soon followed by a quick hop bite and some alcohol heat. There's also a bit of a sweet candy middle with a very faint woodiness. Goes down mostly creamy with a lingering alcohol heat in the back of the throat. Kind of a nondescript outing for Boulevard here, but you can't knock a home run every time at bat."
"D - medium to low carbonation. But it it is one of the more drinkable stouts that I have tried."
"Drinks fairly easy, nice stab at the style but didn't totally pull together for me. I preffer the original imp stout, all things considered"
"D-this is a pretty nice imperial stout. It is very sweet but still has some of the roasted character you like to see. Good body, not huge but a good feel to it."
"Great drinkability. While there is some alcohol presence in the nose, in the taste the alcohol is almost non-existent. Excellent beer."
"M & D - Very roasted character but still smooth and very creamy. Nice Co2 and nice full body. Very drinkable for the ABV and the flavor profile. A good gate to the ADS."
"Taste is also Belgian for a Stout. It's really crisp and smooth. Mouthfeel is very full and super easy to drink."
"Holds it own quite well, could probably use a fat sirloin steak and potatoes to really treat you right. Sign me up as a fan."
"D= What the hell? I'm pretty dissapointed. This is really a let down for the smokestack series. This was the most average tame stout I've ever tasted. A let down for sure."
"D: This is a nice beer that feels like it could stand some aging to balance it out. It's a very nice complement to a cold evening."
"Overall this was a nice Imperial Stout from Boulevard that may benefit from some age. I'll let the other one I have sit for a while and see how it does. I do wish that the carbonation was tones down a bit. Thanks again Dan!"
"Another exciting beer from Boulevard. This might be my favorite of the seasonal, non limited release, smokestacks. I can't wait to see what Boulevard does next!"
"Pours dark brown to black with a large tan head. The aroma is coffee, chocolate and roasted malt. The flavor is coffee, chocolate, roasted malt and dark fruit. There is some bitterness either from the hops or the malt. Creamy, soft thick mouthfeel and low to medium carbonation."
"The Smokestack series has been great so far. However this offering was underwhelming. This stout was average, when I was expecting a really full and rich flavor."
"Very mediocre, especially for the ridiculous price tag."
"750ml corked and caged bottle. Served in a Tank 7 tulip. Lots of carbonation, a little too much actually. Poured a deep black with a huge head of tan foam. Roasted barley/black patent in the aroma with some dark fruit and some hops. Big, full bodied and smooth. Roasty with lots of malt. More fruit. Complex maltiness. Long lingering finish of roasted/chocolate malt. Another winner in the Smokestack series."
"D - This is a pretty easy drinking imperial stout. It hides the high ABV very well and it quite delicious."
"A solid DIS that reminds me a little of their limited edition version - lots of the same attributes. The major knock I have against it, and also against the previous stout, is its abundance of carbonation - I'd like to see it dialed back a little."
"Overall I was not really impressed as I was expecting and definitely think there other RIS in the smokestack is way better then this one."
"Poured into a New Belgium chalice black with a very thick tan head. Great retention and lacing. The scent has strong oak notes and alcohol. The taste is very smooth with warming hop bitterness and sweet malted flavors. There is a little alcohol burn, but not bad for 9%."
"Drinkability: Because of the abv, not very drinkable. but what imperial stout is? I may just have to buy all of the smokestack series beers and try to age them for a year to see what happens."
"Poured a corked and caged 750 into my Boulevard Smokestack goblet. This beer pours a India ink black with a solid 3 inch dark beige head that leaves seriously sticky lacing down the sides of the glass. Good way to start out. The aroma is complex. Dark fruits lead off with dates, figs and plums melting into a over ripe red apple. Up next comes a subtle graininess, chocolate malts, and just a hint of espresso. Very little hop presence in the nose. The flavor is just as complex. Starting of with a base chocolate, following through with ripe apples, dates and figs, and just a subtle citrus hop at the very tail of the flavor profile. A faint roasted espresso coats the mouth with just a slight bitterness. The mouthfeel is light and creamy. I'm surprised at how light the mouthfeel is. Really great stuff. Overall all I think this is a great beer. Boulevard has been putting out some absolutely fantastic stuff as of late."
"Similar to what I wrote a few years ago, but it may have smoothed out some since - just velvety now. Every bit as enjoyable."
"Wish this had been released in December as I don't want winter to be over just yet. Must stop drinking to go buy more. PS. Capped a bottle w/about 3/4 glass left and relived the sensory magic the next day in the daylight."
"I had massive expectations for this beer, perhaps unfairly so. See, I LOVED last January's limited-release Imperial Stout from Boulevard. This is nearly the same beer; the major differences being that spelt is no long part of the multigrain grain bill and Imperial Stout had blended into it bourbon barrel aged version of the beer (Dark Truth contains no such bourbon barrel aging). I don't miss either aspect. Dark Truth absolutely meets my expectations. I bought ten bottles and I'm going to seek out more. People -- trade for this beer, I'm telling you! It isn't going to out-flavor the barrel-aged big'uns like Black Tuesday or Dark Lord but this is a refined, surprising, off-the-charts good imperial stout that deserves to be recognized and celebrated."
"750ml bottle $9 I will start off by saying I was let down by this beer but I can;t expect to love every single Boulevard beer. Dark black color as a stout should be with a head that was super foamy and actually delayed my drinking. The smell was weird, a little like a stout but not much, none of the promised aromas from the label. The taste was decent but average and again not really like a stout if you ask me more like a black strong ale."
"Mouthfeel is a little light for an Imperial Stout, but the complexity of flavors makes it an after thought. Carbonation is strong and keeps the flavors agitated. There are tons of layers here. It's easy enough to drink through, but slow down and really explore. Eye popping."
"Make that the 14th superb offering in the series. Guys, you're bating a 1000."
