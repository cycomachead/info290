"O:  If you're a fan of brandy-filled dark chocolates, you will probably enjoy this brew quite a bit. Seems like a beverage that would go well with the holidays. Buy one or two in the summer, and hope they age well for the winter."

"Great-looking dark pour with plenty of head.  Nose is sweet milk chocolate, taste is unsweetened cocoa, dark chocolate, coffee, and a hoppy, bitter finish.  Pretty darn good."
"Pours a  deep chocolate brown color not wanting to let any light through. Head is tan and a light chocolate milk color and is plentiful and bubbly. Lacing coats the glass thickly. First hit of aroma is of chocolate milk, milk chocolate and a hint of coffee. Taste is similar at first with a creamy milk chocolate flavor hitting and coating the tongue first, then comes some bittersweet chocolate to balance things out. There is a bittersweet chocolate finish as the flavor goes through the chocolate flavor wheel in just the first sip. Mouthfeel is nice, coats the tongue at first and then bites at it a little and finished pretty clean with just enough chocolate flavor left to make you want more. This is a great Chocolate stout !!"

"Color is an opaque dark brown with a one finger khaki head. Nice retention and lacing.  Aroma is cocoa, roasted malt, and some dark fruit.  Flavor is chocolate and oatmeal on the palate, followed by roasted malt and dark fruit.  Finish is refreshingly bitter - like bittersweet chocolate.  Body is medium-full with more carbonation than I expected.   Overall, a very enjoyable beer with the rich chocolate flavor balanced by the bitter hops."

"This is everything it should be dark rich and delicious smell of cocoa nibs and oatmeal taste like cocoa nibs leaves a bit of aftertaste of cocoa nibs if u have never had cocoa nibs you should try dark bitter sweet chocolate add peanut butter this would be the ultimate buckeye go (O-H-I-O) I hear repeat 3 qb woops different thread this is a must try chocolate stout im going to cellar next one to compare drank in a sniffer at 48' and raising"
"Ok stout. Not as much flavor as I would have liked. Not heavy enough."

"Overall I love this stout. It's been my go to the past couple weeks. I feel the chocolate on this is just right, not too sweet. Definitely worthy of it's rating."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A little goes a long way; good beer"
""
""
""
"Absolute chocolate bomb. Delicious but not something I want to drink often. Very similar to Southern Tier Chokolat in its utter lack of subtlety."
"Very nice! Not sweet and sugary tasting like milk chocolates. More like dark unsweetened bitter chocolate!"
"Chocolate lovers will surely go for this- it's excellent, perhaps world class, and probably the best choco beer out there."
""
""
"O - This beer was not as chocolaty as I expected. I have had it awhile, and it may have faded. It is still a good chocolate stout, but it is just lacking a wow factor for me."
""
""
"The bittersweet chocolate really comes through in the end"
"Maybe a bit oxidized. Not a lot of chocolate, coffee smell or taste. Medium feel. To avoid disappointment I added rum-based vanilla extract and coconut milk which brings it up to a 4.25."
""
""
""
"I can't believe how much I love this"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  though I like Rogue, I find most of their beers to be very similar and boring.  This beer is fantastic."
""
""
""
"smooth creamy mouth feel"
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a real review, just notes for self. Chocolate is subtle, especially after the ST Mokah. Very stout with a wee nip of chocolate. A very good beer. From growler bar in Anchorage. Would not pay the ceramic bottle price."

"Tap at Lazy Dog Macon. This beer was delicious! Pours dark black with tan head. Aroma of chocolate and roasted malts. Tastes of sweet chocolate, with hints of vanilla, coffee and malt. Itâ€™s like drinking chocolate cake. Very delicious."
""
""
"Not a fan of the stout, per se.. something about the heaviness of it. As a style it seems the most likely to like to me. Double chocolate makes me think of sweet sweet candy from an Easter basket, this is not that. I had a milk and cookie stout once. Did not taste anything like milk or cookies. Oatmeal stout, where do I begin... Any how this has a nice pour, deep dark look, giant foam head that lasts longer than my first marriage. The bottle is nice. A plain red , nothing fancy. Clearly they wanted more attention paid to what is inside. I'm making dinner tonight while drinking this. A nice thin ribeye sat atop sweet potato fries with blue cheese , with a nice balsamic glaze.  Doesn't that sound nice? Maybe I'm really just eating boiled cabbage. See just like an f'n stout label you have no clue what's real.."
""
""
""
""
"In the end, I think this reminds me of a lot of other Rogue beers, nothing quite bad, but it's missing something that makes me want it over and over.  I miss some sort of sweetness somewhere in the beer to balance the bitter, if even for a moment."
""
""
""
"Long story short: I'd your like beer and chocolate, you NEED to try this. Now. Get up, find a place that has it on tap, and buy it. You won't regret it. The only thing you'll regret is that you'll eventually finish the glass."
""
""
"O- Wonderful. Enjoyed it with a piece of red velvet cake, and it was a perfect pairing. I suppose this could be enjoyed with a nice steak as well, but I'm quite sure this was meant to be drank with desert. Cheers, gents! Time to pour another glass."

"As advertised,a very chocolatey beer. There's a dark chocolate malt base, but the really impressive chocolate character is the slightly sweet milk chocolate. Good stuff, but definitely a dessert beer."
""
"A most excellent Rogue brew. Ale pours a thick opaque black with a light dissipating tan head and fine beaded lacing. Nose of dark bakers chocolate and fresh black coffee like a fine black Bavarian chocolate cake. Taste is much like the nose, chocolate up front with roasted dark grains and a light coffee taste to the background. SOLID offering. Moderate carbonation and creamy mouthfeel round this beast of a brew out with a nice alcohol kick that is so well hidden it is not detectable till after the glass is done. NICE. A stout lovers dream, better yet in a growler, as compared to a bottle which has a little bit lighter mouthfeel."

"Pours a nice thick black with a tan head that dissipates fairly quickly. You need to agressively pour to produce a head. Smells like a typical chocolate stout. Seeing that this is a ""double"" chocolate stout I was anticipating a very strong chocolate flavor. More of a coffee flavor. Not as strong as I was expecting. Not too sweet but just a nice decent amount of sweetness. The bitterness is very mild. Overall, a typical chocolate stout but a bit of a letdown with the marketing."

"Medium bodied with modest carbonation, and a chocolate aftertaste. The alcohol is well disguised, I can't even detect it at all, and this is a 9.00 abv beer. A very nice effort by Rogue. Worth trying if you get the chance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not huge on chocolate stouts but this is far and away one of the better ones I've had. Great nose, taste to match, not overwhelming. Rogue just knows what makes a great stout or darker ale."

"O-Was a very interesting beer . You can smell the very sweet smell, yet it did not taste sweet , it had a nice bitter taste, like you would get if you ate coco with very little sugar in it. You also get the hop kick. I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
"O - Just enough hops to balance things out while still allowing the malts to shine. Not deep or complex, just straight forward chocolate bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I prefer this over FBS. Founders has more of a coffee taste, I prefer the double chocolate. To me, the Rogue is smoother."

"Has a good look upon first pour - somewhat decent lacing - nothing to get too excited about. Good aroma - better than other chocolate stouts I have tried, not overpowering and incredibly fake like Choklat or others. Lots of roasted malt and chocolate syrup and cocoa. Taste is similar with a slight bitterness to it. Not bad at all."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste begins with a full chocolate malt attack that is followed momentarily by a slightly bitter and dry finale. This deserves the high ratings it is getting. I'd have it often if I could afford to."
""
" The bomber was a bit of a chore to finish. Ice Cream is the correct answer."
""
""
""
"O - I was hoping for an intensified Young's or Sam Smith's but this is not that beer. It's much more of a regular imperial stout, but sadly not one that I particularly enjoyed."
""
"Poured almost black body with two finger head and no lace. Aroma is dominated by dark chocolate, bordering on Hershey's chocolate syrup from when I was a kid (I guess there is some milk/lactose or something in there). Not bready but sticky and chewy, full-bodied, wouldn't characterize this beer as chocolate milk with booze added to it but this is definitely a sweet beer that also has a husky, dry bitter chocolate, roasted even, malt presence to balance the beer and give it a dry, warming edge."
"An excellent example of the chocolate stout category, it just displays chocolate in every aspect. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is one can never have enough chocolate in a brew that represents such a amazing food. Definitely recommend this whether your a fist time tester or weathered veteran in the micro brew field"

"Overall: This is one of my favorite double chocolate stouts. it's a shame it's only seasonal. This is one of Rogue's best beers. It's a fantastic representation of a double chocolate stout, with a little bit of west coast hoppage but not to the point of overbearing. It can be considered a dessert beer, but it's so much more than that. It's just delicious all the way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: As one of my first double chocolate stouts this is a winner. I would recommend this beer and with a 9%ABV its a shake rattle and roll baby."

"O: Enjoyable, but very chocolaty. Knock over the head chocolaty. I'd recommend for a special occasion to share. Drinking the entire 750 was a bit strenuous. (haha, just a bit)"
""
"Pints High!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, good chocolate stout, not amazing, the bitter finish kind of takes away from the dessert appeal for me"
"Definitely one of, or maybe the best chocolate stouts I have had."

"Overall- an excellent imperial stout. However, I would have preferred the aroma to continue, and the pronounced chocolate-coffee taste to linger."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I will have this again. So, it is good. It has a much heavier chocolate flavor than their regular chocolate stout. It reminds me of the Rouge Voodoo Donut Chocolate Peanut Butter, Banana...minus all the extras. Good job Rouge."

"O - 4 - Good beer. It's not too overpowering but not too simple. I like it. It's almost like a better version of Old Raspy."
""
""
""
"Overall: A damn delicious chocolate stout that I would love to enjoy more often, however at the current price point I doubt I would make a multiple purchase within a year. Chocolate stout lovers should give this one a shot."

"O/Note: A great chocolate stout, though it's been a while since I had it."
""
"This is a somewhat one-dimensional effort, but somehow it all works out in the end. Nice chocolate aroma and flavor that never becomes cloying."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A good to really good, but mostly good. Definitely worth a try if money is not an issue or you like beers similar to the Brooklyn variation. I'd save some money and go for a Samuel Smith's."

"O: Very good chocolate stout. Rogue actually surprised me with this one."
""
""
"750 ml bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark tan head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, vanilla, fudge, oats, light roast, chocolate syrup, floral, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and chocolate notes; with good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, vanilla, fudge, light roast, oats, chocolate syrup, floral, and roasted earthiness. Light amount of earthy hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, vanilla, fudge, light roast, oats, chocolate syrup, floral, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and chocolate syrup flavors; with a fair amount of hop bitterness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial chocolate stout. All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and chocolate flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"O - Pretty good chocolate stout. One of the better ones I've tried. Subtly strong."

"overall the name promise definitely rings true in this beer. love it."

"Overall - It's not the thickest, but it delivers a great experience and tastes so good. I think the dark chocolate makes this brew super unique (to me) and it holds its own among the greats of the style. I can see how some might be intimidated by the bitter and it being a bit thinner than some others."

"750 ml bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black, and has a couple inch tan head that stays around for a long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. The aroma is very nice, the brew smells mostly like milk chocolate and malted milk balls, along with some roasted malt and vanilla. It tastes like milk and bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt, coffee and vanilla. Nice mix of both sweet and bitter chocolate flavors. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and coating with moderate carbonation. Rogue does a great job with their stouts, and this one is no different. It's a good brew, definitely worth trying, especially if you've never had it before. $11.99 a bottle."

"Bought at Whole Foods, Bend, Oregon, USA. Large bottle shared between two.As part of a six-week West Coast beer tour. I rate to taste, not to style. See my blog for more details: carbeers.wordpress.com"
""
""
"O- Overall, really good beer. Delivers exactly as promised: tons of chocolate flavor. If it has a problem, it's that it is too simple. The chocolate and malt flavors are delicious but I really don't detect much else going on. Still excellent if you want a good chocolate stout."
"Poured into 2 pub glasses, this was a treat for my girlfriend. Pacman yeast lends a hand to the mouthfeel of this sweet dessert stout, which sets Rogue ales apart from the rest. Obvious chocolate flavor that unfolds in stages. Chocolate syrup up front rolls into a very rich fudge brownie flavor. A good whiff of alcohol too, but it comes off like a chocolate liqueur. There's also some honey flavor in there, and the malt is almost totally subsumed by chocolate. Aside from drinking, this would be great for baking. It's mighty sweet, but light bodied enough to enjoy a big glass."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Rogue's done it again. I always forget there is a reason I stay away from Roguie but every once and a while they suck me in. Do you like an old vanilla coke with Swiss Miss poured in? Me either. Stay away from this one."
""
"not sure why I waited so long to try this wonderful beer. its always on the shelf, and its fairly priced, what have I been doing? anyways, this pours a flat dark brown color with a luxurious creamy head in the tan range, like a nitro pour. the nose is really chocolaty, a lot like youngs or something, its real chocolate, not just chocolate malt. It reminds me of hot chocolate mix or nesquik or something. nice roast, more bitter than sweet on the chocolate in nose and taste. the flavor is really chocolate forward, like a higher end organic dark chocolate bar. its really lovely, especially because its all that flavor with out the sweetness. the feel is velvety smooth, super soft, creamy, and light for the color, although it is full bodied. carbonation is also a lot like a nitro beer, airy and livening. what I like most about this beer is its chocolate intensity without being sugary at all. I think its every bit as good as the regular chocolate stout, and a pretty good bang for your buck. not to be ignored! take it from me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's a sweet treat, best to have it in small doses. You'll enjoy it a lot more if you pair it with any chocolate dessert, because by itself it'll just feel like too much sweetness after a while."
""
"Great double stout, and although lacking complexity this one's now a new favorite of mine simply due to how Rogue makes use of what's in here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is a deep dark brown with a thin layer of head that still left some nice lacing behind. Chocolate and a little roast were present in the nose. Chocolate was very upfront in the flavor and the roasted bitterness took over on the finish. However, there was a lingering chocolatey sweetness throughout. Excellent effort and a true chocolate beer experience!"
""
""
"Overall it grows on you. I am through my first glass and I feel ready for another and will be satisfied with a tad more. Glad I am sharing this one though. It is slightly reminiscent of Sam Smiths Chocolate Stout. Just more robust and bitter. At the price it is a bit hard to want another. The purpose for me taking another would be to age and see if I can knock down some of the bitterness."
"This beer is pure liquid chocolate brew. Relatively high ABV and the finite novelty of chocolate are the only things that limit the enjoyability of this Rogue."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I drank the whole bomber myself, and the taste got redundant. I think if I just drank one 12 oz serving, I'd rate this higher. It gets repetitive because it is too simple, but I still enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
"Consumed less than six months after purchase. Black, nice but short head, some lace. Chocolate, caramel, malt aroma. Very soft mouthfeel for a bottle. Big rich body. Chocolate and malted milk flavors. Pleasant sweet finish. A bit of alcohol is briefly present at the finish. Would go well with vanilla ice cream and blueberry/raspberry pie."
""
""
""
"Overall - It's been a few years since I've had this. I'd forgotten just how incredible it is. I paid $10 for the 750ML bottle. Pricey, but well worth it as a once a year purchase. A punch you in the mouth chocolate explosion, but just enough balance between the sweet and bitter chocolate notes to make it completely drinkable. Absolutely lovely."
""
"O - Very smooth chocolate beer, reminds me of the ST Chocolat, but not quite as good with the residual bitterness as opposed to residual sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a big beer with big flavors. well crafted and well done. It has good flavors and a decent complexity. I'd say it's worth a try."
""
"O: This beer is deceptively easy to drink because no traces of alcohol are perceptible in the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As an addendum, drinking a 22oz. bomber of this is a hefty task. The last couple drops were a bit much."
""
""
"B-"
"Could use more carbonation, seems a little flat."
"Buy again?_Definitely"
"O: This is NOT a true dessert beer, as any sweetness the chocolate provides (and it does provide a good deal) is scrubbed clean by the roasted and hop bitterness. And yet, it still comes off as being wildly out of whack. Cool bottle, meh beer, horrible price - basically, just another Rogue product."
""
""
"O: Overall its a very good. Not one of my favorite stouts but i would buy it again. I think the bottle is pretty cool also. Just a side note, the beer is 9 % ABV not 8 like BA said it is."
""
""
""
""
"Overall. A decent chocolate beer but I'm not finding it especially tasty. Good, but not amazing and not as desert-like as I was kind of hoping for."
""
""
""
""
""
"On-tap. Â½ pt Glass. Enjoyed on marÂ´13. Pours pitch black headed by a brownish foam. Crown is creamy & lasting. Roasted malt, fudge chocolate & dried nut aromas. Creamy & malting sensation touched by dry bitterness. Full body. Soft to moderate carbonation. Sharp bitter cocoa in the middle gets along with dried nut astringency & linger into a long bitter finish. Chocolate hues on the aftertaste. ABV is shown by gentle warming sensation in the back. Very well balanced sweet vs bitter flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"Clear dark black brown colour with a average to large, frothy, good lacing, mostly to fully lasting, light brown head. Aroma is heavy malty, roasted, chocolate, cacao, dark chocolate, milk chocolate. Flavour is moderate to heavy sweet and moderate bitter with a long duration, chocolate, peppery notes. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft."

"Open Question: I wonder if the ""single"" chocolate tones down the overbearing smell a bit and is more in line with the taste the beer actually delivers..."

"O: A nice dessert beer, went well with molten chocolate cake. A little rich to be consumed all the time though."
""
"O - Wow, this is a superb imperial chocolate stout. Alcohol is not evident at all and results in an rather easy drinking beer. Lots of natural chocolate flavor, nothing artificial. Great balance."
""
""
""
"The attack on this beer is where all the action is - chocolaty, malty, good bitter notes. The mid-palate, however, is where the beer takes a turn for the worse and is not ameliorated by the finish. Nothing but medicinal bitterness from the mid-palate onwards... buttressed by an unsmooth texture. I had high hopes for this stout but re-purchase it I will not."
""
""
"O - Not my favorite chocolate stout but a nice offering from Rogue. Your results may vary if you have this out of the bottle."
"Look, I love chocolate, and I love chocolate beers. So when this bright red bottle jumped out at me on the shelves, I grabbed it. The name does not disappoint. The pour is luxuriously dark and rich with a tan head and intricate lacing. The coffee-cocoa aroma entices the taste buds. And then the taste. As Sulu says, ""Ohhh Myyy."" Double-chocolate indeed! But it isn't just any chocolate. It's the rich and bitter taste of a dark chocolate that dominates. A rich taste indeed. I loved this effort from Rogue."
""
""
"O - Excellent offering from rogue, proof that when they do something right, they do it 100%. I will always be on the lookout for another double chocolate, a great dessert beer."
""
""
"Overall a really great beer that I wish I could find for the 9 dollar price tag again (like southern tier Chocolat) but if you see this under 10 dollars pick it up. Tasty stuff."

"Highly suggest using this stout for a chocolate stout float! Yep....that's what I said. Give it a shot folks."

"I admit, at first, I was drawn by the shiny red bottle. Big, obvious, and obnoxious. The ""brewed with natural flavors"" tagline was also a little disconcerting as this is usually marketing lingo for ""brewed with natural-tasting flavors"". In fact this beer is brewed with real ingredients, no shortcuts taken. I also admit that I was biased against Rogue since none of their beers had wow'ed me. So I tried this one attempting to keep an open mind. Fortunately I had the opportunity to taste this back to back with another great chocolate stout, which is in fact a porter, called Mogli by Cascade. These two beers are very similar. Pours very thick with a tan head leaving rings of lacing, slightly thicker than Cascade's Choco Porter. The smell is KAPOW! chocolate! It's not even subtle. The flavor is deliciously sweet milk chocolate balanced by notes dried fruit and hops on the finish. Also some alcohol heat on the finish. My bottle says 9%, not 8% according to BA. Fully bodied and silky smooth. Not as oily as the Mogli but at the same time not quite as punchy on the hops. I love this style and recommend it without reservation."
""
"Notes: ABV 8.7%. Overall this was an enjoyable high alcohol chocolate beer. Not too sweet but still something nice to sip on for a chocolate kick. Nice mix of flavors displaying a wide range of chocolate. I know, it's crazy to find a tasty, decently priced Rouge beer, but this follows the original Chocolate Stout up nicely."
""
""
"O - stronger alcohol wise than Youngs, which to me is the best in the style, but it does hold up to it pretty well. It does feel slightly one dimensional, but that is by intention and design."

"Poured into a chalice black with a one finger tan head. Very little retention and lacing. The scent is very strong of Cocoa. Smells like hot coco without the hot steam. The taste is much the same. Very strong cocoa taste over whelms the base chocolate malt that is noticable once the cocoa goes away. Mouthfeel is medium, standard for the style. Overall, this is probably a once in a blue moon beer, both because of the over powering flavor and because of the price."

"O: a rich, highly flavored ale that is extreme but not challenging. Character changes with warming. High ABV is fairly well hidden."
""
""
""
"Overall: Like I said before, I haven't had a bad beer from Rogue. This is a ""must try"" for anyone who enjoys the chocolate stouts like I do. A very well crafted beer that will be sure to make it to my refrigerator in the near future."
"Chocolate, Chocolate and more chocolate. Weighing in at slightly over 8% abv this does garnish the name of stout with malty hints in its nose and pouring pitch black out of the bottle with white lacing. Nothing really jumped out at me as original about this beer nor would I attempt to try it again. It's got an IBU rating of 50 in line with the hoppyiness present in other Rogue beers."
""
"M: Full. Thick. Mouth coating stout."
""
"Overall: I thought the chocolate note was very nice, but I thought the bitterness was a bit distracting. The chocolate notes didn't stick around as long as I would have liked. Not a bad chocolate stout by any means, but not my favorite."
""

"Overall a very good beer."
""
""
"Overall- Good use of bittersweet and semi-sweet chocolate without running the risk of becoming too cloying or too syrupy. Lots of roasted flavours add to the profile. I like Rogue's Chocolate Stout, but this one takes it to a whole other level."
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a red-enameled twenty-five point four ounce Belgian bomber, sealed with a pry-off crown."
"M: Slightly less full-bodied than the appearance and aroma would suggest but nice and smooth."
""
"Pours black - no light showing through when back lit - with a thick creamy tan head. Consistency of this beer appears thicker than your average. Good frothing but little lacing on a clean glass. Smells of darker malts and chocolate is easily detectable via nose. Taste reveals a sweet chocolate flavor - kind of like a Hershey bar in a bottle with some other surrounding malts. Great beer for the season."
"O-This beer is something of a one-trick pony. The chocolate flavor is almost overpowering and I could have used a bit more complexity to balance things out. That being said, this IS a double chocolate stout, so I cannot judge too harshly for being heavy on the chocolate."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours nearly completely black, with a 2 inch brown head, that clings to the sides of the glass. Smell is bakers chocolate, carmel, and roasted grain. Taste is all about the chocolate, one dimensional in a good way. Body is medium, with a good amount of carbonation, slightly dry, and very easy drinking. This is a good chocolate stout and it is nice to see a solid price tag, at less than $7 a 750 bottle. I think this is a great beer to introduce people to imperial stouts."
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and chocolate syrup. Taste is much the same with a slight tartness in the flavor. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice aromas and flavors."

""
""
""
""
"Pours pitch black with some bubbly cream floating on the surface. Smells like pure chocolate...that's pretty much it. Dark, syrupy, straight-up chocolate sweetness. As expected, the flavor is more of the same: a big mouth full of semisweet chocolate morsels. Heavy, almost syrupy body. Wow. One was enough for me (I honestly don't think I was in the mood for such a pure dessert-like beer). Chocolate to the max. I prefer the regular Chocolate Stout just because at least there is some indication of a stout underneath. Tasty in a novelty sort of way."

"So excited to try this and glad with the new importer we see these alot cheaper than before and it pours the blackest kola hue which lets no light in whatsoever and leaves a two finger chocolate laced head and a rim of lacing,the smell is sweet milky chocolate,chocolate liquor,cappicino,turkish delight, and caramel,the mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation which suits and on first sip its like chocolate icecream very enticing followed by caramel,turkish delight,cappicino,cocoa,a slight dark fruitiness and finished just like a nice mocha and overall i really enjoyed this and would buy again without doubt a must try that would suit a rich hearty meal or chocolate dessert."
""
"Overall, it had promise as a sweet dessert beer, but it had too many flaws."
"O - Overall I was blown away by the deliciousness of this beer. I would recommend it to anyone even if you don't prefer stouts. This beer is a game winner."
"Exceptional as a chocolate stout. No artificial tastes or off-flavors. Smooth as velvet and highly enjoyable at this strength. Great alcohol profile where it's never heady. One of Rogue's prizes."
""
""
"o: I was dissapointed to see a Rogue tap take over at the Bull's Head. I'm just not much of a fan. This cheered me up quite a bit."

""
"O - Very tasty chocolate stout. Rogue's best beers are always their stouts."
""
""
"Overall, a damn good stout! I have tasted the ""regular"" stout from Rogue, but it doesn't compare to this! One of the best stouts I've ever drank; bitter and sweet in perfect balance to not feel overwhelming. Would have it again for sure, and surely will look for it again when the winter comes."
""
""
"overall? wow. i have never had a beer so chocolate-y. it is literally like drinking dessert. the bottle i have says it is 8.7%. i read some people had differing thoughts."
"Everything that I got on the nose, I get on the palate with a full & rich texture, full body, & long finish. Overall, this is a solid beer worth trying at least once. Recommended if you're looking to try something new, but if you're strapped for cash....go with the regular chocolate stout instead."
""
""
"Whoa! This one is really chocolatey. Like, I am drinking from the chocolate river in the Willy Wonka movie, assuming it's got a lot of dark chocolate in the mix. Not much head or anything - not one you'd expect to be that creamy out of the bottle - but the feel definitely comes through. It's a tasty, smooth beer. Not too strong, but strong enough. It's easy to see how this is a double of their classic Chocolate Stout, and I think I give this one the edge. It's more of a sipper, and not a bottle you want to throw $12 down on, but it's a very pleasant experience."
"This beer is an utterly black brew. It's thick and opaque...with a tan head, leaving an intricate trail of lace. The aroma is chocolaty, chalky, and a bit grainy. Grist, powdered cocoa, and chaff. It's an interesting smell. The taste is grainy and bitter...not as layered as expected. Some sweetness, fleeting, and balanced by the chocolate and grain. This beer hides its alcohol well. Chocolate malt aromas come out more after a few sips. Sharp finish, not as full in body as expected. Still, this is a solid brew."
""
""
""
"Overall â€“ It is a rather tasty brew and the name is very appropriate. It begins with sweeter chocolate and then turns more to a bitter chocolate, with big dose of chocolate in the nose. It is tasty and well worth a try."
""
"Poured into a Maudite snifter. Pours a very dark brown, appearing black in the glass. Healthy two finger medium brown head with good retention and great lacing. Aroma of chocolate, light toasted malt, and cocoa. Flavor follows, with very well integrated chocolate, dark and toasted malt, like a creamy whipped chocolate milk with benefits. Finish slightly dry with residual chocolate and light hops; a touch astringent but the other full flavors make up for it. Medium bodied with great creaminess. Very nicely done, an excelllent chocolate stout and one I will return to in the future."
""
""
""
"Double Chocolate Stout by Rogue is currently my favorite beer. The flavor is dark chocolate without being too sweet. The creaminess and bold flavor combined with high alcohol content make this the perfect beer any time of day or night. This beer made me fall in love with the versatility of the stout. Thanks Rogue!"
"Full bodied with a very creamy mouthfeel. Man, Rogue excels when it comes to beer with chocolate!"

"Double Chocolate stout pours a black color with a nice head. There are strong chocolate aromas, and a bit boozy on the nose. The taste contains lots of chocolates and a bit smokey as well, good malty backbone. Had a nice full flavor, but a bit boozy. Overall its a very nice chocolate stout, not as creamy or rich as some others, and I did prefer the regular chocolate stout by Rouge."

"This beer pours motor oil black not surprisingly, with a small brown head. This beer smells of chocolate, both dark and milk with a hint of coffee. The taste matches the smell but also ads a bit of hop bitterness to keep it from being overly sweet. The taste is big and complex and different with every sip. This beer is big and thick but it has the necessary alcohol content that keeps it from being too much. It goes down surprisingly smooth and easy an has a pleasant aftertaste. This is a great brew, big, tasty and pretty easy to drink. Good job Rogue."
"Overall this is exactly what I was hoping for. It is very fragrant and flavorful and tastes great. I think it very much embodies the American Imperial Stout. I raise my glass to they fine folks of Rogue."
"OVERALL: A delicious brew here from Rogue. This can definitely stand up against the best stouts on the market. Quite tasty and well worth buying."
"Some alcohol presence after the swallow. Rich like I wish I was, full-bodied and reasonably smooth. Slight drying in the finish. This is some seriously good beer. One of Rogue's best."
""
""
""
"O - 4.5 - This beer is fantastic. A champ. It is complex and artful in a way that you might miss if you don't take your time. It would be easy to zone in on the chocolate and miss the rest. Usually I'm just ready to move onto the next thing even if a beer is good, but I will definitely buy this again in the near future. What a memorable treat."
""
""
""
"Pours very thick and black with a big brown head. Smells like chocolate fudge, and really I don't get much else but sweet chocolate on the aroma. Tastes like chocolate milk, honestly, again, I don't get much else. The chocolate totally overwhelms any roast, hops, etc. that are supposedly in the be...and you know what...it's so yummy. Very heavy mouthfeel and slightly syrupy and sweet. Perfect for dessert. This is well done. On the sweet syrupy side so be ready, but pour this over ice cream and I imagine it could be heaven."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is decently thick, which informs the sensation here that you are drinking a milkshake. It's a very sweet beer, obviously; more sweet than the average imperial stout. Overall, this is just an average imperial stout. It's so one-note, so uncomplex. This is the rare beer that I enjoy drinking more than I rate it."
""
""
""
"ABV, there leaves something to be desired... and this fills in all the blanks and then some. It's a beautifully executed chocolate imperial stout. God I wish this wasn't $12 a bottle :("
""
""
"Overall: Many of the best chocolate stouts seem to be complex stouts with chocolate added to them. This one showcases a very unique complexity on the chocolate front as well. There is a very nice bitterness bite at first, then a smooth milk chocolate that lingers through the finish. One of my favorite stouts I have ever had, and something I would recommend to anyone looking for a very chocolatey and complex stout."
""
""
""
"O: This is one of the most drinkable beers Rogue has created. Well made and a must for anyone who likes chocolate."
"Overall: I picked up one of these for $7 at whole foods by me. I feel like this is a sipper due to its sweetness. The beer is great, a dessert brew in my opinion, but I will pick up another one soon to treat myself."
""
""
"Itâ€™s all about chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate with this one, from the aroma to the pour to the initial drink and especially the lingering, sweet aftertaste, this is the one to stick with if you are looking for a classic chocolate beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M - Thick, not syrupy though. Great carbonation level and very well balanced."
"Overall -- a wonderful beer experience. It's not a thirst quencher type beer, but a total weighty beer that demands the drinker's attention. It is 8 or 9% ABV so I'll avoid it on-tap-- I couldn't stop enjoying... and have to be carried home."
"big chocolate obviously, bitter bakers chocolate on the finish, milk chocolate, fresh baked desserts, burnt caramel, latte like middle, very light coffee, and the classic rogue yeast. Smooth and creamy."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great dessert beer."
""
""
""
"Overall a great chocolate stout. The alcohol seeks up on you. Winter, a fire, and this beer - makes for a great evening."
"Had this on tap at Redâ€™s Alehouse in North Liberty, IA. A really great chocolate beer that actually puts emphasis on some chocolate flavor. Chocolatey aroma really stands out. Appearance is a chocolate color and dark tan head. Flavor is sweet,but not overly with lots of chocolate and a moderately bitter hops finish. Overall, an amazing beer."
"O- This is a top notch chocolate stout that is up there in that elite class with Southern Tier Choklat. The only thing that could be improved is that the bitterness could be toned down to really let the chocolate come alive more in the taste. All in all, a standout chocolate stout by any measure."
""
""
"O: This is just a re-vamped version of the original chocolate stout, but I'm certainly not complaining. The alcohol boost gives it another level of complexity while retaining the chocolate goodness of the original. Great job by not killing the original yet creating another monster in itself"
""
""
""
""
"O: Pleasantly impressed by the rich chocolate that comes through. Haven't had an Imperial Stout like this before. Quite refreshing in comparison to others of the same style.Â "
"O: I'm pleasantly surprised by this beer. The sweet milk chocolate mixes well with hop bitterness and slight dark chocolate flavor. I still wouldn't call this beer overly complex, but it's solid."
""
"O- an excellent chocolate stout, living up to its name, perfect carbonation and mouthfeel, excellent chocolate stout, i loved it and think it deffinatly sets the bar for this style."
""
"O. Overall, I have to admit that I am a sucker for chocolate. This beer delivers chocolate without turning it into a piece of candy or worse. Alcohol is well hidden, and this is easy drinking. The challenge in a chocolate stout is giving chocolate flavor without ending up with a tootsy roll in a bottle. Rogue has done that."
""
""
""
"O: The alcohol flavor and warmth do detract from the flavors of the original, but that is to be expected. It still has the pure flavors of the chocolate stout though."
""
""
""
""

"I will look forward to the day when I have a stout with a body better than this one! I will definitely have this beer again."
"One of the most chocolate-y beers I've had. This is a chocolate-lover's ""dessert"" brew. A fair amount of subtle complexity is under all the chocolate. A nice chocolate-y sipper!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a five finger tan head that fades very slowly to a ring leaving a good lace. Black color, no highlights. Good carbonation and heavy bodied. Chocolate nose and flavor is sweet baked chocolate. Label has the ABV at 9% but its hidden. $12 for a 750ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
""
"*I have just started drinking craft beer, and leaving reviews on BA. Once I know more about what I should be looking for I will re-review."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A fair stout, very mediocre in my opinion, as I previously stated, this seems to be a year old, and I think thats why the chocolate has faded along with some of the other flavors. The body is good, but could be heavier for a double."
""
""
"$13 for this is something I would (and have done) over and over again, and I'm kinda cheap. This was the fresh bottle, I'll revisit after I drink the one that has been aging for about 2 years as of now."
""
"Characters require... I'll cone back to this later and edit.... Ooooh it is not the best"
""
"Great beer"
""
""
""
"O: Not something I would seek out again, but I'm glad to have tried it."
""
""
""
""
"Drink- I really enjoyed this as we winded down the night. Allowed some other taste buds to be used and allowed palate to reset a little bit. I would probably come back to this one in the future. I think this would be probably the best beer ever put on Nitro."
""
""
""
"Overall, very good. Don't go into this looking for some complex masterpiece. Know that you are getting a chocolate bomb and enjoy your dessert."

"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a Founders Reserve Snifter the brew is near black in color with a brown/mocha head that appears thick but quickly morphs into just a tiny bit of head floating on the surface. The smell is all Chocolate with just a touch of coffee and it smells as if it would be sweet chocolate and the overall taste reflects this sweetness though not coyingly so. The taste is Chocolate of different varieties...Hershey bar, bittersweet, mocha with a nougat center with a touch of spice. The taste doesn't quite match the nose of this one which is a real downer for me. On the tongue there is some bitterness at the end and a smooth but not chewy mouthfeel. Overall this is a very solid brew. If the taste of this one matched the nose it would be all one could ask for in a chocolate stout. For my taste I would rather have Rogue's regular Chocolate stout but I am glad I had the opportunity to try this one."
""
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. My goodness. Where have YOU been? Rogue doesn't seem to get a lot of love, but this right here is done right. Pours a jet black with but the slightest mocha head that fizzles away and leaves but a thinly veiled layer floating atop the rest of the beer. The nose on this is simply unreal. This smells straight up like a chocolate bar...and not bakers chocolate either. This has a wonderfully sweet bouquet that's just...all chocolate. The taste is over the top on the chocolate side of things. This is one crazy sweet beer. The chocolate melds with a skosh of vanilla and a faint hint of cinnamon. The mouthfeel is real smooth. This has a pretty effervescent quality to it. It's not the thinnest stout I've had, and certainly not the thickest. This leaves a pretty bitter aftertaste on the back of your tongue that lingers for quite a while after each sip. Overall, this is one damn fine beer. I'll certainly look out for more of this in the future."
""
""
"Overall - Tasty, a pure dessert beer, though not as overboard as i was expecting, and a little steep in the price takes away from it. If you like regular chocolate stout, you would love this, but still, not the best dessert beer ive had."
""
""
"Overall a great winter beer that is perfect for a cold day. Nicely made and well balanced, it is well worth consumption!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Nt bad but there are many other brews that I would go for first. The bitter aftertaste nearly ruins it."
"O: All in all, this is a very good beer! This beat the Rogue Chocolate Stout by a mile! This still has the heavy acidy taste of chocolate stout, but it also has heavier chocolate tastes to subdue that acid. Good to try if you like big thick stouts."
"D: it did drink pretty good but I was definitely digging the aroma then then the overall flavor. still it was pretty tasty."
""
""
"chocolate!!!"
""
""

"O - This is a good offering by Rogue. One of the best I've had in a while by them. Very good flavors, well crafted and awesome chocolaty goodness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Full-bodied with low carbonation. Very syrupy...almost like Hershey's chocolate syrup, a bit watered down and with alcohol. Pretty damn good but also absolutely a dessert beer. Very thick and heavy. Recommended!"
""
""
""
""
"Great example of the style. Solid impy stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well, I like it, I really do. Draw me in with the sexy, silky, and overwrought chocolate confectionery intro, and then spring a more balanced oatmeal stout on me, without losing the cocoa goodness inherent in the ""DOUBLE CHOCOLATE"" promise. A grand dessert accompaniment, I would imagine, but still pretty damned enjoyable all by its lonesome, as well."
""
""
""
"and the double is just more of the good stuff. Well done!"
"Poured into a sampler glass, though this was definitely one worth a full pour. Opaque black color, very dark brown edges when held to the light, the head was absent, probably just due to the pour. I went in for a sip, but first got hit with an unmistakable aroma of rich chocolate milk. Taste of rich chocolate, Hershey bars, and...more chocolate. A subtle earthiness near the finish, with some roast coming through, but mostly just a one-dimensional big chocolate bomb, and in some cases--like this--that is not a bad thing. Smooth, full-bodied, lusciously drinkable."
" The flavor is much like the aroma there is a mild cocoa taste which has slight bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt with light bitter hop accent which also augments the slight roasted malt and mild alcohol flavor. The beer is heavy on the cocoa and chocolate malt which pretty much overwhelms the rest of the taste after half the pint is finished. I enjoy the mild yeast fruitiness and light roast in the finish. Overall a pretty intense stout, not necessarily too sweet for a cocoa beer, the mild fruity and roasted finish are good which means you don't have too much cloying sweetness and the alcohol is pretty restrained for an 8% beer. I would order this again if I see it on tap."
"O - a big ass stout with loads of dark chocolate flavour, this stuff is money"
"O: Excellent beer, but could hide the alcohol better."
"well I guess I could complain about the 14$ price tag but at the end of the day I don't feel ripped off."
"A very solid brew that left me wanting more but was almost a desert by its self. Tried this with a spicy burger at first but then saved it for later and had it with some chocolate which paired very well. Tried this both cold and closer to room temperature liking the latter a little better."
"O - The most cocoa flavor I have ever tasted in a beer. Probably doesn't go well with most food but it's a perfect dessert beer."
"Aroma is perfect. That of straight chocolate and caramel. Appearance is nice with a healthy tan head upon pour that laces into a halo. Brown cocoa like rings circle the bottom of my snifter. Tastes of candy bar- milky way. Amazing with ice cream. Palate is extremely smooth and creamy. Perfect carbonation. Overall my favorite chocolate stout so far."
"Light, but silky when sloshed in the mouth. Moderate carbonation. When refilling my glass, this was a gorgeous beer. Judged to style, not my particular preferences."
"Overall, a nice stout that is worth checking out if you don't mind being hit hard by chocolate in your beer. It is very drinkable for a double stout since the ABV is 8% and the alcohol is hidden relatively well."
"Overall: Nice offering from Rogue, and certainly one of the most chocolate-forward chocolate stouts I've ever had."
"I have not been a fan of Rogue beers lately, but this is very good. Think some of the Southern Tie stouts, and you will get the gist. Maybe not an everyday beer, but something that is very enjoyable for desert or a digestif."
"Cheers!"
"O: I'm pleased to note that this is my first rogue beer that I like. In fact, I'm quite blown away. I might reconsider having some other ales from them."
"Overall a very nice chocolate stout, a very good after dinner beer enjoyed with a nice chocolate desert."
"One could argue more stout is needed to make it more beery, but there is no doubt that Rogue Double Chocolate Stout is delicious nectar. As a dessert, this would be excellent, but there's one food pairing that sounds sublime; bacon strips!"
"Poured from the tap a dark ominous black with a trace of a tan head that stuck to the side of the tulip glass. Smell was heavy with chocolate and liqourice and roasted grain with a hint of alchohol hding behind the grain. Taste was bold coffee and chocolate with a finish of warming alchohol but a nice clean taste of the roasted grain. Alchohol is there but does not dominate the palate and just hides behind the bulk of this beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and dense, not heavy but very nice beer to sip on and leave on the palate. Overall a very nice beer I had this with a plate of jambalay and it really held its ground against the spice of the food and in my opinion comlimented the food well. Nothing like some cajun on a cold day with a great stout. I will definately be trying this beer again."
"This is a passable beer, nothing more, and something of a letdown. Rogue's pretty easy to find, but other than their Hazelnut Brown, I haven't had any tour-de-force offerings from them. I plan on taking a Rogue hiatus while I explore other breweries."
"Well you like the regular Chocolate Stout from Rogue, then youâ€™re probably going to dig this one as well, as it basically just comes off as bolder and fuller feeling take on that from the higher alcohol. I didnâ€™t find to be a HUGE upgrade or anything over the regular version but this was still a pleasant and tasty sipper."
"I'm not a fan, but it seems I'm in the minority."
"To me, this beer is closer to Young's Double Chocolate stout than to Rouge Chocolate Stout. While the regular Chocolate Stout had a monotone baker's chocolate taste and a thin mouthfeel, this beer is multi-faceted and creamy. I'll have to rank this as one of my favorite stouts of any variety."
"O- This is quite simply an improvement of the original Rogue chocolate stout, which was already my favorite chocolate stout. It shrugs off the lighter, fizzier taste of the original to bring a thick, creamy body. The tastes are stronger and more pronounced, and it just feels like more of a ""stout."" Compared to other chocolate stouts, this one has more of a milk chocolate taste, but its not over-done like some. A bit pricey (I paid $11.75 for the bomber bottle). Truly a great beer and one of my new favorite stouts."
"lots of aromas of lactose and chocolate and a bit of coffee. I almost picked up some licorice in there as well. First thing that hits you is the ton of lactose sugar and a wall of chocolate. Deep german dark chocolate mixed in with some bron sugar and a touch of coffee. Definatly some licorice in here too. Super creamy. It had ample carbonation which really hung around well throughout the sesson and helped to give it a really full feel. Lots of creamy notes made this a definite dessert beer."
"One of the best chocolate beers, and takes us a long way forward from Shakespeare chocolate stout. Tremdous treat to the nose of dessert chocolate fondue. Above average mouthfeel, though carbonation right there. American chocolate with its sweetness, and more bittersweet European chocolate. Fairly complex, I found this well balanced between bitter and sweet. Dark brown body.My swingtop bottle from Premier Gourmet."
"This double chocolate stout has my attention and I have vowed to never look at another chocolate stout again. For better or for worse, this brew is mine and I am hers until death. Unique, special, and exceptional. A+ I snagged a bottle for $13 at Half-Time in Poughkeepsie."
"I forgot what I paid for this, but I know it was pricy. But with that said this was totally worth it. Rogue has nailed this beer to it's style perfectly."
"O: I really like this beer. In comparison to the other double chocolate stouts out there this one is the best so far. I like the creamy head, lack of overpowering coffee tastes/smells and how easy this beer is to drink. Only downfall is not the perfect cocoa/chocolate smell I'm looking for but it's still really good."
"O: Obviously a very chocolate forward stout, but the taste gets balanced very nicely and has a little complexity to it which I appreciate from a beer that seems to be one flavor dominate from the outside."
"After having the Mocha Porter they put out, and not finding it to be very impressive. I saw this one on the shelves and hoped that it would be better. The beer poured out as a nice deep brown color with a thick creamy tan head on it. The retention was really nice on this one. The smell of the beer had a good amount of chocolate on the nose and some roasted malts also. The taste reminded me of something along the lines of chocolate milk or hot cocoa. The flavors were very creamy and chocolatey. Not quite as much as Southern Tier's Choklat though. The mouthfeel was smooth and had a decent body to it. Not as thick as I was hoping for. Overall I found this beer to be pretty good. Probably one of Rogue's best."
"Had a couple of these in 12oz snifters @ Fatheads Pittsburgh."
"Enjoyed via the usual auspices of the Ohoove cellars, this black beauty shows a solid black color with a modest light brown colored head and plenty of lacing. The aroma says chocolate mint-pine. Really a beautiful flowery malt sweetness. The palate picks up a solid chocolate charcoal that includes enough citrus edge to make this thoroughly enjoyable though a it may prove a little too sweet for some. It has a satin texture with fair carbonation to make this feel wonderful in all its chocolaty splendor. I detect a little alcohol but mostly this is a sweet treat that should please any chocoholic."
"Serving type: Bottle into a tulip."
"If youâ€™re mood for a sweet beer and want it to look as much like liquid chocolate as possible, this is the way to go. And Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s like 1000 calories."
"O: Nice surprised. Was looking for stronger flavors and a fuller body, but solid overall."
"O - Sometimes I love to be proved wrong. I had low expectations for this considering my experience with their beer has been ""over-priced and over-rated"" but this one is a fantastic brew! Well-balanced and rich as hell."
"O: Lots of chocolate in this one, but it is just not as good as Southern Tier Choklate and other big chocolate stouts I have had."
"D: Much more aggressive than it's little brother, but, the original is my favorite Chocolate Stout...and this doesn't hold a candle to it. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this beer, but I'll stick with the original."
"Overall, this is a great beer. Solid components with enough uniqueness and flavor, without being overwhelming. It makes it easy to go back to."
"Thick and creamy mouthfeel -- velvety smooth, in fact -- with adequate carbonation. At 8.00%, ABV is extremely well concealed. Double Chocolate Stout is one double tasty dessert beer."
"Pretty good. I was really excited about this after trying the regular. It was still a good stout but the smell was a big let down and it just fell a bit shorter than normal chocolate stout."
"The Dtrain pulled into BeerFM Andy's place to let off some steam & crack open the Rogue Double chocolate stout. Medium to thick pour of jet black. Aroma knocks you on your ass with sweet scents of sweet coco powder, oak, roast malts, and mild hops. Very sweet pleasant taste of sweet chocolate, malts, hops, bubbly carbonation, and soul warming alcohol with bite. A very enjoyable desert brew."
"This brew pours rich and black with a thick, tan head that probably would have lasted longer and resulted in lacing if I hadnâ€™t been so eager to drink it! The aroma is tantalizing, similar to that of freshly baked brownies. The flavor is robust, with plenty of bittersweet chocolate, roasty caramel-toffee malts and a hint of espresso. It's full-bodied and creamy. Great cold or room temperature."
"$12.99 for 750 ml of Rogue beer almost seems like a bargain. While it's no match for the exquisitely aged Imperial Stout that blew me away last month, Double Chocolate Stout is an enjoyable big beer that most anyone should enjoy. Worth a repeat purchase? Yep."
"D: A nice take on the original. Sometimes things get lost in translation when a bigger verison of a beer is produced...and that really doesn't happen here. But I still have to give the nod to the original."
"o - a terrific, super delicious chocolate beer. falls a little bit short of southern tier choklat for me but still excellent."
"Should be nuts on tap."
"probably a bit overpriced, but a quality beer."
"black with foamy brown head. smell is primarily of chocolate. taste is very rich chocolate and sweet and quite pleasant. Unlike many other stouts, including other double chocolates. ABV is well hidden. mouthfeel is thick. overall, very good. I have not been impressed with too many of rogue's beers, but this one is a very nice winner."
"Rogue finally made a beer that justifies the price tag and at 13 bucks a bottle, that's saying something."
"Texture is smooth and thick, and offers the right amount of body for a brew like this. By far the best ""Imperial"" version Rogue has created to date. The taste is dead on for a chocolate frosted doughnut, delicious desert beer."
"D: Very drinkable, this bomber was gone in no time! Awesome mix of flavors and feel and what's better is that the title didn't disappoint!"
"Overall, an awesome beer that I will seek out any time I can find it."
"D- easy drinking, slightly dryer than I'd like overall. Not the most complex."
"I may be one of the few people who really didn't like this one... Pours off the tap really pretty. Dark with a bit of head. Very thick, coats the side of the glass. Smells chocolatey and good. Not a lot else to it but what do you expect on a double chocolate stout? Tastes like chocolate syrup.... too sweet and one dimensional to me. It feels really good on my tongue but I'd rather drink chocolate syrup. Overall, just too much for me. Not really what I want in a beer"
"Personal opinion: I will only drink this beer again if it is given to me. Nevertheless, fans of the original Rogue Chocolate should stock up and age!"
"Drinkability: Did you enjoy Choklat? Then, you should enjoy this as well. Did you dig Double Chocolate Stout? Then, you should dig Choklat, too. Although, the three percentage points less alcohol is appreciated."
"Wish I had picked up 2 growler's of this highly quaffable brew!"
"Poured into a chalice a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy tan head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, sweet (vanilla), chocolate, toffee, caramel. The taste is very nice, sweet, malty, with lots of chocolate/toffee/caramel, this is the first brew with tons of vanilla in it, very nice touch. Medium body. Very Drinkable, this is a very tasty brew, highly recommended."
"Pours a jet oil black with a giant brown foamy head that leaves lacing forever. The smell is strong with dark fruit,alcohol,and cocoa. The taste is crisp with bitter hops,chocolate,cocoa,dark fruit,and sweet malt. The m/f is heavy with all the flavors mixing very well. As usual, another great beer from Rogue."
"So much in those handle fuels of m's, so much pleasure, so much association of utter...damn, how often do I turn to this?...yum."
"D: So smooth, good flavor. Recommended."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber. The beer is a gorgeous thick, creamy brown-black, with a dark-tan/light brown head, also thick and creamy. The beer smells like you have fallen into a vat of milk chocolate, with hints of bittersweet chocolate aromas, also. The beer has initial flavors completely chocolate, but a blend of milk and bittersweet, with bits of dark chocolate, too. There is a foundation of bitter that all of the sweet flavors are able to springboard from. The beer has flavors typical of a dry stout, but the body of a milk or cream stout. The beer is round and large in your mouth, and it completely deserves to be. The flavors are so well blended, yet they transition to a light and creamy finish, with a slight bitter chocolate aftertaste. Unbelievably creamy and flavorful. Great after-dinner beer!...or breakfast beer, per my wife!"
"The flavor is very much like the aroma--lots of chocolate milk to the initial taste. One pleasant addition is the notable hop in the swallow. This is in the background but it provides a different profile. There's a mild alcohol in the background. Overall, this a very good, Chocolate Stout."
"This is a really good beer. It's probably the best I've had from Rogue. The abv is respectable, but not overpowering in a way that limits drinkability. The alcohol is undetectable."
"D - Holds a lot of bitter char flavors and it's on the stronger side of the ABV curve, but fairly drinkable."
"D- Very easy to drink. Not cloying or overly sweet, but nice dark chocolate dominance. Sweet dessert but smooth."
"D - Couldn't drink this one all day, but I like it for its exceptional taste so I still think it is highly drinkable. It is up there with some of the best imperial stouts."
"D - Very drinkable and pleasurable. Excellent!"
"D: Good for this beer. Couldn't drink a ton of this dessert beer, but what you can drink of it goes down great!"
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a rich roasted and chocolate malt scent along with a killer chocolate aroma. It smells like a chocolate milkshake. The taste is good. It has a smooth chocolate flavor. It's sweet with a roasted edge. It goes down easy and finishes dry and without any alcohol warmth. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a delicious beer. Yes, it's a double stout, but it drinks as easy as the original."
"Comes out of the tap a dark, opaque chocolate brown with a fine-bubbled tan head. Rich, chocolaty aroma is just a little bit sweet and has a coffee undertone as well as a hint of molasses. Rich, sweet chocolate flavor makes this beer like a liquid bonbon. The flavor has smoky, coffee, toffee, hops and licorice hints as well - scrumptious! Texture is lively and quite fizzy. A must!"
"Good, straight forward, but pretty one dimensional. Slightly heavier version of Youngs Double Chocolate."
"D: It makes for a good dessert - pretty sure it's not something I'd opt to drink a lot of... its a real treat, though. I'd love to try it with some double fudge brownies or molten lava cake. Glad I tried this one, as I'm a big fan of Rogue's ""regular"" Chocolate Stout."
"Drinkability is only as good as how much you need chocolate and I am a chocoLOholic!"
"D: A very good beer, but 16 oz gets to be too much because of the sweetness."
"I love the focus on chocolate flavor here with no interruption from countering complexities. This beer does one thing- and it does it well. Just a knotch off of the pace of Southern Tier's Chocolate beers."
"Drinkability: off the charts. I'm no Rogue obsessivist, and they have their occasional airballs, but this one is a Jordan slam dunk."
"D - A perfect ending to my holiday meal, I skipped dessert and instead finshed off the bottle over the next hour. At 8% ABV, this is no session beer, but if you have no place to go, curl up and enjoy."
"This is a new favorite of mine. Perfect beer to enjoy in the winter--I'm saving two for the first big snow storm of the year. If you don't like chocolate, stay away, but if you do, you're in for a treat. Pours extremely dark and heavy with little head. Smell is almost all chocolate. Very chocolatey, more so than any beer I can remember, and yet delicately balanced. A nice hint of hop bitterness tames the richness of this beer. Hides the alcohol amazingly, but very heavy, so definitely not sessionable. Still, this one is a treat, and should be enjoyed over an hour or so, all by itself."
"D: Good"
"D: Very rich, but that didn't really make it all that hard to finish. Surprised to find out that it was 8% abv, though. It hides it well"
"On-tap at Woody's City Market served in a standard pint glass a deep opaque black with a thin light tan head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer and leaves decent lacing on the glass. The aroma is a nice amount of milk chocolate in front of smooth roasted malts. The taste is smooth milk chocolate alongside roasted malts and mild coffee. The beer is medium bodied with mild carbonation and well hidden alcohol. This is a very enjoyable Chocolate Stout, one I would certainly have again if price wasn't a factor."
"Liked the beer, but it grew tiresome towards the end.. Too much of a good thing, I guess..."
"I can't believe I am saying this, but this beer could use a bit more sweetness to it as it is a bit unbalanced without the sweetness. Interestingly enough if they hadn't so over bittered this beer it actually has enough residual sweetness to carry the chocolate, it is just that the huge bitterness completely dominates the sweetness such that it isn't very noticeable. Not bad, but could certainly use some recipe development."
"very drinkable very taste however the abv in my opinion might be to high for the beer but im not marking it down for it"
"D: I read the ingredients list. There is honey in this beer. You actually notice it after you know that it is there. Really a nice beer; however, it almost assaults your senses with its potency."
"I really enjoyed this. I'm not sure if the double series is going to stick around, but this was an excellent dessert beer."
"I had this beer on tap recently at the Golden Rail in Newburgh. I have to say this is one of the best Chocolate Stouts I have ever had. It pours jet black and smooth with little carbonation and a nice burnt brown head. It has a nice chocolate smell with just a hint of the alcohol in there. The taste is as chocolate as you could possibly get but is balanced well with the higher alcohol content of the double. I would definitely recommend this beer on tap, especially with the cold winter months ahead. Enjoy!"
"D - Too sweet for more than one (well, two...) though it does makes a great blending beer, too."
"WOW! Great job to el Bait Shop for carrying this on one of their 105 taps. It's served in a smaller snifter because of the price and alcohol content. It's a super-dark brown with dark-tan foam floating gently on the top. The aroma and taste are a very pleasant chocolate that is thick and rich. It hides the alcohol very well. Forget Hershey, this is a Ghirardelli level of chocolate taste. This is a definite repeat buy."
"A ton of chocolate going on, just not very successfully, above average beer but don't break the bank getting it."
"I really liked the Double Mocha Porter so I was lookin forward to this beer,my expectations were met and exceeded.The pour couldnt get any better, (hence the score)jet black with a fluffy,craterous two finger deep mocha colored head,just perfect in the imperial nonic.Deep almost fude-like chocolate in the nose,a bit of raw nuttiness as well,you could say like a walnut fudge brownie.The chocolate on the palate is cakey but not overly sweet,just enough raw earth/nut in the finish keeps this beer immensely drinkable and makes me want more than I have.I like this better than ST Choklat and that is really saying something,this is a great beer,my wife and I will enjoy my second bottle."
"CHEERS!!!!"
"Served from tap into a small Hefeweizen glass. Poured pitch black with a very minimal tan head. There was no lacing evident throughout. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, chocolate, subtle vanilla, and cream. The flavor was of bitter malt, chocolate, very slight coffee, and caramel. It had a medium feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. You can definitely taste the chocolate as advertised. So much so, that I could see this as being a great gateway brew for a chocolate lover that you know for sure. Definitely worth trying if you have not already."
"Drinkability: Right up there with the Southern Tier Choklat, this is a true dessert beer for the chocolate lover in all of us"
"D - Eh. This started promising but the earth, char, and espresso bitter finish made it somewhat off-putting. I like it a tiny bit better than the regular Rogue Chocolate Stout, and it's a step up from Rogue's regular offerings. Not bad."
"Drinkability: This beer is the ultimate mood beer. If you're with anyone in the mood for chocolate, this beer will absolutely not let you down. Some beers say they taste chocolaty, while other beers just are. This beer may be the king of latter. Now would I want this every day? No. Would I want 22oz of it by myself? Probably very rarely. But for the right occasion? You betcha."
"Overall, a good beer and a nice ode to chocolate, but it really doesn't bring anything memorable to the table. In fact, it's not even different enough from the Rogue Chocolate for me to pick it up again. It's also overpriced. If you are going to buy a Rogue Chocolate Stout, stick with the original as its a better value."
"This is Rogue Chocolate Stout's bigger brother. It's worth trying, but doesn't stand out for me."
"D: The bitterness takes a bit of a toll and while the ABV is well hidden, it's a definite sipper."
"In the end I loved this beer, if you like chocolate and chocolate beers then this is a top notch one for you, no doubt in my mind i will buy this again and soon ,this is a beer that you can drink very quick and enjoy every secound, only thing is be careful because you can not taste the alcohol and it may hit you all at once like it did me, so if you have to drive give it some time. thanks for reading!"
"Deep, black, opaque color. The beer has an intense smell of Chocolate and toasted malts. Smooth taste and is almost like drinking a melted Hershey bar. The beer only gets better as it warms and becomes more complex. I wish i had another one. I've tried many chocolate beers and this one is my favorite."
"Opaque in body with cinnamon head that dissipates. Smells of milk and dark chocolate, cream, and burnt marshmallows. Tastes of deep milk chocolate, whipped cream, some hop dryness, a slight dark cherry note, and then some more dark chocolate to ride the drink out. Heavy, thick bodied beer with light carbonation. A big, delicious beer that is a dessert in of itself."
"Drinkability: Yes it's a chocolate bomb and it hides the ABV completely, but it just doesn't seem well integrated. Rogue's chocolate stout is better."
"D - A 3-4 oz pour of this would be amazing. After that, it gets a little too much."
"D: Had this beer with a friend and chocolate chip cookies. Very enjoyable dessert beer/stout. I will definitely get this beer again."
"D: All night - glad I only got a half because I would have drank an entire growler of this if I had it. The half growler will be gone before the close of the hour!"
"D - This is a sweet beer, that would be great after a meal."
"Very enjoyable beer and highly drinkable. While not living upto the price tag, the beer is incredibly enjoyable. Every aspect of this beer is on point and very pleasing. The drinkability is simply exceptional."
"At first this is a grand slam of a brew but after a glass it is a bit of a chore to finish another. But it does stay true to a heavy chocolatey output. I would stick with the original Chocolate stout though."
"Pours near black with a minimal off white head and some spotty lacing as it makes its way down the glass. Nose is abundant chocolate. I got both milk and more bitter dark chocolate along with a bit of roasted malt. Taste adds a touch of creamy sweetness alongside a tongue smack of chocolate indulgence. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy. Not too alcoholic and certainly not cloying. This sits really well and goes down easy, though I'd say that 8oz or so would be enough."
"Rogue Double Chocolate Stout is a thick black liquid with a fluffy, foamy brown head and some rainbow bubbles. The head stays put and coats the glass nicely. It has a sweet chocolate aroma. It smells like a fondu pot. It has a smooth, soft, full body with a clean, dry finish. Wow! It has a super chocolate flavor! It's slightly sweet and slightly bitter and it all seems to come from the chocolate. There's a possible hint of licorice and coffee. I'm a big fan of their regular Chocolate Stout and this is just more of a good thing."
"Maybe not THE most chocolate-heavy beer around (ST's Choklat still has that title), but definitely one of the best. Not sure if I'd consistently prefer this kicked up version over the original Rogue Chocolate, but I do know that I'd be more than happy with either."
"Drinks well here at 8 no hints of booze or bite."
"I was really excited to try this beer when I heard about Rogue's Double series, and this popped up at Farmer's Harvest in Huntington Beach, CA. Comes in a beautiful bright red painted 750ml bottle, which I poured out into two tall glasses. Rich chocolate aromas were immediately detectable. The beer poured with a thick, creamy, light brown head and a blackish brown body with medium carbonation. Excellent taste, easily my favorite chocolate stout, very dark and sweet and almost thick tasting. Definitely a dessert beer, and definitely worth trying if you can get your hands on some."
"Drinkability is great! Very flavorful! You get something new with each swig! Highly recommended!"
"Drinks: shockingly well. Because Rogue's bottles are usually too overpriced to risk picking one up, I usually avoid them, but this one on tap was cheap and surprising. One of the best chocolate stouts I've ever had."
"The Rogue Double Chocolate Stout pours a pitch black in the glass with a thick chocolate mousse like head, pretty good retention, but no real lacing to talk about. On the nose are pronounced aromas of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, chocolate truffle, chocolate cake...needless to say, there is a lot of chocolate. Besides chocolate, I get raisin, roasted hazelnuts, espresso, & cognac. Everything that I got on the nose, I get on the palate with a full & rich texture, full body, & long finish. Unfortunately, there is a definite alcohol presence. Overall, this is a solid beer, but I like the regular Chocolate stout a little better. (more balance, less booze, & half the price) Again, this is a good beer & worth trying at least once. Recommended if you're looking to try something new, but if you're strapped for cash....go with the regular chocolate stout instead."
"Long lingering aftertaste of burnt grains is left in the mouth with suggestions of dark chocolate. This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate level of carbonation. Quite drinkable but I dont think I could handle the entire large format bottle myself. It was best enjoyed with the company of a few friends. It is something I would try again and would probably pair well with dessert."
"D: the chocolate is nicely done it does not over power the beer which makes it drinkable, a fine example of a double chocolate stout."
"D: The mouthfeel makes this a pleasure to consume. The flavour is good, if not great, the body is light enough to be consumable over multiple glasses, and the alcohol is on the low end for Imperial Stouts. I haven't seen this beer around much, but if you see it, you shouldn't pass it by. Recommended."
"After having the tow other Rogue Double Series (Double Dead Guy and Double Mocha Porter) this might be my favorite. Anyone who likes the regular Chocolate Stout will thoroughly enjoy this."
"Reviewed from my notes. The double chocolate has a dark brown liquid body and a soapy brown head. It smells like a Hershey bar, sweet and rich. The taste has less chocolate than I found in the aroma. I can taste roasted malts at first. Creamy, but subtle chocolate comes. BItterness, but not at the level of some dark chocolates, comes in at the finish and lingers. The beer is full bodies. The carbonation feels like it is made up of big bubbles. It feels creamy in mouth at first, but the aftertaste is a bit powdery. This beer is pretty drinkable, but some will find it a bit strong. If you are looking for a beer with more kick than a Young's chocolate stout, this may be the drink for you. I wouldn't have more than one or two in an evening. It would make a great dessert beer."
"D - This is a solid chocolate stout with a great nose...it doesn't stand up to the regulare Chocolate Stout from Rogue or Young's Double Chocolate Stout...but don't get me wrong, this is a good beer that should be had"
"Overall I enjoyed this. Going to get a couple or so to stick in the cellar. For those with significant others save a few for next valentine's day!"
"I liked this one a lot. Glad I've got one more to cellar."
"Split a $12 bottle with a friend and while I'm usually leery of beer bottles more than $10, this is well worth the price. I love the layers of flavor here. The aroma and initial flavor remind me of a rich chocolate malt shake with a hint of toast. Shortly after, sweet espresso and bitter citrus hops kick in for a dry finish. I haven't been impressed with anything from this style in a long while, but this is fantastic. Check it out."
"Drinkability: Tasty stuff w/o a high abv!"
"this beer is very dark with a brown head. the bottling looks terrific in all red. after i poured it the whole room smelled of straight dark chocolate. i was expecting something more intense than their regular chocolate stout, but it was about the same. something was off in the finish of the taste sort of sour but definitely a good chocolate brew. its good but nothing can top brooklyns chocolate stout. this beer wasn't very complex but still a decent beer but i dont think its worth 13 bucks."
"The beer pours a rich, thick, blackish brown color with fairly good head retention and lacing. On the nose, however... wow! This is a chocolate lover's wet dream. It's as if I'm smelling a solid bar of hershey's dark chocolate, that's how intense it is. There's also hints of vanilla and coffee, but the chocolate aroma is INTENSE!!!! On the palate, the beer is nearly as outrageous, with the flavor profile showcasing plenty of chocolate, vanilla and coffee, with a fairly long, hoppy, dry finish. There's a bit of licorise and burnt toast in the finish, which is just a bit off putting with all the chocolate. Nevertheless, this moderately sweet stout is quite impressive. Mouthfeel is fairly full, with long, dry, bitter finish. Drinkability is pretty good, though the combination of sweetness, bitterness and noticeable alcohol detract just a bit. Nevertheless, this is a very impressive stout from Rogue."
"- Overall one of the greats in the imperial stout world... a must have for anybody. Balanced for sure. Might sneak up on you...."
"On tap at Kickbacks Gastropub in Jax. Poured into a Unibroue tulip. Totally black body with dark beige head. Sticky, sticky, resinous lacing fixates itself to the glass. Aroma is one of the most beautiful chocolate smells of all time....beer or not. I should mention that I believe Rogue's chocolate stout is the best chocolate stout ever made so I'm kinda excited for this one. Taste is very similar to its little brother with maybe a touch more heat. If I had to pick which one was better, I'd have to say it depends on one's mood and maybe the weather. At any rate, the beer is spectacular across the board."
"Taste: a velvety smooth full body with loads of chocoolate flavor."
"D: This was a great drinking experience. Most definitely a desert beer. It was very strange drinking it during the summer time, especially in So. Cal by the beach - but still a home run of a stout."
"The beer has a strong forward sweet chocolate flavor and that give way quickly to a lot of bitterness...a lot of bitterness. I want to say that the bitterness is from the chocolate but OldSock told me that they make this with extract so there shouldn't be any coming from there. It could be roasted malt I suppose, it was just way too much. It also finished quite dry which I didn't appreciate with that level of bitterness. As the snifter emptied I realized that there was a thick layer of sludge at the bottom of the glass. It looked really unappealing. Oh well, its a nice novelty but maybe Rogue should think of something new rather than double all of their standards...now where did I put my double dead guy ale (helles)?"
"D: I'd say this is about at the same level as the regular Chocolate Stout. If you're a fan of chocolate, you really can't go wrong with either one."
"A delight to drink and scary considering the alcohol content."
"Mouthfeel might be a tad thin but not too bad. It actually keeps the drinkability quite high. This is a great beer and the best chocolate stout I've had to date."
"This lives up to its' name and the chocolate rivals Young's Double Chocolate Stout in texture and flavor. Can't say if it's better than the regular Chocolate Stout but it's certainly something worth checking out!"
