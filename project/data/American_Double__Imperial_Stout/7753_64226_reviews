"O- a bourbon forward stout, which is how I like it.  Big and bold, with a subtle honey sweetness to balance it out, well done"
""
""
""
"Bottle from Joe. Thanks brah. Pitch black pour, small fizzy dark brown head. Huge anise aroma with some coconut, lots of bourbon and woody oak, roast, sweet chocolate, caramel, yum. Flavor follows with lots of bourbon and anise and settles into vanilla and caramel. Roast and chocolate are there, and there's an extra sweet tang that I assume is from the honey. Surprised how well this stands up to the barrels at only 8.5%. Rich body, medium low carbonation. Even better than expected."

"Caramel, cereal, lactose, whiskey, bourbon and chocolate. Amazingly balanced on the edge of sweetness with a little alcohol in the nose but none in the taste. If I were to guess this would be a 13%+ alcohol beer but is under 9%. Wonderful rolling complexity!"
""
"Surprisingly complex!  Lots of vanilla and very smooth for a recent bottling!  Great beer!  I will search out more in hopes of cellaring some!"

"O: Excellent beer, the big sweetness reminds me of 50/50 Eclipse, with weaker barrel notes which gives it less balance.  Sweetness becomes a bit much at times, a couple extra months in the barrel and this beer would be elite.  Very enjoyably nonetheless.  4.5"

"I was blown away by this beer.  Silky mouthfeel.  Tons of coffee and dark chocolate notes at the first smell and confirmed in the taste.  The hint of honey is subtle but a welcome addition.  An excellent beer that I wish I had more of."

"O - For an 8.50% abv beer, this beer has so much flavor and brings a lot to the table."
""
""
""

"Great beer. One of the few that truly lives up to the hype."
"The flavor profile is borderline World Class.  It is intense, extremely complex and one of the most balanced BA imperial stouts I've encountered.  It's only shortcoming, which is slight, is the lack of total alcohol coverage.  It begins with a bourbon slap that quickly yields to a rich semi-sweet rush of chocolate.  The middle is a light bitterness over a fading chocolate that allows the astringent alcohol flavor to manifest itself over a coffee note.  As this fades into the finish, light plum notes appear over a sweet vanilla and bourbon background.  The finish is slightly astringent and has a moderate alcohol heat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good beer and one I enjoyed a great deal. Not one of my favorite barrel-aged double stouts, but very well-crafted. The flavor is quite complex (more than I thought it would be at 8.5%). Still, I prefer more vanilla and toasted oak and less dark fruit."
""
""
""
""
""
"Smells hotter than it drinks. Goes down smooth"

"Flavor is sweet, chocolatey, and rich. A guilty pleasure of a beer. This is incredible."

"O- I was surprised at how good this one was.  I knew it was highly rated, but this is one of the best beers I've had in the past year.  Packs a lot of flavor into an 8.5% alcohol beer.  Great job Olde Hickory!"

"The only beer I've had that's better is Bourbon County Stout. If you enjoy BBA beers & Imperial Stout, this is a must have!"
"Thanks Jeffrey2310. 2013 bottle. Pours pitch black with no discernable head. Lots of chocolate on the nose with hints of bourbon. Probably the best representation of chocolate in a stout that I have come across. Chocolate dominates the palate with hints of vanilla, bourbon, and dark fruit.  Full bodied mouthfeel that is bolstered by the utter lack of carbonation. Finishes slightly bitter, with a final flourish of chocolate. Overall, an extremely complex and layered stout that definately benefited from a year in the cellar."

"enough of the barrel aged stouts out there. this is a sort of shut up and sit down to the millions of wannabes out there. i absolutely love this one. its rich and frothy in looks, dense and dark, and with a nose that is just insane. toasted coconut, cocoa, vanilla, dry chalky grain, and a whiskey smoothness thats incredible. love that its under ten percent abv too, which is great, allows me to drink a bunch of this. a real cool nuttiness too, almond and hazelnut, lasting, and going brilliantly with the whiskey complexion. rich lathery feel, lasting forever in the finish, but not ever really getting all that heavy. this is my first and only beer ive ever had from these guys, and the hype is real, i mean, this thing is just insane. as layered as anything, its as close to as intensely flavored as the bruery big ones like black tuesday and its relatives. half the abv or less, but such a dynamic beer. chocolate in the finish, oaky, memorable. i want a mainline of this one. one of the few beers where its as good or better as the masses say. a must"

"Very smooth"

"O: This one exceeded my expectations. I love the honey addition, it goes really well with the chocolate and bourbon."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into tulips and shared.  A jet black beer with very little detectable head.  Aroma is of dark chocolate, roast malt and cherries.  Taste is a slightly tart cherry-chocolate followed by roasted malt and a little bit of coffee.  Mouthfeel is dense, viscous, and almost flat carbonation.  A huge sipper of a beer - much larger than its ABV would indicate.  Overall, an enjoyable dessert stout, but not one you'd drink the whole bomber by yourself."
""
""
"Tried this year's version last night and I gotta say it just may be a Top 10 beer for me.  The honey sweetens it just enough to let the bourbon barrel come through at the end and at 8.5% this thing is so very drinkable it's almost unbelievable.  Great beer."
"A sipping beer that will fill you up very fast.  Intense flavor."

"Look I'm not saying it's not a good beer - it's not but I'm not saying that. What I am saying is that who wants to have the bejeezus scared out of em every time they take a sip? Not me, that's who. That movie was really, really scary and it psychologically impacts the enjoyability of this beverage. Otherwise though, a well made beer."

"Bought a bomber of this while down in Chapel Hill for work. Heard it was good and sort of sought after around here. Poured jet black with a 1.5 inch dark brown head. Lots of boozy smell. Very sweet smelling. Reminds me of the smell of melting chocolate. Some mild fruit aromas as well. Very tasty. Lots of boozy bourbon flavor. More than most barrel aged beers. Lots of roasty sweet chocolate flavors. Slightly raisin and floral tastes. Pretty good. Very heavy though. I’m sitting in my hotel room by myself. Wish I had someone to share this with. Might be hard to get through."

"O: a nice barrel aged stout, but too sweet for me."
""
""
""
"Pours completely black, covered with densely creamy caramel colored foam. Rich bourbon-fueled aroma... fudgy chocolate, blackstrap molasses, maple syrup, nuts, cherries, creamy vanilla, and wood. Flavor is big and powerful, avoiding the sometimes overly boozy punch of stronger BA beers. Oaky vanilla Bourbon richness, honey, tobacco, and graham crackers all rolled into a smooth malty package. Medium-full body and creamy. A very nice, malty, sticky stout."
"Black beer, foamy dark brown head and nice patches of lace. Aroma is thick with leathery tobacco, dark chocolate fudge, blackstrap molasses, caramel liquor, cherries, and blueberries. Pretty fantastic. Flavor is loaded with massive amounts of chocolate, berries, bourbon, vanilla, and some orange sneaking in at the end. Sugary, sticky, alcoholic, but smooth and creamy. Very nice blankety thickness in texture. Smooth bitterness mixed with soft carbonation throughout. This is a pretty massive beer."
""
""
"O - This is truly unique and amazing. The honey rounds out the barrel amazingly well. The ABV hides and the chocolate and vanilla rise to the forefront. This is excellent."

"Pour is jet black motor oil with a small amount of dark mahogany head. Nose is quite nice, lots of rich malt and a lot of wood and bourbon notes. Strong fudge and caramel. Taste is a bit more woody up front, slightly chalky malt mid palate, rich fudge quality is a touch muted, some dark berries in back and bourbon through the finish. Full bodied, dry finish, soft feel, a touch slick in back, nicely carbonated."

"T: Opens with a sweet and syrupy wave of chocolate and raisin. Middle shows milk chocolate, just a touch of bourbon and fudge. Finish brings a touch of charred malt, light oak and more super sweet milk chocolate and raisin. For me, this was a bit much. Very sweet and syrupy, which can catch up to you in a hurry. I enjoyed it, but killing a whole bottle of this pretty much seals your fate as far as future diabetes is concerned."

"This is a fantastic beer to be sipped during contemplation or while reading. It could pair well with a cigar or ice cream. This beer elicits comforting memories of time with my Grandfather, sitting in leather chairs with book-clad walls, thick cigar smoke, a humidor, and his sculpted trout ashtray. I can only imagine the conversations we would have today, he with his bourbon and me with this thought-provoking beer. Thank you Rodney and Louise."

"Olde Hickory seems to have chosen an appropriate name for their big, barrel aged stout. There's no going back after the first drink, you're at the point of no return. Even handed barrel aging combined with a great base beer make for a match made in heaven. Do yourself a favor and get this beer. Thanks, Wil! Good chit, mang!"

"2013 Vintage. Poured into a snifter, the beer is jet black, like oil, with a chocolate brown head that sits dense and foamy on the surface. Beautiful. Aromas of rich molasses, old world fruit, roasted coffee, booze, raw honey, cream, vanilla, and woody highlights. Very heavy, layered nose. Flavors are rich and smooth, with an immediate blast of booze and warmth. Wow, this is a beast. Black strap molasses, cocoa nibs, cream, and booze all blend for the initial wave across the taste buds. You also get a solid measure of old world fruits, such as dates and raisins. Extremely dynamic. Wood and vanilla imparts can be picked up throughout, and the warmth continues to build. This is velvety smooth with every sip, although extremely heavy, as well, making you work for the enjoyment you are receiving. Nothing worth having comes for free. The aftertaste has a bit more bitterness to help balance, with more of the chocolate notes coming forward to balance all the rich sweetness, including the continued raw honey highlights. Very nice. The finish is smooth, with a slightly sweet linger that avoids cloying, and just begs you to continue drinking. Can't wait to see how this bad boy ages!"

"With a ton of bourbon flavor but little of the burn, The Event Horizon is fairly modest to be of ""Imperial"" strength. This subtleness allows the bourbon to stand out more because it has less stout to contend with. Still, the beer stands tall and wrangles the barrels for seamless taste."
""
""
"this beer was a real treat. sooo smooth and tasty. never had anything from this brewery and we were all very impressed. just a solid imperial stout that drank bigger than 8.5% would lead you to believe. definite sweetness to the beer, but very well balanced and had a good bourboun.oak character that evened things out. loved it"
""
""
""
"Pours a deep inky black with a medium chocolaty head that faded within 45 seconds into a medium collar and wisps at the surface. Aroma is dark chocolate, deeply roasted malt, some charred earth, some wine-like must. Taste is earthy and roasty at the front, some dark chocolate in the middle, and some wine must at the end. The honey really plays well in the aftertaste. Thick rich body and medium carbonation."
""

""
""
""
""
""

"Lots of fruity notes, no coffee or chocolate flavors to stay trendy. This beer is a statement. Wish I could say more, but you've got to try it. Sorry to hear the 2013 bottles aren't as good as previous years."

"Very surprised with this one. I was a little worried that the 8.5% would make this stout take a backseat to many of the other monster stouts out there, but The Event Horizon has very little short comings. Quite bold with amazing barrel characters, and the honey really helps provide a touch of sweetness to smooth out the beer. Very well worth the price point."

"Good googly moogly!!! This ale is straight up alcohol and I am surprised is isn't sold in the local ABC store on the shelf beside the Midnight Moon moonshine! Poured a dark black with minimal head, very much like a Barley Wine...In fact, a lot like a barley wine in the aftertaste! Interestingly enough, the ""honey"" really comes through the warmer it gets! Overall, ""The Event Horizon"" is an amazing brew worthy of a try!!"

"2012 vintage procured in a trade. Pours an inky black with a cocoa-colored head that dissipates into a thin band around the shoulders. Nose is quite reminiscent of BCBS - bourbon, chocolate, vanilla and ethanol. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of lactose. Less bourbon is present in the flavor profile than is expressed in the nose. Mouthfeel is medium-light and a little on the thin side for the style. Texture is creamy with a light, even carbonation throughout. Overall, a great beer that would be fantastic with just a little more to the body."

"O: This beer is really easy to drink compared to other bourbon barrel aged stouts because it doesn't feel too heavy and no alcohol is noticeable. Everything seems very well balanced."
"O: Overall this is a great beer - the bourbon barrel aging really enhances the overall flavors and aromas of this beer. There is a nice balance and the bourbon barrel aging adds to it but does not contribute much alcohol heat or alcohol presence in the nose/taste. Definitely glad I was able to grab one of these on my NC visit at Thanksgiving."

""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, char, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and bourbon flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that tastes much better than it smells in my opinion."

"O- I love this beer. The flavors are blended very nicely and are all delicious. It also has a huge amount of flavor for 8.5%, it's complex and tasty enough to sip at but I could happily have finished off a bomber of this on my own. I need more of this beer."

"There is a huge dark chocolate milkshake quality to this brew, which really does blur the lines a bit between beer, but it makes it super easy to drink. It may not be an ultimate favorite of mine, but it's easily one of the most memorable beers I've had in this style. I would have this again, but strangely it's un-beer like character is a bit of a turn off, and that's by far a minor fault if there is any with this brew to begin with."

"O - Solid fudgy beer with chocolate and honey sweetness. The honey adds a nice sweetness to the beer overall that is unique in a stout"
""
""

"Black with a quilt of mocha foam. Smell was evident as soon as I cracked the bottle. I don't know what barrels they used here, but I only have smelled this nose in PVW 20+ yr barrel aged beers. Minerals, nougat, vanilla, booze, cocoa, marzipan and honey in here. Really complex nose. Flavor is robust with sweet malts, some caramel, some fudge and some molasses. Again the honey is evident - which surprises me. Mineral character still there also. Full bodied with low carb and an off-dry finish. Nice beer, really the nose does it, the flavor doesn't do the olfactory justice."
"O: I like the bourbon characteristics were present, but not overly alcoholic in nature. Probably due to the low ABV. I'm glad the heat in the nose didn't transfer to the taste. Overall a very solid beer."
"Wow, what more can I say. I just picked one of these up really because their was a limit on how many you could get. Ended up being my favorite beer. At 8.5%, it is super smooth and extremely easy to drink. While I love the BCBS, the 15% can sometimes be overwhemling whereas Event Horizon's % is perfect. Small and great colored head, fantastic vanillia and bourbon smell and the taste is exactly what you want in a bourbon barreled stout. By far my favorite beer and would love to get some more!"
""
""
"O: This blew me away. One of the best I've had for this style and at the lower end of the spectrum for ABV. Seeking this one out."
""
""

"I had this one fresh and aged from the 2011 edition. This review reflects the aged edition of this one. It was poured into my favorite imperial pint glass and allowed to open up to the air for several minutes. The color was dark and murky just like a good stout should be. It had a slight red hue but overall a pretty good indication of what was ahead. The smell was so nice a slight sweetness but also had a richness to it. Also you could smell the bourbon in the beer which I love. I don't know how accurate the information I received was but I hear it was aged in used Pappy Van Winkle barrels, which is the big chief in bourbon these days. That information alone shows that these guys know there stuff when aging beer. The taste was thick and inviting with a sweetness but not cloying. You could definitely taste some dark plum, dried fruit, but also coffee, toffee and the honey playing a subtle role in all of it. The biggest and most impressive characteristic was the bourbon. You could definitely taste the bourbon and oh it was so grand, although this does have a good bit of alcohol it is balanced well with the more prevalent flavors incorporated in this very complex stout. I would rate this beer as one of the best ones I have ever had in its category and look forward to trying some of the 2012 editions as I have a few bottles being cellared as this is written. If you can get your hands on this beer, whatever edition you will not be dissatisfied."
"O: Amazingly good. The honey seemed to be buried under layers of flavor but i am not a big fan of honey so....worth the hype and wish I had more."
""

"Edit: After this beer warms, it becomes much creamier and chewier. I am really enjoying this one as it warms up. My scores represent the edited, warmed up version."

"Overall, this is a world-class beer in my book that hits on all cylinders. Highly recommended!"

"Overall. I knew I'd like this beer because I've been dreaming about Lindley Park since I tried it. This didn't disapoint with a ton of dark chocolate and a nice complimentary amount of smooth bourbon. Great stuff."

"The beer pours jet black with a dense, milk chocolatey colored head. The nose is potently bourbon barrelesque with a bit of underlying roastiness. However, the beer drinks quite smoothly with great harmony between the its sweet malt profile, bourbony vanilla, and roasted malts. I don't detect any alcohol in either the nose or taste. The mouthfeel is exceedingly decadent & rich with lingering barrel flavors and a touch of drying honey. This beer pushes the honey forward more than most stouts I've had with a honey addition. Overall this beer was quite tasty with huge barrel characteristics, a surprising amount of honey flavor, and a velvety mouthfeel."
"Overall, pretty nice brew but a bit overly carbonated."

"o - a (very) rich and decadent barrel aged stout that i enjoyed quite a bit. i especially like the fact that it's not a 12% or 14% monster so i can drink a little more of it, though finishing a whole bomber is a challenge due to it's sheer richness. i'd love to get my hands on another bottle or two to save for special occasions."

"O: Had high expectations and was a little disappointed. I feel I’ve had better bourbon barrel aged imperial stouts. But definitely unique, great bottle, got it in Asheville at Bruisin Ales, at a high price. My first from Old Hickory. Would go well with some smoked meat, but lots of flavour drunk slowly by itself."

"Overall, I was disappointed in this beer. I have had Olde Hickory's regular imperial stout and thought it was amazing, but this let me down. However, I would try this again and recommend others trying it as well."
"The Event Horizon pours jet black, and a careful pour yields almost three fingers of burnt caramel tinted foam that actually rises up past the rim of the glass, without spilling out over the side. Head retention is pretty good, but lacing is definitely a bit spotty. The nose is wonderful, with aromas of cocoa powder, oak, bourbon, brown sugar, and vanilla all wafting out of the glass. The flavor profile shifts and consolidates a little bit. The beer is definitely more oak and bourbon forward on my palate than in the aroma, and most of the vanilla is phased out and replaced by more brown sugar. Dark chocolate continues to provide a base for all of these characteristics to play off of. The mouthfeel is great, because while it still has that slightly chewy aspect to it, it feels a little bit less heavy (thanks to the honey?) than most big stouts, and as a result it comes across as a fair bit more drinkable. As with all great stouts, the carbonation is nice and muted. I found this super fresh bottle of The Event Horizon to be just a tad barrel forward for my taste. It's still a very good beer, but even just a little time to mellow and come together should yield spectacular results."

"Overall: Damn. This is a fantastic beer. Definitely one of the best North Carolina has to offer, and that's saying something these days. After tasting this I bought way too many. A couple for Christmas presents, a couple to stash away for a year, and a couple to enjoy now. Pick a few up while you can."
""
"All in all, A truly EPIC beer which lives up to the hype of being one of the best, if not , the best beer brewed in North Carolina. Definitely worth searching and definitely worth cellaring. Let it open and warm a bit for maximum enjoyment."

""
"O: This is a great example of what can be done with a barrel aged stout. I am very impressed. I'll have to see if I can get a couple bottles of this years release."
"Spent a day drinking this on cask during the Duckworths cask event last year. Didn't disappoint this year either. Thought I was maybe over praising last year, but two years in a row is the real deal. This is up there with Bourbon County for the non-coffee bourbon stout."
""
"O: 4.0 good beer with a lot of booze"
"Overall - This has to be one of my top three imperial stouts. I really enjoyed how balanced this beer is, despite its complexity. I'm glad I have several bottles of this, can't wait to see how it tastes over the years!"
""
"Sampled on tap at the Busy Bee in Raleigh. Basic appearance with black color and small head. But huge in aroma with loads of bourbon. flavor leads with bourbon but balanced with roasted malt and malt sweetness. Very interesting and only gets better as it warms."
"overall its better than bourbon county. and at 8.5% you dont pass out from 1 bomber, haha. so so good."

"This is a rich and complex beer that has a fantastic flavor profile. It has depth and character. It has perfect balance and showcases little subtleties throughout. This is definitely one of the better stouts that’s out there."

"O- This was a treat. It isn't the best BA stout I've ever had but it's certainly up there. I probably won't seek out more because I already have a bottle to age and that's all I need, but I would recommend trying this if you haven't. If this is the BA version of their Imperial Stout, the barrel aging process made a world of difference. Worth some hype."
""
""
"O: A very average barrel-aged stout. A bit too sweet for my taste, while simultaneously being heavy on bitter hops. Not one I'd seek again."
""
""
"An outstanding glass of beer."
"The mouthfeel is heavy and thick with lower carbonation. Overall I thought it was a great beer. The aroma was a little on the sweet side, although still really good. The flavors really came together the taste though. I was looking forward to finally trying this and it didn't disappoint at all."

"O: An excellent barrel aged IS. So creamy and chocolatey! It's sort of like drinking brownie batter or maybe chocolate cake. Sweet (but not overly so like some) and chocolately with a wonderful balance of complex flavors. Top notch example of the style, kind of like a slightly less harsh BCBS but with a little more chocolate. A must-have for the chocolate lover."

"Good beer. Not the best in this style but very well made!"

"Would love to get my hands on another bottle of the 2010!"
"D - really solid brew overall. This is one of the best barrel aged beers I have had in recent memory. Highly recommended!"

""
""
"O: Amazing. So complex, so viscous, yet easy to drink. Everything is very well integrated. Tons of chocolate, moderate bourbon, toffee, and malted milk balls."
""
"Overall: Really solid beer. I love my BA stouts and the addition of honey in this beer adds some really unique complexity to the nose of this beer. Love the fact that some breweries are trying to make a nice mellow stout instead of the in your face bourbon bombs. With thant said i could use just a touch more barrel notes in the taste of the beer. The nose and mouthfeel are my favorite aspects of this beer, but its a well integrated beer that melds flavors together."
""
"Overall, a really great bourbon barrel stout. I can't believe the ABV is as low as it is. The amount of flavor and the balance is incredible. Definitely worthy of its reputation and near the top of my favorite imperial stouts."
"Tasty bevy here. The aroma was great. Thanks to TATURBO for bringin this."

"Glad to have snagged a couple of these, one was definitely headed down my gullet."
"Smells sweet, tastes bitter. I think some age would do this a lot of good. Should have gotten 2!"

""
"O: Very good Imperial Stout, got a feeling that this will be gaining in popularity pretty quick, I think this beer will be a permawant for me"
""
""
"OVERALL: This is a more than solid, lower ABV barrel aged imperial stout. The flavors were very complex, with the barrel components and base beer working well together. This is a good example of the barrel complimenting the beer as opposed to dominating it. The rougher and slightly hot feel held it back a little, unfortunately. As a comparison, the 2010 vintage was perfectly smooth and showcased an even better balance between base beer and barrel. Decadent and impressive. Either this beer does great after a year, or the first bottling in 2010 was slightly superior. In the end, this is a solid beer worth tracking down, and I’d love to drink it again. Thanks again for the trades jbeatty and Stakem. Highly recommended."
"O: Overall a solid bourbon aged stout that I'm glad I had a chance to try , very well blended and balanced beer."
"O: Fairly tame in a very good way, just smooth chocolate with sweet bourbon hints. A nice well brewed stout to stand up to a little barrel aging. I hope I can get the chance to try this a little fresher."
""
"Fuller body, slightly milder carbonation, smooth and creamy, sticky and chewy while drinking. This is an easy stand out for me - I love the balance of flavor and somewhat aggressive barrel character. The addition of honey adds a nice dimension that you typically wouldn't see in some other barrel aged beers."
"This showed some moments of greatness but never quite got over the hump for me, as this retained a bit too much of a charred burn throughout that seemed to hold this back some and a complete melding of barrel and beer that occurred a little too late in my opinion. This is still a really nice BA Stout but I wouldn’t break the bank for it."
"Real glad to have had the chance to give this one a shot but I'm not overly impressed here. Simply a solid offering in a style that's flooded with great beers. Still worth a try for sure though."

"Overall, great beer for what it is, and that is why I rated it so. Not really my cup of tea as my palate has changed considerably, more into less filling brews right now. However, if you want a great BA IS, this one is calling your name."

"2011 Vintage. Poured from 750ml bottle into a tulip glass. Poured deep brown and black along with a well-retained medium dark beige head. The aroma picked up burnt molasses, honey, oak, earthy bourbon and some chocolatee came through on the next wave. The flavor opened with tangy oak, rich bourbon, and a blend of coffee and chocolates. The honey and molasses, which were detected from the aroma, really thickened up the core. Medium to thick-bodied. Really enjoyed this beer quite a bit! I will continue to look for more of this."
""
""
"Overall: This is a great BA Imperial Stout. Goes to show you don't need to have your stouts be 12%+ to be extremely good. I hope to get the chance to have this one again in the future."
"O - Awesome barrel aged stout. Very drinkable. Combines all of the flavors excellently. If you enjoy large stouts and barrel aged stouts, this is a must try."
""
"Overall – For a “lower” ABV stout, this is fantastic. This is no BCBS (or variation) or DL with crazy high ABV…but this has intense flavors. They have gotten this beer down. Well worth the hype. A just fantastic stout."
""
""
"Overall, this was a BIG TIME stout with a some serious kick. I dont know if I could really ask for anything else from this beer. I thought the honey gave the beer just the right amount of sweetness and I loved the big bourbon and oak characteristics. JR is knocking this tasting out of the park! THanks again!"
"O - really great brew, enjoyed quite a bit. Might make my top 10 stouts."
"Beer pours a dark brown/black with a thin tan head with moderate lacing. Smells of chocolate with some bourbon and oak. Taste follows the aroma - a nice mix of the three, but not overwhelmed by any of the flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this is a nice bourbon barrel stout, but there's nothing to make it stand out. I'm a little disappointed given the hype it's gotten."
"One smooth beast."

"2010 vintage, reviewed blind as part of Blind BIF 6. It pours a straight obsidian topped by a finger of golden brown foam (I can hear the Stranglers in the background now...). The nose comprises roasted malts, dark chocolate, molasses, sweet honey (really more of a vague sweetness, but I'm attributing it to the honey anyway), and a dusting of grass. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a touch of oak and an even lighter touch of mild bourbon. I thought I got a bit of coffee in there, too, but it could have been caused by the several cups of java circulating around me at this point in the evening. The body is a strong medium, bordering on heft, with a light moderate carbonation and a very lightly chewy feel. Overall, a very nice stout. I'm not sure it deserves a lot of the amazing press it gets, but it's definitely a tasty beverage."
""
""
"Pitch black hue, small mocha head. Some cascade action. Rich chocolate fudge, molasses, coffee, bourbon. Flavors are rich and full of chocolate gnash, coffee, bourbon. Full thick body. Mild carbonation. A very well done Imperial stout. Olde Hickory knows how to make em."
"overall: quality stout - one of the finer beers to come out of NC"

"O- Overall I had pretty high hopes for this one, and it definitely lived up to my expectations. The barrel aging is extremely well blended, and really enhances the beer all around. I recommend it highly, and look forward to some 2011."
"750 ml bottle. 2010 vintage. Thanks for sharing Phyllis. Pours a dark brown with small light chocolate head that has decent retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is chocolate, bourbon, some light oak and vanilla, as well as a bit of caramel. The taste is sweet dark chocolate, some bourbon, vanilla, and oak, and a bit of caramel. The finish is smooth with some light alcohol. Medium body. Medium-low carbonation. Fairly enjoyable, but not great. Comes off a little bit too sweet."
"O: Overall this is a home run of a barrel age stout that really is different than most BA stouts I've had. The nose is fantastic and this beer is very smooth for being do young."
"O - Although I find the flavor to be a little light for a BA RIS, this beer drinks so easily. It is also impressive that it is kept at 8.5% with this much bourbon in the aroma and flavor."
"It tastes and feels rich. There's an abundant sweetness: honey and chocolate and bourbon. It's like decadent, but nearly overwhelming. Has the beer been sitting in barrels since the last bottling? It's heavy like that. The feel teeters on cordial. I'm glad everybody's fired up about this one. I'd say it's the Carolinas Abyss! The honey adds sweetness you could counter is unnecessary, but it adds some smoothness that pulls it ahead of a BA Blackbeerd. Disclaimer: only had the BT, wish I could've tried the Beam variety. The Event Horizon is a legitimate bad ass!"

"Same keg, 45 days later. I get more barrel, but more specifically it feels like honey bourbon barrels. Very slick and smooth. Still highly rated. Cant wait to try with dakkon54 and the rest of the guys at Parrothead pub in April!"

"Overall this is a really enjoyably beer and highly drinkable for the style. Locally, i'd rate it a slight notch below BA Sexy Chocolate, a slight notch above ORF, and a good step above Igor and Silent Night. Get this one if you can."
"Thanks to Roger over at Bestway for giving me one of his personal stash,this is one f*cking amazing beer!Poured into a snifter ink black no light getting thru this beer,a thin deep mocha colored head atop.Where to start when it come to the aromas,chocolate fudge,roasted walnut,coffee roast,just lush and rich,to me perfection.Thick and chewey feel but also creamy.Oaky/bourbon flavors mixed with sweetish chocolate and deep roast,its just as rich as all get out.This is one NC. beer worth its high rating,damn I wish I would have been able to get over there to get more,hell yeah!"

"Bottle. Pours a dark brown/balck color with a dark tan head. Head collars around the glass. Very, very rich smell with notes of chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, brown sugar, and slight roast. Velvety medium mouthfeel, could be a little heavier for me. Starts sweet with molasses, brown sugar, that then goes to a rich chocolaty roasted flavor. The bourbon is well incorporated. Overall, I am really impressed with this one. Given all the hype and noise around this one, I was skeptical on if it woudl be good or not but it certainly lives up to the hype."
"O: Wish I had more. Thanks again Eric."
"Pours a deep space black with an incredibly frothy tan head that laced onto the glass beautifully. Smells of chocolatey goodness, vanilla, maple, honey, and bourbon. Taste brought out those same flavors, but the bourbon was a little more muted than in the nose. Reminded me much of a Founders Black Biscuit. Mouthfeel was very nice, though maybe just a tad less creamy than I'd have hoped for. But this is easily one of the best beers I've had this year. Holy smokes this was a frickin treat."
"3.5, 4, 4, 4, 4.5"
"O: Made to be shared but not at all oppressively heavy. Thanks again, Wil!"
"This was a nice experience. I had it after a GI BCB Rare so it's hard to compare."
"o - overall, what a night of great stouts. from olde hickory to rare to event horizon...really all worlds apart and all incredible quality. this beer is world class and another that is worth the hype. the honey adds an incredible dimension that makes an otherwise heavy heavy beer to be silky and light. really enjoyable and a must try for any big stout fan."
"O- I was really impressed with this beer. Really easy drinkability, each sip was rich and complex, really nice dessert beer."
"Overall, this beer was much better than I expected. It was very tasty. Easy to drink and enjoyable. Maybe a bit too roasty, but that's it."
"Obsidian black, spindly arcs of sticky tan lace inside the glass. Surface foam has a creamy texture to it. Aromas of sweet sticky molasses, vanilla, malted milk balls. Rich flavors of dark chocolate, tobacco, chickory, and chocolate covered dried cherries. Slightly woody and leathery, in a good way. Mild dark chocolate bitterness in the aftertaste. Super creamy with a milky feel to it. Long drawn out chocolatey finish. A smooth sipper, one to share. Thanks again Wil!"
"Drink- A very good stout. Has a ton going on and its a beer you had to focus on while drinking it. Layers abound and continue to evolve as it warms. Wouldnt mind a bottle of my own"
"Poured into a Bruery snifter with a group of about 8 at cellar temp from the wine fridge. Pours very dark, thick black with a small cocoa head. Looks good. The nose is sweet malts and dark fruit, bourbon, oak. Smells fine. Taste is that sweet malt, dark fruit, and very understated barrel character. One note until the finish. The finish is acrid burnt something and hops. Burnt honey and bittering hops? Whatever it is, the finish does not work for me at all. It's that same finish that is present in a lot of maple imperial stouts/black ales that does not work for me at all. Good body for the ABV, which was oddly low. We had a good lineup, but this bottle wasn't finished. Let me state that again. There were 8 people there and this bottle was not finished. Everyone else was defending that it was fine, but that is not exactly what my expectation was. In my opinion, this was very forgettable and in the opinion of my group, it was only slightly better. Choo-choo"
"Overall, Event Horizon is a smooth, cleaner version of most barrel-aged stouts. It doesn’t kick your ass and impresses with drinkability."
"Overall an interesting stout that defied the specs on a number of fronts. Lovely and smooth, it was amazing in the way that the smell continued to change throughout. The taste was a little downer and it was a big tasting beer, taking us 45 mins or more to share a bottle. The mouthfeel was very impressive. Some great parts and some parts that whilst not great, were still quite good."
"O-- A much bigger feeling stout than it really is. Big beer but easy to drink. Could use a bit more carbonation and more of a silky feel to it though, as it became very coffee acidic in the end. Quite unique as the hints of bourbon and Oak just toy with the senses. This was far more about malts than anything else. Worth trying."
"4.5 D: This is a very good beer, there's no doubt about that. I'm not a huge fan of stouts that use honey so I'm a little negatively biased against this brew, but I would have no problem trading for it again. That said, I'd say that the hype behind this is more than justified. If you like honey stouts, this is likely the best. Well done OH."
"O: this is a great beer. wish i had more."
"Saying this is an excellent beer doesn't seem strong enough. One of the top beers of '11 for me & an elite entrant into barrel-aged stouts. Simply wonderful."
"Overall: The flavors still haven't melted together seamlessly, which to me signifies that a little bit more time in the cellar will help out. Even so, this was smooth and delicious. Maybe due to the lighter than insane ABV, but it was not too boozy either."
"This brew packs a whallop. For less than 9% abv, it has an alcohol flavor that seems significantly more but it drinks smooth and more like something in the 6% range. It is full bodied, modestly carbonated and silky smooth in the feel that coats the mouth. Very solid brew here, excellent. I shared this growler with 2 other people and I could have easily drank the entire thing myself. It is very easy drinking."
"Overall: A splendid beer with multiple layers of flavor; the sourness worried me in the first few sips but it settled down as the beer aired out; I wonder how that element will affect the aging potential?"
"This is my favorite beer and can't wait til it's released again at the end of the year. IF you haven't tried this beer, do whatever you can to try it. It's worth the hype and some. This is the first time I've reviewed it on tap and it's worthy of all 5's, in my opinion."
"This is a delicious beer and I guess the delicate menage of malt, roast, barrel and bourbon is helped by the low ABV that really allows the individual ingredients to shine and not be masked by the high alcohol or residual sweetness. This definitely lives up to the hype."
"Pitch black in the glass with creamy tan mousse. Aroams of big roast and coffee, a slight boozines hides underneath. Flavor is bold and roasty, yet chocolatey and smooth. Very fine carbonation and rich creamy mouthfeel. Delightful overall, worth the hype it received."
"32oz growler. First taste of this much hyped beer and i wasn't let down a bit. For not having huge alcohol content, the mouthfeel on this one was excellent, it had great texture but didn't come off heavy handed one bit. I initially thought I would only be able to have a glass of this beast but it was so smooth I could have drank it all day. Nice cocoa flavors with a hint of coconut and bourbon on the finish. Not boozy at all and everything in its place, this one lived up to the hype for me."
"O- Maybe I hyped up this beer pre-drinking, but after sampling two bottles, one on DLD, and one the night before, this beer is a complete letdown."
"This was one of the beers i was really excited for when i saw it out, but it was a let down. I even gave it a 2nd chance the next day, and can't report any differant."
"O: Very pleased to have tried this beer. Fantastic stuff. In retrospect, I should have shared less and hoarded more."
"D. I really like this beer; possibly my favorite from NC (over BA Sexual Chocolate)."
"Pours a nice dark brown with a reddish tint to it. Very little head but well carbonated. Smells very chocolate heavy with some light oak. Vry rich on the nose. Tastes like bittersweet chocolate. Lots of rich thick malts. The bourbon characteristics are fairly subtle but definitely compliment the beer well. Overall very tasty"
"O-good brew. Close to worth or equal to the hype. Crazy drinkable and redonkulously smooth. Only knock is no head..."
"Thanks to Chad for bringing this one over, reviewed from notes. Poured into New Belgium globe, black with a mocha foamy head that fades to a collar, not a bad looking beer. Smells like bourbon, graham cracker, crusty bread, oak, lots of vanilla, slight alcohol. Interesting flavor, graham cracker crust, lots of sweet sugary malt, oak and barrel, vanilla, bourbon, slightly smokey, some bitterness, strange aftertaste sweet cherries. A strange off flavor that I cant pinpoint - maybe honey? Heavy body and light carbonation. Not bad but the strange off taste keeps me from wanting more of this one."
"Its a pretty heavy beer with good carbonation. The bitterness from the beer paired with the bourbon threw me off a bit. Overall I could pick a few dozen better barrel aged stouts, and this would not be one of them. Kind of let down, but still not a terrible beer at all."
"definitely worth the hype. one of the better brews I've had lately."
"The Event Horizon was a clear standout among many other ""big stouts"" at the tasting. Job well done, Olde Hickory. Hype warranted."
"Vigorous pour yields a slow pooling of brown head that eventually subsides to some major stickage on the glass. Pitch-black color. Madeira-soaked dried plums, vanilla, nougat, wood, dark chocolate and soft charcoal rush the nose ... very aromatic and mouthwatering. Slick package, fullish body unfolds slowly. More oak than vanilla-bourbon to start; lush maltiness turns roasty as quick as the oakiness pulls the palate. Light on the hops--or at least they mellowed out. Chocolate and sweetness fade quick. Slow drinking here, which helps to let the beer evolve. Very enjoyable."
"Bottled poured into my Narke tulip... A black body with faint notes of brown on the edges. The head is medium tan and rises about two full fingers before falling to a full finger cap. It fades quickly but decent lacing makes up for it... The aroma is exceedingly malty and sweet. Whopper malt, molasses, honey. Smells great, but it shouldn't smell like this, smells like a bw... The taste just isn't as successful, its very muted, lots of the sweetness of the nose is gone, and it brings out more roasty, bourbon, oak finish which is not present at all on the nose."
"D - Easily the most impressive beer I've had from NC/SC. Perhaps a little too sweet, but hey, very solid. Recommend!"
"Edit: Drank this beer again on 9/24/11 and adjusted my ratings. Drinking amazingly, smooth and easy with good flavors. Sweetness is still there but the roast is coming out more. We have a winner."
"All in all, a big standing ovation! OHB has really outdone themselves this time. This stout rivals Black Tuesday in the scent and is a perfect example of the style in the taste. The balance is incredible on this one. Definitely try one of these if you like stouts."
"There's more molasses than chocolate on the palate, along with a kick of licorice and bourbon. The mid-palate brings out more caramel and vanilla sweetness, but the finish is more tannic and dry with a kick of bitter charred malt. The beer is surprisingly viscous for the supposed 8.5% ABV."
"D: I could drink this all day long without hesitation. It's up there with bourbon barrel plead the fifth and rare BCS for the best and most drinkable bourbon barrel stout I've had."
"Overall, this beer was amazing. Nuff said."
"Overall: Excellent stuff. The bottle says it can age, but this is more than ready to drink now."
"Is The Even Horizon deserving of all the hype? Maybe not, but what beer is after it's been built up like so many are on this and other sites. Regardless, this is a terrific beer that I'm very happy that I had the opportunity to try. Thanks again Jon. Go Munster!"
"This is an excellent imp stout and really complex and flavorful given the relative low ABV. The honey really adds to the complexity and feel. Great stuff."
"Dear Olde Hickory, you guys blow at bottling. Waaay too much variation. This is a fantastic beer, but y'all North Carolina homies need to figure your shit out. Kthanxbye!"
"This has been the talk of the town around here recently, as it was an unexpectedly great offering from Olde Hickory. I can't say I'm disappointed, and I prefer this to any other North Carolina barrel-aged stouts, with the exception of one or two vintages of ORF. I love the dark cherry and toasted coconut notes, the bourbon is well-integrated, the fudge is luscious, and the body is mind-blowing. I wish I had more than this one bottle."
"Complex aroma with a good balance of hops, bourbon barrel ans honey. Hints of pine up front along with a prominent bourbon character. Hints of sweet spirit and oak as well as a healthy dose of vanilla in the nose. Viscous, chewy medium body that's on the full end with lots chocolate malt, a very prominent hop forward bitterness, oak, vanilla, honey and almost the perfect amount of bourbon. Mid-palate sweet chocolate malt, honey and licorice. I was expecting much more of a bourbon bomb but this beer is incredibly well balanced, complex and delicious. This is the best NC beer I have had to date."
"An amazingly bold flavors for a lower abv barrel aged imp. stout. Milk chocolate and rich malt coats your tongue. Finishes with high quality bitter dark chocolate and medium toasted oak. Bourbon doesn't push through very well but is rather soft and intertwined within the milk chocolate. I wouldn't mind it being more pronounced. This beer is so rich and silky and you could easily put back a few glasses. Hype warranted."
"Cheers..."
"Kudos to Olde Hickory for a great job on this beer, highly recommended."
"Beer is medium bodied, creamy on the mouth. Fills out nicely in the back half of the beer. The lead off here is the malt syrupy sweetness, not too sweet or cloying, just enough, the bourbon lets loose next giving some mild heat, not off putting but it is definitely aggressive, the back end is bitter with the roast with a nice finish, the swallow allows the flavor to rediffuse through the palate leaving you wanting another drink. It's a good beer, not the best barrel aged stout I've had but it's up there. Thanks."
"Sampled at Sexual Chocolate 2011. Pours a deep black color with a thick brownish white head and a small amount of lacing. Smells of sweet chocolate and coffee. Tastes of coffee, chocolate, toffee, and some roasted malts. No hops anywhere. Mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is low. I don't care for it."
"This beer is black with a thin, beige head that leaves some good lacing on the glass. The aroma brings roasted malt, bourbon, honey, chocolate, and oak. The taste is fabulous - a wonderful barrel-aged imperial stout. Additional flavors of coffee and vanilla add to an already complex and awesome beer. Super smooth and creamy feel, with alcohol presence well disguised. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Highly recommended."
"A says serve with tuna tartare."
"Thanks to kkipple for a taste of this."
"D - Still trying to figure out how I feel about this one. It starts off like a Belgian Quad, but finishes like an Imperial Stout. The alcohol is noticable in flashes as you sip the beer, but at 8.5%, this is a one and done for sure. I think some age would do this beer well. Hopefully some of the overt sweetness will fade out. Glad I have another bottle of this, look forawrd to tasting it again in a few years."
"O - a homerun. I will want more."
"Center pour gets you three fingers of extremely dark brown foam, the top comprised of larger, thin-skinned bubbles, hence dissolves at a swift pace, does leave thick, messy slabs of lacing behind and the final layer across the surface has staying power. About the blackest pour you will ever see shoot out of a beer bottle, this said when logically black is just black and does not admit of gradients. Naturally, fully opaque. The nose is like a chocolate factory on fire, all roasted and toasted cocoa, mocha, caramel, coffee ice cream, butterscotch and even a suggestion of chicory, all this with a good dose of pine and orange zest blended in, the booziness gives the fruit scents a plum, raisin, cherry cast, dessert-like, otherwise too monolithic for much else to enunciate clearly. Full-bodied for sure, dry and powdery in texture, you can feel it cake up on the tongue, the oak wood evident in many different manners. So much chocolate and cocoa that it's kind of embarrassing to mention other components, the caramel, butterscotch and honey a distant second. Rum raisin, alcohol drenched poached plum, cherry to pear fruit. Lower pine here, more dried herbal and grass matter, tree bark. The grill smoke adds a helpful sour dimension. Underneath the intentional ""black star"" density is a fairly complex beer trying to get out. If it had more flow and ""give"" it would be highly notable within its category."
"Quite thick and full bodied with a near batter like consistency. Drank like the old bowl of cake batter my mom used to give us while baking. My glass disappeared in a hurry, and while it may have been in part to the Bears early ineptitude, I believe the beer deserves most of the credit."
"We couldn't wait longer (can't believe cellaring would substantially improve this, but I'd like to find out); HUGE thanks to Metalmonk! More???"
"Drinkability:This is a wonderful chocolate beer that's smooth and really well balanced. There's not much age on this beer, but it's already amazing, and I can only imagine how this one will age."
"D- This is probably the best Imperial Stout I have had so far, perhaps even one of the best beers I have ever had, if not the best. Not for the timid or weak but this beer is simply spectacular. Props to Old Hickory, and please make more of this."
"expectations and is really amazing. Please drink this fresh to enjoy it at it's fullest potential."
"Well this is about the best brew I've had from North Carolina, period. It even just eclipses Sexual Chocolate, the regular and barrel-aged version. Hey, 21 reviews and lowest score so far is 4.25? Believe it!"
"NOTE: I'm pretty sure the 8.5% ABV can't be correct. The base beer is listed at 10.2%!! However, if it really is only 8.5% it sure packs in a lot of flavor and heft, while still maintaining fairly well-hidden alcohol."
"Drinkability: I tried to show up to Duckworth's in time to try this on tap alongside Mother Earth's Silent Night. This one had kicked by the time I arrived so I was only able to try the Silent Night, but I was fortunate enough to grab this one in a bottle, at which time I was assured it was the superior beer. Now that I've had both, I have to agree. Particularly if you like ""light"" RISs, this one is for you - fruity, lighter, with plenty of barrel character but not an overwhelming (or even prominent) amount of bourbon. To make this beer perfect, I'd leave it in either fresher barrels, or - if these were first cut barrels - for twice as long, as well as amp up the underlying base malts, giving it a little more body and grain character. Sure, it'll probably take the abv up from 8.5% (where it was extraordinarily manageable, by the way) to something a little more intense, but that'd be a fair trade off to bring this beer a little closer to perfection. As it stands, it's an excellent beer, worth seeking out, but stands a little beneath North Carolina's best -bal RIS (Olde Rabbit's Foot, BA Sexy Choc) and some of the great -bal RISs out there (Abyss, Black Note). Nonetheless, worth seeking out."
"d - I thought this was a great barrel aged stout and very drinkable. I loved the bourbon and oak in the smell and taste and didn't feel it overpowered the rest of the flavors; it was pretty balanced. Would love to try this one again."
"The beer is well carbonated and has a nice heavy body, fitting for the style. I would have guessed that this beer would be 11-12% based on the nose and taste, so I am surprised to see that it's only 8.5%. The alcohol is a bit overbearing, it's a sipper but it's good. This beer was a welcome surprise, glad I got to try it."
"The correct answer is ""D". Class dismissed!"
"Opaque in color with a nice creamy beige colored head. Head lasted until the glass was empty and left soapsuds lacing. Very rich and intense aromas of dark chocolate, vanilla, espresso and burbon. All very balanced and working together as a cohesive unit. The flavor is very intense without being too much. This beer walks that fine line perfectly. The flavor is a mixture of dark chocolate, espresso, roasted oats and grains, and burbon. Thick, creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Man I wish this one wasn't so limited because I'd love to stock my cellar up with this one."
"Overall just outstanding, again not a bad word to be said here."
"Cheers to OH Brewery. A well done RIS. Grab as many bottles as you can (only 976 released) and cellar."
"Really this is a terrific beer that will only get better as it ages. Mellow and quite drinkable for an 8.5% ABV Impy Stout. Just a little sweeter than I would typically like, but overall a great beer."
"Overall: This beer is a gem! For such a limited release this beer could sell for twice its price. One of the best barrel-aged beers from Olde Hickory yet. For being so young out of the barrels, this beer is deceptively smooth. I wish I could drink this beer in one ounce sips per night over the course of a winter."
"Drinkability: This was a highlight of the night beer for me (thanks habmike!). Such a great beer, it is clear they set out to make an excellent brew and not some enormous monster."
"The mouthfeel is one of the best parts of this beer. Very rich and velvety smooth, everything a imperial stout should be and more. The carbonation is spot on. Not a hint of any alcohol and this goes down very smooth. Olde Hickory is one of my favorite breweries in NC and this beer did not dissapoint. Nice Job."
"The taste picks up right where the nose left off and is buoyed even more by the excellent mouthfeel, which is thick and really lifts the flavors of this one. Love the espresso notes coming out of this. Full and thick feel coats my mouth and finishes smoothly with just a bit of slight booze, which was welcome on this cold morning. Drinkability is quite good as well. I've been nothing but impressed with Olde Hickory thus far and I'd love to try some more things from them."
"D: I would gladly sip this beer all night. There are very few imperial stouts that leave me wanting more after my bomber is empty."
"Served from bottle that was split with JackTheBear at Duckworth's after picking some of these up at the store into a goblet. Poured pitch black with a half finger tan head that subsided quickly to a minimal amount. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, chocolate, and honey. The flavor was of sweet malt, slightly roasted malt, slight alcohol, caramel, dark chocolate, and honey. It had a heavy feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this brew amazed me. For this to be a relatively fresh BA brew it is very mellowed out to begin with. Olde Hickory says on the bottle that this one will stand up to aging and get better with time. I don't see how that is possible as this thing is drinking awesome right now. If this is true, some people are going to be in for a treat in a year or two. The flavor on this one is one of the most complex I have gotten from an BA stout to-date. Everything blended together very nicely and in unison. Damn good nose on this one as well. Only 1000 bottles and limited kegs, but if you get a chance to get some of this, DO IT! You won't regret it."
"Excellent mouthfeel as this completely coats and warms the palate. Silky smooth. Soft finish. The bourbon quality complements this beer excellently, but is not in-your-face at all. Lots of roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, mild cold coffee, honey, and hints of vanilla tannins. And only 8.50%, are you kidding me?! This was such a treat. I could sip this one all day. Best thing OHB has ever put out. For those that enjoy the big boozy BBA Stouts, this may not be your favorite, but I loved it."
"Smooth and creamy in the mouth and goes down oh so smooth. Very rich and complex for an 8.5% stout. It has just the right amount of warmth without being boozy and I could definitely have a bomber of this on my own. Rivals some of the better bourbon aged stouts I've tasted."
"Overall this is an amazingly solid brew. Hopefully this will become an annual release!"
