"Bomber per Al's Whiskey Lounge in Syracuse, NY. It SMELLS a lot like Ten Fidy, but it tastes much spicier, specifically on the back end. Retains a nice 1cm layer of head. Wow—if you're a stout guy like I am, don't pass up this one."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours thick and black with a short mocha head. Big chocolate character in the nose, sweet and milky backed by plenty of other spices (cinnimon, alspice, and maybe some chili).  The taste is very well balanced!  Up-front is the grain bill, big sweet and roasty, lots of chocoloate and coffee, then comes the spice at just the right balance and is followed/finished with the chilis on the finish with just enough heat to let you they are there. I admit I am not usually a big chili stout lover, but this one is realy well done."

"O: Wonderful balance of flavors. Amazing stout. Can't wait to drink another one of these."
""
""
""
""
"Perfect chocolate and pepper flavors."
""
""
""
""
"Incredible!  Exactly what you'd picture a Mexican cake tasting like."
"Too hot. Heartburn issues. Hid the alcohol well."
"Still good, but no cinnamon and spice"
"Wow."
"O.  I love this beer.  One of the best Stouts i've ever had.  I will look for this again!"
""

"Overall (4.25), a very good take on the sub-style, but not one that I'm likely to expend a great deal of effort to have again because it just doesn't quite get that spice overload that I personally enjoy. Chocolate and cinnamon are a great flavor marriage, because the chocolate sweetness tends to transform the cinnamon from being a dry, mildly interesting flavor to a rich, spice melange, sort of the way salt can amp up the flavors in so many foods."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It finishes with burning hot, peppery chilies, acting as the perfect addition to the rich chocolate taste, challenging the tastebuds, as this beer is evolving in taste from the beginning till its very end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I love how the pepper just hits the back of your palate as the smooth chocolate taste covers the top of your tongue.  I think this is the perfect beer, its just a shame that it is so difficult to get if you are not in distribution range."

"#600! Love this brew as I picked it for 600! What a fantastic beer! Nice chocolate notes with a bit of heat...not much, just enough! Outstanding brew that is more then worthy of hunting down! Congrats Westbrook on this fantastic beer!"
"I'f the scale would have 10, I would gone to 11. Lol. It was a full chocolate head. Enough spices with a good amount of habanero chile. Cheers"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2014. Opal, coffee foam but not super oily. Tons of dough and bittersweet choc, cinnamon. Litely chewy and bittersweet. Yum"
""
"I wanted to rate this higher, i really did, but I have to be honest. I think it was the combo of cinnamon and habaneros, or maybe i had it at this weird in-between stage (bottled 5/14, drank basically 1/15) but i didnt love it like I thought I would.  The beer is gorgeous looking, even the smell was great, picked up a good bit of cocoa, but the taste....was sort of a mess. Ive been drinking a bunch of FBS, Backwoods, and BCBS lately, and this just didnt live up."
""
""
""
"O: Very good beer."
""
""
""
"This is an amazing beer, no doubt, but, for me, at least as of this round of bottles, Abraxas blew past it. Maybe the next round will make me flip my scores, we'll see."

"If the cinnamon was a bit less, I would go to 4.5"

"I was surprised how good this was for the style. Big upfront cinnamon flavor that mellows into a smooth vanilla taste with a decent amount of pepper burn at the end. Impressed!"

"Very fun stout to try.  I knew it was aged on peppers but underestimated the ""heat"" that was present.  Good, drinkable mouthfeel with a nice blend of cocoa, vanilla and peppers.  The peppers started present and then flexed their muscles as it warmed.  I recommend sharing the bottle (as I did) or having some Pepto available."

""
""
""

"O: One hell of a beer. It's pretty much as it's described. A proper stoneground mexican chocolate tends to be grainy, bittersweet and oftentimes has some sort of cinnamon and/or chili pepper spice. This is liquid mexican chocolate. Great flavors and balance, great complexity, great strength. Just works nicely. Barrel aging this would probably put it over the top but this is great as-is."

"Worth the hype. Spicy, Chocolate, thick, delicious beer."
"From the first mouthful I was hooked, a delicious sweet chocolately wash comes over the tongue, and by the time I let it get to the back of the mouth, there was the slight burn from the pepper and roasted malts. Some vanilla and dried fruit tones on the tongue. Over the 30-40 minutes I took getting through this one, the heat gradually grew in the back of the mouth, while the to tongue kept the sweet tones of milk & chocolate. Damn fine beer indeed."

"O: I had very low expectations for this beer based on all of the hype surrounding it. But I have to be honest, I was blown away by this one. Its a damn good stout and I will be searching out another bottle or two."
""
""
""
""
""

"So many of these beers now it seems. The local Dallas take on this, Mole Temptress, is just as good to me."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this had much more heat than expected, especially on the linger. It worked well with the other flavors though. Really liked the chocolaty fudge icing flavor as well. Compared to Hunaphu, this one is hotter and more chocolaty, Hunaphu has more emphasis on the other spices. Slight edge in flavor to Hunaphu, but overall this was a unique beer that I really enjoyed"

"Overall, this is definitely my favorite of the handful of chili-pepper stouts I've had - it has the exactly perfect amount of roast, smoke, sweetness, bitterness, and spiciness, and they all compliment each other really well. Really, really great."
""
""
""
""
"I was much more impressed with this second Mexican Cake experience. Last year I didn’t quite get the hype for whatever reason, but this is an excellent stout that takes all of the adjunct elements and melds them together beautifully to create a big and malty – yet surprisingly easy drinking – imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This one was pretty good, but not up to the level of the other big stouts in this category."
""
""
"Cheers!"

"O: This one is worth the hype and worth seeking out. This is my first Westbrook beer, and has established them as a brewery I will seek more offerings from... this is a total knockout!"

"I had two of these at a bar (Lancero Lounge - Newberry, SC) and It was absolutely a amazing and wonderful experience. The smell was sweet with hints of Nutmeg, and Cinnamon. Initially you taste the sweet Nutmeg and Cinnamon. Then it finishes with a slight heat which all together is AMAZING."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is an absolutely spectacular beer, perhaps the best imperial stout I've ever drank, up there with Oskar Blues's Ten FIDY or Great Divide's Yeti. It really does taste like you're drinking some sort of spicy cake. Also, I am not a fan of spicy food, but I loved this beer, so anyone who likewise prefers mild food should not be turned away simply by the habanero peppers. Great Divide's Chocolate Oak-Aged Yeti is somewhat similar, but this is far spicier and more explosive. I would highly, highly recommend this to anyone."
""
""
""
""
"O: This makes me feel like the fat kid in Matilda who had to eat the whole chocolate cake. I drank this whole btl with pleasure."

"2014 bomber in trade from Homer321. Thanks buddy! Pours pitch black and viscous with a super creamy one finger mocha head that sticks around a good bit. Aroma of chocolate and roast with light spices and a definite cinnamon note. Flavor is big chocolate notes, more roast than others in the style, with beautiful use of cinnamon and vanilla. Chili pepper heat is subtle just like it should be. Nice heavy mouthfeel but not near syrupy, with medium to lower carbonation (right on for the style). Man this is good. Better than Bomb, not as good as Hunahpu 2014, and maybe better than Abraxas. Now to get my hands on the Apple Brandy version!"
""

""

"O: Would I trade for it again? Probably not. It is unique, especially with the spice factor. B+"
""
""
""

"Oh, and I liked this better than bomb! hunahpu, and Abraxas for sure."

"This is easily one of my favorite beers ever and beats the other spicy stouts like Huna, Bomb!, and Abraxas."

"As good as advertised. Had this on-tap at Barley's in Greenville. Pours black as pitch with a coffee and cream head. Lovely aromas of chiles, vanilla and cinnamon with some roasty notes in the background. Really excellent taste- enough spice to heat things up and give you a constant tingle, but not enough to hit you over the head and make things unpleasant (like Stone's Crime and Punishment). Also, since the heat comes from habaneros , you get a nice fruitiness from the peppers that blends well with the cinammon, vanilla, coffee, and chocolate notes. Really nice. Not as deeply flavored as Huanapu, nor as much body, but there is a silkiness in the finish that's nice. Very well done."

"All the components shine through and do not drown each other out. Just missing the pure intensity of flavor of a huna"

"Pours a dark brown with a creamy tan head. Decent lacing. Aroma of dark chocolate, light chili. Lots of dark roast malt with light hoppy notes. Dark chocolate, burnt roast on the palate with a spicy chili finish. Full bodied with light carbonation. Overall a very smooth sipper with great chocolate and chili heat."

"O: A fantastic beer. I recently enjoyed my first Prairie Artisan/Evil Twin ""Bible Belt"" and was interested to compare the two. Mexican Cake both brings more pepper heat, and also has a sweeter side. Both beers are great, but I'm really loving this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I think this beer is fantastic on its own, and with the prominence of habaneros, I don't see the point of barrel aging it in bourbon or whatever barrels (though I'd be interested to see what red wine would do). Regardless, I think this is a fantastic beer and I'm happy I got to try it."
""

"O: Fantastic stout. I wasn't sure that I would enjoy this one since the spices can easily take away from the rest of the experience, but this is a world class spicy stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"Would definitely drink this beer again given the chance, however I think that's unlikely considering how lucky I was to get a single bottle."
""
""
""
"O: Fantastic! Probably the best chili beer I have ever had; perfect balance between malt and heat and is not dominated by either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just had the 2014 release. I was a bit concerned about the habanero-pepper aging. But no worries. The vanilla and cocoa nibs tones it down completely, so all you're left with is just a hint of the peppers. Very unique. Almost had the taste and aftertaste of a milk stout. Thoroughly enjoyable beer - too bad it's only once a year. What a fantastic beer!!"
""
"Bottled 5-22-14. Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer pours jet black, with a filmy, slick, dark tan head. Nose of bitter chocolate, chili heat, tobacco, vanilla, and spicy wood. Flavors are bitter dark chocolate and cocoa nib, with a subtle pepper build of spice and heat, with vanilla highlights. Smooth, dry body that supports the dry and spicy palate perfectly. Bittersweet chocolate and subtle pepper aftertaste, with a dry, smooth finish. Awesome beer!"

"Mouthfeel has a lot going on too. In fact my wife actually tried it and said the same thing ""boy that has a lot going on."" Full bodied with a nice lingering flavor. Moderate carbonation level that is smooth with a nice dry, earthy, bitter and slightly hot finish. The heat from the habenaros almost provide a bourbon barrel like heat, but not quite. Crazy drinkablility, I expected to be sipping on this all night, but I'm about 2/3's of the way through and haven't even started dinner yet. I know I should have shared this, but it really can be consumed by one's self if they are a beer/stout lover. Love to try this one again, great beer. Thanks Paschal for an awesome trade, you're the man!!"

"Westbrook does a great job with this one. The chilis are a perfect finish and complement to the richness of the malts and chocolate. Very complex. Stouts are my favorite style so I have tried a lot of them and this one is definitely one of the top 5 I have tried. If you see it buy it"
""
""
""
""

""
""

"Overall: A solid beer that I'm glad I got to try...I definitely need to get a fresh one the next time around. I've heard people say that the peppers drop out with age, and this bottle is almost a year old, but there is definite heat at the end that doesn't go unnoticed."

"2013 bottle from Hop City in Atlanta. Pours a pitch black with milk chocolate head that held pretty well. Medium collar and fair lacing. Aroma is deeply roasted malt, slight spice, slight vanilla. Taste has a warmth from the habenero, very dark earthy-sweet malt, slight vanilla. Rich body and mouthfeel, low carbonation."

"3/7/2013 bottle. Black, brown gray head. roasty, bitter chocolate, semi sweet, some cinnamon and licorice. Spicy/hot after taste which I personally do not approve of. First sips are great, but the spice takes over and masks flavor for me after a while, for me a huge minus."

"Overall, a homerun."
"Pour is motor oil with tight mocha head. Nose is light chocolate fudge and vanilla, roasted malt, and faint soy sauce and spice. Taste has a ton of spice to it, a bit richer in a good way. Some fudge notes, light vanilla. Some roasted malts mid palate with the spice taking over in the back and lingering on a long finish. Full body, thins in back, smooth and creamy feel. The beer is decent but it's super spicy so it's hard to really drink, not sure how much I can handle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Mexican Cake is a solid spiced stout, but just a million miles away from the perfection that is the JD BA version. I think Westbrook shouldn’t bottle the regular version and simply stick it all in JD barrels!"

""
""
""
""

"Excellent, all the components meld nicely. Quite spicy up front."

"This beer backs up the cool name and the kick ass label. This beer stayed true to the cake part of the name. It was just as thick and chocolatey as a well made slice of chocolate cake. The pepper at the finish line was a very nice touch. Would I drink it again? I sure would! I would also very much like to try a barrel aged version of this. Thanks to mnbuffalo for hooking me up with this treat."

"I enjoyed this beer from a stone snifter last night. It poured black with a head that was a lighter tint than what I expected. The smell gave away the roast, vanilla, cocoa nibs and even a hint of spice. The taste was fantastic though. All previous smells that I stated were prevolent in the taste, plus a huge amount of habanero peppers. Overall it's one of the best beers I've ever had and would trade for it again in a heart beat!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - In the same realm as Hunahpu, but still not quite as balanced. I'd like to do a side by side. and I'd also like to try a barrel aged version.."
""
""

"O: What an incredible beer! The flavor takes on a new shape as it warms up. I kept expecting the pepper to over power but it never did. Worth seeking out for sure!"

"2013 Release poured into a Brawley's snifter and allowed to warm up considerably, but shy of room temperature. Third time this year cracking open a bomber of the best milk stout on the market! The spice at the end is almost superfluous, but it's the thought that counts. Right? It can actually generate some heat after a few pints. Definitely more heat than the Great Divide's excellent Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti. Overall, excellent appearance, taste, mouth feel, nose, if it were a year-round release it would definitely usurp my favorite offerings by Founders and Great Divide."

"Quite tasty, and even though I enjoy spice and chiles, I wish the habanero was dialed down just a slight bit. Regardless, I'm very much enjoying my glass of this, but the pepper should be complementary instead of dominant."
""
""
""
""
"Not necessarily a blend you expect it's creamy chocolate with a spicy kick. The spice is not overwhelming or deterring but acts as a compliment to strong creamy chocolate tones. I don't taste the actual peppers but I can find hints of cinnamon spiciness. The feel is not hot or burning but is present. This is amongst the best versions of a habenero brewed beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Its a bit thinner but does the pepper spiciness very well. I didn't get much cinnamon or vanilla here, unfortunately. I would have to put it like this: Abraxas is heavy on the cinnamon, Hunahpu is a very thick chocolate fudge beer, and Mexican Cake is spicy chocolate cake. They're all awesome and Mexican Cake holds up well to the other Mexican-style stouts."

"This is easily the best spicy stout I've ever come across. The body is astounding and really just makes the rest of the experience. Flavors exhibit nice complexity and the nose and look are deep and inviting but the body is what holds everything together here. An excellent beer!"

"Overall an exceptional stout that you should seek out."

"Can't go wrong with this brew, and if discussing Westbrook with a newbie, this is the one I'd point to in order to display their ingenuity, creativity and the complexity they can achieve in a beer."

"O - Nose is hitting me in the face from 18"" away! Hot pepper finish is so lovely!!- just barley tweeks the throat - wow. Mouth is very frothy and full - excellent. Bitter dark chocolate rounds everything out. Very very good. 10.5 ABV hidden so so well. highly recommended."
"O: Peppers and chocolate! What else do you need. This is a fantastic combination that I have enjoyed. At first the mouthfeel caught me off guard with the assertive spice and heat. I knew what was in it but didn't expect the heat to show up so much. I gotta say this is a spectacular offering from Westbrook. Cheers!"

"22oz bottle. 2013 Edition. Big thanks go to Stakem for the share on this. Pours black with a frothy dark mocha head. Retains well, leaving rich and robust ringing along the sides of the glass. The aroma smells like chocolate cake, coffee, cinnamon sticks and chilies, with a smidge of green citrus and vanilla sweetness thrown in. I’m liking this. The taste is pretty similar. Baker’s chocolate, dense roasted coffee, a firm citric bitterness, slight alcohol sweetness, a touch of vanilla which bonds to the chocolate and finally, spices throughout, which really heat up the finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a lively and sharp feel to the carbonation. The alcohol here does a little stinging in spots and it working with the peppers comes on a bit strong at times on the palate. While I found the first release of this to be an overall smoother beer, this latest go-around still has a lot to offer with plenty of rich flavors and a spicy kick! This is well worth seeking out."
""
""
"O: Really an exceptional imperial stout. I've never had a beer with as much habanero kick as this one, but that's a good thing especially with how well it melds with all the other flavors. Very easy to drink for a 10.5% imperial stout. The only reservation is the price at $13.49 for a 22 oz. bomber. Well worth it at least once, though"

"This was a great beer from my home state of South Carolina and seems to be popular for trades as well. The heat from the habanero peppers was perfect on this creating a complex tasting stout that couldn't be mistaken for anything else. You don't feel the heat from the peppers until a few seconds after it washes down and your mouth has already been coated with those classic imperial stout characteristics. I highly recommend trying this beer and I hope to pick up some of the barrel aged versions of this as well. Cheers!"
""
"Wasn't sure what I'd think about the spicy end of this beer as I'm a 'mild wings' kind of guy....But wow! What an an amazing beer! Poured half the bomber and felt I'd have to save the other half til tomorrow. But besides the fact that I have a drinking problem, this was just too damn good to save til tomorrow. Grab one of these and drink it now or tomorrow, but drink it."

"Overall this is a very good beer that, despite the label, I think could use some time. Right now the peppers are so dominant that I can barely peek under the heat shield to discern a few of the other flavors. I'm going to sit on my other bottle for six months & I'll wager it's going to be in the excellent range once the chiles calm a bit."
""
"O: This is an epic imperial stout that I would put right up in the upper echelon. I would love to age a few bottles, but the label says to drink it fresh, so I guess I better get to it!!."

"A very good chocolate pepper brew. Some smoke would be excellent with this beer."

"O - Not quite Hunahpu but this is a standout beer. If I couldn't score the whale from CCB I would certainly settle on this. First offering from Westbrook and this would make me curious of their other beers."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is smooth in the feel yet spicy and complex. This was an enjoyable sipper but admittedly, I think the spice got to me before the alcohol did. That would be my only gripe about this beer, while chiliheads im sure scream for more, I would prefer it tamed back a bit to increase its overall drinkability. Regardless, this is an enjoyable brew that is worth seeking out. I wouldnt mind having it again sometime."
""
""
""
"Overall: habanero comes a little on the finish, but its a nice touch, light on the cinnamon, big chocolate, no noticeable alcohol..drinkable like whoa!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: you have to try this, assuming you enjoy that chili pepper heat in a stout - super dense, rich, and delightful - its one of those beers that, if you can get your hands on to try, you do."
"Poured into a Westbrook goblet. Thick and viscous, opaque black, with a well-retaining half-inch cap of mocha head that left a few streaks of lacing on the glass when swirled. That's what I like to see. Aroma was a bit muted at first, but came out more as the beer warmed a bit, as expected. Dark roasty malts, cocoa, coffee, not much of the other elements of the beer, though again, the peppery spice was more apparent as the beer warmed. In the taste, earthy cocoa, dark chocolate and roasty dark malts up front, with the habaneros making themselves quite obvious mid-palate, a strong, spicy sensation prickling the taste buds, roasty aftertaste with a bit of coffee, and just a hint of vegetal vanilla bean; didn't get any cinnamon whatsoever. About halfway through the beer, the palate adjusted and the pepper heat mellowed quite a bit, turning this into quite a nice sipper. I'd say the body was nearly full, mouthfeel was pretty smooth for a habanero beer. Overall quite good. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a gem and despite the bottle saying don't age I picked up 4 so I might keep one to see how it tastes with a year or two on it in the cellar. I would seek this beer out and buy it any time I see it."
""
"Mexican Cake finishes with a sweet, resounding aftertaste full of nuttiness, vanilla, heavy fudge, a touch of cinnamon, and some tingling pepper presence. The viscous and thick body is just shy of chewy, but feels good for a stout; medium carbonation. I was hesitant to try this because with this list of ingredients, things could easily have gone awry. Luckily the execution was great, and the beer was really quite tasty."

" Had the first batch of this and loved it but i guess those notes haven't been added yet so reviewing the newest batch that i found locally. Enjoyed from a westbrook snifter. brew poured a rather stunning rich thick black. generous phone meet and head that was gone relatively quick leaving patches of mocha bubbles and its wake. smells like a Mexican cake chocolate vanilla Peppers great sweetness on the nose is perfectly complemented with cinnamon. taste is complex. this beer can easily hang with hunah. everything is in its right place. body is fairly full but you would expect that from a stout this size. the peppers make it feel lighter and the cinnamon tames down the peppers. make no mistake though there is some spicey heat on the finish. definitely worth a shot for any fans of hunah."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good but not great beer, not in the ballpark of some other beers in this vein."
"O-World-class. It's an annual summer release so if you see it, buy it. It's up there with the other imperials. Plus, it's very unique."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of my favorite non-BA Imperial Stouts. The label says to drink fresh and I don't think I can disagree with that. Aging this beer runs you the risk of severely muting one of the flavors that brings the contrasting re-freshness of this beer. Would love to have again, but happy that I had the chance to get this now."
"Overall this brew was interesting and is pretty delicious. Quite intense pepper notes compared to other ""spicy"" stouts I've had. Body is not as thick as I would like. Other than that solid brew."
"O: A touch more body would have been great, but overall this is a really nice beer. The ABV is well hidden and it's pretty balanced. It's still not in the realm of Abraxas or Hunahpu, but it's still a great beer that I'd gladly have again."
"This beer was an absolute pleasure! So complex, so rewarding. The flavors are expertly layered in so you can taste them all. The finish is long and wonderful with the spiciness coming on at the end. The more you drink the warmer you feel from the spice. Next year I will purchase an entire case of this wonderful beverage! There are so many beers out there that are trying to make ""gimmick"" beers with all sorts of odd ingredients, but this beer is a symphony of taste."
""
""
"o - incredible stout and the mix of sweet and spicy goes really well together. i've had this beer several times over the last week on draught and this was the first bottle. it's even more balanced from the first on draught and the mouthfeel is top notch too."

""

"This poured out as a very thick looking black color with a very dense brown head on top. The retention is long lasting and the lacing is pretty impressive also. The smell of the beer is chocolaty and roasted, not much pepper on there nose though. The taste is very rich, it's very roasted and had a good amount of chocolate in there. The vanilla is hidden and the peppers come out subtly in the finish. The mouthfeel is oily, very thick and smooth. There is a light carbonation to it this also. Overall it's a very good beer, well worth the time and money in my opinion to get this one."
"this mexican cake is pretty great. its an imperial stout and pour opaque, just like i like my stouts. the head is a nice chocolate brown. the smell is sweet and spicy. the taste is chocolate which a slight burn at the back end due to the habenero peppers and the 10.5% abv. this is a great beer and i will look forward to picking up every year when the release a batch. i also look forward to other beer from westbrook- they seem to get better and better."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - So every beer like this begs the Hunahpu comparison. This one is a different focus. More of the habanero pepper and cinnamon. Less blended, but really nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Didn't disappoint. Perfect mouthfeel, really nice taste, perfect amount of habenero (which is so key). Otherwise tastes like a delicious chocolate/vanilla/oak stout (my favorite). I'd love to try this without the habeneros as well - I'm sure this is better, but that would be pretty damn good too!"
"O: Heat from the peppers more distinct than I recall from the anniversary release, resulting in an even more complex version than the original. Rich chocolate nearly on par with ST Chocolat, but with a perfect pepper heat. This beer changes so much depending on the temperature it is served at. Peppers come out once it warms to mid/high 50's. All around wonderfully complex beer that is surprisingly drinkable; I used this as a test ground for observing how temperature can transform a beer."
""
""
""

"Overall not bad, decent characters, nice pepper and chocolate, bit of soy though."

"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with higher carbonation, which doesn't fit the style well for me. Overall, it was an interesting beer to try but a tough one to drink more then a sample of. The overdone sugary sweetness and the higher carbonation really took away from some of the really nice underlying flavors in it for me unfortunately. Given all the other positive reviews it makes me wonder if this was just an off bottle or something. I'd love to try it again sometime to see."
"O - Solid spicy chocolate beer with a little less spicy but more balanced than Huna"
"O - Good flavors and heat, delicous."

""
""
"Although it's Westbrook's birthday, I feel like I had gotten a gift in being able to try this luscious ale. The only thing that's missing is the candle."
""
""
"OVERALL: What a ride. This beer is all over the map. The look sucks and the nose doesn't know what the score is, but the flavor is excellent and very complex. I would love to see this bottled again with the cinnemon a little more restrained and the look cleaned up. As it is now, a this is a fun beer well worth checking out. Cheers again claaark13!"
"I'm glad I had the opportunity to try this beer. I really like the peppers."
""
"O- My first offering I've tried from Westbrook, but it definitely left a great impression. Literally what you would expect from a chocolate Mexican Cake. Not as good as Hunahpu, but definitely up there and did not disappoint even though the two were drank back to back. I would definitely like to revisit this one and would even consider trying to trade for it. If you like chocolate, I would definitely recommend this beer."
""
""
"O – This beer is awesome. If you took away the “Mexican” kick, it would still be a good stout. The cinnamon and peppers only make it that much better and more unique. This has all the usual notes of a well-done stout plus more. Another job very well done by Westbrook. I’m so pumped that I got to try this one, and I hope they decide to brew it again."
"Much like a real cake, Mexican cake should probably be enjoyed by a few other appreciators of fine baked (brewed) goods. Also much like a real cake, the fat, fat, fatty feeling of consuming a whole Mexican Cake can feel pretty damn good."
""
"Cheers..."

"A fantastic example of creativity in the American craft brewing scene. More please!"

"O: Worth the hype for me.  I loved this offering.  I'm so glad a keg popped up at a growler station, completely out of the blue.  I'll definitely be seeking this out if it is brewed again.  Very unique, and just plain delicious.  I love Westbrook more and more with each beer of theres that I try.  Cheers to you guys for a job well done.  "
"(lightly tweeked, mainly confirmed, with on-tap tasting of 2013 vintage in July 2013)"
"Overall: A very interesting and memorable beer. A little too sour and alcohol dominant but still very much worth experiencing."
"D - Very nicely done, though the draft version that I had a few months ago was more enjoyable and complex. This works well but seems to have soured just a touch and lost the best of what it was when first brewed."
""
""
"Pours dark, motor-oil black with a dense mocha head that fades to a slight haze and soapy ring. Big aromas of chocolate, cinnamon, and vanilla, along with dark roasted malt and a touch of chilies. Decadent as hell. Oh man...flavors of chocolate syrup, dark malt, cinnamon, and vanilla beans are so intense, and yet this is so drinkable. Rich chocolate completely envelops the palate, and the heat from the peppers builds gradually until you have a nice tingly sensation on your lips. Mouthfeel is creamy and a bit chewy, with a full body and fairly low carbonation. Great dessert beer. Overall an amazing Westbrook offering, I can wait to try the barrel-aged versions I've seen in his barrel room ;)"
""
""
"*from notes (6-16-12)"

""
"Slight stout tartness that puts me off in almost every stout I drink, but there's a good presence of roast. Medium body, full carbonation. It's certainly a well made, above average imperial stout. However, I don't get the hype behind this one. Or I just had my hate on this particular evening."

""
""
""
"Brewed as a limited release to celebrate Westbrook Brewing's first anniversary. Poured from bomber into tulip glass. Pours espresso black along with a beautiful and huge head. Very nice lacing that lasts throughout. Aromas of sweet cocoa nibs, vanilla, cinnamon, and pepper. Picked up chocolate, cocoa, vanilla, and definitely can taste the habanero peppers! Unfortunately, I am not a big fan of chile/peppers in my beers so that took a hit in my ratings. Thick and creamy mouthfeel! If not for the peppers, this would have been an amazing beer for me. But I have to take account for the name, ""Mexican Cake"". Nicely done for that specific style."
"Pours dark brown, near black with a large tan head. Well carbonated with a retentive head and light lace. Nose isn't very well balanced, alternate whiffs bring forward chocolate, peppers, cinnamon, vanilla, and roast; generally sweet and a little spice. Light bodied, slightly thin, with same flavor profile as nose, but predominantly spicy and chocolately. This and the Farmhouse IPA are my favorite Westbrook beers I've tried. If this was on the shelf in 4 packs locally I'd pick this up, but wouldn't actively seek it out."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, like the others, I just didn't care for this beer that much. It's closer to Huna in quality than Chocolate Sombrero. If you like chocolate chili stouts, check this out. I won't be again."
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt, cocoa, and some subtle chile aromas. Taste is the same but the chile presence is very subtle flavor-wise. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good stout but nothing all that special in my opinion."
""
"D - Solid brew - reminds me a little bit of Abraxas but isn't quite as intense, although they have similarly well-disguised booze. Worth checking out if you like chile pepper stouts."
""
"Beer is light in body and sweet with this nice brown sugar and spice flavor that carries through to the end, the body is nice but perhaps a little thin, overall an interesting beer and I enjoy it."
"o - Overall I thought this was a really good stout. Some nice pepper in the nose, and sweet chocolate in the taste which I loved. Great body and easy to drink as well. Would definitely pick this one up if I saw it on the shelf, and by far the best of the four Westbrook beers we tasted. A good non-BA stout."
""
"This was a really nice beer I was glad to finally try. Thanks, Dan."
"O: Really nice beer. It's hotter in the back end than I remember. The spice really likes to stick around. It's a solid beer with tons of flavor, but I don't know if I'd want to drink a ton of this beer in the future. It's good, but once is enough for me."
""
"Westbrook Brewing Co. has a really nice beer in Mexican Cake. It’s very flavorful and impressive. The only qualm I really have is that there isn’t much of a spicy presence. I’m not getting anything that strongly suggests cinnamon or habanero pepper. Perhaps that’s a good thing. It sure is a fine tasting beer. Find some if you can. Thanks a ton, Dan!"
"very happy to try this beer. It's got a very intense nose with tremendous spice and a lot of stout goodness. The alcohol is hidden very will in this beer from nose to finish. Lots of spice carries through to the taste, more than expected with such a strong base. This is a very drinkable stout and pushes the style to it's limits with the habenero and cinnamon."
""
"The beer is dark brown, nearing black, with a quarter inch of oily, beige head. The aroma offers roast, cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla. The flavor brings notes of Kahlua, booze, chocolate, burned roasted malt. Nice flavor, but I like the aroma even better. Even without the title, I definitely get notes of flan. Sweet, but not too. Overall, very enjoyable. I would definitely have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the top 2-3 beers I've tasted. Feels like an imperial stout should - rich and full-bodied, but very complex in it's taste. The spice finish is perfectly executed. It's dessert all by itself. Made me want to start writing about beer. I hope all of you get to try this beer"
"O: A very solid imperial stout, great mouthful and flavors for a non-barrel aged beer."
""
"Served from tap into a sampler shaker. Poured pitch black with a one finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, habanero, dark chocolate, and spices. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, spices, wood, and subtle habanero. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation, almost creamy. Overall this was a very good brew. Somehow this monster was quite easy to drink. All of the flavors and aromas were quite complex and hit on all cylinders with the proper intensities. The pepper heat was very nice on this one on the followthrough and definitely built the heat similar to the pepper. One of my favorites to come out of Westbrook so far!"
"Overall: This is a really unique beer and another extraordinary ale from Westbrook"
"O - A really solid beer. Really glad I got to have this once. It may not have been fair to put it up against rHunahpu, which I absolutely love. But it did stand out in a few areas."
"Pours a dark black with a nice tan head and pretty solid lacing. Smell is pretty interesting, an interesting combo of chocolate, roast and chilis. Taste is really impressive, the chilis and the roast of the stout come together quite nicely, very chocolatey and tasty. Mouthfeel is full bodied with nice carbonatiom. Overall this is a great beer, but drinking it next to Hunahpu's it just isn't quite on the same level. A well done beer."
""
"Decadent flavor profile. Licorice comes up first then the peppers. Sweet rich milk chocolate and sweet malt. This is like a sweet non ashy/tar version of hunahpu's. The chile heat comes out more as it warms. Thick-ish mouthfeel. Really nice beer. I would like to see some -bals in this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow! I should have bought alot more of this. A very well crafted and complex stout that goes down easily. This is my first experience with Westbrook Brewing- I'll have to keep an eye on them to see what their future brings. If you like big stouts, this one is worth a try. I'm really looking forward to seeing how this developes over the next 12-18 months. "

"Overall a great beer. Strong but well-woven flavors. I had not previously heard of this brewery, but would love to try more stuff from them."

"Score adjusted accordingly. Quite enjoyable this go around. Go find you some."
"O: Not your typical stout, that's for sure, but bold, unusual and certainly worth a try."
"This definetely isn't going to be a beer everyone thinks is world class, yet."

"After drinking this beer I am sad that I didn't pick up any of the 22oz bottles that were for sale. What a great beer, I really hope this makes in to the regular rotation for Westbrook or at least comes out every year for their anniversary."

""
""
""
"I wouldn't drink more than 1 throughout an evening, but I cannot think of a better way to end a nice time with friends. It was much better than the Cigar City Hunahpu's we compared it to."
""
"The habaneros somewhat overwhelm the spices and chocolate in the nose (although a healthy roastiness is quite pleasant). Tasty stuff, though. The habaneros kick into high gear in the finish; before that, the cinnamon, vanilla and cocoa nibs are quite potent. Velvety, chocolatey and plenty roasty. Espresso shows up in the aftertaste after the peppers finally calm down. I'm digging this stuff. I'm curious about how it would age, but it's pretty damned good now, and I suspect drinking it fresh may be the best way to enjoy the the pepper presence. Kinda reminds me of a Mexican twist on a pecan pie I made a while back."
"- One of the highlights of the year and one of the best I've had. Ever.- It's that good"
