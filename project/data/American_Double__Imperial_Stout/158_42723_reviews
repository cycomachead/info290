review_text
"Overall: A really great stout; the type to drink as a treat. Not available where I typically drink and buy beer, but if I saw it in any liquor store, I'd buy it again. Definitely on par with Founders Breakfast Stout if comparing to a pillar of coffee stout style."
"On tap at Great Divide. Also, this is the nitro version. Excellent beer. Sweet cocoa flavor with lost of espresso taste. Bought a bottle to take home. My guess is I’ll like the non-nitro version even more."
""
""
"Some medium chocolate & vanilla espresso on the nose, but it has more of a roasted coffee flavor. Not quite as rich or creamy as you might think given the namesake.  You can certainly get fragments of the espresso as well chocolate mocha, but most of it is the roasted coffee, not that it is a bad thing.  It has a smooth feel & finishes pretty easy."

"O- I like coffee. So, I love this beer. One of the most coffee forward stouts I've tried. Nice ""in your face"" stout. Recommended if you like coffee."
"One of my favorite coffee stouts and and would put it right next tho FBS. I cant find to much wrong with this one."

"Tastes like regular Yeti to me. I am not really picking up on the oak or the coffee. Not as good as I was hoping."

"Great mouth feel, smooth and bubbly at the same time.  Chocolate first then some coffee, not very boozy untill the last minute.  Just great all the way through.  Very enjoyable."

"Overall: Iv loved every yeti iv had to date, so im not suprised i enjoyed this one so much. This may be the best in the series. I rated the regular oak aged Yeti higher, but thats because it was aged a few years and was less bitter. Enormous espresso aromas and flavors. The oak character adds a very nice complexity to it. This is underrated if you ask me, and would be up there with Breakfast stout if the aftertaste lingered longer."
""
"Good God this was good, the espresso comes through really strong and it looks and tastes beautiful"
""
""
"Holy crap this beer was a mouthful. I'm a hophead and don't drink coffee but I did like this one. Burnt coffee/non-sweet chocolate aroma and flavor start to finish. Coffee really sets in strongly after but maybe very noticeable for me because I don't drink coffee.  Not much sweetness and any hops is hard to pull out. Very creamy mouthfeel. Wow 5 minutes later coffee flavor still lingers strongly. This was very good and I look forward to comparing with others."
""
"The taste is great with lots of espresso up front with light vanilla type quality and slight hop flavor which adds a pine-like taste in the dark cocoa covered espresso bean flavor with mild dark toasted malt flavor supporting with cocoa and coffee quality and slight woody flavor comes through in the finish. Overall one of the better stouts made with espresso available  -I would drink this repeatedly if it weren't for the 9.5% ABV level."

"On nitro at the brewery in Denver. One of the best looking beers I've ever seen. Perfect thick light brown head, approximately 1.5 in. Feels and tastes a little too milky for me, but an excellent stout nonetheless."
""
"Pours pitch black with a dense, lingering, oak colored head. Smell is dates, dried dark fruit, lightly toasted coffee and slight hop bitterness. Taste hits with bitter, almost burnt roasted coffee. Mouthfeel is less smooth and oily than other aged stouts but is not unpleasant. Overall very nice especially if you enjoy the pungent, bitter and earth flavors of coffee and oak."
"Overall: An amazing coffee stout that blows the regular out of the water. My general comparison for coffee stouts is FBS and never had a stout outdone that one like this one has. Wish I would have picked up another bottle."
""
"A very good stout. Highly recommend it!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I really love this beer and enjoy it every time I have it. You definitely need to like coffee to fully enjoy and appreciate how good this one is. It's a little unbalanced towards the bitter espresso, but that's what I love about it."

"Glass- Imperial Nonic"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nearly pitch-perfect imperial stout. It pours a beautiful, pitch-black, ruby-tinged hue with a creamy brown head that makes the beer resemble a cappuccino. The aroma is redolent with espresso and vanilla. The taste is a bit bracing -- bitter espresso, heavily roasted malt, and a surprising level of hop flavor. Still, the vanilla from the oak lends a bit of smoothness. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than expected; Imperials tend to be more viscous, but the oak aging probably took a bit away from that. Regardless, really nice, aggressive Imperial Stout. Almost as wonderful as Stone's Espresso Imperial Russian Stout from 2013."
""
""
""
"This is a Delicious stout. Big coffee notes! Chocolate, roasted malts.. World class"
"From 22oz bomber into nonic pint glass. Opaque with thin head. Boozy sweet nose with coffee, vanilla, and oak notes. Strong coffee flavors with mellow red fruits on the palate with nice lingering bitter finish."
"The bitter coffee is strong with this one. Guess the name fits. Just like sipping an alcoholic espresso. Similar feel too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If you like dark chocolate, black coffee, and alcohol, this beer is for you."
""
""
""
""
""
"Black, or perhaps almost black, with a very dark, brown head. Smell has lots of chocolate and coffee. Smooth taste, with some (not altogether surprising) bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. Solid and well-balanced for the style."
""
""
""
"Had this on nitro tap, wow, this was amazing. Deep coffee black with big and bold tan head. Aroma hits hard of coffee. Taste is incredible with espresso coffee pounding you from the get go. Hints of chocolate are also present but take a back seat to the coffee. No notice of the oak aging IMO, but this beer does not let you down. Sip by Sip, this beer continued to amaze !!!!!!!"
"This beer is absolutely amazing. Every variant of yeti I have had has been perfect. This would have gotten a solid 5 if the smell was a bit stronger."

"Bottle.  Looks great.  Very dark rich brown.  Espresso/coffee are more present than chocolate, but thus the name!  I could have done with a little less bitterness, but a very nice stout!"

"O - 4.5 - Really awesome imperial stout. Definitely focused on the coffee, but not to a palate tiring extent. Would make a fine breakfast food pairing brew, but also works great as a warming, slow sipper. I tried this beer fresh since it is easily obtainable locally for, to determine if I want to buy another to let age. Yes! Definitely buy a second one to let age, has a decently noticeable hop profile that will surely fade with age and make the malt much more deep and robust. Highly recommend to fans of the style!"
"A little more coffee than I prefer. But a very good beer."
""
""
"From the look and aroma I thought I was about to chew espresso beans. My thought was wrong. In my opinion the taste was perfectly balanced with chocolate, coffee and stouty goodness. No need to age this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Espresso Oak Aged Yeti pours a black color with a huge long lasting lacing tan head.  There is a a chocolate espresso aroma with hints of oak.  The taste is so creamy, nice chocolate notes, big oatmeal base, creamy espresso mixes in perfectly with the hints of oak.  Big flavor, good body, very creamy.  Overall a top beer.  Big complex flavors, very creamy, its excellent."

"Cannot find anything wrong with this beer.  I will be consuming much more in the future.  On par with Sump from Perennial(only a little booze taste is the difference) in my opinion.  With greater availability this guy is a winner."

"O: 4 I was expecting a bit more from this beer. Regular Yeti is great, but the addition of the espresso is not as balanced as other coffee stouts and there is little to no oak presence."
"Overall - fantastic beer, though the price point will likely lead me to other options."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the better Yetis I've tried. The espresso definitely provides a rich depth of flavor and character, and the oak - while comparatively subtle - brings along nice notes. My personal take is that the Yeti series is too hop-forward, but with everything else going on in this beer, that provides a wonderful balance and bite to what otherwise might be too rich."

"Picked this up from a great trade with Evan! Pitch black pour with a beautiful two finger caramel-colored head with great retention and crazy lacing. Huge roasty coffee nose with hints of dark chocolate, espresso, cocoa, coffee grounds, vanilla, and subtle oak. The taste is bold and flavorful with the roasty espresso front and center. Hints of dark chocolate, cocoa, leather, coffee, vanilla, booze, bitter hops, and a ton of oak as it warms. The mouthfeel is thick, creamy, and mouth coating with medium carbonation and a dry, bitter finish. Overall, this is a bold and flavorful beer that you don't have to sell your sister to get."

"All of the aged Yetis have been a little disappointing. The original is still the best incarnation. The chocolate aged is decent, but lacks the depth you would expect from the extra care and premium price. The 20th Anniversary is pretty good for a Belgian/Northern French style ale."

"22oz bomber poured into a snifter. First glance shows a very nice brownish tinted black color and thick khaki colored head that stays till the end; even though reduced only to a layer of carbonation bubbles by that point. Roast, maybe some ash, and of course the coffee dominate the nose. The espresso coffee is extremely upfront and noticeable on the taste buds mixing with roast and smokey ash as it finishes. Smooth, slick mouthfeel and quite easy to drink is what this brew has to offer. In the end, as a chocolate stout lover, I found the coffee too strong for my liking but I still really enjoyed indulging in this stout. So glad I found and had the chance to try it!"

"Pours pitch black with a very dark brown head, all bubbly and frothy. Concentrated espresso in the aroma. Taste has the harshness of oak aging but coffee flavors do a good job of keeping it in check. Lots of deep & dark bittersweet chocolate thrown in for good measure."
""
""
"O- Good coffee RIS; the oak is a bit too strong in this one for me but there is a nice bit of complexity with the expected RIS flavour profile and coffee."

""

"O- Awesome stout. Im a fan of expresso/coffee stouts and this one definitely goes near the top of my list. I also like the fact that its usually not too hard to find near me. I will continue to go after this one for as long as GD puts them out there. Thank you for an excellent drink."

"This puppy pours pitch black and up to a good finger of creamy, chocolate brown head and falls to a persistent collar leaving behind curtains of lace. The nose is big and robust and loaded with coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa nibs with a massive dark roasted malt backbone. The flavor follows suit and features rich malts (dark and roasted), espresso, dark chocolate, vanilla and finishes with hints of tannins from the oak. The body is big with just the right amount of carbonation lending a full, rich, meaty mouthfeel. Overall, this is an excellent beer and for $10 off the shelf, no waiting in long lines for one 12oz bottle, no crazy trading, this is a steal!"

"This offering also has the hoppiness of a black ale. However, the lingering bitterness appears to come more from the roast than the hops."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Great flavor, but a disappointing mouthfeel. Not sure if the addition of espresso caused the weak body or what, because I don't recall the regular Oak Aged Yeti being this thin and lifeless. I don't know that I'd buy it again; just too many great impys out there for a better price."

"The look and aroma of this brew are off the chart. However, the flavor falls off a bit in my opinion. The dominant herbal and menthol notes seem somewhat out of place here."
""
""

"O-Near perfection beer. My only qualms are the appearance and feel. A slightly bigger head could be present even if it is a stout. All the glorious pictures of Espresso Yeti are a freeze-frame in time. The head will flatten quickly in time ticking reality, almost as quick as your done pouring. I dunno. Maybe other pours will prove different. And the feel, the carbonation is subdued. A below average range. Thank goodness the body is creamy and flavorful to where it sips like a stout-spiked mocha-coffee. So one isn't all bent out of shape about carbonation. And there is a persistent slight sizzle that keeps the beer from being flat. Kudos. Mind you, the look and feel are still better than most beers. Espresso Yeti is Heaven On Earth if not Actual Heaven."

"Overall this was an awesome experience. Does Great Divide do a non-awesome Yeti? They nailed this one and brought forth a beer that lives up to the name and flavor of this brew. Nice warm weather beer....or hell....anytime. Hopefully the distro will somehow find it's way to the always-slighted East Bay."

"Poured into a snifter, big two finger fluffy dark brown head. Very dark, opaque brown color. Coffee, chocolate and dark roasty malt aromas. Great coffee, vanilla, and slight chocolate flavors. Thick, creamy mouthfeel. Outstanding brew!"
"O: Fantastic beer, no one aspect dominates. Balanced and extremely well crafted imperial stout."
"Poured a black body with one finger than head that left minor lace patches down the glass. The aroma is roasted and coffee malts, the espresso aspect being noticeable, and there seems to be a hint of the oak/woodiness and even vanilla. I get this same aspect in the beer as it is medium bodied, slightly chewy, and smooth with oak notes and a minor vanilla like sweetness. The coffee taste is strong and really noticeable on the backend and finish as this beer finishes real dry. I like the balance and how this beer first hits me with a sweet edge and then finishes dry and just tempts you to have another sip."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a roasty, roasty stout with just enough sweetness to balance it out. There doesn't seem to be a huge oak presence, but I guess it may have served to soften the edges and meld the bold flavors. A great barrel aged impy stout, though not the best."

"Beautiful stout, dark brown head that lingered for a while. Straight up black coffee smells and flavors, very bitter for a stout in a very nice way. Couldn't decide if it was too bitter at first, but couldn't stop drinking it! Super thick, almost syrupy, which I loved."

"O-Overall a great coffee stout. Has a nice touch with the oak. They should make a six pack with all the Yeti."
"This wasn't like a Russian Imperial Stout when it came to the ABV but I would have preferred this to be just a hair weaker. It felt quite roasted and the espresso didn't thin this beer out enough to make it feel completely true to form. While not a bad choice, this wasn't an improvement over the other Yeti's that Great Divide offered and after a while, I got the impression that variations on a theme are only worth it if they augment the original in some way. Coffee and caffeine addicts may get something out of this but for me, this was only worth a go one time around. Just a bit too generic for some that came across as being different from the pack."
""
""
""
"What a pleasant surprise this Yeti sighting was. Among the best stouts I've had, and I hope we cross paths again soon. If you enjoy the rich fullness of espresso and dark chocolate as much as me, and you spot this beast, I can't recommend it highly enough."
""
""
"On tap at McNellie's OKC. Pours a dark brown with a foamy brown head that doesn't last terribly long. Moderate lacing. Smells of chocolate, coffee and malt with a bit of fruit. Tastes of chocolate, coffee, plums and raisin. Definitely has a woody character compared to the original Yeti. The fruit and alcohol become more apparent as it warms a bit. Definitely a bit of bitter in this one. Medium mouth that oils the tongue. This is nice, but I personally prefer the original a bit more."

"O- Amazing Imperial Stout. Quite session able despite it's first appearance. One of the top BA coffee beers I've tried. At $10 a bomber, I think it's a great deal."
"Wow this was a great 32 growler this weekend and much better than the one bottle I had last year. Poured into my 8 oz stout glass produced big mocha head with tons of chocolate up front, vanilla notes in the middle and the coffee notes on the finish. Poured tighter into my 4 oz taster and or 5 oz snifter opened with huge coffee, with the vanilla and chocolate finish. So either way I enjoyed both and this is a chocolate coffee bomb. Terrific mouthfeel, this 32 dissapeared in no time at all. Overall outstanding."
""
""
"O-delicious stout, bold flavors and nice feel"
""
"Had from a 22oz bottle. It pours a dark brown, black color, with a very dark brown head. It has a strong espresso nose along with some malts and strong alcohol presence. It has a strong espresso taste, with some vanilla, roasted malts, and strong alcohol taste. It is full bodied and dry finish. Overall a great beer. Great divide does such a good job with their Yet's. I wish they would bring the Oatmeal Yeti back."

"So, not quite a fair fight but Denver won the beer battle off, but I didn't have a better Seattle beer on hand for it, or NY beer either (that I wanted to drink right now at least), so not sure what that predicts, but atm on my DVRed version Seattle is winning by 5 (really a Safety to start the game?!)"
""

"Overall - My least favorite of the Yeti series, besides infected bottles of BA Yeti. Leaves a dry bitter coffee flavor without the rich components I'd like to get from it."

""
""
""
""
""
"O-It's hard to go wrong with any variety of Yeti, but this has to be my favorite by far. A great, balanced espresso flavor that doesn't leave an overly intense bitterness in your mouth makes this another stand-out from Great Divide."
""

"O - Excellent, but more oak flavors would put bump this badboy up a few points."

"tastes very sophisticated,light for an oak aged stout but not in a bad way well planned out and wonderfully executed I daresay this beer could challenge BCBCS don't pass this up if you see it on tap or at a store. This beer is is a wonderful treat. Cheers!"

"Pours a dark brown or black color, with nice mocha colored head. Very thick consistency. Smells llike coffee and syrupy malt. It tastes the way it smells: strong coffee presence and malty sweetness. Delicious beer that goes down easy."

"O- This beer was really fantastic. I loved every bit of it and cannot wait to have it again. It is one o those imperial stouts that you have to try if you are a fan of the style."

"After having the yeti chocolate last night I was excited to try this version. Overall quite similar and both very good. Pours black with a velvet mocha head that leaves nice dark lace on the lace on the glass. Has a sweet milk chocolate smell to it that has burnt caramel and coffee notes. Taste very similar, upfront sweetness with a great smooth yet slightly bitter coffee notes in the back. Great consistecy and easily a beer i'd buy again"

"O: An awesome beer, and for a great price. I already had their oak aged IS and trusted them with the barrels, and in this one they proved that they also know how to balance easy-to-oversell flavors like coffee. Very palate-pleasing, great look and feel, and dark enough to put hair on your chest without tasting its bitterness for hours afterwards. Try it with breakfast!"
""
"Bottled in January 2012. Totally black in color. Poured with a thick, milk chocolate colored foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap that left random sticky lacings on the glass. Sweet, mellow vanilla, dark roasted malt, rich, dark chocolate and freshly ground coffee aromas. Rich, thick, smooth feel. Dark, roasted malt and sweet chocolate flavors up front with hop bitterness on the edges. Flavors mellow through the middle as chocolate and vanilla flavors take over. Finishes with dark roasted coffee and malt flavors with vanilla beneath and hop bitterness on the edges. Incredibly smooth and mellow flavor and feel."

"O: For a big beer like this one (high ABV), the alcohol is extremely well hidden and that makes it easier to drink then some of the others in the style (DIS). Nice flavors of coffee/espresso that are very complementary to the flavors and aroma of the beer without overpowering or dominating it. Really an enjoyable world class beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The feel is still big, thick, rich and robust in a full body, though it goes slightly dryer this time. A bit of char going into the finish gives it something only very slightly astringent in the otherwise perfect mouthfeel."

"Overall - 4.75 - I'm not sure if I should just give it a 5, it's basically perfect. So complex and beautiful, and readily available for those who want it. At 10 dollars a bomber this is a good deal too, and I've never said that for a 10 dollar 22 oz bottle before. I guess I would say it's on a level with the great Belgian Quadruples, and I feel pretty comfortable saying that."

"Poured from tap at the brewery. Deep rich black with tan head...it looks like black coffee. Smell is deep roasted espresso and chocolate...smells amazing. Taste is roasted espresso and rich chocolate. .its so smooth. Hints of booze keep ploying with you but uts an awesome brew. One I probably wouldn't want to age as the espresso is just so good."

"O - This growler is why I like to taste new beers. Outstanding. Delicious. Nicely roasted without being overdone, the oak aging takes the edge off but leaves this subtle woody campfire taste in the profile that's mostly about rich, dark sugars, from caramels to chocolate, without being at all thick and cloying. This would be the beer to have snowbound with a roaring fire and several friends playing board games. My defining standard of a beer is, am I profoundly disappointed when I reach for another quaff and I discover that it's all gone? In this case, the answer is a definitive yes."
""

""

""
""

"O: really holds up over the bomber, lasted me almost an hour and a half. i love the burnt wood notes in it, and it's definitely better than the regular Yeti, which is saying something."
""
""
"O: I love that the Yeti offers an affordable way to try variations on a single base stout. I think I said this before in another review but I'm not a huge coffee/espresso guy, but they can really put in that flavor."

"o: definitely a coffee stout. if your not a fan of the roasted coffee/espresso flavors in your beer, this may not be for you. also if you don't like sweet beers, you may want to steer clear. me? i love both of those things, and am enjoying this. its a sipper for sure, and will linger in your mouth for a while."
"O: This slow drinking beer is pleasant & delightful. The coffee is worked into this perfectly. Overall, awesome."
"Pours black, about as dark a beer as I've ever seen, with a gorgeously thick, frothy head of slowly receding tan cream on top. The coffee presence is brighter than expected, not so dark and oily as most espresso roasts. Sweet and woody with milk chocolate, a variety of vinous fruity esters, and some toast. Heavier roasted malt in the mouth...dark coffee bean, cocoa, and oak. Faint vanilla and char towards the end. Rich, but nothing close to cloying. Thick and beautifully creamy going down easy with a touch of heat after the swallow. Very, very nice. Some alcohol creeps into the flavor, but plays nicely with the wood. Excellent integration of coffee into an already terrific base beer."

"Overall, this is a really pleasant beer. As for Yeti variants, I put this in a close second place to the Choco Yeti, but still very good."
"The best Yeti variant I've had yet. One of the purest coffee expressions in beer I've had. So thick, and so good."
""

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas."

"D: Damn solid variant to the base beer. Lots of layering going on with the dark grains, oak, hops, and espresso. Suprisingly well balanced and drinkable for such a beast of a beer. Worthy of the price tag."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into snifter. Jet black with a thick brown head that sticks around. Smells of rich chocolate and espresso, caramel, as well as oak. The oak seems to bring out some hop smells as well. A bit of alcohol comes through in the smell too. Taste is dark roasted malts, sweet chocolate and bitter espresso, and some oak smoothness at the end. Mouthfeel is big and creamy. This is a great stout, would be great with dessert."

"Overall an excellent stout, and with almost 6 months of aging it was delicious, so I’m hoping the next bottle I open at year’s end is even better with some age adding more depth and flavor. This was a great beer and one I highly recommend trying if you are a fan of big, bold coffee stouts. World class indeed."
""
""

"Overall/Comments: Wow. This beer was impressive. The nose was intoxicating and complex leaving me wanting to just enjoy the aroma all day. The flavor profile was just as impressive and complex. I was left wanting more. Highly recommended. Consumed 3/24/13. Classified as an American Double/Imperial Stout at 9.5% ABV."
"O: Though it’s a potent coffee stout, this beer, like most of the Yetis, has a blended flavor – it’s tough to pick out individual tastes, that is, when everything runs together with a single roasted character. Nonetheless (again, like most of the Yetis), I thoroughly enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
"MF - A medium body beer, slight mineral edge, not the viscousness or even the creaminess one might expect. Definitely alcohol in the finish."
""
"O: great beer, very well balanced. Oak, subtle chocolate and espresso with a nice malty char wood finish. I'm defiantly getting more to put away. Can't wait."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O-The best version of the Yeti series. And probably my favorite Imperial Stout so far. Balance is perfect. Complex as hell and the alcohol is hidden well. Absolutely no complaints."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: If you like coffee infused imperial stouts, this one should be at the top of your list. It is a little pricy but it never hurts to treat yourself every now and then. Think of it a a super-sized breakfast stout, breakfast not included. Salud!"
"Knockout stout, this. Maybe my favorite Yeti? No, it has to stand just behind regular oak-aged Yeti, though I haven't had it in a while. Maybe I should…"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with average carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel. Has a strong coffee aftertaste. Another good effort in the Yeti series from Great Divide."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Probably a former shell of itself as the large selling point, the espresso, is all but gone. Fortunately the oak shines through and the standard yeti is a delicious chocolate bomb which makes for an outstanding stout with nearly 2.5 years on the clock."
""
""
""
""

"O: A hoppy coffee forward stout that has a lot of layers and which I very much enjoy. I wish it had a bit more sweetness to prop up the coffee, but it's a minor complaint. Well done. Need to buy more next year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This is a great beer. It's between A and A+, a definite 4.75. This makes it one notch above the Stone. An exquisite beer."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled 1/10/2013. Pours dense pitch black color with a nice 1 finger dense dark tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Good soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malt, light char, vanilla, oak, toast, toffee, and light floral. Fantastic aromas with great balance of coffee and dark malts with moderate oak character. Taste of dark chocolate, espresso, roasted malt, light char, oak, vanilla, toast, toffee, light pine, floral, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, espresso, roasted malt, light char, oak, vanilla, toffee, and light pine on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of dark malt, coffee, and oak flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic imperial coffee stout as expected. Great complexity and balance of coffee and roasted flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O: A great coffee, oak-aged RIS. I imagine it may be perfect with a bit more mouthfeel, possibly an added barrel and bourbon character. Still thoroughly enjoyed though, this is definitely wonderful, I would think it makes the world-class cut."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A wonderful coffee oak aged beer. Not as good as BCBCS, but a serviceable substitute at a nicer cost as well"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A very good beer overall. Leaves the pleasant subtleties lingering in your mouth afterwards. The 9.5%ABV sneaks up on you a bit as it is very easy to drink. A great beer for a relaxing night."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- If you like chocolate or coffee, then this is a must-have. Great imperial stout. The added hop characteristics really balance out this beer. I didn't think I would enjoy this beer as much as I did with a bottle date over a year ago, but I thought it was still great. Having it aged a bit was just as good as having it fresh, but for different reasons."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours jet black with a small mocha head that quickly fades to a ring of bubbles around the brim of the glass. Smells of straight espresso. Taste is huge coffee upfront...like a shot of italian espresso that becomes a bitter dark chocolate with a bit of sharp oak. Mouthfeel is on the full side with just the right amount of carbonation. Overall a very good variation of a already stellar beer."

"O: this thing is one if the most in fm your face coffee beers I have ever had the only thing comparable to this level of coffee is WnB and even that doesn't give a solid caffeine buzz halfway through the bottle. I really like it because I like the in your faceness but it could use a little more balance. All that being said it is definitely my favorite yeti so I do recommend a try."

"Final Thoughts: I've never had an espresso stout before but if Espresso Oak Aged Yeti is any indication, then it is a good flavor to have. Would I drink it again? Yes, I've got last years vintage to try."

"My issue with this beer however is the aftertaste. It's hard to pin down, but it makes you rub your tongue on the top of your mouth. I prefer this beer colder because as it warms up, the aftertaste gets more prominent. It's almost a chalkiness or Nestle malt that sticks and lingers around. A slight offensive flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very flavorful stout and quite bitter. The espresso seems to bring in more of a bitter flavor than a coffee flavor."
""
""

""
"Verdict: A very nice coffee forward stout from Great Divide. Probably my favorite variant yet, but I still wish these were bourbon treated."
""
""
""
"O: I love coffee, and coffee beers, and I think this is easily one of the best out there. I'd buy this before many of the more overpriced, overhyped stouts out there. There's really nothing else you could ask for in this beer, except for maybe year round distro. This will always be a go to for me when I want a big intense stout. It's perfect for dessert as well."

"Pours pitch black with one finger mocha head. Smell is strong chocolate, lots of earthy coffee, and a bit of black currant. Flavor is huge chocolate with that Yeti bitterness to go along. Coffee adds and extra kick and shines in the aftertaste and finishes this nice and clean. Thick and viscous mouthfeel with adequate carbonation. This is up there with the best coffee stouts around and it's on the shelf all the time. Stock up on this one!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: excellent craftsmanship is apparent - this is decadent, but avoids the cloying sweetness that some stouts fall prey to; very classy and elegant."
""
""
""
"Nevertheless, even as a non-coffee (or espresso) drinker, this is super fine. Rich, smooth, bold, fulfilling, challenging, strong and something I could drink way too much of alone with an open growler!"
"O-this has got to be one of the best easily obtainable stouts out there. I'm extremely impressed. The oak flavor is done so well, it's very prominent yet it isn't overdone. It's got so much flavor to it that I can imagine drinking this as a meal. Great drinkability, alcohol isn't noticeable"
"O: very good beer."

"This beer didn't pair well with me and Amanda's homemade chicken margherita pizza buuut it was a delicious meal in its own. Quick side note: On the side of the label it says ,"Pairs well with breakfast burritos, eggs benedict, and hash browns..."" I dont see this pairing with hash browns lol. Goin off a hazy bag-wine-hangover memory, this beer starts completely black and thick with a big 'ol chocolate head. Crazy sticky lacing. Nice subtle aroma of rich chocolate and coffee. I didn't realize this was oak aged even though it says it in HUGE letters on the bottle, so I didn't notice any oaky flavors coming out very aggressively. I didn't notice any oak at all. Pretty cut and dry brew. Coffee, chocolate. But oh so damn good! Just so many levels of those two flavors. It's nuts. Full thick body. Nice crisp carbo. Classic baybuh."
"Pours a viscous pitch black capped by a dark beige one and a half finger head. Excellent retention and bunches of splotchy lacing. Roasted earthiness and malt, espresso, vanilla-touched oak, bakers chocolate on the nose. Big roasty and malty espresso notes, underlying oakiness, charred biscuit, earthy dark chocolate, vanilla, burnt raisin and molasses. On the finish bittering hops make their presence known along with bitter dark cocoa, and more general roastiness. Big full body that means business, yet velvety and creamy. Moderate, gentle carbonation. An exceptional variant of Yeti. The addition of coffee here actually adds complexity rather than overpowering the base beer, a downfall of many imperial stouts that have coffee added."

"i have for the most part really liked the yeti beers from great divide. i also start everyday with espresso, so it seemed like a great idea when i saw it in my local beer sto. this one is black as satans heart... not a trace of light gettin through, with a very slight brown head. the taste is huge, very bold, the stout and espresso flavors pair up very well. as i was drinking this i was thinking how awesome it would be if the crossbred this with their ""chocolate yeti."" low and behold they do, but seems you can only get it at their taproom in the great divide brewery....alls im sayin is bottle that stuff up and get it to us! this is a great stout- a great beer in general."

"O- This is a very rich and tasty stout. The oak is a nice touch and I enjoyed the subtly of it. Usually I find the oak to dominate in barrel-aged beers, but this has a lot of balance. Great Divide never seems to disappoint."
"Pours black with a slight brownish hue throughout and a nice full chocolate milkshake like head. Nice lacing. Aroma of the oak chips, chocolate, espresso, and some roastiness. A little alcohol is there too, as is the norm with all Yeti variants. Flavor is a burst of espresso out the gate which then transitions into some nice chocolate, roastiness, some oak giving off some vanilla, closing out with a slightly bitter espresso bean finish. Again a little alcohol is noticeable. A fuller, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, my favorite of the Yeti series and one of my favorite coffee stouts without a doubt."

"Probably drinks best from a snifter; my goblet did alright though. Also a teku would suit it nicely I imagine."

"Overall, a very interesting beer and I like what Great Divide did with this one. I would highly recommend splitting this with someone. I am now regretting my decision to kill a bomber by myself. It becomes a bit of a chore by the end with the sweetness. I would like to see more balance of all the flavors. Each on their own is great, but a bit too intense. Worth a purchase for sure."

"O-I enjoyed this imperial stout quite a bit. I typically favor sweeter stouts, but the bitterness on this Yeti was kept in check (perhaps by the age on the bottle?). The coffee flavors really came through in a pleasing way without tasting fake. Mouthfeel was balanced and all of the flavors really combined well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great head...1/4 inch of brown foam; dark chocolate in color; good cocoa, coffee and even vanilla hints in the nose; very well-balanced; love the espresso overtones; after trying the Belgian Yeti in a bottle the night before, this one kind of blows it away; oak and subtle hop flavors on the back of the tongue."
"This is really a delicious beer."
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic, one of the best stouts I can think of. Hides its strength well, goes down smooth, a sipper that you have to fight gulping, which is rare in a stout. Would have this again and again and I hope to try the other variations soon."
""
""
""
"This stout is simply delicious. It has two main flavors which battle for your tastebuds throughout the whole experience - coffee and chocolate - and it's quite amazing. Very rich and definitely something you'll want to sip, however one of the best stouts I've had."

"O - Wow, what a beer! A must try! Really Really good"
""
"Overall: I really like how the espresso is applied with this one. The supporting notes arent overdone. The yeti base stout is just so good to start that these ""special editions"" all taste good."
"This is a delicious, earthy, coffee-heavy stout. The flavors are well blended with just enough hop character to leave some balance and drinkability. This is a fantastic stout that is most definitely worth a try."

"Rich and smooth with some alcohol warming. I can see myself drinking this at the firepit up in the 'dacks."

"O: The taste of this brew is extremely bold in flavor and wish there were a bit more sweetening characters to help balance this one out. If you like big robust espresso and dark chocolate then this is a perfect brew for you."

"For an easily accessible imperial stout, this is great!"

"Price was 9.99 while this is out of my league now, I still enjoyed it a lot."

"My first of the yeti variations. Great Divide makes a great imperial stout, and the espresso and oak only add to it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Having this on tap back in April is largely why I love big stouts now. Not as great as I remember then, but still a fantastic stout. Could imagine that bourbon barrel aging would turn this yeti into a real monster."
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. The coffee goes really nicely with the chocolatey Imperial Stout base."
""
""
"Thick and dark as night. There's not the faintest hint of light getting through. Nice thick milky dark chocolate colored head. Judging the beer by the cover, this one will be a gem. Smells of bitter bakers chocolate and vanilla. Faint hint of coffee aroma but I was expecting much more. Smells good, just not what I was expecting. On first sip I let out an audible, ""WOW!"" This is one tasty beer. Sweet chocolate and vanilla flavors balanced by the roasted and coffee flavors. By balanced, I mean perfectly balanced. I honestly don't see how Great Divide could improve on this beer. I love coffee beers and this is one of the best I've had. It's right up there with Pisgah Valdez. Mouthfeel is so thick you can chew on it. Wonderful beer and I wished I'd purchased more than one bomber."

"this is a ridiculously good stout and well worth every penny. a heavy sipper but delicious throughout the whole time. barely tastes like alcohol."
""
"O: a great beer that I have been holding for a while and it didn't let me down. Refreshing and tasty, a bit filling but any beer with this depth should be. Recommended"
""
""
"Okay, does it sound like I dissed this beer? I'm not trying to dis it. I love it!"

"O: Yeti is always a pleasure and the espresso version is no exception. Fantastic beer."
""

"So good."
""

"I could not taste any oak or wood flavor in this beer. I wonder what this yeti ""WOOD"" taste like without the chips???? I think mostly the same."
""
""
""
"Overall, this kind of fails as a coffee beer, but is generally sucessful as an imperial stout. If espresso wasn't in the name, I would never identify this as a coffee beer. I suppose that the coffee may have faded since the bottling 6 months ago, but i've not had similar problems with other coffee beers. A pleasant enough beer, but not worth seeking out at the price tag."

"O - Overall this is another impressive stout from Great Divide. Really cant go wrong with their stouts."
"O: I love Yetis and this is not exception. Highly recommended, but perhaps not as superlative as the chocolate styling. Highly recommended."
"O - One of the top expresso stouts on the market that I have tried!"

"Pours a three-finger brown head that fades slowly, leaving some lace. Black color, no highlights. Light-medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Nose is coffee and flavor is almost burnt coffee and hints of oak, some caramel sweetness. Higher ABV is hidden. Pricey at $11.99 for a 22oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"T- dark chocolate, cocoa, espresso,  oaky/vanilla, very light hop taste. Just a very solid stout. A pleasure where I enjoyed every sip. 4.5  "

"Honestly, it just has this odd kind of overly bitter feeling that reminds of a liquor that I cant get rid of. It seems unbalanced and a mess. I really wanna like this thing, but I just cant. Its like a cheap red wine, thats the only thing I can think of. Bad Pinot Noir or Cabernet."
""
"O: Highly drinkable and nicely balanced. A unique Imperial Stout that I will definitely pick up again."
""
""
"Overall, this is an outstanding coffee stout. I have to rank it below Alesmith Speedway Stout, but it's pretty close to Founders Breakfast Stout. Definitely recommended."

"I'm pretty happy with all the Yeti stouts sent by the most awesome Rutager, all solid brews I'd want to drink again and age, I'm wondering how long I'm going to be awake or if there's enough booze in this to put me to sleep"

"Poured into a 20 oz Duvel tulip glass, bottled 1/02/12. Poured aggressively and got a 4 inch mocha head, that slowly dissipates leaving layers of lace. Smell is roasted expresso, vanilla, maybe tobacco, and some leather. Taste is 95% Expresso and 5% the other flavors from the nose. Body is large like all the Yetis, a nice amount of life for the style, maybe a little on the dry side, and for stout lovers very drinkable. This is like all Yetis, wonderful. Great Divide is the master of stouts."
""
"My favorite thing about this beer is the creamy mouthfeel. Man, this close to a 5. Great stuff. On the first sip, I'll admit to thinking the coffee flavor was trouncing everything else, but it pulls back a bit and lets everything else come out to play soon after. That oak flavor is faintly in there in the background. I'd wish a bit more for it, but I'm not complaining. A stellar bear. Bravo Great Divide."
"maybe my least favorite of the yeti's, which is to say that i still really liked it, but just that the espresso doesnt add much for me. pours dark and thick like they all do, with a lasting red/brown head and a lot of lacing. smells a it more like coffee than the regular yeti does, but it is not overpowering. the oak flavors are more prominent in this one, maybe becuase of the acidity of the coffee, which feels quite high to me. some bitter coffee notes in the finish as well. the feel is low carbonation and smooth, except for the acidity from the java. overall its not a beer id really want to drink a whole one of i dont think. the normal yeti and its oaked brethren have plenty of this espresso flavor already, and the addition of more throws off the ph to a funny level in my opinion."
"O: The oak on this is really strong, but this beer is quite nice when it warms up. Still a bit oaky and hoppy for me, but a nice beer."
""
""
""
"M: Not as viscous as I was expecting, nor is it as dense as its peers. Extremely dry and chalky finish."
"Overall: a tasty and satisfying imperial stout, though I would like a little more oak and yeti and maybe a little less espresso."
""
"Overall I think this is excellent. One of my new favorites."
""
"An outstanding beer. All around delicious. Aroma, appearance, and taste all come together to make a great treat."

""
"This is likely the oakiest beer I have ever had, its almost distracting. The coffee characteristics are bold, without being overbearing (fd: Im a coffee addict). The subtle vanilla note is perfected throughout. A bit harsh on the bitterness, and I would have liked to see more sweetness."
""
"This is pretty harsh, even with the age on it. Why would espresso need hopping so heavy?"
"Overall, really nice. I am not a coffee drinker and generally do not like a strong coffee flavour in my stouts. However, the oak balances the coffee flavour in a way that makes it very nice. Better than I expected it to be."
""
""
"O: Definitely enjoying it. There's a richness to it that balances the alcohol. And as always I sure do love these high ABV beers (9.5%)."
"I felt that the espresso flavor could have been a bit more, but it was covered by a bit too much of the oakyness. Other than that, it was still a very enjoyable brew and I highly recommend it."
""
""
"O: A good beer, but not very different from plain oak yeti. Where as chocolate yeti has a ton of chocolate flavor, this one is a bit of a let down."
""
"QUITE GOOD, PICK UP A BOTTLE!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer was pretty damn good. Of all the Yeti's that i have had, this one is prolly the second best falling behind the Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys coffee infused stouts "
"Intense coffee flavors, oak is present, lending some dryness and distinct woody notes. Creamy feel, roasty and dry, light bitterness lingers into the aftertaste. Medium to full bodied with light carbonation. Overall an intense imperial coffee stout, one to sip and savor over the course of an hour or two."
""
""
"The feel is great. Smooth and silky with a full body and soft carbonation. Overall really enjoyable here. The yetis are simply well done stouts."
"I really love Yetis."
""
""
""
" O - A damn good beer. It tastes like Oak Aged Yeti with 14 months on it, meaning that at this age is really no longer exemplifies the espresso character, although some of it is indeed still present. I was worried when I tasted Oak Aged fresh a few months back that I didn't like the brew, but I suspect is was simply due to the harshness of the fresh bottle. This beer is world class, but perhaps doesn't exactly reflect the ""Espresso"" in the title after so much time in the bottle."
""
""
"O- Chocolate for days. This is awesome. If you did chocolate / coffee stouts, you need to go try one of these."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Caffeine AND alcohol! Normally this combination isn't too bad, but I'm really feeling the caffeine in this one. A bomber to be shared for sure. I love Yeti. I love oak-aged Yeti. I've never had Chocolate yeti - but 10:1 I'd love it. This is not my cup o' beer. The flavor is strong, but not always in good ways. The brew is desiccating and it makes it a little much. In a 6 oz snifter this would be alright, but only coming in bombers makes this not worth buying in bottles."
""
"Jet black appearance with a very dark mocha colored head with pretty good lacing. Dark chocolate, fine ground espresso beans, vanilla and heavy cream with hints of cherries and oak chips. Sort of an overly sweet Hershey's syrup-like overall aroma. Overly huge espresso bite with overwhelming alcohol sourness and smoked wood on the first sip. Settles into a tamer dark chocolate mouthfeel while the heavy cream and vanilla flavors follow. Ends with smooth, milky cacao with a sour espresso finale. Lower carbonation with a medium sized body. I guess i was expecting something smoother and richer: what i got was spicy and aggressive. Looking at this objectively, it's pretty damn good."
""
""
"O: A great beer, overall. Its relative ease of access makes this beer overlooked, but it is better than many much more hyped imperial stouts. I'd like a bit more complexity in the aroma, but other than that it's a superb beer."
""
"Overall the espresso flavors in this beer work very well. Really well blended flavors make this beer easy to drink and enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - An interesting winter warmer for me. I am not that big of a coffee lover or perhaps I would connect with this one better. Not very filling, alcohol is potent."
""
"This beer is recommended for reading, contemplation, or as a digestive."
""
"One year old properly cellared bottle. Poured into a Gulden Draak flute. Pours jet black with a fine one finger, medium brown head with good retention and lacing. Nice looking. Aroma of chocolate, coffee, dark malts, slight oak and cherry. Taste is complex; coffee, rasted and smoky malt, chocolate, changing to a drier woody, neutral malt and finishing with a coffee bitterness with and oaky dryness Finish just a little dry allowing the bitterness to overwhelm the malt. Medium creamy body, but very nicely made and interesting. Excellent stout."
"O - This one is very good. Deep and roasty, enjoyable if you pace yourself. Yum!"
"Sharp bitter espresso rounded with a strong chocolate coating. Finishes with a bitter herb bite and a faint oak dryness. A very good beer, but the coffee dominates a little too much - seems forced."
"O- definitely seek this out as the price is right and it's well above the average off-the-shelf stout. love what the coffee did to this one, but that's not to say that oak aged and regular yeti aren't great on their own. will be picking up a few bottles tomorrow, highly similar to BORIS."
""
"O - A nice desert addition to the Yeti family. Buy as many of these as you can."
""
""
"I like all of the Yeti various, this one included. A lot of coffee flavor comes through for such a big beer. Let it warm first!"
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"O- This was a very good imperial stout, one of the better ones that I've had. It is kind of similar to the Breakfast Stout by Founders, but is a little bit lighter, a little bit less sweet, and has a slight oak taste. The Espresso Yeti had a nicely balanced taste between the sweetness, espresso, and oak. The oak definitely added an interesting aroma and taste to the beer. Would definitely drink again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I'm glad I got to try this beer and wish I had the conditions to age it properly. I've been impressed with the Yeti series and looking forward to their next addition."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very impressive, everything you would want from a coffee infused stout."
"Granted, I haven't had KBS, CBS, or BCBS, regardless of that, this is definitely the best stout I've ever had. The regular Yeti is phenomenal on it's own, but the espresso and oak aging give it some serious oomph. Good lord is it delicious, and man is it squatchy."
""
""
"O: 4.5"
""
""
"Poured from bomber into a snifter. Bottled on 12/13/10. A - Pours dark and stays dark in the glass with a rich mocha head which leaves intricate lacing. S - Dark chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts mingle nicely. T - A perfect balance of roasted malt and coffee. Oak not very pronounced. M - Velvety and smooth. A better mouthfeel you will not find. A great addition to the Yeti lineup. Worth a try and then another and another."
""
""
""
""
"Loved the first glass out of the bomober, interest faded near the end of the second glass. Very good stout."
""
"My favorite Yeti. Dark, thick and tasty. We all know that the base stout is a classic- the expresso and oak aging really brings out it's best. I'm glad I found it on tap to remind me that I should go pick up a couple more bottles. "
""
"This was my first Yeti variation love. Such a fan of the series. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"o: if you enjoy a stout infused with coffee, this one's for you. Incredibly drinkable. Did not get much of the vanilla oak flavor but a solid stout nonetheless."
"Poured from a bomber into a tumbler pint, the beer is a jet black coloring that looks viscous and smooth, with a thick, foamy, dense, dark chocolate colored head. Pours beautifully, and looks delicious. Aromas are heavy in mocha coffee, with a dark, bitter characteristic to it, as well as a highlight of sweet, creamy chocolate. Flavors are super bitter, with a hint of the alcohol into the roof of the mouth and the sinuses. The palate is completely coffee based, with a strong, roasted, dark presence throughout that is heavy in espresso, with an earthy and woody balancing undertone. Minimal cling that slips down the glass slowly while you drink, catching up to the surface of the remaining beer if left for more than a minute. The aftertaste has the roast coffee and bitterness of spent coffee grounds, with a somewhat drying effect. The finish is rich, robust, and eerily similar to a pressed espresso lingering behing on the palate, with a boozy kick."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good beer, still enjoy the oak aged version more."
""
"Uber smooth, goes down like butta, but again, the heat on this one was a bit noticable to me. That's the only tiny flaw I saw in this bad-ass Imp. Great job by Great Divide!"
""
"A good beer, GD definitely accomplishes what they were going for. The coffee is a bit much for me in this one. I would have probably enjoyed it after some time to age it to let the strong coffee characters subside a bit."
"This stuff is top notch. Yeti is great and this is one of the better variations of it. A must try."
""
""
"O- I love everything about this beer except for the taste...I wish I was kidding"
"Definitely one of the 'must-try once in your lifetime' beers. Highly recommended."
""
""
"Overall, this is an amazing stout. A perfect choice to enjoy with breakfast on this rainy saturday. I am absolutely a fan of every Yeti variation that I have had so far (BA Yeti is the last one that I have to conquer and it is begging to be opened). Definitely pick one up if you have a chance."
"O- Waves of emotion came over me with this beer. Absolutely soothing flavors and aromas. Just perfect."
""
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a pint glass, bottled on Jan 10, 2012. This pours a motor oil thick pitch black with a brown head which leaves a lacing, perfect. The smells are of dark roasted malts, espresso, alcohol. The feel is thick and creamy. The taste is big and excellent dark roasted malts, espresso, give hop flavor, amazing."
"O - Oak Aged Yeti is one of my favorite beers ever and this Espresso treatment is an excellent addition to the Yeti family. This an upper echelon coffee stout and I highly recommend picking some up."
""
"What happens when you take an awesome imperial stout and add coffee to it? You get an even more awesome imperial stout. This was a very nice treat, and would absolutely make a great companion at breakfast, as long as you have a fun day ahead of you already. If you've got stuff to do, maybe save it for another morning. It has the potential to put you on your butt for sure!"
""
""
""
"Overall: If you enjoy a cup of joe, you're probably going to like this version of Yeti. The coffee flavors definitely highlight the experience."
""
""
""
"O: Very good version of Yeti. Probably my second favorite next to BA Yeti."
""
"The flavor is huuge. Initially there is a big hit of espresso. I am wondering if this is gonna five me a kick of caffeine. There is a sharp bit of caramel/vanilla going through this one which makes it smoother than anticipated."
""
"o. I wish I could drink this with breakfast as the bottle suggests, but I couldn't wait to dig in. overall, I think this beer is every bit as good as founders breakfast. if you like coffee stouts, this one is great, I hope to find it on draft to try again... and maybe get a couple bottles to age. all the yeti's I've had so far have been awesome, but this one may take the cake. would love to have some crime brûlée to pair, as the bottle suggests."
""
"O: The beer really grew on me through the pour. At first I was ""Meh", but now I am sold. Well made beer, worth seeking out again."
""
"Overall: this is a great deal for $8 for 22ozs I bought as many as I found. I am not a coffee drinker but this was great for breakfast."
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
""
"O: This was my first Great Divide beer - I really love the smell here, the taste didn't yield as much coffee as I had expected."
""
""
""
""
"O- Another great Yeti variation. While not my favorite variation, this is well worth grabbing a bottle or two of, especially if you are a fan of espresso/coffee stouts. A big, bold stout with plenty of roastiness combined with bitter espresso and dark chocolate."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is my kind of brew. Behind the west coast IPA, the Russian Imperial stout is my favorite style. I find this one to be done very well. The dark chocolate, coffee and oak aging meld perfectly for a rich and delicious winter brew. Couldn’t have more than one with the strong mouthfeel and ABV, but very enjoyable. 4.75"
""
""
"overall: great stuff - not sure why i was never able to find this in the midwest, but glad i finally did"
""
""
""
"Pours a black color with a perfect two finger chocolate head. Massive lacing on my snifter glass. A true black hole in this beer. The nose is awesome- chocolate, espresso, malt, hops. Really well done, and just about perfectly balanced. Taste follows the nose profile, with a little vanilla and oak thrown in. Fantastic. None of the 9.5% abv is evident at all. Feel is medium full, with a nice malt/hops battle happening all the way through the aftertaste. Overall, this is an amazing beer- and I highly recommend you pick it up if you haven't tried it. Cheers."
"I liked this one quite a bit. I've definitely like stouts with coffee in them. The oak is nice in this one, too."
"D: I love the Yeti beers, they are all just what you'd expect from a solid Imperial Stout. Big, bold, flavorful and very smooth, I could sip these beers all night."
"O - Weighing in at 9.5% ABV, a fairly heavy hitter, good brew for this cold snowy day. Lost of character."
"The mouthfeel is very full, very creamy, and only slightly coating than I thought it would be. There is slight carbonation though that gives it a little more jump. There's a bitterness that rears it's head right behind the coffee character. This beer is pretty big, lots of flavor and some complexity that will deepen over time. I'm excited to see how this beer gets after a year or more. 3 bottles in the cellar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. I could drink this regularly. Just a great stout. If I had to pick I would say oak is not very appearant."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I think that this is the weakest of the Yetis so far. It looks nice, smells amazing, and feels nice but the overwhelming bitterness in the taste kills it. Still a very good beer though."
""
""
"Taste is a problem, the coffee is completely absent. Oak and roast are there, but they merge with a totally unexpected shot of hop to create a bitterness that is borderline intolerable. Just not fun to drink. Wonderfully creamy consistency, as is the case with all Yetis. But taste matters most, so this beer is thumbs-down. I will still go after other Yeti mutations, but I am done with this one. Still a bit shocked."
""
""
""
"Great Divide, if you are reading this, please create a beer without such a strong hop bite ... it will be a hit!"
"O: I have tried a bunch of different Yeti versions from GD and have usually been disappointed, but this one is very good. I might have to pick you another bottle or two while I can."
""
""
"This is a really good stout and I think my favorite of the Yeti variations."
"Drinks with relative simplicity. Very solid for the style and drinks very well just like the original Yeti. Great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A fan of Great Divide beers, I was surprised to discover one I do not like, and this is it. Way over the top, it seems it can not decide whether it wants to be coffee or stout. Cloying sweet combined with full alcohol strength. This is meat for somebody else. An expensive waste of time."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great example of an impy stout and worth seeking out again."
"o - delicious and decadent. drinks well, but i doubt i could have more than a glass or two in a night. definitely a dessert beer."

"Great beer. the coffee flavor stays for a long time. Could use a little more sweetness. Nice beer to start the new year with."

"Awesome first brew of the day."

""
""
""
""
""
"When poured from the bottle the beer pours a very dark chocolate brown with a nice light brown head. The scent is all rich roast coffee with a hint of chocolate malt. The taste is coffee though not as intense as the nose would indicate. The mouthfeel is full and rich but again not quite up to expectations. Overall this is a very tasty beer and I am glad I tried it. While the alcohol level stated on the bottle is high it is extremely well integrated and not at all noticeable when drinking this brew. The carbonation is also well integrated."

""
""

"Serve this at room temperature, I urge you."
"On another winner here, very good all round beer. Not as good as the base beer in my opinion, but still a fantastic stout that combines drinkability with plenty of flavour and plenty for a hop head to get excited about."
"NOTE: Live review."
"Overall: This is an excellent stout. I expect the espresso has faded somewhat, but I wouldnt want it to have more coffee presence. I'll definitely get this one again."
"O: This is an exceptional beer. The coffee aroma is quite strong, but not overwhelming in the overall taste. The backbone is the oak and bourbon with a mild bitterness at the end. Creamy malt compliments the extremely slight coffee bitterness at the end. I love this beer. I would love more."
"Overall, this is a solid beer. The abv is well hidden and the tastes are solid in all facets. It is both drinkable and meets up to expectations. Some enhanced stouts are not as good, but this at least achieves."
"This is a fantastic oaked Imperial Stout. The oak is not overwhelming and does not take away from the traditional American Imperial Stout flavors. Great flavors and aromas that are exactly as advertised."
"O- Awesome coffee imperial stout. This beer may have the most coffee flavor of any beer I have ever had! Glad I have another bottle of this."
"O - a really great stout, with a lot of sweetness, would like to try one fresh"
"A well-done imperial stout. This is my second of the 2011 brewing. I am looking forward to another."
"O: This is a very good beer, however, I preferred it with a little less age due to the stronger presence of the coffee. I do have a few more bottles that I will try later to see how the tastes continue to mellow."
"aroma is that of chocolate, caramel and nutty malt. Appearance is deep black with a milk chocolate brown head. Taste is that of a chocolate covered espresso bean. Palate is full bodied, oily, thick with a soft carbonation and long finish. overall an amazing version of yeti."
"Overall this is a pretty damn good beer. Smooth, lots of flavor and a nice bitter aftertaste. I prefer it too the Yeti Imperial Stout and highly recommend it to stout lovers."
"O - A very nice, big beer; smooth enough to warrant reminding oneself not to drink it too fast. This one has been in my cellar for a bit; I'm going to have to grab a fresh one and compare; impressive nonetheless."
"great beer, but I think I still like the regular Oak Aged and Chocolate Oak Aged better."
"This is a complex beer with alot going on, which I love. The color was dark brown with a brownish, mahogany head. Little or no lacing here. The aroma was bready with cocoa and vanilla mixed in. Strong, dark, near burnt coffee flavors at first with big chocolate flavors developing. Alcoholic finish dominates the hoppy malts at the ends. Somewhat of a thin mouthfeel, my only complaint with this beer. Overall, a great beer."
"86 out of 100"
"Cheers."
"O - An excellent beer. Has an oddly red wine like quality from the omnipresent oak character. The coffee aspect gives the beer a good bitterness that complements the massive malts well."
"Overall, this is a well made beer that I wish I could find more of. Not sure if the age on the beer or storage conditions have altered the flavors."
"Pours black with nice brown half inch frothy head. Smell is sweet with hints of alcohol and coffee. Goes down very bitter and strong alcohol taste. I hoped a little more coffee flavor here, but otherwise this brew stands true to the name and style. I probably wouldn't get it again though, just because I don't care for Imperials too much."
"O: Overall, this has not been my favorite imperial stout but it is definitely worth trying if you are looking to explore the world of wood aged beers. However, shy away from an aged version of this style if you are looking to get a dominant espresso quality. My only advice is that I would suggest sharing this beer with one or two other people, as the woodiness can become a bit sore on the palate as you make your way through. I do plan to return to this beer, perhaps as a tasting with the other Yeti's to showcase the versatility and uniqueness of the style."
"D ~ Love this beer. If you enjoy Imperial Stouts check this one out, even if you don't like OG Yeti."
"Overall: A fairly drinkable and enjoyable 6 year old imperial stout. I'd guess 4 years would have been peak."
"Pours a dark dark brown. Lote of nice brown head. Looks pretty. Smells very coffee heavy. A very nice aroma. Roasted malts, sweet dark malts. Tastes bitter, lots of coffee. Roasted malts. The oak is almost non existent covered by the coffee. Pretty good mouthfeel. Overall enjoyable."
"Higly suggest you put down a bottle, and be patient. The wait is worth it."
"O - Really enjoyed this brew and would have another."
"O - Glad I got to see what this brew did with age... I won't age another coffee stout, but this one was good."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. Like all the other Yetis, this one is an excellent Imperial Stout. I would recommend giving it a shot."
"T: Heavy on the dark roasted coffee upfront. Then some powdery dark chocolate, espresso and some charred oak and hops on the finish. Pretty nice."
"This is a really good, layered imperial stout and another great version of Great Divide's wonderful Yeti lineup."
"Just an exemplary stout, rich and flavorful, yet smooth and highly drinkable. Both the beer connoisseurs and the seldom-drinkers of our group fell in love with this brew, with the whole group planning a trip to Colorado just to get more. Buy it if you find it."
"D- Overall, a delicious after-dinner treat. Assertively spicy, which blends well with the coffee, but definitely originates from something else. Incredible beer though, lots of bitter/dry complexity that would pair well with chocolate desserts. Maybe even pancakes."
"O: This is a delicious espresso stout, probably the best I've had of the style (which I have not had too many espresso stouts, but a TON of regular imperial stouts). I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good stout, it's utterly delicious."
"Thanks for the bottle Tony and happy birthday Nathan!"
"O- This was my second favorite of the five Yet’s we had tonight, big coffee profile, nice roastiness and oak presence that really ties this beer together."
"O - I'd put this between the regular Yeti and the chocolate oak aged Yeti. I definitely like the impact of the oak aging. The coffee flavors were not overdone or prominent, which I thought worked well in this brew."
"A very enjoyable beer, but not as amazing as I thought it would be. Still definitely worth trying once, but I have many other RIS that I enjoy more. Espresso does work well."
"O- Awesome beer. Would have had a 5 for taste is coffee was a little more prominent, but i cant complain at all."
"This is a fantastic looking Imperial Stout. Black as night, and thick as crude. Very dark mocha/brown 2 finger head forms, leaves nice lace and has nice retention. Plenty of coffee in the aroma, and for the most part, equal parts chocolate. The oak chips come through nicely and you definitely can't miss the woody notes it invokes. No real alcohol on the nose. The espresso really shows through more in the taste: very bitter and sultry. Chocolate makes it's self known, with touches of vanilla and a more balanced oak character. Again, too much going on to note and heat in here. Body is full and it has a very pleasant creaminess. I'll have to get a fresh bottle and see how much more pronounced the espresso is. Great stout."
"Overall, this is great beer, though no doubt far too strong for many--especially those who don't like the taste of coffee or tobacco. But for those who do, this is a definite must-try."
"O: I've had this beer before, and it must have had a lot more age on it because I thought it was a lot better. This beer really does show all the indication that it's young, but the taste profile is a seed of complexity. I am really struck by how kopa luwak like the espresso is at the moment. Having had Mikeller's Weasel, I can't help but notice the similarity in the tastes. Currently the espresso is overwhelming deeper notes, but the creamy mouth is already there. Once the acidity of the barrel mellows out, and the nutty character comes out; you have a winner. This beer is much better with time."
"O: This beer is really very delicious. I wonder if the woody character would come down with age, and if so just how delicious it can get. Whether you've had much experience with esspresso stouts or not I think you can pick this up, enjoy it, and admire it for its wonderful execution. I repeat my previous concern though, as it stands, there's too much wood/oak in this that tamppers down the more savory and sweet flavors in a way that's a little overbearing. If the woodiness disappears with age or with a different recipe, I'd have no problem giving this a 4.5+."
"Overall a very good beer. Oak seems more forward in this version of yeti. Expected more expresso but still a solid beer."
"O: Good stuff. A perfect compliment to dessert, or a fine way to otherwise wind down. Definitely something I'll come back to."
"O: Another ""I haven't had this one before"" purchase. Very, very glad I tried it. Definitely a sipper though at 9.5%."
"A really impressive coffee stout, can only be enjoyed in small amounts."
"O: Overall, this is a fantastic beer. Coffee stouts are among my favorite styles so I really enjoyed it and would definitely seek it out again. As I said, it's not as ""coffee forward"" to me as some others I've had, but I still really like it and would definitely recommend trying it."
"Creamy, silky, and smooth. Overall, a very delicious and enjoyable beer."
"Good drinkability / overall. But this isn't a mildly flavored beer, this is the Hells Angel of Coffee beers, it can get a little rough."
"O: This is my favorite of all the Yetis, except that I haven't tried the chocolate yeti yet. This is an amazing stout under any standards, and if you have a chance to get one, get it. This one is bottled on Dec 20, 2010 so it's got a few months of age on it, but still plenty of flavor and bite."
"Serving type: bottle"
"O: Good beer. Bit sweet and lacking complexity once it gets to the tastebuds. Drinkable though. 3"
"overall a good, not quite great, beer. the oak is borderline overkill, but everything else is done so well, it's an extremely pleasing journey."
"As a non-coffee drinker, I'm not surprised to find that Espresso Yeti is my least favourite among the group. (We all have our biases.) I insist, however, it has less to do with the presence of coffee and more to do with the lack of typical Yeti characteristics: spruce-y, spicy hops and rich dark chocolate malts, both of which are relatively less pronounced. I also feel the $15 I shelled out was a little much given the comparative quality of standard Yeti."
"Overall: I'm glad I tried this one, I never considered buying a bottle due to it always being there and me wanting to try something else, but I'm glad I finally tried it."
"Overall it is a great IMP stout but there are better IMO"
"Overall it's tasty but I wouldn't want to drink it very often. It's a bit overly dry, but if you're into coffee and oak aged stouts, this one's for you."
"O - Overall a nice beer. Almost unbalanced due to the strength of the coffee up front and oak in the back."
"For someone who likes dark, chewy beers, this approaches perfection. As the beer warms, the vanilla starts to come to the front and provides a balance of sweetness that really puts this beer over the top."
"Poured from a 22 oz bomber a Duvel tulip glass. An aggressive pour yields a deep black body with a large dark tan head that really lasts and leaves a lot of lacing. The aroma is mainly of expresso,with hints of chocolate and roast malt. The first sip reveals a nice coffee/expresso flavor,followed by bitter chocolate and burnt roasted malt. There is also a hint of vanilla and a faint woodiness. The mouth feel is medium thick and the carbonation gives it a slightly creamy character. This is a very fine coffee stout."
"Goes down a treat, a lovely winter nightcap. I really like this beer. Overall, I prefer a slightly sweeter, more luxurious imperial stout to this. The flavours are balanced well, for sure, but I'd just like them to indulge with the chocolate flavours a little more. Totally personal taste, of course."
"This brew pours a jet black hue with brown highlights and has very nice carbonation that leaves behind a mocha laced two finger head and heaps of lacing everywhere and it really does like a coffee/beer,the smell is mainly coffee aromas with hints of cappicino,dark milky coffee,chocolate,roasted malts and a tinge of oak,the mouthfeel is full bodied,very lucious and velvety and the first taste i get is basically chocolate with a coffee centre followed by roasted toasted malts,oak,cherry ripe and the finish is pretty much just the same as finishing a nice bitter creamy cappicino and overall this drop is truly exceptional and highly recommend for a dull winters day like today very impressed."
"D/O: This imperial stout is distinguished well from its Yeti siblings by the addition of coffee. It has big coffee qualities, but they are effective in the way they are integrated into the base beer. Unfortunately it is tethered to that dark beer-acidity that can turn a good stout into a challenging stout that becomes wearisome quickly. Here acidity is more prevalent than in other Yeti varietals, probably an unintended contribution of the coffee. The drinker must take the good qualities with the less-palatable when it comes to coffee in beer."
"This beer starts off very dark and finishes with a lot of hop greenness. At this exact moment, this is one of the most complete, complex, beers that I have ever enjoyed . . . Luxurious! The beautiful coffee aroma and flavor serves as a reminder that this beer is caffeinated. Oh yes, as I discovered, this beer will perk you right up!"
"As someone who now knows what coffee tastes like....yes I know how crazy it sounds. This beer got me into coffee. Yes it is bitter chocolate but the espresso is not subtle...it is overt and simply AMAZING."
"Overall: A very pleasing marriage of dark roast and coffee flavors and aromas with oak. Very complex, with the coffee serving to restrain the acrid notes of the black malt grains. Highly recommended as a beer for the initiated, as well as the uninitiated. Hard to imagine anyone wouldn't find it at least admirable"
"D: This beer isn't really drinkable in the sense that one (or half of one) is plenty. Defiantly an after-dinner dessert beer."
"Pours black with a dark brown head. Creamy, great retention, and leaves good lacing. Instant smells of coffee, chocolate, and some dark fruit. Taste follows- sweet but in a good way. Some oak, roast, and a touch of hops are also present. Full bodied, low/medium carbonation, and a creamy mouthfeel. Fantastic beer- I must buy more ASAP."
"Every aspect of this beer works together great and it was worth buying."
"Pours a deep black with a milk chocolate colored head two finger head. Nice lacing and retention. Aroma of oak, vanilla, cherry and a hint of hops and espresso. Very big and busy flavor. Starts with a kick of hop resin before turning to a slight coco and dark chocolate malt. Then the oak aging really kicks in. Good oak, cherry and vanilla flavors before an espresso kick to finish. Really busy, and not all that cohesive."
"overall: This is a markedly better beer than the Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti imo. Great job."
"As another reviewer stated, there is just too much going on in this beer. They should either eliminate the oak aging or the espresso, so you can enjoy the ingredients. A bit pricey, but they have something they can tweak in future batches."
"O= expensive at $9.99 for a 25-ounce wine-bottle but definitely worth it for the try, and to stock up on for special occasions once your stocks rise from the dead."
"Deuce to tulip. The appearance is good; motor oil with not head and low activity. Smell is better than average; chocolate and espresso. Taste is good, but not as complex as I'd hoped for. Chocolate, espresso, and oak notes were present. Mouthfeel was a sipper; warm and lowly carbonated. Overall, a good beer; just not $10/22 oz. bottle good."
"O: Have been a fan of imperial stouts for a while now, but this was my first barrel-aged. REALLY enjoyed it. I took my time with it and savored every sip. Would highly recommend."
"This beer will definitely give you something to chew on and think about. While nice, it had a little too much going on with the oak running the show. I might drop some adjectives the next time I reach for a Yeti."
"O: Overall, this beer is very tasty! Everything I enjoy in a beer, and definitely left me wanting to try more."
"O: Wow – I feel like I’m drinking a strong cup of coffee with a high ABV. A nice sipping beer that can be enjoyed anytime. This is a big coffee stout – with tons of aroma and taste."
"O: Very well done. They took an already amazing stout and tweaked it into something great. Cheers to the BA who sent this to me last year. Sorry I forgot who you are."
"O: The coffee is big and I like it. I enjoyed the woodiness that comes through as well. Overall a great aged stout."
"Overall a very powerful beer with lots of taste. This beer is perfect for its style. Yet another great stout in their line of Yetis."
"1/28/2011"
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer a lot and found myself wishing it had been around more during the cold winter months."
"O- Very good beer. I would prefer more presence of espresso but i still found it very enjoyable and will look forward to my next one."
"D/O- A real treat from Great Divide. First time I've been able to have a full pint of this. Sat on a bottle for 9 months and couldn't take it anymore. Pre-DLD night was a success."
"TASTE: A bulldozer of flavor! It feels like minutes after I tried one sip and I'm still rolling the flavors around in my mouth. Uh oh...this is going to take me a LONG time to drink/savor! Rich, heavy feel almost like drinking chocolate syrup that's not sweet. It's balanced, however by a bright acid note towards the top that carries equally through. Finishes PERFECTLY. There's vanilla, toasted malts, and some tongue grabbing hoppy bitterness - all a bit reigned in, but balanced."
"22oz bottle with a Bottled On date of Jan 14 2011. Pours a heavy dark brown/black color with a good sized frothy brown head. Lots of lacing. Big aroma of coffee along with dark chocolate, vanilla and roasted malts. Taste is a big amount of coffee upfront. Also some more of that dark chocolate flavor. Pretty sweet. Hints of the oak as well. Coffee aftertaste. This one is tasty but thick and sweet. Probably couldn't drink more than 1 and that one sitting will take awhile. Not as sweet as the Southern Tier beers (Choklat, Mokah, etc) but reminds me of them. Overall, its damn good and worth having again."
"O - My passion for coffee lead me to this one and I did enjoy it, but my preference would still be the regular Yeti. Overall, a good Imperial. But for me, a tad bit too strong on the espresso side. I love espresso, but apparently not as much in my beer."
"D - Great beer; I recommend this for dessert; I followed up a couple slices of New Haven style pizza with this and was very happy; sadly, I also came to realize that I had one of the last batches of Great Divide beer shipped to CT....I hope it comes back soon!"
"It's big, but at one year there's not much assertive alcohol to taste, which always aids drinkability. Still, at this strength, you will feel it when you drink a bomber yourself, certainly."
"O-- I still prefer regular Yeti to this but on its own it is fantastic. Well paired flavors and in this format it is a better beer to age as the Oak version does get more Oak taste in it with age. Here with a year of age the Oak does drop off a bit more and the coffee is much more obvious. Well hidden ABV and a treat to drink. Some of the best variations of a base beer out there to get."
"O - This has good drinkability. The flavor is great and it goes down very easy. Overall, I think this is a great imperial stout. It looks smells and tastes great. I definitely recommend trying this one."
"Overall- This is quite the complex beer - not something to be paired with anything else. It's a lone ranger to say the least. Powerful strides with aromas and flavors, this Yeti is a delicious fire-side sipper. A must try for coffee lovers, stout drinkers and anyone who likes a twist from the norm."
"It was a little too hyped up perhaps but I wasn't wowed by this one. It's very drinkable for a 11 percent stout but it doesn't have to much going on. It's very well balanced which accounts for the drinkability. I'd assume getting the java imperial from santa fe and save 8 bucks."
"It pours black with bubbly, tan foam. The aroma is earthy and woody, like an oak aged chardonnay, with notes of chocolate and espresso. The espresso flavor is obvious. There are hints of vanilla and dark fruit. It's very hoppy for a stout, with quite a bitter finish. I wish it was creamier. Apparently, I don't care for oak aging in beer any more than in wine."
"Overall, awesome beer, delivered what it said on the label 10 fold and tasted damn good."
"O- A really excellent Imperial stout, it's nice to see one that's on the bitter side every once in a while. Must try."
"Yeti is an amazing beer with many iterations and this one does not disappoint. It is possibly one of the best dessert type beers I have ever tried and I love how intense and rich the flavors are. Probably not the best beer to pair with food, but this is a great beer to split with a friend after dinner."
"o - theyre not joking. espresso. as my friend put it, its young. definitely a beer to be aged a while."
"Overall: This is certainly a good to great beer, but I have had better coffee flavored stouts and this is not worth $12 a bomber. Would try again, but not near that price tag. This issue keeps me from recommending it."
"Bottle. Recieved as a gift from my honey on Valentines Day and just opened. Poured into a tulip glass a really dark brwon color with a big fluffy dark tan head. Oaky, coffee notes dominate the nose. Very nice lace left as the head settles out. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. Roast espresso coffee flavors abounf from start to finish with oak flavors popping in towards the end. They they said espresso oak aged, they were spot on! Some dark fruit and molasses flavors too. Like."
"Overall: This is supposed to be an espresso stout; but, I can not taste a significant amount of espresso in this beer. Nevertheless, the oak, chocolate, and mouth-feel make up for that in a big way. This beer can be thought of as a lighter Abyss, less complex but much more drinkable! I will age a couple of bottles for at least two years!! I think the next time I have this beer it will pour muddier, smoother and way more chocolaty, I cant wait!!"
"o: A pleasure to try, but that is all I'll ever need. It has a wonderful coffee taste and an incredible look and nose, though I don't think this is anything I'll be looking for in the future."
"Rich and very smooth, full-bodied with a touch of coating on the palate. Very light effervesence, apparently the pour took care of that. This is a fine concoction and well worth seeking out. L'Chiam!"
"I very much enjoyed this beer...will definitely order again!"
"Overall pretty solid here another solid yeti for the pack."
"This is way better than the Oak Aged Yeti and not quite as good as the regular, but it's close. The oak works harmoniously with the espresso to create a synergistic layer of awesomeness to an already outstanding Impy stout."
"That being said, this is definitely one of the better coffee stouts that're out on the market."
"This one pours pitch black with really thick, foamy, dark tan head. Good lacing. Intense chocolate and coffee aromas, very rich and roasty. A smooth coffee flavor mixed with rich dark chocolate. Moderate sweetness with plenty of roast malt. Falls just a bit flat, lacking complexity. Very smooth, creamy mouthfeel with no bitterness from the coffee. Carbonation still lends a slight crispness."
"This is a good beer, but you must like coffee to enjoy it."
"This was a very nice coffee stout, overall, and I think I prefer it over chocolate or regular oak aged yeti."
"Overall: very impressed by this beer. Its one of the better stouts with coffee beans added that I have had. All too often, coffee stouts just taste like coffee beans and have absolutely nothing else going on. Well, this one doesn't fall into that one dimensional trap as so many other things are going on in the taste. Loved it and recommend it wholeheartedly. Cheers!"
"Its hard to beat the original Yeti. And while I dig the added coffee notes and barrel aging, I'm not for sure it actually adds anything to this brew. That being said, this is a good beer, and I can guarantee you won't regret leisurely sipping an evening away with one of these as your source of entertainment."
"Espresso Yeti pours night black, with a tall, burnt caramel head. The foam cap has the consistency of key lime pie, and has crazy stamina. Lacing is very good, rings of foam are left stuck to the inside of the glass. It's just short of where it needs to be for a 5 though. The nose is entirely too one dimensional though. It smells almost like straight up cold coffee, with just barely a appreciable hint of dark chocolate. The beer comes across with much better balance on my palate. Coffee is still the star of the show, but rich dark chocolate has a much bigger presence. Anise comes in in the background to further balance the beer. Any kind of hint of oak or vanilla would really finish this beer off, but the flavor profile as is is pretty outstanding. The body is everything you'd want in an imperial stout... rich, creamy, and smooth. I'd be willing to bet there were some oats in the grain bill. Unfortunately, the carbonation is a bit over the top, coming across as a distraction at times. Espresso Yeti toes the line for how coffee forward a beer can be for me, but manages not to cross it, and the result is one of the better imperial stouts I've had in a while."
"This beer pours thick black... Almost syrup like coming out of the bottle. There is brown foamy head that just covers the top of the beer almost constantly and leaves plenty of lacing as you drink. The aroma is not overpowering with coffee as I kind of expected before i opened the bottle. Instead, there is a nice mixture of roasted barley, caramel as well as coffee notes. The taste has hints of cherry, oak, caramel, roasted malt and of course coffee. The mouthfeel is nice and velvety, with a slight note of carbonation on the tip of your tongue. Overall a great beer that I will probably keep in my house at all times."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. The smell is great and holds promise, but the taste brings too much oak and wood. I think I have to put the chocolate version above this , despite the strong smell."
"O: While I view this one as better than the chocolate and oak aged version, none of them are as good as fresh Yeti. A little disappointed, but it is still very good. Was looking for a littler more here."
"Really nice sipper. I could keep drinking this until I passed out."
"O: This is a really delicious beer, but the bomber was a little bit too much for me and the flavors became overpowering. I enjoyed the first sip far more than the last."
"I get hit with a wave of strong coffee at first, which turns into a slight sweetness from the oat and vanilla notes. Finishes hop strong. The bitterness from the combination of the coffee and hops is almost cloying. There is not alot of sweetness in this beer, and it makes it's drinkability a little difficult. Overall, a really good beer but I wish I had split the bottle with someone. I will be really interested to see how this beer hold up in my cellar. I think some time will bring out some more vanilla notes that might have been hidden behind the coffee and hops. "
"Been a good while trying to get this one. It looks dark brown almost perfectly black. A good two finger dark brown head. Smell of chocolate and espresso! Tastes amazing with a really strong espresso taste. the chocolate after taste makes me want some coffee with my chocolate. Nice and thick just the way i like it. this is a great beer. if you see it you should buy it."
"Pours black with a thick fluffy brown head with some good lacing going on. Smell is mostly of obust roasted coffee other roasted malts with only hints of dark bitter chocolate. The oak character comes in more through the taste coupled with the dark roasted coffee and a slight taste of alcohol. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth with medium carbonation. Very good. Overall this is a great Coffee RIS."
"O: Highly drinkable for a big stout; the complexity keeps me coming back to this one, not to mention the high quality of the coffee and oak flavors present. Really enjoyable; glad I got to try this one again, and I'll certainly be returning to it in the future. The best of the Yeti series I've had so far (beating out normal Yeti and standard Oak Aged)."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - A slight bourbon burn with huge coffee notes. Overall a high quality beer that I enjoyed just as much this time as when I had it on tap. A relief in our night of pretty disappointing beers."
"Very good beer but it doesn't mask the alcohol as well as some imperial stouts. I don't think I'd drink two 22 ounce bottles in a row, partly because of the 9.5% ABV but also because it's a sipping beer not a session beer."
"D- overall it's a great, fairly complex stout, with very little detection of it's 9.5%; I haven't had this beer fresh so I'm not sure how strong the oak flavor is, but with a year on it it's really good"
"O: The 1 bomber I hogged was more than enough for myself. I wish i had taken the bottle's advice and had it with a breakfast burrito. I really enjoyed this beer, especially as it warmed, and can't wait to have another with some age on it... And a breakfast burrito"
"I want to penalize this beer for costing me $13 and leaving me wanting more, but I just can't do that. I had the original Yeti and after a quarter of it I knew that it wouldn't last long enough. The exact same thoughts are going through my head now. This is a beer that will never last as long as I want it to and also one I'll keep coming back to. I have a feeling that I'd die if I had any of the Yetis on tap."
"Drinkability-Coffee definitely the star, so it doesn't dissapoint. Highly drinkable for 9.50. I will continue to purchase all Yeti's."
"This is a nice, versatile, potent brew. Lots of flavor, but would seriously be suitable for breakfast as well as dessert. Typical of a Yeti brew, it's almost too dry and bitter to get through the whole thing, but I did it anyway."
"Gonna have to pace myself with this one. It's better than I remember, and the 9.5% ABV is perfectly masked"
"Overall: While, I accept that it's an espresso version of Yeti, I think the coffee finish is a little overwhelming. Without a little patience between drinks, it really just tastes of espresso. With some patience, and a little time, the other flavors come out."
"I'm excited to see what the other one in my cellar tastes like in 365."
"Poured from slightly below room temp bottle into pint. Left an amazingly fluffy head the color burnt caramel that slowly faded into a nice lacing as the glass emptied. Smells like roasted coffee and malts. Mouthfeel is a little slick and creamy and at first tasted like a shot of espresso with an almost undetectable bitter woody finish... Really like this and would recommend over most other wood/barrel aged stouts I have has..."
"D - This beer has great drinkability! I would love to have this one again... too bad Great Divide doesn't distribute to Las Vegas."
"Pours a super thick sludge black with a nice 2 inch milk chocolate colored head that fades to a tiny cap. Sticky and frothy ring lacing on the drink down. Exactly like what a great stout should look like. Smells of freshly brewed espresso, roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, some vanilla. Taste is very up front with the espresso followed up with cocoa powder, dark roasted malts, and an oak woodiness on the finish. Slight espresso/hop bitterness after each sip. Very creamy and thick in the mouth with a slight coating. Good drinkability on this rich and enjoyable brew."
"Big fan of this one."
"D - It's a sipper, for sure, but very good and one that gets better with every taste. Not at all hard to drink this on a cold winter night."
"D: All in all, higher then expected"
"D: I like the other permutations of Yeti much better, however, this was still a very worthy entry and variation on a fantastic base beer!"
"Hell. Yes."
"D - A true sipper, delicious and evolving as it warms. I think a little bit of age on a fresh batch would bring out some of the nuanced flavours that are masked by the strong coffee. Still amazing though"
"My least favorite of all the Yetis I've had so far, though. I expected more."
"D - This is one humdinger of a stout. Approachable, flavorful, delicious -- and the alcohol is almost unnoticeable. Could drink this all night."
"Scores: 5, 4, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5"
"Mouthfeel is full with a creamy amount of carbonation."
"D: This is very rich and somewhat bitter (even after a year of aging), though not very sweet. The alcohol isn't all that hot, but the flavors are quite strong and impressive. I can't imagine drinking more than one bomber of this, I'm glad I split it with a few friends. This would make a prefect desert beer and I imagine the suggested pairings are right on (wish I had some Tiramisu). I had mixed feelings going into this and while I wasn't blown away, it was a great beer. I'll definitely be looking to pick up some of the other varieties of Yeti."
"I would recommend this beer to stout lovers."
"M/D: velvet with minimal carb bite. Easily alcoholic, I couldn't drink much more than this 10oz glass. Awesome beer."
"D - I can't even believe this is 9.5%. You can't even taste the alcohol at all. Regardless of whether you can taste it or not, 9.5% is dangerous. Tread carefully."
"For drink-ability, if it was on tap, give me another. But for bottle, I'd hold off, make it a once in a while treat."
"Excellent Double Imperial Stout. Found it at Mellow Mushroom in Winston-Salem, NC. Denver always comes through and Great Divide as well. Perfect balance of chocolate deposits and bitterness and the ABV is not over powering at 9.5%. It's one you want to sip on and wish you could bite as it's rich in chocolate flavor. A must do for Stout lovers. Top five for me so far..."
"This beer is super drinkable for an Imperial Stout. Awesome overall, not sure if it beats the regular Yeti or not."
"The Espresso Yeti is a worthy variant on the regular old Yeti This is a nice cold weather sipper. The alcohol is kept in check. It's ever present but never overwhelms. Props to great divide for another tasty brew."
"D - Easy drinking big stout, the booze is very well masked. No taste is out of line and it's executed nicely overall, finishing a bomber wasn't a problem. I personally could use a tad less bitterness or this would be rated higher, but it is an Espresso Stout afterall so this is just personal preference."
"Pours pretty much black with a frothy tan head. Nose is mainly espresso with a hint of vanilla, delicious. The taste is very close with dark espresso and vanilla being the main components. Light carbonation and surprisingly drinkable for the ABV. Another stellar selection by Great Divide. Get it!"
"Cheers!"
"Pours a few shades off black, three fingers of light brown head. Mild retention and great lace. Nose of dark fruits, light vanilla and oak. Some espresso and dark chocolate when I dug a bit deeper into this, I suspect it's faded a bit. Light notes of alcohol. Taste is more prominent in terms of oak and vanilla initially, leading into some milk and dark chocolate. Some citrus hops in the late finish, coming long after the dry espresso and lingering bitterness it have long gone. Good heavy medium body, and drinkability and enjoyable overall. Thanks Alex."
"If you love coffee though I would definitely recommend this. I also recommend eating something with it because it is so profound in its espresso flavor."
"10/10"
"D - This is an awesome beer, but a little aggressive on the taste buds, don't see myself having more than one in a sitting."
"Great beer here, and a perfect after-dinner pint."
"Drinkability is very high for such an intense beer. Alcohol is noticeable but not overwhelming."
"Drinkabilty - Wow this was good. Pretty sweet but not overboard. Alcohol was high enough to keep drinkabilty from being higher. Very well balanced and a pleasure to drink. The best yeti ive had i think!"
"Creamy and lush, almost fluffy fading to some acidic twang and finishing with long, lingering bitterness. Very low carbonation, expected for the style and barrel aging however not syrupy. A big sipper of a beer but oddly drinkable. The booze and texture are mostly conducive to drinkability but the oily, roast could be a little burdening. Overall an awesome beer."
"I enjoyed this beer but I'd probably reach for a normal Yeti before this one again."
"I tried to share this beer with my girlfriend and it was a bit much for her so I'm left to finish off the bomber..this might take me a while."
"D: drinkable in so far as such a big beer can be."
"Drinkability: This is the harshest and roughest of the Yetis, but even though it is not the easiest to drink Imperial Stout, it has loads of flavor and is a very nice sipper."
"Dark and delicious. Great head retention, ok lacing but gotta love that deep mocha colored head. A nice coffee tang comes through before the oak does in the nose but seems not quite as complex as it really is upon the first sip. Drinking it almost perfectly at proper serving temp but feel like letting it warm to see just how interesting this brew is gonna get. A very tasty brew. All the usual suspects are there to comfort me; vanilla, oak, coffee, plenty of roasted malt & even some hops. Great body. The astringency that comes with the bitter coffee notes is really well balanced. Overall excellent mouthfeel for the style I'd have to say. A must try for lovers of oaked stouts, coffee stouts, vanilla porters and the like. Oh almost forgot, alcohol no where to be found in the nose, taste or mouthfeel. If it was 10.5 or 11% that might be a complement, but a 9.5% ahhhh, honestly I think there's room in this delicious brew for another couple hundred pounds of malt. Then again I'm always a fan of going bigger so take it for what it's worth."
"D: ABV is hidden well, its the coffee part that gets to me after awhile. Would love to try the normal oak aged Yeti now."
"Drinkability -- Somehow this iteration has a LOT of licorice presence (batch specific?), but the espresso is still a big improvement over the standard Oak Yeti. Either way, it's an incredibly easy-drinking Imperial Stout."
"I love Great Divide. I have yet to be disappointed by a brew by them."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this one from Great Divide. My favorite of their's so far. The smells and nose were enough to suck me in. The taste backed it up. Would definitely enjoy again!"
"I've been drinking this on tap across the Burgh, it's been money every time, creamy moccha tan head forms thick above a beligerent black body, straight up ebony. Fine speckled lacing wraps around my chalice here. Aromatics deep chocolate/coffee (iced brewed espresso beans take off) with mild alcoholic hints some anise and dark chocolate melted on the experience the best of the Barrel Aged Yeti quite possibly the best overall version. Full on flavor creamy/vanilla/oak/coffee beans explicitly barrage the palate yet it's uniform and welcoming compared to some extreme beers out there. Mouthfeel is fuller bodied carbonation is mellow smooth this beer is big but it pulls of a smooth velvet texture from all of the different components going on. Drinkability overall is incredible, my wife loved her portion from a chalice and I only had a four ounce version because I was tasting more beers than her and I was driving home."
"This pours pitch black and quite thick with an inch of dark toffee colored head that's loaded with microbubbles. The nose is spent coffee grounds upfront with sweet toasty malts laying beneath along side a bit of hoppiness. The taste of this exceptional brew is heavy on the coffee. Big time. Bitter and sweet chocolate can be tasted ending with a bitter finish. The mouthfeel is thick and full, coating the palate and leaving a long tasty aftertaste. The drinkability is moderate based on the thickness and viscosity, however, the ABV is well hidden beneath the massive coffee explosion, thus boozy undertones are not seen here."
"great divide rarely ever disappoints and this one is truly stellar, love every bit of it."
"1/1/13: Hello, old friend. Cracked open a bottle of this on New Year's day to pair with a breakfast burrito. ""Bottled on"" date read 12/13/2010. Held up great. Lots of espresso & roast character. Drinks dangerously smooth. Velvety smooth mouthfeel with a slow alcohol burn in the back of the throat. Love this beer. Wish I could find this more often so I could have it for breakfast 365 days a year."
"Its by far my favorite of the great divides selection yet."
"Smooth, complex, and delicious. Big espresso aroma and flavor. A great breakfast beer if you can handle 9.5% ABV in the am."
"Hides the booze well, but did I mention the...ah, never mind. If one were to ever encounter the walking dead, no need to fashion a weapon, just hurl this bad boy at their bloodthirsty, stake fearin' deadness."
"D- its a big beer with a big time flavor profile that can become almost overwhelming but its easy enough to drink that you find away to come back for more."
"D- a nightcap sipper that i could have 3 of. this is by far one of my favorite stouts of any variety"
"This beer pours a midnight blackness with a dark rich sexy finger of dark brown foam on the surface. The aroma has coffee notes to it and a decent level of fumes that are pungent on the nostrils. The flavor is a good mixture of dark chocolate and espresso. It reminds me of a mocha with an extra shot of espresso in it to give it that jump in bittering roast. It went down pretty smooth especially when you consider the bitterness of the malt bill involved. This is a good beer and I would have no problem with it gracing my lips with it's presence again."
"If snowed in at a small cabin, I could exist off of this beer alone for at least a week. I am fighting off the urge to post a few 5's here."
"Poured from a bomber. Dark, thick brown with no other highlights. Creamy espresso head with nice lacing. I find that there is nothing that stands out on the nose. A little espresso and chocolate. This is a great tasting brew. Dark chocolate, molasses and espresso really stand up. I was skeptical because of the espresso oak aged, but the smoothness is amazing. At 9.5%, this a as mellow as they come. Balanced, smooth and easy going. Last thing, almost zero carbonation."
"Solid beer but not my cup of tea. I am not a big coffee fan but this is ok."
"Drinkability: A great drinking stout. Not sure why I waited so long to crack this one open, but I'm glad I did. I'll be picking up some more of this the next time I see it."
"Overall a solid offering, I'd be interested to try the chocolate version, maybe it would add a little sweetness."
" Dark beer with little translucence. Initial mocha head dues quickly to retained small film. Smells of lots of cocoa, coffee, vanilla and oak (not as pronouced as anticipated). Taste is of coffee and yeti. Nice mouthfeel. Velvety. Finish is long and hard."
"Taste is just as good, dry and bitter and creamy with lots of espresso highlights. Super creamy and rich, very drinkable."
"D: Definitely a great stout, would love to have this one again!"
"D= Very easy to drink despite the ABV. It took me awhile to grab one of these (maybe I was annoyed by the hype?) but I am glad I finally tried this. I will be buying more for sure, and I think this would be a great candidate for aging."
"Overall- Great beer, another solid variation of the Yeti. Great Divide can do no wrong with this series! DO NOT age this one, the coffee, which makes this one unique, will fade."
"This is one interesting beer. I tried this one out of the bottle. This was my first great divide experience and I will definitely try some of there other offerings. The Yeti poured out very dark brown with nice lasting head, hewed somewhat reddish brown. The beer presents a very strong aroma of coffee, toasted malt, and alcohol. Upon first taste I was initially overwhelmed by the coffee, but found the flavor to be much more complex after additional sips. The bitterness of the coffee and roasted malt pervades but is accentuated by the slight oak flavor. The beer has a nice heavy mouth feel predominant in beers of this type. I enjoyed this beer, and even though not a coffee lover, can appreciate the great execution by great divide."
"D: I was thoroughly impressed with the Espresso Oak Aged Yeti. For such a flavorful and thick beer, it just danced upon my taste buds and left me wanting more without wearing my palate down; I had no trouble finishing the bottle. To note as well, the western style omelet I was eating with it paired perfectly. All in all, this is a very well crafted Imperial Stout that I will be revisiting."
"http://taylor1805.wordpress.com/2011/01/29/saturday-stout-review/"
"D: A quality offering. Could have used a little more sweetness to balance the bitterness but overall, very, very good."
"Opinion: This is a really good beer. This particular blend of Yeti is much more subtle than their other versions. They obviously have a winner with this line of beers, and this one is no exception. I would have liked the espresso to be a bit more noticeable in the flavor, but that is a fine line to walk to not over-do you with roast. I think that they played it on the safe side with this one. I would probably drink some of the others over this particular one, but this is still a damn good beer and I am thoroughly enjoying my glass."
"Glad I have another stored away. I'll have to revisit this one at the end of the year. I'm sure it'll be even better."
"D: probably my favorite Yeti... the added element of espresso seems to tie the hops in well with the big specialty grain profile."
"Notes: This is a hugely complex beer and reminds me a lot of its cousin, the Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti. I actually prefer the COAY over this one and would buy it instead if I were able to choose between the two. That being said it is still an amazing beer."
"Overall, this is another impressive offering from Great Divide. A great sipper for the winter, even if I'm in FL and it's 50 degrees. Impressed with the balance between sweet/bitter and a lovely coffee character more than anything else. I haven't had this fresh, but can only imagine that almost a year on it mellowed it out. Might be a tad too intense fresh."
"I guess I was expecting a thick, dark beer with a coffee/esperesso taste but a little bit smoother to go down."
"Drink- This took breakfast to another level. A nice stout to start a lazy Sunday with the family. It was very smooth, silky and very good."
"Definitely a sipper. Not difficult to drink, just very demanding of your time."
"D - Wonderful Imperial stout in the Callie tradition, which is to say, non-traditional, very drinkable and full of flavor. Highly recommended."
"D- Great to sip on and would like to have some more!"
"A very solid beer. Somewhat austere, not as lush as the chocolate version, but also not as straight up woody as the regular oak version (which I'm not a huge fan of). That one is simply a demonstration of using too much oak. This one pours black with a tan head that fades just a little too quickly. Smells toasty with oak and espresso and a touch of cream. The roasty notes of the coffee and stout blend nicely. The taste is quite dry, with more of a woody austerity than a lush creaminess. Full coffee notes, with a nice flavor, but not exceedingly bitter or over the top. Instead you get a nice lingering roasty bitterness, some bitter chocolate, and a touch of cream, with the oak drying things out and playing a supporting role. A little unbalanced, but enjoyable. A little woody in the mouth, and quite bitter. A sipper, would be a good dessert beer to cleanse the palate."
"D- Just keep serving it on tap, and I'll be there"
"Drinkability: good going down like a shot of espresso maybe a shareable drink with a friend after a long, cold, winter day"
"D - I don't often feel this way about American Imperial Stouts anymore, but I am going to say that this is craft brewing at it's best, extreme, classic, and a work of art. Plenty of expressive flavors, with great balance and fantastic use of the different ingredients. It's not just a great barrel aged beer, not just a great coffee stout, and not just a great big imperial stout, but all combined to make a well planned and executed beer."
"Poured on tap, 12oz pour. Appears black in color, with a dark brown head. This is one bad mutha, and you can tell from how impenetrably dark it is. Aromas of a starbucks cafe at 8:00 in the morning. Espresso, chocolate, roasted coffee and malts. In the flavor, some vanilla, espresso and dark chocolate. Roasted malts. A beauty of a brew and well worth the purchase. Reccommended to coffee lovers, barrel aged fans, and the beer geek. Would love to pair this with some pancakes."
"D: a great expression of a top notch stout. Definitely worth a grab."
"an easy bottle to the head, but at the sametime im glad my friends got to expierience this great beer. this is easily one of my favorite stouts and so far my favorite yeti. a must have, and i think freshness is key with this one if you want all that good coffee."
"Notes: Probably my favorite Yeti to date. Set that faint rawness aside and this is a brew to keep in mind. It is going to make me consider revisiting the regular and oak aged yeti that I have had set aside from my landscape for a couple for years now."
"D -Highly recommended beer from this user. Easy to sit back and drink a few of these..."
"D - A highly drinkable beer. I'd love to snag one of these in a bottle if I can find it at a local shop. I'd definitely recommend this to people as well."
"Incredible beer, I love Yeti, but the espresso aging smoothes away the sharp alcohol notes from normal Yeti and adds a wonderful coffee component."
"Very drinkable and dangerous. Don't really taste the alcohol. But it starts to hit you after the first glassful. Very nice beer."
"Drinkability: The flavors blend well together. Definitely a tasty treat. Lots of espresso, and I do like my coffee."
"I would try again if I found a fresh bottle this spring."
"Lots of coffee character--even more than I expected--but I found this Yeti version to be a little one-dimensional and I didn't get as much of the oak character as I would have liked. Still, a really nice stout that I'd certainly revisit...very smooth and drinkable with a well-hidden alcohol kick."
"This is the kind of beer you would either drink at 6am waiting in line for DLD or if you were falling asleep while drinking to perk you back up. I could have easily drank a bomber of it."
"Drink, Very impressed first time ive had this! Would definetly recommend this to anybody. I will be getting alot more of this."
"I tried a sample of regular oak aged Yeti at the same time and found that the espresso really added a lot to a beer that was already pretty great."
"Pours that dark, used motor oil black that I always look for in an RIS. Pour produces a huge, creamy, brown sugar colored head that leaves some chunky lacing as it goes. Scent is roasty with some obvious chocolate and coffee notes. Taste is bold and interestingly subtle. Big roasted malts and chocolate flavors. The oak and espresso are faint but definitely there and provide an excellent accent to an already good RIS, the oak is a bit more prominent in the finish. Also a faint hop bite towards the finish. Mouthfeel is heavy but creamy smooth, not overly sticky or cloying at all. Surprisingly drinkable for such a big beer. Couldn't help myself, had to drink this one as soon as I picked it up, will definitely be picking up some more to age."
"A nicely done imperial stout. The base beer combined with the oak and coffee work very well together. Looking forward to trying the other varieties."
"D - Excellent. Eventually the abv would trip me up, but otherwise I'd be content to sip this all night."
"D: with more carbonation and slightly lower alcohol it would be crazy drinkable."
"This was certainly worth trying, but there are better coffee stouts out there to be sure."
"Excellent, almost breaking through to phenomenal. Gotta ding it a smidge for the charcoal flavors coming up at the end."
"Solid beer, love it. Wish i bought a 2nd bomber to put in the beer cellar."
"After the extremely odd design decision to add cayenne pepper to Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti, Espresso Oak Aged Yeti gets the outstanding Yeti train solidly back on the tracks to outstanding flavor and drinkability. Once again, the base Yeti proves to be bulletproof. Hey Great Divide, how about Bacon Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout to test that theory?"
"Smells great, right away the coffee and chocolate, toasty, nutty, vanilla, with hints of caramel. Alot of things going on in this beer. Black, dark black if there is such a thing. Head is brownish tan, frothy, with lacing at the end. This is definitely a very good imperial stout with a deeper taste on the coffee, lots of it. What you smell is what you will taste. Bitterness is high but is great with this kind of beer. Full bodied, creamy, malty, intense beer. This is a great imperial stout, next time will try with breakfast!"
"this stout has a nice creamy mouthfeel that is surprisingly not too heavy and is pretty drinkable"
"D - Dangerously drinkable.  No alcohol burn, and balanced.  A great offering from Great Divide-- try this."
"excellent imperial stout. great choice for the nor'easter!!"
"D: For a self-proclaimed espresso stout, this one's really faded with age. Don't get much coffee here which I really don't mind. A rather hoppy offering overall. A solid member of the yeti family. Worth trying."
"D: A decent Imperial Stout, but as with the other Yetis, this just does not impress me that much. I feel like the coffee addition just serves to make this brew a little too bitter, rather than adding substantially to the flavor. Still, like I said, it is decent and I won't complain about having to finish the bomber."
"D-This beer was excellent and it seemed like it's execution was effortless.Maybe a touch sweet to warrant a drinkability score above 4."
"Impression: My favorite of the Yeti's so far. Can't wait to taste this with a bit of age."
"D: Again, no notes as to this aspect, but I clearly remember a remarkably easy experience."
"Future outlook: I have had the Oak Aged Yeti (both fresh and aged) and ""regular"" Yeti, and though all of them were decent, this one easily triumphed over those other variants. Definitely worth a repeat."
"D: yum"
"Conclusion: This beer holds its own. A very interesting example of this varied style. I would love to see what a few years of age would do to this, although loosing the coffee flavor over that amount of time is a risk. My ideal stout would have more oak (what was here was overpowered by the hops and coffee) and less hops. Minor details aside, this is one of the best stouts (or any beers for that matter) to fill my glass."
"D: Definitely better than the regular oaked version, but not one of my favorite imperial stouts. Decent enough beer, though."
"Good mouthfeel, thick , chewy and bitter. Nice brew. A sipper."
"D- That iron man... it truly ruined what probably would have been a solid beer overall. It barely scrapes its act together in other areas. I'm happy to be reducing part of this beer for a glaze... prevents some consumption at least."
"Notes: Had the DFH Bitches Brew last night for the first time, this one tonight for the first time. Both are excellent Double/Imperial Stouts, but I think I like this one a tad bit more. . . ."
"I've enjoyed all the variations of YETI so far, add Oak-Aged Espresso to the list."
"D - Considering the variables (complex taste, alcohol content), not bad. However, at 9.5% it drinks more like a 12 or 14% stout in my opinion"
"CHEERS!!"
"Pours a thick midnight black with a nice brown head that diminishes rather quickly. Scent is very woody with a mellow espresso aroma. Lots of chocolate and sweetness in the nose as well. Taste is initially sweet vanilla and chocolate flavors followed by awesome woody espresso flavors. It end with more sweetness and a surprising hop profile. Very delicious tasting beer! Mouthfeel is pretty thick, but not as thick as I was expecting. Very drinkable though. This was my second Yeti beer (only had original Yeti before this), and I have to say that I am very impressed by these brews."
"Poured from a bottle into a Bruery tulip. On first pour the beer appears thick and viscous with about a one inch head that dissipated shortly after the pour. The head has a nice stouty brown color to it. The beer smells of all malt, sweetness and some faint coffee aroma. This is a very smooth beer for 9.5%. The oak aging definitely helps to round it out a bit. This is a sweet beer but deceptively little alcohol taste comes through. The espresso hits you up front with a lingering malty finish with tastes of vanilla. The beer does not taste as viscous as it looks. This is a full bodied beer but it does not feel as thick and oily as I was expecting, There is a little bit of viscosity on the tongue, but not a lot. This beer is very drinkable for 9.5%. My beer was bottled on 4/2/10 (cheers for date stamps!), I am enjoying this fine beer almost seven months post bottling and if anything I think it was too soon. This is a beer that I think would only improve with some more time as the flavors round out and meld together. I will have to buy another bottle to age."
"Unfortunately, for me, this beer didn't do it. I am, for the record, I'm a huge fan of great divide beers. Always will be. maybe i got a bad bottle, maybe not. I have another that I will try later and edit if necessary. The color of this beer is awsome, the head is excellent. the taste is also excellent. However, I had coffee been ""chunks"" in my bottle. Not happy with this at all. This just shouldn't exist in a good beer . Sorry."
"And I didn't drink it with any of the main Thanksgiving dishes, but my God, grabs hold of the pumpkin and pecan pies I am pairing it with and takes me off to gastronomical heaven. Now, about trying it with that breakfast burrito recommended on the label. Hmmmm..."
"Drinkability is pretty good. It's a weighty stout, both in ABV and feel, so you won't be pounding this down by any means. I think I'll have to have one fresh to really fully appreciate the espresso flavoring, but this wasn't a bad brew at all. Yetis have never let me down yet."
"D: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this beer is exactly what the name tells you it is, a coffee-enhanced version of one of the better big stouts out there IMO. Overall it's well-worth drinking for a long time if you're in the mood for a big coffee-flavored stout."
"Great Divide certainly know how to brew some great stouts. The Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout was excellent. From the rich black pour bursting of bittersweet chocolate, hops, malts, maple, and coffee, to the full bodied taste of dark roasted espresso, chocolate, mocha, and malts makes this one exceptional. If you can find it, PICK IT UP AND GET TO THE CHOPPER...NOW! BLAU!"
"D- A little bit hot at times, but the alcohol is mostly well hidden. Glad to see both namesake ingredients (oak and espresso) make an appearance on my palette. OK balance here but the bitter, dark espresso sort of becomes the dominant flavor after awhile. I enjoyed this, but it didn't really wow me."
"Definitely an ""as advertised"" version of the Yet Imperial Stout here, with that lush and robust espresso character being both strengthened and tempered by the addition of those oak chips. Very easy drinking for the size as well, I could actually see one pairing this up with breakfast if the mood was right."
"D - I'm sharing this bottle with my girlfriend. We don't often drink a lot of stouts so we definitely see it is a sipper."
"At 9.5%, this beer could easily be drank again and again. Just not too much in one night."
"D - This is a delicious imperial coffee stout. Another well-done version of Yeti."
"The mouthfeel is thick and rewarding. It's like dessert and breakfast in a glass. At 9.5%, it's not a beer you'll drink more than one of, but one is probably more than enough to make you happy."
"Overall I didn't really taste that much more coffee and oak on this one. Still a good imperial stout though."
"D - A little huge on the coffee, it's a roasted bitter that's a little strong. The alcohol kicks you later on but it's mostly hidden."
"Drinkability - I don't think I've ever had a beer that would go better with a cigar than this one. Having said that, it was a little too artificial to stand as one of my all-time favorite but a great beer nevertheless."
"D = Drinks surprisingly well for the monster it is."
"Taste showcases more oak and slightly more semi-tart fruit. Coffee flavor smooths out some, but is still the main flavor showcased. Classic Yeti chocolate maltiness layers the palate on the back end. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy - bold. Drinks surprisingly smooth, but still has some rough hop and alcohol edges. Understated sweetness jumps out as it warms. A lot going on here, almost too much...I think I prefer the regular Yeti to this one. Fun to try though."
"D: Very nice, though I don't think that this differs that greatly from the original yeti. The espresso and oak are present though very subtle, I feel like this is a bit more balanced that the oak aged yeti, but I think the chocolate wins."
"A solid coffee stout, but not one that ranks with the best."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into my Ommegang Goblet. Short pour, and still got a nice finger of brown head. Black like the dark ages. Smells - Bourbon off the bat, roast coffee, almost smells milky like a cappucino. Gettin some chocolate and vanilla as well. The taste - if I could give this higher than 5 I would. Sweet milky espresso drink. Tastes like a coffee nip with a shot of bourbon poured on top. The tastes just hangs on. Will probably be on my tongue after I die. Nice bitter burnt coffee flavor. Stupidly drinkable given the alcohol. Lord oh lord."
"Overall, I really wish I had a case of this amazing brew. Perfect stout for anyone venturing into the bigger beers, and definitely sets a baseline for all espresso infused stouts of its kind. The combination of the espresso/oak chip aging and a semi-aggressive hop bill make this stout a home run."
"D- maybe a little too bitter...maybe a little too thick...maybe a little too flavorful...its a total sipper, but its damn good. Really enjoy this one"
"Cheers!"
"OVERALL: Another fantastic creation by Great Divide. The Yeti series continues to impress, and the Espresso version is not only a great addition to the series, it's one of the best coffee stouts around. One worth picking up in bunches, as well as comparing to some of the more limited coffee stouts around. One I will be glad to have again. Thanks for exporting your stuff overseas guys."
"wish i had a chocolate cake to eat with this, i would be happier more."
"draft at ChurchKey"
"I poured from a bomber into a snifter. Jet black in color with an above average tan head. It smells like you walked into a starbucks. Lots of esspresso flavor, hints of chocolate and vanilla, no oak. It finishes with bitter coffee. Full in body and well carbonated. A good coffee stout."
"D - very drinkable, incredible smooth. the coffee flavor is a nice twist on regular yeti, if that's what you are in the mood for that day."
"Drinkable in the sense that it's smooth and not overpowering with it's Imperial-ness. It might take me a while to drink it though. I almost want to drop some ice cream in it."
"D - A very good well rounded beer with sweetness and some savory bitterness. Something to drink during the fall/winter after a hard days work."
"D: it drank pretty damn good and I waiting to rate this beer till I opened up a bomber to the head. Really happy to see great divide in So Cal."
"Pours jet black with three fingers dark carmel head. Aroma is very ballanced coffee and chocolate, with little to oakiness. Little to no alcohol nose to this brew at 9.5%. Taste has only slight hop bitterness. Vanilla and oak flavors are subtle and welcoming. Mouthfeel is creamy and dissipates quickly. Overall this is an exceptional brew. My Yeti was bottled on Feb 12 2010, i feel this beer will age very well. i will definately buy more."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Great full body, creamy, luscious mouthfeel. Drinkability is okay, the alcohol is hidden nicelyl. Very nice beer overall, as are all the Yetis."
"Overall an amazing beer that goes great with the music I am enjoying: two cow garage, a melancholy drunken country punk band."
"D: Wow, I would not guess this is a 9.5% abv beer. I drink coffee 5 or more times a week and really enjoyed the way they combined it with this beer. So glad this beer is now distributed in California."
"D: This is a big one for sure. Not as integrated and balanced as Peche Mortel, the coffee isn't trying to be cute; it's a coffee beer and you know it. I don't drink coffee in my day to day life, but I do enjoy it in beer, but this was almost too much for me at times, hence the 3. Definitely an experience, be careful, this one can stain your clothes, I learned that first hand."
"In the end, I felt like there were too many dimensions built into the beer. The oak and stout flavors ended up being muted while the espresso and hops too over. It was still good, but I prefer the normal or oak aged yeti. Either way, I was wired after this brew."
"Definitely one of the best complex Imperial Stouts I've tasted."
"Pours jet black with a brown head. In the aroma, coffee, oak, and bourbon notes. In the taste, dry coffee, quite oaky, and a chocolate like end. A smooth and medium to big bodied mouthfeel, with a dry coffee and small bourbon like aftertaste. Big coffee, nice bourbon/ oaky notes and hides the ABV."
"D - Delicious and very much a great great American Double Stout."
"Drinkability: Very good considering the heaps of flavor and high ABV. Oak. Oak. AND Oak. Yeti brews several very good stouts in this line. I will buy this one again, definitely."
"DB- A very flavorful beer. The oak cannot be missed in this ale. Great meld of caramel, oak and roast malt with some coffee. I would prefer a bit more espresso and a bit less oak but I still love the flavor of this one."
"Yeti Rules."
"Overall, significantly better than the chocolate yeti. Good beer that I would have again. Would like to have fresher next time, so the espresso would take an even bigger role."
"D: Delicious tasting and well done but like most I cant a lot of RIS in the summer. Great beer and will pick another up again in the future"
"Damn this is good. Really good. Probably my favorite of the Yetis, and that's saying a lot cuz I love 'em all. Will definitely grab this fresh next year for a more intense coffee experience."
"this beer pours a dark black color with a nice tan head befitting the espresso name. the smell combines the dark malt and coffee aroma very nicely, hiding the hops a little bit. the vanilla flavor from the oak works well smoothing out the coffee and dark malt. the full body and good carbonation make this a very drinkable imperial stout."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a 1/2"" brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome! It has a dry, expresso scent along with a rich, black and chocolate malt aroma. It has a bitter black malt, coffee feel. The taste is great as well. It has a dry, expresso flavor up front with some chocolate malt notes. It goes down easy with minimal warming and a nice subtle oak finish. This is a complex beer with lots going on. The expresso character is quite pronounced. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tremendous beer. I'm a huge fan of the coffee flavor."
"Lots of alcohol and a moderate to large mouthfeel make this a tasty beverage, very happy I got to try it."
"D - I couldn't drink more than one. I'm not a fan of coffee, but I do enjoy Imperial Stouts and this is definitely worth checking out. I'd have to say this is the biggest and strongest coffee flavored beer I've had to date."
"D- finished off a whole bomber by myself and I the only way I can tell its 9.5% is BC I'm a little buzzed. Alcohol is no where in sight when your enjoying only when You're finished!"
"I would say this has average drinkability for a 9+% ABV drink with a nod toward its overall appeal."
"I wanted to like this beer a lot, and my high expectations probably influenced my enjoyment of this beer for the worst. I did like it, but I was far from crazy about it. I'll drink it again in a different situation, but I'm not in any rush to try this again."
"This is a pretty good Imperial Stout, though I felt that the prominence of the coffee did detract from the complexity of this beer. I would like to see what some age would do to this."
"D: share with a friend if possible, and pair with a creamy dessert (even something as simple as vanilla ice cream) for a nice contrast. After a few sips I definitely can feel it. Would definitely serve this as a closer in a flight, and I will also seek out the other oak-aged Yeti variations."
"Overall, I enjoyed the Espresso Oak Aged Yeti. I like coffee as much as the next guy, but it almost got to be a bit much as it overpowered other scents and tastes. I don't regret buying the bottle, but I don't know if I'd rush out and buy another. There are several other imperial stouts that I enjoy more."
"9/22/12 update: Cellared another bottle (from the same bottling) and finally got around to it. This one definitely improves with age--softening and smoothing the edges. Smooth, sweet, and luscious now. In hindsight, drinking this one 4 1/2 months after bottling wasn't the smartest thing to do. Current rating would be 4.5/4/4/4.5/4."
"Overall I would have it again, not my go to beer, but depending in the occasion...I prefer the Great Divide Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout if I have to pick one to buy."
"I had the opportunity to try both this beer and the chocolate oak aged yeti on tap to try side by side, and I have to say this version is quite a bit smoother and more drinkable. The aroma is much bigger and more appealing. I have not tried any other versions of this terrific beer, but I will definately be on the lookout. Just a terrific beer..."
"D: Only OK."
"D: As much as I really LOVE this beer, it is still an Imperial Stout! One glass is enough for me, two tops (ask agent munky about man gulping this beer, not fun but delicious). I highly recommend this beer especially to coffee lovers. Another stout worthy of the title Yetti."
"D- Drinkability is hindered by the overwhelming bitterness and astringency. This is definitely a beer worth tasting... but not worth drinking 22oz. of..."
"D - Don't get any alcohol in this, so drinkable, but not a huge fan of it enough to seek it out."
"Drinkability: very tempted to try this for breakfast."
"D: Like all of Great Divide's Yetis, this one is very tasty and incredibly drinkable."
"Flavors come wrapped in a pleasant alcoholic warmth. Light espresso bitter, molasses tang: flavors cut through the thick, heavy, sweet malt. Mouthfeel is full and viscous: tar-like."
"Had a bottle at the GD tap room. While appearance and feel were both very solid for style, the taste was a bit overloaded with coffee for my liking. I haven't had a coffee stout in a while, however, the coffee was so overpowering, it became difficult to overlook this aspect. Coffee was definitely front and center on the nose, but I still picked up a good deal of crusty bread and roast qualities from the malt. While I think a little time in the cellar will make this one a knockout, as of this tasting the coffee makes this almost too one note in terms of flavor profile."
"Drinks: the strong espresso and oak flavors create an interesting blend that totally gels with my palate. It's heavily, but not undrinkably so. My favorite iteration of the aged yetis."
"Overall this is a great beer. It definitely has some more moving parts compared to the regular Yeti. I actually prefer the regular one a little more."
"D. My favorite of the Yeti beers thus far. Great Divide did well here."
"After retrying this beer I need to say that it is great when paired appropriately. Still it is a little hard to get down because of how rich it is but nonetheless it is tasty."
"While I don't at all mind it, I'd prefer to drink this in an amount smaller than a pint - maybe a 4-5oz pick-me-up, as it were. Yeti could shine here; instead, the espresso trumps it."
"Taste is much more nuanced. It leads with roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, the vanilla and oak approach through the middle, espresso is tempered but there, the ending has traces of hop oils mixed with oak saturated roasted caramels. The mouth is delightful, velvety smooth while retaining enough carbonation to keep it lively, full body and slick and sticky but not overbearing (even at nearly 10% abv). Its a great sipper, but could indeed go well with a hearty breakfast (as per the bottle), or perhaps a trip to the cabin as an accompaniment to a relaxing evening by the fire. Whatever your motivation, its an excellent beer."
"D - while I love both coffee and Stouts, this one is very heavy. Probably could only have a couple and would be full."
"M: Leaves a creamy rich mouthfeel on the palate."
"- Overall a huge stout with great flavor... would age well and is only slightly warming with about 4 months on it."
"D: I'd say that this is the best of the Yeti series by a good margin Fair warning, though. If you don't like coffee, stay far away. Then again, if you don't like coffee, you probably don't care for imperial stouts in the first place."
"Bottle date says 2/12/2010. Pitch black hue. Bronze two finger head. Smells of chocolate dipped coffee beans, amazing aroma. Minimal carbonation leads way to a cream full, but not dense, body. Roasted flavors not too overbearing, the coffee is taking the lead. What is nice is that this beer has it's flavors under control. I don't have a hard time telling apart the coffee flavors from the stout. Sticky sensations lingers on my lips while it feels like I just took a sip of coffee. There a little hint of wood in the bite. it blends with the coffee, it takes a few sips to realize the oak is there. It's a good blend, not the best, but pleasant enough. This here seems like one of the few specialty beers that has its additions under control. I definitely imagined this beer being a little more over the top (super roasty, hoppy, just brutal) but I'm glad it wasn't. At 9.5% don't wait for this beer to age, it's good now."
"Mouthfeel full bodes, gummy, chewy, and delicious."
"D - Pretty good brew. Nice full flavor. Would go good with breakfast food. Would pick this one up again."
"Smooth, rich, and creamy, despite the appearance, this one isn't too heavy to handle. It's a pretty good dessert beer, though it would not be my first choice. It is incredibly sweet, and really, aside from the syntheticness of the coffee flavors, I really enjoyed this beer."
"D: The beer is particularly easy to drink and the alcohol isn't really perceptible in the smell or taste."
"Poured into a pint glass and built up a 2 finger mocha colored head that disappeared quickly with no traces of lacing, jet black. Smells just like the name implies, heavy expresso presence followed by roasted malts, oak flavor lingers in the background and is pretty subtle. Extreme expresso flavor, a little too much for me but not bad, followed by a well pronounced roasted malt flavor backed by a little bit of oakiness. Medium bodied, medium carbonated beer that goes down pretty smoothly. Very easy to drink but the expresso taste is a little strong for me."
"Considering the abv on this its still very drinkable and makes ya feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside"
"An expresso coffee experience. Well crafted with few flaws for what it is, but what it is I inrinsically am not super interested in. A little sweet, but overall bittersweet chcolate and roast and coffee. Thick black body and foam. Big expresso and some chocolate aroma."
"Vintage: 2010 Served from tap into an imperial pint. Pours black with a tan one finger head that lingers. Maintains nice lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt and coffee beans. The flavor was of malt and massive coffee. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall it was a pretty nice for a coffee flavored Russian Imperial Stout. The coffee was overwhelming in flavor though and most likely covered up a lot of the subtle flavors that might have been present. However it was still quite enjoyable and this is coming from a non-coffee drinker."
"D - Another excellent beer in the long line of GD Yeti Stouts. I would buy this one over and over again."
"This is one of my all-time favorite beers."
"I have had Yeti, Oak Aged, and Chocolate, by far the best Yeti in my opinion (haven't had BA though)."
"D: Balanced brew and quite complex. Could be good to have quite a lot of it."
"M/D: Mouthfeel is smooth, carbonation is low. An excellent coffee stout."
"D: The ABV is well hidden and it goes down remarkably smooth...as usual, I'm left wishing that Great Divide was available in San Diego."
"I knew I'd find Bigfoot (or, at least, his Asiatic cousin) in DC! I mean, how many other elusive hairy beasts reside here? (Now that's good- er...actually pretty crappy political commentary. Sorry. I'll try harder next time.) Regardless, I was pleasantly surprised to find this cryptozoologically-inspired brew on tap here at CK. It pours pitch darkness into the glass, with a sad excuse for a dirty bubbly head. (Apparently one of Mermaid Man's nemeses procreated and settled atop my beer.) The smell is of darkly roasted coffee (I know, I'm shocked too), chocolate, and a tiny bit o' smoked oak. The full picture is of an espresso machine powered by a camper's stone-ringed fire. (Clearly, I have no idea how an espresso machine works.) When the 'buds get at it, the coffee lightens up a bit, apparently loosened by that tactfully tasteful joke. The chocolate comes back, followed by some cream (half-and-half, I think), dark malts, and some o' that oak from before, only lighter and sans fumee. The body is heavy, but lighter than other hefty brews'. The carbonation is moderate at best, and a slight coating is found along my mouth's walls, allowing a bit o' aftertatse to linger a spell. Now, if only this ape-like creature weren't so damn elusive..."
"If you like coffee beers, you'll love this. If not, just stick with the OAY."
"Very drinkable this is a very nice imperial stout from Great Divide."
"Excellent following a meal. A real dessert. I am tempted to try it with ice cream."
"Deep brown with thick tan head. Tons of lacing down the glass. Smells strongly of coffee and hints of the oak. Coffee is very up front in the taste, which nicely compliments the deep roasted malt. Extremely creamy and wonderful to drink. Perfect morning beer."
"Excellent beer, enjoyed on a hot day in the sun and it didnt seem out of place."
"D- No question this one is drinkable, not much alcohol presence."
"Drinkability is fantastic. Quite a flavorful brew that goes down nice and easy. Just about on par with that standard oak aged Yeti and a great choice for the style I'd say. I would certainly have it again. Now I just need to find the chocolate version and I'll be set."
"Overall, a really impressive and smooth stout. The flavors are well balanced and everything blends so well together. A really exceptional beer in my opinion."
"D- I was hoping for a little better of a coffee taste. The oak added nicely to this beer. I really want to try all the Yeti varieties."
"Notes: Not my favorite Yeti offering and a little disappointed since I was looking forward to this one so much. Certainly worth a try though."
"The initial flavor is good and its drinkable, although on the extreme burnt and bitter side, but as I got to bottom of the glass the oak just became more and more apparent, and not in a good way. Found it almost hard to finish with the strong cloying oak finish."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer at first, but when it warmed the oak flavor comes on so strong that it detracts of the rest of the flavor."
"Overall a very good RIS. The Yeti series has yet to dissapoint me. I think the original Yeti is still my favorite but this one is a close second."
"Grandeur! A style that has exploded into the heights of perfection; namely Goose Island and Founders. A wonderful interpretation; chocolatey crisp body, sweet frappacino cream center, mocha...no booze in sight, except for on my palate, which may skew. Vanilla Banilla touch? Excellent. Estupendo. I'd pop one with squemish macro folks....they'd dig it. Congratulatso."
"Pours cola-black with dissipating cinnamon head. Aroma of Coke float with chocolate ice cream and some brownies and coffee/toffee. Flavors of dark chocolate, cola, coffee, cinnamon, slight bourbon. Medium-thick body with a soda feel. So the Yeti went to Starbucks and confused us all. A nice brew but sometimes the original can't be beat."
"Pours a beautiful opaque black with a dark brown head. Lacing is amazingly layered all the way through the beer. Smells of coffee, esspresso, maybe a faint whiff of chocolate. Taste of esspresso, woddy, sharp, bitter, coffee, some earthy hop flavors. Full bodied. More alcohol burn than I expected."
"Had on tap at the Hulmeville Inn, PA. A nice chocolatey head and an inpenetrable dark colour to this beer. Aromas of chocolate and coffee (obviously) from this beer- smells like a rich, sweet tiramisu. The booze is well hidden in this beer, drinks way below it's ABV and is quite literally the most delicious Impy that I've ever tasted."
"The mouthfeel is fairly thick and smooth. Not much of a carbonated feel on the tongue. The drinkability is great - I can really finish a bomber by myself, but I think the caffeine would be a bit much, especially at this time of night. Tasty, pleasant and smooth. All ideal in a stout. By far, my fave Yeti out of the set."
"D- easy to finish. i wish the full yeti line was available in my area. we just get the regular and the oak aged one. oh well, i guess ill just have to look forward to picking this up when i go to visit my sister."
"This is the kind of beer you would either drink at 6am waiting in line for DLD or if you were falling asleep while drinking to perk you back up. I could have easily drank a bomber of it."
"D-this is a very drinkable stout, it doesn't show any alcohol and has good malt backbone. Decent complexity and a nice bit of espresso. the oak aging doesn't really seem to show, but good none the less."
"Drinkability: Such a good beer to enjoy during the evening. Really good with the age on it, will definitely buy 3-4 more bottles to sit on."
"Price = $12.49 at Joe Canal's"
"Easily the best of the available Yeti lineup... I exclude Barrel aged Yeti from that statement, because there are only 1100 bottles or so, and therefore it isn't really available."
"D - Very enjoyable beer right here, but if you are not a coffee drinker, this will be overwhelming. Coiffee is still a little hot..."
"D: Excellent! Over a year after bottling and it had aged nicely."
"Like any version of Yeti I've had so far with a bit of age on it, either cellared or Oak Aged by the brewery this beer is very drinkable. I could easily forget sipping and just take deep quaffs of this beer. As good as these OA versions are I must wonder about the BA versions. I do highly recommend this Yeti!"
"Pours a nice black with super dark brown edges, dense two finger medium brown head, thin sheets of lace. Smell: roasty with a big hit of very robust coffee, a little mossy and woodsy, earthy with a hint of spruce, chocolate in the back. Taste: bam the coffee hits upfront, giving way to some more roastiness and chocolate, earthy and citric hops, finishes with even more coffee and a some bitter chocolate. The coffee seems to have thinned the feel out a bit vs. regular Yeti. Very good coffee impy stout."
"Side note: why are some coffee stouts almost triple the cost of well... Starbucks?"
"Pours a motor oil black out of 22oz bomber, the head resembles thick, foamy chocolate milk. It smells like morning, coffee and cream. The flavor starts with milk chocolate and cocoa on the tongue, then a shot of espresso hits on the back of the palate. It is full bodied, yet quite complex and delivers an interplay of sweet and bitter elements. As far as java based beers go, it's quite drinkable. I thoroughly enjoyed it, as I have all incarnations of the Yeti."
"Yeti is like the blank canvas of RIS', and it lends itself much better to this kind of mellow coffee treatment than to bourbon aging."
"D - only fault here is that after awhile, it can be a bit much. but, i still love it. not graceful, subtle, or complex by any means just yummy. want this with breakfast every day!"
"D- would drink again. easy to somewhat medium drinking. would assume to see as a higher class place offering this beer. sort of hard to drink if you are not used to bitter or stouts. but will take time to drink through the glass."
"A great sipper, one which I will definitely have again, perhaps when it gets cooler outside."
"Hard to grade this beer. I mean, I don't like it. BUt, I can see that on a certain level it did achieve what it set out to do. After 2-3 oz, I basically didn't want to drink it."
"I've only had one other Yeti variation (oak-aged), and it was quite enjoyable. I will certainly seek out the others, but can't recommend the espresso version. I may grab a botttle or 2 to throw in the cellar to see if it improves with time."
"As much as I like stouts, this one was simply average to me."
"D- I dont really like really hoppy stouts. This one was simply average to me."
"I will drink this one again. There is a certain fudgy quality to this beer that I have the rare chance to experience. I would love to share this with my wife when we meet back up in a few weeks and would reccomend it for anybody looking for the proper breakfast beer."
"Drinkability: slow drinking beer and the bomber is a great single session beer for an evening. Great for a dessert beer."
"D- Deliciously smooth brew. Complex flavors and a great job on the espresso taste and the smooth mouthfeel. Hard to keep my glass on the coaster."
"D: The stout is robust but it deosn't feel like a 10% brew. The coffee and stout flavors work nicely together."
"Pours a very black color, with a fairly nice sized brown head. Heavy aromas of bitter, burnt coffee, espresso and roasted malt. On the palate, the aforementioned coffee clearly dominates, along with dark chocolate, vanilla and just a hint of oak. Balance seems a little off, with an overbearing coffee flavor."
"From a bomber into a pint glass. This bottle in particular was fresh only being bottled one month ago. Pours pitch black with a really nice big dark brown head, just the way a good stout should look. The head has great retention, there till almost the last drop. Leaves great lacing all the way down the glass. The smell right away for me was surprisingly chocolate followed by coffee/espresso. There was also a big roasted malt flavor as well as hints of vanilla. The taste was chocolate and coffee. A huge coffee/espresso after taste. Roasted malt was also big in the taste. Not as much coffee flavor as I was expecting as some reviews say it's too much but I found it to be almost perfect. Not overpowering by any means. The mouthfeel was perfect for a stout, thick and mildly chewy. High ABV which was nicely hidden. A very drinkable stout. Another beer from the Yeti family that is fantastic. I've got another one in the cellar thats got over a year on it so I'm anxious to see how it's aged compared to this fresh one. Though I'm going to pick up some more fresh ones as well."
"Overall this is another wonderful Yeti variation from Great Divide. Recommended."
"Close to a finger of dark brown sludge masquerading as foam, really just looks like the top of a chocolate milkshake, lacing has good stickiness even as the head dissolves. Jet black liquid, consistency of motor oil, nary a hint of color to be found. The nose explodes with coconut, sweeter espresso bean, dark chocolate, toffee and butterscotch, the roast is a little lower than expected leading to a sweeter overall profile, raisin bread to rum raisin ice cream, cinnamon stick, almost obligatory feel to the pine and grass notes, as if I guess we have to use hops here don't we. Full-bodied, thick and dense, the carbonation makes a decent showing of it but nowhere near able to rouse the slumbering beast. Coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, vanilla bean, licorice and butterscotch predominate, more roast leads to a drier mouth feel if not the same in terms of flavors. Allowing for this, the bread, wheat, oat flavors have a welcome place. Given its weight smooth enough and doesn't betray any alcoholic burn."
"M: This is a thick brew with a minimal carbonation element. Suits me just fine. I can't get the feeling that there is some half and half in here out of my head."
"D - This beer is a bit much, strong flavor for a one-trick pony. Second-tier stout at best."
"Overall, this was a very good, but not great coffee stout. I wish it had a little more sweet in the start and oak on the end to balance out the coffee."
"Overall this is an excellent beer. once my favorite stouts hands down and my favorite out of the Yeti lineup."
"This is a splendid imperial stout and probably the best Great Divide beer I've ever had."
"Poured a dark black color with good carbonationa nd nice big brown head. Looked great. Nose of espresso,chocolate,woodiness, and roasty. Taste is wood roasty, espresso, chocolate, and lighter vanilla. Mouthfeel has a oak, wood flavor on the end with a charred note coupled with espresso, light booze. Very good."
"D: Great beer in small quantities. The intense, sweet coffee limits my consumption of this brew. A must try for all coffee/beer lovers."
"The varieties of Oak Aged Yeti are life-changing. This notion is something I must credit an employee where I bought this Espresso Oak Aged version. She was right. It's a sweet, bitter, dark coffee treat. Oak Aged Yeti is the ultimate Imperial Stout. I prefer it without the added coffee; however it's still a darn good experience."
"D- This has always been my favorite of the Yeti's. Big flavors and big alcohol brings this crushing beer to only one glass or two. This should be on a lot of peoples lists for a beer to try. Not for the weak of heart...that's for sure!"
"Winner; Oak Aged Yeti for a more balanced and less intense flavor"
"drinkability: my god, drink it."
"Mouthfeel is on the thicker side with lower carbonation. It has a very nice creamy mouthfeel to it that I really like in my stouts. Drinkability is good, despite the bold espresso flavors it really is a pretty smooth and delicious beer. Excellent imperial stout in my opinion."
"Worth a try if you are fan of the Yeti stouts."
"The beer pours black with a medium brown head. The aroma is strong coffee with some chocolate and some light hop character. The flavor is strong coffee with some strong pine hop character. There is also a little chocolate but not as much as was in the aroma. Thick, creamy mouthfeel and low carbonation. I have a 15-month old bottle of this as well that was sent to me by HopHead101 and I look forward to seeing how the beer, specifically the hops, age."
"D - too strong of a coffee smell for me to drink this too many times but the one bomber was delicious and would definitely recommend it to others"
"D: Unbelievably smooth for the ABV and for all the flavors. A GD brew to be savored no doubt, but alcohol component is minimal and there is huge coffee and chocolate flavors to enjoy in a lush package. Great brew. Price is steep but for once in a while, this is a great brew. I tried this right after sharing a bomber of Lagunitas Cappucino Stout, and, as much as I like that beer, the differences were sorely obvious. I wouldn't want to age this and let the coffee flavor fade personally, but some time would probably smooth things out further."
"I've had Yeti, I've had Oak Aged Yeti, I've had Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti. This one is definitely my favorite. Pours the typical Yeti black with chocolate head that leaves great lacing. Big coffee notes on the nose, though a few hints of the oak aging as well. Taste is incredible, reminds me a little bit of Peche Mortel, actually. Big coffee and roasted malt, with a hint of chocolate, and nice oak notes. Some sweet alcohol and maybe leafy hops are in there too. Unlike the regular Oak Aged Yeti, I feel like the oak in this one is not overdone. Delicious. MF is a bit creamier than typical Yeti, but similar in carbonation. Somewhat dry finish. Tremendous drinkability, my favorite so far out of the Yetis I've had. Glad I picked up more than one, a must find."
"Bomber bottle pours a dark black with caramal brown foam lacing the duvel glass. The taste is so damn smooth on this one. Dark roasted coffee that just melts your mouth. Mmm, yummy. I want this for breakfast everyday. No hint of the 9.5% what so ever. I easily could have drank a second bomber of this, but I managed to save it for a later date. Fantastic coffee beer."
"D - dont pick up on the alcohol much."
"Very one dimensional. For the most part, just a burnt flavor that dominates. There are much better coffee stouts out there."
"Beer is really smooth, coffee flavors comes up late, there is no carbonation in the palate but connectivity is fine with the sweetness up front and the roasted bitterness in the back. Drinkability is high."
"Cheers!"
"d - A pretty good stout. I personally felt as though the coffee dominated the smell and taste, hiding some of the other flavors/smells. I personally liked the Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti better, but if you like yeti and coffee you'd probably love this. I'd try it again but given the opportunity, would buy Chocolate or regular Oak Aged Yeti over this."
"D= I love yeti like I mentioned and this is my first dabble away from the oak aged or the regualr yeti and again it proves great. Really nice coffee to this beer which is one of my other prefered beverages. While I don't think yeti can improve much and while this isn't an ""improvement"" I do find the variations fun and delicious so far. Great beer."
"D - High ABV's and a thick dessert/coffee taste make this one a sipper. I would only want one of these after drinking a nice hoppy brew as that is my taste. This one I would look to finish the nite off with. Very enjoyable, hope to get my hands on this soon!"
"Wow! Great complexity! Lot's of espresso flavors. I was wondering how strong the espresso was going to be, and Great Divide nailed it. Carbonation is mild, so when it's not noticable, it's perfect! Has strong malty thickness on the palate. Again, booze is undetectable. This stout comes in sweet from the vanilla and finishes bitter-sweet, with a long lasting espresso flavor on the tongue. Great beer!"
"Well balanced, with a nicely done coffee infusion to an already fantastic beer."
"A bottle of this is like a meal, or at least a rich dessert that makes you feel like going to sleep. Your tongue is greeted with an assault of dark chocolate chips and coffee, the body is full, the alcohol warm, and the finish long and bitter. I think I liked it more fresh, maybe just an off moment."
"A bit of a let-down here. Malt and hops were subdued, and the coffee notes were bland. Rather than an Imperial Stout, this might hit the American Stout mark, at best. My bottle was about a year old, but the beer didn't seem to have held up terribly well, and had already mellowed to the non-descript stage - in light of the abv, I would have expected it to remain more bold."
"Great beer"
"Overall, this held up extremely well after a year especially for it being <10% ABV. Props to Great Divide on another great variation of Yeti."
"D_A bomber is certainly no problem to drink. I cant help but savour this one though."
"Pours black with a frighteningly large cascading brown head that is frothy, thick, and displays lots of lacing. Smells of opulent rich espresso, oak, vanilla, roasted barley, chocolate milk, earthy coffee beans, and prune. Tastes precipitously dry, then lots of bitter fresh roasted coffee beans, vanilla, and the midpalate brings out the oak chips. The finish is bready, cakelike, and reminds again of coffee beans. Full in body, slightly slippery with medium somewhat bubbly carbonation. This one was quite delicious, though a bit heavy on oak, but probably the least offensively oaked version of Oak Aged Yeti. This is a beer I like as fresh as possible as the espresso helps to counter the excessive amount of vanilla bearing oak chips."
"22oz bottle into a Duvel snifter pours a nice opaque black with a decent frothy lasting tan head. Aroma is fresh ground coffee in front of roasted malts. The taste is loads of espresso in front of oak, roasted malts and hints of vanilla. The beer is on the heavy side of medium with a bit of warming alcohol. This is certainly an enjoyable coffee stout, but I must admit, the Chocolate Yeti I'm having along side of this one is much better."
"(D)- Simply a remarkable stout! I am slightly disappointed that there isnt much espresso in this, but I quickly forgot that when I smelled and tasted this. Simply amazing! This bottle did not last long at all! Every Yeti I have had has been fantastic, but this one with almost a year of age on it is nearly orgasmic. I am excited to see what further aging will do to it. Now. . . where can I find a case?"
"Drinkability: My friend found out about this from the beer manager of one of the local liquor stores. Beyond the glowing recommendation, we had no expectations. After one sip we both resolved to go out the next day and buy another bottle. This is one of the best coffee stouts I have had."
"Overall: A huge thanks go out to monsterfat for hooking me up with this winner. It is just plain amazing."
"Cheers!"
"Pretty drinkable for an imperial coffee stout. Overall this was a great one, possibly the best of the Yetis I've had."
"Overall: My favorite yeti version of the 4 I've had. I recommend!"
"Bottle courtesy nickd717, glad you could make it! Pours darkest brown with a fluffy beige head. Aroma is coconut from the wood aging with roasted coffee and dark chocolate and a surprising amount of sprucey, piney hops peeking through. Flavor is toasty and chocolatey with a big roasted coffee influence. Woody and bitter. This is clearly the superior version of Yeti."
"I don't mind if an Imperial Stout bakes me a cake, but I want it to at least throw a few punches and tell some convoluted stories before it's done. Some more hops and complex flavor would have really set this beer off for me. Nonetheless, another quality offering from Great Divide."
"J"
"Quite a fantastic beer, well worth a buy."
"Notes: There very well may be a yeti inside this brew it got turned into a tidal wave of nectar. Cheers."
"It's certainly a sipper but is fantastic. Has a fairly complex mix of flavors and the warming feels makes it a perfect winter beer."
"All in all, this is a little bit disappointing. I thought it would be better than it was. I expected more coffee flavor for an espresso oak aged. It just tasted like a standard oak aged."
"drinkability: another solid beer from Great Divide and another top notch Yeti"
"A fine beer for a special occasion. I wasn't planning on opening this, but it's the holidays, right?"
"Would I buy more of it? - Definitely, unless they came out with some other Yeti varieties in which case I'd have to try them first."
"The beer is full bodied, roasty and smooth. The alcohol is well hidden by the flavors and accentuates the beer's flavors nicely. Overall this is a very good imperial stout that I will happily revisit."
"Couldn't miss out on a variation of the always delicious Yeti. This was no exception, although it was certainly quite a different beer than the more traditional versions. Deep brown with a perfect tan head that sits around. Big coffee and chocolate in the nose, with a touch of roasted malt. Likewise in the flavors, with the roasted malt mixing nicely with some quieter hops underneath all that giant mocha. Feel is thick and full, sort of a mix of creamy and oily. Nice. Overall, this one was excellent, would love to try it in a bottle that had been ageing."
"Notes: The Espresso, unlike the slightly thin and disappointing Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti, delivers on all of its promises and presents as a huge, satisfying beer."
"Drinkability: If you like the regular and Oak Aged Yeti, then you should like this version of the Yeti. If you can't find this beer, grab an Oak Aged and add more chocolate and coffee to the mix and you got this beer. It was a good beer, but it was a little disappointing in the taste. Damn you chocolate and malts! It was fun to try, but I'd still rather have an Oak Aged Yeti."
"This beer was somewhat of a disappointment. With a name like ""Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout," one would epect espresso and oak to be front and center in both the aroma and the flavor. Unfortunately, I found them to be practically non-existant. Furthermore, it seemed that the citrusy, American-style hops were definitely overdone. All in all, this beer seemed a bit ""rough around the edges."" I would however love to revisit it again after a few years of ageing."
"My first oak aged brew and it didn't disappoint at all. This edges out Old Raspy and Founders IMO. If you are a fan of the style then I highly recommend this."
"easy to drink. by far my favorite yeti that i have had to date."
"Overall, I like this beer, but it could have been a bit better if it weren't so syrupy flavored. This thing is big and I recommend splitting it with a buddy. I will have a hard time getting through this bomber, but I think I will be able to do it."
"D: bomber was split between 3 people and mine share was enough. Nice after dinner drink, though."
"This beer presents a lot of roasted malt up front, with some sweet chocolate, giving way to plenty of coffee flavor along with a touch of oak on the finish, with an espresso-like bitterness on the finish. There is a nice balance from the bitterness of the roasted malt and coffee and the sweetness in this beer. This is a delicious beer. I would prefer a little thicker mouthfeel but its by no means bad. This is right up there with Peche Mortel and Founders Breakfast Stout for me, maybe just a notch below. Its a terrific coffee stout."
"Drinkability is pretty good. It's good medicine with flavor. The coffee imparts some limitations, as do the bittering hops, but this beverage is really a uniquely balanced combination of a bunch of good beer stuff. Though not complex enough to be all that sought after, it's a quality-enough bottle to pick up when available."
"This would really make the perfect english breakfast."
"D-This is one of the most impressive coffee infused RIS's I have ever had. Simply awesome. Take oak-aged Yeti and crank it up to eleven!"
"Taste: Bitter, roasted coffee beans and baker's chocolate. Almost exactly mirrors the aroma. It's such a perfect and bold mixture of the coffee, bitter chocolate, and molasses flavors, with a touch of hops twang to keep it from dredging too far--balanced with a heavy emphasis on roastiness."
"I liked this a lot, though I'd probably stick to the regular oak aged in the future."
"From notes. Pours black, modest mocha head fades to ring, thick lacing. SMELL coffee, roasty, woody, malty, alc heat. Nice, but took some swirling to get much. Probably more if I'd let it warm longer. TASTE is roasty, woody, coffee, modest hop bitterness, chocolate, vanilla, hint of sweetness. Very smooth and complex. Delicious. FEEL thick, rich, creamy, viscous and smooth. Finishes clean. OVERALL wicked delicious, one of the best of the style."
"D- Alcohol is excellently masked and hardly detectable. If it weren't for the price tag, I could drink this a bunch."
"Not to keen on the drinkability. I never did get used to the stark contrast between big sweet start and huge bitter finish, with the hole in the middle."
"Excellent brew. I need to haul my ass hither to sample some more Yeti. And someone needs to send me the BA version, pronto!"
"Huge sample poured for free at the brewery before the Rockies game, these brewers were very generous and I had an awesome time at their facility, reviewed from my notepad, color is pretty much black, one inch foamy brown head, aroma consists of coffee, wood, dark cocoa, and roastiness, starts off with a big dry espresso taste, fades into some sweeter but roasty malts in the finish, warms up with more oak and maltiness coming to the surface, full bodied, soft to medium carbonation, could probably finish a bomber, it is a big beer but alcohol is hidden well, smooth for having coffee in it, I enjoy Yeti by itself and the coffee component made it even better in ways, glad they experimented with aging this beer in different ways, would drink again, worth trying"
"D: Surprisingly drinkable for how heavy this beer is. One is quite enjoyable and having more doesn't seem unfathomable."
"D: Definitely better than the chocolate which lacked a full flavor profile. THe esspresso is muted compared to other coffee beers. Complex and smooth enough to enjoy more."
"What a great beer. Reminds me of a great cup of coffee and I could drink this for breakfast."
"Pours a very dark, almost black with a tan one finger head. I can see small red highlights if I hold it up to the light. Head is sticking around for the review. The smell is actually more boozy than expected. I thought this beer would mellow with a half a year age on it. I can definitely smell the oak and chocolate, but I'm struggling to find the espresso on the nose. A quick swirl of the glass only brings up the alcohol aroma. Definitely smells sweet and roasty once you get past the hot alcohol presence. As far as taste goes, it's a grand slam. You get a rush of sweet fruits and alcohol, but it is mellowed quickly by a very nice coffee and cocoa presence. It seems like the cocoa sticks to your tongue, making for a very nice mouthfeel, almost like the way a sugary hot cocoa leaves a residue of sticky chocolate on your tongue. Very nice. Wouldn't consider this one too drinkable, might be better with a little aging. I attempted to keep this one as long as I could, but it was calling my name. Not the first I've had, but the first I sat down to review. Very solid stout."
"Mind blowing, the absolute best coffee stout that I've ever had. It is refreshingly bittersweet with cocoa to back it up. Absolutely incredible... Pours pitch black with a nice head and lacing... smell is velvety dark chocolate and espresso coffee with a touch of wood... taste is the same as advertised by the aromas... mouth feel is pure velvet, alcohol is there any? ....nuff said!"
"This is a nice brew that I enjoyed sipping most of the evening. Holds up well, body is full. Perhaps a little too bold in the roasty bitterness but it adds a nice balance. A touch rough but that's alright. A great big beer."
"Drinkability is tough because there is such an overwhelming coffee/roasty bitterness. For big flavor beer lovers, this will be a welcome addition, but others may find it staggeringly bitter."
"Drinkability is OK. I found the bitter taste (not any hops bitterness) and the booziness a little off-putting for me. I can see how some might like this but this one's not for me. Yeti is great and there are coffee stouts that I do enjoy but not this one."
"Good drinkability marks for this one. One bottle went down well. Price was a little high for me to make this a regular offering, but I would readily have another were it available."
"Pours a midnight black color with a very tan frothy head that lingers a while. Smells of chocolate and coffee, pretty typical for this style of beer. Taste is spot on with lots of sweet chocolate, hints of coffee, and the bitter after taste that keeps me coming back for more. Also lots of roasted malts hit the palate. Mouth is full bodied with minimal carbonation. Drinkability is high. Quite an outstanding flavor. Definitely will add this to my regular brew in the DBF. Good job GD brewing."
"Pours black with a dark brown head that lasted only a little while. The aroma is coffee, chocolate and a little boozy. The taste is coffee and chocolate too, but the alcohol taste make it too harsh. Feel is creamy and heavy. Drinkability is fair and would be better without the alcohol taste."
"D: I wanted coffee, and the oak/vanilla combo just seemed to stamp it all out here. Maybe it will come out with a bit of age. A nice one to sip on for dessert."
"A very good Imperial stout. I really like the subtleness of the oak without being too overpowering. I wish the espresso came through more, it was more chocolate on the palate. Nice complexity with the smokiness and dark fruit, almost like a RIS."
"D: I found it really easy to down a full 750ml bottle. The folks at Great Divide seem to love to produce oak-aged imperial items and I love to drink them. This is very enjoyable. This is one to experience."
"D: I am sort of on the fence about what to think about this beer. On one hand it sort of delivers what it promises, a coffee infused imperial stout, and on the other hand it delivers what it promises, a coffee flavored imperial stout that lacks any kind of depth or complexity behind the initial blast of coffee and chocolate flavors. It does taste pretty darn good and goes down quite easy but it sort of reminds me of a McDonald's chocolate shake, not that this beer tastes like a chocolate shake, but more so what it feels like after you've finished a chocolate shake from McDonalds. You knew you wanted chocolate going in and it was good while you were drinking it but when you finished the shake you already have forgotten what it tasted like. Yes, it tasted like chocolate but beyond that there was really nothing more there, you asked for chocolate and that's what you got, nothing more. The same thing sort of happens with this beer. You get what you were expecting, maybe even a little less, it tastes good but beyond that there was nothing else there, the depth and complexity that you find in other stouts was not there, the dark fruits, the earthiness, the roasty/toasty flavors that dry the tongue after an initially dark and fruity kick are not here. You get what you ask for out of this beer and not much more. A good beer, but not really worth another ten dollar investment."
"Pours thick and very black. The mocha colored head was slow to form and was limited to a half inch before settling down to a thin cap. Minimal spotty lacing is left on the glass. The aroma conists of roasted malt, vanilla, and hints of chocolate and espresso. I can taste the oak barrel influence on this beer but where is the espresso? Roasted malt with a slight burnt and charcoal element is the main flavor element. Hints of vanilla and chocolate as well. Slight taste of alcohol in the finish and has a warming affect. A burnt bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. The body is thick, rich, almost decadent with soft carbonation. A good stout but it is missing the claimed espresso flavor so the score gets lowered. The concept is a definate winner but just not perfected."
"Overall, this is a great beer. Good body, excellent flavor, and comfortable mouthfeel. It's drinkable for sure, and would be a perfect pair for a nice, sweet cigar."
"This beer pours absolutely gorgeous just like a big stout should, hosting a nearly four finger thick malted milk chocolate brown head. Great retention as it slowly fades leaving a wall of fat lace and rocky bubbles. Body is thick tar blackness. Nose has tones of smoked malts, espresso beans, dark fruits and even faint minerally hop character. Wow, they were going for an espresso feel(of course) with this one and they hit it o the nose. The first thing you taste is full rich espresso feel that is silky as it glides across the tongue. The second thing I notice is the distinct oaky feel which I may have overlooked as hops on the nose. Definitely more oaky than the other aged Yeti. As you drink that oak feel really wears on the tongue and becomes to dominate for me. Mouthfeel is of oak and dry dark fruits. Drinkability would be much better if the oak wasn't so overpowering."
"[Note]: I split this with a friend that is just starting to test the waters of craft brew and he loved it! Could not stop talking about it all night."
"Blipped ""The Yeti"" by Clutch"
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a rather large light brown foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of dry espresso coffee with some lightly bitter roasted oats. Taste is also dominated by astringent and dry notes with bitter roasted malt. Espresso is a bit too astringent for my taste but very well done nonetheless. Body is full with light creamy notes and great carbonation with no alcohol showing. Another fine brew from a great brewery that I sometime forget about."
"M/D: Full bodied, low carbonation, alcohol can be felt. Drinkability is decent. A big beer that needs to be sipped. Overall, I'm slightly underwhelmed with the total package, but it's still a fine beer."
"Drinkability: This is a good beer, but probably my least favorite of the three Yeti's that I have tried. It almost tastes like a Baltic porter/RIS mix, which I do not get with the other Yeti's...A good beer which I would like to have again, but for the price one is enough."
"Overall, this is a good Imperial Stout though not as complex as I had hoped it would be."
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/2"" orangey dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head falls gradually down to an uneven layer of bubbles, with leggy slow-falling lace. Aroma is sweet coffee and light alcohol. Taste starts richly sweet, gives a peek of coffee in the middle, heads out with a coffee bitterness that fades in alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is quite smooth, with pretty good drinkability for the style. Liked the CHocolate version better."
"Tremendously drinkable assuming you are a coffee drinker. Drinks relatively easy given the size and complexity. Very enjoyable."
"Full bodied with a bit of astrigency. Good beer overall. Some weird flavors going on though. Not sure if it is from the espresso or just off flavors all around. Cant quite put my finger on why, but this one needs a little bit of rounding out."
"very rich and roasted. bitter coffee dominates the flavor with some chocolate poured in. everything tasted double roasted. full bodied that was thick and creamy. i forgot it was even aged in oak barrels. there was no oak in the taste or smell, but it obviously made this beast even darker and more robust."
"No question this is upper tier. Oak could be toned down slightly, but definitely a beer that I get excited about drinking."
"Overall, a great twist on an already excellent beer."
"Taste: Taste is pretty extraordinary. The vanilla and espresso flavors are very complimentary to each other."
"D: I wasn't impressed with my first glass of this, but I came around to the second. It is a nice variation on the Yeti. I still prefer the base beer, as I'm not a coffee fan, but I could see myself getting some of this if Great Divide ever manages to distribute to CA."
"Great to finally get my hands on this brew I have wanted to try it for a long time.Poured into a imperial nonic a jet black with a tight formed creamy dark mocha colored head.A mix of dark fruit and vanilla tinged rum stand out most in the nose,the espresso beans show up in a passing lingering note.Wow full rich,thick mouthcoating mouthfeel,it glides down easy and is very lush....perfection in my mind.Big complex flavors,a mix of vanilla-like rum and dark fruit with that espresso roast and bitter chocolate rounding out the finish,there is a hint of char and wood after it warms a little as well.Hell yeah this is where its at,just kick ass."
"As to drinkability, this is clearly a cigar beer. It will stand up, and never back down. Or it works as a relaxing sipper. If I find a chance to slip away for a camping trip this fall I am definitely bringing a bottle of this to enjoy by the fire once the stars come out. But the label states ""You can now have Yeti with breakfast", and I think that's true as well, which really says something about it's drinkability. I think it would pair well with a spicy, salsa-infused breakfast burrito. And I think it would also work as a bitter springboard for the desserts they suggest. That said, I'd call it pretty damned drinkable - at least in the world of bigger beers. You could never quaff this as you could a Kolsch or soft Pilsener - and please don't try that at home! - but it's certainly a beer I'd step up to the plate for again. Kudos!"
"D: Spliting the bottle as desert. Really a nice beer all around. The price was a little high and I prefer the chocolate version but this is still a damn fine beer."
"i've had this beer multiple times, most recently following the food pairing suggestion on the bottle and trying it with some cheesecake. the combination was fantastic, i would highly recommend giving this beer a shot on its own and then having it with some deserts the second time around."
"** Edit: As the beer warmed, my glass is now coated with thick lacing."
"Pours nearly black with brown edges. Opaque. Thick, creamy brown head with thick, thick lacing. Bitter coffee and espresso aroma with a hearty helping of chocolate. Earthy and woody, but not as much as the regular barrel-aged Yeti. Smooth, slick mouthfeel with a long finish. Bitter espresso and dark chocolate bite up front which stretch out into a warm milk chocolate and coffee-and-cream flavor. Some cereal, but not much Good vanilla and caramel in the back along with the oak. Acidic black coffee and malt finish. Excellent beer."
"Full bodied with a high level of carbonation."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied but coated the palate nicely. Drinkability was good but the alcohol gets a little apparent when it warms up."
"Where this beer shines is in the finish. The roasty, toasty goodness is amazing and lasts well past the beer going down your throat. The mouthfeel is viscous and chewy making a smooth slick feeling beer. Light carbonation lets you taste the complexity of the flavors (even if I feel there are too many competing) which adds to my enjoyment. This beer is a fine brew but not one I would put in my top 10. Very enjoyable but too rich with all those fine flavors. I'd rather see this one focus on it's best asset and have the rest back off a little to solidly back it up."
"So good from the first sip! After a few more I'm nearly convinced this is my preferred Yeti version and maybe favorite imperial stout (though I'd have to put it up against Speedway Stout to know for sure); Great Divide really knocked this out of the park, managing to include vanilla and espresso notes into an already full-flavored beer without muddling the overall character. Nice work!"
"4.5 D: I split this bomber with a friend. In the future, I'll keep it all for myself."
"D - This is an extremely well-crafted brew. There are many layers of subdued complexity here, not unlike a well-made cup of espresso. A real winner - just perfect for slow sipping on a contemplative evening."
"D- This stout is exceptional! Creaminess, boldness flavor, and a strong alcohol kick, comfort level on this drink is very high. Amazing stout and it's local. Would definitely purchase another bottle ...or 50."
"Pours an opaque darkness with a HUGE stiff dark brown head that decomposes like an ice cream sundae, massive 3D lacing present. The smell is awesome; aggressive malted milk chocolate jahva. the mouth feel is medium-full bodied and creamy. Full flavored, the chilled cafe latte has a tangy oak-aged nature. IMO original Oak-Aged Yeti rocks on another level than this combination. A reasonable drinker, the 9.5% ABV is nicely integrated."
"Overall not sure, it's a niche thing. Def interesting. I could see this being something I crave on the rare occasion but not something I'd drink often."
"Bottle. Pours black with a thick, foamy dark tan head. Aroma of oak, bitter coffee grounds, and sweet roasted malt. Flavor is quite oaky with only mild roasted malt and vanilla. The oak really dominates the flavor and the coffee notes do not really come through. They should rename this beer ""Super Oak Aged Yeti."""
"This is an awesome beer. A sipper, no doubt. Some roughness around the edges and the alcohol edge will make this bomber last for a while."
"Drinkability: Clearly a beer that will benefit from age, this has some harsh tendencies in its youth; I imagine a couple of years would make this extraordinary"
"D- I sipped on this one for nearly two hours to get through the bomber, but it was fantastic anyway."
"D - Tough one here very drinkable but dont drink alot as it will be rough the next day."
"A: Insanely thick and dark brown head, not a speck of light passes through this brew, moves like a lightly warmed maple syrup, patches of sticky foam along the edge of the glass - 5.00, S: Elements of the two ingredients mentioned on the label - espresso and oak, has a coffee ground like smell, some molasses, hard to decipher the hops, some charring in the aromas as well - 4.25, T: Like the nose, there is lots of espresso and charring as well as vanilla, the charring balances nicely with the thick syrupy sweetness, some concentrated prunes and dates, hop bite just comes through at the end of this monster - 4.50, M: Creamy and medium bodied - 4.50, D: ""But this one goes up to 11", Wonderful desert beer, one that would likely cellar well - 4.50"
"overall - ? in my review of original yeti i said espresso was better but now i think regular yeti is better at least better then this bottle - i have a couple more and will see what a couple years does to this one"
"Espresso Yeti is definitely a success. Generally, I believe anything 'Yeti' probably would be. The coffee/espresso flavor works very well, but I don't believe it has a material impact on the beer either way. It's not so strong that it'd scare some away. I'm a coffee fan and appreciate the use of it, but this beer is equally as good as Oak Aged Yeti. Both are better than Yeti, if you ask me. I really like what Great Divide's doing right now...blazing the trail. I've had a couple of the handful of new releases they're rolling out and they're impressive. Keep up the great work, guys. With quality stuff like this, we, the beer geek crowd, will continue to salivate over anything you push out the door. Great stuff."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed this beer, but I was a bit let down by the lack of espresso/coffee flavors. I wish I had a regular oak aged yeti to compare it to, so I could try to notice the differences. Still, a very enjoyable beer, and one I would have again. It was not a chore at all to drink the whole bomber."
"Dark brownish black, perfect light brown head. As good looking as a beer gets. The smell is a lot hoppier than you would expect for a beer like this, but not that surprising when I remember the standard Yeti. Slightly sweet, and the strange celery smell that I've picked up in a few beers before. I can definitely pick up the espresso in the taste, and this isn't as hoppy as the standard Yeti or the smell suggested. There is just a light bitter bite to the finish. Creamy mouthfeel, not overly alcoholic, and overall pretty delicious."
"As with the other two Yetis I've had (the standard and the oak aged), this is a very nice, strong sipper. I don't know that I liked quite as much as the other two, as the roasted coffee dilutes the other complexities a bit. Still, a the base beer is great and the espresso adds a roasty character and the oak is there, but not overwhelming. Another winner in the Yeti family."
"Drinkability: Letdown. Yep, letdown. Not a bad imperial stout, but doesn't even touch Yeti or OA Yeti. Too much espresso and too much alcohol. A lot of good aspects, but a couple of glaring bad ones. Glad I tried it, but I won't be seeking this out again."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice black color, very nice carbonation, with a very nice thick/creamy one-finger plus dark tan head, with some nice big oil slick/sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some chocolate/toffee/coffee notes, slight spice. The taste is malty, with lots of dark stuff, not too bad with the espresso, nice oak note. Medium body, the ABV is kinda upfront with this brew, but still nice. Drinkable, a pretty tasty brew."
"Creamy mouthfeel and bitter finish. Fantastic beer. I'm glad they finally decided to bottle this one."
"drinkability is great. excellent balance. good depth and complexity. i think i like this more than both of the other two yeti versions i've had. good stuff!"
"Pours a solid black with a creamy tan head that doesn't persist for very long, but leaves lots of lace on the way down. Smells of citrus hops, coffee, vanilla, oak, roasted grains. Taste is much like the smell. Citrus hops followed by a touch of alcohol, some roasted coffee and slight chocolate, oak and vanilla followed by a lingering roast hop and alcohol finish. Theres a lot going on here and its all tasty. Carbonation is low to medium, mouthfeel is oily/creamy, body is thick like tar. Great Imperial stout! The coffee is there, but its subtle enough to not be in your face like some other coffee brews. I wish it were a little cheaper so I could afford to drink it more, but at 11.99 a bomber I may not enjoy this one regularly."
"Again, Great Divide knocks it out of the park."
"Very disappointing... Very..."
"I definitely like the regular Yeti better as the espresso just makes this a bit too harsh. It is not a bad beer though and I find myself even enjoying it."
"Huge thanks go out to IBUnit63 for this bottle. Very dark brown as it pours, jet black in the Darkness tulip, two finger mocha colored head, sticky rings of lacing. Dark chocolate aromas are prominent, light coffee and some oakiness. Taste is dark roasted coffee, nice, rich chocolate flavor, waves of burnt caramel, a good amount of oak woodiness and nice hop bite at the end, but not really sure if the bitterness is fromthe hops or the coffee. Rich espresso notes comes out greatly as it warms up. Alcohol is well hidden but becomes slightly warming as it reaches room temp. Creamy, thick, chewy, unbelievably smooth, light carbonation. Everything is great about this stout other than I get more dark chocolate notes out of the aroma than I do coffee. Tastes great, however, and the mouthfeel is extraordinary."
"Feels nice and creamy in the mouth, and I get a nice warming sensation in the back of the throat when swallowed from the nice abv. Great variation on an already great beer."
"Very drinkable. another please!"
"D - For the style and bigness in both ABV and flavor, very drinkable."
"D: Very, very drinkable. It's a hot, hot 86 degrees here in Chicago, and I still want more of this thick stout. Now that's an endorsement."
"It looks just like I want an Imperial stout to look. Black, shiny, with a massive brown head. Poured into a small snifter. I could hardly see any highlights, though the lighting in the restaurant wasn't incredible (still daylight when consumed though, so not a problem). Nice looking. The smell was light on the coffee, very light on the wood (maybe it was too old to get the full force). There were some dried fruits, a tiny bit of sweetness, heavy on the roasted malts. The smell, without the oaking (which adds some vanilla and woody, earthy smells) and coffee (which enhances the roastiness) was about average, but the extra stuff pushes it beyond average. I kind of liked the smell, though it could be better. The taste was right on. I mean, everything was there, but the only drawback was just that the base was a little too estery (maybe a little too hot). There was coffee, vanilla, a tiny bit of wood, some decent sweetness (not quite enough, in my opinion), roast barley, everything. Wish there was a bit of bready sweetness. That is all I wanted. But I found that this had everything else I expect, in fact, it exceeds what the average person does by quite a bit. I mean, if I judge it along the others, it more than deserves the score, if I judge it by my own standards, it just about earns it. The wood and coffee help the mouthfeel, of course. This one doesn't cling like regular yeti, it isn't too harsh or rough, it's just nice and pleasant, a bit better than normal, but not incredible. I drank this one down rather quickly, and enjoyed it. I would ask everyone to try it, I mean, I wasn't a huge fan of the regular yeti, and if you weren't a fan, this was much better. Try it if you can (it may be too late now). worth a shot."
"Drinkability - plenty to enjoy here; a complex beer with lots of 'flavor stations' to work through. Very nice. Big props to Gyle41386 and bhalter8 for hooking me with some of this. Thanks guys!"
"A very tasty dessert or nightcap beer. Not something I'd want to session but after dinner while watching a movie it's great!"
"D: Easy drinker, can you say hangover beer? This is the perfect morning after beer, I'm really impressed with this one. I wish I would have grabbed another bottle to age. Excellent beer. Highly recommended."
"a bit too much going on, especially compared to the original oaked yeti, but still quite nice."
"Drinkability: The only factor that would lower the drinkability of this beer is the ABV as it clocks at 9.5% - but it so worth it. This was an amazing desert to a very well-cooked meal and I very much would have enjoyed a second helping (mostly because I wasn't driving)."
"Drinkability: Moderate to high for the style. Despite the huge alcohol presence it actually drinks pretty smoothly. I love espresso regularly, though, so the bitterness and the hotness might be too much for some."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle shared a recent tasting. Poured into a shaker glass and appears a nearly black color with about an inch of creamy dense dark tan foam. Smells and tastes of rich, fresh dark roasted coffee beans, bitter mocha, both milk and dark chocolates, then come the wood/oak, and bourbon notes. You really do get the espresso flavors and aromas with this one. Smooth and just about full bodied with ample carbonation. Very nice and satisfying."
"This is a nice Imperial Stout. Bought this on a family trip to Durham at Sams Blue Light. In my opnion a bit overpriced at $11 bucks a bottle but I am glad I tried it. I would certainly have it again but if I bought it at a store it would have to be a little cheaper to justify the price. Another good offering from Great Divide, I hope to have more of their selections as more titles make there way to North Carolina."
"Drinkability certainly isn't bad, as this is a good beer and the alcohol is well hidden. But because of how much hop bitterness there is, and the way it interacts to make the espresso seem more bitter/dry/acidic, this one isn't quite as nice as it could be. A little age would be great."
"D: Very good drinkability, especially upon warming. Drinks like a champ with a beautiful roasty feel that just keeps getting better with every sip."
"While it is certainly smooth and easy to drink, it's also big and bold, and very rich. This combined with it's 9.5%ABV will pretty much relegate it to the 'dessert' category. Which isn't a bad place to be, IMO."
"Rich and thick; slightly oily from the alcohol. Strong dark chocolate flavors. Again, no real coffee/espresso tastes here. The finish and aftertaste features a generous amount of balancing hops to the bittersweet cocoa. This is a deceptively easy to drink Imperial Stout."
"D - Terrific... Enjoyable in every facet... A sipper, but a quick sipper... I just want to take sip after sip all night long... The oak aging is very subdued, but adds a much appreciated sophistication... I'm quite glad I have a couple more bottles in my possession..."
"Pours a clear dark reddish brown, verging on black, very thick light brown/tan head forms, quickly settles to a medium layer and ring around the glass, drops some nice lace sheets on the glass. Smell is real nice, like oak aged Yeti, but with espresso, caramel, lots of roast, chocolate, vanilla, subtle oak, some floral and piney hops, fruit, raisins, molasses and brown sugar. Taste is very roast, lots of heavy espresso and dark chocolate, oak, vanilla, dark fruit, like a chocolate covered coffee bean, some floral hops, dry and biscuity in the finish, pretty heavy bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, some warmth from the alcohol, but quite nice. Thanks to everyone!"
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer. With so many big flavors, this one is really well balanced. This is definitely one of my favorites ever but I'll split it with someone else next time. Should really smooth out with a little cellar time."
"Overall, I am very impressed. I've heard nothing but rave reviews about the original Yeti, but since I am a fan of coffee-flavored stouts (FBS, KBS, etc.), the Espresso OAY seemed like a no brainer for me. I'm very glad I picked up this beer. This is an outstanding imperial stout, and one of the best coffee-themed beers I've ever tasted.  Savory, decadent and totally worth the price of admission. I would really like to grab another bottle of this to age for the future, as well as trying the original Yeti and it's Oak-aged variant for comparison."
"D- Im a sucker for coffee beers so this one was a no brainer for me. Either way I feel this could benefit from a little aging as the flavors are not all quite together presently. A bit high in alcohol to but what are you going to do, it's a imperial stout for pete's sake."
"Overall a very enjoyable beer, and defenitely my favorite of the ""yetis"". I love the bold hoppiness, and the subtelty of the espresso. Really nice to see a coffee infused beer that doesn't taste like a bag of beans. A great beer, and a must try from GD. Good work fellas!"
"D - This was a petty good beer a little too strong in the abv for a breakfast beer but if thats how you roll it would be good with breakfast on the weekend worth trying sometime"
"D: A good dessert beer, in many European countries they drink coffee or espresso at the end of a meal, probably would do very well with a very nicely charred smokey brisket(Texas style). I'd like to find this next to my cheesecake. Actually a pairing with something as rich as a classic cherry cheesecake would be perfect, but there are many other options out there, just choose something more dominant as the flavor does tend to linger. All in all an amazing beer and I cheers to the Great Divide with a Houblon Chouffe glass of their finest!"
"D: This drinks like mad for an Imperial. I could have this any day of the week."
"to this beer's credit, after it beat down my palate with the bitter burnt coffee burn, we warmed up to eachother (somewhat). But I'd take a regular Oak variety of this stout most of the time, and if I wanted a coffee stout there are other (better) options."
"d- this took me a while to finish, I'll admit. But RIS aren't supposed to be fast drinkers. To style, I'd say that this was as drinkable as the best imperial stouts that I've had. Though, I would not plan on drinking more then one of them in a night."
"Don't worry about the rating. This is one hell of a beer that deserves its' marks. I can't wait to open the bottles of 2007 Yeti and Oak Aged Yeti that I have."
"As a huge fan of the original oak aged yet(maybe top 5 greatest beers ever), I'm not sure if I like this one as much. The beer already had a nice coffee presence, now with espresso it just seems to be fighting for attention. Do I taste the oak, or the coffee, or the espresso, or stout, or dark malts, or dark malt coffee flavor, or is that just the espresso. The espresso is a cool idea, it just seem like they already reached perfection, the extra touch of espresso just doesn't fit right."
"Pours luxurious black with deep brown head that has a sexy contrast. Aromas of espresso (of course), baker's chocolate, and marshmallow are present. Sipping through the generous head is a lot like sipping espresso through the creamy crema - quite a sensory experience. Viscous body, dark roasted coffee beans, wet coffee paper filter, and slight chalky component are noticed on the palate. Finish is very long and roasty. Very drinkable for the style."
"This poured pitch black with dark tan head. It smelled like lots of coffee, with strong alcohol and little else. It tasted like black coffee with some roasted and burnt grinds, and a hint of oak and bitter chocolate. It was slightly thick with no carbonation, and had a bitter coffee aftertaste. Overall this beer isn't kidding when it says Espresso. Fantastic flavor if you like coffee. Bold taste hides alcohol much better than expected based on the smell. It could use a bit more body, as this seemed thinner than the Oaked Yeti. Great beer, though."
"Overall: Mouthfeel was very pleasant, very well carbonated and not as thick as I expected. Drinkablility is very good, however such a big flavor and alcohol bring it down a bit, one bomber will do for me. Fantastic beer."
"D: Probably a little young right now. Booziness needs a chance to mellow; coffee roast mostly conceals it now, but eventually the warming catches up and reduces drinkability. A good sipper, but a difficult bottle to finish. Still, absolutely worth seeking out - recommended!"
"D- This beer is definitely a sipper, but I had no problem finishing a 22 oz. bomber and was saddened upon taking the last sip... it is that good."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer has a full body. The carbonation is low and works well with the chewy and creamy textures of this beer. This beer is an alcohol bomb for sure at 9.5%/ The boozeyness of the beer matches the beers general character. In short I will probably never again partake of the Yeti unless it is of the espresso oaked variety."
"Medium with low carbonation, slightly creamy and a touch bitter."
"A nice beer with an expected twist on it. I think I prefer both the regular and oaked versions to this one however."
"I'm torn with this beer. On one hand, there's great, complex flavor profile. However, there's an unpleasant booze sting, like when you take a shot of vodka. The aroma holds big fruity, bready chocolate and coffee smells. The flavor has a huge espresso bean note that's rich but not terribly deep. That boozy tang quickly kicks in and ruins an otherwise awesome beer. What a shame."
"22oz bomber served in a snifter. Poured a deep brown/black with about a finger of fine bubbled tan head. Lots of coffee in the aroma also some piney hops. Rich and full bodied. Lots of chocolate and vanilla right off as well as coffee of course. The coffee is not overpowering as in some coffee beers. There is a fair amount of hop bitterness, that shows up in a dry finish. The chocolate and coffee really linger in the finish. To me one of the better coffee stouts. The coffee is not overly bitter. Great flavor from the oak."
"Definitely a sipper. Somewhat of an acquired taste, but something you should try to broaden your horizons a bit."
"drinkability is good for the style, but it is really a sipper, probably my favorite of the Yeti's, the coffee has evened everything out very nicely"
"Definitely my favorite of the Yetis so far. Everything works together to give a great overall experience. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability - A sipper, but still relatively easy drinking. This is a rather rich beer though and one I recommend sharing."
"D- I am a bit torn with this. I know that with some time, the oak flavors will die off a bit, but so will the amazing espresso parts. Definitely worth a shot, and probably worth aging- just for fun."
"this is one great brew -my first one - picked this one up yesterday at diciccio's in ardsley - bottled in march 2005 - poured into a snifter, where a vigorous pour yields a finger and a half of light brown head, which dissipates quickly - spots instead of lacing on the glass - the liquid itself is the darkest opaque brown - a light 'crema' , like an espresso's, remains on the surface - earthy woody aromas, along with good coffee scent - taste is unbelievable ! - espresso coffee mocha sweet as candy - extremely complex and extremely well balanced, as the hops and malts come through and pair with the complexity of flavor this incredible beer has to offer - mouthfeel is lingering, syrupy, and nice - alcohol is present, yet very well hidden within the incredible flavor profile - this 22oz. bottle was tasty and smooth - i wonder how it , with it's 4yr old bottling date, would compare to a current year's bottle - i'll have to find out - this is some really good stuff - perfect for this friday night at home."
"Very (surprisingly) sweet taste to it. I figured the malt would come through heavy, but this was almost like drinking a tootsie roll. The sweetness is matched only by the bitterness -- they managed to bring the hop bitterness forward along with the sweetness of the malt too!"
"D - I can't believe what I'm about to say, but I actually found this to be a bit too hoppy and a bit off-kilter. I felt the espresso character wasn't pronounced enough. I was overall pleased with the roasty and bourbon qualities but this just didn't blow me away like I was expecting. With that said, this version of Yeti is still a fine brew."
"Drinks a bit slow due to the ABV & dryness. Having said this, this & surly are probably now my faves when it comes to coffee beers, this skews a bit more capuchino IMO"
"D-I hope this hands around for a little while longer I would like to have it for when the mood strikes and would also like to age one a bit"
"Mouth is velvety and rich with an incredibly viscous afterfeel. drinks slowly but god is this good."
"Poured into a pint glass, color is a deep black/brown. Decent brown head that fades, but leaves nice lacing on the glass. Smells of chocolate, fresh coffee beans and vanilla. I taste the coffee and oak. Mouthfeel is great on this one, very smooth. I could definitely see myself drinking 2 or 3 of these in a night. This is my first from Great Divide, and it's pretty damn good."
"Cheers"
"HV"
"Medium body, a bit creamy. Lower carbonation. Some warming from the alcohol, dry at the finish. Could be fuller, but overall outstanding."
"Overall impression: Another nice addition to the yeti family - some interesting flavors, and plenty drinkable despite the high abv."
"The mouthfeel is interestingly drying--almost chalky--which makes me want another sip. Thick and viscous, like the pour. Drinkability is pretty high, but is hurt slightly by the strong alcohol presence. I still thoroughly enjoyed this beer, but I can't help but feel it should have been better."
"Overall a v. good beer, but not as good as I was hoping. A bourbon barrel would have done a great service to this beer. I'll stash one or two and see how it drinks in the future--hopefully bitterness will mellow a bit and become a little sweeter overall."
"The aroma has leather, earth, rubber, molasses, burnt malt, wood, coffee, and chocolate. The appearance is a very nice dark brown almost black color with a large tan head. The Flavor is like the aroma. The palate is not quite average for the style. Overall it is to style but I don't really like it."
"This is a great beer."
"I could see myself having more then one cause it taste damn good. To me something was missing in this beer to make it really excellent. I would definitely recommend this though."
"The espresso hurts the drinkability. Everything else is so good though."
"overall an exceptional stout."
"At 9+%abv this isn't going to be an every day beer, but it's a really nice addition to the Yeti family. I really enjoy coffee beers and this is easily one of the best I've had in a very long time."
"Color is a black opaque with a small almost non existent tan head. Good Belgian lacing. Aroma was that of heavy roast espresso coffee. Flavor of burnt heavy coffee, big espresso notes could have been balanced out better with a little bit of vanilla. Black malt with no chocolate of hop flavor evident because of the big burnt coffee taste. Full bodied and very warm to drink. Makes regular Yeti pale in comparison in flavor."
"Bomber. Pours a completely opaque black color with a very large brown head, excellent lacing. Aroma is mainly oak at first and then some coffee, chocolate, raisins, roast probably from the espresso, maybe a touch of citrus hops, and a little alcohol. Taste is espresso at first, chocolate, resiny hops, and a touch of oak. Mouthfeel is very, very creamy and full bodied with a lot of bitterness at the end. The coffee and bitterness sticks around for a while after each drink. Warms well and is not really boozy except for a slight hint of aroma. Very good beer."
"Flash of chocolate and fruity malt up front, before intense coffee and dark chocolate bitterness come on strong. Hints of dark fruit sweetness, licorice, and vanilla come through. Charred, roasted coffee bitterness stays strong throughout. Herbal and resinous hop bitterness in the finish combines with the chalky-roasted espresso bitterness to aptly numb the tongue. Wow. I feel like I should be drinking this tomorrow morning with my grape nuts. Looks like I'll be staying up all night watching baseball! Full-bodied with a thick, creamy feel. Very good."
"D: Very enticing. Could easily be a habit if it weren't an imperial stout."
"Notes: not quite as bitter as the original yeti, but perhaps more complex in flavors. i think i like the original better, thought this is yet another home run from GD"
"served in brooklyn tulip glass"
"Overall impression: A big, roasty, full flavored ale. I still think I prefer the regular Yeti but this was enjoyable. Definitely one to sip and savor. Glad I tried it once."
"*Note: As this brew warms up it's getting more and more like what I remember so maybe it was just a little too cold at first."
"For a coffee beer its not exceptional by any means, but its not terrible either. Yeti has always been a terrific go to RIS for me. This is just another fine example of the brew."
"M + D: Quite well carbonated, with a good bit of sting on the tip of the tongue. That said, it does kind of become a muddy, thicker feeling as it goes down and with each subsequent sips. Alcohol becomes much more apparent and it starts to get rather hot and boozy. This is certainly more suited to be a slow sipper, but it's quite a nice tasting beer in the end. Recommended."
"I love coffee stouts, and this has to be one of the best I've had."
"Overall I was floored by this beer. Simply put one of the best beers I have had in a very long time. This is an instant classic that has been done wonderfully. I would go after this one at every chance that I get."
"best offering from great divide w/ out a doubt"
"Drinkability: A very solid beer, though perhaps not as good as I imagined it would be. I really liked the Yeti and the OA Yeti better, I think. I think the espresso needs a little time to mellow, meld w/ things, let the oakyness come out a lot more (not that they ever really do in the GD beers). It's still a really impressive brew, but still."
"The delicious nature of this one makes me want more, but the ABV makes its presence known quite quickly. However, I could easily have another bottle on a night in which I didn't have to get up early the following morning."
"Pours near black, with a tan head that lasts the entire bottle. The upfront nose is of rich coffee and roasted malt. Once it warms, the nose becomes a little more fruity from the alcohol. The taste is very complex, and still incredibly drinkable. Notes of espresso, vanilla, semi-sweet chocolate followed by a nice balance of earthy hop bitterness. The oak and alcohol are subtle, but noticeable. The mouthfeel is full bodied and the carbonation is dead on. Truly a beer worth seeking out, and one so smooth I could drink all night."
"The beer is dark brown, not quite black, with a thick tan froth that looks perfect on the pour (tons of bubbles cascading up through the beer, just the way I like a RIS). The smell is a bit of a disappointment I'm afraid, not nearly as rich as I'd expect from a beer marketed as ""Espresso oak aged"". I didn't smell any coffee, maybe no oak either, this just smelled like yeti. The taste was better, I got the oak and chocolate (still no coffee), and lots of roasted malt. Astringently bitter which might be pleasing for others but I like RISs to be sweeter. Good body and mouthfeel, substantial. Overall a bit of a disappointment for $10, I had hoped for more coffee and more massiveness."
"I put this up there with Peche Mortel in terms of strong coffee-liek stouts. It's pure black with a huge, dark brown head that is thick and made up of the densest, tiniest bubbles. The smell of freshly ground coffee beans the most and then bits of chocolate. The taste is also of fresh coffee beans but has a bit of astringency from the bitterness of the burnt beans...it works well though in this beer. The mouthfeel is creamy and awesome. Not hints of alcohol solvency. Well done. Fucking awesome."
"Feels light and gritty. Pretty drinkable for an imperial stout."
"This is another great version of the yeti and one that I enjoyed. I honestly could have used more coffee in this one, but it's still a great beer."
"Poured into a tulip at cellar temp. Pours a jet blac body with a good sized cola colored head. Beautiful beer. Smell is of chocolate at first, then I get the coffee, some vanilla and some alcohol. Taste is very complex. I get a ton of different flavors as I drink it. At first a ton of chocolate. Almost Kate-like. That stops as I continue to drink and I get a bunch of oak, bitter, bitter coffee and some alcohol burn. The bitterness dominates as I continue to drink, but I don't mind this. Mouthfeel is slick as can be with that much bitterness. Fairly full bodied, but not creamy. Good stout, one that I would try again."
"M&D - other than the alcohol overwhelming, some interesting notes, an intense flavors, just wish i could taste them"
"Over all has lots of flavor, nice thick consistency but still highly drinkable. From where i sit i can see the fermenters making this brew, i kind of want to jump right in there and bathe in this delicious beer but the burns would prolly be pretty severe. So glad i live so close to the supply, could drink this everyday"
"D: This is a fantastic stout. Great Divide has upped the Yeti even one further from the original oak aged version. Adding coffee has turned this into one incredible stout."
"Pours a thick lightless dark, dark brownish black color with nice 2 fingers of foamy mocha and burnt tan head. Great lasting retention and some pretty impressive lacing, with a huge creamy ring at the very top. Smells of roasted malt, espresso, baker's chocolate, floral hops, oak, molasses, coffee, and slightly burnt brownies. Tastes of espresso right off the bat with some citrusy hops following close behind along with a touch of dark fruits like raisins and plum. Roasted malt, chocolate, molasses, and light vanilla notes make an appearance as does some nuttiness, anise, and wet oak before a finish of charred coffee grounds and bitter hops. Full to medium full in body with moderate carbonation. Thick, smooth, and creamy but with a chewy finish, hides a majority of its ABV well. Not overly coffee'd out, just a nice extra push from regular Oak Aged Yeti to incorporate more balance into it. A nice Imperial stout, but a little on the bitter side. Easy to drink but not frequently, maybe with age it will mellow out a bit."
"D- Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout is some great stuff. Not exactly the most drinkable beer in the world, it is definitely a sipper. Overall, this is one that I would definitely pick up again. Highly Recommended!"
"D - The ABV coupled with the unbalanced bitter finish make one enough."
"M&D- Creamy and viscous, about what an oak-aged imperial stout should be. The ABV on this is well hidden, so I could see putting a few of these back in a night before calling it quits."
"Good imperial stout but nothing I'd rush to pay $12.00 to $20 a bomber for again. I really enjoyed the regular oak aged yeti more than this beer and that really suprises me since I've loved every coffee beer I've had."
"The sturdy 9% ABV is quite well-hidden in the flavor profile, but EOA Yeti makes itself a warming presence as it languishes in my belly. The drink is full-bodied, creamy, and perfectly carbonated, making it quite quaffable in spite of its potency. An outstanding addition to the Yeti family tree!!"
"D- Easy to drink for sure."
"Overall, it started off so promising, but the charred tarry finish is just too unpleasant. And where are the coffee flavors? This reminds me a lot of the oak aged Yeti (with all of its faults). The regular Yeti is far superior to both in my opinion."
"22oz. bottle served in my DFH snifter. Bottled on 2/13/2009 indicated on the label. Poured one shade shy of black with a dense, mocha-colored cap embedded with ringlets. Head dissipates within seconds into a cluster of bubbles and a frothy band around the edges of the glass. Some spots of lacing appear as the brew recedes. Nose suggests espresso roast and bittersweet chocolate. More espresso roast in the mouth, but taste is somewhat charred and bitter rather than roasty. Some woody characteristics, but missing the vanilla. Bitterness lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied. Some carbonation burn on the front of the tongue, but as it dissipates it leaves behind a residual milky slickness. Alcohol is well-hidden on this one, but balance is off - way too bitter. May improve with cellaring."
"world class!! ..god! why did i only buy one bottle!?!?!?"""
"Definitely a coffee stout, through and through. Somewhat drinkable for its richness, especially with the amount of alcohol. Highly recommended."
"Great drinkability. Nice coffee stout."
"D: Extremely delicious when sipped and treated like a wine."
"Nice beer..I think I like The straight Oak aged Yeti a little more"
"22 ounce bottle, 9.5% ABV bottled on February 13, 2009. Served in a snifter, the beer pours black with about an inch frothy brown head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. The aroma is very nice, it smells like espresso, roasted malt, milk and dark chocolate, oak, vanilla, and some dark fruit. It tastes like espresso, oak, dark chocolate, roasted malt, piney hops, and vanilla. There's also a lingering bitter hoppy and coffee finish. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's thick, chewy and a bit slick with low/moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, considering how big the beer is. The alcohol does catch up to you after a while! Overall I think this is a good brew that I'd definitely have again in the future."
"What a find beer. Espresso dominates from beginning to the finish leaving a big coffee tannin on the tongue upon the finish. The middle shows dark bitter chocolates, black fruits and again only a slight hint of oak. This stout is just thick and viscous with a good amount of hop bitterness. Good job GD"
"I can't really identify many (if any) flaws in this brew. Obviously, it's heavy given the different flavor components, but I would be happy with this offering anytime that I'm in the mood for an Imperial Stout. Once again, the Yeti does not disappoint."
"Pours pitch black with a moderately thick, dark tan head that left good lacing. First smell comes off very sweet with lots of vanilla and caramel or toffee. The oak is definitely there too but I did expect a bigger espresso presence but was instead very subtle. First taste was all oak aged bourbon and deep roasted coffee. Thick and syrupy that coats your mouth in delicious flavor. They really did one-up the original yeti which was already one of my favorite beers. As always, I would love to age this to see where it goes but it's much harder to put such awesome brews away in storage than it is to just pop the top off and drink them. This is an excellent beer."
"Overall I am definitely NOT let down by this beer. Yeti is good, Oak Aged Yeti is great, and now Espresso Oak Aged Yeti is amazing. I will be seeking it out again for next years release."
"Oh well, you live and you learn."
"I really don't get the espresso part of this. It's all about chocolate and really well done. I could sip this all night."
"D- Pretty easy to drink, highly recommended but I just don't think I could drink this one often."
"Ordered on tap at Roadhouse in Brookline. Served in an 8 oz stemmed glass. Dark brown color. Thin white head. Good amount of lacing. Smelled like a nice cup of espresso. Close your eyes and you'll think it's a cup of coffee. Taste was equally awesome. The chocolate/roasted barley from the stout, the espresso flavor, and the slight bit of oak aging all paired together wonderfully. For such a thick, strong tasting, and somewhat high in abv beer, this was a pleasure to drink. Small serving sizes are the way to go, as a pint might be a bit much. A spectacular after dinner drink. Would love to pair with dessert on a future evening."
"No choice but to edit my rating..."
"The beer pours a pitch black body that ultimately absorbs light, with a rocky head that is much like weakly made chocolate milk. The aroma is made largely of huge scents of coffee and milk chocolate. Very little alcohol notes. The taste is largely of coffee and dark malts. The mouth feel is of alcohol warmth and finishes bone dry. It's a slow drinking beer that begs to be paired with vanilla bean ice cream"
"Overall: Espresso Oak Aged Yeti is absolutely wonderful - but it may be more coffee than it is beer. Whatever it is, I like it. Aging one for later to see how the flavors mellow."
"Coffee nose, some barrel and booze. Taste is VERY roasty coffee and burnt malt. Some bakers chocolate, anise and black licorice. This has a thick, nice and creamy mouthfeel. Sticks to the glass and your lips, real nice. A little bitter finishing, some warming. A little bitter and boozy yet, which hurts the drinkability just a bit. I think I like the regular and regular oak better, but maybe some age can bring this up. I enjoy the coffee stouts, so I'm hopefull this will improve slightly with age."
"D: Perhaps a touch too much roast but still good. Coffee is good."
"D: Hot damn. Go get some."
"Overall, kudos to Great Divide for making this fantastic beers. Easily my favorite beer by them and one of the best beer I have recently had. Definitely recommended!"
"D: Definitely one of my preferred coffee stouts! I could probably put a bit of this away in a night but its something I would sit with for a while."
"Pretty nice beer from Great Divide."
"Awesome deep black color with brown foamy head, the nose is all espresso. Taste is a major dose of coffee as is expected, but it does not overwhelm, and as it warms more subtle notes of vanilla and regular yeti come through, although I did not get any oak. Solid on tap, but a bit too expensive overall."
"D: This brewery fresh sample really felt rough. Hops and coffee battled for dominance while leaving the other flavors behind. The acidity of the finish bothered me a bit. This beer is probably a worthy candidate for cellaring, simply to get things to smooth out. To be honest, the regular Oak Aged Yeti was a better fit for me."
"This brew is wonderfully complex and amazingly tasty, but perhaps to bring out its true identity, a bit more aging might be necessary, as the hop character is a bit to vibrant and needs some time to mellow. Or perhaps it just helps to add to the uniqueness of this ale; it's difficult to tell."
"Bought 3 bottles while in Atlanta this weekend and decided to drink one of them Saturday night. I couldn't find a good pint glass so I went with a coffee mug. Great choice for this beer. Appearance, what can I say about it, it just looks awesome in a coffee mug. My friends kept coming over and asking if it was coffee or beer. The head reminded me of what a nice espresso froth is supposed to look like. The beer itself is opaque black with maybe a slight brown hue to it. Smell, to me was of a nice coffee/espresso and chocolate and maybe a slight toffee note. I get little to no hop bitterness with this beer which I would say is do to the espresso being there. Taste, this has to be in my top 10 list of beers that I have drank. Takes like a mocha cappuccino almost, very chocolate and milk texture with a hint of oak and vanilla. The taste is very complex but with each sip you find something new. Mouthfeel, very heavy and full bodied. The beer seems like it would stain your entire mouth and I could have sworn my tongue turned brown because of it. Drinkability, very drinkable and warming. If I could afford it and my liver could take the abuse I would switch this out with my morning coffee and wouldn't be able to notice. Even though its served cool the alcohol warms you up from the inside. I love the oaked yeti, but this has taken its place on my list as what to look for when I go on a beer run. I can't wait to see what this beer is like with some age on it as well."
"D: This beer is damned good. It didn't disappoint in the least. This is by and far the best of the Yeti line. I was really disappointed by the Oak Aged Yeti, and I was sceptical going in. It is amazing how this espresso quality makes this beer damn near perfect. The flavors, aromas, and feel are on point. The look is damned perfect. This was a great beer experience from the start and I will drink this beer every opportunity I get. Damned good brew. Fanfriggintastic. Drink this shit."
"Had this the other night at RFD in D.C. and it was definitely an interesting brew. Everyone loved the bottle and was taking pictures with it threw the night in different spots in RFD. Poured into a pint glass and immediately you see the very dark brew pour out with a lovely brown chocolate head forming. Smell was of Espresso and Chocolate. Taste was over the top Espresso, with chocolate. Towards the end of the brew I was hit with some bitterness and fruit flavors. The brew it's self was very interesting and I was glad that I had it, but for $20 at the place was allot to pay for it. The Espresso flavor is very very dominate threw out the beer, so make you keep that in mind and that you are up for the blast. At the time I was honestly not able to finish it due to the overwhelming strong taste of Espresso, but i am sure more serious stout drinkers would have little problem with it."
"Drinkability- This was the most suprising for me since I got half of a growler of the yeti. I was able to have 2 of these with no problem and could have had more. One word of caution is to watch out for the 9% alcohol. It snuck up on me and I was feeling pretty good very fast."
"This one is...interesting. Not exactly what I thought it would be like, but I like it better than the regular Oaked Yeti. Still would prefer many other coffee beers over this, especially with the $10 per bottle tag. I had to try it though."
"Glad to have another bottle of this waiting in the wings."
"Notes: Gotta say, I prefer the Oaked Yeti to all the Yeti's so far. This is a little too coffee ground tasting/feeling, a little too bitter (from the coffee), and a little too simple. Texture and flavors a little overdone."
"EDIT: Future tastings actually have me even questioning if this IS a good beer. I just don't like it. It's all coffee and very little else. I'd say the 2010 version is even more so. I'll pass on this one, and I'm a giant Great Divide fan."
"One note, I think this beer may contain caffeine - I had a bit of trouble sleeping after this one, but it was worth it."
"Overall: Love it! The best of the Yetis!"
"D - Drinkability is honestly a bit low on this one. They have taken a big beer, and made it way bigger with wood and coffee. Hugely complex and intensely bitter, it kind of reminds me of turkish coffee. The bitterness is a bit over the top for my taste. The espresso may have added to the aroma but, for the most part, I think it just hurt the drinkability by making the beer so bitter that it is kind of hard to finish a whole glass."
"D: More drinkable than you would think. I could go through a couple of these without too much trouble"
"Oveall, this is my favorite Yeti yet. It is also the most highly drinkable. I will probably get a few bottles, but I have no idea how this will age due to the high amounts of coffee."
"I prefer the regular Yeti Imperial Stout over this one as a ""regular"" in my refrigerator, but will definitely have it again in about a year!"
"Overall this is very good, though I like the regular Oak Aged a bit better. Still, for coffee fans this is a beer that definitely warrants trying, and for that matter it warrants trying for anyone."
"Draft at the tap room. Pour is black with a dense brown head. Some lace left behind. Strong coffee nose with a bit of chocolate. Strong coffee flavor as well that levels out to a bitter chocolate finish. Thick and rich with pricly carbonation. Dry lasting finish. Really damn good."
"A great big beer as is expected from a sibling of a great family. The bitterness is a little over the top. This beer could benefit from some age to balance the bitterness."
"I declare that Espresso Stouts and Bourbon Barrels are the best marriage since Peanut Butter and Chocolate."
"If you can afford it buy a case +1. Drink one and treat yourself in the months to come with a beer that will likely age very, very well."
"A snowy Sunday in GA made for perfect day to try the Espresso Yeti. A fresh bottle, bottled only a couple weeks ago, purchased at Green's, so that espresso flavor should be front and center. Pours a dark, ink black, with a robust dark tan head. That head recedes very slowly. Smell is an incredible mix of sweet chocolate, and strong espresso/coffee aroma. Taste is also incredible, an upfront hit espresso combined with a bitter chocolate and malt backbone. It really is as close to a perfect balance as you could find in a coffee imperial stout. Compared to some other imperial stouts, this one is a thicker composition, and I like it. Incredibly easy to drink for the style, I found myself easily sipping the entire bomber while watching the snow fall."
"Drinkability: Spoiler Alert: It's absolutely delish, what can I say?! Rich flavors that know no bounds. Sometimes I'm hesitant to drink an entire bomber of something by my lonely, miserable self, but I cleared through this bottle in record time. One to sip and savor slowly, but it's hard not to chug it greedily like an insatiable fiend."
"Take a world class RIS, oak age it with vanilla, then infuse it with a ton of deep roasted espresso beans, and you've got something special. Pours pitch black, completely opaque with a frothy 2 finger dark caramel colored head. First sip is super strong coffee with lots of dark chocolate bitterness. Brown sugar, tobacco, and vanilla notes support the massive bitterness. Drinkin' this beer is like chewing coffee grinds and chasing it with dark chocolate. We are not done. No sir. There is a strong hop profile that amazingly steals the finish. Creamy milkshake-like mouthfeel is much loved and appreciated. Replace your morning Starbucks with Espresso Yeti and it will be lunchtime before you know it."
"Notes - I don't think I understood how hard this sucker was to come by until after the beer fest. I'm glad I got a chance to try it. Further edited upon trying it by the bottle."
"Hard to beat the original, although this beer is a worthy addition to the ""Yeti"" name."
"Poured a dark black color with brown edges and a large sized off white head. Nice lacing left on the glass. Aromas of espresso, vanilla, chocolate, some woodiness, and roasty. Tastes of wood, some dark fruits, roasty, chocolate, and lighter vanilla. Coffee more apparent in the aroma and the oakiness was more in the flavor. Alcohol content well hidden."
"Had this on tap at Brickstore Pub. Came out as a chocolate black with traces of a milk chocolate head. Looks good enough to eat. Smells is slightly hoppy, chocolate, toffee, and, of course, coffee. Taste is exceptional. The coffee is prevalent with traces of chocolate. Very well balanced. The coffee and hops create a bitter ending that balance the malt very well. Silky, creamy smooth mouthfeel going down. Tough to drink more than one, but this is definitely one of the better beers that I've had recently."
"I loved the Oak Aged Yeti so much that it shouldn't be surprising but I enjoy this version even more."
"This is a standout beer."
"Comes out of the bottle a rich opaque chocolaty sable with a thick brown head. Aroma is like a rich coffee and has a strong undertone of hops with a firm hint of chocolate, like a good IPA mixed with a fine mocha. Flavor has a strong coffee component, a hoppy overtone, and more than a hint of unsweet chocolate, with smoky and nutty hints. Texture is pleasingly smooth and thick, and finish is coffee-ish and a little hoppy. I thought there was no way to combine ""stouty"" and hoppy flavor - I am glad that I have been proven wrong!"
"Drinkability - This is where most Great Divide brews shine. For being 9% and an Imperial Stout, this one is fantastically easy drinking."
"D - This is a great dessert beer. Either as a liquid dessert or as part of a regular dessert. I'd just love to pour this over a couple of scoops of vanilla gelato."
"D: This is a big beer - malt and abv. Definitely an dessert beer to savor (slowly)."
"Viscous, black color, short but thick cap of foam. Swirling leaves good legs and thin lace. Very nice coffee aroma, lightly roasted. Slight chocolate, woody, and vanilla. The taste is great. The espresso coffee flavor melds nicely with the stout. More roasted malt and chocolate, and the oak and vanilla comes through as well. Rich, full body, but still easy to drink. Creamy and smooth, the alcohol is not a problem. Very enjoyable!"
"This one goes way too quickly, but still, sip it anyway and savor as much as you can. Won't be easy - awesome stuff."
"D - This is a great beverage, but filling. Not too sweet with a nice coffee flavor, but a couple of these and I'm stuffed."
"The body is big but still easy to drink. The coffee really does a nice job balancing the astringency and alcohol notes and makes this a very enjoyable beer. A silky texture with a great blend of flavors."
"D - this beer is really good and has nice complex flavors."
"The Espresso version is 9%...really its too strong for me to enjoy. It tastes too hot. I sipped a small 10 oz. glass of this beer, and I was drunk afterwards. The appearance is black, nice color, but there was zero head."
"D - this beer is so f'ing delicious. Of course, the drinkability is limited by the massive body and ABV, but damn if I didn't love this. Would gladly, no, make that instantly, sample another if given the chance. Highly recommended if you can get it."
"A beautifull stout. Near black color with a silky, lacy dark tan head. The nose has lots if roasted malts and piney hops. These are complemented perfectly by chocolate, molasses, oak, licorice, anise, and dark fruits. The taste is even better than the smell. A delicious balance between sweet and bitter flavors. Nice full body goes down well. This is possibly the best beer Great Divide has ever made. Right up there with the best in the world."
"D: This goes down too easy"
"An extremely impressive beer from Great Divide. This is great stuff!"
