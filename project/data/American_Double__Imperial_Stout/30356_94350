Although it is impressive that every flavor and ingredient that is described comes through nicely in all it's balance, it's the way the peppers show through that sets this apart in my eyes.

4.98,10.9,5,5,5,4.75,5,"Chili peppers right out of the gate! Followed by the cocoa, dark chocolate and coffee in the nose. Super dark brown color with ruby reddish hues when held to the light. Liquid oily thick viscosity yields a frothy top layer of micro bubbles and spotty patches of lacing along the glass edges. Bold and complex flavor profile is surprisingly simple. Tastes like chilies, then evolving into the sweet chocolate and finishing with the bitter dark roasted coffee. Soft and gentle carbonation allows for each sip to be enjoyed on the palate and finishes extremely well with very little heat from the chilies or alcohol. So easy to drink and no way to tell it clocks in at 13%. To summarize; Bomb! will go down as one of the more amazing Imperial Stouts I have had the privilege to indulge!","dpgoblejr","Mar 22, 2015"

Chocolate is also present. The taste is coffee forward along with a complex blend of sweet milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and vanilla. There is a vegetable taste from the peppers that I do not care for. I get medium heat from the chilies and very minimal alcohol presence for the ABV. The mouth feel is very smooth, but I would prefer a little more body. This is a very well crafted beer and I would like to have it again; but I don't care for the vegetable taste.","danh53","Mar 02, 2015"

The nose is predominantly roasted coffee followed by rich spicy Mexican chocolate. That's exactly how it tastes, also. Peppery dark bittersweet chocolate predominates over the roasted coffee and grilled breadfruit.  There is very little gas in the mouthfeel which is just right, not too thin or too thick.  Overall close to perfect. I hope to try a bourbon barrel aged version in the future.","tomfneph","Feb 20, 2015"

The longer it sits the more flavors you smell. This is one of the best beers I've had. I would definitely buy it again. I recommend anyone to try it if they haven't already.","Matt1978","Feb 20, 2015"

The spice from the peppers provides little heat, which isn’t a bad thing necessarily. The thinner mouthfeel for the style, coupled with a dry/slightly chalky impression, makes this beer easy to drink.

Pretty easy to down this one with little effort. My brother who has been shying away from stouts recently was totally impressed with Prairie Bomb, as was I.  This will be one brew that I will continue to try to get more of for sure.","ricknelson","Dec 04, 2014"

I could probably drink Xocoveza all the time, this is a once in a while kind of brew. It it impressive nonetheless and I am happy I had the opportunity to try it. Still not found a 5 beer, but this one is damn close. My only complaint is that it was a bit thin on the mouthfeel, not really thin necessarily, but for the alcohol and flavor profile it would be amazing if it was a bit more viscous, I believe it would totally be a 100 beer or damn close, if it were.","humuloner22","Nov 30, 2014"

The nose is absolutely huge and complex, dominated by big roasty coffee and surprisingly strong chili notes.  Hints of dark chocolate, cocoa, vanilla, espresso, and leather.  The taste mirrors the nose with all the featured elements sharing the spotlight equally.  Huge roasty coffee with fudgy dark chocolate, cocoa, espresso, chilies, and vanilla.  The mouthfeel is thick, creamy, and mouth-coating with incredible balance and huge drinkability with subtle chili heat on the finish.  Overall, this beer delivers in every way.

4.3,-4.2,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Overall, we’ve been hugely excited for this beer, and are wonderfully grateful to have found it when we did.  We were honestly not sure if we would truly ever get a chance to try it, actually, as our timing as of late seems to have been perfect for always missing it.  Alas, here we are, and what a massive beer it is!!  We were actually taken aback here.  From the description of the ingredients the base beer was aged over, and the sweeter aroma, we were so, so surprised at what a bitter flavoring was presented.  If anything, this simply acts to slow the drinker down so that they can savor each sip.  This bitterness is primarily in the form of acidic coffee bean roastiness, cacao, and yeasty metallics.  All of the inclusions blend expertly together, but each of them are powerful enough to stand on their own, at the center of their own beer.  Actually, the chili peppers are rather subdued.  This was likely intentional, so as to produce the most widely marketable beer.  Not just something chili-heads like us would seek out for the heat.  This is a super-duper beer, and amongst the most serious and thoroughly top-quality we’ve ever come across.","TheBrewo","Nov 03, 2014"

Upon opening the bottle you are quickly greeted by all the ingredients with aromas of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla beans with all these working in perfect unison.  This is even more demonstrated in the flavor with a blend of all these with a persistent chili spice that is persistent throughout and stays right in the back of your mouth.  Most impressive is how hidden the alcohol is with little to no booziness in the finish.","Tuck_leepulin","Sep 08, 2014"

Then, soon, uncompromising, burned coffee bean notes get detectable, which counter the established, rich, earthy sweetness by adding an almost dry bitterness to the beer, while hot chili peppers lend a hot, spicy background depth. This spicy sting stays on the back of the palate till the very end, altough the beer finishes with great chocolate qualities, blended with bitter coffee tones. Complex, slick and smooth in the mouth, a full-bodied, fantastic beer.","aleigator","Sep 01, 2014"

The coffee flavor was superb, but what held it back from being a world class 4.5+ beer was there wasn't much of a third flavor blended in.

I found the BB to be much spicier than this beer, which was liquid perfection to me. It pours black as night with a nice head that doesn't stick around too long. Smells of vanilla, cocoa and oatmeal with very light chile. The taste follows the same, the chile hits a little at the end, but it is much subtler here than in the Bible Belt. I loved this beer and I can't wait to get more. The spice of the chiles is in perfect balance with every other flavor of the beer.","tmbgnicu","Jun 21, 2014"

Strings of carbonation bubbling throughout the body. Aromas of rich roasted coffee, butter cocoa nibs, subtle pepper spice, smoke and tobacco highlights, woody highlights, and hints of molasses. The smoke and tobacco build the more you dig in. Flavors are coffee and chocolate forward, like a mocha fist to your taste buds. Wow...perfectly balanced and flavorful. The pepper notes are very subtle, but you begin to notice a building warmth in the backbone of this brew. Woody and vanilla notes flit in and out to accent, but never draw attention away from the beer as a whole. The body is smooth and big, yet light, as well, thanks to the carbonation. A coffee heavy aftertaste, with an overall roasted feel. The finish is slick, smooth, and light, with a subtle warmth and bitter linger. This is a great beer. Big characteristics all around, but amazingly drinkable!","GarthDanielson","Jun 16, 2014"

Taste gets a bit more complex with amplified notes of what you smell… No vanilla at all for me, kinda disappointing there. Feels great on the tongue like any good RIS. As I said at the beginning this is a good beer… this is not a great beer. Abraxas is a vastly superior mexican style imperial stout.

Taste is very solid, but like the smell it was just a little too heavy on the coffee and hop finish. I really liked the subtle hint of chile but its very slight so its added very well. Biggest highlight to me is how this 13% beer is so light and not boozy at all. Feels like an 8% Stout. Overall I highly recommend a sampling but I can't quite put it into that top tier with a small handful of others that I liked better.","bubseymour","Jun 13, 2014"

Smell is of rich dark chocolate and dark coffee. Smells like a big stout. Raisins and molasses come through as well. Taste is out of this world. Dark chocolate and burnt coffee throughout with the slightest touch of heat at the finish. Mouthfeel is about perfect for me too. Coats the mouth well, tingles the palate and the heat at the end ties everything together. Overall one of my favorite new beers. Gotta have this if you love stouts.","toppoop","Jun 13, 2014"

This was a good beer it was just grossly overpriced, $5 would be much more appropriate. Dark solid black, coffee colored head, looks pretty rich. Aroma was a touch of chocolate and thick imperial stout. Flavor had notes of chocolate but I didn't really pick up much coffee or peppers.

4.77,6.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"This is a hyped beer that clearly has earned its praise. Pours a pitch black color with a mocha brown head, and barely any head ever accumulates. Smell is muted at first, but as it warms up milk chocolate bursts onto the noise with some coffee as well. First sip is creamy and smooth with vanilla and sweet chocolate melting on the tongue. Then as the sip settles a strong coffee bitterness pops and brings the roasty malts along with a tiny bit of that pepper. Also, at 13% there is hardly any alcohol presence to speak of, to the point where I almost forgot to even mention it here. Mouthfeel is creamy and sticky as it warms up. Full body and mildly carbonated. Overall, this is an incredible beer and I highly recommend seeking it out. Im not usually the biggest fan of coffee forward stouts, but the smooth vanilla/milk chocolate superbly balances the coffee bitterness and roasted malts.And for reference this was fresh, so It'd be interesting to see how this ages.

Unbelievably smooth with just a minor hint of chile flavor and virtually no residual heat. I could drink this all day/night/day...!","Dawgboned37","May 20, 2014"

Smell: vanilla, milk chocolate, light earthy and caramel espresso. A little chili. Taste: milk chocolate, caramel, sugary plum, vanilla, espresso note - earthy, building chili heat (and then after a while it's no longer noticeable). Medium bodied with light carbonation and very creamy. Easy drinking for the abv. This really showcases the aging adjuncts... I'd question whether the base beer has anything going on, but there's no point in that as the result is very tasty.","babaracas","May 03, 2014"

4.27,-4.9,4.25,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,"Minimal carbonation and lacing, no bottling date so don't know the age on this one. Smell is primarily coffee, with some vanilla sweetness and there is definitely evidence of the chili peppers. The taste parallels the nose, predominantly coffee, with hints of vanilla and chocolate, and then only a bit heat from the chili peppers on the finish. It is remarkable how well everything comes together in this beer. For as complex of a beer as this is, it is exceptionally smooth. A little too much dominance by coffee for my personal preference, but a highly recommended brew. Cheers","VeganUndead","Apr 17, 2014"

4.49,0,3.5,5,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Looks the part of an imperial stout. Black, coffee colored head, poor head for that matter and poor retention. This is par for the couse on impy stouts though, especially one of this strength. One of the most remarkable aromas on a beer I've found any time in the recent past. Huge aromas of vanilla, cacao, coffee. The vanilla aroma is wild. So many beers with vanilla in them the vanilla comes across as chocolate, or cacao, but this is vanilla and huge. Love the other subtle aromas too, chocolate, some earthy quality from the chili. Vanilla comes on first wafting over the palate followed by earthy pepper flavor. This all melds with chocolate and cacao. Alcohol pops up here and there but especially the finish, though it is hard to seperate the alcohol heat from the chili heat. Thick, rich, full, what else can you say. Overall the only fault of this beer is that it is slightly hot, but I don't think that could be fixed given the strength. Otherwise so amazing.","pmlondrigan","Mar 14, 2014"

Pours a black, black, viscous body with a chocolate brown two finger head that dissipates at a medium pace. I can also smell all the ingredients: coffee, cacao, vanilla, and chile peppers. Taste is more, a lot more of the same, deliciousness that hit the nose. Overall, I really loved this beer. Really glad I was able to try it, and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a complex stout that blends its flavors with the utmost harmony.","tbryan5","Mar 11, 2014"

The numerous flavors blend together rather seamlessly, and the alcohol is incredibly well masked. The only downside to this brew, which is kind of a big one, is the price point... $8 for an imperial stout is more than a bit expensive, and will certainly keep this out of any kind of regular lineup or trading for it more than once in a great while. But with that said, a delicious brew, extremely well crafted. I would recommend everyone to try this at least once.","cjoc83","Mar 09, 2014"

Im glad the pepper fades for the most part, though it compliments well enough....something I rarely find works for me in a stout. Its like a s'mores with cayenne. I would assume to add alcohol to that, but the ABV is ridiculously integrated to where it tastes more like a Convict Hill than a BCBS. This is my first Bomb, and I was skeptical of the high ratings and the red pepper...but this is one of the best high ABV stouts I have ever had. It is not as complex and fruity as a BCBS, and likely wont develop as much with age, but right now, this is a phenomenal beer.","twiggamortis420","Feb 26, 2014"

Taste is vanilla, milk chocolate, dark roast coffee, and a dry burn from the chilies.  Nice warming chile/alcohol finish.  Mouthfeel is light upfront, but the chilies and coffee leave a nice lingering oily flavor behind. Overall this is still a great beer (especially at it is becoming a shelf beer).  Perhaps not quite as complex as Huna,  but a bit more chile forward.  Definitely a favorite.","OneEye78","Feb 08, 2014"

The taste was excellent with the initial flavors of coffee & cocoa, followed by s light vanilla in the middle with just a hint of heat from the chilies on the end.

There appears to be decent carbonation, some lace while drinking, but no sediment. The nose is initially cocoa and roasted coffee when chilled - notes of vanilla, caramel, some licorice, and booze come out as it warms. The taste is predominantly bitter and roasty coffee upfront, which is then smoothed out by the cocoa and malt sweetness and finished by lingering booze and bitter cocoa. Chilies? Naw son, don't get the heat, flavor, or scent (though they are possibly contributing to the beer's bitter finish?). Otherwise, the beer has bold, identifiable adjunct flavors, nothing is too muddled. For being 13-14% abv it has reasonably hidden booze, which is no doubt related to its sweet, full body, silky mouthfeel, and generous carbonation. For a stout this big, it's quite drinkable and maintains that shelf-status appeal. I'd drink this again, probably not if I'm out somewhere, but it's certainly appropriate for that day when you're just hanging out in your PJays and decide it's definitely 5pm in the middle of the Atlantic, so why not?","ThePorterSorter","Jan 31, 2014"

There's a nice bitterness to this. Nice and oily, it coats the tongue without being particularly thick. This is a superb beer.

I don't pick up much ancho, as I'm sure its raisiny notes get mixed up with the malty aroma. Chocolate is strong in the flavor, with the vanilla and coffee acting as accents to it. I get a lingering bitterness in the finish, which comes across as more hop than burnt malt/grain. I don't perceive the 13% at all, which is an incredible feat. The ancho warmth is very mild. If I didn't know it was in the beer, I'd assume it came from the alcohol, but it lingers a bit. Carbonation is a bit prickly, but the body itself is full. This is totally different from all the other Prairie offerings I've had (which have been fantastic), but it's equally impressive.","goochpunch","Jan 23, 2014"

I just can't find that many examples (believe me, I'd buy them if I could find them). If I could score a few more bottles of this, I think I would get used to the chili peppers and the taste would eventually get bumped up to a 5. I really like the way the flavors of vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and chili peppers all unfold one after another on the palate. Prairie is just an extraordinary brewery.

Aroma of some dark fruit undertones, cocoa nibs, mild coffee, licorice, vanilla, chocolate and some sweet molasses. A sweet aroma which stays in balance and does not become cloying. Taste is savory and has notes of chili pepper, chocolate, dark dried fruits, raw cocoa nibs, licorice, fruity roasted coffee and vanilla. In the aftertaste you get the spiciness from the chilis which blend in nicely with the roastiness of the beer, but there is something missing in terms of complexity as a result of aging and the “fullness” of an imperial stout. Medium bodied with decent carbonation throughout. This was a dangerously drinkable beer with the high alcohol maskable fairly easy! However, I do have to go against the grain here and give this a rather outstanding rating just below excellent as there were several components to this beer that were missing in terms of complexity and being able to provide for a more memorable drinking experience.","CuriousMonk","Jan 08, 2014"

4.46,-0.7,3.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours out dark as night with a one finger brown head with decent retention and nice lacing. Smell is of coffee and what I would describe a green peppers. They just seem to smell very fresh and a almost as forward as the coffee. I certainly smell some raisins and other dark fruits in the background. Seems to be some burnt malts in the background as well. Taste is coffee forward with some chocolate I didn't smell in the nose. I can certainly smell some burnt malt and the more I drink the more I taste nice peppers in the background but nothing is too overdone. Just a hint of vanilla too. This is a really well balanced beer for so much going on. Mouthfeel is actually quite thick for what I expected given the head when I poured it out. Overall this is an amazingly good beer. It's one of those beers that one waits to find but don't find very often to be sure. This is an amazing beer that is well put together that I would recommend to anyone who likes a tiny bit of heat (nothing too much) to round off things and add to the complexity.","NeedBeerHere","Dec 26, 2013"

The chili becomes more prominent as it warmed leaving some tingling at the back of the throat. The back of the palate brings vanilla and roasted malt.

There is a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip, but I am not getting any chile heat in the throat. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

It is a stout worthy of savoring. I thought that this would be just like CBB Huna, but it seems to have something different about it that I cant put my finger on what it is. Almost all the same ingredients as Huna, but a little bit of a different animal than Huna because it not brewed with cinnamon.

Not too sweet, not too spicy, and definitely not too boozy (in the external sense, at least), rather, a deft blend of all these things, so much so, that this drinks like a regular, if still coffee and chili infused, dry stout. That said, I did my best to slow down and enjoy this, for I won't be able to get my hands on another bottle anytime soon, and of course, the more obvious reason - the 28-proof alcohol.

4.53,0.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,"Pours a pitch black, motor oil color, with a medium mocha colored head. Scent is chili- forward at the beginning. The spicy chilies come through up front with bittersweet chocolate and espresso. A hint of oak, but so much more cocoa and more chili than I expected. I bit of paprika and some cocoa. Taste is dark chocolate up front. It quickly turns to rich chocolate fudge and dark chocolate. The chili peppers come through quickly after and balance out the rich chocolate. This beer tastes like chocolate cake with chocolate frosting, with jalapeno sprinkles on it. So damn tasty! Drinkability is scary high. Overall, possibly the best chili stout I've ever had. The high ABV is well-masked. Such a unique and special beer that I'm happy I have more of.","DovaliHops","Sep 13, 2013"

Everybody is coming out with their version of the cocoa, coffee, vanilla, chili (and usually cinnamon) imperial stout...always sounds outstanding, but the execution of these stouts have been hit or miss to me. I was finding it a little hard to believe that this could be as good as people have been saying. In actuality, I think it might be even better than people are saying. Tons of flavor - lot of nuance. Everything seems to work together quite well, even with so much going on. I wasn't particularly impressed by the appearance, but everything else was outstanding. This is a super imperial stout.

This is basically a big and wonderful coffee stout with a little chocolate to back it up. If I didn't know it had vanilla and chili beans I doubt I ever would have picked it up. The coffee pretty much dominates the whole brew BUT it is delicious coffee so how can I really complain? I had just hyped it up as more, if I'm honest. One of the times where hypes detracts from the experience, unfortunately. Don't get me wrong, fantastic coffee stout regardless. With just a litttle bit of heat.

Smells bold and rich, not much pepper in the nose. Taste is smooth with heavy coffee and roast followed by a strong presence of vanilla which mellows the intensity of the roast. Right at the finish is when some heat begins and puts an exclamation on all the flavor. Delicious. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth wih mild carbonation.

The best way for me to describe this is like drinking a tootsie roll. It has the sweet chocolate flavor while providing a small hint of coffee. As the beer warms, the chili flavor comes through and sits on your tongue. Overall, one of my top 5 beers.","AZBeerDude","Sep 02, 2013"
3.53,-21.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"You know you're conflicted when you want to drop this bottle (due to the name), but you also know that doing so would waste a potentially great beer. ... Anyway, this stuff pours a very dark black-brown topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises dark and lightly-acrid coffee, vanilla bean, light oak, and a good helping of earthy greens. The taste holds notes of earthy coffee, roasted malts, and light dark chocolate powder. The body is a hefty-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, I don't get the love professed for this beer. It's fairly boring in terms of spiced-stout characteristics, and the peppers are really nowhere to be seen (save in adding some green earthiness to the proceedings). No real complexity is to be found. Nothing about this beer brings much in the way of comparisons to Hunahpu (which I'm not even the biggest fanboy of) and its ilk. I mean, it's not a bad beer, in all honesty, but it's nowhere near as good as I've been hearing. I just don't get it...","TMoney2591","Sep 02, 2013"

Smell is mild coffee, slight pepper, anise, and the darkest chocolate one can find in the store, I'm talking 90%+ cacao. Taste is coffee and chocolate, with a warming pepper burn at the back; the black roast lends a tannic quality that balances what sweetness would be expected from a 14% stout. Man, that pepper burn is sticking- I don't think it is alcohol, this is a lingering, smoldering salsa type burn. The dark chocolate is truly prominent in the flavor profile on this. Mouthfeel is thick without being cloying, the carbonation is fine and works to make this beast more quaffable. I approve of this beer.","youradhere","Aug 15, 2013"

I very rarely give otu a 5 in a category, but it is hard for me to imagine a finer smelling beer. The flavor does not disappoint with a powerful blend of chocolate and vanilla bean with mild pepper heat. It's hard for me to believe this beer is 14% because it was gone before I knew it.

Aroma is big bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, bitter coffee, and big time peppers. Much more pepper presence than Hunapuh here. Smells rich and creamy until the pepper bite comes through. Silky mouthfeel with lowish carbonation. Super huge chocolate here with a perfect bite from the pepper that blends seamlessly with the earthy coffee. Decedent for sure. Not sure where the vanilla comes into the flavor but it doesn't matter. It is good anyway. No trace of the huge ABV on this one. A great dessert tonight after my steak.","BMMillsy","Aug 04, 2013"

4.36,-2.9,4,4.25,4.5,4,4.5,"Prairie Bomb pours a midnight black in color with maybe a quarter inch of dark mocha lacing. The pour was a little light in body for an imperial stout, especially for a beer of 14%. The nose features a healthy dose of cocoa, coffee, and vanilla yet they all team together to provide a soft and delicate dessert of a nose. The pepper is subtle. The flavors are smooth and chocolaty with a nice level of vanilla. The coffee is present but takes a backseat. The pepper is present more in the aftertaste than anywhere else and it does have the ability to linger for a few minutes, which is welcome. It's a nice amount of pepper. There could be more but it does possess more spice than most. It drinks light for the style and really doesn't give any indication of being 14%. This is an impressive beer, especially for the price. I'd compare it to a lighter version of Hunahpu, but with coffee.","aasher","Jul 05, 2013"

The aroma is big on vanilla, chocolate and coffee. More of the chili comes out as the beer warms. Fairly sweet aroma but nothing comes across artificially. The taste starts out with a bunch of vanilla and chocolate. Coffee and roast come right behind. Rather sweet but there's enough flavor bouncing around that it doesn't dominate. Mild but noticeable chili burn in the finish. It adds a welcome layer of complexity to the beer. Things would probably get a bit too sweet without that little burn. Nice thick mouthfeel. Very smooth and full. This is an excellent imperial stout. There's lots of flavor and it all plays well together. Great work from Prairie.","popery","Jun 23, 2013"
