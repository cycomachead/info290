Definitely on par with Founders Breakfast Stout if comparing to a pillar of coffee stout style.","TheElectricOne","Yesterday at 04:48 PM"

You can certainly get fragments of the espresso as well chocolate mocha, but most of it is the roasted coffee, not that it is a bad thing.  It has a smooth feel & finishes pretty easy.","ajm5108","Tuesday at 05:02 PM"

I rated the regular oak aged Yeti higher, but thats because it was aged a few years and was less bitter. Enormous espresso aromas and flavors. The oak character adds a very nice complexity to it. This is underrated if you ask me, and would be up there with Breakfast stout if the aftertaste lingered longer.","Bone53","Mar 16, 2015"

Coffee really sets in strongly after but maybe very noticeable for me because I don't drink coffee.  Not much sweetness and any hops is hard to pull out. Very creamy mouthfeel. Wow 5 minutes later coffee flavor still lingers strongly. This was very good and I look forward to comparing with others.","hotpauko","Mar 15, 2015"

The aroma is redolent with espresso and vanilla. The taste is a bit bracing -- bitter espresso, heavily roasted malt, and a surprising level of hop flavor. Still, the vanilla from the oak lends a bit of smoothness. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than expected; Imperials tend to be more viscous, but the oak aging probably took a bit away from that. Regardless, really nice, aggressive Imperial Stout. Almost as wonderful as Stone's Espresso Imperial Russian Stout from 2013.","JFear","Feb 26, 2015"

Would make a fine breakfast food pairing brew, but also works great as a warming, slow sipper. I tried this beer fresh since it is easily obtainable locally for, to determine if I want to buy another to let age. Yes! Definitely buy a second one to let age, has a decently noticeable hop profile that will surely fade with age and make the malt much more deep and robust. Highly recommend to fans of the style!","Beer-Revelry","Feb 06, 2015"

Huge roasty coffee nose with hints of dark chocolate, espresso, cocoa, coffee grounds, vanilla, and subtle oak. The taste is bold and flavorful with the roasty espresso front and center. Hints of dark chocolate, cocoa, leather, coffee, vanilla, booze, bitter hops, and a ton of oak as it warms. The mouthfeel is thick, creamy, and mouth coating with medium carbonation and a dry, bitter finish. Overall, this is a bold and flavorful beer that you don't have to sell your sister to get.","beerdrifter","Aug 02, 2014"

First glance shows a very nice brownish tinted black color and thick khaki colored head that stays till the end; even though reduced only to a layer of carbonation bubbles by that point. Roast, maybe some ash, and of course the coffee dominate the nose. The espresso coffee is extremely upfront and noticeable on the taste buds mixing with roast and smokey ash as it finishes. Smooth, slick mouthfeel and quite easy to drink is what this brew has to offer. In the end, as a chocolate stout lover, I found the coffee too strong for my liking but I still really enjoyed indulging in this stout. So glad I found and had the chance to try it!","dpgoblejr","Jun 15, 2014"

The nose is big and robust and loaded with coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa nibs with a massive dark roasted malt backbone. The flavor follows suit and features rich malts (dark and roasted), espresso, dark chocolate, vanilla and finishes with hints of tannins from the oak. The body is big with just the right amount of carbonation lending a full, rich, meaty mouthfeel. Overall, this is an excellent beer and for $10 off the shelf, no waiting in long lines for one 12oz bottle, no crazy trading, this is a steal!","mtomlins","May 05, 2014"

All the glorious pictures of Espresso Yeti are a freeze-frame in time. The head will flatten quickly in time ticking reality, almost as quick as your done pouring. I dunno. Maybe other pours will prove different. And the feel, the carbonation is subdued. A below average range. Thank goodness the body is creamy and flavorful to where it sips like a stout-spiked mocha-coffee. So one isn't all bent out of shape about carbonation. And there is a persistent slight sizzle that keeps the beer from being flat. Kudos. Mind you, the look and feel are still better than most beers. Espresso Yeti is Heaven On Earth if not Actual Heaven.","shacawgo24","Apr 17, 2014"

I get this same aspect in the beer as it is medium bodied, slightly chewy, and smooth with oak notes and a minor vanilla like sweetness. The coffee taste is strong and really noticeable on the backend and finish as this beer finishes real dry. I like the balance and how this beer first hits me with a sweet edge and then finishes dry and just tempts you to have another sip.","clayrock81","Mar 29, 2014"

It felt quite roasted and the espresso didn't thin this beer out enough to make it feel completely true to form. While not a bad choice, this wasn't an improvement over the other Yeti's that Great Divide offered and after a while, I got the impression that variations on a theme are only worth it if they augment the original in some way. Coffee and caffeine addicts may get something out of this but for me, this was only worth a go one time around. Just a bit too generic for some that came across as being different from the pack.","JerzDevl2000","Feb 17, 2014"

I already had their oak aged IS and trusted them with the barrels, and in this one they proved that they also know how to balance easy-to-oversell flavors like coffee. Very palate-pleasing, great look and feel, and dark enough to put hair on your chest without tasting its bitterness for hours afterwards. Try it with breakfast!","1000lbgrizzly","Oct 07, 2013"

Poured with a thick, milk chocolate colored foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap that left random sticky lacings on the glass. Sweet, mellow vanilla, dark roasted malt, rich, dark chocolate and freshly ground coffee aromas. Rich, thick, smooth feel. Dark, roasted malt and sweet chocolate flavors up front with hop bitterness on the edges. Flavors mellow through the middle as chocolate and vanilla flavors take over. Finishes with dark roasted coffee and malt flavors with vanilla beneath and hop bitterness on the edges. Incredibly smooth and mellow flavor and feel.","IronLover","Oct 05, 2013"

Nicely roasted without being overdone, the oak aging takes the edge off but leaves this subtle woody campfire taste in the profile that's mostly about rich, dark sugars, from caramels to chocolate, without being at all thick and cloying. This would be the beer to have snowbound with a roaring fire and several friends playing board games. My defining standard of a beer is, am I profoundly disappointed when I reach for another quaff and I discover that it's all gone? In this case, the answer is a definitive yes.","BuckeyeSlim","Jul 01, 2013"

4.41,3,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours black, about as dark a beer as I've ever seen, with a gorgeously thick, frothy head of slowly receding tan cream on top. The coffee presence is brighter than expected, not so dark and oily as most espresso roasts. Sweet and woody with milk chocolate, a variety of vinous fruity esters, and some toast. Heavier roasted malt in the mouth...dark coffee bean, cocoa, and oak. Faint vanilla and char towards the end. Rich, but nothing close to cloying. Thick and beautifully creamy going down easy with a touch of heat after the swallow. Very, very nice. Some alcohol creeps into the flavor, but plays nicely with the wood. Excellent integration of coffee into an already terrific base beer.","wedge","Jun 22, 2013"

4.32,0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled 1/10/2013. Pours dense pitch black color with a nice 1 finger dense dark tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Good soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malt, light char, vanilla, oak, toast, toffee, and light floral. Fantastic aromas with great balance of coffee and dark malts with moderate oak character. Taste of dark chocolate, espresso, roasted malt, light char, oak, vanilla, toast, toffee, light pine, floral, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, espresso, roasted malt, light char, oak, vanilla, toffee, and light pine on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of dark malt, coffee, and oak flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic imperial coffee stout as expected. Great complexity and balance of coffee and roasted flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 14, 2013"

Quick side note: On the side of the label it says ,"Pairs well with breakfast burritos, eggs benedict, and hash browns..."" I dont see this pairing with hash browns lol. Goin off a hazy bag-wine-hangover memory, this beer starts completely black and thick with a big 'ol chocolate head. Crazy sticky lacing. Nice subtle aroma of rich chocolate and coffee. I didn't realize this was oak aged even though it says it in HUGE letters on the bottle, so I didn't notice any oaky flavors coming out very aggressively. I didn't notice any oak at all. Pretty cut and dry brew. Coffee, chocolate. But oh so damn good! Just so many levels of those two flavors. It's nuts. Full thick body. Nice crisp carbo. Classic baybuh.","stumac","Feb 09, 2013"

Roasted earthiness and malt, espresso, vanilla-touched oak, bakers chocolate on the nose. Big roasty and malty espresso notes, underlying oakiness, charred biscuit, earthy dark chocolate, vanilla, burnt raisin and molasses. On the finish bittering hops make their presence known along with bitter dark cocoa, and more general roastiness. Big full body that means business, yet velvety and creamy. Moderate, gentle carbonation. An exceptional variant of Yeti. The addition of coffee here actually adds complexity rather than overpowering the base beer, a downfall of many imperial stouts that have coffee added.","chanokokoro","Feb 07, 2013"

Aroma of the oak chips, chocolate, espresso, and some roastiness. A little alcohol is there too, as is the norm with all Yeti variants. Flavor is a burst of espresso out the gate which then transitions into some nice chocolate, roastiness, some oak giving off some vanilla, closing out with a slightly bitter espresso bean finish. Again a little alcohol is noticeable. A fuller, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, my favorite of the Yeti series and one of my favorite coffee stouts without a doubt.","denver10","Jan 17, 2013"

4.41,3,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5," O - A damn good beer. It tastes like Oak Aged Yeti with 14 months on it, meaning that at this age is really no longer exemplifies the espresso character, although some of it is indeed still present. I was worried when I tasted Oak Aged fresh a few months back that I didn't like the brew, but I suspect is was simply due to the harshness of the fresh bottle. This beer is world class, but perhaps doesn't exactly reflect the ""Espresso"" in the title after so much time in the bottle.","greenmonstah","Mar 15, 2012"

Dark chocolate, fine ground espresso beans, vanilla and heavy cream with hints of cherries and oak chips. Sort of an overly sweet Hershey's syrup-like overall aroma. Overly huge espresso bite with overwhelming alcohol sourness and smoked wood on the first sip. Settles into a tamer dark chocolate mouthfeel while the heavy cream and vanilla flavors follow. Ends with smooth, milky cacao with a sour espresso finale. Lower carbonation with a medium sized body. I guess i was expecting something smoother and richer: what i got was spicy and aggressive.

4.23,-1.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured from a bomber into a tumbler pint, the beer is a jet black coloring that looks viscous and smooth, with a thick, foamy, dense, dark chocolate colored head. Pours beautifully, and looks delicious. Aromas are heavy in mocha coffee, with a dark, bitter characteristic to it, as well as a highlight of sweet, creamy chocolate. Flavors are super bitter, with a hint of the alcohol into the roof of the mouth and the sinuses. The palate is completely coffee based, with a strong, roasted, dark presence throughout that is heavy in espresso, with an earthy and woody balancing undertone. Minimal cling that slips down the glass slowly while you drink, catching up to the surface of the remaining beer if left for more than a minute. The aftertaste has the roast coffee and bitterness of spent coffee grounds, with a somewhat drying effect. The finish is rich, robust, and eerily similar to a pressed espresso lingering behing on the palate, with a boozy kick.","GarthDanielson","Feb 10, 2012"

There's a bitterness that rears it's head right behind the coffee character. This beer is pretty big, lots of flavor and some complexity that will deepen over time. I'm excited to see how this beer gets after a year or more. 3 bottles in the cellar.","eslemarc","Jan 17, 2012"

However, shy away from an aged version of this style if you are looking to get a dominant espresso quality. My only advice is that I would suggest sharing this beer with one or two other people, as the woodiness can become a bit sore on the palate as you make your way through.

Plenty of coffee in the aroma, and for the most part, equal parts chocolate. The oak chips come through nicely and you definitely can't miss the woody notes it invokes. No real alcohol on the nose. The espresso really shows through more in the taste: very bitter and sultry. Chocolate makes it's self known, with touches of vanilla and a more balanced oak character. Again, too much going on to note and heat in here. Body is full and it has a very pleasant creaminess. I'll have to get a fresh bottle and see how much more pronounced the espresso is. Great stout.","EgadBananas","Aug 06, 2011"

3.95,-7.7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"O: I've had this beer before, and it must have had a lot more age on it because I thought it was a lot better. This beer really does show all the indication that it's young, but the taste profile is a seed of complexity. I am really struck by how kopa luwak like the espresso is at the moment. Having had Mikeller's Weasel, I can't help but notice the similarity in the tastes. Currently the espresso is overwhelming deeper notes, but the creamy mouth is already there. Once the acidity of the barrel mellows out, and the nutty character comes out; you have a winner. This beer is much better with time.","Cavery","Jul 23, 2011"
4.15,-3,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"O: This beer is really very delicious. I wonder if the woody character would come down with age, and if so just how delicious it can get. Whether you've had much experience with esspresso stouts or not I think you can pick this up, enjoy it, and admire it for its wonderful execution. I repeat my previous concern though, as it stands, there's too much wood/oak in this that tamppers down the more savory and sweet flavors in a way that's a little overbearing. If the woodiness disappears with age or with a different recipe, I'd have no problem giving this a 4.5+.","Klym","Jul 23, 2011"

I insist, however, it has less to do with the presence of coffee and more to do with the lack of typical Yeti characteristics: spruce-y, spicy hops and rich dark chocolate malts, both of which are relatively less pronounced.

The aroma is mainly of expresso,with hints of chocolate and roast malt. The first sip reveals a nice coffee/expresso flavor,followed by bitter chocolate and burnt roasted malt.

3.77,-11.9,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D/O: This imperial stout is distinguished well from its Yeti siblings by the addition of coffee. It has big coffee qualities, but they are effective in the way they are integrated into the base beer. Unfortunately it is tethered to that dark beer-acidity that can turn a good stout into a challenging stout that becomes wearisome quickly. Here acidity is more prevalent than in other Yeti varietals, probably an unintended contribution of the coffee. The drinker must take the good qualities with the less-palatable when it comes to coffee in beer.","beagle75","May 29, 2011"

Hints of the oak as well. Coffee aftertaste. This one is tasty but thick and sweet. Probably couldn't drink more than 1 and that one sitting will take awhile.

4.09,-4.4,4.5,3,4.5,4,4.5,"Espresso Yeti pours night black, with a tall, burnt caramel head. The foam cap has the consistency of key lime pie, and has crazy stamina. Lacing is very good, rings of foam are left stuck to the inside of the glass. It's just short of where it needs to be for a 5 though. The nose is entirely too one dimensional though. It smells almost like straight up cold coffee, with just barely a appreciable hint of dark chocolate. The beer comes across with much better balance on my palate. Coffee is still the star of the show, but rich dark chocolate has a much bigger presence. Anise comes in in the background to further balance the beer. Any kind of hint of oak or vanilla would really finish this beer off, but the flavor profile as is is pretty outstanding. The body is everything you'd want in an imperial stout... rich, creamy, and smooth. I'd be willing to bet there were some oats in the grain bill. Unfortunately, the carbonation is a bit over the top, coming across as a distraction at times. Espresso Yeti toes the line for how coffee forward a beer can be for me, but manages not to cross it, and the result is one of the better imperial stouts I've had in a while.","axeman9182","Mar 24, 2011"

The taste has hints of cherry, oak, caramel, roasted malt and of course coffee. The mouthfeel is nice and velvety, with a slight note of carbonation on the tip of your tongue.

All the usual suspects are there to comfort me; vanilla, oak, coffee, plenty of roasted malt & even some hops. Great body. The astringency that comes with the bitter coffee notes is really well balanced. Overall excellent mouthfeel for the style I'd have to say. A must try for lovers of oaked stouts, coffee stouts, vanilla porters and the like. Oh almost forgot, alcohol no where to be found in the nose, taste or mouthfeel. If it was 10.5 or 11% that might be a complement, but a 9.5% ahhhh, honestly I think there's room in this delicious brew for another couple hundred pounds of malt.

It reminds me of a mocha with an extra shot of espresso in it to give it that jump in bittering roast.

The Yeti poured out very dark brown with nice lasting head, hewed somewhat reddish brown. The beer presents a very strong aroma of coffee, toasted malt, and alcohol. Upon first taste I was initially overwhelmed by the coffee, but found the flavor to be much more complex after additional sips. The bitterness of the coffee and roasted malt pervades but is accentuated by the slight oak flavor. The beer has a nice heavy mouth feel predominant in beers of this type. I enjoyed this beer, and even though not a coffee lover, can appreciate the great execution by great divide.","Bslied","Jan 31, 2011"

They obviously have a winner with this line of beers, and this one is no exception. I would have liked the espresso to be a bit more noticeable in the flavor, but that is a fine line to walk to not over-do you with roast. I think that they played it on the safe side with this one.

4.07,-4.9,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"A very solid beer. Somewhat austere, not as lush as the chocolate version, but also not as straight up woody as the regular oak version (which I'm not a huge fan of). That one is simply a demonstration of using too much oak. This one pours black with a tan head that fades just a little too quickly. Smells toasty with oak and espresso and a touch of cream. The roasty notes of the coffee and stout blend nicely. The taste is quite dry, with more of a woody austerity than a lush creaminess. Full coffee notes, with a nice flavor, but not exceedingly bitter or over the top. Instead you get a nice lingering roasty bitterness, some bitter chocolate, and a touch of cream, with the oak drying things out and playing a supporting role. A little unbalanced, but enjoyable. A little woody in the mouth, and quite bitter. A sipper, would be a good dessert beer to cleanse the palate.","Georgiabeer","Jan 20, 2011"

The oak and espresso are faint but definitely there and provide an excellent accent to an already good RIS, the oak is a bit more prominent in the finish. Also a faint hop bite towards the finish. Mouthfeel is heavy but creamy smooth, not overly sticky or cloying at all. Surprisingly drinkable for such a big beer.

The oak aging definitely helps to round it out a bit. This is a sweet beer but deceptively little alcohol taste comes through. The espresso hits you up front with a lingering malty finish with tastes of vanilla. The beer does not taste as viscous as it looks. This is a full bodied beer but it does not feel as thick and oily as I was expecting, There is a little bit of viscosity on the tongue, but not a lot. This beer is very drinkable for 9.5%. My beer was bottled on 4/2/10 (cheers for date stamps!), I am enjoying this fine beer almost seven months post bottling and if anything I think it was too soon.

I don't have a hard time telling apart the coffee flavors from the stout. Sticky sensations lingers on my lips while it feels like I just took a sip of coffee. There a little hint of wood in the bite. it blends with the coffee, it takes a few sips to realize the oak is there. It's a good blend, not the best, but pleasant enough.

(Now that's good- er...actually pretty crappy political commentary. Sorry. I'll try harder next time.) Regardless, I was pleasantly surprised to find this cryptozoologically-inspired brew on tap here at CK. It pours pitch darkness into the glass, with a sad excuse for a dirty bubbly head. (Apparently one of Mermaid Man's nemeses procreated and settled atop my beer.) The smell is of darkly roasted coffee (I know, I'm shocked too), chocolate, and a tiny bit o' smoked oak. The full picture is of an espresso machine powered by a camper's stone-ringed fire. (Clearly, I have no idea how an espresso machine works.) When the 'buds get at it, the coffee lightens up a bit, apparently loosened by that tactfully tasteful joke. The chocolate comes back, followed by some cream (half-and-half, I think), dark malts, and some o' that oak from before, only lighter and sans fumee. The body is heavy, but lighter than other hefty brews'. The carbonation is moderate at best, and a slight coating is found along my mouth's walls, allowing a bit o' aftertatse to linger a spell.

Leaves great lacing all the way down the glass. The smell right away for me was surprisingly chocolate followed by coffee/espresso. There was also a big roasted malt flavor as well as hints of vanilla. The taste was chocolate and coffee. A huge coffee/espresso after taste. Roasted malt was also big in the taste. Not as much coffee flavor as I was expecting as some reviews say it's too much but I found it to be almost perfect. Not overpowering by any means. The mouthfeel was perfect for a stout, thick and mildly chewy. High ABV which was nicely hidden. A very drinkable stout. Another beer from the Yeti family that is fantastic.

Full-bodied, thick and dense, the carbonation makes a decent showing of it but nowhere near able to rouse the slumbering beast. Coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, vanilla bean, licorice and butterscotch predominate, more roast leads to a drier mouth feel if not the same in terms of flavors.

Some sweet alcohol and maybe leafy hops are in there too. Unlike the regular Oak Aged Yeti, I feel like the oak in this one is not overdone. Delicious.

Full in body, slightly slippery with medium somewhat bubbly carbonation. This one was quite delicious, though a bit heavy on oak, but probably the least offensively oaked version of Oak Aged Yeti.

The smell is actually more boozy than expected. I thought this beer would mellow with a half a year age on it. I can definitely smell the oak and chocolate, but I'm struggling to find the espresso on the nose. A quick swirl of the glass only brings up the alcohol aroma. Definitely smells sweet and roasty once you get past the hot alcohol presence. As far as taste goes, it's a grand slam. You get a rush of sweet fruits and alcohol, but it is mellowed quickly by a very nice coffee and cocoa presence. It seems like the cocoa sticks to your tongue, making for a very nice mouthfeel, almost like the way a sugary hot cocoa leaves a residue of sticky chocolate on your tongue. Very nice. Wouldn't consider this one too drinkable, might be better with a little aging. I attempted to keep this one as long as I could, but it was calling my name.

It does taste pretty darn good and goes down quite easy but it sort of reminds me of a McDonald's chocolate shake, not that this beer tastes like a chocolate shake, but more so what it feels like after you've finished a chocolate shake from McDonalds. You knew you wanted chocolate going in and it was good while you were drinking it but when you finished the shake you already have forgotten what it tasted like. Yes, it tasted like chocolate but beyond that there was really nothing more there, you asked for chocolate and that's what you got, nothing more. The same thing sort of happens with this beer. You get what you were expecting, maybe even a little less, it tastes good but beyond that there was nothing else there, the depth and complexity that you find in other stouts was not there, the dark fruits, the earthiness, the roasty/toasty flavors that dry the tongue after an initially dark and fruity kick are not here.

Minimal spotty lacing is left on the glass. The aroma conists of roasted malt, vanilla, and hints of chocolate and espresso. I can taste the oak barrel influence on this beer but where is the espresso? Roasted malt with a slight burnt and charcoal element is the main flavor element. Hints of vanilla and chocolate as well. Slight taste of alcohol in the finish and has a warming affect. A burnt bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. The body is thick, rich, almost decadent with soft carbonation. A good stout but it is missing the claimed espresso flavor so the score gets lowered. The concept is a definate winner but just not perfected.","morimech","Aug 09, 2009"

Great retention as it slowly fades leaving a wall of fat lace and rocky bubbles. Body is thick tar blackness. Nose has tones of smoked malts, espresso beans, dark fruits and even faint minerally hop character. Wow, they were going for an espresso feel(of course) with this one and they hit it o the nose. The first thing you taste is full rich espresso feel that is silky as it glides across the tongue. The second thing I notice is the distinct oaky feel which I may have overlooked as hops on the nose. Definitely more oaky than the other aged Yeti. As you drink that oak feel really wears on the tongue and becomes to dominate for me. Mouthfeel is of oak and dry dark fruits.

But the label states ""You can now have Yeti with breakfast", and I think that's true as well, which really says something about it's drinkability. I think it would pair well with a spicy, salsa-infused breakfast burrito. And I think it would also work as a bitter springboard for the desserts they suggest. That said, I'd call it pretty damned drinkable - at least in the world of bigger beers.

I'm a coffee fan and appreciate the use of it, but this beer is equally as good as Oak Aged Yeti. Both are better than Yeti, if you ask me. I really like what Great Divide's doing right now...blazing the trail. I've had a couple of the handful of new releases they're rolling out and they're impressive. Keep up the great work, guys.

Slightly sweet, and the strange celery smell that I've picked up in a few beers before.

Rich espresso notes comes out greatly as it warms up. Alcohol is well hidden but becomes slightly warming as it reaches room temp. Creamy, thick, chewy, unbelievably smooth, light carbonation.

3.73,-12.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"It looks just like I want an Imperial stout to look. Black, shiny, with a massive brown head. Poured into a small snifter. I could hardly see any highlights, though the lighting in the restaurant wasn't incredible (still daylight when consumed though, so not a problem). Nice looking. The smell was light on the coffee, very light on the wood (maybe it was too old to get the full force). There were some dried fruits, a tiny bit of sweetness, heavy on the roasted malts. The smell, without the oaking (which adds some vanilla and woody, earthy smells) and coffee (which enhances the roastiness) was about average, but the extra stuff pushes it beyond average. I kind of liked the smell, though it could be better. The taste was right on. I mean, everything was there, but the only drawback was just that the base was a little too estery (maybe a little too hot). There was coffee, vanilla, a tiny bit of wood, some decent sweetness (not quite enough, in my opinion), roast barley, everything. Wish there was a bit of bready sweetness. That is all I wanted. But I found that this had everything else I expect, in fact, it exceeds what the average person does by quite a bit. I mean, if I judge it along the others, it more than deserves the score, if I judge it by my own standards, it just about earns it. The wood and coffee help the mouthfeel, of course. This one doesn't cling like regular yeti, it isn't too harsh or rough, it's just nice and pleasant, a bit better than normal, but not incredible. I drank this one down rather quickly, and enjoyed it. I would ask everyone to try it, I mean, I wasn't a huge fan of the regular yeti, and if you weren't a fan, this was much better. Try it if you can (it may be too late now). worth a shot.","taylorhamrick","May 20, 2009"

I didn't smell any coffee, maybe no oak either, this just smelled like yeti. The taste was better, I got the oak and chocolate (still no coffee), and lots of roasted malt.

Almost Kate-like. That stops as I continue to drink and I get a bunch of oak, bitter, bitter coffee and some alcohol burn. The bitterness dominates as I continue to drink, but I don't mind this.

Smells of roasted malt, espresso, baker's chocolate, floral hops, oak, molasses, coffee, and slightly burnt brownies. Tastes of espresso right off the bat with some citrusy hops following close behind along with a touch of dark fruits like raisins and plum. Roasted malt, chocolate, molasses, and light vanilla notes make an appearance as does some nuttiness, anise, and wet oak before a finish of charred coffee grounds and bitter hops. Full to medium full in body with moderate carbonation. Thick, smooth, and creamy but with a chewy finish, hides a majority of its ABV well. Not overly coffee'd out, just a nice extra push from regular Oak Aged Yeti to incorporate more balance into it. A nice Imperial stout, but a little on the bitter side.

Head dissipates within seconds into a cluster of bubbles and a frothy band around the edges of the glass. Some spots of lacing appear as the brew recedes. Nose suggests espresso roast and bittersweet chocolate. More espresso roast in the mouth, but taste is somewhat charred and bitter rather than roasty. Some woody characteristics, but missing the vanilla. Bitterness lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied. Some carbonation burn on the front of the tongue, but as it dissipates it leaves behind a residual milky slickness. Alcohol is well-hidden on this one, but balance is off - way too bitter.

Great choice for this beer. Appearance, what can I say about it, it just looks awesome in a coffee mug. My friends kept coming over and asking if it was coffee or beer. The head reminded me of what a nice espresso froth is supposed to look like. The beer itself is opaque black with maybe a slight brown hue to it. Smell, to me was of a nice coffee/espresso and chocolate and maybe a slight toffee note. I get little to no hop bitterness with this beer which I would say is do to the espresso being there. Taste, this has to be in my top 10 list of beers that I have drank. Takes like a mocha cappuccino almost, very chocolate and milk texture with a hint of oak and vanilla. The taste is very complex but with each sip you find something new. Mouthfeel, very heavy and full bodied. The beer seems like it would stain your entire mouth and I could have sworn my tongue turned brown because of it. Drinkability, very drinkable and warming. If I could afford it and my liver could take the abuse I would switch this out with my morning coffee and wouldn't be able to notice. Even though its served cool the alcohol warms you up from the inside. I love the oaked yeti, but this has taken its place on my list as what to look for when I go on a beer run. I can't wait to see what this beer is like with some age on it as well.","nhudson","Mar 16, 2009"
4.43,3.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"D: This beer is damned good. It didn't disappoint in the least. This is by and far the best of the Yeti line. I was really disappointed by the Oak Aged Yeti, and I was sceptical going in. It is amazing how this espresso quality makes this beer damn near perfect. The flavors, aromas, and feel are on point. The look is damned perfect. This was a great beer experience from the start and I will drink this beer every opportunity I get. Damned good brew. Fanfriggintastic. Drink this shit.","everetends","Mar 15, 2009"
3.85,-10,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Had this the other night at RFD in D.C. and it was definitely an interesting brew. Everyone loved the bottle and was taking pictures with it threw the night in different spots in RFD. Poured into a pint glass and immediately you see the very dark brew pour out with a lovely brown chocolate head forming. Smell was of Espresso and Chocolate. Taste was over the top Espresso, with chocolate. Towards the end of the brew I was hit with some bitterness and fruit flavors. The brew it's self was very interesting and I was glad that I had it, but for $20 at the place was allot to pay for it. The Espresso flavor is very very dominate threw out the beer, so make you keep that in mind and that you are up for the blast. At the time I was honestly not able to finish it due to the overwhelming strong taste of Espresso, but i am sure more serious stout drinkers would have little problem with it.","BZero007","Mar 15, 2009"

One word of caution is to watch out for the 9% alcohol. It snuck up on me and I was feeling pretty good very fast.","beerman207","Mar 15, 2009"
3.83,-10.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"This one is...interesting. Not exactly what I thought it would be like, but I like it better than the regular Oaked Yeti. Still would prefer many other coffee beers over this, especially with the $10 per bottle tag. I had to try it though.","roadhouse","Mar 14, 2009"

4.15,-3,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"D - Drinkability is honestly a bit low on this one. They have taken a big beer, and made it way bigger with wood and coffee. Hugely complex and intensely bitter, it kind of reminds me of turkish coffee. The bitterness is a bit over the top for my taste. The espresso may have added to the aroma but, for the most part, I think it just hurt the drinkability by making the beer so bitter that it is kind of hard to finish a whole glass.","nickfl","Mar 10, 2009"

4.55,6.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"A snowy Sunday in GA made for perfect day to try the Espresso Yeti. A fresh bottle, bottled only a couple weeks ago, purchased at Green's, so that espresso flavor should be front and center. Pours a dark, ink black, with a robust dark tan head. That head recedes very slowly. Smell is an incredible mix of sweet chocolate, and strong espresso/coffee aroma. Taste is also incredible, an upfront hit espresso combined with a bitter chocolate and malt backbone. It really is as close to a perfect balance as you could find in a coffee imperial stout. Compared to some other imperial stouts, this one is a thicker composition, and I like it. Incredibly easy to drink for the style, I found myself easily sipping the entire bomber while watching the snow fall.","bhalter8","Mar 02, 2009"
4.55,6.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Drinkability: Spoiler Alert: It's absolutely delish, what can I say?! Rich flavors that know no bounds. Sometimes I'm hesitant to drink an entire bomber of something by my lonely, miserable self, but I cleared through this bottle in record time. One to sip and savor slowly, but it's hard not to chug it greedily like an insatiable fiend.","ChainGangGuy","Mar 01, 2009"
4.4,2.8,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Take a world class RIS, oak age it with vanilla, then infuse it with a ton of deep roasted espresso beans, and you've got something special. Pours pitch black, completely opaque with a frothy 2 finger dark caramel colored head. First sip is super strong coffee with lots of dark chocolate bitterness. Brown sugar, tobacco, and vanilla notes support the massive bitterness. Drinkin' this beer is like chewing coffee grinds and chasing it with dark chocolate. We are not done. No sir. There is a strong hop profile that amazingly steals the finish. Creamy milkshake-like mouthfeel is much loved and appreciated. Replace your morning Starbucks with Espresso Yeti and it will be lunchtime before you know it.","ATLbeerDog","Mar 01, 2009"

4.6,7.5,5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured a dark black color with brown edges and a large sized off white head. Nice lacing left on the glass. Aromas of espresso, vanilla, chocolate, some woodiness, and roasty. Tastes of wood, some dark fruits, roasty, chocolate, and lighter vanilla. Coffee more apparent in the aroma and the oakiness was more in the flavor. Alcohol content well hidden.","hopdog","Feb 25, 2009"
4.65,8.6,4.5,4.5,5,5,4,"Had this on tap at Brickstore Pub. Came out as a chocolate black with traces of a milk chocolate head. Looks good enough to eat. Smells is slightly hoppy, chocolate, toffee, and, of course, coffee. Taste is exceptional. The coffee is prevalent with traces of chocolate. Very well balanced. The coffee and hops create a bitter ending that balance the malt very well. Silky, creamy smooth mouthfeel going down. Tough to drink more than one, but this is definitely one of the better beers that I've had recently.","jdubjacket","Feb 24, 2009"

4.88,14,5,4.5,5,5,5,"Comes out of the bottle a rich opaque chocolaty sable with a thick brown head. Aroma is like a rich coffee and has a strong undertone of hops with a firm hint of chocolate, like a good IPA mixed with a fine mocha. Flavor has a strong coffee component, a hoppy overtone, and more than a hint of unsweet chocolate, with smoky and nutty hints. Texture is pleasingly smooth and thick, and finish is coffee-ish and a little hoppy. I thought there was no way to combine ""stouty"" and hoppy flavor - I am glad that I have been proven wrong!","Cyberkedi","Feb 20, 2009"

These are complemented perfectly by chocolate, molasses, oak, licorice, anise, and dark fruits. The taste is even better than the smell. A delicious balance between sweet and bitter flavors.
