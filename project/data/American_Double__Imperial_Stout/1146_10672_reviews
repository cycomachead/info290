"O: Very intense. Worth savoring each sip. One of the best bourbon beers out there."
"Amazing in every aspect. Highly recommended"

"opened up a 2013 the other night...mouthfeel and flavor exceed any other stout ive had the experience of trying"

"I've never loved BCBS...For my palette I have always picked up way too much of the smoked hickory / wet wood aroma & taste.  It is certainly unique & complex and all that jazz, just not for me.  It reminds of a camp fire after it has been rained on.  The bourbon / oak / vanilla is mixed in there somewhere but the charred elements overwhelm it."
"This is a 2012 bottle that has been sitting in my cellar for about 2 years  at this point.  The beer itself pours with NO head at all, almost no ringing at all.  The beer is inky black, not redness on the edges here.  The nose is rather subdued here, unlike most stouts, I have no hint of coffee at all.  There is some mild candied fruit, but it is very mild.  The taste is  a bit malty up front, quickly fades to some very sweet malt, and then fades with a lingering boozy sweetness.  This beer has great mouthfeel and is silky smooth.  Beer is a bit boozy, but nothing extreme.  Its also a bit sweeter than anything that I am used to but its not bad at all.  Its an interesting beer, but nothing I would buy again."
"Glad I have had the opportunity to have this multiples times and was able to get my hands on a couple of bottles."

"Being from Michigan I've been able to have kbs and bells blacknote. Bcbs is fantastic and just slightly better than previous mentioned. Smell is amazing as is the taste worth the hype."
""
""
"For the 2015 vintage I like the 14.4 ABV over the 13.8"
""
""
"FEEL: In a word: sumptuous. Rich and oily. Thick and chewy. Sticks around long after you finished swallowing."
""
""
"The type of beer I can just stick my nose in the glass and smell for hours. Taste can get a little cloying, though. I've only had it fresh, but I bet it would be 5/5 if aged for a year or two."

"This, for me personally, is the most amazingly put together barrel aged stout. I love how thick and heavy it is."
""
"Move over KBS cuz GIBCS is the real deal. This 08 vintage bottle relinquished a snifter of indian ink as black as Joan Jett’s chopped locks. The sweet smell of bourbon and roasted malt rose up into the air to greet me. This beer is thick and almost syrupy with taste of vanilla, sweet malt, bourbon, and coffee.."
""
""
""
""
"Amazing! Would have preferred a thicker head but overall this was delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very tasty but not my ideal type of Stout. Indeed it was too syrupy as others have noted."
""
""
""
""
"O: I've had the best of them, including all the years of this bad boy. 2014 may need to sit another year but this year's has done an incredible job."
""
"Black pour with a blood red tinge on edges in my chalice .  Thin brown head. Caramel, toffee and bourbon nose - as it warms, the scent reminds me of biting into a caramel apple at the fair-fresh fruit and candy satisfaction. Initial taste is caramel candy and toffee with a bourbon linger. Semi sweet caramel as liquid warms tempered by oak/whiskey background. Creamy medium plus mouthfeel and alcohol bite on tongue-as it warms, sticky sweet. Overall, outstanding. Big, velvety, boozy. Simply put: heavenly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Was not overly thrilled with this. A little too syrup-y for me"
"Outstanding... Duh.  We all know it."
""

"Great chocolatey, boozy, bourbon taste. Gets even tastier once closer to room temp. Will taste it anytime I find it in bottle or on tap. A classic."
""
""
""
""
"Bottled 8/8/2014. 14.4% version, huge dark chocolate in this one. some dark fruits but chocolate and bourbon dominate this. amazing brew."
""

"Bottle. Restaurant.  Approximately Cellar to start.  Beautiful looking dark beer with minor head.  Smell includes chocolate with strong roast that is almost coffee-like.  But also, strong bourbon.  That smell mellowed a bit over time. Flavor was similar to smell.  The bourbon mellowed a bit during the middle but reappeared toward the end.  The mouthfeel redefined what a score of 5 is to me.  Incredibly smooth, creamy, thick, lush.  I do not care for a strong bourbon taste and this has it, even though it's a bit mellow, but I would drink this again just for how it feels!  If you like bourbon aged stouts, I strongly suggest you get ahold of this beer."

"Had this beer at the amazing restaurant in Bethlehem called Corked on 3/10/15."
"Boozy but smooth with a strong smell. A good sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
"Perfection in a (tulip) glass. This stout is certainly a beauty to behold; it is as black as coal, with no head (which is okay for the style). The smell is harder to describe, but you can tell it will be worth your while. Upon tasting this masterpiece of a beer, one is immediately overwhelmed by the flavor of bourbon and vanilla. This will be a wonderful experience, of course, if you appreciate bourbon. Such was the case for me. The mouthfeel was indescribable. Silky smooth yet effervescent at the same time. This is absolutely a world class beer!"

""
""
""
""
"Almost creamy taste very drinkable"
""
""
""
""

"The flavor profile is World Class.  This is quite intense in terms of bourbon and alcohol and results in the complexity being slightly muted by these intensities.  Balance is reasonable, all things considered, as the other flavors pop in the middle.  It begins with bourbon over a rich caramel and chocolate sweetness.  As the bourbon fades, alcohol comes to the forefront.  In the middle, the alcohol flavor masking effect fades and the complexity of this stout becomes discernible.  Waves of vanilla, sweet chocolate and slight plum cascade over an oak background.  The finish is a slow fade of sweet caramel and vanilla over a receding oak.  The finish leaves that burn at the back of throat, an astringent alcohol pucker and a touch of sweet caramel and chocolate."

"The Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout gets its reputation for a reason.  It is a full tilt face melting drinking experience that starts at your lips and rides down your throat grabbing every pore of your internal orifice on its way.  The beer poured an opaque black with a subtle tan head.  The bourbon aroma hit me when I opened the bottle and continued to waft from the glass as I leaned in for my first anticipatory sip. I also detected vanilla and hints of anise coming from the glass. The taste took over my mouth with a huge hit of bourbon that melded into large doses of vanilla and cocoa. There was a slight burnt bitterness at the tail end that lingered along with the bourbon.  The BCBS was a big bourbon bomb that was surprisingly smooth and drinkable considering the ABV.  With more and more Bourbon Barrel-Aged beers on the market it is still at the top of the list and one that should be emulated.  In the end: You don’t drink a BCBS, it drinks you."

"Extremlely smooth taste, with just a bite of the Bourbon. I would like to try the Stout without the Bourbon to see the difference. You hardly notice the 13.8% ABV. Excellent around beer."

"Fuck AB-InBev, overpriced crap. Figure it out, then release it please."

"12 oz. bottle poured into Cigar City snifter... Holy guacamole this is what all beer should be like"
""
""
"The standard by which Bourbon barrel aged stouts are to be judged."
""
"Overall, this could be a beer that needs to be tried on more than one occasion in order to awake one's senses. Bravo Goose Island!"
"I wish it was in a bigger glass"

"Such a big flavor. 2014 version. Tasted this only a couple of weeks after release. Barrel age flavor hits you up front with sweetness and bourbon and coffee coming in later. This is a lot to take in. The booze is not in the flavor, but in the feel after a couple of sips."

"12oz bottle of 2013 vintage into tulip during #bottlecherwednesdays at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach. Black liquid with thin tan head that barely sticks. Aroma is full-on bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, and wood. Taste is unbelievable! Big hit of booze, sweet chocolate, fig, and vanilla, some roastiness. Full bodied, low carbonation, beautifully silky and chewy texture, finishes with a nice warming sensation on the way down. Clearly outstanding!"

"I had a 2014 recently.  I felt it was a little too hot and probably needs 6-12 months to improve.  I also felt it felt more syrup like that smooth?  I look forward to a second round in the summer."
""
""
""
"One of the best beers I've tasted. Really only second to the Bourbon County Coffee Stout."
""
""
"Still the best beer I've ever had; drank one on a recommendation from the waiter at Bilbo Baggin's Green Dragon in VA.  Just superb all around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"all around basically perfect!"
""
""
"It’s quickly apparent why people make such a bug deal of this limited release: it’s absolutely delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the perfect stout in my opinion.  The look and smell are great.  I like the slightly boozier taste of this beer.  Very easy to drink."
""
""
"Boom clap.  Draft into a 12 oz brandy snifter.  Pours a deep viscous black with no head at all - guessing the high ABV killed the head.  Smells of caramelized sugars with hints of roasted malts, vanilla and booze.  Tastes are dominating by complex vanilla flavors from the barrel and the bourbon.  Stout or coffee is barely noticeable.  Sort of like a smoother 3 Brothers Resolute but not 14 Surly Darkness Rye Barrel Aged smooth.  Lots of alcohol but subtly hidden.  Ridiculously drinkable high ABV beer.  Medium bodied in the mouth.  Not as thick as you would expect.  Silky.  Not the best beer I have had (14 Surly Darkness Rye Barrel Aged) but not far either.  It's up there. Extremely good beer and one you would age and enjoy for years to come. World class."

"2014 is great right from the tap.  So well balanced for a bourbon stout."

"2/7 (Home) - 2014 Bottle. Have been a big fan of this beer since the first time I’ve had it. Whiskey is my non beer alcohol of choice. Distinct whiskey and carmel smell and taste is what I love about this beer. The beer is very strong, and pleasant to drink, The texture is smooth, and the blend of flavors works very well. Excellent beer and I look forward to continued drinking of the stout, and their other offerings (have a BC coffee on tap)!"

"Great beer definitley a top 10 favorite"
""
"Dark as midnight, chewy, fantastic aroma,"
""
""
""
""
"Unbelievably smooth and easy to drink for something so strong."
""
"Had this on tap finally. I think it's a great BA stout, but honestly it's very very overrated. I was looking for this to blow my mind but it was pretty much like every other BA I've had, except way more bourbon-y. The balance seems a little off.  I will say though, for close to 15% this drinks smooth as hell."
""
""
"I cannot shake the in your face bourbon in this beer."
"O- very flavorful, delicious brew"
""
""
""
""
""
"I prefer the coffee one over this one, but still one of the best beers I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
"Exceptional bourbon stout, wish I had more!"
""
""
""
"Heaven in a bottle. Outrageous on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not much I can add here that hasn't been said. To say this beer is well crafted would be an epic understatement. One of the few that actually lived up to it's hype."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours thick and black into my snifter. Smell is incredible and taste is magic. Sweet and boozy with bourbon, chocolate and vanilla all showing up here. As it warms, these flavors increase. This is a top five beer for me. A true masterpiece."
""
"Overall: It's not rated a 100 for nothing. This is not the best beer I've ever had, but it's up there. Extremely good beer, and one I will enjoy for years to come. That said, I only bought one bottle, and I think that was enough for me until next year. This beer sits with you for a while. World class."
"One of my favorite bourbon stouts. True bourbon taste hints of coffee yet blended perfectly"
""
""
"I get it--it comes with the beer Connoisseur training package, but there are other imperial stouts that deserve our attention more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Three Lions wasn't lying this is incredible."
"Overall.  What is there to say really?  It's a near flawless beer.  If you enjoy barrel aged stouts then you need to seek out this brew.  If you aren't familiar then this would be a great place to start but beware because setting the standard with this...this benchmark will leave you let down by a large number of other beer claiming to deliver a similar product."

"O - A very very intense taste and smell.  Very sweet, and the alcohol really packs a punch.  Not a light and easy drink but very tasty, nonetheless."

"Had this both on tap and from a 12 oz. bottle this week. Better on tap but a tough find. Way more boozy and tighter from the bottle, hold a bottle for a year. An outstanding stout with rich, multifaceted flavor. Mouthfeel is viscous perfection. Chocolate, prune, worcestshire sauce, and bourbon flavors all prevalent. More complex from the bottle but eminently drinkable on tap. Makes for an epic after meal sipper. Highly recommended."
""
""
"Not your traditional beer, a little heavy with an awesome taste and finish, a definite get for the bourbon lovers."
""
""
"O-  A prime example of a barrel aged stout.  Almost flawless.  Highly recommended and always look forward to its release."

""

""

"GREAT BEER ! I wish I could buy this beer everyday. I heard its better after about a year, but I couldn't wait that long lol"
""
"Truly a world-class stout. And the ABV is off the chain."
"This has become the bar by which I measure all bourbon stouts. There is a strong and distinct bourbon smell and flavour to this beer, though it is mellowed and sweetened on the tongue. Very hard to find (especially the further from Black Friday you get) but worth picking up and stashing a few away. Ages very well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The 13.8% ABV is apparent. Would recommend to the bourbon whiskey enthusiast. Very harsh if you take a big gulp, but overall very smooth. Not too bitter, with a very strong bourbon flavor, a little dry. Get 1 bottle before trying the whole pack, it can be hit or miss by person. Don't let the strength sneak up on you, drink it slow."

"The best stout ive ever had."
""
""
""
""
"Superlatives run aplenty for the BCBS. All deserved. Loved every sip."
"I let this beer age for two years at about 50 degrees, don't know if that's the perfect temp but it turned out amazing! The I think aging these bourbon county beers is the key. I've tried it as soon as I bought it and it was much better once its aged. The flavors really shine through this way. Try it and I think you'll agree"
""
""
"2013. On tap. Just awesome-the year of age definitely was much improved"
""
""
""
"2012 vintage. Sets the standard for BA stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
"Now I know what all the talk is about."
""
""
"Pitch black pour with a viscous, syrupy body. There is a slick, chewy feel to this beer with the bourbon notes hitting you from the outset. Great interplay between oak and vanilla with a hint of anise and smoked malt. Recently also had a sample of a 2007 bottle. Wow. Aging BCBS is going to give you phenomenal results, with a mellowing and deepening of the flavor profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2010 vintage. Great amount of oak influence and a nice roundness.  Bottled 09/24/2010."
"how I like my women...thick and rich.  King Fischer says he'd rather just drink bourbon"
"Overall: While its certainly boozy, the benchmark for bourbon barrel  stouts."
""
"Very nice stout. It's a little boozy, but very smooth."
""
"The most incredibly, perfect balanced beer I've ever had. Alcohol, dark fruit, bourbon, dark chocolate, coffee. All perfectly in balance. Each sip leaves you wanting another."
""
"Bottle on 1/9/15.  Pours black in color with less than a finger of head. Good lacing. The aroma is roasted malt, bourbon, caramel, chocolate, and vanilla.  Good mouth feel.  The taste is roasted malt and bourbon with some chocolate, vanilla, and caramel.   Very nice bourbon barrel stout."

"Drinkability – Definitely a fantastic bourbon stout."
""
"Wow, this is just perfect! I'm glad to check this off my list and not to let the price scare me away. Unlike some beers this one lived up to the hype."
""
""
""
""
"Extremely Good, especially with a little age on it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm so tired of people bad mouthing BCBS and Goose Island in general, just because they're owned by ABInbev does not mean they aren't still dedicated to the craft. What it does mean is that I get to enjoy this beer because thanks to AB it has distribution to Hawaii! Cheers!"
""
""
"I was actually a little hesitant to buy this beer on Black Friday, but much to my surprise, i absolutely loved this beer. I tried a few different Bourbon stouts (including Avery's Uncle Jacob's Stout) that day, but the Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout took the cake for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a BIG beer.  Looks amazing with the black as night coloring - can't say anything about the head as there wasn't any.  Awesome, but damn does it have done alcoholic overtones. Thick to the point of syrupy."
""
""
""
""
"I would encourage purchasing this item."
""
""
""
""
"Awesome beer! Great flavor. Just wish I could try some of the others."
"This is the perfect beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice.  5 stars"
""
""
"Amazing.  Very strong bourbon flavor"
"Delicious.  Fantastic beer, full of rich flavors and incredible to the nose.  A little on the flat side and I wish the head didn't evaporate so quickly (less than 1cm and gone within a minute).  Super strong abv and totally smooth.  Every time I have, I love it even more."
""
"This is the best bourbon barrel aged stout I have ever had!  So much smoother then all of the competition in this category.   This is a must buy if you can find it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not as complex or intense as some newer barrel-aged stouts, but so smooth and balanced with all the elements tightly integrated."
"Honestly, I couldn't believe I came across this bottle in a relatively small town. Grabbed the last bottle immediately. Didn't expect it to live up to the hype, but it definitely has."
""
""
"I guess it's just me.  I really like stouts, porters and dark ales more than IPAs and I like bourbon on it's own just fine, but I haven't found a bourbon stout yet that I liked.  I split a bottle with my son and didn't even finish it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I was a little buzzed when I drank this, but I instantly sobered up to enjoy the experience, and man am I happy I did. This was back in early 2014 when I imbibed this fine beverage, and haven't been able to find it since, but I'm so happy I got to try what was referred to me as the father of all stouts by the bartender ( I had a Six Point Resin, Goose Island BC Barleywine, Oskar Blues Ten Fidy before this). If you ever have the chance to try this, please do, you won't regret it!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely a great stout beer.."
"2014 - a great example of this beer. Big bourbon character, thick, syrupy mouthfeel. It's a balanced and delicious stout."
""
"Heavy and smooth. Best beer of 2014 by far."
""
""
"Everything about this beer is great besides the appearance.  No head.  No lacing.  It is just visual.  But it's there.  Or should I say not."
""
""
"NOT overrated. BCBS is not a beer for regular drinking, but for a special occasion when you want a slow sipper this beer is hard to beat!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer, if you can call it beer, is the absolute worst that I have ever had. Not sure how it receives such a high rating. I am a big fan of strong beers including imperial stouts and ipas but somehow this beer is just too much. Tastes like a blend of stout, red wine and bourbon. Un-drinkable in my opinion."
"One of the best beers I have ever had.  Bit too rich to drink often and I usually share the small bottle with a loved one"
""
""
""
"I mean, it's good. Just not my ""thing"". Not big on bourbon, but definitely drinkable. I don't get chocolate, but that's just me. I get more of a vanilla. Definitely not bad though."
""
""
""
""
"As good as described. Deep flavor and delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I know people swear by this stuff, but it's just not for me. I somehow managed to finish 3/4 of the 12 ounces before it met the drain. Honestly it was just awful, and the most regrettable 9 dollars I've ever spent on beer. A can of Ten Fidy with a shot of Jägermeister would have been much more enjoyable and probably less expensive."
""
""
"Very good, serviceable BBA stout. I'm confused by some of these extremely high ratings. I would not go out of my way to pursue this. There are many other BBA stouts just as good as this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely delicious! Very complex from start to finish. The wine world has nothing on the beer world!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2013 is noticeably better than the 2014"
""
""
"O: Great brew, this one lives up the hype. Thick, heavy, and potent enough at 13.8%  to make this a slow sipper. Fantastic BA stout, with wonderful depth of flavors. You can really dive into the flavor profile from start to finish and not get fatigued one bit."
""
""
""
"I'm fortunate to have found this elusive brew at my local beer store.  Real high expectations so the anticipation was evident.  Poured aggressively but no head and only a slight few bubbles of carbonation made it to the surface.  Black as night and thick like molasses.  The aroma had subtle hints of vanilla, licorice, phenol, wood, and of course bourbon.  Taste was sweet, big and bold like the smell with maybe even raisins and chocolate covered black cherries mixed about the heat of the booze. Thick, creamy, and coated the palate beautifully.  I must say I had my doubts since I've been let down before; but BCBS did not disappoint!  I loved the experience and since it's a rather big beer it is a delightful sipping stout.  Goose Island hit this aged brew right out of the park, awesome!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Immediately smells of caramel and toffee. Starts off wonderful. Shortly into it the booziness starts to take over. A very excellent beer obviously. Felt like I was drinking Rollos toffee candy. Not the best of the big BBA stouts. Definitely worth getting if you can."
"I must say goose island knows what they are doing.  One amazing beer."
"One trick pony here. Not much complexity but consists of chocolate and a decent barrel presence. I think this beer USED to be amazing but doesn't compare to the plethora of BA stouts that are around today. Undeserved of the hype."
"Slightly boozy but smooth. Some say last year was better but this year was still great."
""
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer! Creamy, chocolaty, and just enough bourbon to warm the belly and to keep your attention!  Bravo Goose Island on a wonderful beer!"
"2006 vintage...yup, she's 8 yrs old and still absolutely delicious!  Huge bourbon flavors and a big malt bill...this is just an amazing stout with big flavors...not for the faint of heart!"
""
""
"The smell of bourbon smashes the nostrils the instant you begin to open the bottle. BCBS pours pitch black and very thick. The head didn't retain too long but had a caramel appearance. The taste hits your palate with so many flavors. The huge difference above any other stout is the slight burn and after taste of the bourbon. Overall, the best beer I've had. I recommend to any stout lover, bourbon lover, or anyone wanting to try one of the best imperial stouts known to man"
""
"Uh! Awesome. Sweet on initial start. Thought I had accidently  opened the barley wine but was definitely worth the wait n line!"
""
""
""
""
"This is by far the best stout I have ever tried. I highly recommend it for anyone who says stouts aren’t good. I would typically agree, however, this could convert even the biggest haters of stouts. Normally I give a recommended pairing, but this beer needs a clean palate and an hour to fully enjoy it! An obvious 100/100 for me!"
"Poured pitch black from a 12oz bottle, 2014 vintage. Minimal, coffee-colored head. Scent was not as strong as I was expecting. It was there, and you got a hint of bourbon, but not prominent. Taste was amazing. This is quite well balanced given the style. The bourbon was foremost, but it wasn't drowning in booze as I had expected, and was mixed with sweet notes of molasses and a hint of coffee. Delicious. Feel was tremendous; just the right amount of carbonation to please the palate, but also thick and filling. This one is worth the hype."
""
""
""
"A little too thick for my taste but very strong beer. Good idea bad implementation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As I remembered it had a very thick mouth-feel and the after-feel was that of clean barley-wine buried in an oak coffin.  The entire drinking sensation was more of a neurological experience reconnecting me to smells and memories of picking fruit and stealing bourbon from my grandad's pantry that i had long forgotten."
""
"This one has been staring at me each time I open the fridge since the day after Thanksgiving. I couldn't hold out any longer. Poured from a growler dark as night with almost no head. Smells super bourbon boozy bomb. Love the smell. Taste matches right up. So much going on. Tastes better the warmer it got. Loved everything about this beer. The hype matches this bad boy. Raul was right."
"Wonderful beer. Def in my top stouts."
"2014 vintage, excellent bourbon stout....up there with kbs in every way..."
"      Overall this is one of the best beers in the world in my opinion. Beats the abyss. Beats parabola. Beats westvleteren 12.  Beats just about anything when it comes to flavor and feel, and that's all I really care about"

"12, 13, & 14 drink so differently! 12 is amazing with a couple years on it, 13 was great fresh, but awkward at a year, and 14 is packed full of bitter-sweet chocolatey goodness - I cannot wait (but I will) to see how this develops over the coming months and years!"

"Nectar of the gods. That is all I can say."

"Overall: This is an overhyped beer like no other. I bought a bunch of this one but this was the only 14.4 version I had tonight I also have the other abv 13.8, I think? Its a tasty beer, but as far as BA stouts go, this was good but its no better than other ones I have had. Maybe older versions are better. I am not taking into account the new ownership, I am simply reviewing this beer as I see it. If it was  a blind taste test, I don't know if it would get as high a review as I gave it. Maybe I should do that with some friends just to see what everyone thinks!"
"had a 2013 and it was still on the boozy side, probably needs 3 years to smooth it out... on the plus side, smells great and overall very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had the 2014 release. 13.8 Abv.  Still very strong and as expected very good."
"Poured an inky jet black into my snifter.  A few small bubbles fizzled out very quickly.  My first whiff caused me some hesitation.  Where was all the alcohol I had been promised?  Instead I received a very mild sensation of all the key components that I was expecting.  Wonderful.  First taste was excellent.  Not mind blowing, but far more integrated and subdued than I had expected.  Velvety feel, and surprisingly clean.  Clean isn't really the right word, but I expected this beer to really stick to my mouth and it didn't.  I understand why people go crazy for this stuff."
""
""
""
"Overall-  Can't say enough good things about this beer.  Perfect taste with a big array of flavors that develop as it warms and the velvety smooth mouthfeel  becomes the cherry on top.  Lives up to the hype and then some."
""
""
""
""
"Wow I well balanced beer that has some kick"
""
""
"Tastes of earthy, wooden, toasted malts, mingled together with an unbelievable chocolate creaminess, giving this beer its incredible smooth mouthfeel. Even though this is a sipper, it drinks fairly easy, as the alcohol isn't hidden, but a fundamentaly, well integrated aspect. The Bourbon builds up on the palate above the malt and chocolate foundation, inviting sweeter flavors of molasses, toffee and nougat to the taste, which not only provide a well fitting depth, but also are responsible for wrapping up any alcoholic burn in a very pleasant way, providing a rich, complex, slightly burning Bourbon character with oaken qualities to it. These then again blend well into the malts, leading to a sweeter finish, with a subtle coffee bitterness in the end, calmed by lots of bakers chocolate, exiting with a short, sharp bourbon bite."
""
""
"Tried this last night. I don't have the words to make a review. Mind blown, eyes open, I see the world through a different light this morning."
"Too boozy for me. Maybe the ones in cellar will be better next year."

"O: Fantastic stout, one of the best, not as carbonated as I remember though. Tremendous mouthfeel inundated with sweet dark fruits and benevolent bourbon. Well-balanced and quite consumable for 13.8%. Perfect for a winter evening."
""
""
""
""
"Picked up a 4 pack of this when I was in Louisiana since it was sold out here.  Lucked out and found it at a local bar on tap, haven't dug into my stash.  This beer looks like it was poured out of the oil pan of a car, light will not pass thru this.  Very small tanish head.  Great bourbon flavor on the front end and a good stout finish.  Look forward to drinking my 4 pack over the next couple of months"
""
""
""
""
"Pours completely opaque with a creamy dark tan head.  Sweet malty flavors abound are just enhanced by the aging in bourbon barrels.  Awesome taste!  Looking forward to sharing over the holidays."
""
""
"Bourbon Country Brand Stout pours a black color with the smallest tan head.  There is a huge bourbon and oak aroma.  The taste is Huge, big bourbon flavors, big oak flavors, nice warmth from the alcohol.  Flat body, but HUGE HUGE flavors.  Overall its good, it is up there."
""
""
"Pours extremely dark with scant tan head. Smells of rich bourbon. Very full bodied, thick. Fine carbonation gives the beer an almost spicy mouthfeel. Has a rich, malty, stout taste with coffee highlights blended with the smooth bourbon flavor. Perfect melding of a stout and bourbon. Beats KBS hands down."

"This beer makes most others pale in comparison!  The longer you let it linger in your mouth the more complex the flavor becomes.  It's rich vanilla, bourbon, and cocoa flavors combine with a mouth feel that creates a rich and creamy beer that looks as great as it tastes. I can only imagine this beer getting better with age and I'm going to pick up a six pack, put it away and have one a year for the next six years. I'll report back in 2020!"
"BCBS is and incredible beer... I wasn't expecting anything less. This would be my favorite BBA'd stout if I hadn't just had Bourbon Ben's Asthma by Short's, which was a *little* less hot and had a bit more of a vanilla flavor that I really like in big stouts. I'd drink BCBS any time I could find it, but I wouldn't drive around town looking for bottles of it. Then again, I'm not sure I'd do that for any beer. Still, there's not doubt about it -- this is a World Class beer. I'd love to have gotten a couple bottles so I could age one for two or three years, but even ""fresh", this is an excellent beer ... assuming you can take the ""heat."""

"I can strongly say that as far as availability is concerned this beer is distributed and if you are on top of your game and get a hold of it. WORTH EVERY PENNY! My apology for the 4.75.rating........ If I had never been spoiled by 3 Floyd's Dark Lord Russian Imperial Stout this would be a 6, of course that would be a 10 for 3 Floyd's. So seriously, I can say that this offering can be enjoyed at room temperature it is that good. There is nothing overpowering and it is a well balanced meld of bourbon, coffee, chocolate, and vanilla. It is lightly carbonated, rich and syrupy, and packs an awesome punch. It will pair well with a robust hearty winter meal or as a superior aperitif with a sweet desert. AWESOME!"

"This is the first time I've seen a truly great beer with no head at all. This surprised me. On the other hand, this stout is so dark brown as to be almost black and completely opaque. The aroma is rich with coffee and roasted malt and the tongue follows with similar flavors and others all blended together to make a unified whole that is unfathomably deep. It's viscous velvet on the tongue with no alcohol burn at all, just a gentle warming. Low carbonation. Full bodied is an understatement. One of the most remarkable stouts I've ever tasted. As long as AB/Inbev doesn't mess with this, Goose Island will remain in its lofty position."
"This is not a beer you should drink if your not a fan of hard liquor. I have tried other bourbon barrel stouts with barring degrees of intensity. But I could tell it was a stout beer. The bourbon county does not taste like stout it tastes like a straight burnt bourbon. The taste is absolutely overpowering and thick on the palate. I bought a regular 16oz bottle for around $7 and served it in a snifter as suggested on the back. I split it with a friend cause we where excited about this beer. We had trouble finishing it. And we where both rather disappointed. The highlight of this beer is when you sip it and roll the liquid around in you mouth it has a smooth pleasant taste but as soon as you swallow it burns all the way down"

"Great barrel aged beer right here! This one is making me come around to the barrel ageing process. taste is more balanced than other barrel aged beers and the bourbon heat and flavor coexists with the flavor of the stout. Awesome beer, that said no beer could match the hype this one gets. It is a solid offering but not the end all be all stout it is made out to be."
""
"this was a very intense beer. the bourbon smell, and taste is overpowering. I split this beer with someone, and was satisfied with the half I received. Definitely an intense flavor, but not too strong. All in all, I loved this beer. It was worth driving around for hour trying to find it."

"This is easily the most overrated beer I have ever come across. There was a line around the block at my local bottle shop for the release... I had to join in and try it. Well, try it I did and what can I say? It is an imperial stout! (and a good one at that) But why are people lining up for it?? This is a style that absolutely COUNTLESS breweries do just as good or even better all year, and you can even pick them up at ANY time without having to wait in a ridiculous line for 2 hours. I give it straight average marks just because of the crazy amount of hype that absolutely is not merited. Seems like a classic case of silly americans wanting what they can't have."

"O- A year (actually 16 months) of age has mellowed the beer quite a bit. The 2014 vintage is much, much more aggressive with regards to the barrel characteristics, almost as if the barrels were more 'wet'.  Although this is clearly a 5.0 beer regardless of vintage and one which has aged well, I will prefer my BCBS fresh...giving my nod to the 2014 vintage for its more 'extreme' aroma/flavor profile. (5.0)"
"A truly great stout, as rich in flavor as it is in color! If you have the opportunity to get a bottle of this rare gem (especially in CA) do not think twice buy it immediately."
""
"Overall: the original and most influential barrel aged stout. wonderful look and mouthfeel along with great flavor and smell. while it led the way for these kinds of beers its still not quite my favorite of the bunch. Definitely one I look to grab a four pack so every year but no black friday shopping for me"
""

"O- Didn't like this one as much as I wanted to, but can't deny that this is a top beer."
"I picked up some BCBS in 2012 and at the time was not really into BB Stouts so I didn't review it then.  I also aged a couple of bottles a year later but again held up on a review because I felt I didn't appreciate the style enough to do the beer justice.  Well, now it's the end of 2014 and I recently had BCBS on tap, and I'm here to say with the rest of the BA's that this beer is outstanding!  The depth and subtleties of the bourbon flavor make it a complete stand out.  I only wish I had saved the 2012 coffee bomber I had because now I could have enjoyed it properly!"

"Pours dark and cloudy, with a light tan colored head that dissipates quickly leaving traces on the sides.  Notes of chocolate, caramel, whiskey, wood, plum, cherry, roasted malt.  Sweet, with some sourness and tannins coming out from the time in the wood.  A big beer, that stays on the palate a long time.  This can defeat just about anything it accompanies.  A great beer.  With more time in the bottle it will get even better."

Usually takes a while for it to mellow out to this level of balance.  Incredible as always."

I hope I can find more beers in this category (a newer one for me) that can compare to this one.  I feel this beer will be hard to match in flavor and quality. You can taste the quality of ingredients and craftsmanship. Can’t wait to age some bottles, it will be hard to improve upon what is already in the bottle."

"2014 vintage. Midnight black with a dark tan head. Only thing I've seen darker would be Ten Fidy. Smell is strong, rich bourbon. Some sweet chocolate is faint in the nose. Taste is bourbon up front with some strong heat from the alcohol. Not as much alcohol bite as I expected but a very present alcohol warmth. Finishes with strong chocolate bourbon notes. I'm currently burping what feels like a glass of bourbon neat. Mouthfeel is unbelievable. Like velvet chocolate and rich toffee. Silky smoothness rounds off the strong first taste. Definitely changes as it warms/my taste buds become accustomed. More pronounced chocolate and roasted malts coming through without the boozy bourbon. This is such a complex beer and so perfectly brewed to be ready and enjoyable at just a month or so old while also standing up to time with the best. Can't say outright that it's the BEST BA stout I've had, but short of a 2010 Abyss last week and maybe the Barleywine variant with a year on it (I prefer it over the coffee) this is as good as it gets."
"Tried the 2012 and the 2014.  Both are all they are hyped up to be.  The 2012 aged beautifully, and I plan to cellar my final one for 2016.  Stumbled across a 4-pack of the 2014, and I enjoyed it- great taste of maple in the aftertaste.  What a treat."

"O: Damn, I was going to be hard on this one but I see what the hype is all about now. This beer is everything you want out of a high percentage stout. Huge viscous aromatics that almost seem to stick to your nostrils coupled with the deep char, bourbon, and vanilla overtones on the palate. The mid-palate is mindboggling, concentrated flavors and full bodied texture. Not very many high octane stouts keep you going back for more, this one does."

"Tried the 2014 BCBS. Damn near the perfect beer for me. Pours a pitch black with a brown head that trails the glass. The smell is full of flavor from dark plums, a bit of wood and bourbon, light vanilla and coffee. Very good set up to the taste. The taste itself was very layered and complex. Wood and bourbon with a bit of alcohol, light sweet fruits like dates and plums, coffee and dark chocolate. It has it all and nothing seems to overpower anything else too much. This is a wonderful beer and I can see that most of the fawning over getting a bottle is very much justified."

"2014 in a snifter.  Black as ink with no head.  Mostly bourbon to the nose and taste.  Viscous, coated my whole mouth.  I am not a fan of bourbon so this was a stretch for me -trying one without aging.  I am going to let the rest sit in the dark cool room in my basement for years to come - looking forward to the bourbon mellowing and more of the other flavors coming to the front."

"A big beer is every since of the word, this one was absolutely huge & in your face from the second I opened the bottle. I was worried going into this one that the hype might have ruined it for me or oversold it some but not at all, this one was almost perfect & up there with the very best of all the beers I've tried. The flavours & smell were wonderfully complex but fell short of being overpowering, the taste in particular being a real treat. Amazing stuff, I'll definitely be picking up another couple bottle of this when I next see it in the UK; just incredible."

"Absolutely tremendous.  Not sure if a  beer can get any more enjoyable.  Had a 6oz pour in December of '13 a couple weeks after the initial release.  I said then and I say now that BCBS is the best beer I have ever encountered.  Pitch black color, creamy, velvet mouthfeel and tremendous chocolate, roast and bourbon flavor.  A true sipper, amazing amount of flavor in each sip.  Booze is not overpowering but is felt in your mind almost immediately.  Lucky enough to attend a Goose Island tap take over at a local bar (Nov '14) and thoroughly savored 2.5 more delicious 12oz pours.  Looking forward to the release of the '14 edition.  Very lucky I live in Chicago. Salute."

"2013 version, One year old - Pours a very dark brown, hints of red, to black color with a thin tan head.  Not much carbonation, with little lacing.  The odor of bourbon, oak, vanilla, woods, bitter chocolate, dried fruits, fig, coffee.  The taste is very rich, fig, bourbon, grapes, oak, not bitter, barely any alcohol in the taste."

"2012 bottle held 2 years and poured on 11/15/14. Poured into a thick stemmed stout glass. Pours black as night. Almost no head. Dark gold rim of foam settles on top at the end of the pour. Heavy bourbon aroma upon the pour and as it settles in the glass. Initial sip is like a punch to the face. Whiskey and maltiness followed by a minor burn of alcohol. I enjoyed it more and more with each sip. The mouthfeel is extremely heavy. Coats the mouth and tounge. Beautiful stout. I don't know if it's worth sitting outside all night to wait for. However, it's probably the best stout I've ever tasted. If you're a stout enthusiast then you need to find this beer."

"2012 vintage. Pours a deep dark thick black brown with a small brown head. Aroma is a rich dark roasted chocolate malt, dark dried fruit of raisins plums, has strong sweet bourbon barrel alcohol essence with some wood barrel undertones. Taste is a sweet rich dark bourbon alcohol flavor with a bit woodsy notes, some chocolate and dark fruit raisin, plums, some vanilla notes, roasted malt and bitterness on the end. Palate is a full rich creamy viscous body, leaves a bit of an oily resin mouth feel, but smooth going down. Seems a bit heavy on the bourbon though, a bit overpowering on the alcohol. Leaves a long lingering flavorful sweet bourbon alcohol flavor and a bit of woodsy vanilla notes on the end. This is definitely one to sip and share on a cold winter eve."

"2012 edition poured into a stout glass, HDTV black ratings should be measured against this beer, blacker than outer space.  not much head or lacing but no points docked, it's two years old after all and that shit is overrated sometimes anyway.  the aromas are up front and complex, coffee, vanilla, cocoa and a whiff of the bourbon.  the flavors are amazing, you get more of the vanilla, toasty malts and smooth bourbon, with a nice almost-caramel aftertaste.  it is amazingly smooth and almost no alcohol burn for barrel aged and 15% abv, but you still want to sip and savor.  for this style it's gotta be KBS and BCBS as the #1 and 2, neck and neck at the top of the barrel aged imp stout mountain."

"Excellent Imperial Stout.  Roasty and black with carmel finishes.  The dark color doesn't match the smoother sweeter finish."
"Blackest beer I have ever seen. Aroma of toasty caramelized sugar, bourbon, camp fire. Really interesting. The smell is familiar, but I can’t put my finger on it. Maybe some raisin smell too. Very complex aroma. French toast maybe? Sweat, yummy taste. Wow is this good. Picking up on caramel, raisin, definitely bourbon. At 15%, I thought I’d taste more alcohol but I don’t. Even with taste I’m getting this familiar toastyness, but can’t figure it out. Maybe French toast again. This is very good. Would recommend even though it is pricy."

"This brew is unique forsure. Black as night, like a matte black color, no head. Smells sweet, figs, malty, breadth, bourbon barrel sweetness, it's great. Taste is exactly how it smells, dark fruits, fig, coffee, roasted coffee, sugar cane, bourbon barrel wood taste, tad smokey. My mouthfeel comparison may seem weird, but here goes. The feel on my tongue is the same as when I change motor oil. This thing is oil thick! No carbonation, just smooth, oily, goodness. All in all, the only down side is the abv per 6oz. Clocking in at 14% this is not something you should drive to get at a bar. I wish they made this more available through notable contracts such as Stone and give a case to the higher selling contracts. It would be safer to drink this in a place you don't have to drive after is all I'm getting at. Worth trying. Get it if you can."

"The chocolate and modest bitterness really take the lead in the taste with the bourbon warming my entire inside. This beer gets a lot of 5 out of 5's and the only reason I didn't rate it that way is because the boozy nose is just a hit too much for me.But one cannot argue that this is one the best beers on the market that is reasonably accessible to many craft beer lovers like myself."

"Poured into a tulip glass (Jim said it was a specific type of tulip that I don't recall) very dark with a heavenly aroma. Tasted better than it smelled if that could be possible. Jim claimed he could taste a hint of wet cardboard from the 2008 bottle. His palate is better than mine as I tasted no such imperfection. Overall one of if not the best beers I have had the pleasure to sample."
""
"Having this blind 2012 and 2013, I preferred the 2012. Very close beers though. The beer calms down a bit with the bite of BCBS alcohol and heat. The smooth chocolate notes come out more. I'd imagine this beer after 2 years would be even more phenomenal."

"Overall - If you enjoy bourbon and stouts, then this is an absolute must. In my opinion, this is the bar by which this style should be rated. If you come across this beer, go ahead and try one fresh - but do yourself a favor - cellar the rest of them, at least a few 4-paks. As with most imperial stouts, age is a wonderful thing, and will allow all of the flavors to mellow and mature. The only possible ""knock"" I could possibly give is for appearance, but you're not going to get a big frothy head and great retention on a 15% ABV beer. With that said, I will not penalize it for something it can't be, and I'm giving it all 5's. I may be a bit biased as I enjoy a good bourbon, and I love impy stouts... and this is nirvana."

"What can I say? It's just a friggin delicious beer, enjoyable every time. Age smooths out the alcohol, makes the mouthfeel more slick by getting rid of some carbonation, and brings it much closer to actual brownie batter in a glass. Worth drinking now, and worth cellaring (two to three years seems to be the sweet spot). Is it worth the hype? Why not? Every time I open one it pretty much makes my night."
"Overall, a very enjoyable, highly drinkable stout, with a high ABV that is well hidden. I am glad I have hoarded several bottles of this high quality stout for future consumption."

"Doesn't get much better than this stout-wise. I picked up a lot of chocolate and coffee notes--and bourbon and vanilla tie it all together. This is my last bottle from 2013 and I can't wait to pick up some more when it comes out again. Great stuff."

"Overall: I had my first BCBS about 7 months ago. I knew nothing about it. Nothing about the hype. I was new to the craft beer world. I've heard of Goose Island, but when I was out an saw it on the menu with 15% ABV next to it's name, I thought, wow, I should try that. I was amazed. I then looked into it and quickly realized it's one of the most sought after beers. I thankfully eventually stumbled across some moths later at $15 per bottle. I reluctantly bought 4, knowing I was being ripped off, but didn't care. This one I'm reviewing is my second of the four, leaving two left to age."

"Many barrel-aged beers tend to lack integration in my opinion, in that the base beer seems at odds with the barrel character. Bourbon County is one of the finest beers of its kind because it doesn't suffer from this problem. I have had many bourbon barrel-aged stouts, and this is the absolute best when price and availability are factored into the equation."

"**Also sampled a bottle of 2007 in Wrigleyville. My lovely wife purchased it for my birthday. Poured into two small snifter glasses. Virtually no head, so looked like a glass full of oil. Bourbon was still quite pronounced, but the overall flavor had mellowed with time. I think 6 years in the bottle may have been a bit long for my preference."

"O - My first review of BCBS, but definitely not my first. Dissecting this old favorite was definitely a fun exercise, and it's clear to see why BCBS consistently garners rave reviews. A solid staple stout that masters the art of barrel aging."

"A massive thanks to Mulder1010 not possible otherwise and pours a dark black hue with a chocolate laced two finger head and similar lacing everywhere stunning,on nose it's full of bourbon but yet the big chocolatey stout is still here basically the aromas are both heavily present yet each just bounces off each other and you just know the beer your about to taste is gonna be a cracker and on taste yep I love it just the same as smell the tastes of bourbon barrel ageing and rich chocolatey stout combine in a beautiful harmony with the high ABV forgotten about and overall what a stunner of a beer and def a genuine sipper not because of the bigness of it it's because you want to savour every drop and keep that taste on your palette just don't start the nights tasting on this as everything else will dissapoint cheers."

"Overall this is my favorite vintage of BCBS, Sure it could have had a little bigger head but given how old it is I am giving it a break as everything else in the stout has aged so well I can't possibly discount anything here. FWIW the only 2008s I have got straight from a store that cellared them so these were cellared very well. I RARELY give any attribute of a beer a 5 so that tells you how much I love this stout but as most can attest it is hard to beat a 2008 BCBS."

"I've had many fresh and nearly fresh vintages as well as on over-the-hill 05 - but never at it's peak. This is something truly special. Incredibly well melded together and balanced - more mellow, less aggressive, but still strongly boozy, almost more-so than fresh."
""
"Now, this is fairly young bottle, and the label encourages aging (""up to 5 years""). I could totally see the barrel flavors mellowing out and revealing something a bit more delicate. In the mean time this is candy; maybe I'll save it for next Halloween."

"Had this beer at the Cannery Row Brewing Company in Monterey,CA this week. Served to me in a tulip glass this beer had a bunch of foam probably poured too quickly from the tap. Still was an excellent drink. Tastes of wood, earth, coffee, dark chocolate fill the mouth. Taste is full but I didnt feel that the beer was a thick viscosity.Be ready for the alcohol content which is very apparent on the finish. I sipped on this for about 45 min and even though it went from cold to about room temp in that time it was enjoyable to the last drop. Enjoyed with a cup of clam chowder that paired well IMO."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I had this fresh, six months ago and this time and it is drinking very well now. Flavors/aromas I get out of it: vanilla, oak, bourbon, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, coffee, espresso, roast malt, barley in general and a little alcohol. Yeah, it's good!"
""
""

"O- This beer really lives up to the hype, though ironicially I would say I prefer the bc barleywine though I am usually a stout over barleywine guy."

"This coveted ale pours a soul sucking black with a short lived tan head and little lacing but lots of legs. The nose is. ....bourbon. lol. Coffee, chocolate, licorice, vanilla all make appearances as well. The mouth is smooth but coating. If KBS had the body of this stout, it'd be perfect. The flavor is a smooth blend of all the notes from the nose. Perfectly blended and crafted. Its almost hard to believe that this is such a high abv stout. This is sooo good. Can't wait to cellar a few and see what is to come."

It stands shoulder to shoulder with dragons milk as a tie for my #1 favorite stout"

"Got a grand opportunity to try BCBS on tap at Whip In weeks ago. As of today, I still tasted it like the last time I enjoyed 8oz of it.

"Shoulder to shoulder we stood and this was the first beer I ordered. There something to be said about drinking a beer before you've eaten, well, this devious dark shadow got me good!! It was served a bit too cold, as most incredible craft beers are, but I couldn't resist the first sip anyway. WOW. This stuff is awesome! I steadily warmed the snifter in my hands to wake up some of the cold coma induced flavors that hid bundled within, shivering from the ""typical darn right chilly"" environment from which they were stashed. Patience is difficult for one with un-medicated ADHD, but knowing this stuff had so much more to offer, I persevered with the warming and enjoyed every last sip of this magical elixir. Thank you Bourbon County. Thank you."

"The perfect bourbon barrel aged stout, if there is one. Blows everything else away with its originality, richness, depth and sophistication. A must have for any beer appreciator. Aggressive, full, and boozy, it hits everything a bourbon barrel stout should be, and hits all marks with perfection, or as close to perfect as any beer can be. It's also readily accessible (on Black Friday). Buy as much as you can when you see it."

I haven’t given a perfect 5.0 rating to anything because I figure I haven’t found it yet and don’t know what’s around the corner, but this is as close to perfection that I have found so far. Using this as the base for the variants just sets the tone for each beer to come from their catalog. Do yourself a favor; if you like stouts… seek this beer out. You won’t be disappointed."

""
"This is best served in a snifter glass slightly below room temperature. This is a sipping beer to enjoy every element! Cheers!!!"
""
""
"So far the second best stout I have had with the other being the coffee version of this. This beer has a great aroma and big coffee taste. It is excellent with desert or after a meal. This is a strong beer when it comes to alcohol but you can not really taste it."
""
"What a rare find, Pour House - Exton, PA had it on tap. Enjoyed every bit of the experience. I didn't get to see the pour so my appearance rating isn't a 5.0 but there was a decent lace. Served in a Brandy Snifter which only helped in the presentation & smell. Didn't dare pair it with food as it was a meal in of itself."
""
""
""
"Still, hard to believe this beer is 15%. Even my girlfriend said that it tastes like boozy caramel. I have had beers similar in taste to this one that are 1/2 the price and and about 1/3rd the ABV. So I'm not sure what draws drinkers to stand in line for hours to get this beer. Maybe it gets better with age. Maybe it gets better at room temp. At least I know it won't get better with a frosted mug."
"This beers pours black with a short dark mocha head that dissipates quickly leaving no lacing. The nose is mouthwatering and is dominated both by rich malt and boozy bourbon. The taste follows suite with lots of rich dried fruit (plums/raisins), very jammy and big bourbon qualities, lots of vanilla. Very round and smooth on the palate, and is a big syrupy. Say what you want about InBev (and I will be there with you slamming them), but this is a delicious beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours black, with a small mocha head that develops on a rather agressive pour. Leaves a nice light tan film on the top and tan ring around the glass. Smells like bourbon, wood, chocolate, toasty malts, dark fruit. Smells great. The taste is a bourbon bomb. All bourbon upfront and a nice heated bourbon on the backend. Also notes of dark chocolate and the barrell. Nice slick mouthfeel, medium, a somewhat easy drinker at such a high abv. The bourbon hangs around for a while on the aftertaste. A little bit of sweetness, too. Warms you right up. Very good bourbon aged stout. Could not be happier that I was able to get a case. Had a year old one on draft and it had even more flavor and was smoother. Less heat and more stout flavors and the bourbon was a bit subdued. Fresh, or aged, it's great."

"Finally got my hands on a 4 Pack of this stuff. In my opinion a little pricey, but very good. Definitely one of the best stouts Ive ever had. Not as thick as a lot of other stouts, definitely a thinner mouthfeel. Smokey, nutty, chocolaty taste. Not gonna lie, I saved one bottle thinking I wouldn't get another chance to get more of this, and I picked up another 4 pack today. I know people have a thing about Goose Island and everything but, this is a phenomenal beer!!"

"Incredible beer. Pretty much everything that needs to be said, has been said below. It has a wonderful note of bourbon that is not at all contrived. The smoothness of the beer actually carries the bourbon aromatically and really limits that ""bourbon bite"". Its taste certainly isnt brief but doesnt not stain the mouth with a lingering taste. It's high ABV is indicative of the subtle sweetness behind the chocolate and caramel. If you can find this beer, go for it. Its one of the best bourbon stouts."

"A jet black brown appearance with a flimsy circle of tan bubbles on top and a decent trace of striated lacing in retreat. The aroma is an intense raisin-prune and light licorice malt composite with a touch of the bourbon you expect. Luscious. The flavor jumps all over these same ideas with deep dark fruits and licorice malt and the tasteful blanket of bourbon throughout. This masterpiece is full bodied with fair carbonation for the style and presents a thick, stick to your ribs feel going down. Pretty impressive although I always prefer these beers minus the bourbon/whiskey flavors myself. Not my favorite mix but I expect I'm in the minority. Well done GI!"

"Finally grabbed a bottle of this and it absolutely did not disappoint. The beer pours black as night with a two finger caramel colored head that quickly recedes and leaves no lacing. The smell is of bourbon, vanilla, and roasted malts. The taste almost mirrors that but with the addition of some dark fruit flavors. There is very little carbonation but it is the perfect amount for the style. Overall this was an amazing beer and I can't wait to grab another bottle."
""
"Full bodied, rich, smooth, lightly effervescent. Somewhat cloying and sticky. After 30 minutes or so this brew really reaches its potential, just like any beer of this style benefits from some warmth. And it really goes well with a good piece of fruitcake."
""
"O- A pretty enjoyable BA stout. Not nearly as good as the BCBCS, which overshadows this beer, IMO. Still, I'll have no issue drinking the few I have left in the cellar. Would prefer to share the, though. The sweetness is the weak point of this beer, if you ask me."
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall I loved this beer and I thought that it is a very good example of the style and I think it lives up to it's reputation, everything I want in a strong barrel aged stout was there and the combination of the aromas, taste, and mouthfeel just made it feel luxurious. This beer had nice drinkability, yeah it's on the sweet side and yeah it's boozy, but to me both aspects never get too out of hand, it was fairly smooth, warming, rich, fairly filling, and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, I would be perfectly fine sipping on a bottle of it and I think one is pretty much the perfect amount for me, I think it makes a great winter time beer, especially on a cold and snowy day in mid Michigan like today. What I liked most about this beer was the taste and aroma, they were both awesome and very memorable, that toasted coconut aspect set it apart. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there wasn't anything that I would change, but do wish I could actually buy this locally, but my part of Michigan always gets way less then it should and I don't think I've heard of any shop within a 50 mile radius that has got any. I would for sure buy this beer if I ever saw it, I would get as much as I could and I would recommend it to anyone who likes barrel aged Stouts, it's about as good as it gets. All in all I was very impressed with this beer, I really like Barrel aged Stouts and to me this one embodies the spirit of what a great sipping beer should be. KBS and Blacknote were my favorite barrel aged Stouts, but after trying this beer it's pretty clear that this is now my #1. Awesome job guys, keep up the world class work."

"I wanted to find a reason NOT to rate this beer a 5 in every category, but I would have been lying to myself. Are there better stouts out there? I don't know, maybe. But this is the best I've had and I'll be thinking about it until the day I can get my hands on it again."
""
"O: Im not really into Bourbon aged beer but this one is just amazing. Saw a liquor store that still has a few cases left, might have to stock up a bit."
"But really, I can't help but judge every other BBA beer by this one and I've never had better. Vanilla, cocoa, molasses, and coconut with lots of boozy sweet deliciousness to smooth everything out. Vintage 2013 is drinking great right now."
""
""
""

"Smell is Black as night but only a tiny brown head with little retention. Smell is definitely mostly chocolate, maybe some dark malts, and a little booze. Taste is quite bit more boozy, with lots of chocolate. Realy not tasting much else. Mouthfeel is really thick is one might thing. Overall since it hasn't bee aged we have a little booze and lots of chocolate, Really not anything to crazy except what one would expect. Really great beer but with some time on it the beer would be BETTE!!!!"

"There's nothing like it to compare it to, there's nothing like it to say, ""Well, if they did ___ instead it would've been better..."" This beer is PERFECT in what it is, to say otherwise is insanity to me. I think some reviews lose site of rating within what the beers are, they get compared to beers outside their categories. I'm not here comparing this beer to other beers I've had and saying, ""Well if Bourbon County had've done ___ it would've been more to my liking."" There's simply no comparison for this beer to say it should be any different, there's nothing better you can point to and honestly say that someone else did this beer better. This is THE pinnacle, this is what any other beers that come after it strive to be. It's in a league of its own, it's its own competition, there's nothing else but Bourbon County in this field that stands alone atop this mountain of deliciousness."

"Also, on barrel aged beers, I personally feel many don't get it right. This is the second BA beer I've had that I think does. Must be an art form or something, either that or I'm more discriminating of my BA brews."

"Had a hard time finishing so drank it along side my Dales Pale Ale for a while, and enjoyed it more with the contrast, and then, finally made a black and tan of them which was delicious and more balanced and interesting to me."

"Ink black body and hardly any head at all. Smell is more bourbon barrel than anything. Lot of vanilla, chocolate, and a weird buttery aroma. The butter is so strong. Kind of soured/rancid. Pros for flavor: roasty malts, chocolate, caramel. Cons: overwhelming barrel, vanilla, butter, soy sauce, sweetness, booze. Mouthfeel is slick and kind of flat. Booze numbs the tongue. I really don't like this at all. It's grossing me out. A fine example of a messy, bourbon barrel-forwarded stout."
""
"I generally am not as big a fan of spirit-barrel-aged beers as some on this site, as I don't like whiskey or other spirits, but I couldn't pass up a chance to try such a hyped beer, and overall I think they did a good job with this one creating a barrel-aged beer where the barrel predominates without obliterating all the other flavors, like some other barrel-aged beers are."

"2012 vs 2013 vertical tasting: 2012 highlighted chocolate and a more overall sweetness. Very pleasant. 2013 tasted different, but still very similar. The difference was less chocolate, but more red wine. It actually tasted more like a cab sauv than the previous year. What's up with that? I honestly couldn't pick which tasted better. It's like having to choose between Sexy bitch #1 and Hot bitch #2."
""

"Dark as night. Smells of vanilla, bourbon warmth, a little coffee. Taste is the same; very intense and rich. The mouthfeel is incredible; intensely creamy and thick. The alcohol is quite warm but much more than welcome. I nursed one 12oz bottle for about an hour, but I wasn't such a good judge of how the flavors/aroma changed as it warmed because I was quite buzzed by the bottom of my glass. :)"

"O - before getting BCBS home and in my glass I had numerous people tell me I'd like it loads better than a few other massive American imperial/double stouts I've had before. Mind you, that would take loads of class given the experience those stouts presented myself. But never once did I have in mind of comparing BCBS with anything I've had before. I don't think beer should be compared rather than all of it appreciated. But after having a fresh BCBS I can say with complete honesty that its simply one of the best stouts ever brewed. Is it the best? I've had so many its hard to say. What I can say is that BCBS deserves its respect as a true pioneer and great example of what brewing is today in the great country we live in. I just can't give Goose Island enough respect for such an outstanding BBA stout. I suppose I should give InBev a bit of applause as well given there is a whole lot of us who wouldn't have had BCBS in stores without the expansion. So while they didn't create this gem, they did ensure a whole lot of us got a pack in 2013. And I say keep it coming!"
"O- Amazing. Almost unbearably strong, but so complex. It really lives up to the hype."

"Overall- I'm not one to follow hype, but this beer absolutely delivers/destroys the hype. The best beer I've ever had, hands down. Perfect 5/5. Nothing wrong at all. Would like to see how it ages though."
"The mouthfeel is very full bodied, with just the right amount of carbonation. The carbonation plays perfectly on the tongue with the thick, nearly syrupy feel. There is lots of stickiness leftover, that sticks around and accompanies the touch of alcohol burn at the end. Overall, this is a wonderful brew, full of deep, complex flavors that I could go back to time and time again."

"Overall: Look, it’s ridiculous how hyped this beer is but it’s actually really good. Do yourself a favor, go to your local bar and drink it on tap when it’s there (better on tap than in the bottle, more marshmallow notes) and buy a bottle for later. There’s plenty of bourbon barrel notes with enough stout to back it up. The nose itself is enough to singe your eyebrows and make you perk up."

"Many barrel-aged beers tend to lack integration in my opinion, in that the base beer seems at odds with the barrel character. Bourbon County is one of the finest beers of its kind because it doesn't suffer from this problem. I have had many bourbon barrel-aged stouts, and this is the absolute best when price and availability are factored into the equation. A true masterpiece."

"One of the best smelling beers ever! I smell fudge, chocolate cake, leather, bourbon, vanilla, and a little bit of coffee. Taste goes along with the smell except i get some heat from the alcohol which isnt a bad thing. Bourbon hits me right away and fades to a nice taste of vanilla and coffee. Balanced well for being almost 15% This beer is perfection. Its my first one ever and I cant wait to dig into the rest of them. Cheers!"

"O: What a treat! This is a man's drink if ever there was one. A strong but well-mannered and gentlemanly brew. It's a muscular beer for sure, but it has that innate sort of 'flow' and smoothness that makes it very easy to drink. A year's time has taken the edge off of the alcohol, but the bourbon character is still very expressive."

"O- Acquired in a trade for Maine Beer's Mo. Not much more can be said that already hasn't for the legendary BCBS. Wish I could pick up the variants, but for now, this will certainly do. An intense stout that makes most others seem quite meaningless."
""
""

"O: This beer is actually perfect to my taste. I did not think that was possible. 15% abv? No way. This beer is a paragon, not only of stouts, or barrel aged stouts, but of beer. 100."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I have never have a beer with a similar flavor profile to this. So much decadent sweetness in this stout. It tastes like a big stack of smores mixed with some rich fudgy brownies. You still get quite a bit of alcohol taste on the finish but it is not overpowering like in the aroma. Moderate bitterness and the higher alcohol presence helps cut the sweetness to a nice level where is able to be the star of the show and flourish but never be cloying. I can't believe this is 14.9% ABV, I was expecting this to be a lot boozier than it was."
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"

"Probably my favorite beer ever. Absolutely delicious. I was lucky enough to pick up 2 4 packs of this and I look forward to aging it to see how it compares to next years. Delicious chocolate fudge notes with a strong bourbon finish. The smoothes stout I've ever had."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - There are two drinks that I enjoy, bourbon and beer. So this beer, despite arguably being over bourboned, was still quite good to me. I think that there are better examples of a bourbon stout right here in Chicago at Revolution Brewery, but they are better because of the lower ABV which allows you to pick up the other flavors a bit more, and experience the best of what this style has to offer."

""

"Everything comes across top-notch with this heavy-hitting stout with the relatively minor quibble about a thin head. But, I'm not into beer primarily for its looks, but its flavor, and this monster in incredible! It's a black mystery at first look and then the first (and subsequent) sips reveal all the underlying depth and complexity of robust dark malts, a well-balanced big booze presence that does not overwhelm things, the whole thing being deep and complex yet easily satisfying."
"BCBS pours like almost a syrup. Nice thick looking beer although very little head. The smell is unreal, delicious with a hint of alcohol, probably due to high alcohol content. Just as tasty as it smells but you can certainly notice the alcohol, but at 14% it gains bonus points overall. Great beer and actually not a bad value due to high alcohol content. Will definitely treat myself again in the future."
"One of the few heavier stouts that I could constantly keep on chuggin if it weren't for a little sickness/alcohol poisining. Never got my hands on it before and lo and behold it's on tap one time only at local pub so had to have it. Poured a black body with decent sized head that died slow with minimal lace patches. Smell is a cross between old indian cherry bourbon (actually whiskey) and vanilla, oak, roasted malts, chocolate. For such a boozy and heavy beer I find that this beer has an incredible smoothness and is so easy to drink. I get bourbon, booze, woodiness, chocolate, some roasted graininess, vanilla, even some dark fruits like black cherry or figs (minimal, mind you). I didn't really get any ABV burn but it didn't take me too long to sip on this (never really warmed). A definite must try."

"Okay, must say before trying this one I was sure it was all a bunch of hype, I mean come on Goose Island is a decent brewery, but no Founders! I have been won over, Bourbon County Stout lives up to the hype and more, simply put...amazing! Pricey? Yes, but one of the few pricey beers that is totally worth it! Next time you have a few extra bucks burning a hole in your pocket, take the plunge if you can get your hands on this bad boy. You won't regret it!"

"Amazing stuff. Deep, dark, brooding pour into a chilled mug. Virtually no head, with only slight foam and lots of tiny bubbles. The smell was a clean, crisp breath of chocolate, toffee, caramel, and vanilla coffee. The nose and initial taste was a heavenly blend of chocolate coffee malt with hints of bourbon and a lingering finish on the palate. I actually enjoyed this more than the coffee varietal, and found it much easier to drink. Overall, a fantastic experience which I hope to relive over and over again!"

"It tastes like soy sauce. I'm not complaining, My favorite two beers are Rogue Imperial Stout and Hercules Double IPA. I'm just saying, it tastes like soy sauce. Good mouthfeel. I gave some to my 21 year old daughter and she said, ""It tastes like soy sauce."" It's good rich barley. Lots of alcohol. But I'm just saying. It tastes like soy sauce. :) There was no head. I poured it into a snifter. Decent dark smell. It reminds me of Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout, which I like. I'm glad I had it, but I won't buy it again due to the price and the lack of head and lack of lacing. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours black with a small brownish head. Head goes away very quickly. Leaves little as far as lacing. The smell is all bourbon with a slight hint of chocolate and malts. The taste is very smooth with great bourbon flavor followed by that very slight chocolate kick. Mouthfeel was on the thicker side. The bourbon def stays for a bit. Overall this is a great beer. Great beer to just sit back and relax with."
""
""
"Overall: Back story; back in 2008 I had a 22 0z Bourbon County Stout in my hand at a store that I put back on the shelf because I thought $14 was kind of a high price to pay. Shit, craft beer has definitely changed from those days and I longed to have access in So Cal to Bourbon County once again. This was the year and the beer did not disappoint. Today's price is almost that for a 12 ozer but damn this is a good beer. Here's to hoping the pipeline to So Cal opens up even more so I can have continued access to this gem."

"Lot of hype surrounding this beer. Took a little to obtain this. Got a chance to try it a week after I bought it. It was everything it was cracked up to be. Poured black as night into a tulip glass. Overwhelmingly power smell of alcohol specifically bourbon eminating from the glass. Slight brown head. Small amount of carbonation at the top stops fairly short after the pour. Not many bubbles lasting the entire two hour journey. Very powerful on the tastebuds. Robust malt flavor, with hints of chocolate. It's almost like drinking a hard alcohol beverage. Leaves legs on the glass as if it were a Cabernet from Napa Valley. I recommend to all and would say yes, it's worth the $9 a bottle, but next year if it crept up to $10 a bottle I'd opt for something else."
""
""
""

"Overall- Definitely my favourite stout, and may be one of my favourite beers to date. Definitely a sipper though, as it is a heavy beer."

"Taste bourbon without the burn and a chocolatey malt backrdrop"

"O: This is the real deal Holyfield, borderline one of the best beers ever. I hand this beer out to my friends trying to get them to experience perfection. I can't wait to age this and enjoy for years to come."
"O - Seriously, this is THE best beer I have ever tasted. If there was a way to score it a ""10", I would do so. How they manage to get that much bourbon, wood, and ""heat"" into a beer and STILL have it balanced with sweetness is pure wizardry. I feel my taste buds may have been ruined...I cant even imagine drinking another beer in the same evening. It's THAT good."
""
""

"Overall- lived up beyond the hype, I waited 2 hours in the cold to get it and I would gladly do it again for this gem...in-bev owned or not this is delicious beer. Not really a beer, just the liquid of the gods."

"Beer snobs will say this is the greatest beer ever, but honestly, all I taste is licorice. That is it. That is all there is. It is just really alcoholic licorice. There are no hints of chocolate or vanilla, and the bourbon is virtually non-existent. It really just tastes like licorice. I don't understand how people taste otherwise."

The bourbon barrel doesn't dominate, although it does provide a solid bourbon flavor that works with the stout's malt in a way that enhances each. There's so much there to explore, so definitely take your time with this one."

"Oh my, kick me in the pants. This is listed as a bourbon stout. We'll!!! It pours as black as oil, with a Carmel head. Breath in deeeppp. Ahhh!!!! Finally a real smell of bourbon overtakes you, unlike many labeled as the same. Sip and you taste the smooth chocolate stout with a powerful bourbon flavor. After the second sip you know you are drinking something special. You know this is a strong one, but you need so much more. If you love stout and bourbon this is mid blowing. This is a must have.!!! Oh my It's empty, I need more."
"Beautifully full creamy mouthfeel that coats the mouth with a vanilla bourbon and has a chewy maltiness. Tastes of bourbon, vanilla, raisin, and some faint dry oak flavor that is masked by the creamy mouth coating. This is a big beer that does not disappoint. Definitely a sipper - a delicious sipper."

"The beer pours a midnight black, like motor oil. The beer appears thick and viscous, and forms a very small head of dark, oak-colored bubbles that quickly fizzle away to just a scrim. In body, the beer is opaque and impenetrable to the eye, though presumably free of particles. When swirled against the sides of the glass, the beer leaves a lovely set of legs. On the nose, this beer is boozy with dark chocolate, a touch of dark roast coffee, oak, vanilla, and chocolate covered raisins running across the nostrils. Soft toasted coconut and a touch of pralines and toffee also make it into the rich nose of this beer, but at its base, this beer is all about the boozy bourbon character which comes through beautifully. I’m getting the sense of a boozy, chocolate covered pretzel for some reason… On the tongue, the beer tastes boozy hot, and sweet with a drying boozy finish. The heat begins a little too hot but is smoothed out by the chocolate sweetness, while mild tannins dance at the finish alongside a roast bitterness, and just a hint of hop bitters as well before the booze makes one last hurrah. In flavor, the beer begins briefly as hot fusel alcohol, morphing into rich and boozy bourbon it develops flavors of vanilla and oak and then the stout comes through giving dark chocolate, raisins, molasses, and then chocolate milk flavors. The finish is hot with alcohol while mild tannic wood presses through alongside slight charred smoke, the finish eventually unfolds further stout characteristics, but only after the heat has moved down the gullet. A touch of char comes through in the aftertaste. In the mouth, the beer feels perfect for the style. It is richly full in body, like milk or even heavy cream, with a soft carbonation that is nearly nonexistent. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and silky with a thick chewiness that completes the beer. After the beer leaves, the mouth is left tingly with alcoholic burn, yet dry with only hints of salivation at the sides of the mouth. Overall, this is BCBS, a classic of the Bourbon Barrel Aged Stouts, and it is a great beer. I personally would sit on my bottle for a little while longer as the heat is a little too hot for me right now. The beer is rich in everything you want from a barrel aged stout, though, and is a damn fine beer. This is a whale worth hunting down."

"UPDATE (1/6/2014): You know what it is they say about hype... This totally lost during a bourbon barrel stout blind tasting, which bummed me out. Pretty syrupy and ranges on Dark Lord sweetness the more this warms up. At the same time, the flavor is pretty top notch, but perhaps this is best when aged. I'm going to see how the '13 vintage goes, and crack open some '12 vintages all in good time. Until then."
"I finally had this beer after hearing about it for a year. Even if you are not a Stout fan I would try this just for the experience. As you can see, it is higher in alcohol so splitting it with someone would be allowed (maybe even encouraged). There is nothing like a tasty, hardy, stronger stout on a cold winter night and this is the perfect beer for that. I also put one aside (had to hide them from my brother-in-law) and will crack it open next holiday season."

"2013 bottle from Proof Bottle Shop. I set the bottle out about an hour before I opened it. Poured into a large snifter. Deep opaque black with a thin chocolate colored head. Head lasted well under a minute. No lacing, but some sticky legs. Lots of vanilla, bourbon and molasses in the aroma. Not much else in the nose. Nice bourbon warmth throughout the taste without it being overpowering. Typically I don't like a ton of bourbon booziness in a stout, but this holds it up extremely well. Bourbon taste without the booziness. Nice vanilla sweetness in the front with some toffee and chocolate up there as well. Mid-palate is some of that molasses with the bourbon and earthy oak at the end. You certainly don't get any of the 14.9% abv in this bad boy. Mouthfeel is nicely viscous without being thick, very low carbonation. Great beer...but I am slightly underwhelmed by all the hype."

"2013 vintage. Poured from a bottle into a goblet, the beer is jet black, with hints of chestnut highlights around the edges when held up to light. Sparse, filmy surface coat of tan colored head. Looked oily and thick when poured. Aromas of vanilla, oak, booze, cocoa nibs, and mocha coffee. Very rich, very robust, and very inviting. Flavors are very roasted and bitter on the forward tongue, but with a subsequent vanilla and cream character that provides an amazing balance. Chocolate notes, bittersweet, present mid-tongue, with more of the woody and booze characteristics coming, as well. Building warmth as you drink, as a 14.9% ABV is wont to do. The body is velvety smooth, and supports all the rich and robust character perfectly. Rich, bitter roasted aftertaste, with coffee, vanilla, and booze all lending themselves to a linger. The finish is smooth, but boy does it finish slow, which is exactly how you want this beer to leave your palate. This is a heavy beast, and a sipper to be sought after. Great beer."

"This Stout is PURE MAGIC in a glass! As soon as you pop the top, the magical aroma starts to escape. It pours like oil and sticks to the glass. 1 sip and you're either hooked, or wouldn't try it ever again. Its expensive compared to most, very hard to find, extremely seasonal. If there is 1 Stout that someone that doesn't like Stouts should try, this is THE one!"
""
"O - Certainly a big tasting brew. Could use more aroma. I did dig the flavors and of course am curious what this would be like aged."
""
""
""
""
"This is a gem of an offering that lives up to the hype it receives on this and other beer sites."
""
""
""
""
"O - this is definitely one of my favorite beers every year and they did not disappoint again this year. As my brother-in-law would say, this beer is just not fair to other beers! This would be perfect in my mind if it wasn't for the low carbonation."
""
""
"O- This is my 1st time with BCBS. I like KBS a lot. I think this is just a touch better, and the mouthfeel is like the tiebreaker. An amazing accomplishment of brewing."

""

""

"Well, I think it reached the expectation I had in my mind, influenced a little by what I've read from other BAs. This is a big stout, with a big flavor profile centering around the bourbon characteristics. For me, this is one of those beers that one is enough for the night. Matches the hype in my opinion and is worth your effort to get some if you can. I can't wait to cellar some and try it again later."

"4-5 American brewers know how to make this style of beer and glad i bought 4 this evening to drink after a long day, this is world class ale and all others with exception of Thomas hardy 1987-1993 should take note that's my evaluation"
"Pours as dark as you'd expect with very little khaki head. Aroma is undoubtedly the most pungent combo of chocolate, bourbon, and roast I've ever smelled. Flavor is huge on bourbon and chocolate. Moderately low level of carb, as expected. Overall this will always remain one of my favorite beers. A harmonious blend of aroma and flavor that leaves me baffled how a near 15% beer has no alcohol taste. Smells amazing, tastes amazing, and clearly there has been a lot of love put into such a unique brew."
""
"Forget everything I said earlier. This is a great beer- believe the hype!"
"O: There's a reason people go completely ape-shit for this beer. Only Parabola beats it for me as a personal all-time beer. It is nearly, if not totally, perfect. It is art. Angels sing when someone drinks this."
""
""

""
""
""

""
""
"My one critique is as the beer warms the alcohol taste becomes more prevalent. However, I do understand why people mark their calender for the annual release of this beer. I don't know if I would wait in line for hours to get my hands on it but it is deserving of its legendary status."

"Overall: really happy we finally get this beer down in here in Jacksonville FL. I have missed its release the many times I have been up north this time of year. It is exactly what you expect and lives up to the expectations. Its scary how well the ABV is hidden and how drinkable this beer is."
""
"O: My first BCBS and it lived up to the hype. a huge flavorfult stout that would be great on its own but with the complexity of the bourbon barrel this thing is knocked out of the park. Can't wait to try a variant."

"O - What a wonderful beer. I truly think that BCBS is the definition of bourbon barrel aged stouts. Not too sweet, hot, or thick. Goose Island prints on its label that it can age over 5 years in the bottle. I don't doubt that, and I'm excited to see how my other 7 bottles will develop over time. If you're on edge about trying one, I suggest you buy/trade for one now. Cheers!"

"On the nose get exactly what the name says straight bourbon oaky notes with the smell of dark roasted malt. The stars of this beer for me are the taste and appearance. The beer is pitch black in appearance exactly what i expect to see in an stout only disappointment is there was no real head to speak of, but at 14.9% what do you really expect. Now on to the taste 1st on the tongue you get the taste of oak followed by notes of maple, dark chocolate and roasted coffee. At 14.9% you really don't taste the alcohol the only thing you really get is a slight warming in the back of the throat to give you some warning of the alcohol content of this beer. Overall really complex beer so complex I really dont think I can put it in words, you defiantly have to try this beer for your self, well worth the hype."

"Starting with appearance... this is the epitome of what a stout should look like. Pours absolute, sheer black, thick and like crude oil with a thin brown head. Zero light comes through even with a 600 Lumen flashlight on the other side of the glass. BLACK. At the very edges, it has a golden hue as opposed to the more common black with a reddish hue. Good lookin beer. Smell is well... bourbon... And lots of it. Bourbon, mild coffee, chocolate and coconut. Like a Mounds Bar... soaked in bourbon. The taste is simply incredible: robust but smooth bourbon comes first with the oak and vanilla you would expect. Bright notes of roasted coffee, molasses, vanilla and chocolate linger well after you finish your sip. The booze is very apparent, but not undesirable. This is a warmer; you feel it in your gut! Feel is heavy, thick but silky smooth. Almost zero carbonation. Coats your mouth and everything else on the way down leaving a boozey warmth wherever it touches. Fantastic beer overall; tons of good flavors, a perfect dessert or sipping beer, and it's affordable to boot. A must try."

"Overall- A great bourbon stout. The bourbon isn't as strong as some others that I have had but it is a great compliment to the stout. I will say this is a much better beer as it ages. The smell and flavor really develop with 1+ years on it."

"twelve full ounces. not 11. not 11.2. not 12.5. but good old-fashioned American 12. even the bottle feels heavy picking it up. perfect amount of bourbon aroma. no overpowering pseudo chocolate, or coffee to cover any potential imperfections.... viscous, but not overly thick. syrup-y, but not gaggingly so. super nice sweetness at the very end. and 14%. wow. knowing that AB or InBev (or whoever the heck they are) took over was a little disconcerting. I had heard so much about this stuff and figured they would change the ingredients, go cheap or just short-change everybody but I am very happily surprised. I place this one at the very top of my list, among the other excellent brews that are just a notch above the very good ones. the flavor hits me the most as it goes down my throat and leaves a thin coating of sweetness. this review lacks the adjectives and descriptions but that is only because it is all already covered by so many others today. my bottle says bottled on Aug 20 and is 14.2%. even the thick label gives it some personality. two down, two to go... and still in the hunt for more... I feel disappointed in myself for awarding such high scores to so many others in the past. this one is definitely there."

"Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout ---5/5."

""

"O - Everything you want in a BB Imp Stout. Great mix of chocolate, bourbon, and booze notes. Age will probably make this even better. Smoothing out some of the harsh alcohol notes."
"O I'm of the mindset that most beers are best fresh but I could see how this would age really well. A really well crafted beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- First time having this and went out on Black Friday to make sure I got some. Wish their was a little bit more head retention that I found in Black Note, kinda takes away from appearance for me. But that really is the only knock on it for me. Great balanced bourbon flavor and the stout coming through in the finish is pretty great as well. This is a lot of beer and probably one of the most concentrated in flavor beers I've had, it actually took me a while to drink the whole bottle. Splitting a bottle with a friend is actually a good idea, at least for me."

"Pours like 40 Weight, black as night, incredibly syrupy, and dense, lots of semi-sweet chocolate, BOURBON, rum, pecan praline, dried figs, dates, raisins, currant, and a touch of prune, extremely sweet, but never cloying, and dried out a bit by a welcome touch of coffee bitterness in the endless finish. Overall, very portlike...my new all-time favorite Impy!"

"One of the better Stouts out there. Again with some age on it. This beer in my opinion is actually bad fresh. It needs at least 2-5 years of age. I have had this beer in vertical tastings many times and it is so much better with age. It takes all of the alcohol off of it. It is just way to hot fresh. But if you have the patience wait because it is one of the best out there."

"Update: I've aged a few bottles of the 2012 variety and just had one- sickeningly sweet, cloying mouthfeel. Still not a fan; don't understand the hype. Too sweet, no carbonation or bitterness to make it drinkable in the slightest. Anyone want my other bottles?"
""
""
"O. Almost perfect. This ale is great. I let this stand at room temperature from the fridge for about 20 minutes - which was very difficult as I am not a patient person.

"2012 bottling year of Goose Island's Bourbon County Stout. This beer has a bit of a cult following but is getting easier to find nowadays. I've had it on tap and thought it was a bit too boozy for my tastes so I was curious to see what a year would do for the bottled variety. The smell is the best part about this beer when you pour it out. Black as night and a minimal amount of toffee colored head which quickly dissipates. The sweet bourbon and chocolate aroma is amazing. Initial sip starts with rich, almost milk chocolate with a tinge of booze. Much better than the alcohol smash of having a fresh glass. Then comes the problem, the beer is simply too darn sweet. The mid-taste profile of this beer is complex for sure with chocolate, vanilla, coconut hints and LOTS of bourbon which I love, but darn is it sugary too. It reminds me almost of the sweet tooth smack of a vintage port wine. It's not undesirable, but just really unbalanced in what is otherwise a really darn good brew. Overall, a 4.5 and a very good beer that is worth seeking out, but I hope you have that sweet tooth! I prefer the bitter, thick chocolate flow of KBS over this, but it is still a tasty beverage."
""

"12 ounce bottle poured into a small snifter. 2012 vintage. No carbonation, clear, sticky lacing. Aroma includes toasted malt, whiskey, port, maple, alcohol. Taste includes all of the above but the alcohol is well hidden. Some molasses as well. Amazing blend of flavor and truly a masterpiece."

It's always there, and I dont know how often it rotates out but I have to say it never loses it's amazingness, I'm currently aging a bottle I bought last year the day my son was born and look forward to cracking it open on his 1st birthday.... just buy it."

As I get closer I get black licorice, molasses, roasted barley and a lingering sweetness from the bourbon. The mouthfeel is thick and sticky. Plum, raisins, roasted barley, and then the burning warmth of the alcohol coat the tongue and gently warm your throat."

"Jet black and fairly dense looking with a ring of small tan head and no lace at all. Smell is loaded with bourbon, oak and vanilla, bakers chocolates, fudge, incredible roast qualities, a bit of alcohol heat, light coffee as well, an incredible nose in every way. Taste is similar to the nose, roasted malts and bourbon, vanilla, oak, various chocolate flavours, fudge-chocolate chip cookie flavours, a little heat from the alcohol, more bourbon in the aftertaste. Lightly carbonated, big full bodied chewey feel. Just incredible every bit as good as I had anticipated but I still enjoyed BCBCS more, wonderful stuff here."

"Isn't hard to see why this is one of the highest rated beers in the world. It's massively flavorful and integrates the bourbon with the big ass stout in a perfect way. The carbonation is flawless and helps to create a creamy texture, giving an ideal mouthfeel for a big stout like this one. The beer is never cloyingly sweet and is mildly hot, unlike some other massive beers I've tried before. I give it very high marks."

"Pours out thick and black like crude oil. There’s hardly any head, but the small amount that’s visible is a nice tan color. Lots of bourbon on the nose, milk chocolate, leather and booze. Very sweet and warming on the palate. There’s more bourbon, along with chocolate, coffee, leather, cabernet sauvignon grapes, prunes, and black currants…amazingly complex. Smooth and ridiculously creamy in the mouth, this drinks dangerously easy for its ABV. There’s a slight bitterness and also an interesting acidic quality that make all the flavors work together really well. Overall, I’m impressed by the depth and deliciousness of this stout."

"Yes, it is a very elegant and smooth beer with lots of deep flavours. But the hype fooled me, or is it just that barrel aged imperial stouts have got even heavier and more complex during the years? Still, a great dessert beer."

"O: I have to admit, when I first took a whiff of BCBS I was a little hesitant. After all the hype surrounding this beer, I was all too ready to expect disappointment somehow, and the initial nose did not give me confidence. I can happily report, however, that I was DEAD wrong, and delighted to have been so. A rich, robust beast of a beer that I would confidently put forward as a paragon of the BBA stout family. Not a light drinker, not a terribly easy drinker, not a sessionable beer in the least...but for what it is, it's simply spectacular."

"D - A huge stout, that delivers and then some on the promise of bourbon flavor. But the substantial boozy heat and somewhat straight forward flavor doesn't quite do it for me. Maybe my expectations are too high coming into these reviews for big stouts, but I find them to sometimes be overly boozy and offer a one-dimensional barrel aged character. I taste bourbon and booze, but not a whole lot else, and they certainly don't offer a great deal of complexity. If I wanted a bourbon I'd have a bourbon. But, that being said, this is superb beer and to me pushes the envelope for how far craft beer, especially big stouts, can be taken. But if I had the chance to drink this everyday would I go for it? Probably not. Too much alcohol and residual sweetness for me. A late-night sipper but I certainly couldn't drink this often, and there's no way I could have more than one. A great beer, but as silly as it might sound, I'd take an Old Raspy over this 9 times outta 10."

"This is typical BCBS; lots of bourbon, mouthfeel is thick as always, but the beer itself is a little more refined than normal. Great stuff here, and definitely worthy of the work it takes to land it. This is probably the first and last thing I'll thank the Polar Vortex for."

"O- this beer is big, boozy and packed with bourbon flavors. It's definitely a bourbon drinkers beer, which plays well with my palate. Most bourbon barrel stouts taste like an imperial stout with bourbon notes, this is the opposite, the bourbon flavors take center stage. The only thing that kept this from a 5 own taste is the lingering soy sauce flavor in the finish. Otherwise, a world class beer and one I'd drink again and again"

"On tap at Urge's 3rd anniversary. Jet black with almost no head. Smells like bourbon, roasted malts alcohol and vanilla. Taste is incredibly strong, lots of bourbon up front with strong vanilla, and alcohol flavors through the middle and back. Ends with a lingering chocolate flavor. LOTS of warming but the alcohol is not overpowering although very clearly present. Very good but I may not have the palette to discern all the more subtle complexities. It is clearly an insanely complex beer that is done very well and tastes great. That being said I've had other imperial stouts I prefer."

As of now I only know sunset in Allston but if anyone else knows where I can find this in Boston then please share."

"Outstanding."
""
"Wow!! This is one really good bourbon barrel aged stout. I can see why it's a top beer on BA. This beer was packing in the flavor as well as the alcohol. I forgot who I traded to get this beer. OOPS! I would like to see what age will do to this beer....if it will last that long. I doubt father time will calm down the alcohol."

"Overall: This is my second time giving this a go and I am glad I did. My first experience left me thinking this beer was overhyped, but having it again was great.

"O- Very, Very nice barrel aged stout from Goose Island. I think it deserves the stunning reviews it has gotten on Beer Advocate. What a great welcome to Chicago as I found a 4 pack in mid May of BCBS bottled in August of 2012 for $25. I find myself looking for more on the flavor side of things as I did not sense any coffee overtones whatsoever. It is truly a bourbon stout though. Big and sweet and quite hot. Lovely. Cheers."
"O- This is a fantastic beer, but I think the 2012 still needs a few more months for the bourbon to calm down. It is an awesome beer, but I see improving in the future."
""
""
"This beer is without a doubt, incredible. It really is one of the best brews out there. I've tried two bottles of the 2012 now. Pours a thick, light brown head. Very dark in appearance. So sweet and so much bourbon, it can be little much for the mouth at first. It is for sure a slow drinker. 5/5"

"a beer to hunt out and savor"

""
"O- This is always a treat, there's a reason BCBS is coveted year-round no matter what vintage because it's always great. Many people prefer this aged but I like it fresh. The main flavors of vanilla and bourbon are still there but it loses something, at least in my opinion. It's also a lot sweeter. If you've never had BCBS it is a must-have for a beer lover. Definitely a staple for barrel-aged stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The barrel characteristics are so nicely integrated into this beer. Neither the oak or the bourbon jump out at you, but instead add layers of subtle, delightful complexity. This is definitely one of if not my favorite BBA stouts."

"Pours inky black with no discernible head. Wispy tan cap with decent lacing. Aroma of vanilla, bourbon, and chocolate. The palate follows the aroma with big flavors of bourbon, chocolate, dark fruits, followed by some vanilla and coconut. Sweet with some warming from the ABV. Mouthfeel is rich and full with just a touch of carbonation. Overall this is still an incredibly well crafted stout that is every bit the equal of other, much harder to get imperial stouts. Outstanding."
""
""
""
""
"The important question is... How does it stack up to KBS - well, it's a great substitute when KBS isn't available (which is essentially 11 months of the year), but I still prefer KBS as the flavors are brighter, and the ABV is a little more manageable. 15% is pretty ridiculous - almost comical."

"the only thing i think that could be improved on this beer is a bit more head retention. that being said, i realize it doesnt have much because it is a 15% stout, but i had to find something it lacked... and if that was all it lacked, this beer certainly lived up to its hype."
""
""
"Goose Island's barrel aged brews are always top notch and this is certainly no exception. Smells slightly boozy with a roasted chocolate aroma, a great balance. Pours dark black with a thin head that disappears into a dark colored collar. The taste is well balance. You can certainly taste the bourbon but it is no overwhelming, there is a lot going on in this glass that makes everything blend just right. It is heavy in the mouth but goes down smooth. Definitely a beer drinkers beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The best bourbon barrel aged Stout I have ever had."
"Overall: This is a really great imperial stout, and it somehow manages to blend 15% alcohol in and make this one taste even better. The explosion of flavors, smooth mouth-feel and medium-heavy body contribute to make this a fantastic stout. I love this ""fresh"" and would be interested to try it with some age on it."
"Beer seems like too common a word for Bourbon County though, as this stuff is anything but common."

""
"Been sipping on this for almost 2 hours and it is JUST NOW mellowing a bit. It is definitely a sipper; like having a 12 oz pour of a quality bourbon. Certainly a little harsh with the alcohol but in the end worth it. Glad I still have a 4-pack to taste over the year to see how it progresses."
""
""

"Overall: Very good, but overhyped. Not the perfection I was hoping for. We'll see what a few years does for it."

"Definitely worth the attention it gets. Comparing this brew to others of the style/hype/etc, I rate this one pretty high because it is quite balanced, not overly hot, and the bourbon/oak component is far more subtle than in others. It feels like an 11 or 12% brew, not something in the 15 and up range. Damned good stuff, sir."

"Jet black, thick syrup, aged perfectly. This beer aged for five years is so far in advance of any bourbon forward brew that I have had ever. This is my first Goose Island, and I am impressed. I don't get much of the midwest incredible BA stouts in CO, I figured we would, but no. Incredible, perfect smell and mouthfeel. Taste is not far behind. One of my favorite beers. I will be looking for this one soon. And this is not even the RARE, but I can imagine back in 2008 things were a little more refined."

"Wow. I keep picking up as many packs I can. If not to trade, I'd be happy having a whole stash to myself and whoever wants to partake in a drink. Heavy bourbon notes. Wonderful, chewy, oily.. I compare all stouts' mouthfeels to this one. (The Baudoinia variant is just a little better to me though, less heat, more subdued and balanced taste, with the thickness I like) Pitch black in color, modest head and carbonation. I'm grateful it comes from my city. Thanks, GI."

"Im definitely one of those guys that has a hard time giving out the highest score on a scale system. That being said this beer comes pretty damn close. Definitely a sipper, this guy needs time to develop. I would recommend letting this beer stand at room temp for a little while before diving in. You really can tear apart some of those deeper chocolate/ fruit flavors after its had time to breath a bit. This beer was recommended by a customer and from his description I was really looking forward to trying it. In retrospect I feel like I should thank him the next time I see him, this stout totally lived up to everything he said it would be. You can pick up the aromas of this beer the second you crack the top and the carbonation exhales form the bottle. I got a strong woody/fudgeness going on right off the bat. The pour wasn't all that exciting,(not subtracting from this beer in anyway) a slight fizzy head that dissipated rather quickly to a slight brownish halo, which stuck around a while. Initialing I found the bourbon flavors most prominent, which was nice, I mean it for sure lives up to its name. The best part by far though was after about 20 minutes. That is when it warmed up and the real depth developed. The high alcohol content is alway there, but the balance between it, the strong woody/ bourbon tones, and the chocolately/fruity/stout characteristics really was spectacular. I can see why this beer has a real cult following. I would recommend it to anyone who challenges that beer cant equal the depth wine has to offer!"
""
"O. Very nice. Something I'll hold on to and I look forward to future tastings as well as how aging will change it."
""
""
""
""

""
"Overall: It's worth the money! The cost is steep but once you taste it, it's ""ah-hah!"" The flavors are huge. I know I'm exaggerating but it's almost like this is CONCENTRATED barrel-aged imperial stout."

""

"Overall: Awesome beer. I don't really need to say much more."

"I don't miss Indiana, but I miss being able to drive to the Windy City and drink this from the source. We had the Bourbon County Coffee Stout at the source, and that quickly became one of our favorite beers of all time. This one isn't far behind. Top 10, for sure! Bravo, Goose!"

"Poured from 12oz brown bottle into stemmed tulip (stout glass). Pours oily brown-black, no light shows through. Fizzy dark brown half-finger head that dissipates like a soda. Smell is bourbon very strong, with sweet undertones. First sip and taste is...mind-shattering. Incredibly complex, the taste explodes in your mouth with bitter chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, coffee, everything. This is an experience in a bottle. Alcohol comes in at the end to finish with a nice burn, but still a lot less than you'd expect from 15%. Mouthfeel is slick and wet. A glorious beer."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. The bourbon is very rich. Certainly a sipper. You must like bourbon to truly enjoy this, especially since bourbon is the primary flavor. It makes me very excited to try the bottles that are currently aging. This is a must have BA stout."
"Overall, this is excellent and well balanced. It could use just a touch less bourbon and I'd consider it basically perfect."
""
""
""

"A strong and robust stout that currently holds the place of favored stout for me. An acquired taste that may not be for those who do not appreciate a good bourbon! If you are lucky enough to find the stout in any package type I urge you to try this recent home run from Goose Island."

"Words cannot describe this beer. My first perfect score, ever. This was brewed by the Gods themselves. Much has been already written about this brew, so I'll simply say that this is perfection in a bottle. My search is officially over. Until they stop producing this, I will seek out and buy every bottle I can get my hands on."

"That being said, this type of beer is brand new to me. I never imagined that bourbon and a well-crafted stout could combine to this level of perfection; with devastation looming on each and every side of this creation, the balance that needs to be achieved in order to be delicious is a daunting undertaking. With each successive sip I give this beer my blessing, and yet I might rate this somewhat artificially low just so that I force my hand to adjust the score when I am a more well-rounded and experienced beer drinker. In any case, know this loyal fans, THIS BEER IS OUTRAGEOUSLY GOOD, LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF AN F. SCOTT FITZGERALD NOVEL. But then again, if you don’t like bourbon, I suggest a hard veer away from this monster."

"I had heard of this beer over and over again and I was happy with my BlackOps and Old Raspy Barrel Aged, but wow did they get this beer right.

Thank you Closisinthehouse for the new addiction."

"O- I always look forward to getting my hands on this offering very winter. The big bourbon character and rich body make this one for the cold nights of northern WI. One of the staples of barrel aged beers hits the spot every time and is always recommended."

"One of my favorite beers outright. If it had even a little head retention it would be a perfect 5 on the look. So heavy on the bourbon but still awesome suble flavors of vanilla and chocolate. It doesn't get much better in my book for a bourbon barrel stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As a final note I can't believe how well the bourbon is hidden! I had a Founders Backwoods bastard (10.2%) and it was boozy and harsh even with 5 months on it. How they hide the 15% is beyond incredible!"

"O- If you could make this into a candle it would be magnificent. As a beer it is very poor. It does one thing, and it takes it overboard. I had really high hopes for this beer but it is so out of balance it's nauseating. There is so much wood and bourbon in this beer, it's impossible to enjoy the base malt or roast. I will not buy this again, or recommend it to anyone. In fact, i'm amazed at it's BA rating. It does one thing really well, too well in fact, does it make it deserving of such a high rating? I'm not qualified to answer that question."

"Was lucky enough to have this again a second time. Beer is borderline black with a dark brown head. Flavor is awesome, lot of sweetness and bourbon flavor imparted from the barrel aging. Very heavy and good mouthfeel. Due to sweetness and heaviness it would be hard to drink more than one of these. Overall an incredible beer."
""
""
""
""

"The abundance of alcohol masks some of the best roasted chocolate characteristics of an imperial stout for me. But no denying this as a unique robust imperial stout."
""
"Bottom line....this is my favorite beer....IMO in the top three for one of the best beers I have ever had. Definitely worthy of a ""5" rating across the board. I have drank a good bit of BCBS and tried(I think) almost all of the varieties, and while some BCB varieties are just as good, all around, regular BCB is the best. I am not going to go into detail on each and every attribute of the beer, but the taste is the flippin best!!!! The thickness of this stout is great and the bourbon is sl strong and nice and great tasting. Some find this beer as too ""boozy", which i think is ridiculous....it is great...hope it never changes!!"

"Overall - Definitely a dessert beer. Something to sip and enjoy over a good conversation. It's a hot one at 15%, but overall, very delicious. Looking forward to the 2013 batch already."
"09 Bottle enjoyed in Philadelphia out of a duvel snifter. I have a broken hand, so I'll make this brief as I just wrote a dark lord review. This beer is amazing. Definitely worth the $8 I paid for a 3 year old bottle. I also have a buddy who has a reserve of 09, so I will buy more in the future. This beer has a serious bourbon bite, but not too alcoholy (if that makes sense). The taste is mild chocolate, VERY light coffee, and mild dark fruits. As I said before, the bourbon bite is damn near perfect. Try this beer. Do it! And I'm sure the beer is better with age, as the first one that I've had is an 09 in 2013."

"If you haven't tried this one yet, make it your mission. It actually holds up to all the hype, which I think is pretty rare. The only reason I didn't give it fives is because I haven't tried enough of its competitors. Given it's cost, it will always be a special occasion brew for me, but I do not feel that it is overpriced. Can't wait to share some with friends. (I can spare one bottle, maybe.) Cheers!"
""
"Edit: I had to edit this because I realized it makes me sick. It's undrinkable and while the taste is interesting it's not very enjoyable after all. Well, I still like it and recommend it, but only in very small doses."

"O- This beer lives up to the hype. For me personally the smell had everything you want with this type of beer but the taste fell short of that for me. The smell was more concise and linear you could say while the taste was more erratic and did not have the extremely enjoyable aspects of what the aroma contained. Overall this beer is done beautifully and does not drink like a 15% imperial stout."

"Overall: The gold standard for barrel aged imperial stouts and I've enjoyed it each time I've had it whether its from the bottle or the tap. I've had a few other BA stouts that attempt to dethrone it, and while they are incredible in their own ways, I consider BCBS to be the granddaddy of them all. The only negative is that it's not a beer to take lightly- open one up when you have something to celebrate or are hankering for a bone-warmer in front of the fireplace- you prepare yourself to take on a beer like this. Don't open one up if you want to hang out with some buddies after work- open up a Zombie Dust or something if you do that- respect BCBS. (4.5)"

"This is an amazing beer, probably the best barrel aged beer I've ever had. This is complex, with lots of different flavors and aromas. Wow!"
"O- Believe the hype. Drink this beer. It is what it is: the king of barrel aged stouts."

"Overall: I finally understand this beer. Have had it a few times before and was extremely put off by the bourbon flavor. My palate must have changed a bit because this bottle is fresh and I love it. Delicious!"
"Not drinking as well as the 2011 right now, but I am not sure how this version could be any better."
""
"Pours a near black with a fizzy light brown head that didn’t stick around. Smells heavy on bourbon, wood, vanilla. Lots of cherry too. Taste is similar to smell. Sweet cherry and vanilla up front, supported by a bourbon backbone that finishes up chocolate. Strangely tastes like a chocolate covered cherry. I’ll buy one more pack to have one or two to compare over the next few years. Impressive beer."
"O- I'm addicted, seriously bad. This may be my top 5... damn you Ohio abv laws"
"2012 run in a snifter glass (cellaring my 2014s). Silky smooth; can really smell the bourbon, but it's so balanced with vanilla and touch of chocolates notes. Bourbon hits, but not overpowering at all, perfectly balanced. Have to be really careful with this one, definitely a sipper, and it deserves to be sipped, and relished. Aging only makes it smoother!"

I’ve never been a big fan of Bourbon Aged Beers, and I had my doubts about Goose Island after having some of their other offerings. But I must say… I’m now a believer. I had been resisting this beer for a while but this one totally lives up to the hype. I really cannot believe an ABI beer can be this good. This sets the standard for all bourbon barrel aged beers."

"Had to purchase a four pack online because of Ohios dumb 12% abv law. I've been holding out and was glad to finally have my first bcs. Poured 12oz bottle into snifter. pours oil black with a very quick fading dark tan head. Smells boozy, oaky, dark fruits, lots of bourbon. Texture is very velvety and smooth.Taste is AMAZING boozy bourbon, oak, dark creamy chocolate, some dark fruits, a little sweetness. Overall I see why this is such a hyped beer, it's pretty complex and very tasty. I'm very impressed with it and its everything I wanted."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I didn't want to believe the hype. But, now, I'm a believer."
"How does a beer this big fit into a bottle so small? This beer is why bombers and growlers were invented. So unassuming in its drab label and 12 oz. classic-style bottle. Pop the top--kaboom! It pours a very dark grayish brown, with a mocha head that barely forms before it completely attenuates. Chocolate syrup, vanilla extract, and oaky coconut on the nose. The mouthfeel is quite viscous and chewy. Smooth flavors of chocolate, vanilla, tobacco, minced meat pie, and oaky bourbon. Alcohol appears midway, bittering the last half and finish a little too much. But, it does temper all the sweetness. Very Parabola-like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer is just amazing. I don't know if I can even call it beer, it's more like candy. Yes, I had to sip it, but I was sipping this thing constantly as I needed to keep having a drink of this. This beer has set an extremely high standard for BA'd stouts in my book. If I ever have a chance to grab one, I'd bare knuckle box the hipsters at binny's for one of these. I can see what all the fuss is about."
""
""
""
""
""
""
" and this is one of my favorites"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - After a few sips and some time for it to sink into the tongue, the oak and a yeasty medicinal taste start to crop up. The bourbon also comes through afer a third of the bottle is done. At some point, this beer overstayed its welcome. This may be the most interesting stout I've ever had, though I cannot say it's my favorite. I would recommend this to any dark beer or bourbon fan to try, but a bottle is too much."
""
"O: While this is certainly a sipper, it isn't nearly as hot as one might think. I often identify some of the best high-octane brews as having a ""candy-coated booze"" quality. This one certainly fits that bill like a glove."

"I could barely detect the vanilla and bourbon flavours other reviewers have noted - they seemed completely drowned out by the overwhelming taste of malty yeast.

"Alcohol? It's here. Don't plan on finishing this in less than an hour and a half. This might be the most aggressive beer that I've ever had but there's no doubt that this is the smoothest that I've enjoyed as well. This one's a beast but it's worth taming and savoring for all that she's worth. Beers lie this don't come around often so I'm glad that I gave this a go, if for no other reason that this is a dessert and a cordial beautifully interwoven together."

"MF - Oily and viscous with a sticky mouthfeel. An absolute must have beer!"
"O: Definitely one of my favorite beverages of all time. I thought the 2008 was unreal... then I had the 2012. Enough said. I can't wait for it's sibling to mature."
""
"Overall, I agree with everyone else. This is a world class brew and I would buy it every chance I got. If the quality has depreciated at all after the selling of GI (which I can't speak to since this is my first bottle ever), then I can't imagine what it was like before because this is one phenomenal beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Some argue this is not craft beer anymore due to change of ownership—we say “bollocks” to that. BCS has cult status and deservedly so. A slow sipper due to the size, and closing in on perfection makes it very easy to sip!! Cheers to Goose Island for its continuation and expansion within their barrel program."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is what any barrel aged stout should aspire to. It's not overly sweet, no oxidation or sourness, no syrup, no soy sauce. It is highly complex with layers of distinct flavors and delicious bourbon. This beer in many ways reminded me of Firestone Walker Parabola (or vice versa). I really wish this beer came out West because it truly is worth seeking out or trading for. My local bourbon barrel aged stouts are good, but for a non-California beer BCBS is every bit as good if not better. Be careful though, with its high drinkability and 15% ABV, it's a dangerous little bottle."

"I call this my ""football game beer."" Meaning that it takes and entire football game to get through a 12oz bottle. Each sip needs to be savored. This isn't for the faint of heart but also isn't SO intense that it isn't enjoyable. What a solid beer."
""
"Malty decadence and booze do to my mind what hoppy beers do to my taste buds. An after-hours macho sipper. The rule-setter. The beer that the others hold a candle to. Who needs an afterthought? Let 'em have the score, why don't you!"

"If a fresh BCBS is this good, I can only imagine what it would be like once it matured. Truly a great experience for fans of bourbon and beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The fourth bottle, aged over a year, is clearly the best. It also pushes my score of this masterpiece of a beer up. Glad I sat on these for so long. Seemed like a daunting task at first, but sadly a year passes too quickly. An amazing beer!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Does this beer live up to all the hype? I cannot really definitively say it is quite good but not mind blowing for me. The most impressive/surprising thing for me is the fact that the bourbon taste is not over powering even after the beer warms up. The alcohol is also pretty well hidden in the taste and feel particularly for how high it is that is impressive. I am looking forward to trying aged or other taste varieties (if I can ever get my hands on them)"
""
"O: Overall, this is an excellent beer. It's not my favorite stout, but I be hard pressed to find flaws in this beer."
""
"2012 vintage... Wow, this beer is nice. Potent alcohol and malt dominate the aroma. Molasses and figs and a heavy alcohol are the backbone of the illustrious flavor. A robust body backs this beer up in grand fashion. This beer affirms my love of good beer."
"O: I can see how aging this beer will bring out some amazing flavor. There is nothing but continuous flavor with each sip. If you haven't had it yet, you need to make this happen!"
"Overall: Goose Island Bourbon County products never disappoint. The depth of these beers is certainly among the elite. The price tag may seem extreme but I dare say anyone who knows their beer would say these do not live up to the hype."
""
""
"It poured a starless midnight sky black, with an ever so small mocha colored head that immediately dissipated. The aroma was a beautiful blend of bourbon, coffee, roasted malt and vanilla. The taste mimicked the aroma but also brought flavors of tobacco and chocolate. The body of the beer was thick and viscous, coating my tongue and leaving a warming sensation in the back of my throat."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a great example of the style, and one that benefits greatly from some aging to take some harshness off the bourbon finish. A big ass beer to be drank cautiously for sure, as it straddles the line of being just almost too much."
"disclaimer: my wife does not like the taste of beer. She's a girly girl. After I taste a really good beer, she will have a sip of mine and almost without fail her response is an unimpressed, ""tastes like beer"". but my zeal for this beer has been passed on to her. After her first sip, she loved it and asked for her own glass. Talk about falling in love all over again!! she has shared this with me on 2 of the occasions and is excited to share this me with on many more. BCBS, you reign supreme. You might just have the honor of having my 2nd born child named after you...just kidding. that'd be silly. But seriously BCBS is AMAZING! Find it, Savor it. Repeat."
""
"2012 vintage. Pours black with very thin, brown head. Aroma of bourbon, chocolate and soy sauce. Strong flavors of bourbon balanced by rich chocolate and a hint of coffee. Heavy with little carbonation and a lingering finish. Definitely meets all my expectations about this beer."

"Sat afternoon wildcard weekend and I bump into this little jewel of a brew. I hadn't even heard of this one before, but sitting here at the Holy Grail in Epping, NH and this is on the menu, a special and its been a while since I had anything that comes close to the all around special combo of flavors of this bourbon stout. Coats your mouth and you get this bourbon chocolate boozey rush down your throat with a touch of vanillla, this is extreme delicious well crafted heaven! I can't recall ever having something this special, I love the bourbon edge just something to talk about, they only let me have two!!! but I will be back!!"
"The joyous complication is much more apparent in the flavor, thank goodness. Fresh vanilla, vanilla extract, fire, stout malt, oak, whiskey, super ripe fruit, more fire, and cane sugar. Still almost unbelievably rich, although the body gets a little thin on the back end."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Although just a tad brash in its current form, it's still one hell of a beer. The flavor profile is unreal and hides the strong abv% very well. Can you imagine what a year in the cellar will do to this beer? You mean, besides making me cry about the fact that I didn't buy more? Amazing."

Nice bourbon and its barrel alongside a nice, rich and sweet chocolate, molasses, and a kiss of vanilla in the finish alongside some nice unaggressive roasted malt. Sweeter than I anticipated, not a critique but an observation. A fuller, velvety and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this beer is phenomenal. I had high hopes going into this one and my expectations were well exceeded."

""
""
""
"O-Great beer. I was ready to be let down, but this beer lived up to the hype. My only knock would be that it's a little on the sweet side."
""
""
""
"O - This brew is potent (15% abv). Most definitely must be sipped, as you would a brandy. The first reason is to savor the flavor...the second is so that you don't pass out after 12 oz. Best tasting experience I've had with a brew which exceeds 10% abv."
""
"O- A huge, dark, full-flavored bourbon barrel stout. This beer is everything you would want from a huge beer. Just enough alcohol comes through to let you know it is there, but the barrel flavors come through in an even bigger way."
""
""
""
"With this beer, Goose Island is competing with Jim Beam and Jack Daniels. Very strong bourbon flavor. This beer is syrupy and sweet. Drinking an entire 12 oz bottle in one sitting is not for the feint of heart."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is easily one of the most enjoyable stouts that I have tasted. The big bourbon flavor shines through while preserving all of the things I like in a stout including chocolate and coffee undertones."

"O – I keep having the impression that these bourbon-barrel aged beers will be mostly beer with a little bit of bourbon. I keep being disappointed. Maybe my impression is wrong, but I would really prefer a beer that is mostly beer with a little bit of bourbon. And I like bourbon. I just don’t want to be drinking bourbon when I’m drinking a beer. I guess for what it’s supposed to be and for what my experience with these kinds of beers has been so far, this is one worthy of at least a 4."
"O - honestly, this is one of the best beers the predominance of anyone can get their hands on, in my opinion. It's really a true winter-god of beers that sorta stands as a one-and-done but provides everything you'd want in terms of flavor, booze, complexity, and balance. The only awful thing I can say is that I am straight up hoarding these despite the fact I expect this to be readily available in a couple years. There's no way I can imagine going that long without it."

"O: Delicious! Lives up to the hype. Just enough burn to remind you you're drinking a big BA stout."

"Overall: A very good beer, it is tasty, and complex, and the mouthfeel is excellent. But a bit too strong, the high alcohol detracts in terms of unwanted drying and bitterness.

"After having bottle #2 at a more neutral temperature (about 50 F), it really opens up, losing a bit of sweetness and alcohol concealment - but gaining tons of balance, subtlety, complexity, and drinkability.

I enjoyed my first bottle last night and I have to admit that it was truly an outstanding bourbon-barrel aged Imperial Stout! The aroma is amazing and it is chewy, creamy, and thick on the tongue. I believe that BCBS is a much better example of what the style should be than Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout. It is one of the few beers that I have encountered that truly deserves all the hype that it has received. I compared it, side-by-side, with a Great Lakes Barrel-Aged Blackout Stout of the same vintage year, and the BCBS was by far, the better beer. Very impressive to say the least."

"O - An incredibly viscous, tasty stout. The bourbon and oak really stands out and is a nice compliment to the sweet malt and dark fruit flavors. The high alcohol content is masked extremely well. This is a superb beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"A pretty good double-imperial but the KBS is clearly a superior one. I have no regrets shelling out money for this since it should keep me happy for the rest of a Boston winter. I recommend drinking this beer straight from the four pack and not putting it in the fridge. The chocolate seems easily muted."

"O: Very solid beer, I would love to get my hands on a few more and seem how it progresses. My guess is it gets better after a year or two on it."
""
""
"O: This was really good, and I can't wait to try more with some age on it. But honestly I was a little disappointed. The bourbon flavors seemed to overwhelm so many of the other flavors here. It did improve as it warmed."
""
"Bourbon County Brand Stout, 2012 vintage, appeared as black as night with a chocolate-milk colored head. There seemed to be some light carbonation in the beer, which kept a small ring of bubbles afloat. Great lacing as the beer went down, too. The aroma was marvelous, with strong bourbon and vanilla dominating. The taste had quite a bit of the whiskey showing through, of course along with molasses, raisins, cream and loads of maltiness. The beer seemed medium-bodied and only just coated the mouth lightly, for a beer so rich in flavor. The very high ABV hid itself very well. A true masterpiece in American brewing!"

""
""
""
""
"O - Does it live up to the hype? Probably not, but thats much more to do with the hypeheads as opposed to the beer. Its a really really good beer. As a beer you can get off the shelf (in areas other than my own) it is unbelieveably good. Glad to get to try some vintages before the InBev take over."
""
""
""
"This would have to be one of the most complex barrel aged ‘big beers’ I have ever had. It was definitely one to savor and enjoy over the course of many hours. I would definitely recommend cellaring this one for at least 5 or more years to help zero in to any true oak characters. The residual whiskey of a fresh bottle just seemed to distract from many of the other potential notes to be discovered in this beer."
"Pours black as night with 1/8"" coffee colored head and leaves very little lacing. The smell is primarily that of bourbon, but with a nice whiff of dark chocolate and molasses in the background. The taste has allot more dark fruit and molasses then the smell but the overall flavor is based of the bourbon and manages to be extremely subtle with the booze while packing allot of flavor. The mouthfeel is perfect for a big beer letting you know its there while still not being like motor oil. Overall im very impressed, and I will have to track down one of the coffee variety."

"Overall an excellent, flavor packed, balanced, complex brew that will instantly light up the eyes of any BA beer fan. Unique and well done, the flavors of a stout and a bourbon aged beer intricately worth together to produce an excellent creation. Definitely a sipper. Worth the price, try it!"

"O- This is the best stout I have ever tasted. I love the richness and the booze and everything else about it. Can't wait to hoard as much as I possibly can and also try a few in years to come with age! Had a hard time not giving this a 5 in every category."
"Very good beer! This is my favorite bourbon barrel aged stout to date. It's definitely a sipper at 15% alcohol! 2012 vintage."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This was a completely amazing beer, but I don't think I was as blown away with this as I thought I would be. Perhaps, the 3 months of life left it a little young (bottle date 9/17/12), but I have another to sit on for a while. I'd definitely seek this out again, although I hope the boozy sweetness dies a little with age."
""
""
""
""
"O: as advertised one of the best bourbon barrel aged stouts out there deffinetly would recommend this and make sure to keep some to cellar"

"Overall, I should let the next one I get age, but it was still one of the best stouts I've had. I can only imagine letting it mellow with some age. If I get my hands on another one, I will."

"I'll be seeking out more trades for this in the days, weeks and months ahead!"

"Amazing beer, but almost too much flavor, large notes of bourbon at first, and then chocolate later on. this is a beer i can only have one of at a time, and not many nights of the week, but all the same, a real treat to be had. Stout lovers will go crazy over this beer but for the rest it will seem like to much."

""
"Overall - I've never had this fresh, but this 2009 seems to have held up well. I imagine the lack of carbonation has to do with the age, but the flavours are all fantastic. Incredibly well balanced and very smooth, this is a beer that deserves it's praise. I'll get it again."
"*A good cigar would probably pair well with this brew, as would a rich, hearty cut of pork loin slathered with caramelized onions and roasted potatoes. Ah, bliss!"

"o- What's left to say? Goose Island brings it yet again and puts to bed any worries about a dip in quality due to the AB-INBEV purchase. BCBS has always been my favorite BA Imp stout with some age on it, but it may be taking a run at Parabola for me as my favorite BA Stout that's ready to drink now!"

"Not a ton of differences. The biggest thing that stood out to me is the intensity of the dark fruits and the bourbon aroma. Warmed more than I remember going down. Also sweeter than I recall."

"a spectacular imperial stout. one of the biggest ive ever encountered. on tap at j. ryans in syracuse, and served in a pint glass for 8 bucks! was sure id never get to try this after the recent sale, but got one from the beer gods. the pour is really black and sticky looking, with only a film of dark dark brown head. the nose is insane, tons of charcoal and wood, this spent some time in a serious barrel. theres also some dried fruit, raisins or something, and fresh tobacco, dark chocolate, vanilla, and loads of booze. the flavor is just as complex and intimidating as the nose, with alcohol and cocoa being key notes. old well used oak is in play as well, as is some pungent vanilla beans, lots of redisual sugars and black licorice. this is really one of the most potent and memorable beers ive had, worth all the hype. the feel is pretty darn heavy, massive body, decent but light carbonation, and a really sticky sludgy feel, like pine pitch or taffy. the whole outside of my glass was like super glue from the little bit that spilled over during the pout. overall an impressive beer, this couldnt be anyones daily drink, but it sure makes a special occasion, i am grateful to have gotten to try this, and i certainly got my fill from that pint. a luxurious and daring brew, a must try if you can get ahold of it."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel - interesting, since it comes into the mouth very smooth, then you get the mild carbonation bite, and then it exits the mouth as smooth as it came in. Very heavy, almost syrupy."
""
"Halfway through the bottle, I'm finding this a chore to finish."
""
""
"Overall: OUTSTANDING. Completely lives up to the extremely high hype for this beer. Definitely worth every penny of the price. Every serious beer lover needs to experience this beer. It is a beer you can sip slowly and really bask in it's glory. Try this ASAP. I'm going to have to track down a constant supply of this beer!"

" Initially shocks the palate with bourbonyness, i mean was this aged in barrels or did they just straight up pour a bottle of bourbon in this pig. some oakiness apparent as well but slight. the boozyness is well masked...initially, i will get to that in a bit. then theres all kinds of beautiful gnarly radical goody grandiose cool groovy flavors that all come out and dance around, this stuff is COMPLEX! i get some caramel, toffee, sweet roasted malts and then awesome coffee flavors all perfectly balanced with bourbon and swirling/dancing on my palate. then the enitre time the most exquiset (spelling?) silky smooth mouthfeel ive expirienced... finally after all of those flavors are dancing / battling for the predominant flavor to rise to the top, it continues in the aftertaste wich lingers for well over a minute. FINALLY after about a minute and a half the booziness comes out...slowly...subtley but DEFINATLY there. starts in the back of the throat then works its way slowly down the esophogus warming but not burning as it descends and actually warms the stomach upon contact leaving me blissfully and comfortably numb.... PERFECT BEER IN EVERY WAY! (for this style) wish i could crack open the last kbs thats in my fridge just to do a side by side, im leaning towards this one being the winner in that EPIC battle."

"Overall: I understand now why I spent 20 bucks on a 4 pack. This is well worth it. This was my first experience tasting Bourbon County and I know that some age will definitely maintain the awesomeness of this brew. The hardest part will be to not drink all of them. Outstanding beer and this definitely sets the standard for all other barrel aged stouts."
""
"O: This is a great beer that I am grateful is distributed (albeit in limited quantities) to VA. I am going to try one every 2-3 months and see where I like it best. It is hard to imagine it will get a lot better than fresh -- I see why people like it fresh because the bourbon component is accenting and nothing more, it doesn't need toning down. BCBS is a phenomenal beer."
""
"O: An outstanding oak aged with a lot of bourbon character. The overall smells and flavor is like that of coconut covered burbon chocolates. This one should develop in the bottle for years, I had a three year old one a couple months back and it was oh so nice."

"Overall - Seriously, buy this beer and drink it posthaste. One of the best, if not the best, I have ever had. Like a religious experience drinking this. Unbelievable."
""
"O - Very tough beer to identify the many many flavors. Am I drunk or just impressed because I'm now repeating myself? This little 12oz beer is to be shared amongst friends. I think this is a great beer, hard to even place in an Imperial stout category because it can stand alone at 15% ABV. Very complex beer that will make your bud light drinker cry."

""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This thing is the real deal and I'm so glad I finally got a chance to try it. Would take this over KBS, which up till this point was my favorite stout. GI's distribution is now hitting PA and I sincerely hope that maybe, just maybe some point down the road this thing comes around more regularly."

"Overall: MMMazing. I now understand the hype for this beer. It is otherworldly. The perfect blend of whiskey and beer. All those wonderful flavors you look for in a stout and the addition of bourbon certainly brings this one to another level."
""
""
"O: Awesome beer, absolutely lives up to the hype. This one was bottled 09/06/2012 so it is very fresh and that explains how heavy the bourbon flavor and smell is. I'm looking forward to trying them after one, two and three years."

"Date: September 6, 2011 Mode: Bottle Source: Stout Tasting, Lakeville, MN Appearance: Opaque black, no head. Aroma: Bourbon and chocolate. Flavor: Consistent with aroma, thick bodied, oily and strong alcohol finish. Other: This was really good, but not quite as good as the Rare. 2009 vintage. 12.5.11 - had the 2011 vintage and think this version is smoother than the 2009 bottle with a sweeter more licorice finish. Upping palate to 5, this stuff rocks!"
""
""
"Overall I have always loved this beer and was very happy to get this years batch. Going to try to hold one for a year then I think it will get 5/5 on taste and mouthfeel."
""
"O: Tastes fine fresh, but can't wait to see how this tastes a year or two from now."
""
""
"O-I served this beer too cold and have been sipping it for over an hour. The beer improves as it warms. Sweet boozy bourbon barrel chocolatel stout, booze is up front in your face. this beer needs to warm up and mellow out for full enjoyment. good winter sipper"
""
""
""
"I'm normally not a fan of bourbon beers, but this is pretty good. It's like the sweetness battles with the alcohol and the effort balances each into a workable beer. Very strong, a sipper where only one is plenty. Glad I was able to find this and happy I bought a 4-pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OK, now tried a 2013 bottle. Something strange about the on-tap version. The bottle pours viscous, and that viscosity carries over to the mouthfeel. Full, big, velvety, and smooth carbonation. The flavor is right on with chocolate, beautiful vanilla, bourbon, anise, and wow this is yum. This is what I except from this beer. It delivered."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good beer with good depth of flavor but I only bought it to cross it off my beer of fame list . The rest will go into the cellar."
""
"Personal : 4.75 just for the alcohol and balance. I have spent over 5 bucks so it does deserve that. Value for money not so much. (Yes you won't get this much alcohol so easily.)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Wow, great beer, on par with the best bourbon aged beer I have had. The 15% ABV is well hidden, I knew it was going to be high, but I had to look it up and read it twice to believe that it was that high. Find this beer and try it, just sip it slowly though."
""
"O: After drinking this, I can definitely buy into the hype. So good, so complex. Just make sure to take your time, as the 15% is not noticeable. Worth the $$ for the 4-pack. Definitely a must-try if you're into BBA stouts"
""
""
""
"O - Exceptional beer. Big and bold. If you love bourbon you'll love this beer. Its got big bourbon flavors and is sticky sweet. It's a perfect dessert!"
""
""
"What a beer, just as advertised. This really lives up to the hype with entertainment for the senses in a well balanced Imperial Stout the whole way through."
""
""
""
"D- this needs to be sipped and slowly enjoyed with conversation or deep thought. The 15% is there but is so much in balance with the amazing taste that you only really notice it in the a warming aftertaste. Overall this is a huge beer with an amazing unique flavor."
""
"O - This is a very impressive beer. To be able to make a bourbon barrel aged beer this young and this big which is this drinkable is a real achievement. I maintain that sticking to 6 ounces at a time is recommended, simply to avoid the affects of too much 15% ABV beer, but this does not fatigue or overwhelm the palate the way many giant beers do when young."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Unique beer that's for sure. I enjoyed about 4 ounces and then tired of it. I guess I'm not into over the top barrel aged beers. Glad I only bought a 4-pack as I have no desire to drop $20+ of my hard earned money on more of this stuff."
""
""
""

"ps- The Stables is the only place to find this on tap in a 45 mile radius. So if you happen to be passing through town please enjoy a fine brew at one of the finest establishments in our small town."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a really good big beer that will only improve with some age. I look forward to review this beer again after it has aged for a year. At this point the alcohol is still very prominent in the flavor profile and the rest of the flavors have not finished blending together. But, the oak in this beer is very strong and just what I want in a cask aged beer. There is also some good complexity with the dark dried fruit, chocolate, and grain supporting the malt sweetness, bold oak, and alcohol heat. This beer is a “must try” for fans of big bold oak flavors in malt-centered big beers."
"i was expecting this to be very rough since it was bottled recently (and at 15%) but it went down quite smoothly. very tasty, but a little on the sweet side. i'm gonna let the other 3 bottles sit for a few years, see how it ends up."
"Jet black pour with no head to a snifter glass. The smell is Bourbon all day, very nice but not easy deciphering what's hanging out behind it.. I suspect some chocolate and heavily roasted grain. Taste is all bourbon, chocolate, maybe vanilla and coffee somewhere. Coating mouthfeel, heavy and sweet. As a big whiskey fan it is fantastic, truly as close to drinking bourbon as you can get from beer. It lives up to its name and in that sense does not disappoint. Looking forward to seeing how they develop with age."
"Awesome beer. Worth the 4pk price tag for a once a year treat."
""
"I am not a bourbon man per se, nor do I have a favourite bourbon. I do enjoy it in season, which for me, is now into Christmas. Love those Manhattans!! Life is to short to be cellaring beers. I love this one right out of the gate. I wouldn't want that bourbon thang to go away. I drink it now! It is worth repeating...one sip has more flavor than your average case of beer. So consider this when you pay the sum."
""
"I just had a bottle, thanks to a good friend. The beer is very black and thick once poured out of the bottle. You immediately smell bourbon, vanilla oak and slow roasted coffee. The more I drank, the more complex this beer became. It kept changing notes. I was picking up all the typical flavors of an imperial stout, plus that very noticeable bourbon taste!! I would highly recommend you locate this beer. Do not be turned off by its 15.00% ABV. Simply Amazing!!"

""
""

"O: Extremely good beer, if not the best beer I've ever had. I am going to pick up a 4 pack asap"

"This is one for the ages. Of all the beers I've gone to length's to track down, this has been the finest. Hand's down! I've been drinking bourbon for longer then I've been drinking beer so this is right in my wheelhouse but it suceeds on every level! The bourbon, oak, and vanilla nose. Black as night pour with lingering mocha head. Layers of flavors folding into each other; oaky, vanilla, dark chocalate coating the mouth. Worth All the Effort!"
"Half inch of carmel colored head that dissipated after a minute or two, but clung to the glass well. Smelled of all things primo stout: burnt coffee, chocolate... but mostly boozy bourbon. First sip follows the nose with a fiery taste of bourbon that smooths into what you'd expect from a great imperial stout. After several sips I also got hints of black licorice. The smell and taste of bourbon is great and sticks like cigarette smoke. This is definitely one of those beers that will lead to the, ""How long and how much have you been drinking?!"" question that you may get from your significant other. But it's a really fantastic beer, especially for the colder months... it warms you right up!"
""
"A MUST HAVE FOR ANY BEER GEEK"
""
"O - I can't say enough about this beer. So unbelievably good! A perfect beer."
"O: BCBS needs to age (minimum three or four years) in order to be an enjoyable beer, IMO. This beer is absolutely amazing and thoroughly enjoyable. Too bad there’s not too many bottles of 2006 floating around out there, but if you have a bottle of this vintage, enjoy it! If you have some bottles (or cases) of the vintages from recent years, let them sit a while and enjoy in a few years; you will not be disappointed. If you are, just send any unwanted bottles my way!"
""
""
"O worth the hype! This is my first year drinking it and I can't wait to see how it ages"
"Wow this is one super beer. If is ain't black it's close. Smallish fizzy looking dark tan head that does not last long and there is more of a creep down the side of the glass than there is lacing. Smell is a real head turner. Bourbon this smooth is rare. It is balanced by a RIS sweetness and lots of chocolate and coffee. Notes of vanilla and oak, cherries and molasses. Good amount of alcohol but it is exhilarating. Taste is so smooth and complex. All the things that are in the nose but so well integrated it drinks easily and deliciously. A deep chocolate covered cherry body. Lots of wood aged bourbon and lightly singed caramel. Coffee from the nose is latte and cappuccino smooth and mellow on the tongue. Feel is lightly syrupy with a touch of slickness. A perfect carbonation gives enough of a break to your tongue to give a restorative quality. It may be a thick rich luxurious brew but it drinks so easily that it is almost scary. This is an extraordinarily well crafted beer. It has superb flavor, feel, and drinkability. Refined from top to bottom. The nose is seductive. Palate is complex and it develops as it warms. Drinkability is high and sneaky good. Wow this stuff is the bomb!"
""
"Assuming this was young or fresh keg, the possibilities, the potential for aging this beer - it was weighing heavy on my sodden mind. I don't go out of my way to seek out beers (for the most part), but I must admit that I wouldn't hesitate to grab a 4-pack or 2 of this if we crossed paths again."
"O- Great complex beer that deserves your full attention and could possibly be one of the best imperial stouts I have had. I wasn't sure about the cost as it rivals dark lord (and I think Dark lord is over rated), but after the first sip it quickly became clear that this beer is worth every penny and I will run out and pick up the 4-pack tomorrow morning."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This one lived up to the hype for me. One of the most complex, full aroma and taste profiles I have ever come across in a beer. The barrel is noticeable immediately with huge toasted oak and tobacco aromas that seem to fill the whole room. The flavors are everchanging with the temperature. The mouthfeel is unreal. If you like bourbon-forward sipping beers, this is the best in its class."

"O-very tasty IS with great flavor and balance, one to savor and to cellar for the future"
"Bottom line: World Class Stout!"
"O- This is a masterpiece. I can only imagine what the other variants are like and what a little bit of age will do to this leviathan of a beer."
"Picked this up from a great trade with muskabeatz (Evan)! An aggressive pour yielded a pitch black body with a beautiful caramel-colored one finger head that unfortunately faded almost immediately with minimal lacing. The nose is nothing short of heaven! As soon as I popped the cap I could smell it. Huge and roasty with tons of bourbon and double chocolate fudge along with hints of coffee, oak, vanilla, booze, and molasses. The taste is just as big and just as bold. Chocolate fudge and bourbon are again the stars along with a ton of oak. And the chocolate is not subtle. It's like eating a chocolate fudge brownie. Absolutely amazing! It's nicely complemented with hints of vanilla, espresso, tobacco, molasses, and a touch of black cherry and smoke. The mouthfeel is smooth as silk and thick as molasses. The finish is spicy with an amazing alcohol burn. Yeah, it's 15%, but I could easily drink another. Bourbon aged stouts are my favorite style, and this is the best I've had to date. Probably the best beer I've tasted!"
""
"Overall: This is one the finest barrel aged beers made today and is by far my favorite bourbon barrel-aged imperial stout! This is a beer that really blows me away every time and I would recommend this to anyone that has a palate for big imperial stouts and bourbon/whiskey barrel-aged beers. I will also suggest putting aside a few bottles and cellaring them for a few years down the road. They will age very well!"
""
"Pours an opaque black with a thin fizzy light brown head which quickly dissipates. The nose is dominated by big bourbon booziness and heavy oak barrel with lighter accents of dark fruit. Opens with a blast of bourbon and oak joined by vanilla, raisins, plum and notes of black cherry. Finishes with strong bourbon booziness and more vanilla and oak. Full bodied, low carbonation, smooth and at times syrupy mouthfeel. This beer is a bruiser and delivers exactly as advertised: a big tasty imperial stout that packs an unmatched bourbon punch."
""
""

"O - A very solid imperial stout. Masks the high ABV deliciously well. Recommended to all."
"O - my favorite imperial stout thus far. Beats peche mortel, speedway, and breakfast stout for me."

"Final Thoughts: This one didn't really blow my mind but I didn't have those kind of expectations. It's a very good beer, an Imperial Stout on steroids. Would I drink it again? I can't see myself passing this one up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- great beer. Well done, can't say a bad word. Not the best I've ever had, but it is definitely one that I am glad to have tried, and would be happy to buy another. Even though it was about 6 bucks for a bottle, I would say that comparatively, that is not bad. I've had beers that were not close to being this good for much more"

"All of the aspects that I would expect from a barrel aged stout are there (dark, thick, strong scent and taste of bourbon) but everything is smoother and more enjoyable with this brew. At the first, the taste of bourbon and the strong alcohol hit me pretty hard but as I kept drinking, these things mellowed out and I finished the beer almost feeling like I could have another one. I resisted this urge though as I realize that this beer is for special occasions only."
"Poured into a Three Floyd's Teku glass from a bottle dated 9-17-2012"
"Pours thick black. Very little dark brown head. Leaves quickly with no trace. Big first aroma is of bourbon. Sweet vanilla background in the nose. Taste follows. Sweet, vanilla flavors. Nice dark fruits in the middle. Bourbon flavors add nicely to the flavor throughout. Very smooth, thick in the mouth. Full body. Beer is very easy to drink. Needs to warm up, but great flavors. This is easily one of my favorites."
""
"The actual bourbon characteristics of this beer are quite mellow, but apparent, that this why I really enjoyed this."

"O- wonderful beer one of my top five stouts so glad i got my friend to pick me up a case when in NJ. i will enjoy this beer all winter long."
"As I keep opening bottles the beer gets even better and better. So rich and deep with wonderful flavors. Much like drinking a fine port wine or scotch paired with cigar but transformed into pure liquid gold."

"O: Easy to see why this is such a hyped beer, and it lives up to its reputation. Insanely delicious and complex, this is an amazing sipping beer."
""

"O - This beer is super-hyped, but it's easy to see why. It's a real treat. Complex, deep, strong, interesting, it's a beer you can sit with and get to know for a while, and it keeps giving you more and more. I'm glad I got to share this with my girl, it can easily be split into a couple snifters and enjoyed together!"

"My opinion? Best beer I've ever had. My favorite among them all. There are other great ones, but this out does them all no question to it. KBS and Parabola are up there too on my list of comparable favorites, but they are too subtle about what makes them good. You really need to dig deep with those beer's to describe how great they are. With BCBS, it flat out screams it at you and your tastebuds and provides a strong buzz to boot."
"O - 4.5 - It's a lot smoother and subtler than I expected and not as complex on the palate as I was expecting. I've come to expect a bit more char out of my imperials. I would almost say it is very well balanced at the expense of complexity - everything comes together so well that it's harder to perceive the different layers. It's pretty easy drinking in terms of not being so intense that it makes you put the brakes on, but it does pack a nice wallop on the buzz front. Very nice. 2013 tasting - Fantastic. Even better than when I had it closer to fresh. Such rich brownie chocolate offset by enough booze to stand up to it, with a touch of cherry something, all in a malty baked goods environment. Manages to be subtle and balanced while being so rich. Fantastic."
""
""
""
"O - Glad I tried it, it's an amazing beer, the aroma is amazing. It's a beer I'll get out of the cellar on special occasions, it is that good!"
""
""
"Overall: This beer is a gem, pricey as hell but you would definitely pay more at a bar for worse. At roughly 25 bucks a four pack it is a steal. I am personally not crazing over bourbon stouts but this one is a beast. Salud!"
""
"Overall: An outstanding beer and certainly worthy of the hype and its $24 per 4-pack price. I'm going to cellar the remaining three and see how this develops over the years."
"O: An absolute masterpiece of a beer. The 2008 is drinking so well right now that I think I'll try to keep the other vintages I have for at least 4 years. Beautiful."
""
""
""
""
"D: Having just come back from a 4 day backpacking trip, I would have loved one of these in front of the campfire, i.e. this would be awesome in a can. Definitely a world class beer and definitely one of the best bourbon barrel beers."
"Big, sweet and extremely complex. The 15% abv is expertly hidden. One of the highest rated Imperial Stouts with good reason. If you can find it, buy it."

"Damn it, I hate InBev, but thankfully, it seems their macro influence hasn't touched this masterpiece. I greatly look forward to my remaining bottles! Cheers"

"O-This was a bit sweeter that I expected, but I like my big stouts sweet. This is one of the best that I have ever had based on overall satisfaction with the beer. I would try this again. For sure."
""
""
"O: This is a damn near perfect beer for the style in my opinion, it lives up to the hype by far! The only notch I would take is the bourbon needs to settle down a little, nottheing a little celering won't cure."

"Overall, I think this one lives up to the hype. I think it may be a little over-proofed when compared to KBS and similar options, but it definitely has way more whiskey flavor to it. If you are a bourbon over, this is for you. I think this might be better in a few months when the heat has mellowed out a little bit."
""
"Thanks to Jeff for sharing one of his '08 bottles. Last year to have the white label. God, this stuff was amazing. Bourbon was still strong and robust, but so incredibly smooth. Huge vanilla, chocolate, molasses. Sweet and warming all at once, silky on the palate. Oak notes were lighter but still present. Good reminder of why I love this beer so much."
"Overall - absolutely love this beer, I've enjoyed every variation I've drank, and I'm looking forward to trying older vintages in the future."
""
"D - Does it live up to the hype? Pretty difficult to answer but honestly I would say that super-coated, almost fluffy like mouthfeel is unlike anything I have ever tasted. I had a small sampler of an 08 and certainly don't remember anything like that. Definitely quaffable, a sipper, but dangerously drinkable at 14.5 abv. I would like to pair this with a rich dessert of some kind, maybe raspberry cheesecake or a chocolate tort."

"Overall- Super complex and tasty beer. Definitely the best bourbon aged beer I've ever drank."

"O: An awesome and powerful stout all around, more on the sweet rather than roasty side, which I tend to like (in balance)."
"O - I'm pretty disappointed with how this one tastes right off the bat, particularly in comparison to the previous few years when fresh (2009 - 2011). The way this sits right now, I think I'd prefer to just pour myself a neat couple ounces of Woodford Reserve. I'm not sure if it was the amount of bourbon in the barrels, the type of bourbon used or the base beer, but something happened on this one. I'll be sitting on the rest of my bottles for a while. The next time I get around to opening an older bottle, I'll revisit this review and hopefully do BCBS justice."
"O: damn near perfect for me already and its still fresh. As I stated, I think this one is better than last years fresh and I’m extremely excited to see how this one is going to mature since I just had an ‘11 just a month ago and thought it was freaking amazing. I’ll take this over KBS any day of the week."
""
""
""
"O - The best bourbon stout I've ever had. I am so glad this one lived up to the hype. It's everything I want my bourbon stouts to be; big, bold, rich and bourbon-ey. One hell of an amazing beer. I would be more than happy to seek this one out again. Cheers"

"It was a masterpiece back in 2009, and it continues to be that masterpiece today, only now a more bolder, distinguished version."

"355mL 2008 ed. Consumed with 3+ years of age. Pours with a thick, red head unlike other BCS batches. Small lace. Nose is spectacular: superlative chocolate ganache, walnuts, amaretto, butter pecan, loads of cinnamon, fatty flank steak, banana bread, savory mild soy sauce. Taste is wildly rich and silky with the superlative imperial stout palate: ultra silk, butter reduction, thick and full. In the body, hot chili peppers linger in the finish with mild warming alcohol like a good bourbon or Scotch. Tastes like someone took a really good imperial stout and put it in a red wine reduction to up the intensity and body. Feels like this was made without strike water...as if Bells Expedition was a watered down version of this. Insanely good. 7/11/2011 9/4/9/5/18=4.5"
"O - I am so happy I found 2 more bottles, so I can age this for a year, and the other for 2. I really think this will shine with a year or 2 on it. I have had a 5 year version at Darklord day 2012, but I can't recall the flavor profile, other than that it wasn't boozy at all and some serious depth and complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a deep looking black color with a thin tan head on top that quickly disappears. There is no lacing on this brew either. The smell of the beer has a really nice roasted malt profile with an intense about of barrel aged bourbon-like aromas. The taste is sweet upfront that then switches over to a slightly smoked flavor with a chocolatey bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel of the beer is really smooth, lightly carbonated and goes down really easy. There is a bit of booze heat in there as well. Overall this beer is really nice, glad I finally got to try it."
""
""

"O - great barrel aged stout, a bit boozy on the palate at this point but I'm sure this will ease up with a year or so on it. Glad I finally got the chance to get my hands on this."

"Purchase this beer and write your own post. Amazing."
"Poured dark. Not as viscous as Dark Lord 2012 I had a few months earlier. Picked up caramel, chocolate, coffee, and black cherry. Fantastic beer. Definitely worth the $24 4 pack I paid for. It was similar to Dark Lord 2012 in taste but it was much softer. Dark Lord slaps you in the face with these similar flavors while this was way more gentle and balanced with a great finish. The Dark Lord being harsh could have also had something to do with it being young. Drank 4 months after Dark Lord Day release. Wonderful beer. Would definitely buy more if I find it."
""
"Pours a dark, thick brown, minimal rings of brown bubbles, gone quickly. Whiffs of bourbon, vanilla, coconut, oak, dark bakers chocolate, medium roast espresso beans, faint char - fantastic. All notes from scent present, bourbon the star backed by lots of chocolate notes, oak/vanilla/coconut notes smooth out the taste, coffee and char notes take a back seat, mild fruit pops up. Towards the end, alcohol pops up and not the bourbon kind... not quite harsh, but noted. Full bodied, not as oily or sticky as had expected, minimal carbonation, maybe a splash more needed. Really good beer, imporves as it sits and warms to room temeperature."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Definitely an interesting beer. Made me wish I was outside in the cold sitting next to a bonfire. It will definitely keep you warm on cold nights and tasted so much better as it warmed. Make sure not to drink this cold because you don't want to lose that aroma or bourbon taste."
""
""
""
""
"O: A great beer, not the same balance that the 2011 had but it should age amazingly well. I see this being an extremely sought after vintage in 3-5 years."
"i would buy this all day"

""
""
""
""
""

"O: I'm going to suggest this bottle was a bit over the hill. There's a dominant saltiness which detracts from the proceedings. This is something I have found from time to time in BCS, however, as the first time I ever got my hands on a bottle, I was disgusted by the sodium 'content'."
""
"O- BCS is easily one of the best heavy barrel-aged stouts out there. The fact that it is released annually with fairly wide distribution makes it even better. I hate Supporting ABinBev but I wish I would buy a full case of this every year if possible."

"This is the best non brewery only release BA Stout out there. It is amazing."
""
""
""

"AHHH , pop the cap and inhale the reality of an original."
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: Well, this is my 1st time having this beer, and this one is 3 years old and living up to my expectations in every way. I can't say enough good things about this beer. Goose Island has this barrel-aging thing down without question. If we can start getting this beer locally, I'll be extremely happy. Cheers guys!"

"O: Overall, a great beer with one flaw, way too hot.  I'm curious to see how newer vintages taste, as the ABV on this one is 13% and newer batches is 14.5%, but on reading other's reviews, not many people seem to address it as an issue.  They've obviously made at least some changes to the beer if the ABV went up 1.5%, Im wondering how the changes affected the heat.  But I digress.  As is, this is a great, but IMO not top tier RIS.  In terms of Goose Island offerings, the only other Bourbon County Stout Ive had the pleasure of drinking was the BCB Coffee variety, which I thought was far superior to this one (more flavor complexity, less heat, just better from top to bottom), which is in my top handful of all time favorite stouts (probably #2 behind Pegs Rare DOS).  That being said I would still drink this one any chance I got, and I plan to seek out newer vintages for comparison.  Thanks again Doug! 4.5"

"Bourbon County Stout pours a solid black, with a wispy bit of mocha foam atop the beer. The aroma has equal waves of dark chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon crashing over my nose. I wish the latter was a little bit less intense than the former two though. The flavor profile is a bit more smooth and nuanced. Dark chocolate is intense up front, only to be met by bourbon, vanilla, and some spicy oak notes. Then, some subtle plum and fig dark fruits come in on the finish. The body is full and rich and creamy, everything I'd want from a big, barrel aged imperial stout. The low to middling carbonation completes the luxuriant mouthfeel. Bourbon County Stout is a superb beer, best described as a milkshake for adults. It's also the main reason I'm excited that Goose Island has come to NJ."
"Completely over the top, with way too much bourbon character I suppose.... in other words, exactly what I'm looking for in an RIS. I would order this beer any time I see it on tap at a beer bar."
"This scored a little bit lower than my review from a bottle with ~4 months of time on it. The heat didn't increase but the sweetness did."
""
"BCBS is amazing stuff. I'm sadly now down to my last bottle (one 2010) in my cellar. If only I appreciated this stuff the way I do now a few years back when it was easy to find. Each Vintage is harder and harder to locate in my area. If you haven't tried it, get your hands on a bottle, you won't be disappointed."

"This is perhaps the best beer I have ever had! I was able to snag a 4pk of the 2011 brew from work in Winter 2011 when we only got 1 case of it. Pours a bitch black color with the slightest head. Scent is fantastic as it is rich with bourbon and roasted malts tones. The flavor is amazing! It's rich, creamy, smooth, and chalk full of delicious bourbon flavors. An absolute treat if you can ever get your hands on some!"
"0 - 4.5 - One of my top RIS's for sure."

"Was surprised to see this on tap at a local dive-bar in downtown Baltimore... only $6 and they gave you at least a 12 oz. pour at least (this is compared to a pint of Yuengling going for $5)... quite a steal. Maybe not the best beer to start the night... this one is a doozy and one of the stronger beers I've tried. Yes I know it's 14.5% ABV, but DFH's offerings of this alcohol seem to go down a lot smoother. Anyways... a thick beer reeking of bourbon taste, with a strong alcohol bite. Packs a punch and had some good taste, but just too boozy for my own opinion."

"5) 08 (Seemed slightly oxidized and the bourbon was barely noticeable with the flavors being somewhat muddled)"
""

""
""
"Poured from the bottle, the appearance was jet black and produced a mocha head. It had the thickness of motor oil with the lacing to follow. The nose of this stout might be the best scent I have experienced on a beer. The maltiness and the bourbon somehow morphed into a coconut aroma. I wanted to take a bite out of the glass. The initial taste was a very smooth and sweet chocolate with tart coffee in the background. Also making noise was the vanilla notes produced by the bourbon. The bourbon notes were not as active as I aniticipated. The stout finished with a warming almost sticky aftertaste. This stout was some serious lingering powers."
""
"In a word - superb! What a fantastic beer. Rich and intense, but with brilliant balance - the stout and bourbon flavours blend perfectly without competing for attention. I don't think more needs to be said; if you have the opportunity to try this then don't pass it up! In recent years, barrel-aging has become the latest fad - everyone is doing it. I'd like to see how many contenders can hold a candle to BCBS."

"11 - Lots of bourbon and cacao. Seems to need some time to calm down."

"Quite deserving of it's notoriety, this is perhaps the best bourbon aged stout I've had the priveledge of drinking. I'm sure the 21 months of age helped greatly. Hands down the best extra I've even received in a trade and well worth seeking out. I'm stoked to have a 2011 as well to age a little longer. "
""
""
""
"Overall this is one rich, delicious, decadent beer. Booze is not well hidden at all, but I don't mind that. Bourbon flavor is strong and intense, almost to a fault - in fact the dominance of the bourbon is the reason I can't give it a perfect 5 for taste. And lack of any head detracts from a higher score for appearance. Otherwise, an undeniably delicious beer. Glad I had a chance to try it, will keep my other bottle in the cellar for a couple more years. Or try to at least."

""
"The look on this stout is black, it is really really black. a small amount of foam while the beer was coming to me, but it left by my first sip, leaving nothing but blackness. Smell is big and always the same, every time I have this beer. Rich dark roasted malt, rich bourbon with wood and some char, smoke. The dried fruit comes out with a lot of warming. The smell of Chicago is what I always say. Wow. this beer is big, and bigger from what I can see from the last time I have had it. Bourbon is the winner, vanilla from the oak, molasses out the ass, dried fruit with warming. Traces of smoke. All in all a big ass stout. The alcohol comes out kind of a bit and is felt. Drinking this ponied up at the bar is not the place for this if in big pours, but 4oz's yes. At the house a bottle I would dig on for two three hours or so. The body is big and full and rich and hot. Take your time with this and enjoy."
"Overall this was amazing. Not sure how a fresh batch does, but lay this baby down and you are in for a treat. The flavors definitely compliment each other after some time to get acquainted. Awesome brew!"

"I really love the taste of this beer but in all honesty I don't think I could drink too many of these. The thickness of the sweet malts is to rich for me. It isn't the alcohol but the sweetness that is a bit overwhelming. I thought it had great bourbon taste and a good beer behind that but I felt like I was drinking maple syrup at times."

"This is one of those beers that grabs your senses and doesn't let go. Utterly black...obsidian. The aroma is jarringly intense. It's a mix of booze, wood, whiskey, dark malt, and highly roasted grains. The beer is warming, bitter, and filling. It has a solid and heavy body. Thick and amazingly rich. To be enjoyed slowly."

This is still one of my favorite beers and definitely my favorite of this style especially cellared as it has just melded together like a beautiful masterpiece!

"Sapsuckers in Huntington, NY pours this beer in a brandy snifter glass. Bourbon County Stout beer pours thick with a very dark almost black head. The nose has aromas of bourbon, alcohol, vanilla, and a hint of chocolate. In the mouth this beer has a syrrupy quality that is well balanced. No mistaking the flavors of bourbon, chocolate, and vanilla in this beer. It has subtle flavors of caramel and rum truffle. It goes down smooth with a nice warm toasty feeling in the throat and stomach. This in my opinion is the best beer in America! Period!"
""

"Review from 1/2011 notes. Three year old (2008), properly cellared bottle. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours pitch black, no carbonation, a few lazy bubbles rise at the end of the pour, then dissipate; no lacing. Sweet, dark malt and bourbon aroma. Heavy bodied, delicious bourbon, dark malts, chocolate, molasses. A hint of mint at the end? Complex and absolutely integrated. A masterpiece that has aged into a mellower, well blended beauty. I'm so glad I cellared some of these because this beer hasn't been distributed to Washington for over a year. Bummer."
""
""
"Pours jet black with a thin brown/tan head and pretty significant lacing on the glass. Smell is a wonderful mix of bourbon and chocolate - literally like a bourbon-soaked brownie. It's actually pretty incredible that the aroma isn't very boozy considering how big this beer is. Flavor follows the nose and really takes it to the next level. The bourbon and chocolate flavors really come together perfectly. It's sweet, but not overly so, and it's got a nice little bit of roast in the finish. Very smooth and easy to drink given the ABV. Mouthfeel is very thick and mouth-coating, but still has good carbonation. This is the beer that really taught me that I could love stouts a couple of years ago when I thought stouts weren't for me, so it will always hold a special place in my heart. It's really a phenomenal beer and one that can rarely be beat by other, rarer, harder-to-obtain stouts."
"O: This is a really special beer, one that you want to enjoy but wouldn't want to drink every day - it might just ruin your ability to enjoy lesser beers. It is a great sipping beer and one that I am thoroughly enjoying. Glad that I was able to get an aged version. There is a lot of complexity in the aroma and the taste and it appears that by aging, the harshness of the alcohol has been completely diminished (it is hardly even noticeable)."

""

"I've had several vintages and have yet to be let down. When it gets up to 15% alcohol, it becomes almost a tad bit too thick and viscous for me, but I still love it. To me, this is the epitome of aging beer in wood. You absolutely get the bourbon character but it isn't overpowering. And, the beer is incredibly integrated. I buy bottles whenever I can, but I'll never forget my first experience, which was on tap at Brasserie V in Madison Wisconsin. It was love at first sip!"

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2011 vintage bottled 11/11/2011. Pours viscous pitch black color with a small tan head that fades away to a ring of lace quickly. A fair amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big bourbon, caramel, dark chocolate, toffee, roasted malt, molasses, vanilla, oak, and a touch of herbal, and booze. Damn nice and complex aromas, and hardly boozy at all. Taste of huge dark chocolate, caramel, toffee, bourbon, vanilla, oak, molasses, roasted malt, butterscotch, and a touch of herbal earthiness. Hardly any bitterness noticed on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, chocolate, bourbon, and molasses on the finish for a bit. Fantastic balance of flavors; with absolutely no cloying sweetness. Light-medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a huge creamy and lush mouthfeel as expected. Definitely a sipping beer, but is surprisingly smooth for 14.5%; with only a warming alcohol presence on the finish. Overall this is a phenomenal barrel aged imperial stout. As it warmed up it got much more smooth and complex."

"O: This beer is definitely worth seeking out! It is amazing! I've never had a bourbon aged stout before... This was a treat! I definitely want to get my hands on BCBCS now."
""
""
""
"Overall this is, year after year, one of the best bba stouts you can buy."
""
"All in all, very worthy of its place in the top 100 beers of fame."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Body is fairly heavy, perhaps medium-heavy, with fairly modest carbonation. The combination goes well, giving this a fairly heavy mouthfeel that is still well-flowing across the palate. Alcohol is well felt in the back of throat and in nostrils, but you can't hide 14% I suppose."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Overall, this is a good beer. Very sweet. The 13% abv is non-existent. This is an after dinner sipper. And I will love every sip."
""
""
"Scores are for the fresh bottle only."
""
""
"Overall Impression- An awesome one once again from Goose Island! I definitely enjoyed the B.C.C.S. MUCH more but can't go against this one! Would love to enjoy my other ones but aging them for years to come! Would love to do a vertical of this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - I now see why this beer is a definite must. Cheers!"
""
"The two years in the back of the cellar have done wondrous things to this beer. I've had this beer fresh a number of times, and this was by far the best of the bunch. I'm tempted to drink my last bottle of 2008 now...I don't see how this can get better."
"Overall: It was an honor getting to try this vintage. BCBS has always been a favorite of mine, and while I enjoy fresher bottles, for their ferocity and bourbon focus...the integration of flavors over 5 years has proven to be magnificent. I'd have to say that my vote for favorite BCBS vintage so far, is still the 2008...by that's neither here nor there."
""
""
"O) This beer created a new style in 1992, and it remains world class in 2011. An excellent sipper, I enjoyed this start to finish. I would highly recommend."
""
""
"O: This is a seriously good bourbon barrel stout. I don't know how I've gone all these years without trying it. It's huge and bourbony but well balanced at the same time. Very complex, lots of roasted malt flavors as well as dark fruits and then there's the bourbon characteristics. Taste something different every time I sip."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Prior to this night, I had only had small samples of this beer. And I had only experienced it relatively fresh. With some age, this is nothing short of epic. Bourbon sometimes doesn't work in a beer. With BCBS, it's an essential component."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent. This would be my go-to stout if I lived in the upper midwest."
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty awesome. A huge beer, definitely a sipper. I haven't tried an aged version of this, I think a 2-3 year old bottle would absolutely be amazing. Pretty hot right now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Surprisingly very drinkable right now. The bourbon may seem a bit hot to some but I really enjoy it. I'm glad I have some to cellar and plan on trying one every 6-12 months to see how it evolves."
""
""
""
"If I'm rating the beer & not my tastes, this one has plenty of complex layers, but we all bring our own tastes with us, where ever we go."
""
""
"Overall? Fantastic. My first opportunity to try this and it more than lives up to the hype. An excellent example of barrel aging that compliments rather than overpowers."
""
""
"O: I enjoyed this beer but with the price I paid and with how hot it is I think I might not buy it again in single bottles at $11.50 a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Awesome beer, bourbon doesn't overpower, a lot going on here, wish I had more to cellar"
""
"O: the amazing thing about this beer is that it's not overtaken by the bourbon barrel aging. It takes on flavor, but the flavor complements the stout flavors. A steal at $22/4-pack for this 2011 version."
""
"O: Just from memory, I liked this beer better with a little bit of age on it. I will review it again with a year or two on it and see if my memory serves me right. A very worthwhile bourbon barrel imperial stout. I hope I can pick up a bottle or two of the batch coming out in spring 2012. Goose Island's barrel aging program seemingly never disappoints."
""
"O: This was a wonderful beer to have in between 2010 Coffee and 2010 Rare (which is next). I really enjoyed it, a lot more than I thought I would given the hot smell."
""
""
"O- Absolutely love this beer! At first considered it my new favorite Imperial Stout, but I hate to admit, the closer I got to the bottom of the glass, the molasses began to overpower my taste buds; molasses is a great, but not by itself. But I will have one every opportunity I get!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Search this beer out. It lives up to the hype. The only room for a higher score could be earned by an older vintage bottle I would imagine."
""
""
"Smell is lots of chocolate and vanilla. Really smells amazing. Maybe on the sweet side a tiny bit but still smells great. Touch of booze in the nose but REALLY in the background. Taste is just like the nose. Lots of vanilla and chocolate. A really nice balance with a tiny bit of booze. Really a top tier stout as far as anything I have ever tasted and mouthfeel is thicker than expected which is a great thing. Overall this is a great stout. Glad I was able to pick the 2008 up from a great store this year!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I allowed one of my friends to smell it, not a beer geek friend and he said it smelled like soy sauce. It actually does have that smell too."
"O-First time trying this beer, it was amazing. I'd had Rare, Coffee and Vanilla but not the regular. This is an amazing beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep chocolate brown with no head except for a small ring around the edge of the glass. The smell is a huge kick of bourbon/booze. Mouthfeel is extremely thick with no carbonation/foam. The taste is crazy. There are a ton of levels to this. First I got dark chocolate when it my the tongue, then the boozy oak on the swallow and then roasted coffee on the finish. It was in that order distinctly. There was just a touch of heat on the back in but it dissipated fairly quickly. Overall, I really like this beer a lot but it isnt one that i would put in my top 5, although for sure top 20. It will be interesting to see the progression of this beer. Hopefully in 6 mos it wont be as segmented and the flavors blend a little more."
""
" This beer poors a pitch black with a half finger of tan head. Smell is of heavy bourbon but some nice chocolate as well. Taste is full on chocolatey bourbon, and you can definately taste the alcohol in this beer. Very low carbonation and heavy on the mouthfeel. One of the best bourbon aged beers Ive had."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is our house favorite barrel-aged stout. A big, complex and sweet stout that mellows over time can definitely stand up to cellar-aging and would probably still taste great after another 5 years. World class."
""
""
""
"Overall: What hasn't been said about this beer? It's sublime. This is the most age I've had on a bottle of this, and it's easily the best bottle of it I've ever had. Awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The reveal: Nailed it! '08 BCBS. Thanks Alewatcher! I have a couple of these hanging around and was starting to wonder how they were aging. This was delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Being sure to share a bit with our bartender at Beermongers, we poured this one into a snifter. Color looked black, but was in fact the darkest of browns, with ruby tints, and a bubbly ringlet for a head. Big time bourbon in the aroma, along with scents of roasted malts and semi-sweet chocolate. Huge complexity in the taste, with obvious notes of bourbon-drenched oak up front, accompanied by some alcohol warmth. Mid-palate brought in notes of chocolate-covered cherries, dark malts, vegetal vanilla bean. A huge coffee profile in the finish. Incredibly smooth mouthfeel, full-bodied and robustly chewy. Highly drinkable, and highly recommended...if you can find it."
"O - An excellent barrel aged RIS. As I suspected, this is miles better than my initial review suggested. Glad to have re-reviewed."
""
""
"o- excellent beer that I always wanted to try, so glad I have more bottles of this and now that I've had one I don't think I'll be able to age the two I planned on laying down."
""
"Really nothing not to like about this beer. Quality all the way through. I like what Goose Island is doing here. This one has held up nice, wouldn't mind getting more."
""
""
""
""
"2006: Now this is what I'm talking about! All of the things I love about BCBS are present. GI really hits their stride with this vintage, and you can see that this sets the tone for the vintages to come."
"2014 vintage (14.4%).  Wow, this vintage is fantastic right out of the box!"
"O: 3.5"
""
""
"O: Wow. Re-donk-u-lous. I have had Rare, Coffee, and Vanilla, and this is exactly where all of them came from. Sometimes when variants of a beer are made, you wonder what was done to the original to come up with such a vastly different variation. Not here. This beer is world-class, all on its own. I feel like if I put some fresh vanilla I would get BCBVS, same for the other variants. This is a great beer, extremely well balanced fresh, and will get better with age. Even though it is pricey, I will buy all I can get."
""
""
"Overall an excellent beer I'm very happy I got the privilege to try."
""
""
"Wow! What a full flavored, tasty beer. Definitely a sipper. A great beer to cellar to let the alcohol mellow out a little."
"O: Definitely one of my favorite beers. The barrel aging at its paroxysm !"
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Very well done. I tend to not enjoy the barrel aged beers as much as others. Usually it is because of an overpowering alcohol taste, however, this one balances out the alcohol very well. It is still very rich and a slow drinker; but it is quite complex and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"I have always loved this beer and this year was no exception. Is definitely drinking better fresh than any of the previous years and excited to see how it ages out. Ive probably had more BA stouts than any other category of beer, and other than Rare, I dont think anything beats this years BCS..."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the one that started it all. I had my first BCBS just over 2 years ago and have not looked back. Still one of my top beers."
""
""
"O- As if I haven't said enough.... This is one of the best Barrel Aged Stouts ever. I will seek and consume every chance I get. I feel like this one in two years will be arguably one of the best of it's kind."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: wow, this is one of the most serious sipping stouts ive ever had. i really couldnt imagine having 2 of these back to back. little too much for my palate. but as far as 1 is concerned, i am loving this. big time flavor meets bourbon. beautiful match. glad i got another to put away for a while!"
""
""
"O: Wow, this is without doubt one of the best Bourbon Barrel Stouts I've ever had, if not the absolute best! So complex but everything works together so well. It's just incredible! High ABV is masked by chocolate that makes this beer almost too easy to drink, given its alcoholic strength."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It’s hard to believe that it took me this long to try this brew, even though I have tasted both the Coffee version and the Rare. It is by far the most bourbon laced of any barrel aged stout I have tried, but it seems well engineered to hold up to the barrel aging. This is a decadent sipper of a beer and I am looking forward to trying the other bottle with some age on it."
"Massive bourbon bomb of a stout, super delicious and one that should be a rare treat."
"O: Fantastic. I consider this the reference BA stout. Big, slightly boozy, and rich BA stout with fantastic flavors. Definitely a sipper which is best enjoyed in smallish quantities, because it can be challenging to drink beyond a half bottle."
"O: Love this beer! Glad I have so much of it. Such a great cellar candidate"
"O- have not had 08' but this is drinking very well right now."
"Overall, a big boozy stout that doesn't apologize for anything. Really good, but maybe not as good as the price is demands."
""
"I normally prefer this one with a bit of age on it, but it's still magnificent fresh. I've had very few beers that were this thick without being overly sweet. The bourbon is definitely present, but more smooth than stinging alcohol heat."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nice beer, just not as good as the rare and the coffee."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours pitch black with a small brown head. The foam dissipates leaving a thin tan ring. The nose offers huge notes of vanilla, bourbon and roasted malt. Taste opens with bourbon flavors, very well integrated and not overwhelming at all. A sweet, roasted malt backbone makes an entrance mid-palate. Vanilla and oak are present in copious amounts, throughout. The finish really shines with smooth, velvety layers of roasted malt, chocolate and hints of coffee. Feel is thick and viscous with a low level of carbonation which lends a creamy quality to the beer. Overall this is a fantastic beer. Incredible bourbon flavors melded with great vanilla and oak characteristics make this a joy to imbibe. Not hot or overdone, it very easy drinking and enjoyable. Recommended."
""
"650 ml bottle. 2009 vintage. Pours a dark black with a small tan head that settles to a ring and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is big chocolate brownie, bourbon, vanilla, a lot of alcohol, and some roast. The aroma is sweet and boozy. The initial taste is sweet brownie. Then some roast, booze, bourbon, and a bit of vanilla. The finish is really boozy with some bitterness and has a warming feeling. Full bodied with low carbonation. I did not find this very enjoyable. It is cloyingly sweet and extremely boozy, even two years after bottling. I found the sweetness to overwhelm the other flavors present. Drinking more than an ounce or two is a chore."
"EDIT 12/26/12: OK, I've had enough of this beer now to reconsider my ratings. Still a wildman in terms of bourbon, but a rock solid A beer."
""
""
"Overall: I feel incredibly lucky to have been able to find this beer. I had never had BCBS before, and can't seem to find it fresh, so I can't compare the difference which sucks. This is the best beer I have ever had bar none. It has raised my expectations of what a ""big"" beer can be. It is both amazingly flavorful and artfully constructed."
""
""
""
"O - Great bourbon stout. Very complex. Not as hot as I thought it would be since it was bottled 6 weeks ago. Can't wait to try another one with some age on it."
""
""
"O: A rare after Christmas treat! I'm giving this beer a 4.5 rating overall. I feel the bourbon undertones almost overpower the stout nature. Not really. A great beer, please, please seek this one out."
""
"2009 Vintage scores: A:4 S:3.5 T:3.5 M:3.5 O:3.5 = Overall rating of 3.53"
""
"O- incredibly well balanced for a 14.5% stout. Love this beer."
""
"Mouthfeel is thick, chew, viscous. This is an excellent example of barrel-aging done right. The bourbon and base beer form a nice harmony of flavors, adding numerous layers of complexity. One of the better bourbon barrel beers I've had."
"Overall: Great and Amazing beer. A must for most beer people. If you get your hands on this, whatever vintage it is, you can age it and have at a later date to get different notes."
""
"This might be the 1st beer I can say this about, but to experience it you must drink it. It has quickly met the hype and will be in my thoughts and taster's memory for some time to come. It poured a very dark brown and opaque, a very short reddish tan head. So many different smells: bourbon, raisins, chocolate milk, malt, cherry, cinnamon. Wow-uh-yeah, this stuff delivers all the same and more on taste and pours down the throat like a milk shake. heavy, but not too much so. I can see vanilla work really well in this and coffee for sure. This is one more reason I am sad I left Chicago, but NYC still has a few places which carry it."
"Full body and silky on the tongue, minimum carbonation, though enough to lightly taunt your tongue. Sticky lingering flavors of chocolate and bourbon on a long finish. Definitely a sipper as this is a very flavorful beer."
"O: Really well done beer by GI. Can't wait to see how this one develops over the years."
"O: A thick and complex alcoholic beverage that is full of flavour."
""
"2009. Poured very aggressive into a 20 oz giant Duvel Tulip. Pours so black, with a huge 3 inch mocha head that settles quickly into a tan film, with no lace at all, but not surprising. Smell is Bourbon, burnt coffee, dark chocolate, smoke, and some licorice. Taste is all of those things with Bourbon being dominant, but not in a bad way. Body is big, but not insane. Good amount of life for it's size and it is a supper that should be cherished. It is amazing how much you look forward to the next sip and you realize that this beer would scare the shit out of the average beer drinker. Such a memorable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- One of the best barrel-aged stouts I've had. I haven't been able to try this one until this year, but now I'll be seeking it out every chance I get. I think I need to do a side-by-side with Parabola as well."
""
"Overall: I'm pretty sure it willl be a while before I taste another imp stout this good. Two more bottles left in the cellar, someone zap my brain so that I can forget they are there. I wish I hadn't drank the bottle so darn fast. I'm sitting here just sniffing my glass contemplating whether I should crack another one. I'd be willing to sell my soul for a case of this stuff. The glass is empty and I'm still sticking my nose in it. Definitely need to sip this and savor every drop."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If you see it, buy it. Hang onto it. I have three left. Want to let them age, but I really want another one too!"
""
"Wow....this is one stellar friggin beer. 2011 vintage. Poured out black as night with a head that was tinged an interesting reddish color. It fizzled out very quickly and left no lacing at all. This is liquid cherry cordial on the nose, with just a tad of vanilla. The booze is definitely hanging out behind everything else, but so so so muted. A bit woody as well. Taste follows nose, with a quick blast of the cherry cordial. Again, the abv is there but is hidden beautifully. Surprising amount of snap on the carbonation, but it doesn't impact the mouthfeel at all. Syrupy but not in a bad way. This is a sipper, and it will slam you, but it is truly fine. Glad I have another bottle poised and ready for Christmas Eve. Thank God AB Inbev isn't fucking up Goose Island....yet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, super stoked that I got my hands on a four pack of this stuff. Incredible flavor, big and boozy, and I loved every second of it. Can't wait to see how the other three bottles mature over the next few years. Props to Beertopia in Omaha for keeping everybody update with their weekly email newsletter when this went on sale."
""
""
""
"O - Very nice, coast the chest and warms me up."
""
"O: Fantastic beer, for the abv it is surprisingly easy to drink. Great flavor profile."
""
""
""
""
"This is a giant, and takes a while to get your mind and palate around. Better to actually treat it like a bourbon. I don't think I like it as much as everyone else - too hot and too woody - but it is fairly epic."
"Overall, this high up there with some of the best bourbon barrel aged beers I've had the pleasure of trying so far in my young beer career, if you will. Don't quite know if it's the best I've had, I'd have to do some serious side by side by side by side by side tasting to determine that. Let's just say this is one superb, world-class beer that everyone really should try. From what I remember of the last time I had this 2009 vintage, this beer is aging wonderful and just seems to grow more and more complex as it ages. Can't wait to have some 10 or 11. I didn't look back at the first review before this one and the only discrepancy between the two came in the overall rating where I gave it a 5.0 in the first review and a 4.5 here. I think here it's really more deserving of a 5.0 overall score, so that's what I'm going with."
"O- I have had BCBS at various times, and always in very small quantities. This was the first time I ever sought it out. I definitely enjoy it, but for me not the best of bourbon stouts available. If you haven't had it, well you should!"
""
""
""
""
""
"[99/100]"
""
""

"O) Great beer going to save the remaining 2008's for a few more years."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cost: $5.99 for a single 12 oz bottle or $21.99 for a four pack (if you are luck enough to find a store that will sell you four at the four pack price). Alternatively, if you are like me, you might have even paid $45+ for three of them because Chicago was otherwise sold out and you really, REALLY wanted to get your hands on some. Certainly worth buying at least one -- even if you have to pay the profiteering rate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Edit: 2011 version with a few months of age on it. Absolutely beautiful. I went back and changed the mouthfeel to a 5. This beer is truly fantastic. The taste is verging on a 5... I'd give it a 4.75 if I could. The faint hops and coconut really do it for me. Truly great."
""
"O: This is beer is close to perfection. Goose Island really knows how to use barrels. Every beer from this series is absolutely amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Goose Island BCBS is worth every ounce of the hype. At 14.5%, this one is a bruiser, but it is surprisingly smooth right now. That being said, I think age can only help this beer. If you can, grab two. One for now, one for later. Unbelievably delicious, and beats out KBS by just a hair, in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"This is my first taste of the bcbs line, and as much praise as it got I was actually expecting to be let down. Just the opposite! This beer had deep bourbon flavors yet was so smooth and drinkable I almost couldn't believe it. Totally lived up to its reputation!"
"O-I can't really say much about this beer that hasn't already been said.Highly acclaimed and worthy of it."
""
""
"O- superb stout was lucky to find a 2008 for sale and enjoyed this one immensly"
""
""
"The big take away from this beer is that bourbon is there, but it does not rely on the bourbon character to make this beer the monster that it is. Happy drinking!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall, i now remember why this is consistantly one of my favorite beers. just a monster beer from start to finish. I wish it still had the high availability that it used to, but i guess thats what happens when you make such a great brew."
""
"O/D - Amazingly drinkable for the ABV. As soon as I was done I wanted another. The beer lacks a bit in appearance, but more than makes up for it in smell, taste and feel. The bourbon in this beer is up front and in your face, but the associated flavor, smell and warmth all pleasantly accentuate the beer. Get some."
""
""
"O: One of the best beers I’ve ever had. 2009 version didn’t impress me but that could be because I hadn’t had as much experience with beer when I drank it in 2010. This one’s a year old and nothing short of amazing. A+"
"Delicious beer, I'd order it again anytime. Not necessarily the greatest bourbon barrel stout I've ever had but memorable and delicious"

""
""
""

""

"If you happen to find this beer available, it's a must-try. Sock away a few for a vertical of you can refrain from drinking them long enough. Even fresh, the flavor profile is intense enough to support the massive alcohol content, which should only mellow with age. A very complex and delicious brew in both aroma and flavor that rivals the best imperial stouts in the world. With a couple years of age to tame the alcohol, its score would only improve."
""
""
""
"Overall: Great mouthfeel! I loved how smooth it was and how I could just hang out and sip on it. Well balanced especially for the ABV. Cheers!"
""
"This lives up to its reputation easily. The four-pack price is steep, but I could easily share each bottle and drink it as a nightcap. I'm looking forward to another future splurge."
""
""
""
""
""
"I've taken you for granted all these years. Sorry old buddy."
"O: An intense beer for sure. I remember being impressed with this last year, but unfortunately did not buy any for aging. Was lucky to get 10 bottles today and most of those are going to cellar for a year or more. May update this later with notes on aging and vintages, but for now, suffice it to say this is worth the hype."

"O: This was my very first bourbon-barrel aged imperial stout a couple years ago and it blew me away back then. I've had many other bourbon-barrel aged-beers but this one's still my favorite. I remember I could just go to the store and buy this beer whenever I was in the mood for it for months after the 2009 release came out. This time, I was lucky to get ONE 12-oz bottle a few days after the 2011 release. Ah, how times change..."

"Well, I've had some now over the last couple of months, and I'm reviewing an 08 version. Had younger ones, but time is on the side of this drink, so I'll keep off the younger versions and stick to the aged ones. 3 years old and the bourbon mellowed down perfectly into a balanced stout, very good example of its style. Only hints of how boozy this one once was. So preferably drink aged versions is my best advice for this one"

"Overall, I was really happy with all vintages for different reasons. This 2009 was probably my favorite. I like that I got a lot of toffee and caramel notes. Very pleasant. I want another tasting ASAP."
"One of the best beers I have had. Wish it was more available."
"mouthfeel - a bit sugary, a bit thin, carbonation is fine"
"bottled on 10/15/10, this beer poures into a goblet as dark brown as it could be without being black. no head to speak of, just a thin mocha colored film across the top that's gone just as easy as it came. first and foremost on the nose is bourbon followed quickly by chocolate some caramel and a hint of vanilla. a big punch of bourbon flavor is the first to greet the taste buds, then more of that chocolate. also greeted with tastes of caramel, malts, toffee and vanilla. mouthfeel is that of a thick body with low level of carbonation. pretty sticky and sweet with a long warm good by. this is a classic that everyone should have the pleasure of enjoying."
"O- 4 years seems to be too much age....3 might be a little better. Regardless, it's fantastic"
"This is a fantastic beer. I think it is best with 4-5 years of age on it. At 2 or 3 years it is still a little hot, older it starts to fall off. The 2007 and 2008 are spot on right now."
"Overall: Just an exceptional beer and I will be looking to pick up as much of this as I possible can."
"Overall - A very fine bourbon aged stout, not the best i have ever had but definitely up there. Would love to try this one with some age on it in the bottle. Oh wait, i just traded for a 2007 bottle, zing!"
"This has aged fantastically. I didn't take notes when I had this vintage 2 years ago, but I'm sure that it tastes way better now. The apparent loss of carbonation actually helped turn this into a decadent, boozy masterpiece. Well done."
"O: A true pleasure, can't wait to try the other varieties of this stout. Thank you Goose Island, loved your beer."
"Cheers!"
"This is a major player of a beer that demands a slow sipping to fully appreciate and not be overwhelmed by its strength! Definitely an exceptional beer, although was a bit too much for me. I want to try a fresh version and see how it compares to this 1-year old sample."
"overall it was a very nice sipper."
"12oz bottle of 05-09 had one oevery year and on tap sevral time. One of the all time best brews. . Pours pitch black with a 1 finger head that dissipates into a nice ring clinging onto my glass. Aroma of bourbon, oak and some vanilla. Taste follows the nose, still a bit hot but not in a bad way. Alcohol is there but doesn't hit till the end of the taste. Thick yet smooth, this is one great stout!"
"O: This beer has aged fantastically, the bourbon flavor has faded quite a bit but the other flavors imparted from the barrel aging are still present. Very little could be done to improve this beer. Dangerously drinkable for a beer of this size, perfect to drink as the days are getting shorter and much colder."
"O: This is a great beer out of the gates, and three years later. As it ages, the bourbon begins to blend in more with the malts, barley and chocolate, but make no mistake, it is still a dominant aroma and flavor. I personally don't like bourbon, but this beer is heaven in a bottle. I've had a bottle daily for the past 10 days, and look forward to tomorrow when I can crack open another. One beer that truly gets better with each sip!"
"o 3.5 as much as I liked bcbs the first time, by the end of the second bottle (on a diff day) I was feeling overwhelmed by licorice."
"For the beer line up of this tasting, please see my review of the Black Tuesday from the Brewery."
"Overall, my score doesn't necessarily reflect this bottle, but a conglomeration of all the previous bottles I've had. This vintage is a bit sweet and light on the bourbon taste. Of all the vintages I've had, this is by far the sweetest. Thanks to merc7186 for this extra."
"Cheers..."
"Overall - This is one of those beers where the taste is so good that it outweighs the flaws of the rest of the beer. It's boozy and it looks the lower side of mediocre, but it tastes amazing."
"Even more than KBS this beer made me miss the States. Knowing it will be a long time before I can try to get more beers even similar to this is the only down side to this beer. Well done Goose Island!"
"D/O: It would be easy to gently compliment this beer and move on if it did not represent such a pivotal contribution to the craft beer world. This particular time capsule from 2006 was brewed at a time when spirit-infused and wood-aged beers were almost unheard of, yet it holds its own with the contemporaries of today. The smell is swoon-worthy, delivering some really remarkable dark chocolate even five years on. Other qualities are not as noteworthy, but the predictable flavors are still pleasant enough. It is kind to the palate, with an appropriate amount of spirit coming through in the taste without being hot or fatiguing. While it was a long time in coming, this one was worth the wait."
"I hope the Vanilla, Coffee, and Rare I have all turn out for the better!"
"February 2012 Edit of the 2011 batch. Awesome rich brownie nose, gooey, super well integrated bourbon barrel. Near Rare in terms of decadence and quality on the nose. Mouth is rich, gooey chocolate brownie, silky feel. Perhaps a touch drier and less intense on the finish than Rare. Fantastic batch, easily the best bottle of this I've had, though I haven't had a lot. Raising my score a bunch."
"O - I'm not sure what else to say. Everyone has to try this beer at least once in their life. Here in Texas we don't get this beer, so I look forward to try the other bottles in my cellar. I'm not sure what it tastes like fresh, but I imagine that a year of aging did this beer some good. It might be too overpowering fresh (but just a guess). Best beer I've had to date."
"O - Loved this on draft, liked it alot in bottles. At least for now GI has not been screwed by the A-B takeover. For those who like bourbon or monster stouts this is a must try. Also a great curiosity beer for craft newbies."
"Pours pitch black with a nice fluffy brown head. Smell is bourbon vanilla, some chocolate, very interesting aromas. Taste is not as much bourbon as in the nose, vanilla and toffee, tootsie roll chocolate dominates. Very good flavor. Mouthfeel is thick and balance is great. Fantastic beer, and well worth aging- the bourbon mellows out perfectly with time!"
"I don't think I've had another BA stout that had this much time on it, and this one has held up quite well. I kinda wished I had held onto it and tried it as part of a vertical, but since the wife and I both love the BCSes, they tend to not stay in our cellar for very long. One of the best BA stouts out there, IMHO!!"
"O- A nice BIG beer. Not my favorite barrel aged stout but definitely a quality one. I feel like the heat from the ABV was a bit overwhelming. I have a feeling this one will most definitely age well."
"O - Very good beer. Recommend aging for a while."
"0-Very good beer. Must have more!"
"O: This beer is classic. It's signature flavor is so memorable yet so new and expansively complex every time I drink it. It's a world-class pioneer of the style and doesn't falter in continuing to set the standard. I sipped 6 ounces of this as a dessert beer for over 40 minutes and each one was a pleasure."
"Big thanks to BA BanditBrewingCo for the sample. 12 oz. twist-off longneck, bottled 11/12/09. Brewed with two-row, Munich, chocolate, caramel, roasted, and debittered black malts; hopped to 60 IBUs with Willamette and aged in a bourbon barrel. No sound upon opening - hope it's carbonated. Pours black with just a hint of tan collar and no hope of lacing or head retention at this ABV. Very aromatic, with vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, caramel, toffee, dark fruits, stewed raisins/prunes and perhaps some minty rye from the bourbon. Excellent, but I wish it had a bit more stout character. It is in fact carbonated, and tastes very rich, a little sweet, with notes of burnt caramel, milk chocolate, vanilla, maple syrup, bourbon, spicy oak, peppery ethanol, blackberries, black cherries and raisins. You can just barely find the stout beneath, but it yields roast, dark chocolate and a moderate bitterness. Very thick and viscous on the tongue, lightly-carbonated, quite drying, tannic?, chewy and almost syrupy with a long finish. Even after two hours and nearly flat, the mouthfeel is still fine. Very highly-concentrated and quite complex, with lots of bourbon (wet barrel?) and an effortless drinkability. Almost more bourbon than stout, but this is a wonderful beer that deserves its reputation and could probably age for a decade or more."
"For me, this beer was almost the opposite of what I was expecting. I think before this beer hits the bourbon barrels it needs a bit more of a polished and refined base beer to withstand the test of time. Hopefully these bottles will mellow out their sweetness over time, and luckily I have one left to test this theory. For me as this sits now, it's overly sweet and just a bit messy."
"O - top 5 beers I've ever had. more hops bitterness would be nice in the smell and taste. I can't imagine a more perfect looking or feeling beer however."
"Velvety mouthfeel. A bit boozy but still delicious. Looking forward to seeing how the others in the cellar age."
"Damn. One of the best beers I've had in a long time. Near perfect. Jet black with a dense creamy head. Very soft with low carbonation. Bourbon oaky aroma. Rich body. The flavor starts with a bourbon like quality and finishes with dried fruit and vanilla. The alcohol is very well disguised. If any negative can be said about it (and it's only a slight knock) is that it's a bit toward the sweet side. However, this makes it the perfect after dinner beverage."
"This is very tasty and complex, but the alcohol is not hidden at all!! Awesome sipping beer that gets better with age!"
"O - For a six month old beer this is drinking really damn well. I think I prefer it with a year or two on it though. The flavors seem to meld together a bit more which helps with the intense boozy bourbon notes. The '09 having only 13% abv also helps its cause a bit. 4.5/5"
"[Edit: LOL on this old review]"
"Pours an opaque black with a 1 inch khaki head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Random spots and streaks of lace slide back down into the remaining beer. Smell is of wood, vanilla, toasted coconut, and milk chocolate. Taste is of toasted coconut, vanilla, wood, and semi-sweet cocoa powder. There is a slight alcohol burn in the back of the throat with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a thick and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a most excellent beer and I can see why this one is held in such high regard. A rare treat for me that I am glad I got to try."
"Overall: Give me more of this! I am always ISO and am so glad I will be moving to an area that sees Goose Island distribution in a week. I love this beer and consider it to be the perfect sipper. As I am also trying to get into bourbon I feel that this beer encompases the flavors perfectly where the beer still stands on is own but the bourbon and oak just add another layer of flavor."
"I poured the Bourbon County Stout (BCS) into a large snifter type glass to help bring out all of the aromas and wow did it ever! The brew poured a thick jet black with just a slight 1 finger head, even with an aggressive pour. There was just a trace of lacing on the glass that didn't stick around long. That's fairly typical of an aged impy stout in my experience."
"O- I’ve had the more recent vintages of this beer and was impressed, but with drinking the 08 I am blown away, I love this beer, only wish I had more of the 08, one of the best Barrel aged stouts I’ve had."
"This is a fantastic beer. It isn't perfectly balanced, but the flavors it delivers are remarkable."
"Overall, while I think this is one of the more astounding beers I've ever tasted, I do recognize that only the most hardy of beer-drinkers could appreciate the result. Buyer beware, then: if you think Guinness is borderline, this is definitely not the drink for you. But if you seek the thickest, darkest, mealiest, most flavorful stout on the planet, you have a shot at a contender with this one."
"O: Wow. I saved this for my 100th review and I'm glad I did. I'm so glad the bourbon held up  and I'm glad there was still a whirlwind of flavor after the last 3 years. This is definitely a sipping beer, no questions asked, and  A must for any fan of BA stouts.  "
"O I really really wanted to like this on account that I have a rare that I still need to pop open, but it was really hard for me to enjoy this. The Bourbon flavor was just to much for me. Probably needed to cellar it for another year or two."
"Overall, this is a fantastic brew. My only hope for the future of this beer is distribution in Florida."
"O: a great brew, paired well with a cigar as the label suggested."
"As bourbon aged stouts go, I can't imagine anything more authentic than this. I'm glad I could try this beer, see what the hype is all about, ponder its significance in the beer industry/community. And I will never buy it again."
"O- One of the best stouts I've had... and best beers I've had. Get it."
"The mouthfeel is a little heavy but still not as thick as some."
"I truly regret not stocking up on this beer when it was readily available in Boston. This beer - and more specifically, this vintage - merits the praise it garners. Phenomenal."
"D: Thick with a booziness that warms the belly. One bottle is quite enjoyable, but not one I would want multiple pours of because of its satisfying nature. Well done Goose Island!"
"O: Up with the best beers I've ever had. I love butterscotch. When Podunkparte told me butterscotch I was like ""no way", but sure enough, like sucking on a worthers original! Get this beer if you can!"
"O - Only disappointment is the head died too quick, but that doesn't detract for this A+ beer."
"A sipper in every sense of the word. An absolute treat. A revelation. A journey. A masterpiece."
"O: This beer is the work of a fine brew-smith. This is a complicated beer review. It is a unique brew that could be mistaken for a monotonous one. The mouth and flavor synchronization makes for a memorable savory experience that I hope is not lost on too many drinkers. Give credit to the brewers of this beer as you would the chefs of fine restaurants, and be sure to tip well."
"O: Overall I love this beer - I have had it on several occasions but hadn't reviewed it untill opening one tonight, I really enjoy the thickness and the way it coats the tounge also the way it leaves and oilslick type webbing as it lowers ,as the beer warms the flavors just explode, It's sticky sweet and every sip makes you want another one - One of the only beers I have ever had that makes me want to lick the glass after it's empty. I need more."
"Overall: The age has smoothed this beer out even more. The balance is fantastic and I will definitely have more in the future."
"Narrative: “TELL US WHERE YOU HID THE BODY!” Sargeant Myers slammed his fist down on the cast aluminum table shaking Raven Moonclaw’s glass of water. “The body, my dear sargeant, is a part of what Aristoteleans call ‘the Aether’ and as a skilled ilusionist, I can never reveal my secrets.” He produced from thin air a Capri slim and ignited it spontaneously, despite being searched top to bottom upon booking. “You see my dear corporal, the line between menace and altruist is murkily unclear” with a swift slight of hand he transformed his Capri cigarette into an ebony gecko. “WHAT THE-” Sargeant Myers staggered back wiping his brow. “The problem with ethics and illusionists is the code of secrecy, for how can an objective ethical code exists without parameters of repentance or accountability, my good enforcer?” The handcuffs clicked and shattered into sixlet candies onto the floor. “I myself do not detest the wicked, but merely embrace the sweet for the fleeting moments I am-” a black clod of smoke appeared and the final resonating words filled the interrogation room: “BEHOLDEN.”"
"O: If they aimed to capture Bourbon character in a stout and smooth it with beer qualities and add a little spice, they have done a great job with this beer. It's perhaps unfair that I've tried this after many other bourbon barrel aged stouts when it is one of the more original ones in the timeline, but I have a hard time getting excited over this given the great many other stouts that emphasize the bourbon and ride its beerified glory. Wish it would go further beyond its barrel, but still undoubtedly an incredibly delicious stout with beautifully integrated flavors."
"O: This is a really complex and tasty imperial stout. Not overly boozy as it is masked by the bourbon flavors. This is a must try for almost any craft beer enthusiast."
"O: Still a fantastic beer and one of my favorites, but I think I let my mind run away with me after the last tasting and built this beer up to mythic levels. It's top notch, for sure, and I'll be seeking out more; it's just not the nectar of the gods I thought it was."
"very enjoyable beer. stands up to my favorite of the type, the rasputin anniversary, but does not surpass. excellent beer."
"O- A fantastic beer. Really been looking forward to this and it lived up to expectations. Very easy to drink. Will be buying this regularly when I can."
"O: Overall, this is a beer for a cold night, break on a cross-country ski tour, hot tub, cigar, or a mid-morning watching one of my dogs with two torn ACL's, which I have enjoyed all of the above, unfortunately I am watching one of my six dogs now with a busted leg and this brew makes the warm, sunny day spent inside a bit better. But the beer has a very good way of hiding the ABV and the flavor characteristics give it a reason to go back. Looking forward to seeing how these hold up in the cellar and how they taste passed the four year mark.) Cheers!"
"O: An amazing beer. Lots of sweetness, a fair amount of bourbon, chocolate and very drinkable at 13%."
"Update #2: The Fall 2012 batch of BCBS is utterly fantastic. Now @ 15%, it's as well-balanced as it's ever been. Easily bests KBS. Would probably put it around a 4.70."
"Overall I enjoyed this much more a few months back fresh and on tap. Maybe the vintages have become more mellow since 2008 or was just a heavy/new barrel they were using back then."
"11/11/2014 - Had a 2008 bottle last night (thanks Lurkaholic!!) and it was much different from the more recent ones I've had. Bourbon is very subtle, everything's integrated nicely and don't remember any bad oxidation flavours, maybe a tiny bit of sherry in a good way. Really nice stuff, will be aging bottles for many years based on this."
"Poured from 12oz (2010 vintage) bottle into a snifter glass. Pours a super thick oil black with a thin light brown head that leaves a very thin collar of light brown lace throughout the drinking session. The nose is cocoa, coffee, vanilla and oak bourbon, some nutty oxidation, and an warming alcohol burn. The flavor starts off with the lightly sweet vanilla, light cinnamon, and caramel bourbon, moving to chocolate, creamy coffee, molasses, and some nuttiness. The body is huge, thick, and viscous and sticky with very light carbonation, and a long bitter alcoholic finish that also features flavors of coffee, bourbon, cinnamon, and vanilla. Was looking forward to trying this one - this is a complex beer within itself. I look forward to trying the 2007-2009 vertical and Rare that I have in my cellar in the near future."
"And 13%? really? this is dangerous..."
"Poured into my bruery snifter. 2009 vintage. Pours pitch black with a 1 finger head that dissipates into a nice ring clinging onto my glass. Aroma of bourbon, oak and some vanilla. Taste follows the nose, still a bit hot but not in a bad way. Alcohol is there but doesn't hit till the end of the taste. Thick yet smooth, this is one great stout!"
"Again, a huge thanks to jbck109 for the generous extra!"
"O- Simply put, I was blown away by this vintage. Any gripes people have with this beer being ""hot"" and not very good can be laid to rest with this vintage, obviously. Almost 4 years in the bottle have done wonders to this. There is not a trace of alcohol in this beer, with only the full flavors and subtle heat of bourbon and slight oak remaining to tell you this was aged in a barrel. Smooth beyond reason, I could easily knock back a few of these before noticing the alcohol. I'm so glad a have a bunch of these left to savor over the coming months and years. If this is any indication of what Rare is like, I'm in for a treat when I open that bottle. A fine example of a nearly perfect -bal beer. Well done."
"Obviously a sipping beer leaves a wonderful aftertaste that allows me to savor a small amount for a long time."
"A phenomenal brew. Nice and chewy, but still velvety smooth. A touch hot for me but a perfect special occasion brew. I can't wait to see what a couple more years do to this guy."
"O – This is an amazing beer right now. Get as much as you can because it may not be around forever."
"EDIT: The above was done when I was just getting back into craft. I don't think this beer is so unique anymore. I have had it numerous times now out of bottles and prefer the bottles I've had to the growler. The bottles I've enjoyed had much more alcohol warmth and more pronounced roasty flavors (more coffee and dark chocolate) than the growler. They also weren't nearly as sweet. Ratings adjusted 4/5/13."
"Took me a couple of tries but I finally came around to this beer. Now one of my favorite bourbon beers. Definitely has the typical imp stout flavors, choc, coffee, roastedness, and certainly molasses in the aftertaste. Definitely one of the more bourbon-y stouts out there."
"After a long day at work this was definately a nice way to start the weekend. Enjoy!!!"
"O - The 09 is doing really well and is on it's way to being a super duper fabulous beer. While the alcohol heat has mellowed very well, I'm still feeling it in a little in my lips and in the back of my throat, like a little reminder to not fuck with this beer. This beer is so good that I feel like I have to wait until I have an occasion to open one."
"3.5/4/4.5/4/4"
"Props to BarryMFBurton for trading this to me. 09 version. Popped the top and wow, big bourbon smell. Poured dark black with a nice fluffy quarter inch head. Massive amounts of chocolate taste at first, followed by malt, and when I swallow is when the bourbon just ran me over, which I loved. After that is when the coffee hit my pallet and lingered for a long long time. Awesome balance. Having the bourbon at the finish really lets the other flavors come out and be noticed in the beginning. Such a creamy mouthfeel. Nicely carbonated, but not overdone. ""Wow"" is all I can say about this beer. I was blown away."
"O: This is definitely a great beer – no doubt about that. Whether I’m going to seek it out again is still to be determined. It was one of those experiences where I loved it for one minute, and then I was just ok with it for another. I don’t think I liked it consistently enough to spend the money on it again. It has the fine elements that I expected out of a barreled-aged stout, but still had that artificial twang that I’ve come to expect from Goose Island. My next pursuit will probably be the BCBCS, which has a strong coffee flavor that I’m hoping will overpower the sad syrup notes that I didn’t like very much. All in all, though, Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout gives a strong impression of passionate brewing, even if the execution is somewhat poor in a few key areas."
"O- All around happy drinking from Goose Island. This is a disarmingly accessible offering for even the meekest of stout lovers, pending a reasonable tolerance for alcohol and some oaky resonance."
"The carbonation is more feelable in the mouth than the vanilla version. A very well balanced beer."
"O: Its still fantastic but I am just not too excited about how it has aged. I know that I like BCS with about 1 -1.75 years on it. No more."
"A Two Hearted is a great chaser."
"**Updated my score on a few notes. Having recently had another bottle from 2008 with further aging on it has blown my mind. If you have 2008 bottles I think this has really peaked currently. This recent bottle that was opened was the best example and year of this brew I have ever had!**"
"O- Overall this is a fantastic brew. I dont even want to drink my other bottles, I just want to put a fancy black dress on it and wisper sweet nothings in its ear... then put it on the corner to make me some money! Very Tasty!"
"O - Fantastic base beer to start. Love this stuff. Always will be looking for more!"
"O: This was really really good and everything I expected and more. It sure as hell doesn't have a good drinkability though. Still, the biggest imperial stout I had."
"Overall I e always adored this beer and sought it out. This batch, though, wasn't refined enough for me and lacked the balance I've experienced in the past. Great but not exceptional."
"O-Too much like a whiskey and not enough like an Imperial stout. I prefer Founders version. It seems like you have to be a whiskey drinker to really appreciate this one."
"O- Really good. tastes great. I'm gonna pick up another to let sit for a while."
"Pours a think murky black with a decent head, that dissipates quite quickly. It reeks of bourbon, malt, a tiny bit of licorice, and I also got a hint of black pepper. It tastes excellent. Excellent amount of bourbon, excellent amount of malt, excellent amount of chocolate, just excellent. AFter drinking, an oily sheath of BCS is left on the tongue, to enjoy for the next 30 minutes or so. The taste doesn't leave your mouth, and trust me, you don't want it to. In terms of drinkability, the freshest i've had has been a 2010 bottle, and it was extremely drinkable, but I've also an '07 which was even better than any BCS i'd had. Overall excellent brew."
"Overall, all I can say is time and time again, I love this beer."
"Overall: this is the most flavorful Budweiser you'll ever have (sorry, had to make that joke). Goose Island claims this is the original spirit aged beer and I don't know if that's true, but this nonetheless is one of the better bourbon barrel aged beers out there. I would definitely give this a try if you can before Budweiser mucks with it. Cheers!"
"O- One of my favorite beers ever. If I could drink one beer only for the rest of my life, it would be hard to turn this one down."
"O: Overall this is a very good stout but not the best I have ever had. It will be interesting to see how this beer will age over the next few years. After about 5 minutes and a few sips this one definitely has a warming effect on the entire body. With an abv of 13% this one is exceptionally smooth even though it does have a nice bourbon bite. I am a bourbon fan so this really doesn't bother me. Overall a very nice offering from Goose Island. I look forward to visiting this one again in a few months or even years."
"O/D: Great sipping beer, one 12oz and I'm good. Very nice brew."
"O: This is an amazing beer and should be a must try for anyone that likes beer."
"Cheers."
"O- Excellent version, in my eyes I value both the fresh and aged equally depends what you're looking for from this brew. If you want that upfront bourbon burn then go for the fresh, but if your looking for more of a confectionery desert brew go for the aged version."
"Had during a recent Goose Island Bourbon County Tasting in Charlotte with marine1975, boodingo, CarolinaKevin, HopDiggityDawg, and GehenHerzog at Mike Brawley's house with Budweiser sign blazing! Big thanks to marine1975 for bringing this one to the tasting! 2009 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Vieille Provisions Saison Dupont Willie. Poured pitch black with a half finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and big sweet alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was pretty freaking tasty! I've had a few of these sitting my cellar for awhile now and have been wanting to tap into them. The alcohol on this one was still a prominent on this one for me. It wasn't overwhelming by any means, but I'm sure there are some more subtle characteristics to this one masked by it regardless. On the nose this one is quite big, but the flavor has mellowed some. Really nice backbone going on here. Really glad I got to try this one!"
"O- If there's something better out there, please let me know... cause I haven't found it yet. This brew optimizes what an oak aged stout should be (or hope to be). Near perfect as any beer I've ever tasted!!!"
"O – Soft, slow sipping, and delicious."
"Huge thanks to HapWifeHapLife for this extra, as well as Marine1975 for bringing it to the tasting. This is an exceptional beer than I have been fortunate enough to try."
"Pours pitch black, almost no head but an infintesimal collar prevails. Nose holds a retrained bourbon. Initially, nothing else is evident, but sitting on this for a bit some oak and vanilla comes through along with a mild, mild chocolate note. Taste drops a massive bourbon bomb on the palate, and hits with some alcohol right away; alcohol burns and tingles the tip of the nose. More chocolate and roast comes through, along with more oak and vanilla sweetness. Very complex integration between these flavours. Body is super full, sticky and very rich, but the flavour is so complex and layered. Outstanding."
"Pours a black color with ruby highlight. Minimal tan head, really just a thin ring. You could smell the bourbon as soon as the cap came off. Some roasted malt, charred burnt notes, a bit oaky, but bourbon whiskey dominates. The taste is not as hot with alcohol as the aroma would suggest. Flavors of roasted malt, some chocolate or cocoa, and the bourbon barrel; vanilla, oaksmoke. A nice beer with a background of bourbon, not overpowering alcohol burn. This is a sipper, to be enjoyed slowly."
"Taste is fairly complex, rich and strong, but not overly intense and fairly well restrained and balanced. It has coffee and dark toast, esp. in the finish, mostly caramelized sweet coffee & prunes, burnt sugar & a slight medicinal cough-syrup quality, esp. at the finish. It is boozy and alcoholic, with a rummy quality, but it is fairly mellow and very smooth and it is not rough or overly boozy, esp. considering the strength. It has some good complexity, with enough depth of character and with no single element overly intense or overpowering everything else. It is quite drinkable and never gets tiresome or boring, despite the fact that it is pretty strong and definitely a slow-sipping drink. It is excellent overall."
" Bourbon right up front in the mouth. Sweet, lots of vanilla, charred wood. Medium bodied not heavy, alcohol is not overpowering for the high abv. Dry, bitter, roasted malt in the finish, with dark chocolate, espresso coffee in there also. As the beers warms the vanilla & bourbon are the dominate flavors. Would pair nicely with a cigar. Low carbonation, with velvety mouthfeel, sticky upfront. It warms the belly as it reaches room temperature. I find this not really complex it's pretty straight forward. Bourbon, charred wood, vanilla, some dark fruits, with dark chocolate & espresso coffee not getting much else. The warmer it gets the more there's just vanilla & bourbon, and starts to get heavy in the mouth. Becoming hot & boozy, more bitter in the finish. For me it's just okay, I've had better examples of the style."
"Overall: This is a great beer, one of my new favorites and I can’t wait to try the other versions. I look forward to see how it develops over the next few years. Highly recommend."
"12oz bottle. Says 2009 on the label but the Bottled On date on the back says 01/14/10. Pours a black color with brown and ruby hues. No head. Jesus Christ, I could smell bourbon before I even started the pour. Unbelievably boozey smelling along with some roasted malts. Black licorice and a bit of oak, but bourbon dominates. The taste is surprisingly less boozey and very well balanced. Flavors of vanilla, oak, roasted malts, dark fruits, chocolate and then the warming alcohol. It really is shocking how boozey this smelled but how it didn't taste like a glass of bourbon. This is one heavy, slow drinking beer. This brew had about a year to age and I am curious how it is fresh and also how it is with a few years on it. Overall, I liked this a great deal and although the 12oz bottle set me back $5.79 I would absolutely look for it again."
"Overall - Thank heavens this comes in 12oz bottles. You want more, oh you want more, but something like this you savor and let it fill your soul. Phenomenal balance of bourbon aging on this one. A standard by which to measure the use of barrel-aging to augment the flavors, not just ""increase-the-heat-by-aging-in-bourbon-barrels"" to a beer. This makes me want to try the Goose Island Rare even more now. Well done. Best barrel-aged stout I've had. So far...."
"Overall this is a grand slam. This beer is what craft is all about, craftsmanship. One hell of a job GI you have won me over. Lets just keep this going after the InBev takeover."
"Cheers!"
"Tastes rich but not overly so. Deep, dark malt flavors glazed over with the bourbon. The bourbon accents the stout and does not overwhelm the rich, dark chocolate flavors."
"Pours jet black with a chocolate brown head. In the aroma, oaky and bourbon, with nice hints of coffee and chocolate. In the taste, chocolate, dry coffee, and oaky bourbon. A smooth and big bodied mouthfeel, with a dry oaky bourbon like aftertaste. I feel like I just took a shot of bourbon, big nose and nice bourbon in the end."
"D - Pretty drinkable, especially given the strong flavors and the 13% abv. The bourbon flavor is strong and flavorful, but still well balanced."
"This beer pours an oil-like black... devoid of color. A thin tan head perches its self on top and recedes quickly leaving very little lace. I detect the bourbon almost immediately- followed by vanilla, brown sugar, sweet malts, and chocolate in the nose. The taste follows and adds notes of tobacco and wood. The alcohol gives a pleasurable warmth- perfect on a winter evening. This imperial stout has a full body and low carbonation. Another great offering from Goose Island. I love this beer and will seek out more for aging."
"this is the elixir of malt that sits someplace smooth in between RIS, port, and bourbon. pour is about a half a finger of head. thick liquid of unbelievable plato. nose of whiskey smoked wood and vanilla. palate is that with notes of licorice, vanilla bean, coffee... and i'm mean an intensely expanded palate of it, almond, mission fig. the finish is warm and syrupy. like i said an elixir. extremely broad palate range but in turn at the cost of a equal feel. this is a concentration of all the flavors that could come about in such a drink. and i think one bottle can be shared among 4 people."
"EDIT: After tasting Rare and Vanilla versions I stand by this ranking. It is still an extraordinary beer even without being ""enhanced"" in any way."
"O: I can see why so many people love this beer! I have yet to try it fresh, but a couple years on this definitely hasn't hurt it. Amazing all around and definitely well crafted. Thanks a ton for this vintage bottle Jay!"
"This beer is so delicious but so unique I have trouble comparing it to the 30+ other stouts I've reviewed. It pours very dark and the aromatics smelled wonderful -- raisin, fig, seem to dominate. Between the unique taste and the high ABV, it seems like this beer blurs the line with barleywine. I can finally take it off my ""want"" list!"
"This has really left me with mixed emotions right now, perhaps I'm just not completely ready for this beer. I've got 2 bottles left, I might just have to review this again later down the road."
"D: Amazing beer but it's strong with plenty of booze; sip this and sip it slowly and you will be one happy dude"
"O/D-This beer is well balanced. It still tastes like a stout without going overboard with the bourbon. Happy to try it. Lives up to its reputation but I wasn't blown away enough to cop another $12 bomber."
"Even out of the bottle Bourbon County blows away the competition. On Tap and fresh.... I wish I could go back in time, beat the crap out of my past self, and steal all the beer I drank that day."
"D. Pure heaven in a glass. This is my favourite beer to date. If only all beers had the class that this black beauty has. Any beer drinker that does not like this doesn't appreciate beer at all."
"Overall: Amazing porter."
"O/D- Ahh, one of these 12 oz. will do it for me. Sometimes if it's something I can't put down the beer will be gone before I can finish the review. Not this time, still 2/3 left."
"Overall this is one of the best beers I have had to date so complex and tasty. This beer without a doubt lives up to its hype!"
"Overall: Will be looking to set a few more of these away for a long while, its worth the wait. I had the 2010 BCBS the last week at a bar and really enjoyed this beer, but age does amazing things to this beer. Fantastic beer!"
"Overall, for me this was the best stout of the BCS flight, which included Vanilla, Rare, and Coffee. The Rare was still good but needs about a year before it is ready."
"M & D - not that drinkable compared with many. This is like drinking a cigar. 6 hours later the aftertaste is there. The alcohol was noticeable and you could taste it."
"get some if you can its worth it"
"Vintage 2009 bottle but the twist top killed this one for me."
"O -The alcohol is timid with the age but very aparent as it warms your soul. Delicious, drinking great right now and reakly wonderful fresh from the tap. After drinking the growler ran out for additional fills."
"O- I say this alot but, this may have been the best beer I've ever had, though one goblet was more than enough to satisfy until the next time we meet."
"Overall a great Bourbon aged imperial stout. This is a sipper of a beer but it is great."
"A damn fine beer, right up there with the best of the best."
"2009 vintage. Pours black with a red hue. Beautiful red-brown head. Strong bourbon barrel aroma. Also mocha, Kahlua, chocolate mousse - extremely inviting. Prominent bourbon flavor up-front, but is not overbearing. Flavor that follows is sweet molasses, mocha, chocolate, and vanilla hues. Light carbonation that compliments the flavor. Heavy on the palate. Roasted malt flavor lingers, alcohol warmth. This one definitely as good as everyone says. A little sweet for me and almost has the qualities of a ""dessert beer."""
"Great beer. Glad I got to try this one.I'm curious to see what time will do to this beer. Will it mellow out the heat?Got a few more small botlles taht I'll leave to age. To be continued."
"'07 - 4.0, '09 - 4.5"
"Looking over these reviews, I seem to prefer this beer fresh. I guess I'll just have to put a few more down!"
"M- Very smooth, creamy and very pleasant on the pallet."
"EDIT - Had an 07 bottle at a March 2012 tasting and it was incredible."
"D - ABV will sit you on your ass. I wouldn't recommend more then two but it's a nice sweet drinking adventure."
"D- A slow drinking beer meant to be closely examined. So many interesting qualities pop out of this one. Exceptional stout!"
"M - Velvety smooth, medium carbonation."
"D- This is a great sipper. I am very impressed with this beer and just want more of it! This is a top notch stout right now I have one 2008 and another 2010 aging can't wait to see what age does to it."
"A bit too sweet for me to really want to buy again. The bourbon and the sweet are not hitting me quite right. Still, I can see why people think so highly of this beer. It is pretty heavy duty and intense."
"2009 vintage. This is one hell of a beer. Syrupy mouthfeel, one of the thickest beers I've ever had. A real kick from the whiskey flavor and the alcohol (13%), that makes it very much a sipping beer. But the smell is fantastic and the flavors are incredible, with the bourbon blending pleasantly into the strong stout roasted barley flavor, and lots of molasses & vanilla. I've brewed and consumed quite a few whiskeyed beers, and none of them have been nearly as smooth and balanced as this one. Just really good (but best in small quantities - a 12 oz. pour was too much for me)."
"An excellent beer from Goose Island. Can't wait to have some other variations of this one. Anybody want to trade??"
"I actually enjoyed the palate assault that this beer delivered. Very complex. Definitely a sipping beer (I took about an hour and a half drinking it.) Not for an inexperienced stout palate but an excellent choice for someone who loves big stouts."
"Found on tap, this stout pours thick, almost black with a thin tan head. The aroma of bourbon is evident from the moment the glass nears the nose. The bourbon-barrel aging is again evident in the taste - a powerful, bordering on overpowering (in a good way) bourbon flavor is laced through each sip. Overall a stellar stout made for sipping and enjoying that pairs excellently with a big, juicy steak."
"Incredible beer. One of the best I have ever tasted. For the ABV it was super smooth and refined, even balanced. Loved the bourbon and layers of flavors."
"D: Definitely a sipper, but I would say it attenuates the booze as well as other big gnarly RIS I've had. Makes you want to keep sipping to pick up all the different flavors, but could use a touch more balance to make increase the drinkability."
"On the other hand, I'd rather not have it again unless it was for dessert. If I bought another bottle, I'd let it age for a while and see what happened. With this much alcohol and sugar I think it'd age well."
"Finished the 08, same story as before. I think I almost sensed more heat on it, but I didn't have the back to back. Hard to say. The beer calmed down a little bit, but it's still huge."
"Poured from a bottle of the current release. Poured a black tar color without the density. No head formed even with work. Lace did not show threw the entire drink as well. The aroma was welcoming and a preview of what was to come. Bourbon was up front and in charge of the smell. With sweet roasty malts in the far back ground. The taste was interesting and was not bad by any means. The bourbon was of course up front supported by the sweet malt in the back ground. To me even though the Bourbon was stronger by far I feel they melded together pretty well. The brew was a bit hot fresh. Would love to see how this beer ages, as I feel this is a classic example of a brew to cellar. I would probably stay away from the new release unless I plan to age them. Would recomend to anyone who has yet to try it."
"D: Hard to drink more than a bottle of this in one sitting, but something I can, and would want to, drink every day."
"Drinkability: This is the opposite of a ""Session"" beer. This is a sipper and one to baby through the night....like I'm doing right about...now."
"Pours out pitch black, almost not lacing on the glass. Smells like chocolate mixed with a little coffee, can tell it is a strong beer just from the smell. Strong bite chocolate flavors with heavy alcohol presense. Tastes almost like some jack daniels was mixed in with this beer. One of these beers is good for a night. Great stout."
"This is my favorite beer, hands down. I size up other Barrel Aged Stouts against it. The 08' is drinking amazingly right now."
"After reviewing the ""rare"" version, I thought I better review the regular version too. This is for the 2009 edition, that I've been cellaring for about 1 year. The beer pours dark as can be with a tan head that quickly fades. The smell has loads of bourbon in it and a little bit of chocolate and boozy heat. The flavor is dominated by the bourbon with some choclate in there as well. This wasn't as smooth as the rare and definately had more alcohol heat. Still it was interesting and enjoyable. The mouthfeel was great for a big stout with a fairly low, albeit good level of carbonation. I had this for the first time about 6 months ago and hope to keep this one around to enjoy from time to time."
"I poured this into a glass and it was so dark and rich looking. When you put the glass upto the light there was barely any light coming through. This was the best and greatest complex beer I've tried. You can pick up so many things while you drink this. I picked up chocolate, maple, bourbon, and a little hint of coffee. The noise of this beer you can smell the bourbon and it smells really good. I wish they were producing more of this beer this year. I was told no more until November 2011 in MA"
"Drinkability suffers a little due to price and availability (impossible to buy in OH). Plus the booziness makes it an extreme sipper. That being said, I will never hesitate to drink this beer. Never."
"In my opinion, this is one beer that every beer lover ""must-have"" in their lifetime. If not for the taste, then purely for the effort of the brewer's."
"My personal preferance is drinking this one a bit more fresh. Perhaps an example of the fact that a wood aged stout may not need additional aging. Finish is soy, bitter espresso and light salt."
"The thing that blew me away about this beer is that I wasn't blown away by the 2009 when I had it. I also had a BORIS (not BA) right before trying this beer. I though that was a great beer and to have this 2008 GI BCBS totally walk all over it really, really surprised me. After having this one I went on a search for both BCBS Rare and more of the 2008."
"CHEERS!!"
"I enjoyed this brew at a Rare Stout night tasting, thanks to CampusCrew and the other generous BAs. This was a true standout out of 20+ bombers of highly rated imperial stouts."
"I am floored by the quality of this beer. I am more than ever eager to try the other offerings from Goose Island. Next up is a 2010 to see how they compare..."
"D: Found about a case of these around town and I'm really enjoying them. The more it ages the more bourbon flavor comes out. Very easy to drink and great for a cold winter night. A must try for any Imperial Stout lover."
"drinkability: we had a rare sout party is this was one of the selectons. One of the best of the night."
"I can now see what all the hype is about. This is great stuff. This young vintage is fairly hot but I don't mind that at all. It's kind of like drinking an imperial stout with a shot of bourbon. I would love to have a number of bottles of this in the cellar, I bet this changes in character over time."
"Overall, awesome, wonderful, and delicious. Sad I just have one 2008 bottle left."
"M&D- full and flavorful. No way you would not Know you had this brew. I would love to have it again. Amazing."
"Overall- phenomenal. Words cannot express. For those who have experienced this beer- no explanation is necessary, for those who haven't-no explanation is possible."
"T: I can see what all the hype is about. This is unbelievable. The bourbon is there, but it's mellowed out a lot in the taste and there is a lot of sweetness from molasses, dark chocolate and some vanilla. The alcohol is evident, but not overpowering, which was nice. The aftertaste leaves a dry, peaty bourbon taste on your tongue that leaves you wanting more, but slowly. Definitely a sipper and one you might want to age a bit."
"HUGE thank you to GoOSU for this extra!"
" Edit: Editing this to work with the 'drinkability/oreall switch. A bit higher now."
"Still one of the best easily obtainable big beers out there."
"One of my best friends brought this home from Nebraska and had been saving it for a couple of months. We drank it in celebration of a paper I wrote being accepted to be presented at a conference, and it was perfect for the occasion. One of the best beers I've had, and I will definitely try to seek this one out again."
"drinkability: This is a tamed beast. Rich but mellow."
"D--Boozy, not to be trifled with. Highly recommended..."
"D: Excellent brew. Definitely a sit-back-and-relax sipper. The alcohol, however, is well hidden in the layers of flavor."
"Pours a deep pitch black color with brown or ruby highlights and a medium thick brown head with a fair amount of lacing. Smells of coffee, chocolate, and a lot of roasted malts. Tastes very complex: with dark fruits, cherry, roasted malts, and chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is low."
"Well here we go. Bought this 2009 bottle a while ago with a one bottle limit and at the the time it was the most I had ever spent on a bomber at $13. I decided to try this tonight because i have never had it and i am constantly searching for more. This thing has been begging to be popped since I bought it and i realized that i am not going to get anymore. So pour into a nice chalice with vigor. Beautiful black with a nice off white head. Smelling this beauty is not what i was expecting at all. It reminds me of Jewbelation, which i love. I get big dried fruits, chocolate. Some wood and bourbon. Taste follow nose with a hint if not more of copenhagen snuff. A bit too sweet not at all what i was expecting. Very viscous. And pleasing as it coats my tonguel. Glad i had some one to share it with. The search has been finalized, if i find if i will buy if,,. Just dont need the quest anymore. Cheers."
"O - This, not KBS, is the perfect Bourbon Barrel Stout. KBS lets the bourbon flavors dominate the stout a bit too much. Meanwhile BCBS allows the stout to be enhanced enormously by the Bourbon barrels. BCBS has a brilliant stout at its base, and is aged in brilliant Bourbon barrels, creating a stout that is simply incredible."
"D: Not very drinkable at all. The beer is cloyingly sweet and the bourbon overwhelms all other flavors. I've heard it's better with age, but fresh it's all syrupy sweet bourbon with a bit of toffee on the side."
"D - Alcohol is noticeable but doesnt take away from the drinkability. Well balanced beer with some surprising balances of tastes that were not expected at first. Very good tasting beer that I would love to get my hands on more of."
"Had the ’08 on tap on 4/16/2011 Rattle N Hum in NY. So excited to get to try this one on tap with over 3 years age on it. It is amazing. Def gets better with age. Even smoother, richer, and creamier than the fresh version. What a treat."
"This brew pours pitch black with a fingers worth of mocha colored head that dissipates quickly. This big boy has legs that stick. The nose brings scents of bourbon and sweet malt that blast through the senses. The smell of spent coffee grounds seems to mask the booziness pretty well. The taste is best put as ""outstanding"". Sweet malts and bourbon are perfectly blended with coffee tastes that leave an incredibly sensational aftertaste that lingers graciously. This full bodied powerhouse of a stout is rich, thick, and full, leaving behind a quenched thirst and a satisfied palate. Drink it!!!"
"D: Though this is most certainly a sipper, the drinkability is phenomenal. After exploring all of the flavors of one sip, the aftertaste lingers for some time, very enjoyably, and just as it's about to fade I can't wait to take another sip. Though I wouldn't want to have more than one of these, one is more than enough to keep me satisfied."
"Conclusion: This is my highest ABV beer to date I believe, and is certainly the thickest and darkest. A truly awesome creation, and one I have waited long to try. I have a 22oz bomber in my cellar, and it will continue to wait there... for I want to put the 5 year claim to the test. Overall this beer is outstanding."
"D: An excellent stout that I'm glad I finally got the opportunity to try. This is amongst the best barrel aged brews that I've had, clearly one that set the standard. This brew was a nice part of a great day in Chicago with my lovely wife while temporarily joining the local fans cheering for the their Bears in the NFC Championship Game (alas they lost). This is a true Chicago treasure and all beer fans should come to this great city to enjoy it as it was meant to be."
"O: After savoring my way through several bottles of KBS the past few months, I wasn't sure if the bourbon barrel stout category could get any better, but I was wrong. I honestly think BCBS is better in just about every way. I have never had much or liked bourbon itself, but it turns this beer into something special. There may not be a better way to unwind after a long day at work when the temperature falls into the single digits. So glad I finally nutted up and bought a bottle. Thank you Goose Island, thank you."
"Drinkability is very good overall. I love how all the flavors mix and everything compliments each other nicely. This is the perfect example of a barrel aged beer in my opinion and one I hold all others to as a benchmark. One of the best beers I've had period. Perfect drink for this cold evening."
"Overall: I have always loved this beer, and every time I have it i revel in it's huge bourbon kick, thick mouthfeel, and the smell as soon as the cap is off. Glad I'm getting coffee and vanilla in a current trade. My vertical later this year will be 09-11 BCBS, BCBVS 10 and BCBCS 10. Going to be a fun, drunk night."
"Drinkability: This is a fantastic beer. I've shared a bottle of this brew with friends several times in the past, and I have to admit that one bottle can easily be shared between two or three people. It's a great tasting beer, but so intense that I don't think I could drink more than one of these in an evening. I sure would like to try, though."
"D: This is incredible. The best Goose Island beer and one of the best Imperial Stouts out there. Try it, you will thank me."
"D: A 12 oz. bottle is actually perfect when shared with another person. I wouldn't want any more than this, but having said that, it's super tasty and worth the $4.50 I paid for it."
"This is one of my favorite beers...it is one of the few beers I would drive for hours to buy. I agree with what the 1000's of other reviews say...this beer is outstanding. It is truly a trendsetter and the mark for which other BB aged beers should be judged."
"Drinkability is great, as long as you take it slow. This is a superb dessert brew, and a bomber of it is a good sharing size. I will revisit often."
"I would be happy with an 8oz pour and thats it for the night."
"Overall the brews were great. I highly recommend trying any vintage. Minnesota has a lot of 2009 lucky to find a couple of 2008's but had a friend bring me back the 2010 from Chicago!! Enjoyed the brews and I will for sure enjoy them again!! I did think that the 2009 was lighter than the 2008 but not by much. It took me over two hours to review these three. Glad I didn't go anywhere!!"
"this has aged well, id imagine it has a few more years on it. i dig the 12oz size."
"the mouthfeel is still very smooth and heavy and drinkability is good"
"Its a great beer, but a sipper for sure."
"I have a second bottle which I will cellar and try again in a year or two. I heard the Bourbon will mellow out with some more age. Right now its strong and it has some bite."
"D - Really awesome beer for the bourbon lovers, like myself. It was still a little hot even after being in the cellar for a year. It was the perfect accompaniment to the intense snow outside and the roaring fire in the fireplace."
"Notes: Definately a sipper for a snowy winter night such as tonight nicely drinkable. Cheers."
"The drinkability to an extent is my only concern. This is a beer that should be drunk over time and enjoyed. This is a VERY high ABV beer and not meant to be pounded. This is a refined drink that should be respected and enjoyed!"
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, slightly filling, very strong kick, excellent representation of style, this is a very good big stout worth drinking for as long as you can handle it."
"I have had this a few times now. The first time I had it I had to convince the owner of the liquor store to sell me one. See during this time they were very hard to find and he had a tiny select batch he was aging for himself and other customers. I finally talked him into selling me one, at a premium, and enjoyed every sip. Now you can get these in 12oz four packs. My initial purchase was a 22oz. My local liquor stores that I frequent seem to be keeping this brand in stock. The running price for this four pack is $20 here in San Diego. I recommended anyone that loves dark beers and can handle the nice taste of bourbon to try this beer out. I am pretty sure you will enjoy it."
"Overall, it's like Goose Island took a very very good chocolate stout, and infused a perfect shot of Bourbon in it. Bourbon lovers be ware because GI is king of the Barrels!"
"Drinkability- at 13 percent still very drinkable!"
"The CPJ"
"My how the palate changes over the years. 2013 version is a bit heavier at 15% ABV now. A little less of a bourbon assault then I remember, a much smoother velvety texture and cleaner finish."
"09 BCS pours a thick, dark stout with a diminishing head. Smell is huge bourbon, roasty, chocolate, a little coffee, malty, and awesome. Taste is very full, bourbon, chocolate malt, vanilla, oak, roast, some sweetness, but finishes with suble bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick and coating. Drinkability suffers a little, but it just tastes that good you will keep drinking until its gone... no matter how long it takes."
"D: The alcohol, sweetness, and richness in this one definitely make it a sipper. Very enjoyable for a glass, but not really a beer to drink all night (even if you could)."
"Overall, a magnificent beer. One of the best. World Class stout."
"I drank it out of a snifter and it opened up like a flower in bloom. Enjoy yours dudes!"
"D: This is incredibly smooth and easy to drink. This got better and better as it warmed. One of my favorites."
"M/D: full-bodied, oily, low carbonation. A pleasant sipper. Much more alcoholic warmth when cold -- this is a brew that really opens up as it sits. This is a must drink for stout-heads. Can't wait to try the vanilla version!"
"D - very tasty, surprisingly smooth for a huge stout. I had this on-tap at the Wrigleyville brewpub in 2007, where I found it far too hot, masking what turns out to be rather nice qualities underneath. Definitely worth the wait."
"Really nothing but good things to say. BCBS 2010 pours with loud fizzy noises. Looks greath with a finger of deep brownish red head atop a thick black oily inky body. Your olfactory glands are slammed with aromas of vanilla, wet white oak, licorice, bourbon, and heavily roasted malts. Your tongue experiances sweet, and dense malts, backed up by waves of vanilla, chocolate, oaky sweetness, light coffee, and toffee notes and faint, very faint hop balance. Slick = mouthfeel. It's a sipper, and a damn good one. Just a bit hot, but it is a 2010."
"D/M:when I finally let it warm up a bit it drank much smoother, slight alcohol presence, whiskey was warming and not overwhelming, smooth drinking"
"Awesome stout !!!"
"One word of caution - it might be too good for just one bottle. I'm glad it comes in 4 packs!"
"But suffice it to say that the next time I see this beer, I will pick up a bottle or two. Highly recommended."
"D: AMAZING!"
"Note: tasted against Vanilla BCBS."
"D - Really solid stout here. I think this could definately stand some more age though to let that 13% mellow out. I have one more bottle of this and will try it again in 2012."
"SkÅL!"
"OVERALL: I dont know if it lives up to the hype.. I was expecting euphoria and paradise in a glass... but in mortal terms the beer surpasses expectation. I actually think I'm getting more intoxicated just smelling it. The nose is always there. encouraging the next sip"
"d. slow and steady with this monster. but rich and enjoyable, if not a bit too much at times."
"M, D- Besides the dominant ABV, this is smooth, sweet, and velvety. The big alcohol moderates (at least my) drinking pace."
"D - Wow, this brew lives up to its hype; not many can say that. The range of flavors in this beer put it ahead of any other bourbon barrel aged stout."
"Drinkability- 3.5 The aftertaste makes this more difficult to drink than 07 or 08."
"Exceptional beer that drinks great fresh and packs a punch to boot. Looking forward to trying more with some age on it."
"D - drinkability takes a hit from its big body and massive alcohol, yet its just delicious. wonderful winter sipper, spend some time and do this one slowly and correctly. a couple years has done some good to this, allowing the booze to come down to a tolerable level and let a few other flavors develop."
"D: This beer is delicious, and I would have another, but, I don't want to ruin the specialness of the beer by having another one right away, plus, a few too many of these would probably knock you flat on your butt. But this is an amazing beer."
"Very smooth in the mouthfeel with the alcohol pleasantly masked for such a high abv. One of the best stouts I've ever had."
"BCS is a damn fine beer, and for the size and overall character, quite drinkable. Don't expect to pound it all night, though - frankly, it would be a waste."
"For some, this bottle could make for an entire night of drinking; for most others, it's worth a try but one's enough. The label reads, ""One sip has more flavor than your average case of beer."" You've been warned."
"Drinkability: I really wish this was available in PA. I'm a big fan of bourbon solo, but this is just great. Definitely will seek out as much as I can."
"D: One is enough. Great beer that is extremely satisfying."
"I could not sip this all night, but the mouthfeel is splendid. Going to buy a few more bottles. Price is well worth it."
"I'd been avoiding this one for a while based on the price, and that won't really be changing anytime soon. $12~ a bomber, $21~ a 4-pack is too rich for my blood, but this is a beer that needs to be tried. Just, learn from my mistake. Make sure you've got someone to share this with."
"Shared Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout tonight with a friend while brewing, and I have to say, I am very disappointed with this beer. The beer looked nice, a thick motor oil black, but oddly, even though the beer hissed when opened, there was almost no carbonation. It was entirely way too sweet, it was like sucking a caramel candy while drinking a mocha. The bourbon flavor came on in the end, but it was a bit harsh and overwhelming. The alcohol we very present and the carbonation was too low making this a difficult beer to finish, which makes for a syrupy, boozy mess."
"This is a one-and-done beer. Lowe drinkability due to the high abv, and the abundance of flavor. Save this one for a special occasion, have it after dinner with a cigar, or cellar it. Just don't plan on having more than 1 in a sitting..."
"D: Couldn't have more than a couple of these, but they're delicious."
"D: This is 13%abv and all I want to do is drink it all night long. Unfortunately, I have to wait till next year to try it again (2 left)"
"D: Total sipper. It is rather hot and just intense. Really solid mouthfeel makes me want to drink it and I enjoy the flavor profile. It is just honestly too hot for me. With some age this could turn into something really interesting."
"Overall, this was a fantastic find!! What we enjoyed most about it was the inherent complexity to the flavors, which find such an intricate and intimate balance and smoothness. This expert blending of such robust flavors and aromas, and the unique impregnation from the barrel aging, make this beer of an outstanding quality, placing this brew apart from its competitors."
"This beer is outstanding. The taste of the bourbon is clearly there and there is a very nice burn from the alcohol. The finish is exactly what you'd expect in an imperial stout. This beer would be much better after aging for a year or more but it is still delicious as is."
"D - Surprisingly easy to drink for such a humongous beer. Tasty and rich but not cloying and overpowering. This vintage is pouring quite nicely right now."
"D-This beer is a sipper no doubt, but I find myself craving it at times and a 4 pack doesnt last long with me. I had a hard time giving a bottle to a buddy of mine. But it is too good not share. Will be getting more in the future."
"That's where this guy really struggles for me. It had an amazing nose, and it just explodes with rich, sweet, and spicy flavors in your mouth. And for that it merited big scores for smell, taste, and mouthfeel. The first 3-4 ounces were awesome. But over time, as I worked through the glass, this just became a chore for me to finish. It's got a BIG sweet/spicy flavor... just so much so that it's not terribly drinkable. I really enjoyed trying it, but I would not want to have a 2nd one back-to-back or even another one later this week."
"Very glad I was able to try this, wish I could get this at home."
"This beer pours a black color. There was a slightly tan head that tried to form. The aroma of this beer smells of booze, caramel, chocolate, coffee, and oak. The flavor is very rich and complex. At first it starts out sweet, and seems to fade into a booze flavor, and ends with a coffee flavor. There is an alcohol warmth at the finish. The mouthfeel is very thick, and I would consider this a sipping beer."
"O: 4.0 Heat is a bit much along with the sweetness, and obscures any depth it might have."
"This is creepily drinkable and yet also sippable. Alcohol is noticeable taste wise but not smell. Overall best bourbon stout I've had in a long while"
"Drink- I can only do one of these bad boys and I am okay with that. I highly rec. this stout to anyone to give it a whirl. Awesome beer."
"The flavor didn't disappoint. Two years in the bottle hasn't diminished the chocolate, dark fruits, coffee, vanilla and general roasty flavor in this beer. The bourbon flavor isn't at all overwhelming, and the age has mellowed the burn from the alcohol quite a bit. This beer really coats the inside of your mouth as you drink it, in a very pleasant way. The carbonation is noticeable, but well balanced; it renders it creamy-feeling."
"The BCS pours a deep black color with a small ebony head that quickly fades. The smell of this is extremely strong. Lots of strong coffee, bourbon, malts, and burnt aromas are noted. An amazing smelling beer. Taste is quite smooth. This beer ages unbelievably in my opinion. Still plenty of bourbon flavors but the alcohol has really mellowed out for how high the abv is. Mouthfeel is thick like oil. Drinkability is solid. Huge abv but this one is reserved for special occasions."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Very full bodied, one of the heaviest bodied beers I've tried. There isn't a lot of carbonation and it leads to a slick mouthfeel that is pretty good. Could use a touch more carbonation. This is a 13% ABV beer and definitely a sipper, but it's a good one. I will be looking to age a few of these. Should be outstanding once it mellows a few years."
"The taste is incredible, and the mouthfeel is so creamy and smooth, a bit syrupy but still hides the alcohol well given how much there is. It's bourbon, it's delicate fruits, it's vanilla and burnt caramel, it's smoky barley malts, it's a raw syrupy chocolate, it's a spicy coffee--it's an incredibly complex beer, to be savored with every sip. I am realizing right now that I don't actually love bourbon, so I can't give this a 5 personally, but damn if I don't recognize the craftsmanship and originality of this beer."
"I really think this is a fantastic beer, and in some categories, I've only rated it below a five because it's not as good as Rum Barrel Aged Oil of Aphrodite which incinerated my socks off when I had it about a month ago. I think it's a fair fight, though."
"D: The sweetness and high octane nature of Bourbon County Stout make this a great choice for sipping on a cold winter night, which is exactly what I did. While this is a nice brew I enjoy on occasion, I am satisfied with a small serving."
"Due to the low carbonation, this one slightly cloying, but not overwhelming. I'd like a bit more CO2 prickle on the tongue, but this is close. Overall, it's been a challenge to take it slow. I love whiskey and bourbon, so this beer keeps calling me back for another sip. However, I'll definitely have to share the bomber of 2009 I still have in the closet! Oh wifey dear..."
"This is one of my favorite brews, a staple in the winter. Who am I kidding, this is excellent any time."
"D - the mouthfeel I felt was the culprit of what could have been a great beer. the sweet syrupy mess would have been much helped with a little carbonation. with a few years of aging i figure this might be a bit more drinkable."
"Drinkability: A superb and very complex beer. The alcohol, though is such that this is a definite sipper. I could see this one being absolutely outstanding after some cellar time."
"Drinkability: This is a nice beer, don't get me wrong, but it isn't very drinkable. The syrup like consistency and the scary high alcohol content make this brew a bit too much."
"P.S. I've heard some BAs say that you actually dream about this beer after having it. I laughed when I read that, but I can honestly say that I have actually dreamed of drinking this beer. Fantastic brew!"
" Probably one of the best Stouts on Earth."
"This is a full bodied brew that at times seems lighter just because of the sheer evaporative quality that this brew has inside your mouth. It is acceptably light in carbonation and is a mighty fine sipper on a cold night. This brew is a savage beast and I really like it. At 1 year old, it hasn't even touched a fraction of it's aging capacity and tastes strikingly similar to a 3 year old bottle I recently had. I know the label states that this brew can develop in the bottle for up to 5 years but lets be honest, that is a starting point for this brew."
"D -- Drinkability is definitely good and enticing, but more than one of these in a sitting could be disastrous."
"Picked up in a nice bottle shop in Beacon Hill, Boston,MA. Pours oily black with a really nice head. Smell the bourbon right away and it was nicely present in the taste. This gem really began to shine as it warmed revealing an array of rich flavors and a nice bourbon warmth in the finish. Really enjoyed this brew and will certainly seek out in the future."
"D. Great for the end to a great day."
"D: It doesn't do much to hide the bourbon heat but is still incredibly drinkable to me. I wish I had more of these left."
"D: Its a big ass impy stout! What do you think the drinkability is! One bottle and time for bed. You might want to get a nap before trying this guy."
"This is a staggering and overwhelming beer. All of the flavors mesh together and attack the pallet in turn. I'm glad I had the opportunity to share this with two friends, because there is no way I could have finished the whole bottle myself. I wish they would distribute to PA and I didn't have to drive to NY to pick this one up. I would be interested to see how this one tastes with some age."
"Very special to have a great beer from a great city (my dad's hometown). Can't wait to try the coffee, vanilla, and rare (if I'm lucky enough)."
"First thing I notice about this is the chocolate taste and bourbon smell/taste. Great for sipping. Sometimes I think I'm sipping on a port or sherry since the alcohol is so high and noticeable and the chocolate presence. For 13% it's pretty smooth. I would like to see how it ages over the course of 5 years so maybe I'll buy 5 bottles and have one every year and compare notes."
"Mouth feel is creamy and coats the tongue. Not too viscous and little carbonation. I would love for some more bitter coffee/cocoa flavor in this beer. Too much milk chocolate. Maybe that's why the coffee version is so good. This beer seems to need the barrel to take it to that extra level. I don't think this stout could stand well on its own as evidenced by Nightstalker."
"This beer is easily comparable with the best of the style ( Founders CBF, Oak Aged Dark Lord and Oak Aged Stone Imperial Russian Stout come to mind) BUT it is way more easier to find. My only criticisms is that the alcohol levels are too apparent hurting a lot its drinkability and complexity. Maybe it needs to be aged for a few years."
"Taste. If you like chocolate, you'll LOVE this beer. Loaded with chocolate. The bourbon is wonderful, and the alcohol is very hot. Also tasting maple. These are the only ingredients I can find, but I emphasize that the chocolate is what ties the whole room of flavors together. I haven't read other reviews of this beer yet, but I would hope that others have noticed the chocolate is most prominent in this beer. I have a 4-pack of 2009 BCS gathering dust. Be back in 10 years."
"This is a beer that took me a while to drink. Not because it's bad (it's not), but because its pretty strong. You can certainly taste the alcohol in this beer."
"D-- Honestly this beer needs long term cellaring. With one year of age on this it is good but still a little hot. It is balanced well with chocolate, vanilla and bourbon but the bourbon is still a bit much. I have a 660 of this and it was a task to finish it. Another year and will revisit it."
"this was a weird beer for me. i wanted to love it, i still want to love it, i still may well love it. but we are not right for each other yet, we both need to mature a bit. she needs to calm down and i need to loosen up. we have agreed to try again in a year and see where that takes us."
"As others have said before me, this is a beer that fills the room with absolute olfactive bliss. I wake up thinking of this beer. I smell this beer in dreams. I wish to wed this G--damn beer and anoint our future children with its blood. Seriously, a work of art. Could only get better with age."
"D - ONE is drinkable! This one has taken me a few hours to suck down - a few great hours that I have thoroughly enjoyed. Two of these would be a waste, but one every few months or once a year would be delightful!"
"Just mind-blowing on how a few months more of some subtle aging can create an even bigger monster of a beer than it already was. Not bad for my first growler!"
"Since the first time I had it, this beer has been one of my favorites so I thought I'd use it to start doing beer notes on Facebook. If you come across it, I highly recommend picking one up. Please keep in mind, this is a very heavy and strong beer. I recommend sipping it at about 54-58 degrees. Also, of the eight or so I've had, the best one was just over a year old. It says on the bottle that it can age up to five years, but I have yet to have the patience."
"Tastewise all I expected and more...Chocolaty and hearty. Will have when ever I see it on the menu..."
"D: Very warming and delicious beer. Like a glass of Jack Daniels mixed perfectly with a RIS. I will definitely have this beer again, and I will have to search for it. As for tonight, one will be enough for this sitting. A sipper certainly."
"Drinkability is very, very dangerous. Enthralling smell, complex and nuanced taste and a velvety viscosity, I could definitely have a lot of this, which is scary. I already love Bourbon County Brand Stout; having it from a growler has just made it love me more. I didn't know it was possible!"
"Without question it fills the mouth, and this one is as drinkable as you can handle the 13% abv. My first time having it I walked like an Egyptian to 80's music for a couple hours afterwards. Second time pretended to be Russian and wore an aviator hat in the middle of September. Enjoy this... responsibly."
"From the 2009 edition: Pours a dark reddish-black, almost no head at all. Woody bourbon-currant nose. Nice fairly heavy mouth feel. Very smooth, bourbon-raisin/currant taste. Very mellow after-taste. The high ABV is only barely perceptible and is well-matched to the strong-ish flavor. Flavor is the name of the game here. Very tasty and very drinkable; assuming one likes strong, bold-flavored beers. I'm putting a couple of bottles away to age for a longer time period to see if it really does improve and mellow with age."
"I'm gonna buy more of this for Christmas gifts to send around...it's just that good."
"D: I love Big, Complex beers and this one is at the top. It is easy to drink, due to the fact that I love borbon, but it may be too much for a young one just getting started. For 14.5%, it's off the charts!! Fucking A+"
"Heavy mouth-feel, but creamy and viscous going down. Well worth the wait, and now I get to track down another one to enjoy."
"If not for the lack of lacing on my glass and the slightly over carb - could be all 5s. One of a kind still and stands alone at the top!!!"
"D: Yes, 13% his me hard, bit I wouldn't want it any different. I sat there and poured the last drops from the bottle into my glass. Thank God for the invention of the bourbon barrel stout."
"Smooth, medium to full in consistency, with just about no coordination. Goes down smooth as hell, and is thoroughly enjoyable, but the fact that I am buzzing a bit after a half bottle makes me knock the drinkability. This is definitely a sipper, and it gets much better as it warms."
"definitely a high quality brew that is worth trying if you can find it!"
"This beer pours a motor oil thickness that is adorned with a fast fading tan foam that looks rather nice. The smell is lots of oak and some bourbon to boot the boozy fumes aren't too bad, but I kept it colder so who knows if that might be the reason why. There is a nice chocolaty aroma as well as some butterscotch and raisin. The flavor is quite bourbony with some oak, raisin and hints of cocoa in the back. This beer could use a year to mellow out, but it is still a really good beer. This is too boozy to drink right now, some time to mellow would be fantastic. Still a really good beer and a recommendation. If you have the willpower to cellar I say buy it and do it."
"D - This is the ONLY part where this stout suffers. There is maybe a wee too much alcohol in this. It is fine when you start but when you get to about when you have a fourth left in your glass, the bourbon becomes overwhelming. This is still an incredible Stout and I would highly recommend it."
"I love Goose Bourbon because I love bourbon beers, but whereas I used to think this was the Holy Grail of the style, I have now found many other similar beers I like just as much (Odin's Tipple, Bourbon Stone RIS). Still, a beautiful thing! Very close to a masterpiece."
"D-I hate to be contrary to others, but I didn't really care for this, it's described by others as a ""sipping beer"" and while I appreciate that, if I wanted to drink bourbon I just would, this didn't do it for me"
"I must say that this is the biggest, manliest beer I've ever had. I'll be interested to try the vanilla, coffee and rare very soon."
"One of my absolute favorites. Just had 2010 yesterday. I may be a little delusional, but it seemed that the 2010 is a little sweeter and a little easier to drink than the 2008/2009. Thus, to me 2010 isn't as good as previous years. Perhaps aging a bit longer will help."
"Poured from the tap an oil black with a small thick tan head that faded quickly. Smell is dominated by bourbon, roasted malts, and some hints of dark fruit and black liquorice. Taste is of chocolate, bourbon, warming alchohol, a bit of coffee, a hint of dark fruit and liqourice. Mouthfeel is thin and smooth not much carbonation. Drikability well this one is tough it is a wonderful beer however very high in ABV and that makes it tought to have more than one. That being said you could enjoy more than one when the time is right. But definately a sipper."
"Overall this is one of the most full bodied beers I have tried, very intense. It is not for the faint, but quite rewarding. I could not have more than this 12 oz bottle to myself and I am hard pressed to think of many foods that would stand up to this beer."
"Despite the heavy feel, drickability is alright and is not hard to put away."
"dark tan head that dissappears relatively quicky. Dark rich, pitch black color. Rich aroma, complex aroma. Obvious presence of bourbon, also some candied flavors like liqourice and warming, roastiness. Flavors are just as bold and complex. Bourbon is very present, but very well blended with other flavors of the beer. The roasted malts are very presence. Hint of dark fruity notes as well. Very thick, long sipping beer. Great winter beer, well actually great beer to enjoy anytime, but defintely the type of beer that warms your bones on cold winter nights."
"One of my favorite bourbon barrel stouts i have ever tasted. Very tasty, my only complaint is that you cannot consume to much of it do to its high alcohol content."
"Excellent taste, perfect feel, but a touch on the strong side. A wonderful beer to sit and sip, but gets to be a bit much after around two."
" This is simply an amazing stout and only gets better with age."
"Dark....dark....dark.... i have never seen such black before no carbonation can even muscle thru the darkness. Soft chocolate scent nothing really overpowering. Tastes very complex; chocolate up front with a nice bursty bourbon punch of alcohol, roasted malts, licorice and coffee. Smooth, mildly carbonated. This is a sipper for me, sits heavy on my stomach but excellent blend of flavors and character would definitly drink another but not right now. Very nice bourbon stout cross style blend, yuuuummm its very rich."
"D: I've had much stronger beers, but this beer is pretty strong for being 13%, seems to drink like a higher ABV, which is not bad at all. I enjoyed this beer very much, but I also love high ABV beers. It's not for everyone but if you like strong beers, you will love this beer."
"Notes: Vintage 2010 bottled on 10/15/10. Wonderful beer. Strong bourbon aspect. Glad I have four more to age and will add on to the review when I try this later. Quite an amazing beer. Bourbon and alcohol are strong but there are so many other flavors as well. Great beer and I am really excited to age this and try it later. Get this if you can, especially if you love whiskey, if you don't you are likely not to enjoy this as much."
"D: Certainly a sipper, but I find that the case with most of beers in this category. Overall I found it delicious and I was very happy to run into this. Wish I had a couple of bottles that I could let sit for a while."
"Overall: The strongest beer I've ever had. Smell and taste alone will put you to sleep."
"D: I'm loving every sip of it. its a big beer so i know i couldnt drink a lot but its very well made with great flavors so i could sip on it all day long."
"D: Much tastier and drinkable with age. Excellent, yet still too boozy to attempt taking too much down by yourself."
"One of my favorite stouts and because its always readily available I just love having it in the fridge. Great work here"
"Drinkability: Simply an amazing stout...one of the best around. Special beer for special occasions."
"Overall this beer has lived up to all the hype that surounds it. It is overall a very well balanced stout and I cannot wait to get some more so I can age it and try it again in a few years."
"Notes: If you swallow too hastily and this stout hits you in the back of the throat, it feels like bourbon. Take this as you will, but it's points in my book."
"D - This is suprisingly drinkable given the ABV and the lack of age, had no problem finishing a 12oz."
"Overall: Would have been higher, but the booze becomes a bit too prevent as it warms; none the less, this is absolutely deliciousness. Everyone should try it at least once."
"Highly recommended by itself, or if you want something to calm down the taste of your favorite cigar"
" The flavor has lively blend of vanilla, bourbon from the barrel aging and it pops! The taste lives up to the name as the cocoa and bourbon taste is sweet woody and gently toasted with vanilla from the oak playing off the intense dark malt flavors with a slight coffee in a mild degree, but the bourbon is pretty high in the flavor as expected even after three years in the cellar. I consider this a world class beer, wonderful use of barrels and still with all the alcohol in the flavor it has a high drinkability quotient for me - a crazy good bourbon barrel stout -I would love to have it in one of its other incarnations."
"D: There's no way I would drink more than one of these. In one night that is...."
"Overall, one of the top beers I have ever had. Price was a bit high, but worth every penny at the same time."
"Serving type: 2009 Vintage (12 oz bottle) with less than 4 months on it."
"Pours jet black with a small but nicely colored tan head. Aroma of Bourbon, roasted black coffee, dark chocolate and some earthy woody notes. The taste is a wonderful integration of whiskey and imperial stout. It never crosses the threshold of being too much booze. The mouthfeel is viscous, syrupy. This beer is the best Bourbon barrel RIS I have ever had."
"2009 Vintage. Pours a one finger brown head that quickly fades to a ring, leaving traces of lace. Black color no highlights. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Bourbon and alcohol nose. Flavor is bourbon, molasses and some alcohol. Pricey at $6.30 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"This beer falls into the category of beers that I will always buy when when they become available, but don't want to drink more than that."
"D: WARNING: This is definitely a sipper. VERY strong and full flavor. God dammit it's amazing."
"I was impressed - I'll be getting this again. I had held off on trying this one for a while because I don't care too much for Goose Island's flagship brew."
"D: Overall this is a sipper if there ever was one. One of the biggest Imp Stouts around as far as drinkabilty goes. You ain't slamming this one. When you crack one of these bad boys make sure you don't have any plans in the near future."
"D-Now that it's close to 3 years old, I prefer the 2009 batch to this one. It was more drinkable fresh than this one, and seems to be holding up a little better. I may be in the minority on this one, but I don't think this should age more than a year or two."
"Final Thoughts: This beer was easiliy THE MOST unforgetable experience i've ever had drinking a beer. This beer not only raised the bar as far as stouts/imperial stouts go but shows that a beer is able to pushed to the extremes and still be an absolutely pleasure to drink. If I come across a few more of these, especialy earlier editions, I will easily pick a few up a store them for a while, just to see how different it can get over time. This beer is an easy TWO THUMBS UP!!! You can tell that alot went into this beer, and it certainly a abolute pleasure to drink. Cheers to Goose Island!!!"
"D - As it warmed it became a little harder to get down but overall the drinkability was a little above average. The abv makes it just a little rough."
"This beer is awesome. Try it if you ever have the opportunity, I am so glad I did."
"Overall, this is a great stout, but at 11 months old, I don't think its reached its peak. I'll let at least 2 bottles from this batch sit a while longer, because I have a feeling that the background flavors will only show-off more with time."
"Overall- Wow!"
"I'm curious how it ages. will the bourbon nose ease a bit? the bottle states it should develop for up to 5 years and I have 3 more from this 4 pack sitting in the cabinet..."
"D: Not as drinkable as other beers of this class. Most recently, the vanilla version of this, Ivan the Terrible, and Bourbon barrel plead the fifth, come do mind as more drinkable and overall probably better beers. Although, this is still an excellent beer in my opinion. As one of first barrel aged beers I had about 1.5 years ago, this will always bring back good memories for me. The alcohol is noticeable, but considering the 13% ABV it still goes down very easily and smoothly. Still, more than 12 ounces in a night is probably too much, unless you are looking to get quite drunk."
"Really had my hopes up for this beer, and it delivered."
"D - Obviously not something to drink heaps of but I wish I had more."
"I still have 3 more of these, should be neat to see how they evolve."
"This is a very special beer. Probably in my top 10!"
"Drinkability is high as long as you only plan on having a glass or two...one snifter and Im feeling this already! (4.5)"
"Bottle. 2008 vintage. Pours a nice dark brown thick color with a slight tan red that collars around the glass. Crazy aromas in the nose including coffee, dark bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, molasses, and the ever present bourbon and oak notes. The bourbon aroma is much more subdued now than in fresher batches. The taste is just as complex and rewarding as the aroma. Full heavy mouthfeel filled with bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and oak flavors. The bourbon makes a bigger appearance in the taste as it warms but still is not overpowering. The alcohol too is fairly well subued and is only really present when you really are looking for it. Just an outstanding beer that in my opinion is one of the best IS's out there."
"As per tradition, heated up on the stove to about 120-130. So damn good! Put in a touch of fresh raw milk and a pinch of cinnamon. Out of this world. Go ahead...try it."
"The mouthfeel on this beer is really what sets it apart. You can almost chew it. It is slick and oily with a nice stickiness to it. It is everything an Imperial Stout should be and the barrel aging just adds to the complexity and the warming alcohol taste."
"Pour a small half finger chocolate head that dissipates to a few clingy spots. Smells roasty, vanilla, toffee, toasted oak then bourbon. Tastes, again of chocolate roasty toffee vanilla. Sits well in the mouth, great transition of flavors. Dry and slightly warm finish but nothing offensive. Love this one as a sipper. Light carbonation, medium mouthfeel. D: Again it's a sipper but a fine one at that. A screw top on a 12 ounce bottle? I wonder how this cap holds pressure at 3+ years. I could enjoy a few of these each year."
"This is full bodied, no holds barred, knock down drag out awesome! Rich and smooth feel with a creaminess that massages your palate and throat. This is an amazing big beer to sit and sip on. One of these is a nice treat. Two of these is asking for trouble. Three of them means you better set aside some bail money!"
"2013 Update: Nearly 3 years later, this continues to be one of the best bourbon barrel aged stouts. Complex, suitable for aging and an absolute wallop to the senses, this remains much better than many other bourbon barrel beers I've tasted. My scores have been adjusted accordingly. Original review remains above."
"Despite the appeal of each of the flavors individually, however, they seem to fight each other rather than melding together nicely. In addition, the bourbon flavor comes across as more of a straight-up alcohol presence than I would have liked rather than just a sweet woodsy essence. The texture is certainly mouth-filling, with a resinous, boozy stickiness. Overall, I can recognize the depth and complexity of the flavors that are developed in this beer, but it just doesn't come together for me."
"D - The overall experience is incredible. The oak and whiskey add balance and blend the other elements together. It is very filling and warming so you don't need more than one, but it is a great one to have."
"Drinkability: I hate sharing, but this is so big and intense, that it should be shared. The bourbon is not just a note you detect, it really dominates the beer, but in a good way. Complex and delicious. I can't wait to try other bottle in a year or so."
"This one's so thick you can almost chew it and there is some surprising carbonation for such a heavy stout. This one's a sipper to be sure, but it goes down easy when I need a good bourbon fix."
"A fantastic barrel aged beer. If you like bourbon and want to experience the beer version of it then this beer is for you. I do feel that Bourbon County is dangerously close to a one trick pony though. The barrel aging is in full control of the flavor profile and thus makes it a bit one note in my eyes. Terrific regardless."
"Notes: For me, the only thing holding this beer back is the alcohol burn. It's not intolerable, but it's more pronounced than I would like."
"Will drink this anytime."
"the smell is overwelming bourbon. if I was blindfolded, I would think that it's just a glass of straigth whiskey sitting in front of me. obviously if you're a bourbon fan, you'll love that, but it's a bit much in my opinion. fortunately, the taste is not as overtaken, and is a bit more balanced."
"***Edit: As the beer warmed further towards room temperature, some booze and a bit of unwanted astringency manifested itself. Taking off 0.5 for both mouthfeel and drinkability. Still highly recommended.***"
"BCS is an incredible beer. It's relatively easily available and puts many hyped beers to shame. While it's not quite the best barrel-aged stout in the country, it defines the sub-style for me (and, I assume, many others) and has held up very well against a horde of fancified newcomers. The beer is jet black with a healthy brown head, when fresh. The head is much smaller with older vintages. The aroma is big and rich with flavor. There's a ton of bourbon, but it doesn't drown out the dark malt and other barrel notes. Coffee, chocolate, roast, vanilla and oak aromas blend almost perfectly with the bourbon. The taste is strong and assertive but also smooth and luxurious, just as a big stout should be. There's a good deal of booze, but it's a warming, pleasant presence and the beer is better for it. Mouthfeel is smooth and full. Not to take anything away from the base stout, but Goose Island is simply better at barrel-aging than the vast majority of breweries. I don't know if this is experience paying off or if Greg Hall is just a genius brewer who nailed it on his first try, but Goose Island BCS is a modern classic of American beer."
"Blackness in a pilsener glass... not a sliver of light showing through. Thick, dense, short-lived tan head of a proper stout. Nose of vanilla, chocolate, malt, and, naturally, whiskey. Sweetness features prominently at the start with an alcohol bite at the back. Imperial stout. This is followed by a gentle-but-authentic sweeping bourbon finish. Vanilla all over the aftertaste. A bit of breadiness, perhaps a charred smokiness, as well. Heavier mouthfeel suited to the style. A stand-alone brew. As of this moment, I'm seeking another bottle to age."
"D: ABV is really big or would be very drinkable. Still, lots of rich, complex flavors make it a very interesting beer."
"(12)"
"D: Obviously, a 13% beer can't get a 5 here but man I wish I had another one of these ready to crack. Definately in my top 10 and IMO kills KBS."
"Damn this is tasty, wish I had bought 2."
"M/D: Great body, rich and creamy goodness. I really love the stout, I think it plays well with everything, very harmoniuous. I can't wait until 2010 comes out and I can do my 5 year vertical tasting. Yum..."
"D: The absolute best you can hope for in this style of beer. They've reached a pinnacle of the Bourbon barrel-aged with this one."
"Thanks. I enjoyed writing my first review."
"2009 vintage. Pours a jet black without some tan head, but head is a little bit thin without much lacing. Tons of bourbon in the nose, with vanilla, chocolate and a bit of coffee. Taste has a nice amount of bitterness, but more sweetness. The alcohol is pretty apparent with the bourbon flavours, but it blends really well with the roasted stout. Very smooth, but not a lot of carbonation. I am having no issues finishing off this bomber myself."
"I had no idea what I was getting into when I picked this bottle. I'd heard the 2008 vintage is still boozy; I reckon an extra year hasn't done much in terms of mellowing. I certainly recommend giving this a shot, especially if bourbon barrel imperial stouts are your bag (if that's the case, though, you likely already know). This is a sipper if ever there was one."
"D - I could justify moving to Chicago just for the constant BCBS hook-up."
"Taste is dramatically dense, do I really have to tell you that it is full bodied? Doubt it. Bitterness tries to balance but ultimately gives way to a torrent of malt character. Surprisingly sippable for such a high ABV beer. Super creamy and velvety, soft on the tongue; just exceptional feel."
"Go buy a bottle. Wait, go buy five bottles! Really, I think this beer will age perfectly, and you will probably have a hard time not enjoying another bottle before you can find out. It is now No. 3 on BeerAdvocate's Top Beers on Planet Earth list. If you do grab some bottles, please send me one!"
"Jet black with lacy brown head with surprisingly long head retention. Tiny bits of lacing. Great aromas of smoky bourbon and charcoal, dark chocolate. Taste is lots more bourbon, quite warm but in a nice way. Smoky, woody and boozy. Very thick mouthfeel but not overly sweet tasting."
"*From notes taken on 6-28-10"
"Still, I love this beer in any vintage. Worth seeking otut."
"Overall just an impressive beer. I was suggested this beer by a Manager at a local grocery store. He said ""This is for when you want to reward yourself," and damn do I feel rewarded. Amazing stuff, two thumbs up."
"Poured into a pint glass (second I took a whiff I knew I should have cellared for a longer time). The color of this is black as oil along with the same viscosity. The head was 1 finger chocolate brown with a nice thick creamy head. The aroma is of nice bourbon and come sweet chocolate and a light hint of burnt malts. The flavor is very complex with semi-sweet dark chocolate covered by coffee and burnt sugars. The taste is smooth with a deep body and light carbonation. The warming finish of alcohol is very present but delicious. Great brew!"
"D - Well, I'm certainly enjoying this, but it's not like I could pound them all day. It definitely lives up to the name, this is a bourbon-bomb, no doubt, which is absolutely fine by me. Easily the most bourbon-y beer I've ever tried, I wish I had access to this, I would buy cases at a time. Yet another great GI beer."
"Chocolate, coffee, bourbon, and oak on initial taste. The Finish was a Chocolate covered espresso bean that was soaked in Whiskey. this was a very strong beer, that was a nigh/day cap for me on my Sunday funday. This beer certainly needs a snifter, and to be enjoyed over time. all in all a very yummy treat."
"D: Not very. One 12 oz is more than enough."
"D - Well...it's a sipper for sure, and about as drinkable as a 13% bourbon aged beer can be..."
"D: This was an amazing beer with super rich and tasty flavors. The body is nearly perfect, and the alcohol is surprisingly subtle for 13%. So it was pretty easy to drink, but must be sipped to fully enjoy. I'm curious how it is fresh, but I have a feeling that 4 years old has helped it mellow out a lot. This beer meets the hype."
"D - Pretty good beer. Definitely has a big bourbon flavor but it's not like that wasn't expected considering the name. I think this one would get rated higher but I just had some KBS and this one really doesn't match up to it. I would definitely pick some more of this up if I saw it and would like to have more but it isn't KBS. I'm looking forward to letting my other bottle age some and maybe it'll improve."
"Pours a pitch black color into a Portsmouth brewery snifter 1 finger coffee head rises quickly then dissaptes into a thin collar of fine bubbles. Nose is full of bourbon, no more no less its a bit overbearing, there could be undertones of some spice and fig but bourbon is very very dominant. Taste is bourbon, coffee and some chocolate interwoven. Mouthfeel is oily sticky and viscous. Makes having a few of these difficult when you add in the ABV, although it is well hidden"
"D: this beer was something else and is on another level, both versions of this brew are great. It drank well and is exceptional all across the board. This is definitely everyone has to try at least once. It is lower than speedway stout and black tuesday but still a nice stout."
"Very little head, but a nice dark appearance. ""Bourbony"" tast was overwhelming from the first sip. Cloying, sticky, nasty, like drinking a large glass of bad Bourbon. The Bourbon taste is overwhelming. 12 oz felt like about 10 oz too much. I have three more bottles - anybody want them?"
"This beer made my night. It was quite a journey and am surprised it does not receive more recognition. I have never had such pronounced flavors in my life. This beer is a must have. I will pick up a few more to cellar and see what this baby can do with some time."
"Huge legs like syrup as I swirl the glass. Nose is smooth, yet somewhat subdued and very buttery. Taste has developed incredible smoothness. More molasses and coffee has emerged, bourbon has actually faded a bit. The alcohol burn has died down considerably as well. Goes down so easily. So good my ears just popped. I'm bumping my previous taste score to 4.5 to reflect my experience with this bottle."
"This is one of the best beers in this style made. It is one hell of a stout, with a most interesting display of flavors."
"However delicious it is, this is a monster brew, no way could I drink more than one in an evening."
"D. not to bad for this big beer."
"I could imagine this being better on tap, but only if the syrupy-ness is reduced. I am somewhat disappointed that the final gravity couldn't have gotten a bit lower. Aging would Clearly do this beer justice. Cheers, all the same."
"D: Amazing for one snifter. The 13% ABV makes another slightly intimidating."
"I could drink a few of these no doubt."
"Whoa, now, this is on tap here? Right on, CK, right on. Greg, you sure know how to make us DC-area BAs happy. This bad boy pours a dead black topped by a short-lived finger of foam that straddles the delicate line between dark tan and straight brown. The nose comprises some strong bourbon, oak, vanilla, coffee, anise, rich chocolate, and roasted malts. The taste is dominated by the bourbon and oak, not unlike the totalitarian government in ""We"" (look it up, Philistines!). The rest of the tongue finds itself inundated with chocolate syrup, molasses, maple syrup, and roasted malts. If it weren't for the o'erwhelming bourbon nonsense, this would be fantastic; instead, it's merely better than many. The body is rather hefty, with a light carbonation and a chewy feel. Overall, a nice offering, but way too heavy on the bourbon. Without this lack of balance, it would be great. Almost..."
"D- this is a laviathan of a beer in strength and flavor but its so enjoyable you keep coming back for more."
"drinkability: god damn hail satan drink one for baby jesus"
"Jet black into Ommegang chalice. Thin oily head after a moderately violent pour. Traces of head linger with little to no carbonation visible. Aroma is fusel alcohol and dark fruits with a burbon note in the background. First taste is a massive mouthful of bourbon and it is oh so good. Creamy chocolate compliments the bourbon character nicely. If any of the other blind beers are a gauge this beer has some substantial alcohol content. Chocolate malt abounds and any chance of bitterness is masked by the bourbon profile. A bit of kreik note comming through from somewhere, could just be an aspect of the dark fruit I smelled earlier."
"Will definitely drink this again."
"Overall-a wonderful beer, no doubt age has helped too, a triumph with unique flavors and good character, I really enjoyed it."
"D: if you love stouts, heck, even if you casually enjoy stouts, you will almost definitely love this beer. I am going to get more of this beer, and look forward to cellaring it."
"Pours a inky pitch black with a very small dark brown head, wow. Smells strongly of darkly caramelized sugar and ethyl alcohol. Very pungent. Taste is an onslaught of flavor. It starts with charred wood, then a rich maltose middle and a vanilla, coffee and chocolate finish. Strong aftertaste of alcohol. Mouthfeel is like syrup, super chewy and decadent. Very little carbonation which is perfect for this beer. Drinkability though is pretty low though. The sheer amounts of alchol affects how much you can drink. That said, this is an excellent beer that I would certainly get again!"
"overall, not perfect, but one hell of a damn great beer!"
"D-This is a fine beer. Best enjoyed by sipping. A good value for such a big beer at 13% ABV."
"a boozy-sweet, roasty treat!"
"Found in Louisville for $5.95 a twelve ounce beer. Great for those pairing with chocolate - nice for bourbon lovers. Very thick, little head, nice complexity. Chocolate and raisin notes. Not too much lacing. This was bottled only 6 months ago so could age a bit. Worth trying-but not as good as the KBS ."
"D- you have to sip this. It is one heck of a desert beer. Arguably one of the top stouts out there. The alcohol is actually hidden as you go. Still, the syrupy thickness makes you want to take it slow and steady"
"2007 vintage. Oh baby. Syrupy pour with very little head that bubbles a bit but otherwise is unimpressive. Color is coal, pitch black. Smell is bourbon, wood, chocolate syrup, roasted malt. Promises to be a hefty beer. Tastes amazing, with caramel, toffee, butterscotch, and roasted flavors. Hefty mouthfeel, with the ABV really apparant in the body of the beer, along with the barrel aging. This is a sipping beer. There's really no comparing this to anything else on the market. It's simply incredible."
"Cheers."
"Bottle 2008 vintage. Opaque black pour with no head although some head rises when stirred. Aroma is bourbon, oak barrel, butter, roasted malt, and a hint of alcohol vapors. Taste is ... a loss for words. Vanilla, oak and cocoa but joined with a mouthfeel that is so extraordinary, in it's creaminess and fullness. It only loses a few points to its not quite entirely hidden alcohol that makes it kind of prickly. The best imperial stout I've had so far."
"D: this beer was something else and is on another level, both versions of this brew are great. It drank well and is exceptional all across the board. This is definitely everyone has to try at least once."
"This beer is a challenge. A stanky bourbon-bogged challenge. I don't like peeking at the review average before I write, but I did this time, and I'm somewhat taken aback. The color and texture are gorgeous, but the taste is all but offensive. Most of the elements of a nasty sub-par bourbon are present, none of the charming woodsy flavors or alcohol kicks, and all of the foul composty, earthy tones. Something is rotten in this brew. I don't plan on finishing the bottle, and those who are sharing feel the same."
"A sheer pleasure."
"A big thanks to Fostah is in order for this one. Poured this into a tulip. Pours black with a thin tan head that vanishes quickly. Not much lacing. Not surprising due to the high abv. I don't even need to lean into the glass to smell the bourbon. In fact, when I cracked the bottle cap halfway off I got a big hit of bourbon. It's a little tough to pick up on anything else in this but there are faint aromas of cocoa and roasted malts. Rich toffee lingers in the shadows of bourbon. This really smells nice, but it is predominantly bourbon. Wow! I figured I'd get a lot of bourbon from the smell but this is outrageous! Rich bourbon hits the tongue with notes of toffee, cocoa and coffee. Bourbon really shines through in this one though. The only thing it loses on for me is that I can taste alcohol just a bit, but a 13% bourbon bomb like this I can't be surprised. Wonderfully silky mouth feel. Just enough carbonation and the body is nice and heavy. This beer is tough to drink. It took me three hours to tank through the behemoth! I've had big barrel aged beers, but he bourbon flavor got so heavy at the end it really drank more like a whiskey than a beer."
"D - A bit more bourbon than I would have liked, but overall pretty good. I would definitely buy it again (assuming of course, there weren't other new beers available)."
"4.5 D: Excellent beer - even better on tap."
"- Dan"
"D - Complex and flavorful, but the strong alcoholic taste makes this less drinkable than other imperial stouts. Still a world class beer though, no question."
"D: Just freakin' great. You aren't going to have more than a bombers worth but that isn't the point. This is just a really good beer. I had it before and I don't think I truly understood it until now. I'm really glad I have a nice stash of this stuff now."
"2008 Vintage. Pours a dark black color with an extremely thin caramel colored head. Has an aroma of liqourice and dark fruit, with a hint of chocolate. The booze comes through on the aroma. Wonderful taste. Is a bit booze, some further aging should help smooth this out. But I can already taste that time has worked well on this brew. Sweet chocolaty up front, then the bite of alcohol, dark fruit and more chocolate with some subtle bitters on the finish. Very complex. Has a creaminess to it. Will age this another year and try again. Can't wait. Better than its famed coffee stout brethren IMO."
"I bought out the local Whole Foods after I tasted this beer the first time. It's a must-try and probably my favorite so far of an incredibly competitive style."
"Taste of intense booze, corn mash bourbon, caramelized sugars, vanilla, oak barrel aging, and booze. It really tastes like there was a decent amount of bourbon left in these barrels before adding the stout. Overly booze flavored IMO, almost all other flavors of what might be a stout are nearly covered up. Light mouthfeel for a 13% , light to medium carbonated."
"Note: 2008 vintage"
"viscous mouthfeel, low carbonation. at 13% it's still somewhat drinkable."
"I would enjoy this on Christmas or Thanksgiving. Considering that it takes me about two hours to get through a bottle, this is NOT an easy drinking beer, and certainly not a social beverage. Treat with respect. It won't be your favorite beer, but it'll always be in the back of your head, no matter what else you drink, it'll be there, like phantasm, laughing at you until the day you die."
"Feels thick and chewy in the mouth. Most definitely a sipper. Overall, this beer has caught me off guard in it's extreme bourbony quality."
"full bodied, viscous mouthfeel; relatively lightly carbonated. leaves lips sticky. this is the definition of a sipper - one you'll want to savor. i can easily see this earning a spot in my regular rotation, only drawback being its hefty pricetag."
"D: you can't have too many glasses of this in a night, however this is a great one to sit with and sip, grab a nice cigar and enjoy"
"This beer is for sure a top rank contender for drinkability versus complexity. Again, I say for being 13% and having a huge amount of aged whiskey in it you might think it would be a challenge to drink but that is the exact opposite. This beer is velvet smooth with so many flavors going on I highly recommend you sit back relax and be sure to enjoy them all. I highly recommend this beer to anyone who like a good bourbon or even likes barrel aged beers. I was lucky enough to land this in a trade because we don't see this kind of sweet nectar out here in Pennsylvania. So if you happen to come across this , go for it I promise you will not be disappointed."
"Notes: this drinks hotter than one might think...lots of bourbon. Also, this is a meal in itself, having this with food may be a bad idea."
"Overall a great beer the best I've had and I think this is what I will compare all stouts to"
"mouthfeel feels like a big, rich beer with a little prickle. mos def a dessert beer or aperif"
"Excellent beer, one of the best out there."
"D - Definitely a sipping beer."
"drinkability - heavy alcohol, rich and complex, intoxicating on many levels, amazing beer"
"At 13% alcohol, the drinkability on this isn't too high, and the rich flavor would be overpowering after a while. This beer is meant to be shared."
"Yowza.. Bourbon, bourbon, bourbon and more bourbon. This one's especially ""hot"" as the ABV is readily apparent. Pours a supremely dark black with a one finger tan head. Mmm delicious. I mean the bourbon, oak, chocolate and vanilla flavors are all bombastic but what do you expect? Smooth and creamy."
"My expectation according to Goose Island was a velvety, smooth beer, with a rich vanilla and oak taste. Sorry Goose Island, but you are clueless about this beer."
"Overall, this is an excellent bourbon stout. Probably one of the smoothest, well balanced offerings I have had for this style. Like the rest of the BA community, I highly recommend this beer and I'm very excited to try the Coffee version that's currently sitting in my cellar. Good work Goose Island!"
"D- A 13% ABV hurts the drinkability, but would have no problem sipping this one all night."
"D: Way too boozy to be considered very drinkable. Great sipping beer, but I've got a feeling I won't be drinking much after this bomber."
"D: Ha! I had a 12 oz. snifter, and was feeling the effects pretty quickly. Honestly, I bet I could've had another, but I'd say not much past that. Great beer, went down smooth, but limit yourself!"
"D- Sipper, I finished the bomber with no problem but I love barrel aged beers and this was just great."
"One of the best RIS I have ever had."
"You have to drink this slowly, because you can really feel that 13% ABV. Glad I split the bottle. But overall it's delicious - works best as a dessert, I think."
"Aroma of dark chocolate, cream, raisins and sweet bourbon, tastes like liqueur chocolates, one of my favorites snacks of all time. I am impressed a great deal by this beer. The alcohol is masked well but I can feel it inside me. I was expecting this to be one of the darkest beers but this is a beautiful dark chocolately brown color. After I rinsed my bottle out I realized the residue left was still darker than most beers even though this was dilluted probably one to five hundred. I feel like I am sipping bourbon and chasing it with chocolate. Fantastic stout."
"first is a semi-sweet choclate smell mixed with a soft coffee aroma. My wife's first reaction was to say ""MMMM"". I then poured the bottle into an oversized wine glass and held it to the light the color is true blackout black, there is no sign of the light on the other side of the glass. A small brownish tinged head formed but dissapeted quickly, a little lacing but not much. My first sip immediatley I thought of that dark choclate candy that my grandmother used to carry around with her, it was choclate laced with a slight peppery flavor very rich. The acohol is noticable as I thought of some fine moonshine. I sipped my beer for about an hour and didn't finish as the beer is very filling and rich. I think ideally this is a good beer to share with someone else. Overall I enjoyed it. I will be looking forward to haveing another. Also would like to see how this ages. The brewery suggests Five years on the bottle."
"D - pair with peppery beef or try for dessert."
"Drinkability: Excellent choice. Lived up to what my mind had decided it 'should' be. You probably wouldn't want to do more than one of these by yourself. After one, you'll find your ability to detect taste, smell, and most other senses will be thoroughly... altered!"
"Overall, very good beer. I would like to be patient enough to wait to see what it would be like after a year or so of developing."
"This beer definitely lived up to my expectations and was far and away more unique than I could have imagined. Truly exceptional."
"this is definitely a slow sipper, and one bottle should last you all night. gonna have to get more of this for cellaring, i bet it mellows out splendidly."
"This is a super rich, sweet dessert beer. Loads of bourbon in the nose and taste but I feel is has mellowed a bit and integrated a little better than fresh, super sweet, chocolate cake and vanilla, just a hint of cinnamon and wood off the barrel as well. A decent roast that is enveloped by the other qualities, could us a little more to give a bit of dryness to the finish and some balance. Super slick and thick mouthfeel, sulks through the mouth. Just delightful to drink with with dessert or as a nightcap, hides the ABV relatively well for such a big beer. Should just keep on getting better, yum!"
"Today is my 25th birthday and this was the perfect beer to savor and enjoy for this day. I have two more bottles of this and I am going to age them for a few more years to see what comes of these flavors!"
"Lucky to find this at Vendome in Toluca Lake, CA. They had two vintage 2008s just chillin in the back. The appearance is BLACK and VERY minimal head. I poured this very aggressively, and the head was still very minimal. The smell is SUPER sweet, and not a chocolatey or coffee sweet. This is WAY different than any other Imperial Stout I've ever had. The taste is very sweet with a smokey taste that hits the back of the palate. Strong Bourbon taste which makes this the thing that stands out with this HUGE beer! Even though the carbonation is very minimal, it still drinks very well. This would be great as a dessert after a light dinner. This is very rich, so I don't think I could have more than 1 in a single sitting, but it is 1 that is WELL WORTH IT!"
"Edit: In all fairness, this beer had only been in the bottle for 5 months. Another year of aging could have an effect on my opinion, but it is unlikely to make me love this beer. If I wanted bourbon, I would have bought bourbon."
"This is truly an amazing beer with huge rich flavors and spectacular aroma. Despite the high ABV, it still manages to be very smooth and easy to drink. The booze is obvious but very well tamed."
"Very well crafted but a little too sweet for me, which is crazy as this would have been my favorite beer back a few years ago. I do see what all the fuss is about though."
"D-its intense but for 13% it is very well hidden; fresh bcs was a bit much for me with the bourbon flavor but after a couple of months it was much nicer; a year or two on this beer would probably be amazing"
"My first BCS and it was very good. Expectations hindered my enjoyment of this beer slightly. Luckily I've got an '08 and '09 to compare this to sometime in the future. Great beer."
"Drinkability: This one is not my cup of tea, although it is certainly worth trying. I think that the oak taste overpowers the stout. The actual chocolate cookie part of the stout I like. If this was a bit less oaky, I would get this again, but for my taste the flavors did not blend as well as I would have hoped."
"D: Well, the last 12 oz bottle took 2 hours to polish off and considering I have an exam tomorrow, this'll be the only brew tonight. I am prematurely treating myself and deem this a rewarding brew."
"Outstanding!"
"You, sir, are a delight!"
"Bottle from Crown Liquors #6 - 2007 (Aged 2 years). Pours black with next to no carbonation. Lots of mollasses and chocolate on the nose. The taste is complex to say the least- mollasses, chocolate, licorice, soy sauce, coffee, and a hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is nothing but oil. Bottle - 2009. Pours Black with a thin, wispy head. Mollasses and alcohol dominate the aroma. Loads of chocolate and alchohol flavor with hints of toffee, soy sauce, and coffee. Mouthfeel is extremely oily but creamy."
"Drinkability - I have to say this is an interesting and complicated beer. In my first experience with this beer I was overwhelmed - and put off - by the bourbon, but after successive tastings I've taken a shine to it. I'd imagine a year or two in the cellar would do this beer some good, but it's still an exceptional beer fresh. Easily Goose Island's most exciting brands."
"M/D: Very full body, thick and chewy. Velvety feel since its so damn thick. There is some fine carbonation present that adds to the smooth mouthfeel. No doubt, a sipper. Drinkability is average at best since you can feel the alcohol burn with each sip. I would like to try this with some more age on it, bottle stats that it was bottled on 11/12/09."
"I don't believe dirnkability is a fair category for this beer. Although it is a VERY well developed stout it strong alcohol presence and high ABV make this a one and done brew."
"Not as much coffee taste as Kentucky Breakfast Stout (I much prefer the KBS).. I am going to lay this down in the cellar for a few years to see if it mellows at all..."
"Wow! This is deliecious. Huge, chewy, thick, viscous, BOOZY-heat, sweet raisins! This has a great flavor. Why doesn't this beer come to Philadelphia-UNFAIR! Mouthfeel is semi-complex...smooth and creamy, with a ton of heat and warmth in the mouth and down the throat from the bourbon aging. Overall...a wonderfully brewed stout!"
"Wow, this is a big beer. Pours a dark black with little foam in the glass. You can smell the bourbon and dark roasted chocolate from the glass. The taste is a punch in the face of flavour, with bourbon and roasted chocolate taking the front. Its very smooth and drinkable considering the 13% alc. Drinking an '08 followed by a '09. The older has mellowed just a bit compared to the newer batch. But both are fucking excelelnt. This is just a crazy awesome impertial stout."
"Goose Island is really making a statement with this brand, and even though they'd never admit it, I think the crew in Munster has taken notice. Maybe we don't need to stand in a line all day to get a world-class stout?"
"A very bold beer, very sweet and very bourbony. Was difficult to drink, the bourbon was quite strong and the sweetness did not help much, almost cloying. I would've preferred a little more bitterness to bring some balance to it. That said, this is a very rich, sweet, dessert like beer that is a wonderful sipper."
"D: This beer is big, and full of complex flavors, but it's quite easy to drink. Two years old may still be a bit young. It has some serious aging potential."
"One of my friends was generous enough to let me split one of these with him, and I couldn't be more impressed. Pours thick and oil-black. Pleasant bourbon odor, with an assertive, boozy presence. Rich, complex, and incredibly delicious, with hints of chocolate, oak, and a dozen other elements I couldn't possibly place. I don't feel like my knowledge of beer is sufficient to review this one. Suffice it to say that it's entirely awesome. Buy it if you get a chance."
"**1/26/15 - Woah even more notes! Tried a 2009 last night pre-blizzard, just over 5 years old, very impressive. Excellent bourbon and chocolate character, very smooth but still with that trademark warming alcohol. Low-but-there carbonation. Split it 3 ways, this is one tough 12oz solo if you ask me. Very happy that it's doing this well at this point. I have another '09 that I'll give another year or so."
"D - I do not care for hard alcohol so I would not be drinking this."
"I'm a huge fan of bourbon barrel stouts. This is a prime example of this style. Well done!"
"Drinking this was a pleasure. Thick yet silky mouthfeel make this such a winner. Just like whiskey straight, this is a sipping drink, but you'll savor each nip."
"Pours out from the bottle a deep, impenetrable black, with only the barest hint of foam. The first time I had this was a few years back at GABF and I remember it being one of the best I'd ever had. Time and distance has not changed my opinion much. Huge bourbon aromas on the nose, extremely boozy, with some cocoa powder, vanilla and tobacco. Huge bourbon again on the palate, along with roasted malt, coffee, vanilla and lots of warming alcohol. A bit hot to be certain, but still a wonderful example of the style."
"Awesome mouthfeel. I could sip this all day long."
"Thick and sticky, and so heavy. Moderately soft, but firm enough. Perfectly balanced between sweet bourbon and roasty imperial stout, never leaning too far in either direction. World class."
"D-If it wasn't for the high alcohol content (and price) I could drink this all night long! I'm sure some might not like it due to the heavy bourbon flavor, but for me its better than any other bourbon barrel aged stout (probably because I love bourbon)."
"D: THis is as drinkable as a 13% beer can be, a one beer session that can last for awhile as it warms"
"Not easy to drink, let this kid rest a few years!"
"OVERALL: There's no making a mistake about this one. This is a bourbon barrel aged stout, and it won't let you forget it. While the appearance was nothing spectacular and the feel somewhat off-putting, the nose and taste were done really well. Bold flavors that don't seem out of place, with lots of nuances going on throughout the whole drinking experience. There are some other bourbon BA stouts that fit the bill for their subtle complexities, but this is an in-your-face bourbon stout that will grab hold of you and not let go. If the palate were a little thicker and fuller, this would be one for to write home about. For now, it's just one to check out if you get the chance. Recommended."
"What a great beer, very complex nose and taste. Something to be enjoyed over an hour or so...this beer is 1.5 years old as I drink it and could still benefit from further aging, but it's great now too, so what the hell! - 4.0"
"D: this has become a mainstaple in my cellar collection"
"Cheers!"
"would probably age really well. I'll pick up a four pack and age a few of them next time im at the store. worth the high price tag."
"D: Definitely an excellent sipping beer with a good pipe. Strong offering."
"Pours an impenetrable black with a thin tan head that doesn't retain well, but this sucker is 13% so who cares. The aroma will really knock your socks off, with a huge bourbon presence upfront, followed by vanilla and caramel, coconut, burnt bread, some dark fruits, and a big alcohol presence. The flavor is similar to the aroma with big bourbon notes initially, followed by some coconut and vanilla, charcoal, caramel, dates and plums, a little coffee, chocolate and some fusel alcohol. The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety and drinkability is not very good (though you wouldn't expect it to be). A really fucking good imperial stout, a notch better than KBS in my book."
"Quite simply a phenomenal beer. It's amusing that the beer that spawned the bourbon barrel craze is still arguably the best there is. Done to perfection."
"Drinkability - Relatively speaking, this beer is a very well-executed stout. The extraordinarily high 13% is not nearly as noticeable as might be expected. All things considered, this is a drinkable brew."
"'09 BCS is just great (it makes '08 taste bad in comparison) and I have several of these bad boys aging."
"Bottled on 11/13/09.Finally a chance to try this,it has escaped my grasp a few times.Poured deep as an oil slick,no light showing through this puppy,a thinner dark mocha colored head atop.Powerful oaky bourbon notes in the nose,notes of vanilla and some alcohol dipped dark fruit became stronger as the beer warmed.Bourbon is the big flavor component on the palate,vanilla tinged and oaky,there is a slight buttery-rum flavor in the fisnish as well.This will warm the insides thats for sure,its a young bottle and its powerful,a great beer to sip on,who its warm in here right now."
"This is an after-dinner sipping beer. I believe it is closer to taste and feel to an overpowered barley wine. It's like no other stout I've ever had. All this said, it's very tasty but not for the faint of heart. Worth seeking out for the unusual flavors present."
"Interesting beer."
"Poured ink/black with a 1.5 inch thick, dark tan head, that dissipates with an obvious crackling. My glass is beer clean! The initial nose suggests smoke, bourbon and wet wood. Medium high, silky body with extensive lingering and delicious hints of chocolate, coffee, dark caramel and bourbon-macerated dried figs. The lace is mostly absent, excepting a few clusters of small spots that slide into into the stout. Density is high! The alcohol is evident and warming. I imagine it would be excellent in a snifter. Drink with care and devotion. The subsequent nose reminds me of Gethsemane Chocolate Bourbon Fudge. Although it is a warm sprig day outside, the Bourbon County Brand Stout makes me think of winter and roaring fires."
"Overall not impressed but would be open to trying again since I usually have good experiences with Goose Island."
"I've never been blown-away by the other Goose Island brews I've tried, but the Bourbon County Stout is definitely an exception. It's rather pricey--I paid > $5 for one 12 oz bottle. However, it was definitely worth it. At %13 ABV, one bottle goes a long way. Even before pouring it, I could smell the warm bourbon aroma from the bottle. When I tasted it, the bourbon flavor was solid, but not overwhelming. I could still taste the chocolate and caramel notes as well. Overall, this is one of best stouts I've ever had."
"This stout gets on top of you quickly at 13%. I'm pleased with the experience."
"D- One and done for sure but this is almost as good as it comes. Great flavor profile and a rich smoothness make this the perfect sipper. I have two in the cellar and can't wait to see how this one turns out in a year."
"Overall, seems like this beeer could go 2+ but 1 year is a strange develpmental stage or just the '09 was off."
"Amazing beer. I recently picked up 2 bombers. Opened the first one last night for a friends birthday, and am cellaring the other. appearance was BLACK as oil. Smell was chocolate/caramel and Bourbon! True to its smell and name, the bourbon was definitely there in the taste. It wasn't overpowering (I can only imagine how smooth this will be after some aging), but a friendly reminder of the power in this beer. After a few drinks I could feel the warmth too. I think i'll open the other when winter comes."
"D-This 9 month old bottle proves that the original bourbon barrel aged stout is still one of the best! With a bit more aging and mellowing this WILL become a masterpiece. Even at this ""young"" age it is damn solid!"
"D - Drink very well for 13 %. Alcohol has a nice warming effect to it. Delicious."
"I haven't had too many Goose Island beers that I've been truly impressed with, but Bourbon County Stout by itself solidifies the brewery as one of the great American breweries. I look forward to future opportunities to consume this rare treat. Bourbon County Stout is a true delicacy."
"i really hate to even judge a thing like drinkability for this beer. its all so great, but just like any big RIS, you cant take too much of it, sits in the stomach real heavy. but put that and the ABV aside, i would drink as much of this as my stomach would let me. putting the huge cost of this beer aside of course. the price of this beer was definatly holding me back for awhile, but im glad i finally came around, because this is definatly at the top of my list. go get it! dont be scared!!"
"Drinkablility- If you've got the money for it and it's cold enough enough outside. You could go for 3 or 4."
"1/4"" head fades quickly to a nice thin lacing, appearance is dark as night just like a stout should be. Smells of bourbon, oak, vanilla and a hint of chocolate and some more bourbon. Taste follows the smell, but I have to say this the most balanced beer I've had at this ABV. Starts out with a good balance of chocolate, oak, vanilla and bourbon and fades nicely into a bourbon finish with a touch of coffee and an alcohol warmth. For the ""ABV"" this beer is very drinkable and I have to say it measures up with the best of the bourbon aged stouts."
"This is a pretty big brew. At 13 abv it hides a good deal of it. Pours a beautiful black oil with a dark brown head. There is just a punch in the face of coffee and chocolate. Upfront dark chocolate the smoothes to the back of the palate then turns into a dark bitter chocolate with a long bitter finish. The texture is velvet. Good brew."
"D: For what it is, I guess BCS is pretty drinkable. Although, given the ABV and flavor profile Im having a tough time finishing a 12oz myself (your mileage may vary). Id rather split this between 2 or 3 people."
"This definitely did not dissapoint, it is a very tasty brew!"
"D - The 13% isn't hidden, but highlighted. The warm burn is the perfect finish to an intense beer. The 4 pack that remains in my cellar is in no immediate danger for the time being."
"But boy it is so, so good. This beer good enough to make skeptics believe in the divine. It really is that good. Beer this good is a gift of the gods. On the other hand, my theology might be fueled by the high alcohol."
"D - Well. Definitely a sippin beer and a one bottle and done for me. But very delicious and would have again."
"Notes: This beer is borderline mind boggling. It's like a bourbon-chocolate milk shake; so thick, so many intense flavor profiles. This is definitely once an evening. Actually, more like once a month so your mind can readjust to normal beers again. This is a beer that you can only pull out on someone who really digs big beers, otherwise you are just going to scare the crap out of somebody. This is more akin to drinking a dark chocolate/vanilla liqueur than a beer, fo' sho'."
"Goose Island really got this beer right. A job well done."
"The bourbon isn't as up front in the taste, but the sweet maltiness is right there, and it's delicious. Rich and sweet, it is an unabashed malt bomb. The texture is velvety and smooth, and it coats your tongue as it goes down. There is a slight alcohol burn as it goes down as well."
"D: dessert like, a sipper, would be great match for cigars."
"Rich, creamy and tasty and even though at times the bourbon is a little strong this is one great beer thanks Andrew."
"D - It's definitely a sipper but again given the amount of flavor and alcohol it was very drinkable. I found myself placing my glass down after a mouthful but picking up as soon as I swallowed."
"This beer is 13.00%! What do you expect? The drinkability is almost perfect considering what this is."
"Overview: Fantastic beer, but you need to pick your spots with this one. Lucky enough to reside in the Chicagoland area and able to endulge on Goose Island products at will!! Would definitely come back to this one though!"
"M/D- full bodied, low carbonation, great mouthfeel and very smooth. i wish they'd bring goose island to CT cause this beer is something i wish i could get my hand on. great beer."
"Drinkability: For the strength and intensity of the flavors this beer is exceptionally drinkable."
"D: OK. A sipper. Took one hour, 30 mins to finish."
"D - While the ""B" aspect of BCS does indeed provide quite a healthy dose of alcohol warmth, it still drinks like a champ for a huge 13% Imperial Stout. This is a beautiful beer, no doubt about it."
"Into the glass pours a none-more-black oil that slowly generates an espresso crema-esque layer of carbonation on the surface. The smell is akin to walking down a hall of kitchens. Impressions of chocolate brownies, bourbon balls, coffee cake, and burnt brown sugar atop a just torched creme brulee fill the mind. The spectrum of scents is so incredible that it could be a vapor course at Moto. The taste demands an hour's repose. Dark, bitter chocolate precedes the vanilla, caramel, smoke and charred notes of fine bourbon. Dried cherries and raisins form in a holy alliance with classic stout traits of coffee and cream. It is thick enough to be a foodstuff. The finish makes me wonder how they bottled silk? This particular day I paired with a 2007 Kentucky Black Gold cigar aged in Woodford barrels for two years. The earthy, mellow notes meld flawlessly with the rich, smoky character of the brew. Yes, this certainly is the greatest cigar beer in the world. And this is why I always have a few cases around. Cheers to Greg Hall and Goose Island, 2009 is the best Bourbon County Stout of all."
"great brew"
"It's hard for me to rate this. I don't go head-over-heels for these sweet, huge ABV stouts. I like it, but it's hard for me to enjoy much more than 5-10 sips. If I could buy a 12 oz bottle to share, or if I tasted a few sips of it at a friend's house, I'd probably rate this higher... . But when I spend $13 on a bomber, I feel like I need to finish it. After the 5-10 sip sweet spot, I don't enjoy it quite as much as I did at first."
"Sit back and sip this one as a companion to a book, cigar, or deep conversation. BCS lives up to its reputation. I was also fortunate enough to find this on draught, and while still excellent, the bottled version was superior."
"Everyone knows how good this stout is. It appears to be getting better year after year, as this five-month old 2009 bottle is as good or better than the 2008 vintage right now. I'm excited to taste the coffee and vanilla versions releasing for the first time this year."
"Note: I don't actually know how hard it is to find 2008 or below Bourbon County Stout, but at the moment the Whole Foods at Union Square has a bunch, all from 2008. Not sure if this note will be a help to anyone, but I'll include it just in case."
"D: Not as drinkable as it could be, a little heavy and despite the booze being almost unnoticeable it still has such a heavy bourbon element that it slows the drinking."
"I definitely recommend this brew if you like whiskey, bourbon and stouts. One of the best ways I could describe this beer would be to take the syrup they use to mix up coke products, mix it with whiskey, and drink it. Its sweet and spicy with a bit of roasty bitterness. Totally worth the money."
"It's not miles away from Southern Tier Oat, with the added bourbon touch and less molasses. Both rank high personally, but I feel that I had to put more of an effort in to get this one down. Maybe I should share it if the opportunity for a next time comes."
"I did, in fact, enjoy the beer. I think over time, I'd probably enjoy it even more. The Bourbon and sweetness was just a bit too much for me to drink this very often. I'd like to try it again after it was cellared for a while."
"This stout will age well for some time to come. It's already like a fine port - totally decadent!"
"Wow, what a Stout. Pours black as the blackest night, light appears to be drawn into it like a massive black hole. The strong alcohol/Bourbon/Chocolate tastes are electric. This beer is not for the faint of heart. For me this is the ultimate stout, I LOVE THIS BEER."
"D: Sipped this one slooowly. Very ""hot"" right now. Great beer, but definitely needs some age to mellow the alcohol out."
"D - Well, normally I would say I could only drink one, or split it with someone, but I had the opportunity to go to a party that had a pony keg of this. 1/2 glass pours and still had a hell of a hangover, so watch it with this one."
"Overall I enjoyed the experience and there are certainly signs that this could become a good, even great beer with some age on it. But right now it's just too hot and bourbon ridden for me to love it. I have three bottles left and I plan on tasting them at different junctures during the next 2 to 3 years. I will update this review at those points in time."
"This stuff is black liquid gold. Usually I drink a Imperial Stout and get pretty much the same taste with slight variations in each. This beer is completely left field of any other Imperial Stout. Almost a style of it's own."
"Overall an impressive beer. Not the darkest or strongest aged stout I've had but its aroma and character are definitely unique. I bought it at the suggestion of a friend and will be buying it again."
"Pours a pitch-black with a tiny caramel colored head that vanishes right away. Aromas if extremely rich. Tons of dark, overripe fruits, raisins, plums...vanilla bean, oak, molasses, maple syrup, the list goes on and on. Very in your face aroma and I think I smelled this beer for about 5 minutes before I even took a sip. Tastes is even more jaw-dropping and complex. Initial flavors of overripe fruits ala rasins, figs, and the like. Then steps in HUGE flavors of vanilla, coffee, chocolate, slight oakiness, nutty, roasty, molasses....absolutely phenomenal. This beer has one of the most amazing lingering aftertastes of any beer I have ever had. Mouthfeel is also ridiculous. Definitely one of the top 3 most viscous beers I have ever had as well. I can literally feel this beer coating my mouth. I feel like I have to chew it before swallowing. Light on the carbonation but seems perfect for this brew. Nice warmth in the finish. I cannot stop smelling and tasting this beer, sip after sip...and that;s a dangerous thing at 13%. Definitely one of the most amazing beers I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy. I only bought a single 12oz bottle to see if it was worth the price as I am often very skeptical nowadays. But this beer delivers in spades. Time to stock up. I can only imagine what this beer will offer with some years on it. Gawdayum!"
"D - Extremely enjoyable beer, top notch in the style and I will certainly be buying this again, totally worth the price."
"D: For all I have said about the conflicting duality of this beer, the drinkability is really quite good for a 13% Goliath. That said, if I had more than one, I'd be pretty wacky."
"Drinkability: I only wish I could drink this all night. One or two max will make one happy. I gave one to my Dad a year ago and I have never heard the man talk so much in a night."
"The beer poured ink-black and syrupy with a thin, creamy brown head into a chalice. The initial whiff was of Bourbon, oak, and vanilla, with the Bourbon aroma dominating. A big Bourbon flavor, with fainter oak and vanilla components and alcoholic esters - surprisingly smooth given the high ABV. The mouthfeel was pretty thick and oily, with low carbonation and nice lacing down the glass. A really potent stout, obviously, but surprisingly drinkable."
"This is delicious and very drinkable. Met and exceeded my expectations."
"D: What more can I say? Bourbon County Stout is so complex yet so well balanced. So many aromas, flavors and a complex finish/mouthfeel that all blend together with near flawless precision. It's almost perfect.... Almost."
"Its definatly a sipper. The booze is strong, but its more from the bourbon presence than the overall ABV. Actually the more you drink the more it smooths out and becomes just a nice tasty warmth. Now this review is of a 2009 vintage, bottled on 2/18/09. I would imagine another year would make it even smoother. With that said, I can't think a fresh one would be very easy to get down with all of the booze and bourbon. But if you can find an aged one, pick it up!! Its one of the most unique stouts I have had, buts its not one for those who don't like the uniqeness of the bourbon flavor."
"This beer was really teriffic. I highly reccomend picking one up yourself. Probably the best beer I've had from Goose Island."
"Drinkability: I wouldnt drink more than a bomber of this, but its easy to drink. High abv and huge complex flavors make this perfect with food and its delicious enough to have by itself."
"D - Dangerously drinkable. Please don't drive after this, because you'll surely have more than one of these. 5.0"
"Before I drank this I had imagined what perfect bourbon stout would taste like, and this is pretty close. Certainly one of the best stouts I've had. Try this if you haven't (though I think most of you have)."
"I got this from Dunt in a BIF. I poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours a thick, jet black with a thin tan head. There are huge notes of bourbon on the nose. Upfront the flavor of booze is prevalent. It mellows out on the finish, with some sweetness and hints of vanilla. The beer is full bodied and an all night sipper. Truly a great beer."
"Came in a 7 oz short glass, with a rich brown head atop a thick black beer. Smelled sweet of bourbon and a bit of malt. The beer was well balanced with bourbon and malt falling wonderfully across the palate. The alcoholic character was very evident, although was balanced with the sipping nature that this beer became."
"D - Very, very, scarily drinkable. Its a sipper that I find myself going for a bit more heavily than I should. Will pick this up whenever I see it."
"Out of a bomber bottle generously provided to me by a BA friend this brew was as thick and dark as molasses. The retention of the head was good and the lacing impressive. Swirling it in my tulip, it moved like chocolate milk, so rich and viscous it was, only black and oily. The aroma was rich and enticing; I smelled chocolate, tobacco, whiskey, oiled leather, coffee, dark caramel and hints of vanilla. The flavor profile was equally complex and robust. Again, I tasted that zip of bourbon whiskey, this time right from the start, followed by the dark chocolate and chocolate syrup flavors. I also tasted leather, dark malt, molasses, coffee, leather, prunes and the alcohol punch. As it warmed up some elements of wood and vanilla appeared reflecting the oak barrel aging. The sharp, punchy elements were off set by the soft, chocolaty elements creating a nice balance. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body full and the carbonation appropriate enough to help it feel full without being heavy. A truly enjoyable brew and well worth going out of one's way for."
"This beer has improved a great deal with one year of aging! I was not crazy about it a first due to the harsh taste of alcohol but I am going to buy some 2009 for my cellar and get some more 2008 if it is still available!"
"D- Pretty thick & filling. I enjoyed this beer thoroughly but I almost want to drink a glass of water afterward so that I dont drink another one of these and fall over"
"It is a sipper, it will only get better with age, I also have an 08 cellaring, it will make a nice vertical once they keep coming, it is a great but hot beer when it is fresher though."
"BCS is, to put it mildly, some serious shit. Yet while you do feel the 13%, it's so good, who cares?"
"This is a sipper. You do not want to rush this beer and it only gets better as it warms. I would also recomend a good strong funky cheese to go with it to ""clense your palete"" every once in a while."
"D- Very drinkable, but probably better that I opened the 12oz. vs. the 22oz. I had. It packed a punch like expected, but don't think I could have handle a 22 in one sitting."
"2009 Re-rate. The bourbon is much more balanced in previous years. The smoothed out vanilla and oak character combined with a nice creamy body, as opposed to a more oily mouth feel in past years, adds up to a truly nice beer. I couldn't believe I sat down and drank a whole bomber of this stuff!"
"overall my second brew from goose and i really like this...i love my stouts but this is one that would have to be taken in stride and not taken advantage of ..."
"This is an amazing brew...my expectations were high, and they were certainly met."
"Pours it's own version of black with a small amount of a tannish-head. I am not in no means a bourbon drinker but the smell overwhelms the senses in a good way. With a hint of vanilla and something like a maplewood sausage that blended well with the bourbon. I took my time drinking it sip by sip dreaming I could disect it and re-create it(right). Drink it on a semi-full stomach with some time to spend."
"Impression: A good stout, full of flavor, but too sweet, and not as interesting as others. I will not get it again, though if you like a sweet big stout you ought to try this."
"Beer pours jet black with and surprisingly has a decent amout of head. Can already tell this is a serious beer. The smell is rich malt, with a hint of burboun. The taste is very complex. Starts with sweet complex malt maybe a hint of dark chocolate, and finishes with a sweet then warming bourbon flavor. The mouthfeel is thick but smooth, no issues here. The drinkability is a bit of an issue, as the bourbon taste and booziness can start to get to you after a few sips. Overall an exellent beer though."
"I was lucky enough to try this one straight from a cask at Goose Island's Wrigleyville location. There's stouts, big stouts, and then there's ridiculous stouts. This is one of the last. Big in every way. Really big. Like a black hole, it absorbs so much light that it cannot be seen, only the dark area around the beer can be observed with the naked eye. Huge notes of bourbon, malt, malt, and more roasted malt. It's lightly hopped, but heavy on the ethanol. The malt does much to hide its monstrous 13% AVB, but nothing short of a preemptive carbohydrate feast will mitigate it's effects. If it's your first time, I don't recommend taking this one on without a friend and a safety word. Until you've learned how this beer will affect you, you should not drive, operate heavy machinery, or call ex-girlfriends on BCS."
"Pours dark brown to black with no head. The aroma is bourbon, molasses, roasted malt and a little bit of soy sauce. The flavor is roasted malt, chocolate, oak, bourbon and some light soy sauce. Medium mouthfeel, low carbonation and a hot alcohol presence. Very good beer."
" The tongue is dazzled by the huge malty complexity with all of the usual suspects: Thick hershey's syrup with some sweet and bitter aspects, graham crackers, wet-earth, musty fruits, caramel and the kind of heat that will remove paint. A dry, leafy peppery hop balance can found nearly hidden under the rest, but it does provide a decent balance to all of this malt power. The viscosity is high with high heat and huge complexity, sip this puppy."
"Overall this is a fantastic beer. Rich, thick and an intense amount of complex flavors. Definitely of the top stouts I've had."
"The mouth feel is thick with a huge residual sugar content. The low carbonation compliments the richness of the bourbon character. Drinkability is only average at this point since for me the huge alcohol presence is a barrier. I've drank a two year aged version before and it had mellowed significantly. Next time I crack open a bottle of the 07 I will do a review."
"I'd like to sip this all night even after this bottle, but i can't help but save the other bottles for enjoyment the rest of the week."
"Thanks Goose Island for giving me a second chance to enjoy your Bourbon County Stout. Definitely a world class beer."
"D: I have mixed feelings on this beer. Out of the gate, it's simply not ready to drink (IMO). I love the strong bourbon flavors, but it is too solventy for my tastes."
"I'm suddenly inspired to paint my face blue and and speak with a Gaelic accent..."
"O- This beer was well worth the wait. An exceptional bourbony beer and one I hope to be able to have again."
"I probably need to try this again as a late night sipper rather than my first beer when I arrived at the bar in the late afternoon. It's a very strong stout, which, in my opinion doesn't do a great job of balancing the alcohol. Color was great, good carbonation that was surprisingly light for how dark the color was. Aroma is also very good. Again, the only problem is the strong alcohol taste that needs more hops and malt to balance it."
"Overall- a perfect sipper. complex and intriguing. 12 oz in plenty (took 2 hours to drink). much better as it warms up."
"D - This is just about as drinkable as you can get for a 13% abv beer yeah you can taste the alcohol but this beer is very smooth making it easy to drink this is a must try before you die beer"
"D - This has held up fantastically over the last 2 years. I could drink BCS every night if I was able to. I didn't expect this thing to hold up this nicely. Fantastic."
"the drinkability is pretty great as far as beers this big go. the 13% abv isn't present at all other than a slight warming on the tongue and at the back fo the throat. an absolutely phenomenal beer. if you don't like it you're probably a jerk."
"D: drinkability is a relative term here, I could drink it forever, taking my time sipping it. very filling beer though."
"Overall, just an incredible beer in all reasons. I had this bottle without aging, I saved another for in a couple years. The flavors manage to be strong, forceful, and great on their own, but meld together to be better than the sum of their parts. Almost flawless. Layered and complex. A true masterpiece. Higher than highly recommended."
"In my opinion, kudos to these fellas, splendid ""rogue diamond"" sort of beer. Too many things put together in the right order, sort of like NYC."
"Overall: Of Bourbon Barrel aged beers this certainly sits as one of my favorites. The bourbon character is well pronounced without being overwhelming. Aroma and flavor character runs the gamut from warm alcohol and bourbon spice to malt and chocolate richness. The combination of bourbon character and a rich imperial stout make this an excellent example of bourbon barrel aging."
"I am tempted to take just a half a notch off of this one if only for it's excessive abv. but resisted due to it's exceptional flavor/feel and smell. Possibly one of the best Imp. Stouts brewed(that i've tried anyway), at least after a year of rest. Interested to try fresh as well as 2 years."
"Poured into a snifter, 2009 batch 12oz bottle. Apears black in the glass with a small carmel colored head like a stout should. Smell is dominated by chocolate and bourbon. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy like a guiness without all the carbonation. The taste is chocolate,bourbon and coffee. I have to take an issue with the alchol burn though, it is the one thing that takes the drinkability down. The KBS i had earlier didnt have nearly as much of a burn and hid the alchol much bettter. So far this is the second best stout i have had, maybe in 6 months i will have another to see if is a llitle smoother."
"Overall, an absolutely delicious beer. This is what I look for when I think barrel-aged imperial stout. A complex and interesting sipper. Will certainly have again."
"A rich and flavorful beer experience. I really like this as a sipper. Another reason to appreciate this beer is that it's year round! ""Goose Island keep it coming""."
"D: Overall drinkability is amazing considering the high ABV. At eleven dollars a bottle I wouldn't buy this often, but I'd buy it -- this is one of the few beers I could see actually being worth that kind of cost."
"At the temperature I drank this wonderful brew, the mouthfeel is smooth and easily drinkable from that standpoint. This is a dessert beer and I'm not sure I'd want it any other way. It's very sweet and high in alcohol. It is what it is."
"Drinkability - Very rich and filling. A slow sipper, but quite enjoyable. I believe this is the richest beer I've had; tremendously delicious, but one at a time is plenty."
"Overall, it's the perfect beer to sip in small quantities. Amazing flavors come from what seemed like it might just be a common good beer and turned out to be much more."
"An amazing beer all around. I think I'd need hours to taste every flavor in this super complex beer. I can't wait to compare the 2007, 2008, and 2009 vintages!"
"PS. My boxer loved it, too. I've never seen her lap up beer this fast. She's got great taste. Must've gotten it from her daddy."
"*=ideas from fellow taster"
"This beer is a sipper, but you will raise the glass frequently. As exquisite and complex of a beer as I've experienced. This beer now enjoys a spot in my Top 5. I can only imagine what some age would do."
"The feel of this beer is pretty darn heavy but it does have a bit of a smoothness that was enjoyable. It does leave a warm feeling on the way down and has a bit of a kick. Fantastic."
"I think this one could age for an eternity and continue to evolve."
"d - I really enjoyed this beer. It's one of the better bourbon stouts I've had and if you are a fan of whiskey like me, this is a definite must-try. Because of the 13% ABV I wouldn't drink too many at once but it sure tastes great."
"Overall, one of my favorite Imperial Stouts that gets you buzzin' after just one glass!"
"Strong, yet delicate, rich flavors and well balanced, there's not much not to like about this beer. Not much I can say other than I like it. A great deal. And, it's worth the pretty penny."
"D - So stong but yet nice. Some will say week more will say wow!! a must try and then your own opinin will agree."
"D-While it is a sipper, it goes down way too easy for the pretty high ABV. This is the beer that got me into BA (I registered while drinking my first one) and it's a fitting beer to review for no. 100. Even after almost a year and a half this is still a bourbon-y delight but much of the alcohol ""heat"" has diminished."
"And if the price tag were not $22 for a four-pack, I would be much happier with it. An almost perfect beer."
"If we're looking at ratings only, Bourbon County is my top-rated beer now. I am almost on the floor crying over this discovery. Goose Island, I didn't expect much, but you stepped up and blew me away with this one. If you like bourbon beers...find it before the secret gets leaked!"
"- I found this one hard to drink. Certainly a sipper, and one to let warm up a bit. I have 2 more aging as I think a few years on them will certainly help in this department."
"Drinkability: At 13%, clearly I couldn't drink a ton of it, but I would gladly try to... I'm glad I finally gave this one a shot, even though I've been aging a few bottles for a while now, but it's going to be hard to wait on it now."
"Overall, quite an interesting taste but ABV limits drinkability. A definite sipper. Worth trying [unless you hate bourbon]."
"Notes: Quite the remarkable bourbon barrel stout (Jim Beam barrels?), maybe it does not deserve the hype, and hunting frenzy I saw in some quarters last time it arrived to DC, but it is a great brew nevertheless, nice to share and/or cellar for a while."
"Pours a deep, thick black with a very thin brown head that dissipated quickly. Aroma thick of bourbon with a hint of chocolate, toffee, toasted malts, a hint of coffee, and bitter-sweet. Tastes heavy of bourbon with some hints of caramel, coffee, chocolate, and a bitter-sweet alcohol finish. Very tasty!"
"D- A fantastic sipping beer; perfect for a cold winter's day."
"D - What a difference a year makes...tried this when it was fresh last year and found it almost undrinkable from the bourbon heat. After a year of aging, the bourbon heat has mellowed considerably. This is a much more well rounded beer. This is really impressive...has to be one of the best impys out there. Don't think I could have more than one, but this is pretty smooth. Really enjoying this one. Now I know for sure - age my BCS at least a year."
"Drinkability: This was a very enjoyable drink, though dangerously smooth for its whopping 13% ABV."
"D- This is a sipper at best. I always have a hard time finishing this beer although I am very fond of it. One about every couple of months seems to be the route I take with this monster of a beer."
"If you can afford it, I would buy some 09's and age them a year and open them about this time next year, as for me I am planning to buy more next payday so I can do 3 and 4 year verticals down the line."
"Overall this has to be one of the richest and most complex beers that I have ever had. I must say that this on-tap version added a bit to the mouthfeel as well as to smoothing out the bourbon and increasing the complexity with a greater degree of chocolate. If you can try this on-tap, do yourself a favor and try it. Looking forward to case of the 2009 with a little age on it. My highest recommendation."
"More drinkable than one might expect, but the sweetness and dominance of the alcohol are bit much. Maybe with aging this beer will round out. Goes down with a wonderful warming, all around great beer for a cold winter day."
"D - There is a reason I hardly remember that night at RnH, because this is way too drinkable for 13%! Well done GI"
"D - Another one to add to a fantastic year of dark beers, this one will be added to my list of needed beers, congrats to Goose Island, just cannot stand some of this money goes to AB-InBev"
"This is a wonderful beer."
"This is a very good, very bold Double Stout. Lots of everything going on, could use a bit more hop bitterness though."
"Beer is thick and has a great strong liquor presence to it. There is a strong roast character that comes up after the initial sweetness and alcohol of the bourbon. There is decent connectivity between the two flavors. The roast is not an aftertaste but a really late back flavor, there is no aftertaste. Second taste, the carbonation plays on the tongue a little, if there were more it may be better. Overall drinkability is good and so is mouthfeel. I want to try the 2009 for comparison."
"The beer has upper low carbonation, and a thick, creamy, silky, velvety, smooth, and sticky mouthfeel. I wish I'd cellared more of these."
"Poured a opaque blackish brown with a small foamy, creamy tan head, decent retention, small amount of sticking. Aromas of boozy bourbon, vanilla, caramel, dark berry and fig esters that meshes with alcohol, toffee and caramelized sugar, a very light charcoal and a hint of smoke. Good moderate carbonation and a crisp, dryish, oily slick, chewy, creamy smooth full bodied mouthfeel. A delicious sipper, coffee, caramel toffee, roasted grains, vanilla barrel flavor and a little charred wood, a subtle berry fruitiness, the alcohol is pretty well balanced, presence, but only providing a low temperature warmth that increases the drinkability, not a hot alcohol taste bud killer, towards the end earthy grains and oak woody flavors emerges, the hops are pretty laid back, and a dryish caramel malty and vanilla barrel finish, quite enjoyable overall."
"and a uniquely memorable ""extreme beer"" experience."
"one of my favorite styles. bourbon aged stouts. 100 days aged. thank you goose island. either you love em or you hate em...or you think they are just ok. A-ok in my book. their IPA is safe, and so is their harvest. the Belgium styles are hit or miss. i guess i just need to go to the brewery. i live only a couple of hours from chicago, and there are a ton of beers they have on their profile page that im not familiar with. ok, back to the behemoth. i drank this one at a local watering hole called the 'black sparrow'. hipster bar close to my house. as tina fey says 'it's hard to tell the difference between hipsters and homeless. they all have beards, wear plaid, and ride bikes.' they also all drink PBR... not that there is anything wrong with that. 'NO CRAP ON TAP!' is the motto down at the sparrow and they ain't kidding. this is why i am constantly finding myself there. I heard rumors of dogfish head world wide stout kegged there and i was very excited. the bartender informed me that i just missed the worldwide but they just tapped the bourbon county so i didn't burn the place down. a little too smokey in there to fully enjoy it but it was BIG. alcohol was present but you almost always get that with the bourbon. dark dark dark.dominated by chocolate and booze. the mouthfeel is perfect. more please"
"Definitely a one bomber type of beer, couldn't do more than that. I actually would've preferred to split this one, but I don't regret it."
"I've had this a couple times and this is a great bourbon stout.Bourbon presence and chocolate vanilla and some oak as well.Smooth but does pack some alcohol puch. If you are a big stout fan like myself this is a must try for you..the 09 version is more boozy than previous releases and might need to be aged for a couple years to mellow.."
"Pours pitch black into a tulip at the Sunset Grill. It has a pinky sized dark tan head that resides fairly quickly, probably the barrel aging. Lacing is also fairly non existant, as with most barrel aged beers I have had. Smells of oak, strong whiskey,vanilla in the whiskey and some cocoa, seems like the standard barrel stout. Would like some more strength in the elements besides the whiskey. Tastes of nice cocoa and whiskey blend with some oak and vanilla, a burnt taste at the end adds a nice element. Some brown sugar sweetness is also nice. Mouthfeel is pretty thick and oily. A coat of whiskey cocoa onAa the tongue with some huge heat. Low carbonation helps this kind of beer. Drinkability is good for a whiskey aged beer. Seems like this one is the standard whiskey aged brew. Gonna age my bottle for a while and enjoy this one again on a nice holiday."
"D: This is a 12 OZ bottle you may want to split with somone. very tasty but quite the sipper. also - I wouldent reccomend this with food, ciggars or anything like that. this is a special occasion beer and one to be enjoyed only in the company of other beer geeks :)"
"D- The heat from the alcohol and the booziness is excessive. I couldn't drink more than a bottle of this... at least when served fresh. With a bit of age on it, I would imagine that the drinkability would improve considerably."
"D: This is in the top few beers I've ever had. Despite its fairly formidable price point, I know I'll be buying it again and again. My next quest in life becomes to find a vintage. Absolutely world class, and it nudges Brooklyn Black Chocolate out of its top stout spot on my list."
"However, there are some bottles I have had that exhibit no soy sauce, and approach heaven-on-earth in their drinkability. Best thing to do when your B.C.S. exhibits slight degrees of soy sauce: don't let it warm too much and share it with others."
"Drinkability - This is a terrific drink with maybe a bit too much going on."
"This one is a sipper, very drinkable, enjoyable, and would be ever so good on the deck while enjoying a fine cigar. This is one of my favorite imperial stouts and I'm a sucker for the ones aged in bourban or whiskey barrels."
"Poured from a much to cold 22 oz '09. The appearance is jet black and inky. The smell is of straight bourbon barrels, with hints of cocoa and vanilla. The taste started off as bourbon, though as it warmed up it started to mellow out and the flavors just sprang forth. I caught chocolate followed, by hints of both vanilla and coffee. The feel is my mouth is creamy followed by a slow elegant burn to finish. I could have had another bottle, except that I would rather age the other one I have. Definitely an exceptional brew."
"D- This is a joke at 13%; I could drink it all day and all night. It is a thick chewy BA stout, but it goes down nice and easy leaving me wishing I had picked up a few more bottles."
"D: This was definitely an epic beer. The flavors were incredible. I really don't care for bourbon, but this beer makes me want a rematch. I was really taken aback with this beer. I'm gonna collect a few more years and try my vertical that i have in my cellar. In the meantime, I may pick up another 4 pack of this years batch. If you haven't tried this, you must. My drinking partner tonight was a novice and even loved it. GO BUY THIS NOW!"
"For me when it come to BA Big Stouts this is what I measure all others against. Next up will be the Abyss."
"A great beer to savor and enjoy. I'd like to drink another, but with the high ABV one per night is good."
"Drinkability - First sip I was not ready but as I sat with it for a while the complexity became more and more apparent and more and more deep. An amazing beer but hard to handle - I think if it was just slightly less alcoholic and they let the flavor come through a little more I would be completely satisfied. Amazing beer though."
"D- not a bad beer but def. a sipper, my 1st bourbon barrel aged, could prob. use some aging"
"Thick, viscous feel. Like drinking syrup. Very low carbonation level. The ABV is noticeable, but not enough to make this an unpleasant drinking experience. Half of the bomber took well over an hour to drink - this is definitely a slow sipper, meant to be savored. Can't wait to get my hands on more bottles to age."
"D-I could drink this all day, awesome flavor, great mouthfeel, well hidden alcohol with a nice warming, chewy and thick...give me more!"
"D: Too boozy to have more than one but the flavor is exquisite and this sets the curve for BBA stouts IMO. The only other one I enjoyed more was KBS"
"D - It is a very nice stout and seems like a good choice to share for the holiday with family and friends. I wouldn't slam the bottle by any means nor drink more than one at a time, but I am very much enjoying it."
"Mouthfeel is full and creamy. A bit chewy and syrupy."
"A mouth coater for sure. And a sipper. You just cannot take big swills, not would you want to. The slow drinking necessity extends the pleasure of this beverage. Only drawback -- this 12 0z. brew (bought in MA) cost me $7.00. Very much a special treat for me, and more than likely I will pine for this when I see it, but won't spend the money again. Everyone who loves stout -- hell, everyone who loves beer should try this once. I can only imaging what a year or two of aging would do to this."
"This is one amazing beer. I have had this beer in two consecutive years and both years are very good. Aging is recommended and from the reviews it is a good choice."
"I'm actually surprised that this 2006 bottle tastes almost identical to the new 2009 ones, but I'm not complaining. A great beer for sure."
"Sad to see this bottle go. Shocked to see it was 13%. Excellent all around."
"Pleasantly surprised with this beer!"
"Pours jet black with very mild carbonation. Nose is coffee, bourbon, molasses, candy, and chocolate. Flavor starts with chewy, caramel candy, transitions to vanilla soda, a coffee finish, with hot alcohol on the exhale. One of the thickest, creamiest feels, and a burnt, stickiness on the aftertaste. Almost certainly the most bourbon from any ""bourbon"" stout I've had."
"D: a slight toning down of the bourbon aspect would go over well, although this is an otherwise tasty beer."
"D: I mentioned to someone it's just a bit ""too big"""
"D- Definatley a sipper! This beer is pushing the envelope but does it very well, tons of smell, flavor and a extremley thick mouthfell. It's quite delicious but I can olny drink one every once in a while, and enjoy the hell out of it every time!"
"D: Even though the alcohol has died down quite a bit in a year+, it's still a big, big beer. I need to go out and buy more of this, because I see this only getting better."
"D: Pretty drinkable for how bold it is, the alcohol doesn't come out strongly at all, I honestly think this is so delicious I could do the entire four pack in a night. Possibly the best beer I've had."
"A little goes a long way with this one. A 12oz bottle is more than enough. I'd actually prefer to share even that size bottle. I do look forward to aging the remainder of these bottles as I hope it mellows the most intense aspects and doesn't hurt the things I most enjoy."
"Drinkability is original, its a pleasure to drink for being so big, thick and boozy. Nothing better for a winter warmer or a night cap."
"D - A heavy brew to be sure, best to take it slow. Overall one, if not the, best stout I've tried."
"Solid look, pitch black but with a white head, no lacing. Nose is big - licorice, chocolate. Flavor is monsterous as well, and incredible. Licorice, again, no booze at all, chocolate, bourbon on the back of the tongue. Roasted malt, a touch of coffee, dried fruit, nearly smoky at times. Near perfect, flavor-wise. Body is think and full, nearly creamy. An excellent beer that I would have again in a second - looking forward to trying it aged."
"This was for 2009 and pre-editions fo BCBS. Other than a brief uptick in 2011, this beer has become slightly harsh with noticeable alcohol burn. Frankly, it feels like less time is done blending and selecting barrels than there used to be. Don't get me wrong, it is still good beer, just not what it was and worth the ever increasing hype. Now, it would probably rate closer to a 4.2 or 4.3 for me."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again but I would only recommend this to those who seek rich dark malt profiles, dark sweet fruit and a subtle earthiness."
"Pours an dark, dark brown color with just a touch of dark tan head that faded quickly without any real lacing. Smells like a glass of bourbon; medicinal with some smokey notes mixed in. The alcohol hits you right away and warms your mouth. After the initial shock, the complexity of the beer comes out. With-in a thick, creamy body lies flavors of vanilla and caramel along with some hints of the malt before the alcohol makes a reappearance on the finish. This is a really complex, cool beer, but I don't think I could drink more than one. Definitely going to cellar a few bottles and see how it ages."
"D - Definitely a dessert sipper beer. Overall probably the best bourbon stout ever."
"This is an exceptional beer. I'd like to try this fresh, curious as to how much more intense the bourbon/oak is."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is just ok. the high abv acompanied with the oily mouthfeel makes it a little hard to swallow. Overall, I'm glad I'm sharing this 12 0z. bottle, but a good example of a barrel aged brew. Skal."
"This is a world-class stout...delicious and powerful."
"My first review... I should have been working up to this beer. I love beer, whiskey, and wine. Frankly, I'm not sure which one this falls under. I had my wife do a ""blind smelling", she thought it was a wine or whiskey. The bourbon flavor is immediate. My palate is more geared toward wine right now so all I can say is this is extremely enjoyed this stout. Dark as night with the slightest silky head. The bourbon is what made me a fan. Old Van Winkle 12 year ""lot B""... Yum"
"via duffextracold"
"All in all, this is one of my faves. Nice unique flavor that is not too over the top or too light. This would definitely be a great dessert beer."
"(original tasting) 2008 - Bottle. So black light won't go through, and a nice lingering dark brown head. The aroma is endless with sweet malt, oak, vanilla, tannins, a touch of bourbon, and a dash of alcohol. The flavor delivers big sweet malts and a dash of alcohol upfront followed by hints of candied fruit and finishing with a lingering definite coffee flavor layered with chocolates. I have since tried this a few times and am aging two more bottles. This stuff is simply amazing and everyone should try it. One of my favorite beers."
"F: Still pretty sweet and super thick. It never really leaves as it leaves a huge thick coat on the mouth. It leaves a new layer like my body created a new layer of skin, but only super thick beer. A slight lingering bourbon flavor, but it's mostly the chocolate, vanilla, and caramel. The crazy dark heavy richness of this makes Ozzy look like a church. OK, enough with the bad reference, but this beer is ridiculously thick and luscious, as well as delicious! Thanks again Paul."
"D - Very drinkable brew that remains rich and complex. This beer is definitely meant to be savored."
"D: its drinkable its think its one to savor don't gulp this one!"
"This is a great beer. The one detractor is the alcoholic taste in the beer. I figured this would have mellowed out quite a bit after being stored for three years, but it is still very present. The rest of the beer, however, has certainly smoothed over time as all of the flavors overlap each other to make a truly delightful brew. Definitely a beer I will continue to drink."
"Overall: Got to love bourbon and thankfully I do because the flavor is there in this tough as nails stout."
"This is certainly a beer that only a quality craft brewer could produce. Good on Goose Island for putting out such fine stuff."
"This is a very well balanced beer. The bourbon is smooth and melds well. I will be seeking out a four pack of this soon."
"I like this offering from Goose Island a lot!!! Great bourbon flavor without being to overpowering. Great job!!"
"I understand why this beer is coveted, because it is ridiculously extreme, but holy detritus, this is not enjoyable in quantity unless you're sharing."
"Really would be a CHALLENGE to have a whole bomber in a sitting of this. I am very thankful I bought a 4 pack of 12oz. I will probably be putting the other three in the cellar to let them cool down a bit."
"D: As with most high quality Bourbon barrel aged stouts, this one is a tasty and complex sipper. I will definitely have this again, but I wouldn't drink more than one in a sitting. I'll definitely put a few of these in the cellar as well and see how they taste in a year or two."
"Jet black and very viscuous to pour. No real carbonation or head to speak of. Just the way this pours kicks it up a notch in my book. Heavy bourbon aroma with quite a boozy smell to it. Long lingering vanilla/oak smell. Huge roasted and imperial stout like flavor with the most intense bourbon flavors I have ever had in a beer. Over the top but not in a bad way. Even has the slight alcohol burn that you get in spirits-not like an overly alcoholic beer. Lingering burnt and bitter flavors-deep dark chocolate and roasted malt. Great body-thick and full. The alcohol flavor leaves quite the tingling sensation. A great beer all around. Quite in your face but well balanced in the long run. Could not do it all night by any stretch but still damn enjoyable."
"D-one of the few stouts as robust as the bourbon county that I can easily knock back for hours. This may be too big for some people, but for the true stout connoisseur this will be an enjoyable treat. I just wish I bought more than one bottle, now I'm kicking myself in the dick for it."
"A wonderful beer. A buddy and I saw this at the store in a four pack for 20 bucks, but we opted for two singles first to try it. I think I will go back for the 4 pack!"
"Pours a jet black in the glass with a creamy tan froth that dissipates quickly... decent lacing that doesn't really stick to the glass. Pronounced aromas of molasses, caramel, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, chocolate, hints of blueberries (weird, but there), cherry pop tart (also weird, but there), sweet-sweet alcohol, & light smoke. (Can't really detect much of a hop presence, but know it's there to balance out the sweetness of this beer.) The nose is full, sweet, and pretty. The beer has a syrupy texture, alcohol sweetness/burn/tingle, complexity, depth, and a long finish. Overall a very good beer that is extremely thick and syrupy sweet. Due to it's huge alcohol content, the beer is a bit off balanced and not exactly smooth. Although I'm not a huge fan of this beer (esp for $12 a bottle), I can appreciate the effort here and look forward to having this with my Rib eye tonight!"
"Had the 2008 and 2009 side by side for this one which I've been excited to do for quite some time. Poured into a snifter it pours jet black and thick like motor oil with a one finger dark tan head. The head quickly fades away and leaves little to no lacing down the glass. The smell is whiskey at first and upfront, it's followed by vanilla, oak, and chocolate. It seemed like the 2008 had more of a whiskey smell to it at first and as they warmed up the 2009 became more whiskey smelling and the 2008 had more chocolate when warming up. Taste was whiskey, vanilla, and chocolate. The 2009 had more of a whiskey taste while the 2008 had more of a chocolate taste making the 2008 way more drinkable and pleasant to drink. Both however had some whiskey in the taste it just wasn't as apparent with the age on the 2008. The mouthfeel differed greatly, the 2009 was kind of thin and the 2008 was very full, thick, and chewy. I thought it was pretty awesome how different these were with only one year between them. The main difference was taste and mouthfeel and with the one year it made it from a good beer to a great beer! I've also had this with about six months age on it and it was pretty good. The drinkability depends on this one. Fresh I'd give it a lower score (but still good) but with some age it become great even with the high ABV I'd love to drink a few of these. Overall fresh it's really good but I'd really recommend aging these for at least a year if not longer as it becomes more delicious. I'm going to age a few more of my 2008s for a while and I have plenty of 2009s to age and drink. Really great beer overall which coming from Goose Island I was expecting it anyways."
"D: This one is definitely a sipper. It has a powerful warming sensation after the swallow from all of the bourbon in it. It's not a chore to drink, but it's not one that I would want to drink all the time either."
"As someone who staggers through the night casting aside lesser beers in an unholy quest for that huge, chewy, sweet, powerful masterpiece, I am humbled in the presence of this superb, cruel, terrifying, glorious beer. It kisses you as it beats you. This is the one bourbon barrel aged stout to rule them all."
"Pours a clear light brown color with ruby red highlights and a thin lacy tan head. The nose is a light aroma of sweet malt with a background aroma of bourbon. Begins with a subtle grapefruit flavor which is followed by robust whiskey/alcohol flavor. Throughout the drink, there is a nice backbone of sweet malt/toffee flavors and a warming alcohol sensation. The mild full body has low carbonation levels and is very drinkable. The finish fades gracefully with a strong bourbon taste which is well balanced between sweet and dry."
"Pours a deep, viscous black motor oil with a thin, dark brown head that retains poorly and leaves little lacing. There are smells of raisin and bourbon with some almond. There is a strong bourbon, very heavy alcohol and bourbon taste with heavy, dark chocolate and a really full body. Alcohol goes right up the nose and produces some quince and vanilla on the mouth with a slick, but not syrupy, feel. A bit difficult to finish due to the sheer complexity and slightly sour bourbon components to the malt. Nevertheless, I would drink several of these in a sitting if they weren't so damn strong."
"Drinkability is less than average. How many beers actually taste like liquor? It's a novelty brew, and a good one. I'd like to keep one on hand to occasionally show the buddies. I know its aim is not everyday sessions, but it's not a real pleasant-drinkin' brew. It hits harder than 13%; in fact, it ain't far off from the 40% of its liquor counterpart. If you're just lookin' for a punch, perhaps you should consider the liquor approach."
"Overall, it's a fantastic brew but the high ABV and boozy character makes it tough to drink more than a bottle."
"The mouth is creamy smooth. No carbonation bite at all. This is a big-time bourbon beer! Huge sweet vanilla notes, some oak, and malted chocolate. The liquor quality hasn't worn off very much after a year in the cellar. Alcohol is very present in the flavor. This is a very good beer, but I could not drink any more than this 12oz. Too boozy for me."
"Drinkability: This beer is delicious and very drinkable (despite the high alcohol). Unlike some bourbon stouts, this one is well balanced and the bourbon character is there without overpowering the beer."
"I'm now drinking my last bottle from this batch, and still have the same question. I like Bourbon, so I like this beer, but if I wanted to drink a stout this would not be my choice. The Bourbon still over powers this beer and the flavors and aromas are still all about the Bourbon."
"D - So ridiculously drinkable for a 13%. You could easily just chug a bottle of this, although that would be a waste. Awesome beer."
"D- Definitely a sipper. sit back and enjoy this one for a while."
"I will certainly put some of this on the shelf for future use, it will certainly improve with age."
"This is one big beer (2009 edition). Sampled it the other night at crown liquors and talked to the guy in charge of brewing it so i figured i'd sit down and work through one tonight. Poured into a DFH snifter. Poured a tar like black with a finger of tan head. Nose of BOURBON! with alcohol and coffee in the background. Taste is full of bourbon flavor backed with a coffee and chocolate. The alcohol comes through more as it warms and adds a spice to the brew. Mouthfeel is heavy, it sticks around for awhile. this is a sipper but i feel like i could sip this every night if given the chance."
"This poured super black with super dark frothy brown head that is almost as impressive as the head of a ten fidy! Aroma is of strong bourbon whiskey and sweet butterscotch. The taste is very whiskey heavy with a nice hint of vanilla and oats. This is one smooth brew. Super drinkable."
"D- Haha one is going to put me right to sleep I think."
"Overall this is a very big, very enjoyable beer with great flavor and balance for an Imperial Stout. I'd drink one anytime."
"Pours very dark black with 1/2"" of mocha colored head that quickly settled to a thin cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. I am impressed it showed as well as it did considering the ABV. Intense aroma of bourbon, vanilla, caramel, dark fruit, and alcohol. I can tell right now this is going to be a hot one. After one sip, it sure was hot. But there is plenty of flavor to make it worth drinking. A lot of vanilla and bourbon upfront with more subtle notes of chocolate, plums, and toffee. Finishes boozy with a lot of warmth. Full bodied with nice carbonation. If this had anymore carbonation it would be harsh with all the alcohol. This is the type of beer because of ABV and price, that is reserved for special occasions. I will need to save one for just such an occasion."
"D=very sweet, and the ABV don't lend to true sessionablity though I could drink it several nights in a row"
"This beer is a sultry ebony princess that will tug on your heart strings."
"D - Very good beer. Unique, nice flavors and I could drink a lot of this if I had the chance. Extremely tasty."
"D: I wish I always had a bottle around after those long days when I just need a beer. I could drink this pretty much any time. Thank you Goose Island! Next stop... Xmas Ale."
"D: Definitely a sipper. Big and complex, but not necessarily enjoyable at this stage. I'd say it needs a bit more time in the cellar to come together."
"O : This is one of the gold standards for a speciality stout, a treat for after dinner or after anything else that you enjoyed doing."
"O: Wonderful beer, but super expensive. A treat if you can get your hands on some."
"Drinkability: I feel bad knocking it, but it's not the most drinkable of beers. The boozy character catches up over the course of the bottle, but the rest of the experience is excellent. Drinks like a 13%, which hey, it is, making it feel pretty average in that department. But for a special occasion, and maybe some chocolate cake, this beer is happiness in a bottle."
"D- Not all that drinkable but a good cool evening sipper."
"This is the bomb, a perfect marriage of RIS and bourbon barrel aging. Inky, blank, oily, with a sweet maltiness, but does not finish overly sweet due to the massive hop offset. The bourbon is a flavor component that complements perfectly, giving a complexity to a solid backbone. The only ding here is for drinkability, so good yet a 7 oz serving would suffice. Well made and cellerable."
"The overall strength of this beer made having more than one out of the question. I had already had a few other different beers from the bar so I was certain that this would finish off my afternoon. Even at home I could not see myself having more than one, or if only drinking these 2 in a night. Any more for moe and it would quickly turn into a bad night. Overall this was everything that I expected and had hoped for and was very glad to give it a try. More importantly is that I have a bottle sitting in my cellar at home and I know know that this is a keeper, one that will be opened on a special occasion."
"Finally found a 4 pack of this exceptional beer, according to the bottle it is great with a cigar so I found an exceptional cigar and after a long day I sat down to this great creation. The pour was like syrup slow dark and thick. Little or no head. The smell is slightly sweet with a hint of vanilla but nothing to prepare you for""THE TASTE"" Goose Island did an exceptional job on this celebration beer and there will be a couple in my Beer celler for what did I read 5 years of aging. The taste is Imperial stout and bourbon and I do mean and!!!your really notice the blend. If you are like me and drink beer for the flavor this is one beer you should try and find a sip of. Little aftertaste just a nice 13% refreshing beer.... You will notice a buzz about half way down the glass always a little wake up call when your trying something new. I was home so no worries. I would rate this in the top couple of Imperial stouts my favorite being the Old Rasputin XXII.If you can find one do it is really worth a try."
"d- At 13% abv, I will not have more then one of these. For a big strong beer though, this one is very well balanced and doesn't have the alcohol burn that many 13% beers do. Overall an amazing beer, especially for any bourbon lover. Definitely gets better with age."
"Pretty much a pitch black beer with a thick dark tan head. Aroma is amazing - vanilla, oak, dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, molasses. Unbelievable aromas. The flavor profile pretty much matches the aroma. The bourbon is very prominent, but not dominant, especially as the beer warms. The coffee and chocolate notes are also very assertive, and the sweet malt notes get swept away but the hops at the finish. The vanilla-laden bourbon flavors linger. Mouthfeel is very thick and creamy, almost like it's more viscous than your typical beer. Drinkability is good, but the alcohol can hit you hard."
"What a fine offering from Goose Island. I took my time here and it was such a great experience... changing as the beer opened up, the vanilla changing from more caramel based at first to something rooted in dark fruits at the end. I imagine I will be drinking a good amount of this during the upcoming winter."
"Despite the high ABV, this one is hard to set down. It is a sipper, but it makes you want to keep sipping. One of the top Stouts in my book. Highly recommended."
"Pours dark and slow. Looks thick and heavy, syrupy. Very black, looks just dense and heavy in the glass. The head is kind of thin, but it still looks very appetizing. The smell is just all bourbon. A little more bourbon than I was expecting, and its a 2008. I'm not even sure that I can detect anything else with out trying very hard. I mean, if you want a bourbon stout - this should satisfy you. The taste is like sweetened bourbon, with quite a bit of chocolate and a hint of coffee. I get a little hint of sticky malt, but mostly woody, slightly burnt bourbon flavor. Really interesting, and the bit of roastiness cuts the intensity. The body is really great. Thick and heavy, and the alcohol and burntness kind of helps to make it feel thin enough to swallow. The carbonation is dialed back, which is definitely a good thing. The drink is very slow. Sipper status, but quite enjoyable. I couldn't imagine drinking more than one of these in a month, but I would like to drink this more than quite a few similar beers."
"Wow, taste is very boozy and strong, this could sit in the cellar for a decade. Sweet and sharp on the palate. Finish is very smoky, bourbon and a bit earthy. Alcohol lingers, this is a real sipper."
"Heavy full chewy viscous mouthfeel with such a smooth creamy body that I can't believe this beer is 11%. The alcohol heat is excellently masked. Lots of wooden earthy oak notes and bourbon flavor with hints of subtle vanilla. Also a good bit of roasted chocolate malt, burnt toast, coffee, oatmeal and Bourbon! So creamy, smooth and well balanced. This beer is incredibly mellow afte the three years of aging. Nice alcohol warmth in the finish with some subtle hops. This beer is absolutely fantastic. I want to get a few more bottles so I can try it fresh and age a few for a decade or so. ISO more bottle!"
"D- I'm rarely halfway through the glass before I get to this point. Possibly due to having to take a couple extra sips to find flavors under the bourbon, but either way it's going down very quickly."
"This is fairly drinkable but I would recommend aging it to get it smoother. Definitely a sipper."
"I had this my last night of visiting my family outside of Wichita, Kansas and have not found it nearby in Austin, Texas. I am going to have to have them ship me some for special occasions."
"Pitch black with almost no head produced from an aggressive pour. Aromas of wood, cigars, and chocolate. Taste is full bodied, oak vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, heavy alcoholic, very rich, with a long, sweet/creamy finish. There is a lot going on here, and this needs some time to mellow."
"There is no missing the bourbon in this one. A little much for me, but I can see why some like it."
"Overall a beer I'm glad I picked up and tryed. Not the best example of the style, but still a tasty brew."
"There are better bourbon barrel aged beers."
"Easy to drink considering the size. Alcohol is rather apparent but does not become overwhelming. Extremely enjoyable."
"Drinkability: How do you rate drinkability for something like this? Great sipping brew but only an occasional drink and never more than one. Yet it is intoxicating (in more ways than one)."
"D: Pretty drinkable considering it's well above 10% abv. Very nice mixing of flavors, very well balanced. Probably couldn't drink more than one of these, but if you're only going to have one beer, this would be it."
"D - Fairly high considering the ABV and bourbon in this one."
"I as hoping to like this brew much more...oh well."
"MF&D - the feel is lacking a bit for an american imperial, but the amount of carbonation and all that other stuff is great. the drinkability is also a bit lower than perfect because of the very strong oaken taste which becomes a bit grating after a while."
"Drinkability - As someone so eloquently put it, ""One and I'm done."" I don't think I could have more than one of these in a sitting. A good simmering down brew. Overall, I am not disappointed with the third installment of my GI BCS. Cheers!"
"Drinkability is freaking awesome. It is going to be SO hard cellaring the SECOND bottle he sent. Man, I owe you big time!"
"Drinkable? If you dare: 13ABV, Heavy, Rich and better be the first and last beer of the session; its the only way to get the best of this bottle... Find it, collect and forget it for a rainy day."
"Very drinkable beer, but the 13% abv could be troublesome. Glad I only have this bottle left, so I won't be tempted to sample another tonight. I will definitely be seeking this out again."
"Now I sampled and reviewed a bottle of J.W. Lees Harvest aged in Lagavulin whisky barrels yesterday, and I didn't like it because it was too sweet. Well, GI Bourbon County Stout is very sweet too, and it's awesome. Why the difference? I've no idea, in fact, I love single malt scotch. What was overbearing sweetness in the Lees, was just right in the GI, even though they were similar. There was an alcohol taste in both, should not have made much difference. Maybe it was the over ripe fruit taste in the Lees, whereas, the GI had a coffee background... I duh no. I just love the Bourbon County Stout. It poured as black as a January midnight in Barrow, Alaska. A modest head that quickly reduced to a collar. The aroma was largely alcohol with some coffee. This baby was heavy, thick, oily; you almost wanted a spoon to eat it. Drinkability... Nope, it's a sipper and I give it a 4.0 out of respect."
"Conclusion: This is the best GI stout for sure, though I like it a bit better on tap I think...I'm really looking forward to keeping a couple of these 2008's in the cellar and seeing what they do in a couple of years"
"Lowest score of all for me was the ""drinkability"". taking this literally makes me want to score it a bit on the lower side. I know for a fact that I couldn't dream of handling two of these back to back. to be honest, the flavor profile of this beer changed dramatically as it warmed up and I think I preferred it cold. this is a great beer that I'm hoping will mellow out considerably with a couple of years on it."
"-for me this is pretty drinkable, but you definitely have to be in the mood. but sitting around smoking some stoges out on the deck...good stuff"
"D: Good, but a bit overwhelming, like I said. The alcohol content gets in the way of really savoring this one. I'm biased, but this ain't no Kentucky Breakfast Stout."
"Darkest brown with a nice looking coffee colored head that fades quickly into a collar of foam. The smell is pretty oaky and bourbon heavy with some vanilla and roasted malt. Oak hits the palate first, followed by dark mascerated fruit, roasted malt and a charred bitterness. Full bodied and silky with a warm alcoholic finish that lingers long after each sip. This beer is hyped for a reason, it's very good. I would guess that how you feel about bourbon will determine how much you get out of this beer, I love it."
"This is a black beer with a cream head and a lovely sweet aroma. The aroma also has an alcohol note to it. The taste is also of alcohol with a minimal roastiness. This is followed by just a pure chocolate taste. The mouthfeel feels like liquid velvet. This is a wonderful beer! Maybe this isnt' the most drinkable beer as you might be knocked out with too many. It is like a cordial. Super desert beer."
"Bottle pours pitch black with a thin chocolate looking head. Aroma is amazing. Bourbon, chocolate, bourbon, roasted malts, vanilla, and did I mention bourbon? Has a very dense and heavy mouthfeel with some carbonation. Flavor is just what the doctor ordered. Hot bourbon, roasted malt, chocolate, caramel, dark roasted coffee, and alcohol. Overall, this is one of my favorite beers. This is an over the top, bourbon in your face brew. This is what makes it one of my favorites. Its also its biggest weakness. I really like the over the top bourbon, but enjoy a more balanced bourbon flavor even more."
"D - Well it was amazing, but my mouth is basically in shock. I don't think I could have more than one in an evening; this is definitely a special occasion beer."
"Very nice for a sit down. Heavy, thick and un-apologetic about it, this is a HUGE beer. Be prepared to fall in love once and then maybe again in a few weeks."
"Overall drinkability, however would be somewhat low. For me, anyway. Due to somewhat high cost of this beer (which is absolutely a fair price), and the limited availability, mixed with the high alcohol content is going to keep me from drinking this on a regular basis. But I will be looking forward to this beer, year after year, and will always thank heaven when I'm able to sample it. Cheers!"
"[Sampled at the 2009 Flower City Brewers' Fest at Frontier Field, Rochester, NY]"
"This beer pours an opaque black like motor oil with only a chocolate brown film sitting on - film sits on top for the duration of the beer and leaves no lacing what so ever. Nose is of bourbon and booze predominantly with only the slightest hint of chocolate. Taste is HOLY bourbon batman! Major booziness and a strong bitter chocolate presence, roasted malts a slight undertone to this beer. Medium to full bodied, low carbonation, thick feel on the tongue and chewy. This isn't a sessionable beer by any means, but it is a wonderful one to sit with and sip with friends."
"Drinability: despite the sky-high abv, slight hotness, and still a bit ""green"" flavors this is a hugely drinkable and tasty beer."
"Poured into my duck rabbit snifter. 2007 vintage. Pitch black. Very thin head on the outer edge. Bourbon, vanilla, and oak on the nose. Sweet bourbon upfront followed by a roasted malt finish. Loads of vanilla. There's a bitterness mixed with oak also on the finish that could be better. Not hot at all like when fresh. Bourbon nose definitely subdued because of age which I enjoy more. Mouthfeel is creamy with just enough carbonation to keep it lively. Well another 6 months before I try another."
"Overall I'll say it's nice to have a year round Bourbon aged stout but I've had better. I really wanted to love this one but while I enjoyed and gave high marks I have to admit I was a little let down. Maybe my expectations were too high. I'm sure this will work it's way back into rotation but I'm in no rush."
"D- Really really hot. This is still a fantastically delicious sipper though."
"Only downer is drinkability d/t thickness and heat."
"Overall this is great but I was expecting something slightly different. I guess I was expecting more bourbon and vanilla creamy flavors than what was there. I know bourbon, I drink the good stuff all the time but I really couldn't pick it out of the other aromas. The lack of carbonation also kept me from rating it higher on the appearance. This is my favorite Bourbon Aged Stouts so far...even over KBS."
"One of those beers that is the poster child for aging. Can't wait to see what it tastes like in another year."
"D- This one is a sipper for sure. Drinks like a nice bourbon... delicious. I could drink this all night."
"D: Drinkability is impressive for the abv."
"After much searching and endless self-built hype I finally found this beer at New Beer in NYC.. Pour is as good as it gets for imperial stouts. Solid black, viscous with brown head. Amazing. Aroma is very melty with lots of dark fruity. Black cherry and fig. Very sweet. Flavor is very dark fruit and a chocolaty, rich malt sweetness. It is very, very rich and very, very boozey. The strength of the flavor may take away from it a bit by some. Mouth is also as good as it gets for heavy stouts. Super thick. Viscous like molasses. Also with very crisp carbonation. The beer is so rich that it can be a bit overpowering. Its quite amazing in flavor and mouthfeel, but as far as ""drinkability"" is concerned, its very boozey and powerful. Certainly a sipper."
"D- This brew tells you what its going to be like from the get go. ""Bourbon County Stout"" is exactly that, a huge bourbon flavored stout that doesn't hold back. Drinkable considering the 13% ABV but still boozy."
"Pours black as night with a small quarter inch dark brown head that scatters quickly leaving swirls that dance upon the top of the beer. Smell is bourbon, bourbon, and more bourbon. Some vanilla, wood, and chocolate too (dipped in bourbon). The taste is a seriously huge mash of bourbon and hops, not near as painful as I remember but still pretty bold even for my further developed palate. Not quite what I would call ""harsh"" though, which is a positive. Background flavors include chocolate, wood, and burnt caramel. Full bodied and creamy, exactly how an imperial stout should be. This is a big time sipper, not one to be messed with. World class beer with few flaws."
"Drink ability is above average for a beer this big. I could possibly drink two of these at a time but its definitely a sipper. The flavors are some of the most powerful stuff i've ever had but the overly sweetness and alcohol make it fall just short of the best stouts in the world. Would love to try another one after another year cellered and see how the time changes it"
"Overall - An exquisite stout and one of the most full flavoured beers i've ever had... highly recommended. I have two more of these and i can't wait to see how they age..."
"Drinkability: Despite the 13.00% abv, this delicious brew begs to be consumed."
"This beer never fails to wow me. Bourbon caramel notes on the nose give way to a rich alcoholic malty coffee taste that dances on the tongue. It finishes with an almost-burnt chocolate flavor that rounds out the package nicely. You must drink this beer."
"Drinkability: I would have another if I had super-tolerance. It's a great beer. Stick with it if the bourbon overpowers you and let it warm up."
"NOTE: This bottle was about 11 months old. I've sampled a bottle from the same batch when it was reasonably fresh, and although I think it holds up really well with plenty of bourbon still hanging around, I think the bourbon notes have faded just a little bit."
"T: Smoke and wood at first, then roasted malt and vanilla. Some sweet fruit finishes it out an counters it all. Excellent Imperial Stout. I might prefer this over KBS. I do prefer this over Peche Mortel and Older Viscosity."
"I would recommend this to someone who loves big beers and bourbon. I have only gotten into bourbon in the last half year or so, and I definitely didn't enjoy this as much in February as I did this time around"
"If you took a Guinness and let it bounce around in your car trunk for a summer spent in the desert, added various burned molasses concoctions and some bourbon you had washed your feet in, you might approximate the flavor. This is the Edsel of beers in my opinion, and I am a huge fan of big stouts."
"drinkability is decent. a beer this big and complex is inherently less drinkable than lighter counterparts, but the profile is very rich and full of all the right notes (long story short, if this brew can stand up to the spicy sriracha wings with wasabi aioli, it can stand up to anything!). the earthy and oaked notes smooth out any alcoholic bite and syrupy texture into a complete package that is unmatched in sheer size and richness. cheers!"
"Matlida is a great beer, but this one was my special favorite..."
"Overall, very solid beer. Great taste once you get past the odd smell."
"I love how this beer just leaves my mouth tingling. So many flavors so little time. There is a creaminess and fullness to this beer. The drinkability is pretty good. I would love to have more than one but don't want to put a big dent in my stash."
"This was my first crack at a barrel-aged bourbon beer and all I can say is that either Goose Island did one hell of a job with this one or else bourbon style beer is going to be one of my favorite styles from now on."
"I dunno, is a beer like this *ever* ""drinkable""? It's a sipper for sure, but a damn good one."
"Pours thick black, almost no foam. Nose is of rickhouse, oak, bourbon, vanilla, coffee, alcohol...something I can't quite put my finger on...cheap licorice! Taste of all the same things, finishes big with a nice medium roasted coffee taste. Not particularly bitter, or dry and surprisingly sweet. Second taste brings a strong essence of chocolate at the front. Wow. BIG beer. This glass is gonna take a while."
"Cheers Eric!"
"Prost!"
"Not being a fan of bourbon/whisky, I just am not getting into this beer. It's so heavy and boozy, with the bourbon really overpowering the profile, that I don't even think I can finish half the bottle!"
"Pours nearly black with thick but vanishing head. Lacing clings to glass. No light at all passes through the glass. Aroma of bourbon overpowers all others. Better try this one sitting down or it will knock you over! The label proclaims <i>""One sip has more flavor than your average case of beer""</i> and they are not kidding. Thick bodied, with powerful bourbon flavor with notes of chocolate and coffee. This is some strong stuff, meant for sipping, which is good because at that strength you aren't going anywhere soon I hope. Very good!"
"Mouthfeel is syrupy and velvety with just a little alcohol warmth on the back. This is perhaps a little sweet to be drunk all the time, but it's so outrageously tasty otherwise."
"Holy shit, I've just drunk the best beer in the world. This is smooth, indulgent, and absolutely amazing. I have never had a beer so rich, so smooth and so consistently delicious. For one brief moment, I have tasted perfection."
"Drinkability: The tastes mellow out after a little while and it becomes more drinkable, but I was not a fan. I was disappointed with this one. I don't think it was a bad bottle, but I will try to get my hands on one again in the future, and change if necessary. It was a chore to make my way through this bottle."
"Overall impression: I don't think I'll crack any more of this vintage for a year or 2. Hopefully the bourbon will have calmed down a bit by then."
"Bottle From my buddy Jeremiah Year 2008 Pours a good black with a tan head. The head is fizzy but lasting. Awesome aroma of chocolate, I mean really chocolate, licorice, bourbon, and molasses. Produces great lacing. Has a good carbonation and a wonderful mouthfeel. Very well balanced and the alcohol is well hidden. The flavors are chocolate, spicies, with the slightest alcohol. Has a thick texture. Stick to ribs feel to it. An awesome finish with a great aftertaste. Not sure if you can tell this is an awesome beer."
"D: Slow sipper here. Its impressive that there so much flavor here yet the overall profile is simple, Vanilla, Bourbon Sweet malt, done."
"The mouthfeel is thick and viscous. The booze hits your right away, but doesn't overpower the flavors of the beer. This would benefit from some time in the cellar, definitely a sipper, but an extreme beer that I am glad I tried."
"Thick mouthfeel. This is a great sipper."
"D: Wouldn't have more than one of these at a time. BUT its not because it wasn't good... but rather, its so heavy and filling, one beer is enough to last the night."
"Drinkability: Personally I could drink this beer all day. At 13%, however, the day would be very short"
"D- Never had anything close to this before, the rich woody bourbon flavor is a bit too much for me.... actually it blows my hat and socks right off! I don't want to take anything away from the fine folks at Goose Island, it's not really my style but with that said you can really tell this stout has been made with incredibly high amount of dedication."
"Overall this beer is a thing of beauty. Complex and so well balanced. This is right up there among my absolute favorites."
"D: I would love to have more! One of my top 5 Beers of all time! I do not think i would wast having more than one of these at a time."
"Drinkability is good. The alcohol presence is nice, but is still really potent. I really enjoyed this beer, but can't see myself having more than one. Cheers!"
"D- This beer was very good, but the alcohol taste to it limits my wanting to drink it. I would probably never drink more than one of these in a night but the complexity left me wanting more after each sip. I would definitely buy this again."
"Take time to enjoy the Goose Island Bourbon County Stout. Find a comfortable chair, call over the dog to sit at your feet (if you get bashed, it will break the fall) and relax. Of course, in my case, just sit at the bar and slowly savor. It was expensive - $9.00. But it was worth every grubby penny. Wow!"
"Overall a unique and worthwhile beer that blurrs the line between a dark beer and a liquor. Top notch stuff Goose Island!"
"Awesome!!!! I poured half of the bottle into my beer tasting wine glass. There was a tiny caramel head that disappears quickly. This stuff pours like 10w30, Texas Tea! The smell is coffee, chocolate, caramel, vanilla, dried fruit, black cherry and alcohol, little bit of smoke. The taste is all that and just straight up bourbon. The mouthfeel is silky smooth like whole milk. If I didn't pass out first, I would drink this all day. Great Stout, one of the best I have had!"
"Drinkability - You want to sip this one. I like Bourbon, so this is great for me."
"D. This beer is definitely boozey. Although I probably wouldnt want more than one at a time, its a beer that leaves you wanting another one in the future. This is an intense, good beer."
"If you dont like bourbon, you'll hate this beer.... I dont like bourbon. Was hoping for more subtlety, maybe not possible with bourbon?"
"Overall impression: I can't say I'm overly impressed - this has some definite burn, lots of oak and vanilla .. but the sweetness just overpowers everything else for me. I've had this both with and without the cigar .. its a bit more drinkable with the cigar, but the four pack I have will certainly be plenty for me."
"D: This beer reminds me of a PX sherry. Sweet, complex, and raisiny. The flatness of the beer and the high alcohol only goes to reinforce the connection. Drinkability is good, as long as your not too aggressive with this beer. It's a sipper for sure. A nice slow glass of beer, meant to be appreciated."
"D - stilll hot after seven months, but easy to go down. Let it sit longer and you have a gem."
"Straight from the bottle to goblet, pours a dark syrupy looking beer with thin tan head resting atop. The beer alone screams stout, and a burley one at that. Aroma is strong bourbon, very strong, it almost overwhelms the beer, but as it warms some chocolate and roasted malt comes through. There is a lot going on in this beer, more than just booze, which I was somewhat afraid of at first. Much like the smell, there is bourbon up front in the nose, but the sweet chocolate flavor is there, and hints of vanilla and some other sweetness I can't quite put my finger on, but there is more! A thick beer, that goes down slow, with an intense warming as you sip it. Definitely lives up to the billing, I love this beer and am looking forward to trying an aged bottle I got in trade, as well as aging few others just to see what happens."
"My timing is a little off. I imagine this as a great winter-sittin'-by-the-fire beer, which is probably when I'll have it next."
"If you want S T R O N G, go for this bad boy."
"Edit: With 2-3 years on it, GIBCS may be one of my favorite beers, period."
"Drinkability: One at a sitting is plenty. If I want to drink bourbon, I'll drink bourbon."
"overall this is the best bourbon aged beer that i have had - a lot more complex then founders kbs (which i have only had fresh)"
"Pours a thick, viscous deep black that only hints of brown on the very edges. Not one quanta of light passes through the middle. Smell is complex and impressive--vanilla, oak, cassis, chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, teriyaki sauce, and alcohol. That is the most aroma components I think I've ever encountered in one beer. Taste is a bit less complex, but substantial nonetheless--the salty teriyaki component is there, roasty coffee beans, creamy syrupy malt. Mouthfeel is very thick and juicy. Drinkability will keep me from giving a perfect score simply because the 13% abv. is overwhelming me a little and the booze aroma becomes more and more evident as the glass empties."
"$20 a 4-pack?! You know what, screw the mortgage, I'm just going to stock up on this. I can live on Ramen... for beers sake."
"D- Wow.. I can only handle a small sip at a time. Big and potent brew, not the easiest to drink but the best to sip."
"A truly great beer that finally made its way out west. This one has seven months of age on it and the hot alcohol factor has definitely gone down. The bottle says the flavor will continue to develop over 5 years. I plan on revisiting over the next few to see how it matures."
"Great imp. stout with a nice bourbon character!"
"A ultra dark thick black color body with a very thin chocolate colored head,little to no carbonation,lots of sticky sheeting and lace. Aroma of Vanilla, chocolate covered cherries, oak, tobacco,and brown sugar.Flavor is HUGE dark toasted malt ,chocolate, coffee, licorice, raisin, smoke, vanilla, and molasis, a full body with a thick creamy mouthfeel,slightly boozy ,burbony but in a very good way,long milk chocolate,and alcohol finish. This is the bomb !"
"I'm happy with this beer. I'd buy it again, though maybe not until next year. I think next to their Imperial IPA, this is the best beer Goose Island makes. If you really like the taste of bourbon in beer, you will really love it; if you're open to new experiences, you'll be pleasantly surprised; if you aren't ready for this craziness, save your money and wait for your taste buds to make some progress."
"Taste is licorice at first followed by Bourbon mellow flavors, roasted hints, shy hints of vanilla, a taste of glazed donut, sugary coated donuts. A shy bitterness, with a shy hoppy stint with a mellow warm alcohol finish."
"This beer is not a beer to take lightly. At 13%, the alcohol is in your face and the complexity of flavors makes it something that I really think should be paired with no food other than perhaps a boozy-chocolaty dessert. It has enough flavors going on that it can stand on its own very well. It is a great beer to have and savor slowly, once in a while."
"Overall: Good drinkability for a bourbon stout. Great flavors with nice complexity. Totally love this beer! The alcohol is present in flavor and feel, but not like a 13% ABV beer and not overwhelming at all!!"
"12oz bottle. Black with a bit of foam at first but no lasting head. The aroma is pretty much straight bourbon, with a light dark chocolate accompaniment. Thick and slick with low, fine carbonation. Lots of bourbon, wood, alcohol, and dark chocolate flavors. The alcohol is relatively smooth, but very present. I can dig this a little bit, but it seems to be intense just for intensity's sake. The bourbon runs the show for sure."
"D- This was quite possibly the best imperial stout ive ever tasted. Huge bourbon, but it didn't distract from the full body of the beer. Excellent."
"Overall a very complex, excellent beer that blows away KBS on the bourbon flavor, however it gets blown away by KBS on the drinkability scale and enjoyablility scale. This is a great beer, but it can only be handled in small doses."
"Mouthfeel is sweetly slick and incredibly smooth. There is a slight roughness that makes the back of my throat raw but I still dig this beer. It does have slightly more booze flavors then I prefer but what do you expect from an 11 percenter. God damn this is a kick ass beer. Beer like this begs to be sipped and enjoyed as long as possible. Fantastic."
"This certainly is a good beer, but I know other brewers have managed to make big sweet bourbony beers without the defect of burnt wood flavor. Of course, that is an elite bunch. I'm not unhappy with GI-BCS, but I can think of a few who have pulled this off a little better."
"In summary, this was one of the best and most unique beers I've ever had. Not for the faint of heart!"
"D: This is no easy sipper, the 13% alcohol is not hidden whatsoever, and a couple of sips into it you can really begin to notice the warming alcohol, and this is slightly more noticeable as the beer warms up."
"2008 vintage. I had this beer once before, and I had a cold. What a mistake to drink it then. I didn't think much of it, and I'm lucky I tried it again, because this beer is fantastic. A deep viscous black and a purposefully agitating pour yeilds a nice brown head, fades. Strong fumes of bourbon, vanilla, tons of roasted malt, chocolate, raisins. This beer is hot but manages to come across as soft and refined, not brash at all. Flavor is pretty spot on. Bourbon up front, plenty of vanilla and oak surrounds a full on roasted malt profile of coffee, chocolate, deep tobacco, dry smokiness, and a delicious cakey flavor. Sweet and fluffy but has a deep char and leather character as well to balance out the sweetness. Somehow the 13% ABV is kept in check and only adds more complexity to this brew. Velvet mouthfeel, full bodied but not too heavy surprisingly. Goes down the gullet all too easily for a beer this big. I'm not necessarily a fan of the ""extreme beer"" movement but this barrel aged beer is an example of a great achievement in brewing. Much props to sonicdescent for the trade."
"D: Gets smoother and smokier as it warms. Worth the price, every once in a while. Would love to drink 2 in a row, but I might end up in Mexico with a hooker in the trunk of my car. Kudos to Goose Island for making this complex and robust beer. It takes huge nuts to pack in so much flavor"
"A whiskey lover's delight, this one does not disappoint. Great winter sipper or a beer to watch the game with....the whole game."
"D: Sneaky, this beer is huge, and could easily be consumed quickly, and multiple, the alcohol heat does catch up fairly quick. I really wish I would have bought more. This is an exceptional beer. Highly recommended."
"The mouthfeel is rich, unctuous, and oily, peerless really, among the stouts I've sampled thus far. Highly quaffable despite having an assertive flavor profile and (deceptively) high ABV. It certainly borders on the superb."
"I wish that I could find this stuff in Denver."
"d: good for a monster beer great dessert beer."
"D- Very awesome brew for sure."
"D - Great beer, would like to see more hops though."
"Pours nice dark black with an attractive tan head, that slowly fizzes away. Smell is fantastic, with the bourbon scent coming through most clearly, though you can also scent molasses, malt and coffee. The taste is absolutely exceptional and complex; there is a lot going on in this beer. The bourbon in the name is clearly there, though dark fruit, malt, molasses, coffee, a hint of vanilla and some licorice as well; even the oak of the barrel is there. So much going on... The booze is still a little hot, but it is an amazing accomplishment of flavor. Its nice and thick and syrupy in the mouth, and I really enjoy the way it drinks. Its a wonderful, wonderful beer, but it is definitely a sipper, and there is no way I could have more than one of these."
"D: Pretty good brew. Its got a lot going on here but it doesn't sit too heavy. It would be easy to put down a couple of these in a night and this one has gone quickly. The flavors and aromas are damned nice and this is a fine ass brew. If you can get it, I envy you. If you can't, seek it out."
"I'll be buying more for sure."
"Drinkability - This is going to be a total sipper, and a hard sell to finish the bottle. The flavors are crazy and in your face, and the viscous nature makes it even worse. I appreciate the extreme nature of the beer, but this will be the only time i have it."
"Its definitely an ""experience"" beer. Would I drink it again? Its only a matter of time...it just wouldn't be tomorrow. Still, first rate and worth trying if you can find it. To me, the only thing it could use is some subtlety."
"This is a damn fine BA Stout and one that really sets the bar for the style."
"D: This beer is overwhelming. Not a smooth representation of the style, like others I have tried, but this is what makes it both mind and mouth numbing. I am tempted to pick up another as it could end up being one of my favorite beers after some aging. Highly Recommended."
"D: Very, very drinkable. This is high in ABV, but I could drink these until I couldn't drink any longer."
"The bourbon taste isn't as prevalent as the nose would suggest, It's definitely there but not as overpowering as I thought it would be. I'm also getting some roasted barley and some dark chocolate as well. Very nice. It kind of reminds me of Heresy a more intense but similar none the less. Good mouthfeel nice and creamy just like I like my stouts. The high alcohol content and the hot booziness from the bourbon makes this one a sipper."
"Overall a pretty good beer."
"D: This is the very definition of a sipper. It's a bit boozy but not as much as you'd expect with 13% ABV."
"Smell is of rich vanilla and chocolate with slight whiskey. Taste follows through and I also notice a slight coffee tone. Beer finishes somewhat smooth, but bubbles seem a tad bit high. As the brew warmed up, it became less carbonated and even smoother. I may have served stout to cold because the longer it spends in glass, the better and richer it becomes."
"D - I don't think I could take down more than two of these but I would definitely want to."
"D: Wish I could drink more, but the ABV will catch up to me soon I think. I would definitely love to get through two in a sitting though!"
"Overall, this is a great beer. I've always been very impressed with Goose Island as a mid-range brewery, but this and Matilda has solidified them as, in my mind, capable of brewing very high-end stuff."
"2006 vintage bottled 7-3-06. Label states 11%ABV. 12 ounce bottle split with psycohops. Poured into my chalice and allowed to warm a bit. Appears an opaque black color with about a finger of loose dark ecru foam. No lacing to speak of, but in it's place is a rich brown, syrup that coats the inside of the glass with every swirl. Smells of burnt toast that's right on the edge of being still edible, molasses, oak, tons of bourbon, and treacle. Tastes of booze soaked rich roasted coffee beans, plum pudding, raisins, bitter baking chocolate, hint of smoke and a gigantic bourbon sting in the mouth. Yep, the bourbon is still VERY much a part of this experience even after almost three years in the bottle. This could sit for at least three more. A full bodied, satisfying sipper with maybe a notch below medium in carbonation. Great stuff."
"Had this on tap at McNiven's in Indy. Pours pitch black with little head in a Matilda glass. Awesome aromas of vanilla, chocolate, and ofcourse bourbon. I just loved smelling this beer. Silky smooth taste with lots of chocolate and vanilla and lots of bourbon. I love bourbon so I really enjoyed that taste. I thought it was nicely done. I wish I knew which bourbon barrels it was aged in. I found it to go great with the Davidoff Millenium Blend. A great sipping beer. Currently my favorite Double/Imperial. I found it to be better than Kentucky Breakfast Stout. The bottle version requires a little aging to smooth it out. A++"
"Drinkability? are you kidding me? Sure, considering the THIRTEEN PERCENT abv this is super drinkable, but there is no way you are going to want to have more than one of these. You would have to be a damn fool to do that. A damn fool."
"above average stout...reminds me of several wood aged beers, strong ales, and barley wines. the alcohol comes on at the right moment...beer has a biscuit-like finishing note."
"Worth the $22 a four pack I paid for this? I'm not, but I do know it's a damn good beer. Definitely a strong contender for best Bourbon aged Imp Stout. I'd give it the silver medal, right behind Founders KBS."
"taste is more pronounced as it warms."
"Pours tar black with no head, some dark brown hues. Nose is tremendous with burst of malty fruit, raisin, also hint of some tongue bruising hops. Most notable is the immediate smoothness that is uncommon in a beer on this size. The hit of sweet malt brings molasses, and dark chocolate to the forefront, as the sip finishes a tingling covers the palate. As the malty sweetness slowly melts off the tongue the bitterness becomes more prevalent in the elongated finish. Wonderful!"
"a great example of an extreme style. not just any stout, but a bourbon soaked stout. and it is not mild. this is a doozy of a beer, not at all for the faint of heart or beginner stout drinkers."
"make no mistake: this is boozy and bourbony, but now with over a year on it, has mellowed out slightly, to the point where it is just starting to meld nicely with everything. would be interesting to try and age this further."
"I dont understand the folks who drain poured it, however one guy said it was his first and I was like... yea... that was a rookie mistake for sure. All in all I enjoyed it. Tasted good, good mouthfeel, looked like most other stouts, smelled delicious. But I think I will always fight the price on some beers."
"Great beer, and my first A+"
"Pours black with a light brown/tan head which quickly diminishes. Smells like bourbon and chocolate...what a great combo! Lots of chocolate and bourbon but the alcohol isn't so overpowering that it takes away from the sweetness...perfectly blended together. Great feel in the mouth...like a chocolate milkshake with alcohol! A couple of these and I'd be feeling pretty good although I will say it's an easy-to-drink stout, IMO."
"Overall, a very well done bourbon stout. The bourbon adds a lot to it without being overbearing on the alcohol like many are."
"Huh. Stouts are generally not my favorite, but it turns out that my love of bourbon can trump anything. Usually I find stouts burnt and coffee-ish. This is a sweet vanilla bourbon flavor that really does it for me."
"Try it! It is worth the $5/bottle at least once to try."
"Cheers!"
"D: I split this 12oz for dessert. It was a great amount for the two of us. It's a great idea to take your time with this beer. I'd like to taste it a year from now."
"Great job!!"
"Pours black like motor oil with one of the darkest brown heads I've seen. Carbonation seems surprisingly high. Smell is great. Never smelled a beer quite like this. Smells of oak barrels, figs, vanilla, booze, chocolate, coffee, dark richness! Taste is just as amazing as the smell. Tastes of dark richness with a boozy kick to it that clears out your nostrils. There also is a chocolate flavor in there that tastes like the darkest chocolate I've had times two. Definitely more of an earthy/woody flavor with a sweet dark fruit finish. Slightly bitter but with a sweet finish. Mouthfeel is a little lighter than I expected with a little more carbonation that I expected too. The drinkablity is pretty good, although I dont know that I'd drink more than one. I think this beer would do very well with aging."
"Almost black pour with no head. Smell vanilla and burnt cherries? with a tinge of bourbon. With a deep breath I can feel the bourbon in my nose. Love It. Thick chewy mouthfeel that coats the entire tongue and a little burn as it warms. A strong 13%..A definite sipper!!"
"Extremely expensive 4 pack of bottles. Pours very black but with red highlights to it, smells strongly of bourbon and dark chocolate. The flavor has some very nice chocolate and coffee notes to it and the mouthfeel is pretty creamy, but honestly this beer is far too ""hot"" for me at this stage. I set the other three bottles to cellar and very much look forward to drinking and re-rating probably around christmas of 09"
"Thick chunky mouthfeel that doesnt get too cloying. For 13 % abv this is extremely drinkable. Probably one of the best Imperial stouts I've ever had. Highly recommended."
"couldn't wait to pop this open - i agree with most everything i've read here - loved everything about this beer - i'll have to try the bottle version and see how it compares - this may be the best stout i ever drank - good good stuff."
"D: Very good. A bit of a bite from the high ABV. Don't think I could do more than 1 in a night. But something good to be appreciated."
"D- I lowered the score on the drinkability because it was a challenge to finish, simply because it was so strong. This beer won't sneak up on you thats for sure."
"This is a truly huge beer - they don't get much bigger. Do I need to say that it's nearly black, extremely bold and powerfull? That it is quite heavy-bodied? Or that the head is thick? One of these might leave you wondering which way is up. The taste is very strong - as you'd expect - and the bourbon comes through. Like many of the best you have to work a bit for this one - it is not easily accessible. Just very, very good."
"Another great Fette Sau experience. Supposedly brewed directly for the restaurant (different from bottle version?...), this stout was a perfect pairing, although I'd be more inclined to call it a porter. No complaints otherwise. A dark brown-to-black pour with the tiniest head & lace of beige with ruby, a rich aroma of banana-bourbon-& chocolate excites the nostrils! Although 13%, the alcohol does not kill off flavor; smooth sweet-dark chocolate & plum brandy come to mind with vanilla & a hint of lemon-peel. Smoothly sweet, rich & chewy, this is a great dessert cordial, meant not for downing several, but enjoying one slowly, especially while your stomach smiles at dinner."
"D: Very damn drinkable, every taste @ different temperatures brings joy. 13% ABV and high price make this unsessionable. A big beer that beckons you to have another...another...another...and another sip."
"An excellent Extreme Imperial Stout. I will buy more for my cellar."
"7-9-11: Sipping on a bomber bottled on 10-9-09. Bourbon notes have mellowed a smidge, alcohol still present and warming. Beer is as smooth and full as ever. The oaked bourbon, roasted malts, chocolate, and vanilla play together very well. This beer is still very strong and could easily go another 3-4 years. Damn, i should have grabbed a 4 pack last winter to age!"
"Drinkability: I can't believe it took me this long to try this one; it has been in my refrigerator for several months. I guess I was a little intimidated by the 13% ABV. Now, I wish I had more. I can't imagine how great this stuff would be with a few years to mellow and blend."
"What a special beer. When I think back on what beer was to me five years ago, this seems like something from a different planet. You have to appreciate what they've done here, being a bigger brewery. Goose Island makes many good beers but it's good to see that their brewmaster still has the freedom of expression to put something like this out on the shelves."
"D: I had a hard time getting through ½ a 12 oz bottle I shared with a friend, because this beer was so huge. It is a complete antitheses of a session beer and that is a good thing. Its like a alcohol desert. One of the biggest beers I have ever had. So even though I enjoyed every drop of my small glass, one only please."
"Great beer, I enjoyed this."
"I picked up a single of these after being a little sticker shocked at the 4 pack price. But after a few sip, I can say with confidence that I'll be picking up a few 4 packs. I imagine this aging wonderfully."
"Palate: More of the same. The initial impression is of German chocolate cake. Very sweet and smooth. There is more of a pronounced date quality than fig on the palate. Some heat on the finish but if paired correctly (Cigars, a mousse of some sort, pudding, other desserts with high fat contents) it might not be noticed. All in all an excellent beer."
"Nice and dark and opaque. To get any kind of head out of it you REALLY have to be vigorous on the pour! Smells pretty good - alcohol and chocolate malts. Tastes of a million different things. A bit over the top on the sweetness and little to no bitterness to balance that out, but it has the great advantage of not tasting like Quick (know what I mean?). There's chocolate and dark licorice and plum brandy. And raisins. And treacle and other molasses-like things. But it's too sweet/thick in the mouth. Ah well. Knock that down and bump up the bitterness and this would be outstanding. As it is, it is really good and I'm really glad I had the opportunity to try it."
"What a fantastic beer. A slow sipper in the truest sense. I have been sipping mine for 30 mins already and am only half way through the beast."
"Overall a bit too boozy for my tastes..I'd love to try the stout before the barrel aging."
"Overall I would have to say this is a great stout. Great aroma and flavors, the head is lacking a bit but it more then makes up for it in other areas. Yumm."
"First thought: Holy crap, it's an expresso RIS! Huge sweetness explodes on the start with a bit of vanilla, then tempered by the booziness of the bourbon taste, with some woodiness as well. Slight bitterness through the end with some hops (about in the middle, as far as RISes go), and an absolute coffee blast at the end. The booziness and the coffee are what linger, but the booziness (aged taste) makes you shudder in a great way, not from acrid bitterness, but from how well those flavors merge with everything else going on. First and foremost though, this is a hugely sweet RIS. The sweetness never completely relents, just is tempered into the rest of the flavor. Mouthful is coating, filling, lingering in all the right ways, amazing spunk behind this beer. Pretty creamy, just rolls off the tongue. The ABV doesn't come off nearly as much as in the smell, it hides it better probably than any Impy Stout I've tried so far save Abyss. As it warms, the bourbon aspect comes out more and more, but while it gives a nice kick, i don't feel it really detracts a great deal from drinkability. I think the fact that mine is 2 years old makes this aspect stand out more than it normally would. After drinking, the lingering flavors are like from one of those flavored coffee drinks from Starbucks, except those feel overly sweet and artificial, while this feels hearty, naturally/perfectly sweet and delicious. I don't know how the fresher stuff comes off, but this aged bottle is amazing!"
"D: The only hit against this beer is the slight over-sweetness. Otherwise it's great."
"D: Alcohol was a bit cloying toward the end. Over all a solid beer, if not a bit over-rated."
"Looking forward to next year's edition. Hope I still have a job then so I can buy a bunch of bottles."
" My next beer run is definitely going to include a full pack of these guys to lay back for a while."
"Any fan of malts is certainly going to appreciate this sweet bourbon-laden sipper of a beer. Thanks for sending Goose Island to CA! Cheers!"
"Overall this beer did not disappoint - you probably won't enjoy this beer if you dislike bourbon, but even if you like bourbon the tiniest bit you will love this beer. I look forward to next year and seeing how this beer settles. Thanks again to route66pubs!"
"One's good for me, though I'll be looking forward to the next."
"'08 vintage poured at a recent BA tasting event. Pours a nearly flat motor oil black. The nose is all bourbon boozy with some vanilla notes. Taste is more of the same but adding in some espresso and bakers chocolate. Very smooth with a little bite of heat on the sides of the mouth. Looong finish. People who trash this beer just don't understand it."
"Pours a thick black sludge into my imperial pint glass, no head to speak of. No seeing through this bad boy. The aroma is big time bourbon, oak, and vanilla extract. Nice smooth bourbon flavors, vanilla, and straight caramel, perhaps slightly burnt. Secondary flavors are roasted malt, booze soaked grapes and charred wood. The feel is thick, not much is thicker than this. Soft carbonation and the body make this almost syrupy. Finishes sweet, roasted bitterness, and quite sticky. Oh yeah, the booziness likes to pop in to say 'hi' now and again. A sipper for sure, a nice night cap. Look forward to aging a few, though the twist off cap seems odd."
"Oh, and guess what else? I've just become a Disciple!"
"D - Almost too much alcohol. Can drink one bottle just fine, but not much more."
"I believe this is the best barrel-aged imperial stout I've ever had. Wonderful, highly recommended, and worth the price."
"Completely black and opaque. Sweet, malty nose. No head...almost looked flat when pouring. Sweet, malty, bourbony initial flavor. Almost a scotch flavor. Slight hop finish. Strong alcoholic post-finish. HUGE stout...biggest I've ever had and certainly one of the best examples of this style. Would be good paired with strong food, cigar. Ridiculous."
"A near perfect imperial stout. Rich, complex, and delicious - this beer has very strong notes of vanilla, chocolate, licorice, and oak. Really smooth and warming. However, at 13% this is an easy one to get lost in. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Highest recommendation."
"Drinkability is high only because this is so good. I wouldn't session this beer at all though."
"Overall: This beer is liquid syrup, you can cut this beer with a steak knife, chewy, creamy and slightly carbonated. The finish is full and slightly bitter. Okay, I was not expecting this type of beer from Goose Island. It is super rich, super thick, and it has a lot going on in the beer. I am surprised that the alcohol is buried deep and is inconspicuous. The first impression is this beer is a definite sipper, therefore making the drink ability a little bit lower. I rather like the fact that it is a bold in your face beer and very good stout."
"Rerate - bottle, 2007, aged 3-4 months. A little age greatly reign in the vanilla and bourbon notes, and the alcohol to a lesser degree, bringing up the coffee and roast malt notes. I actually prefer the rawer, fresher version"
"4.5"
"D- Good, Loved it but writing about it now. I don't know if it's something I'd want more ofmore than 1 of. Plus @ 13% ABV kind hard to session."
"flavor is really good, but overall drinkability is just okay, this one is just too strong and boozy to drink more than one. will try one again next year."
"D- A sipper or for desert would be fine. I could not drink 2 of these but glad I bought a four pack to have again"
"Good stout and well worth the hunt to find."
"Wow - black as oil coming out of the bottle. Heavy duty aromas of tobacco, licorice, malts, and bourbon. Nice first sip, but the flavor grows a bit out of sequence as too much might be going on at once. Overall drinkability is a bit hard, as this is a beer that requires a big meal prior in able to cut through the viscousness. A great beer, though, but not for the unexpected drinker."
"D - overall an excellent version of oaked imperial stout. very interesting and certainly worth trying."
"Poured a black opaque color, looks thick and syrupy as it is being poured. Very little evidence of a head, a beige feint line forms around the glass. The bourbon fragrance is strong, so strong I am giessing which distilleries barrels were used. There are touches of chocolate and dark roasted malt scents. The taste is strong, rich and robust, with chocolate, malty sweetness, with touches coffee and dried fruit. Then the bourbon comes in to compliment it all together, it finishes with a bit of a boozy flavor at the end. The feel is thick, rich and oily, as it slides across the palate. The surprise is I am expecting a little touch of a burn from alchol, but there is none. Everything about this beer is strong, though the look is little weak, but the aroma, taste, and feel are top notch. This is a great night cap beer or excellent with a cigar."
"Pitch black appearance with a coffee brown head. Aroma alone will knock your socks off. Just completely filled with bourbon and rich roasted malt flavors. Taste follows the nose. Bourbon, bourbon and more bourbon. Roasted malt and chocolate and coffee notes are abundant as well. I nice melding of many very strong characteristics, each of which assert themselves nicely. Full bodied, thick, creamy and luxurious mouthfeel. Beautiful. Alcohol is present, and noticeable, as it should be for a bourbon-barrel stout. It doesn't get better than this."
"If it wasn't so expensive, I could drink this beer all the time."
"The beer pours a thick viscous black with a very small little caramel colored head. The head dissipates in a few seconds leaving very little lacing. The smell hints a roasted malt and vanilla, but is overwhelmed by the bourbon. The flavor is similar to the smell with hints chocolate, vanilla, and roasted malt. The beer is overly sweet and there seems to be little bitterness to balance this. The feel of the beer is thick, and the alcohol isn't hidden whatsoever. The beer is almost hard to drink and certainly wouldn't want more than one in a sitting. Overall an interesting offering that I might come back to, but it isn't going to be a regular in my fridge."
"I love the complexity of this beer. Take a sip, let it sit, and then swallow. The flavor continues to change for a good minute. How many sips does it take to get to the bottom of my glass? I don't think I could keep track. I keep forgetting after shouting, ""Damn that's good!"""
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours jet black with virtually no head. Smell is chocolatey with strong bourbon scents. Taste is very alcohol heavy but delicious. This beer wows me with every drink. Light hot mouthfeel. This is very drinkable for being 13% ABV. Not sessionable but an outstanding IS. I love this brew!"
"Drinkability is way down due to the alcohol. Not a session beer. More of a get drunk and write a killer poem beer, if you're the Faulkner type anyway. Keep this one away from your friend who tends to go overboard."
"Mouthfeel is extremely filling. A fullbodied beer, very creamy and thick, low carbonation. Long, pleasant finish. Overall this have to be the best beer I've had together with Kaggen! Maybe the absolute best one."
"2007 vintage in a 12 oz bottle. Poured black with a small brownish head. Left a small collar around the glass. Overwhelmed by the bourbon smell and taste. I did not enjoy this beer. I have enjoyed other beers by this brewer, but this one did not impress me."
"Pitch black, no head. Strong bourbon aroma, caramel. Rasins and vanilla as well. Some coconut and a good amount of alcohol. Sweet caramel flavor, nutty finish. A bit too thin. Aroma and flavor are great and have me coming back. A bit overated in my opinion."
"This beer pours thick and black like motor oil with a small thin brown head that quickly disappears. Huge bourbon smell, with chocolate and coffee. Tastes of huge bourbon, chocolate vanilla and The mouthfeel is extremely thick and syrupy with a full body and relatively low carbonation. Drinkability is high considering the high abv. One of my new favorite Imperial Stouts."
"Taste: More vanilla, oak, and bourbon in the taste. The alcohol warms the throat on the way down. Smokey aftertaste. The mouthfeel is thinner than the smell and taste would lead you to believe."
"There must have been claw marks on the inside of those barrels. This stout has absorbed so much of the bourbon character but astoundingly maintained its thick, heavy roast Imperial Stout qualities; it's a marriage not a balancing act. This is a drink designed for contemplation and reflection. It demands respect and drinks with grace and refinement. Given all the choices in the world there are few beers that I would rather savour."
"Delicious beer unlike almost anything I've drank in the past. It has a deep dark color with a nice dark brown head that was fairly thin. The smell is very sweet with caramel and vanilla. The taste is great, like I already mentioned, thick malt presence although not in an overwhelming way, more in the taste. I also taste that vanilla and some raisins and caramel, I also taste something that's not really coffee like but some of that style of robustness is hittin my tongue. Their is enough hops to notice it, but this is definitely strong on the malt. The aftertaste is good although I do feel a little of the alcohol burning as I exhale. I'm guessing this beer is going to improve as it gets a bit warmer and I'm also excited to try this again after it ages a year or so."
"Incredibly complex even though the predominate flavor that jumps out is bourbon. Tons of caramel and toffee flavors. Incredibly smooth in swallowing, but fairly sweet and sticky mouthfeel that really rides the top and bottom of your mouth. Great roasted malts that produce a very nice texture and flavor assortment. Some cocoa and vanilla are present in the background, and are greatly overshadowed by the bourbon. Very bread-like/cracker after taste. Hints of oak are in the background as well. Definitely a slow sipper but a fantastic one at that."
"Definitely worth the cost - I can't wait to age the other 3 and see what I get. I've heard of people buying these each year and drinking aged sets vertically. I might have to give that a try."
"Overall Impressions: The bourbon is almost too much at first, but it is quickly balanced and makes for a fine sipping stout. A little more spicy oak (my favorite bourbon is George T. Stagg) and better presentation with a head and lacing would catapult this beer into the upper echelon. As it stands, it is one fine adult beverage."
"J"
"No matter who you are you should try this beer at least for the experience. I have had this offering from GI on two previous occasions. I have two more bottles and I really hope I can leave them in the cellar for a few more years before cracking into them."
"Drinkability....hmmmm....Ask yourself, do you like fizzy yellow beer even in winter? If yes, this may not be for you. This beer isn't messing around. For the ""full-flavor"" types out there, it is certainly drinkable!"
"Had another 2013 bottle on 6/5/14 that was bottled on 10/9/13, which had a nice dark tan 1 finger head that faded very slowly and left a layer on top. Smelled of vanilla, bourbon, dark fruit, chocolate and molasses; rich, sweet and complex, it hid the ABV well and was more like a port wine or merlot. Tastes very sweet with vanilla, bourbon, dark fruit like cherry, dates or chocolate dipped strawberry, sweet rum-like flavor, chocolate, licorice, brown sugar, and molasses; there is a bitterness like burnt coffee and syrup or toffee melted in it, almost like a dark chocolate malted ball candy that was dipped in booze. Perfectly hides the alcohol and slides down too easy with very minor heat. Excellent again."
"The mouthfeel is outstanding. Just the right amount of carbonation for its extreme thickness. The drinkability is fantastic for such a high abv/thick beer. Definitely one of my favorites."
"Overall, this is candy for a whiskey lover, but I found the bourbon to be a little distracting."
"As for drinkability I would say that at the price and the extreme, taste, and heaviness that this beer is anything but drinkable. The only redeaming quality here is the fact that this beer amazingily great. I won't slam any part of it. You will only want one at a time, but you will savor it and probably love it. If you don't send it my way - I love this beer! Slainte!!!"
"D: take it, hold it, and love it. Great beer and great sipper for anytime of the year. Could there be any better combo, bourbon and beer/stout. Ha! take a sip...feel that mild burn...oh yea! Immaculate brew!"
"I'm glad I'm going to have to oppurtunity to try this atleast two times more!"
"I anticipate with some aging this can be a truely exceptional beer."
"Robust, yet smooth beer. The flavors are very outgoing, and maybe a bit too much. Very dark with a decent head, doesn't really stick, and I wish it did - really makes each sip feel better in the mouth. Smell is quite good - very molasses and tons of sweet bourbon, and some spice underneath. Taste is also quite good, but I feel like there is so much bourbon and molasses that it isn't quite balanced. It seems to cover up the high alcohol content (13%) a little too much - I like to have a nice alcohol bite in a big and heavy beer like this. It is still remarkably warm and soothing, and the beer definitely gets better as you drink it, so I'll give it a 4.5 there. Feel is, like the general taste, silky smooth and very warming to the palate and throat. Maybe all that bourbon I'm tasting is actually the alcohol, but in that case it is extremely well masked (not hidden. masked). The alcohol may be masked well, but you certainly feel it after the bottle is near done - this is as strong as most wines, and it is so expensive ($24 for the 4 pack) that I can't give it a really high drinkability rating, but I certainly enjoyed this beer, and I really look forward to aging it and tasting it later on. If you're looking for a beer with a super outgoing character, definitely check this out - extremely memorable and every sip is very fulfilling."
"Overall, this beer is way too drinkable to be 13% ABV. I'm feeling pretty good after this bottle."
"Overall: My review may be a little skewed. This beer is dwarfed by the Older Viscosity I had recently. I'd say it's on par or slightly better than the Founder's Kentucky... so in short, this is a fantastic beer, especially if you're a bourbon fan."
"D= Wow, if I could afford this or if I could handle this all the time I would. I wish non-alcoholic beer tasted like this so I could just drink it all the time. This beer lives up to everything everyone has ever said about it. Amazing and delicious. I can't wait to have more. The new interesting things kept coming and hopefully will carry on to the next glass. This beer is an adventure."
"This beer pours a thick used motor oil black color. The head is a quarter inch of tan foam which recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of chocolate, graham crackers (it reminds me of smores), roasted malt and booze. The taste is like the aroma times ten. There is so much chocolate, and roasted male that it is nearly overwhelming....nearly but not quite. There is some firm heat in the finish, but it really adds to the experience. The mouthfeel is extremely full bodied with a vibrant, silky texture, and appropriately low carbonation. Overall, I have a true love for huge imperial stouts. Sure I couldn't drink them every day, but I love having one every other month or so. I really like how this stout isn't overpowered with hops. A hoppy stout (along with a hoppy hefe) is kind of beer I just can't stand. I could taste some hops in this beer, but they were in the background, and I'm sure will fade with age. It seems that a lot of other huge imperial stouts have coffee, or chocolate, of wood, or bourbon in them. I like that Bourbon County doesn't. It truly is a classic imperial stout, but bigger."
"Pours black with small mocha head. Virtually no retention or lacing. Looks a bit like a glass of paint. Smell was very boozy, too bozy for me. I found it to be a little distracting. Beneath the alcohol there was some toffee and vanilla cream. The taste wasnt terrible, the best part about this beer. A complex blend of caramel, vanilla, expresso, alcohol, and sweet chocolate syrup. Very thick mouthfeel. Perhaps the thickest, most dense beer I've ever had. Not the most drinkable beer. While I did enjoy it, I certainly did not fall in love with it. The look was off, the smell was overpowering, the taste was very intense, and it was heavy as a brick. Not to mention the ABV which will kick your butt."
"Will be going back to Ginger Man for this one."
"Anyway, I liked this beer a lot. Usually even with very strong beers I drink them too fast and too cold. I let this one sit out for a while before opening and then took about 45 minutes longer than usual to drink the 12oz. Very tasty stuff."
"I begin to realize about halfway into the glass how much I've already missed. This is a hugely complex beer. GIBCS deserves its spot on the top 100 not because it's the best of its style, but because it's one that keeps you coming back to explore further. It pushes the boundaries as to what beer is supposed to (and can) be, the kind that expands palates and helps create new styles."
"If this beer had a head, even a 1cm head, this would be the greatest beer I've ever had and would be deserving of a perfect 5.0 rating. I am glad I bought a four pack."
"Goose Island makes good beer,yet their truly greats are their experimental beers (Matilda, Pere' Jacques, Demolition, Burbon County), They truly have a knack for exceptional ""big"" beers."
"D - Very high. I will definitely buy this beer again"
"D-I liked the interplay of all of the rich, big flavors in this beer, making it immensly comlex and enjoyable. I sipped this one slowly after work on the coldest day in Minnesota in years, and boy did it warm me up fast! Having drank a bottle of the 2008, I can't wait to see how my additional couple bottles of this one will taste in a year or two."
"Overall, an outstanding beer. May well be my new favorite. Each sip seems like a different experience. I can't wait to try the versions from other years."
"Pours almost pitch black with a very small dark tan head that fades very quickly. Smell of sweet cocoa powder, slight coffee, and bourbon. Flavors of dark chocolate, sweet maltiness balanced by a roasted grain. The bourbon then comes on very powerfully, but its not just bourbon flavored, which I like. Finishes with cocoa powder and vanilla and a strong alcohol burn. Perfectly carbonated, with a thick chewy body and a strong alcohol burn. very good beer and the 13% abv is hidden well. Perfect dessert dinner. Will age nicely."
"One of my new favorite beers. A must have for anyone with even a faint appreciation for bourbon. Updated 12.09 after having Black Tuesday make this beer look almost pedestrian in comparison"
"Future outlook: For a non-bourbon drinker, this beer did quite well by me...however...this beer isn't legal in Ohio due to an archaic law placing an ABV% cap for beer @12%...pfffft..."
"Drinkability - This is definitely one you want to take your time on. Definitely not something that should be rushed through."
"Good stuff!"
"If you're a stout drinker this ought to be in your fridge or on your list."
"Notes: If you're lucky enough to live somewhere that you can find this beer distributed (or make regular holiday trips back to the midwest to see family) hunt down this hard to find treat. It's worth every penny!"
"2008 12 oz single bought at ""Habits"" in Salem Oregon $4.50 a bottle. Great brown sugar,espresso coffee, vanilla and wood aromas vVery dark brown almost black beer, creamy light brown head. Flavour is similar to the aroma, but more alcoholic.Bourbon really shows. The mouthfeel is the greatest thing about this beer,thick,silky ,creamy like a good quality milk shake! Good beer indeed. But i prefered Full Sails Bourbon Barrel beers better."
"D- def a sipper, better as it warms. Any burbon drinker will love this beer. If you are looking for an imperial stout this is not your normal one. But if you have the chance try it, i wouldn't pick up a 6pack of this stuff"
"Overall- On top of Bourbon aging, massive malt presence. If ever a beer was crafted to be had with a cigar this is it. Store clerk told me it tasted like cough syrup, maybe he drinks Coors or Bud. Some folks just want less from life. I wish I had bought everything bottle they had."
"drinkability- a great sipper beer. took me about an hour to finish 1 12oz bottle."
"Overall: OK. I am a little harsh on this review for such a highly rated beer. I had some high expectations for this beer... I was expecting something a lot smoother and easier on the palate.(This may have done me in) BUT I was wrong... It tasted like a lesser %ABV Sam Adams Utopia. BCS was waaay too overwhelming. Too heavy for my tastes. I've never had a beer that made the hair on my arms stand up until I had this beer. Finally in the end... It became a drain pour and I must say I will not try this again. That being said, Goose Island is one of my favorite breweries in the world. I can't recommend this but I highly recommend their other beers."
"D_This is a bit too boozy and sweet for me but I can see why people like it. I prefer dryer and more bitter flavours in my Imp Stouts."
"This beer was just creamy and velvety on the palate. It seemed to just coat my whole mouth on its way down. It was a very nice choice for a cold winter night. I will have to pick up another bottle to age and see how those flavors blend over a year or two."
"DRINKABILITY: Strong, I can't drink a full one, not in one sitting. I have tried and tried, but I have to back away, do a shot of bourbon, and then try again."
"(2007 edition.) Pours an opaque off-black; the thin brown head dissipates quickly, leaving a pale ring that lingers down the glass. The smell is salty booze, very strong, with perhaps some notes of date or prune. The taste comes on again very salty, like smoked bluefish, with lots of molasses and some wood and leather in the middle range, giving way to a taste like dates soaked in soy sauce: all in all very complex and fascinating, but not necessarily pleasant. The carbonation is slight, and the viscosity is dense. I'm not sure I'll get to the bottom of this bottle, but this is a unique and well-made beer."
"Big Boozie Syrup!"
"Im sure this would be an excellent beer with age."
"The mouthfeel was decent, not overwhelmingly thick or oily. Drinkability was low on the scale, even taking into account the high abv %. Couldn't taste much alcohol actually, just sweet- pungent-acidic-vinegary-soy sauce. There were mild bourbon notes to be fair. This review probably won't go over very well, but it is my honest opinion. This is my first bourbon barrel-aged stout, but I have tried a few imperial stouts. I also should say that I do enjoy bourbon, so this is not a biased review."
"Wow. What a treat. There's not too many beers I can't buy here in PA, but it's absolutely a shame that this is one of them. I'll be doing whatever I can to find some more of this."
"**Readers Note - I drank this simultaneously with an Expedition Stout, which may have tainted my review."
"O- I LOVE this style of beer, high ABV, tastes like the barrel it was aged in. It's something you have to try. It's one of those sipping beers. You would not like this if you're not into hard liquor. If I had to say anything negative. The bourban is almost too much. It's hard to get any stout characterstics if the bourban is too over powering. This one is almost too overpowering. I still like it though. Maybe that's just me."
"It has a dark brown color to it (Almost black). When poured into a large mouth glass it had a small creamy head. It had a strong aroma of bourbon with a hint of fruity sweetness. It had a sweet alcohol taste with lots of bourbon flavor. It didn't have the stout taste I was looking for. I prefer the taste of beer over the taste of bourbon. This 13% abv stout is definetly for the serious beer drinker."
"Overall: well, this is one exceptional and complex beer. Certainly one of the best and most interesting stouts Ive ever tried. Worth every penny, or ""öre"" as we say in Sweden. Skål!"
"This beer will enter a pantheon in my mind of ""beers that have exceptional bourbon flavor"". its just enough bourbon flavors for this bourbon fan, but not over the top (ie. founders backwoods bastard)"
"Pours very dark brown with about an 1/8"" head that stuck around. Aroma heavy on the bourbon (but I love that kind of thing), with a bit of wood char, some dried dark fruit, and a spoonful of caramel. Flavor more of the same: lots of bourbon, vanilla, caramel, chocolate, coffee, toffee, and all the rest of that goodness. This is an incredible beer, and if you can get your hands on it, do so without hesitation."
"Overallthis is an excellent imperial stout that is excess in every way."
"I don't know where Bourbon County is, but I want to live there."
"A note to myself: This is great beer. Do not drink the ones you have left for some time to come. Wait until at least 2012 on your next bottle!"
"Fine job, Greg."
"Obviously all of these were sippers but the drinkability was as good as could be expected with a 13% ABV beer. I am glad I got a few more of these to have over the holidays, and I can't wait to see how the 08 develops over the course of a year or two."
"Overall: One of the best beers I have ever tried. This beer is great, period. No matter who you are you should try this beer at least for the experience. I loved last years (have one in the cellar) and I love this years. I will be stocking up on this gem."
"D: The '08 is just great, really easy to drink. Could last you a long time. Perfect for Christmas / a special day when you want to savor and enjoy every sip of your beverage. Nice and relaxing after a long day with innumerable nieces, nephews, brothers, sisters, and parents! The '06 isn't as easy to drink as the '08. Overall I prefer the '08, a little bit smoother, more rounded-out in flavors. The really strong alcohol / bourbon taste of the '06 is a bit overpowering to truely enjoy this beer as I believe it should be, one sip at a time."
"nice."
"D: I have been savoring this bottle for hours and every sip is just as good as the first one. It is massive, but I relish this opportunity to have a full bottle to myself. No, you won't drink a four-pack of this stuff in a night, but you wouldn't drink a full bottle of the finest bourbon in a sitting either. This beer perfects what it sets out to do."
"As delicioius as this is, sharing a 12oz was plenty for one sitting (including other beers). This is the definition of sip, savor and share. Again, absoutely delicious, but extremely bold and boozy."
"I'm glad to have 3 more of the suckers to cellar away, and check up on."
"4/3/4/2/10 (2.3/5)"
"This is one of my favorite beers and everyone should try it once. It's big, bold and fun to drink... looking forward to aging the remaining 3"
"Overall an exquisite bourbon barrel aged stout that will most definitely take your tongue for the ride of its life. A prime example of a style that's starting to show weaker substitutes by way of jumping on the bandwagon. Park you butt for a half hour or so and enjoy a bottle of this nocturnal nectar. Spectacular stuff."
"I'm lucky to have been to Goose Island several times, one of my favorite brewpubs. I had this stout there about ten years ago, served in a snifter . . to have this available in bottles now is a real treat. Grab it while you can or you'll have to go to Chicago."
"One of the best beers i've ever tried. It has certain similarities to the beer Kaggen - Stormaktsporter by Närke Kulturbryggeri but it's not as balanced. You can't miss out on this one!"
"I have not encountered a beer with such an intense flavor. I took almost 2 hours to drink the first one, and the second one was not much quicker. Impossible to session, but extremely enjoyable as a single glass. It is very difficult to rate this beer, as it is very different than other beers I have tasted. I am also curious how it will age; will the flavors become more subtle, and will the bourbon flavor blend with the other tastes? Overall a fascinating beer."
"I've never seen any stout when poured that was so dark, almost black, with no foam what so ever and not a stich of lace. The smell of bourbon was what first came to mind. The aroma was of bourbon only for me. But, the taste was not only of a bourbon flavor, but, a hint of smoke and leather. It poured so thick, I don't ever remember any stout that thick when poured. A nice balance of different flavors. I'll let it age for awhile, about a year, then try again!"
"Drinkability: Very very low, again at 13%abv I would have alot of trouble drinking more than one of these..."
"Enjoy...s..l..o..w..l..y. Life isn't meant to be rushed all the time!"
"This is definitely one of the best beers I've had."
"T: No surprise, massive bourbon and boozy flavors immediately, barely resembling a ""beer"". Taking your time with sipping it, the alcohol starts to burn a little more, but more the chocolately, malty backbone comes through. This is a heavy, full bodied beer, with very little carbonation and coats the entire mouth. The finish is amazing and lingers forever with dark chocolate and bourbon flavors and a surprising hop pinch. Overall, a very impressive beer, but I'm a little disappointed in the end. KBS is one of my favorite beers, and while just as big as this seems more balanced and complex, but also more drinkable. For me this beer falls closer to an after dinner speciality than a beer I would frequently return to."
"This was not what I expected. The smell was typical for an imperial stout. I got slight hints of bourbon and no beer. The color was jet black with a brownish little to no head. The flavor was much better then I expected. It had big hints of caramel and vanilla on the finish. better than i thought. will get you drunk"
"Drinkability: Extraordinarily well-balanced between the bourbon and stout elements"
"also bought a 2008 abyss for tomorrow, should be interesting to compare!"
"mouthfeel is oily, creamy, slick, roasty, sweet, hot, amazing!!!"
"The drink is silky and full-bodied with light carbonation, and is, without a shadow of a doubt, one savory little sipper. I'd heard and read so much hype about this brew I was just dying to try it, and I'm happy to report that BCS is ""all that""-- no foolin'. Many thanks to Buckeye-lovin' Dr. Brad for this magnificent bottle of brew!"
"Had the 2008 vintage, thanks for finally making it to California. Dark as night, with nice brown lacing. Taste, lets just say if you don't like bourbon, you need not apply. Lots of chocolate, and again no shortage of bourbon. Mouthfeel is a warm coating feel that just makes you want to curl up with this one. Drinkability is great, but approach slowly. This beer should be cellared for a few years, but drinking it now ain't too shabby either."
"Great Beer!"
"d- i could drink this beer all night...of course, at 13%, i think it would be a relatively short night."
"The taste was, whoooa, what a wallup of bourbon attitude. It brought the whiskey in the nose then on the palate and finished with a smooth sweetness and a slight bitterness on the end. In the mouth slapped the buds into submission then burned on the way down. This one is definitely a sipper. Not a bad brew but it takes a while to get over the 13 abv."
"Not for the weak. Worthy trying, but at $6.99 a bottle (cheap midwest prices), I'm not sure if I'll be getting this one again."
"Wow! This is a pretty BIG beer, and a great drinking experience. Poured jet black into a tulip with a small, wispy brown head that died down pretty quickly. Great vanilla, bourbon, and malty aroma. The taste was outstanding, with a malt with just the right amount of sweetness, with vanilla, oak, and bourbon notes in the mix. A little anise like, earthy bitterness at the finish. Very creamy, luscious mouth feel, and the 13% alchohol level is barely detectable, but I definitely felt it. It's not cheap at $20 for a four-pack of 12 oz bottles, but to me, it's definitely worth it."
"I really love this kind of ale and recommend it only to those that know what the heyell they're gettin into, no joke! Truly one of the biggest i've tasted and am enjoying immensely."
"NOTES: BBCSD-E2"
"(I actually like it fresh and hot. Gets a little thick/sweet/gooey the longer it sits. Needs that boozy bite to balance the thick sweetness.)"
"It finally made its way to San Diego! And it is everything I heard it was. Pours midnight black, with a short tan head. Rich, full aroma of choclate dipped in bourbon and wrapped in leather. The taste is sooo good. Chocolate and roasty malt topped with caramel. More bourbon and oak with hints of smoke, vanilla, and coffee. The prevalence of the alcohol only enhances the flavors. I love you Bourbon County Stout."
"This is without a doubt a sipper, but an incredible one. I can't imagine anyone liking this beer who doesn't like the taste of bourbon, because it is here in a big way. Personally, I love bourbon, so I love this. A fantastic beer that I will be certain to pick up again and again in the future."
"Incredible, wonderful stout. Completely exceeded my expectations-- I was expecting this to just be dominated by alcohol, but they managed to do wonders here. I'm in love."
"Pours a deep dark thick black color, with very little head. Smell is huge! Lots of oak, vanilla and smokey roasted malt. Layers and layers of taste in this one. Caramel malt, figs, raisins, licorice all compete for attention. Mouthfeel is super thick, a formidable beer for any taste buds. Drinkability.... Hmm.... it is definitely a slow sipping stout. Strong ABV make this a hefty stout for sure."
"D - An outstanding beer! Seriously, seriously good shit. This is a little to sweet and heavy for regular drinking and thats the only reason (and maybe the price) that this isn't getting fives across the board. This is one of the world's finest brews IMO."
"Holy mother of dark beers,this is as black as they get. Dirty motor oil with the same visible viscosity,thick and mid-night black. The head is smaller than your average stout,but I can tell already this is no ordinary stout,no lacing,but I'm not one to complain with such a huge ABV. This smells of Bourbon and oak mostly with chard burnt notes that smell like a pair of jeans the morning after a fall wiener roast. This is a sweet malt monster coating the pallet with caramel,chocolate,bourbon is very pronounced,lots of aged barrel and earthy burnt oak flavors. Alcohol becomes more apparent as this warms. The mouthfeel is over the top,this is one heavy/full bodied mofo,and I love it,I do wish it had a touch more carbonation to round off a more creamy feel. This is a serious beer,enjoy!!"
"The drinkability is quite good, however the hidden alcohol and the overall thick texture keeps you from being able to drink many of these in a row. I will say this, any chance I get to purchase and save some of this, I will. Imagine what it will taste like in a couple of years, when the flavor should be even more complex. Great beer."
"Overall, this was a monster. Amazing beer and well worth the $21 for the 4 pk. This beer took a while to finish. I highly recommend it to anyone."
"Drinkability: Delicious. I will be buying in quantity every release."
"D - I had to kill the Beer Specialist, Mike (Slayer3604), at Whole Foods, Glendale, for it. Ha ha! JK! He's still alive - barely. Mike's the man about beer - and your not."
"D: Even though I only drink this type of beer on occasion and don't go out of my way for big alcohol taste in beer, it was very drinkable. I finished it much quicker than I expected and that is always a good sign. I could easily have had a couple more although it is deceptively potent. A fine brew for Goose Island to celebrate their 1000th batch."
"This was so totally worth the wait and the effort. Worthy of seeking out."
"Mouthfeel was smooth and velvety. Minimal carbonation. Dense, milky almost. Very drinkable."
"Poured a jet black with a dirty white head. Nose was heavy bourbon as was the taste. I did not notice much other than bourbon on this brew. It was good but expected a more robust flavor. The ABV was very well masked. Burbon dominance. A good brew but I actually wanted more vanilla, oak, cocoa and everything else. Maybe I missed somethng. It takes more than bourbon to make a grwat beer these days."
"2008 Version: Poured a deep dark brown with a small brown head with nice lacing. Aroma is incredible combinatio of rich dark malts, caramel, oak, and bourbon, which you can seemingly can smell from miles away. Flavor is equally impressive, caramel malts,vanilla, a little bit of dark fruit, smoke all with a hint of bourbon. but the bourbon is not overpowering though, just complimentary. Full mouthfeel that leads to a nice warming finish. A top notch beer"
"Notes: I had a bottle from last years batch when it came out and hated it. Decided to revisit it a year later and lo and behold: This shit is fantastic!"
"Very heady and heavy mouthfeel, but the tastes were less upfront than the smell. I didn't feel this was very drinkable, too heavy alcohol, too much and this coming from someone who loves dark beers and barleywines. Expected more from the high price, and actually I'd suggest pouring smaller since its so potent tasting."
"Drinkability is dangerously high. This is actually a fantastic breakfast beer - and a night-cap! The problem is you'll want more then one, which is tough to pull off. Still, you will be tempted to try, trust me!"
"As the one I had is already aged 1 year, I'm guessing this thing needs a good 3-5 years to really smooth out. I'm betting it becomes exceptional once aged properly. I'll be cellaring some of these bad boys."
"D- Smooth, but the hotness makes it a little harder to drink"
"Tremendous1"
"The taste is sweet, thick, warming, caramel and the bourbon barrels leave their own signature. Very little carbonation and pretty drinkable. This is definitely a distinctive stout that is quite acceptable."
"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer at all. I love RIS and enjoy bourbon. This just missed the mark."
"Pours out like motor oil. Deep black, with brown edges and a small mocha colored head which fades quickly but leaves lacing. Some small chunkies hang near the bottom. Nose is thick vanilla bourbon, with heavy malts and oak alcohol. First sip is burnt charred oak chips, with molasses and dense caramel. More alcohol on warming, and some brown sugar sweetness. Very nice. Mouthfeel is dense and thick, fitting the taste of the beer. Drinkability may be hurt by the ABV, but it's a damn fine beer."
"Great if you like bourbon, but might be a bit much for those who don't. Fortunately, I do."
"D- I got 3 cases of this in at the store, probably going to pick another 4 pack up. jesus this is worth your money!"
"My opinion is if I wanted to have a bourbon I would have a bourbon not a beer that tastes like bourbon. To each his own though."
"Had this one w/my wifes homemade raspberry swirl cheesecake and IMHO a rich sweet treat to balance this beer is heaven."
" Body is full and robust, but not overly heavy or oily like some imperial stouts. A light stickiness coats the tongue and helps to move the warming alcohol down the back of the throat. This is a true pleasure to drink, although the strength and heaviness make it a special occasion brew. Still, this is an excellent addition to the local beer selection, and I look forward to seeing more Goose Island beers here in the near future."
"Definitely a sipping beer. This reminds me of eating a decadent chocolate cake that's almost too rich, yet at the same time I wouldn't trade it for anything less. A fabulous, inventive beer. I will be buying more, and am excited to see what happens with some age."
"Drinking the same beer five months apart didn't reveal any appreciable differences, save for a slight reduction in alcohol (from burning to warming) and the pitted fruit flavors coming forward. Worth aging, but hard to resist!"
"This baby is thick as syrup, burns your mouth and very smooth going down. I like it quite a bit, but I don't see drinking more than one in a sitting. Maybe one before a meal then one an hour afterwards for dessert."
"Very rich, one of the better imperial stouts I've had lately even though this style has become hard for me to embrace after liking it quite a bit in the past."
"It has an opaque color that strongly resembles dirty motor oil. The head is tricolor it is brown, tan and off white. It has really tight lace. It smells like chocolate rum balls. Roasty and alcohol aroma is predominant. It also has a chocolate and alcohol taste. It is a warming beer. Full mouthfeel. This is a good sipper."
"If I had to choose a single word to describe this beer, it'd surely be DECADENT. Just ridiculously over the top with the flavors and aromas. This beer is dessert and breakfast in one."
"(Revisited 3/4/09) - Snap, crackle, and POP! Can beer get more exciting than this? Not as much heat here, but damn, that barrel aging effect really shines. Perfect ""5" for the taste."
"This beer can certainly do with some aging. I think the flavors from the bourbon need to mellow more. Going to put some back for a few years and see what happens. Which begs one question: if the twist off caps have inferior oxidation problems, why did they use it on such a cellarable beer?"
"Drinkability is remarkably high for a beer of this stature. The alcohol us mellowed enough to easily be enjoyed. Although, good luck taking more than one in a sitting."
"Drinkability- Still haven't found my perfect 5 beer. I've seen about a handful of really strong stouts that have looked a bit better. But this is about as close as it gets. I'm glad I have a few 4-packs...I may even try to grab another couple....definitely worth $5 a bottle. A must try if seen...or be regretful the rest of your life."
"Amazing nose, complexity and an endless finish. Would be syrup if the alc wasn't 13%. 2008 Bottle. Not sure why you'd want to age this brew as it drank so nicely right now. Though I have a couple vintages back from a trade so I'll see what all the hooplah is when I sample those. Dark and milk chocolate with rasberries and blue fruit. Silky texture. Vanilla and oak with some faint spice. Only a tiny bit is needed as so much flavor unfolds on the palate. $20 for a 4 pack of 12oz seems expensive but after this I say this is cheap for how high the quality is. Amazing!"
"A solid bourbon barrel beer. Probaly not my favorite, but top notch nevertheless."
"Good Goobily Woo this is one hell of a good beer! Thanks to Route66pubs for hooking me up on this one. I have never been a bourbon drinker because I am not a big fan of that much alcohol warmth. This is a great way to experience all the wonderful flavors of bourbon without the bite. There is no mistaking that this is one Mother of a complex beer. Bourbon on the nose with layers of vanilla, caramel, toasted almond and chocolate exposing themselves with each delicious sip. Started out just south of room temperature and only got better the longer it warmed. At thirteen percent, definitely a sipper, which is good because you will want to make it last!"
"Pours an extremely dark color with brown and ruby hues glinting through the edges. The aroma is nice. It is of coffee and very much of dark chocolate. The taste is the best aspect of this beer, as it should be. The roasted coffee and chocolate flavors really come out and it is great. Great beer."
"A: Deep chocolate with a hint of light seeping by at the edges, spotty and erratic patches of head, thick lacing due to what I can only assume is the serious viscosity - 5.0, S: Fragrant aromas, bourbon and oak as you'd expect, very pleasing and subdued wood with traces of chocolate malt and some ash - 5.0, T: Absolutely amazing flavor, mildly molasses, extremely sweet, bourbon, espresso - 5.0, M: An extremely creamy beer that lingers on your tongue for some time after the taste - 5.0, D: After 100's of samplings, I've found my first 10 (aka 5 star beer), this beers intensity and flavor is amazing, though high in alcohol it is an extremely drinkable beer - 5.0"
"Finish is almost unending, increadibly smooth & soft, with more anise & pudding flavors."
"D - Tiny bubbles, velvety smooth, heavy (HEAVY) body. A fine example of a good Imperial stout body. Not a session beer by any means, of course."
"Big roast malt, mocha, caramel, boozy aroma. Smoother up front than some Imperials, flowing nicely throughout. Great array of flavors. Caramel, mocha, roast malt, oak, raisin ending with some molasses and a hint of coffee bitter. Some hop balancing throughout, but not a real strong presence. Very full bodied and sticky. Alcohol almost completely hidden, shows up more as it warms. This was really well done, better than I was expecting for being so new. Good thing I have 7 more of these."
"The aroma is beautiful. The mouthfeel is beautiful. But personally, I prefer a touch of bourbon in my stout, rather than hints of stout in my bourbon. This is definitely a beautifully constructed brew and a solid example of the style, but not my favorite. The bourbon is a bit over the top for me, and I know some of that could be that this bottle was fresh. Definitely worth sampling of you have the opportunity (should be a bit easier now that it's seeing wider distribution)."
"Notes: One big ass, steroid-injected, Bourbon-flavored stout that produces some sweet maple-flavored oaky tones complimented by a vanilla twist that truly kicks your ass up and down the block. I absolutely love this, and wish it were available all the time. As it is, I feel truly blessed to have been able to get my hands on some of this hard to find brew, especially in SoCal. A delicious treat for the senses!"
"This beer pours incredibly dark, with a thick brown head and sticky lacing. The smell is intense with a roasted smokiness, sweet molasses, burnt sweetened coconut, malts and alcohol. The taste is intense. The flavor is a bombshell of various tongue teasers. Bourbon/Sherry like flavors, molasses, rasins, roasted chocolate, smokey wood. The mouthfeel is very thick and smooth with good carbonation. I wouldn't think one could drink a lot of this at once but it's a very drinkable, interesting and exciting brew. Nice..."
"A vigorous pour could barely produce any head in this solid black brew. I can smell the bourbon from the bottle soon after I pop the cap. The aroma is bourbon, vanilla, oak, hard to tell if there's a beer under there. The taste is very complex! First you get hit with the bourbon and oak then some roast, then some alcohol, then a bit of hop bitterness finish with a smooth bourbon roast. Its really tasty, but I like bourbon too. Thick body, oily turning to creamy mouthfeel. Light carbonation. Great Bourbon that someone spilled some beer into :)"
"I was totally surprised how good this stuff is. I hadn't even heard of it but the quality and flavors are fantastic. I wish I could get my own stout up to 13%!"
"D - So sticky sweet and heavy that I can't handle much more than one. A great bourbon and vanilla bomb for sure, but just too sweet for me."
"Overall: I like barrel aged products like this, and Bourbon County is a solid and overall tasty example of the style. I doubt I will be buying very much of this again soon though simply because Goose Island has priced it into elite territory at $22 per 4 pack. I think it's a very good beer, but I would much rather buy something like Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout at a full fiver less per 4 pack, or non-barrel premium products like Bell's Expedition at a full fiver less for a six pack. If money is no concern and you like this kind of beer it's a winner though. Well worth trying for any fan of the style."
"Aroma is bourbon, vanilla and burnt coffee. Overall I was pretty disappointed by the taste. Poured it side by side with a different barrel aged stout and the other blew this one away. The bourbon flavor is overpowering. High alcohol flavor. 13%. I think this beer would do better after a couple of years of aging. As the bottle suggests it would go well with a cigar. Not for the feint of heart."
"as much as i like how this beer is treating me, with the high abv and the heavy feeling it leaves me i dont think i could put back more than one in a night. overall a fantastic beer. yum"
"D- Sipper but no thanks until this ones got some age."
"Overall: One of the most enjoyable beers I've ever had!!! Great beer and a must, must, must try!!!"
"D- Six ounces is perfect. Don't get me wrong, I love this beer...but six ounces is enough for one night."
"**Just had another one of these and it was WAY less bourbon flavored than before. Much more vanilla, chocolate notes, really thick and velvety on the palate. Great, complex beer."
"The beer is pitch black with a tan head. It was poured with a centimeter in head without much retention. The nose on the beer has a oak/bourbon hint to it with some hints of roasted/chocolate hints coming through. The beer has a bitterness coming through with the roasted malts, but a huge bourbon/oak flavour that makes the beer taste more like booze. The alcohol is a bit overpowering. The main flavour is definitely the bourbon flavour initially, but when the beer hits room temperature more roasted/chocolate flavours come through. The bitterness lingers; with the strong oak flavour and the bitterness makes the beer a sipper. The mouthfeel is thick as fuuck, exactly what one would expect. It's drinkable, but a bit too much alcohol."
"D: Great beer but I couldn't handle more than 1 in a night. Goes down surprisingly well for being 13%"
"Drinkability was None for me, bourbon like taste was way to overpowering for me to enjoy this. Hopefully the next RIS I try goes better."
"I cannot wait to see what a few years of age will do to this beer. Seek this out!"
"D-No thanks all the time but possiblly one of the greatest sippers I have ever had."
"taste is velvety and thick, strong chocolate cream that is oh so smooth. goes down easy but stings in the finish, the bourbon is evident in the finish along with some woody char. definitely a good representation of this style, and holy shit it's %13 ABV!"
"4/5/5/4/4"
"Definitely something to seek and savor. More motivation to visit family in the Chicagoland area more often and to bring some back for the cellar. This could even out with a little more time but even now it drinks down much more quickly than anticipated. A classic."
"Drinkability- Admittingly, this isn't the most drinkable beer ever this fresh. When I had the 2007 a couple months ago it was much smoother and the drinkability was probably a full point better than the fresh '08 (I'm splitting the difference for my review score fyi). This thing only gets better. What's funny is I'm making it sound like its bad fresh; far from it. This is an amazing beer that I've thoroughly enjoyed every single time I've had it. Seek this out. Now."
"Tastes of sweet chocolate and bourbon whiskey. Some cherry and plum come through, too. The 13% ABV is really apparent once you breath in after swallowing. Full bodied and slick as oil. Very good sipper beer. Excellent!"
"Overall, I'm sure that this sample wasn't cellared in the best way, but I still thought this was fantastic. Really brilliant stuff. I'm anxious to try the other years."
"D- This was 13%? wow. did not realize that. Definitely an imperial stout but I would have guessed 9%. This one ages nicely and is very tasty. I would love to have it again! Thanks for the trade and the extra bottle!"
"I wish that I would have never had the bad experience with bourbon that I had 7 years ago. As much as I tried to ignore it, every sip I took brought that mental image back. If you are a bourbon drinker, you will love this beer."
"Bottom line: Grab some bottles, drink a few, cellar the rest!"
"D - For the style, very, but overall, c'mon."
"M + D: Big, rich, and full with a stickiness towards the end + over the lips. Alcohol heat is evident on the end. This has aged quite nicely... with the big alcohol, I imagine it could be a little hot and large for my palate when it's fresh."
"I'm not a stout fan, and I'd still consider this one of the 5-10 best beers I've tried in recent memory."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability- rich and warm, but surprisingly smooth. This is defiantly a sipper. You can't drink too many of these with that high ABV, but it has a lot of flavor."
"Be ready for this one. This is certainly a sipper. I understand the ABV is in the neighborhood of 16%. Now that fall is upon us in the midwest. This is a great beer to get comfortable with. The bourbon is very present both in aroma and taste. Heavy flavor of bourbon, oak, dark chocolate and even a bit of vanilla. You almost want to chew this beer instead of drinking it. The beer pours well and develops a remarkably nice head. The beer just improves with the ability to warm while opening a bit. You will taste the bold flavors for a long time. I will venture to the cigar store and then to Binny's for a bottle and simply lounge in the hot tub one of these cooler nights. The effect will certainly state ""lights out""."
"D: God, even though this is a monster, this is goddamn delicious. I'm so glad I have 3 more! I could never drink more than 1 though...I wouldn't want to either. These are to be preserved and experienced...not drink on a whim."
"Overall the beer has a great complex malty profile with lots of bourbon flavor to it. Don't pass this one up if you enjoy a good bourbon stout."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Heavy on the palate with a dry finish. Leaves the lips sticky. Carbonation is extremely low, not even really noticeable less its looked for. I can't ask for more with a beer like this in terms of mouthfeel, it is perfect. This is one that you can't drink all night, but one that you'll definitely be coming back to. This is a perfect beer to it back and sip on for a while, I can see it being perfect after one has just come in from a snowy, wintery night. I'll be picking this up again, however, I'm not sure how soon, it is a pretty pricy drink."
"One could age this beer for a couple years if not more and it would be amazing. Its great now, but let it mature and it will be great."
"D= A definite sipper, this is one of the best big stouts I have ever had, and definitely worthy of the hype. Get yourself some of this beer post-haste!!!"
"Drinkability: The 'overpowering' sweetness and alcohol make this one an average at best and that's being generous."
"Mouthfeel is rich and silky. Drinkability is excellent, but its definitely a sipper; its got more flavor than fits between my jaws."
"Bourbon County Stout is an Imperial Stout of the highest order, for the bourbon lover an absolute must-try. It may cause you to grow hair in funny places, but it's well worth it."
"I believe pwoods provided me with this excellent sample."
"Overall: hardcore beer at it's hardcorest. Seduces you, like your buddy's kid sister at a kegger. I want another bottle or four to age."
"2007 bottle. This is one of the best stouts I've ever had. Extreme quantities of bourbon and vanilla go down my gullet with ease. Definitely the most pronounced bourbon I have ever experienced in a beer. Thick body with carbonation on the lower side. It may be 13% alcohol and strong as hell, but what a great stout."
"D: An excellent brew but you probably wouldn't want that many in one sitting given the 13% abv"
"I'm going back to the store that still had some '07 stock tomorrow. I'd like to pick up another fourer & see what several months or years might do to this beer."
"Coming in I had no idea what this would be like. I was amazed at how good it was. This is certainly one of those must try beers. Can't wait to taste some more after they have aged a bit. This might be my favorite beer of all time, I might have to try and score a case."
"I don't think they fucked with the recipe much on this one; it's nearly identical to the '06, but younger. Hotter, slightly more vibrant but less nuanced coffee and chocolate flavors."
"Overall, the definition of one and done. I'll mark off my list and never speak of this one again."
"To quote Beerfest: ""I wish it were Winter and we could make it into ice blocks and skate on it! Then melt it in the spring time and drink it!"""
"M: Full-bodied and velvety on the tongue and roof of my mouth, with a looong finish - Sublime. I highly recommend this one. This beer has joined the ranks of being in my 5 all-time favorite Imperial stouts. Absolutely fantastic."
"D- alcohol isnt as well hidden as i would have liked, but its 13% thats the biggest drawback to drinkability. almost too strong for its own good. the bottle i had was from 2007, ill try this one again in a couple of months when the 2008s come out."
"(Enjoyed this one at Hopleaf)"
"Smooth as silk. Great as an after dinner treat. Drikability is the only downfall, as it's VERY rich (not to mention the 13% ABV). I definitely wouldn't have more than one. That said, this is one awesome beer."
"god i want more"
"I could have this frequently, especially with cigars and as a hangout beer. I wish it was more available. Sooo delicious. if you haven't had this, try it."
"Would drink this again, falters as it warms but definitely very approachable, so bourbon-y and delicious... and I don't even like bourbon that much. Recommended."
"Pours a very deep black color, although with very little head and almost no lacing. I was very disappointed with this beer, as I expected a stout with some bourbon lacing, not a pint of bourbon with some stout lacing. The scent and taste are nearly all bourbon flavors, so strong that no stout attributes come through. This also causes the whole thing to be very rough. It's not at all balanced. Not a good beer, which is a shame after the other wonderful 'big' beers I've had of Goose Island's."
"Drinkability: Crazy alcohol, but it's very well-balanced, blended, and mixed in my opinion. I really liked this one, especially as it warmed. If you like bourbon (and I do), this is a beer to try. Otherwise, you might find it a little over the top, especially in the taste department."
"this is extremely sweet and low in the carbonation. im a little worried about the freshness of this particular bottle (its been sitting in a non-conditioned warehouse, probably for a year. one will be enough, thank you! oh, wait. i bought two..."
"Very reminiscent of an overgrown dopplebock. The bourboun plays very well with everything else and doesn't stand out too much. This is one hell of a malt bomb."
"This beer pours very dark with a ver slight brown head, I was hoping for a littl emore head for such a highly acclaimed beer. The initial smell was of whiskey... very strong alcohol and barrel aging smells.. a little too over powering but after a few sips this smell went away and you could smell the barrel aging and beautiful malts. The taste of this beer is wonderful, the barrel aging is perfect with the flavor you can get the taste of it but it does not overshadow the great stout that this all started with, suprisingly enough @ 13% you can not taste the alcohol at all, very well hidden with the beautiful malt flavors and the barrel aging. The mouthfeel is very thick for this beer one of the thickest beers I have ever tasted, feels wonderful in my mouth. I would love to say I could drink this all night but @ 13% this is something I can only have one or two of BUT it is very drinkable, I would be afraid of these catching up to me too fast @ 13% though. Overall an excellent beer and a must try, even @ 22$ a 4 pack"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottled marked ""2007"" into a pint glass, appearance is opaque, jet black, slightly brown at the edges. Thin head of foam, quickly dissipates to a thick ring of sticky caramel-colored lacing that clings to the glass. Aroma is absolutely incredible, huge sweet bourbon punch right off the bat, heavy and malty, grainy undertones. Taste is also incredible, sweet and warm alcohol sugars up front. Malt backbone is enormous, anise and licorice flavors round out this brew. Finish is slightly bitter and leaves a drying effect. Mouthfeel is thick, moderate carbonation, slight roughing on the tongue, washes down smooth and coats the mouth and throat. Drinkability is outstanding, this beer hides its huge abv % and goes down easy, very enjoyable complexity. Overall an exceptional brew, would highly recommend purchasing, will seek out again."
"The flavor is nothing short of brilliant. Bitter dark chocolates pair with massive amounts of Bourbon whiskey. The alchol heat is intense, but not at all unpleasant, delivering some spicy wooden twangs along with vanilla and dark fruit. The mouthfeel is thick and rich, luxurous to the palate with a lasting, boozy bite. All I can say about this beer is ""Wow"". I need to have this again, and soon."
"Overall: Excellent beer. Everything you would and should expect for a beer that looks like used motor oil and smells like you drunk uncle..."
"Overall, a great beer that we don't get out here. Very happy i got to try this one. Highly recommended."
"Two mugs up from the BeerKing!"
"This is my highest scoring beer to date."
"The mind: I am filled with delusions provided by this single beer. It is truly astonishing, but refrains from being overwhelming or cloying. It is big in all the right places rather than sloppy and out of place. Surely a single bottle will due, but it doesn't go down with any degree of difficulty. A truly exciting experience."
"If there's a flavor profile that's fuller, deeper, and more complex, and better blended and crafted, I've yet to find it. Everything a monster stout should be, this one seems to be. Granted, the ABV is outsized, aggressive, and white hot, but if you can bear the buzz the flavor is a rich reward. Light dies here and flavor explodes, and the happiness it brings is a joy to experience and behold."
"Had this at a recent tasting, poured into a tasting pint glass. Pours a black with a little ruby ring and a bit of head not much though. Smell is busting out with a nice roasted malt character with strong coffee, dark chocolate and a bit of sweet alcohol grain. Taste is out of this world it starts off slowly with a hint of sweet malted raison with hints of coffee and dark choclate, the finish is german chocolate cake which is amazing to me. This has to be one of the best stouts that I have ever tasted truly unique and the amazing flavors really add alot to this beer."
"My last bottle of the 08 vintage. The booze has really mellowed out on the nose, and amazingly enough, oxidation hasn't taken over, allowing the blend of smoke, chocolate, bourbon and tootsie roll Come out. Dark fruit - dates and raisins- represent oxidation here. The palate is boozy, chocolate , sweet and yummy. Vanilla, dark caramel, dark chocolate, dried dates and a firming oak tannin character are all present. Excellent, 4.5 across the board."
"Recommended if you like the style..."
"Drinkability: The high alcohol content keeps this from being a beer I could drink many of in one sitting, but would make for an excellent after dinner drink. I wasn't able to confirm the 13% as listed by Wetpaperbag, but the alcohol is definitely up there. Would definitely recommend."
"A very big beer that held up well after 2 years. It gets a high mark for drinkability because of its massive flavor."
"I don't have a lot of experience with this style, but for those who are fans of the style, I would definitely recommend this beer."
"Excellent beer but definitely a sipper."
"A very complex and enjoyable bourbon beer. Make sure it's not served too cold."
"2007 Edition - Pours deep down black , not as thick as motor oil but getting close. Not much carbonation but there is one beautiful 1/16 inch caramel colored head. Heavy lacing. First sniff: Smells like bourbon straight out of the bottle with deep roasted malts aroma overtones. First tastes is thick with a lovely bourbon kick followed by heavy malts, coffee, and chocolate - slight hint of vanilla trying to poke through. This is an awesome treat definitely ""World Class""."
"This is a fantastic beer. Kudos to Goose Island. Try this beer."
"Single 12 ounce of this was obtained in a trade with danielphoran. Big thanks to you for the sample. Pours a completely black coloration, with no heading what so ever. I still appreciate the color quite a bit. Aroma is clearly chocolate dominated, followed by dark fruits, brandy, and a bit of alcohol. It is a very sweet nose, which is perfect for this style. Big on chocolate cake in the flavor, with rum soaked raisins, cherry cordial, and a bit of...more chocolate cake I guess. Body I like because it is slick, but not too heavy. Also, the alcohol is not too in your face, which is again, perfect for this style. One is enough for me in one night, but it is definitely one that can be sipped over the course of an hour or two. This is a lovely stout. It reminds me a bit of Dogfish Head World Wide Stout, except better tasting, and not nearly as much alcohol. One to seek out for sure. Cheers"
"What can you say about a 13% beer with this much bourbon-barrel overtness? This beast is intense, and in your face. A smash-mouth charred malt bomb, exploding with burned sweet smoky flavors."
"I poured this beer into a Kentucky Bourbon Ale snifter. The beer produced a jet black color and dark brown head. The head did not linger however, as the 13% ABV left only a few wisps across the top, and a broken ring around the edge. The aroma is full of dark roasted barley giving off chocolate and coffee flavors, vanilla and hints of coconut from the bourbon are present along with the light presence of the charred oak. Sipping the beer, and the massive amount of darkly roasted barley hits your first and then the bourbon comes in to take care of the rest. The first flavors to pound your tongue are chocolate and coffee and massive sweetness, but the bourbon balances this out with vanilla and enough charred oak to keep the sweetness in check. The beer is a full explosion of flavor, but everything has been put into balance incredibly well. The mouthfeel is as full bodied as they come, with enough carbonation present to bring the beers wonderful flavors to the forefront. A sipping beer for sure, but and idea digestif during colder months."
"let's not kid, this beer will kick your ass. the bourbon is the big show in this beer. if you don't like bourbon, don't try this beer. it's an evening sipper for sure. only rating it what i am as it's impossible to drink more than one of these and they are really better to split with a friend."
"This beer is incredible. Much more complex barrel flavor. Very good vanilla, bourbon and oak in the flavor. This batch is everything this beer needs to be. One of my favorite beers right now."
"'07 Bottle. Pours dark, dark black and oily with a short lived tan head in a snifter. Smell is bourbon, oak, then sweet roasty malt. A fair amount of bourbon in the nose, but not overwhelming. Taste is oily bourbon woodiness, then bittersweet chocolately roast. Balanced well, leaning towards a touch more bourbon than most bourbon beers I've had. Very light alcohol in the flavor for 13%, but a slight bit warming. Rich oily mouthfeel and light, but softly prickling carbonation. This is damn good."
"the flavor may be a bit strong for me to drink more than two of these in a sitting, but at 13%, i can't complain. this is a truly world class beer, and the definition of a 5.0 smell and taste."
"D : I want more. This was a great stout and one of my favorite bourbon ones."
"D- Yes please!"
"Drinkability is amazing for something that is 13% ABV. At the first taste of this beer, I was not a fan because I generally don't like the beers that taste like a hard alcohol. However, this beer is great when the alcohol taste cedes and the many flavors of the malts come to the forefront."
"Huge thanks Dave for the chance to consider this again."
"D- 11%, but a bit to sweet. I am glad I split the bottle with a buddy because I just wouldn't be able to finish one of these, and maybe not even half of it myself."
"D - This one's a sipper and at 13%, one's my limit."
"Thanks to John at Goebel Liquor for selling me this. I want more!!!:)"
"D: This beer has too much booze to be seriously drinkable, though the mouthfeel belies the bourbon dominance. I like this one but the bourbon is just a bit overpowering for my liking (and I'm a big bourbon fan)."
"Pours black for sure into a Michael Jackson snifter. Extra thick and syrupy and no head at all. Mostly just whiskey in nose. Vanilla, oak and a coconut type smell. No mistaking what you are drinking with this one. Instantly warming almost a burn. Whiskey up front and mid-palate. Finish finally brings the stout into play with the roasty flavors. Not at all for people that do not get along with whiskies and the tastes. Full bodied to say the least with a sticky mouthfeel. Drinkability would have me drink just one of these per night."
"Wow! This is just a beast of a beer in every capacity. Huge bourbon? Huge Stout flavors? Huge alcohol? Check! Check! and Check! My only gripe with this beer is that right now, the bourbon overrides some of those wonderful Stout characteristics a little too much. I'm most definitley looking forward to aging a bottle of this for a year and revistiing it again."
"Absolutely OUTSTANDING!! Of all the imperial stout's I've tried, this is the best. Simply dynamite on all levels."
"I can't see how this beer gets the high ratings. Very overrated in my opinion. Try it if you must though."
"Again drinkable would not be the word I would associate with this one, sipping is a must .one of the ultimate desert beers I have had so far. A great night cap and should be enjoyed as such"
"I must admit, however, that I recently tasted a one-year aged 2006 (when it was still 11%ABV) and i found that one to be even more desirable. A good one to roll one up w/ imho =P"
"Pours black, with just the faintest hint of ruby around the edges. Little tiny tan head fades almost completely, but hangs around the edge of the glass. The smell is unreal. Vanilla, spicy oak, alcohol....almost eye-watering. The vanilla bean taste is just massive in this beer. There's some chocolate on the back end of this, too. This is just spicy, vanilla bourbon heaven. Incredible chewy mouthfeel, lingering spiciness on the tongue....it's fair to say I'm losing my mind here. Sometimes I think about giving up on the ""big beers", and drinking pale ales every day. Then I try something like this, and realize how mind-bending some beers can be. This is outstanding!!!"
"Very good beer if you like bourbons, otherwise this is not exactly balanced. It will probably improve with aging."
"Highly recommended."
"After 2 years this beer is ridiculous, alcohol is more apparent but makes it feel more like a bourbon that has been cut with a few drops of water. As a bourbon lover I have to say, this is one of the finest barrel aged beers I have ever had. I look forward to trying more vintages and future releases of this magnificent beer."
"In my top three... definitely."
"Na Sdaroviya!"
"This review took almost an hour in the making, & boy did I try. Quarter ounce sip after half lung whiff, I tried. It made me realize just how insane some of you out there really are. :P"
"D-Could drink 1 or 100."
"Overall, a good beer with serious attitude. If you want a bourbon-booze fest, this is your beer."
"Overall: An excellent beer. This is the standard to which I hold other bourbon barrel-aged stouts."
"Opaque black in color. The nose shows off the bourbon followed by some dark chocolate, coffee and wood. In the mouth it is rich and dense continuing the flavors from the nose, thus the bourbon again shows itself as prominent. Right now the bourbon is a bit strong for my liking but everything else is balanced."
"This beer is way too big for more than one on any occasion. Your tastebuds would retreat into your tongue and your stomach will churn in protest. The one you have will be thoroughly enjoyable if you really take the time to break down the beer, but God help those that try to session this."
"This beer is thick and full bodied and is a great sipper."
"HV"
"D- For the alcohol content this is remarkably drinkable. Not outrageously rich, but makes for a good night cap after a long day."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's thick, but extremely smooth. It doesn't feel heavy at all. Carbonation is light, but it works wonderfully. Despite its 13% abv, its drinkability is phenomenal. I only wish I had more. Perhaps its a good thing I don't. Overall, this is a fantastic beer. I wish I saw it frequently. Unfortunately, I haven't seen it in Ohio at all. Perhaps someday we'll overcome that statutory cap issue."
"Solid brew overall, very glad I got the chance to try this."
"Thanks to Tytoanderso for this amazing beer!! Poured into a chimay goblet. Pitch Dark black color with virtually no head. First smell- bourbon! Nothing else. Then second smell- Vanilla. Next, some chocolate. It keeps changing after every sip!! Taste is so amazing!- Tastes of burnt malts, with some chocolate and coffee hints, but always finished up with a oaky bourbon kick. Still have it in my mouth after 20 minutes! Slick mouthfeel, but really pretty drinkable considering 13%!! Really want more!! Hook me up!"
"Received as an extremely generous extra from northernbrews (thanks again Jeff). Bottled on 10/11/2007. Served in my DFH snifter. Poured obsidian black with zero light penetration. No head to mention, but a thin tan ring around the perimeter of the bowl and some isolated spots of foam in the center. Lacing consisted of a khaki-colored band around the circumference of the glass that was revealed at each sip. Boozy nose, predominantly bourbon and oak with a very sweet backbone. Taste similar to nose; however flavors of vanilla and molasses reveal themselves in the mouth. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and silky without being overly viscous. Some carbonation tingle present across the tongue, but just enough to add a little liveliness to the texture. This is a brew to be savored and sipped and would definitely compliment a fine cigar."
"Cheers."
"D-I could see myself drinking this beer on the coldest night of the year. I have had better 13% stouts in my day, overall I didn't feel like this beer lived up to the hype surrounding it. I tried to let it warm up because I believe a good stout tasted better warm...but alas I did not feel this way about this beer."
"Very thick and syrupy. A really fantastic beer. This would make for a really nice sipper on a cold, winter night."
"Thanks again to Lightindarkness! Excellent trade, BA Bro!"
"Definitely drink this slowly and enjoy it because as good as it is, it's a sipping beer and not for sessions either."
"An all-out assault of your senses. An adventure for those with insatiable beer desires."
"Color is a dark dark dark brown, almost black, with a light brown head. Smells of carmel, bourbon, licorice, coffee, and dark chocolate and the flavor is just what the aroma promises. Not a lot of roasted flavor, but that's OK. Similar to Yeti, Bell's, and Abyss, except it has a bit more of a sweeter flavor than any of those, and lacks the roasted flavor of Abyss. Overall, a great blend of flavors. The taste got better as it warmed up, and while I didn't taste a lot of alcohol, I certainly felt it. It's so thick and intense that I don't know that I'd want more than one at a time, but as stouts go, this is a very fine one."
"M/D - a syrupy brew, but not to a unsavory point, it warms the gullet all the way down, the ABV hides well, a beer that is worth the hype, take that for what its worth, i'm a little partial to big stouts"
"A good sipper, unfortunately I had only one bottle, I now need more."
"as this beer got warmer and warmer, it got much much much better, the chocolate flavor really started to come out, as did its sweet malty character, i must of originally drank it too cold"
"Drinkability: This is a great beer, pure and simple. I cannot think of a better beer to enjoy in the depths of winter than this one. The complexity would be hard to rival. The bourbon flavors are strong and compliment the beer nicely and aren't annoyingly cloying. If the appearance (head,retention,lace) were better this would be near perfection. One would assume that this is hard to accompish with a beer soaked with bourbon. An awesome treat to be savored and cellared, good thing I have 3 more."
"Wow! This is quite the stout. Drink it slow and enjoy this one."
"D- Even though it is delicious, the abv and the gravity will catch up to you. One is about all I can have."
"D: wow, this one is serious, the bourbon aging is obvious, tasty and complex, but strong, would definitely only be having one of these"
"Pours ebony black with some ruby coloured clarity. No head whatsoever. Little bit of lacing around edge of glass. Nose- powerful stuff- dark chocolate, espresso roast and bourbon heat rises up. Taste- thick oily monster. Beautiful roasted malts with big bourbon flavour. All nicely rounded though. Oak and hops show up in full force on the finish along with a wave of boozy heat. The vanilla also helps smooth out this powerhouse. The scary part is that drinkability is through the roof with this beer. I wish I had more..."
"Taste is a real kick in the mouth, very creamy from the beginning, starts out chocolaty and malty then has an aftertaste of coffee and heavy smokiness, makes me feel like I've been smoking, strong warming sensation from the alcohol which off puts me a bit."
"I shared a bottle with a friend one night. We both loved it. I shared some with other friends, and they hated it. This is very complex that might not be for everyone, but I think it is a great beer. In my opinion, this is superlitive."
"This black bitch pours super super viscous. Looks like used motor oil glug gluging and forming an eddy in the glass. Sickly putrid black. impenetrable when held up to blistering sun. I love it! The nose reeks of bourbon and wood with some alcohol in it as well. Taste is balls out malty with strong bourbon and oak. Roasted toasted oak and vanilla. Some blackness that is unexplainable rises out of this muk. Some sort of caramello or Rolo type of aftertaste while the alcoholic heat travels down the esophagus. Hop bitterness takes a back seat here, this one is all about the black sick disturbed malts. Mouthfeel is super thick and chewy which I love in an impy stout. Drinkability is good, but lacking a bit at the moment as this 2007 vintage is still a bit hot. I think these marks will go up in a year or so. Overall this is a very impressive brew. This is not your neo-hippie's wimpy oatmeal shit, this brew is fierce! An excellent concoction from Goose Island Beer Co. And an excellent trade with TheBlackMallard, thanks again Craig!"
"I loved it. Very well done GI."
"D: I wish I had serval of these to celler. The bottle sampled was young and would improve with aging. However, this brew was ready to drink. It was balanced but lacked the strong coffee presence I expected. The bourbon nicely complemented the chocolate."
"D: Bourbon County Stout might be the best beer I've had so far. I keep telling myself to sit back and savor this but the massive flavors make me keep sipping."
"D: An incredibly tasty barrel-aged RIS, this really is world class. It makes a great nightcap & the 13% ABV sneaks up on you but it's well hidden. Big, sweet & full of awesome oak & bourbon. I'd take this over a single malt scotch any day. Be careful though, and if you don't like smoke & bourbon, don't drink this one. Leave it for me."
"D- Haha! Even splitting a 12oz bottle, this one took a while. Both the body and the intensity of flavor don't allow for easy drinking. This one's a sipper that's intended to be savored."
"Truly an experience in a bottle."
"Notes - Exceptional stuff; one of the better bourbon barrel beers I've had."
"A masterpiece."
"Drinkability: This is a lovely huge, complex stout and it's best suited for sipping over a long period of time."
"This beer does not lie when it tells you ""One sip has more flavor than your average case of beer."" My initial taste was of shock and distaste. However, the aftertaste is smooth and very nice. It pours a very dark color, which allows for no light to pass through. There is little to no head, and I potent smell, indicating this is not going to be a light beer. The initial taste is overpowering, and I can't quite put my finger on what it is. It has a nice smooth mouthfeel to it though, and the aftertaste is nice and sweet. I might put one of these away and let it age longer, as it's only a 2007 batch."
"2007 bottle"
"It is in every way phenominal."
"Overall, a nice Impy Stout that could easily stand some age, but is ready to sip and contemplate now."
"well worth the premium price and highly recommended."
"D- not necessarily gonna drink a ton in one sitting, but i would wanna drink these alot"
"Drinkability is moderate at 11%, you can definitely feel the alcohol but it is not overwhelming, great mix of malts, dark fruits, hops, the bourbon barrel accents are a great accent that does not hijack the flavor profile, this is deserving of high ratings and I would love to try try again after a few years of cellaring, yum!"
"This beer really is one-of-a-kind. I'm not much of a bourbon guy, so I won't be seeking it out again, but I can definitely respect this beer and I am quite glad I got the chance to try it."
"This one is very full bodied. Thick, smooth, and extremely enjoyable at this point in time. I am looking forward to seeing how my remaining bottles continue to age...that is if I can leave them in the cellar and not drink them."
"D:Definitely a sipper. The first few sips you feel like you are enjoying a glass of bourbon. Really weird. It actually became more drinkable as it warmed up. This is an amazing beer."
"D: Tasting the various vintages recently, I can appreciate the various stages this beer goes through.  This one really shines with the taste and mouthfeel and is only a step or two off in the appearance and smell when compared with a younger vintage. (4.5)"
"I poured this violently into a Duvel tulip to get all the head I could out of it. Ended up a couple fingers from the top. Black dense body with brown bubbly head that sticks around for a while and lasted to the end. Smell was a smack in the face of coffee, chocolate and rasted malts. Flavor is a strong chocolate-vanilla with just enough bitterness. Very smooth mouthfeel for the viscosity of the brew. So drinkable for such a high alcohol and thickness beer. Need More!"
"Edit - Having an '08 on 2/13/10, the flavour is just nuts. Huge whiskey/vanilla, dark roasted malts with an elegant alcoholic, but not boozy mouthfeel. Editing taste from a 4.5 to a 5. What is it with me and early February and BCS?"
"Overall: Decent strong stout, but lacks a certain depth of flavour. On the sweet side, and at 13% ABV this is definitely one to sip."
"drinkability is good. really tasty and drinkable. like having dessert. excellent beer. thanks again eric!"
"Worth the wait every year."
"Pulled a trade last week for some more of these and glad i did. this is the ultimate for cold night sipping or special occassions"
"Super smooth and a little sticky. Full bodied, thick and hearty. A real sipper with great drinkability for such a big beer. Definitely a beer to sip slowly, savor, and enjoy. Perfect nightcap on a cold evening."
"My one complaint with this beer is the lack of a head. Other than that, it was great. Even at $20 for a 4-pack I would recommend picking this one up."
"D - a great beer by GI and one that I would pick up again for sure despite the 20 bucks a 4 pack price tag. A beer to be savored and to make sure that you drink it slow and have the time to appreciate it because if not it will be a waste."
"The beer is a keeper. Label on this 2007 says the flavor will continue to develop over five years. Not sure I will keep that long but will let them age for some time. This is neither a session beer nor one to be imbibed, pounded or whatever terms are used for dispensing quickly. A good beer to be enjoyed leisurely and at $5 a pop you should savor. Think about a good bottle of wine only costing $10 and then the cost seems very reasonable. Good job Goose Island!"
"D - This is THE bourbon aged stout and should be experienced by all. Good night!"
"What a treat this one is. It is a definite sipper and I don't know that I could drink more than one but I don't know that I would want to either. One is plenty with the ABV in this. Got another bottle left and I'm going to age it for a while and note the differences. Awesome beer here..."
"Fantastic beer here."
"D- I like this beer. I am not sure it is my top 10 stouts but it is decent overall. I would be interested to try more beers from this brewery. Holding on to my other bottle for a few years to see how it ages. I imagine it will be much more interesting."
"d: This is as close to perfection as I've ever found in a beer. I forget who I got this from via trade, but thanks anyway."
"Notes: Again this is a serious sipping beer. With that in mind though, this beer is wonderfully complex. Mine was born on 10/11/07 and I am drinking it on 1/16/08. I must admit sweet stouts are not really my style but the body of this beer is amazing, the flavors are intriguing and overall this is a damn good beer."
"D:AWESOME!!!! This might be the best beer I have ever had in my life. Every single sip leaves me wanting more."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Chimay chalice. Pour is jet black, as in I've never seen a beer this black. It lets no light through no matter what angle you hold the glass at. The aggressive pour left little head that disappeared quickly, but left nice little rings around the glass after every sip. This beer is making me interested already. Aroma is a myriad of smells. Definite whiffs of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, toffee and roasted almonds. But there are also dark fruits, raisins and figs finishing with a flash of booze. Really complex...still holding my attention. Taste is what espresso smells like, not like it actually tastes. Definitely vanilla, dark chocolate and roasted almonds. The one thing it reminds me of heavily is of a waffle cone, the kind you get at Baskin Robbins. You take that waffle cone and douse it in dark chocolate and vanilla and drizzle some Makers Mark on top of it, well there ya go. Mouthfeel is full bodied with light carbonation. The oily nature of the beer sticks with you making it linger in you mouth. The only points I can take off is the fact I could only drink about 1 a week. Way to rich to make it into my normal rotation."
"Final Note: I like Bourbon (Makers Mark) and I like this Stout. I'm laying 1 down for a few months, or at least until I see the first robin of Spring!"
"I was happy to get a 4 pack of this on a recent trip to Chicago to drink with my wife and ssiter-in-law. This was our end of the evening beer, but it still nearly took our heads off! Huge, big beer-maybe the most intense beer of any kind that I have ever had. It makes the KBS taste like an iced coffee. Pours big, utterly black, and incredibly viscous with little head. Wow. The aromas are incredible! Starts with a big hit of Bourbon folowed immediately by licorice pastilles, then fades a bit to developfurther aromas of coconu, oak, vanilla, a finer Bourbon purity, dark fruit, and a ton of chocolate. After it breathes for a while it becomes even more licoricy. Taste is equally as incredible. Very powerful, but also amazingly integrated. Licorice up front, then vanilla, chocolate,and a long Bourbon finish. Huge and delicious. Mouthfeel is huge and very smooth and creamy. Very much a sipper,but so, so impressive. It's worth the money."
"Cheers!!"
"The abv is too high for drinkability to be too high, and this must be sipped as it is strong and powerful. A beer to nurse that gets better as it warms. I have a couple older bottlings from 06 that i am now anxious to try and see how they age... and a few more of these i am laying down to age for a year as well."
"Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout pours a dense jet black. The smell is exceptionally strong of bourbon and malt. It smells so good I would be pleanty happy just sitting and smelling it all night. There was absolutely no let down on the taste as it proved to have a bold bourbon flavor. Mouthfeel as best I can explain was like a melted butter, chocolate, and bourbon culminated together. A fantastic drink that took a long time and was enjoyable the whole way though."
"I'm old fashioned, and the lack of a head is a minus for me even at this abv. Nice black color, though. Smell is overwhelmingly bourbon, taste is bourbon up front with bitterness in the finish. Further sips expose chocolate and coffee. Mouthfeel is round and satisfying. Very drinkable for this strength. One of my favorite strong stouts."
"Outstanding choice for this style. I am aging a 2006 that I can only hope brings me a step closer to beergasim."
"Rich, gut-punchingly strong and flavorful, and super bourbon-ed."
"Thanks again, Derek, for another wonderful drop!"
"D - I felt like the smoke was much more present in the younger bottle of Bourbon County Stout, than in the aged bottles, but over all this beer gets much better aged. Just too intense for me at this point though."
"This beer is a black hole, sucking in all light then laughing in its face. A somewhat hard pour yields a respectable head, that holds of for most of the sampling. Smells very chocolatey and roasty. Taste is more of the same, with a secondary vanilla flavor, especially as the brew warms. Mouthfeel is very thick. I could drink this all night, every night. Hopefully I will be able to hold off drinking the other 3 bottles so they can be aged. Assuming I can find it each year, this will make a great annual present to myself. Highly recommended."
"Overall this beer is excellent. I don't remember what it cost, but I'd gladly pay $4 to $5 a bottle for this beer, and would recommend it to anyone after an interesting beer willing to try a stout. I would not recommend it to those who have to drive."
"I pop the cap and a whiff of mystery just hits my nose, and the bottle is a foot from my face. Pours pitch black with just a very small amount of tan head on the top. Nose hints of vanilla. A nice little tease for the senses really. Flavor is thick and complex. Vanilla, thick malts, and a load of body just come together. Thick liquid feel and a low carbonation still feel nice. Drinkable? This is more an interesting sipper. Something to ponder, and probably something that could use a few more years to mellow and chill."
"If anyone can drink more than one of these in a week, let alone a night, more power to them! This is WAY too strong for me but if you dream of Kentucky in the spring and enjoy women in big hats and dresses on race day, well sir, this Goose is for you."
"But if you are truly a stout afficianado and don't try this beer, at any price, then you are really missing out on one heck of an experience."
"If you like warming, this is the beer for you because this one warms all the way to the stomach. It's not for me though."
"Drinkability: Very good! The first sip was a joy, as was the last."
"Easily the smoothest, tastiest ~13% beer I've ever had. Yes, it's a bit thick, but no more so than weaker double or imperial stouts. The aroma is rich with the bourbon which once on the palate, doesn't dominate, but compliments the strong, dark chocolate ad espresso flavors. Throw in a dash of oak and vanilla and you've got a hell of a beer. More please."
"Overall, this is a chewy, unbelievably full beer. Each sip is a mouthful. Very desserty, and as such not an easy drinker. Consider splitting a bottle with a friend unless you're up to the challenge."
"This is a heavy beer, one of the heaviest around. There is no carbonation, just a thick, syrupy assault of flavors. I'd say it's too heavy for casual drinking, but with a taste like this, it isn't far off from easily drinkable."
"I had this last year and was some what disappointed. I had a hard time finishing the bottle. I thought I'd give it another chance. Don't know if they did something different, but this years batch blew me away. The bourbon was not as overpowering as I remember. I'm not a bourbon fan, but this made for 1 great after dinner sipping beer. I found it to be well balanced with a strong hints of vanilla and coffee."
"Ben Mollin went for this one. It is the blackest beer I've ever seen - completely opaque and yet not thick; it does pour out of the glass remarkably enough. The aroma is divine: you can smell the bourbon fragrance rising from the surface, along with molasses and treacle. After that, the taste is almost an anti-climax. It is very drinkable though and can slip down with deceptive ease. I can see it being a polemical beer: not everyone will like it; Dulcie hated it."
"One of the most complex, well-balanced and richly rewarding sippers of a stout I've ever had. Very highly recommended! Thank you again, Goose Island. You guys rock."
"The body is full with no surprise. There is a sticky feel and finishes with a sweetness. There are a lot of things going on here that the complexity is just a little much but with age I could see this shaping into a fantastic beer. A beer that takes a while for sure. I would love to taste this after a year though."
"Overall- Excellent night cap. I would prefer this to real Bourbon!"
"Now this is a beer. Thick as crude and just as black. Minimal head of chocolatey brown. Just a hunk of good drinking. The nose just reaks of roasted malty chocolate. Nice bourbonesque undertones. Smells kind of like barbecue from the blackened graininess. The nose is just saturated with richness. As I raise the glass to my lips alcohol stingers whip my oropharynx. The taste is of most delicious chocolate and boozey fumes. Definite dark fruitiness. This thing is just ripe with flavour. It would probably light on fire. It has a nice bitterness that is completely an afterthought and is almost lost in the cascade of flavour. Just utterly delicious and such a pleasure to consume. This one makes me feel classy as I drink it and the power of it casts a pleasant warmth over my being. The mouthfeel is thick and oily. Very substantial and heavy bodied. I'd love to see the nutrition facts for this sucker. The drinkability is great considering what I have here. The flavour definitely rewards me for taking it slow and experiencing the subtleties as the temperature warms. This is a great beer. Worth the price of admission with all things considered. This is what Midwest winter drinking is all about. Nice work! Chicago!"
"Bottle. Poured a thick black color with a light brown head. Terrific strong aroma of malt and bourbon. Mouthfeel is tremendous. Flavor is a nice blend of chocolate, malt, vanilla, wood, and bourbon. This is a very solid beer, maybe even worth the $18 a four-pack."
"Big thanks to Matt Stoutness Crill"
"D: This may be one of the freshest, tastiest most wonderful beer I've ever had the pleasure of sipping. The abv says 11 but you could have fooled me. This is a HUGE beer and really incredibly drinkable beside a fire with a 100 dollar wheel of cheese or otherwise."
"Well balanced and a nice bourbon stout. Even with the stong bourbon and oak characters there are no harsh elements here. It needs a few years to round out, but a delicious brew."
"Overall, I'm struggling with this beer. I expected so much more. Perhaps some time in the cellar will help mellow this beast out a bit..."
"Overall, I love this brew. Its not as great as the FKBS however its still an amazing brew. Its a little pricey but I wouldnt mind paying a little more for a BA brew dispite what others might say. ;-)"
"Carbonation is still on the mild side though it hasn't lost any. Alcohol has died a bit in the nose as has the vanilla. Vanilla has settled a bit in the taste as well but is still present. More oaky flavors have come through as well as some sugary dark fruits(candied plums?). The alcohol is still nearly as potent as ever. With this brew being over 2 years old and still kickin', I'd bet it could last years more. Thanks again, Mikesgroove for this great brew and for cellaring it quite nicely."
"Overall this is a very good beer and one I am glad to have a couple more to age longer and see how it changes in another year."
"d - wonderful sipper and goes down easily. this is probably the best beer i've ever had."
"Overall: This beer is neck and neck with KY Stout as the best in the world. I prefer KY stout slightly due to it's more relaxed Bourbon characteristics. But let me tell you if you love Bourbon this is no doubt about it the greatest beer known to man. I can't wait to try the 2007 batch and see how it matches up. My Bourbon swilling beer hating buddy actually enjoyed the KY Stout. I can't wait to throw this one on him."
"Drinkability: Mmm, very intense, yest so smooth and complex. Excellent. It's lost a bit of flavor since last year, but the aroma has improved. Interesting. I look forward to sampling the other two I have stashed in the basement in the next two years."
"Good sipping beer. A nice slow drain while reading. Or...you can gulp."
"Highly recommended, best beer I have from Goose Island, and one of the best bourbon beers/double stouts on the market, surprised this is not higher on the best beer list, grab some of the 2007 that just came out while you can"
"Poured pitch black. No head. Minimal lacing lingers around the sides of my Goose Island reserve glass. What a tuff looking barrel aged brew. The first initial smell is bourbon. Followed by dark chocolate, black coffee, sweet malts, and a hint of smoke. Tastes like it smells but more powerful. Rich bourbon, mix of dark and milk chocolates, coconut, burnt toast, sweet malt, vanilla, oak, smokey campfire and tons of warming booze. Very complex, a lot going on in flavor. Mouth feel is thick, but creamy and some stickiness as well. Some carbonation, but not much. Overall drinkability is exceptional. Deliciously bold and extreme. A real sipper, perfect for cold Chicagoland winter nights. Truly Outstanding. A must try for all you barrel aged fans. Cheers!"
"Strong smell of bourbon. Taste had a strong bourbon kick followed with a mild chocolate finish. Definitely one of the most complex, fullest beers to ever hit my palate. As a person who enjoys a glass of Jim Beam or Knob Creek on occasion, I will certainly try this beer again. If one wants a beer to pour and enjoy on a snowy winter day, this is it."
"Next one is waiting for a cigar and I'll be ready."
"This beer is excellent, but be warned: its richness makes it a challenge to consume. Are you prepared?"
"Big thanks to Phil7568 for the chance to try this!"
"I am not a huge fan of bourbon-y beers (yet I love bourbon), but this one appealed to me. Its flavor is bourbon-y but also smokey and roasty and definitely complicated. Mouthfeel was about right...what I expected from this. The beer was viscous, but not over-the-top the way I found Sam Adams Triple Bock to be. I have a friend who's a huge fan of beer, and while I find hoppy and sour to be more appealing beer flavors, I can certainly understand the appeal of this beer."
"Poured into a snifter. Pours a dark brown, almost opaque. A significant head that was espresso colored. The aroma is slightly coffee, mostly malt and a hint of bourbon. The taste was similar to the smell but I got more bourbon. The body was big. It's a smooth beer that I could only have one of."
"Pours a very dark black with a small tan head. Thin lacing quickly dissipates. I smell coffee and bourbon. Very thick, creamy mouthfeel. Strong alcohol taste at the finish. Bourbon and chocolate flavors linger throughout. Cask aging adds to the cost, but definitely makes this a unique brew. This is a real stout. Highly recommended."
"Pours opaque black with very minimal chocolate milk head that only shows cause of an extremely aggressive pour. Mild in the nose, chocolate, oak, a little bourbon. Taste is as it smells with a little smokey flavor and a little more bourbon but not boozey. Full in the mouth and only to be sipped slowly."
"Pours an opaque black color with a slim dark brown colored head that virtually disappears. Smell is of a toasted malt with some dark chocolate. Taste is somewhat woody, and smoky with some definite bourbon flavor. No alcohol taste on this one and the mouthfeeling is lively, and syrupy."
"It's a sipper and a damn fine beer."
"This is by far the best bourbon beer I have ever had, a wonderful complex brew that I will order/buy again."
"This was my first experience with a bourbon stout, and definitely not my last. I have to thank Quaffer for giving me one out of his personal stash. Thanks bro! Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. The beer poured an opaque black, with no head. The aroma was an intensely strong bourbon along with a slight hint of chocolate. Complex, but hard to define due to the high alcohol aroma. The taste is extremely complex. The taste starts off with the strong flavor of bourbon, and then gives way to a smooth chocolate flavor accompanied by hints of vanilla and wood. Highly complex. The mouthfeel is just like a stout should be, very thick and smooth. This is what I consider to be a sipping beer, and not exactly a sessionable ale. The high abv. keeps this from being sessionable. Overall, I have to say I was really impressed. Very unique flavor. I wish we got this in Texas, but that makes it even more special when I can get it. Thanks again Quaffer!"
"Really smooth despite the slight booziness. Great carbonation and full body."
"Overall: I loved it. I would definately try it again inspite of the high price."
"I would buy a case if I could get my hands on one!"
"Drinks great for the abv, but more than 2 & I think I'd need a nap. One of the better double stouts out there IMO"
"Overall, not a bad beer, not an excellent beer either. The label had this long drawn out retort saying this was a ""special"" beer and it was considered a ""cigar beer"". It seemed Goose Island was trying to replace a bourbon or scotch with this for the cigar smokers in the bar. Not sure if that would work."
"Very good bourbon stout. This version was much more balanced than when I had it on draft this winter. The aging improved it greatly. I will definately seek this out again."
"Pours a jet black with a dark brown colored head of two fingers that quickly dies down to a thin lacing. Stickiness is hardly there, but shows up a bit here and there. Smell is of big sweet molasses with some swet caramel notes. I sense a bit of kahlua in the nose as well, yummy. Taste is rich! Starts of with the sweet molasses mixed with a gooey chocolate brownie. Bourbon taste definitely comes through midway and warms as it goes down. The taste gets more and more complex as it warms. More of a dark chocolate flavor emerges with hints of espresso. Mouthfeel is full bodied with minimal carbonation. Silky smooth, wow. I'll definitely look for this one again. Pick it up, trade for it, give up one of your kidneys for it...do what you have to, pick it up."
"This beer is a great example of what I call ""purposeful excess."" Anyone can overload a batch of beer with malt or hops, but the challenge is to make it a great beer in the process, and Goose Island has succeeded with this one. There are red highlights as you pour it, but it sits instensely black in the glass, with a thin, mocha-colored head. The aroma is all bourbon. The flavor is amazing, coffee-and-chocolate-noted malt intensity with loads of bourbony earthiness. Unlike many bourbon barrel-aged beers, the liquor flavors don't come through in any way as brandy -- it's much more of a true bourbon flavor. The malty whallop is great, and yet there's a back-taste that's almost reminiscent of port wine. The mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth, but aromatic  yes, like bourbon. So, so satisfying. But here's the nit -- twelve ounces is too much, and it's hard for me to find someone to share this with. The second six ounces aren't quite as enjoyable as the first six. If Goose Island would put this in a smaller bottle, I'd buy it a lot more."
"Oak laced chocolate flavors hit the taste buds like a wave. Chocolate flavors give way to vanilla bean notes that give a subtle smoothness to the overall flavor. Licorice notes blend well with a touch of dark fruits, which contribute to a nice sweetness that comes through in the aftertaste. Thick and juicy mouthfeel comes through pretty hard with a hotness. Bourbon booze is hefty but not over abundant. A nice brew this one is with a ton of flavor and excellent smooth mouthfeel. One to sip and enjoy if you get the chance. I bet this also cellars well."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tannish head, oil slicks and minimal sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is sweet/roasted/malts, slight alcohol, nice bourbon/oak note, toffee/chocolate/coffee. The taste is absolutely delicious, slightly sweet, roasted malts, vanilla, nice oaky taste, tons of toffee/chocolate/coffee, a slight dry finish. Alcohol gives a great warming feeling. Medium body, a very nice smooth/silky brew, ABV hidden very well. Very drinkable, an awesome ADS from GI, highly recommended."
"first thoughts man this had better be worth the money not an easy beer to get hands on also not a inexpencive beer at leat around here all that aside. . . . WOW is about all i need to sum up this beer looks black no other colors suround it its just black. from the time the bottle is cracked to well after the time its all gone all one could smell in the house was burbon and malt and a little bit more burbon tasty tasty stuff mmm.... burbon and beer my 2 favorite adult beverages all in one wonderfully delicious burbony chockatly coffeey almost chew beverage makes me want to drink the rest of them all richt now just thinking about it but i know that that would leave me very disapointed a very good beer"
"It is kind of scary how drinkable this is."
"Thick and full bodied. The first one goes down very slowly. The second has more noticable flavor and is a bit smoother. Overall a wonderfully brewed beer that I would be happy to have on any occasion."
"This one is a champion of big beers. Theres a lot going on here; perhaps too much"
"Mouthfeel is crisp and moderately carbonated with a nice full, chewy, creamy, body. Nice alcohol warmth."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thin brown head that fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has an incredibly warm black malt and bourban whiskey scent that is quite potent. It boasts of burnt caramel and toffee. The taste is great. It has a very smooth imperial stout flavor with a nice bourban flavor in the finish. It's rich and powerful with loads of flavor. It reminds me of an oaked porter I once made. The wood taste really comes through. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very impressive beer with lots of character. It's loaded with malts and topped off with a solid bourban taste that really compliments the malt bill. This is a good drinker."
"The mouth is both sweetly and stinging at times, the alcohol not shy at all, the body thick and syrupy. Its a body that states its not fucking around, so pay attention. I can see Lord Sauron sipping on this bad boy, in between tortures, maimings, and general badassedness."
"This beer is heaven.  There is no better beer and I'm adjusting the score to reflect this.  This IS the perfect beer.  I just can't do it justice.  Sugars meet vanilla meat caramel meet bourbon.   Chocolate malt mixed with cigar notes are in the back end.  This is just I wanted to add some value but damn this is amazing!"
"I am glad I have a couple more of these that I can sit on for a while. Excellent stout, well done Goose Island!"
"Fantastic beer. This is a great beer to enjoy after a larger meal or with a roasted lamb. This one would only be more drinkable if the alcohol was lower. Worth getting your hands for any fair price."
"Served at cellar temperature in a pint glass, from a 12 oz. bottle. Poured a spent motor oil black in which no light could pass through. About a half inch of dark mocha brown head formed, and faded into a tan ring of lace in the glass. Smell: aromas of smooth dark chocolate, oak, coffee, and bourbon filled my nose. Some alcohol also present. Taste: Lots of bitter roasted coffee, sweet chocolate, notes of smokey oak, vanilla extract and strong whiskey flavors. Very little carbonation. Strong presence of alcohol that isn't overwhelming. Smooth throughout with a warm finish. Thick and rich in the mouth. Did I mention smooth? Very well balanced and very well crafted. Very drinkable and very enjoyable."
"$5 a piece...ridiculous. There are better bourbon barrel stouts for 1/4 to 1/5 that cost coming out of shacks in the northern woods."
"D - Overall this is probably the strongest tasting, in the sense of the upfront alcohol taste, I have had in a stout. I felt it was almost overdone a tad and could have been played back a bit. A definate sipper and probably could use to sit down in the cellar for a while. I would be intrested in trying some older years."
"This stuff is just great, might be the best bourbon barrel stout if not a close second to Parabola"
"The drinkability is very good for a barrel-aged beer that has this much alcohol. An exceptional beer."
"D - Outstanding beer. The range of flavors was awesome."
"Thanks to ThomasHardy for the trade. The beer poured a very opaque black with a decent brown head that slowly diminished and left spotty lacing on the glass. The aroma was one of the strongest I've ever encountered. I poured the beer from the bottle into a Stone Imperial Russian Stout snifter and set it on the kitchen counter. I could smell the beer from there while still standing upright. The aroma was dominated by roasted barley but quickly followed by roasted coffee, bitter coffee and plenty of oak. The beer tasted strongly of rich espresso with a decent bitter cocoa flavor and a noticeable presence of Bourbon. The alcohol was somewhat well hidden and the beer set a slightly heavy-medium on the palate. This is def finitely a sipper, but a very enjoyable one nonetheless."
"Drinkability - This is most excellent ale !! It is very rich and rewarding to both smell and taste, and beautiful as well. The high abv is obviously limiting to sessionability, and so is the ale's richness. This is one to sip and savor, quite possibly with dessert and/or after."
"D: I still can't seem to find that 11% ABV anywhere. I think they're making that up. Way to go Greg for not overdoing the bourbon aging. One of the best stouts I've had in a while."
"Thanks to BA's sman262 & zrrbrrt for sending bottles in trade."
"Thick mouthfeel helps sweeten the beer. Carbonation is mild. Taste is well balanced, but the aroma was severely lacking."
"D- This is a very good beer. You can not drink this fast at all and is a big sipper. I think how strong they got the chocolate flavors is just great. Now excuse me while I go sit outside and sip this on one of the last colder nights. Also I wish I could give this a 4.75 but I can't. I don't feel it is a 5 though so just a note. Actually on everything I wish I could give it a 4.75."
"The carbonation is just barely there, but enough to give the body a viscous oily feel that I quite like. Wow is this good. If you love stouts this is definitely one to somehow get ahold of."
"Taste smacks of a vanilla/chocolate swirl, oak binds them together. I think there is some caramel and raisin in it as well. Alcohol starts to burn, but quickly fades. A bit syrupy, so the drinkability was lowered. A really good Double Stout seeing as I don't like bourbon."
"Drinkability - I tried one of these fresh and while I thought it tasty, it didn't set off bells the way this one did. An outstanding beer, I immediately went out and grabbed another 4-pack."
"April"
"D: This year's edition is still very young. It needs some aging to balance everything out. A nice brew that will no doubt get better with time."
"Wow. This is not ""drinkable"" by the everyday definition, but for what it is--a beer meant to be slowly savored--it is incredible. Not only a total dessert beer, but almost a meal in itself. As big as it is, it's also well-balanced. I can't imagine lovers of big stouts not going apeshit over this one. Delightful. Hail."
"Unbelievably gooey and tasty, I feel sorry for those that have not had the opportunity to try this."
"There is no hiding the 11% ABV in this experience. It's definitely a sipper. A recommended remody after snowblowing the driveway."
"Drinkability: Drinks more like a liqueur than a beer. It certainly warms the body on a cold winters evening and would be a great accompaniment to a cigar."
"With a vigorous pour you get a result that is pure visual perfection. Jet black body with slight carbonation bubbles clinging to the side. Hosts a deep chocolate brown head that fades a little to quick. Nose is amazingly sweet and port like. It includes notes of real vanilla, anise and toffee. As I take the first sip let me just say: wow! This beer is huge. Amazing collection of flavors dance together on the mouth such as raisan, burnt malt, anise, cough syrup, and hints of silky chocolate on the end. A massive belly warmer. Bring of the cold nights."
"Cheers"
"Very good brew overall. I do wish that the oak/vanilla flavors were a bit more evident. I would love to age a couple of these for a year of two to see how the flavor develops. The alcohol is still a little harsh, but it's great nonetheless."
"Not much to say except this is one of the best stouts I've had. Wish it was distributed a bit more widely. Next year, I will make a point of getting to Chicago when it is ""in season""."
"Big thanks to weefishheads for this treat."
"RERERERATE: At one year out, I'd consider selling myself into white slavery for another bottle of this god among beers. Year-old '06 Bourbon County makes other stouts totally undrinkable."
"Drinkability: The ABV is hard to find in the mouth, although it does exist pretty assertively in the nose. Extremely drinkable, extremely flavorable, excellent stout."
"This is like drinking a chocolate cake, a true dessert beer. Very complex flavors. Expensive, but worth every penny."
"Thanks nflmvp for the first 'meal in a glass' I've ever tried."
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a skim of dark brown bubbles above the opaque dark brown/black brew. Bubbles mostly head for the rim, with fleeting lace. Aroma is heavy dark grain sweetness, with alcohol noticeable. Taste is super rich chocolatey sweetness, with a tinge of dark fruits in the middle, and partially submerged alcohol in the close and aftertaste, which warms the soul. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, yet chewy, and drinkability is slow, but everything makes you want to come back for more when you can. A decadent pleasure."
"D: Wow. This was so friggin' good."
"D: The 11% abv is a whopper, but the buttery sweet bourbon flavors are wonderful. This is an excellent night cap."
"I'm generally more of a hop-head but always appreciate a masterly-crafted beer. This is a masterpiece to the kind of Van Halen 1."
"I could sip this bastard all night. Not as harsh and bitter as Rogue, nicely sweet and challenging to drink and appreciate. If you haven't had it yet, get it!"
"Thanks to JPM30 and NFLMVP for a small stash of this great brew.MK"
"2006 bottling. Many thanks to czoch75 for sending me a sample. Served at cellar temperature. Pours extremely viscously into a 17-ounce snifter, with only a thin wisp of burnt ochre foam that quickly disperses to a miniscule ring on top of a ponderous, tar-like body that is as black ""as the night itself, Mayor."" The nose is outright decadent, with boozy vanilla, toffee, chocolate, and rum-soaked raisin aromas. An almost medicinal dark berry essence wafts up as well, with slight coffee notes emerging here and there. Extremely complex bouquet, to say the least. And the taste exhibits at least as much complexity, if not more. But first, there is the mouthfeel: it is a velvety, chewy, expansive, creamy oil-slick, with a beguilingly syrupy quality that causes the beer to roll around the entire palate, almost to the point where it threatens to escape in order to coat the lips. Amazing. The taste, now: dark chocolate bitterness, with liquified cacao nibs melds with black bourbon-infused cherries coated with the thinnest of toffee-mocha candy shells. A sharp, alcohol nip at the finish, along with some vanilla coffee roast flavor. Mild to medium oaky tannins throughout, with a lingering woody pucker that remains alongside some chewy date booziness in the aftertaste. This is a stellar sipping experience as of right now, one that begs to be drawn out for as long as possible. However, I imagine some careful cellaring would do wonders for this gargantuan stout, inching it ever nearer to perfection. A monumental achievement in brewing."
"The alcohol was a little more dominant than I care for, or which is why I did not rate as high as say, the Great Divide Yeti. However, this was a most enjoyable beer on a winters night."
"Full thick body, moderate carbonation. Smooth & velvety...coats all the way down...and stays awhile. Balance is good. Everything melds together very well. Alcohol warming is evident. Certainly not a session beer at 11%, but certainly more than good enough to have again."
"D: It would be impossible to have more than one of these in one sitting, but who cares. Theres more going on in a bottle than most other cases"
"I want to thank NucularGeorge for this tasty treat... Not a huge stout fan, but this one impressesd me."
"old score: 4.5, 4.5, 5, 5, 4.5"
"D: It's crazy that this beer can be considered so drinkable. If you were to judge this by nose alone you would think that it would taste like pure bourbon. When you finally taste it it's so balanced and nuanced it's scary."
"Real hard to be objective about this beer it is just REALLY damn good. If you dislike thick beers and the taste of Bourbon you will absolutely HATE this beer. I myself LOVE this stuff."
"Overall this was a great beer, but I will let this one age a bit before bringing it out again, expecially since it's 5 dollars a bottle."
"Many thanks to buckeyenation for just giving this to me. I didnt realize at the time just how generous of a gesture it was! My apologies when you finished your 3rd, and pined for the 4th."
"This is definately a sipper of a beer. Tons of complex flavors, hot alcohol, and a huge body. One has to sip this to fully enjoy it. It only takes a sip to get so much from this one. I definately want more but tonight this is probably all I can take with how heavy it sits."
"Drinkability was almost a ""5" until I got to the end and realized I was nowhere near as sober as when I'd started. Still, for the incredible way this warms while simultaneously covering the alcohol this is crazy quaffable."
"Overall: Maybe I'm just not ready for a double stout. I thought I was ready for any beer. At least I know I haven't come to a plateau with beer."
"A Bourbon Barrel Aged Thanks to BigHuge for this super treat!!!"
"From a 12 oz bottle with a bottled on date of 081605. Poured in to a Duvel glass. Pours used motor oil black, and almost as thick. Very pretty brown head formed, but faded quickly. Bourbon, oak, vanilla are all present as advertised. I get some dark cherry notes. Man this beer is gonna kick my ass. This beer has tons of body for as much alcohol thats in it. Each drink comes with the burn of a shot of bourbon. Im guessing that it is still pretty green, so in six month or a year. Im going to be a very happy man."
"Well done Goose Island!!"
"Worth the price."
"This is a magnificent beer with as much complexity as any wine or fine boutique bourbon."
"drinkability: tis a sipper"
"This is a very well-done beer, certainly the best of its class I have tried."
"Originally had straight from the cask, at the brewery this summer. Purchased this four pack of 12 oz bottles at Sam's. Poured into a nonic, a tan brown head developed and lingers a centimeter thick on surface of the body. I assume that my pour was at fault for that. The body is a dark coffee black brown color. Smells of intense sweet licorice, and raisons. The taste is very rich and sweet, not milky thick, but definitely substantial. Lots of sweet malts licorice not so much bourbon, like I'd hoped, but some seriousness all the same (its very strong). This is a very interesting beer, its more of a special occasion beer. I would not drink more than one in a session. It is well worth a try and well worth having around for special occasions."
"Poured out an almost opaque, but with a slight tilt and a strong light a ruby hue can be ascertained. Aroma of chocolate, roast, coffee, and a slight bourbon. Flavors of wood, dark chocolate, coffee, roast, with a slight top shelf bourbon. Mouth feel is creamy, almost like a milkshake, medium/high body, medium carbonation. It had a large head with a almost milk chocolate color, tan really does not do it justice. With being well balance, not too overwhelming in the bourbon character, but leaving a subtle hint of it. Very nice a must have."
"Heavy alcohol pressence brings the drinkability down some. This is a very good beer and worth the high price tag if you are into intense stouts. Similar to Bell's Expedition Stout with the bourbon pressence in my opinion."
"Deep, light absorbing black color topped by a mocha colored head. The nose has a sweetness that comes at you immediately followed by light coffee, and noticeable bourbon whiskey character. The finish has some dark fruit (dates primarily). The taste has some espresso up front, milk chocolate covered cherry, then the bourbon character, the flavor of the whiskey and the heat come across. lingering bitterness on the finish. Smooth and thick mouth feel. I just wish the heat wasn't there. Still, nice beer."
"bought a 4 pack of this for 19.99 at Sam's in chicago. yeah, thats a lot, but i figured its a beer i need to try. pours like a stout soda...fizzes and foams but then no head forms. completely black. Small bubbles rising. Looks like bad news for other stout brewers. Smells like, well, bourbon. After opening the bottle i can smell it from across the room. Up close I can smell some bitterness and sweet malts. ok, time to taste it...Hoo! wow. five. five. FIVE. Jeses thats tasty. a lot of Bouron up front is superceded by malts and coffee flavors. there's a bunch of alcohol in there too that makes my tongue numb but its tempered by a milky vanilla, chocolate taste and a hoppy finish. this tastes phenomenal. heavy and thick mouthfeel, maybe a bit oily. i would drink this every day if it were available and i were rich. Ill be laying the other 3 bottles down for a while to see how it it changes as the alcohol settles down a bit."
"That's why this is the greatest stout on the planet. Goose Island has done what no other brewery has figured out how to do, which is to use the oak to bring out more flavors in the beer, instead of overwhelm them. So the silky chocolate taste is really a flourless cake, the tobacco is really a 1926 Padron, and the espresso was just roasted this morning at Vivace to wake me from a long, wanton dream."
" This is the most complex barrel-aged stout I have had to date. And it's not about the number of flavors, but the way they are distinct and separate from each other. Chocolate, vanilla, oak, bourbon, smoke, and roasted/burnt grains. Mouthfeel is heavy and syrupy, definitely chewy. Insanely drinkable, though if you drink this quickly, you will miss some subtleties."
"Pours black with a brown head. Aroma consists of vanilla, bourbon, oak, maple and not surprising at 11%... alcohol. The mouthfeel is thick and full-bodied. This is no doubt a bourbon laced stout. Oak and vanilla are noticed right from the start. The bourbon flavor seems to completely take over and dominate any other typical stout flavors this beer may have had. GIBCS is heavy and boozey. Even after 15 month this beer still seems unbalanced and needs more time to mellow out. The label does say this can age and change for up to five years and it would nice to set aside a bottle and forget about it, just to see what happens. Overall I was a little disappointed. I expected a smoother and more complex offering. I do enjoy the taste of bourbon quite a bit, but the flavor on this one is still a mess."
"Can't drink a bunch of these at one sitting but this is a great brew when you can find it."
"This is a rare treat."
"I expected one whole helluva lot from Bourbon County Stout. All the more amazing, then, that it blew right past those expectations as if they were sitting still. This remarkable beer is easily the best that I've ever had from Goose Island. It's a true American original and is the perfect marriage of double stout and bourbon. The next time I see BCS, I plan to clear out the store."
"Bottled on 081605. 11 % ABV. Pours pitch black with no highlights at all. Thick foamy mocha head disappears very quickly, leaving no lace, and not much of a collar either. Oaky, vanilla, dark fruit, chocolate, and coffee in the aroma along with some hot alcohol. Very thick and chewy, with almost no carbonation, which seems to fit in very well. Warming from the alcohol. Flavor starts out with chocolate, burbon and oak, it then fades into a bit of dark fruit, and finishes with a long dose of coffee that lingers for quite some time. The bourbon character has added a great touch, and has probably settled down a bit with some age. A very solid and complex brew here. The bouron works here, and is a great example of American craft beer at work. Big thanks to mcallister for giving me this one to enjoy."
"Pour this one in a snifter and i could sniff and sip blissfully all night long. Can see how this one actually lives up to the hyperbole on the label and that no cigar is a match for this one. We enjoyed 99% cocao chocolate with this one and they complimented each other very nicely. Hope i can find this one again. l"
"Dark, pitchy black body with a glass-licking cushion of sticky brown head. Nose is complex and intoxicating. Sweetish dark fruits, brown sugar, molasses, licorice, bourbon (duh), and a dark chocolate bitterness. Sweet, sugary raisins and singed plums up front, with chocolate licorice and big time bourbon flavors. Wow. They must have aged this in bourbon barrels or something! Seriously, the bourbon flavor goes well with the dark fruits and the roasted chocolateyness. Very good. Warming, long, bittersweet, whiskey finish. Full-bodied and thick with a motor oil viscosity. Very well done."
"D - This isn't an everyday beer, nor would I ever want it to be. I was overwhelmed, and then I fell in love with it. BCS is my special occasion beer. It's been described by friends of mine as ""life-changing"". Ultimately, I hold other brews to this standard of sensory assault and surprising nuance. It's drinkable in the sense that when I want a rare, yet wonderful sort of beer, I go for this, no questions. It's not an easy beer, nor would I ever want it to be."
"Pours inky black, with some dark brown highlights. Maybe a half inch thick, caramel colored head, fades quickly. No lacing left behind. Huge aromas, dark fruits and roasted malts. Dark chocolate, vanilla and heavy molasses, not to mention some boozy smells. Very sweet tasting, lots of dark fruit flavors, bitter chocolate. Hints of vanilla and finishes with a heavy boozy bourbon taste. This is a huge beer. Very thick and chewy, and one of theses bad boys will fill you up. Lots of alcohol heat on the way down, maybe a little too much. Not a bad beer at all, if you like heat and strong boozy flavors this beer is for you."
"Served in a goblet, the beer pours black with a small dark brown head which doesn't stick around for too long. Obviously, it smells primarily like bourbon, and very sweet smelling overall. Some other smells that come through are vanilla, chocolate, malt and molasses. It tastes the same way to me, but with some coffee taste in there too, and a bittersweet aftertaste. I could definitely notice the alcohol in this beer. A lot of different flavors hit me all at once with this beer, it's a real ""big"" beer. It also has a big full body, with a creamy, slick, chewy mouthfeel to it. At first all the taste and alcohol hit me pretty good, but after a while I got used to drinking it. This is definitely a sipping beer, there's no way I could drink this quickly. I'd definitely recommend this to others, it's another really good beer from Goose Island."
"Huge thick malty feel with loads of sugary bourbon taste. This is not to far from being a julep gone horribly sugary. There's alcohol and oak flavors which completely hijack the finish and dry it out. I'm not really sure why this one tastes so over-the-top sugary. Other than that it's great. Maybe with a year or so on this bottle I would have enjoyed it more. It's close to being a big favorite of mine but it's too sweet and missing that extra nod of flavor. No denying this is a crazy big brew though."
"My head is running with ideas to add this to a chocolate cake recipe somehow..."
"Body is as big as they get, with low carbonation and a chewy, creamy mouthfeel and slippery, oily texture. Like melted silk on the palate. A superb barrel-aged beer."
"At nearly 1.5 years old, I'm guessing this bottle could be laid down for at least another 3 years before it will reach it's potential. It has a number of good things going on, but it is still way too hot. Would try again with much longer cellaring."
"There is no way I would be able to have more than one of these. Nor would I want to. This is quite an intense beer-drinking experience. I think anyone who likes to drink staight bourbon would love this beer. I like it too, but I will limit my consumption of it to once every couple of months."
"rich and velvety smooth with a small, tight carbonation. powerful flavor of dark fruits, vanilla, coffee, sweet liqueur and alcohol. great complexity, but the alcohol presence hinders the flavor and hurts the drinkability. a very good beer and a great experience nevertheless."
"Drinkability is OK but I wonder if this one wouldn't benefit from some extra time in the cellar."
"This beer is big. Very big, I am halfway through and it is already knocking my socks off. It pours black with a caramel/tan-red head. Some definite smoky aromas, along with coffee like roasted malts and some vanilla. More roast and smokiness up front in the taste, a quite large sweet bourbon follows with some warming alcohol in the finish. The alcohol is not overpowering but definitely assertive, and the bourbon sweetness is nicely balanced with the roasted malts."
"Drinkability: I can't wait until this beer is released for the first time in Minnesota later this summer. I will be stocking up, this beer is fantastic."
"Drinkable in a brandy snifter.... I like this one at cellar temperature and with a cigar, or even better, a nice big fat joint."
"got this in a trade but do not know who sent this but thanks. poured black with a brown head. aroma bourbon and some more bourbon, raisains, molasses, malt, vanilla, dark sweet cherries, woody. flavor I really didnt wamt to take a sip of this I just wanted to sniff it but I didnt pop the cap for nothing, got dark chocolate soaked in bourbon, kind of took my breath away, the cherries, caramel, did get get some smoke. for me this is what a beer is all about"
"I can't really place the style. It's not an Imperial Stout, not an American Double Stout, more a barleywine. Dark malt notes predominate throughout."
"Dark black color, pour appeared fairly viscous. Head is reddish-tan and starts off a half-inch that quickly dissipates to a nice crust. Initially in the nose I get an aroma of smoked meat, followed by a hint of sweet chocolate and a good whiff of alcohol. The taste is big on flavor and alcohol. Good flavor of roasted black chocolatey malt leaves a burnt, smokey finish. Really only light on the bitterness though. This beer has a nice sweetness to it. The mouthfeel is quite thick, lightly chewy, but smooth. Moderate carbonation is right on. Very tasty, and drinkable. A bit strong perhaps for more than one or two..."
"Drinkability is very candy like and addictive with intense flavors. ABV is there but it is very delicious. One bottle is enough to do the job for the night. Savor every last drop of this!"
"Thanks Dave!"
"D - for the style...it desreved the gold medal at WBF 2006. As for a session beer, it is not."
"Alright, I'll have to get enough to drink and cellar. LOL!!"
"I really enjoy good bourbon, and I also like an imperial stout so this beer seems to be made for me. What an amazing beer. Very complex and so smooth. This beer is good to begin with. Time has been very kind."
"Here's a beer that must be taken seriously. If one is not careful it will kick your arse. I was drinking this beer on St. Patrick's day after my band played, sadly though it was straight from the bottle, due to there was no acceptable glasses to place beer in at my friend's house. So with this in mind I can't really answer the appearance and smell section due to the fact I couldn't see it and the smell was extremely concentrated which is why I market them as average because I cannot give an indepth answer. On to the beer, I liked it the taste was a stout without a doubt with a major bourbon after taste that knocked most of my friends over that tried it. The mouthfeel was thick and the drinkability I took it slow and probably couldn't drink another one in the same sitting."
"I dont know if this would be a good session beer. It has a very aggressive flavor. Also, the alcohol content is a bit high. I think this is a good beer, but I think it could use just a little less Bourbon. Thank you karst for sending this fine beer to me."
"Bottle (courtesy of Dalaamar): Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large dark brown color foamy head with minimal retention. Aroma of bourbon is quite powering as well as some chocolate and vanilla. Taste is a mix between some chocolate malt with hints of vanilla, coffee and oak. Bourbon presence is interesting but a bit too powerful for my liking since it brings too much alcohol, which is not something that I necessarily enjoy. Body is full and has a creamy texture, which I quite enjoy. Overall, this is a very interesting creation, which Im glad, got a chance to try but I feel I would probably prefer the non-barrel aged version more. Also, this is more of a sipper then anything else and half a bottle would probably be enough for one session."
"Woah!!!! Maybe Noah, I mean this is one big F-ing beer. Very little head very little lacing. Nose is of what else but bourbon, vanilla, caramel, mollases, a little coffee, and American oak. One drink and you can tell this beer is something different, something big, and something special. Enormous amounts of wood but in a very good way adding complexity too the brew. Prune, dark unsweetened choclate, mollases, pure vanilla extract, and alcohol glide across the palate in a race for the most complex brew award. This is a very big, very masculine beer. I'm going to have to try the other Bourbon brews from the Goose because this one has won me over. Cheers."
"Drinkability: This is pricey and a treat but one of the best....I'd love to have 12 or so of these for special occasions....I'd love to pair it with a big rich Cuban cigar..."
"Thanks for the brew Big Ol ZAP!!"
"amazing, outstanding, delicious. An obvious ""must try"" for any beer lover."
"This beer is sooo viscous, that it literally can cake on to your skin if you let it set. Believe me... I know"
"Tiramusu, bourbon, coconut, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, peanut brittle, cake batter, fudge, and gramam crackers in the complex aroma. Black color. Really rich and full body, with a huge and brilliant mouth experience. Chocolate, fudge cake, with hints of caramel, along with an enormous barrel contribution, which gives hints of coconut, vanilla and oak. Wow. So rich and tasty."
"drinkability? i'm forcing myself to finish this thing."
"Very drinkable, very impressive. I'm glad I've got another one in the cellar and I'm looking forward to drinking it soon!"
"What an amazing beer. If only Glade would make an air freshener in this scent. I could smell it forever. Rich, buttery, vanilla, cocoa, tobacco and cafe mocha espresso. Simply decadent. At $20 a six this is a luxury item for sure, but one I will long for once my remaining three are gone."
"Very dark brown to black in color with a dark tan colored head that quickly dissipated leaving nothing more than a few islands of carbonation in the glass, no lacing. Initial smell was a bit disappointing but as this one warmed it got vastly better and I found chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, and of course coffee aromas. Others have said how much the bourbon stands out, to me it was definately present, but I found the chocolate and coffee flavors to be much more dominant and much to my delight. Mouthfeel is thick and full bodied with low carbonation, just how I think it should be. I'm stuck on where to rate this for drinkability; it was very enjoyable throughout, but it is a sipper. This is not one you would expect to have a few of, but every moment of it is enjoyable, so I think a ""4" is fair here. Wonderful beer and will get more before it's gone."
"Well done Goose Island."
"D - Very smooth for a high alcohol beer. Perfect for a cold winter's night next to the fire or as a rich dessert. Definitely a beer that would meet any special occasion I invite it to."
"What a difficult beer to review. This is not a balanced beer by any means. You really have to like bourbon to like this beer... really. Poured into a large snifter, this was quite an amazing pour, thick viscous black with angry cappuccino-colored frothy head that recedes to just a ring around the glass. The smell might be the absolute best thing about this beer: coconut, chocolate (think almond joy candy bars), a little banana, and some noticable alcoholic fumes that are a fitting preview of what's to come. The taste introduces itself with just the slightest char, which is quickly smashed to bits by a straight-up bourbon flavor, but with a bit more malty goodness, as if you made a chocolate cake with bourbon (I have, and it's good), or perhaps had a black organic coffee with a hefty dose of bourbon. The alcohol is not that well-hidden, honestly, and that means drinkability is where I have to take off the points. Age this for, say, half a decade or more, and then enjoy the fireworks."
"Overall: I think that given maybe two-three years in the cellar, this one could truly kick ass. As it is, it's a bit too boozy and hot with not quite enough complexity to really stand with the best stouts."
"the best beer goose island has ever made, hands-down."
"Drank in Chicago, my notes have me confused as to where it was consumed, eithe the hop leaf or the map room, either way, here goes. I was waiting a long time to try this one and it did not dissapoint. black-hole black in colours, light absorbing black, blacker than black, or none-more-black, as the first spinal tap album is. Aromas of in your face hot bourbon. Evan williams or rebel yell maybe...but more likely the mark. Vanilla, cocoa, exotic fruits, and nuts all jump into the air and fill the olfactorys upon opening and pouring this beer. Taste is hot bourbon big ass roasted maltiness, vanilla, cocoa, fine dark french-press coffee and more. A real palate raper if there ever was one. Mouthfeel is thick as all hell and drinkability is great for such a big beer. Damn man this one is serious. Pricey? Yes, but worth it. I wish it was easy to get more! Damn you Goose Island....make this shit again! and lots of it!"
"Appears opaque black burnt malt color forms an oozing tan chocolate head leaves fine specks of lacing after the oil like pour. Aroma is primarily charred oak vanilla with dark chocolate whiskey barrel aging is here on multiple levels vinous fruit alcohol almost takes out some un needed nose hairs. Flavor is big almost too big half the bottle is an ample serving size for me the vanilla charred oak tone is great in moderation dark chocolate and espresso coffee with leafy tobacco like edge to it all with fusel alcohol finish it doesn't hide the fact that it's 11% alcohol by volume very well. Mouthfeel has a Chewy texture low carbontion as it warms it's a bit cloying on the palate. Drinkabiliy is limited for me, it challenges the senses but sessionability is key sometimes if looking for an extreme barrel aged creation you have found a full flavored one."
"Intense tastes to say the least. Strong malts and aged in an oak cask leads to the very strong tasting beer that warms your stomach all the way down. Tastes of currants and vanilla along with dark chocolate and coffee. Smooth silky body with a thick oil feel to it all. As far as I could tell the hops were well masked by the malts and bourbon. This one really knocked me over and my tastebuds were ruined for the night. Really impressed with Goose Island on this one and I might as well have followed this up with a snifter of bourbon."
"Overall, a great tasting beer to sit down and enjoy."
"D - Easy and amazingly smooth given the ABV. Enjoy this one as an excellent after dinner drink. Savor it... and take your time. This one is worthy of your full attention."
"Inky, thick pour produced a thin chocolatey head. It settled quickly to a ring, but remained throughout and left fine, spotty lacing. Wow, what an aroma! The first thing I thought of was a really earthy, leathery, dark red wine, but then the vanilla, oak, and alcohol hit me. Definitely whisky. There's a rich roasted quality as well, but this is overpowered by everything else. Malty and sweet with a fair bit of chocolate starts things off on the first sip, followed by massive whisky/alcohol and vanilla in the middle. It mellows out again at the end, with chocolate and roast coming forward again, and it finishes with lingering alcohol warmth. Low carbonation and quite creamy. Full bodied, almost heavy, but not cloying at all. Alcohol is a bit aggressive, but appropriate. This is a ""take no prisoners"" kind of beer, really big and not apologetic about it. Fabulous. Thanks Viggo!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Thick and buttery, real heavy in the mouth. This is a savoring beer, in all aspects of the word... it packs a pretty good punch. Save it for a quiet evening, and don't be too surprised if you're asleep halfway through the beer."
"I had the regular on tap 5 years later and it was pretty good and well integrated bourbon. Black colour, and scored that for this review."
"If you can handle it this beer is supremely drinkable. I think it is a masterpiece, it is one of the most remarkable beers I have ever had. Delicious. Complex. Delicate. Violent. Boozy. Shrewd. Lovely. And you know the best part? I can buy it in Omaha now. I got my four-pack via RedHaze. Thank you. I will buy more and cellar some! I hate cellaring beers but I think this one is worthy. Highly Recommended!"
"I like this one alot. not something to have after a big meal... maybe something to sip later at night while smoking a nice djarum black and having some sort of really dry coacktail rye or the like..maybe even some olives, I know, sounds wierd, but it fits... what the hell do I know, I don't even have a BA fez.. damnit. I like this one, I will keep a couple of these around, it reminds me of the Rochefort 10 for some reason, of course a bit more on the alcohol side, actually.. it tastes more like alcohol is what I should say but does seem like the Roche10. I would love to see how this puppy ages and maybe loses some of its rough edges..."
"The flavor is malty, and fn boozey! She is tough, I probably could run the war protester mobile with this one. It is tough to get all the flavors under all the booze. It is sweet and sugary with a bit of molasses and dark fruits. DFH WWS is highly drinkable compaired to this."
"12 ounce bottle. Thanks beerinator!"
"Just tasted another bottle that had been in my cellar for a few months... much bigger on the chocolate. In the nose and in the taste. Huge chocolate that wasn't as dominating before. Very mellow and nice."
"(edit). So I finished this beer 1/2 hour after I finished my review. It ended SOOO oakey I couldn't believe it. The warmer it got, the oakier it got. Beautiful."
"Drinkability is a bit rough. Can only do one of these. I think I will let the rest of my bottles sit for a bit."
"Note to self: serve 5 degress colder than suggested, because this will take some time."
"Worth every penny. Pours a deep opaque black, no light penetrates, super thick, small tan head forms, leaves pretty quick but settles to a ring that lasts the glass, nice lacing and legs. Smell is huge, vanilla, chocolate, coffee, cherries, tobacco, bourbon, oak, toffee, and rum raisins, alcohol doesn't really come out here, super complex. Taste is chocolate, coffee, real roasty, with faint bourbon notes, lots of vanilla and oak, toffee, maple syrup, and a roasted chocolate bitter finish. Mouthfeel is super thick, very full bodied, with medium to low carbonation. Drinkability is pretty low simply because its thick as hell, although great. I though it was similar in complexity to Bells Batch 7000, smell/taste seemed to constantly be changing. Amazing stout, aged for 100 days in Bourbon barrels, but the Bourbon was held in check and worked very nicely. Fantastic."
"This is one of the thickest, richest and tastiest stouts I've ever tried. If you like em ""dark and sludgy"" this one will do it for you. Pours black, with minor dark tan head. Little lacing. Nose of brandy, chocolate and burnt malts. Bold char broiled flavors abound, whiskey soaked raisins, dark chocolate, a double black expresso tossed in, some vanilla, oak and more chocolate late,sheesh, can you say complexity?!? Very thick, super bad dark flavors. Meta winter sipper. Not for the faint of heart or those not into super bold dark beers. Goose Island continues to impress. The arrival of their beers in the NYC area this fall and winter has been the highlight of the local beer scene, IMHO"
"Pours a viscous black color with a thin and fizzy dark brown head that vanishes quickly. Roasted malt and bourbon in the nose. Thick and chewy mouthfeel with roasted malt and sweet caramel flavors offset by the bourbon. Very warming from beginning to end. The finish is chocolatey with a smokey flourish. Easily the best Goose Island beer I have tried."
" Overall, I'm not sure if I'm the best judge of these bourbon barrell things that everyone is doing these days. I prefer to keep my bourbon and beer in seperate glasses. This wasn't bad though. If I had one in the fridge and was sitting by the fire on a cold night, this would do the trick. For the 17 bucks this cost, I would go for the Matilda instead, also in the Goose Island Reserve series. Different style, but a better beer from the same brewery and cheaper. Glad I tried this."
"I have to be careful, as this is the only bottle I've ever had, and this stuff isn't sold locally for me. Once it's gone, it's gone. I think I just may weep when I finish this glass."
"Drink: couldn't get through a bottle due to not being a fan of the taste at all."
"Mouthfeel is just a little thinner than I expected, but it is velvety smooth and just thick enough to let me know I'm drinking a double stout. I thought the drinkabilty was really good, but I happen to like the taste of bourbon. If not for such a high abv I could drink a couple of these in a row. This was one hell of a sipping beer, and it makes me very happy that I was able to get a hold of a case."
"on drinkability i wouldnt be able to drink this all night long"
"Recommended, but the price is high Thanks Mark for bringing the bottle."
"The mouthfeel is velvety smooth. Nice thick and chewy body. Drinkability is not too high, however. I am definitely glad to have experienced this beer at least once, but I think I'm done with it until it has further ripened in the cellar."
"The most interesting part of the beer is its relative dearth of roasted stoutness. Despite this, it's quite pleasant to sip; however, I think if the alcohol was toned down just a bit and a strong roasted coffee flavor allowed to shine through, this beer would truly be a behemoth."
"Black with a sturdy brown head that leaves a great lacing on the chalice. The smell is nutty with lots of bourbon and whisky notes. This beer is definitely a sipper. It really reminds me of drinking a fine bourbon. The nutty flavor is reminiscent of holiday baking and is well balanced by the alcohol presence. This one is a bit fizzy, but sits nicely in my mouth as I sip. Drinkability is good. This is definitely not a session ale, but it is one of the most unique stouts I have ever sampled. Give it the old college try."
"A great beer, but definately a sipper! Take your time with this one and enjoy the craftmanship."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This is just fantastic. The beer is full bodied plus. It is chewy beyond description. The alcohol is definately a major player in this beer taste and feel. This is not an everyday beer and it has crushed my palate for the day. It is a beer to be sipped and savored. Man I love this beer."
"Drinkable? Well, I'd say this one is about chewy enough and big enough to bring even the biggest man down to his knees."
"This beer is a pitch black color, with hardly any head created by the gentle pouring of this beer into a tulip glass. The aroma is rich with notes of Bourbon, vanilla, a strong oak character, and woody tannins. The aroma is very appealing with a liquor-like alcohol note to it as well. The taste is quite thick, definitely a dessert, rich malt character that is dominated by the oak contributions; Bourbon, vanillin, and a slight tannic oakiness, and a definite buttery oak note. There are notes of coffee and roast malt here, but the rich buttery oak character dominates the palate. This beer is so rich and full, really a meal in a glass, it took me a while to chew my way through this beer, which was perfect for my last beer of the night."
"Lets see what some age has done to this brew. Pours a deep black color with a dark brown head that falls to a moderate coating over top. Nose is so big and full. I do not remember it being this intense. Lots of chocolate, vanilla and dark fruits with a very healthy dose of alcohol. The alcohol almost gets in the way. Intense. I almost just want to sit and smell it. Here goes with the flavor. I get big chocolate up front with a hint of fig, but the finish is the best part. So much going on after letting it develope. The chocolate is intense. It moves to a vanilla-mocha quality with a touch of roasted malt. Burps are all chocolate and vanilla. It warms the stomach very well, but the alcohol is not in the flavor. The feel is thick and syrupy with just a hint of carbonation. This is definately a sipper. Very intense brew."
"12oz. bottle @ Clybourn location: this is a wonderful beer. I finally got to Chicago to have it again after many years. This one pours an inky, thick, very dark brown color. The pour from the bartender resulted in almost no head, and what was there was light brown and didnt last at all. The nose is full of bourbon. Not as much as a shot, but very nice. Also some noted of chocolate, vanilla, and roastiness. The taste is incredibly rich and smooth, thick and silky. The flavor of bourbon is there, but well balanced with a full rich imperial stout behind it. A hint of sweetness in the aftertaste. This is phenominal!!!!"
" This pretty well defines the style ""Double American Stout"" described by the Alström Bros. Can't wait to congratulate Brewmaster Greg Hall on this masterpiece"
"01-05-05 batch. Considering its strength, the pour offers a generous dark brown head to cover the pitch black, completely opaque hue. Heavily malty aroma, spicy licorice and molasses paired along chocolate chips. It has that sweet dessert component that reminds me of chocolate cookies while the hops, mostly floral, pair nicely with the minty barrel character. Obvious alcohol presence peaks throughout the blackberry and grapey fruitiness, all in a tar like bold malt base. Port and Madeira reminding finish, very alcoholic, bubble gummy and strongly roasty (tobacco). Expert palate rounding, full bodied, soft in texture, intense mouth presence. Good stuff if not particularly my style."
"Definately a drinkable beer. If you get a chance to try this beer, do it."
"Poured an opaque black color with tan bubbles around the edges, that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate and some bourbon. Chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon taste. Not a bad bourbon aged Imperial, but for being the original, it didn't rock my world like others."
"Superb beer."
"Evilly drinkable, damn these good beers for not being on the East coast. I could imagine this holding its own against a cigar. I had it by itself, but would go wonderfully with any sort of rich chocolate desert. A sure fire winner, and deserve of praise."
"BA brother Brent is most generous and gracious for sharing this Top 100 selection."
"Impression: overwhelming to the modest beer drinker. This one is definately for grown-ups (if not conissours). She's definately a sipper. Should only be enjoyed with good friend, a cozy fire, and hour to spare."
"QUite a nice beer that I am enjoying thoroughly and recommend to anyone that likes bourbon, big beers, or both!"
"The flavor is too full to absorb in one or two sips, and only reveals itself fully about 1/4 way into the glass. There's almost too much to mention, and its flavors don't seem to appear in any order. So here's the list: whiskey (not necessarily bourbon, but there's definitely some! And I think also notes of something more salty, like an Islay Scotch), delicate fruit (apple, light red berries), coconut, hot alcohol, chocolate (as in German chocolate cake or raw, melted milk chocolate), molasses, coffee, spice (from the alcohol), dark fruit/the skins of dark fruit, dark red wine, pineapple/mango, dark caramel, smoke, wood, char. Stunning! But it is a sipper... there's way too much alcohol to take this in, apart from savoring it very slowly. It's so good, in fact, that the smell alone sholud keep you busy for quite some time. Overall, this is one full-throttle beer that's exceptionally satisfying, rich and drenched in alcohol! And although you CAN'T really drink more than one, it scores big because you will want to go and grab another bottle for another night!"
"Mouthfeel is nice full creamy in front lighter in the finish but overall very nice. Drinkability just finishing up my one and only bottle, sorry trying to keep from crying on my keyboard, starting to feel buzzed already that can't be right. Couldn't drink this all the time but sure wish I had a couple of cases in my cellar for those special occasions like days off. This stuff kicks ass if you like big stouts find some and try it, if you don't like it mail it to me I will gladly drink it. Many thanks again to merlin48 for this wonderful beer. Man I hate it when you find something you like but can't readily get again."
"12 oz bottle pours a thick jet black with a small brown head that doesn't last long with not much lacing either. Aromas of coconut, cake, chocolate and bourbon. Coconut, cookie, vanilla, chocolate, bourbon and coffee flavors. Full bodied with a oily thick mouthfeel, finishes sweet. This is a really amazing stout."
"Pours out an oily black. Viscuous and thick with a small tannish head that lingers like an invited guest. Smell is smoky and rich, chocolate and molasses in there somewhere. Taste is exquisite, malt and chocolate in the vanguard; a warming transcendant alcohol presence is in the air. And yes, somewhere in the aroma is a touch of bourbon itself along with some vanilla overtones from the oak and some caramel presence as well. Mouthfeel is amazingly rich.. I don't want this sip to end. Quite simply one of the best things I have ever tasted. I can't recommend this enough to any Stout lover I find. Yummm..."
"I need a case of this, not one 12 ounce bottle. There's too much flavor here to sit in so small a vessell."
"A 12 oz bottle of this is enough to drink all night. Without a doubt the most ""sippable"" of any beer I've ever had, as it is damn near impossible to drink this fast...not that I know anyone who would want to anyway. Even with drinkability suffering this was an enjoyable (very enjoyable) stout."
"Highly drinkable. Slowly."
"Inky black as night, with a modest but slightly imposing looking shoe polish brown head that slowly dwindles down to a rich rim around the glass. Aroma is a heady and befuddling mix of fermenting dark fruit, roasted nuts, bourbon and a woody weirdness. Certainly not what I expected, but very intriguing. Taste is a mature blend of bourbon and roasted malt, chocolatey and rich, loaded with complexity. Rotting dates and plums struggle against the bourbon infused tide to make their presence known, amongst the heat of the bourbon and the many layers of malty goodness. Chocolate mingles with hazelnut and molasses, with more heat and sweetness building in the finish. Woody flavor and traces of vanilla are prominent in the finish as well. This is one heavy hitter of an imperial stout, and a bold effort. Thanks to MJR for this black beauty."
"Pours a motor oil black that just looks so viscous that I know this is going to be a meal for a beer. A thin head rises with a firm chocolate color and laces the glass nicely. Aromas are all over the place with this brew. Strong expresso, roast and molasses like aromas part way for a barrage of vanillas and bourbons with strong tones of dark fruits. This almost reminds me of Sam Adams triple bock but more robust and well put together. Initial tastings start off with a strong dose of molasses and roast that give off a bittersweet combination that follows with some sharp expresso tones. Some dark fruits find their way into the mix but quickly strong roast and caramels take over. The finish is simply dilectable with a strong warming bourbon flavor that takes away some of the sharp roast and expresso tones and fills it with vanilla and some slight sweetness. The body to this brew is like a milkshake and a subtle carbonation lifts this beer off of the pallate in a most excellent manner. For 11% this brew is scarily drinkable and its what I started off with for my 22nd birthday on this fine St. Patricks day."
"Feel is powerfully heated with a bourbony sweetness and back-throated burn that is absolutely awesome to behold. Thickishly full body with an oily front and somewhat creamy length throughout the rest of its stay that mediates under the overall heat. If it were a notch less heated it would be phenomenal as far as its feel and drinkability. It could be quite a drinkable treat if it weren't so ABV hitting. Although, there's nothing wrong with slowing down and enjoying it, appreciating it, ...loving it, cuz that's what it's all about with this one. I didin't think Goose Island had it in them, but man does this stuff rock! Nicey nice!"
"Thanks again cmaruschak!"
"this puppy pours out the thickest most opaque black I have ever seen. Very small dark brown head present. Smell is sweet bourbon. Very sweet and malty, but the bourbon definitely overpowers the smell, good if boubon is your thing, and I am definitely one not to pass up on a nice glass of makers on the rocks, anyways, back to the review. I lowered the rating on the nose due to being able to smell only bourbon. Wow, bourbon definitely hits the mouth first. The alcohol sting of it is there and doesnt shy at all. But luckily the dark malts of the stout make a nice appearance near the end. Sweet bourbon followed by black coffee like malts. Bliss in the mouth. The bourbon is a little overpowering and a blended version of this may have made it a little more stout like, but this is definitely a bourbon drinkers beer. Rating this one high, but it could be better in my opinion if more of the stout qualities showed up. Mouthfeel is thick and full and perfect for a stout of this nature. Drinkability is another story. How do you rate this one, it is not drinkable in the sense of being able to sit back and drink a lot of them. The price also limits the drinkability on this one."
"D- This is a big chewy heavy stout with the alcohol, hops and roastiness to handle the conditioning in bourbon barrels. I nice beer but not one I could sit down and drink a 4 pack. I find myself drink water in between sips, this is beers version of port."
"Drinkability is very high despite high ABV. Awesome taste, great balance of sweet malts, chocolate and strong alcoholic whiskey notes. Find this beer if you can."
"I've never before been impressed by Goose Island brews, but they've gained my attention and interest with this one. I could easily give this one higher marks, but the hidden alcohol suggests that one bottle at a time is just about right. Highly recommended for lovers of big American stouts."
"Damn fine beer & worth every penny so you can all quit your bitchin'."
"A fireside sipper of the likes of an old ale or barleywine. I was taken aback by the outrageous price for a standard bottle - $5 and change, but this is a six-pack in a bottle. Sampled very young - if I read the label right only about a month old. I'll be curious to see what it does over time - I think I'll grab a few to lay back."
"A perfect Stout! The only complaint on this is the huge Price tag, otherwise Great Job Goose Island!"
"I was really looking forward to this one, but must admit that I'm a little disappointed. The cloying sweetness becomes more evident as the beer warms, and I find it hard to think about tackling another one. Not horrible by any means, but one per session is enough for me."
"This one pours a very dark color with a small head that doesn't stick around long, but leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet and has some chocolate, vanilla, and dark malts. The flavor is much the same. Lots of chocolate and bourbon notes along with some other dark malts. The body is as thick as it gets. I couldn't drink more than one because it's so filling. The beer just sticks to the insides of your mouth. Wow. The drinkability suffers only from the fact that it's so thick."
"This is the second time I've had this beer and have been looking forward to it all day. Pours a dark, thick, oily black with a thin (half-centimeter) reddish-brown head which quickly diminishes to nothing but a ring around the glass. Giving the glass a swirl leaves a nice thin coating of medium brown liquid wherever the beer reached up to on the glass. Smells strongly of oak, vanilla, and roasted malts. Some bourbon notes come through in the wonderfully strong and complex aroma. Feels full-bodied and oily smooth in the mouth. A very good tasting beer. Tastes of bourbon with strong oaky vanilla flavors particularly in the finish. Chocolate and roasted malts lend some nice bitterness and contribute to the very full and multi-dimensional flavors. Very well balanced overall. Quite filling and not a beer you'll be likely to have more than one of in a sitting, but one youll definitely want again."
"Seriously, this beer was remarkable. It was heavily bourbon-flavored, but the bourbon was so well integrated that the beer never seemed hot or vulgar. It was simply the best mix of beer and bourbon characteristics I've encountered. It's hard to not give it a perfect score."
"12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a deep black color with half a finger of dark tan head. No lacing in sight. The smell is sweet with some bourbon and chocolate character. A hint of vanilla as well. The taste is full of dark roasted malt, and there's lots and lots of chocolate in this one. A hint of bourbon and oak on the finish. Warming alcohol lingers. The mouthfeel is incredible, coating the sides of the glass along with the sides of my mouth. The drinkability suffers just a touch due to filling effect it has on you. A darn fine beer!"
"Super smooth, thick creamy mouthfeel with small bubbly carbonation. Quite nice. A great dessert brew that has a wonderfully unique flavor and would go great next to the fire on a cold night. Check this one out if you can!"
"719"
"It poured black and nicely oily. There was not a lot of carbonation or head. There is a dominant whiskey aroma and a nice vanilla thing going on. The flavor is a bit like chocolate milk with a shot of whiskey in it. It's a bit lighter than I'd like it, though."
"A deeper Imperial Stout-type nose. Big bourbon flavor, even powerful like a Hennessey. Beautiful black with red highlights. I saw the bourbon barrels they were aging this in at the brewery a few months back, and I'm pleased to say they've bottled it beautifully!"
"Big aroma of bourbon initially with some charred malt in the background. Color is black with only a small thin beige head. Mouthfeel is delicate and smooth with a warming alcohol sensation. Finishes a bit dry. Flavor is outstanding, roasted malts, chocolate, charred smoky wood and whiskey. Has a distinct sweet syrupy bitter finish. This one is a winter warmer and quite a pleasure to drink."
"Though this style of beer isn't to be consumed in large quantities, the subtlety of the bourbon flavoring would allow me to drink more than I would expect."
"This brew pours a very small dark brown head of fine bubbles that quickly disappear and left little lacing. It was incredibly smooth for what I was expecting to come from this very thick black bodied beer. Its 9% alcohol content is extremely well hidden. It gave mny whole mouth a tingling sensation with a very stong sweet malt molasses flavor."
"Really interesting beer, a stout lambic? Oude Noir? Who knows, but a snifter of this is about the right size for a beer this intense."
