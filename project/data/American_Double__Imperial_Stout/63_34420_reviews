"L: opaque black, zero light coming through a tulip glass, mocha head with great lacing. S: coffee, cocoa and some oak all very balanced and melded. T: roasted malts, coffee, cocoa, milk chocolate, oak, all balanced, pleasant bitterness in the finish. F: excellent mouthfeel, thick but not oily."

"O: This is an exceptionally well-done beer that I really appreciated, but still one that I didn't enjoy that much. I loved the way the pinot shines on the nose and is present in the flavor profile, but this beer is a bit woody and too charred for my preferences re. stouts. Nevertheless, I'd recommend that people pay attention to the best-after date: I had a bottle of this right after the 2013 came out, and it was just way too bitter too even drink. But the beer's improved a lot since then, and I can see this getting even better in another year."
"Overall - fantastic stout"
"Just had a 2012 bottle the other day. Soooo good. Not too sweet. I could really taste the wine barrel aging, even through the bourbon barrel aging. There is a wonderful tobacco taste to it."
"O - the 2014 Abyss has been the best one I've had. It is exceptional right out of the bottle and for me needs no aging at all. So many flavors and an aroma to die for. I'd love to find another bottle of this. Deschutes Abyss is a legend and the 2014 is the best they've ever created. An instant classic from a bottling that was already top shelf."

"My longest beer love affair. I've been buying a couple bottles a year since 2011, and it's consistently been fantastic, both fresh and aged. The type of beer you can just sit there and smell for hours."

"O: When it is available, buy it. A big ballsy beer well suited for winter evenings before the fire."

"I made an account for this beer. I'm not going to review this traditionally, but I do have a story about this beer. Had a shitty day, and stopped by a gas station of all places and found this, sitting there among bottles of malt liquor and trash. I have no idea why, but the price was $4. It looked good and I didn't know what it was so I thought it was some kind of gimmick. Malt liquor that is packaged like the good stuff. It was literally in the middle of the malt liquor rack. I bought one and spent the next 3 weekends buying 2 for each day, savoring the living shit out of this amazing beer. How is this $4? How? This weekend, the gas station was out, so I headed to a couple places and actually looked this up. Oh, limited time batch... find it at another place EIGHTEEN DOLLARS. I saved about $84 because of that gas station. No idea what the owner was thinking, but I sure as hell appreciate it."

"Beautiful hot chocolate-colored head with a body black as the abyss.  Aroma is oaky and slightly acidic, with lots of smooth chocolate and some discreet notes of bourbon and wine.  Taste begins like a wine-blended stout, moving through lots of oak and some quite noticeable wine before turning into very roasty chocolate finishing off a very long and lingering palate."

"Couldn't wait till the suggested try by date. Glad to have a few more bottles to enjoy the evolution of this epic ale."

"Dark, strong fully flavored stout."
"Tried a three year vertical (12,13,14). Definitely was better with age, 14 was way too boozy. Complex favors, looking forward to trying it again."

"One of my favorite beers!"
""
"WOW!!  I can't imagine a beer getting much better than this."
"Pours jet black wIth the smell of dark chocolate covered blueberries or cherries, the taste is very dark chocolate covered fruit with a nice lingering bitterness you can taste the wine and the oak in the end very very very great beer"

"Phennomenal brew. Pours deep black with slightly tan head. Smells of coffee, chocolate, and vanila. Drinks very smooth and very complex due to combination of aging methods."
"2014 vintage on tap at Hopleaf. Now I understand the reason for a ""best after"" date on the Abyss bottles- this is clearly way too fresh and hot. Liquid black liquorice - taxing to finish."

"So don't get me wrong.  A great complex beer.  But it just didn't quite grab me like Oscar blues Ten Fidy."

"Overall: Being a big fan of BA beers I felt this beer was one of my top 5 BA beers. Only negative is the light mouth feel.  I like a more thicker feel for BA beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A couple notes on this rating that seems way out of whack. Style expectations is a big part. No discernible chocolate or coffee notes, lack of both malt sweetness and hop bitterness. Barrell aged? Other than mouthfeel to some extent, you would never know. No oak, no vanilla present at all. Burnt cherry wood is bursting and dominates the profile, leaving little to no room for anything other than molasses which creates a strange but not all unpleasant BBQ sauce. At the price of this beer, I wanted more than what maybe an amazing marinade for lamb or beef."
""
""
"I assume it will be better with aging. Good now though. Looking forward to great."

"Tastes of dark fruits, like plums and raisens. It was pretty good, but a little too fruity for my taste"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Outstanding beer. Wish I had another one."
"Poured a chocolatey head that stuck around for the drink. The smell was fruity, boozy, very strong cherry scent. When you taste, you initially taste the cherry, then the bourbon. Just the right consistency for a imperial stout. One of the most complex brews I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Quite a good stout, showcasing both complexity and intensity of flavor. I'm glad I happened upon a bottle of it sitting on the shelf at a local shop as I breezed in for some birthday shopping."
""
""
"2014 version. Pours black, getting a lot of molasses and roasts in the aroma, not much barrel at all. Same thing in the flavor. It's a good beer but for the price it really needs to have the bourbon barrel more assertive. I don't know maybe a year of age changes this thing totally. Still a great imperial stout but I do feel I have to knock it down a bit for being at least a portion barrel aged but not giving me any in the flavor or aroma."
"22oz bottle shared during #bottlecherwednesday at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach. Poured into a tulip. This beer is black, black, black - opaque and unyielding. A two-finger brown head forms before collapsing to a film and leaves patches of lace in the process. More lace rings are deposited on the glass during the session. The aroma is as advertised, but deliciously so - roasted malt, unsweetened chocolate, molasses, oak, anise, coffee, and barrel notes of vanilla and bourbon. Taste opens up with roasted malt sweetness, molasses, coffee, anise, and vanilla. Some bitterness creeps through on the finish featuring oak, coffee grounds, a little citrus hop bite, keeping the surge of sweetness from washing out everything else. Only trace alcohol flavors come through, surprisingly. Quite full bodied, thick, creamy, silky slick texture, soft carbonation, drying and warming on the finish. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours jet black with a big tan frothy head that retains nicely. Smell has a slightly woody aroma with loads of charred malt, licorice, and hints of Star anise, cocoa and coffee. Taste follows the nose with loads of charred malt forward with a somewhat harsh bitterness intensified by a dry oaky almost tannic mid section. More oak, hints of vanilla, coaco, coffee and a dominating inteste bitterness in the finish. Medium to heavy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation and a dry bitter finish. Nice complexity but it could definitely use some time to balance out."

"This is very difficult.  I had a vintage fight 2010-2014.  The 2011 and 2012 was best.  If you are to rate this, i suggest letting it age at LEAST two years."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aging my second bottle of this one. Hopefully it'll meld these flavors a little better and the wine barrel won't be so over powering. Still a very enjoyable brew but I can't wait to see what a year does to this beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Perhaps I need to try a second bottle...it was decent but not as good as I was anticipating."
""

"Good smell, appearance and feel. Taste was not to my liking."

""
""
"BA said I had to justify my rating"
"Absolutely the best beer I've ever had.  Incredibly smooth for the ABV and not overpowering on the bourbon taste.  Can definitely taste the molasses and is just oh god amazing."

"2012 vintage was great, very smooth"
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice stout. I like it, but I'm not blown away by it. I am blown away by how smooth this is at 11% though. It's a complex brew. I feel the oak wine barrels dominate. The bourbon is subtle."

"Tried this soon after purchase. Should have aged it at least a year, but was eager to try it as it was my first time getting ahold of it. Fantastic beer, but could have used the aging. Very toasty and malty. Light undertones of sweetness, molasses and tartness. Slightly bitter. Nice alcohol undertones. VERY satisfying."
""
"O:  If you are a stout fan, or just a beer fan, you need to try this, it is not as boozy tasting as the 11% ABV would suggest, and it is like unbelievable!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: While not bombastic, I don't believe that is what Deschutes attempted: instead, this extremely quaffable beer has no pretensions and is a simply elegant example of the style. This would win over someone who doesn't prefer Imperials."
""
""
"Big beer!  Perfect closer or just a great choice for a cold day sipper."
""
""
""

"Overall - This is an excellent beer, fully deserving of the 4.5 rAvg and the 100 rating from the BA community. I don't have to explain a lot. Just go get the beer and drink it."
""
""
""
""
"Very nicely done, Deschutes. Now, I am drinking a 2014 made last November, so I can't fully assess what this beer is supposed to taste like in a year and so on. But it is still extremely good and more than pleasant to drink. I'm not getting much smell on the nose yet, but the taste is phenomenal, after just 3 short months. Tastes as it should as described on the label (molasses, chocolate,bit of licorice, some vanilla) and it's awesome. An unbelievable clean finish, with literally no aftertaste but a kiss of Bittersweet chocolate cookies. I just can't wait for how this one tastes in another year or more"

"This is one of my favorite beers, and 2010 was one of my favorite years. This was the last release that wasn't aged in wine barrels and as of now (just a hair over four years on) it is drinking amazingly well."
"2014. (I own & have tried 2010-2014, in their made year, and also as a quad vertical this past winter.  My personal faves were '12 & '13)"
""
""
"To get more in depth - there is a ton of ashy malt flavor in there, but the various barrels, even the 6% bourbon barrels, play their own parts in influencing the overall flavor. The cherry and the red wine are the stars here, putting their own spin on the semi-sweet chocolate notes of the exceptionally dark malt backbone, but the bourbon is still detectable, and for someone who has grown a bit weary of bourbon barrel beers, not only is the bourbon character perfect, but it is still there while being, wonderfully, a background nuance to the other amazing qualities in this beer. I actually can't perceive any flavor additions from the licorice or molasses or vanilla, but honestly that's fine with me. Vanilla can get a little played out in stouts, and licorice is not really my thing. Molasses can have the tendency to dry out a brew more than flavor it, and maybe it's simply cutting into the sweetness overall, which is fine. Having some subtle cherry and wine notes in a super-rich, dark-chocolate, ashy malt menagerie is plenty complex for my palate, and holy crap was this a treat. As close to a perfect beer as I've ever experienced. Just off-the-charts wonderful. The only beer I've had that could hold a candle to this is Founders Imperial Stout, and soon we'll see which I actually prefer."

"2013 bottle into a snifter at cellar temp. I've had this before and remember not loving it; my memory was confirmed here. You can save yourself some time and have a better experience by pouring a shot of bourbon and a splash of ouzo into a bottle of Dr. Pepper. If you want the authentic experience, stir in a spoonful of ash. That's probably harsh, but I found this brutally burnt/bitter tasting, messy, and thin."
""
""
""
"Overall - This beer is an absolute masterpiece; tastes like a barrel-aged chocolate covered cherry followed by about 20 other complex flavor notes, but dries out perfectly for a near-crisp finish. Obviously a lot of work, planning, and master-craftsmanship went into producing this beer - you can taste it in every sip."

"Easily one of the bigger disappointments in my beer history. Maybe I drank it too fresh, but just kind of a mess. Not my thing, I guess. I love BA Stouts, this one is not going to make any best of lists, personally."
""
"2014 Reserve. Absolutely delicious. Plain and simple."
"I don't get the attraction with something so nearly undrinkable, even though the flavors are quite intriguing until the bitter medicinal quality catches up. From the 22 oz bottle (2014 vintage) purchased at Liticker's Liquor in San Diego. The price was eye-watering but I felt obliged to try it, but once will be enough."

"A Dark and deep Stout. with a lot of complexity. I have on in the cellar, can't wait till it has some age. I loved the one I enjoyed with the licorice being a little strong, I am sure it will mellow out nicely."
"2014 vintage on tap in winter 2014.  The deepest blackest looking beer I've ever seen with a dark brown frothy head.  Thick mouth feel and offers a very complex flavor profile."
""
"2013 vintage shared with me by my friends on my daughter's birthday.  Poured into Fiddlehead teku glasses.  Pours a typical stout-black with less than a finger of cappuccino-brown head that persists and leaves some tracing.  The smell is totally unique, combining licorice and black cherry with dark roasted malt and red wine.   The taste is similar to the aroma, but with additional layers of complexity - dark roasty malt, black cherry, big-chewy red wine, licorice, molasses - an incredible array of complimentary flavors.  The mouth feel is just about perfect - thick and oily, but not as thick and sweet as some of the big stouts out there, adequate carbonation - definitely a sipper, but not cloying.  Overall, this is a wonderfully complex stout, almost on par with a fine wine."
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the most unique and complex stouts Ive ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2014 Vintage.  Have one in the cellar and will definitely wait a year before trying it.  Great look and mouthfeel on the fresh one, but the fruity tartness from the wine barrels overwhelmed my palate.  Been looking forward to the Abyss for years and I will re-rate after proper aging."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bought one and drank it before the ""drink after"" date. Definately should have waited. Now I want one to cellar."
"Super complex right off the bat 2014 vintage. If I got more than one I'd be aging some. None of the barrels are overpowering, there are a lot of nice smooth subtle flavours here and it hides the alcohol well."
"I got two bottles, one to wait for the best after date. I hope age makes this better....... So far not that impressed.... For what they charge for this stuff. The more I drink this stuff, the more I hope it gets better with age.... Although I really like the feel of this beer. It's very creamy!! The way a good stout should be. There's nothing worse than a thin stout....."
"Deschutes has some potential with this brew.  If they'd up the barrel aging, and actually sold it when it's quality was peaking, they might have something here.  Until then, they'll have to live with reviews such as this."
"Recommendation: Given the notoriety of this beer, I think it's worth a shot for everyone at least once. Not exactly worth the price, though. Also, consider buying two with one to age, or just age a single bottle, especially if you don't like fresh, bitter imperial stouts."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very well crafted imperial stout. I would  say it's almost closer to a Russian imperial version with the assertive hop qualities."

"O: Wow.. what a complex crazy beer. This has been on my list for a while now and now that Deschuttes is in WI I was able to grab it off the shelf with relatively zero effort. Awesome flavors with great mouthfeel. This really stood out over so many other hyped stouts. Unique and it lived up to the hype."

"Sets the standard for bba stouts."
""

""
"Very complex.   Tried one aged and one way before the recommended date.  Definitely worth the wait, only gets better with time"
"Overall, this is just a wonderful sipping beer. While the beer is still rather fresh, I can only see it getting better with age. I don’t normally care for stouts and this is the second best stout I have tried to date (behind BCBS). As it warms it keeps getting more interesting! I could see this pairing well with some smoked meats, maybe a brisket. I could also see it with a dense chocolate cake or a terimisu. I give it a 99/100."

"2014 - Best imperial stout I have ever had, can't wait to buy more"

"O - Glad I finally got to try this.  Thanks Grant (Sue) for the bottle.  I'm glad that Deschutes distributes to Illinois now.  I was able to get my hands on a couple 2014 to stash away in the cellar.  Prost!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor is bourbon and oak, with charred roast malt bitterness that overwhelms. I could see how this could use some age. There are some nice vinous notes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - In all fairness, this beer probably shouldn't be reviewed until it's ""best after date"" like Mirror Mirror. That being said, Mirror drinks much better right out of the gate. This beer is pretty harsh, and all over the place flavor wise. I really think my score on taste will only be higher when I drink my next bottle a year from now. It cant really get worse I think. This is good, but hopefully it will reach the ""world class"" status that it has earned. Right now?… Nope. Not even close for me."
"As others have noted this is a beer that probably benefits from aging a bit.  Some of the flavors overwhelm when it's fresh out of the bottle."

"2009, 2010, 2011 and 2014 vertical on draft. The older the better with this one."

"Definitely worth putting a little age on this one.  The wine barrel and cherry bark combination gives this a bitter, spicy, burnt flavor that dominates.  Delicious, but in need of a little taming."

"Didn't like this one as much as I hoped. It was overly roasty and the wine barrel/liquorice taste was a little odd to me. I would be interested in trying this with a little age on it and I do see that Deschutes has a ""best after"" date on the bottle. We'll give it another shot down the road."

"Dark head, really dark beer. this beer actually had a decent head which is surprising for a high alcohol beer. The aroma was a smoky whiskey, with a slight hint of coffee. Lots of bitterness in this beer especially at the start this than transitions for a coffee/ chocolate flavor that is very light. It ends with a nice light vanilla whiskey flavor. Really enjoyed this beer the roasted notes really come out causing come of the initial bitterness. I feel like this beer had more bitterness than most barrel aged stouts of its kind."

"One of the better barrel aged stouts I've had in a while. Flavor is that of a dark roast coffee, with dark chocolate, a slight bit of vanilla and molasses. Flavor becomes more complex as it warms up. Very well balanced with a slight alcohol burn at the end. Nicely done."
""
""
""
""
"O: 4.5 I’ve been wanting to try this beer for nearly four years now and was very excited to finally have the opportunity. I really didn’t know what to expect and was presently surprised. It is unlike any other barrel aged stout I’ve had; not at all similar to something like BCBS. Rather, the additives and, perhaps more importantly, the wine barrel a great fruitiness to counter the dark, rich beer. Glad to finally have this and was not let down."
"I think it would be amazing for Deschutes to do a 100% bourbon barrel-aged version., but they seem to be against 100% barrel aging for whatever reason."
""
"I now have a bottle of the 2014 sitting nice and comfy awaiting for me to open next year or maybe 2 years from now. Decisions decisions."
""
""
""
"I tried the 2013 version, on draft.  And then I tried it again :)  This beer is really amazing.  Pours dark brown and opaque, with a thin, filmy dark brown head, lots of lace.  It has great complexity, with dark fruit, coffee, cocoa, anise, wood, whiskey, and leather notes.  But, it does not hit you over the head.  There is a subtlety to the flavors as they develop.  You notice the heavier flavors at first.  Then wait a bit and you notice some of the smooth, sweetness and even a hint of hops.  Thich, rich and winy, with low carbonation and a long finish.  Well-balanced.  This is a big beer, but also thoroughly drinkable.  I really have to get my hands on some of the prior years."

"2014 vintage via growler fill. Excellent stout; easily one of my favorites. Dark and smooth with a delicious coffee note, but not overpowering. I think the balance of this beer is what makes it so incredible. Also got a 22oz bomber to cellar for future tasting next year, at the earliest."

"This annual is pretty complex.  Great look, nice smell, and substantial mouthfeel.  For me, the taste is a little too tart/sour.  The bourbon is very faint.  It is one of a kind, and very good.  Complexity is up there.  However, compared to other big annuals, this is not as big."

"This was by far the best stout I have ever tasted. Beautiful and worthy of it's top rating. I aged it for 11 months and poured it into a brandy snifter. More to come..."
""
""
""
""
"2009 Reserve poured from bottle into snifter. Aroma was black licorice, chocolate, vanilla, hazelnut, a little bit of booze and some dark fruits like pomegranate and plum. Color on this bad boy was a pitch black abyss with a a brown head that receded slowly. It was as expected a big, full bodied beer that was thick and creamy. On the palate I got a lot of the same stuff as the nose, the black licorice and chocolate were the big ones, but also those dark fruits, vanilla, and a little bourbon as it warmed. This is a phenomenal beer, but I personally don't think five years on it was really necessary, a couple would probably have sufficed, and I say that having had it aged to various degrees in the past. Regardless of my opinion on that this is still something to pick up and drink fresh, or experiment with aging to your liking. All in all I can't wait to have my next Abyss."

"I recognize that the big (ie., ageable) great beers should be great fresh, and then potentially become even greater (or at least great in different ways) over time--until some inevitable point of decline years down the road.  The Abyss, I think, is an exception to this rule.  It is good fresh, even very good, but not great: an intricate combination of flavor that has not quite come together into a cohesive whole.  Give it time.  It needn't be a year (though maybe that or longer is best, if it's cellared properly), but at least a few months.  The stronger elements in this brew (maybe for your palate it's the wine barrels, or the cherry bark, or the roastiness, or...) could be too harsh right out of the gate; but eventually they will all soften and meld, and yield a sipping beer of exceptional subtlety and complexity.  Those who are pining for a 100% barrel aged version of this are, I think, maybe missing the point.  There are plenty of beers like that.  Deschutes's fractional approach to aging, and aging in a few different kinds of barrels, are precisely what make this beer so very special."

"2007 vintage. Deep dark malty goodness. I bought a case of it in 2008 and cellared it since then.  Initially was overpoweringly strong almost off putting the medicinal alcohol over shadowing even the heavy malt flavors. Around 2010 it came into its own. Mellowed out and smoothed out the finish to silk. Sampled one or two every year after and it just gets better and better. Down side, there is only one left. Ok, I should have put down 2 cases. However there is still the 2009 and 2010. Will there be more? Oh please! A masterful brew. Will it return soon… Oh please!!"

"Overall - Not as sweet as I thought it would be.  The booze is very well hidden and thee beer has a complex taste with lots of nuances.  Lots of flavour and yet incredibly well balanced and easy to drink.   You can tell a lot of work/care went into this, and it is worth the price."
"I couldn't wait very long for this one and I'm afraid I should have done so. It's a big strong stout with a little too much booze and a too little complexity. The rather hot nature of the beer is something I've noticed in Deschutes' big beers early on in their lifetime. Flavor is good but unclear and heavily balanced toward the roasted malts. I will have to age the next one for longer. Overall it was still a good compliment to Jackie Brown as it would be for The Abyss, of course."

"2013. Pours pitch black with a thin brown head and decent lacing. Lots of chocolate and vanilla on the nose with notes of bourbon, oak, molasses and licorice. Like the aroma, chocolate and bourbon on the tongue with some roasted barley and licorice. Full bodied with very little carbonation. Finishes dry. A standout in the crowded BA Stout market!"

"I had this on tap at Hangar 9 in Carbondale, IL and felt lucky to do so. I bought a bottle at Speakeasy Liquors last Spring and I've been aging it for optimal tastification. I look forward to cracking it in a couple weeks, at which point I will re-review. The look and mouthfeel are dynamite, and it was super boozy. By far the best thing I have had from Deschutes."

"Overall, one of my favorite barrel-aged stouts around. The use of multiple types of barrels and the lower percentage of the overall blend allows the barrel characteristics to complement and accent rather than taking over the beer. And in this case, the additives work perfectly with the base stout and barrels to create a symphony of a beer--but this is no Mozart. While it's clear precision is at work here, the dark, overbearing stormy temperament to this beer is more akin to Mahler."

My only gripe is that this beer isn't more widely available, because it is a champion amongst it's peers. Now my 5th go-around with this beer, and it sits easily in my top 5 beers of all-time."

""
"With the first taste of the full tongue the head (if drank with it) fills the month and the flavor pop everywhere. The chocolate/vanilla hit every part to the initial swallow. The oak wood comes later thru the after taste and the overall flavor stays with you for a few minutes keeping the overall experience going."

"Jesus where to start... The appearance was pitch black, light caramel lacing didn't last long. Didn't need to. Smell was dark smoky malty molassesy bourbony goodness. There was a strange 'briney' smell that burned a little. Don't know how to explain it. Capers? Also some tartness, cranberries, cherries maybe. Taste was huge and complex. Cherries, dark chocolate, molasses, oak in the back. Insanely pleasant aftertaste that lingered forever. Mouthfeel is something I'm still not adept at critiquing, it was lightly carbonated and pleasant. This is the single best beer I've ever had. That may change in the future, but I'm happy to have gotten to experience such an expertly aged beer that was meant for such."

"Well, the hype around the Abyss might be just that, hype, but that shouldn't detract from the fact that this is a heady, soul-steadying, and, um, 'complicated' Imperial Stout, one engendered by its outright drinkability (before the after, eh?), and further enabled by the expertly integrated, north of 10 points ABV. Like the special person of my heart and mind, this is strong, American, unapologetic, and duly faded to black. R.I.P., with much love."

"I had a 2013 reserve of The Abyss. This is a very good beer. The Best after date is 8/16/14, so I drank it a little early. I should of cellared it for a while longer, but I just couldn't do it. It had great flavor but I didn't get too much of the barrel aged flavor which might come out a little more with the aging. I did have the flavors of the molasses and a touch of the vanilla. Overall this is a beer to try, I hope I can get my hands on another to age for a while to see how it rounds out."

"Pours a viscous dirty motor oil dark brown to black capped by a fluffy two finger dark tan head. Excellent retention with significant splotchy lacing. Complex nose; rich, dark chocolate, underlying roasted malt, toffee, charred oak, hints of red wine, dark fruit notes, just a faint touch of bourbon, and some pleasant booziness. The flavor is even more dense. Dark chocolate leads joined by plenty of dark fruit, most notably black cherries dominant, supported by raisins and prunes. Rich molasses with toffee join in along with caramel and dark chocolate notes. Oak and vanilla take the lead joined by some roastiness and anise. Finishes with some very light hints of red wine and warm booziness with a slight accent of bourbon. Big full body that means to be reckoned with. Moderate to low carbonation creamy, smooth, fairly velvety on the palate. The Abyss is truly a work of art and is among the top tier of both barrel-aged imperial stouts and blended barrel-aged brews."

"I have been wanting to try The Abyss for some time. I've been a fan of Deschutes Beer having many of their offerings on tap when visiting Portland but never The Abyss. Then when visiting San Francisco I came accross a great little bar called the Amsterdam Cafe that had in on tap. I couldn't believe it! I know that many times you build up your expectations for a beer and are usually let down. Not this time. The Abyss was amazing! The appearance was as dark as black ink with a thin foamy head. It smelled like coffee and chocolate and tasted like it smelled with a hint of vanilla. It had a couple more flavors that I couldn't quite recognize but it blended so well and tasted so great that I wasn't really paying close attention. The alcohol is extremely well hidden but definitely is felt when walking out of the bar. The mouthfeel is perfect with a thick, smooth feel that goes down easy. Overall, this was one of the best beers I've ever had and for the time being my number one beer drinking experience."

The Abyss definitely looks and feels the part with great appearance and mouthfeel, but I think some of the flavors here just did not click together on my palate. This feels a bit like experimentation to me and perhaps I just am not in the mood for the multitude of flavors tonight...anyway, high marks for complexity and structure, but only good marks for taste and smell."

"2013 Reserve.Pours a pitch black color with a 1/2 inch of dark brown head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is a great mix of oaky vanilla, cherry, caramel, coffee, dark chocolate and earth. The taste is more dark chocolate and coffee along with molasses and roasted malts. Nice notes of dark cherry, oak and vanilla throughout. Some boozey oak at the finish with more hints of cherry and earth as well a chocolate syrup. Velvety, slick mouthfeel with a moderate amount of carbonation. There is a lot going on with this beer.

"This is a beautiful beer on the pour. Abyss is appropriate for the inky, black liquid that oozes into the glass like Quik. It bubbles up with a gorgeous tan head. The nose is a bit muted, but smells of cocoa powder. The mouthfeel is luscious, almost as thick and rich as chocolate milk. Cocoa dominates the palate, but there are also notes of oak and molasses. This is definitely a little less barrelly than some big BA stouts like BCBS and also a touch less boozy. Overall, a great beer. Seek it out."

"A wonderfully complex beer with huge back palate flavor. I recommend this beer slightly cool instead of cellar temp."
"Pours black with a centimeter of caramel-colored head fueled by a constant stream of bubbles from the base of the snifter. The aroma is of bourbon, chocolate, molasses, vanilla, caramelized brown sugar, caramel, oak, and roasted malts. May pick up some anise if consciously looking for it, but it’s subtle if there at all. It tastes of bourbon, chocolate, rich/roasty malt, sugar, oat, oak, vanilla, raw molasses, licorice, and a hint of smoke. Mouthfeel is wet and viscous up front with a velvety finish that is warmed by the ethanol. Overall, this is a complex and delicious stout that does a great job of balancing and showcasing a wide variety of flavors and ingredients."

"O: Admired even more than I like it: It is created with a very complex brewing process, but all the pieces come together artfully."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all, very pleasant. But I must say that, based upon the hype, my expectations were disappointed. Honestly, to my taste, Parabola is twice as good as Abyss."

"The finish on this beer has the slightest and sweetest of burns. I have hunted down the best beers that I can get my hands on (spent more of my income than I care to admit), and as far as stouts go this is second only to Dark Lord in terms of complexity and deliciousness. I can safely say that you can believe the hype and go for this beer, a complete joy to drink. Cheers!"

"O – I’m still pretty new to imperial stouts in general but this is certainly a very well-rounded beer. From memory it seems to be on an even keel with Narwhal, albeit with a richer body and less caramel or maple on the palate. I look forward to seeing how this beer ages."

"Appearance looks just like the '11 and '12, at least how I remember it. At the very least, it looks black and foreboding, opaque. Smells smoothed out actually, no booziness at all. Similar and very complex nose. And flavour is great- dark fruits, roast and dark malts, chocolate and coffee, a little licorice. Complex and not boozy at all. Medium bodied, creamy, not hard to drink at all. Very smooth and hides ABV well. I'm starting to think that while Abyss is good to drink years later, I suspect that with the decrease in % barrel-aged components, you might as well start drinking it fresh. Because fresh '13 vintage is the best I've had so far versus 1-year old '12 and 2-year old '11."

"Pours out pitch black with a thin head that looks like whipped hot milk on top of a hot chocolate. In the nose, I get chocolate, coffee, vanilla, berries, stone fruits, and a punch of booze. Up front in the flavor there is loads of roasted malts and dark berries with a touch of tartness. Chocolate come out in the middle with coffee on towards the finish. Vanilla pokes its head out around the middle, but is not beating you over the head, like typical barrel aged stouts. I pick up some buttery toffee as well. Chocolate covered cherries linger on in the aftertaste. Delicious. Boozy touch in the finish, but not as prevalent as in the nose. Light acidity refreshes the palate. I'm glad I sat on this for a year. Mouthfeel is full, but not overly thick as the flavor profile would suggest. Mild carbonation. This is a fantastic stout, utilizing a blend of non-barrel aged stouts alongside different barrel aged expressions. An excellent example of blending skill over aging a stout 100% in cloyingly vanilla-forwarded bourbon barrels. Excellent."
"This is very good, not as rich and diverse as I expected but it may have mellowed over the years."

"Certainly one world class stout, brings a huge complex flavour at this strength with a ton of richness and no heat. Deep dark molasses flavour, lots of spicy oak. Amazing balance and complexity, haven't had it fresh but aged is really inspiring, great complexity and spiciness. Definitely one of the best stouts I've ever had. If I could but a case I would. 4.75"
"o: perfect. this deserves 100. do yourself a favor and make sure to inhale through the nose as you take each sip"

"O - A well balanced, full bodied beer with lots of flavor. Can't wait to open this years batch."
""
""
"Overall this was a treat! Not sure how much the 14 months age did for it as I haven't enjoyed this fresh before (instructed to at least age a year per the bottle). I'll definitely be looking forward to the annual release of this in the future."
""

"World-class, no doubt! Extremely complex and damn near perfection."

"Excellent beer, one of the best I've had overall so far."

"O: Not blown away, YET. Wanted to try this somewhat fresh but I think that might have been a mistake. Going to cellar my other bottle for a few years. I think age will do a lot for this beer as others have pointed out."
""
"O: This one needs to be lain down for at least a year. It is delicious, no doubt. However, as of right now, this beer currently rides a fine balance. At colder temperatures, the roasted malt dominates every aspect of the experience. As the beer warms it mellows, but the alcohol heat accentuates some of the spice characteristics and this tends to overwhelm the beer. There are a lot of awesome flavors in here, but I think they do need some time to settle down."

""
""
""
""
""
"I must say, the Abyss delivers a devastating dose of chocolate, oak, and earth, wrapped up in a bunch of other things that just enhance the overall stout experience. An imperial stout that boasts expertly controlled, balanced power and intensity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A complex beer that didn't quite deliver as I'd expect on the nose, but it came alive on my tongue. Very tasty. I look forward to aging a few of these bottles to see what more the beer has to offer."

"O- I wouldn't say this was a letdown but it's certainly not worth all the hype. I got a lot more ""wow"" factor from Dissident and Black Butte XXIV."

"Probably not everyman's brew, but for those of us who live for the dark, The Abyss is top notch, setting a standard that is rarely matched. I'd give it ""5" across the board, but I'll bet it improves even more after additional aging, so I have to leave room for that!"

"Overall: I wish she were a woman. I'm in love."
"REVISTED December 14, 2013 with 2013 Reserve. Beer has gotten significantly more hopped and has lost much of it's mouthfeel and intense flavor. Still a very nice and well made beer but my over all rating has now gone from a 4.7+ (under the old rating scores) to a 3.75; still very good but not ""outstanding."" This was once a standard by which others could be judged. No more; the world has caught up with and surpassed Abyss. JMO"

"2014 on tap at WOB Easton. Better than 2013 bottle tasting."

""

"Overall, a tasty tasty brew. It doesn't try to be the biggest or booziest, but is just really well-crafted. I preferred the '11 to the '12 but they were very similar. May re-review this when drinking a '10 which different barrel ratios."

"When you look into the Abyss, the Abyss also looks into you...and says ``Drink me''."

""

""
""
""
"O - A delicious and robust stout that lives up to the hype. Had a fresh bottle last year and lots of hot bourbon in the taste; aging this beer has benefited it immensely. Worth the price!"
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle, into a Petrus chalice."
"O- Easily one of the greatest beers I have ever had, pure perfection. I have not been a huge fan of some of the more highly regarded imperial stouts, but this one absolutely lives up to the name."
""
"Finally got my hands on this guy. A tough find this side of the Mississippi, this feller is. Poured into a Chimay chalice and glorious fumes are already wafting my way. Pours solid black with just about the darkest head I've seen. I think I could get drunk from the aroma alone: layers of rich, intoxicating chocolate, molasses, licorice and more barrel than expected. Faint coffee notes linger deep in the complex goodness. Wonderful flavors, but way hotter than expected. I guess that's what I get for cracking my 2013 vintage before its ""best after"" date. Rich chocolate, smoky malts, espresso, bourbon and I'm definitely picking up more of that licorice note I detected on the nose. Complex and nuanced, with some age this would be just about perfect. Mouthfeel is thick and wonderful but compromised somewhat by the alcohol bite. Very glad to have tried this. A little peeved at myself for not aging it just a bit and waiting for that ""best after"" date's fruition. But it's okay - I have another bottle! The universe is mine, or something."
""
""
" Quite delightful, rich, mellowed, full bodied black roasted malt surrounding bright, clean, licorice, dark chocolate, & hop flavors. Mild bitterness was in perfect balance. The alcohol complemented the flavor profile while tasting smooth as silk. There were hints of vanilla and molasses. As pleasant as this was I found myself wishing it was a bit less sweet."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very good beer, i taste lots of coffee and charred oak flavor is very present."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Abyss does have some nice variety to it, however, I would have had no idea that this was aged in wine barrels. Also, it is very roasty and charred on the palate. It certainly needs to mellow out before I want to give this one a go again."
""
""
"O - Overall this was a great beer. I was hugely disappointed by the nose and was preparing for this to be underwhelming. Glad my initial thoughts were wrong."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. I have been looking forward to trying this and all I can say is wow! This is a really complex, well balanced Imperial stout, it stands up to any stout that I've tried."
"O- I have heard that Berserker and The Abyss are two good beers to compare. I would generally agree but say that Abyss has the black liquorice and Berserker has more Molasses. Both great beers that would cellar very well. I prefer Berserker; even though it is rated lower. To each his own."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"UPDATE: Currently enjoying the 2012 Reserve. The only thing I would add is a more pronounced smoky character to this batch. It's like drinking a little bit of campfire. And who doesn't like a campfire?"

"Overall: outstanding beer! As it warms up, the complexity builds up. Love the black licorice and vanilla aromas and love how neither sweet nor bitterness dominate the flavors."

"O: Very well done beer. Complex flavors, yet not overwhelming or sloppy. Easy to drink. 11% alcohol to warm you up on a winter night...or day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Amazing, warms you up on a cold night and relaxes you, the alcohol is masterfully hidden on this. The wine barrels come through mixed well."
""
""
"looking at the label: says best AFTER 8/6/2014. so I should be storing this somewhere, apparently? i'm drinking a premature brew? is it veal? I guess i'll not refrigerate my other ones, then... but I cant say this is a ""100"" in anyway. too many other great stouts out there...."
""
""
"D: I must say I love the ""best after"" date on these big beers from Deschutes. similar to breweries that hold their big beers for conditioning before releasing, I like how these guys are doing it with a date on the bottle. I cannot believe the utter lack of booze heat on this thing. makes it dangerously drinkable. wish I was getting a tad more bourbon, but that is my only complaint. and it is more of a wish. seek."

"Mouth feel is the key to this beer. Every year is consistent with this gem. It blows away Parabola and Dark Lord. Deschutes in general is a very consistent beer and this one follows that line.Great mouth feel, nose and taste. I love this beer and cant wait every year when it comes out."

"Very dark brown-nearly black in colour, ring of tan head with some lace. Nose is well roasted, smoke, vanilla and oak, light coffee, a bit of sweetness and a bit of a tangy/cherry/wine notes as well. Taste is rich chocolate and roast, bourbon, oak, mild black forest cake, liquorice, a bit of coffee as well, vanilla and smoke in the aftertaste. Medium-light carbonation, full bodied. Awesome stuff, probably my favourite beer in a night full of incredible beers, would certainly like to have this again."
""
""
""
""
"2011 year Deschutes The Abyss, opened at a bit below cellar temps. Pours pitch black and smells quite nice coming out of the bottle. Half a finger of tan head that dissipates rather quickly. The taste on this beer is quite fascinating. It seems like I am catching a new flavor every sip. Up front are some bittersweet dark chocolate notes and perhaps some dried fruit, cherries it seems like. Mid-palate has a surge of espresso and charred oak coming on heavily. The after taste is a bit dry and bitter, almost like I had a few coffee beans that were lightly toasted. The bourbon is very well hidden but you definitely get the charred barrel characteristics and a touch of vanilla. Quite simply one of the best stouts I have ever had, and significantly better than the 2012 Bourbon County I just tried recently. We'll see how it stacks up the Bourbon County Rare when I pop that open for my birthday. Highly recommended, I'll be getting another bottle!"
""
""
"O: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easy, slightly filling, very strong kick, excellent representation of style, this is a very good big stout to drink for a long time."
"Abyss is one of my favorites, though I preferred the 2011 release. If you somehow find yourself a bottle of the '11, most of the above notes apply, but the licorice flavor comes off less, and there's more coffee taste on the finish. Both are exceptional, but personal preference will change how people feel one year to the next."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a deep inky black with a thin tan head. It looks quite nice, very much true to form for a RIS. Scents of rubbing alcohol, slight roast malt, faint hints of black coffee, some vinous wine, brown sugar, molasses and slight licorice. Very nice aroma. Deep, complex and strong. Taste begins with black coffee, rich roast malt, bittersweet cocoa and vanilla bean, with notes of oak, licorice, very faint hints of wine and hints of oak and bourbon in the background, especially as the beer warms. Finish and aftertaste are bitter, roasty and strong in black coffee. Very well done, balanced, yet assertive, aged, yet not dank. An excellent flavor. Mouthfeel is medium-thick bodied, sticky with a faint alcohol burn. Quite nice, very much a sipping beer. Overall this is another excellent, deep, complex Imperial Stout. It's strong, assertive and bold, yet balanced. Well worth drinking."

"Huge thick dense brown head on top of an opaque black colored beer. Head is long lasting and leaves great lacing. Aroma has malts, light roastedness, lightly alcohol and some liquors. Taste malts, roasted malts, liquorice, a hint of wood, lightly liquor, lightly alcohol, superb fitting long lingering roasted bitterness that reminds me of pure dark chocolate. Full body, medium perfectly suited carbonation."
""

"Early 2013 rating. Brewed with molasses and liquorice, that just sounds like a joke, apparently also 33 % was BA in oak and bourbon barrels. 2011 Vintage I believe? Best after 08/04/2012. 65 cl bottle sampled. Pours black with a reasonable mocha head. Nose is sweet and licorice heavy, smooth and well integrated, touch molasses, roasted malt, underlying sweetness and coffee, anise. Bitter black liquorice taste, bitter molasses, burned coffee, chocolate, pure chocolate, bitter coffee grounds, cacao. Full, very slick, everything is well integrated. Well done and I appreciate it even with the liquorice focus."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: Too young? Hard to say, but the roast quality is very taxing. The complexity is rewarding, but the balance is less than admirable. I'd like to visit some older vintages with more time on them to see how this beer evolves, but for a beer that is nearly a year old, it's a bit of a shame that it's this undeveloped."
""
""
"This one goes in the books as matching my preference perfectly for a stout. Will be buying and again many of these and can't wait to try my Dark Lord that is in route :) to compare these two beers. I have a feeling The Abyss will stand out above all."

"Thick, foamy sheets of lacing clinging to the glass adds to the initial appearance appeal. The melt-in-your mouth mouthfeel is incredibly satisfying. And then you come to the flavors! Oh, man!! All I can say is this monster is incredibly delightful to coat and swirl about your taste buds. All the components just come together perfectly, providing one immensely gratifying dark beer experience, one that few high ABV stouts or porters can deliver. An exceptional offering and an even more exceptional drinking experience. I look forward to opening up my 2012 release in the future..."

"2010-2011 batches, via bottle. This is where I stopped updating my notes. Time to sit back and enjoy. Other than Dark Lord, I’ve never kept notes for various vintages of the same beer, but I’m glad I did. I’ve shifted gears at this point, now that the price has crept up to $12.99+/bomber. I’ll buy one or two each year, usually on the trip back home for the holidays, but mainly I wait until I can get a fresh pour somewhere. This is easily one of my Top 5 beers and I’ll be darned if consolidating my notes hasn’t tempted me into a cellar raid for my only 2012 bottle."

"2012 vintage; jumping the gun by a month or so from the ""Best After"" date, but I wanted something significant for my 1500th review. Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours a very dark brown, appearing black in the glass; a half finger brown head with good retention and lacing.. Rich aroma of dark toasted malt, vanilla, chocolate, hints of dark dried fruit, a bit of ethanol. Flavor of toasted, lightly charred malt and charred coffee, vanilla, oak, dark dried fruit and dark cherry, finishing with chocolate and more charred malt, coffee and wood. Nice heavy body, comparable to a quality oatmeal stout. One of the world's great stouts, complex and flavorful. This vintage seems to have more char flavor than earlier ones, but there is enough hear to support it well. The alcohol noticed in the aroma is well covered in the taste by the other flavors. One of the earliest beer I ever wrote a review for, but it was not up to BA standards, simply ""Ecstasy, best beer I've ever had."" I have had some wonderful beer since then, but that is still not a bad succinct summary."

"Here's my problem with Abyss. It's a great stout, really. If I could go pick this off the shelf anytime for about 8-9$ a bomber, I gladly would. I just don't see why people go bat-shit nuts over this beer. I don't understand the 4.55 cumulative average (at this time of rating) for this beer. It's good, but c'mon people, it's not *that* good, and I certainly would never go through the hassle of trading just to get it. When it starts seeing year-round distro, then maybe I'll buy some more."

"O- The Abyss is always a solid stout, though for the life of me I don't understand why it's one of the highest rated beers on this entire site. I've had it fresh and aged, several times. It always drinks well and has a good amount of flavors but I always feel like it lacks something. As I said it's solid, but it never blows me away."

"Overall, I've enjoyed this beer over the years with some seeming to be better than others although it's probably me and when I've tasted vs. variability from year to year as I assume it's the same recipe. A big stout that is quite tasty and could pass for a 8% ABV beer. Would like it if it was a little more affordable and easier to get but one of those special beers you wait all year for."

"Overall, this is an impeccably well crafted and one of a kind beer. Not like any other stout I've had, and I've tried most of the famous big stouts. This may be the most complex of the big stouts I've had. There is so much going on, it's a wonder it works at all. I think the partial wine barrel aging is what brings this to that next level. With that said, this isn't my favorite. I prefer a more simple, straight bourbon aged stout. This also finishes a bit too bitter for me and the mouthfeel is a little light. This is a great beer though, and one that I will always buy a couple of every year. Worth the hype. Cheers!"
""

"Overall, one of the most complex and well balance Imperial Stouts I have ever had. Huge, rich flavor and an intoxicating aroma, not to mention it's gorgeous appearance. A world class beer fresh, can't wait to put some age on a couple bottles."

"After finishing this bottle, I can really see why it sits at the top of the top 250 list. The complexity of this beer is unmatched by any other russian imperial stout I've ever tasted, and that's really the shining point of this brew. It's not simply a BA stout, or vanilla RIS. It's a world class blend that is like none other. A must try."

"2010 (1/5/2013): Cracked this open the other night. This has already peaked way beyond this beer's aging potential. A phenomenal nose as always, with dusty oak notes, dark fruits, and chocolate syrup, but the flavor falls flat as a one dimensional cocoa forward imperial stout with a woody finish and not much else. Soy saucy at first, but mellows out a bit more over time. Still underwhelming - I wish I could have tried this vintage at its best. 3.75."

"OVERALL: Great stout, wonderful it is ""American"" but wish it was from the east coast. Tough to get here. It hit on all the classic, key marks it needed to. Not a lot of bourbon, but enough of it to add to the experience and not overwhelm the experience."

"22 oz bottle 2012. Pours solid blackish brown with a healthy espresso head. The aroma is top notch coming strongly from the tulip glass. Big coffee notes with vanilla, tart fruit, black licorice and subtle traces of bourbony goodness. The taste is complex with coffee, chocolate mousse, and sweet rock candy up front followed by oaky vanilla, graham cracker and a little heat from the bourbon. There’s beautiful bubbly lacing hanging about the glass. The palate offers a slightly syrupy texture with a good bit of carbonation to balance it. Awesome Imperial Stout!"

"Pours opaque black with a billowy tan head. The nose is coffee, chocolate liqueur, licorice, vanilla, chestnut, and bourbon. The flavor is almost as complex as the aroma with the bourbon, and Merlot being more muted than I expected, but not in a ""they’re almost undetectable"" sort of way. Rather, those flavors serve as underpinnings (in an almost catalyst-likemanner) that bring out the intensity of the more obvious esters like bitter chocolate, roast coffee, vanilla, licorice, toffee, chestnut, salt, and almost a smoky bacon quality. At first I thought the body was a tad thin to support such a dynamic flavor profile, but then I realized that if it were thicker, it would make the flavor almost too mouth coating and intense to be as drinkable as it is. I agree with the other reviewers who think this beer will be an aging marvel, but for me it is already an absolutely ideal imperial stout, which I find even more rounded and complex than Speedway, and even more remarkable for achieving its decidedly coffeeish flavor component without the actual addition of that ingredient. The finish is incredibly long, and the balance is wondrous for such a big brew. Wow!"

"o: very good beer that I'm glad I had the chance to try, but not one that I will seek out every year."

"This was The Abyss 2010, bought in February 2011 and aged until November as recommended on the bottle. Definitely living up to its name, the beer was black and quite opaque and a very dark brown head. It smelled like dark chocolate with a bit of coffee and nuts. Incredibly thick and the most velvety smooth beer I've ever had out of a bottle. I could taste alcohol, but just barely. Nicely carbonated. I think the aging mellowed it, as I had it again on tap this year and the carbonation and roasted flavors were much more intense and biting. It deserves to be aged."

"O: 5/5 Not perfect, not the nectar of the gods, but closer to perfection than 4.5. Vanilla and chocolate become more prominent as it warms and stretches for perfection. A true beast of an imperial stout, that could be perfect if it were aged for a year or two in 100% bourbon barrels or a mix of bourbon and rye, but the wine barrel lend an unwelcome tartness to the abyss. I will absolutely try this beer again. It's utterly delicious and among the best beers I've ever had to date (it was number 666 for me). 99/100"

"2012 Reserve Batch A: Nice thick head with solid lacing and good retention, obsidian black that blocks all light, a swirl of the glass indicates noticeable viscosity – 5.00, S: The smell is quite boozy and with loads of licorice, there is also a good deal of char/ash and a thick sweetness that resonates on the nose, reminds me of dark fruitcake, oak is detectable but not aggressive, in the depths of the beer I detect a slight melon - 4.50, T: For a monster of a beer this has a wonderfully smooth flow, very slight astringency, licorice and pureed raisin, a little burn from the alcohol but nothing offensive, lots of roasted malts and sharp bitter bakers chocolate – 4.5, M: Mild grittiness and delicate syrupiness – 4.5, D: Extremely drinkable for an 11.1% beer, I ignored the ‘Best After’ date of Nov 1, 2013 by several months which may have compromised the experience a bit, but overall this is an exceptional beer – 5.0"

"O: This was a disappointing beer. Smells good, tastes alright but the mouthfeel just makes it a mess. Surprising because this has been properly cellared at 55 degrees since purchased. Given the high praise though I'll give the benefit of the doubt. I'd definitely be willing to try it again to see if it was just a bad bottle."

"O - a huge disappointment, but it's my own damn fault. I really should have waited at least a year...at least I have another one to age."
"Big bold heavy flavor. Chocolate and wine. Interesting and enhanced by the silky creamy texture. Dry heavy alcohol, metallic aftertaste. Texture is very good. One to savor for sure. Great beer. The aftertaste is slightly offputting to me but not so much that it ruins it. This kind of reminds of a valentines day type beer, with the chocolate and wine."

"Overall: Good but not integrated enough. A bit too sweet and bourbon heavy. I should add a foot note that I prefer non BA beers to BA versions, but this one is sooo Bourbon Heavy it's a little off putting. Just wasn't integrated enough."
""
""
""
""
"Overall Impression: I was shocked that I didn’t like this more. I’ve been wanting to try this beer for a while. I have some 2010 and 2011 Vintages that I am still excited to try and feel like this might've just needed more time to condition. I drank the bottle 10 days after the '12 release. That said, I still think this is an above average beer, but I think my expectations exceeded what I got."
""
"O: Could this beer be better? I don't think so. It's got everything you could aske for in an imperial stout and all the tastes and smells are delicately integrated and balanced. This is the first beer I am willing to give straight A's! I went into the abyss and came back a changed man, an enlightened man."

"2011 batch poured into a Hardywood GBS snifter. I have to admit this review is a bit bias, I am somewhat new to the game of aging beers (abt 2 years) I have tried some hyped beers and I am cellaring others, other than a 2009 Stone IRS which I just opened this past christmas, this is the first hyped beer that I've had that has been aged properly, about 15 months. Pours a dense black, i've seen worse reading some of the ratings i've read, with a very thin lacing. On the nose you pick up different notes each sniff, caramel, coffee, oak, toffee, chocolate, licorice. I take my first sip and i'm done. This is one of the most smooth, complex imperial stouts i have ever tasted. I am not worthy, one of the best beers I've ever had, going to drink the rest of this in peace. Cheers"

"Overall can be placed with heavy hitter stouts but will fall last in line."
"Picked this up in a great trade with Mar02x! Pitch black pour with a beautiful two finger caramel colored head with decent retention and nice lacing. The nose is dark and roasty mocha initially and opens up nicely with big vinous notes and hints of licorice, black cherries, booze, vanilla and coffee. The taste is just as bold and complex with lots of wood and roasty dark chocolate along with hints of burnt coffee, molasses, licorice, oak, leather, black cherries, and vanilla. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a ton of vinous character and a great bitter warming booze burn on the finish. Overall, I really like how the wine barrel aging emerged and really gave it a unique character that makes it stand out from many of the other big barrel aged stouts. Thanks Mark!"

"2012 Reserve popped in the first week of December of the same year. Says ""Best After 11/1/13"" but screw it! Pours black with big brown creamy head. Hangs around for a bit with lots of lacing. Aroma of chocolate, roasted grains, molasses, hints of black licorice, and dark fruits. Don’t get any bourbon or vanilla on the nose, but still smells very nice. Interesting flavor. Strong roasted flavor with seriously bittersweet chocolate. Alcohol warmth on the finish. I do get a bit of the barrel addition, but it is very subtle. Solid stout, but was hoping for a bit more vanilla/chocolate/molasses. Will have to grab another one to mature and see how that helps it."

The oak-wine elements are perfectly sweet."

"*8 months later, Raul had this again as his palate has matured like an Olson Twin's bank account when she hit 18. Flavor was more robust, but still hot. Mouth feel was a lot richer (almost more than Ashley Olsen) and the nose was more refined than an OC housewife rhinoplasty. Raul agrees, but there is better."

"O - intensely flavorful and complex. I am aging another bottle and will compare tasting notes. I'm expecting it to only get better with age."

"Overall, the Abyss is shallower than its advertised depth and considering the hype fails to impress. Not infected, just average."
"O: tasted a 2010, 2011, and 2012 vertical tonight and was not impressed. This was somewhere between hunahpu's and stone IRS, but I had higher expectations due to the rating. Thought 2011 was the best vintage of the 3, and 2012 was no doubt not ready. In the future I will adhere to their best after dates."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a 2012 vintage and I am hoping some age on this will mellow it out. There is some boozy hotness to this and some coffee. Very roasty malts are also present. Other than that this was a very underwhelming beer. I had big hopes for this but I don't think it is even in the same league as some of the other big stouts fresh. Since the bottle says best after next year I will revisit this review then to see how things have changed."
""

"O- an awesome sipper. The cherry bark gives it a unique aroma/flavor, there's really no hint of bourbon and the alcohol is fairly tame and complements the flavor nicely. I was hoping for a creamy mouthfeel but i got oily. Still a great brew and i'm glad i have another to age."

"D - I always have grouped this together with Dark Lord and Darkness (and perhaps Kate the Great as well). Of those main three, this is right in the middle for overall impressions. It's enjoyable, but I'm unsure how memorable this will be."
"This is really like staring into the abyss of night. No light escapes it, even against the light. There is a little head, densely packed in tiny bubbles around the glass. Lots of licorice and chocolate: milk and dark. Oak aroma is sweet and far from abrasive. Some vanilla notes accompany the smooth alcohol aroma. The flavor washes in slowly: licorice, lots of molasses richness, and slight alcohol burn to remind me of what I'm drinking. Some bakers chocolate and slight vanilla with a tinge of oak burn. Finish is super dry and body is full. This is a rich ass beer that is great for special occasions: like brewing a winter brown."
""
"O: wonderful. Like obsidian on steroids in all the best ways. Worth the $18 I paid for the bottle."
"Pours black with a nice mocha head and good lacing.Big notes of chocolate, some roastiness, and a touch of some oak, Flavor was roasty with some licorice and sweeter chocolate at the get go, maybe even a little dark fruit, which then t transitions nicely into some dark, bitter chocolate with with some wonderful charred malt and the vanilla from the bark hiding out underneath. Honestly, I am not getting too much of the barrels in this, but that's okay, still delicious. A fuller, creamy mouthfeel. Some alcohol is noticeable in the finish, which is to be expected from such a high ABV and ""fresh"" beer. Overall, a wonderful, wonderful beer. I have a huge beer boner for their Red Chair and that remains #1 from Deschutes for me, but this is hands down #2."

"O Very intense smelling and tasting beer. Would most likely taste a lot better with age. Has a tightness to it that needs to be smoothed out. But def a repeat. Nice big body stout indeed."

"ROUND 2: Drank second 2012 bottle on April 20th 2014, having aged it for a year and a half. Overall: This is a good stout but in my opinion since having the first bottle I've tried many more r.i.s. that are much better, cheaper and much, much easier to find. this one is not worth the price and effort it takes to hunt it down, if you can find one randomly sitting on a shelf for around 15 bucks or cheaper and you've never had it, I'd say go for it just to have the experience but I wouldn't run through hoops to get this one again, nor would I recommend doing so."
"Overall this is a beer that is meant to age in my opinion. I have sampled freshed bottled that are too acrid, roasty and biting because of the licorice, dark roasted malts, oak, etc but really develops into a masterpiece after 3-4 years. They have that best after date for a reason on these bottles folks, you would think the brewery would know best..."
"Glad I stocked up while I could and have a supplier who can send to me from PDX, because this is amazing!"

"This 2011 bottle was loaded with depth and well balanced and most importantly, tremendously tasty."

"O. A good beer, get it while you can. I will cellar one and review again."
"Overall: From what I've read this should have completely blown me away. Now don't get me wrong I really liked this beer but I must admit I wasn't blown away."
"O: just an outstanding brew. its very bold in favors and is extremely well balanced. i only wish there was a bit more dark fruits or vanilla sweetness that came out in this one. but overall, this one is well deserving of the hype. definitely an outstanding brew."

"My last bottle of the 08 vintage. It sings. Delicately layered chocolate, bourbon, roast, dark caramel and some mission figs. The palate is still stunning, after all these years. Smooth as silk with a velvety heft, the blend of flavors is sublime. Truly exceptional. 4.5/4.5/5"
"O: This isn't the first time I've had this beer, I've had it numerous times on tap and a handful of vintages from the bottle, but this is the first time I've actually taken some time to myself to sit down, really think about, and review the beer. I can definitely say that age greatly helps this beer. I had a taste of an 09 bottle recently and it was awesome. Fresh it's kind of all over the place, not bad by any means, but this beer really should be given some time to develop. I guess there's a reason the bottle says best after 11/1/03. I've got another bottle to save, so I'll revisit this beer in a year or so and see how it changes."
""
"The beer pours a jet black with a dense tan head that laces. There isn't oily residue, but the head does stick to the sides nicely. The nose is oaky with a touch of bitter sweet chocolate bread and alcohol. The beer drinks smoothly, masking the staggering abv with velvety sweetness and a lingering charcoal bitterness. The beer steamrolls the palate with flavor leaving residual bits of potent stout behind to keep me satiated after each sip. It's a lovely beer and worth the money, although I've been told the 2010 is slightly better..."

With a beer this big, I like a bit of depth in the feel. This one delivers. Heavy full-mouth with ample carbonation to back it up. Rich, velvety feel with an easy finish. There’s so much going on in this beer, it’s hard to stay focused. The vanilla makes a showing, but it is fleeting at best. The sweetness instead comes from the semi-sweet chocolate and toffee character."

""
"O – I am usually disappointed in heavy hype beers but not this one. Its in my favorite style so Im sure I am biased but this is a wonderfully full flavored and complex brew. It is so well balanced and a very easy drinker. I enjoyed every sip and it got better as it warmed."

"Overall- A world class beer worthy of its Rep. I would buy this again and again."

"D-very good beer, big flavors and quite a big body. The oak aging isn't really noticeable here, just ever so slightly. Nice roasted malts, the molasses is quite dominant. Ever so faint hints of alcohol and some warming in the back."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"D - I was pleasantly surprised a 6-year old stout held up this well. I prefer the sweeter flavors of the newer vintage but I suspect that's due to age and not a recipe difference. Unlike some other breweries, Deschutes appears to have done a really good job keeping the quality up even as the batch size has grown over the years. Not a beer I find myself craving, but always enjoyable and easy to drink - an Imperial Stout that appeals to a broad range of palates."
""
""
"Appearance is black with a short head that is mocha in color. This imperial stout has a nose with oak, chocolate, roasted malts, molasses and bourbon. It has a taste with more chocolate, some of that bourbon, more roasted malts. Mouthfeel is towards heavy, a creamy texture, but plenty of alcohol present in it. It is a very good beer, but it is potent, so it is best to sip and savor it."

"This beers looks amazing, smells great but for the second year disappoints. The flavors do not mesh well for me. Complex? Yes, but it's not a flavor profile I care for. I love imperial stouts but don't see myself buying this again unless it's to trade. Not worth the money."

"Vintage 2010: This poured out as a deep jet black oily looking brew, it forms a nice even sized brown head on top. The lacing is scattered and and has a light amount of retention. The smell of this beer is loaded with dark malts and some herbal notes. In the mix there is also a good amount of barrel aged aromas coming off of this one as well. The taste was really nice, sweet bourbon-like notes with some fresh oak in there too, there is also plenty of smoked and chocolate flavors in there. The mouthfeel is thick and oily, very smooth and highly drinkable. Overall I was hoping to get more of the Licorice flavors from it but regardless it's a killer brew. Very enjoyable."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the flavoring. The char is outrageous!! This aspect really sets up for a unique malt base for the buttery, toasty bourbon, and the wildly sweet raw and milk chocolates. These all mix for a completely new flavoring that is so complex and gorgeous. The mouthfeel is sticky and inviting, giving you just one more reason to go in for another sip. We were looking high and low for the licorice throughout, but we were never able to pin it down in the nose, and only mildly on the back of the flavoring with black pepper and booze. Regardless, this is a dark, gritty, bold beer that everyone should try at least once."

The nose is rich and sweet with plenty of vanilla, oak, chocolate, charred toast. Really nice. With a beer this big, I like a bit of depth in the feel. This one delivers. Heavy full-mouth with ample carbonation to back it up. Rich, velvety feel with an easy finish. There's so much going on in this beer, it's hard to stay focused. The vanilla makes a showing, but it is fleeting at best. The sweetness instead comes from the semi-sweet chocolate and toffee character. With such a small percentage of this seeing the bourbon barrels, I'm not surprised that that is downplayed as well. Mild spiciness on the back end, and a slight tart kick to finish this one out. Fantastic beer. One I was glad to trade for, and one I will hunt down again."

"Abyss is one of the absolute best off-the-shelf RIS made anywhere. It's remarkable that they can produce so much of it without sacrificing quality ('09 be damned!). Undoubtedly a highlight of every future November. Cheers!"

"I was immediately struck by its dark, almost black appearance. Regal-like, in fact. I poured it into a chalice-like glass and observed a moderate lacing that lasted. The smell was pleasant but not overwhelming, and the taste was as rich as it looked. I wasn't overwhelmed with a strong licorice taste (as I had feared). Instead, a touch of oak and a sweet caramel-molasses taste dominated. I loved the opportunity to try this masterpiece!"

"Overall: Age benefits this beer. That doesn't mean it's anything less than stellar when it's young. Great depth and balance. Not as beefy as others in the class."
"This is a really great beer, but it hurts a bit for drinkability. I split this bottle with a group of friends, and had about a 5oz pour. That was enough for me. Still, a solid offering and one I will definitely be looking to try again in the future."

"This is a great beer. I'm sure it gets even smoother and more complex with age, but you really ought to give it a taste if you have some in your possession. A stellar imperial stout!"

"This carries some good chocolate tones with this and what seems like clear barrel aging. The detractor is the boozy tones; and they're quite evident here. I was wondering what year's release this was, but it's gotta be the 2011 since it's so hot. Clearly shows how age can mellow beers into being excellent brews."

"O: Deceptively big imperial stout. I've had weaker beers that feel like they're twice as strong. Flavors are complex, varied and well balanced. Flavors stand out and are quite sharp as previously noted. Overall a great stout, up there with some of the best. With some more age and some mellowing it could become incredible. The label DOES state, best AFTER 8/12."

"The beer is black as night with very little brown head that immediately disappeared without any traces. I smell lots of fruits along with the roasted malts. It is sweet and fruity with roasted malts and licorice. The beer is think and viscous with almost no carbonation. The alcohol is very well hidden. This is a great beer and all of the complex flavors have meshed with time producing a fantastic beer. I love that they put a best after date on the bottle. I would like to try a fresh bottle just to see how it changes over time but I can’t imagine that it is better fresh than it is now."

"the 13th highest rated beer on BA huh? cool! had the pleasure to try a 2009 vintage side by side with a 2010 (lucky me, i know). the 09 was slightly lacto infected and so off just a bit, but smooth and rich and decadent and one of a kind, but ths review will be for the 2010 vintage. it pours an absolutely black abyssal color (hehe) with a fairly good size mocha head for a 2 year old beer on oak. doesnt let a lick of light through. smells insane. mental. especially as it warms here. smells really really dark malty roast. some espresso notes, fruity pipe tobacco, raisins, bourbon, old oak, and plenty of alcohol. wow. flavor is spicy up front, with notes of licorice and black pepper even. it mellows to a quick second of something sweet, but it isnt the molasses. i cant place it, and im drinking it too fast trying to figure it out, so for now suffice it to say a dark fruity sweetness, but just for a moment. maybe pruple grape even, like jolly ranchers, but not artificial. i just dont know. then comes the bourbon woody vibes. bigtime. the complexity here is through the roof. feel is deadset perfect. perfect. it starts sharp and strong, with a foamy rising expansion in the mouth thats like a whispy cloud passing quickly by. it feels so light because of this, airy even, but the body upon close assessment is not as heavy as you might think. scarily drinkable. it winds down with a very smooth alcohol burn, like a very fine glass of scotch at room temperature. aftertaste is espresso and oak and booze. im amazed how the carbonation still is active after 2 years and a some time on wood. mellow, but certain. overall im not sure this is the 13th best beer in the world, but i am confident its the best imperial stout ive ever had, and im not sure what i would change about it. the sex appeal here is massive. a wonderful bottle of beer, and i will look forward to my next. i will relent and say it is indeed worth the hype!"

"2011 vintage tap pourned in snifter, the sun could not penetrate its deep brown blackness! Nice dark brown head which subsided leaving bits of lacing. Amazing mouthfeel, molasses & chocolate hit you immediately, hints of smokey vanilla, cherry oak, and pinot barrell goodness come in. A delicate flavor indeed, no sign of its 11%ABV 1.10 OG, a very well rounded stout. Quite a process to create this beauty after speaking with Joey and Robin from Deschutes. A must try!!"

"2010 Bottle Cellered till 4-6-12. Poured a Pitch black color,with a dark brown head. A complex aroma of dark malts, chocolate, coffee, liquorice and Dark fruit, also some oaky/Boozy notes. The flavor has notes of heavily roasted malts, balanced by a suitable sweetness, coffee and liquorice. somewhat dry finish. Perfect balance, not too sweet, just the right amount of bitterness. Medium to full bodied and the Alcohol was almost not detected. Damn near perfect."
""
""
"O: Good, but slightly disappointing as I was expecting greatness. The mouthfeel and finish on this are just somewhat off. I really liked the dark fruit qualities in this stout, but was surprised and put off by a finish with too much coffee, oak, and maybe even hop. Huh."

"So,,, after having 2010 vintage about 8 months ago, I was able to obtain several more vintage bottles and most importantly, fresh 2012 bottles. I have to say that fresh bottle is quite good, but it's... kind of... all of the place. I taste more dark fruits but I get too much hops and booze. What I didn't get much of was the barrel characteristics - not much vanilla, oak, bourbon, etc. I recently had 2011 bottle and it tasted closer (but worse) to the 2010 bottles reviewed above. I will update this review again after I open 2007 and 2008 bottles as well as 2012 bottles years down the road. Fresh, I much (much) preferred 2012 Parabola over 2012 Abyss. Aged, 2010 Abyss was better than 2011 Parabola by a noticeable margin."

"Beer pours a dark brown/black with a thin tan head. Aroma is a nice mellow roast with hints of chocolate and oak. Flavor is nice, but it doesn't quite live up to the hype, it has a nice mellow roasty flavor, but I don't understand why everyone goes crazy about it. Mouthfeel is full bodied and very nice.

"i had it in seattle at full throttle bottles. it was not served in the correct glass so i felt the color was a little light. it had a great balance of hops and was very intricate! it was refreshing in every way. the smell was floral and sweet and it hit the spot head on! i would reccomend this stout to anyone who isn't affraid to try something juuuust a little different!...."
"overall this one lives up to the hype. i've fallen into the abyss and there is no coming back. i love the layered complexity, i love the overall character, and i love the feel of this monster stout. it's a bit hot, but time will tame it. about perfect as far as i'm concerned."

"1400th review! 22 ounce bottle into snifter; 2011 vintage, best after 8/4/2012. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark tan head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass; looks awesome. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, cherry, oak, light char, coffee, cocoa, molasses, caramel, toffee, vanilla, licorice, toast, and roasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with big complexity of dark malt, oak, and barrel character; and extremely balanced. Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, molasses, light char, cherry, oak, toast, toffee, vanilla, cocoa, licorice, light smoke, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, molasses, light char, cocoa, oak, licorice, light smoke, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic depth and complexity of dark malt flavors with the barrel character and flavor additions; with a fantastic overall balance of all flavors; and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic blended imperial stout! Huge depth and complexity of flavors with incredible balance; and very smooth to sip on. An extremely enjoyable offering to sip on slowly."
"O: This is a nice beer. It's a sweet one and the licorice plays a more central role than I expected, but it works. A great beer and one I look forward to having again in the future!"

"The Abyss pours a dark brown color w/ a two finger chocolate head. Excellent lacing on my New Belgium glass. The nose is oak, vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and molasses. Very mellow and balanced. None of the 11% abv evident at all. The taste is really smooth and balanced- with coffee and oak out in front. Again, none of the alcohol is present in the taste. Feel is medium full, w/ a nice hops bite on the aftertaste. Overall, really happy I finally got to try this beer. Cheers!"

"O. A great beer. This is really a beer that tastes it's best around 55 degrees. It's not nearly as good when cold. Lots of bold flavors in a thick and hearty drink. A great beer that gets even better with age. And really hard to beat at $13/bottle. Worth searching out."
""

"This is a big, bad stout; full and robust flavors. A tad on the sweet side compared to its brethren, but nothing cloying or overwhelming."
""
"I've never given a beer a 5 before, but while consuming the Abyss, I wondered: how could this beer improve at all? The answer was: I don't know, in my eyes it can't. From the unbelievably complex nose, to its amazing depth and best-in-class balance of bold flavors, I would put this stout as the finest I have had. Absolutely seek this one out."

""

"Overall: Really like this one. I'm not sure I agree that it's #14 in the world (its current ranking), but it is an excellent beer. I'm partial to KBS, but eager to sample my aged bottle in several months..."

"The only thing that I'm curious about is whether this peaks in a year, and not two. Never had a fresher version. The slight acidity was a plus, but unexpected (at least, to say, that I don't remember reading about it in past reviews). No particular feature of this beer detracted from the overall experience of imbibing it. Love the style, and this one's incredibly balanced, distinct, and now easily recognizable. Will do what I can to land myself more bottles."

"a double with intense bittering hops. warrior possible that dry but mineral dry also. this beer has latitude with all the minimal contracting palate qualities but fundamental form. the bourbon hints best at cellar temperature. bitterness is actually quite dominant. nose is a bit booze and roasted with a bit of malt of bourbon. roasted coffee notes, hop dry, vanilla subtle. very subtle... but to say that this beer hides abv because of bourbon aging... or wood aging and hopping would be the primary grace. wouldn't say that there is a huge dynamic blend of flavors. for something so sought after it is its rather well made... but heavy handed in the subtle notes."
""
""
""
""
"O - Quite simple the best Imperial Stout and one of the best beers I have ever had. Enough said."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very nice imperial stout. Not the best that I've had, but certainly a special beer. I think another year of aging would have been good on this, as it was stil quite hot after a year in the fridge."
"In a growler from Chuck’s 85th Market, 2011 vintage. Pours a nice head. Two finger, tan head. Completely black. Aroma was so inviting. Chocolate, strong coffee, vanilla, so much going on, this was amazing. Taste is incredible. Chocolate, coffee, vanilla, molasses, caramel...so many sweet flavors and yet they still have the powerful flavors of a regular imperial stout. Says it is best aged, and it does get better, but it's also drinkable fresh. Mouthfeel goes down so easy, still very carbonated, but I can tell that this becomes better with age. Very viscous, and lingers well. This is incredibly drinkable. This is still easily in my top 3 of all time. Delicious, drinkable (and completely masking an 11 percent), and the favorite style of beer on this sight. I know this is a Winter Seasonal, and hard to get, but this is an amazing beer. Great great great imperial stout, everyone should try this at some point."
"Poured this one into my Brooklyn snifter and it is very deep in color and the head lingers for a good while. The nose is huge with toasted grains, dark chocolate and bit of burnt sugar. The tastes follows the nose but has a bit more of dark chocolate bite at the end. The sweetness is not over powering and seems to even out after the first sip washes over your tongue. I really enjoy the dryness on the aftertaste and at this point is pretty drinkable for the alc%. This is the 2011 version so it is still young but wanted to try now and again after the ""best after"" date."
"Very nice big, dark stout. Opened a 2010 vintage on 1-27-12. I had a full bottle that was slightly chilled to about 50 degrees or so. Smell and tastes are deep. Taste really opened up as it warmed. Deep licorice tastes, really nice. A little pricey for what the market is currently bringing on this, but overall a really, really nice BAS (barrel aged stout)!"
"O: Tasted for dessert with a home-made brownie after a huge, massive dinner. This exceptional beer has been the icing on the cake of this evening."
""
""
"Not for the faint of heart - this is a heavy drinker - one of the bigger Impy Stouts I've had. Some pepper on the tongue through the carbonation. A beer you can really drown into. A bottle will do you for the night though."
"One of the best!"
"Pours the deep, viscous, black that I love in a good stout. Pour produces a surprisingly large brown sugar head that leaves some thin lacing as well as a thin cap. So much going on in the nose I really can't pick everything. What I can pick up is roasted malts, cocoa, and alcohol. Taste is a roasty, almost charred, flavor up front with molasses with a smooth milk chocolate finish. Also some faint licorice and hop notes throughout. Definitely full bodied with a clean finish, somehow feels a bit thinner than it is. A great brew, glad I hung onto it as long as I did, but now I'm sad I only have one."

"2011 reserve from a 1pt 6oz brown bottle with black wax on top, offered by Julien and Pierre-Luc. A young beer that is best after 8/4/2012. Thick dark black-brown ale with a nice brown head. A very complex empiromatic nose with some coffee, vanilla (oak), nice smokiness and balsamic vinegar. This ale is long, round and velvety. It's easy to find tobaco, coffee, smoke and a hop finale that taste like dust. The rostiness of the malt brings out good flavor. Not an easy drinking beer, it's a sipping beer to share with friends."

"I had four botles of this and every year I have cracked one sadly this was the last '08 but I would have to say every year this beer has gotten better and better with age. Now I am going to cry a little bit that I don't have any left in my cellar."

"All in all, this is still a fantastic beer but logic tells me that the recipe has changed... Can this even be the case? Oak and wine are much more prevalent whereas fruitiness is mostly absent. It'll be nice to do a vertical soon."

"O: A very good Imperial Stout. '09 wasn't as bad as I was expecting it to be - only slightly off, but really still quite drinkable. The '10 was the best of the bunch while the '11 needs to sit for a while to let the rough edges smooth out."
"O: I love this beer; this is what every big stout should strive to be"

"In the mouth there is an initial sour/sweet taste followed by heavy chocolate notes finishing with sweetness and a slight hop bitter bite. This tastes like a chocolate barleywine to me. The sweet/sour makes it very juicy. This is one tasty stout!"

It is definitely well crafted and beautifully put together. If you see it buy it, you will thank me later flavor so potent that it hugs your cheeks. Salud!"

"I am so glad I've built up a stash of the '10 and '11 to savor over time. Clearly one of the great beers."

"This is black and thick with a super thin brown scummy lookin' ""head."" Smells like dark chocolate, coffee, a bit of leather, toasty grains, brown sugar, and a touch of tobacco. There aren't really any hops in the nose. Reminds me of an old oak cabin. The taste follows the nose with molasses up front, a nice balancing bitterness without any herbal hop flavors, and some extra black licorice in the background. I can't believe how well the booze is masked! This beer basically tastes like an old fashioned candy store tour; licorice, molasses, bitter chocolate, vanilla, and some stale coffee... no sugar or butter in sight : ) Sticky, thick, and somehow still dry without being astringent or burnt. This is amazingly smooth. I reckon anyone could get into this beer... there are none of the burnt, raisiny, sugary, boozy, or overly oaky flavors that non-stout drinkers usually poo-poo in stouts."

"My recent trip out to Arizona provided some new beers in the cellar and my first chance to try Abyss, and even better on tap. Thanks to Manny for bringing me by a rather wonderful Whole Foods in Chandler. I had a 12oz. pour in a wonderful looking goblet and from first sight I was impressed. It was very brown almost black with a delcious looking and smelling short tan head that stuck around. It was malty, sweet, and just a bit hot; all in very good ways. Each sip was delicious and it wnet quite well with the sushi I had. Vanilla, chocolate and dark fruits were the predominant flavors along with a bit of Oak. Very nice mouthfeel, but it could have been a bit heavier and the bottled version might be just that. This is gonna be one I keep eyes out for in the future, because it is just that good."
""
"This is a Great barrel aged Stout no doubt, but with that said, I drank this side by side with the parabola from Firestone and it fell a little short. It felt a bit less smooth and less complexed and refined, but hey thats like complaining about BMW because Mercedes Benz is better. This is a Top Ten Stout/Porter!"
""
"O: The name says it all. You are staring down the deepest ends of the universe. Don't expect a straightforward beer. Intense Belgian cocoa, tobacco, wood bark, and hints of burnt toffee seal this amazing beer out. A..."

"O - I think I prefer sweet to roasty/savory, but this was a very delicious and complex beer. Glad I traded for this one. Great stuff!"

"D: As part of the infected batch, this clearly isn't what it's supposed to smell or taste like, but I thought it would be interesting to review anyway. And it was still enjoyable enough to drink my glass...similar to Le Coq. It still looked great, and had great body, and there were definitely signs of this being a great stout under all the unintended sourness. Now I really want to try a good bottle of this legendary beer."
""
"Conclusion: As expected, this is an awesome beer. It has so much flavor that it is walking the line between complex and muddled. I like it quite a bit, but find myself straying back the the purist mindset of doing little to a beer save for aging it in oak. However, this beer is doing something awesome and should be tried by anybody who has an interest in American beer or big dark beers of any sort."

"O - Wonderful beer to celebrate a wonderful 2011 and looking forward to a great 2012. This vintage is still quite young and am sure it will just get better with age."
""
""
""
"O: Wow! I love how the different flavors come to you in stages from the wood to the soy sauce then the chocolate. Reminds me of the gum that violet ate in willy wonka. The aging has really mellowed this beer out nicely. Top 3 imp. stout in my opinion."
""
"My personal ranking of the vintages would be 07; 08,10(tied); 11. Leaving the 09 out since that will vary substantially on whether and how infected a given bottle is. (FWIW, a bottle I opened a month ago was completely un-infected.)"
""
""
"Worth the hype. Chocolate, licorice, sweet, bitter, everything it ought to be."

""
"D and O: Sooo, what does the 33% that is straight from the wood taste like is what I want to know? This is a tasty brew, 3rd bottle I have sampled, but never appreciated it until now. Thought it was a good moment for a formal review. Very well balanced, and I do enjoy the licorice for a bit of drying and bitterness."

"O: Well this is damn good. Very complex and the mouthfeel is spot on for the style. I've got a 2011 waiting in the wings for another special occasion."
"Overall: I got 3 bottles of 2010 vintage from a friend last year at Christmas. Had a terrible cold last year during the tasting and could not do this awesome beer justice. I was 100% this year and loved it! Even my brother in law, who is not a stout fan, said it was one of the best beers he has ever had! It definently lives up to all the hype."
""
""
""
"This is such an interesting and complex beer but smooth and not too harsh in any way. Great all around."
"This was a very smooth stout that I would drink over and over. I would say hands down the best from this brewery. Get you some."
""
""
""
"O: This is as close to beer nirvana as you can get. Truly an American classic and a definite yearly get IMO."
"O: This beer certainly deserves the hype and is nearly perfect. Having had the 09 and 10 vintages last week at a tasting, I'd say this falls between the two...2010 being the best. Excellent beer that I look forward to having again."
""
""
"As good a stout as can be without being the best. It has all the great qualities one would hope for in a premium Imperial stout, just a hair too much licorice flavor for me to call it my favorite."
"22 oz bomber poured into tulip glass"
"Lacing clings nicely to glass"
""
"I could taste some dark fruit, but cherry really came out with light coffe and chocolate hints. I really milked the pour to allow other flavors to come out as it warmed up- and was not dissapointed. I was expecting quite a bit going in and was very satisfied."
""
""
""
""
""
"4-O- Very good RIS. Molasses isn't overly bitter, and has no bourb"
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, a fantastic brew. Nice on the nose, with a great palate profile. Plus it only gets better as it warms. A+ for the finest imperial stout I have had to date."
""
""
""
"O-A very good beer. Not as much chocolate as you would think but the cherry and wine finish nice. Good balance and complex flavors finsh easily and make a nice finish. Draw is sweet with a stale and bitter end. A really good beer"

"D - What can I say? Love at first sight, taste and feel; fantastic beer; one of my all-time favorites in my young beer drinking career; dessert in a glass; you can smell and taste each ingredient, unique, and well thought out; doesn't get much better than this"

"O- Defanitly great. This years abyss does not disappoint. Has all the characteristics of a great beer."

""
"Well done Deschutes and Thank you Marc!"
"One of the most enjoyable of the imperial/barreled style that I have had. Great smell and taste without being a burden to drink."
""
""
""
""
"O: A wonderful, wonderful beer. For an 11% imperial stout I can drink it and drink it and drink it. It's simply beautiful. Any lover of porters or stouts should try this."
""
"O - I had this infected before, and it was still good, but this is fantastic. Much more chocolate than I was anticipating, not as much bourbon, but still fantastic."

""
"This was hear for Philly Beer Week and I wish we got it on a regular basis, hopefully soon. If I could get this and Black Butte, I would be totally happy."
""
"O: This is still one of the best stouts out there 3 years later. I'm glad to see it hasn't gone down hill while sitting in my cellar and more thankful that this was a present. Now if only I can get some of the 2011 vintage."
"Another top notch year for The Abyss. Probably my favorite after the aged '09."

"2011 vintage: Opening this three years on (2014), it’s very dry and a lot of roastiness and cocoa come through.  Decent enough, I guess.  No signs of oxidation, but not a lot of complexity in the flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great mouthfeel, good boozy profile. An excellent dessert beer."
""
""
"Bottle. 2011 vintage. I’ve had Abyss multiple times but I’ve never sat down and really rated it before. I tried with the 09 but that was a huge, infected fail. Moving on... Pours a deep, dark brown color with a nice mocha tan 2 finger head. Head leaves nice lace as it settles down in the glass. Dark chocolate, coffee, mocha, vanilla, it smells nice and rich. Medium mouthfeel, velvety. Smooth sweet upfront with a nice roast coffee and dark chocolate back end. Lingering bitterness. The oak is there but to me is pretty subdued. A nicely balanced, solid beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Solid A grade for this one. I've looked forward to it for a LONG time and it completely lived up to the hype train. Lots of deep flavors but none of them over power the beer at all. Flat our superb beer."
""
""
""
""
"Reminds me of Rocky Road ice cream."
"This is an incredible beer, lives up to the hype, like to get my hands on some more of these."
""
""
""
""
"Well worth the hype and justifies the premium cost. The best fresh RIS, and top 3 of all RISes I've ever had."
"O: This beer was good but not great when served cold. This beer is best served at room temperature so be sure to do so. Well worth the cost."

"O: I opened a bottle of 2009 4 months ago..so my perception is slighty skewed, that given, aging is of the essence, as with prior years. The fresh potential of the 2011 rivals that of the 2008 and 2010 vintages."
"On tap at the Beachcomber in Florence, Oregon. As good, if not better than I remember. All the other reviews say it all -- who am I to try to describe it better? OK, I have to get the 250 words -- Nice medium brown, lingering head; the aroma of malt and whisky hits you even before you quaff it. And it did not taste like river rocks. If you're only having one -- this is it, and at 11% in an Imperial Pint you better ride the Rhody Express home."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very light carbonation -- almost no head on pouring, but the sparkle is there on sipping. I could go on and on about the wonderful aroma and big molasses and chocolate flavor, but I'll focus instead on that mouthfeel. For me, it doesn't get better than a big strong stout with serious body but a truly refreshing feel. ""Thin"" is usually a pejorative, but this had no hint of the stickiness found in a young version of the same or Stoic -- it just flows in a really magical way. Very impressed -- it's drinking fantastically right now and I truffle to imagine improvement with age. Open now!"
"Definitely worth waiting to open my last bottle. This beer has really evolved since its release."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This definitely lived up to the hype for me. It was so delicious! Thanks to Sweetwillyrolbar for this one!"
""
"I had this both on nitro and regular taps. Nitro definitely brought forward the chocolate and added a wonderful creamy nitro mouthfeel. However, the regular Abyss is still the favorite with all the complex layered flavors of chocolate, licorice, bourbon and oak that shine through more than on the nitro tap."
""
"A well-balanced great brew from Deschutes, and the alcohol is well hidden. Definitely worth seeking out if you can find some."
""
""

""
""
"This was hear for Philly Beer Week and I wish we got it on a regular basis, hopefully soon. If I could get this and Black Butte, I would be totally happy."
""
""
"Overall this is a great vintage that will age well, It wasn't as good as the 08 I had that was 3 years old but I think that the 11 is off to a great start."
"What can I say. A fantastic, top-tier imp stout. Next year I'll buy one to share, and one just for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is one of the best beers I've ever had. Definitely a sipper as it has an extremely comlpex flavor and the longest aftertaste of all time. I can't wait to try it after the ""best after"" date. In the meantime I must obtain more bottles!"
""
"O: This may be the finest beer I've ever had. The problem I have with most oak aged beers is that it tends to dominate the entire profile of the beer. According to the label this beer was blended from 4 batches! I would have loved to been there when they figured out the ratios, because they nailed it. No single flavor overpowers the next. Here is a perfect example of a truly complex beer where it is evident that everyone involved is passionate about what they do. I want more. Much, much more."
"O- Unbelievable! The 2010 bottle I have left will definitely be remaining in my cellar for a few more years. I had this immediately after a pour of 2010 and this was leaps and bounds beyond the 2010 (and the 2010 was incredible)."
""
""
""
"D/O- Delicious chocolatey goodness shared with my girlfriend! Very smooth, a real treat. The Abyss deserves every accolade it receives."
""
""
""
"2013 Abyss sampled at the brewpub in the PDX pearl. Really like the 2013 fresh, as it tastes like Deschutes has dialed back the hops a bit, with the beer showing a bit more richness and creaminess on the palate. This still comes across as a big beer, but there are some attrative nuances of wine and dark fruits (not sour) that seemed to mingle well with the considerable dark chocolate, vanilla and coffee. I also don't seem to be picking up quite as much licorice this year, though it's still there (just more in the background). While I'm sure this beer will age well as always, it's also very attractive and sexy in it's youth as well (something that is not always the case with young Abyss)."
"Overall: This beer is just awesome! Lives up to the hype. Very smooth, sweet, and roasty. I will definitely have more in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final thought - if you don't have one get one. $12, 11% abv and everything you are looking for in a wonderful beer. Deschutes, you continue amaze!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A stylistically perfect, flavorful, highly drinkable, and no worse for the wear beer for the ages."
""
""
""
"O- What a perfect imperial stout. One year in the bottle has tamed the heat. It will be hard not to crack my one other bottle of this vintage."
""
"O: I hate to give a beer all 5's, but this is a beer that deserves it. I was so excited to get this and it didnt let me down. I have never had a beer so amazing in my life. The tastes are so complex and its just so much to wrap my head around. Just perfect."
""
""
"When I was drinking The Abyss I knew it was a great beer but it wasn't until after I drank it that I realized just how flippin' good it was. I actually got a bit...depressed because I knew I wouldn't drink another beer as good for a long time. The next time I see this on the shelf I'll definitely be purchasing it and aging it. I can only imagine how it tastes when aged longer. Great beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good indeed. Could use age to better blend the flavors. Is still good fresh."
""
""
" The mouthfeel on this beer was amazing for me almost to the point of being refreshing for a Double Imperial Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm going to just stop this review. This brew is fantastic! I have had multiple vintages on tap...this is one of the most excessible. Very drinkable - just like the others...I'm sure it will age nicely. Seek out, rob and or pilage for a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall this beer lived up to the hype for me completely. wish i had one or multiple to age to the best buy dates"
""
"O- An excellent beer that improves with age and is worth seeking out. Unfortunately, Deschutes does not distribute to my area, which makes tracking this one down a challenge, but it is well worth the effort."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D- One of the best beers I've had, and certainly one of the best of the style that I've tasted. Can't stop sipping, and I don't wanna. Truly, truly enjoyed. Thanks duff27 for sharing!"
""
"O- Awesome stout, would be interested to try fresh."
"Overall: Spectacular beer. Ridiculous complexity in flavor. I love how smooth it is and how drinkable. It doesn't kick you in the face with the alcohol. It's a great beer. Hope I can get my hands on more."
""
"O - Perhaps the anticipation of this ale jacked up the ratings, but this is certainly a fantastic ale and made for a very memorable experience. Glad I could enjoy this alongside my BA bro and well worth the wait."
""
""
""
""
"O - what can I say, its huge in all aspects, i could easily drink this all day and night at home, just hoping I can find a few more bottles on my next snowboard trip to Montana"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Definitely worth drinking. I've only had The Abyss one time prior to this (actually, it was a three year vertical tasting that I managed to get very small portions of), and I liked the uninfected version more, but this is definitely a drinkable bottle and I feel kind of fortunate that the infection didn't make it unbearable in any capacity. Deschutes is a solid brewery, and probably one of the most consistent in the nation, and I will continue to seek out their beers every chance I get, even when there are obvious mistakes in the process."
"Pours the obvious opaique black, ample tan head. Smell is just a hint on pine hoppiness, coffee, dark chocolate, and slight char. Taste is chocolate followed by muted coffee, vanilla, anise, and a cherry-like fruity tartness. Mouthfeel is thick and carbonation is medium. Hot damn, alcohol is well hidden but present, another win for Deschutes!"

""
""
"O - What a fantastic beer! Deschutes does it again. This beer is complex yet balanced. The aroma and taste are outstanding. I love the cherry and vanilla elements added to this year's release. This is everything a BA imperial stout should be. I was lucky enough to buy a few bottles at the brewpub. I plan on aging a couple of the bottles and seeing what happens."

"O- in a league of its own, a pleasure for the beer taste buds"
"Overall an amazing beer with Alot of complexity and a wide range of flavor and good balance. A must find/try."
"So far, so what.... I'll have to revisit this review when I somehow get another 2010 bottle, or at least try the 2011 vintage somehow."
"Poured from a 650 ml bottle into a snifter, best after date of 11/15/11. This pours a thick pitch black with an okay Mocha colored head which quickly dissipates. The smells are of dark roasted malts, espresso, dark chocolate and licorice with a tad alcohol heat. The feel is thick and creamy with a mouth coating bitterness. The taste is outstanding, loads of roasted malt bitterness along with the tastes associated with the smells above. Excellent beer I wish it was more available."
"O: Great beer. One of my favorite things in this world is barrel aged stouts and this one ranks high up with the other greats."
"Overall, I think this beer deserves all the praise that it has been shown before this review. I love it. Truly a masterpiece."
"While this beer is certainly amazing, the complexity I was hoping for somehow isn't quite there. Maybe the aging has smoothed out all the edges, I'm not sure. Sitting at #15 on BA's top 100 beers creates certain expectations and I'm not sure they were completely met. Still, this is easily one of the best beers I've tried and I would definitely seek it out again."
"Great drinking experience, one of the best stouts I've had."
"Overall, this is one of the best beers I have ever had. This is the first one that I have opened since I bought and had my first one back in January. Absolutely amazing. Can't wait to get some 2011's to add to my collection. Will definitely be opening a few more of these throughout the holiday season/winter."
"Overall this has been my favorite imperial stout, but i have yet to be able to compare it to the aged old raspy or a founders brew."
"This is just what a barrel-aged Imperial Stout should taste like. The balance between all the elements is just right."
"O- What a great beer. Strongly suggested. Lived up to its name for me."
"Had a fresh 2011 bottle and loved it even more than the aged version. The smell was much more complex so I bumped that up from a 4 to a 5. Really complex nose with licorice, caramel, toast and some dark fruits. This also bumped the overall score up to a 5 in my opinion. Just an overall great brew, glad I picked up a couple to enjoy."
"AWESOME BEER...I am obsessed with barrel-aged stouts! thanks to GregSVT for hooking me up!"
"D: Ideally, I could sip on this forever.  Realistically, it's not that easy to put down.  It's a big beer and it carries a punch.  Super complex, heavy, viscous, but absolutely delicious.  It's a sipper for sure, and takes some time to put it away, even when split among friends.  I really, really enjoyed this one and look forward to the next bottle I can get. "
"Amazing beer. I've been waiting a while to open it and I'm glad I still have several more left."
"Essentially black in color with a dark tan head that dissipated slowly. Amazing aroma full of coffee, molasses, vanilla, and bourbon. The flavor has many layers and I noticed different things as it warmed up. I tasted molasses, roasted malts, coffee, and dark chocolate. It’s heavy in body and lightly carbonated. It has a very creamy mouth feel and is incredibly smooth! It finishes with roasted malts and some alcohol that provides a nice warming touch. For an 11% ABV beer, the alcohol is very well hidden. It's incredibly drinkable now and I can only imagine how great it will taste in a year!"
"O: Great chocolate, the best of the three, perhaps more mild bourbon/barrel character than later batches"
"O - A must try because of its fantastic balance."
"Mouthfeel: Abyss coats the tongue like you would expect a great stout too, it lets the flavor linger well into the next sip."
"Overall, although I'm not crazy for bitter licorice stouts, this was extremely tasty and very much worth the hype."
"O: it is amazing to me that so many strong flavor components are melded in a rich and complex beer without letting anything dominate - this beer takes on a bit of a chameleon -like character as a result as a different nuance peeks out with each sip. Rich, dark, sweet, complex and very easy to drink. The richness hides the 11% ABV very well."
"Incredible barrel aged stout. It was everything I was expecting and more. Bold, rich and textural. Surprisingly easy to drink with a near perfect balance. Every aroma and flavor is flawlessly layered. This is a must try for barrel aged stout lovers. I know I will seek it out again and again."
"O: This is one of the best beers I have ever had. Its rich, smooth and tastes wonderful. Similar to FW14, but less barrel taste."
"Overall: I ended up paying about 70US$ for this bottle, but boy was it worth it! The Abyss certainly lives up to the hype and I will make every effort to get another (500) bottle(s)!"
"O - I quite enjoyed this beer even though I'm not a big fan of black licorice."
"O- Fantastic beer to end my ""summer"" with. I have tried and tried for a while for this beer and it lived up to my expectations. Cant wait to get my hands on more and older vintages."
"This is the beer that got me into micro brew style beers. The fact that it is aged in an Oak Barrel really adds that little extra kick of flavor. Hands down my favorite beer. It has great aroma, taste, and appearance. Even the bottle is a work of art. If you have not tried this beer you are missing out on one of the greats. Im blessed to live in the same city that brews this masterpiece."
"This beer is definitely oxidized which makes the nose great, but the finish is tough to bear. Still great but I'm glad I didn't wait any longer on this bottle. I have had it fresh to 6 months numerous times and think that that's the way to go with this beer."
"Overall: Really awesome beer. This beer shows that Deschutes puts alot of ""TLC"" into the reserve series beers. The beer is well made and well named! I can see why it so high up on the lists on BA."
"things out a tad."
"Overall this is one of my favorite stouts and in my top 5 beers. I would like a stronger head but awesome no less."
"O: This is one I have been waiting to try for a while and it did not let me down. I see whay this one is ranked as world class stout!"
"O: Oh my gosh! I can drink this one forever! It's such a great one to sip and savor. I feel like I'm spoiling myself drinking this one; it's so rich and decadent. What a treat! I can't wait for the 2011!"
"O-A wonderful well balanced beer. Glad I was able to get a few via trade. Will be having a stout tasting in the winter and I can't wait to see how this one stacks up as so far it seemed wonderful."
"It's scary how good this beer is. If all of the harsh characteristics drop out after a year or two of aging, this will probably earn a permanent spot in my top 10 favorite beers of all time. It's so ridiculously good."
"Overall, yes, one of the top imperial stouts, but perhaps not quite one of the top beers on planet earth. Close though..."
"O - This is the most complex stout that I have ever had. I would like to try one with some age on it."
"got a bottle of this at zorbaz with friends. It pours black with a light brown head that is there after every sip. The smell is of bourbon and licorice and some sugar. The taate is mouth coating and warm. You can’t just drink this beer you need to sip it and enjoy it. This is a great beer."
"O: FANTASTIC! I do suggest you share this with a friend because at least I would have a difficult time finishing this one."
"O - I am so glad I got impatient and drank this by myself. Character flaws I know. If I was sentenced to death I'd have a hot dog with mustard and a bottle of this. Last sip..."
"Overall: One of the most enjoyable beers I’ve had. A great dessert beverage. I’m not a coffee lover but I loved this beer. Not a chugger but a sipper. Possibly in my top 15-20 beers to date. Will definitely have again and try to keep a little around for that special occasion. If you can find it, you should definitely try it."
"O: A pleasure to drink. I couldn't take the suspense any longer and had to see if it was infected or not. So glad it wasn't. Looking forward to my non-2009's that much more."
"O: Goes down easily, very tasty, filling, big kick, nice representation of style. I think there may have been a touch of infection in this bottle...but I have to say that I enjoy what I've dubbed the wild stout. It's two of my favorite styles lopped in to one."
"I find it hard to put this beer down once I start drinking it as the taste and mouthfeel simply blow me away. Viscous but not difficult swallow, simply stellar."
"Tastes much like it smells, greaty oily mouthfeel, coats every part of the tongue and has a wonderful finish. Lots of dark fruit and chocolate, little bit of caramel, little bit of coffee. A nice treat, and one that everyone should try at some point."
"O- The Abyss definitely lives up to its' reputation as a world-class stout. I have this in the same league as KBS in my book."
"O- This is definitely a solid quality RIS, it deserves the praise it gets on a consistent basis, would I say it’s one of the best in the World….No but I would drink this on more than one occasion. Looking forward to ageing a couple bottles and trying them in the future."
"An excellent offering- though this should definitely be shared (the bottle)."
"O: pretty much perfect, there were some really interesting aromas."
"22oz bomber courtesy of mashmaster. Had this right after Sexual Chocolate. Awesome pitch black pour with a nice brown head. This one has more of the dusty chocolate characteristic and has a much bigger hint of grain to it. Roasty, bitter, and just a touch of sour American stout on the flavor as well. Quite nice, but not the best."
"It’s amazing how certain beers gain legendary status. Often times that beer is a Russian Imperial Stout. In this case, we have a great brewery brewing a legendary style. So, of course, if you are a fan of the brewery (and I am a fan of this brewery), you will be prone to give high marks. But, when compared to other RIS’s, the Abyss just doesn’t stand up. Certainly, it stands apart. It is unique for embracing the smoky side of dark malts and for giving us the ever-enduring anise licorice flavor, but the beer itself is just too thin. Where it gives smoke and licorice, it takes away fullness and chocolate richness. The Abyss is certainly a contender in the imperial stout throne room, but it is a minor god, if you are considering the great Olympians."
"The mouthfeel is equally as appealing with a lovely licorice bite and a mild carbonation. Smooth and chewy with a great boozy warmth in the finish. This is a solid beverage that was worth the several month wait since I bought it. I just wish I had another bottle stashed away to come back to in a few years because time can only make this one even better. Great brew Deschutes."
"very glad I got to try this in a rare PA appearance."
"O - overall, a delicious amazing beer. I'm glad that I got a chance to sample and will have to find it again."
"It's infuriating that this beer is so readily available across broad swaths of this nation. I'll be perpetually ISO until Deschutes distributes here."
"O - I deeply enjoy this brew, I was lucky enough to have a good 2009 vintage, Highly recommend this to anyone !"
"This is a beer I have been wanting to try for years, and I finally scored a bottle in a trade whilst on an epic road trip to Portland, Oregon. Strong, smoky aroma has tones of molasses, wood, bourbon, licorice and semi-sweet chocolate. It pours midnight-black with a thick and rather persistent fine-bubbled tan head that leaves substantial lacing. Flavor is beyond delicious - rich and smoky with tones of molasses, licorice, toffee, caramel, quality coffee, nuts and chocolate. It seems as though each sip is a little different. Thick, smooth flavor has a firm fizz that leaves a persistent tingle to go along with a smoky, nutty, mocha finish. This beer is worth a drive all the way to Oregon!"
"I have enjoyed this each time including a vertical from 06-08. At the time, the consensus was for the 07 batch. This is a standout beer. On a side note, the 2009 batch that I tried was not very good. The 2010 batch returned to good form and was very tasty."
"Overall Impression- The 2010 version was better than 2009!?!? I thought from the beginning this result would be the opposite! Both were full bodied, espresso based, thick, and a beer to sip on for a ton of time! WOW! I can't believe either of these! No wonder they are talked about so much! I wish they could sell these to-go @ Naja's Place but will have to look for somewhere else. FIND! It's the Best Stout Ever!"
"08 bomber courtesy of JohnnyJ. This is one bad mutha fu. SHUT your mouth. But i’m talkin bout shaft. Seriously, I have never poured a beer that had so much freakin’ aroma. HUGE chocolate and molasses nose. The color was Joan Jett black with a big brown head. The taste was outstanding with massive molasses, bitter chocolate, dark roasted malt, and subtle oak. It’s chewy and perfectly balanced. This is one of my top 5 imperial stouts...."
"Nice viscous pour with a thick, oily presence and a dark tan head. It's is a wonderful stout with licorice and molasses flavors, like the label says! The 33% aged in oak barrels really comes through and makes for a unique brew. The 11% ABV doesn't even seem apparent since it's so easy on the palette. I love that licorice and anise note on the flavor that really coats the tongue. This is a nice bottle fresh or aged, and the 2010 is no exception."
"EDIT 2 - I've been frequenting my local place, where they've got 2010 Abyss on tap for $5 a pint. Very fine at a year old. I could almost just smell the beer."
"O - Overall a fantastic beer. Glad to try an older vintage!"
"4/4/2011"
"O-what should be sips will turn in to quaffs with this one. this is a seriously complex stout. it also drinks very easily for the ABV. i wouldn't mind having a full stock of this. craving will ensue i'm sure."
"This is one of those beers that just makes you say ""wow."" It is incredibly tasty, and every sip reveals more layers of subtle flavors. No sharp edges, nothing lacking. Just so much rich, sweet, boozy, dark, goodness. I took over half an hour to drink my 10-oz. pour, because I just wanted to savor every little bit of it. One of the best beers I've ever had."
"O: I enjoyed Abyss. For me, the only real negatives were the coffee notes and the carbonation. I don't drink coffee ever but I will say I like this beer. I wish I could have tried it on tap."
"I’m glad I got a “good” bottle, now I have to hope my others are good too. I’m looking forward to doing a vertical tasting in 2013, as I have the ’06, ’07, ’08 & ’09, now all I need is the ’10, ’11,’12 & ’13!"
"Delicious!"
"Serving type: on-tap and bottle"
"The beer poured a dark pitch into a Maudite snifter with two fingers of root beer-float colored head. It took it a couple of minutes, but the head subsided leaving a fair amount of sticky clingy lacing along the sides of the glass. The smell was pleasant, but a tad to subtle for me. There were notes of chocolate, roasted malt, slight coffee and trace amount of oak and bourbon. The taste was fantastic. Well balanced rich chocolate, molasses, vanilla and a hint of licorice and bourbon. There was a slight hoppy bitterness to it as sell It had a thick and chewy mouthfeel, with light carbonation and a great creaminess that coated my mouth. This bottle more than atoned for my disappointments with the 2009 bottles."
"A stout worthy of its world class status. Glad to have tried it all the way in the Midwest"
"O- A super complex beer, that is as delicious as I expected, and I had really high expectations. I looked back at the bottle and noticed the addition of licorice and molasses, and my only complaint is that these weren't strong enough flavors to make me notice them before reading that (though the molasses gets kind of subdued into the rest of the sweet flavors). This is quite the beer."
"Poured into a mini-stem glass, this beer was dark as the abyss from whence comes its name. A dark brown head redeced to a patchy ring. Lots and lots of chocolate in the aroma, sweet chocolate, with notes of coffee and molasses just barely noticeable and the chocolate fully taking over. More sweet chocolate in the taste, followed by coffee bitterness, caramel, licorice and molasses, dark fruits. After a few sips, the booze starts to emerge, and there is a definite alcohol burn. Finishes pretty woody, dry and bitter. Smooth, silky, full-bodied, and very drinkable."
"Tastes of caramel, nuts, oak chips, wood, herbs, booze, sugar, malt extract, toast, maple syrup, skim milk, dark chocolate, medinicalness. Smells like a milk stout aged on cocoa nibs and herbs. Intense! Not for the faint of heart, y'all. Had it on bottle and on-draft."
"Overall: This beer is damn close to perfection in my opinion especially for the style. I would recommend buying this and then just giving it to me so I can have it in my fridge all year long. Well done Deschutes on this true masterpiece"
"Can't say enough about this bad boy...It's big, rich and amazing. FFO Dark Lord and Marshall Z. Word up."
"mouthfeel - creamy and smooth. good carbonation, which will hopefully die out a bit and thicken it up even more. alcohol is dominating too much."
"2010 bomber poured into a tulip. Really dark with about a fingers worth of head. Smell was great, chocolate, oak, hint of bourbon. Taste was pretty good. very big and balanced flavors. Chocolate, oak, hint of licorice, bourbon and molasses in the finish. I got 2 bottles of the 2010, I can't wait to mtry the second after the ""best after"" date printed on bottle, I'm sure it will only get better with time."
"Mouthfeel is close to perfect. Full bodied and well balanced overall. Very smooth with a good carbonation level. Slight warmth from the alcohol. Very complex to the mouth with all the flavors but manages a slight bitter bite at the end which is very nice. Very drinkable, but it would be tough to polish off a bottle yourself, if you do, dont' expect to do a whole lot that night, it could take awhile, especially if you want to enjoy it properly. A very good beer. I'm glad I have another bottle to let sit for awhile. This beer certainly lives up to the hype, I'm glad I finally got the opportunity to try it."
"Overall: a really amazing stout, certainly worth all the hype. I'm glad that I received this in a trade and wish that Deschutes distributed to New York so I could buy this by the case. If you haven't had this yet, what are you waiting for? Cheers!"
"O- 4.5- Very relieved to have a good bottle with no signs of any infection. A very good beer with 1.5 years on it. Have to put my other 2010 away for a while..."
"O- Rich maltiness and sweet from the bourbon and licorice. A descent beer but I'm not sure if I would go out of my way for another. I have a few more in the cellar so perhaps I'll give it a few more months to see how it develops."
"Narrative: “So this is how product liability lawsuits happen,” Warren Dolce thought as the maroon viscous liquid glugged out of the cocoa butter vat and all over the factory floor. “Of all the things to skimp on, I don’t think that the pressure control valve and the blow off valve were proper,” he reflected “at least not for the chocolate refining tank.” Thousands of wanting Cadburry eggs would remain wanting frosting yokes, in endosperm stasis. The chocolate crude gurgled up to his jaw line and Warren reflected, “perhaps the basement lock was not the way to cut costs either, here I am, 3 floors down, about to endure the prophetic Death By Chocolate, to be honest, I kinda always knew that it would end this way.” He exhaled into the mucilaginous depths watching the bubbles struggle to the surface. “A sweet death, to be sure, but who will finish my screen pl-”"
"overall, well, i told myself i wouldn't be swayed by the hype but in the end? yeah this is a world class beer. no question."
"Overall: Even though it was infected it was still very good. I can’t wait to break into one of me 2010 bottles and get to experience this one in all of its glory."
"I am disappointed with the thin body."
"So glad to have finally tried this beast and cant wait to try an aged '10! Great flavors and aromas but a bit hot still. Not unbearably so but certainly present. Great beer that fills the belly."
"This is not my first Abyss, I enjoyed '08 and '09 (pre infection) but never got around to reviewing them. So I think it's only fair that I review this over it's lifetime with me. This is the stout by which I measure all other Imperial Stouts. It's perfect!!!"
"Thank you to my many trading partners who contributed enough bottles to my cellar that I could drink this treat by myself on a rainy and chilly Saturday night in late May. Cheers!"
"I blew the wad on this one...the last of my reserve. Well all good things must come to an end. First and foremost, this is a really kick butt beer...one will do you. There is absence of light from this beer...black is back. Almost two finger foam, yes thick tan foam. Clingy lace, not without shape, but mostly in rings. Smell is to knock your socks off...Aromas of slightly charred barley sweet malt, cocoa, molasses, maple syrup, and coffee. Taste is enveloping, bombarded with flavors of chocolate, clover, French roast coffee, mint leaf, spices, malt, grapefruit, and pine nuts. Velvet smoothness as this brew passes over my tongue and back throat. Some coating, with aftertaste of coco and coffee. A little pricey for every day consumption, but great as a treat or for a special occasion."
"Overall: A fantastic imperial stout I can see why it gets such great ratings."
"Overall - Very good beer and glad I was able to try this. It's very complex as it gives you different flavors after every sip."
"hints of vanilla come out... nice bitterness and a smokey flavor come together very well.. poured in the glass, you see a nice dark devilish look..topped witha nice head.. 11% abv... your thoughts?"
"Overall: Overall an extremely enjoyable and somewhat unique beer drinking experience. There is a lot going on with this one and to be fair, this bottle has not yet reached the brewers ""best after"" date. With a bit more time, I anticipate the flavors integrating somewhat and creating a more refined final product. However, this should not be read to indicate the flavor profile lacks in some way. This is a delicious and extremely enjoyable beer drinking experience. I am glad I cracked one at this stage to appreciate how complex it truly is, but also glad I have another to taste at a stage when that complexity has reached its peak."
"O- Overall, even thought it scored so low, this is still on of my favorite beers that I've tasted. I believe the beer becomes more balanced and complex as it warms up. I have several bottles in my cellar and can't wait to see what a year or two does to this special brew."
"couple more years on this and this might be the best in the line of abyss"
"D - Not a quick drinker, but oh, so good! Excellent RIS...highly recommended. Glad to have another bottle or two of this. think I'll age one to see how this is in another year."
"I have a hard time seeing this as a top 20 beer. It is truly wonderful and I am amazingly thankful that I was able to get this in a trade but I think this beer’s ranking it a touch higher. That said everyone should have this beer at least once given the reasonable price. Now noticing the best after date and wondering how I missed that. Well I suppose I need another bottle, anyone? Overall a bit too sweet imo and that won't be helped with age. That said some blending of flavors could dramatically improve things."
"O - too much boozy flavor, probably needs to age more to acheive better balance"
"overall, a very enjoyable beer. would like to try some of the other vintages to compare."
"Pours a rich dark brownish black with a nice finger thick head. Smells of malt and black licorice goodness. Tastes like a smokey, excellent stout with the right amount of malt and black licorice, nothing too overpowering. Mouthfeel is great. Effervescent enough to encourage tasting all the tiny component of Abyss on your front and back palate. Drinkability is exceptional. Overall good beer."
"a truly amazing beer. i had the 2010 reserve the day we received it in mn and loved it. i grabbed a second bottle to mature for a few months and decided to pop it open on my girlfriends birthday. i had had an obsidian at my local watering hole prior just so i had a refernence of comparison...unintentioanlly another deschutes product. the abyss is next to perfect. the carbonation is magnificant. the aroma is so rich yet far from overwhelming. the taste boasts rich coffee...sugar...and molasses. poured into a pint glass it was dark, rich yet the head, though minimal, was ideal...a dark carmel lacing was left in color on the glass...perfect. A+/A beer."
"O: Overall a great full bodied solid beer. Great to get two and drink one and cellar to see how it changes."
"This will only get better right now, but seems available enough that you should drink one now to compare to later. Another vertical I want to, but don't need to start."
"Pours like, well, an Abyss - black, viscous, tan head. Looks good. The nose is coffee, bitter chocolate, maybe a hint of caramel and some wood. No booziness present. Smells good. Taste is dark chocolate, caramel malts, wood and a hint of coffee. Again, no hint of booziness, which is impressive. The flavor is actually somewhat mild in comparison to my expectations. Not as rich as I was expecting, but definitely balanced and surprisingly drinkable. Could have used a touch more oomph. The mouthfeel was somewhat heavy with a medium carbonation. Seemed right for the beer. Overall this is definitely a good beer, but I don't understand the overwhelming acclaim. In a night with several other great beers, this quickly became forgettable."
"Abyss is a fantastic example of barrel aging and will only improve with time. Even though there's no alcohol heat on the palate, the nose does display some - something I think time can assist nicely with."
"jd"
"O. I really expected this to be an excellent stout given all of the buzz about it. I have to say that it did not dissapoint. One of the most complex and flavorful Imperial Stouts that I have had. I think this beer really showcases what barrel aging can do to a beer. For my flavor preferences this might be one of my favorite stouts."
"D: I could drink a couple of these if the occasion arose. Awesome beer"
"2010 batch I thought was superior to 2009. Didn't have an infected '09 bottle either."
"O - This was superb. Definitely lived up the very high expectations that I had for this beer."
"D: This is a top tier beer, very well balanced and ages quite well. There is hardly any alcohol noticeable, very smooth, just an overall excellent beer and a must try Imperial Stout."
"O - This is the perfect stout in every way feasible. Can't wait to drink it again."
"Overall: Did not enjoy this beer at all. High expectations based on description on bottle."
"Overall Drinkability - The best stout I've ever had in my life. Perfectly balanced. Smooth in flavor and in mouthfeel. Greatness. Very interesting an complex. Drink it fast though. It'll start to taste like shit pretty quickly when it oxidizes even for a little while. The last pour of the bottle tasted completely different, in a bad way, due to having been sitting on the table for half an hour."
"O: One of my all time favorite stouts. Fantastic all around, I love how you can easily pick out all of the complexities yet they still blend together in perfect harmony. Ridiculously drinkable for an 11% barrel aged imperial stout. Excellent offering from Deschutes."
"22oz bottle poured into maudite stem glass. appearance:pitch black with thin caramel brown head. smell: verry sweet, chocolatey, roasty malts with a vague hint of soy sauce but not in a bad way. taste: delicious sweet and chocolaty up front fades into roasted malts with licorice and bits of coffee in the after taste. mouthfeel: good, not too carbonated, definately not flat. overall: an extremely delicious example of the style. this is one of my fav's its better than chocolate milk!!!"
"Thanks Pitasoup!!!!"
"O: Overall a great full bodied beer. Could use some more bourbon flavor and a bit of aging to mellow out the alcohol flavor. Definitely drink again and would probably age the next bottle."
"O - A great example of the style, but not world class to me. For me I would rather have a speedway stout. I'll drink this one again if it comes across a tap board in my future."
"O - Damn, first time taking this ride and really impressed. Of course, its not a daily drinking type beer but clearly they know what they are doing."
"I am personally not particularly found of 100% barrel aged (BA) stouts and found the abyss (33% barrel aged – bourbon notes not overly pronounced) to be perfectly balanced. Though this beer tends to be difficult to acquire especially for those in Canada, it is a perfect gateway to BA stouts."
"D - There is a lot of earthy, spicy complexity here, especially in the finish. The aroma really doesn't have much going on until the beer nears room temperature, but once it does the molasses and licorice really begin to come out. I don't get as much whiskey character as I expected, but there is a bit in the finish and it seems to add another note of underlying complexity to what is already a complicated beer. I imagine this would age very gracefully."
"Overall (Drinkability): A great tasting brew, and definitely one of the best stouts I've had. Lots of flavor without any single quality being overwhelming, and drinks very well. Absolutely recommend."
"2009 vintage (knowing it was infected). Poured into a SA Perfect Pint glass. Poured a jet black with a creamy brown head and sticky lacing. Aroma of malt, coffee, booze, and a little bit of something funky. Taste of coffee, booze, and a bit of tartness/sourness. I don't know why people think this is a terrible beer ('09 vintage): though not what other years' vintages have been, this one is definitely quaffable in my book. Will be interesting to see how the rest of my '09s evolve."
"Overall: The body of the beer is thick and the finish is full and last for a while on the palate. The beer is very well balanced and beautifully made. With beer being poured on a nitro tap, it just brings a whole new level the beer. There is not much to say, other than a great brew."
"enjoyed a bottle of 2008 which has completely lived up to the high expectations i placed on it. as good as the 2007. wonderful stuff."
"black with a small head that disappears rather quickly. smells boozy up front with the malt coming through in the end. slight hint of soy sauce but not a lot. chocolate as well. flavor is complex, bourbon is non-existent, which is a disappointment. hints of vanilla, chocolate and oak. Nice complexity. Warming sensation. The strong ABV is apparent, but not from a boozy taste. mouthfeel is thick and the beer coats the entire palette and kind of sticks around leaving an everpresent aftertaste. Overall a nice sipper. Not my favorite imperial stout, but a good beer either way. Just wish this actually had SOME hint of the bourbon I was expecting, based on the bottle's label."
"O - next time I will share this brew with many friends, as it is too much for one person. This is a very well crafted brew and much deserving of the hype, but it's not the best stout i've ever had. You should let this age more if you have the 2010, though."
"O: gonna give this one some more time, i have a few more bottles left that I want to see how this does over time."
"Overall (4): Very good but a bit boozy. This one would definitely benefit from a few years in the cellar. Still an excellent RIS."
"Anybody want to volunteer to make Abyss ice cream?"
"The thing about this beer is how complex it is without any one flavor becoming overpowering. Bourbon is just hint but that is okay. All the flavors work amazing well together. Licorice is also lightly noticeable."
"Overall - Phenomenal. A great beer deserving of the hype. The most interesting thing about this beer is how much different is tastes from it's smell. I found the smell lacking to be honest, but when you take a drink of it, every single little flavor comes out. Remarkable beer. Glad I had the opportunity to try this."
"This is, ultimately, a quality beer. A ton of flavor, this is what an Imperial Stout should be. My only regret is that I did not purchase more than three bottles, so I can age them."
"Overall: this beer creates an incredible experience as you can sit and slowly sip a glass of this beer over the course of an hour. Absolutely a great flavored beer - this was the 2010 version."
"Overall- A beautifully made beer, that I can tell was made with great care and talent. Perhaps not the imperial stout for me, but I enjoyed it for the greatness that it could achieve for me in the future."
"O - Overall, this is one of my favorite beers I've had the pleasure of tasting. So complex and alcohol is pretty well hidden. It's quite rich so it's good to have someone to split it with. Really enjoyed it, can't wait to see what some age does to it."
"An amazing beer but definitely a treat and not a regular drink."
"Overall: I haven't had too many rare beers and beers on the top 20 but for now this is probably the best beer I've ever tasted."
"O: A myriad of flavor, artfully crafted to superbly balance the chaos that could erupt with so much going on. Very, very, well done and deserving of a top ten spot, based on my limited experiences."
"2010 bottle. Pours a dark black with light just coming through at the edge when help up to the light. Small light tan head with good retention that leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. Aroma is chocolate, licorice, molasses, and bourbon. Alcohol is fairly strong on the nose as well. Initial taste is sweet, dark chocolate going into more molasses and licorice. A little bit of oak and bourbon as well. Finish has a decent bitterness and a decent amount of alcohol. Medium body. Light carbonation. Great beer."
"On a more relevant note, I purchased this 22 oz. bottle of 2010 Reserve at Jubilation Wine & Sprits in Albuquerque for $13.99. Poured into a large wine glass because that's all I had. It was phenomenal. Took wiz. Dreamt beer. The end."
"mouth feel was silky and the light carbonation made me want to hold it in for ever."
"D - I hope Deschutes distributes to Ohio soon... I want more of this. On KBS release day I feel this stout is superior."
"Drinkability - wow. So inviting, so dense, so drinkable. All of the great qualities of a creamy stout with the depth of an aged offering. I didn't get the sense at all of a brett contamination that I've heard about (and may have experienced at a past tasting). This was well done. My personal preference would be to let your 2009s sit for another year or two to allow the hops to further round out this offering. An excellent sipper right now, sure to improve with more age. Excellent."
"I occasionally talk about my time ""visiting the abyss"" when I mention my self-destructive college/grad school antics, or general hatred. While I can see that one would want to drink enough of this (very strong) beer to go to the abyss, I would say that this Abyss is a much friendlier place. Sort of reminds me of the Kids in the Hall Simon Milligan sketches, in that The Abyss is less hellfire and more ""here, let me shower you with gifts far beyond your expectations, and here's even more to boot."""
"drinks well. very smooth and full-flavored with a nice alcohol kick, but no harshness. worth the hype? maybe. Wish I could have picked up a couple more of these for the basement."
"You get a few different aromas and flavors as it warms. I like it on the warmer side. My suggestion start at 55 degrees finish at 60."
"Pours an absolutely pitch black with a small 1 inch tan head that fades to a small film on the top of the beer. Spotty ring lacing around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, molasses, vanilla, licorice, and cinnamon. Absolutely delicious smelling. Tastes of dark roasted malt, bitter coffee, cocoa powder, and vanilla extract. Subtle hints of licorice and cinnamon on the finish. Very thick and creamy in the mouth. Drinkability is out of this world. A great beer to sit and sip on for a prolonged period of time. The ABV is well hidden in the taste but it sneaks up on you in the end. This is really a beer that you can only have one of at a time. Overall, a truly exceptional beer. I am glad I have a stockpile of these in my cellar."
"D - It is delicious but it could be hard to drink more than one based on flavor intensity and ABV. Still great offer."
"Overall- Glad I had at, but FBS is much easier to get and just as good if not better in it's own right."
"A spectacular, easy drinking, well-balanced, nearly perfect stout. So delicious!"
"M & D - fantastic balance of all of the above. Alcohol is not a prominent taste but you can feel that it's there. Awesome beer in every way."
"The Abyss is a great Imperial Stout. It is a fantastic winter beer and a dream for beer geeks everywhere."
"Overall this beer is bomb dot com. I wish I had bought more than 3 bottles now. Oh well, there is always next year!"
"its delicious go find one! and drink it!"
"Excellent beer that is strong and flavorful, but still balanced and not overwhelming. Would still go for an Old Rasputin over this despite the high rank of this beer, particularly on nitro. Although excellent, I don't know that the difficulty in finding this beer is justified as compared to some of its easier to acquire counterparts."
"I want to see this with a bit of age on it. A top stout even without age. Excellent beer."
"4/4/4.5/4/4"
"Overall this isn't the most revolutionary RIS I've had but it has to have one of the deepest flavor profiles and one of the most balanced stouts that is aged in bourbon. The bourbon is folded right into the mix and is perfect with the molasses, cocoa powder and toasty malts."
"2010 Vintage. Been over a year since I've had this beer...Gonna finally get the chance to review it! Pours a thick, dark black which seems like engine oil. Very minimal brown head. Scent is chocolatey with some espresso and a hint of wood. Taste is FANTASTIC! First I get sweet chocolate and subtle bourbon flavors. Then I get some oak flavors with vanilla and a tiny bit of black licorice. Not nearly as much coffee/espresso as I was expecting, which isn't a bad thing considering the amazing flavors and complexity to this beer. There is a little bit of hop bitterness throughout. Mouthfeel is thick and rich...close to perfect. Drinkability is high as ABV is SCARY WELL HIDDEN! Awesome beer!"
"Better than the smell, you almost can't process it with the normal brain...boy am I impressed! It starts off Oaky and woody since it was 33% aged in French oak and bourbon barrels. That being said, it's only a 3rd aged in those barrels so the oak wasn't too corky and there was a touch of bourbon that shined through just enough to tell you that it was different from the rest. I also get a dark truffle baker's chocolate roasted malt finish. It's like walking into a Starbucks and ordering off of their secret menu and sipping a chocolate full roast coffee blend with a nutty alcoholic backbone and a cocoa finish. You're sitting in the coffee shop sipping on a secret brew and only you know about it and only you can appreciate its bitter black licorice personality as it envelopes itself into an almost Charlie sheen like rebelliousness!! I really can't fathom how awesome this brew is going to be after I finish aging it. I don't expect you to either. I opened this one up prematurely because I'm impatient and need immediate gratification but I am already truly amazed by the absolute posterboy for a warlock stout that presented itself here... I can't wait to grab the next one out of my cellar in 8-10 months when this beer hits its sweet spot! I just took my final sip while finishing up this 22 oz bomber by myself and look at me, I'm drunk.., DUH! Cause that's how I roll, I only have one speed, I have one gear.. "" GO !! """
"All in all a great dessert. One more 2009 in the cellar and I hope it performs as well."
"Chocolate, roasted malt, oak and a hint of bourbon hit the nose and palate with a rich and thick feel. This is an incredible beer and if I could change anything it would adding a bit more of a bourbon presence but that is really nitpicking."
"The flavor is a neck and neck battle between sweet and bitter. The bitterness is both in part from hops as well as from the ridiculous amount of roasted grains and the sweetness is just from the residual sugars left from fermentation - I don't get any caramel character. There is an oaky astringency that plays well with the tannins from the roasted malts and the finish tastes entirely of dark cocoa powder. A beer that is simply a tribute to the glory of dark malts...amazing."
"Drinkability is excellent with this beer. Normally an 11% ABV bomber is a beer to split but it was halfway gone before I had let the full flavor profile run around and allow me to grasp it. The other half was just enjoyed slowly. Definitely a sipper that is probably best enjoyed on a cold winter night."
"Homerism aside, The Abyss is straight up a world class beer. It is widely available up and down the west coast. No stupid brewery only release in an attempt to make their beer more important then it really is. It is also quite amazing Deschutes can produce such a good beer with such a large scale production (350bbl on the 2008, up to 600bbl on the most recent batches). Fantastic beer from a fantastic brewery. My hats off to you Deschutes."
"Because I opened this I will have to get another. Excellent beer! Thanks Deschutes!!"
"I was pretty surprised to find this, as it was there and gone in my home town (Austin)."
"This is fairly light and carbonated for an Imperial Stout, and a bit high on the burn factor. I downgraded both the mouthfeel and the drinkability for this lightness and slight burn. Overall a very good beer that I am anxious to try again as it ages."
"this beer is awsome. not to cloying or tin with pleanty of complex flavoring. no alcohol burn. this one is drinking great now. cant wait to try it a few years from now."
"After I managed to get the wax seal off of the bottle, I popped the top- instantly had a tart molasses bubble rise to the top of the bottle. It popped, giving me a tart scent of dark molasses. Poured into my Dfh snifter, pours a pitch black color, with a little tan head. Smell- lightly sour and tart molasses, licqourice, and chocolate. Taste- coffee, liquorice, and molasses, with a dark chocolate finish. This is an amazing beer experience. Lives up to the hype."
"O: This really blew me away compared to what I thought of it last time. The barrels really come together in a good way and build off of a big, sweet base. Now I understand why it's so highly regarded and I'll be sure to wait until after the ""best after"" date from now on. 4"
"Overall a far from disappointing experience with a fantastic dark beer."
"D - Drinkability is high. The flavors are bold, rich, and unique, and the alcohol is dangerously hidden. This beer is definitely worth the praise, and I wish I had easier access to this!"
"This is an incredible Imperial Stout, nearly a perfect one for me. Dark, roasty, smooth and with interesting balance of flavors. The score says it all."
"D - To be honest, I have a rough time calling any big RIS ""highly drinkable"" so I rate to the style. This mule of a beer is as good as any of this breed as far as balance and ability to enjoy, but I feel that one maybe two is max for anyone that isn't used to drinking Scotch served neat on a hot day."
"The aging in this beer has really toned down the alcohol burn to the point of none existent. I can see myself having a snifter of this anytime of year, rain or shine, it's that damn good. Not to mention that the barrel aging has really combined all the flavor's and nuances of this otherwise, incredibly made, and well crafted beer. Cheers!"
"This beer poured darker than any beer I've seen before. The foam lasted extremely long. The beer tasted much sweeter than I expected it to for being so strong. Plenty of coffee and sweet molasses. With out a doubt, worth the trip to the Deschutes Brewery."
"2007 Bottle thanks to Glouglouburp. Dark black pour, with no head. Aroma of licorice, black berries, coffee, hops are gone, but you can tell they were definately there. What is left is a nice balance of fruitiness/herbalness from the berries and anise. Taste is rich coffee roastiness with herbal licorice notes, light barrel aging flavors - just a hint of booze on the finale, bitter finish. Palate is a bit flat, but full flavored and creamy."
"There's a reason why this is a favorite among BeerAdvocates: It's tickles your palate and blows your mind."
"Final thoughts: With the ever-growing number of Imperial stouts available I think this is one that definitely stands out. I'm not saying it is the best out there but in a blind taste of Imperial stouts I am sure I can easily pick this one out. The combination of bourbon aging and licorice are what make this stout stand out. If you are not impressed by the first sip wait till the last third of the bottle and you will grow to appreciate this beer, if not you will at least get a good buzz!!"
"T: Full, smooth, complex and sweet. A lot of dark chocolate and coffee along with some dark fruit. Hides the alcohol well, but there's a nice warming sensation as you drink this. Without a doubt, the best beer I've ever had."
"Is this the beer that sits at the top of the biggest stouts? Really good no doubt, but I'm going to have to lean towards Speedway as the upper hand. I'll age some and revisit."
"D- Filling but easy to down. The ABV is hidden extremely well, but the think that takes the most away from the drinkability is how filling it is. It's literally a meal in a bottle. I hear that all the time, but this seems to fit that statement perfectly."
"Sad. I wonder if its a victim of the growing problem I've been hearing about of brewery's wild brews contaminating their non-wild brews."
"D: This beer is complex and strong but quite drinkable."
"This was a very unique taste experience for sure. I think that the 07s are holding up very well. The flavor profile is very nice but yet subtle and have to sort of dig for some flavors at first. I don't know how much longer this would have continued to age and get better. If you have an 07 you will no be disappointed if you open it up now."
"M/D: Has a heavier/thicker mouthfeel, but drinks very smooth. Slightly dry. I did not get much heat from this bottle. Overall, easily one of my favorite Imperial Stouts to date. Can't wait to have this one again and will always be happy to have some in the cellar."
"Heavy in body and very smooth and creamy, low carbonation accents the creaminess. Very drinkable though it took me a good ten minutes to get my nose out of the glass and take a sip! A great sipping beer and certainly worthy of the esteem it's given."
"Pours a black body with a chocolate head. Good head retention with some decent lacing. Aromas of roast malt and oak from the nose. I can detect a slight scent of alcohol as well. Roasted malt, a touch of black licorice and lots of smooth molasses on the front of the flavor. Dark chocolate and bourbon on the finish. The body is will balanced and smooth, however there is an alcohol bite on the finish. I liked Abyss, but I didn't love it. I would certainly drink it again (a sipper) especially if it had some age on it."
"D - The taste is pretty good. I feel like one bottle would do me though. The mouthfeel is just not what I am looking for when I head for a stout."
"FourthBeer potential: ABSOLUTELY. Plain and simple, this isn't just a beer, it's an experience, and is truly worthy of all 5s. And while I drank this entire bottle solo, this is one of those beers that I would enjoy sharing with others (especially given the ABV)."
"D = Really a robust and pleasant drinker. All afternoon and all evening. To be enjoyed in a big ol' leather chair. Nice to share with friends after a winter hearty dinner. Perfect!"
"OTHER NOTES: I also had the opportunity to taste an infected bottle from 2009. Tasted January 2011 (some weeks after I had had the 2010 on tap), the bottle listed best after 11/1/2010. The spoiled beer was similar in aromatic profile, but with an added bacterial funkiness. The funk was present in the taste as well. That said, the feel and appearance were unaffected. The beer was still fairly drinkable, and I'd probably have scored it somwhere in the 3.5-3.7 range."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed sharing this for a special occasion. It proved to be a great conversation piece and a sipper undoubtedly. It's a great complex stout that doesn't attack you with a ridiculous ABV, nor does it leave you dissatisfied. Can't wait to see how this one ages..."
"This is a fantastic stout, I tried the 2009 version, none infected after alrady having had a kazillion great bear at Brabanders (Thijs') house and didn'ttake notes. I should have Sek it drink it and age one if you can. This is a winner for sure. Thank you a bunch Dan."
"I enjoyed this brew at a Rare Stout night tasting, thanks to CampusCrew and the other generous BAs. This was not a true standout like the Bourbon County and Hunpahus was, but it is an impressively made imperial stout indeed."
"*I also had The Abyss on tap, and it was amazing! I have 1 bottle I am aging for a year to compare flavor profiles."
" Tastes have mellowed and smoothed beautifully, two years could be the sweet-spot for this beer."
"D: this is an expertly crafted imperial stout that shows a lot of finesse as well as bold flavors."
"Not completely masked abv but pretty good I must say for a very high eleven percent. Great tasting, a beer that changes personality in your hands while you consume it. Glad I had one, and for sure... I want another."
"D - Goes down incredibly easy considering this is a stout. Very impressive."
"M/D: Super smooth and one of the most balanced beers I have had to date. There isn't any one thing that jumped out at me in this beer, and that's not a bad thing."
"D- Wow. Truly a deeply complex brew that is dangerously drinkable. I can't tell if the alcohol is just surprisingly well hidden, or if all of the rich flavor just keeps me from noticing it. Drink with responsibility and caution! Enjoy :)"
"D: As far as stouts go, this is a first-round knockout. Like I said, it improves greatly as it warms up. Unfortunately, this means that it reached its peak right when I was almost done with the bottle. But like they say in showbiz, always leave them wanting more. I can see this improving with age, but it's plenty good right now."
"Drinkability: This reminds me of Stone's IRS in how balanced it is. Not a coffee or chocolate bomb, Abyss simply presents a variety of enjoyable flavors to you, one after another, letting them integrate over time. A very relaxing sipper."
"Hope to taste 2010 soon"
"I am thoroughly convinced this is one of my top 3 imperial stouts ."
"Drinkability: Great depth of flavor, alcohol completely masked. A great drinking beverage for a winter's night."
"D: Fuhgit abaht it... Bahtendah... Ahl 'ave anothuh. 5/5"
"o - abyss is my favorite beer. the 2010 blew me away, the 2011...not so much, 2009 i don't like to talk about (infected) but the 2008...OH 2008. what a year! and the time on this beer is simply perfect. this is a real treat and i'm psyched to have 22oz all to myself! iso this beer!"
"D= Very drinkable for a high ABV. This is a great beer would seek out again."
"Man this beer was insane. We popped a 2010 vintage open at a party to share among a group of beer lovers. People marveled at how it poured so indescribably black. People commented that they thought we were drinking soy sauce. It coats the glass and looks like you are chugging engine oil. Smell was out of this world, an amalgam of various sweet and savory flavors that was almost overwhelming. I couldn't drink more than about 4oz of it and not sure i could ever finish a whole bottle. One note was that for such a strong beer the alcohol was hidden surprisingly well. My compatriots and i were surprised when we saw the 11% on there, which was a welcome change from the heavy beers we tend to try."
"I would say it has pretty good drinkability, but since its such a good beer you almost feel bad drinking it. I could/would knock a few of these out easily."
"Wow, what a great beer. After the letdown that was the 2009 batch, and the letdown (for me) that was the black butte porter, I was expecting the worse; but this beer out-did all my expectations. I was only lucky enough to snag two bottles, but I wish I had two cases of this stuff. I hope the rumors are true, and Deschutes is coming to Wisconsin soon, hopefully by the next time The Abyss is released."
"D: For the style the drinkability is pretty good. The drinkability is probably only limited by the abv and the heaviness. I am glad this was easy to find as I'm excited to have it again sometime."
"D: The finish leaves me coming back for more, not because I really want it but because I'm trying to figure out what this strange mix of flavors going on is."
"D - Well, it's too hot right now. But I still think it tastes great and is hard to keep away from."
"This is an exceptional beer. Pours just as the name would lead you to believe it would, jet black with a brown head that doesn't stick around long leaving some lacing behind. Smell has a hint of bourbon, lots of chocolate, vanilla and some dark fruits. Taste is of vanilla, dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, not a lot of booze. This beer drinks almost too well for an 11% huge stout. Mouthfeel is perfect, medium carbonation, well balanced. Best stout I have ever had. Great job!"
"Definitely lived up to the hype, one of the best, if not the best imperial stouts i've had. I will definitely be trying to get more of this soon or in the future."
"I love this beer. I had a bottle of 2009 and though it was slightly off it was still very good. But since it wasn't as good as it could have been I will just review the 2010. It pours black with a half inch of of tan head that seemed to stick around for days... It looked fantastic in my stone IRS tulip. I couldn't wait to dive in to this glass of motor oil. The smell was as good as a stout gets. Oak, chocolate malts, vanilla, molasses, bourbon round off the initial whiff. The smells brown sugar and chocolate/vanilla stick around the longest. Love it! The taste is amazing all the smells shine through in the taste, the sweet yet awesomely bitter taste keeps me going back for more. The first third of the bottle has lots of oak and chocolate malts with a ton of sweet molasses on the finish. The bourbon flavor is a bit subdued and I'm sure that's bc it is only 33% aged in barrels. The beer is a bit rough on the edges and all I can think is how good it will be in 1,2 or even 3 years from now if I can wait that long to revisit it (have 2 more bottles). Overall it is a fantastic beer to drink now even though it is a bit young. I feel this could be one of my favorite beers if it ages to the potential I think it has. If you can find a bottle hold onto it and if you can find 2 or more drink 1 now and you won't be disappointed!"
"D - Drinks great for a IS, easy drinking and balance but that can get you into trouble with this one....11%! WOW! Average IS taste and feel, appearance is a little better than average making it over the top. Thumbs UP!"
"Soo good. Looks good, smells good, tastes good, it's pretty damn good. A rich creamy tan foam sits upon the black abyss and stays there for minutes. Faint aromas of bourbon and chocolate swirl in a blast of roasted malt. The taste is decadent. Chocolate, caramel, bourbon, coffee, and roasted malt mingle intensly. The mouth feel is rich and chewy, and the finish is minutes as the beer coats your whole mouth. Dangerously drinkable and delicous."
"CHEERS!!"
"Top notch imperial stout, probably one of the best beers I've ever had. A must try."
"Ultra velvet cloudy smoothness, milder carbonation, full syrupy body. So delicious and pleasant on all the senses, one of the better imperial stouts I've had lately, especially since this was a beer I've been waiting about two years to try. Some age on this would be even better, as the alcohol heat was probably the only obvious negative aspect."
"This is a real contender, but it's drinking so well fresh that I have a hard time imagining how this will improve with age. I'll let you know..."
"It is the first thing I am tasting in the morning, and it is probably the best tasting thing I will have all day! Overall, the beer is not too sweet (as I expected), but I plan on sitting on one for a while to see how its flavor profile develops."
"drinkability is out of this world - fresh this beer is great and i can only imagine how an aged bottle would be - i can see myself trading for a bottle or two every year"
"Poured from 22oz bottle (2008 Reserve - 20th Anniversary bottle - I also tried the most recent years going forward which pretty much shared similiar taste) into tulip glass. Pours a really dark black with a nice consistency and a thin dark tan head. Nice sweet aromatics - licorice, molasses, coffee, roasty, oak, and some dark fruits. Talk about nice complexity! The flavor is roasty, warming, fruity, warming alcohol, coffee, chocolate, lots of wood, molasses, light barrel aging, a sort of vinous quality. The palate is first cocoa which leads to roasted coffee and a sweetness that reminds you of molasses, some licorice, and finishes sweet as well. Slight vanilla and wood flavors mid palate. This quickly became one of my favorite Americal Double / Imperial Stouts out there!"
"2010 Bomber- A: nice rich, chocolate head. The aroma is overwhelming with coffee. Tastes of coffee and cherries. Fair amount of hops as it is still fresh. The alcohol is noticeable but not overwhelming. Medium feel, spreads evenly though the mouth. Enjoyable to drink."
"Hopefully will land a 2010 bottle and will re-review."
"D - very drinkable, every flavor is well balanced. had this beer for the first time last night and I enjoyed every sip of it. will not give this a perfect score yet. need to wait for 10 more months to taste the aged perfect version, per label's instruction. then maybe I'll be giving this perfect beer a perfect score."
"The Abyss is incredibly well balanced and easy drinking even fresh. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous, just coating the palate in delicious flavors. It really is smooth and mellow, and might just be one of the best -bal aged beers I've had. Considering how easy drinking it is now, I can only imagine how delicious it will be when I open my second bottle next December."
"D & Overall: As this warms its getting better, if thats possible. I received this in a trade. If i lived on the west coast I would by cases of this and live a happy happy man. stouts are style and this is tops to me. perfect 5s all the way around. the hype is justified. I only received one bottle so this is the 2010 version. I NEED to get another to age to compare. wow. just the best..."
"Considering this is 11% abv, I'd say the drinkability is pretty good. I'm going through the first glass from this bomber pretty quickly. The abv is actually pretty well hidden. And what matters most is that my folks, having each took a sip or two, thought it was pretty damn tasty."
"Astonishing beer."
"Overall: Why don't I buy a case of this every year? I will this next year...this is my perfect beer. Deschutes, I love you."
"For all the bombast and complex flavors going on, the main impression is that this is incredibly drinkable and harmonious for such a big beer. You can really see how some cellaring should round off the licorice/oak/alcohol and make this even more smooth and sublime. Hard to imagine a better example of an Imperial Stout. Need to stop drinking this so fast...22oz @ 11% = TKO."
" ~ There is a reason this brew is so sought after. Everything about it is amazing. A beer like this makes me want to move to Oregon just to have access. There is no Imperial Stout that I have encountered that is better."
"If I were a rich man, I'd by the rights to this beer and install it permanently in my house as a tap. It is a wonderfully delightful brew that will not disappoint."
"D: If I could afford it, I would drink this beer all day, everyday."
"Best stout I have ever had and one of the top beers if not THE top beer I have tried. Dark, rich, choc. taste with hints of other flavors. Simply put it is amazing if you can find it, get it. One of the few beers I found worthy of it's hype. I do not see how this can let anyone down unless you just do not like stouts."
"Verdict: Absent the noticeable alcohol, this would be elite. As it is, this is awesome and worth the price."
"D - Doesn't drink as heavy as it feels. In fact, it goes down surprisingly easy. An excellent Imp Stout."
"poured almost jet black with a thin mocha head. dissipated quickly but left nice lacing. smells delicious. sweet with both vanilla and chocolate notes. didnt pick up any bourbon scents. tastes top notch. roasted chocolate with hint of fig and vanilla. slightly thicker mouthfeel sets this apart from some other top tier imperial stouts ive had. lives up to the hype. would like to have detected a touch of the bourbon flavor, but still the best imperial stout i have had from a bottle."
"Truly lives up to the hype. This is one of the most exceptional beers I have ever tasted in my life"
"D- like a roasted bitter chocolate shake. So nice!"
"Verdict: This is an amazing Imperial Stout fresh; perhaps the best I've ever had. It's packed full of flavor, character, and booze but is somehow remarkably easily drinkable. As amazing as this is now, I cannot wait to see how this evolves over the next few years."
"Thanks to BS68280 for my first experience with this delicious beer."
"Definitely deserves it's place as an elite brew!"
"Drinkability - I feel this years is a decent amount more drinkable than last years. This, while it does have alcohol warmth, does not show much heat while drinking. I'm glad I have four more of these in my cellar and hope they don't become ""infected"" as my '09 did. Cheers!"
"This may be a good example of why one should not post a review immediately after drinking the brew in question, but I couldn't resist. It's a one pint bottle. This is a great beer, like drinking a delicious bread. I paid about $13 for one bottle of this stuff, it was well worth it. Like the label says, it is a wonderful stout with licorice and molasses flavors. The 33% aged in oak barrels really comes through and makes for a unique brew. The 11% ABV doesn't even seem apparent since it's so easy on the palette. I wish it were cheaper and more available... but like one reviewer said ""it's dangerously easy"" to drink."
"The CPJ"
"I've had The Abyss in bottles many, many times - almost every time I see it, I clean out the store. Sorry...finding it on tap is a huge treat. Papago Brewing."
"Drink- This was good when I had it at the OC fair in a plastic cup before I knew what Abyss was. In a snifter out of a sealed bottle. So much better."
"Drinkability: I took a couple of hours to finish this bomber, and I took my time on purpose because the 11% definitely lets you know. I'd say for stouts this is very drinkable just because it is so good. I thought it was expensive when I bought 6, but after tasting how good it is, I'm going to pick up some more for aging. This beer lives up to the hype. Try it if you can."
"D - Very drinkable, and just an overall really great beer. I wish this was more readily available because it is something special. Hope I can get my hands on a few more to let age and see what else this brew can develop."
"The long wait for this brew was beyond worth it. Of all the the ultra-hyped brews I have had, this one beyond lives up to said hype. Abyss is dangerously drinkable. The alcohol is smooth, just standing out enough to let you know this is a strong beer. I have drank many memorable beers over the year. This one though may be at the top of the list. Thank you Deschutes for creating this nectar of the gods."
"Thanks again Seth, a real treat!"
"Was waiting for a beer for my 100th review. I think this qualifies. From the 2010 batch. Poured into my Ommegang goblet. A little less than a finger of sudsy medium brown head. Black body tinging towards cherry cola at the top. Pretty good lacing after a fairly quickly receding head. Some nice islands of head floating around in this dark sea. Roasted coffee, licorice, sweet malt, light chocolate, alcohol are all present on the nose. A little bit of oaked bourbon but not overpowering in any way. Tastes very licorice-like, vanilla from the barrels, toasty roasty coffee, pretty bitter finish, but in a burnt way, rather than a hop way. Mouthfeel is perfect. Heavy. Creamy. Just perfect. Finishes nice and dry. Dangerous drinkability for 11+. Outstanding."
"2010 release. Hadn't had one of these yet, so we tried one fresh. Pours a tremendously jet black coloring, with a dark brown, foamy head that dissipates as you drink. The beer smells of coffee, molasses, and dark chocolate. The beer has initial flavors of coffee and malty alcohol. You absolutely taste the oak barrel and smokey characteristics, also. The alcohol is present and in front throughout experiencing this brew. The finish is a little harsh, and I can only imagine that it smooths out as it ages. Very low level sweet aftertaste, with tastes of caramel and molasses. I look forward to trying this one again in a year or so..."
"Cheers"
"This is now the standard which I hold all RIS."
"D: Off the top of my head, the best imperial stout I've ever had. The flavors combine well and create wonderful balance. I see why this is so highly regarded"
"Served on tap into a pint glass, this poured an opaque black color with a scant tan head that quickly dissipated leaving little or no lacing on the glass. The smell was faintly of toffee and chocolate. The taste was intense, with notes of toffee, chocolate, caramel, and coffee. Not much in the way of hops was tasted, but with all the other flavors they weren't missed. The mouthfeel is suitably rich. This is an intensely flavored high alcohol beer, so one is enough, especially when the bartender poured this into a pint glass. I'm not complaining. It was an excellent way to finish the evening. This is a very nice brew."
"D - The quintessential sipper. Absolutely perfectly balanced and a gem."
"D - This beer really was everything I expected it to be, and more. Despite the heaviness and high alcohol, this beer is pleasant on the senses and quite drinkable. A completely different beast than other American Imperial Stouts (e.g., Stone RIS or Old Rasputin), entirely in a category of its own."
"D: Good drinkability. Its 11%, doesn't taste quite that high, but you know its high abv. Some age will do this one nicely. Will review again after the 11/15/11 best after date."
"So in conclusion I really really like this beer. This is one of those really neat beers that will just get better over time. If you get a 22 better pick up two of them. One to drink now and one to put in the dark to age. Yup says right on the label that this magical witches brew will sit just fine in the bottle for some aging. The Abyss is a great beer and if you like dark complex beers then this is the one for you. My local price here in San Diego is $13.99 for a 22oz bottle."
"It's hard to find a flaw with this beer on its own. Compared to other mega stouts it's admittedly not my favorite (see: Parabola, BCBS), which is perhaps due to its reserved sweetness in favor of earth and oak. Hope to try this aged some day. Good job, Deschutes."
"An ideal sippin' Imperial Stout -- one to savor. Even in its youthful state, it's amazing. I will have to find some to age. I very much enjoyed traveling into the Abyss. Hats off to you, Deschutes!"
"D - Fantastic brew here. Very deep, dark, complex flavors on the nose and palate. This one easily ranks up there with the best of them. This beer seems to a very well balanced hybrid between a huge RIS (lots of chocolate and burnt coffee) and a huge BA RIS (molasses, charred oak, and vanilla), both sides competing on the palate, but neither winning the battle. Fantastic, can't wait to see what some age does this beauty."
"The Abyss pours a deep oil black color with a lot of viscosity to the pour. A nice tan to brown head sticks throughout. A very nice looking pour. Smells are dominated with coffee, chocolate and bourbon. Very nice smelling. The taste is somewhat hot with the bourbon and alcohol but still delicious. I think this needs another year to sit and to mellow out. Mouthfeel is thick and carbonated. Drinkability is misleading with this brew. It is a huge beer and the entire bomber is just too much for one person in a single session."
"Drinkability is still quite good cause it's a tasty brew, and I could still have probably taken down a bomber, though I had help from friends this time. I may come back and throw in another rating next November when I'm 'supposed' to drink this."
"Great feel on palate, can taste one small sip for a long time. Thanks deschutes for making so much more of this in recent batches."
"As it is, this is something I'm glad I got to try but cannot say is my favorite Imperial Stout. It lacks balance, in my opinion. What I had was a total ""bourbon bomb""."
"Living close to so many breweries has its advantages...but also its disadvantages. It's easy to get overwhelmed with such a fantastic array of beers, accessible as they are. The result is that when you try a really incredible beer, like the Abyss, you have to remain objective. After several years of production (limited release) I have bottle conditioned (over a year) and have had it on draft. The quality is always perfect, never changing except on bottle conditioning, but that only improves the character, mouthfeel and taste. I rated this beer highly, because as my liver can attest, it has had some competition and remains a highlight of the cold winter months here year after year. The aroma is incredible, and the taste washes over your mouth, saturating it completely with dark molasses and oak. I love this beer."
"This beer stands out as exceptional beyond other remarkably well done stouts."
"Overall, this seems to be a great vintage. Each vintage has been different, but this may be the most cohesive vintage fresh, compared to other years. My favorite vintage is 2008, but hopefully this one can rival it down the road since I have 2 more bottles of this in the cellar and only one more bottle of the 2008."
"Chewy medium body with an incredibly luscious, silky chocolate malt flavor. Hints of mocha, toast, oatmeal, mocha and toffee as well as some caramel and sweet alcohol. Slightly creamy presence mid-palate makes this beer incredibly smooth and extremely quaffable. Slight bitterness up front is countered by the chocolate malt as well as the oak, bourbon and vanilla notes. The ABV is excellently masked making it dangerously drinkable. Also, the barrel aging adds to the complexity and balance of the beer and instead of it being a complete bourbon bomb it results in an incredibly complex, flavorful and well balanced, amazing beer."
"However, the 2009 (infected or not) was a complete trainwreck right out of the gate. Bad barrels, infected, whatever the excuse is, the '09 sucked something awful. Avoid that year like the plague..."
"This was a 2010 bottle shared with my fiance over dinner. Great bottle that pours black with a deep tan head and a bit of stickyness around the sides. I believe wine people call this legs. My nose detects smokeyness brought on by the molasses (I believe), licorics and anise, chocolate roasted notes, and a hint of vanilla and cherry. The flavor is in harmony between deep roasty flavors like chocolate, coffee, and toffee and popping flavors like anise, vanilla, oak and fruity and even some grapey tastes. Thick, luscious, and smooth mouthfeel. The alcohol content in this beer is well hidden, but even at that this is a beer to share."
"Deschutes is an excellent brewery."
"D: its a big beer and drinks very well for it, nice integration of alchohol and is pretty easy to drink but wouldn't want to pound it back."
"Overall, a really great stout with some nice balance. I love the brown sugar/molasses component to the flavor and how well it is integrated without being overpowering. Complex and balanced, with a really strong flavor base. Highly recommended."
"I could sip this all night if I had more. Alas this was the only bottle I could procure. I love this beer. Must find more. Holy damn."
"D: Have had this one a few times during various tasting. Finally had a full bottle to review. Very smooth, but a little hot to call this one highly drinkable. Would love to try a vertical of this one."
"I thought this beer was amazing. After having the oak aged yetti that everyone raves about i thought this was far and away a better beer. the drinkability was hands down better and the flavor was more apparent. I thought that the 11% felt more like an 6 or 7% because of the abundant flavor hiding the alcohol. Nothing about this beer was too harsh yet it remained a full body Imperial stout.. in my opinion it was a perfected stout. I live in oregon and get to drink deschuttes beers all the time and none of them are this good. their porter is great but waiting all year for this beer is well worth it. in my town you can get it whenever you want on tap. Only thing i have to say about this beer that i didn't like was the 14 bucks it cost out of the bottle when i can get it on tap for 5. I have always been a stout drinker and in my opinion this one wins every award... best of the best. Chocolate/coffee with licorice finish... and molasses all over... amazing.."
"Pitch black body. Thick and dense dark brown head. Lacing is quite full. Aroma is chock full of great stuff: chocolate, roast, char, molasses, anise and tobacco. Very complex flavor profile. Nice black licorice/roasted malt bitterness combo. Char is pretty big. Baker's chocolate. And dark fruits...plums, black cherry, etc... I really like the anise oil/licorice/molasses characteristic in the flavor that lingers long after. Body is medium or so. Carbonation is prickly, but light. Nice. Very good beer."
"This beer is easily one of the most enjoyable and drinkable beers I have had. One word to describe the aroma, taste and mouthfeel? Smooth. Incredibly well balanced flavors, and an out of this world mouthfeel. Also it completely hides 11% ABV which really just makes it dangerously drinkable."
"Rich, rich, rich. Truly all I can say. Amazing mouthfeel, masks an impressive abc. Dark head fortold of what was to come. Picked up molasses, coffee, and heavy roasted flavors. Poured too cold, let it warm and open and you will be rewarded. Does make you want o keep drinking it but, more than a 7.5 glass would have been too much."
"Pours dark and molasses with an evolving explosion of flavor in the glass bordering on decadence. More nectar than beer. Sinfully delicious and beguiling in its complexity, with hints of chocolate, anise, bourbon and coconut. Merely sublime. A beer to be sought and cherished."
"I only ask for strength not to pre-emptively crack the precious few I have left, but it leaves me with a mission to hunt this down and cellar as many as I can. Good hunting my friends."
"Time after time, this beer always stands out, I will look forward to the next time."
"The one major fault of this beer is that the label says part of the beer was aged in Bourbon barrels. Absoulutely no sign of it in the aroma or flavor. If I could of tasted it, this would of been a perfect 5 in flavor. Drinking great now, no need to age this fine stout."
"Drinkability: This has been in the fridge for a year and i'm so happy that it wasn't an infected bottle. Very drinkable beer. Just bought a 2010 edition...guess i should find some more."
"D - This is a very nice sipper and a great after dinner dessert drink. Although I was expecting more flavors that I've had in so many other stouts, this is a huge coffee heavy stout. This is pretty good considering the only other Abyss I've had was an infected 2009 but this isn't bad."
"D-The other day I had this and I told Big Hugey that I thought Darkness was better. I don't think so anymore. It's splitting hairs but if I had to pick one I think I would go with this. Incredible beer and reasonable priced too. If it was more available I would drink the shit out of this."
"$11.99 - brewers and breweries take note."
"D: Best beer I've had since the Oak Aged Yeti. Absolutely worth $10 for a 22oz bottle."
"Definitely good, though with it this fresh, I can definitely see this one improving with age (It's even dated as ""Best After 11/15/11", but I figured since I had 2 I'd try one now and one in a year or two). The flavors need a bit of time to integrate, the body could slim down a hair, and the alcohol, while not hot, could be a little smoother."
"An uninfected and aged 2009 Abyss is a very, very good beer. I would not mind having one of these to split every single night..."
"A great beer for sure. Complex with the roast and chocolate blending with the wood and bourbon."
"Full bodied and perfectly carbonated beer, rich and creamy but not overwhelming in its delivery of flavor. Lasting finish makes this a sip and savor, a beer to spend a long night with, to enjoy its complex and deep flavor. Need more bottles of the 2010 to hang onto and see how it develops over the years."
"Cheers!"
"The Abyss is everything an Imperial Stout should be. Has a great aroma of chocolate, bourbon, malts, slight coffee etc. Creamy flavor with an outstanding amount of drinkability. The ABV is masked very well. I couldn't even tell how much alcohol was in this baby. I've had the 2009 and the 2010 is drinking much better in my opinion."
"This is the beer, I had hoped it would be. Perfect. I poured the 2010 22 oz bomber into my 16 oz snifter. Poured as black as it gets, with this amazing brown 3 inch sticky head. Lacing stays around awhile. The smell chocolate, coffee, hint of oak. Taste is like it smells, thick, but amazingly drinkable for 11%. Every sip was some how better then the previous. Having this beer in my hand for the start of 2011, will always be remembered. I'm glad my wife got me two."
"Saved the best for last,rang inthe new year with this bad boy.Poured into a snifter deep and dark but not quite opaque,just a tinge of deep ruby when held close to the light,a creamy and very sticky deep mocha colored head atop that nver really left.Deep mocha coffee and vanilla tinged oak in the nose,I also picked up some roasted nut and dark fruit.Bitter chocolate and molasses flavor really hit from the onset,as it warms licorice really comes thru as well.An awesome creamy feel to the beer really coats the mouth and it goes down with ease.What a great sipper,just so much flavor and a creamy feel made me wanna drink another 22oz!A beer more than worthy of its lofty status."
"What else can be said, you can get lost in this beer. Buy a warehouse, and start filling it with this beer."
"I can definitely see why this beer would become better with age, and I can't wait to try it again down the road. An amazing Imperial Stout that truly lives up to it's reputation."
"A very slow drinker and definitely a sipper. Our bottle, split 3 ways, lasted between 45 minutes and an hour. The flavors keep you coming back for more and also make you want to take your time to enjoy the complexity of the beer."
"Notes: Honestly, I was a little disappointed with this beer. I'm a big fan of big stouts, so I expected to be a big fan of this beer. However, the flavors seemed a little harsh in the wrong places. I have another bottle, and will give this beer another chance after a year of aging."
"I swear the lights dimmed as I poured this beer, its darkness is that intense. Three inches of rich caramel foam cap the beer, and while lacing is good, the head fades away a bit quickly. Aside from the requisite slab of dark chocolate, the only other flavor to shine through in the nose is a faint, but distinct spiciness. It almost reminds me of a less intense version of the recent Stone IRS 10th Anniversary Greg Koch blend. There's a bit more to this beer though, as my tasting notes have the various flavors at play as (in order of intensity) dark chocolate, espresso, spice, and licorice. I can only guess the spiciness is from the hops, and it's remarkable that there is this much presence left this late in the ballgame. I'm pleased to see that licorice is deployed as an ancillary flavor, as I'm not a big fan of it in heavy doses. The mouthfeel is spot on, incredibly rich body without becoming syrupy, thanks to the support of a subdued but effective level of carbonation. I'm thrilled my first bottle of Abyss was devoid of infection, and while I hope the same is true of my other '09, it's probably a good idea to stock up on some '10, becasuee this is a hell of a beer."
"Notes - I will cellar the other bottle for a couple of years and see what differences I see. Thank you gkunkle for the opportunity."
"A very good tasting and smooth drinking beer that matches well to its alcohol content too. Not my favorite interpretation of the style but a very well done brew."
"700th review! Had a bottle of this as a dessert at Bar Crudo in San Francisco. This was a 2009 bottle and I do remember reading something about infections in this, but no issues here. Pours pitch black with thin brown head. Nice lacing. The beer just looks really thick. Smell is wonderfully complex for an imperial stout - roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, vanilla and oak. Quite a sweet flavour, with some bitterness in there. Thick, smooth mouthfeel. One of the best stouts I've ever had."
"Believe the hype, this is a fantastic beer. I bet this gets amazing in a year, not sure if I'm willing to risk my second bottle to infection."
"D - This beer is remarkably drinkable, especially for such a huge stout. Big, full flavored, dry and enjoyable, this is one of the best offerings of Abyss in years."
"I don't get many opportunities to try beers are in BA's top 5, my last was Alesmith's Speedway Stout, and I put this right up there with that old chestnut. Beautiful!"
"Very delicious and probably my favorite vintage of Abyss so far."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: I would call this beer between medium and full bodied, and probably leaning towards medium. Light for my taste. Carbonation is very low though, still leading to a pretty creamy mouthfeel. Overall, a very good imperial stout. Nice job by Deschutes offering a barrel aged stout that is great and readily available. My only complaint is the relative lack of barrel characteristics."
"As far as complexity...this is comparable to KBS for sure, but they are just too different from each other to compare in terms of which is better."
"EDIT- I've had several 2009 vintages and none were infected. A bit on the flat side, but similar profile as 2010, though not as complex as 2007 vintage."
"Cocoa notes to it. Tastes like dark chocolate with some brewers licorice and a hint of old coffee. Truly delicious - definitely a beer to impress. Has a very creamy mouthfeel but is also a bit boozy. This was a fresh 2010 bottle but I would love to have it again in a year and see what happens. Drinkable but a bit strong."
"would definitely like to get a few more abyss and age them out a little more and see how they benefit from it."
"NB - Drank a bottle of this in May of 2010, and another in December 2010, both 2009 vintage. The one with less age was more sweet with hotter booziness; the one with more age was more balanced, drier, and the alcohol was much less noticeable. This review is based on the December tasting."
"A: 4.0, S: 4.0, T: 4.0, M: 4.0, D: 4.0 = A"
"Overall this beer had some interesting flavors that I felt were not well balanced. The licorice and molasses combined with the hop bitterness did not meld well for my pallet. There was not enough oak flavor for me. Some reviewers have said that they prefer this low oakiness to other over-oaked stouts, but for me it was too subtle, or perhaps just overpowered by the licorice, molasses and hop flavors. I wish it would have had more time in the barrel or a higher proportion of barrel aged beer in the blend. This said, I would like to save a bottle in the cellar for 1-3 years to see if the flavors become more harmonious with age."
"Yeah, that hot alcohol is a downer. But don't let that put a dampener on this otherwise damn fine gargantuan beer."
"Hmmm... there's a distinctive cherry flavor than I haven't picked up in this beer in the past, which makes you consider developing infection. Still a good beer, but doesn't inspire much confidence in the remaining bottles of 2009 I have. Score reflects both this bottle and previous ones. I did find myself bumping up the score as the bottle had more time to open up and will readjust after trying aged 2010."
"Into a tulip, it poured black, with two fingers of dark mocha-colored head that retained and laced excellently. No visible carbonation. Bodaciously huge chocolate nose, yet intertwined with mocha, vanilla, and molasses. The great thing about the taste is that I think I detected something different at each sip; very varied and complex, despite the fact that the dark chocolate flavor will bash you over the head. Bittersweet chocolate, Nestle Quik powder, anise, molasses, vanilla, and mocha/coffee, with a semi-dry coffee finish. Excellent flavor progression and balance. The feel was on the thick side, yet velvet smooth, and it provided an appropriate backdrop for the flavor profile. Definitely not a session beer, but an outstanding sipper. I was blown away by this beer. Twice."
"D - Right up there with KTG, tried my best to sip and enjoy but had a hard time with it. Goes down so easy and really coats the palate nicely. My first from Deschutes and I am very impressed."
"This beer is the best stout I have had to date, seeing how I like it more than my previous favorite stout (abyss 09), try and get your hands on this one, it's readily available for now, but I don't know how long that will last"
"I would say this is one of the best Abyss experiences I have had. Whether fresh or aged. The nitro version is just to die for."
"UPDATE 2: 2008 bottle opened in 07/2011. Seemed to be going downhill a bit. Definitely smoother with a subtler molasses/cocoa sweetness and less alcohol burn. Paired with some chocolate that actually brought out the remaining hop presence pretty markedly. However, there were some slight metallic/cardboard flavors beginning to show, especially at colder temperatures and on the finish. I would say it's time to drink this one up."
"Overall: Outstanding batch this year. Not overly aggressive and great flavor."
"Drinkability: Simply fantastic. Maybe the best Imperial Stout I have ever had. Now I need to find another bottle to cellar."
"D: I would undoubtedly drink more, and because it's so smooth and strong this would be a dangerous proposition. I wholeheartedly approve. This will be the standard to which I hold an Imperial Stout."
"I first had the Abyss a few years ago on a ski trip to Idaho. The bar served PINTS of the stuff. I was impressed then, and I'm still impressed now. Big, tasty beer, lots of sweetness and lots of flavors to process. Seems more bourbon-y now than I remember. Good stuff!"
"D- I was really impressed with this beer. I know that the 2009 Abyss has had it's problems with infection, and I thought after the trip across the Pacific, this one had no chance. But much to my surprise, and happiness, this one had none of the characteristics of other reviewers who have had an affected bottle. If you can pick up this bottle, I would say go for it!! Wonderful complex flavors come out in this beer. One of the best I've had."
"One of the better beers of this style in my opinion. Coffee and dark chocolate smell and taste. Goood!"
"This gets smoother as it drinks. No hot alcohol notes. Some sweetness from the leftover sugars. It doesn't get much maltier than this. Outstanding imperial stout."
"this bottle is super fresh and a bit hot. I will be generous with my rating here as I can see this being more drinkable with a few months of age on it."
"Fantastic."
"D: Love this stuff, and this bottle has been sitting in my cellar since release. Only one of these left, and I'll finish it as part of my vertical next year. Wish I could find more."
"Drinkability: A great, complex imperial stout. Damn glad mine wasnt sour."
"Drinkability - considering this is a 11% abv brew the drinkability is extremely high - every sip gives you hints of complex flavors - you can taste a lot of great things in this if you enjoy it slowly very well balanced and blended brew."
"Drinkability- downed 2 4 ounce pours in no time..."
"D: good but again metallic bite and alcohol makes this a sipper"
"A very interesting beer, it was not at all what I expected. I've had a couple of imperial stouts I would say I like better, but for its uniqueness and complexity this (possibly infected) Abyss certainly stands out."
"An easy drinking stout."
"O: Almost exactly a year since this bottle was born, its near perfect. 11oz is plenty, as I would prefer a touch less booze, but its extremely drinkable and tasty right now."
"Rich and creamy from the first sip to the last, and what a great nose. Served in a snifter so all of those glorious aromas can gather in the bulb, hit your nose, and tell your brain that this is going to be a great experience! Very much a beer I will enjoy until the last keg blows! Cheers!!"
"As much as others may suggest food pairings, resist the temptation and enjoy it on it's own. It deserves your full attention."
"'08 tap (it was still boozy for some reason)"
"OH MY!!!This is a great sippin' brew for the winter season. It is amazing this year and I would definitely put it on my list of THE beer to purchase for all of my friends and family this holiday season. It's a bit sweet, smokey, rich, thick and everything an imperial stout should be. Cheers!"
"2007: if the '08 were an Oregon pinot, then '07 would be Burgundy. This vintage is smoky, velvety, yet subtle with more of the fruit and licorice notes present; also has a lot of espresso and some hints of toasty oak. My second favorite!"
"MF is good, thick, creamy, chewy. Maybe a hair lighter than some of the big hitters. Really a pretty easy drink (and super enjoyable). The smoke and roast to it balances out the sweetness in the malt nicely. This is what imperial stouts should be like."
"D - Fairly high. Opened this one last night. I figured if it was infected I would rather find out now rather than later. Luckily it was fine. I enjoyed this one a lot. It was still a little too hot for my liking but it was still very nice."
"Mouth feel is similar to another I had recently. It feels like there might be some cocoa granules in the mix. Not all that carbonated and not as ""thick"" as some others. Alcohol is not bashful. All in all I don't think this is one of the infected ones which I felt were described as being a little sour. This beer is different than most stouts I have had. It is not as sweet, but then again this one has already been around awhile. I hear rumors that Deschutes may come to the Midwest. I would like to try another one. For me to wait a year after bottling to drink a beer is rare. I am not patient."
"D> one bottle myself then maybe share another."
"D- Pretty much a drain pour. I was hoping I would be one of the lucky ones but alas, I was not. Looking forward to trying to '10 though."
"That said, it's probably one of the most complex ones I've tasted in a while, and it took a half bottle to get any type of read on what my palate should expect. It's a full-bodied brew that's mainly a sipper. One on special occasions seems just about right."
"On the whole, Abyss was okay, as far as big stouts go. I've been sipping it for a few hours now, and it's definitely not a bomber I'd drink regularly."
"Medium to full bodied, creamy, smooth,with medium carbonation. This is a superb Imperial Stout. Not much heat for an 11.00% abv beer. Thankfully this is not an infected bottle. I will be sure to pick up the 2010 Reserve when it becomes available."
"D- Great beer to start with at night or after a meal. You definitely need to share this bottle or you will be gone after you finish it all."
"This is what other Imperial stouts want to be when they grow up. I can only imagine how good this gets with age on it."
"Tap and Bottle Differences: Nothing much, except the tap had a lighter mouthfeel and stronger alcohol tones than from the bottle. Differences were minor."
"D: I've enjoyed the Abyss both fresh and aged now, and can say that it's a beer that definitely improves with time. The heat has died down and the flavors, though not quite as bright, are nicely melded. Not mind-blowing, but definitely enjoyable. Finished a whole bottle myself. Happy birthday to me!"
"Linger 4"
"16 oz pour into a pint glass instead of the 10.5 oz listed on the menu, fine with me! Poured opaque black, so black that I swear the lights got dimmer when it was poured because it could suck all the light out of a room. Caramel colored two-finger light head that had good retention for a RIS. This looked like you would expect a RIS to look like, but with a little added darkness in body and wood color in the head from the barrels. Smelled largely of vanilla, currents, chocolate and coffee. Faint earthy aromas mixed with a little booze. Tasted even better than it smelled. All of the same flavors from the nose, mostly vanilla, coffee and chocolate. Brown sugar was now noticeable along with decent floral hops to make it just bitter enough. The wood/earthy flavors pulled through a bit stronger than before, too. Bourbon in the way back, enough to compliment but not overpower. Felt thick and rich, very creamy and viscous. Coating and filmy. Low carbonation rounds out the body. Drinks incredibly easy for 11% and, thankfully, not overly boozy like I thought fresh '09 BCBS was. Maybe the year it sat mellowed it out some, but this beer was delicious and drank very well, regardless. I wanted to drink another glass because it tasted so nice and balanced but I didn't order one because I had my fill with the bigger serving size. I would love to have a bottle or two of this aging, but this is definitely one I would want to split with a friend."
"Bottle shared by footbalm. Pours a deep dark brown with a similarly brownish head. The aroma is really great; deep moss covered earth, smoke, coffee, and some sweet molasses. The taste is top notch, really complex and yet so damn smooth. As with many great beers this changes a ton with warming; first, a bitter chocolate flavor with dark fruits, vanilla, brown sugar, and smoke. Later with warming the fruit and roasted malts come to fore, so damn good. A bourbon taste for sure, along with a really great creamy body. The ABV is strong at first, then nonexistent. Wow! All it was hyped to be. Re-rate: at the 2010 Imperial Stout tasting Sam crack open the vertical, 2006-2009! 2006 was sublime, dark fruit, oily and powerful. 2007 might have stolen the show, just amazing; rich fruits, plums and figs, oily can nastiness that I love. My faith in the Abyss is 100%. 2008 and 09 are great, but waiting to peak. I had a whole fresh 2009 recently and didn't dig it as much, but after trying all vintages I know this beer is among the best, and it cellars great. Thanks a ton Sam!"
"DB- The first truly world class beer I have had since Pannepot. I found this to be a perfect blend of over the top Bourbon-aged beers like KBS and a regular RIS. The barrel aging is used perfectly and I now realize why this beer has always been in the top 5. Superb balance of a wide array of Stout flavors!"
"**Note - also was honored to try the 2007 vintage, a little over 4 years in the bottle. Definitely mellowed out on the bourbon but holding up great. Lots of flavor, smooth, alcohol well-hidden. Awesome beer."
"Thanks to my brother-in-law for bringing this all the way from Oregon. A very dark black, with a thin mocha head. Aroma is thick coffee and dark chocolate. Great dark chocolate and coffee flavors. VERY smooth and easy to drink. This is everything the hype says its is. Its a dark chocolate/coffee delight. with a hint of bourbon and cream. So easy to drink, smooth with perfect carbonation."
"A phenomenal brew"
"12/3/11: next 09 was unfortuneately infected. Drinking an 11 now and is delicious as the uninfected 09."
"(38)"
"D: Great beer, happy to be enjoying this."
"Flavor is a bit thin for the style yet offers a lingering finish. Offers a touch of the whiskey barrel as the beer warms but still remains subdued. Feel is a bit thin as well. Overall a different animal than a fresh tap pour, pleasant yet unremarkable."
"OVERALL: This was unbelievable. I was disappointed when the '09 bottle was infected, but now that I know what the Abyss is all about, the infection problems with the '09 is nothing less than a world-wide disaster. This was sublime. The base stout is fantastic as it is, and barrel aging is done in a manner that compliments the beer wonderfully, as opposed to dominating it. Lots of great, bold flavors that work really well together. This is a world class brew, and one of the best stouts I've ever had. Luckily it is relatively easy to come by, so we'll hope that this year's release is clean. Thanks again akbeerfiend for sending one of these beauties my way."
"Not the filling stout I expected."
"This is a monster beer that is hard to put down. Much easier to drink than I expected. Really an amazing brew."
"D- Good for the style. I think I could drink another bottle if I had one!"
"I just caught myself fondling the bottle. Maybe it's the booze, or maybe it's just been too long since I last put this wondrous nectar to my lips; the Abyss is certainly intoxicating, in both the literal and figurative sense. There is more to it than I alone can note and attest. If you ever find yourself staring at The Abyss, for God's sake buy the damn thing, as much as you can afford, because, true to its name, this is about as deep as beer gets."
" The taste is very flavorful right off the bat with roasted flavor that is very high -almost 'meaty' with smoked and woodiness bringing out an umami flavor with slight dark cocoa and light spice w/ vanilla adding to the flavor. There is some alcohol in the taste, but not over the top for the strength. The slight cookie flavor is nice w/ slight astringent/bitter flavor from the highly roasted malts. I enjoyed this way more than the '09, a great Imperial Stout which is very solid and I am glad I got to re-review it. I feel the light infection detracts both from the taste/body so this is way better worthy of its high ranking here and it is more enjoyable in its unfettered form."
"O: This is simply a beautiful beer. It's thick, rich, and strong enough that I couldn't have too much of this in a sitting, but that's not really the point of this beer. It's one to be sipped slowly over the course of the evening, and what an evening it was!"
"There are a bunch of adjectives I could throw down here but I'll just use one: Magnificent. A work of art."
"D - Way too smooth for being 11% alcohol, my portion was gone quickly."
"D: Dangerously drinkable for the high ABV."
"This is my third tasting of this beer and I'm having trouble remembering the others after tasting this. It's one of the tastiest stouts I've had in a while. Up there with Older Vis and Black Albert easily."
"D: The 11%'s not too debilitating. This is 'big' yet drinkable. Me likey!"
"5-4.5-4-4.5-4.5 (total score adjusted accordingly)"
"Had a 2009 bottle thanks to Speakorspasm. I was surprised to find a balanced sour or brett character. Overall the beer is a mix of smooth, sweet chocolate with herbal lemon sour character. In the background there's toast, bitter black grains and more molasses in the aroma. I'm not always a huge fan of the style, as I find most of the beers to be heavy, and while tasting, uninteresting. This, however, is very quaffable, and enjoyable. This is a delicious and fun beer to drink. It has a balanced share of lambic character with an imperial stout background."
"D-Simply amazing for the ABV."
"On a side note, there were a lot of infections reported for the '09 batch. This is the fourth I've had from my case and I'm very happy to say that none have been infected, so the rest will be put down for enjoyment over the next few years."
"D: Like I stated before, very smooth. When I got to the bottom of my glass, I actually wanted a bit more."
"This bottle is infected. It is not a complete loss, but I am let down that it didn't age as it was supposed to."
"I highly recommend this beer, take it slow, feel it out as it changes temperature, as the head dissipates, you'll probably agree with the hundreds of other reviewers giving this beer an A+ rating."
"I have had this on many occasions. I do not rate like most people because most people do not really read other people's ratings. I have had the privaledge of having this beer multiple times and the best thing about it is the price. It is a top rated beer and the price is stil low. Some of these pricey beers are rated way lower and seems to me that this is the way to go..."
"D-Drinkiability is amazing and flawless...this beer leaves me speechless... believe the hype."
"D: Maybe the most drinkable 11% beer I've had. The bourbon is suttle enough that I believe this is a heavy handed sipper."
"2009 vintage. Finally decided to bust this outta the fridge so's VDubb86 and I could determine if infection had set in. It pours a bulletproof onyx topped by over a finger of tan foam. No over-fizzing, which bodes well. The nose comprises blackened pretzels, light charcoal, anise, brown sugar, leather, and tobacco. No real sour notes in my 'strils, which, again, bodes well. The taste holds notes of cocoa powder, dark chocolate wedges, bourbon, oak, leather, charcoal, blackened biscuits, and a very slight tart edge pricking the tongue in the back, the only real sign of what appears to be a minor infection. Boo. It doesn't really detract from the proceedings, thankfully, more like a stronger version of the famous Guinness sour. The body is on the lighter side of hefty, with a light moderate carbonation and a fizzily chewy feel (which confirms the minor infection). Overall, I was definitely underwhelmed with this. Sure, the infection could have influenced things, but it seemed much too minor to really affect the overall package too much. Beyond the tartness, it just wasn't as incredible a stout as many had led me to believe. Oh well, it was still much more than decent, and I'm glad I was able to try it."
"It pours the black abyss that is its namesake. Affixed atop is a nice brown head that sticks around. The smell is of cocoa, bourbon, and a bit of sour. I know that there is infection problems with this beer, but there doesn't seem to be very strong and the lengthy refrigeration time seems to have kept it at bay. The taste is mainly of mocha at the very onset, but the strong bourbon flavor takes over. The good part is the bourbon isn't astringent at all and goes down as a very smooth portion of the beer. Other components of the flavor include licorice, butterscotch, char, and smoked oak. In addition to all of that there is an odd tartness to the back with is ruining the outstanding flavor. I can only assume that it is because of the infection that is peeking out after being kept at bay in the cold temperatures. That really ruined the mouthfeel for me. It is still very drinkable despite the high ABV. I'd recommend getting one, but don't overpay for a 2009."
"I would have trouble saying anything bad about any of Deschutes' beers. A fantastic beer and one of my favorite IS's."
"D: I have already posted hoping to get more!"
"Interestingly, it says it is brewed with licorice and molasses. Noticed little molasses and no licorice aywhere. Oh, well."
"I hope I get to try the 2010 version (without the chance of it being infected). I will revisit this beer at that time and review it again. Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with this one. I've had many better stouts... Then again, I wasn't wild about KBS either."
"Cheers!"
"d - Overall I thought this was a great stout. I thought it smelled amazing and I enjoyed every aspect of this beer. I was really glad this one wasn't infected and look forward to drinking more of it."
"Drinkability - The 22oz bottle wasn't enough. I want more. Yeah, the this is beer geek heaven for most. But me, well yeah. It's heaven."
"Have had every batch of this beer. This review comes from my 2008 notes on the 2007 batch. This beer lives up to the hype. Pours like motor oil with a large, tight, dark brown head that leaves tons of lacing covering a pitch black body. Aroma has lots of rich chocolate, vanilla, some oak, and licorice. Taste is amazing. Like drinking slightly bitter chocolate syrup. Very mouth-coating. Slightly burnt, but very rich and full with vanilla and licorice notes. I love it!"
"This was a lovely stout and I did drink it slowly, but it certainly wasn't a chore to drink. I finished the whole bottle and started thinking of how I could trade for more when I was finished."
"I'm not sure if this is borderline sour, or just the strong brewer's licorice getting to me. I like it, either way. A lot."
"2009 bottle, big thanks to Matt. Pours black with a deep mocha head that settles to a fine lacing. Nose is a tight collage of dark malt, bourbon, ash, and vanilla. A bit of coffee creeps into the flavor, which is focused on the ash with a light bourbon backing. Fairly bitter in the finish. This is a nice, refined package. I'm still trying to get the taste of the horrid Mikkeler Black Hole (Red Wine) out of my mouth, which was a drain pour and a lost $14. This serves the purpose, and it's quite a good imperial stout without any blaring features but quite a nice, balanced package for the style."
"The lightened body and dry finish probably help make this easier to drink, to an extent. In any event, the beer isn't so badly infected yet that you wouldn't be able to drink it. I could see finishing off the bomber without too much trouble."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, sugary, chewy, boozy, and outright delicious. Molasses sweetness resounds in the finish."
"This was still a good beer with the infection, it would have been interesting to try this infected bottle with another year or two for the little guys to work, just for fun, since it's only lightly working it's presence right now. But it is better in it's un-infected form."
"Drinkability: Even with some ""flaws"" this is a very enjoyable beer that I will be looking for some 2010 Vintage when it comes out."
"D: A great sipper. I went a little quick with it but something good to have at the end of the day. Some more age will help this one out I think."
"Drinkabilty - Being so strong at 11% i honestly wouldnt want to drink the whole 22 oz bottle myself. I was a little disapointed in this beer cause the smoked whiskey flavor is overpowering to me and takes away from all the beer has. I would like to try this again fresh but i for sure am not going to spend 25-30$ for this."
"Dark like Fight Club, just damn dark. First whiff - coffee, roasts, chocolate, licorice. Hence the name, Abyss basically takes your palate to the deepest, darkest recesses of the flavor planet. I mean its like a machine gun of bitter/dar chocolate, coffee, and dark caramel. Man, this is just a good beer its ridiculous. This, a piece of chocolate cake from Bar Tartine, man, in heaven. Drinkability? Well, lets say if you can drink more than 1 and be ""okay," I'd like to shake your hand."
"Due to the aforementioned bitter flavors I am hesitant to rate this high in the drinkability dept. Also the alcohol isn't really too subtle in this one. I was surprised at the seemingly low 11%."
"Drink ability goes down smooth enough that you can finish your glass with out even realizing. Like a good Italian wine you don't feel a thing until you stand up. I would gladly drink it all night long... and the hang over would be well worth it."
"Note- I had the 09 version and while not too many signs of it being infected I didn't like it nearly as much- lacking in flavor and body compared to the 08 vintage."
"D- It's a shame that more people can't enjoy something this good. Believe the hype, this is a very special beer and thanks to my buddy I've got 1 more left in the cellar. I'm not much of a smoker, but a cigar is calling my name with the last couple of sips."
"What this beer lacks in body, near medium, it more than makes up for with the soft carbonation and near pillowy mouthfeel, which worked best before reaching room temperature."
"D: A bit heavy to get great drinkability, but this brew has it all so for the ABV and the intensity, toss it out the window, this beer is the best."
"Drinkability through the roof for the style that is! Shared with a friend and wanted more for sure."
"M/D - This is a luxurious sipper; it is not the thickest in terms of viscosity, but it makes up for it with more-than-ample velvety creaminess."
"D: This is probably my favorite vintage of Abyss, and with good reason. So many great flavors and so easy to drink. It's really too bad this year's developed an infection."
"Well, I have been hearing rumors of an unwanted sour taste in this beer...turns out in my tasting notes that belgian tarty yeast flavor is not supposed to be there :( I did find it very odd in this style...now I know why..."
"All in all, I didn't enjoy this bottle and it took me hours to drink. But, to be fair, I think that may be my fault - I opened it before the best by date. This is from the '09 vintage, which has developed a reputation for being infected - however, I did not notice any problems with this bottle. I simply didn't care much for it. I'll have to try an aged bottle some time."
"The mouthfeel is definitely one of the thicker imperial stouts I've had, but not quite as thick as Dark Lord. Carbonation is on the lower side which I also like. Great mouthfeel overall for my tastes. Drinkability is very good, it had some fantastic flavors to it and was very well balanced between the sweet chocolaty and the roasted bitterness. Excellent beer overall and an excellent choice to drink by candle light in my dark powerless house."
"This is an amazingly large beer that pours jet black with an extremely large head that is dark caramel in color. The nose is packed with large dark roasted malts, java beans, big dark fruits and some oak is present. The taste is amazing, it is big, sweet and loaded with roasted malts, lots of dark cherry notes, coffee, molasses, oak tannins, lots of licorice and a nice bitter extremely anise like resin coating my mouth with lots of really interesting layers ranging from pine, oak, java, roasted malts, and burnt oak. The mouthfeel is really amazing. All of the resiny goodness of this beers just dances through my palate and makes me want and take another sip. I really enjoyed my '09 Abyss, I saw no signs of infection and really hope my other bottle is as clean. Overall this is an extremely aggressive beer with a lot nuances that will most likely become more present with age."
"SkÅL!"
"Overall: What a fantastic beer. This is one very well balanced American Beauty!! Came 3rd in our beertasting after the magical stormaktsporters, but let's be honest, loosing from the best Imperial stouts on the planet is still an achievement! Lives up the hype!"
"D - I've heard some nightmares about infected bottles but I've had several and all have been superb. This is a fantastic beer with lots and lots of character. I've only got one more and I'm already regretting not picking up more when I had the chance. If there's any question that aging can make certain beers better, this is the proof."
"D - Incredibly drinkable. After each sip, I immediately wanted to go back for more to see what other flavors were there. I didn't even notice the alcohol as I made my way through this monster."
"This is an insanely drinkable beer. Lots of depth of flavor. I declare this bottle uninfected."
"Overall, I am a little bit disappointed by this beer. I really thought that I was going to escape from the infection that everyone was talking about. As I finished up the bottle it became harder and harder to drink because I really could pick out the lactic funky taste. For a future reference I will be searching out other vintages of this beer because a lot of people have had great things to say about it and I would love to know how it taste fresh. If you come across this beer in any other vintage you should definitely give it a try and let me know what you think, as for the 2009 version all I can say is that you are taking a gamble on getting a bogus bottle"
"Overall, I would like to thank strikertown for the trade. He is an excellent trader, and has been patient while I work out my broken package with FedEX. Thanks again man~!"
"Does it get much better than this? Because, if it does, I have not found it yet! This has got to be one the best beers I have ever drank and it will only get better over time! I am fortunate enough to not have gotten an infected bottle, so I could really enjoy everything that this beer has to offer. If you have a chance, obtain this beer, you will not be disappointed!!!"
"My brother and I decided we should crack this one due to all the recent reports of this beer being infected. So, I'm drinking the 2009 vintage which my brother graciously poured into a tulip for me. Pours with a big three finger head atop a pitch black body. Lots of large bubbles in this tan head. Smell is a chocolatey nose with a very faint hint of barrel aging. Darks malts shadow a subtle sweet aroma of molasses. The smell is good, but I feel like I really have to take big whiffs to get anything out of it. Everything just seems a bit faint. So i'll go ahead and say it now. I don't think I have an infected bottle. This taste pretty nice. A big bitter espresso taste to this one. The flavors are on, but I feel like I'm not getting as much out of the taste as I did the nose. It finishes with an oaky bourbon taste and leaves me to scrape the roof of my mouth with my tongue. It reminds me of an amateur french press where coffee grinds are left in the last sip. The finish burns a little bit, but bourbon aging and eleven percent makes this not surprising. Not the best mouthfeel but the carbonation is very nice and this sips nicely in front of the Red Sox."
"I'm just going to order another one.. only one more I promise. Actually funny story my friends tried to leave and I just snuck back into the place and ordered another one. Then they all did... Good times."
"I'll try another bottle in 3 mos and see if it has changed, but I think it is not infected, just a slightly more sour version."
"Big thanks to BigTomZ for this one! 2009 Vintage, this one was mildly infected. Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Pours black with a massive tan head that remains throughout. Maintains phenomenal lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt and a tart note (first sign of infection). The flavor was of syrup, licorice, malt, and a slight tart taste (also due to infection). It was medium on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a nice beer even though it was infected. Goes down smooth regardless of that fact as well. Would love to try a non-infected bottle to be able to give it a true rating of its capabilities (hint hint traders...)"
"Overall, a wonderful sipper. Very tasty. Complex. Decadent."
"Recent quality issues aside, Abyss deserves all of the accolades it has been bestowed. Great depth of flavor, especially with the inclusion of the licorice. The barreling is done with such a delicate touch that it accentuates what's already going on instead of just adding another layer of flavors. Won't risk tracking a new bottle, but I can't wait until the 2010 batch!"
"I remember having this on tap when it was fresh last year and having a wholly different experience (of course, that batch was probably not affected by the problems of the bottled '09). I have another bottle cellared so I'm looking forward to trying it again in a year or so to see what's happened to it."
"All in all, I was somewhat expecting the infection, but it's certainly not an unpleasant experience for me at all. If I was rating solidly to style, this would take a bit of a hit, but it still wouldn't be bad - it could certainly pass as a ""historical interpretation", as the lactic is certainly not at all overwhelming. However, this isn't a homebrewing competition, so I'm not - I'm rating on how enjoyable I think it is, and I must say, this is pretty intriguing. I really ended up loving this beer."
"D: Surprisingly not terrible. This infected batch is somewhat drinkable, yet a far cry from what Abyss should be. I can see some people being into sour cherried Abyss, even if just for the sake of novelty. Ill update my review in the future."
"The taste was fairly consistent from the top to bottom of the bottle, I couldn't notice much difference. The smooth, rich flavor made this a great beer to me."
"Top notch Imperial Stout worth trying (2010 vintage is in a league above subsequent vintages)."
"I have been saving this bottle for a year and a half and am glad that I waited this long to try it out. This beer has definately lived up to the hype and this is one the best tasting/overall presentation beers that I have had the opportunity to drink. I have several 09's sitting and I am convinced that the longer I wait to open the better tasting they will be. This is the epitomy of a beer that gets better with age and I can now see/taste why this beer is so highly rated."
"D: While this beer is best enjoyed in smaller servings because of its rich flavors and high alcohol content, it is a pleasure to drink. Among other beers of this style, The Abyss really stands out as an example of restraint, balance, and sheer deliciousness. While this is a big beer, it is not trying to be extreme as many other imperial stouts seem. This beer begs to be sipped alongside the most decadent of chocolate desserts."
"D - Mellow and enjoyable. This is a delicious stout, but I'd rank it below Kate et al. I'd love the opportunity to try this a bit younger, too."
"D - A solid, drinkable stout. Lends to a slower tasting because of its complexity, need time to sort out all the flavors. But just a wonderful stout. I need a steak dinner to go with it."
"d- i'm just so glad i got a clean bottle... my first abyss and it was great. obviously it could have benefited from cellaring, ""best after 11/1/2010," but still a pretty incredible beer. to all the ba's that ended up drain pouring, my heartfelt apologies. let's hope for an all clean 2010 batch."
"MF/D: tingles the mouth and coats the throat with flavor, a beer of the highest quality though i would cellar my next bottle for longer."
"Two plus fingers of dark brown head, despite the mixture of all bubble sizes, excellent retention and you barely see movement across the surface, yet it eventually settles closer to the surface a few minutes later, leaves a hodgepodge of lacing streaks like paint splattered against a wall. True to the category, pure black liquid, nothing more to say. Punishingly thick nose of black licorice, dark chocolate, toffee, coconut oil, vanilla bean, plum, prune, black cherry, sweet tea leaves, those fake candy orange peel gel candies, overall the roast is tamed to allow perfect balance in your nostrils and reduce the ""flash"" factor. Full-bodied, but some sips come across as medium-bodied which is an achievement in itself, given the ""bigger and bigger"" mentality today. Espresso bean, dark chocolate, vanilla extract, caramel, maple syrup and coconut establish the oak presence, sweet while also toasty, covers the full territory from tongue saturation to inner mouth perfume. The licorice starts to come on along with orange reduction and floral musk. There's an underlying graininess as well as suggestion of cayenne. I don't know jack about rumors regarding this 2009 version but this is benchmark brew."
"Overall, they should refer to this as 2009 ""The Wild"" Abyss. Thankfully for Deschutes their brew is so amazing, that even with a mistake causing an infection, it was still pretty good."
"O: Still an amazing beer but not my favorite vintage. Don't get me wrong, this is world-class, but I like it with a little less age."
"D: While the bubbles were bad for the mouthfeel it made up for it with the drinkability. Like I said the beer urges you take take another sip. The taste isnt crazy powerful and full bodied to make this a huge sipper. I'd imagine this one would sneak up on me pretty fast if I were to take down the whole bottle by myself. Good stuff"
"D - Could be better. Sad this isn't turning out to be a good year for this beer, as it's the first time I bought a lot of bottles of it."
"The appearance was pretty standard for an imperial stout. There was nothing too special but it looked good. It poured a smooth, yet viscous, midnight black with some sediment in the pour. There was a slight khaki head that laced the glass. It smelled of coffee, oak, and chocolate with some slight sweetness to it. As for the taste, it had a slightly oaky chocolatey bitterness. There was perhaps a scent of vanilla as well. The mouthfeel was good but nothing too special either. There was medium carbonation to go with the full body. The alcohol wasn't present in the taste at all, which was surprising. As for drinkability, I wasn't blown away by the Abyss. In fact, I was a little disappointed. I expected it to be more than it was, mainly due to it's reputation as a top ten beer. It was good, but didn't live up to the hype."
"O: Worth the wait, and worth the effort to track it down."
"I guess the rumor is true, the 2009 Abyss batch has gone bad. I am truly disappointed as this was my first Abyss ever and I was eagerly awaiting drinking it."
"Note: I opened a bottle 3 months ago upon purchase with no signs of infection. Only difference was a little more alcohol ""heat"". Scores balanced against both tastings."
"This one stands tall in the imperial stout category. I think the reason people love it is it doesn't get over the top with the sweetness."
"Drinkability:This 2009 beer is Best After 11/1/2010, and could definitely use more aging. As the beer is still young, it makes sense that the bourbon is on the heavy side, but still an enjoyable sipping beer."
"This is my opinion of how an Imperial Stout should taste and ranks as one of the most enjoyable I've ever had for the style. Too bad this beer is so hard to get, I wish I lived closer to the brewery! Every sip was savored in a snifter, simply amazing and not one of those overrated beers. It's not too often I get this excited about a beer, definitely worthy of its prestigeous status."
"Cheers..."
"Pours a jet black with a coffee colored head. The head was very minimal and reduced to a film. Smells of bitter chocolate and sweet licorice. Smells a bit weak for my tastes. Taste is another story. This one explodes with licorice, chocolate and a nice burn of bourbon. This beer is quite bitter and I am finding it very enjoyable. This is extremely tasty. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I am used to for the style, but I actually prefer it. This is so tasty that it raises the drinkability despite the strength. Overall an excellent beer."
"4.5 D: The barleywines and RISs of my cellar rejoice. Their comrad has not been subdued by illness, but rather by Emporer DavoleBomb, who chuckles with delight as another great brew has done his bidding. Lots of great stuff going on with this one. I dare say this is better than the 08. One day an epic vertical will decide the true victor."
"2009 vintage. Had to try one of these tonight, based on the recent thread. Pours jet black, with a huge rocky mocha colored head, which stays with the beer throughout. I initially get a very, very slight funky/sour smell, along with wood, charcoal, molasses and black licorice. Very smooth, with flavors of dark chocolate, black licorice, bourbon and charred oak. This one seems to have mellowed a bit over the last seven months or so, and is becoming a pretty solid beer."
"The body of this beer is much lighter than I expected. Perhaps it is the sterotypical assumption that dark beers have more body. Or possibly it was the incorporation of molasses that made me think this would be heavy...regardless it isn't. It is more of a middle of the road medium bodied brew than thick and viscous as I expected. The carbonation is pretty much spot on. Drinkability is about as good as it gets for a beer of this magnitude. This is a good one to sit down and enjoy over a length of time or share with some friends. I look forward to enjoying it again."
"O - This is truly a great beer. I'm glad that I bought a few; I might even go back to buy another half a case. Can't wait to see what a year or two will do for it."
"Pours a deep dark brown almost black color. Nose was dark chocolate and raisin. Almost conflicting tastes that really bring the flavor alive. Dark chocolate up front with a slightly tart raisin following closely behind. Although these aren't normally my style I find myself craving another glass. Wonderful..."
"Pours a dark black color with a caramel colored head. Has an aroma of dark fruit, chocolate, and alcohol. Has a sweet taste. More watery and alcohol biting up front. Then turns more malty and chocolaty on the back end. 2009 Vintage. Needs some aging. Too harsh and not worthy of a BA top 5 spot."
"Pours a black hole of deep rich brown color, with milk chocolate, vanilla and a hint of raisin on the nose. Dark chocolate, cocoa powder, burnt sugar & cinnamon all make appearances in the taste. Oily & syrup-like in texture. Haven't tried any other vintages of this beer, but the 2007 seems to be doing quite well. Tasty!"
"HV"
"Picked up one of the last bottles at Whidbey Beer Works in Oak Harbour Wa. Drank it that night with Dad on vacation. When I opened the bottle ( the wax sucks to open) it at first let me down since the intial sips had metallic notes in the finish. With all the hype I wanted this beer to blow me away but things were starting off rough. Thankfully it warmed up and the metallic notes disappeared replace with a long luscious chocolate note mixed in with vanilla and dark malts. The nose also was inviting and complex. End result a great beer though not the best in the style I have tried. Maybe I should have taken it home and put it in the cellar?"
"D: If you are going to drink the style this is a must!"
"Off the tap and into the tulip, abysss looks black in the glass, dark night black, blackness, just like a stout. A firm inch of dark khaki brown foam on top with a milkshake consistancy. Smells include a nice big roasty presence mixed in with some chocolate and licorice with a slight presence of the oak aging, not much of the bourbon comes through. It's not the boldest nose, I'll admit. Taste picks things up with dark roasted malt goodness combined with some chocolate and light vanilla. Some anise squirts along with dark licorice. Mollases up front and not hop forward, there is some hint of em though. Off the tap this stuff is great, the feel is not as big as something of this stature should be. It went down all to smooth. Not overly sweet, or overly hopped, well balanced. A big body with nice light carb. If I was not driving I would of stayed longer and had a glass more, but no more than that. It's big, it needs to be respected."
"Very drinkable. The alcohol doesn't burn through ever, and it's not too heavy at all. If your tolerance can deal, you can drink a lot of this. Of course at 11% you might have to get a 2nd liver."
"D- for a beer of this depth of flavor, boldness, and abv this is amazingly drinkable. I've had the bottle but on draft is crazy."
"Quite drinkable. Not much bourbon presence, unfortunately."
"The taste is great, however. It has some very definite coffee and chocolate undertones, as well as a bitterness I can't quite put my finger on - perhaps leather? I'm really not getting any bourbon at all, my dad claims to pick up on some though so maybe my sense of taste just isn't acute enough to pick up on it. Mouthfeel is great, just what you would want from an imperial stout. It coats my mouth completely and I can taste it long after I take a drink. Great beer overall, if you get a chance to try it don't pass it up!"
"It tastes like it smells. Mildly charred malt flavors and a little coffee...kind of salty. Way less boozy in the taste, not much bourbon. I like a lot of bourbon barreled beers, but the barrel and bourbon always seem to be dominant. While classic bourbon flavor wasn't there, some residue sweetness was there along with hints of wood...It was good but not great. Assuming they make a 2010 release I'd go try a bottle of that too, but I don't think I'd line my shelves with it."
"On tap at Enoteca in Post Falls, ID Black gold. Pours dark and intimidating with a thick dark head. Aroma is powerful. Strong malts and determined hops, very smokey with lots of roasted barley. Flavor is intense. Robust roasted malts, wood, leather, smoke, coffee, and chocolate. At 11%abv you'd think the alcohol would be overpowering but you'd wrong. It's masterfully hidden behind a monster malt backbone and a clever wall of hops. Still, this should come with a warning about operating heavy equipment after consuming."
"The Abyss doesn't pour nearly black or syrupy enough to be called ""the abyss"". Black with dark brown highlights, dark brown head. It's definitely a very dark beer, but I've seen thicker and darker. Smell is a bit muted, especially considering we were drinking it at cellar temp. Roasted coffee and roasted malt, a bit of wood but I don't get any bourbon in the nose. Straight ethanol when you get your nose way down in there. Very roasty and particularly bitter flavor. Roasted malt and coffee, a bit of oakiness but nothing that identifies itself as a bourbon barrell. A taste I can't put my finger on that must be the licorice. A taste that I can put my finger that I have to describe as soy sauce. I appreciate that it has a subtle oakiness but doesn't taste like chewing on woodchips that have been soaked in bourbon like some barrel aged beers do. Lingering roasty bitterness in the finish. I like this 33% aging and mixing idea they used here, I think it makes for a complex beer that doesn't end up overpowered by the barrel flavors. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy with a lot of warmth. Its really not all that sweet compared to some other imp stouts, resulting in a high drinkability for me personally."
"The mouth-feel is great, just thick enough with the carb helping cut through the heaviness of the brew."
"D: had the oppotunity to try this one twice and both times were fabulous. Hopefully I can get my hands on some more."
"D: I could make this a sessionable beer if I could find enough of it and it were a little less expensive"
"D: Easily put down the hatch, but I prefer to savor the flavor. I'd like to age my next bottle to full maturity."
"D: I could have had more but after my first glass I was done with this."
"Unlike so many of the beers in this tasting from this past week, this beer had the best balance of carbonation and flavor. the malt really sticks out well in the beer. Although this would really be better after a year or so of cellaring. The beer was not super strong on the alcohol end. It is drinkable now, but I think it would be perfectly balanced in about two years. Hops came out a bit in the attack of the beer but were quickly covered up by the thick malty base of this beer. I won't write this one off to 100% beer-hype but there is a lot of talk about a good stout here, and that's just it. I think it needs to age to be a Great Stout."
"With the beer being this great at 6 months, I cannot wait to give it a go at a year or older!"
"Tasty!"
"Summary: I seriously need to try this one again after it has some age on it. Although I can't imagine that it gets much better than this. Matches the hype it receives. Awesome!"
"D: Great beer, I think it was a little hyped for me prior to drinking it. I wouldn't say I was let down, I just wasn't as impressed when I compared it to other very well made stouts. Glad I got a chance to try this, would drink again if I saw it."
"Great job Deschutes. You make an amazing beer."
"D - Didn't give it a 5 as while this is so nice whould not be able to drink every day but is so nice to have every so often."
"Awesome beer, I can see why it gets such high reviews...even though this beer is supposedly best after 11/2010, it was very good now and something I look forward to trying again..."
"Upon having this numerous additional times since my initial review, I felt this beer needed an overall rating change. I really believe that this beer is at its best fresher and does not really benefit from further aging. But as with any beer, that is my 2 cents."
"3-Deschutes' Abyss 2009-11% abv, Imperial Stout. Unfortunately this one seemed a little off. It smelled SOUR!!! It had some light raisin, sweet malt and juicy grapefruit in the nose. It tasted again, SOUR, with a light spice to it, tangy grapefruit skin, candied malt and a light bitter finish. SO it seems like this puppy had a bit of a bottle infection due to the sour that we all got out of it."
"Drinkability: A very good beer. Maybe it was all the hype surrounding it, but I was a little bit let down by this one. The oak flavors are almost overpowering. However, the overall blend of flavors are smooth enough to make me want to drink this faster than I should. I'm glad I got a chance to try this."
"Hell yeah The Abyss. It's one to savor slowly. This is such a good beer; I can't wait to see how it ages (admittedly, it does seem rather fresh). I will update accordingly. Easily recommended."
"The Abyss pours jet-black with a lovely finger of mocha foam that has staying power, and leaves substantial lacing even after it dissipates. The bouquet is fantastic this time around, mocha and dark roast and baker's chocolate w a pleasant hint of vanilla and woodsmoke. As it warms, notes of figs, licorice and pinot noir waft into the mix. The flavor is delightfully complex, folding in everything from the aroma but adding grace notes of bourbon and brandy and port, w star turns from the star anise and black strap molasses. Wow. The feel is appropriately thick for the style, and the finish is long and balanced between sweetness and roasted malt and earthy hops. What a fine stout. I hope I don't go 5 years between bottles again."
"D- Great beer with loads of flavor, love that they added the molasses, licorice and oak aging. Will have to try again in a couple of years..."
"I think this is the best beer I have had so far this year."
"Quite possibly the most dangerous beer I've ever had. The smoothness of this beer makes me want to drink it all day long. The 11% would probably kill me after awhile but I'm kinda thinking it would be worth it. I put this on tap last year and can't wait til November to do it all over again. I will probably do unspeakable things to, for and probably with my Deschutes rep in order to get more than one keg but the jail time is most definitely something I can accept. Every nerve in your body tingles when you drink this beer. This beer reminds me of being a kid again. It reminds me of drinking chocolate milk while watching my favorite cartoon with my best friend bugs bunny and sitting in the middle of all my star wars and gi joe toys and basking in the glory of them bowing to me like I'm Gulliver or something. This beer reminds me of my best day ever. Anyways, this beer really is like a mocha chocolate milk. The coffee and malts are strong yet not overpowering. You want to drink this beer so fast but yet you find yourself weeping when you near the bottom. I would suggest this beer to novices and beer gods alike. Congratulations Beer!!!"
"M/D - This beer had a creamy and silky mouthfeel. Not as bold as I expected it to be considering its rich appearance. And considering that it is an 11% ABV, this was a very easy drinking beer."
"Pours a nice solid black color with a minimal thin film on top. Great aroma of roasted malts with some warm, sweet hints of alcohol (not too strong, though!). Has a sweet roasted malt flavor. There's a bit of coffee and some berries (blackberries?) bitterness towards the finish. The beer has a very light tingly carbonation, is medium-bodied and smooth. Strong in alcohol, but it doesn't come into the taste or really affect the drinkability. A very enjoyable beer great for finishing a night at the brewpub."
"overall, this really is the best damn stout you could possibly ever have."
"Pours black with about a pinky fingers worth of tan head. Smells like roasted malts, chocolate, cocoa and coffee. I taste cocoa, alcohol, and a nice coffee finish. This beer has a perfect amount of carbonation for this style, and it's nice and thick. It's definitely a sipper, luckily there were three of us that split the bomber. Great beer!"
"D: It's not bad by any means, but not nearly as good as I was expecting. Both the aroma and flavor was a little one dimensional for me - both being dominated too much by dark malt and coffee bitterness. I'd love to get my hands on another bottle and see what a year or two does to this."
"Overall, Abyss 2009 is good, but not close to the sublime experience of the 2008 vintage, which I had on tap with some age at Pizza Port San Clemente. Hopefully the former will approach the wonderfulness of the latter as it matures."
"No pun intended, but the sheer depth of The Abyss is more than remarkable. This beer is a good example of American brewers coming into their own and bringing it to the table. Oh, and one bottle is not enough. Buy a case; drink one now and cellar the rest. Stack this one up against rosemary-grilled lamb chops and roasted, maple-glazed acorn squash."
"The 2009 release was a hit at my last bomber get togethor. This beer pours black as night with some slight reddish highlights and thick, foamy light brown head. Immediatly on the nose you pick up both sweet and roasty malts followed by dark fruit, wood and alcohol. The palate follows the aromas, however, along with the malts, dark fruit and wood there is a suprising amount of coffee. The bitterness is well balanced with thte sweetness. It is heavy and full bodied with a great crisp carbonation"
"D= Extremely drinkable for such a bold high gravity beer. I think I actually prefer it from the bottle over on draught, but it was still incredible."
"had this on my first trip to Portland. I'd never heard of it but tried it, on the advice from the bartender. Rich, smoky flavor with hints of dark fruit and molasses. For me, the alcohol taste came through a little heavier than I would have preferred. Thinner than some stouts but it really worked in this case."
"D: I could drink this indefinitely. . . So, so good!"
"D- I could have easily drank the whole bottle without a problem. I can't wait to break out the 07 08 and 09 vert that I've got cellared for a rainy day!"
"Overall it an outstanding beer, one of the best's I cant wait for another one. dark color, rich deep malts and mahogany flavors and taste. Coffee and oak barrel bourbon tastes..perfect. You can tell there has been a great deal of effort and time has gone into this beer. Its just what I love a great beer! outstanding. I want to find one a few years older or save one for a few years and try it then. I could only imagine how it gets better with age."
"Taste is very rich with lots of oak, smoke, chocolate and light raisins. Not much booze for 11% super drinkable and very tasty."
"Overall, this is definitely a top-tier beer. It's extraordinarily smooth but it's smoothness is not matched in boldness, which prevents this beer from achieving the ultimate taste score. That being said, this is definitely a phenomenal beer that is masterfully put together. As I mentioned earlier, I'm sure this beer could do with some time in the cellar, but as it is, this is a great beer."
"I'm not a fan of the rising price and less bourbon barrel aging. Cherry bark too massive."
"weren't for the high (but impeccably masked) ABV."
"D - Pretty good for a big stout with this much alcohol. Definately a top contender, but I don't rate it as highly as a few other stouts I've had. Would enjoyably drink again."
"2009 vintage (full review later)"
"D - at 11% this beer drinks well not to hot."
"This brew lives up to it's reputation."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable, but watch out. The Eleven percent ABV will get you. A very well crafted brew."
"M/D - A nicely aged 2007, still full bodied with a strong malt flavor with the right amount of coffee and dark chocolate. Highly recommend this brew. I had it with some time on it and hope to try a fresh batch someday and update the review"
"Epic IS! At the top of my long list of favorites. Only have 3-4 left... must resist urge to drink them all right now! Can't wait for the next though. Should age really well. Would love to a vertical taste with these."
"D: For it's strength and body, The Abyss is very easy to enjoy. Hands down, the best Imperial Stout I have ever tasted to this day."
"Well worth seeking out. Complexities found only in the best Imperial Stouts. Highly recommended."
"Re-rate: 2006 bottle. This is like an entirely different beer, so smooth, well-blended, and delicious."
"Nice, thick body. Surprisingly easy drinker. Will have to compare notes with an 08 bottle."
"This was not as thick as I had imagined it would be like the Berserker, so I have to admit the drinkability was pretty awesome, overall great beer!"
"D - I wouldn't want many of these as it tastes like something I would just want with dessert.. it's a powerful heavy drink.. alcohol is hidden very well.. i'm glad i got to try this!! much thanx to smutty33 for sharin this one! Cheers!"
"D: hides the booze incredible well, great coffee character"
"Drinkability: While I would love to sip on this all day (and its been a solid hour) I would have to rate this as merely ""good"". Its strong flavors are wonderful but it is a big assed beer! Though short of perfection, this beer is a legend for a reason."
"Had this a year ago and didn't review, wish I had, that bottle was leaps and bounds better than this one, will hold the bottle for a while and try this again."
"2009 bottle thanks to DuffManSW. Black pour with a 1-finger, loose, tan head and nice lacing. The aroma is deep, bitter black coffee, licorice, strong dark chocolate and a hint of bourbon and alcohol. The flavor is intense bitter black coffee and pure dark chocolate followed by a touch of oak and vanilla and then a hot, alcoholic bourbon finish. The body is oily and full with moderate carbonation and a big alcohol bite on the end."
"Warming, but not burning. Very easy drinking with enough booziness to remind you that if you drink it too fast you may fall...into the Abyss (oh, that's cheesy)"
"what could be better?"
"Though Founders IS would be a very close second, would love to try them side by side"
"An absolute fantastic RIS, one of the best I've ever had. I don't think I could have chosen a better beer to have at 5pm on a Friday for my 500th review. This is truly a treat, and I look forward to seeing how my other bottle, a 2009, changes over time."
"The Abyss has a dark brown almost black in color with a dark brown brown head with little retention. The aroma is of roasted barley and rich coffee. This stout imparts an intense coffee flavor on your palette with minor hints of chocolate. There is very little carbonation which allows for the coffee flavors to really stand out. This is one of the few reserve series that Deschutes puts out that you can really taste the heat. There's not a lot of residual sugar to mask the 11% ABV so despite its looks, it rolls through the mouth with a light body feel. Overall though I think this is another great reserve beer from Deschutes and I can see myself drinking it whenever I have the option."
"Taste of ashy sweet malt, milk chocolate, caramelized sugars, a tiny slightly astringent / tannic flavor from black patent as the tongue dries. Tobacco not tasted since Adam from HOTD. As she warmed vanilla definitely became more strongly spoken as with the nice oak character. The oak is not overdone, and I like that only a third of the beer was oaked as it lends itself to a more mellow oak flavor. The bourbon is almost masked entirely by the oak and dark malts, even though I love bourbon, this beer tastes much more mellow than many other bourbon barrel aged beers I have had lately. So much so that the bourbon aspect is nearly unnoticeable. Sprecher Scotch Style bourbon barrel and Brooklyn Black Ops come to mind in this category. This is a well put together Stout with nice balance."
"D: 11%... I can tell a liar when I see one, there is no way this is true. There are the slightest hints of the alcohol but in no way are they harsh. I am going to finish this bottle with ease and struggle not to open an 07 and 09 to go along with this."
"D want.on.draft. yes, worth the price, would cellar one for a few years."
"Pitch black head with a dark brown head- really good looking stout. Aroma holds cocoa, vanilla, cream, oat, molasses, anise, and a bit of oak. Nothing too aggressive on the nose, but smells delicious. Flavor holds lots of burnt sugar, ash, roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, caramel, and a definite milk or cream aspect to it. Alcohol, bourbon, and oak comes through at the finish as well. The burnt and charred flavor at the start is really delectable, and that same quality is what makes the finish and aftertaste so appealing. Palate is extremely smooth and immensely easy to drink for an 11% impy. Top notch imperial stout."
"This was tasted after a KBS (my favorite stout).... I started off a little skeptical. However, this won me over as it warmed. Nose is complex for sure, goes along with the stellar taste. All of the flavors melt together into one indescribable taste. It's a combination of roasted malts, chocolate, licorice, coffee, bourbon, vanilla, and an unknown smoky/spicy flavor. It also has a little bitter dark chocolate finish. This beer holds all the flavors so well. Abyss deserves the hype, and is one of the top stouts around."
"Amazing stout, perhaps my favorite now. It's very good, hides the booze well, and is much more drinkable than Black Tuesday or Dark Lord."
"2008 Vintage. This is it. One of the most fantastic RIS's ever. I am privileged to have acquired a good sample of this. Blackest of black, a black hole into which light is forever drawn in and spit out in the form of a tannish head that clings to the glass. The depths are endless and I am taken down into the rich, roasty, and vanilla aromas that swell around me. The chocolate and deep blackberry tones are abundant and mix well with the hints of licorice and bourbon. Rich and intense, sweet and powerful, this beer is certainly one to covet and savor. Such a treat."
"This is a drinkable stout. Completely lived up to it's top stout billing. The taste was a little more bitter than I like but the smell & flavors are so remarkably apparent that this can be overlooked. A bit strong in the ABV area to be sessionable. It pairs well with chocolate desserts."
"Drinkability: Really great sipper. Respect this beer. Had this by myself but would have loved to have shared with a friend. Knew this immediately after the first sip. Overall an amazing brew. Easy drinking so long as you know how to handle it."
"Finaly it warms, and you get to lick the goddess in full glory. Sulfur runs down your throat, coats the sides of your tongue, and pushes with might at your good nature. Licorice and smoke and oak and dates and brimstone all show up to the party, your mouth feels like a dark metal show, all the devils are out to play. It dances, it cavorts, it delights. These are the good days, and we should all be glad for that last 2 oz sip of perfectly warmed abyss."
"Taste is complex and varied, has a little bit of everything. Some wood, some fruit and some brandy-like alcohol notes. Malts are silky and chocolaty with even a little bit of toasty and nuttiness more typical of a porter...very nice. Hops are there and contribute a surprising amount of bittering on the finish. Very layered with the flavors continually unfolding on the tongue. Body is fairly medium for the style, but with as much flavor as this thing packs it has no impact on the mouthfeel whatsoever. There is absolutely nothing negative I can say about this beer. It is an incredible beer, one of the best beers I have ever had and probably the best stout I have quaffed. A must try."
"Impression: Never felt like this before about a beer. I know I am going to cry when the last of these four bottles is empty. Best stout I have ever tasted."
"Vintage 09 bottle. Poured into a duvel tulip. Almost solid black unless held up to a bright lite and then u can see some brown around the edges. Massive black coffee flavors with some wood notes and molasses in the background. A little harsh on the alcohol but im told this lessens with a little age. Smell is faintly chocolaty coffee and hoppy mix but i get isopropyl alcohol more than anything else. One awesome stout. I cant wait to try some older versions."
"D: I could drink this all day."
"D: This is definitely hotter than ORF, but not as hot as say rabid duck or BCS, this is a delicious brew and feel like I could easily have a couple of these"
"O: It seems that this years version, the hops were more muted than last years, and more specifically the bitterness, which is a big improvement. Although I wished that there was a bit more barrel aroma and taste - that would have added even more depth. This will be great to age and see how it tastes in 1-2 years."
"[Edit: Fresh 2010--aroma still very solid, not quite as phenomenal as I remember though, dropped to 4.5]"
"Overall (3.5) - This is too young. The note on the side of the bottle should be heeded. That adds up to a total score of 3.7."
"Bottom Line: Give this one a try if you ever have a chance. It is truly a complex beer. If you like the black butte porter from Deschutes, then you will probably enjoy this beer as well."
"Beer is medium to full bodied. Late roast taste followed by a strong aftertaste of bitterness and roasted malt. Definitely some espresso character. I was expecting a little bit of bourbon but got none. I did however get some warmth from the alcohol in the front of the mouth along with considerable gravity and sweetness. Overall its a good beer. Its not my favorite imperial stout but it is really good. Drinkability is good and mouthfeel is good too. I would be interested to see how this beer changes over time."
"Many of the aromas you smelled initially come alive on your palate. The velvety smooth heavy bodied beer entices you with chocolate, coffee, bourbon, prunes, molasses, indefinable malty sweetness and of course alcohol. The finish comes around to rescue you from the sweetness with bitter roasted coffee notes that linger long enough to be appreciated but not long enough to annoy."
"M/D: Creamy, smooth, viscous, and absolutely sublime. It slides over the palate and down the back with a nice dry finish. This is without a doubt the best RIS that I have ever had, though it may be more American Imperial Stout...This is deep, complex, balanced, and no single flavor becomes the focal point of this beer. I will definitely be trading for more of these as soon as the opportunity presents itself."
"D- Yet another fantastic imperial stout to lust after all year. The only fault I can find is in it's just-less-than-ideal drinkability-- the finish is quite intense and lingering, coats the tongue and mouth with sticky bitterness."
"Overall this is an excellent beer. I was expecting slightly more from it, but that's only because there's so much hype. Definitely want to drink more of it if I can get some."
"This beer is really hyped up so I was truly expecting to be let down. But I wasn't. This beer lives up to the hype. Is it the #3 beer in the entire world? I dunno. Others can debate that. I'll just say that this truly is a world class stout without question."
"A lot smoother than what I had expected. A very velvety mouthfeel. Wonderfully drinkable for the abv. Was not let down one bit and cannot wait for a couple of these bad boys to age."
"I was expecting slightly more out of this one but it was still very complex and tasty. The barrel aging isn't as noticeable as I thought it would be but it is a blend. The vanilla and dark fruit flavors really come out after this warms along with other flavors so let it sit a while. Definitely a sipper."
"Yep that is how it's supposed to look. Very murky and dark, small tan head with little to no lacing. The smell is very good as well and similar in taste. Heavy malt character up front. Oatmeal and whiskey with a touch of caramel. The nose has a bit more alcohol bit to it, but overall masks it pretty well. The mouthfeel is perfect, as well as the drinkability."
"D- So drinkable for such a high alcohol stout. Minimal alcohol burn, which I didn't even describe above, allows this to be consumed much quicker than a sipper. The mouthfeel invites bigger mouthfuls than is probably recommended. One of my most memorable stouts ever. Can't wait to try the other vintages."
"D- After smelling this beer, and after my first sip, I thought this would be a sipper for sure. But I was wrong. The drinkability of this beer is actually very high. Overall, this exceeded my expectations!"
"I would really like to pick up a bottle of this and have it in a year or two to see how it ages. Once the oak and alcohol mellow a bit more I can see this beer being mind blowing."
"Serving type: bottle"
"2007 bottle thanks to CaptainCougar. Pitch black with a medium-small tan head. Sweet aroma with intense malt, caramel, burnt sugars, and roasted malt. Seems a little mellow, but at a couple years old, this was to be expected. The flavor is dryer than I expected with a roasty bite in the finish. Overall though, quite smooth with just a little more angular roast and a hint of alcohol towards the end. Rich all the way through with a light lingering sweetness. A touch of wood mostly adds to the dry feeling that I get, but bourbon is not at all evident, which I sort of like, but also doesn't seem to be adding anything positive. Medium-full in body with medium-low carbonation. Pretty nice stout, but not the most intense, good or bad. Mellow after a couple years, but still hanging on. I've really got to get around to cracking one of my relatively fresh '09 bottles to compare now."
"Thanks ditmier for the awesome trade."
"Overall: A classic. A couple years really melds flavors together. Hard to say which is better, but with a little age definitely more drinkable."
"Exceptional."
"Overall- Can't wait to try one with some age on it."
"*Idea introduced by fellow tasters/friends."
"There was a debate for me on whether or not to open this or not. I am certainly glad I did. I have no doubt this would improve with age though it is not needed to be enjoyable. The flavors are incredibly enjoyable and layered to perfection. The alcohol is pleasant and rather well hidden. I will definitely be seeking this out again in later years. Fantastic beer."
"I honestly believe this beer my be perfect after a year or two aging."
"This beer has some room to age. The alcohol is present, but one might not guess it was 11%. That said its fairly easy to drink. It is quite tempting to open my other bottles, but I think the reward of letting these guys mellow out a bit will be well worth the wait."
"A fine Imperial Stout that fits in with the best."
"Edit: my first review was of a fresh 2009 The Abyss. Now, I am enjoying a 2008 The Abyss. I raised smell and taste to a 4.5 from 4.0. The smell is more complex than what I remember. The taste is superior to what I remember, also. In both there is the reminiscent smell of smores. It is bursting with chocolate, marshmallow, graham cracker, followed by the bourbon and oak. The feel is thicker than what I remember. This is such a smoother-well rounded- stout after a year and a half. Well done!"
"Overall drinkability is limited by ABV only, but consistent with the style. If not for the potency, this balanced brew could be enjoyed for days."
"D: Man this is a tasty beer. So glad that I got to try it. And boy do I wish I had more. A fine brew, thick, creamy, delicious, and leaves me wanting much much more..."
"UPDATE: Upon revisting this brew, a 2009 vintage, I found the scent to contain less of the coffee and a chocolatey dark cherry and alcohol tone. Still pleasant, but different. Taste is a touch more aggressive at first, but as the palate is coated, the impact lessens. A bigger bozzy kick on the tongue, guessing this needs a little more age. The body is improved, thicker and more coating. Still a good beer, be interested to see how my other '09 tastes in a few months."
"I think the aging potential of this beer is exceptional. I look forward to revisiting this in about 1 year. This beer deserves it's ranking as on of the best on BA."
"D - Behind Kate the Great the '06 Abyss is the best RIS out there in my experience with the '07 not too far behind."
"Drinkability- Excellent! Awesome Imperial Stout I love it"
" Overall, aside from Rochefort 10 and possibly the Duck Rabbit Imperial Stout (which both hold a special place in my heart) I feel this beer is easily the most complex and interesting that I have ever consumed."
"D- This is a wonderful stout and one of the best that I have had. I see why it is ranked among the best. The best thing about it is the balanced character it portrays in the flavor...one of my new favorite imperial stouts...and I will be trading for it again."
"Worth a try!"
"All in all, this brew was great, but didn't really exceed my expectations. However, my expectations were very high. So, it rated very amazing. Good stout example. If you like your stouts hoppy and boozy, then this is your brew, dead on."
"Aroma was more coffee and chocolate than in the 2009 vintage. The roasted malt and slight smoke were absent. The flavor was more of a milk chocolate with some vanilla. Overall, I think the 2009 was a little bit better but the 2007 was still a great beer."
"The pour is black, super black. Beautiful brown head. The aroma is strong, coffee and chocolate notes, big roasted malt character. The taste is incredible and surprisingly refined, I assumed from the aggressive nose that this beer would be pretty rough on the palette, but its not. I really wish I had this available to me in VA, I'd buy a case to cellar and a case to drink. One of the very best impy stouts I've ever had."
"-would never, ever turn this beer down if available. so damn good. in the top 3-5 for a reason!"
"Wanted to love this beer: appearance and smell are near perfect for a BA RIS, and the mouthfeel isn't too far behind, though a bit thin. But the 09 vintage has so much bitterness that gets in the way of an otherwise great RIS. So much so, it took me a long while to get through a single glass. I'll let some bottles sit for a while to see if the edges soften up and re-review at that time, but I'm clearly not in the majority with this one."
"This is one of the best stouts for the money you can land. It is well deserving of it's place among the hierarchy of best beers on the BA list. This delivers a smooth awesomeness with all the right flavors and roasted malts and overtones of dark fruits in all the right places and the barrel aging is the mellowing factor that pushes this one over the top..Hat's off to Deschutes for a high quality job on this well made Stout.!"
"D: You want to keep drinking this....massive flavor and aroma with minimal booziness slowing things down...this is a world class beer for sure. Amazing!"
"Toby, you are truly the man for hooking me up with this brew!"
"One of my favorite beers of all time. I wait all year for its release. The 2009 seems a little harsh compared to my recollection of the 2008 vintage. I plan on aging a few of these '09s. I have the feeling this beer will benefit greatly from the extra time. I have a few '08s here in Washington and can't wait to see what a year adds the beer."
"More to come in 2010."
"Taste is immaculately woven with dark chocolate and a smoothly thick, lush body tranfused with all sorts of vanilla, molasses, coffee, and bourbon oakyness. A very well balanced and heavy treat. The chocolate is tenderly bittered with the heat and quite dark in its efforts. Anything and everything dark from the cocoa bean has been placed in every inch of its flavor. Spiced with a touch of peppery hops, coffee, and a terrific, if not down right perfect notion of bourbon hints wavered all throughout the chocolatey body."
"D: The high abv is barely discernible, other than from the strong flavor. Picked up a bottle after having it on tap. Definitely my favorite imperial stout."
"D: Very very good but sampled amidst another outstanding brew, this was not as good. Incredibly complex and I definitely appreciate it. Worthy of the hype and glad to have had the opportunity to try it."
"I would like to mention that being a fresh vintage the oak was VERY promonant. Not necessarily a bad thing but"
"Opened this as an early birthday present to myself. Poured a wonderful pitch black into my goblet followed by a dense cocoa creme head. Smelled of chocolate, small hints of black licorice, smoke, charcoal, caramel, vanilla, and hints of oaky bourbon. Taste was exceptional. Warm and thick on the tongue, lots of chocolate like the nose, smooth vanilla and roasted characters throughout. Some dark fruit flavors as well, could be the licorice. Mouthfeel was near perfect, I wished for just a touch more. For a beer of this strength it was ridiculously smooth although it could be the 2 years of age. I doubt I could put down a bottle by myself. Wonderful experience."
"Overall, this is an excellent imperial stout. Body, flavor and appearance are all there. I felt like the aroma could have been a little more complex, but I'm not really complaining. This is my first Abyss and I'm excited to say that I have a few more of these in the cellar to age, along with an '06 and an '07. I'm guessing a few years on this stout could make it exceptionally smooth."
"I like this a lot. I'm glad I've got more to age."
"Drinkability: Drinks under the ABV and is smooth, tasty, and full of complexity and flavor. On tap may have been a little too carbonated, but the flavors were more intense. Definitely a great big stout, and love the increased bottle numbers this year allowing me to pick up almost a case to age, as I have a feeling this is only going to get better as the residual sugars ferment out and add a whole 'nother dimension to this already very tasty brew."
"D - Surprisingly so but depends on my mood. Definitely wouldn't drink more than two"
"The Abyss is a certainly a special beer that deserves every single accolade that comes its way. One sip is all it takes to realize that. I recall having a fresh(er) bottle of this 2007 Reserve some time ago. No doubt it was damn good. But, I believe two years have really refined it. It is better today than I recall. I have no hesitation saying today that this is easily one of the top three beers I've experienced. It's simply that good. Find a bottle and stow it away for a couple of years. You won't be disappointed. If you happen to have a bottle of 2007 Reserve, it's drinking mighty fine right now. Perhaps you should open it."
"Wow, what a wonderful flavor, not let down at all! Chocolate, coffee, bitter backside stout's usually leave, creamy, thick...excellent! Enjoyed this stout and want another one!"
"When you try a highly touted beer such as this I'm always fearful of the overhype. But this is truly an outstanding beer. Worthy of the rating and then some."
"A bit hard to describe...even harder to put down."
"D - This is one big and exciting beer! ""Excellent"" in every sense of the word!!"
"A slightly vigorous pour, shows a lively beer with a this coffee brown head. settles to a thin cap. It pours very thick and very black. It looks amazing, I am so excited to drink this brew! I take a big whiff and a sweet clean roastiness, also hints of raisin and vanilla, and I get that anise. There is also a bit of oak in there. The taste is wonderful, nice clean roastiness, dark chocolate mixed with raisins. I had to look for the oak and bourbon, but it was there. And anise in the finish. The finish is clean, and you just can't wait to take another sip. What a wonderful beer, so much going on. The carbonation was perfect for this beer and the mouthfeel was silky smooth. Overall a great beer and I can't wait to drink more of this in the future!"
"This is an amazing beer which I think In my opinion is going to get better with age- I have 07, 08 and 09 bottles aging now and will update once I try one of the older vintages."
"Notes: An exceptional beer. A must try."
"D - My favorite RIS so far...but of course! Lives up to the hype, which is really saying something given all the hype baggage it carries."
"D- I definitely enjoy drinking a bomber of this but probably not any more then that at one sitting. For one it is very thick and the ABV is pretty high at 11% Easily one of my favorite"
"D - Definately in your face and a sipper but I love the way it washes down, each sip getting me more tipsy. Gonna age a few of these forsher."
"Undescribable brew,"
"Overall: A beer to cherish and savor; a must try on tap or out of a bottle. Cheers!"
"Why is this rated so high?"
"UPDATE: Had a 2010 recently that I'd been aging. It held up nicely, five years later. Still not my favorite, but if you like it, you'll really like it with some age on it."
"This beer is seriously unbeatable, you can keep your Dark Lord."
"I waited all year for this and it was worth the wait!! I have two bottles left that I am cellaring. The first bottle I'll drink on the 2010 release next year and the other I'll try to save for five years- we'll see..."
"My Dad like this beer and he didn't even like Speedway. Had 2 glasses just to make sure I liked it and at 4.35 who wouldn't."
"I could go on and on about its boozy rich chocolateyness and lovely smell but every and their mother has already. I just need to do right by the universe and acknowledge this juggernauts prowess, dissolving my earlier review of what we all know now has been just an off year in a spectacular pedigree."
"Holy Crap."
"This beer can be enjoyed with any meal or just for pure beer drinking enjoyment. I like it in a frozen glass."
"This beer is my favorite Imperial Stout for a reason. It is something everybody should expirience."
"A very careful pour lead to a huge head that fell slowly and laced judiciously. A nice layer of foam sits atop the liquid with a mousse like consistency. Color is deep dark black. Smells wonderful, candy, sugar, hops, roasted coffee, lots to smell. Taste is initially bitter and green, then flows back to a smooth creamy chocolate with bitter roasty notes at the back of the palate. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good as well. I'm taking this in pretty slow because it does taste big. No real hints of alcohol either."
"One of the true greats, a masterpiece."
"Overall the top RIS I've ever had. The booze can come on strong after warming but I'm sure that will be taken care of with some age. I can't wait for a year to pass so I can crack open another bottle."
"Thanks a million to Todd for sharing this black hole of a beer with me!"
"The mouthfeel is full and creamy, but not quite syrupy or chewy."
"Alcohol is well hidden, which makes this pretty easy to drink. Not overly rich and thick, but this really needs to age to reach its full potential. Wanted to try it fresh, but it's now apparent that it will be remarkably better with a year or more on it."
"Nietzche had it right: stare long into the abyss and the abyss stares back at you. This beer will haunt you like Slenderman on your Marble Hornets video footage. I can't wait until I try this vintage a year from now."
"- Overall still a fantastic and unique stout.... and I know it will be better years down the road."
"Overall, a world class beverage and fairly widely available to boot. Get your hands on one, and Sproser, we'll have to share another vintage sometime under less clandestine circumstances!"
"I love this beer. No worries about falling into the abyss, take the plunge, it'll hold you in darkness just long enough to appreciate the light. A world class offering and something I will be ISO each year."
"Overall this is everything I hoped it would be. A fantastic imperial stout that lives up to the billing."
"Long have I waited to try this one, as I have patiently sat on this for two years before cracking open my first 2007 vintage. You can't nail the appearance any more than this. Oil slick black color with a lively coco colored head adorning the top. Thick gobs of lace hold fast while an everpresent halo of foamy bubbles stays around for the ride. The nose is very deep with flavor. Chocolate and vanilla whaft around a bit, as does a bourbon coated hop scent. Lots of aromas at work here. Taste is good, but subtle. Very gentle vanilla kisses the tongue alond with a thin chocolate coating. The hop bitterness lends a hand to help balance things out from all the sweetness, and combines with a coffee presence. I think the age has helped knock the alcohol burn down a lot to where it's hardly even noticeable. Moutfeel is tremendously smooth, but is a little lighter than i'd like it to be. I little more chewy with a touch of stickiness would be nice. A wonderful beer to be sure, but is it the best imperial stout out there? No, I thought Dark Lord was a cut above."
"Very nice beer from Deschutes. As far as widely-available imperial stouts go, this is king. However, that said, I do not LOVE this beer. I like it a great deal, and would never shy away from drinking it... but it doesn't grab me the way it seems to grab others here. But, in any case, this is a very, very good beer."
"Going to cellar a few to see what a year or two does to this beer."
"Glad i finally got to try this, but somewhat let down. Then again, I'm not a huge fan of black licorice and I also had my hopes set pretty high, expecting one of the best beers of all time. I can still appreciate this beer though and understand why it has such a large following."
"D - This brew is just delicious and very well done in every aspect. Great complexities and balance, and the 11% ABV is hidden very well. A treat, indeed."
"I'm not sure there's a single beer in the world I'd rather have."
"Seriously, this is one of those beers that is tough to keep in the cellar. Truly a masterpiece. Well done Deschutes!"
"I poured from the 2009 vintage into a snifter. In typical Imperial stout fashion, the brew pours jet black with a thin tan head. The smell is amazing! There are deep chocolates, coffee, rum, dark fruit, the best smelling beer I have ever had. The flavor is more chocolate, coffee and a bit boozier. The licorice and molasse are also noted. The beer is a full bodied sipper. The carbonation is a bit higher than expected, which is not a bad thing. Overall this beer is well deserving of its praise."
"2009 Abyss poured gently into a Dogfish snifter at cellar temp. Pours smoothly and generates a thin dark tan head. Pitch black. Aromas of coffee, oak, booze dominate. Taste is similar with a light kick of hops and chocolate at the finish. Medium to full bodied, but not as creamy as I had hoped. Still very smooth, but does have that bite at the finish that leaves an alcohol tinge in the mouth. Wonderful beer (slightly more coffee and a kick than the other members of the ""big 4"")- right up there with Kate (more chocolate) and DL (more booze and a bit creamier) for me, just behind Darkness (just plain creamier and dessert like) yet I still have to do a vertical with my 08 and 07- just waiting for the right day!"
"The 2009 Abyss was graciously brought back from Portland by Leslie to share with her husband Rob and me. She happened to luck onto the brewery on release day and watched with amazement as the line to drink and purchase went out the door and down the street. I really enjoyed the opportunity to drink this highly rated beer and was not disappointed. It's beautiful in the glass, as dark as it can get with a very brown head that lasted a while and laced the glass as it went. There's a big, full nose with a touch of alcohol in it. The mouthfeel was oddly light at first but more richness and complexity toward the finish. The flavor was full and well balanced with chocolate being the most noticable. A very lovely beer."
"Wow, very well-crafted brew, takes its place with Brooklyn BCS and Ted Fidy as my favorite RIS's."
"2008 vintage, from notes. Pours black, thick-ish chocolaty head with some retention, and very thin, spotty lacing. Glorious. SMELL molasses, alcoholic esters, black patent, licorice, coffee, some sweetness. Nose is nice, but not exceptional, or even bold. TASTE licorice, molasses, roasted grains, coffee, bitter chocolate, some malty sweetness underneath. Woody notes add complexity and roasty & hoppy bitterness rise briefly before the clean finish. Wicked smooth, complex and balanced. Something close to perfect. FEEL mild carbonation, luxurious rich texture with high viscosity. Full, smooth, long lingering pleasant sensation. OVERALL sure it's big and designed to be a sipper. But when something is as delicious as this, the sips come at short intervals. One of my all time favorites."
"D: Very easy to sip on for a long period of time. The best part is how like this feels despite being such a big beer."
"It isn't perfect, but it really hits the spot, and I will very likely buy one to cellar and sample in the future."
"D - Whoa! While this beer is easily in my top 3 all time, it is one and done. The flavors are amazing. The mouthfeel is perfect. It's just too much to have more than one at a time. The only way I'd crack more than one bottle of this, is if I was doing a vertical with some friends (which I plan to do next year). Fantastic beer, but really, one is all you need."
"Poured at room temperature into a snifter. This beer is aptly named, there is no light penetrating this stuff. The appearance is silky dark, thick, and rich. Just looking at it I can already anticipate the flavors and mouthfeel. The barrel aging shines through in the aroma. Very delicate but noticeable leathery smell. Very pleasant and warming. The taste starts out chocolatey but the alcohol quickly punches through in the finish. Some licorice but that's more in the aroma than the taste. Very complex flavor that probably changes with age. I'll have to save a bottle for a few months and compare. This beer is pretty darn thick. Definitely a sipper."
"D-This is a great beer. Best enjoyed by sipping. The rich, complex flavor profile drew me deeper into the Abyss with each sip. I definitely enjoyed the journey, and enjoyed sharing it with my son."
"I had a Stone IRS, which at one time was one of my absolute favorite beers, last night to see how it would compare with the Abyss. The Abyss beat the life out of it, resuscitated it with a defibrillator, and beat the life out of it again. Now, you might look at the scores I've given these beers in my reviews and ask why this score isn't higher and the Stone score lower. I'll reply by saying, ""look, isn't that Garrett Oliver?"" and running away. Then, after I think of something to say, I'll come back and tell you it's because I reviewed the Stone IRS a long time ago and my palate and/ or the beer has changed in that period of time. So there. Anyway, if you've been reading this ""review"" (which we'll call it for the sake of brevity) and wondering if I'd ever get to a point, then wonder no more, because here it is: this is a good beer. If you can get some, I would recommend that you do so at your convenience. Thank you."
"The beer is pretty drinkable for its abv, but comes up a little short of some other stouts."
"Notes: Easily my new favorite beer. I am a big fan of deschutes beer and this easily the feather in their cap. It has the strong flavors I have come to expect from them because of their beers like Black Butte Porter, and Obsidian Stout. Along with easy drinkability which is something I appreciate about their beers.If you haven't tried this, find a way to you won't be disappointed. I am going to visit my mom this weekend or the next and she lives close to Bend where the brewery is, so I will hopefully try it on tap. I bought three bottles of this, the other two are getting cellared for special occasions. If I had the money I'd go back and buy a case, but alas I am a poor college student so these will have to do for now. Can't wait to try this after it has reached the ""best after 11/1/2010", maybe I will save a bottle for next Thanksgiving or Christmas seems like it would go well with a holiday meal anyway."
"Excellent beer. Enjoy it every time I have the chance. It's sweet, but not too sweet. It's high in alcohol but not so much that it's over powering. I taste hints of candy, perhaps red vines or another red licorice. but then it balances out to a great finish. If you haven't tried it, you really should. You'll be glad you did."
"perfect"
"I have had this several times. The first few times, the bottle was pretty much brand new. It was a little raw and rough around the edges. There is still some alcohol here, but it is much more mellow and subtle than previous tastings. Overall, one monster of a beer that is indeed world class. Get some."
"I wish i lived closer to where i had this, i will definitley make the trip to get more."
"D. Cant detect the alcohol in this at all , its very hidden, but it does have a kick, so cant drink a whole lot of it, but for the % its so damn smooth."
"Serving type: on tap at Callahan's"
"Overall, this is a must try. When I can, I'm gonna try and get as much as this as I can afford and Liquid Solutions will allow me to order. A fantastic beer."
"I made it, Cheers!"
"Smells surprisingly of flora, oak, hot cocoa, and cookie. The bouquet is actually quite bright. Tastes of intense dark fruits, oak, complex sugars, a touch of licorice. Chocolate liqueur on the midpalate, finishes with black malts and sugar cookie. The flavor is quite intense and palatable for something so strong. A lot of residual sweetness makes this one something to share for me. I'd like to have this beer 100% aged in a spirit barrel."
"peace."
"song- ""eyes of the world"""
"Can't give The Abyss a perfect score here. as a lover of a good stout I would drink this all day long, or atleast untill I pass out drunk, but I definitely drink this one a good bit slower than most of my other beverages. whether its the fact that I don't want this beer to ever leave my side or it's just a fact that it's a BIG beer and can't be dominated, I'll never know."
"D: Beer is so well integrated at this point. Well balanced between the coco sweetness and bourbon vanilla sweetness. Two years has treated this beer well. Can't imagine it could get any better."
"I could drink this silky smooth crack all day if I didn't value my liver or figure. True, it may not be the best I've had, but damn Gina! One fine as hell RIS. I just hope the next bottle doesn't require me going to the ends of the earth (or Oregon) to get it."
"Overall, this beer is simply stunning. I split this with a buddy and my half is going fast. I wish I had an entire bottle of this for myself, but I am happy to share it. Drinkable, amazing, great. I want more."
"An excellent Russian Imperial Stout. The alcohol content is well hidden, and this makes a perfect night cap."
"D - Actually very drinkable for an RIS. Maybe my tolerance for this type of beer is higher than other peoples'."
"Very tasty beer, scarily smooth and drinkable for such a big beer. A nice sipper. Many thanks to Sparky27 for throwing in such an amazing beer as an extra."
"I really can't add anything to what's already been said about this beer other than if they ain't got this in heaven, I ain't going. It's a little on the sweet side as far as my own personal taste for the RIS goes - I prefer something a bit drier like Bear Republic's Big Bear Black Stout, but this is a world class beer, all preferences aside. This particular bottle has been sitting in my pantry for almost a year, and although I'd have preferred to let it age a bit longer it's been an exceptionally hot summer in Texas (hottest on record for Austin) and I thought I should open it. I had it with some nice, well-aged cheddar cheese and a halfway decent cigar. They both complemented the beer perfectly. Life is good."
"Bottle pours pitch black with a thick tan head. Aroma is mainly roasted malts, vanilla, and some oak. Has a medium heavy body with some carbonation. Flavor is dark chocolate, vanilla, licorice, oak, and a slight amount of bourbon flavor. Overall is a solid brew. I prefer more balance to my BA bourbon beers. This one could have had a little more bourbon flavors."
"All in all this is one hell of a beer though."
"drinkability: great imperial stout with super complexity. Probably the most complex beer I have ever had."
"I admit I'm biased because I like the 2006 the best, and I didn't care for 07 or 08 nearly as much fresh. 07 has turned out to be much more to my liking, and it has a long way to go in the cellar before peaking. Cheers"
"Can't wait to have another is 6 months or so..."
"this is an amazing beer with touches of burbon, licorice, chocolate, and coffee. the excellence cannot be denied, but there are improvements to be made."
"M: Surprisingly light... on the spectrum i'd place this in the middle of medium bodied... which is a very nice thing for a beer of this complexity"
"Overall, excellent beer. With a year of age on it, the alcohol is almost completely hidden and the beer is super smooth. WOW"
"A treat to drink and one to savor and enjoy with a friend over a couple of hours."
"D: A very good imperial stout. Well balanced and actually quite easy to drink. The contributions from the licorice in this one are a work of art."
"D- Very good, the alcohol is very very well hidden. This beer is very sticky and the flavors linger for quite some time."
"Amazingly balanced, medium bodied, and unbelievably drinkable. This is a real treat. I have one bottle left, and will be saving it for a special occasion, to be sure. I rate the drinkability high however, because if I had more, I would drink this regularly! Cheers."
"So, in terms of the RIS tasting this was SOUNDLY panned as being poorly made, unbalanced, not very interesting. My score, here, is greatly inflated compared to the remarks given on this one. Heck, it was one of only 2 or 3 out of 20+ bottles we drank where there was some left at the end of the night - and we had this one fourth. So not worth the hype it isn't even funny."
"Overall, The Abyss is the real deal- everything you want in an RIS from the flavors to the mouthfeel and beyond. It's great to see a beer of this caliber made in reasonable quantities such that people can obtain it without too much difficulty."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer of which I had more of this year. I can't get over how good this beer is. I only wish this wasn't my only bottle of this year. Thanks to Mike once again for the hook up and glad to take the advice and drink it now."
"I was saving this beer for a special occasion. Today the 1 1/2 inch irrigation pipe going to my sprinkler system decided to bust. The end result was a flooded yard, driveway, street, and worst of all my basement. I spent 4 hours vacuuming water from my basement. Then my wife took it upon herself to open a bottle of Abyss and poor me a glass. I took a sip of this beer and thought what a perfect day. Then I had a few more sips and decided I needed to share my perfect day with other people."
"Hell yes. I will not get into Abyss' flavours, or how smooth and complex it is, or how it feels silky smooth on the tongue. All that notwithstanding, this is one damn fine stout. I love Expedition. The Abyss keeps all of Expedition's flavour, but smooths it out and makes it into a beer that's even stronger, but will be hard to find a tongue that doesn't like it. A really nice beer, and worth seeking out."
"07 batch, fresh. Pours black with a decent sized tan head. Aroma is very roasty with some chocolate. Flavor is very roasty as well. Chocolate. vanilla, coffee, smoke, and just a bit of the barrel aged flavor. Finishes creamy, little carbonation. Alcohol well hidden. Very nice but could use a little less roast in the flavor."
"An absolutely fantastic beer that lives up to every bit of the hype. Easily one of the best stouts I've had, the weight on smell here is the only thing keeping this from being one of my most highly rated beers. Get it."
"I'd say I am just trying to be realistic in not giving it fives across the board, in that without having tried every RIS available I am trying to be fair. Still this is a world class and incredibly complex and delicious beer."
"Ah... so ends an era. *Sigh* This was the last bottle I drank from my Christmas gift to myself from '08. Sadly, I foresee dark times and lots of cheap beer in my future. And so it was that I opened this final bomber on 4/20/09 and shared it with my good friend John to celebrate all I once was and all I hope to someday be again. Into our glasses the brew was a used-motor-oil black color. The two-fingers of wood-brown head displayed excellent retention as a skim and collar that left sticky lacing throughout the sample. The aroma was complex, full of milk and dark chocolate, dry cocoa, roasted malt, dark fruit, alcohol and oak. Rich, sweet and very appealing. The flavors were also outstanding and highly complex. Starting with chocolate and toffee it then went into dark caramel, alcohol, sweet pipe tobacco, lots of oak and coffee. The balance between the sweet malty elements and the bitter hoppy notes was superb. As it warmed the chocolate continued to waft forth, encouraging us to dink more. The mouthfeel was creamy and smooth, the body full and the carbonation on-point for a RIS. A joy to drink and surprisingly gulp-able, this was one of the finest beers I had ever tasted and it deserves to be honored amongst the best in the world."
"Its smells so strong of alcohol and is completely hidden and very smooth. I could write something new every sip I take. If you can find this, its worth every cent!"
"nice"
"*Update- had a 2010 vintage on 06/02/14, flavors seem to have dulled noticeably"
"A 2007 vintage to celebrate my actual birthday (thanks for the trade drseamus). I have had tastes, but have been looking forward to sitting down and enjoying this. Pours a dark/opaque black, no light getting through this one, and a solid 3 finger tan head. The aroma is a little more subdued than I had anticipated. Certainly a delicious smelling brew, with aromas of roasted malt, chocolate, and espresso coming through, but not as strong as some other imperial stouts I have had. The oak is even more subdued, maybe I served this a tad warm? The taste, however, was not subdued at all, a lovely compilation of all the flavors I enjoy in a good strong stout. A strong, sweet chocolate flavor up front, pairs nicely with the coffee flavor. These flavors mellow as you sip it, possibly due to the earthy oak flavor. Not sure where it comes from, but a nice tart bitterness kick comes through on the back end, in addition to a bourbony warmth. I still feel this could age longer, as I love when these stouts get even thicker in the mouthfeel. There is certainly an alcohol warmth that follows a few sips. Its hard to establish drinkability on such a big stout, but within its category, this is a pleasing stout to drink, and I thoroughly enjoyed sipping on it over the course of the evening. Looking forward to drinking more in the future for sure."
"Drinkable and extremely enjoyable. A world class sipper for sure. Psyched to see how this one will develop over time."
"One fine Saturday brunch found myself and an '08 Abyss in a gastronomical mood. So poaching a few local, free range eggs to accompany a Herve Mons camembert and sweet pepper relish on marble rye sandwich, I felt this was an ideal time to stare uninterrupted into the Abyss. Aggressively pouring the thick elixir into the St. Bernardus chalice...I like to wake up high gravity beers as much as possible...I notice the tremendous frothy carbonation that sits atop for almost the entire session. This really sets it apart from the other contenders in its class. It helps to lift taste from being just cloying and heavy. Aromatically, it fills the room. There is almost a mist that surrounds the glass of purely hedonistic levels of licorice, brown sugar, coffee, vanilla and chocolate. A slight amount of boozy heat, but nothing a few years asleep in the cellar wouldn't resolve. It amazing to think how five years or so ago that beers of these proportions did not exist. Lucky us! This is the part that I like best...one long, slow contemplative sip without distraction. This creation is full of point-counterpoints of sweet/bitter, heavy/light, not enough/too much. The licorice is slightly prominent. The anise in absinthe comes to mind. Dark Horizon, that delicious licorice bomb, comes to mind. I have had this and the '07 on many occasions before now, but this is the first time I have really appreciated this character. I have become so enamored with bourbon in beers that I almost feel like something is missing. Though I feel like this is complete. The good folks at Deschutes realized their ideal. I like it. I would like to have cases of it. Dark Lord it is not. There is a creamy, earthy nuttiness on the finish that I really enjoy, but becomes increasingly difficult to get past the licorice. The alcohol is more evident and that is to be expected. World class beer that needs some time."
"Overall, a superb brew. Deserves all the accolades it gets. This is the second time I've had the 2008, and it was outstanding again. Worth seeking out. Best stout period."
"Holy crap this beer is smooth and enticing, it could seduce me into just about anything. Thanks for the immense treat Eric, this made my move just so damn worth it."
"This beer is as good as the hype about it. I've had it three times; all three in las vegas. It is amazingly dark, seductively thick and the taste is a perfect blend of hops, alcohol and roastiness. Not too hot and even good to accompany food. The bottle version is a little better than the tap but both are excellent."
"www.theviceblog.com"
"The drinkability was decent despite the 11% abv. I would drink this beer all day if given the chance (within reason of course). I will definately be searching this great beer out again."
"Great with a pipe or cigar."
"Thanks to my man hrking for this particular bottle. Thanks to WasTrinkenSie for my 2008 in the cellar."
"D- Alcohol is to over bearing."
"D, and overall impression: Due to the high ABV, 11%, and the viscosity of the brew, I could not have many of these. But, probably one of the three best RIS I've had. I don't know if it is as complex as Dark Lord, but I definately think Abyss beats it in the taste department. Overall, this is a fantastic beer, and worth seeking out. Absolutely worthy of consideration for best beer in the world. Skal."
"This is a delicious stout that will only get better with age."
"D: I won't lie and say this is the most drinkable RIS ever. The flavor is quite good, but the alcohol finish takes this down a bit. As I said before, with some age I think this beer would go from great to epic."
"D--A sipper at 11% but so interesting it can't be put down for long."
"D- this is possibly my new favorite beer. the sort of thing that i would save my beer money for weeks before it came out...if i could buy it where i lived. what a shame. thanks again to brokenleadedcask for this bottle, and to mba3243 for my 07 bottle thats still waiting. wow. check this one out, its going to be worth the trouble."
"D - A very nice example of a RIS that is worth of its top 10 rating. Better then Dark Lord? Personally, I don't think so."
"D: I am not going to lie, this beer is dangerously close to being too sweet of a brew. But . . . it works incredibly. I have to constantly compose myself, keeping me from gulping and slurping. It is dangerously easy to pound. Flavors are great and so are the aromas. I am glad that you get some things in the aroma that you don't get in the taste and vice versa, but that shows this beer has more growing to do and has more hidden within. Leaves you optimistic to what this beer can offer with some time. That slight chemical smell is probably the only negative I can find, but I imagine with the alcohol fading, it too will with time. This is a fantastic brew and i look forward to aging the other I have. This can only get better."
"Not really any complaints here. If it were available here, I'd go for the case discount."
"D= Great beer. Not as amazing as I expected but still very very good beer. I'm impressed with the amount of flavor in it. The taste is a little hot though and the odor is a little low after hearing so much about how great the odor is. Very good beer though well deserving of praise but not as great as I have heard."
"D: So smooth and complex; this is a good one to sip for quite a well. Nice addition to the great week I'm having celebrating my 25th birthday. So far, I've had Dark Lord and Pliny the Elder. We'll see how many top ten's I can fit into this week."
"Overall this lived up to the expectations. The Abyss is everything you could want in a big stout - definitely worth the hype."
"Thanks to abecall98 for the trade. 22oz Bottle marked 164 08 0840G .A Pitch black color body with a creamy two finger brown head that lasts a long time and leaves loads of sticky lacing. Aroma of roasted chocolate malt, with notes of charcoal, espresso, smoke,vanilla and molasses . Flavor is big and malty, roasted taste with espresso, cocoa, dark bitter chocolate, tar and loads of liquorice. Full body,light to medium carbonation with chewy mouthfeel. Fairly sweet. Lots of bitterness with cocoa and coffe, nicely balanced, Really powerful beer. Due to a lack of beer geeks in my area I had to drink the whole bomber myself. Excellent!"
"I've get a little sick of all the RIS hype but this has put me in my place. This is a wonderful big, but still with some subtlties, brew. I have one I'm holding onto for a year... mmm."
"Overall one of the best beers I've ever had. Has that hard to find comination of balanced complexity."
"D: Honestly it would be impossible to keep drinking bottle after bottle, you really would fall into an abyss. A pure blackout, time travel, and forget what time you went to sleep. It deserves to be savored. I am excited to get my hands on a few more bottles of this brew."
"A big thank you to donkeyrunner for sharing this one with me."
"WOW. This beer truly lives up to the hype. Cracked a 2008 bottle, and wish I had a fridge full of them. Pours a near black, with a head that lasts the whole drink. The aroma is wonderful - some notes of espresso, and just faintly of bourbon. The taste is unreal. One thing I really appreciate is that it is not over-oaked, nor over bourboned. The alcohol is also very subtle. Perfectly balanced and carbonated, and the mouthfeel is very full bodied. I would say this is in my top 3 beers all-time, and one any stout drinker should actively seek out."
"Great beer that hits it right on. Cant wait to run a 06, 07, 08 Vertical"
"overall a superb brew and my first abyss...luckily i have one more cellaring away for another appropriate time to consume..."
"D = Definitely is good enough that I cannot think of other similar stouts I would want to drink first. It is powerful though, so though an enjoyable experience, it is not something that just goes down without thinking about it."
"Pours very dark brown - almost black that is somewhat opaque. Beautiful thick lacing paints the glass. Smells of alcohol, tobacco, and burnt malts support the nose. First sip is bittersweet with dark fruits, tobacco, licorice, vanilla, and oak all present and accounted for. World Class."
"Thank you Candace and Nick for partaking in this review with me."
"All of the flavors blended seamlessly and the alcohol was very well hidden. Drinkability was very good as well. A slow sipper, not because of the alcohol or richness, it was just that each sip was such a satisfying experience that it would have been counter-productive to rush the experience. One of the best beers I ever had."
"Assuming I had enough of a supply, I could happily drink myself into oblivion with this utterly superb brew. Nitro is the way to go here."
"I'm pretty sure this is what Jesus would drink."
"D - I could drink this beer every day! I get sad when I take my last sip from the glass. I dont want it to end."
"D- Yes! If it was easier to get, I could drink this once a week but I was glad to have help with the bomber, couldn't/wouldn't drink one by myself"
"M - Thick, viscous, full bodied, with a light, creamy, velvety feel. As I drink it, brown foam traces cling down the glass, one on top of the other, like a fat girl's neckrings."
"Have had this sitting in my cellar for at least a year and it was worth it. The appearance of the beer was jet black, like most RIS. The aroma was had sweet undertones of chocolate and coffee, AMAZING. The taste was even better, with a mouthfeel that saturated all of the taste receptors in the mouth and made ""jump with joy"". Although the beer is 11% ABV, the drinkability of this beer is very good and I could easily have one of these a day."
"A side note positive that can seperate this from some, is that it has reasonable availability. Way to go Deschutes."
"D - Super drinkable stout if your in that frame of mind. Filling and robust. Nice beer."
"This is a standout beer."
"I have had this on-tap as well and I have to say it took me quite a bit longer to finish the bottle than it took me to finish the same amount on tap. It's a little hotter in the bottle. Appearance is still the same. Opaque black, dark brown head, that sticks around for a while. Smells of coffee, chocolate, mollasis, alcohol. Taste as it smells but intensified 100% Very thick, chewy body."
"i had this beer while on vacation not to long ago.it was an over all good beer the color the flavor was in my opipion really good....as this was my first beer for reviewing.as i ma new to the world of good beers i belive it was a good start..and i look forward to trying many other good beers,"
"Top notch and won't pass it up. Sure, it's a little young but there's a lot of craziness in this one. It's got an edge like a street gang, no doubt. But it's profound as hell and the creaminess is like the soothing tone of a mother settling her little hooligans down. One of the great ones."
"As it warms up the chocolate flavors become more pronounced as does the anise and alcohol. Overall one of the best beers I've every tried. Really a great beer, will have many more of these I'm sure."
"Believe the hype!"
"Overall, I think a delicious beer. It's spectacular in its simplicity. But I just don't think it's as bold as many other beers. So, definitely give it a try. It's completely worth finding one. But I might think this more because of the fact that its The Abyss, and not based on its taste."
"Again, can't give this one perfect scores for drinkability simply because I could never drink 5 of these in a row, but it deserves at least a 4.5 for being absolutely delicious."
"Very smooth and creamy and too easy to drink for the abv."
"D - Taking time to enjoy this brew, the 11% certainly sneaks up on you. Deschutes has done a great job masking the force behind one hell of a malt backbone and a silky, creamy mouthfeel. For this style of beer, the drinkability is damn near perfect."
"Good thing I bought 8 of these this year. Now I have enough to cellar and to enjoy for a while."
"Unbelievably balanced and exceptionaly drinkable. I would love to see how this one ages."
"D: I had to give it a 5 since I was really sad when I was to the last sip! I can't wait to try it a year or two. I have a couple more to sit on for a while."
"D- Highly recommended and easy to drink."
"An unbelievable beer. There are so many flavors and aromas going on with this beer, just layers upon layers. That said, i didn't feel like it was too much at once, like many RIS's. The drinkability is very high for the style. The only thing stopping me from drinking multiples of this in one session is the alcohol. Balance is great in this beer. Too often, oak or any other additive will overwhelm the base flavor profile. But this beer is so well balanced with so many different flavors contributing. One of the best stouts i've ever had, i only wish my favorite brewery would deliver to the east coast."
"D - Immensely enjoyable and very smooth, though the alcohol definitely catches up to you by the time you finish it. It's also fairly heavy, making it hard to drink too much of it, as much as you'd love to."
"Drinkability: It's like drinking a dessert wine only better! I could definitely drink a whole bottle of this to myself, despite how alcoholic it is. Love this beer."
"I dont know if I could drink another glass right away. it was a pretty heavy beer, but I cant wait to try it again!"
"A world-class beer, absolutely. Everything seems so restrained and thought out, rather than packing it full of flavors with reckless abandon. It's hard to crack the top of the list of Russian Imperial Stouts, but I can't argue that this one doesn't deserve its place. A truly brilliant beer!"
"Drinkability - The mouth unfortunately doesn't up the drinkability of this beer. The overall presence of burnt charcoal is what merely destroys the drinkability of The Abyss. It really is a shame, considering how last year's was so drinkable and left me wanting a whole bottle to savor on my own."
"This beer is completely and offensively over-hyped. I guess somewhere along the lines we never gained a strong sense of shame. Apparently the schools can't teach us everything. I heard that last years was amazing and much better than this years, and I would believe it. But for now I say screw this beer and the horses' ass it rode in on. Shame on those who give this an A just because it's hyped up...shame"
"D - the alcohol is well hidden. The flavors aren't over the top. This beer is surprisingly drinkable. I definitely wish I had another in my cellar."
"D-Smooth, rich and oh so enjoyable. I would be hard pressed to find a widely released, read no special one-day event thing, RIS that was as complex, drinkable and enjoyable as this. Do yourself a favor and fall into the Abyss, you will be glad you did!"
"This is definitely a sipper. And at 11%, this is an end-of-the night beer."
"Overall impression: Outrageously good beer. Even fresh, it dominates most other big stouts. Can't wait to see how this bad boy ages."
"Overall: this stout is the nectar of the Russian czars. It just oozes all the goodness that you expect from the style. Its hard to go back once you stare into the abyss...other stouts just don't hold a candle!"
"Dark, inky pour with a great one inch head in a snifter. Excellent lacing. Deep sensory aroma with lots going on. The taste is sublime. Excellent mouthfeel with multiple arenas of flavor. Even better once it warmed up a bit. A bit too rich to have more than 10oz (the snifter pour) at a time, but the bomber might be worthy of sharing as an alternative to port after a big steak dinner."
"This one is beautiful. It's pitch black and shiny, with a giant brown head, leaving great lacing and retention. The smell has a good bit of roasted sweetness, brown sugar, black patent, roasted barley. And there's even a note of spiciness with the alcohol. The taste is nice. There's a bit of sharpness initially from the alcohol and black malts. There's actually a funny sweetness mixed in with a bit of dryness. Buried down deep is a nice chocolatey flavor, with a deep brown sugar taste. I'd say this one could be overpowered by black patent if it weren't for the barrel-aging and licorice, and this is my main complaint with the flavor. I think there's too much to hide behind, which makes for an easier to accept beer, but I'm afraid of what lies behind. The mouthfeel is less than stellar for a BA beer. There's a bit of prickly carbonation, and it even tastes kind of thin, there's lots of flavor, but they aren't enrirely complete. There is a note of creaminess, once you work your way into it and the carbonation subsides. This one continued to pull me back in, though. I really enjoyed drinking it, and the recommendation goes without saying thanks to its spot in the top 100."
"Overall: Easy to drink for a RIS despite the thick mouthfeel. To me this beer is really predictable. I was hoping for more of a woody/nutty flavor but just didn't find it."
"Exceptionally silky and smooth, this is easy to get lost in. The alcohol doesn't feel like 11% but keep enjoying this and eventually you'll learn the hard way. Beyond that, this here is a classic and definitely lives up to the hype."
"I am currently drinking one of my six bottles of abyss. This one has sat in a ref. for about two months at 45 degrees f. It has mellowed from the first few i've drank. It poured with exceptional head and carbonation. One of the few truely wonderful beers in the world. I am a huge fan of oak aged beers and this one leaves you wanting more!!! The taste is rich and strong without the high alcohol % taste most other strong beer give off. This is one of the most well rounded beers i've ever had. I cannot wait to drink my others! AMAZING JOB DESCHUTES, keep em' coming!! A+++"
"Overall- This is a great beer. Nice subtle complexity."
"Mouthfeel was full not chewy. Slightly slick. The only negative I can muster is just a little too boozy even after a year. Otherwise this is en exceptional beer."
"What you have his in a fantastic beer, worthy of all the accolades. Worth hunting for."
"Overall, I think this is good for the style but was surprised that it ranked higher than Dark Lord. Overall, it is a very good beer and I will take any opportunity to have another."
"Pours a dark black with a nice tan head. Smells of chocolate, coffee, bourbon and some roasted malts. Tastes amazing, I get the chocolate and bourbon flavors first followed by molasses and finished with a nice coffee flavor. Mouthfeel is full bodied like most imperial stouts. Drinkability is high, I'm glad I have one of these left but I'm going to let it age for a while. I wish I could get this in Wisconsin."
"Excellent beer for aging. I took extensive notes on this beer and its changes, so these are just the highlights. These bottles were aged incredibly well and didn't pick up a hint of oxidation or negative aging effects."
"Wow! it has been worth waiting the month or so to drink this. 2 fingered head in the Duvel tulip. The dark mocha head sits upon a quicksand of black goodness. No light escapes. Decent lace. Chocolate,coffee hits the nose,followed by a bit of dark fruit. The mouthfeel is a creamy goodness, a warm toffee,coffee chocolate goodness. Hard to think this could get better. oh wait, there is a bit of alcohol that might mellow. Hmmm next year and the next year are dates to look forward to. I drank this after the best Stone RIS I ever had, plus a Stone 11th,but this performed big time."
"Fairly dry flavor, with a slight fizz noticed up front. Gritty mouthfeel...chocolate nibs, coffee bitterness, dry hopped finish. A touch hot with bourbon ooze. Nice brown oil slick film formed towards the middle of the tasting."
"D- Easy to drink, but will only be drinking one. Damn it, I said that after Hopsickle. I wish I had more of these. Definitely going on my wants. I think I'm gonna be giving more stouts a try! WOW!"
"this is a fantastic beer extremely smooth and easy to drink, at 11% are you kidding this is extremely good yum"
"Ok I'll give you that this is defiantly on par with Kate in it complexity although two different animals when it comes to flavors that present themselves. This is a wonderful Ale and deserving of a place in one of the best out there. Yes I will drink more of this and would seek it out"
"Pours opaque black with brown head. Nose is among the best I've experienced - heavy chocolate, nougat, and a suggestion of German black forrest raspberry chocolate cake. Palate is silky smooth, more roasty chocolate, and a finish that carries into lighter milk chocolate with little presence of alcohol. A world class dessert beer."
"Oh wow. Holy crap! Insert more explitives here. This is one good freaking beer! I had the pleasure of trying this ON TAP at Father's Office in Culver City, CA. I couldn't believe it was on their menu. The guy at the counter realized that I was in for a treat, apparently not a lot of people order this one, I couldn't believe it. The appearance is like nothing I've ever seen before. Someone before described it perfectly - khaki head. But, in addition to this, it looks like Turkish coffee, and like the Turkish libation, I'm conviced that if you drink enough of this, you'll see the future. The taste was unbelievable - chocolate, coffee, dates, and...nectar of the Gods, basically. Smell was your typical stout smell - molasses and coffee beans. Drinkability is down only because of the thickness and the abv, but the taste and appearance all make up for it. This is one I will seek out whenever the cold winds blow, and I need a truly imperial stout."
"The Abyss is awesome, and I wish I could get it around here. I don't know when the next chance I'll get to have it will be, but whenever I find it I will get as much as I can."
"it pours black as the abyss with a nice chocolate head. the nose is a lil boozy but not bad, chocolate, big malts. the taste is again chocolate and just massive amounts of malts. A HUGE ale, pretty sweet, full bodied. ""Today, Sullivan"""
"Drinkability: The mouthfeel really helps boost the drinkability of this 11% brew."
"Overall impression: Wow! what an outstanding stout. The complexity is astounding, but the balance is really what stands out. You can taste everything but no one element dominates. One of - if not THE - best examples of the style!"
"Mouthfeel is very thick and the beer has an extremely long coffee-like finish. Drinkability is about as good as it gets for a high ABV RIS. Probably my favorite RIS so far, and I really wish it was more readily available."
"EDIT: I've had the 06, 07, 08, and 09. But this was finally unseated by BA Speedway as the best stout on the planet."
"D: Decent, but too strong. I'd love to see what a year would do to mellow it out."
"Overall, find me another."
"D- A bit on the strong side; a bit boozy. This beer is outstanding, but maybe requires a bit more time to fully settle down. I am blown away."
"I think that while this beer is good, it probably is just a tad overrated due to it's rarity."
"D - This is a great RIS and quite drinkable despite the high ABV. Really a great brew."
"An awesome beer. One of the top five imperial stouts I've ever had."
"D - Wow! This is an impressive RIS for sure. This drinks like a champ for such a hefty alcohol presence. At 11% ABV, this is about as drinkable as you can get for a RIS, especially one that is as complex as this."
"J"
"poured black with a smooth viscosity and a dark tan head. Aroma of bittersweet bakers cocoa powder, slight to no coffee, vanilla, and burnt brown sugar. Taste parallels the aroma but with a very nice oak notes, vanialla hints, some molasses - no licorice. Excellent medium mouthfeel, that is slick yet dry - I could drink many of these but I am confident that time will lend complexity --- please!"
"D: I am so glad I waited a year with this one. I've had it fresh before and it is still phenomenal, but in a different way. This tasting wowed me above expectations. I didn't think The Abyss could get that much better. This makes me want to seek out additional vintage bottles. Future vertical tastings? I'm in."
"D: Tried this from the bottle on Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve. Also, had a couple snifters on tap at Collins in Seattle. Quite frankly I could not get enough of this beer. With or without food this is an absolute treat and an absolute recommendation. If the 1974 movie Black Christmas had to be summarized into a beer then here it is. Don't go in the attic unless you're ready to be wrapped in plastic. This goes well with loud music or loving company. ""Drugs; sex; every sort of filth. And you hate the police, don't you?"""
"Overall I would say its nothing more then an average RIS, but it surely does not live up to the hype it gets"
"PostScript: I can't help but compare to Brooklyn BCS, I get so many of the same flavor profiles here. BCS is a little hoppier in the finish, and a little rougher on the initial drink. I can't help but wonder what happens when the BCS in my cellar gets a year on it. But Abyss is like an even awesomer version of BCS."
"Stoked I found this one."
"pjeagles; You da man now dawg!"
"Shoutout to pjeagles for his generosity. He bought this all the way from NM to MA for me and my buddies to share. You, sir, are a beer hero."
"I wish I could drink this beer more often. I will buy as much of this black beauty as I can get my hands on in the future. World Class."
"By far the best stout I have ever had. Amazingly complex, delicious, and drinkable. I wanted to dip oreo cookies in it."
"Similar to original tasting, but more oak and bourbon is noted than before. Solid oak presence on the palate, adding a touch of tannic astringency. Still rich, smooth and creamy. Top notch."
"Drinkability is also amazing. although i dont think i could have more then a few before i'm feeling buzzed / drunk, after finishing it i really do want more.."
"T. Sweet bourbon, oak dryness, all smells mentioned above, bitter coffee all the way through al little rough on the mix of flavors but still great. Creamy and crunchy. I would categorize this along with Bell's Expedition Stout as being a bad boy of the style. Its not a smooth and user friendly drink. It kicks you in the mouth and really makes you dig deep into you palate to savor the greatness of this beer."
"D - This beer is really not meant to be drunk quickly being rich with flavor and 11%. However, the explosion of flavor beckons you to drink again, and again, and again. I wish I had a keg of this beer."
"D - Ok if I could find this but can't. Also, at 11%, little high....just right though for a RIS. Would I drink again? Yes but I think a few more years of aging would do this beer wonders."
"The best imperial stout that I've had thus far. I can't wait to see what a few years of age will do to this beer."
"Mouthfeel is slick and not as creamy as I remember it being. Well carbonated. Good beer, but not as I recalled it."
"On draught at Freakin' Frog in Las Vegas. Pours black as night with a medium and foamy light brown head that has good retention. Rings of lacing on the glass. Big aroma of cocoa, roasted malt and bourbon. Rich body with bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt, coffee and a bit of spice. Light smoke and bourbon in the background throughout. The finish is full and moderately bitter coffee and hops with a sharp alcohol aftertaste. Would probably benefit from aging a bit. Overall this is a very good Imperial Stout."
"D- I have alot of these which is dangerous as I could drink a couple of these pretty easy in a good night, superior drinkability for the abv."
"I think for beers this size drinkability has to boil down to how enjoyable a beer is to drink, not how easy and following this line of thinking this beer is an absolute joy to drink, so complex, so thick and rich. Each sip brings something new to the table its hard to imagine how anything could improve on this, but I suppose only time will tell. So glad that I have more than one of these. Easily lives up to the hype, absolutely wonderful beer."
"Abyss is truly the best name they could have come up with for this thing. Black Hole is the only other thing that even comes close, because absolutely no light shines through this mother. Beautiful tan head as well. Smells like coffee and nuts and some whiskey notes with a little hop scent buried in the back. Huge licorice flavor with notes of chocolate, molasses and bourbon, very roasty as well. Beer doesn't get much more perfect than this one, I just wish they'd produce more every year!"
"D - Alcohol is fairly well hidden."
"Easily one of the best beers I've ever had. Just outstanding in every possible way. Having his with some chocolate and tiramisu right now. One of the most complex tasting beers I've had the pleasure of tasting. The chocolate, coffee, licorice and bourbon are so well balanced with the 11% alcohol that I could drink 10 of these. Smell is like an open fire under your nose. Probably the most 'warm' beer I've ever had. There is so much going on here. I want more!!!!"
"The ""problem"" with the Abyss is that it sets a new benchmark for imperial stouts. Or put another way, will I be able to age the remaining four bottles before the craving sets in?"
"*Bonus Reino comments* I've had quite a few Abyss bottles, even some with age on them, but I just now got around to reviewing it. I've always loved it, but it's never been my favorite big stout. I feel like their are a couple better, and a couple that are just as good. Anyways, it's a great beer and kudos to Deschutes for not raising the price this year, and making it available to more people."
"Overall I would have to say this is one of the finest crafted beers I've had. Definitely worth the hype! I wish more BA stouts could be so well put together."
"Pours a thick, black with a decent brown head that stays for the duration. No clarity. I was unable to pull a lot of aroma, some malt and subtle alcohol tones. The alcohol seemed to rule the aroma but not so in the taste. Taste was an excellent blend of coffee and chocolate and I was able to pull some hints of alcohol which is expected for an 11% beer. Excellent mouthfeel, good heavy body. I recommend trying this beer but it is heavy and packs a heavy punch. Taste wise and if enough was available I would drink this all day."
"0 - Amazing. Am going to hold on to a few to see how they mature with time."
"D - Very easy drinking and the alcohol is hardly noticeable. Deceptively easy to put down."
"8/5/8/3/15 (3.9/5)"
"taste is creamy and thick, bakers chocolate, dark chocolate, coffee, woody, black licorice, some walnuts, caramel, a little smokiness, and a touch of vanilla, excellent bitter ending that is just a touch on the dry side."
"D: Incredible. Glad I held off on this one for a while and saved it for a night like this. This is a damn fine beer. Big and bold while not hitting you with a hammer. THe barrel aging did something really nice for this beer. No hint of the ABV at all. World class."
"Had this beer @ a stout tasting @ my house last night and it was a huge hit. The appearance is very nice jet black with a 2 fingered brown head and tons of lacing. The nose was one of the nicest noses I have ever smelled on a beer, hints of bourbon, some chocolate, some vanilla, tons of malt and hops. The taste of this beer was beautiful, hints of the bourbon barrels, vanilla, choclate and a large hop flavor for a stout. The mouthfeel was very nice and the carbonation level was very good as well. Exceptionally drinkable and I could only look forward to the next time I get to drink this beer."
"cheers"
"Recently revisited this one with some friends, this time an '08. Absolutely fantastic. Not aged as long as my first sampling (the '07 was about a year old) but this tasted every bit as good. Oakiness was much stronger on the fresher bottle, a little more bourbon could be noted. What a great beer. Scores the same."
"This is an incredible imperial stout and it's obvious this one will hold up to cellering. Somewhere between 4.5 and 5 for taste."
"Well what can be said that already hasn't been mentioned? Once again, if you like this style of beer, and especially the taste of coffee in your beer, this is probably as good as it gets. For the price ($9.99 for a 22 oz bottle) it's quite a bargain. All in all this is a very well done beer from the folks at Deschutes. One of the best beers in the world? That's up to you to decide."
"D- This was a very nice and drinkable stout but it, in my opinion, didn't live up to what I though it would be. I'll definitely have it again though, given the opportunity."
"D: This is a strong beer that packs something of a wallop but compared to the other that are the top and well regarded, this one doesn't stand up as tightly. Again, it is well above average but just not world class in my opinion. The 22oz was just the right amount as it really let its character out on different sips, primarily from the warming."
"Dark like the night with a minimal coffee tan head. Smooth, chocolate, coffee, roasted malts. Incredibly tasty with a fantastic aroma that draws you in. Only downside is trying to finish more than one pint. Abyss is a big beer but I'll gladly drink it again any day."
"Drinkability... hmm... What do you rate something that would be the one thing you take to a desert island?"
"Was able to enjoy the '07 right next to an '08. Pours an amazingly dark jet black. smells full bodied, with large hints of cocoa and coffee. The '07 has mellowed out quite nicely, the '08 needs some time, but was still deliocious. This beer coats your pallet and stays with you all the way. A sipper but not a sipper like Goose Island. Get some of this and put it away for a few years and you won't be dissapointed."
"2008 bottle. Pours a pitch black with an excellent dark tan retaining head. Smells like syrupy espresso and dark chocolate with some woody undertones. Tastes of bitter chocolate, molasses, and subtly hoppy. Velvety smooth and thick. Coats your mouth with delicious flavor. Roast finish. This beer is hard to put into words as you just want to forget everything while drinking it because you may be in stout heaven. Deschutes never ceases to amaze."
"D-It is wonderful, but one 10 ounce glass is about all that I can handle at a time (three times, so far). This is definitely a last beer of the evening. I had my second pint at a happy hour and I was done as soon as I finished. It was 7:00 and I couldn't even think about following it up with anything else or even a second."
"D: I did not taste any liquorice (as it states), but in any event a great friggen beer. Man, I have been looking for this in the bottle everywhere and can not get a hold of it. I can see why! great, great stuff! This is how the beer gods reward us, with beer of this caliber! I also must admit that I was just getting over a 24-hour flu bug and my senses were not 100%. I debated about ordering this guy as I might lack the true palate of flavors, in any event I could not say no!"
"D- Very drinkable and nice just not quite there with darkness or aged dark lord. I'm thinking a bit more time aging will help."
"D- so rare, but i love it. simply amazing."
"This is a bottle of the '07 Abyss poured into a very sturdy Rogue chalice. Pours black with a beautiful brown head that dissappates quickly. The aroma is bold and very upfront. It had the bourbon aroma from the barrels. I'm not a coffee drinker and with age the coffee flavors and aromas have really come forward, which is why this beer loses a few points with me. The mouthfeel is exceptional. Well rounded and fulfilling. This is very drinkable, caution is advised. You should drink this beer when you get the chance and let some age when you get the chance."
"Pours an opaque black with a small tan head. Aroma was mostly alcohol driven. Light roast malt aromas mostly of a rich coffee like espresso. Flavor is very smooth. Just the right amount of malt to make it very drinkable without having to wait years for it to mellow out except for the high alcohol that leaves a warm burn on in your throat. Thinner than a lot of Imperial Stouts. Carbonation is just right. This is so easy to drink its unbelievable. A good beer but not as good as Big Skys Ivan the Terrible that is a somewhat the same type of beer."
"Pours black as night with a thin layer of chocolate head, good lacing throughout. The smell is pretty great; chocolate , slight oak, not much roastedness which I enjoy, and hints of vanilla. The taste is pretty damn well balanced, very similar to what I smelled. This is one of the first barrel aged RISs that I've had and I like what it's done for the overall flavor. The alcohol is nearly gone considering this was an 08'. Drinkability is high for this amazing beer."
"The smell is lovely (though maybe just a tiny bit hot of alcohol). It's beautifully dark brown from the bottle, almost black and completely opaque in the glass with a thin, dark chocolate head. The smell is roasty, smokey, with a definite molasses sweetness. There is no burnt taste--that's the one aspect of this style that I like least; so I'm happy that it is absent here. There is coffee and chocolate in both the nose and the palate. The flavor is sweet, but the mouthfeel is dry. Many brewers add candy sugar to try to achieve what this beer accomplishes, but it doesn't generally seem to work to me. There is no candy sweetness here; instead the sweetness seems to come from the molasses and natural grain sugar. Though the smell is a just bit hot, the alcohol is very well hidden in the taste--something I really like in a high alcohol beer. This beer is brewed with licorice and I notice it in the middle. The oak adds just a bit of spice to the finish. The malt profile is really full and constitutes the biggest part of the taste--the roasted malt is on point and really great. As for drinkability, I'm sharing this bomber with a life-long friend--we both wish we had (at least) another bottle. The friend I'm sharing the bottle with, says he thinks the bourbon barrel aging adds to the depth of the smokiness. I'm going to get another bottle (at least) tomorrow at Hi-Times. I LOVE THIS BEER!!"
"Thanks to both Largadeer and Lothore for sending me bottles of this in my first 2 trades."
"D - great balance and complexity"
"I was a little disappointed with the beer overall. I had heard it was a good beer to have in a collection and the challange to find it was great--granted the drinkability is awesome and I would buy again if I had the chance it just wasn't as mind blowing as I was hoping for."
"I will certainly trade for again."
"Ovr: this was the 2008. I bet it's be really great with a year on it, just to smooth it out a touch. There's a bit of harshness on the finish and it could probably benefit from resting. Very very nice, but I'm comparing this to the best stouts I've had this year, Dark Lord and Darkness, and I've have to put this behind both of them. Still worth seeking out, however."
"Tap @ Pizza Port Carlsbad. I was so excited when I saw this, and I can happily say that it lived up to all of my expectations. Midnight black pour with a thick, 1 cm tall brown head. Heavy aroma of burnt coffee, tobacco, chocolate, molasses, leather, wood, and just a little bourbon. Amazing taste. Lots of roasty malt, bitter coffee, baker's chocolate up front and throughout. A deep, rich oak taste accompanies the sweeter molasses and licorice flavors. A bittersweet finish with just a little caramel malt and hop bite. I could drown in this beer its so good."
"This beer pours jet black with a nice mocha color head that disappears quickly and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Smells roasty with chocolate, espresso, raisins and rum. The taste follows the aroma and does not disappoint. This beer has many complexities and it seems like I discover another with each sip. Starts with a sort of citrus taste then Chocolate, coffee, rum, raisins and figs. The aftertaste is of strong coffee and has that lovely chewyness. The mouthfeel has medium to full body and is incredibly smooth and nicely carbonated. Drinkability is excellent considering the high abv. One of the best stouts in the world? Who cares, this is a great beer."
"NB: Why on earth do they only age a % of it in oak? Put the whole thing in the barrel!!!"
"Edit: This was my first (and only) perfect 5 review I've ever given out. However, after having had many more RIS's since then, I have adjusted the score accordingly."
"2007 version on tap at City Beer in San Francisco. Poured jet black with a thick foamy brown head. Some wispy lacing on the glass as I drank. Flavor of deep roasted malt with some bitter chocolate, almost like a bitter chocolate milkshake. Maybe a little coffee in there. Aroma was similar, with the chocolate a little more dominant. In my opinion, the roasting was maybe a little too aggressive, as this is a pretty bitter brew. Very thick and rich mouth feel, and surprisingly drinkable with all that alcohol."
"The beer is, of course, highly drinkable. Its 11% abv tastes like smooth fire and the smoke grows and grows on you. It's a shame that I tried it so early. Now, I'm just going to be counting the days on the bottles in my cellar. Thank you, Deschutes, for this phenomenal beer."
"As thick as expected in the mouthfeel! Smooth as silk. As if the flavor explosion isn't enough for your mouth to handle, this beer's thickness makes a statement. gentle on the palate, and very warming. perfectly carbonated. extremely drinkable. The most I've had in a single night was two 22oz bottles and I felt like I was going to explode (although I ate a huge meal before that which probably didn't help). It's the kind of beer that you look at when you only have one drink left and think to yourself, ""I better savor this sip more than any other."" Goes down easy and fills you up, leaving you wanting more."
"Drinkability- I've had these bottles for two plus years, plus my other vinatges and finally tried one. Good...make that better than good...but not the greatness I was hoping for. Was thinking it would be a bit more thick and sweet. Guess I got spoiled by the Goose Island Bourbon County Stout I have been drinking recently. May get more sweet though as the years go on. Have heard the newer vinatges are sweeter. Still a solid two thumbs up."
"Goes down very well, and not overly strong, but still not one I'd be having too many of!"
"In fact I went to Nugget supermarket and grabbed a couple of bottles after I finished 2 pints. Couldn't believe they poured pints last night at the owl club."
"Docked a half point on drinkability due to the strong alcohol that will most likely smooth out with age (which is why I am aging some). This is by far the best beer I have ever drank. Now with my limited experience that may not be saying much, but I think other reviews of this beer pretty much say the same thing and I will definately get my hands on this whenever available."
"Overall, a great RIS. I'd still prefer a Port Santa's Helper, or the Surly Darkness I had the other night, but this is damn good."
"Overall, an intense and complex beer that I found to be very very enjoyable."
"This beer is a very holistic experience for me."
"D: Both were great to drink. Overall I think the '07 was better. Aging definetly improves the taste, mellows the stronger flavors yet enriches the more subtle notes. But both were a pleasure to drink regardless of the age."
"Overall: an awesome brew"
"Thanks to my brother Lofgrep for sharing this with me."
"It's what you would expect of a RIS but I was not as impressed as so many others who have rated this stout. It is a good stout and does taste good but I would prefer drinking a Stone RIS instead. In all fairness this might age well and taste better next year."
"This may be the imperial stout I've been waiting for. (Too bad I have to fly almost 2,000 miles to get another bottle!) As black as its namesake with a rich chocolate aroma. Creamy, dense caramel-colored head, and the creaminess carries over into the first sip right through the last. The flavor is a perfect blend of all the qualities you want in an imperial stout (though most that try to blend these come up a little off): smokey chocolate, raisins, molasses, a faint though unmistakable vinous undercurrent, and some boozy oak. Just sweet enough up front, just dry enough on the finish, with a slight, pleasant alcohol burn. Reminiscent of Leinenkugel's Big Eddy RIS, though more intense, and with a better, dryer finish. I'll be back in the Bay area in two weeks -- let's hope the shelves aren't empty!"
"I've stocked my cellar and hope they last through Spring."
"D - A little heavy for a long night, but 11% keeps the volume consumed in check so that it doesn't become much of an issue."
"I'm glad I held on to this for a year. I'll probably wait even longer with this year's batch."
"Toby, thanks again! This was truly a great experience. The complexity this beer offered was amazing. I sipped this beer so slow and tried to drag it out all night solely for the reason that it was the only bottle I had. This beer really makes me want to move out to the Northwest. Can someone send me more, please?"
"Overall very impressive and ceratinly worthy of its place on BA's top 10."
"Certainly glad I've got the chance to try this beer and glad I got a couple more to age and see how it develops, I think maybe another year will do wonders."
"Drinkability - worthy of the acclaim; I will cherish the remaining bottle or two for a few more years."
"So far this is probably the tastiest RIS I have tried to date. Just an explosion of delicious flavors. Get this beer!"
"Notes from and tasted on 1/18/07."
"pours thick and black with a one finger heavy tan head on it. the sent of licorice was verry faint. smeled of burnt malts and dark coffiee. the taste is full and rich, bitter at every stage. bitter chocklate, hops, and coffiee are the tastes of the begining. the middle is a hint of licorice and a mild sweetness that gets sour then the end is sweet alchoal and a bitter bite that wont let your tastebuds go. world class all the way!"
"Have one, have two. This is one damn damn great beer. It's up there with the DL and Kate IMHO."
"I cannot remember being blown away by a first impression like this in quite awhile."
"Drinkability is high. It's got great flavor, great nose, and it's crazy easy to drink for 11%. Just loved it."
"D: As heavy, bitter, rich, boozey and dark as this may be. It goes down very very easy. I wouldn't drink many of them but I could. This is a very fantastic beer, and I have not been let down in any way. This is a truly spectacular beer. Right on with everything this style is for. Perfect. Truly perfect."
"An incredible beer, one of the very best I have ever had. I can't wait to get some more of this stuff."
"looks a little thick, black as can be. a hard pour gets two fingers of deep brown foamy head that settles down into a thin layer on top. smells of booze and chocolate. the mouthfeel is fantastic. rich and thick, but still very creamy and velvety. it is surprisingly smooth and drinkable. the alcohol warms the chest a bit but the alcohol taste is not present. rich chocolate and carmel and coffee flavors with light hops floating in the background. very complex and well balanced."
"My compliments to the Deschutes team. Can't wait until the next version, but until I then I'll take solace in my bottles."
"Despite being a beer snob for only a few weeks now I can see why this beer gets the respect that it does"
"Great beer. This was our last bottle of about 8 or so we tried over the last 10 months or so. We've also had the pleasure of having this on tap. Terrific stuff."
"D: Very drinkable. Complex flavors. Good mild roast flavor in the end. Very enjoyable."
"D- So drinkable they even let me take a growler with me."
"Overall, an excellent beer that is worthy of the high ranking and hype. Most highly recommend. Get your hands on some now!"
"Really, really top rate, A+. I have another and I would like to wait 2 years to see.. but we'll see what happens."
"This is an intensely flavored, moderately complex and full-bodied beer. If you're a fan of vanilla, molasses, licorice, semi-sweet chocolate and coffee, then you'll need to try this one. There's a shitload of crafting mastering in this one, what a treat!"
"Overall, this is perhaps my favorite beer to date due to the reasons aforementioned. It comes with a slight punch to it, so I believe this one is best shared! Grab it if you get the chance!"
"Drinkability: Such a powerful, high alcohol stout that there's no way you could guzzle this. But why would you want to? That said, Abyss should have also been available in smaller bottles. Yes, we all enjoy sharing a bottle of tasty beer. But if it's a week night and your wife doesn't like good stouts, you end up having to waste some or get hung over."
"This is a fierce Russian imperial stout that definitely lies on the more extreme end of the spectrum for the style. With a bit more aging, this stuff could be amazing."
"Smell is of dark coffee and burnt sugars. Taste is very nice. Not over powering on any facet: Chocolate/liquorice notes are accentuated by mild woody tones. Coffee finish lingers a bit, but it is quite pleasant. Fine bubbles are nice and give the beer a good mouth feel Even with the high (11%) alcohol, this is not a hot beer."
"Drink ability: like with every time I have a good beer to review I want one now. Sad it only comes once a year, like Christmas, but definitely could have one everyday through out the day. Bit alcoholic of me I know"
"	Drinkability is effortless the glass will drain before your ready for it, it's easy to make it through a review without ever even stopping to take a note or complete a sentence. This brew kept my nose in the glass and my palate in touch with the contents of this awesome wax sealed bottled from the left coast. Another amazing experience I can carry with me in my beer journeys, thanks again Geoff!"
"D: 11% ABV is masked really well. The velvet (almost biscuit-like) texture and smokey/sweet flavor could easily pull me through a bomber and a half, tho I'd probably be knocked the hell out if I finished two. Awesome representation of a RIS. Was not let down by this one. It's not the best beer I ever had, but its up there with the best of them."
"D: This is a heavy drinking brew...but I swear I could drink it all night long!"
"This beer pours a thick, oily, black color. The head is half and inch in height, dark tan in color, and recedes slowly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of roasted malt, cream, graham crackers, dark chocolate, and hints of oak. The taste is burly, and bold without being over-the-top. Roasted malt, graham cracker, and cream open up the taste, leading into chocolate, and oak in the finish. There is a lingering roasted malt bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is full bodied, with appropriately low carbonation, and a velvety texture. This is a world class Russian Imperial Stout. I could certainly drink this again."
"Overall an excellent beer that i will be adding to my cellar."
"The flavour is strong, muscling through anything, with a tastes of baker's chocolate, liquorice, with a mild to moderate hint of coffee. The woody, smoky flavour really comes through pleasantly, with just enough presence to add additional direction to this beer. The beer drinks smoothly, with moderate carbonation that doesn't sting, and a oily finish that clings to the mouth. This is really a beer to have with a desert such as a cheese cake, or perhaps as a desert in its own right. The ethanol remains hidden under the malts and tastes of roast throughout, making it very easy to drink more than you intended. An amazing beer from a quality brewery. Deschutes has really outdone themselves with this offering."
"i cant wait till the next release. do yourself a favor and pick up a few bottles."
"Drinkability - This one takes a minute to adjust to, but its fantastically chocolaty and rich. I don't know if this is as easily drinkable as some, but its smooth enough to sip effortlessly."
"Thanks again, Monsone!!!"
"What started of a deep black with 1 cm head quickly dissipated to a brooding black liquid with but a few black bubbles. This beer looks like a Daniel Plainview wet dream. A quick whiff triggers the flow of neurotransmitters back towards my brain telling me I'm smelling dark chocolate with hints of molasses, burnt coffee, and dark fruits. The first sip provides a lovely amount of chocolate with a syrup lightly drizzled over. It coats the mouth quite well and leaves me wanting more of it's creamy, but still chewy wonder. As it warms hints of bourbon, incredibly small hints mind you, come through. I could drink this for quite some time. It is definitely a sipper. I feel like this would be a beer served in the coldest portion of the afterlife and you would be surrounded by only the finest artists discussing each others work and mocking every beer snob that says this beer isn't rare enough for his palate."
"D: Awesome beer. One of the best. Very smoothe and easy drinking."
"2007 bottle. Cool wax dip and label. Right from the start, BOOM this brew is stellar. Dark rich smoke, oak, lavish and layered. But extremely balanced. I'm guessing the acidity and alc just marry up perfectly with the complexity and strength this brew posesses. Intensity but elegant. Could also age this brew for several years. A bit of sweet but almost dry. Oily cigar white smoke, deep and rich coco and coffee but still subtle. $14+ is what this retails for I guess? Worth every penny."
"D : An excellent beer that is a sipper. One that I'd definitely want more of."
"The roast is quite powerful on the taste and definitely is the most prevalent flavor, and it seems to give the beer a slight astringency. The sweet chocolate is still there though, preventing the roast from being overpowering. The alcohol isn't quite as well masked as the aroma indicated, and there is some decent hop bitterness throughout. It is definitely both balanced and flavorful. It has a medium-full body to it, but the carbonation is a bit low. Overall, I'm not sure if it quite lives up to its reputation, but is still an excellent beer."
"Well I liked this. Look forward to buying more of the next release. Between Obsidian, Abyss, Black Butte, & Black Butte XX, Deschutes is making some top shelf stouts & porters. Recognize."
"Dark, really dark, thick looking. The head was wonderful: creamy, large, and dark tan. Looked like chocolate milk on top. Aromas of coffee roast and sweet chocolate. The first sip was hard to get to through the large head but once I got there, it was worth it. Sweetness up front followed by a roatiness and slight bitter to balance this full bodied beer. Just enough carbonation to make is easy to palate. All the hype of this beer is true. Definitely a good one! Easy to drink but watch out, 11% abv."
"D- Definately a beer to sip on"
"This is one of my favorite beers."
"Well done, Deschutes. You just make good beers. Mazeltov!"
"With that being said, the Abyss is definitely one of the better ""regular"" Impy Stouts I've tasted. It pours with a slight head that lingers until the finish. It smells of roasty/chocolate malt with coffee-ish notes. The flavor has similar characteristics, but with some dried, cocoa in there as well. It's not too sweet and is fairly balanced for the strength and style. The body isn't as heavy as I thought it might be considering the strength. Also, the barrel-aged character is well-hidden. More often than not, a barrel-aged beer tastes heavily of oak/bourbon/etc. Not so in this brew. It must be due to the fact (like the bottle says) that only 33% was aged in barrels. This is definitely the way I wish other brewers would incorporate their barrel aging. I liked this brew quite a lot so I can only imagine what other impy-stout-loving BA's might think of it. Recommended!"
"Drinkability is great. Very smooth and light, goes down easy."
"The Abyss has earned its reputation. Deschutes delivers an impressive imperial stout. Special thanks to NitroGen for sending this to me. Cheers!"
" A big beast of a brew for sure."
"Big thanks to Donnie2112 to sharing this bottle. There's no way I could have possibly polished off an entire bottle all by myself without taking a nap in the middle of drinking this thick dark brew. It's a great barrel aged dark roasted beer without any of the oak or bourbon flavors. It would have been nice to find a little bit of those 2 flavors, but this taste really didn't need them all that much because there were plenty of dark roasted flavors to take their place. Thanks again Donnie2112 for sharing this kick ass beer!"
"as far as this style goes it's definately drinkable I could keep drinking this stuff. I had it on tap at Uber Tavern in Seattle and found this to have a much more chocolate then coffee profile. That said I'm not gonna give it a perfect in drinkability because I don't think I could drink more then two of these."
"A standout Imperial stout for sure, and certainly one worth tracking down."
"Pours jet black with a chocolate brown head. In the aroma, oaky, roasty malt, and somewhat oatmeal sweetness. In the taste, same as the aroma, oaky, roasty malt and oatmeal sweetness. A mainly smooth big body mouthfeel, and a small dryness and oaky aftertaste. A big beer, hides the alcohol quite well, nice oak presence, a fantastic impreial stout."
"I had this on tap the only place outside of Oregon, or at least that was what I was told. See a review of the Fricking Frog in Las Vegas for more info. This beer was amazing! It reminded me of the first time I drank a stout and felt amazed. The appearance is a blck dark beer with a dark brown sugar colored head. The smell was deceiving, but extremely malty. I say deceiving because it was served to me a bit too cold, so the aromas have not woke up. The taste is strong, strong and more strong. It is truely an experience in that it is strange how great it feels in your mouth. There is heat from the high alcohol, but balance of the malt, and very little bittering from hops, but none is needed. It is like a warm blanket that has been soaked in sugar and coffee is wrapped around your tongue. Is is necessary to say this is heavy? The drinkability is great because all you need is one."
"Beer poured black as night with a very nice brown head. Nose is sweet mocha, coffee, and those wonderful northwest hops. Taste is perfection, a fusion of mocha, coffee, chocolate, hints of black licorice and molasses. It is well balanced as everything blends nicely into a coffee hop finish. Mouthfeel is perfection as well, a full bodied beer that is the ultimate in creamy smoothness. Drinkability is perfection as well. The alcohol makes a small appearance in the belly upon the first sip but other than that it is not noticeable. I always wondered if a bigger badder version of Obsidian Stout would be a perfect beer given how good that is. I am here to tell you it is pretty darn close! Must try for the Imperial Stout fan!"
"A wonderful brew. Each sip is complex and interesting."
"D- complexity of flavor would live up to hype alone, but this brew also happens to a looker and smells great. All around a phenomenal brew. Get it if u can"
"This beer is just amazing. Dan, why did you have to move to Chicago and leave me without a Abyss hookup? Seriously though, thank you for giving me the opportunity to try this beer."
"What an outstanding beer. A new top-10er for me. A delicate yet bold, complex but defined beer, and definitely one to be savored. If you see it, buy every last one."
"D: this is a rich, full bodied beer with relatively high ABV. Almost a meal in a glass, but a delicious one at that! 2-3 at most in a given session would be appropriate."
"Black with reddish mahogany edges that were visible in bright light. A solid cap of light brown foam appeared after the pour and settled into a thick ring and skim of bubbles after a few minutes. Lots of streaky and spotty lacing. Roasty, malty aroma with notes of smoke, licorice, toffee and chocolate, burnt and oaky, with a bit of alcohol. Very nice. Starts out sweet with a bit of fruit character, then moves on to a rich maltiness, lots of toffee and chocolate. Roast and licorice added complexity, along with some vanilla and bourbon. Solid pine bitterness and flavour was more evident towards the end. Charred wood and burnt bitterness in the finish. Full bodied, but not heavy. Carbonation was well integrated, fine bubbles, and on the low side. Significant alcohol warmth without hotness. Very drinkable for a big stout. Good stuff."
"M/D: Full, creamy body, can't complain here. Good drinkability, a sipper, booze can be felt somewhat and 11% is going to get you eventually. A very fine beer."
"One of the highlights of the BIF Race 2007 Sinister package from Eyedrinkale, The Abyss (2007 Reserve) came in a 22 oz. bomber with neck dipped in black wax. Luckily it was the pretty soft and came off without much struggle to allow me to get to the real attraction. The beer poured out absolutely black in color as expected, and holy crap did it have a dark head. The color of the head was like chocolate syrup at first, and as it died down to foam, it revered back to khaki. The smell was roasted coffee, but it did not seem overdone. The roasted aroma was mild enough to allow some light hops to poke through. The much anticipated first sip was quite dry and the astringency made my cheeks pucker. As I adjusted to the graininess, chocolate, toffee, malted milk balls, vanilla beans, oak shavings, and black coffee made themselves known. This was a big, bruising, hefty stout, and needed to be approached with the respect it deserved. Not very easily approachable, unless you already know you want something like it."
"This is truly a masterpiece. I think it would rank well above some other famous offerings if the rarity/hype machine were in its favor."
"Decanted from the bottle into a snifter. Pours a very dark color with a one-finger head that sticks around for awhile. Aroma of chocolate, molasses, and plenty of alcohol. Taste is huge on coffee, with some chocolate, dark fruits, and alcohol underneath. As it warms I can definitely taste some vanilla from the oak. Mouthfeel is quite thick and creamy. Awesome. This is obviously a sipper, so drinkability isn't incredibly high. Overall, this is clearly a well made beer, but my personal preference lies outside of coffee centered RISs."
"much thanks to srandycarter for this beer"
"If you're a hophead, you'll probably like this Imperial Stout. There a big load of hops in this beer, which creates a bittersweet sensation between hops and cocoa. Smooth and not too heavy in the mouth. Sweet upfront, then spicy hops come in and knock down the palate. The alcohol almost gets lost in there. After the hop smackdown, it clears up and bring s in a rewarding aftertaste of brownie mix chocolate. Sweetens as warms. For what it is, it's pretty drinkable. I enjoyed this immediately after I got off work, as my workplace sits next door to the establishment I consumed this at."
"Minor amount of harshness in sips 3-6 but after that is smoothes out. Quite silky in the mouth it almost has the feel of the high fat hot chocolate made with half and half from scratch. Really more of a sipping beer, I think a six-pack of seven ounce bottles of this would be ideal."
"Huge thanks to Blisscent for sharing this and to the new Providence Beer tasting group! Amazing beer. Pours dark black with a thick tan head. Aroma of toffee and molasses. Initial sweetness taste slides gently into a huge bitter finish. Bitterness comes in at exactly the right time. Great balance. Amazing flavors. One of the best beers I've ever had. Exceeds the hype!"
"Pours an opaque darkness with a huge foamy dark tan head that fades slowly, with sheets of lacing in its wake. The smell is really unique. At first i thought it was going to be overly roasted. Coffee, oats, chocolate, barrel aged vanilla and something that i couldn't put my finger on, until i peeked - and that would be the licorice. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied. As it warms the mouth reveals more and more of the 11% ABV...and that's a good thing!! The flavor is incredibly unique too. The best i can offer is that i get a wonderful rich oat-y anise and java thing that coats and lingers on and on. I'm pleasantly surprised that its far less roasted than i originally anticipated. This one is scoring huge points for imagination and creativity!!! Guaranteed not to disappoint. Highly recommended. Many, many thanks to Stoneman78 and largadeer!!! What karma comes around, goes around!!!"
"D: Amazing drinkability, especially considering the alcohol content. There's no sign of it, and it gets nicer as it warms, which makes sipping slowly a bit more rewarding."
"D - Great brew!! Very well crafted and balanced. Wouldn't mind having more of this beer if given the chance."
"D - Overall this was a good RIS but definitely not one of the top beers that I've ever had. The smoke dominated nose really could have been improved and been more complex. Despite the nose, the taste was complex and full of flavor and the mouthfeel was great as well. This was a beer that the more I had of it, the more it grew on me. However, I was a little let down with this being a top 10 beer."
"Thanks to blisscent for sharing this one. Served in a standard pint glass. Poured an opaque black with a mocha-colored head. Scents of chocolate, coffee, brewer's licorice and malt hit you in the face. Taste is consistent with nose, with the addition of vanilla and a subdued, balanced oakiness; just enough to enhance the flavors without dominating. Finish has a light hoppy character. Mouthfeel was silky without being viscous, and alcohol was well-hidden. The Abyss is by far one of the most drinkable RIS's I've had the opportunity to try. It goes down deceptively smooth and leaves you wanting for more. I plan on opening the bottle I was able to procure (thanks msubulldog25) sometime in the late Fall/early Winter and I am anxiously anticipating how this brew is going to continue to develop."
"Drinkability - I think this needs to age more. I can see where it would/could/should be in the US top 5, but I wasn't as flabbergasted as I thought I should be based on the high rating of this beer. I actually preferred the Stone IRS for drinkability both on taste and cost, probably the 2 most important factors in choosing something to drink regularly. However I bought a few of these and plan to try it again after it sits for a while."
"Wow. This beer not only lived up to the hype, it's way over-the-top surpassed it. This is Darkness-quality sipping stout. I'll be seeking this beer out as long as Deschutes can pump it out. Speaking of which, this is my first experience from the brewery, & I'll be seeking out more of their brews."
"This is my second Deschutes brew and they've both kicked my ass..."
"Good drinkability here, a great beer all around."
"Opened another bottle after three months. Both aroma and taste have more vanilla, caramel, and oak/whiskey now, with a hint of butterscotch. A bit more cherry in the taste also. The chocolate and coffee are still there, but are subdued a bit. Still amazing and holding up very well."
"I split this bottle with Stopper. Poured at cellar temp into a snifter. The beer pours pitch black with very thick and viscous tan creamy head of 2 cm foams up easily and fades to an edge layer. Leaves windowpane lattice as it recedes. Aroma is molasses and roasted malt mixing with brown sugar and some faint grassy hops in the background. First sip reveals a fairly thick body with smooth text and mild rolling carbonation. Flavor is rich with roasted malt and brown sugar, molasses, but not a lot of oak. Beer gets a little boozy on the finish with some warmth and peppery bite. This is a nice hearty brew, not for the fainthearted."
" Nose is rich malty chocolate and alcohol. Taste is toasted firey malts, sweet earthy raw sugar, with some alcohol on the end. Lingering roasty goodness. Mouthfeel is spectacularly thick, rich and smooth. Overall a very nice brew, exceptional but not perfect."
"i could drink this beer all the time although the high abv would prevent me from drinking too much."
"If you're a fan of dark beers, this one will knock your socks off, no questions asked."
"Great beer, I enjoyed this."
"D: Only one bottle for a few of us. Same with any RIS in a 22oz. bottle though. Tasty."
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/8"" dark brown head above the totally opaque dark brown/black brew. Head is quickly morphed in a swirly skim or small bubbles, with moderate amounts of leggy lace. Aroma is deep rich dark malts, chocolate and coffee, with vinous fruit character over lurking alcohol wisps. Taste mirrors, with the hearty malt sweetness allowing some fruitiness to peek through in the middle, and then alcohol just eases into play at the close. Mouthfeel is creamy and almost evaporates off the tongue in the back of the mouth, and drinkability is only slowed down by the glimpses of acrid coffee in the aftertaste. Looking forward to these with some age on them."
"This beer is very big. I got two, one to drink right away and the other to save for a special occasion after letting it age a bit. When it pours out it is very thick with a nice head. The bubbles seemed to look like a sea of golden pearls swimming around. The taste is dark, strong woody bourbon flavors with a smooth coffee taste. The finish is warming with a good presence of alcohol."
"Well rounded and complex"
"Seriously, if you see this beer, buy all of them off the shelf and take them home. This beer is amazing!"
"D - Drinkability is good. The high abv does not really show at all. This one makes a good sipping beer. Highly recommended if you can find it."
"Drinkability - if it wasn't for the dang ABV, I would love to drink this all day/night/year long"
"I can't wait to drink this after a year or so."
"Mouthfeel is a creamy full body. this is a pretty filling beer, I wouldn't drink one on a full stomach. A great evening sipper to be sure."
"In short, this one has aged beautifully. Lots of dark roasted malts, bakers chocolate and espresso. The toasted character has mellowed a bit and it's probably a touch better than it was fresh. Fantastic stuff and showing no signs of going downhill."
"Cheers."
"D: Very drinkable. I could sip this baby for ages....if only it wasn't so precious and scarce. Find yourself some of this beer, and lock it in a safe."
"D: The alcohol is a little much."
"D: It's a sipper but a damn fine one. Sit back, relax, and take your time to enjoy the Abyss."
"Overall: Delicious, very drinkable, very easy, very good. Yes, very good. Worth $10 a bomber? Well, a year or so ago, maybe not. But with prices going up like they are? It's worth every damn penny and then some."
"Bottle courtesy of Bchung52077: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a huge dark brown color foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of vanilla, light smoke and huge black chocolate notes is pretty intense but well balance as well. Taste is a sublime mix between some black chocolate, some light smoke, molasses, some oak and bourbon. This is a very well balance mix with no flavour taking over and completely overshadowing the rest of the flavours. Body is full with engine oil consistency but with a creamy texture as well and good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Not being a big fan of imperial stout usually I must admit that I was really impressed by the craftsmanship of this one."
"Thanks to Bitterbill for sending three more bottle of this wonderful stuff!"
"Mouthfeel is big and unapologetic. It brings a chewy, full bodied imperial stout and makes no excuses. This one drinks like a meal and can fill you up just about as good. Overall, taking down a whole bomber is definitely possibly, but I see this being best shared with some beer loving friends. Would make a damn fine companion around a campfire on a cool night. Cheers to Deschutes and to everyone who has traded me this beauty."
"d: I'm very glad I had help with this one, eleven ounces was about all I could take. If you like licorice you'll like this more than I did. Thanks to JohnGalt1 for the chance to try this one."
"D-I wasn't as impressed as some people I've talked to about this beer, but it is very good. I probably won't buy this again just because there are some really good similar beers in Colorado for similar or cheaper prices."
"D- I like this beer a lot. Nice flavors but my only complaint is the alcoholy nature of this beer. Very very tasty though."
"It's qualities are impeccable in the RIS category. It deserves to be ranked with the best."
"This beer was something of a paradox. For such a huge beer, it was incredibly balanced and drinkable. One of the very best imperial stouts I have ever tasted."
"D-Very drinkable. However, this beer is not all it claims to be. If you read the description on the bottom of the bottle, you will notice that it says ""Stout brewed with Licorice and Molasses with 33% aged in oak and oak bourbon barrels."" I get no oak from this beer. Although I am sure the oak contributed to the smooth character and mouthfeel, there is no character from the wood itself. I don;t get any bourbon or licorice. A bit of a dissappointment. Tastes like a Grande Reserve version of the Old Rasputin. In terms of Russian Imperials, it's alright, but certainly not worth $12 a bottle."
"D - this is a great stout. i didn't notice the alcohol while drinking it at all."
"This beer looks like used motor oil. Thick and black with a huge tan head. Bubbles form in the head to make the head look like peanut brittle. The smell is licorice and chocolate. I also got the smell of fresh split oak firewood. The taste is chocolate with a lot licorice. The abv shows a little. You almost need to chew this beer. It is very rich and filling. I could drink this beer again. Thanks to wcudwight for sharing."
"D-Could drink these all night if the 11% ABV wasn't hiding in there. Alcohol is well hidden in the taste-not hot at all. And the beer improves as it warms making me want to drink more."
"On a side note this beer was drank in honor of my Grandpa, who just passed away. Grandpa used to like a beer or two (or three...) and I saw it fitting to open this and drink in his honor. I dont think he would have had it any other way. The world will miss ya Mr. Ed."
"This is really an exceptional beer. Very drinkable for a beer of its size. Glad I had the opportunity to try it!"
"Pours black as night with a short lived nice tan head. Smells like chocolate cake, graham crackers, fresh baked chocolate cookies, and unique for an imperial stout, also with a hint of molasses. Taste is drying cocoa, roastiness, light cigar like tobacco-y flavors and char. Simply fantastic. Body is creamy but slightly drying at the same time. Perfect light to medium carbonation and the 11% is completely hidden to me. This easily lives up to the hype and is an amazing beer. Wow..."
"Appearance is dark rich black with a thick and creamy caramel head. Smell of dark rich roasted malts, dark chocolate, strong coffee. Taste is a lot how it smells with a good hit of alchohol. Mouthfeel is medium - heavy and creamy. Ordered this at a local restuarant and ended up being the best order that evening."
"Very nice flavor and aroma. Poured in to glass and allowed to warm for about twenty minutes. After the warm up session certainly noticed the bourbon and Pinot Noir characteristics start to develop more. I didn't however notice the Licorice flvor, but the beer might have still been too cold... Also has a mild caramel finish while still being rather pleasing on the palate.."
"Usually with heavy beers I am not quick to open up another, but with this one I wanted to keep on drinking this fine concoction all night long, or at least till I went to sleep."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. a little rough around the edges, but still good. i think this one would be great with a bit more time to allow it ot mellow and mesh together."
"Forget about the 11% abv, I could drink this all night long. It lives up to the hype. Please, someone send me another bottle."
"Very good, but perhaps not as good as a top 10. Incredibly worthwhile nonetheless; need to try this one aged a little longer to see how the bitterness evolves."
"Finally got around to cracking one of these open- good thing too, its starting to get quite warm here! Let me say right off that this beer is a good deal mellower than I expected from all the hype and reviews. I like it, but not as much as Kate, Ten Fidy, Bourbon County, Rasputins, and a number of others. Its a solid RIS, but its a bit overhyped. Pours inky black, but lacks a solid head and what is there isn't as powerfully dark as a Ten Fidy. In the aroma, you can certainly smell the molasses as well as some light coffee notes, some late chocolate, some fairly mellow licorice atouch of brandied dark fruit, and the slightest bit of vinous quality. It isn't as long as a Bourbon County nor as vinous and complex and fruity as Kate, and overall a bit lighter than expected, but still quite nice. The taste is also quite smooth. Not very vinous, but instead it leans toward the chocolatey with a bit of ash, more dark fruit, molasses and quite a bit of sweet licorice. Well integrated and quite delicious, but not quite as deeply flavored as Rasputins or Ten Fidy, and not quite as complex as Kate. Still, nice interplay of flavors. The mouthfeel is a bit on the viscous side, but surprisingly light in the mouth and not at all hot. As it warms a bit of bitter licorice on the end creeps in, but surprisingly, little roastiness beyond a deep char that is almost ashy. Drinks fairly well considering it doesn't blow the top of your head off like Bourbon County and is exceedingly smooth. Exceptionally good, but not the top of the heap."
"D - i would never turn one of these down, however, after a couple of rounds could become satiating due to the thickness....i should stop and say that the high alcohol would limit me...but in all seriousness i wouldn't think about it."
"This beer kicks all kinds of ass. Highly recommended."
"I enjoyed the Abyss but wasn't overwhelmed by the flavor. I am more impressed with the covering of the alcohol burn, however I rarely choose a beer by its ABV. I am more curious if the taste is affected by the draft serving vs. the bottle, so I will have to crack open a bottle of mine."
"Overall- Creamy smooth and delicious. Definitely worth the hype!"
"Awesome."
"I am not a big fan of RIS's, but this is a brew that definitely deserves it's hype. Next year I will be buying a few extra to cellar away."
"Terrific!!"
"D - Wow. Words can barely express how much this beer has blown me away. Honestly, age might render this perfection. I have never reviewed a beer this highly before (out of ~600). This is fantastic."
"Of the top-notch Imperial stouts I've tried, (Rogue, Storm King, Old Rasputin, Samuel Smith, Nøgne Ø, Yeti) this one tops them all so far. Too bad it's not more readily available. I guess it's so we can't have too much of a great thing."
"Drinkability is immense for such a high gravity beer. The balance and synergy of the flavors make for a phenomenal brew. This beer deserves its hype and its rating."
"I had this on tap at the Cafe Boogaloo in Hermosa Beach ($5 per draw, same price as all other beers on tap). This beer communicated ""Russian Imperial Stout"" in every way. It was dark and opaque with a very thick brown foam, and the bartender let it settle a little before topping it off. Nice. The smell was roasted malts and sweet malts, a little hint of chocolate but maybe I imagined it. The taste was really rich and sweet, with a little bit of roasty bitterness in the aftertaste. Very thick too. Really this lives up to the hype, it's good."
"The only mistake I made was tasting this alone, before I had any food. On an empty stomach, finishing this pint gave me a noticeable buzz. Not sure I should knock it for that, but I had the bottle on a similarly empty stomach, without nearly the effect."
"Drinkability: Seriously, this is a fairly well-made imperial stout. Absolutely stupendous? Nah, but better than most."
"D:This is a good RIS. Definitely a sipper. I would like to lay this one down for a bit to calm down the hops. Would be interesting to see what that does"
"Poured into a snifter. The Abyss pours an impenetrable black, which makes the name fit perfectly. A dark tan head sits on top, with a low rate of retention that eventually leads to the halo effect. Decent lacing. Not a very overwhelming bouquet, but I did pull out some sweet malts, bourbon, woody/oak, some liquorice and molasses. The first thing that popped in my mind on the first sip was...holy crap! Malty, rich sweet roasted malts, burnt flavors, liquorice. Nice hop balance. Bourbon hits in the end and rolls under the tongue. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy for the style. Moderate carbonation. Not sure how much of this I could drink in one session, but it is amazing. I would love to be able to buy it at will. Thanks for the trade SAS."
"D - A real pleasure to drink and beer that lives up to all the hype. Find it if you can! I see this aging well, but its a gem to drink fresh (or at least now). Alcohol is a strong component, but never cloying or over-apparent. Its 11%, so yeah, its not as drinkable as a session beer, but for a RIS its top-notch."
"This is a fantastic RIS, in its own way, and I'm glad that I've got a few extra bottles of this, as I'm sure it will age beautifully. Full, rich flavors and a fairly easy drinkibility for a beer its size, guarantees that this will be one Abyss you'll want to fall into again and again."
"People say this is a sipper... fuck that, I could pound this down. In fact, I'm doing my best to baby it since I only have this one... all thanks to someone's credit card declining. Thanks dude! You surely missed out on one of the best beers out there!"
"Smooth, syrupy mouthfeel with just enough carbonation to keep it lively. Dangerously drinkable if you like a big RIS...top notch stuff on tap, I'd like taste the bottled version to compare some day."
"Very nice! I will enjoy the growler I purchased this coming weekend."
"d: what amazed me the most is how well this beer masks the high alcohol content. the bottles I have are a bit warmer, but certainly not hot. I suppose they could use a few more months to mellow out a bit. on draft the alcohol was pretty timid... just a bit of warmth in the finish, and no notable boozy aroma."
"Pours a solid black with a huge tan head that subsided a bit, but lasted through the glass. Aroma gives up some chocolate, some oak, a sweet lactose type smell, some hops in the background. Really a lot going on here. Taste hits with some chocolate, some ash, there's some alcohol and an almost vinous and bitter character in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thick and a little gritty. Great complex stout, I can't wait to see how the other bottles develop."
"Drinkability is good but will certainly get better with aging. In two years this could really round out and be a stellar brew. As it is now, I like several other big barrel aged imperials better."
"D: Incredible! Where did the alcohol go? This drinks like a beer with half the abv of this one. Incredibly complex. Thanks to Liquid Solutions for filling my order!"
"This one lives up to the hype."
"It's been a contentious subject, but I, for one, believe it lives up to it's hype in terms of flavor. I'd love to have access to Dark Lord, and have for some time, but now I also would like to do a head to head comparison between it and the Abyss. Drinkability is outstanding as a nightcap, which, at the end of my workweek, I'm using it as. If Deschutes would brew this in a larger quantity, I'd be very happy, indeed."
"D: This is definitely a sipper and the 1 bomber will be more than enough. I'd love to try this with down the road to see if it mellows."
"D: At 11%, this beer doesn't pull any punches. I am not sold on Abyss in a fresh state; I think that several years in my cellar will really calm this beast down."
"Feel is creamy and robust, without getting syrupy. Nice dry finish. 11% was completely hidden, this was a fantastic Imperial Stout, glad I had the chance to try it."
"Pours a super opaque black, some red in the edges, huge thick light brown head forms, leaves behind some nice lace spots, good retention, forms a solid layer. Smell is very nice, bourbon, toffee, light smoke, chocolate, big roast, charred wood and oak, burnt raisins, alcohol, big in all ways. Taste is similar, lots of charred wood, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate roast, coffee, smoke, caramelized fruit, licorice, molasses and piney bitterness in the finish, super balanced. Mouthfeel is full bodied, viscous, low carbonation, warmth, pretty damn drinkable for such a big stout. Reminded me a little of Darkness. Lives up to the hype!"
"Never tracked down a bottle last year and barely gome some this time around, thank goodness I stopped there after the Stone Winter Storm, one of the best Russian imperial stouts I have ever tasted, right up there with Kate the Great, Darkness, and almost as good as Dark Lord in my opinion, just another reason to love Deschutes, I bet the 2006 version is drinking wonderfully right now, will definitely be drinking again soon, probably buying a case next year, cannot recommend this one enough"
"I don't know what to say; I'm totally bowled over by this beer. Whether you're a fan of Deschutes or not, if you like hop-forward NorthWest micros, this is one to get. And if you find it for the same trivial price that I did, for the love of god, grab a half dozen."
"d-- out standing beer - If I could ge a keg of this I would drink it every day ful bdy but not over the top, if it's possible this is a well balanced extreme beer"
"Full body with lower carbonation. Nice smoke character going on. Nice."
"Crawls out of the bottle with monsterous black legs like ink from a fountain pen. Head is rocky fat milk chocolate colored bubbles standing at three inches. Slowly fading head seems to last forever leaving some lace. Nose has roasted chocolate beans, smokey malt and zesty alchol notes that penatrate the senses. With first sip you get a rush of creamy chocolate icing like tones. The taste buds are flooded with sweet syrupy tones of esspresso, chocolate sauce, caco and toffee like malts. Twords the end of the palate you get a unique mixed balance of sweet zesty dark fruit skins and coffee bitterness which is rather dry. Drinkability of this one is very nice but the slight bitter bite on the back of the tongue is the only real low point of this beer for me. A great stout though, truely."
"Mouthfeel was thick and chewy. Finish was long and fairly bitter. Let this one warm up to truly enjoy all the flavors hiding in it."
"Decent beer. The astrigency of the alcohol detracts slightly from the drinkability but is more of a bothersome on mouthfeel and taste."
"Overall, this beer is magnificent! I think with a little age this beauty will be an exceptional brew!"
"Highly recommended. One of the best stouts I've ever had."
"Pours a very very dark brown, no light coming through from the other side. Smells of coffee, malt, a bit of chocolate, but not a very strong smell. Tastes like a rich version of Obsidian, which was really what I was hoping for, as Obsidian is my favorite American Stout. Coffee, chocolate, burnt nuts and malt. A very nice balance of flavors. Overall, not as thick and intense as some other imperial stouts, but this isn't really a bad thing because it's a great combination of flavors. I don't really care for a sludge-like beer. Extremely drinkable for this style. A first rate beer."
"Overall the style is easily one of my favorites, and bounces back and forth with an IPA for the top really, and this was the best I have ever had. It was just perfect. The aroma was perfect, the taste, feel, appearance, everything I just could not think of anything that could improve here as it was the epitome of the style and I am so glad I waited so long to try this one as my palate has really evolved and allowed me to appreciate this one more fully. Could not think of a better selection for my 800th review. This was perfect and anyone who can get this and does not try it is a fool."
"Thanks to JohnGalt1 for throwing this one in as an AWESOME extra in our past trade."
"It has a very dark color with a nice tight brown head. It smells roasty, chocolate, and a little like raisins. It has a multitude of flavors that make it more like a desert than a beer. I wouldn't recommend having more than one, but I could sip on and enjoy one of these near the end of any meal. It is full bodied, and not cloying or too dry--it is balanced just right. Excellent beer overall."
"Being dry is usually a good indicator that the body is going to be thin and this is no exception. Not thin in an absolute sense but thinner and less viscous than the 2007. Low/med carbonation, just right. Over all the beer is nice, but again a let down."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy. This is like drinking a coffee and chocolate shake. Flat out delicious, and perfect except for my dislike for the smoke flavor."
"D:The only two things that keep this from being one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had is the cost (roughly 10$ a pop) and the high ABV...other than that this beer has it all."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly drinkable. Exceptionally smooth at the same time that it is unendingly complex. Overall, one of the best RIS's I've had."
"Overall, this is a great beer. Huge and complex without being too much. The barrel flavors are not dominant but instead pop up to add spice. Definately a great RIS."
"Yum really good!"
"Moderate carbonation and thick body with a slick viscosity. Decently drinkable now, but is sure to improve with time in the cellar."
"I do think that I have finally found the best Imp Stout that I have had the pleasure of tasting. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Overall, just awesome. Glad I didn't wait to try it as there's such a lovely hop profile in the back. I'd be curious to see how it ages but feel like it might suffer from the hop-loss. Leaves off a little bitter for my liking and the oak becomes a bit more dominant as it warms, but not overwhelmingly so. In the end, a great RIS with characteristics unto itself."
"glad to have tried this one! Definitely worthy of the work many have gone through to try this!"
"D: Bold, exceptional, take your time, take an hour or more. Sup accordingly."
"Great for after dinner, you'll be happy sipping this one for an hour or more."
"Pours pitch black and lightless with 1 inch of bubbly tan head that fades fast leaving good lacing and an oily residue. Smells are very salty, like soy sauce and leather. Coffee grounds, chocolate, anise, and some oak come out as it warms up, along with a slight bourbon nose, but not as prominent as I was expecting. Tastes are of room temperature hot chocolate, with faint licorice, molasses, and oak mixing in from time to time, with a good coffee backbone and a bitter hop finish. Full bodied, smooth, and creamy with a good dry finish. Hides its alcohol content very well. A very unique brew, even amongst the other Russian Imperial Stouts. Though it's oak aged, the aging doesn't cover up the other flavors. I'm sure this will age nicely and could be even better down the road."
"Bottle shared with Dave at the Brick Store Pub. Soapy head on dark chocolate colour. Yeast in a rich aroma, Bourbon is not as prominent as licorice, yeast, mollasses and chocolate. Taste is coffee,mostly. Roasting and charness and a bit of wood. Drying mouthfeel. Second bottle two months later, noticed soupy pea head of dark brown.And fuller body."
"Drinkability: This is a great beer, with plenty of complexity and an unusual take on the style; it will be interesting to re-visit in a year, when the hops settle down (which I did, by the way, but the hops still made their presence felt while allowing the coffee and chocolate flavors to shine in their complexity)"
"D - Too big and demanding for all night, but a TERRIFIC beer!"
"This is a beer to sip throughout the night. Another excellent Imperial Stout. The barrel aging was done very nicely for this beer. The barrel compliments instead of takes over like what happens with so many other barrel aged beers."
"This beer is good, but overhyped IMO. There are much better imperial stouts out there that eclipse Abyss in both complexity and drinkability. KtG, DL, and BCS are few that come out ahead IMO."
"This poured with a pitch black appearance though ruby at the edges, and a rough dark brown head that almost blended in with the body of the beer. If there was anything that could remind me Older Viscosity (one of the most amazing beers I've had recently), then this was it. Right from the first whiff you could tell this was one rich beer, chocolate, roasted barley, and coffee like flavors abound. The flavor was dark chocolate soaked in bourbon, though the bourbon doesn't give off too much of its own flavor, more just like a warmth to the overall taste. The mouthfeel was perfectly slick for this type of beer. Thick but not too viscous, it was able to go down pretty easily. A very rich but easy drinking high gravity beer."
"D: Definitely a good beer although it does leave a pronounced bitterness. I'll see how it does with some aging."
"D: For such a powerful, complex beer this is very easy to drink, nothing is too out of control but I just notch this down from a 5 since while I loved this, I certainly still need to be in the mood to drink this. I also definitely preferred the draft version over the bottle. Flavors just seemed more balanced and smooth and would probably let the bottles sit a little before drinking them again."
"Really enjoyed this one, it's young but already really good. I would put it up against the best stouts available and I think it would be right there with them. Excellent beer."
"I have had a recent string of unimpressive beers, that was ended by this beer. This is worth the hype. The beer is black with an iternal brown head that stuck around for a while. The smell is of coffee. The taste has a strong coffee flavor, but a mellow vanilla, carmel flavor is laced throughout. Stong hints of chocolate are also present. A must try beer for stout lovers."
"One of the most complex and complete stouts made. Very mature for its age, but will improve for many years to come. Simply delicious."
"If you are lucky enough to find this beer, get as much as you can, its a must try."
"For how big this is, it's surprisingly drinkable. This would keep you warm on the coldest winter day."
"Drinkability is high, this is my new favorite IRS, I'm a big fan of the sweeter chocolate malts compared to the uber-bitter coffee malts, great all around appearance/aroma/flavors, I think the balancing hops are impressive as well considering they don't detract from the dominant malt profile, I sure am glad I was able to secure a case of this, I am sure this will age well in the coming years!"
"D: same as 07"
"Yum, this is creamy and thick and definitely tasty, but the drinkability and taste scores suffer right now. This is a great beer, but right now it's only great. Give it 6 months to a year in good cellaring temperatures and it will become phenomenal. Just refer to BuckeyeNation's review below. That's what I remember tasting at GABF. Buy one and taste it. Buy several more and put them away."
"I have gazed into The Abyss. I've also smelled it, tasted it and felt its creamy lusciousness. This is a Russian Imperial stout for the ages and is one of the finest beers that I've ever had the pleasure to imbibe. Believe the hype and buy all you can get your hands on. Bravissimo!"
"All and all, I can tell you I won't be buying another $9.49 bottle of this beer. I think that the marketing team had some wonders for this beer. They have gotten into a lot of head but they haven't fooled my mouth. I don't think this is a bad beer by any means but I think there are far better examples of this style. I might go out and a whim and buy one more bottle for the cellar and I'll break it out in five years and she how she has matured. I must add, I did not sample last years batch, I have to assume that it was far better than the 2007. That's the only way I can justify it's following."
"The only thing I can really ""complain"" about is it needs a little more time in the bottle to meld completely."
"The body is big, no kidding at 11%. But the surprise here for me was the smoothness of the beer and how everything just blended so well. Even the alcohol is noticeable but is blended so well. Overall this is a top 10 beer everyone should try once in their life. Guess I will keep going to the store till they run out."
"Thanks younger35. This was an outstanding beer experience."
"D: This is really an awesome stout. I wouldn't say it blows other beers of this style away, but it's right up there with anything else I've had. My only regret was this was my last beer after a long day of sampling at Lost Abbey and Stone, and I just couldn't finish the whole thing. Obviously with the big ABV, just one is enough to last all night. I wish I could find this again, but I guess I'll just have to wait for next year."
"Overall, a great beer from a great brewery from the great state of Oregon:)"
"Some may call this overrated just because of all the hype it receives before it's released but I would say it's worthy and stands tall among the other RIS examples. I'll look forward to this seasonal every year."
"Overall, I tend not to like the black licorice flavors, and this one has it strong. As it warms (or as I get used to it), the sweetness starts to balance it out."
"D -- Very drinkable, but again, expectations come to play. If you make a very limited release, you set high standards. I would certainly say that the beer is overhyped. I don't think this is a bad thing, as it has certainly opened me up to other offerings from Deschutes. If you find this at your local beer store, you owe it to yourself to try it. Otherwise, I'd go with Obsidian Stout, which in my opinion is a better offering from the brewery."
"D: An outstanding beer from Deschutes, an excellent sipper. Not totally blown away at the first taste, the scent wasn't really there, though I think the beer was just too cold. But at room temperature or close to it, the beer really opens up and has a great flavour profile I think is worthy of the hype. Definitely one of the better RIS's in America, though I'd like to see what a few years does to this brew."
"D- I enjoy this style, and I really enjoy this beer. This is like drinking an after dinner liquor, sip and enjoy."
"Mouthfeel - Full and creamy. More amply carbonated than most Imperial Stouts."
"The Abyss is a good beer, a very good sipping beer, but I think it can get even better with age and that is one thing I am looking forward to. The flavors seem a little rough and grainy but Im sure these will settle within a couple months."
"I am so glad i ""made the cut"" on LS and will get a bunch more of these for my cellar... id like to say i will hang on to them for 3-5 years, but i am not sure that is possible!"
"So while I'll happily admit that The Abyss is a fine Imperial Stout that can be compared to the best in category, the mania is overblown. If you run across some, definitely try it. And if you don't, and have another leading Imperial Stout that is easily obtainable, that's okay, too."
"Pretty decent, but i don't think it lives up to the hype by any stretch."
"Edit: Subsequent samples of the 2009 revealed a distinct sourness that has no place in The Abyss; commendably acknowledged by Deschutes. Sipping on my first 2010 and my faith is restored! Not that I ever lost it. Deschutes is first class all the way. Anywho, the 2010 is divine and backs up fully why I rated this beer as high as I did, and I do. A magnificent brew that deserves to be in the top 10 of anyone's list of top Stouts and top brews in general."
"Vintage 2007"
"D: This beer finally revealed to me the promise of a finely crafted stout. I have the same joy drinking this brew that I have drinking a chocolate latte on a hot afternoon or a rich dark roasted espresso on a cold winter morning. It would be hard to drink more than two in a setting but I would dearly love to try...again and again."
"*Please disregard the Wine Spectator doucheyness"
"Drinkability- This is a big beer (11% ABV) but it drinks a bit smaller. The alcohol is well covered and this thing is loaded with flavor. The vanilla and oak in it are some of my favorite flavor characteristics that beers can have and none are better at it than The ABYSS. Highly recommended!"
"The mouthfeel is milky. Not a lot of carbonation. This is a dessert beer for special occasions. Truly decadent and complex. I'm not sure I've ever come across a beer that held a more fitting moniker than The Abyss. The only thing I can imagine improving this beer is age. As a youngster, I really think it's perfect. My favorite Imperial stout to date."
"Drinkablity: Very powerful brew. Well crafted and worthy of the respect it gets."
"D: A very nice beer, but it falls short of the hype for me. I'd get more if I saw it on the shelf, but I won't go out of my way to trade for it again."
"I bought 1 bottle of last years on my first weekend in town, before I heard the hype, by which time it was long gone. I still haven't touched that bottle and have been eagerly anticipating this year's release. Worth the wait, but I'm in store for quite a bit more waiting for the rest of this years stash, which needs more time to round out and soften. Although I wouldn't want it to get any oakier, which is clearly a risk."
"But in both instances The Abyss proved itself as among the best beers anywhere. It is a champion. A Gretzky, a Man 'o War. The stuff beer dreams are made of. Can't wait for next year."
"Pours jet impenetrable black with good tan head with incredible lace. The nose is a great mix of coffee, molasses, cream and dark malts. First taste brings coffee to the front, creamy bitter chocolate through the middle with more coffee. The finish has a great subtle hop bitterness. Roasted malt feel to the finish. Mouthfeel is sublime, not too thin, but if anything I would like it to be slightly thicker. Drinkability is remarkably high for an impy stout. The 11% is nowhere to be found. Awesome brew, and I am excited to do a vertical of the two vintages one of these years."
"Pours the darkest of dark with a big two finger fluffy mocha colored head. Loads of stickiness left on the sides of the glass after this one slowly descends. A thick and creamy head remains atop the Abyss throughout. This is how a beer should look. The smell on this one is damn powerful. Big chocolate and coffee up front with a sweet cherry, vanilla, and fig aroma as well. Lots of molasses and brown sugar with an unfortunate booze like smell that appears. The bourbon and oak are definitely there, but that's expected. Enough already, time to put this one down. Wow, first word that comes to mind after first sip is ""complex"" for sure. Wood smoked dark chocolate with a big french roast burst up front. The barrel aging of this beer truly shines. An almost Amaretto sweetness finds it's way out from underneath the big smokey flavor. Big oaky dry aftertaste with lingering dark fruites on the tongue. I really want this beer to be heavier, but it's still damn thick. Mild carbonation fits the style just right. I'll choose this over Dark Lord for sure, but it really is a toss up between The Abyss and Kate. Big thanks again goes out to lou91, unexpected treat for sure. I look forward to how a fresh ""2007"" version compares."
"The taste is simply divine, dark espresso and bitter chocolate flavors mix with a hint of the oak barrels. This being an imperial stout and having such a high ABV, I was surprised that I really didn't taste any sweetness and hardly noticed that I was quited sauced after just one glass. This beer is really a symphony of its complexities, and I myself will from this day forward refer to it as the best stout ever brewed and you should to!"
"Great mouthfeel. Great Beer. Good times."
"A king among beers. Huge and brutish, yet with a refined, style. So incredibly happy this is coming back in a few days, several more bottles will soon join m cellar."
"D - The 11% ABV is not very noticeable but very warming. Slightly different than most RIS's which makes it interesting."
"from zrrbrrt in either BA Anny or No BS Beta, in the cellar fridge since"
"I'D GIVE THE 2008, AND PARTICULARLY THE 2009, EDITIONS MUCH LOWER SCORES. IT JUST ISN'T THE SAME BEER ANYMORE. I'D GIVE THOSE VERSIONS AROUND A 3.75-4.0 I'LL AVERAGE AND GIVE IT A 4.25."
"Poured into a snifter, pitch black with a very dark brown head that settles very quickly. Smell is mainly brown sugary sweet, along with oak, and licorice notes. As it warms i notice increasing amounts of cocoa. Taste? WOW! Taste is surprisingly more chocolate/cocoa than i expected, along with toasted malt, and faint licorice flavors. I'm glad the licorice is as faint as it is because i generally dislike licorice flavors in my beer. Mouthfeel is very thick, almost syrupy. Smooth with a capitol ""ooth"". A truly memorable beer, though I couldn't see drinking more than a bomber in this sitting. It's so flavorful, and at 11% abv, it would probably sneak up on me rather quickly. This is a beer to be sipped and savored."
"A terrific beer, but it could use some heavier blending with more of the barrels. A bit subdued in that aspect."
"Overall: Daniel I am indebted to you for this one. It's not the best RIS in the world (though it doesnt fall short by much) but it is the most drinkable. The wonderful flavors meld together so perfectly that I just kept knocking it down in huge gulps. I actually had to tell my self to slow down and enjoy. Deschutes makes great beer, and this one is touted as their best. Well let me say I have to agree. If they never make another beer, they will be able to making a living on this beer alone. Magnificent"
"I revisted this one last night from the bottle, and wow what a dissapointment. I must have been high as a kite when I wrote my first review, as this stuff is just not good. On the pour this beer looks great. Dark black/cola brown with a coffee whip espresso head of foam. Aromas are good too, slight chocolate, coffee, roasetd malts. Nice. However the taste is fine up front, but this is too sweet in the middle and the chocolate/coffee/roast flavors just turn to acrid bitter cold brewed coffee in the sour finish. Also, the mouthfeel is thin for an imperial stout. The thin mouthfeel and bad sour coffee aftertaste of overburnt espresso beans really kills the drinkability for this one. Maybe a bad bottle? Maybe, but it was fresh from the most recent release in a wax dipped 22oz bomber, so it seems unlikely. Not good."
"Excellent, malted milk balls and milkshakes, tastes like bitter coffee, no alcohol, no bourbon but wow!"
"Overall, very comlex and completely enjoyable. Met my expectations then blew right by them."
"Serving this beer so warm (about 65°F / 18°C) has really muted the oak contribution, as the last time I had this it was much more noticeable. Even when cooler it is still on the subtle side though, which is really what I want in a beer made with oak; add a bit more to the complexity without over doing it is the only way to go. The proof that this is a very well made stout is that despite the over the top roast character, there is very little harsh acidity contributed by all of the roasted grains. Definitely not the thickest and richest Imperial Stout out there, but still this is quite satiating and I really like how the various flavor components of this brew balance each other out. This is simply quite delicious; lots of sweet malt & fruit notes to stand up to the over the top roast character, plus a subtle backdrop of oak to kick the complexity up another notch."
"Overall: Wow, this beer is everything I expected and more. If I see it around, I will buy it up. Thank you HimerMan for this gem."
"Even without the high rate of complexity, the simple richness of Abyss lives up to its name- offering up a one-dimensional dialogue of roast and sweet while only glimpses of complexity decorate the periphery. But its such a succulent and delicious taste that those complexities are simply not needed."
"Drinkability: Goes down easily, but lacks an extra insentive to get again and again."
"If you ever get a chance to enjoy this beer, do so immediately. I would love another bottle of this, but don't know if I will ever see one again!"
"Pours an inpenetrable opaque black with a dark chocolate milk head that dies slow. Smells very complex. Chocolate, cherries, hops, roast, smoke, all make appearances on different sniffs. Taste does the same as the smell. Shows a different delicious flavor each sip. Dark chocolate shows up the most..mmm. This one meets the hype. Full in the mouth and a sipper indeed but complete bliss in each sip!"
"Ultimately, the Abyss didn't grab me like it apparently does everyone else. It's merely Very Good. Still, gets my unqualified recommendation as one of the better Russian Imperial Stouts out there."
"Wonderful, wonderful beer. Deschutes knows how to brew (and oak age). Highly recommended. Shall revisit soon hopefully!"
"Thanks go to RoBotGod for this one."
"I split a bomber with a buddy and don't think I could have finished the whole thing myself. There are very few beers I can say that about."
"Toasted bitterness and roasted malt start off this delicious brew. Sweetness via dark, whiskeyish fruits and molasses comes next with intense dark and milk chocolate bitternessweetness and notes of licorice. There's an oaky depth to all of it that is subtle but unmissable. As the bourbon warmth picks up, the hop bitterness and malty roastedness intensify. Finish is warming with lingering hop numbness. Fantastic! Full, chewy body with perfect carbonation. Dangerously drinkable, but should be savored slowly from a big snifter. Well done Deschutes!"
"D- Mmmm. I want so much more. If you get the chance at all, TRY THIS. wow."
"Overall an amazing beer. The taste didn't quite match up to the aromas which were amazing."
"I pulled a 22oz bomber out of the cellar after a long, cold and rainy day fly fishing for King Salmon in Douglas AK. Man 'o' man did I need a warmup . . . Found it right here. Great, wonderfully thick inky darkness fueled with higher alcohols leading to an amazing chocolate character. VERY NICE! I expected a little more oak though . . . it seems that aging in barrels would have given it a little more oomf (vanilla). I think I'll sit on the other bottle I have a little while longer for more proper aging purposes. Thanks guys, it's nice to see a ""premium"" beer in a ""premium"" package."
"HUGE thanks to JohnGalt1 for the help in getting my hands on this."
"And then, of course, I flew from Oregon to Texas to drink it there for some crazy reason - so it'd been through a lot by the time I got to it. Not to worry, it was absolutely amazing. It poured out dark black with a nice head of brown bubbles. Very very aromatic with hints of chocolate, coffee and a distinct alcohol smell expected of an imperial. The taste was a bit like cherry or berry up front and then exploded into an amazing blend of chocolate/coffee/sour/oak tastes. Very complex. The mouthfeel was fantastic too - though it was a bit hard going down. It would be a hard beer to drink more than one bottle of, just because it's so heavy and rich. Rebecca says: ""wow."""
"UPDATE 2/1/2013: remarkably my spouse was cleaning out a garage pantry last week and came across a bottle of 2006. I drank 1/3 of it this afternoon. It was remarkable. Slightly subdued flavors but insanely increased smoothness. If you have any 2006 still in cellar, don't fear it's possible demise; it is criminally smooth and a still great experience."
"Taste is much the same. All Im getting is lots of roastiness. No bourbon barrel or barrel aging coming through at all. It was smooth and creamy, yet a tad thin on mouthfeel. Wasnt getting the plethora of complexity that was advertised. Ill sit on the last few and let them age for awhile and see if they balance out more."
"A supurb stout!! Wonderfully thick, chocolatey, and lasting with a great impression of a well made brew. Deschutes has themselves a big time winner with this one! Wow!"
"Thick and syrupy body runs across the palate like sludge. Sweet nestle chocolate flavors that also have a sharp bitterness to them. Caramel sweetness also impressive. Roasted malt notes with coffee, rum soaked dark fruit, molasses, and licorice. Many flavors dance on the taste buds and shout to be noticed. Bitterness is actually quite abundant in the finish accompanied by blackstrap molasses notes. Dry finish from that blackstrap. Smooth and easy drinking, though this ones a sipper with it's high abv, which is completely masked."
"The body is quite thick and sticky. Fairly sweet. The alcohol can be tasted, but it's not intense and burning, though rather smooth instead. Very easy to drink for a big beer. I can see why it is so highly rated."
"Drinkable in an extreme way, especially for such a big beer. I wish I had more of this. Its delicious."
"Wow. Better than Dark Lord."
"BTW, the growler is beautiful, its probably the nicest I've seen, be sure to pick one up if you're in the Bend area."
"Recieved as part of an eleborate 3-way trade with kdoc8 and msubulldog25. thanks! Pours big and black with a thin brown film of bubbles. looks pretty badass. I can smell it in my glass from 3 feet away. coffee and chocolate, brandy and bourbon, and scotch and some dark fruits. Taste up front is a sweet dark fruitiness. extreme bitter coffee grounds then move in, along with some sour coffee bean-iness. obvious oaky flavor with familiar hints of vanilla. Dry coffee woodiness and bitterness on the finish. Flavor lingers and lingers. Just fantastic. Mouthfeel huge and velvetlike. The only problem is that the coffee ground bitterness becaomes maybe one degree too harsh towards the end. But, anyway, a fantastic, humungous beer."
"Another bottle: I drank this one warm and still cant get why you people like it."
"Very nice. Id like to see more RISs that rely more on smoke instead of sweet. Its light body and clean finish make this an excellent sipper."
"I could drink this stuff all day and die happy in my sleep."
"I'm amazed at how drinkable this sucker was. It seemed nothing like 11% at all. I really enjoy a stout that isn't overly sweet or thick, and this one fits the bill. I would seek this out if you can..."
"Pours a Hersheys Chocolate Syrup dark brown color to used Quacker State black with a very slight brown head. If this thing is barrel aged, you sure cant tell unless you are looking for it. There is lots of chocolate, cocoa, hops. Quite a bit of hops actually. The barrel character comes through more in the flavor. Very chocolatey. Sort of reminds me of Whoppers in the flavor and gritty mouthfeel. Certainly a damn fine beer, but nothing outstanding."
"Very complex and smooth RIS. One of my favorites and very nearly flawless. Had a Dark Lord the night before this and The Abyss is every bit as good in my opinion. While DL is more in your face and aggressive, this beer is more reserved and smooth but just as complex. Well worth seeking this one out. Here's to hoping Deschutes makes this an annual release."
"Considering the combined flavor and mouthfeel, this has a breakfast-stout feel to it. And with such intense flavors and high ABV, it goes down incredibly clean and smooth. Thanks a ton to msubulldog25 for this fine specimen. You da man, Brian."
"As it warms, this becomes even more tasty, although the alcohol also shows itself more so drinkability doesn't improve...not that I'm complaining ;-)"
"Gorgeous, silky smooth black color. Nice cocoa colored head on top. Really a nice looking beer. Deep, deep aroma-roasted malt and licorice. Somewhat fruity and caramel like. Thick roasted flavor. Black currants and licorice. Oakey with some great vanilla notes. Faint coffeeness to it. Very mellow sweetness. Perfect mouthfeel-doesnt finish too dry. No trace of any alcohol @ 11%. Really a fine beer and very drinkable. Perfect in all regards. Wish I had a case."
"Pours oily black in color with an orangish tan head that slowly fades and leaves some light lacing. Nice roasty aroma, some light soft sugariness and some bourbony alcohol as well, but aroma is mainly a charred, burnt roastedness, coffee like. Very smooth and creamy as it hits the tongue. Again the sweet sugariness from the malts is quite soft and subtle but lingers slightly longer than in the aroma. Sweet sugariness has some light chocolate flavor and is followed by some acidity from the roastiness creeping in and growing stronger towards the finish. This acidic roastiness blends with some decent hop bitterness. An almost nutty roastiness in the finish as well as a decent amount of alcohol. Finishes dry with some alcohol burn at the back of the throat and an anise aftertaste. Very nice and roasty, extremely well balanced beer. Mouthfeel is great start to finish. Taste is solid and fairly complex."
"(Edit, 2/14/08) I just tried the 2007 vintage and I have to say that it's MUCH more in-line with my tastes. More molasses, caramel, milk chocolate, and vanilla. It's still a little pricey and rare, but worth looking for."
"Pours out black with a large, dark tan head. The head has amazing retention and leaves plenty of lacing. Smell has a hint of hops but this one seems more about the malt. I get plenty of roasty, chocolate-y, licorice and a bit of currants in the nose. Maybe even a little bit of oak and the slightest hint of vanilla. Taste seems to begin with some bittered chocolate and some licorice before dark fruit starts to come in, it ends up with a strong, roasty finish. I seem to get a bit of oak as well, some alcohol is noticeable too. Full bodied with carbonation on the lighter side; dry, roasty finish. This one is a sipper, but a damn good one. Definitely worth seeking out."
"Pours a very thick brown head that looks great! There is a very nice lacing left behind on this black as night beer. The smell is chocolately with some coffee, the smell reminds me of a chocolate wafer. The taste is smooth and full flavor of coffee hits you right away and the chocolate is left to the aftertaste. There's a lot of burnt wood in the flavor as well, kinda like when you put charcoal from the fire in your mouth (by accident). The mouthfeel is very silky and full bodied, very nice. Overall I would have this again after aging it a year or so."
"Served at a slightly warm cellar temperature, sampled in celebration of getting my taxes done early this year. This looks absolutely incredible, with an epic burnt-sugar brown head, all creamy and dense and going nowhere fast. Cool reverse-cascade effect during the pour. The liquid itself blocks out any light source put to it -- black-hole type darkness here. Smells meaty and vinous at first. Then a bit of roasty char emerges, along with black plums, coconut, vanilla, caramel, Bing cherries, extremely mild citrusy hop notes, and just a promise of black liquorice. An amazing aroma, but the taste is mind-bogglingly complex: Big roasted black malt flavors, with dark cherries, prunes, fresh plums, raisins, all awash in just a hint of bourbon. Some char flavor sneaks in during the middle, along with vanilla notes and whispers of German chocolate cake. Black roasted finish lasts forever, it seems, with sharp vinous blackberry flavors interspersed among the panoply of burnt deliciousness and puckery oaky tannins. Alcohol flavor is noticeable, but melds expertly with bourbon accents. Slick, luxuriously silky mouthfeel. Not too heavy, but substantial all the same. The folks at Deschutes knew exactly how long to age this one before letting it out of the gate. This is something I could easily drink all night, every night if I could. Really, I couldn't ask for anything more in a Russian Imperial Stout. As close to perfection as I can imagine. I was lucky enough to get my order in to Liquid Solutions in time before these all sold out, but I wish I would have ordered more than three. At least it will be available again some time in 2008. You'd better believe I'm stocking up on this one at that time. Excellent, excellent beer. Seek out at all costs."
"Thanks to johnmichaelsen for bringing this wonderful RIS for us to share. I had a small taste of The Abyss a few weeks ago at another BA gathering, but it was too small a sample to base a review on. Not this time. Poured from a wax sealed 22oz. bomber bottle the color of coal with a lovely two fingers of dark tan colored head. Smells of rich roasted malts and coffee, as well as dark chocolate, dried fruits, caramel, and molasses. Tastes of roasted coffee, cocoa, licorice, brown sugar, and a hint of vanilla. Intense and delicious. Very smooth and full bodied. Wonderful. Do yourself a huge favor and seek this fantastic brew out. Recommended."
"Cheers!"
"D: My expectations for this was really high and it delivered. Definitely on my top 5 stouts, if not number one. Seek this one out for sure."
"Poured into a chalice a black color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy tan head which lasted a couple of minutes, some oil slicks, and some nice lacing afterwards. The nose is sweet roasted malts, licorice, slight vanilla, deep chocolate/toffee and a nice touch of caramel. The taste is absolutely delicious of sweet roasted malts, chocolate/toffee, licorice. This puppy goes down very smooth, with a slight dry finish. Medium body. Very drinkable, definitely the best brew for me from Deschutes."
"D - such a good beer! a bit heavy to pair with a plate of fish n' chips, but both were excelent!"
"Seriously one of the best stouts I've ever had. Delicious!"
"Get it now....if you still can. This is the must try beer for the year, and the new standard by which all other Impy stouts will be measured against. Simply incredible."
"D: Absolutely delicious imperial stout, but not a lick of bourbon anywhere near it. Not that theres anything wrong with that, just a bit of false advertising. No negative points given because of that of course. Drinkability is superb, Ill kill this 22oz by myself with out having much problem."
"D- It is good. There is to much coffee malts in this for me. I prefer it with more chocolate and roasted malts. Is pretty tasty though."
"Drinkability: Well at 11% ABV, you must be cautious, but for this style it's very well crafted and drinkable, very complex, flavorful, and actually clean in the finish. Thumbs up."
"As the great Maple Syrup (David Cross on ""Mr. Show"") would say"" "it's wonderfulrissimal!"""
"Deschutes is an excellent brewery. And after tasting this one... easily one of the best when it comes to stouts."
"Flavor is somewhat low key with licorice, molasses, coffee, chocolate, fudge and piney hops making a massive play at subtlety, but not offering anything mega-fantastic as far as flavor concetration. It has a creamy chocolatepudding flavor/feel to it that is very enticing and lets you forget shortcomings. There is also a spicy note in the far finish that I assume is the oak. Other than that, and a mild dusty, earthy, woody feel also in the aftertaste, the oak is reserved. Overall Its a hard beer not to like, but it isnt too hard not to love."
"D:An incredible elixir. A very complex and deep brew that balances each flavor perfectly. The high ABV limits the amount per serving but the beer is delicious. I can't help but wonder what a year of aging would do for this brew. Highly recommended!"
"Many thanks to Duckboy for the bottle!!! :thumbup: :banned:"
"Great brew and a great nightcap. Who is partying with this all night long? I'll be there with wax on my teeth!"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is full bodied. The beers flavors are loaded with roasted, toasted and chared flavors. The flavor of the beer is long lasting. I found it very distressing how fast this beer disappeared from my glass. Must have more!"
"Drinks okay, but alcohol burn & heft also make this a nightcap or fire side sipper. This one would pair well with some hunks of red meat & or chocolate. This a keeper for deschutes, more next year please!"
"Great brew, so glad i got three of them lol."
"This beer is devastatingly complex with rich tones and more subtlety than a dark British comedy. Almost too much for my admittedly novice palate, however my aversion to licorice is profound and would not allow me to continue to drink this brew. Regardless, this is one of the better brews I have tasted in terms of brewing prowess and depth, so if you like or can handle the licorice flavor I suggest it highly."
"I could drink this all night, or at least til it put me out."
"Mouth is dry, thick and chewy. Nice burn in the chest."
"D: I think I have a new favorite beer from Deschutes, this beer is awesome."
"Lucious....period."
"D: The ultimate sipper and a wonderfully crafted beer. Rich deep character & fine balance - definitely in the top echelon I've beers I've enjoyed. I recently had a pint on-tap at Concordia Ale House and found the tastes to be similar, though the chocolate/coffee character seemed more prevalent in the kegged version, while the tannic oak barrel/vanilla qualities were more forward in the bottled version. Either way, this beer comes very highly recommended - thanks to Deschutes for brewing this fine stout!"
"I'll be buying several bottles of this next time I go beer shopping, I do believe. Bravo to Deschutes."
"Buy it now, it's an instant classic."
"My quest now continues for another bottle."
"Mouth is rightfully creamy and full. I could drink a ton of this and would do so before ANY other barrel aged stout. No other barrel aged stout comes close. I'm sure a year from now once people catch on I'll get many requests for it. That seems to be the case with most Northwest brews!"
"The alcohol is very much in the background of flavors. The beer warms the belly less than I would expect for 11%. This is another fine offering from one of my favorite breweries. I find myself sipping in moderation to stretch the duration of the flavor experience."
" Pours as dark as a black steer's tuckus on a moonless prairie night. Inky black body is topped by a good finger of deep, dark brown head. A very pretty beer. Aroma is heavy on the roasted malt, with complex notes of coffee, licorice, dark chocolate, and a good whiff of alcohol. Palate is ridiculously rich. A ton of roasted dark and chocolate malt is tempered by a flash of an almost milk chocolate sweetness up front. The full bitter roasty character emerges mid-palate, along with the presence of some fairly sharp bittering hops. Finish is more roasted malt with a bit of licorice. The mouthfeel is simply perfect - rich, creamy, and luxurious, like a less-sweet version of a Dove chocolate bar. For such a strong beer, the alcohol is hidden extremely well. Damn, I'm a fan of this beer. I guess I need to grab a few more bottles before it disappears for good."
"This beer is so rich, I don't think i can finish another one, but I'm going to try. I should probably try another Bell's Expedition Stout before saying this, but what the hell -- this is the best imperial stout I've ever had."
"11%abv?Not perceivable in this imperial stout. Tasty, complex nose, nice mouthfeel, and great drinkability. A winner from Deschutes."
"I can't help but wonder how this will taste in 6+ months. This is one for aging and enjoying in sips."
"Been checking my local store for last couple weeks and finally hit the right day for this beauty. As I popped the cap the first thing that hit me was roasted coffee, hadnt even started to pour and was just blasted by this great smell. Pour was jet black with a nice 1 inch satiny beige head. Damn it was dark, no light was passing through. Taste was coffee, toasted barley, hints of bourbon and vanilla, with a nice hop bitterness finish. Mouthfeel was thick as a milkshake, just coated my mouth and would linger till the next sip be it 5 seconds or 5 minutes later. Drinkability, this is one of the best stouts I have ever had. Its so rich and tasty that its a must try for any stout lover that can get their hands on some."
"i think this is a really good beer with the probability that it'll get even better with some age. i'm going in for a few more and i'll set them down for awhile."
