"I really liked this beer."
"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 12/7/2012. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, toast, molasses, dark bread, light coffee, raisin, plum, fig, light licorice, and roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, cocoa nib, and dark fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of big milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, toast, molasses, dark bread, light coffee, raisin, plum, fig, light licorice, and roast/toasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, toast, molasses, dark bread, light coffee, raisin, plum, fig, light licorice, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, cocoa nib, and dark fruit flavors; with a solid roasted bitterness/sweetness balance. Flavor leans much more towards sweet malt notes, but never gets cloying. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome imperial stout. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, cocoa nib, and dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
"I found this while out searching for BCBS on black Friday. Couldn't believe my luck!"

"Pours a deep, rich, hearty black with mocha colored head.  Sticky legs but very little lacing.  Wisps and thin collar remain when the head faded after 30 seconds or so.  Aroma is a nice blend of roasty and earthy malts, and bitter sweet chocolate.  Taste is much like the aroma: dark malts and chocolate; rich and quite delicious.  This beer coats your mouth and is a little silty.  A little bit of alcohol burn though."

"Could taste the cacao nibs from the onset.  This is a beautiful beer; well-constructed.  Wish they still brewed it."
"Bottled 3/25/2011.  Didn't intend to age it this long, but it got lost in the cellar."

"Shared one bottled from 3/2011 last night (8-23-2014) with my brother-in-law. We both remember this being a good beer when new, but bitter. After almost 3-1/2 years in my basement, this beer was knock-your-socks-off incredible. It smelled liked a great dessert and tasted so smooth and sweet. It made me wish I would have bought way more of these to cellar."

"O - A chocolate boozy sipper that seemed to age quite well despite the lack of head and lacing. Unfortunately, the appearance and smell killed my overall score."

"Original bottling of this beer, dated 3/25/11. Appearance is pitch black, with a small tan-colored head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is sweet with a bit of mild chocolate. A little booze. Taste is nice -- sweet & chocolatey up front. A bit boozy on the sides. Dark fruit flavors prominent. There's a bit of an unfortunate tootsie-roll flavor, which I've found to be common with chocolate beers. The finish is surprisingly bitter, perhaps from a mixture of chocolate, roasted malt, and booze. But it isn't overpowering. Mouthfeel is rather full. Carbonation still present after 3+ years in the bottle. Overall a yummy stout and the addition of chocolate complements the roasted malt nicely, making it a bit more complex. I've been told the original release of Big John was particularly amazing, though I came away slightly underwhelmed."
""
""
""
""
"O-Overall a great surprise a very impressive imperial stout!"
""
""
"(However, drinking this now with a year and a half on both bottles, this stands up better with the chocolate standing up better than the hops in Night Stalker.)"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is good but a little more one-dimensional than I was hoping. Just dark malts, chocolate, and a tiny bit of booze but they could work better together. Glad I got to try this as my buddy raided my fridge and took my only bottle a couple years ago. Nothing I would seek out again unless it was cheap but not bad. Just better stouts out there at this price point. Just got it in a trade so maybe it wasn't stored well."

"If you read the bottle you know precisely what to expect here- an imperial stout with cocoa. I agree with a few of the other reviews that noted the dark fruit is much stronger aged than fresh. My mind isn't blown or anything but this is a nice brew both fresh and aged."

"O- Another terrific offering from GI. Comparable to a WWS, but more all around better executed."
""
""
""
"Great Imperial Stout, Goose Island really knows how to do it"
"Super jet black and viscous poor. Looks like used motor oil sludge mixed with roofing tar. Smell is cocoa dominant with coffee and some jammy fruits as the beer begins to warm. Taste follows the nose fairly well and lots of cocoa, some sweet fruits and bitter espresso towards the end. Overall a very good imperial stout from the makers of BCBS."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours black and viscous with no head; some clumpy lacing on the glass. Smells of raw tangy, sweet cocao bean fresh from the pod, vanilla, dark jammy fruit like cherry and fig, molasses, roasty malts and even a little coffee. Quite nice. The flavor is jammy fruit which is a bit tangy and bright, just a touch of cocao, vanilla, brown sugar, sweet, roasty malt and a balanced bitterness on the finish. The booze is a bit imposing from start to finish but doesn't take away too much from the flavor. The mouthfeel is chewy and syrupy with a tingly effervescent carbonation. There is more carbonation than bourbon county stout. Overall this is rather delicious. I think the jammy fruit flavors are a bit excessive and the booze is a little much. But otherwise very well done as a sweet dessert stout."

"Poured from a bottle dated 12/01/12 - just over a year old. Nice pour into a snifter, jet black. Gathered a nice 1/2 inch brown head which dissipated quickly into a small bit of foam around the edge - which subsequently left nice delicate sexy lacing with each sip. Taste is rich strong black. The cacao nibs definitely come through in a 75% dark chocolate taste - not overpowering and not too dark - which is good. 14.5% ABV is taste-able and appropriate for this this big of a beer. Overall, a frigging great beer that gets better as it approaches room temperature, but also tastes great right out of the 'frig."

"Overall - Good stuff! It's as it says an Imperial Stout with Cacao Nibs. With the exception of glumatic flavors (which are probably shaved off by the cacao addition), it tastes like what it says. It's a combination of dark roast coffee, cacao, and malty sweetness. Powerfully sweet upfront with bitterness from the roasty/char of the dark roast coffee flavors, dark chocolate dryness, and a pretty swift alcohol kick at the end. Aftertaste is predominantly the coffee. If you like Ten Fidy or Chocolate Yeti, I think its one of the sweeter examples, but definitely right in that neighborhood."

"Taste-A complex, but well-balanced mix of premium chocolate, rum raisin, cedar and plum. Warming mouthfeel and a dry, almost port-like finish. Smooth and nicely aged."

"Overall this is a great stout and worth a try. Averages around $10 for a 22oz. 11.50% ABV so you're getting your money's worth!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good Imp Stout. The Cacao nibs are a nice touch and very much up-front in the taste. A good cold-weather beer to be sipped slowly, especially with dessert."
""
""
""
""
""
"I was surprised by how much alcohol heat was still there. I wish I had a few more in the cellar as this one was very enjoyable."
""
"Appearance is a wonderful tarry black that reminds me of a bourbon county. The smell is slightly boozy with a note of cocoa nib and coffee. The taste I feel doesn't live up to the smell. It lingers a bit too long and is pretty bitter. Fans of high bitter beers will enjoy this. The mouthfeel is slightly odd when compared to bourbon county or other stouts by goose island. Overall this beer is pretty tasty. I aged this one for the full year recommended and I am not sure if the aging did the beer any good."
""
""
"O - A shade too sweet, and the soy sauce is a bit of a distraction, but otherwise a nice AIS."
"The only knock I could give is that maybe it's slightly hot, a little alcohol burn. But at 11.5% that doesn't shock me. The other qualities are more than enough to subdue that. This is a pretty great beer. As someone who likes heat (Mexican Cake, Bomb!), I'd love to see a variant of this beer with some pepper character, but until then, this version is more than adequate."
"O: This is an enormous beer, and there is no subtlety to it whatsoever. Drink this on an empty stomach and you will not need to eat a meal. You will also probably be drunk. Works very well as an after dinner/dessert sipper. It really favors the sweet tooth."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some great lacing. Aroma of dark chocolate malt with light roasted malt and light residual sugar notes. Taste is a sublime mix between black milk chocolate with some light molasses and liquorice notes with light dry roasted malt notes also perceptible. Body is full with nice thick creamy texture and good carbonation and no alcohol presence is easily identifiable. I really enjoyed this huge beer and I’m glad they were able to maintain such balance and drinkability to match the complexity of this beer."
""
""
""
"I never had this beer fresh, but I can say that this is a gluttonous, dessert imperial stout with a year of age on it. And the bourbon hits at just the right level, letting you know it is in there, but not bruising the other flavors. I would gladly have this supreme, syrupy stout again."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - A very nice well rounded American Double / Imperial Stout... Very sweet, but never cloying... Smooth and well rounded... Not world class, but it isn't too far off... I don't have a single complaint... Very well done by Goose Island..."
"O: The numbers I'm giving this beer aren't a joke. This is the real deal and a beer that I really enjoyed. Such an incredibly delicious and impressive stout. I was a tad nervous drinking it so close to the ""drink by"" date that was a little less than a month away, but it blew my mind. Such a pleasurable drinking experience! So glad I picked it up."
""
"O - excellent American Imperial Stout with nice chocolate flavors.  If the price was right I would get this again."
""

""
""
""

"Overall - Imagine Bourbon County without the barrel treatment. Very enjoyable. A must-try for any fan of big, boozy stouts."

"O: This beer was fantastic, perfect amount of coffee and cocoa notes and perfectly balanced, was pretty happy with this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall seems a bit muddled for an imperial stout, too sticky for my like and not as complex as many other in the style. However it is still a serious beer that commands respect."

"Bomber from trade. Thanks! Dated 3/25/11, enjoyed on 8/30/13. Pours a deep black with small brown head. Aroma of chocolate and licorice, maybe some sweet vanilla notes and hints of roast. Flavor is big sweet dark fruits, black currants, light anise, molasses, and with an extra kick of milk chocolate. Finishes with a nice bitter and lingering bittersweet chocolate. Feel a bit of heat on this too. Mouthfeel is perfect, thick and velvety but with a bit a carbonation to balance. Nice beer!"

"O: Has the characteristics every Imperial Stout strives for: dark, oily body, big, long, and bitter flavors, and a mouthfeel so heavy your tongue sags under its weight. A good benchmark for the Imperial Stout. Can't praise it enough."
""
""
"O: It reminds me a lot of Night Stalker and it would be great to try them side to side. GI has a great base stout in Cook County Stout and they really do some amazing things with it."

"O - A great imperial stout that borders on RIS, but stops just short. I love how the cocoa nibs mellow the astringency here. I wish I had another bottle or two to age for a couple of years to see how these flavors meld. If I can find another bottle, I'll but it."
""

"O: A decent and fairly original brew, just not what I was expecting from an imperial stout brewed with cacoa nibs. Pretty hoppy and earthy, almost distractingly so. That combined with the alcohol makes me think this one could use some age."
""
"Overall: A+"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- overall this is just ridiculous. I will come back to big John, probably one of the most intense and complex stouts I've had."

"B"
""
"O - Excellent. Mouth is outstanding. Love the chocolate bourbon. Booze has no heat. Balance among all flavors is very well done. While this might be the lowest in the Bourbon County series -that is no means a knock- it is very very good."
""
""
"22oz bottle. Pitch black with a mocha head. Not much retention or lacing. Aroma smells of sweetness and roast with a heavy alcohol component. Taste is similar, with a heavy sticky sweetness (with an emphasis on those chocolate flavors) that is tempered a bit by the burnt feel of the roast and whatever hop bitterness is left over. Alcohol flavors amp that sweetness up even more. Mouthfeel is full and chewy with a bit of a prickle to it. While the the alcohol is heavy flavorwise, the heat is at least mostly kept in check. This was good for a big Stout, with thick chewy flavors and a warming alcohol presence. This is a big beer indeed."
""
""
""
"Overall an exceptional imp stout, bordering on world class. I'd buy another if it was readily available."
""
"O: The beer is much easier to drink than I thought it would be considering the fairly high ABV - the alcohol is well hidden but this beer is just too filling to have more than one in a single session. Huge flavors and moderate aromas make this one quite enjoyable with just enough complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Well this bottle does say ""develops in the bottle for up to 5 years"" but I think I should have tried it fresh. Don't hate this one but don't love it either."
""
""
"A great stout from Goose Island that's not part of the Bourbon County series. Very nice."

"O-one of my fave Goose stouts when I am not looking for a giant malt/bourbon bomb. Very easy to drink."
""
""
"Served in a red wine glass. Pours dark brown and pretty much opaque with a quarter-inch, light tan head that dissipates into a skim. Nose expresses some malt and a slightly oxidized quality. Taste consistent with nose; however, there is also some cocoa nibs evident in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a mild, even carbonation. Texture is a bit watery and there's also a little acidity. Overall, I wasn't too impressed with this beer. The abv was certainly well-hidden; however, a bit lackluster."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, probably the best chocolate stout I've had. The quality of the chocolate used in this beer is evident and provides the beer with a complex blend of roasted malts and chocolate that isn't one dimensional like other chocolate stouts. I'm glad I was able to find this beer."
""

"O: I was really looking forward to this beer. But wow, what a disappointment. I could not even tough through a full glass. I'm not sure if there was an infection, but this was unlike any other imperial stout I have had before...not in a good way. I would give it another shot, but that wasn't pleasant."
" O...I must say I'm a sucker for imperial stouts and this would probably rank second on my list only behind founders imperial stout for non barrel aged stouts"
""
"O - Overall, pissed I forgot about this one as I had bought 2. Wish I'd cracked one fresh....Oh well, time to try and get rid of my other bottle...."
"Bottom Line: Decent stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured 22oz bottle (Dec 2012) into a snifter a jet black with with a nice 2 inch mocha colored head. Aroma is great - roasted malt chocolate Mouth feel is thick and creamy without much carb Taste is chocolate and coffee with a little oak and molasses Finish is strong and boozy warms me up a bit. Overall I’m a big fan. Would def. pick up another bomber next year"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: This was a really good beer, though there were a few flaws that hold it back from being truly great. It's worth buying if you can find it reasonably priced, but I wouldn't spend top dollar on it."

"O great Imp stout"
""
""
"Pours very dark brown, almost black with a thin 1/4"" mocha head that does not linger. No lacing on the glass. Smell immediately reminds me of a strong dark belgian - dark fruits, prune, raisin, fig. Not much roast at all but a little bit of dark, bitter chocolate on the nose. Taste follows the nose very closely. Very flavorful with the same dark fruits but really not too much chocolate. Perhaps a little bit of that dark bitter chocolate, but it kind of gets lost in the mix. A bit of ashen taste way back on the finish. Hop bitterness on the finish and just a bit of alcohol, but its very well hidden for 11.5% Feels moderately heavy on the tongue with very low to medium carbonation. I enjoyed this beer, but it was really not what I was expecting as an ""Imperial Stout with Cacao Nibs."" Not in a hurry to get it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very tasty chocolate infused stout. A little subdued is my only real complaint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Awesome imperial stout. A nice sipping beer @ 11.5 % alcohol by volume."
""
""
""
"O- Impressive beer. Not huge on the chocolate, but a great beer as a change of pace from big barrel-aged beers. I can see the relation to Bourbon County without the big barrel flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"Roasted barley and coffee bitterness up front. Quickly gets overpowered by rich, malty sweetness; milk chocolate, dark fruits, figs, brown sugar, and caramel. Almost candy bar sweet (3 Musketeers?). Sweetness diminishes toward the finish, where some woody, herbal bitterness helps break the cloyingness. Lingering chocolate syrup and molasses in the finish. Full-bodied with a syrupy feel. Definitely for those lovers of sweeter imperial stouts. Splitting a bottle is my preferred route for this dessert beer."
""
""
"A fantastic beer. Not quite the level of complexity of BCBS, but approaching it. A little more user friendly I guess, although only slightly."
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer is a one to pickup."
""
"Overall Big John is very very good. It has many of the same elements as the GI bourbon series, such as the smooth feel. Good stout. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is quite a beer! Lots of chocolate and booze in this one, but not too hot. I really like this a lot!"
""
"Very nice Imperial Stout. Nice touch of chocolate, but isn’t overdone. A good bit of alcohol in this one, some age wouldn’t hurt to tone that down. Alcohol does die down quite a bit as it warms, but so does the chocolate at the same time. Good, but not one of the greats."
""
"Reminds me a lot of Bourbon County Stout, but not quite as complex. It's a bit like it's little brother. That is not saying it's not a nice beer, it is very much in the same family, and being a member of this family is a good thing. I'd say my biggest complaint is it is a little boozy, a little mellowing would work wonders for it."
"O. Very solid Imperial Stout. Didnt get a lot of chocolate to distinguish the cocoa nibs, but it was there. Very easy drinking for a beer this size. I could see this as a year round 4 pack from Goose Island."
"Such a great brew and so worth the $9.99 bomber I routinely see..."
""
"Great chocolate presence in this beer. Pretty heavy, touch to finish the entire bottle by myself."
""
""
"Notes: Bottled 03/25/11. I wasn't sure about how this stout would be with just cocoa nibs and especially after 2 years. I really ended up enjoying it though. It got really close to chocolate beer milkshake status. I wasn't entirely sure when I smelled the dark fruit, but it worked alright and wasn't overpowering. There was the slightest burn (not sure how it is fresh), but its finish was a heavenly smooth, creamy, chocolaty goodness. Worth a shot, maybe not BCBS but enjoyable regardless."
""
""
"Verdict: Decent at best, but nothing I could safely recommend. The harsh alcohol and metallic flavors are really unappealing and made this tough to finish a full glass. A miss from Goose Island, I'll just stick to BCBS."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. This one was ok, but aside from the mouthfeel nothing about it really distinguishes it from the gobs of imperial stouts out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So I went to a tasting in Kentucky where they had big John on draft and after staying until the end, tried to get another of the one limit per person fills. I had gotten to know the guy and he offered to fill a growler.. I had to take him up and promptly grabbed one off the shelf. It's amazing. Really, I wish I could elaborate but I'm at a loss for words."
""
""
""
""
""
"Don't expect Bourbon County-greatness, this is a pretty basic imperial chocolate stout, but it's solid. A bit of a tough drinker with the sweetness/alcohol."
""
""
""
"O- Torn on this one. Appearance and Mouthfeel wise this one is a huge winner. Smell and taste wise not so much. I have no idea if Goose Island used the same hop on this one as they used on the Nightstalker, and I don't really care. I do know that this beer is worth drinking unlike the Nightstalker."
""
"Pours black as night -- this is the backest brew I've ever seen. Absolutely zero light gets through, even when put up against a bright bulb. A solid 1-1/2-finger mocha head sits on top. Dark fruity chocolate malt aroma pours out from the head as you inhale. Definite chocolate notes peek through. First sip, tons of chocolate with some roastiness backing it up. Delicious. No sign of the 11.5% ABV whatsoever. Creamy mouthfeel that's off the charts. Overall, one of the best Impy Stouts I've ever had. Deserves all the praise it gets, and then some. A bit pricey, but worthy nonetheless. To me, this is an extremely similar recipe to their Bourbon County Stout, except without the bourbon aging and vanilla flavors. Still a ridiculously solid brew."
""
""
""
"Good aged stout with a mix of big roast cocoa and aged caramel fruits."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a nice Imperial Stout, which, even though it does swing heavily toward the sugary side of the scale, still brings just enough ash and tobacco to largely counter the sweetness. What is surprising, however, is the relative lack of chocolate notes; in fact, for a beer with cacao nibs, there’s almost no chocolate in here at all; instead, it seems to simply blend with the molasses, fig, and bourbon notes, disappearing largely into the background. Did the label not say “with cacao nibs added,” I would have assumed I was drinking a standard Imperial Stout. The alcoholic kick is also a bit heavy, filling the nasal cavities with whiskey vapors. Still, it’s worth a try for fans of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a brawny stout that forces you to slow down and savor."
""
""
"O: This is pretty good. The fusel note from the booze is a bit off-putting, but it gets subtler as it warms."
"Pours a viscous motor oil dark brown capped with a one and a half finger beige head. Average retention, little to no lacing. Big chocolate malt, some limited roastiness. Dark chocolate, a bunch of molasses and even a hint of maple syrup joined by semi-sweet maltiness and prunes. Big, full body, low carbonation, fairly syrupy and somewhat sticky. A solid stout that trends much more sweet as opposed to roasty."

"Goose Island sure knows how to do imperial stouts. A fantastic beer, and a great variation on that same base as Night Stalker and BCBS. Rich, complex, and delightfully sweet. Delicious."

"Overall: this is a slower sipping beer, but the big bold flavors keeps this interesting the whole way. Nice chocolate flavors make this a great dessert beer."

"O - I am a big fan of booze, chocolate, our Chicago skyscrapers and Goose Island. I expected great things from Big John, but this brew does not live up to its elements and inspiration. The sum of this beer does not equal the whole of its parts. There should be another note or two at the end to give the drinker pause."

"Had an 8 oz pour in a snifter at Ball and Biscuit. As served it had no real head to speak of, but was a pretty dark near-black color. It has big taste and aroma, but is a little different from your average Imperial Stout. It is pretty smooth, very chocolatey but without real bold coffee/roasted malt bitterness. It is kind of boozy, but I found it smooth without the bourbon notes. Doesn't have much of the licorice/tar/soy sauce that some big stouts exhibit. Body is actually a little light, but it makes for a very drinkable imperial stout. I'd like to find a bottle to compare and enjoy more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Can't find much wrong with this. I drank a few other highly acclaimed stouts this evening, yet they don't beat this. Shame Inbev runs the show now, but Goose's specialty beers haven't suffered yet."
""
""
"O- definitely a solid beer, as GI's stouts usually are. Not sure if I'd grab one again to drink fresh, though...it's definitely a sipper"
""
"Overall it was pretty good, but needs a little refinement or aging. I enjoyed it, but next bottle I get will be aged for a year to help mellow it out. A good beer to split and share, especially if you like chocolate and coffee. Price wasn’t bad, just under $10 for a bomber and worth a try."
""
"O: Decent. Was hoping for better, but the price was reasonable and this isn't bad. A little too boozy at 11.5% ABV. . . ."
"I poured from a bottle into a snifter. The pour is jet black, thin tan head, light lacing. The aroma is full of chocolate, dark roasted malts. The flavors mimick the aroma, also hints of licorice, finishes with a lingering chocolate malt. The beer is full bodied, hints of alcohol, definite sipper. Glad I was able to try it, good big stout."
""
""
""
"22oz bottle with a Bottled date of 12/07/12. Pours a dark black color with over an inch of frothy brown head. Aroma is boozey and chocolatey. Not sweet but more of a bitter dark chocolate. Earthy with hints of smoke. The taste is of hot cocoa mix and chocolate syrup. Nice alcohol presence. Earth and bitter dark chocolate at the finish. Very chocolatey. Heavy, syrupy mouthfeel that goes well with the flavors. Pretty drinkable considering the high Abv and the amount of chocolate flavor but I did down a bottle of water with this one. I think I may like this one better than Night Stalker. Overall, solid beer worth grabbing again."
""
""
""
"O - Amazing, amazing, amazing beer. Seriously wowed by the chocolate profile it had. So god damned tasty!"
""
""
"GI really did a job on this stout. It is incredibly thick and creamy and very full bodied with an amazing mouthfeel. The coca notes are amazing, like rich fudgey cake. Great roasted finish that is sticky as well."
""
""
""
"O: A very nice Imperial stout with just enough chocolatey goodness coming through. Not sweet by any means, but pushing the it in that aspect. Average on the price, at $9.99 a bomber, but it is 11.5% and a solid imperial stout"
"Big Boozy John, drunk from a Victory snifter: a black as night pour with a thin light brown head that doesn't stay around long. Big malt nose with the requisite Imperial Stout aromas of roasted chocolatey/burnt coffee. Plummy dark fruits on the tongue with roasted malts, some not-over-the-top hoppiness and an alcohol burn at the end. Not a bit of the cocoa nibs talked about on the label but good all the same. Finishes long and strong, more dark fruit ending on a bitter note. Bottled on 12/07/12 and would benefit from some careful cellaring but I can't fault it for being sampled in its younger state. One to keep an eye on."

"Like I said, big and really, really bold. Probably one to share. Definitely want to have with a glass of water. But pretty well balanced for what it is. Probably gets better around the 6mo mark-- bottle says it ages for a year (implying not longer). You'd need good cellar conditions anyway to keep this from turning into Kikkoman."
"Though surprisingly boozy, Big John makes for an excellent dessert beer. I could see the alcohol calming down a bit after a few months in the cellar. Sweet, but not overly so, this is a fantastic beer with which to end the day on a cold winter night."
""
""
""
""
""
"tastes rather nice, like a De- bourboned bcbs, lots of good flavors rich dark chocolate giant syrupy mouthful nice underlying bitterness. bit of cola licorice and earthy dirt. well blended and rills over the tongue quite nicely. without the bourbon barrell aging the beer has a bit more detectable alcohol even though it is lower in abv. overall a nice imperial stout that showcases the rich great malt body that bans has."
""
"A lot of Imperial Stouts (Russian or American) are very roasted or hoppy tasted when they are fresh and mask the dark fruits, liquorice, malts and chocolate that I love to taste in an Imperial Stout. With Big John, the flavors I love were present with a fairly fresh bottle (only a few months old). I didn't pick up much cocoa in the taste or smell like the marketing tells me that I should. But as I just said, all of the other flavors that I love were there and this beer was damn smooth as it went down pretty easy. It essentially tasted like a Bourbon County Stout without the bourbon. This was for sure one of the better imperial stouts I have ever had and I hope I can pick up another bottle to cellar."
""
""
"Overall: This brew creates its own class of Imperial Stout. What is usually a massive roasted punch this shows off the more delicate side the style is capable of. Almost a little too sweet but that is forgivable."
"Overall. A nice big stout with all the classic flavours as well as that extra chocolate. Great for desert."
""
"The mouthfeel is thick and slick, complementing the flavor profile perfectly. Palpable stickiness lingers on the lips from the very first sip. This is everything an artisanal imperial stout should be--big, complex, powerful, decadent, assertive, smooth--I could go on. It may not be for everyone in light of the prominent alcoholic presence, but for an imperial stout afficionado, this brew is a pleasure."
""
"Tons of chocolate and candy sugar. Big, thick and syrupy sweet. Great sipper."
"O/D-I have heard mixed reviews about Big John. I found it to be a pretty awesome brew. Complex and nearly sensual on the palate. I am happy I grabbed this one. Big, sweet and complex. Cacao nibs is also a great pairing of words…its just fun to say."

"Tremendous imperial stout with almost all of the qualities I look for. A bit muddled in the nose, but exceptional mouthfeel and delectable dark flavors make up for that and more. A highly recommended beer that I will begin seeking out again immediately."

"I wish I had a bunch of these for the cellar. Sadly, this is the only one I've seen in my five local bottle shops. Label dated ""12/7/12"" . . . Pearl Harbor Day."

"O - Obviously some drawbacks but a great beer over all. I drink them pretty frequently."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very good brew, on an empty stomach it can do some damage to you. It is a slightly sweeter version of Nightstalker (which is one of my current favorite imperial stouts by Goose island).With Imperial Stouts I prefer less sweet and a touch more bitter, but doesn't mean you are drinking something bad. All you need is a glass and you will thank me, Salud!"

"O- I really enjoyed this beer. A nice chocolate forward stout that cant disappoint."
""
""
""
"O: I was very pleasantly surprised by this brew -- very well-balanced with a strong and powerful chocolate presence but a very solid background stout with just the right amount hoppiness. I am going to try to find a few more bottles of this around. One of the best chocolate imperial stouts I have had. Great beer."
"D-An amazing beer. A sipper but a great sipper at that. I love this beer, one the best I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D= The first sip made me think this would be a chore to finish because of the huge heaviness of this beer. However, it is very well balanced and the alcohol stays hidden making it all too easy to put down."
""
"Verdict: The one is better fresh. Mouth-feel is the biggest difference with the Fresh one blowing it away. The Aged one is just too flat and honestly doesn't leave much on the palate. The Aged one is still very good, but Fresh is definitely much better."
""
""
"O: This is an okay strong stout. I wasn't too impressed. The flavor profile is deep and complex, but the alcohol is way too overpowering. Tastes like a BCBS with no bourbon. BCBS worked, though, because the bourbon and sweetness masked the alcohol. Not bad, though, although this would more than likely be better with some age on it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Great smell, look and taste but just a little to boozy in my opinion. The boozyness overpowers the other tastes and smells."
""
"O: I remembered the bottles I had last year to be significantly better than this, but this was far from average. I would have liked more roasted malt notes and the booze to be a more integrated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'd wanted to try this for a long time and happy I finally got the opportunity to do so. I was hoping for more from this one, however. I imagine this one is much better fresh."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark black with a creamy mocha head that settles to a solid cap. Big aromas of dark malt, molasses, dark chocolate. Just a big, roasty Stout with some cocoa(not that any of that is bad). Taste is similarly roasty, with lots of cocoa, molasses, and dark malt. Mouthfeel is quite lovely, super-smooth, with a full mouthfeel and lowish carbonation. Good beer, really nice."
"Truly a well composed powerful dessert."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid dark brown-black pour with a thin tan head that left no significant lacing. Aroma was big and chocolaty, dark malts, molasses, and hints of dark fruits. Rich and smooth taste with loads of chocoate goodness, dark malts, some roastiness, but mostly mellowed out, notes of coffee and molasses, some rummy booze heat, but nothing unexpected or unbearable. Bordering on a full body, smooth mouthfeel, rich and tasty, soft carbonation. Not quite a BCBS, but overall a great stout."

"If the heat and strength was a little less pronounced, this would be darned near perfect."
""
""
""

""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Decently flavorful, but still too boozy and thin for the style. I wish these guys could tone down the alcohol and thicken up the feel a little, because the flavor in their imperial stouts is usually pretty solid. Anyways, worth checking out if it falls in your lap, but unless you love harsh booze bombs, this isn't one to seek out. Thanks again for the beers Masterski. Always a pleasure."

""
""
"O- I never had this beer when it was fresh, but it is tasting good right now but still definitely has plenty of heat too it. The cocoa nibs definitely added a nice sweet creamy chocolate taste that hid most of the alcohol well, but it still wasn't enough to hide all the heat. Overall I enjoyed this beer however I think the abv should have been dulled down a bit. Otherwise it was very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I had very low expectations for this beer given its bad reputation/ratings but some cellaring has done this good. The booziness was mellow and the chocolate seemed appropriate and not over-bearing for a beer that advertises itself as a beer aged on cocoa nibs. Not sure how this tasted fresh but it is definitely going in the right direction now."
"Poured in a De Molen tasting glass this beers starts slowly. Dark fluid with a minimal head. Not one of the best Goose Island beers but this i a nice beer to drink when you are not really into darker beers."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - ""This shit has some juice," says the friend with whom I split the bottle. Goose Island has the ability to make an 11% ABV stout taste like it's 22%. Good job?"
""
""
""
"pour is opaque dark brown with a tight tan head. The nose is interesting, it has hit of bourbon as in bcbs, a bit sweeter, fair amount of olive, light vanilla in back, hints of magic marker. The taste is sweeter than I thought, not as much bourbon in the nose, there is hints of tootsy roll, vanilla and chocolaty, roasty malts underneath. On the sweeter end, very soft feel, light carb, inviting palate."
""
""
"(originally reviewed: 05-16-2011)"
"D: A good chocolate stout but one that left a bit more to be desired here. Full of chocolate flavs but the intensity is cut by the booziness leaving you with more of a liqueur type experience. Worth trying if you can still track one down just sort of one dimensional for me."
""
""
"love this one, will try to seek it out again and look forward to having this many more times"
""
""
""
"Got to have it twice... my second tasting, from a bottle dated 3/25/11 - aged nicely since my last tasting - there was still some alcohol, and the chocolate flavors had taken on an almost wine-like character"
""
""
""
"O: Get one NOW! Nothing I can see that would detract from this, soooo glad I have LOTS more!!! Maybe it's the age, 'cause the first one I had when it came out, did not do this for me."
"Given the explosion of craft beer lately, there are many better options than Big John. A solid brew nonetheless."
""
""
"O: Interesting beer. Up front it tastes like rum, then turns to chocolate. Most of the chocolate flavor is in the finish and the aftertaste. Doesn't smell like chocolate at all either. Not bad, but not what I was expecting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The highlight of this beer for me, though, has to be the mouthfeel. This still is thick and chewy - this is the way I like all of my imperial stouts and most don’t quite achieve this kind of density. Overall, this is a beer that I am going to miss."
""
""
"Definitely reserve this for an occasion where sipping is appropriate, or try it with vanilla ice cream or a cigar. Regardless of how you consume it, give it time to mellow out."
""
""
"O: Not bad at all, but it was kind of disappointing. I was expecting to like this a lot more since I'm a big fan of Nightstalker and of course Bourbon County."
"O- with a year on it, this beer has really come of age. This is a monster stout that is just about in its prime right now. As the beer warms up it kicks into another gear and picks up tons of complexity"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: This was an interesting double stout, with sugary scent and bold taste and tons of body. The finish was somewhat harsh, so it must be sipped. Age may help mellow. Fresh, this beer seemed like the result of big aspirations that didn't quite come together."
"O - Overall this one was pretty solid but it lacked the wow factor that I have come to expect from most of the Goose Island stouts. I wouldn't turn it down in the future but I won't be chasing it either."
"D - This is pretty solid - not as good as Bourbon County Stout. Still, it's a fairly enjoyable beer that compared well to its barrel-aged brethren. Certainly wouldn't turn it down, but I'd prefer BCS nearly every time."
""
"O: I really like this big beer."
""
""
"A black/brown body with more translucent copper edges. A tan head with minimal retention and no real lacing. The aroma is of caramel, sugar, vanilla, coffee, and alcohol. Some nice scents in there, but they just seem out of whack and don't compliment each other as much as I would hope. Flavor brings out some dried cherry, syrupy sugars (marshmallow?), apple, caramel, and cocoa nibs. Strange and unassuming, but not too shabby. Mouthfeel is overly sticky and sweet, with a syrupy texture and dry finish. Overall, I was a bit disappointed in this one; perhaps a case of high-hopes induced by the attention this one received, but I'm not positive that's the case. Really just seemed like and ambitious swing and a miss for GI given some of the atypical flavors."
""
""
""
"Bought a few of these to age, this is the first one I cracked. Bottled 25th of March 2011. Its black. It has a 1/2 inch head that does a great disappearing act. It smells like booze, chocolate and some jammy figs. It tastes like syrupy chocolate-y stout. Also some tasty booze. Big on cocoa, duh, one dimensional. Slick mouthfeel. Overall a simple one dimensional beer that I am managing to enjoy and find tasty in its own strange way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Yet another top notch stout that I think far surpasses their Night Stalker offering. No hops in this badboy."
"D - The beer has a nice, complex aroma with loads of chocolate. The flavor profile is a quite a bit sweeter and more one-dimensional than I expected it to be. It is still a good beer, but it seems like it would benefit, both in flavor and drinkability from a slightly less sweet finish."
"single finger dark tan head on a jet black body with no light passing through. Lots of vanilla with dark fruit and chocolate. A very nice dark fruit, vanilla and chocolate mix in the flavor as well. Right amount of sweetness. Slight roasted malt note. thick in body, very smooth and viscous/creamy. light to moderate carbonation. Another excellent beer from goose island. This one is very smooth and flavorful. Strong but not too boozy."
""
"The perfect beer for the first snowy day of the season."
""
"A very good take on the style"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a good, big chocolate stout. One of the most chocolatey beers that I've had. It's got a big body and lots of flavor. Tasty."
""
""
""
"On the fuller end of medium bodied with a decent balance of dry, roasted malt, earthy hops, sweet chocolate and boozy heat. Slightly bitter with some piny hops and deeply roasted dark malts. Hints of dark chocolate, coffee bean, oatmeal and burnt toast but it never becomes to acrid because the sweet cocoa comes in and balances things out. The cocoa flavor is prominent and without it this beer could have been an overly roasted booze bomb. As it is, this is a well balanced, flavorful beer that is dangerously drinkable. Slight heat in the finish but the ABV is excellently masked. If I didn't know that it was 11.5% I would be in trouble."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an enjoyable beer. The flavors are very balanced and enjoyable. This is a bit of a boozey beer but does not become obstructive. The only real disappointment was the body not being as thick as I had hoped."
""
""
""
"Overall Impression- Glad I could grab the last bottle of this @ The Stable (and probably St. Louis since I've NEVER seen this in stores/bars). Good amount of sweetness but definitely boarder line overpowering. The roasts and everything else hit perfectly on the palate. Very nicely done overall but not worth the $25... I could think of many others I would go for before a Big John. Can I add a ""Thats what she said"" joke here?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I appreciate this sweeter style stout. Enjoyed very much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very good stout."
""
"O - This is really, really rough for me. Flavors are intense...very intense. The booziness and dominating molasses sweetness puts this as a slow, slow sipper for me - an all night companion for the whole bottle. Honestly not sure I can do it...wish I somebody to share this with at the moment. Not bad, but definitely not a favorite of mine."
""
""
""
"D - another solid stout from GI; fits into their repertoire nicely. A lot of complexity, big and boozy, this is made for stout lovers."
""
""
"O- This has gotten significantly better since it was released. I don't think it's quite ""there"" yet, but it's pretty tasty right now. The only word of caution I would issue: you better like sweet/chocolate stouts."
""
"Thick mouthfeel and low carbonation."
""
""
""
"For my money, I'd rather have a different Imperial Stout. If I had to pick something with cocoa nibs, I could probably find a few other offerings that suit me more as well. Overall I'd say this is a decent Imperial Stout if you like a strong presence of chocolate and you don't mind a slow sipper that spans your entire night. Myself? I like chocolate/cocoa nibs in brews, I really do. But what I don't like is an overpowering amount of sweetness and chocolate and a beer that literally takes me forever to finish and that's only the first half of the bomber...Yikes. Overall, it's not terrible and I think maybe some longer aging would do it very well and help the chocolate to mesh more, but honestly, I don't feel like sitting on one of these longer to find out. Giving a 3.0 rating overall because, like I said, it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. Others may like it more than I did."
""
"O- Not my favorite stout of theirs by any means. Not too bad I'd just rather have others."

" This stout has some big cocoa and herbal hop flavors with slight spice nuance. The taste of hops and dark malt with mild burnt note and mildly bitter cocoa nib gives some complexity with a mild coffee-like roastiness with gentle peppery heat of alcohol with some mild sweetness from the caramel malt. Overall this is a very high quality stout, I really like the bitter cocoa essence of the nibs, yet the heat of the high alcohol holds its drinkability back a tinge. I found it to be stellar with just an intense amount of roastiness."
"Pours super black and oily with almost zero head. Smells of dark roast and chocolate. The taste is great - I think if I never had BCBS or if it wasn't from Goose Island (with such great expectations) this thing would generally get top reviews. The first drink just coats the mouth with intense bitter chocolate, vanilla and roast flavors, just like the nose. The chocolate fades as the mouth gets used to it after a few swigs. At this point the boozy sweet roast takes the lead. Here is where it most tastes like BCBS and if it weren't for the finish leaving me hanging looking for a bourbon kick to end the flavor, I'd swear I was drinking that. However, I'm left wanting that kick since it's what rounds out BCBS so much and takes it to the next level. If I hadn't ever had BCBS I'd be raving over this beer - as it is - it's great, not mind-blowing, but I want the bourbon."
"O: This wasn't a particularly expensive beer, so overall, I enjoyed my session with this one. Lighten up people.... this isn't BCBS and doesn't claim to be..."
"O - This has really good drinkability. It goes down smooth and the flavor is really nice. It is a sipper of course, but it is still hard to put down. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer, and I think it is a really good imperial stout. If you like a lot of chocolate flavor in your stouts, try it. If you aren't the biggest fan of chocolate in your stouts, just give it a shot anyways."
"This is a full bodied brew with a light amount of carbonation. Very bold and aggressive with the alcohol heat but it makes for a solid sipper on a cold night. I found the licorice incorporation to be more bold than the listed cocao nib inclusion. The chocolate really only makes itself known lightly in the background of the aftertaste. Regardless, this was an interesting experience and worth a try if you have the chance. My vote goes to bourbon county as being my favorite offering they put out."
"Overall: I had high expectations for this beer as I am a fan of this brewery but it is a real palate wrecker and, ultimately, I had to surrender"
"Aroma is that of licorice, coffee and an underlying chocolate. Appearance is beautiful. Dark black body with a mocha/brown head. Taste is of a dark, rich chocolate coffee candy. Not too sweet though, containing a full body with little to no bitterness. Overall, an amazing stout."
"O: Liked it. Would drink it again. It’s no BCBS or one of its variations, but it’s great."
"O: Surprisingly less painful to drink than I expected it to be."
"Have to review my most under rated Imperial Stout. This Stout is so under the radar. It may not be perfect, but it is tasty. Pour is huge into snifter. Let it settle, solid retention. The smell is coffee, oak, chocolate. The taste is solid. A little burn, but once it settles, perfect Imp stout. The color is pitch black, just the way I like it. Solid offering from GI!!"
"Overall: A very good imperial stout that has some interesting subtle flavors."
"Overall: This one should have been much better. I was a bit let down--especially compared to other great GI stouts. Couldn't ever get over the metallic odor at the begining. The cough-syrup-like flavor at the end was also a bit of a let-down. I'd be curious to see what a bottle of this would taste like after a bit of time in the cellar..."
"A bomber on hand for the 2011 Brass Hat Brew Fest in Watertown, CT yielded an ominously dark brown colored brew, semi-opaque with a modest ring of tan bubbles on top and minimal signs of lacing. The aroma brings sweet bourbon malt with almost flowery-perfume-like chocolate hints. The mouth finds a cloying malt sweetness with dark chocolate syrup that suggests some fermenting cherries and figs. There is also a bit of an herbal hop brightness over the top and finish. It's a definite heavy bodied brew in my book, with a medium-light velvety smoothness. Not a great candidate for sessioning but tasty and a worthwhile venture for the sweet tooth that enjoys a touch of booziness with his chocolate."
"This was a pleasant Imperial Stout, though it was a bit one dimensional."
"Overall I really enjoyed this. Thanks to matttYCE for this extra."
"Full bodied and smooth with proper carbonation. There is a sweet sticky feeling in the moth after each sip, and the aftertaste is sweet with a bit of bitterness from the roasted malt. Definitely a chewy Imperial Stout. A good beer overall. I'm just glad it wasn't any sweeter, or it would have been too much for me."
"Pours a rich, deep and dark brown with thin cap of dense brown bubbles, gone quickly but leaving a ring of active bubbles. Scent is huge... notes of chocolate, roast and booze dominate with notes of dark fruit and anise like spice. Taste starts out big and bold with heavy roast, chocolate, booze and touches of sweet cream and dark fruit, but the finish becomes somewhat lifeless with dry and powdery cacao nibs taking over. Full bodied, coating with a touch too high carbonation, overall lightly dry on the palate. Overall this beer was a good, strong Imperial Stout but it seemed like it wanted to be big for the sake of being being, without too much effort put into complexity, layers or subtle touches found in some other big stouts."
"This is good. This is real good."
"o - Overall I thought this was a pretty good stout. It didn't blow me away but was much better than Night Stalker."
"Overall: Above average Imperial Stout, as expected from Goose Island. Great depth, expert balance. I don't know what I think of them as a company now that they're owned by Anheuser Busch, nor do I know if they'll be able to keep their quality up in the coming years... but at present, these guys are some of the best at crafting big, complex, malty beers. Big John is a solid offering in the Goose Island tradition."
"O= Overall decent beer I really like this style I think the sugary alcohol taste just ruined it for me. I will try it again again in a year or two."
"Thankfully, the flavor profile turns out to be pretty decent. Most thankworthy is the absence of the catsup (where the hell did that smell come from?). A fair amount of artificial grape remains, but a host of chocolate flavors join forces to suppress it. Semisweet, milk, Yoohoo, we seem to have all the chocolate bases covered. Very light notes of espresso and burnt malt; a bigger dose of the dark stuff would go a long way toward improving this brew. The thick, smooth mouthfeel would be more impressive if it wasn't helping the near-overwhelming sweetness and booziness to linger way past the worn-out-their-welcome point. Not something I'd care to revisit."
"I have had two bottles, and both with the same off flavors. I do not enjoy this. Without a doubt the weekest stout Goose Island has made. Not something I would recommend."
"O-Solid RIS.It did get a little cloying towards the last ounce or so but I was also drinking this 22 oz. beast by myself,so I factored that in."
"Overall is an excellent beer. I would buy this again and again if it were readily available to me."
"This is one awesome imperial stout. Loads of chocolate and sweetness and hops make this more of a dessert beer/sipper, but I am really having trouble setting it down. No trace of alcohol though. Another top notch imperial stout version by Goose Island."
"O: Goose Island has another winning stout with Big John. The alcohol presence and thick, rich nature of the beer makes this a sipper. It also would make this a great beer to warm yourself on cold winter day."
"O - good beer just rather simple and age could do it wonders."
"This beer pours almost pitch black with with a nice thick brown head that lasts. The smell is roasty with hints of chocolate. The flavor follows suit with a good bit of sweetness but not to much. The mouthfeel is vey full and good carbonation. Overall another beer from goose island whose release I will look forward to every year"
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy tan head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich, warm roasted scent along with a solid chocolate aroma. It's bold with excellent complexity; truly a BIG beer. The taste is good as well. It has a top notch roasted and chocolate malt flavor that goes down slow and finishes with a good deal of warmth. It's a sipper with loads of malt character. The cocoa nibs really enhance the experience. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very good double stout. It's bold, but nothing over the top. It's a slow drinker with lots of character."
"im a fan. i have a bunch more that i'll probably let sit for a while to possible lessen the heat a bit...i imagine this one being perfect before long"
"All in all it is good imperial stout, but I lose interest in this style day by day because it was a good novelty at first but too many brewers are making too many imperial stouts and too many beer nerds are going overly bonkers and they are all jsut melding into each other."
"Overall, a very well done big beer that's fun to drink. This bottle is only six months old, so drank it as a baby. Might have to get another bottles to aged it up to five years as suggested on the side of the bottle. Getting to the review page, it seems that I'm a bit more enamored with this beer than many other BAs. Not sure what the critiques are from them, but will take a look. But, I think this is one of my favorites of Goose Island."
"The texture is incredible and the flavor is very good as well, but not as good as the mouthfeel. Very good all around and I look forward to trying/making more."
"Enjoy!"
"Good stuff, if a little heavy and sweet. Like the stepchild between Night Stalker and BCS."
"Pours jet black with a dark brown head. In the aroma, a mellow roast and some cocoa. In the taste, bitter chocolate and a nice roasted presence, strating sweet and ending dry with a small alcohol note in the end as well. A small bitter bite and medium to bigger bodied mouthfee, with a semi dry chocolate and hint of alcohol in the aftertaste. Nicely hidden alcohol and nice chocolaty roast."
"Overall: Bourbon County Brand Stout is amazing but the base beer just does not reach that same level. I guess the barrel adds so much of the great character that I love about it. This is a very good beer but it is more like a chocolate milkshake. I have another one I will age and see how it does."
"O- I am a bit disappointed in this offering from Goose. The beer is a bit too sweet for my taste. Not a bad beer but something I probably wont revisit."
"O: Nicely done ""big"" chocolate stout. By nature, this is not going to be particularly drinkable, but it's a good sipper and pairs well with cookie dough ice cream."
"Future outlook: Good stuff, really enjoyed. Might grab another one next year and hold onto it for even longer."
"A good taste, wished it had more body to it, but glad I was able to taste this."
"Really thick and viscous, excellent mouthfeel. I'll probably drink a few more bottles of this in the coming weeks."
"Pours a dark brown. Fairly clear. A nice light tan head. Smells sweet and raisiny. A nice loth roastiness with some burnt sugar. Tastes sweet with very subtle cocoa. A bit of alcohol burn. Well carbonated and overall pretty tasty but not really my cup of tea. Too sweet and cloying. Not bad but not something i would drink again."
"O-solid beer. Like the aftertaste"
"Big John is a little too sweet, but the chocolate flavor is pretty good."
"I had high expectations going in, and was just a little bit disappointed."
"O: Well, this doesn't have near the chocolate I would expect. Too much molasses/dark brown sugar. Doesn't fit the bill for the description. That being said, it's not a bad beer, just not something I will be seeking in the future."
"Overall: I struggled to drink the half bottle I had. The balance was a drain pour. No doubt my least favorite GI beer. Just too much alcohol for me. Not enjoyable. The alcohol outweighs the cocoa by far."
"Damn this is a tasty stout. I love the loads of chocolate here. I'd love to have another to see how it ages."
"O - Ok for the style. Alcohol is a bit harsh. Could use a few years to mellow it out."
"poured a deep black as any beer in this style should. about a quarter inch head a deep carmel coloring with little lacing. it smelled chocolately with a significant roasted aroma. on my initial taste i wasnt crazy about the carbonation as it was quite aggressive but it grew on me. the taste had a decent amount of chocolate hues but was overwhelmed by an extreme roasted to borderline burnt attributes. although it was a decent beer i had expected more. glad to try once but wouldnt buy another. B."
"O - The thickness of this brew is fantastic! I wish more stouts had the balls Big John does, in terms of the mouthfeel. The rest of the beer falls into the ""good but certainly not impressive"" category. This beer has been done before, better. It's worth hanging onto a bottle for aging and, more specifically, for the upcoming cold winter. It'll be a nice and warming stout."
"I enjoyed it but it's not for everyone."
"O: I really enjoyed this one. I did not notice the alcohol at all in comparison to other beers of its size. I hope I get more opportunities to enjoy this beer and ones like it."
"O: Don't get me wrong this is a delicious stout, but not the best I have tried from GI. Again, some age might do this one well. I'll sample again down the line."
" I didn't find the aroma to be as bold or magnificent as the taste, yet it was still good. It's, for sure, a sipper. This is another beer that is best enjoyed when time can be taken to let it develop, warm to room temperature and ponder all that it has to offer. It had very nice character and extremity. The ABV is high, which doesn't make the drinkability very easy, so it could sneak up on you in a hurry if you're not careful!!!"
"Pours a deep black with a tiny brown head. Quickly dissipates. Coco and coffee aroma, but overpowered by boozy notes. Big sweet milk chocolate notes to start off the flavor. Very creamy in both taste in mouthfeel. Molasses, coffee, sweet cream and roasted malts take a back seat, but make their presence felt. Hints of warming alcohol. This one comes together nicely as it warms and the, big, sticky, thick, creamy mouthfeel is a big highlight."
"Taste is dominated with cocoa and is pretty sweet. There is not much bitterness. I can feel the cocoa granules. Overall this is like dark chocolate malted milk. The beer is a little too sweet for me. It comes across as rather rich. Alcohol really warms you in this one. Definitely well done but I should have shared this bottle."
"O: This was a good beer, but it didn't leave the same kind of impression on me like some of the other Goose Island stouts."
"The brew pours a deep, oily black hue, and is capped with a healthy share of khaki froth. The nose offers more general roast character than any specific nuance of chocolate or cocoa. The aroma is not off-putting, but it is quite one-dimensional, even if that dimension is pleasant. The flavor, on the other hand, is bordering on acrid in its roastiness; even less nuance is to be found here. The beer is silky and rich-feeling on the palate, which covers up for a lot of the overly burnt flavor. Overall this is an underwhelming brew."
"Pours a brown tinted black with a thin tan ring of sprightly bubbles. Wet nose reveals booze and a bit of malt. Big roasted taste hides the booze a little, but not compleatly. Sweet black coffee and cocoa with toffee and vanilla notes. Slick mouth feel is off set by prickly carbonation. Good stuff, would definitely get again."
"O-- Idea is good but execution is lacking. Booze is more than obvious and needs more chocolate. Too much ethanol in mouth and finish to really enjoy this."
"On to the taste, full rich chocolate on the palate, big time vanilla, and that fresh coffee on the finish with some really nice hints of almond nuts. Not just a generic nutty flavor, but real almonds. I love the finish. Rich and complex. This stout impressed the hell out of me, and I'm really a stout lover. People complain about the booze in this beer, but to be honest, the booze added to this beer. It gave it multiple layers, added depth, and it wasn't hot at all. If you want a complex, flavorful stout seek this out. For aging, I only see this becoming nothing short of stellar. 1-2 years will be perfect. Stout lovers rejoice."
"O- nice stout has nice chocolate and smoke. Other than that pretty one dimentional stout."
"This beer is the exact opposite of a try hard. Its a delicious full bodied excellent tasting stout without trying to do to much. This beer has taken some serious hits on this site and I think that people are just hype crazy on here and rate based on that. I will openly except anyones bottles of BIG JOHN today! I wish I had more bottles!"
"At this stage, Big John seems a little young. It's not terribly hot, but the flavors seem disjointed - it could have used some more time in the bottle. As it stands, this is a pretty middle of the road imperial stout."
"O- A good imperial stout. Like the sweetness with the thick mouthfeel and abv content. Cocoa nibs are a nice addition to this beer."
"Extremely thick oil sludge chug pour. 2 finger creamy chocolate milk head with a jet black body. First thing I smell is sweet, sweet chocolate followed by chocolate covered raisins and plum. Has a pinch of roastiness to it. Could be a bit stronger all around. Has a LOT of burnt, roasty characters in the flavor. Very bitter coffee on the end. Sweetness is downplayed a lot except for the first taste. On the second drink I really do get a lot of creamy dark chocolate that ventures closer to milk chocolate territory. Twist in some dark fruit and there you have it. Mouthfeel is creamy and chewy as anything I ever had. It is very smooth and rich. But yikes this beer is HOT on the throat! Almost feels like a shot of whiskey was dropped in it. Pretty good brew that most likely needs some time to lay down and chill a bit. I say hold off for now."
"Overall I wasn't impressed. I have a bottle aging, maybe it will improve in a few years... I really hope so at least."
"O: Again, it seem one-diminutional, but it's a different experience from the other big GI stouts. Would like to have seen a bit more complexity, but the chocolate characteristic is certainly there, and is very delicious."
"O - Not a bad beer, but nothing overly complex, and not fantastic by any means. Had this on tap as well, felt about the same as I do now."
"O: I knew this wasn't going to be a complex example of the style going into it. Pretty one dimentional, but I think they do that one dimention pretty well. I liked it, and would have again. Not world class by any means, but worth the try. Skal."
"O: going to recap the bomber for tomorrow night. a slooow sipper at best."
"Big John pours a standard solid stout black. There's but a faint wisp of tan foam capping the beer, and as a result, neither any head retention nor lacing are to be found. The nose is a straight up dark chocolate bomb. For the life of me I can't find a suggestion of any aroma that doesn't scream chocolate. The nose is good, but it's a one trick pony, and that keeps it from being truly great. There's a mild bit of roast that shows up in the flavor, and that keeps things interesting, but overall the beer is just about as chocolate heavy on my palate as it is in the nose. That roast does liven things up a little bit, which is only to the beer's credit, but god damn if it still isn't easily the most chocolaty beer I've ever had. The body is full and quite rich, though restrained enough that that and the quiet, yet present carbonation keep the beer from turning into chocolate syrup in my glass. I'm surprised that I will have scored Nightstalker higher than Big John, as I definitely prefer the cocoa nib treatment of the BCS base beer, but I guess I have to chalk that up to refining my palate and becoming more particular in my scoring over time. Bottom line is that Big John is a great beer, and one that I hope becomes a regular part of Goose Island's lineup."
"It's like a meal of a beer, really. Quite a thick beer, and tasty as well."
"O: Is this year old Nightstalker? No, year old Nightstalker is a lot better. Hopefully this will evolve a bit."
"O - An excellent imperial stout. I loved this one."
"D- overall this is a decent beer, def not my favorite from GI considering the standards set by Night Stalker and BCS, a little sweet for my taste, the dark fruits leave a weird taste in your mouth that doesnt quite fit, not bad but i probably wont run back for this one"
"D: A pretty big miss by GI. Little evidence of the cacao nibs and well outside of the typical flavor profile for a big stout. Perhaps some time on the shelf will benefit this one, but now - it's a chore."
"Notes: Nice twist with the base of their rich stouts BCS style, without the barrel aging. Logically the bourbon notes are absent and instead a chewy chocolate sense grows and permeates the palate nicely as it progresses. Pity about the way that this released come in such a limited, and hype ridden vibe. I like it but still would stick to the standard BCS. Wondering about how that merger with the big macro will affect their production. On a personal level, and for a variety of reasons, I'm not too big a fan of the building that the brew makes reference to. But that is another story…"
"O: Pretty good, but not the chocolate monster I was expecting. Have another bottle in the cellar and will revisit it sooner than later."
"Pours like liquid tar, black like used motor oil. One finger head of dense foam of light brown color. Moderate cling from the lace. The color of this brew is the black hole, I held it up to a strong light and still no light passed through it. It is a 40 on the SRM beer color chart. Complex smell, with aroma of chocolate, vanilla, caramel, wimpy coffee, banana, and oatmeal. The taste is much like the smell reveals, with flavors of semi sweet chocolate, molasses, vanilla, caramel, watered down French roast coffee, banana, and something close to whole wheat bread. Good mouthfeel, it is full, and creamy, but lacks just a little in zing, with a bit of drying in the back of my throat, will I guess that would be expected with the amount of alcohol. This beer has a good taste and a wonderful warming effect from the massive amount of alcohol in this bomber. I would have another, but I can't find my butt with both hands. Maybe not perfect, but a must try."
"overall: good, but definitely the worst of the GI imperial stout line"
"Overall a good stout offering loving the chocolate upfront."
"Overall: Nice and smooth Imperial Stout, but a little disappointing considering what Goose Island is capable of."
"Pours an opaque black with a small 1/2 inch head that fades to an oily cap. Small legs of lace drip back down into the remaining beer. Smells of chocolate syrup, vanilla, dark malt, and interestingly enough I get a distinct banana aroma. Taste is of sweet chocolate syrup, vanilla notes, and roasted malts. The sweetness is extremely cloying. Very low carbonation with a very thick and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but it's extremely sweet and sticky."
"Big John is an okay release from Goose Island. It’s not bad. But, given the loft status of Night Stalker and Bourbon County Stout (and its variations), I knew Big John probably would not live up to its siblings. It most definitely does not. I’m not a fan of the tangy dark fruit presence. There’s also the overly strong alcohol, very sweet flavor, and deficient body. That all probably makes it sound worse than it really is. I’m probably being hard on it because Goose Island has done a wonderful job with its other stouts. For what it's worth, it's pretty good. Not great, but not bad either."
"This is the first stout I've had by GI, I anticipate I'll love BCBS when that time of year comes.  Overall I thought this was a pretty standard stout, but I bet it'll balance out nicely with some age on it."
"had this on tap at Small Bar... Light black body, nice tan ring stays forever... Rich deep chocolate with a little bitter cocoa nibs, sweet but boring... Taste is hot and almost spicy chocolate, more flavor than the nose.. Pass, glad I didn’t run out to the stores searching for this"
"Full bodied, mild carbonation, sticky and heavy on the tongue. This has some nice flavors going on, and I'm a fan of chocolate forward imp stouts, but I found the finish a bit harsh for my liking. I'm guess some time to mellow out would help this big guy."
"O - Worth having, a tastier than average stout, and one I'm happy to have tried. The slight hop finish lingers a little too long and isn't ideal for my tastes, but probably something many beer lovers enjoy."
"Overall, a decent stout. Not great, but interesting and tasty. I'd like to lay a bottle down for a few years and see how this one develops."
"O (D) - I think this would be perfect if it were not quite so sweet and if it had a bit of time to cover the booze a bit. I'll try to grab another one of these and let it sit for a year or so. Definitely worth a try."
"Big thanks goes out to mikesgroove for sharing this one during Hobo Tasting #9! Served from bottle into a Duck-Rabbit snifter. Poured pitch black with a half finger light brown head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, and vanilla. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, subtle alcohol, and vanilla. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Ovearll this was a great brew. Very nice chocolate flavor and aroma going on here. The flavor was very well balanced and nothing really stood out, but rather worked in unison to enhance the other. Really glad I got the opportunity to tick this one!"
"O- Great brew, nothing outstanding here to seek out. The strong chocolate presence with the balanced hop profile is done excellently, unique on that front."
"O - This is pretty nice Imperial Stout with a great cocoa flavor."
"D: heavy and a bit on the alcoholic side"
"(Sampled at Dak’s Memorial Day tasting. Courtesy of Dak!). Pours dark brown with minimal tan head. Aroma has lots of chocolate and some coffee. Tast is sweet with some cocoa, roasty bitterness and alcohol. Thinner bodiedwith an oily texture. Not bad, but less than I expected from Goose Island. We’ll see how this ages"
"O: Overall impression, is that this beer may have many different stages and characters to its prolonged life form. At first I thought that maybe the nibs were over powering the beer, but now there is a perfect balance to them and in the future, I venture to say that they will be hard to distinguish. As a yearly offering, this is a good candidate for vertical tastings. THUMBS UP!"
"4.0 D: This is a nice addition to the GI lineup. I always wondered why they never put out a regular imperial stout (this is a hell of a lot closer than Nightstalker) and I hope this sticks around. I think I enjoyed this more than my scores suggest."
"I am rating this beer very high, and I know I am in the minority. Even when splitting the 3 bombers I've had, I was asked to finish 2 of the other peoples servings...which I gladly did. They both expressed that it was too rich and hinted that it was overly sweet/malty/chocolatey. I'm guessing that too ""rich"" was probably the most accurate description. It definitely is that. But i love this beer so much that I bought out the store and have the bottles saved in the cellar. It has the feel and appearance of BCBS, but a very different flavor. If you can find it, give it a shot."
"Thanks Matt!"
"Thanks to Jason for hooking me up with this bottle. Poured rich dark brown, almost black color with a finger of light brown foam. Aromas of roast, molasses and cocoa powder. On the palate, this on was full bodied, with flavors of cocoa, smoke, charcoal and dark fruit/peaches."
"Over sweet was the biggest deterrent of drinkability. Still, it was good, but overpriced."
"Drink- Missing a few things but was still pretty tasty. The nibs were gone. Didnt taste any of the bitter at all."
"I'm going to get a couple more bottles to put into my cellar."
"GOOD, NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"Poured from bomber (bottled 03/25/11) into a tulip glass. Pours a thick brown-black with nice tan head and lacing that lasts throughout the session. Aroma of dark fruits, roast, sweet chocolate, and cocoa nibs. Big sweet taste of malts, licorice, cocoa and dark fruits. Palate thick and oily, a little sticky with medium carbonation. Bittersweet finish with alcohol burn and minimal hops. This is a big, sweet imperial stout that I wished I cellared a little longer as I bet this will age nicely. The label indicates that this beer would develop well over a five year span."
"O- a nice stout. not very complex but it's not trying to be."
"Good beer but nothing that sets it apart in a loaded class of beers. I bought another bomber to cellar. Looking forward to coming back to it in a couple of years."
"Fuller body, but not as chewy as I would like. Lots of heat, so it should age well. Sweetness takes away a bit as well. Still a nice beer, would be interesting with some time."
"After hearing contrasting reviews from my friends. I thought this beer was damn drinkable. The finish was perfect. Excited to see what a bomber with taste like around Christmas."
"O- Overall good beer missing some stuff and needs age. It is a good beer though for the price i got my bomber for 3.99 each."
"overall: im glad i got my hands on a few of these bottles, but i think ill take a bourbon county any day over this. but, the cocoa nibs really do work some magic in this beer, and im interested to see what my other bottle will taste like in a year or 2."
"D/O - Drinkability is good for how big this brew is. Finishing the bottle wont be hard. Overall, I really enjoyed this bad boy!"
"Nice little beer, but certainly no BCS...."
"Overall this wasn’t quite as sweet as I had feared but if the molasses influence were cut down a bit this would be a much better beer. Still, worth a shot as it is, and I’ll be interested to see other treatments of this beer."
"Great effort, but I'll pass. Overbearing."
"overall really nicely done, dont know why its getting hate i think they have done a very good job with this."
"O - I could get very used to drinking these. A little less flat would really set this off."
"Finish: Bit of heat with the roosted malts and a bit of hops on the back end"
"This is a wonderful beer. A very sweet-chocolatey beer, almost dessert like. While it's not the end-all-be-all Imperial Stout, this is a wonderful beer that I would definitely drink again."
"Overall I really struggled to drink the half bottle I had, and if I had not been sharing, I think the other half would have been a drain pour. Easily my least favorite GI beer I've had in a long while, and I'm glad I only picked up the one bottle."
"O: Pretty good, decent chocolate, little hot, nice malts, some earthy hops, tasty but needs some aging."
"It's good, not great. I wouldn't have seeked it out like many others did, but I happened to see it on the shelf and couldn't turn it down. I'll put the other bottle in the cellar."
"22 ounce bottle, bottled on 3/25/11. Served in a DFH Signature Glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with a half inch brown head that didn't stay around for very long. There's a decent amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is mostly sweet, the brew smells like roasted malt, chocolate, dark fruit, and a bit of coffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some licorice and molasses. Also, the sweet and bitter flavors in this beer are balanced pretty well at first, then the sweet flavors take over more as the beer gets warmer. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and a bit coating with moderate carbonation. It's also smooth and easy to drink. It's a good overall beer, it'll be interesting to see how this one ages."
"a long wait for this and all i can say is not impressed, drank from a snifter this beer has virtually no head and a strange almost cola like smell. not a very good cocoa flavor but nothing bad. big john wasn't awful but didn't really do it for me, i'll just stick with the regular bourbon county"
"(D)- A solid to great stout. I can see this getting even better and a great idea to try it around the end of the year holidays to see how it has developed."
"This was some good smelling, good tasting stuff. The alcohol was hidden despite the strength. On the sweeter side, but that's how I prefer my big stouts. If you can find it, it's a good one!"
"The mouthfeel is as good as other Goose Island imperial stouts: thick, creamy, sticky, coating. Not a thing to complain about with Big John's performance in my mouth. Overall, this was a good bottle of beer. It is not in the same class as the BCBS family of stouts from Goose Island, nor is it in the same realm as fresh Goose Island Nightstalker. Still, it's worth purchasing, especially for fans of Southern Tier stouts or Dark Lord. Put a bottle or two away for a few years. It has too much sweetness and needs to mature. Right now, though, it still drinks quite well."
"O- This beer first off will only get better I think over time. The alcohol really needs to cool off which like I said before will. The chocolate needs to come out a little more for this to be more enjoyable to me. A very good beer that I am glad to have a couple sitting in the cellar."
"Dark, chocolate brown with some of the darkest russet colored foam I've ever seen. Molten fudge, cocoa powder, anise, dark fruit and rum with black strap molasses in the aroma. Semi-sweet chocolate, anise and raisin flavors with warming alcohol and a dry finish. Full bodied with velvety smooth carbonation. Big John is a monster Stout and I really like it a lot. It's not quite up to the level of most of GI's big Stouts but not many are."
"Overall: Rich, chocolaty, and sweet. Enjoyable but a touch over-carbonated."
"Overall, not the best stout from Goose Island, but many other breweries can't brew a stout at this level. I would have liked a smaller ABV, a really some more chocolate."
"This is a very disappointing beer that I am glad now that I was unable to find any locally on shelves. Truly sub-par for Goose Island."
"Big John definitely surprised me with how sweet it was, but it was rather balanced for how big and chocolatey it is. It's nothing like other big stouts made with chocolate in that respect, instead this is a rather graceful blending of flavors, both sweet and bitter."
"The John Hancock Center is my favorite skyscraper. Alas, for an imperial stout, Big John doesn't even come close."
"The cpj"
"Visited NYC this past weekend and chanced upon a bottle of this at a Whole Foods. Pours a Bourbon County Stout dark brown. Smells as advertised - lots of roasted malt and chocolate. Flavor is outstanding - velvety chocolate, somewhat sweet and very malty. Balances great against the fairly thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Overall, I was a big fan of this beer and wish I had a few more bottles."
"O - Interesting take on the BCBS base. Definitely needs time in the cellar. I've had 1 year old Nightstalker, and that was certainly a better experience. I think with that much time on it, this bottle could have easily kept up with that beer."
"Mild chocolate on the medium bodied palate but overall the star is a coffee like roast in the back half of the mouth. It is a decent stout, I'm not trying to bad mouth it, it's just not as interesting as I was hoping, not as good, not as unique. Any of the bourbon stouts are way way better in my opinion."
"The cocoa nibs on which this is aged lend an interesting coco note to the beer, which, in conjunction wiht a moderately creamy mouthfeel, tip this a bit toward the chocolate stout realm. Big malt body with an assertive candy sugar sweetness that, unfortunately, tended to dominate the beer and eventually became oppressive as simply too sweet."
"Overall, a nice, big stout that really highlights the cacao nibs. However, this is probably my least favorite of all the Goose Island imperial stouts. The chocolate flavors can grow a bit tiresome though. Definitely worth a try."
"I recently had GI's Dishonest Stout @Clybourn, I think the addition of cacao would have been better suited to a stout of that nature. The bitterness would have played well with the sourness and the barrel aging. I guess I expect a lot from GI when it comes to stouts. Big John is a fine stout, I just don't think it is up to snuff, when it comes to GI!"
"Mouthfeel is big on flavor and just about full-bodied. Not too thick, but not as carbonated either. A nicely tasting beer, especially in the shadows of GI's flagship stouts in the BCS. Personally, not as good as the BCS or Night Stalker, but still holds its own. Well worth the pay."
"overall, color me impressed. this is a really tasty brew. pricey, but worth it."
"Pours a solid thick black color with a smallish tan head that disappears too quickly. Smells sweet with an alcoholic edge. Heavy dark bitter chocolate and tons of molasses dominate the aroma. Mix in some dark fruits and alcohol for good measure. Taste is again thick sweet and alcoholic. Lots of dark chocolate mixed with brown sugar and molasses. Long lingering alcohol burn after each sip. If not for the alcohol I think this would be a bit overly sweet. Thick viscous body with a sweet velvety smooth mouthfeel and low level of carbonation. I really enjoyed this one but I think a little time will help the flavors meld together a little better."
"O-My favorite Imperial stout from Goose Island because every drink does not taste like a shot of whiskey. Prefer to BCS beers."
"Overall: This beer is fantastic, easily one of the best stouts I've had in quite a while. While it's heavy and the ABV is high, I would be more than happy to sip on this all night."
"Fantastic! If you like Dragon's Milk from New Holland you'll love this beer. The roasted flavors are certainly there, as is a sweetness which is beautifully balanced with other taste sensations. It was suggested to me that I let this bottle settle/condition ... glad I didn't. The label indicates a bottle date of 3/25/11 ... it was perfect to drink on the evening of 5/14/11. I'll be looking for more of this brew."
"O - A good imp stout that is quite complex. Not as cocoa flavored as advertised, but solid."
"Overall this was a really enjoyable beer. It's got a full body with great chocolate flavor. I would love to drink this again on a cold winter night. I disagree with one statement from the brewers notes ""massive chocolate flavor and aroma"". I don't agree it was massive. Southern Tier Choklat is a massive chocolate stout, Big John is not, it's more like a Choklat's little brother. This is a great brew I would definitely buy again."
"Pours a thick, oily, pitch black. Very dense looking beer with almost no head. Surprised at the lack of lacing for such a big stout. Aroma is filled with chocolate, some port-wine fruity characters, and alcohol. Flavor is muted by the alcohol, but I am getting some dark chocolate, roasted malt, sweet dark fruits (raisins ands figs), and molasses. Salty soy-sauce comes through in the finish in a slightly off-putting fashion. Alcohol creates a warming sensation as it goes down. Sliky, creamy mouthfeel with little carbonation. This stout is really on the edge of being too cloyingly sweet. Average stout at best. Maybe another few months would have done this beer some good."
"O - If this were aged, I would definitely rate it higher. The taste and mouthfeel for this fresh of a batch though is amazing. Would definitely buy and cellar this again."
"I liked it a lot, but for some reason I still feel wanting. I was afraid of cellaring this one for fear of the choco flav dieing away, however, I shared with my girlfriend and she said ""Until I had this beer, I've never drank a beer that I thought that needs to age before being drinkable"""
"O- Interesting trying the base for bcs, not my favorite of the big beers from Goose Island but definitely up there."
"O: My first experience with a Goose Island stout, and I must say that their Big John didn't dissapoint. This is a damn good beer, and I'm stoked I've got a bottle of my own. Thumbs up - another winner from Goose Island."
"D – Good brew and all but it didn’t blow me away. It reminded me of bourbon county stout without the bourbon. Glad I tried this brew but wouldn’t seek this out again. Not that big of a fan of this brew"
"D - Reminds me of Bourbon County without the bourbon and more chocolate. Guessing same base beer. Very rich and complex. A sure sipper. Prefer this to Nightstalker."
"Evil genius who thought to brew an imperial stout with chocolate nibs. This is a flawless beer, it even looks pretty. Poured from a 22oz bomber into a snifter and sipped over 2 hours; got better as it warmed up. I am running to the store to buy out the stock, one of my favorite beers of all time, I am a stout man and this is right up there with the DL 2011 I had last week. Less viscous, but equally powerful."
"The mouthfeel was very thick and creamy with carbonation being a little below average. Overall it wasn't amazing, but it was pretty good beer. It had a nice thick look and feel to it and had some bold flavors to it. It came off just a touch sweet and hot though overall which hurt it slightly. Overall I really enjoyed it though."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and there is a film left in your mouth after each sip. There's almost no carbonation and it goes down like water; except for the aftertaste. Overall, a pretty disappointing beer. I expected a little bit more out of this brew. Definitely had much better stouts, glad I bought it once though."
"Up for review is a 22oz bottle of Big John from Goose Island. Poured into a snifter at cellar temp. Nice dark color and an espresso head. Notes of chocolate over roasted malts, dark pitted fruits and hops. Mediu to full body drinks well. Perhaps a bit over carbonated."
"This isn't too bad, but it certainly isn't really that enjoyable for me, kind of middle of the road. No regrets about trying it or purchasing."
"The beer is very dark brown with a thin beige cap that fades rather hastily. The aroma brings a pronounced coffee presence, dark fruits, and mild roast. The flavor is ok. I would prefer more roast and malt flavors, with less dark fruits and sweetness. The finish offers an alcoholic burn, with a subtle lingering bitterness. Overall, I thought this was nowhere near the quality of any of the Bourbon County Stout lineup. Perhaps this will improve some with age, but I find it to be a pretty average imperial stout."
"Overall: I think this one is okay. Not a real easy stout to drink. I think I'm gonna try and age this one. Maybe this will bring out more in the flavor department."
"Meh, the worst of the lot. In fact, I think I'm growing weary of these big sludge bombs that are Goose Island imperials. I think our little tasting that we did satiated an appetite that wasn't there. I'll be taking a break from the big bruising stouts for quite some time while my body tries to process the residuals of this beer."
"Overall: Goose Island has made another damn tasty stout! One of the best ""liquid chocolate"" type beers around. Its aggressive, but rewarding. That being said, if you can get your hands on BCBS instead, drop the extra couple of bucks and buy that."
"O: This is good, enjoy this. The nibs as a lot to this and make it pretty awesome, just sad well never see it again, and if we do it won’t be purchased because of the present situation of the brewery. Oh well, enjoy them if you got them."
"D - I love this drink; would highly recommend to others; would be fantastic with desserts"
"EDIT: Tasted again December 2014--This beer is incredible. Almost like a smoother, more flavorful bourbon county. 5/5 in regard to taste at this point. It looks horrible, just straight up black tar but wow it is amazing."
"This beer is superb. Goose Island makes legitimate bombers and this is no exception. Russian imperial stouts have really grown on me, and Big John is a solid effort from Goose"
"Overall: I really like the Stout style of beers. Big John didn't totally disappoint, but I did have some big expectations for it to live up to. B. John is definetly drinkable and re-drinkable, but when it comes to the dark thick beers, I'll still take a Darkness anyday of the week. Good beer however. Definetly worth a shot."
"O: Not as good as the BCBS, but still very good. I'll be grabbing a few more from the store before they disappear; I suspect they will age for a little while. Try it if you can."
"Overall -- My first question is: where is the cocoa?? The flavor profile is totally dominated by burnt sugars and anise - no chocolatey goodness to be had. I guess this is the closest I'll get to a proper Cook County Stout. Good, if slightly underwhelming."
"D/O- A middle of the road sipper. Most will want to split with a friend or two. Thanks a lot PTMcB!"
"O: I really enjoyed this brew from GI. I am not huge into Russians but I think Big John was very good."
"Mouthfeel is a killer -- silky, smooth, coating and low on the carbonation. Overall, I wasn't as impressed as I was with Nightstalker, that is vastly underrated IMO."
"Overall - a very very good beer I'd love to have a couple glasses of. I'd like to see how the taste would play out with some age to this. Solid all the way around."
"Overall this is a very nice example of a stout and surely one that I will look to stock up on, when I see them around. I can't wait to taste this again after a year or so of aging on it. Enjoy!!!"
"O: The beer is very drinkable considering its strength because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste. There’s no way that I could drink more than one of these in a night because it’s filling and the alcohol will soon catch up with you."
"O: OK."
"750ml bottle shared with some friends. This was very much like Bourbon County, but with the twist of the added cacao nibs. Thick and dark, boozy and chocolately. A slow sipper for sure. It was a great beer but sort of wore me down a bit. I might search this one out again and let it sit for a while"
"D - Pretty drinkable. Super bold flavors make this a bit more of a sipper (as well as the 11.5% abv), but there is a lot to enjoy. Lots of chocolate flavor from start to end really goes well with the imperial stout base."
"This is really an exceptional imperial stout. Delicious."
"Overall: a good imperial stout but nothing really stands out about this one. It tastes like a less complex Bourbon Brand County Stout, owed to the lack of barrel aging, and the cacao nibs really didn't add anything that I could taste. Still, a fairly good imperial stout and worth a try... but not worth going nuts over. Cheers!"
"Drinks fantastic too. I'll always be looking for this one when it comes around again."
"O-I really liked this beer. Its a sipper for sure, but every sip was a pleasure. If you like ""dessert"" beers, this one should be right up your alley, but if you don't enjoy the sweeter/more chocolatey brews, pass on this one."
"Very tasty overall. I drank it pretty quickly for the abv… yet it was thick and creamy enough to savor."
"Overall: A nice Imperial Stout, not super great or earth-shattering but very enjoyable. Could use more carbonation and ""oomph""/excitement, but it works good as it is."
"631"
"dark black typical stout color with weak brown head. moderate lacing appears on the glass however, in a clear film reminiscent of wine lacing. big malt smell, along with molasses and a touch of chocolate, although faint. taste is bitter upfront, slightly hot, with more sweet molasses than chocolate. thick motor oil mouthfeel. this is my first goose island stout. It's decent, but not the best double I've had. Hides the alcohol well despite the ABV, but that's really the best thing going for it."
"Full bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is carbonated just enough to keep it from being syrupy but it is still rather sticky."
"Overall: This is a really solid stout, definitely placing itself in my personal top 5 list. It's not entirely a unique flavor, but definitely superior to most that I have encountered in the current market. If I find it at another store, or if it becomes an annual brew, I will definitely purchase more."
"Overall, it's another successful stout from GI. It's a sipper. Take your time and enjoy it."
"This beer pours the blackness that I always knew that it would be. But it comes from good stout bloodlines so it was inevitable. The aroma takes an odd note of being boozy and roast filled, which is strong even for my advanced tastes. The taste is...holy crap...dark chocolate. I was looking to see if I could taste a touch of Augustus Gloop because there is seriously a chocolate river in my glass. This beer I like very much, it's got good flavor, look pretty, goes down smooth enough to enjoy greatly. This is a win in my book. Well done AB...GI...whatever."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the knockout flavoring of the chocolate. While we were certainly expecting a big presence, it was hard to anticipate such nib action on the scale delivered. It really knocks you to the ground!! What was also surprising, in a good way, was how fruity it was. While those dark fruits were not the star, they were big enough through the middle and end, and really brought out some of the subtle complexities within."
"This gets funkier as it warms up. It gets a lot darker and a bit dryer. It still finishes well but there's kind of a barnyard funk. I wonder what a few years in the bottle will do to it. The alcohol is well hidden up front but maybe it also contributes to the way the finish lingers."
"Overall: Another solid offering from Goose Island, better than average imperial stout. After drinking Big John, I do prefer the Bourbon County Stout to Big John. This beer will probably be better after it has a year or two in the cellar. Not much complexity and the sweet and bitter chocolate/cocoa flavors are the star players of this beer. A bit on the overcarbonated side as well. It is still worth seeking out a pint of this beer."
"Well balanced for such a big stout."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: This beer is full bodied with low, creamy carbonation. One of the best aspects of the beer. I did enjoy this imperial stout quite a bit, but it's a bit sweet overall without a lot of roasted malt character. Not a lot of bitterness to offset."
"Decent, but not that impressive. The alcohol heat was kind of surprising and could have been better integrated. I'll probably pass on purchasing this again in the future."
"Pours a very dark brown, but of course is pitch black in the tulip, with no head or lacing. Aroma is plenty of chocolate gentle roastiness, and a slight sting of alcohol in the nostrils, but I like boozy beers. The taste is a bit a hot, but it's not overwhelming. Booziness is front and center along with bitter baker's chocolate, and lots of graininess. Roast isn't as in-depth as I would typically like from an imperial stout, but I think this was done on purpose to let the chocolate really come out, which is definitely there in good supply. Mouthfeel is nearly full with an above average carbonation for the style, but plenty of swirling in the Duvel tulip toned it down a bit and it became nice and creamy, although the alcohol is definitely noticeable. This is definitely a tasty beer, but I think it needs about 6 months on it to mellow out the rough edges from the cocoa nibs, and I'll look forward to trying my other bottle in the fall."
"Good beer. No depth, but if you like chocolate, this is a must-try."
"O - excellent beer. Very complex and extremely tasty! Too bad Goose Island sold out to the big brewers...we might not see things like this from them again."
"O- I didn't really know what to expect from this beer but this wasn't it. Not bad by any means but lacks some key components to make this a real winner."
"Smooth, creamy MF, potentially a tad much carbonation for my tastes. Overall very good, it's lacking a bit of the ""it"" factor, but I liked the sum a bit more than its individual parts (which is a good thing)."
"This is a solid impy stout but not in the league of the BCS series. Really good stout, lots of chocolate."
"O - Perhaps a bit too sweet for me and really, I could use a little more alcohol on the nose and palate. That said, it's still a very solid stout and we'll see what some age does to this one."
"Bottle. Poured into a DFH tulip glass a pitch black color with a 1 finger mocha tan head of tiny bubbles. More carbonated than I thought it would be. Roasty, bitter chocolate notes in the nose with a touch of alcohol as well. Medium/heavy mouthfeel with carbonation, maybe a little too carbonated and light for my tastes. The roast hits me first followed by a dry, bitter sweet chocolate flavor. The chocolate is more bitter to me than actually sweet. Booze is apparent in this one. Overall, a little let down by this."
"O= Not quite as flavorful and complex as I had hoped but still a nice large beer. Worth checking out but not spending an arm and leg for."
"Finally gonna be able to make up my mind about this beer after hearing all sorts o' chatter surrounding it. It pours a deeply dark black-brown topped by a finger of dirty cream foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, toasted oak, molasses, and rich chocolate. The taste holds plenty of roasted malts and chocolate (both dark and syrup), molasses, light oak, brown sugar, and light coffee. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a chewy feel. Overall, a solid stout indeed. I would not really call it great, but I would not turn down another bottle were it offered me."
"Overall: I can't say it's bad. I'd drink it again, but I was hoping for stronger flavors & smells. It's rather tame, considering the name ""Big John."""
"The beer is decent, but not great... Certainly not a beer I'm going to get worked up over."
"O- I really liked it. very good stout and very tasty. can't think of anything it taste like and that's the best part. Glad to seek it out again and give it a bit to mellow out, loved the dark chocolate tho!"
"O: This is well-made, but it has some flaws (others might call them signatures) that I've come to associate with Goose Island. I have more coming, and I will definitely sit on one bottle for at least six months to see if that quells the alcoholic beast raging within."
"Drinkability- A little too sweet for my liking but its good. Definitely chocolaty but I would have liked the roast and sweetness to have been toned down just a touch. Sort of let the nibs show. The mouthfeel is amazing though, absolutely amazing."
"Glad I got two, but this isn't my favorite from GI - I think I liked the hoppy balance of Night Stalker more - a bottle of each will sit in solitary confinement for a while before I take them out."
"O: Overall I enjoyed this , lots of complex flavors that seem to express themselves as it warms - well blended and balanced ."
"22oz. bomber served in a snifter. Poured a deep brown with a thick tan head. Aroma of chocolate, but kind of a synthetic note. Also a bit of alcohol. Full bodied and rich. Flavor is much more chocolate rather than roasted barley. Long dry malty finish. Very smooth, pretty easy drinking for 11%. This beer didn't really make a big impression on me."
"I expected much more than what I got from this beer. It feels raw and the booze flavor needs to settle down some."
"Notes: Didn't really get the cocoa nibs. Not the first cocoa beer that I've missed them. I suppose I don't really get the flavor. In any event, this is an epic beer and I believe rivals Dark Lord in style and character. Can't get DL? Grab this one."
"Notes: This is a pretty sturdy brew. Alcohol and body definitely make their prescence known. Big, chewy, and complex, I would like to see how this brew evolves over time. A great effort by Goose Island, and one I will definitely be buying more of."
"notes - this would do well with age and would probably develop into a world class brew. Now it is a bit too hot but very nice and complex while still being quite smooth."
"Overall, a mixed bag."
"O) I'm not sure if comparisons are encouraged, but compared to Goose Island's Nightstalker, which is also very much enjoyed by me, this beer is better on all accounts. The smooth and thick texture, with flavors that are present but not overpowering are the keys attributes I look for in big stouts, and this is a great example of that."
"Once again I am pretty satisfied with goose island they rarely disappoint I would and will be picking up a few more of these."
"(D)- I'm a big fan of the BCB family of stouts. Given this, I'm going to make a bold statement and say this is my favorite GI beer. It strikes the perfect balance of sweetness and bitterness to achieve a perfect stout."
"o - overall, i'm rather impressed with this beer. i was not expecting the chocolate to add as much as it does. it is not overbearing like baker's chocolate or dark chocolate, but more of a silky hershey's milk chocolate. it really compliments the base beer and i'm happy to have a few more bottles of this to sit on. as i drank the beer the booziness came out and the chocolate seemed a bit in my face, but still a really big improvement on night stalker."
"Nice creamy mouthfeel, good amount of carbonation keeps things light on the palate. Big cocoa, dark chocolate, cream, mocha latte like, bitter chocolate on the finish with black fruits through the middle. Blueberry on the finish is very nice and adds a layer of complexity. Vanilla is driven and sweet. Some sugary sweetness throughout. Another great stout by the Goose. Will they last?"
"Delicious throughout, the sheer weight and richness of the beer make it both a delicacy and limit its drinkability. The full force of chocolate and sweetness, sometimes aspirtame-like, scream about the focus of the beer while balance and complexity are underscored."
"Overall, a pour result from a beer I've been waiting for. I guess this is what happens when you become consumed by a selloff instead of focusing on brewing good beer."
"O- I guess this is the last hurrah for the original GI... and what a way to finish! Coffee, Vanilla, Rare, and a Chocolate finish... Not as brilliant as the formentioned... but a damn fine stout on its own."
"I plan to update this review as this one ages…just need to find a few more bottles. I expect huge improvements with age as the alcohol is the biggest issues with this beer right now."
"Give this beer some more time and it could be quite fantastic."
"Pours a very, very dark brown color with a thin light mocha head and a bit of lacing. The nose has roasted malt plus chocolate and some mild coffee. Chocolate is the most prevalent, definitely notice the cocoa. Flavor is a bit of a letdown. There's a bit too much booze and the chocolate doesn't come through as well. Mild roast and also some dark fruit aspects that I didn't particularly care for. Body is medium to full with good carbonation. Pretty good overall, but doesn't live up to their other stouts."
"Overall this exceeded expectations. Im not the biggest stout guy but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Glad I have a bottle of this to lay down to smooth out the edges."
"O- I'm all about this brew. Huge flavors that blend perfectly and make for a superb ride. Big enough to cure what ales you but easy enough to down a big ole glass. Well done GI hope you can keep it up with the new owners."
"D- too sweet for me. im glad i wasnt a glutton with this and left a couple on the shelf. i wouldnt enjoy having them. i liked nightstalker and the classic bourbon county much more than this. the bottle was much too large for just me."
"(O) Really good. I love it. I think that since its fresh, the taste is still really sweet and chocolaty, but with some time on it I think the flavors will blend and mellow a bit more and will turn out to be still a great beer."
"Smooth, thick mouthfeel that goes down easy. Only the smallest notice of the alcohol. I think this will age very well. Another superior stout from Goose Island."
"D-An amazing beer. The alcohol is not present, a sipper but a great sipper at that. I love this beer, one the best I've ever had."
"Drinkability:This is a fantastic brew when fresh, and I really hope that the hot alcohol bite lessens as the beer ages. The chocolate flavors make this a great sipping dessert beer."
"O) What surprised me here is the overall drinkability of this which I thought was pretty easy given the ABV. Not sure what aging would do to this (but hopefully I'll find out!). Really enjoyed this....this would have been a great holiday release!"
"O- It's a good brew, I just wish it were more available. I have yet to try a BCBS of any kind, and I have not cracked open the bottle of night stalker I have in my fridge, but if the quality goes up from here, then I can't wait to try them all!"
"Overall this is another hit by GI. While its a little on the sweet side and I wish it started with some more bourbon flavor its a great beer. I hope I can get this for awhile longer because I would like to age some."
"O: This beer is great. It reminded me of Ten Fidy, but this one has a great bourbon twist on it."
"A very pleasant chocolate stout, but lacking somewhat in cohesion, Big John is worth a go. However, I'd place it behind Night Stalker and all members of the BCBS family in the Goose imperial stout sweepstakes."
"Pours thick with light toffee colored head. Strong aromas of chocolate and coffee. Smooth and sweet at first, then settles into a subtle, pleasing bitterness. You can taste the malt, not at all boozy, and ends with a subtle linger of flavor at the back of the palate. In my opinion an excellent beer."
"Otherwise, an exceptional imperial stout."
"O: Delicious and potent. Definitely a sipper, it’s very strong in both flavor and alcohol content."
"A solid effort that comes up a bit short when compared with some of Goose Island's other epic big stouts. Solid, but a bit flawed flavors and construction with a bit of alcohol heat."
"O: Yet another fine rendition on the Bourbon County theme, minus the bourbon and plus the chocolate. It's a fine alternative if you ever get sick of whiskey beers but still want an excellent all around imperial stout with more than simple malt complexity. Give this some age, though, perhaps a year, and it'll be even better."
"Of the cocoa nibbed beers that I have had, this is thicker than any of them. Similar in taste to Teddy Bear kisses which was great, this has a much thicker body and many more roasted / smoked flavors in it. Neither are overdone and this is another great job by GI. Light Carbonation which is about right for the style"
"O: Well this is yet another delicious variant of the BCS base beer. This one doesn't have as much character as the rest, but is still incredibly delicious."
"Overall im a huge fan, have 4 bottles left, ill drink two and save two. I hope this will get better with age, im sure it will"
"EDIT: It's about an hour later and the beer was warmed up to room temperature. I'm enjoying it much more this way. The sweetness seems a bit cut down and the individual chocolate flavor seems to pop. This is as much as a sipper as fresh BCS but I'm enjoying the second half of the bomber MUCH more than the first. I've bumped up a few of the scores to match."
"O- A pretty damn good stout, considerably better than Night Stalker in my opinion. Definitely worth drinking again."
"Good beer, worth getting some bottles of, one of the better chocolate forward beers i've had."
"O- Overall thought it was a very good beer and think it would only get better with age lettin more cacao come through on the palate... will definitely be gettin a couple more to put away for a year or two to see if it improves."
"Overall, very interesting and tasty to say the least. However, this Imperial Stout demands age on it. The heat should tone down and bring out more of those chocolate nib flavors with some time on it. I'm glad I have another bottle in the cellar :)"
"I'm quite happy with this latest GI offering. I look forward to buying myself a couple bottles of this fantastic brew that's right up there with BC Stout."
"I was lucky enough to try this on tap at Goose Island's Stout Fest. It poured a viscous and lifeless black with a dark khaki head. It looks a lot like the Night Stalker. The aromas are full of milk chocolate and dark roasted malts. I expected it to be a little more bitter and it was sweeter than I anticipated. The flavors too were of sweet milk chocolate, coffee, and dark roasted malts. I expected some bitterness from the Columbus hops but it remained to be a sweeter milk chocolate throughout. I was also glad it didn't have any lasting char. It drank very smooth for the style and the 11.5% wasn't noticeable at all. It was thick and coated the palate, leaving a sweet but not too sweet aftertaste. I'll definitely pick up a couple bottles of this when it comes out next month."
