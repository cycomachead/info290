Is it the best BA beer I've had? No that probably still goes to Bourbon County Coffee but this deserves the praise and is one outstanding world class brew.","BergBeer","Wednesday at 06:47 AM"

The coffee character is bitter and peppery, and the whiskey character is a bit harsh. Bourbon beers and coffee Stouts have come a long way since this beer first made the scene. Can't compete with the likes of BA Speedway or CBS for that matter.","Wowcoolman","Tuesday at 10:34 PM"
4.31,-6.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"This was my first KBS.  Poured into snifter, jet black, small head that dissipates quick, strong lacing throughout.  Heavy bourbon in the nose.  Taste was more mild than expected after smelling, at least with the bourbon.  It was present for sure in a big way, imparting a smooth, almost vanilla-like taste.  I didn't get the roasty, coffee presence FBS brings and I was actually glad for that.  This was a sipper but a very smooth one.  Very much enjoyed my first KBS.","Jwburns75","Tuesday at 08:55 PM"

5,8.2,5,5,5,5,5,"2015, on tap and in bottle are both amazing (No hype required). I won't compare it to the other bourbon aged beers because it has its own unique way of doing things. To me the bourbon is present but it is more subtle and doesn't overwhelm the other flavors of chocolate and coffee.  I do love the bourbon heavy beers as well, but KBS is much smoother and refined imo. Had a chance to meet Jeremy K. The brew master at a local seminar and local tapping. Smaller town in MN and was not crowded at all.  Very laid back and humble about all his beers. I haven't rated a lot of good beers that I should have. I would say, don't pick a favorite. Also just because it's new and super rare and you got some, doesn't make it better or worse than those who have been perfecting their style and can make more of it. Beer isn't a hipster fashion trend it's been around a long time and will be for a long time.","Jahjehwa","Apr 05, 2015"

The smell is predominately coffee and chocolate.  Can smell the bourbon but it isn't overpowering.  More highly carbonated than I expected.  As to the taste, I expected more bourbon. It's an incredibly smooth blend of coffee, chocolate, and toffee with a somewhat bitter finish.  It's also a lighter mouthfeel than I expected.  Overall, this is a very fine stout but I can't justify the hype.  I actually like Founders Imperial Stout better but that isn't a criticism of KBS.  Perhaps my expectations were not reasonable given the difficulty in finding this stout.  I'm going to age a couple of bottles and I might change this rating based upon the results.","MacMalt","Apr 04, 2015"

Some bourbon barrel stouts make you forget that you're drinking a beer and force you to drink this lighter body bourbon with less burn (BCBS), and that's fine and all, but it isn't a beer. I'm drinking '15 KBS and I'm hit with the coffee up front, then it fades to sweet chocolate and vanilla notes at the end. It isn't as nearly as boozy as BCBS (though doesn't have as high alcohol % either). As per which is a better "beer," 2014 BCBS or 2015 KBS, I'd say the KBS.

However, given the hype this beer receives, I'm left with the question of why. It's solid, it's good, and it has been matched and surpassed by many other stouts out there. If you can get it without serious effort or resources, it's worth trying. It's assuredly not worth standing in line for.","UrbanCaveman","Mar 17, 2015"

Plus, as I mentioned I'm not a fan of coffee flavor d beers. This being offered at the bar was a perfect scenario for me. The beer was blended extremely well, yet it was so complex. There were so many flavors mixed in and none really stuck out or outshined the other. A very solid BA offering that is ready to drink. I wouldn't age this one. I think it would risk losing some of those great subtleties and undertones. Plus, I think with time some of the other flavors may fade bringing the bolder flavors forward, thus destroying that perfectly balanced liquid harmony that currently exists!!!","mitch3114","Mar 08, 2015"

You can smell dark roasted malts - almost burnt, strong espresso or dark italian coffee, hint of vanila with a slight aroma of bourbon.  I do smell oak.  It is thick in the mouth much the way it appears.  Medium body though - would have thought it would be heavier.  Tastes are all above with bourbon underlying most of them.  I tasted more dark chocolate and coffee than anything else.  ABV is very well concealed.  However, this beer has been so hyped to me it was doomed to disappoint.  Hoping I just had a bad bottle.

4.29,-7.1,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. I was gifted this bottle on my retirement, and I'm very excited to try this legendary stout. Pours pitch black, with the consistancy of 30 weight, with a thin, light brown head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt with a hint of char, drip coffee, hints of vanilla and nuts; no noteable bourbon. Flavor of toasted, charred malt, boiled down coffee, vanilla, bitter chocolate, hints of bourbon and oak. Malty to start, with coffee flavors developing to finish with the more light acidic flavor of coffee and oak. Nice medium to heavy bodied with light creaminess. A well made coffee stout with a good balance between the coffee and malt, with perhaps a bit more coffee than expected, but the fresh coffee flavors have faded in the barrel, which left surprisingly light bourbon flavors. ABV well covered. Glad I got the chance to try this classic.","LiquidAmber","Jan 24, 2015"

It has not a nice coffee, chocolate, vanilla bitter sweet flavor that I think makes this beer unique from other BA stouts, it almost seems as if this Founders Breakfast Stout barrel aged, even though it's not. I think it could use a little more bourbon presence but it's definitely a world class stout. If this was available every Spring in CA, I would definitely buy as much as possible.","Catracho5","Jan 07, 2015"

Finish brings a last push of oak barrel and bourbon, smoke and some earthy notes.  Super smooth mouthfeel, finishes dry and carries the bittering flavors perfectly.

The first taste I was a little disappointed because there was not a much heat or bourbon taste as I expected but as it warmed up I realized that the slight burn of it is was made it so great. No reason to age it. After ordering food and letting it warmed up I realized the great notes of bourbon, vanilla  and coffee.  Overall couldn't be happy and understand the hype of this beer.","Punisher","Nov 13, 2014"

4.25,-8,,,,,,"Begins with toffeish malts and a pungent bourbon bite , followed by a gentle wooden note and a supportive coffee infusion, accompanied by smooth, creamy milk chocolate. Vanilla provides a delicate peak to the foundation of the beer, which gets perfectly along with the sweeter, toffeish part of the brew, while also calming the alcohol burn. The coffee falls off soon, as we paired the '14 version next to the '12, developing in a very pleasant way above the sweeter notes, followed by a hint of Bourbon. The older version, while missing the coffee, blends the different flavor directions more carefully, adding many layers, which are related to each other to the taste, also the Bourbon is more recognizable. Finishes with wooden, sweeter malts, still extremely smooth on the palate, while the recent version adds a slick, well integrated coffee bitterness, among a sharp boozy echo.","aleigator","Nov 13, 2014"

3,-35.1,,,,,,"In my opinion, KBS is overrated. It tastes entirely like bourbon with no real detectable beer. I like the idea of bourbon-barrel aged beer, but the bourbon flavor should be more subtle and not overpower the beer completely. Don't get me wrong, I'd drink this over and over again from a shot glass. Quite heavy alcohol flavor as well. But for a beer? Nah. The funny thing is, for all the hype, when I admitted to the guy at work that gave me his last one that I didn't care too much for it, he confessed to not caring for it himself. Ditto for a few other beer buddies at work. I'm a huge fan of most of Founders' varieties. Their porters, stouts, IPAs, scotts and pales are all among my favorites. I'll probably try this again, because I'm not one to give up on something after one taste, but for now I'm not a fan.","Chris_Hager","Nov 08, 2014"

Smell is very minimal bourbon with lots of coffee. Some wood smell. Taste is coffee with more bourbon than the smell. Very good. One of the best beers I've had. Poured the beer somewhere around 55 degrees.","kkleu357","Sep 24, 2014"

It is super smooth and elegant. The nose was somewhat subdued, coffee, licorice and a hint of bourbon. Taste had these and a bit of tobacco but all in much more distinct ways than the nose. I expected a big monster of a beer but this was smooth, subtle, and nuanced in flavor. Did it live up to the hype? How could it? But it was one pretty amazing beer and an astonishingly well-balanced one.","Qbdoo","Sep 22, 2014"

Exactly what you would expect from the description of the beer and as good as you would expect it to be. Flavor follows suit. A medium bodied mouthfeel, not too active to allow the flavors to stick around in your mouth. Overall, an absolutely phenomenal beer. Exactly what I hoped it would be. Right up there with Big Bad Baptist for my favorite barrel aged coffee stout --> I'll take Big Bad Baptist when I want the emphasis to be on the coffee, I'll take KBS when I want the emphasis to be on the barrel. Either way, can't go wrong. This beer is elite.","denver10","Sep 14, 2014"

FBS is head and shoulders above this beer, and this isn't in the same universe as BCBS, which I rated last night - it got all 5's. This is a good solid beer, don't get me wrong. And with all the discussions and history of this beer, you MUST try it. But in my humble opinion, this is above average at best. The flavors are good here, but not bold enough. The bitter and the bourbon carry the day. The nose on this beer is incredible, I will give it a 5 - but this does not carry over into the taste. And the mouthfeel I felt was somewhat lacking - almost watery. But this is just my personal rating. There are those that preach this as the gospel beers. As for me, I am not a believer.","blackcompg","Jul 01, 2014"

In the dark it was hard to tell the exact color but I'd say deep black with a quarter-inch tan head. Aroma is beautiful - the tell-tale Kentucky bourbon followed by chocolate and roast malt. Taste is phenomenal. The bourbon is there and is unmistakably Kentucky mash. An additional complex range of flavors pass over the tongue - chocolate, cherries, hints of dried fruit, roast, wood. This is an amazing beer. Now I understand the hype, but I sure wish it was more obtainable.","FFreak","Jun 30, 2014"

This one is complex enough to reveal itself in different ways to different palates; to me, it's not as enjoyably complex as, say, BCBS.

The coffee is noticabley similar to Black Xantus, but Black Xantus gets really really good after two years of cellaring and perhaps this would also. I'm glad that I could have a chance to drink and rate it. After letting it warm it does improve and becomes more blended and refined. I would wait for it to warm for 15 to 20 minutes to get maximum enjoyment.","RutgersEng","Jun 27, 2014"

After having the "Big 3" of barrel-aged imperial stouts (this, Parabola, and BCBS), I'd put BCBS 1st, Parabola 2nd, and this one 3rd. But to dismiss this beer entirely would be folly: it's more (dare I say) 'elegant' than the other two, every bit as complex, and well balanced with a delicate bourbon character. Like I said, it's just not extremely exciting: BCBS is over-the-top in the best way possible, and Parabola - despite its incredible harshness - is loaded with a metric ton worth of twists and turns. This just seems a little muddled and unexciting in comparison. I'd definitely drink this again. I'd still buy this again if I got so lucky.

The beer is black with a huge khaki head that settled into a ring of lace around the edges with a light spotty cover over the top. The lacing was sticky and and residue remained around the glass as I drank the beer. There is minimal lacing. I drink bourbon and the booze is apparent in the smell. This brew tastes like it smells. The taste of dark malts, chocolate, coffee and the barrel are impressive. The mouthfeel is smooth. For me there is some rawness to this brew, maybe because I love bourbon and it is a unique taste. I sipped and savored this beer for over an hour. This is an excellent beer that I will search out more often, after I drink those I have, since it unavailable in my region.

An excellent looking Imperial stout. Scents of oak, vanilla, rich chocolate, notes of bourbon, some faint coffee and a hint of alcohol. A wonderful, enticing, rich, strong aroma profile, that is amazingly executed and extremely appealing. Flavor begins with a rich hit of roasted black coffee, mingled with some dark cocoa and roast malt flavors and hints of bittersweet chocolate, moving into more abundant flavors of rich bittersweet and dark chocolate, cocoa and now notes of bourbon and alcohol, alongside some oak and vanilla. Finish is heavy on oak, bourbon and alcohol flavors, with roasted coffee and cocoa notes present as well. Aftertaste is roasted coffee, cocoa powder, bourbon, alcohol and notes of oak. An amazing flavor profile that is rich, bold and wonderfully balanced between coffee, cocoa, chocolate and bourbon flavors. Simply fantastic. Mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation and a pronounced alcohol warmth with a smooth and somewhat silky feel. An excellent mouthfeel that is both smooth and warming and lends it self well to sipping. Very well done. Overall this is an amazing stout with a fantastic aroma profile, a wonderful flavor profile and an excellent mouthfeel that aids the entire experience. Well worth having.","Auraan","May 20, 2014"

Smooth bourbon on the nose with lovely aromas of roasted malts. Creamy mouthfeel and delicious roasty bourbon and even chocolate on the sip. The coffee flavors come through so well as it hits the back of my tongue. The I breathe out and catch all of the great flavors again. Bravo.","Dawgboned37","May 20, 2014"

Great beer, though I can't help thinking I'd rather have a Founders Imperial Stout in it's stead. The more I drink, the more I realize these BA stouts just don't quite do it for me. That barrel aging really thins out the brew and kills the depth in roasted bitterness; two qualities that I look forward to greatly in Impy stouts. Oh well, this wasn't my first, and it won't be my last.","TheSixthRing","May 12, 2014"

Smells like a pancake breakfast. tastes, smooth with wonderful notes of syrup, roasted malt, coffee with enough hop bitterness to balance. No strong alcohol flavor. Thick and wonderful without being cloying. What makes this work so well is that no flavor is overpowering yet easily layered and distinguishable. Just perfect.","jneiswender","Apr 28, 2014"

I'd probably like it more if it were a beer I could find readily available throughout the year. The real scandal here is that I believe Founders Imperial Stout to be a better beer. This is also my first time trying it. If I'm able to score another bottle in the future, I will age it to test out the difference.

Still, it's silky smooth, and retains a superb balance with being boozy, chewy and sweet near the end..with a sticky choco-marshmallow-like sensation. Big, dense and complex. Worthy indeed. My lasting impression is that yes, this is a world class imperial stout. All the flavors I enjoy about the style are present, and balanced perfectly in such a high abv. Although I've had great stouts well above this strength, KBS would benchmark that game for me. Over a week later I have a lasting impression of the KBS flavor. Unique, and damn tasty.

It poured black as pitch with a cocoa-colored head.  The nose is complex with coffee and vanilla notes right up front preparing my palate for deliciousness.  And delicious it was, with all the roasted coffee at first, followed by the sweetness from the bourbon-barrel aging and malts.

I asked the bartender to check the keg to make sure it was KBS. He knew exactly what I was talking about and agreed with me. Zero bourbon flavor. If this beer was aged in bourbon barrels, then it wasn't for long or the barrel had been used several times. This beer tasted like an iced coffee. The mouth feel was thin. If you think this is a great beer, I suggest you try a goose island bourbon county stout. Everyone around me said the same thing. I enjoyed the beer, just did not live up to the hype.","bigjerk89","Apr 15, 2014"

First off this beer does a great job masking the alcohol at 11.2 %. Started with refrigerated bottle into snifter which gave off vague bourbon tones (good thing) but had to wait tor the dark chocolate and coffee tones to become more present as beer warmed. Second day poured room temp into pint glass. Chocolate and coffee tones more present in smell which becomes sort of an oatmeal cookie (again good thing). Third was cellari-sh temp and followed more like the second tasting. Overall very smooth and rich, the best BALANCED bourbon barrel aged stout I've had but I've Only just begun...","TravlynMan","Apr 14, 2014"

Swishing the beer around leaves an oily residue and spotty lacing on the sides. Smell is an intense mix of chocolate, coffee, bourbon, vanilla, cinnamon, etc. Taste is equally complex, and includes all the aforementioned; heavy on roasted malts. A mild wave of bourbon heat shows up in the throat after every sip. After the first taste it's hard to restrain myself from downing this in a minute. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy and palette-coating. An exceptional beer.","xungmound98","Apr 07, 2014"

The smell is fantastic, like chocolate milk and vanilla bourbon. I've had many stouts flavored with coffee and chocolate before but this one definitely takes the cake, far and away. The first thing that hits the palate is the oak and the bourbon with a little bit of coffee bitterness. You can definitely tell that this beer is 11.2% alcohol; it warms the throat but in a very pleasant way. The aftertaste is very forward on the chocolate with undertones of coffee. It was mildly carbonated, and I enjoyed it more as it warmed up. Overall, fantastic beer.

Essentially, it's very similar to last year in terms of my tasting notes. However nose-wise, I feel that the coffee is very subdued, and the bourbon is a bit watered down. Not as much vanilla (from the bourbon/oak) or oak presence here. The bourbon really doesn't hit me in the face as much as it did in last year's vintage. Flavourwise, plenty of sweet chocolate flavours, dark malts, milk chocolate, some coffee which is clearly not as noticeable as BCBCS et al. On the backend, there is more of a solid straight bourbon flavour that is initially sweet and a bit ashy, but the barrel contribution is relatively minimal. Good mouthfeel, viscous but a bit hot, leaves a nice warmth in my stomach as I drink it. But overall this is a slight letdown for me considering how much I enjoyed last year's version. It could very well be palate evolution or bottle variation.","Stevedore","Apr 02, 2014"

There's no head to speak of but some khaki bubbles around the rim. The nose is bold with chocolate , vanilla, coffee beans, and wood from the bourbon barrel aging. These notes are in harmony with each other -- each comes through in a big way but nothing overpowers the rest. When tasting it, the sweetness of the vanilla plays off the natural bitterness of the coffee and chocolate for a balance of flavors, putting each ingredient on a pedestal to speak for itself. The oak and bourbon lend a secondary profile of woodsiness, burned toast, and molasses to make this beer an absolute pleasure to drink, and it all goes down creamy and smooth. The alcohol is absolutely undetectable. I wanted to age my other bottle, but I don't know if I can keep myself from cracking it open.","itsscience","Apr 01, 2014"

I've had the pleasure of having these beer three times before: 2010 Nassau, NY beer fest, 2011 Nassau NY beer fest and 2012 in a bar in Rhode Island. Completely missed out last year; until now. On my yeary visit to my undergrad school in Wilmington, NC, I came across a few bottles of 2013 KBS at my old beer store, Lighthouse Beer and Wines (Wrightsville Beach, NC). I hadn't been there in over 3 years and all the staff remembered me, so they just happened t mention the hidden KBS behind the counter. I couldn't appreciate it more. Glad I have a few 4-pks of KBS lined up for this year. Founders does it right!","BoardwalkBock","Mar 15, 2014"

While visiting some friends in Kalamazoo, MI, several friends suggested making a trip to Grand Rapids to try the seasonal release of the KBS from Founders. We arrived around 5 am in the morning to find people wrapped around the brewery almost twice over. By the time noon rolled around, we found out that cases were no longer being sold because of the unanticipated number of people in queue. 30 minutes later, 12-packs were no longer available, and eventually by the time there were less than 50 people in front of us, we were informed that there were no longer any bottles available but the taproom still had plenty. We went in and I bought a pint and was immediately impressed. For a stout-drinker like myself, it was the epitome of perfection! It is slightly sweet from the higher-ABV, but otherwise a world-class beer!","bdubs22","Mar 12, 2014"

I'm a hop head through and through but this was one that I couldn't pass up. I was up in Waterbury VT for a beer release this past weekend and was fortunate enough to find myself at the Prohibition Pig - one of my favorite taprooms I might add. They had a keg of KBS from 2012 that they tapped. Immediately with your first sip you get notes of coffee but before you know it they are taken over by chocolate and vanilla. This is one of the smoothest beers that I have ever had. There is just no bitterness to it. If it wasn't for the ABV north of 11% I could drink this all night. This is the second time I was blessed with trying this beer. The first time was in the bottle.","dinosvino","Feb 19, 2014"

Oh here we go, Just like heaven~ All the for mentioned stuff in 'Aroma' Chocolate, Coffee, Smokey, Milk, Espresso, Bourbon, Vanilla and Oak~ Also, over tones of Brown Sugar, Cinnamon, Raisin, Dark Fruit and Mocha~ This Stout lives up to its name, overall very rich, complex and smooth... Many flavors can be picked up, however its the strong... Coco, Oak, Vanilla and Mocha paired with just probably the smoothest creamiest cascading texture I have ever felt that make this a superior brew that easily lives up to the hype, factor in a HUGE 11.2 ABV that only leaves a faint burn at best and you have what I believe may be the (or at least top 3) of the universes greatest beers, A new reigning champ in my book~ Overall: 98","BrewUSA","Jan 19, 2014"

4.84,4.8,4.5,4.75,5,4.75,4.75,"Poured into a chilled pint glass. Deep dark, almost black color, with thin beige head, lots of tiny bubbles, and strong, consistent lacing throughout. On the nose, strong scents of chocolate, caramel, toffee, and butterscotch jump out of the glass. And I think I smell a hint of cinnamon (or some other peppery spice). The bourbon/alcohol is not readily apparent until the first taste, and them BAM! On the palate, the bourbon announces itself, draped in a silky smooth chocolatey/coffee awesomeness. Yowza! Incredible balance between the rich, velvety malts and the balls to the wall bourbon bonanza. When I die, please embalm me with this nectar of the gods. The mouthfeel is full, lush, and absolutely chewy wonderful. Before KBS, I would not have considered myself a huge stout fan. But now? Sell the wife & kids, burn down the house, empty the 401(k), and move to Buenos Aries with a truckload of this shit (if you can get it)! Hallelujah!!!!","JohnParadee","Jan 01, 2014"

Contains all the aspects I love in a stout, as well as oak forward characteristics I enjoy in oak-aged beverages. What's so impressive is how restrained and subtle so many of the flavors are. And, dare I say refreshing? It's a premier cigar beer, no doubt, but I could have this any day of the week, regardless of the occasion. It's complex, but extremely easy to approach. All of the elements are well thought out. I, however, feel the roasted coffee character is the highlight of the beer, and it's unfortunate that it probably wouldn't age as well as others of its league. Nevertheless, this is a world-class beer that should be tried by everyone, whenever possible.","magictacosinus","Dec 21, 2013"

I get a lot of coffee and chocolate in the nose, along with some more subdued bourbon aromas and a hint of alcohol. I was blown away by all of the flavors that were going on - strong coffee and chocolate to begin, with oak and vanilla on the tail end. There is also a pretty decent alcohol bite. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Overall this was a nearly flawless beer, much as I expected it to be. I do think the alcohol bit just a bit too hard, although that's to be expected with an 11.2% beer. This one definitely delivered on the hype.","mc4z","Nov 30, 2013"

4.66,0.9,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.5,"KBS is a delicious looking beer, dark and murky with a mocha head. The nose has a massive chocolate and coffee character with lots of sweet malt and dried fruit notes. The flavor is very complex but is dominated again by chocolate and coffee. There are notes of deeply roasted malts, brown sugar, raisins and ending with a hoppy bitter finish drying the taste out. There is a nice bourbon flavor, but it does not dominate (or mask) the other flavors. KBS is pretty boozy and has some hot alcohol. The finish is very long and dominated by the bitter characteristics of the brew (bittering hops, burnt coffee).","mtomlins","Nov 19, 2013"

I feel this would be fun if it had a Huna/Abraxas/Mexi Cake treatment and had some chili's and/or cinnamon thrown in. It's a huge beer in a small bottle.

As a Kentuckian I know the best bourbon and I know good ales aged in these barrels and KBS is an absolute out of this world brew. It has everything and lacks nothing.

Aroma is coffee, but not the most pleasant coffee. Reminds me of the subpar coffee at Munster donut. Kinda stale. Taste is even worse. Stale coffee with a bit of roast and chocolate. Some might say the flavors are balanced. No the stuff is just weak. That's like complementing Budweiser on the water and piss being perfectly balanced. Mouthfeel is thin. This stuff has the body of a coked out Olsen twin. Overall, this is a subpar bourbon imperial stout. I used to think this stuff was really good. I don't know if founders has dropped off in an effort to crank out more of their most coveted annual release or if everyone else has caught up to and blown past. Either way, this stuff is highly overrated and really only serves as trade bait. Don't believe the hype.","rxeight","Sep 11, 2013"

The beer pours black-brown with a sturdy, creamy and tight beige foam head. Lots to take in on the nose. Dry coffee hits first, followed by oak chips, dark cocoa, alcohol, mild roast, a bit of tobacco and earth. Great flavor, very rich, very sweet. Lots of charred malts, brown sugar, vanilla, chocolate cake, oak and straight burnt wood, some mild earthy bitterness. Full bodied, lightly chewy with fine carbonation. Warm finish with lots of dark sugars, licorice, molasses, dark chocolate, light coffee, mocha, vanilla, chocolate syrup, light peat, burnt grass, burnt wood. Certainly lives up to the hype. It’s a robust, nicely nuanced beer with plenty of punch. I love it. A great way to commemorate this happy day.","leighton","Aug 30, 2013"

Most of the larger stouts I've had with this high of ABV lose that frothy mouthfeel and feel more like syrup without suds, but this still has it.

I think Founders absolutely nailed the blend. The bourbon flavors and aromas are present without any boozy sting. I really wish this beer was more readily available because it’s too good to only be able to get a bottle or two via trading. Maybe my luck will change in the future and I’ll be able to find more.

4.66,0.9,4,4.25,5,4.5,4.75,"2012 version. Pours black as night with a quarter finger of a dark mocha colored head that dissipates very quick and leaves an extremely thin ring of lacing. Smells of lots of roasted coffee, some bourbon, oak, vanilla, roasted malts, some dark chocolate. Taste starts with coffee, dark chocolate, some oak, and roasted malts. Then the middle brings more sweetness. Notes of molasses and carmel join the darker coffee, chocolate, and roasty notes. The finish is just fantastic. Strong, yet not overbearing notes of bourbon, vanilla, and oak come into the picture and meld with the now stronger notes of roasted coffee and dark chocolate. The bourbon, oak, and vanilla get stronger as it warms; yet it does not get hot at all. It simply makes the beer more complex and flavorful. Surprisingly thin for a beer of this magnitude. High medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Not enough good things to say about this beer. It’s smoothness makes it stand out from a lot of other barrel aged stouts. Extremely well done.","brewskis","Aug 12, 2013"

After a little aging it mellows the bourbon taste, but this is unbelievably smooth. Incredible flavor, pitch black color, wonderful aroma, this is truly a beer fit for a king. Well worth any hoops of fire and obstacles you may have to jump through to get. Words can't express how amazing this beverage is.","wpqx","Aug 11, 2013"

Thin dark chocolate coffee brown head which fizzes out quickly leaving an extremely thin layer around the inside of the glass and on top of the body; some chunky lacing left behind, I think more so now than fresh. I thought it would smooth out a bit more, creating "legs" with the bourbon, etc. Color almost black. Coffee aroma has dissipated somewhat at this point, leaving sweet and boozy chocolate with some oak. Taste is similar; less coffee, more sweet vanilla and bourbon coming through now. Sweet bourbon is prominent. Mouthfeel seems to have balanced out a bit more, both bitter and smooth now, I'd say a tad less creamy. Light carbonation. Going to let this one sit and breath for awhile. Still, it's one of my "special" beers, glad I have 5 or 6 more to enjoy in the future. Cheers.","rodlavers","Jul 07, 2013"

4.94,6.9,5,4.75,5,5,5,"2013 Vintage. Poured from a bottle into mug, the beer is jet black, and pours heavy, with no head and only the slightest dark brown ring of film around the surface. It literally poured like motor oil, and it looks delicious. Aromas of wood and earth, with a backbone of rich chocolate and touches of smoke, highlighted by booze. Flavors are robust, with a smoky, woody forward flavor followed quickly by dark, bitter baker's chocolate and rich, full, roasted coffee. Wow, this one is layered, and it is unbelievably smooth. Smoke and roast fills the senses, as well as the palate, throughout each drink. Creamy vanilla highlights, with a warming sensation from the heightened ABV. This is tremendous. Smooth, full, and creamy in mouth, with an almost velvet feel. Roast and coffee on the aftertaste, with hints of booze. Dry, roasted finish, with a smoked and woody linger. This is a fantastic brew, and I can only imagine it would age very, very well.","GarthDanielson","Jun 17, 2013"

Maybe cause I had it in June (out of season) and it's no where to be found anywhere else, I doubt it... but you never know. It was way too boozy/barell-y taste for me. I've tasted 10,11,12 percent abv that tasted like there was no alcohol. Alcohol was very prominent in this one. It was excellently balanced and good but in my opinion not top 10 worthy... in fact I tasted 5 other beers that night and KBS was the 4th best I had... Definitely try it... age it.... buy it... but don't get your hopes up.","pjkelley82","Jun 12, 2013"

It’s sweeter and creamier than the CBS, and has none of that licorice funk that I found in its sibling. It’s just an amazingly balanced, practically perfect beer.","tipfortap","May 23, 2013"

It was well worth tracking down and making the trip just for a glass. Very dark, served in a large tulip glass the aromas shifted from a hint of bourbon to chocolate. A smooth full body mouthfull. There where so many flavors coming accross that it took a long time to get through them all. It reminded me of the scene from Charlie and the Chocolate factory where the girl takes the gum and new flavors come to her as she chews. This beer was like that, every sip brought a new flavor and insight. When this gets bottled again I won't be missing out. It is well worth hunting for.","Dohtig","May 20, 2013"

A bit of chocolate and a slight vanilla note with some caramel and malt. Mouth is very roasty and sticky. A lot of coffee with a bit of bourbon. The chocolate is present again, but it's more of a bitter/dark chocolate. alcohol is well hidden on the aroma, but a little hot on the tongue. As expected, an awesome beer.","jbaker67","May 19, 2013"

4.54,-1.7,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.75,"a huge thanks to drlovemd87 for making this a reality. he is a gentleman and a classy BA. the holy grail here, it pours a chocolate brown color, dense and creamy looking, with an inch or so of espresso colored head that doesn't budge. the nose is awesomely coffee heavy. not acidic, but bright and mellow at the same time. some mild dark chocolate notes, a ton of roast, but not bitter at all. the flavor really features this coffee, somehow with a neutral ph. the ultra roasted barley gives an almost smoky flavor, while the chocolate stays in the background. I am most blown away how I taste no alcohol at all in this beer. the founders imperial is hotly alcoholic, in this beer, its totally hidden, even though its stronger. some bourbon hints with char and vanilla come through, but this beer isn't sweet at all. not teeth coating, not heavy. its remarkable how drinkable it really is. the coffee feature is as good as it gets, almost weirdly refreshing, like an iced coffee. the depth and complexity of this fine ale is second to none, and the perfection of its craftsmanship is mind boggling. I cant remember a beer so highly hyped that delivers as well as this gem does, save pliny the younger. its that good. thanks again to drlovemd87, youre a bloody legend mate!","StonedTrippin","May 11, 2013"

Beer looks real good, smells just ok (which does get better as you go), hints of chocolate, coffee, bourbon. First taste blows me away, nothing like the bottle. Big chocolate, coffee flavors mixing with a beautiful bourbon barrel in perfect harmony. Finishes dry, stout like dark fruits. Really impressive balance of flavor, thick and rich. 3 pours later I had my 24 oz bomber equivalent for $15 now thats what Im talking about. Something to chew on and contemplate this rainy, quiet, Monday afternoon. Founders you have finally impressed this Bourbon County lover.

4.61,-0.2,4,4.25,4.75,5,4.75,"The beer pours black like motor oil, black and almost sludge-like. The beer pours with a small khaki head that fizzles away to just a ring around the glass. The head leaves a lacing of thin dry velvety bubbles in root-like tendrils. The beer is properly impenetrable to the eye, like the infinite blackness of space. On the nose, the beer smells of meaty roasted coffee, creamy dark chocolate, a little touch of charred oak, and even a hint of sea salt chocolate. Bourbon is pretty weak in the nose, which is not a bad thing. What does seem to be there, from the bourbon scent is blended beneath the thick roasted coffee notes, but does show a touch of booze. On the tongue, the beer tastes smoothly sweet and then bitter with a slight savory touch, a lasting wetness from acid, and a final light burn of boozy alcohol. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet roasted coffee with touches of creamy dark chocolate, and boozy bourbon hiccups that add a sticky sweetness to the beer. A dry roasted bitter from the coffee flavors sits through the second half of the taste and into the aftertaste along with touches of tannic oak barrel. The finish is sweet with bourbon and smooth milk chocolate and the aftertaste is slightly bitter but sweet with chocolate and bourbon lingering. In the mouth, the beer feels like heaven. Thick and creamy with a carbonation of velvet softness that caresses the tongue beautifully. This is the best feeling stout that has ever sat within my mouth. It leaves the mouth slightly dry and sticky with lingering sweetness from the booze and malts. Overall this beer lives up to its hype. It feels amazing in the mouth, and carries the perfect amount of sweet bourbon and oak characters. The coffee and chocolate flavors are much more prevalent in the flavors. This beer is excellent, and by far the best bourbon stout I’ve tried to date. I only wish I could actually get a 4 pack of it in my area…","Maxwell","Apr 28, 2013"

Other then that though this beer is very good and the barrel-aging on it is almost a perfected art. I wouldn't highly suggest aging it as the coffee fades letting the bitterness from the chocolate come out. The '13 was definitely better then the '12 which had a little over a year on it, I can say what further aging would do. If you haven't had this before it's definitely worth seeking out, I just wish it was as readily available as the regular Breakfast Stout instead of a once a year release.","jaasen64","Apr 26, 2013"

This year's KBS is a lot more chocolate-forward than years past, and definitely less boozy (especially considering it was bottled only a few weeks ago). It is typical for people to age barrel-aged imperial stouts, but this one is drinking great right out of the gate! I would recommend drinking it at cellar temperature (around 50-55 degrees), and consider pairing it with a piece of plain cheesecake. Overall this was a great beer!","pmoney","Apr 19, 2013"

Poured motor oil black into an oversized wine glass with a modest creamy mocha head. Hints of mahogany when held up to the light. Scintillating aroma with a lot going on; roasty and sweet. Taste is elegantly layered, like a dark chocolate coffee cake in liquid form, revealing hints of caramel, vanilla, and oak as it warms. Muted bourbon character that isn't overpowering but comes together well with the other flavors. Incredibly balanced and nuanced. Mouthfeel is moderately thick but thinner than other big stouts. Dangerously drinkable, luxuriously smooth, and not as hot as you would expect for the ABV. Definitely one to sip and savor. A real treat.

4.99,8,4.75,5,5,5,5,"Overall: This is definitely one of the best beers I'll ever drink. Upon tasting the original breakfast stout, there was no doubt in my mind that KBS could and would top FBS. I hold both on a pedestal and I love the fact that there are big differences between the two. I believe Founders did a great job making KBS and FBS stand by themselves. It would've been quite easy for Founders to just throw FBS in bourbon barrels but they didn't. I'm glad they did because it would've been quite easy to view FBS as the base beer of KBS, but since Founders brews a completely different stout for KBS it allows us to appreciate both for what they are. Barrel aging and adding coffee to their beers are what Founders does best and KBS is a prime example of this. This is a top 5 beer, but it might be my personal all-time favorite.","RichD","Apr 05, 2013"

It taste like bourbon spiked cold coffee. And I don't like coffee. Don't take this wrong I know coffee notes are part of having a stout but usually chocolate is too and didn't get that anywhere in this beer. If ever have again it would be one and done, then go onto another beer. Sorry but this beer is overrated, Or maybe not just to my liking.","Damian74Shensky","Apr 04, 2013"

You can tell that this isn't just a bourbon aged stout with coffee added, it was made with those flavors in mind, producing an extremely well-balanced beer that retains the complexity through every last drop. I was worried that I was too hyped for this beer, but it proved itself worth of the rarity and praise it gets. One of, if not the best beer I've ever had.","Brewasaurus","Apr 04, 2013"

No. It will be interesting to age for 6 mo or so to let the coffee subside just a little bit. It was definitely more prominent than my pallet is accustomed to, not going to say this is a bad thing, just different. I had 2011 BCBS coffee around Christmas time and I would prefer KBS over that, I have not had fresh BCBS coffee though. Makes me want to bust out my 2012 now for a comparison. This was well worth the effort to seek out. glad i have 5 more bottles to savor!","withoutfailbrewmaster","Apr 04, 2013"

After about an hour the beer reached a temperature which allowed all the oaky, vanilla, bourbon nuances to emerge. The flavors also seemed to blend and harmonize. This brought the taste and overall score up for me and I recommend this sampling technique. Overall, every bit as good as breakfast stout with a little more flavor that tackles a slightly different style and both can be thoroughly enjoyed depending on the mood of the drinker","bnes09","Apr 03, 2013"

Earthy with hints of vanilla. The taste is bourbon upfront followed by coffee and the chocolate. Fairly hot. Vanilla near the end with a mix of coffee and more bourbon. Dark chocolate aftertaste. Surprisingly drinkable. The bourbon presence is fantastic. Heavy mouthfeel. This one was a pain to get a hold of but I'm glad I finally landed one. I'd say Goose Island Bourbon County and the recent batch of NebCo Bourbon Barrel Aged Stout Trooper are better than KBS.

Great lacing on the side of the glass, Smell is mostly coffee and chocolate, but with notes of bourbon as well. Taste is remarkable, starts with a heavy burst of coffee and then follows with bourbon flavors, but it all fades quickly, leaving virtually no aftertaste. This really helps the mouthfeel - this is a full bodied beer but it feels light on the tongue.

Smells great. But the real judge is on the tongue where KBS really shines. The barrel and the base beer are in absolutely perfect harmony, letting enough of the bourbon barrel shine through to flawlessly compliment the notes of the stout. Everything works in lockstep all the way from the strong vanilla-bourbon start to the roasty, oaky and slightly boozy finish. The mouthfeel is rich and velvety, with just the slightest tickle of carbonation, and the drinkability is exceptional. Overall, a superb barrel aged stout that is masterfully aged and blended.

First sweet chocolate, which hit hard. Next, bourbon (and a lot of it). Finally, dark coffee and a little black malt. Phenomenal nose. Flavor is rich, complicated, and smooth. The attack is sweet and bourbony. Almost no heat, but I know there is plenty of alcohol hiding. There is a huge coffee flavor and a little bit of vanilla. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, medium-low carbonation, and extremely creamy. I wish there was a little more bourbon, a thicker mouthfeel, and a little stronger head/retention.","lunarbrew","Mar 11, 2013"

Also, the aroma was very intriguing, that kinda did not come through on the palate. I find BCBS a touch more complex overall.

Super thick, jet black pour with one finger caramel colored head that fades pretty quick but with excellent lacing. The nose is simply amazing! One of the greatest smelling beers of all times. Dominated by the bourbon, but not far behind are the roasty coffee, chocolate, and oak along with hints of vanilla and booze. The taste is just as stellar. Perfectly balanced with the bourbon, coffee, oak, and chocolate once again the stars. Hints of toffee, vanilla, and dark fruit round it out nicely. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy and smooth as silk with a wonderful subtle, warming alcohol burn on the finish. The influence from the barrels is absolutely amazing. Huge woody character much like I get when drinking a good oak aged wine. Overall, this is as close to perfection as you can get for the style. And it's consistently spot on every year. Truly world class from the best brewery in the world!","beerdrifter","Feb 03, 2013"

5,8.2,5,5,5,5,5,"Honestly, I think I appreciate this beer more as I've tried so many others. I feel that all the other bourbon stouts hit you with tons of bourbon taste upfront. And what separates this from the others is that somehow Founders creates a very even taste all the way through. When drinking the other top bourbon stouts it seems like it all hits you at once rather than creating a unique balanced flavor. There may not be a wide variety of flavors here, but the ones that are here are so craft-fully blended and there really isn't another beer I've tried that can accomplish this. World class, and this is the reigning champion of the beer world as far as I'm concerned. If you really separate yourself from the hype and concentrate on the beer, I defy anyone to find a bourbon beer as well balanced as this. It's worth the drive to Michigan for the release every year.","sjones5045","Dec 31, 2012"

I have some 2010 and 2011 in the cellar, but I wanted to see how a 2012 would do 9months after bottling. And what do you know, it's amazing. Just the perfect amount of bourbon gives way to dark chocolate notes, followed by notes of oak, vanilla and toffee. Such a smooth velvety mouthfeel. Just wow. I love every bottle of this beer I drink.","madtrixter787","Nov 13, 2012"

4.95,7.1,5,5,5,4.5,5,"T: Where can I start. Fresh, it's got a huge bourbon blast at the start. If you like the bourbon portion of BA beers, then enjoy this fresh. Bourbon is complimented nice with the traditional cocoa and coffee flavors so familiar in traditional Breakfast Stout. Aging it will produce probably the best flavor I've experienced in a beer. There are so many things to compare it to. At six months, I've used the words milkshake, chocolate milk, Jamocha Shake from Arby's, etc. It's such a wonderfully balanced ale at that point even though the bourbon has dissipated slightly and still packs the whopping ABV punch.","kylelenk","Oct 25, 2012"

4.57,-1.1,4,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,"O - 4.5 - This is a mature beer, and no pun intended. It's a grown-up stout that doesn't lean heavily on syrupy sweetness. A number of the big stouts are like drinking pudding, which I like a lot, but which can make them seem more like rare, special occasion beers. And sometimes they really make you work, making you go slow lest you be punished with too much intensity. This one is robust and rich yet with a drinkable body. You still want to sip it because of how well it is made, but its body and balance put it more in the category of normal beer that you'd like to have anytime, not just when clearing out the schedule for a special occasion, even though it's definitely special. One of the top 5 beers I've had to date. 2013 tasting - Very nice, very enjoyable, very mature, very distinct, very memorable. It's one of the top beers for good reasons. The coffee fades over time and it seems to come across thicker with more age. Still one of the best and most memorable.","BrownNut","Oct 16, 2012"

The flavor is not as big as the nose, but it is just a beautifully well rounded beer that touches nicely on the vanilla oak bourbon and chocolate before going to all coffee on the finish. Really enjoyed this, though it wasn't a top 10 or so beer I've ever had. Still that is a silly standard to hold this too, and I really enjoy this one.","Tschnab","Sep 20, 2012"

Super creamy and smooth and the drinkability is insane for such a big beer. The only beer I've ever had better than this is CBS, which just had better lacing and legs and a slightly more complex flavor with the maple. Any stout fan should make it a point to seek out this beer, it's THAT good. If you get your hands on this, drink it fresh. The flavors are slightly sharper and even better. I will have to add an aged review at some point as well.","Dope","Aug 16, 2012"

Taste is incredible and quite strong, definitely one you need to take slow. You can taste coffee, chocolate, at first - then malt and bourbon, especially in the aftertaste. The flavor profile has several evolutions in your mouth and the mouthfeel is thick and balanced. Its a little less sweet than their Breakfast stout, though more complex. It was pricey, though i'm very glad I got it, this is one of the last bottles in MI. One of my all time favorites, can't wait for next years batch.","srv33","Jun 29, 2012"

Pours a pitch black motor oil thickness, brown tan head that bubbles up like a tarpit from the glass. Beautiful. A tan ring settles around the circumference of the glass. Smell- amazing. Sweet molasses, caramel, honey, chocolate. Just absolutely decadent. Maybe a little bit of cinnamon. Taste- buttery caramel, molasses, spicy tobacco reminds me of Red Man from my HS baseball days. Sweet bourbon, espresso roast finishes the end. Wow. This is absolutely mind boggling good. This is so smooth, the bourbon flavor is absolutely present, but this shows no booze at all. I'm glad to have had the chance to taste this (thanks Eric!), and will seek it out again. World class, lives up to the hype. This is a home run, a perfect 5.0.","lnashsig","Jun 13, 2012"

The alcohol is no slouch here, a heavy hand helping that compliments the thick viscose stout nature. Burbon and burnt chocolate works well together delivering a blast of bitterness to the taste buds. One bottle is memoriable, fulfilling, and worthy the wait.","beerthulhu","May 30, 2012"

Smell is just incredible here, the bourbon takes center stage, but it's mixes fantastically with oak, coffee and chocolate to make an amazing aroma. Bourbon, oak and vanilla really stand out in the flavor here with the coffee really taking a back seat (especially compared to the original). It's got a nice chocolate-y finish and is extremely smooth. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, I've actually always felt this beer was a little overrated, but this particular bottle that I'm reviewing is excellent (maybe it's always been excellent?). It's a little more bourbon-forward than I remember, and I wonder if that's a product of drinking the original next to it.

4.62,0,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled 2/17/2012. Re-rate from last year. Pours thick pitch black color with a small 1 finger fairly dense tan head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some slight spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla, molasses, toffee, espresso, roasted malt, bourbon, and oak. Fantastic aromas here with great balance and good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, caramel, molasses, vanilla, toffee, espresso, bourbon, roasted malt, oak, biscuit, and slight herbal hops. Almost no bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, molasses, oak, and roasted malt on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance, without the bourbon being too overpowering; and no cloying sweetness at all. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with an insanely creamy, slick, lush, and super smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol is extremely well hidden at 11.2% with only a slight warming after the finish noticed. Extremely easy to drink, but is still a sipper. Overall this is definitely a world class barrel aged imperial stout. Big balanced and robust flavors; with an incredibly smooth and lush mouthfeel. This is definitely at it’s best when fresh.","superspak","Apr 14, 2012"

Flavor profile similar between the two. Huge chocolate/nibs. Smell the coffee in both but just picking up a bit of iced coffee in the aftertaste (and my burps). Nice bourbon layer in both, much smoother in the '09. Both go down well, the '09 is much mellower and doesn't carry the slight bitterness of the '12. The '12 is a little alcoholic, the '09 went down sooo smooth, almost too easy. The aging flexes itself nicely. Of course they are both fantastic but a little aging does benefit the style very well.

At a year old its lost most of the coffee flavor but has retained that coffee bean bitterness. Seems like its at an awkward phase in its life. At two years old all the coffee has left the building as well as that awkward bean bitterness. Its become a delicious sweet chocolate stout with bourbon notes. Similar to BCBS but with a lighter body. Two years seems to be the sweet spot for this beer aged. I don't think I would go through the trouble of aging it though as it seems to defeat the purpose of a Kentucky breakfast stout.","davey101","Mar 20, 2012"

If it were slightly lower in alcohol content there would be less burn and the sweetness would come through more however, this is true to the style with the alcohol warmth and the strong roasted malt and coffee flavors. There really is no one flavor that overpowers the others. This is just as good as everyone says, absolutely worth a try if you're lucky enough to get some.","adman08","Mar 16, 2012"

The CBS was still a bit boozy for my tastes, but he KBS fit my bill a bit better. It looked like a solid imperial stout, with a very dark, almost black body with a thin dark tan head. It smelled of bourbon, vanilla, roasted malts. All in good portions. The taste was great, but I missed the maple that CBS had. There must be some perfect middle ground for the smoothness of KBS, and the sweet notes of CBS. Maybe my perfect Founder's beer is the yet to be released Curmudgeon's Better Half. I am very interested in picking up some bottles of this and seeing how it ages. Overall, kudos to Michigan, Founder's, and the bourbon barrel, who without this beer would never be possible.","unclejazz","Jan 18, 2012"

I sample CBS a few nights ago for the first time and I can say I enjoyed it more because the sweetness helped to balance the coffee bitterness that I found to be slightly (slightly) too much for my tastes here.

Espresso, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, and cigar smoke is what I get in the nose. Super smooth (probably due to age), and simply perfect. I wouldn't change a thing. The taste is out of this world! Bourbon, vanilla, bourbon barrels, coffee, cigar smoke and chocolate is what I get. This beer is really complex, and just a pure dream to sip on. I don't get any of the alcohol either, other than a tiny bit on the aftertaste. Feel is perfect. Full bodied, and so smooth you can't believe it. Great balance of dryness/maltyness. Overall, this is as good as it gets for the style. Thanks, Matt for the opportunity to share this! Cheers.","jayhawk73","Dec 12, 2011"

First taste is heaven – with bourbon and dark chocolate and a big splash of strong coffee all blending to make one of the finest beers ever. Thin bodied but well carbonated. The excellent carbonation makes up for the thin body to combine for an overall great mouthfeel. The 11.3% ABV is well hidden. What a great beer!","ATLbeerDog","Dec 03, 2011"

The roastiness and the mouthfeel are inarguably top notch, but they are in a distance second...and that faint dustiness in the aroma is offputting. I would consider this a hybrid of an imp stout and a scotch ale. I'm not trying to be a hater, cause I LOVE Founders, but this is just slightly better than Backwoods if you ask me.","kbuzz","Nov 23, 2011"

4.52,-2.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.75,"The hype around this beer is pretty well justified. As it comes to room temperature more complexities emerge, with a warming bourbon kiss on the finish that's quite nice and doesn't overpower the other flavor characteristics of this beer.","tobelerone","Nov 12, 2011"
4.25,-8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Appearance is opaque black with a nice lacing of tan head. Aroma is immediately bourbon followed by vanilla and caramel. Taste is of caramel, bourbon and mocha.

4.09,-11.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"12 oz bottle courtesy of myspoonistoobig. Thanks Michael. Pour a black that is cola brown at the edges when held up to the light. A small light tan head disappears pretty quickly and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma chocolate, coffee, some roast, bourbon, and some light char. The coffee is still pretty strong. The initial taste is sweet chocolate, followed by coffee, some light oak, bourbon, and a little bit of char. The finish has a decent bitterness to it and leaves some lingering coffee flavors. Medium body. Relatively low carbonation. This is a very good beer, but there are several barrel aged imperial stouts that I enjoy more.","jethrodium","Nov 08, 2011"
4.94,6.9,4,5,5,5,5,"This might be the best stout I have ever tasted. The beer pours black, with a short lived mocha head that leaves a little lacing. The smell is vanilla, bourbon, coffee, chocolate and cream. The taste is similar to the nose, but with the wood from the barrels shining through.The mouthfeel is full and rich, with just enough carbonation to give it lift. Overall, a stellar example of a bourbon barrel aged stout.","sacrelicio","Nov 08, 2011"

3.4,-26.4,4,4,3,3,3.5,"D/O: The barrel treatment is a process that is all about refinement, where value is added to a product. Amongst barrel-aged stouts, KBS is a relative bargain even after emerging from the oak, but its qualities appear amateurish at times, compared to its contemporaries. Flavors find themselves mostly at odds with each other early, but become passably simpatico during the latter two acts. Challenging textures in the mouth do not help, yet there is still something appealing about it--compared to bourbon it is basically the same taste, but easier to tolerate for the non-spirit drinker. I can appreciate why this profile would appeal to so many, and it does qualify for an extreme candidate of the sub-style.","beagle75","Oct 30, 2011"

4.5,-2.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O) I have not consumed many barrel aged brews, but I found his to be quite enjoyable. I can understand now, why this is such a sought after beer. I've had folks tell me the alcohol is hardly detectable in KBS, however I would disagree. I found it quite detectable, but not in a negative way. Again, this may be my own inexperience with barrel aged stouts. In the end, this is a pretty complex brew, that is well put together, and a pleasure to drink. After one bottle down the old hatch, I'm feeling pretty good, and pretty relaxed. Looking forward to cracking one of those bottles of CBS. Thanks Founders...","RoamingGnome","Oct 19, 2011"

4.1,-11.3,3.75,4.25,4.25,3.5,4,"Very nearly black with a quickly dissipating head, minuscule lacing. Wonderfully dark, dense and gentle, not blatantly upfront about any of its 11%. The wood, vanilla and coffee are all here, well-balanced and mutually coalesced. Yes, the appearance and mouthfeel may be somewhat lacking - both are, ultimately, perfectly reasonable, just spartan and slack - but the taste makes this a non-issue. It is well-rounded, extremely drinkable and elegantly indicative of its various components. An almost ideal Imperial Stout.","QuentinCall","Oct 11, 2011"

4.79,3.7,3.5,4.5,5,5,5,"I love this beer so much I can't stop drinking the homebrew clone that tastes exactly like it. It's so well balanced, it is well worth the hype. The bourbon aroma and notes add such a great complexity, but are so well hidden that the ABV is quite surprising to be so high. Can't imagine how good this would be if you let it sit for 6 months or so. The body is nice and thin which pairs well with the taste. This is worth the effort to find a bottle even though it's becoming near impossible.","southside","Oct 03, 2011"

Big bourbon, wood, coffee, chocolate, vanilla and roasted malt on the aroma. Same on the taste with lots of bourbon coming at the end. Lots of chocolate and coffee are the focus but the wood aging adds nice layers of complexity.

I also get some chocolate, tobacco, ash, and dried fruits. Complex aroma really, but heavy coffee. Taste hits with roast then chocolate, and then comes the coffee on the attack. Finish with some vanilla, and some bourbon that is oh so subtle. Awesome complexity!! Creamy full bodied mouthfeel. Excellent brew, I wish it was more available!

The smell upfront is bourbon whiskey and butterscotch with coffee, and sweet creme hints. Smells rich with dark chocolate aromas. Tastes bourbony too! Also, lots of coffee and chocolate flavors. Light vanilla flavor but I didn't get much oak. Espresso! At times the sweetness is a bit much. Tastes rich like a fudge brownie. Feel is fairly viscous. This is great!","kbnooshay","Aug 31, 2011"

5,8.2,5,5,5,5,5,"This was a beer that I was very excited to finally get to enjoy! It was dark and full of complexion. But not overly powerful as some stouts can become if not aged appropriately.

Either way, I completely enjoyed this beer. It's fantastic, complex, and just one of those beers that everyone should try.

Everything about this beer is absolutely stunning, from the initial kick of the bourbon in the tastes balanced perfectly by the coffee, chocolate milk, vanilla, and woody flavours to the amazing smells right down to the feel of it on the palate. This is a world class beer for a reason, all other stouts take notes because this is what you should taste like, and hides the big ABV extremely well.

It pours oily black with minimal tan lacing. No head, really, but none is expected. The first pour stirs up fresh coffee beans and toasty-smoky malts. It is very inviting. Later on, aromas of chocolate and dark fruits emerge. Finally, I start to smell the vanilla. I am encouraged to dive into this beer. But...I am amazed at the disconnect to the taste. There is a bitter sourness that permeates each drink, like I am licking an oak cube. There is a mysterious bitterness that keeps butting in. I keep looking for flavors in the glass and end up furrowing my eyebrows in disappointment. A hot alcohol burn ends up carrying the day. It reminds me of 100 proof cherry brandy. Think of chocolate covered cherries with a grain alcohol center and you get what I'm tasting. Yeah, I like chocolate, and I like cherries, but c'mon, this is too much. Maybe some time in the cellar will do this some good.","dnrobert24","Aug 03, 2011"

Taste starts out with sweet roasted malt accentuated by notes of chocolate, coffee and vanilla. A very nice bourbon presence asserts itself in the finish, warming things up a bit. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous with an excellently low level of carbonation which lends a smooth, creamy quality to the beer. This is one of my very favorite barrel aged stouts. The different aspects of the beer are melded together with such skill that the advertised 11.2% ABV is completely hidden.

The small head is dark leather brown and dissipates quickly into a small ringlet. The aroma is honestly comprised of mostly a big dose of fresh roasted coffee. Underneath this is a small helping of nice bourbon and oak characteristics including a lot of vanilla and a touch of wood. The sweet aroma of whiskey touches through but not much. A drink taken in while inhaling starts quite sweet and flows into wood and vanilla mixed with a touch of citrus. The mid is all added coffee and this is definitely what lingers with undertones of very dark chocolate. As it warms the chocolate comes out more and more. There is a nice carbonation that mingles perfectly with the silky mouthfeel. This is honestly good but I was expecting more bourbon stout and less breakfast stout.","drowland","Jul 25, 2011"

The deep black nights where the bayou water looked like shimmering oil, ignited by the moonlight. I mean sure, she liked all that just fine, but what she really aspired to do, I mean, someday of course, Claire wanted to take over the family Chocolate Milk dairy. She grew tired of harvesting coffee beans all day with all the youngins, she had that dark capitalism spirit and she wanted in on that chocolate empire. Sometimes at night she’d sneak into the old cocoa refined and push her slender arm deep into the 70% dark chocolate and feel a secret power in its stickiness.

I will say though that if you're looking for not just a perfectly executed version of a classic bourbon barrel aged stout and instead are looking to be surprised with new and bold flavors, that KBS might disappoint you. Besides the balance, blend, and excellent execution, I'd argue there's little here that's very original or new to an experienced stout drinker. Anyway, my hat goes off to founders for this one.

I have always been a big fan of barrel aged beer, but this one takes barrel aging to a new level, I really love how all the subtle flavors of the bourbon came through and they blended with the base breakfast stout nicely. This beer isn't that drinkable, it makes for a nice smooth sipper, but if I had another one it would be hard for me not to drink it. I liked everything about this beer, everything seemed spot on and balanced very well. There is tons of hype surrounding this beer and it lives up to it gracefully, I see why so many people drop what they are doing and rush to the stores to get some before it is all sold out, it's just that damn good. A little part of me was hoping I wouldn't like this beer that much so I wouldn't have to go through the madness each year to get it, but since I like it so damn much, I guess I am just going to have tough it out and scour my city for any available bottle I can find next year, damn you Founders, this must be all part of your master plan. This is a must have for any true beer lover, it's not just a beer it's an experience. This has to be the best beer I have had from Founders and now it has a place as my favorite barrel aged stout to date. I can't say enough good things about Founders, and with beers like this, you don't have to, you just let someone take a sip and watch the smile form on their face. I couldn't think of a better beer to celebrate 200 reviews with, heres to 200 more. 2014 Edit i aged one for a year and I found out what I already knew this beer is best fresh, but still good when aged.","StoutHunter","Jun 05, 2011"

4.45,-3.7,5,5,4,4.5,4.5,"It pours beautifully with a short dense light brown head. It holds onto a nice little film of foam which leaves lacing down the side of the glass. Really exceptional aroma. Huge coffee notes, with mild mocha chocolate and light bourbon in the background. The taste is the same, with a mild pleasant alcohol burn. It is chocolate, coffee, creamy, and a very small dash of bourbon to add character. As a matter of fact, I was expecting a bit more of the bourbon -bal or oak in here, as i thought a touch more vanilla would be really nice with the other flavors. As such, it is extraordinarily balanced. The mouthfeel is creamy and full bodied. Really happy with founders on this beer. Delicious beer.","Agold","May 28, 2011"

4.79,3.7,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"The most impressive thing about this beer was how the complex flavors blended and complimented each other. The deep robust coffee lended a bitterness against a sweet caramel and bourbon smoothness. Nothing overpowered or dominated. Great chocolate undertones and smokey, woody notes finished it into a superb and mellow drink. It was creamy and full bodied. This is a beer to be sipped and savored.

Rings of lace down the glass, not a lot of pattern, but good cling where it settles. Color is a 40 on the SRM beer color chart. Black as coal, even in a shot glass it is black. Smell is very intense, aromas of coffee, raisins, caramel, semi sweet chocolate, and plums. Taste is rich and complex, with flavors of roasted coffee, dark chocolate, dates, raisins, plums, caramel, oak aging, and lemon zest. Warning, the demon alcohol, which is masked by the wonder flavors, comes like a thief in the night and hits you the side of the head...wow. Mouthfeel is velvet cream, moderate zing, and a slight dry feeling in my soft palate. A touch of maple syrup aftertaste lingers in the back of my hard palate. Not for chain drinking, although I would like the flavor to go on for a month. Breakfast, well maybe with waffles covered with chocolate syrup. A wonderful treat anyway you look at it.","beerprovedwright","May 23, 2011"

I've been getting into single malts and small batch bourbons/whiskeys. Barrel aged beers tend to be too reminiscent of sweeter low quality whiskeys. I was attracted to this beer for the time and care listed in it's preparation. I would try it again, but am glad I only got a bottle for now at $6/bottle in NYC.

Instead I was met with a very strong flavored and bold beer that did not quite pull it all together as I hoped it would. I feel like it will do great with some age. Dont get me wrong, I enjoyed the beer, but given all the other factors it did not leave me one hundred percent satisfied. Not worth the insane hype around it.

Aroma is coffee malt and light bourbon. I thought coffee fades out of beers quickly, I guess the coffee in KBS doesn't follow the rules.

I'm a sucker for a great bourbon barrel aged stout, and this one is king. Mouth watering in taste and smell, and very complex. Now, having said all of that, this year's release seemed a little different than past iterations. The mouthfeel seems a bit thinner than I remember, and the bourbon flavors were a bit more dominant, though I didn't feel that they ever became too hot.

As i made my way through the glass the chocolate notes jumped out more and by the time i was at the end of the glass the bourbon flavor was stronger on my pallet than at the beginning.

Mouthfeel is a tad thin, just chewy enough without going overboard, not so thin as to allow the bourbon and alcohol flavors to be too brash; drinkability is good, I can already feel the latent alcohol burn and I'm a quarter way through the glass.

Chocolate chip cookie dough, sweetened coffee, cinnamon, with a whiff of the oak bourbon barrels. Taste is extremely rich and decadent. Cocoa powder, cookie dough, sweetened coffee with creamer, cinnamon, vanilla, coconut, with the woody bourbon taste coming through on the finish. Mouthfeel is very thick and creamy on this one. Mild alcohol burn in the throat after each sip. I have been wanting to try this one for a long, long time and the hype and all the good things I have heard and read about this beer are all warranted. This is an exceptional beer and it's no wonder this one is super hard to find.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 20, 2011"
4.3,-6.9,4,4,4.5,5,4,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how creamy, frothy, and oily the mouthfeel was. The brew pours as I would imagine a glassful of the chocolate waterfall from “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” would pour. While the bourbon wasn’t starkly present throughout, as the beer warms it becomes very boozy, and by the end, was a bit much. All in all, the feel alone was enough to bring this into the “great” category.","TheBrewo","Apr 20, 2011"

Taste is robust and complex; not an overwhelming amount of bourbon taste thankfully, but still enough presence to dominate. Bitter and dark coffee flavours are heavy and delicious. Mouthfeel is heavy, leaves a dry sensation. Overall, unsurprisingly, Founder's really hits it out of the ballpark with the KBS. It's what a bourbon-barrel aged stout ought to be. A wonderful world-class beer from a favourite brewery. Must-try.","heebes","Apr 20, 2011"

Fiddler's Hearth on Main St. in South Bend also has a keg of this every year shortly after its official release. This is a really great beer, aged in bourbon barrels for an entire year before it is released.

Taste is breakfast stout kicked up a notch with a strong hit of bourbon laced oak and caramel, sweet corn, oak vanillin, chocolate espresso bean, finishes with a drying bourbon finish. Very drinkable but you can tell the abv is up there but remains balanced with a nice carbonation level insuring thats its not cloying.

4.97,7.6,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Simply put, this is one of the best beers I have ever tasted. I was able to snag a bottle, and I'm very glad that I did. It doesn't pour like your average stout, perhaps a little thinner. Aroma is big on vanilla and bourbon, and the taste is balanced by the dark malts and hops. Mouthfeel is super-silky and stays with you for a while. KBS is definitely a beer to cherish and savor. I only wish it was more available, as it took an act of god to secure one bottle.","danieljohn629","Apr 13, 2011"

Nice mocha colored head. Aroma is boozy warm and inviting. Smells of vanilla, coffee, and bourbon goodness. This is the best balanced boubon aged beer I have tried. The booze is nice an mellow and sweet, and compliments the malty coffee flavors very well! Its like the best alchoholic coffee drink you have ever had.

An epic concoction with copious amounts of malt. A no holds barred concoction that I would liken to a bag of dark chocolate, thrown into a bag of coffee, thrown into a bourbon barrel- but that would be only the beginning.

The nose is a lot milder than I would have expected but it's still an attractive one with light notes of coffee bean, cocoa, and vanilla cream. A smooth and creamy malt mouthfeel with a mild and crisp carbonation delivers into a deep and earthy fudge chocolate ice cream noted finish. Caramel also lightly echoes on the palate. As I neared the end of my third and final glass, I also sensed the warming quality reminiscent of a whiskey drink or a cool sipping rum. These were going down so smoothly with such a cleverly hidden abv that I could have had a couple more...Very nice brew and I can't wait to cross paths again soon...","albertjr21","Apr 03, 2011"

Smells strongly of oak and bourbon, chocolate, some vanilla, some coffee and a bit of alcohol. Taste is mostly oak and bourbon, some chocolate and coffee, roasted malts, light alcohol, very little hop presence, an unfortunate old cardboard taste in there as well. Harsh oak in the finish. Mouthfeel is very watery for the style with a low carbonation. I know people love this beer, but i think it is average at best and would prefer many other stouts, especially at the price.","nkersten","Apr 01, 2011"

The taste also improved as it warmed up. The first taste was upfront coffee and roasted grains with a alcohol finish. As the beer warmed up the alcohol disappeared and was replaced with a nice coffee molasses finish. Not as sweet as I expected but overall excellent. Deep dark burbon and coffee. As good as it gets.","Kbogac","Mar 31, 2011"

It reminds me of really strong coffee that has some grounds that snuck out of the filter into the pot. I'd like to see more of the bourbon flavor which is fairly understated in this brew. Tasty, and fairly dry for the style standard. Not my favorite bourbon barreled stout though.","SFLpunk","Mar 30, 2011"
4.37,-5.4,3.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"poured into a 25 oz snifter. typical black with chocolate milk colored head disappears rather quickly. smells like cocoa and booze. seems like the alcohol is present right from the getgo. It's pleasant, but I didn't expect my nostrils to flare like that. the taste is a lot smoother than I expected from the smell very tasty. less coffee than a FBS, this one has more of a chocolate taste to it. Hints of vanilla start to show as I get toward the end of the glass, along with the bourbon I felt was missing in my first few sips. It's understood that FBS is not the base beer, but want to note it tastes more like a barrel-aged FIS. Definitely weaker on the bourbon, which some may think is lacking, but for me this is better. Mouthfeel is chewy and thick. very nice, and slightly creamy. Drinkability is incredible given the ABV, it's very nice and smooth and just an awesome drink. I had previously reviewed this one with about 9 months on it, but after having it a few more times and finally getting it fresh, I'm letting this review stand as this is what it should probably taste like.","Blanco","Mar 30, 2011"

4.82,4.3,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"D- 4.5 One thing I love about this complex, beautifully crafted stout ale is that it really isn't that complex to decipher. All of its flavors are pronounced in their respective ways as it is balanced perfectly. It is definitely high in volume and flavor... And unfortunately, price. At $23.99 / 4-pack, it lost some of its "drinkability" for me before I was able to snag it off the shelf (or should I say from the employee who brought it out to me from the back room of the last store in town to have it stocked). Honestly, it is just so limited, so expensive, and so powerful that I couldn't see myself drinking more than one (maybe two on a special night). I'd rather hoard it! I'm wishing now that I would have saved one from last year to compare it with vertically... I'll be sure to do that for the 2012 batch! Excellent beer.","KYBrewgrass","Mar 25, 2011"
4.88,5.6,5,4.5,5,5,5,"Overall: You know this is a big beer. Costs a ton, aged a year, and as Van Halen says "everybody wants some.", and after this first tasting session I know why. It's statement of the obvious to say this brew has a huge personality. There's a a ton flavors that float around in the background...vanilla, oak, cocoa, oatmeal...go on and on. The sweetness doesn't seem to be malt, but from any of dozens of dark fruits and brown sugar variations. It's presence in the mouth is almost 3D, creamy and oily. And if you like the taste of whiskey fire, buddy this is your beer. Some might argue it's not the best brew in America, I think it's in the running. And, it shows the strength of the mid-west's dominace of the american whiskey(bourbon) barrel aged brews.","2BDChicago","Mar 24, 2011"
4.8,3.9,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"So glad that I found this beer. Not much to say for the head or for lacing but the full body flavor makes up for it. Deep dark color has a nice creamy ring around the top but not much else. Alcohol smell is a little noticeable in the nose but not to an extreme. Roasted Malts and vanilla show through on this one. Great stout And I would recommend this to anyone.","Rhynes2","Mar 24, 2011"
4.7,1.7,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: Great beer. The heat is acceptable for an 11+% stout. Could I drink this every day? No, but this is a fantastic beer to go to on a cold spring day.","Alexmc2","Mar 24, 2011"
4.97,7.6,4.5,5,5,5,5,"In the end, I thought the 2011 would be far superior, but it's very close. Trying to pick a favorite is like trying to pick a favorite child. I think the fresh bottle has the slightest upper hand in the aroma, though I think I prefer the 2010 by just a hair in the flavor department for allowing more of the dark chocolate flavors to shine through. Regardless, I would take either vintage over any other imperial stout I've had any day of the week. I cannot say enough good about this beer--it truly is my favorite beer and I am someone who generally has difficulty listing my favorite of anything. Absolutely phenomenal.","n2185","Mar 24, 2011"

Probably the most perfectly balanced bourbon barrel aged stout. When I first tried a BCBS, I thought it we be perfect if the heat was turned down (in a year old bottle), the bourbon was less boozy and overpowering, and with a little more depth/complexity.

Coffee, chocolate, and slight bitterness toward the end of the sip, which I am guessing could be from the bourbon barrel aging. I didn't expect the bourbon barrel aging to be so subtle. I am usually not the biggest fan of ba's, but this one doesn't even remind me of one because its so balanced. Good carbonation and medium to heavy body. I would drink more than one, but they are so limited, I am lucky just to have this bottle. Overall, I'm glad I got the chance to finally try this one, especially on St. Patty's day.

Filled the glass black with a slight hint of brown around the edges and a thin head that left some very nice lacing. Smells of heavy roasting, smokey, woody, coffee, chocolate and booze. First taste was bitter heavily roasted coffee and soon the flavor of the wood started to come through along with the bourbon. Despite my wife's disapproval I am a swisher. Every few sips I like swishing around and with this beer I got some tingling on the gums but going back to first impressions I thought it was a little thin for a stout but still very good overall...

The taste is second to none, bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, oak, with a cohesive coffee flavor pulling everything together. The booze is apparent but melds well with the other flavors and definitely adds to the enjoyment of this beer rather the detracting from it.

Chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, booze, this is a really good tasting barrel aged imperial stout. The mouthfeel is medium with reasonable carbonation. Not as heavy as some imperial stouts, but in a good way I'd say. Drinkability is quite high for an 11% barrel aged beer.

Nevertheless, it's a welcome change; the roasted coffee flavors are blended exceptionally well with the sweeter elements and the delicious, almost subversive flavors of bourbon. Drinkability suffers a bit because of the bitterness and booziness, but it's not supposed to be guzzled, it's supposed to be sipped and savored. The Abyss still takes first place in my book, but this beer puts up an honorable fight. I'd buy it frequently if it were readily available, as it fills a niche that other stouts don't.

It smells of Dark malts, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, oak, and coffee. Tastes awesome. Coffee and chocolate, with the bourbon taste coming through well. There is also a nice sweetness to this beer that seems to stay in your mouth for a while. The mouthfeel is great for this type of beer. Very heavy body with low carbonation. Coats the mouth very well and really lets you taste the beer very well. The drinkability is very good with this beer even though it is definitely a slow sipper. It took me a long time to finish my glass of this, I had a great time doing it though. I really loved this beer and I think founders did a great job making it.

The pour was black with a multi toned tan to dark brown head that falls to a thin line of foam with large legs and some irregular lacing. The smell is awesome complex, coffee, boozy overtones and a bit of roasted malt and sweet hints of some malt somewhere out in the beer. i found the taste to be complex (understatement) and strong. I taste a hint of chocolate at the front of my tongue. I then am smashed with the collage of coffee, booze, and roasted malt flavors. i also tasted a hint of metal flavor from the extreme amount of strong coffee flavors. The mouthfeel is exceptional and that is all I am going to say about this. I have one more from this year in my cellar so it will remain fro another 6 months to a year.

The alcohol is fairly strong. Slightly malty with a hint of coffee and chocolate. There's definitely a lot to this beer I don't know how to describe. Kind of a burnt caramel maybe with some vanilla undertones. I quite like it and this beer seems to improve with every drink. What a fantastic brew!

4.65,0.6,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The KBS pours an absences of light topped with a nice sandy brown finger of foam. The aroma is most notably similar to well aged bourbon whiskey. The main difference is there is a wonderful bouquet of coffee, chocolate, bourbon, oak, vanilla and smoked malts that create a splendid melange of aromas for the nose. The taste is quite similar. There are the distinct flavors of a really good mocha coffee and bourbon whiskey to warm the cockles of the heart. Oak is one of the most prominent flavors on the tongue followed by hints of vanilla and butterscotch. The chocolate flavor works really nicely with the whiskey. The mouthfeel is interesting. The alcohol and bitterness which are indeed flavors are only preemptive of the smoothness that follows. This is a sipper by nature but goddamn if it isn't tasty and velvety smooth.

Taste has coffee burnt sugar and unsweetened chocolate present with toasty malt in the background and the finish is a bit too bitter for me for a stout like this.

My friend next to met said it "absolutely perfect". It's the perfect mix of rich chocolate, freshly brewed coffee, and alcohol. It can be a little sweet though. It's how you would want your coffee to taste in the morning. It's extremely smooth and milky. It again is just perfect. It's so drinkability due it being amazing in all of the above categories.

Matt Damon, I mean the Bourbon, was really well balanced in this, not over powering all the other players. There were hints of coffee that left a nice roasty quality, and then the vanilla.

Lots of chocolates, coffee, and just enough bourbon to complement and hide the ABV yet it does not overpower, which I liked. A tinge of alcohol taste as it finishes but the 11.2% ABV is definitely masked well. Full mouthfeel and super rich.

The aroma is a very nice blend of coffee, roasted malts, and a little hint of the oak. The taste was an intense blend of the coffee and roasted malts. The mouthfeel was rather light considering how heavy of a beer this is, which would made it very easy to drink a few of these. Anyone who likes coffee flavor in their beer would absolutely love this.","jonvan04","Jun 17, 2010"

Chocolate and coffee come up first with some of the classic oak-imparted flavor. Bourbon comes heavy in the finish providing a sweet and boozy sensation. There is no mistaking the alcohol in this one but it works for the benefit of this beer, I think the warmth adds to the experience of this.

It's a well made beer, but the bourbon flavor is too much for me. The appearance was a beautiful deep tarnished black, however. The mouthfeel was intensely thick.

I have not seen a beer recently that was this dark. Thick, caramel colored head forms at the very end of the pour. Nice lacing on the glass. Smell is intense. Lots of vanilla and aromatic coffee notes, with a hint of smokiness. The smell is boozy and sweet, but the flavor is dry and balanced. There is a definite bourbon flavor, but that is matched equally with a coffee liqueur counterpoint. An amazing amount of flavors that don't overwhelm each other, but all are in harmony. Mouthfeel was probably one of the "chewiest" beers I can recall. At first, it reminded me of syrup or pudding. But it mellowed out to be more stout like. I actually preferred this beer cold right out of the bottle. It seemed to lose some of the mouthfeel and flavor as it warmed up. Call that odd, but it seemed to be the opposite most times as true for me this time. Took a while to drink this beer, due to the viscosity, the abv and overall size of this beer.

4.83,4.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Served in a flute glass at Lord Hobo. KBS pours an absolute, all encompassing black. There's an impressive creamy milk chocolate cap, 2-3 fingers, that just refuses to go anywhere. Almost 10 minutes later I still have a solid 1.5-2 fingers of foam on top. There's a beyond ridiculous amount of gorgeous lacing left behind as I (all too quickly) empty my glass, especially for a beer of this size. The nose is great, a hearty mix of bourbon and coffee, heavier on the latter. I'm a little let down though because I don't find any vanilla or anything else in the nose, I was hoping for a little more complexity. That complexity I was looking for? Well, I found it even in my first few sips. There's an opening blast of coffee, supplemented by rick dark chocolate, before the beer transitions to a wonderful vanilla sweetness mid palate. The bourbon comes on strong (but not too strong) to close things out. KBS goes down absurdly smoothly, with a fine amount of carbonation. For a beer this big and flavorful, I found the body to be just a little bit thin (but this is a minor quibble in the grand scheme of things). While there's definitely a bourbon kick to this beer, there's no hint of any alcoholic heat, which for a barrel aged stout clocking in at over 11% ABV is absurd. I'm firmly convinced Founders sold their soul to the devil to be able to craft such an exquisite beer.","axeman9182","May 29, 2010"

Opens with broad strokes of coffee, chocolate and malted milk before moving into earthy undertones of vanilla and bourbon. Alcohol is well buried for the extreme ABV.

However, this is an exceptional beer and lives up to its reputation. I understand Founders added a few more tanks to the brewery so I hope this means KBS will at the very minimum be put in the brewing rotation twice a year instead of once.

Coffee is the first note that hits the nose followed by milk chocolate, light maple syrup, bourbon, and a bit of oak. I almost don't want to drink it because it smells so good. Almost. The bourbon is not shy in this. Comes out right away in the taste, but smooths out into oak-hinted toffee, creamy chocolate, and roasted coffee which lingers and bitters a bit with a mild whiskey burn at the end. A little chewy with a sweet malt feel and a little carbonation, but velvety and well-blended--a great libation.

A big nose on this one, with loads of freshly brewed coffee, along with bourbon and dark chocolate. The bourbon presence is dominant on the palate as well, along with vanilla, oak, roasted malt and chocolate covered espresso beans. The alcohol is very well hidden in this one, making it dangerously drinkable. After being unimpressed with this one last year, I am extremely glad I got a couple more this year.

Pitch black with dark tan head and cloud. Good lacing for aged beer. Taste and smell of cocoa, bourbon, vanilla, roast malts, big coffee, alcohol. Balance is amazing with an extra year of age. Smell is of great strength. Cocoa, coffee and barrel whiskey rules in balance. No more overaggressive alcohol, oak and bourbon. This beer needs age! MF is thick, warm, and low carbonation, very good.

Taste is no let down from what my nose revealed. Liquid chocolate, bourbon silk. Slight sweetness that is the perfect complementary touch. Slight notes of smooth coffee and only a pleasnat lingering aftertaste. An eighty ounce glass would be just fine. This highly acclaimed beer booze is too good.

I poured this beer at about 45 degrees, I let it decant and warm up to about 65 degrees to room temperature. Wow! opened up and warm this beer shows how amazing it truly is. The nose includes nuances of vanilla, cinnamon, caramel, bourbon, oak, sweet oatmeal, cappuccino and chocolate. All of these characteristics follow on the palate, absolutely delicious with a lingering aftertaste that please. The mouthfeel is full bodied but not chewy or oily.

Huge cocoa up front with a nice bourbon finish. The bourbon flavor is well balanced with the coffee, just enough to let you know it's there. This stuff is potent, although the alcohol is well hidden.

The taste is of Kaluha with more of a coffee bite and vanilla presence. The bourbon is subtle but noticable and goes extremly well with the chocolatey flavors. Some light fruit tartness in the back end as well as another blast of roasted coffee. Full bodied and slick but does have active carbonation that breaks up the heavy flavors. Some stickiness in the end. Very smooth and the ABV is nowhere to be found. This is a crazy drinkable beer, great flavors but none in excess all working well together.

Compared to some of Founder's other bourbon barreled aged beers, I found this one to be the most balanced with the bourbon flavors. The bourbon is there but it melds perfectly with the characteristics of an amazingly well-crafted coffee stout. KBS is full of complex flavors yet remains well balanced.

Caramel character is low. The palate is quite the whopper. Big coffee and chocolate up front with plenty of roasted malt bitterness. The coffee is big, with plenty of espresso character, and coupled with the medium-full body, it just feels like one. Bourbon is quite prominent as well, with heat and vanilla present.

The smell has a really nice mocha turtle brownie thing going on, with a bunch of cocoa, bourbon, coffee and caramel aromas meshing together very nicely. The flavor is also quite good, with a big cocoa presence upfront, followed by espresso, vanilla, bourbon, caramel and burnt bread. The mouthfeel is full and thick, but not sludgy. Carbonation is appropriately minimal, and drinkability is remarkable considering the style and ABV. An unforgettable stout, very complex and extremely delicious, lives up to the hype.","silver0rlead","Mar 21, 2010"

4.36,-5.6,5,4,4.5,5,4,"Pours the way a big, bold stout ought to: deep pitch black (or is pitch "KBS-black"?) with a quarter-finger of burnt sienna head that dissipates into a flat cloud lingering on the surface. A slight bit of sudsily-ringed lacing is left behind. The nose has a seemingly unhealthy amount of wood in it, almost as much as a small forest. There's also some bourbon, maple syrup, molasses, dark roast coffee, and charcoal smoke, making this one of the darkest-smelling brews I have ever had. That said, the coffee, wood, and bourbon o'erwhelm the other notes a bit, leaving me an iota unfulfilled. The taste marks a second manifestation of the nose: heavy wood notes, bourbon, molasses, vanilla, smoke, nutmeg, dark roast coffee, toffee, and a hint of chunky peanut butter. This is a fair improvement on the nose, and leaves very little to be desired. The body is indeed pretty hefty, but not too much so. The low carbonation, thick chewiness, and spitefully smooth feel all lead to a high drinkability, though this brew is clearly not a gulper; rather a highly enjoyable deep-sipper. Definitely lives up to the hype!","TMoney2591","Mar 17, 2010"

An initial blast of thick cream, toffee, and burnt brown sugar kicks you in the mouth as a whirlwind of dull-sweet chocolate malt and toasted semi-sweet chocolate dances haphazardly on the tongue. The bitterness up front is well-performed and the booze never becomes overbearing or a note worth forgetting. The bourbon, though, is the outstanding element in this beer. The bourbon flavor arrives early to the party, hangs out strong all night, and doesn't leave until the last cigarette is consumed and the last partier is ready for bed. But he never gets obnoxious or annoying; he's the one you never want to go. The only drawback you can even begin to have with this beer is the density and the complexity-it's almost too much at times. Oddly enough, as the beer warmed, I began to like it a little bit less.

The flavor is much more rich than the aroma, with loads of cocoa, fresh coffee, chocolate ice cream, chocolate cake batter, cookie dough, an opulent warming spicy finish. Chewy thick and warming with low to moderate carbonation. The nice flavor and fantastic finish make this an easy drink despite its strength.

It is probably the most opaque stout i've seen, just a deep rich black with very minimal head despite a vigorous pour (probably due to age). The aromas are as complex as most beers' taste, you get a heavy roasted malt with the sweetness of chocolate, vanilla and coffee, and also a faint hint of the bourbon in the background. All of those flavors come back in the taste, just a wonderful melding of everything a good stout should be. The mouthfeel is very nice as well, there's almost three stages as an upfront, a mouth coating and then an aftertaste, each with a seemingly different effect on the flavor. The only thing that keeps me from rating the drinkability higher is the abv, i've made the mistake of drinking a KBS later in a sesh and it's basically put me to sleep.

It was as dark and rich looking like used motor oil with a visibly viscous texture. The collar of brown foam was thin, the retention rather weak but the lacing quite good. The aroma was of coffee, chocolate, wood, alcohol, molasses and whiskey. The flavors offered all of the above along with tar, pine sap, leather, bourbon (specifically because of the sweetness as opposed to just generic whiskey), hints of dark fruit and burnt coffee and burnt bread. Despite the bourbon influence the alcohol was well blended in. The mouthfeel was rich but not heavy, the body medium/full and the carbonation perfect. Smooth, complex, demanding, gratifying and surprisingly drinkable. One of the finest beers I have ever enjoyed and absolutely deserving of every praise that is heaped upon it. To quote the equally legendary Ferris Bueller, "If you have the means I highly recommend picking one up. It is so choice."","thekevlarkid","Jan 25, 2010"

As it warms, the bourbon scent becomes very strong in addition to coffee and roasted malts. Mouth feel is very smooth with little carbonation. Flavor at cellar temperature was a nice subtle blend of vanilla, bourbon, roasted coffee beans, and a touch of hops. As it warmed the bourbon and vanilla flavors got to be very intense, probably too much. I had a tough time rating this one. At cellar temp, the beer was wonderfully balanced, but once it warmed, the bourbon barrell flavor just overpowered everything else. NOTE: Re rated 8/27/06. Tap. Bourbon flavor seems to have mellowed a lot since it was first bottled. Flavor is much more balanced and enjoyable now.","punkrkr27","Jan 07, 2010"

The way the vanilla and the oakiness of the bourbon barrel merged with the vanilla and almost malted milk ball like flavor was hard to top. Now that I have an opportunity to try the 2011, I must adjust my score. It seems to have a roasted coffee dominance that clashes with the high alcohol presence and over carbonation. Will adjust the score accordingly next year. Not horrible. Toffee just isn't my favorite flavor.","backfat","Dec 29, 2009"

Thankfully, there's enough carbonation to keep this behemoth afloat, as the mouthfeel is equal parts velvety smooth and spiced with booze.

4.32,-6.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"KBS is black with a tan head. Very little retention or lacing. Aromas are all vanilla and bourbon. They are heavy but most definitely inviting. Despite being hot (this is the most recent release and it's still very strong on the alcohol), the flavors are smooth, going down like a fine bourbon should. Vanilla, spice, and a bit of coffee bean. That is all, but that's not to say there isn't complexity. Everything here is so finely layered, while also pulling together to effectively create a delicious imperial stout that demands to be sipped on for dessert! Big body and low carbonation. I look forward to trying this again after a year or two. Age will do this beer some good.","washburnkid","Aug 05, 2009"

Vanilla beans dance on the tip of the tongue. Exquisite chocolate coats the palate followed by an intense impression of coffee and finishing with the smoky char imparted by the sweet bourbon barrel full of brown sugar and wood tannin. Just picture Ghiradelli fudge brownies by a campfire followed by a sip of your favorite single barrel bourbon.

The flavor of this Double Stout was complex and not for me. The flavor of dark chocolated and roasted coffe were up front and strong. These two flavors blended and balanced extremely well, so well that I swore there was a new flavor every sip. Behind the major flavors I could swear to have a new taste with each sip. The mouth feel was perfect. The brew was smooth and nothing in the beer killed my taste buds. The drinkability for me has to be about average, as I owuld probably think twice on a secound and pass on a third. The flavors are very intense coffee and I just personally slowly enjoy these brews.

4.77,3.2,4.5,5,5,5,4,"dense black color with a minimal tan head and lacing. love the bottle label. dark dried fruit, chocolate, coffee, vanilla in the nose with just a hint of whisky. fortunately this does not smell boozy despite the barrel aging, no small feat given that and the abv. taste is lots of the above with big sweet dark malts mingling with not-overdone roastiness and just enough bitterness. again just a touch of the whisky character. big and lush mouthfeel and veeery smooth. looong complex finish is semi-sweet but manages not to be cloying. light creamy carbonation is perfect for this style. this was some amazing shit, what i liked the best was that it was not overly whiskyish or boozy. this was like having a decadent chocalatey dessert that managed not to be overly sweet. get you some.","MrMcGibblets","May 11, 2009"
4.71,1.9,3,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Hours black into a tulip pint glass with a slightly thin, brown head. Great retention that fades to a patchy lace once halfway through. Smell is strong oak, vanilla, and slightly bitter dark chocolate (this was a surprise to me). Taste it extremely complex particularly for a stout. It begins with a slight hoppyness that is joined quickly by the bourbon. This lingers until the sweet vanilla shows up and a surprise appearance of chocolate. This all fades to a very nice coffee flavor that almost completely hides the alcohol. What is amazing to me (even more so than the complexity) is the crisp, clean after taste. I feel like most stouts that end on a coffee note have a lingering aftertaste. Not KBS- it's very clean and that makes it waaaay too drinkable! Lastly, the 'thicker side of medium' mouthfeel and carbonation level are matched perfectly to the taste. I love thick brews but the rich, creamy texture is what makes this brew exceptional to me- I love it!","jgap","May 10, 2009"

It was thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a lasting smooth and bitter oak aftertaste. Overall this had a fantastic flavor that was bold and complex, yet delicate and easy to drink.

First few sips were almost overpowering, with a silky-sweet dark caramel, tinged wiht bourbon. Alcohol hit hard at the end, with an off-putting rubbing alcohol burn. As the beer warmed and I acclimated to the flavor, the sharp pepper of the alchol diminished, but never went away.

Even the coffee doesn't add much bitterness. Fairly sweet all the way through. Nice warming sensation from the alcohol. Rich, velvety and creamy. My only complaint, not enough roasted malt flavors.

The taste was very complex with that sense of bourbon barrel aging. Not as sweet as most imperial stouts I've had and it makes this beer much more tasty and more drinkable.

Same with the taste, this is a monster of a beer. Dense and chewy, with all those stout flavors amped up to an incredible level. As it warmed the tastes continued to change with coffee, bourbon, and the malts being front and center at different times during the experience. It was a little sweet and I can't imagine having more then one of these. Honestly, to me, I like the Founders Breakfast Stout a little better, just because I find it more drinkable.

The bourbon inspired vanilla, caramel evident from the first sniff, the nose also features espresso bean, prunes and black raisins, there's a slight suggestion of flowers but this may very well be more diverse bourbon-inspired scents. Full-bodied, here the trademark Founders smooth carbonation comes in to help you breathe in the face of its sheer density and mass. Avalanche of roasted coffee, bitter dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla bean and burnt grains, followed on by black licorice, orange glaze. There is a noticeable alcoholic burn but it only distracts in a minor fashion. The prune, plum, raisin fruit a touch buried here.

It pours like crude oil and has a very warm and inviting smell. The complexity of this beer is through the roof. The bourbon barrels give it a beautiful vanilla taste that's mixed with coffee and chocolate. Although it's thicker than the regular breakfast stout, somehow it's smoother and has a mellow but lingering aftertaste. It's really amazing how this beer can be so mellow and subtle, yet so bold at the same time. I only hope I can find more of this stuff. The ABV was 11.3%, not 10%","abriggs1","Apr 03, 2009"

Very dark, but slightly creamy looking. Very thin head due to 5 oz. pour. Smells strongly of coffee and has slight bourbon hints. The strongest taste is the coffee/espresso flavor. It's a warm punch in the face. At the back of the taste comes the more pointed bourbon flavor. It's lovely. Some vanilla flavor as well ties this stout up quite well. The mouthfeel is amazing.

Poured from a 12 ounce stubby bottle into my Duvel tulip glass. I poured about 3/4 of the bottle, swirled up the yum-yums from the bottom of the bottle, and vigorously poured the remaining few ounces into the snifter. Appears a deep, dark, opaque blackish brown color with a solid two fingers of creamy dark ecru head. The head fades in about two minutes down to a 1/4 inch layer leaving a nice lace on the glass. Smells of bourbon soaked cocoa powder, vanilla beans, molasses, a touch of roasted coffee, and oak/wood. Tastes of bitter baking chocolate squares, smooth bourbon, black coffee, cocoa powder, vanilla, caramelized malts, a bit more bourbon, dark chocolate, and mocha. I'll admit, I was expecting this to be truly full bodied. It didn't seem it to me. It was still rich and satisfying, but just didn't seem as thick as I was hoping for. Medium in carbonation. Alcohol is completely hidden at this point. I prefer "regular" Breakfast Stout once or twice a month. I'll save the KBS for a "every few months" treat to enjoy, sip and savor over the course of an hour or so.","ClockworkOrange","Mar 25, 2009"

Also some bourbon, burtn malts and some residual sweetness in the smell (bitter chocolate, caramel). A mix of coffee and burnt malts and oak/wood lead to a dryish feeling w/ this beer, but overall it is smooth and creamy with a sweet taste thanks to the chocolate and vanilla in there. Even a hint of hops in the backend, although this beer is about the malts. The 10% ABV is not overpowering but instead compliments the beer as it lets it warm the tongue and prickles the tongue on the backend.

4.84,4.8,4,5,5,5,4.5,"It pours out pitch black, with a thin head. It fades a bit, leaving swirls of bubbles and leaves little bits of lace all the way down. Looks about like what I'd expect, but a bigger head would've really made me fall in love. The smell, it can't get any better. First you get wood, just wonderful wood, mixed in with a brilliant bourbon smell, a bit of alcohol. Then there's the coffee, roasted a bit burnt, but very nice. Then you really smell vanilla and chocolate, BIG vanilla sometimes, and really beautiful dark chocolate others. I mean, there's nothing else I could ask for, and the best part, the very best part, is every time I put my face up to the glass, there's something new, and something great. The taste is wonderful, just like the smell. It's totally different from the average stout, but everything is there. First you get a very woody, earth coffee taste, like bourbon mixed with fresh brewed coffee. Then comes the vanilla, and its very nice as it sweetens, and is almost creamy like good vanilla ice cream, and finishes like a very smooth dark chocolate bar, and just a bit of an alcohol after burn. But the alcohol mostly warms. The mouthfeel is just perfect, smooth and creamy, with infinite complexity. I was just fascinated at every sip, and couldn't put it down. I wouldn't put it down under any circumstances, and is possible the greatest drinker at 10% I've ever had. Really incredible. Really, really incredible. You must find it and taste it.

It was thick and delicious with low carbonation and had motor oil-like qualities... In a good way. It was rich like a heavy burnt oatmeal milkshake. It was semi-sweet like a Hershey's Special Dark chocolate bar but also had bitterness and slightly smokey heavy overtones. It was God Damn delicious. I wish I had more than 6 ounces.

Although this scent reminds me of my Ol' Grandad/Jack Daniels days, I can also detect deep wood, vanilla, coffee and a hint of black pepper. This is truly spicy but also has a mix of syrup and caramel on the initial sip. This turns to mild bitter chocolate and a serious big ass bourbon blast for the finish! mouthfeel is thick, heavy and smooth though not quite creamy.

Powerful smoke and coffee in flavor, in addition to musty, spicy hops. Chocolate and toffee notes appear in the aroma as the beer warms. No real vanilla, this is more of a charred oak, with ash, cola and espresso beans in the flavor. Appropriately thick mouthfeel, but the slightly hot finish hurts drinkability.

There is also mild undertone of Knob Creek, the combination is like a shot in your morning coffee. The taste is more complex and subtle than the smell. There is coffee, bourbon, chocolate all in perfect balance. The finish is crisp with a wonderfull aftertaste. A full bodied beer that hides its 10% ABV well, making it easy to drink.

Its not hidden, its like a punch in the face, almost syrup-like. The alcohol is well hidden. Its only appearance is at the back of the tongue, just before swallowing. This beer cannot be a session beer by definition, unless your session is one or two drinks. I've been looking for Kentucky Breakfast Stout for quite a while. I am so happy to have found this.

4.97,7.6,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Let me begin, by stating that this is one of the best beers I have ever had. It poured jet black with a small, dark head. Its aroma was that of coffee, vanilla, and a hint of bourbon. I recall remarking on how I hoped that this beer tasted as good as it smelled. And, it did. The taste was also that of coffee and a hint of vanilla. The bourbon was less pronounced than expected and overpowered by the coffee. This ale was exceptionally drinkable, even at 10% ABV. After finishing the beer, I immediately wanted another; however, at $8.50 a bottle (but worth every penny), there was none other to be had. A more than exceptional beer from an outstanding brewery.","McLovinmybeer","Sep 07, 2008"

The aroma is huge on Bourbon with mild hints of coffee, vanilla, and chocolate but dominated by bourbon. The taste is right up the same alley. The Bourbon really comes through even giving me a little of Whiskey shudders. Coffee is the next big flavor with it really coming out in the finish and coating your mouth with an espresso flavor. The mouthfeel is full and creamy leaving an oily coating the holds the flavors in your mouth. This is a really good stout, but the Bourbon is a bit overwhelming for me.

This is a totally different beer than the regular breakfast stout from Founder's ( one of my favorite craft brewer's). Bourbon is very present both in the nose and taste with a heavy coffee taste mixed in as well. Just go ahead and throw a shot of bourbon in a cup of day old cold coffee and you get the picture!

4.42,-4.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"200th review - Received as an extra from iceicebaby (thanks again Sean). Served in my DFH snifter. Poured a dark, opaque brown. Quarter-inch tan-colored head subsided into a slick of foam with a solid ring around the shoulders. Jagged peaks and valleys of lacing, but adherence is somewhat spotty. Smell is decadent. Lots of coffee and molasses up front with a warm bourbon quality in the background. Dark fruit is revealed as the snifter warmed in my hand. Flavors offer a nice and balanced blend of the qualities presented in the nose. Coffee is roasty without tasting burnt or astringent. Cocoa flavors are detected as well. Bourbon character is complementary rather than over-assertive. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and silky up front; not at all viscous. A little chalky, but not unpleasantly so. Alcohol is fairly well-hidden and quite drinkable. A great brew to celebrate my 200th review.","Jwale73","Jun 11, 2008"

3.87,-16.2,4,4.5,4,3.5,3,"Big shout out to "Med" for sending me this bottle. Blacker than your average imperial stout - barely any light at the edges. There was a minimal tan head, perhaps due to its age (I am uncertain of its age) because I am sure my brandy snifter is "beer clean." The aroma is utterly beguiling. An amazing balance of coffee, vanilla, cocoa, milk duds, bourbon and that decades of candy and soda smell from old 7-11's, Highs, or the candy aisle in an old drug store. Also a hint of suburban decaying strip-mall hair/ nail salon with the chocolate/ candy store next door from the 80's. All in balance. I have been sitting here for ten minutes just smelling the damn thing. Flavor is all of the above with the addition of a High's blue Slushie and boozy alcohol. The bourbon/vanilla/ chocolate factor is very forward, and I'm afraid the strong alcohol presence lifts the flavors up a little out of balance and becomes somewhat harsh. Full body with a hot boozy and acidic finish that brings back some bourbon and vanilla notes. Objectively I will say that this is a must have for imperial/ coffee stout fans, though on drinkability I must go low, because I am not going to finish this thing. But damn its good to finally have one.","dedrinker","May 28, 2008"

In the end the balance between roast character and smooth chocolate become really nice, the Bourbon barrel seems to meld into the background such that it supplies a nice complexity; so definitely serves this more towards 59°F / 15°C to get the best flavor balance. Much better and much more balanced than I was expecting; definitely a very good, moderate use of Bourbon Barrel character and coffee if drunk on the warm side.","Gueuzedude","May 27, 2008"

A nice aggressive pour gives a thick dark brown 1.5 inch head. This beer is dark and viscous, just pouring it out of the bottle looked and smelled like fresh brewed coffee. It has thick full lacing all over the glass. The smell while its still cool is just completely dominated by great fresh brewed coffee and espresso beans. As it warms up I get lots of chocolate and a hint of bourbon but the coffee just completely dominates for me. The taste is just incredible. Perfect balance of roasted malts, coffee, vanilla oakiness, and chocolate. One of the best tasting imperial stouts I have ever had. The mouthfeel is nice and thick and viscous. I could seriously drink this all night at anytime. I definitely see why they call it a breakfast stout with this much coffee flavor but I love it.

4.57,-1.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Tried this one side by side with Founders Breakfast Stout (i know, different beers, etc). A lot of similarities but this one goes the extra mile. Pours pretty much pitch black, getting almost zero head in spite of my best efforts. What's there is a very dark tan. Smells of bourbon (duh), molasses, pear, coffee grounds, maple, and some raisins/dark fruit. A bit more "twang" than the FBS, likely the sweet bourbon soaked fruit and slightly more evident alcohol. Taste shows much of the same but in heavier doses: deeper raisin and prune to the profile here, more pronounced hop bite in tandem with peppery alcohol esters, a lot of oak with a kiss of vanilla. Coffee takes more of a background to the oak here and is balanced out by the bourbon sweetness. Overall, in spite of being heavier in the abv department, this seems to address any imbalance issues that show up in FBS. The mouthfeel is thick and coating as one expects from the style, and its overall a really tasty, nicely layered stout - though I'd say there are more complex out there, particularly Abyss. I'd raid the local if this were available here - top notch. Big cheers to autumnaldave for the bottle.","grandq","Apr 27, 2008"
4.94,6.9,4,5,5,5,5,"Kentucky Breakfast pours black with a reluctant dark cream colored head that dissipates to a thin film and whips quite quickly. This is most likely a result of the high ABV and as I will find out in a minute, the massive fullness of the mouthfeel. The smell is tantalizing. Sweet chocolate malts, faint coffee, and a discernibly oakiness combine with a slight fruitiness to promise a full treat to the tongue to follow. Taking a sip is an explosion of flavor. As mentioned, chocolate, coffee, oak, and fruit, but also a spiciness, vanilla, and bourbon. The mix of flavors is simultaneously infinitely complex and yet amazingly satisfying. As mentioned before, the beer boasts a full body with very subtle carbonation. Just a fantastic beer. While it is a sipping beer with the strength and complexity, it is also incredibly smooth and surprisingly easy to drink. I am not sure if I could ever get enough of this beer.","MSchae1017","Apr 26, 2008"

I have been waiting to try this one for a while. The smell was straight up coffee upfront. There was a hint of vanilla and bourbon there and some chocolate as well. The taste started out as strong espresso with a hint of mocha and vanilla. The bourbon came in the finish and there was hardly any alcohol aside from the oak tinted bourbon flavor. The mouthfeel wasn't thick like one would think. It was extremely smooth and pleasing. The drinkability was great but be careful with this one.

Big aromas of coffee, chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla, with some alcohol underneath. Probably the best smelling beer I've had in the short time I've been a beerhead. Big taste of coffee, bourbon, and vanilla, with a bit of chocolate underneath. Alcohol warms the throat, but isn't nearly as noticeable as I thought it would be in such a big beer. Mouthfeel is right in the middle where I like it. Drinkability is surprisingly high considering the style.

Flavor ended with much of the same but almost became sweeter from chocolate and less of the bitter coffee taste.

Smell was great, incredible amounts of coffee as well as alcohol. At first I was a bit taken back but it quickly grew on me. The taste was amazing. This has to me one of the first 5's I've given on taste. Dark chocolate, coffee, some vanilla, some bourbon, some earth tones...everthing. Wonderfully complex! Thick as all hell though, low carbonation of course. Left a nice warm coating every inch as it went down.

It has its own particular coffee forward character, but for me, it doesn't warrant such high praise- my own taste leans towards sweeter chocolate stouts (I tasted/smelled very little chocolate in this, despite what others wrote). I do feel the coffee and woody flavor is quite overpowering in comparison to other components- again, more malt and sweetness would offer more balance to this beer. I fear labeling this beer overrated, but on a personal subjective basis, this is not an all timer for me. I do have 4 more bottles to try, so perhaps my view will change, as I think my expectation for something thicker and more sweet may have colored my judgment. In the end, a nice (particularly if you love coffee), but not great beer.","ABCJiugui","Mar 22, 2008"

Not a good start. The nose was full of oak and bourbon notes, vanilla, fruit, nuts... but no roast malt. The flavor was similar to the aroma, all vanilla and whiskey, cloyingly sweet (caramel), very little roast malt character. I understand why people like this beer - it's extreme, over the top - but I want to taste the roasted malt, the coffee, the burnt toast.

All that was promised in the smell was there and then some. Very earthy. There was also a flavor that I couldn't put my finger on. The flavor kind of reminded me of the way a cave smells.

There is a slightly creamy pinch in the early middle of the taste. bitterness is light through the middle and picks up towards the end but is relatively subtle the entire way through. Coffee defenitely dominates on the aftertaste, but the early finish has sort of a roasty hop bite. Coffee stays on the tongue for quite some time on the aftertaste. mouthfeel is thinner than I would have expected, but quite good. This adds a bit to the drinkability which is quite good. The ABV is GONE!! Nowhere to be found! The are many similarities between this and the FBS, especially the domination of the coffee flavors, but this one is noticeably different. This beer lacks the sometimes unpleasant akward sweetness found in a lot of impy stouts. The thinness is an assisst to this which I find quite pleasant.

You get all the coffee, bourbon, and oak and such. The aroma is great, but it does nothing for the onslaught of flavor that comes next. Lots of of cold steeped coffee aroma. The flavor is a wonderful blend of chocolate, coffee, soft bourbon, a drop of vanilla, and a good oaky dry finish. Chewy, lush, full body. Very easy drinking. Unbeleivable.","tjthresh","Dec 19, 2007"

The overallfeel in the mouth is that it is a smooth beer that is a little lighter than the pour would suggest. The smell is nicely integrated aromas of bourbon, cocoa, vanilla, coffee, and wood. The most noticeable trait of the aroma is how beautifully integrated everything is. The taste possesses that similar seamless integration of flavors, with an herbal bitterness up front and long bourbon and coffee flavors on the midpalate and finish followed by some more bitterness and a final hit of cocoa and vanilla. Quite a bit more finesse and a spot less power than I expected, but still magnificent. Mouthfeel is smooth, lighter than expected given the abv, and amazingly smooth and with flavors that transition easily from one to another.

I was finally able to get my hands on this one, and did not waste anytime in getting my review up here. This was one mean beer, I have to say. This one hurt me, mostly because I did not know it was. Poured a very deep dark black, thick like a shake and a full two finger head of caramel brown foam at the top. Nice gradual settle down left behind some very nice side glass lace. The smell was wonderful, full of sweet caramel and lactose sugar with a rich coffee and chocolate undertone, simply to die for as for as RISs go. The taste was so complex and diverse, I did not know what I was trying, this one was nuts to say the least. Full on assault of sweet caramel and chocolate from the very start, as this mellowed some very nice coffee tones. Very full, rich, and robust profile. This was one not to take lightly. The feel was like a dessert shake. Such a warming feeling, with really no hint of alcohol at all. Overall I would have to say this definitely lived up to its hype. It was a fantastic offering and easily one of the best RIS I have ever had. It fully deserves its reputation and its rating on here. A truly top notch beer that everyone should have to try at least once, definitely and whole hearted recommendation from the BA.","mikesgroove","Nov 07, 2007"

The nose is like griding a fresh batch of high end coffee. Soft but distinct backround notes of coco and bourbon notes also exist. As you take first sip you are amazed by the smoothness of this beer. Coffee is nicely roasted and almost creamy. Bourbon feel is noticeable both on the start and finish of the palate. Very dark chocolate notes are softly presented throughout the palate. Drinks nicely as it warms to room tempature. Mouthfeel is like eating a rich truffle, it just makes you want more. Although the alchol is very well hidden it does warm the belly nicely.

It has a warm black and chocolate malt scent along with a beautiful bourban whiskey aroma. It's got a coffee-like aroma that really draws you in. The taste is perfect. This is the best tasting stout I've ever had. It has a very complex palate of flavors ranging from sweet and creamy to earthy and coffee like. The bourban barrel aging really mellows it out and greatly enhances the taste. The mouthfeel is perfect as well. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. I enjoyed this on tap at the brewery. It was the last stop on my roadtrip and was definately worth it. I wish we could get this in NY. This is the best stout I've tried.

After buying one of these and hiding it away for a couple months before my big going away party (joining a beerless nation for the Peace Corps), my dad threw it down, not even thinking. After racing all over the state to find another one, I finally had it, with a couple hours to spare. So basically, there was no way I was going to dislike this one. And I didn't. Pours a perfect pitch black color, with two fingers of tan head on top that slowly dissolves down to a delicious looking film. Aroma is crazy strong coffee, alcohol, spiciness, and some breadiness. Tons of roasted malt. Excellent aromas. Flavor is fantastic. Alcohol spice works in perfectly with the roasted malt on the back of the tongue. Definite but subtle bourbon flavors. Nice sweet dried fruit and brown sugar on the tip of the tongue. A nice hint of chocolate as well. As it warms, a nice zap of winey liquor at the end. Truly an incredible flavor. Body is creamy and full, with perfect carbonation. Can't say enough about this one.

4.38,-5.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Even on a very hard pour only a thin dark brown cap appeared, then fell quickly to a skim of fine bubbles and a thin ring. The beer itself was black, but with the thinnest of mahogany edges when held up in bright light. Some spotty lace clung to the glass between sips. Assertive roasted coffee aroma, some grounds, toffee and caramel, with wood character in the background. Thick and sweet pretty much sums up the first sip. There was a lot of coffee and roast flavour, but also equal parts dark and milk chocolate along with rich caramel. Oak played a role in the middle, growing into a whiskey barrel, alcoholic finish. Still, it stayed quite mellow for all the powerful flavours. Lots of alcohol warmth, low carbonation and a full, heavy body. Quite viscous and palate coating. Great stuff!

A lot of sweet bourbon notes up front and then finishes with a dry coffee taste that it leaves in your mouth. Alcohol was not very notable to me. This was my first 5 of 5 after 60 beers reviewed.

The aroma was strong! It was coffee, coffee, more coffee and then several shots of bourbon thrown in. Also had a good vanilla aroma in the background. Gotta admit that I'm just not a fan of the bourbon/oak barrel aging of beers. Keep trying em hoping that I'll grow into it but I guess I want my beer to taste like beer and not whiskey. The taste pretty much followed the smell. Was an Irish coffee more than a beer. Got marginally better as it warmed but for me this one is overhyped.

4.72,2.2,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Picked this beer up from A-Wines in Inman Square. Lets see how it is compared to the regular Breakfast Stout. Not a shred of light was getting through the blackness of this brew. A small tan head also gave way to a brown lace. In the aroma were traces of smooth chocolate, coffee beans, whiskey, and some earth tones. Taste started off slightly acidic, then turned to burnt coffee and roasty bitterness. All the while there is a big background of fudgy chocolate.Mouthfeel, needless to say, is quite big, although the alcohol is not all that pronounced. This is an incredibly smooth brew; very silky, and big on flavor. At this point in the review, I have been drinking this one too fast, I will definitely be slowing down to let more of the complexities of this beer pull through. Although this beer was really expensive, it is so worth it. Definitely liked this one more than the normal Breakfast Stout. Founders continues to amaze me. This goes in as one of the best beers I have yet to sample. Cheers","jamie2dope","May 30, 2007"

Smell is a slight bourbon with chocolate tones and a light cappacino backround. Taste is bourbon with roastiness and a little aftertaste of chocolate tones. A little warm on the tongue with a harsh carbonation on the palate. Very peppery in the finish and on my palate. Overall, I will let this baby age a little more before opening a new one.

The aroma and flavor, to me, were dominated, but wonderfully so, by the coffee. The coffee blended right into the chocolate and roasted malt flavors, which gave way to the whisky. Still, there was a bland spot in the flavor profile just before the bourbon, and because of that, I can't give it a 5 for taste. I found it surprisingly drinkable and hope to find this again sometime.","tempest","May 20, 2007"

Fresh brewed coffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, dark chocolate, toffee, caramel...everything you can ask for! Honsetly, I hardly smell alcohol at all. I could smell this baby all day long, but my tounge needs to appreciate this one for sure...moving on...starts with a delicious fresh black coffee taste that goes down as a smooth sweet oaky vanilla. The bourbon definitely appears more as it warms up, but I'm lovin' it. So many complex malty flavors of toasted coffee/chocolate/coffee/molasses/coffee/nuts. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light to medium because of the more than expected carbonation. So smooth, so delicious, so true. Drinkability is scary good.

It smells like coffee, oak, bourbon, vanilla and dark/bitter chocolate. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but there's also some roasted malt, licorice and molasses too. Mouthfeel is medium/full, and it's creamy, smooth and oily. The low carbonation makes the drinkability of this beer excellent. The alcohol is well hidden, I can't notice it at all so it's easy for me to start taking bigger gulps of the beer instead of little sips.

Aroma is amazing... full of aromatic medium-roast coffee, mocha-vanilla and some bourbon-oak. Flavor equally stunning... chocolate, aromatic coffee tending toward dryish/bitter coffee, the sweetish "creamy" notes of the vanilla and oak and bourbon like a good "irish coffee" perhaps? Feels big and thick, making this a real nice slow sipper of a beer. At $8/12oz this is heresy, but I totally want to do something with this to serve in a dessert dish, perhaps it turns into a "foam" to top a creme brulee? or a sauce to moisten a bit of chocolate cake w/ fruit as another guest suggested?

A light brown head foams up about a half-inch, but diminishes quickly. Some of it clings to the glass and provides a nice lacing effect, though - something I find in most Founders beers. Similar to the regular breakfast stout in aroma with big chocolate malts and dark roasted coffee at the forefront with a faint smokieness of wood and bourbon in the background. Huge coffee flavor still dominates, but is smoothed out and creamier with hints of vanilla. Extremely balanced, smooth and slightly chewy on the palate with just moderate amounts of carbonation. The bourbon really makes more of a presence as the beer warms, but it still maintains its incredible balance and smoothness. Very, very drinkable and some of the coffee bitterness has mellowed.

Oh the The bourbon barrel comes up from the rear with the hickory aroma as well. Of course there is the standard chocolate, molasses, licorice, and well the standards. But damn, that coffee/musty smell has got to go. Its not balanced, and... it just has to go. The aromas transfer to the flavor unfortunatly and make this beer damn near undrinkable.

Chocolate bourbon odor becomes more prominent as the beer warms. This appears to have been the only part of the beer that has suffered from age. Taste remains fantastic. Can i give this a 6 out of 5 please? The chocolate and slight bitter malt combine smoothly with the warming alcohol to create almost a truffle-like deliciousness. hints of creamy vanilla more prominent on the finish. super thick and almost foamy mouthfeel.

4.43,-4.1,4.5,4,5,4,4,"Received from BA orbitalr0x as part of BIF 33, this much anticipated beer came in a stubby bottle with a label design reminiscent of bygone time. When poured, the deep brown opaque body aided by a mocha colored, one finger thick, foamy head was inviting and imposing at the same time. The aroma was heavily laden with dark roasted coffee and freshly hewn oak. I took a half a point off for the smell being a little too acrid, and lacking either the chocolate or dark fruit undertones of other imperial stouts. The taste was naturally coffee driven as well, with the Bourbon barrel aging providing a smoother, and drier feel than was expected in a stout of this strength. The vanilla like oak tannins and the substantial hop and roast grain bitterness came through much clearer towards the end of each sip, before being subdued by the eventual warmth of the peppery ethanol. The mouthfeel was abundantly thick and just a hair short of chewy. The hefty punch of alcoholic strength made this a fine late night digestif, but detracted from the drinkability a little. If you drink this at breakfast, call in sick and go back to bed till noon.","rajendra82","Jun 12, 2006"

The aroma is in a word, WOW! Coffee and chocolate blended with scents of bourbon, lets just say I like it alot. The taste is just as impressive, the coffee and chocolate malt hit the palate, then the boubon comes in with caramel and vanilla flavors. In the mouth it is thick and syrupy, coating the palate, the leaving that warm feeling of in the back of the throat that bourbon has. This is a very impressive beer, drink slowly, these flavors are meant to be enjoyed gradually. It is nice to see a beer getting intense flavor from something other than hops, not that there is anything wrong with that.","cameraman","Apr 21, 2006"

Mouthfeel is gooey, chewy and somehow still smooth and creamy. Breakfast Stout's bigger, badder, unbridled brother from down South.

I recently tried the standard breakfast stout, and was surprised when this beer displayed even more coffee aroma. Lots of coffee, a little bitter chocolate, and a touch of vanilla. The flavor has lots of dark roast coffee, vanilla, a little sherry, light milk chocolate. Very delicious. Smooth, rich mouth feel, no alcohol heat. This is scary drinkable. Awesome beer.","carln26","Apr 14, 2006"

The first taste brings vanilla followed by roasted coffee beans. The beer is not as thick as one might expect from the flavor and aroma. As the beer warms the vanilla aroma is more evident. This beer has a little more sweet flavor to it than their regular breakfast stout which helps to round out the roasted flavors and also helps to accentuate the vanilla flavor. Very well balanced and highly drinkable.","hoppymeal","Apr 13, 2006"

Bourbon and light woody notes blend in well and dont detract from this as in other bourbon barrel aged stouts I have tried. The finishes is quite warming with some booze and big roasty flavors. Slick on the palette and fairly thick but nothing amazing as it could use a bit more body. Good drinkability as well for such a strong brew.

4.84,4.8,4,5,5,5,4.5,"12 oz bottle, split with my wife. My pour is 10-11 oz. The beer departs the bottle an incredible jet black color. A quarter inch tan head forms and falls to a very thin ring over the top immediately. As far as I can see, the beer is still, with no carbonation bubbling from the bottom. Nose brings an explosion of fresh and sweet coffee, mocha, almost like an iced latte. There is a nice creamy vanilla undertone, reminding me a lot of coffee ice cream. Other than the vanilla, I'm not really getting a lot of the bourbon character in the nose. Flavor brings the same intense coffee flavors as before. Holding some beer in my mouth, and swishing it, exchanging air with my sinuses, I get a lot of oaky and vanilla character from the bourbon. The strong coffee start moves to a caramel and chocolate infused sweetness with a moderate bourbony vanilla finish. Aftertaste is very light moderate hop bitterness, with a very solid sweetness carrying through leaving a nice residual sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, slightly syrupy and with just a kiss of carbonation, but nearly still. Very coating, with very good stay on the tongue. Excellent. There is no hint of the 10% ABV at all in the brew. The bourbon is present, but not dominating, blending with the flavor, not dictating. The Breakfast Stout really shines through this one, while marrying with the barrel aging. Founders wins again. I am glad to have a few more of this beauty.","kmpitz2","Apr 10, 2006"

4.79,3.7,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"The Kentucky Breakfast definitely takes the game to another level, with an extremely well rounded full body, and almost unbeatable smoothness for a big bad stout like this one.

Mouthfeel is just tremendous, this really is almost a meal, and oh so drinkable. Alcohol is nigh undetectable and the finish is pleasantly sweet, with bourbon and vanilla lingering.

This brew also features a dark espresso coloured head of foam thta lasts and leaves massive legs/sheets of lacing. Aromas are all roasted malts, espresso, green/acidic hops, bourbon and oak! Taste is more of the same. The espresso notes are fantastic on this beer and the bourbon and oak flavors are well meshed and meld this one together into a fantastic drink! One of the best stouts i've had in the past few months, a real knockout. Mouthfeel is thick, and chewy. Drinkability is almost perfect, the abv and intense flavors top this from being an all 5er in my book though. Still on of the top 10, or top 5 imperial stouts on the market today!

Taste is full bodied and powerful; flavors of coffee, malt, unsweetened dark chocolate, a touch of hops, warming alcohol notes likely from the bourbon ageing. Nice. Mouthfeel was thick and dense; liquid flavor-brick as I like to call it. The finish was warm, and the alcohol had the ever-so-light bite. Not wonderful drinkability, but darn good.

The initial aroma is reminiscent of the regular Founder's Breakfast Stout, but there is something more to this beer. It pours into the glass in a thick, viscous motion, yet it lacks the overwhelming syrup-like quality that many strong stouts possess. At first taste there are strong hints of coffee which is then complimented by a smooth bourbon aftertaste.

Falvors of oak and bourbon accompany the malty chocolatey goodness and compliment it very well! Roast malt and coffee comes on after the bourbon leaving an aftertaste of bitter coffee. Awesomely complex. Body is full and oilly, but not too heavy and thick to have a large impact on drinkability. Carbonation is delicate, and almost "green". Wow, good uber-stout. If you like the bourbon-barell aging fad, GET SOME! Very very tasty, so I could drink the hell out of it, right up until that 10% abv knocked me on my ass.

4.52,-2.2,4,4.5,5,4,4,"Possibly one of the best stouts I have ever had. I first tried this beer at the Michigan Beer Festival in 2003. This is a strong stout aged in oak casks that were once used to age bourbon. The result is a unique, complex beer that is black as night with a slight tan head. It pours quite thick as you might imagine and in addition to the smoky, chocolate flavors of the malt, you get a hint of a vanilla-oak that comes from aging in the barrels. At around 10 percent ABV, you have to wonder if some bourbon is still remaining in the casks used since you can immediately taste and sense the alcohol. The bourbon flavor is quite evident. A great masterpiece in my opinion, though this is clearly a slow sipping beer not meant for mass consumption.","ahking","Dec 12, 2004"
