Flavor is bourbon heavy though not boozy, barely any coffee, light chocolate, nice vanilla finish. Bit of a Jack and Coke flavor going on here, supplemented by the lack of body. Body is on the thin side with medium carbonation. Overall a nice flavor but seems to need a good bit more body. Doesn't seem like this one is infected so that's good!

I got no coffee, though I did get a bit of oak, vanilla and bourbon. But the mouthfeel is thinner than expected even for the base stout and there is a tangy fruitiness to this that reminds me of green apples. Simply not a good beer and I decided it wasn't worth finishing. I'm leaving the scores the same as it was from last year's vintage which was delicious.","Stevedore","Feb 28, 2014"

Smell is a tiny bit of vanilla, definitely some coffee, dark fruits, and no hop presence that I can smell at all. Taste is a little bit of bourbon, some decent coffee, vanilla, and the obvious dark fruits. Not sure if this is an old six pack as it isn't as coffee forward as this beer usually is. Mouthfeel is pretty nice and thick. It's no BCBS but it is thicker than most. Overall this is a great beer. I know it's better fresh. This must be an old six pack.","NeedBeerHere","Dec 10, 2013"

Higher levels of carbonation would do significantly more to make this somewhat more foamy on the palate and also enhance its ease as a slow sipper. Ethanol is fairly easily felt in the nostrils and back of the throat, somewhat surprising given the relatively low ABV here. Closes quite dry, with substantial stickiness clinging to the palate. In general, a fairly mediocre presence as this goes across the palate.","falloutsnow","Jul 20, 2013"

I don't taste that bacterial sort of funk, but maybe this is indeed infected. the mouthfeel is really thin for the style, watery but well carbonated. this is a miss in many ways, which makes me assume I had a bad bottle. I will have to source another, and try again. this is supposed to be fantastic beer, so it deserves another shot, although two years in a row of bad batches has me concerned about central waters more generally.","StonedTrippin","May 09, 2013"

Aromas of bourbon and oak hit you first with a fairly high level of dark roast coffee also present. Taste is like the aroma, dark roasted malts with plenty of oaky bourbon with a slight vanilla quality. A weaker body than some of the other big BB stouts but at this lower alcohol level that is not unexpected. A fairly high alcohol burn for this alcohol level. Higher carbonation zing than most of the style. I prefer this over most beers from CW but it would benefit from either a higher alcohol content or less burn.","deebo","Mar 31, 2013"

I drank about half before I did a little research and noticed that this batch had some unintended flavors. The brewery recognized the problem and established a voluntary recall, but I'll hold on to my other bottle. It isn't everyday you get to try a sour, barrel aged stout. I will seek out another batch to try the real thing, but this was interesting enough to not disappoint.","NoLeafClover44","Mar 03, 2013"

Tons of fresh ground coffee with sweet bourbon and chocolate notes. Lovely oak and vanilla as well. Taste is just as it smells, and just what I was hoping for. All the great coffee flavors are there that were present in the nose. Reminds me of fresh KBS in a way. Fresh coffee with balanced out bourbon flavors. Sweet vanilla, milk chocolate, and just a hint of toffee and caramel. Roasted malt and roasted coffee. Mouthfeel is medium bodied...could be a little more thick.

Color is a deep dark-brown with caramel highlights. I definitely get the coffee on the nose along with vanilla or coconut from the bourbon. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full and the bourbon was the initial taste on my tongue, followed by the coffee roastiness.

The the taste is slightly sweet with lots of roasted coffee, a bit of nuttiness, and some bourbon. The finish has more coffee with a bit of nuttiness. Very thin mouthfeel for a stout.

Reminds me of my dad’s black coffee running in the morning. Taste is roasted malt, coffee, oak, and bourbon. Low carbonation and medium bodied.

The flavors are of sweet dark malts, cola, vanilla, and light bourbon. There is little to no coffee and it finishes pretty watery. It's also a little over carbonated. It drinks medium in body and leaves a slight bourbon barrel vanilla in the after taste. I don't like how light this is, like their bourbon barrel stout. It's odd and over carbonated.

Unfortunately I was slightly disappointed by this beer. I had heard quite a few good things about how phenomenal this brew was, which unfortunately made it so that this brew had some very high expectations to live up to right to from the get-go. I definitely did enjoy it though. I found it to be incredibly flavorful and very rich. I had a few of these the night I tried it with some other beers in between and non of them were able to hold up in flavor to this imperial stout. I noticed that for the majority, the coffee flavor becomes less noticeable after you have been sipping it for a while. An awesome brew that every Wisconsin beer geek should try.

And at $3.50/bottle I wouldn't hesitate to pick up again. The ABV lingers a bit on the finish. Definitely one to drink now and not sit on.

Hell, I honestly don't even taste the coffee, and this beer is only a month or so old. I find that this beer tastes pretty darn good, but it's actually more in line with the BBBW then it is with any stout. This is a pretty weak imperial stout just like the Satin Solstice. I'm going to guess that this is not the forte of CW. The body is medium, but it's almost considered thin. The one thing this beer has going for it is it's just overall tasty and easy drinking. If you can get it to the right temperature it goes down really easy. There is almost no coffee what so every just a vanilla bourbon goodness, but I enjoyed drinking it.

Deep, deep chocolate tones with a slight alcohol tinge are the most present aromas, but another pass brings a fruity smell, but what fruit that is remains a question (think really faint apple or banana). The total smell experience is by no means lacking, but it does not stand out in comparison to the BBS. Coffee, chocolate, bourbon, and a vanilla/fruit mix permeate through the flavor profile. All of these tastes are equally balanced, but the coffee taste lingers well after the sip. Think of your best cup of coffee, and how you smile after each sip. This is the feeling that the Peruvian Morning brings. The mouthfeel of this beer is worth mentioning as well. The carbonation adds a crisp component to the otherwise big beer, adding both to the complexity and the lingering aftertaste.","AleBlager","Feb 14, 2011"

This beer tastes of mega coffee, with just a touch of bourbon, vanilla and booze. CW knows how to make an imperial coffee stout, and PM just extends that idea without changing it much.

Mouthfeel is lighter than expected for the style and (as noted) rife with carbonation. A bit too much so, in fact, but the finish is creamy and relatively smooth despite all the alcoholic heat.

Overall very serene and still looking beer (like the Machu Picchu depicted on the label I suppose). The aroma is easily the highlight of this beer for me and is among the best of any barrel aged stout I've tried. Rich balanced blend of flavors, focusing on the coffee and sweet bourbon/vanilla from the barrel aging. Unfortunately I enjoy the aroma much more than the rest of the experience as the flavor is more similar to the CW Bourbon Barrel Stout, as well as the too thin, undercarbonated body. The finish is also particularly short and dry resulting in disappointment. The flavor is much more bourbon and vanilla forward than the aroma and is lacking the richness and balance of the aroma. In particular the coffee flavors are only present near the finish and in the lingering dryness. Not sure beer exactly is the base beer, but the barrel flavors are supported by mild charred malt, dark chocolate, too young dark fruits. I'm enjoying the Central Waters beers I've tried so far, but maybe my expectations are too high as I keep waiting for one to ""wow"" me and that hasn't happened yet.","yourefragile","Mar 01, 2010"

Wow, impressive coffee nose on this. Nice balance between the coffee notes, chocolate and roast, with only the slightest hint of bourbon. Mmmm, this is delicious. Coffee is in generous amounts, blending perfectly with chocolate, graham cracker, caramel, and vanilla nuances that just dance on the tongue. Not really getting much in the way of barrel in the in taste department, but there is light bourbon quality, with a bulk of the barrel aging translating into a vanilla finish. Smooth, rich, inviting. Barely any bitterness from the coffee or hops. This is malt forward, lightly sweet and delicious. Truly a spectacular tasting coffee stout, but I could go for a little body and maybe just a touch more carbonation. Great drinker, can't taste any alcohol at all.

The -bal comes forth mid-palate, bringing flavors of vanilla and toffee that meld with, but never quite overtake the coffee flavor. Surprisingly light in body, and ridiculously smooth, this could be the most sessionable imperial stout around. It finishes with a coffee-vanilla-roasted nut mélange that doesn't linger on the palate too long, making it a little too easy to take another sip.

Smells good. The flavor is a nice complex mix. Roasted malts, bourbon, coffee, chocolate, and a touch of dark fruit. I don't get the vanilla that most people seem to get, but it's good regardless.

But really, to me this is all about the coffee smell, and boy is it a good one. Taste starts with chocolate covered coffee beans, vanilla, and a bit of fig. Midway some earthy malts with graham cracker and cocoa powder. Aftertaste is warm with a bit of booze from the bourbon with more espresso flavors.

Just a bit too much bourbon here, the barrels were obviously still pretty wet when they filled em up. Less heat would allow the coffee to come through stronger, which I'd prefer.

First sip is a nice impression of dark roast coffee, vanilla, fudgy chocolate frosting, and faint bourbon on the back end. Bitterness is slight, as is the sweetness. It's like a good cup of coffee blended with a dropper full of bourbon and melted chocolate milkshake. Feel is on par with other CW barrel-aged stouts, not huge and not wimpy, just right.
