4.41,0.7,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours thick and black with a short mocha head. Big chocolate character in the nose, sweet and milky backed by plenty of other spices (cinnimon, alspice, and maybe some chili).  The taste is very well balanced!  Up-front is the grain bill, big sweet and roasty, lots of chocoloate and coffee, then comes the spice at just the right balance and is followed/finished with the chilis on the finish with just enough heat to let you they are there. I admit I am not usually a big chili stout lover, but this one is realy well done.","mtomlins","Mar 29, 2015"

Chocolate and cinnamon are a great flavor marriage, because the chocolate sweetness tends to transform the cinnamon from being a dry, mildly interesting flavor to a rich, spice melange, sort of the way salt can amp up the flavors in so many foods.","LambicPentameter","Feb 02, 2015"

A proper stoneground mexican chocolate tends to be grainy, bittersweet and oftentimes has some sort of cinnamon and/or chili pepper spice. This is liquid mexican chocolate. Great flavors and balance, great complexity, great strength. Just works nicely. Barrel aging this would probably put it over the top but this is great as-is.","Dope","Aug 31, 2014"

4.65,6.2,,,,,,"From the first mouthful I was hooked, a delicious sweet chocolately wash comes over the tongue, and by the time I let it get to the back of the mouth, there was the slight burn from the pepper and roasted malts. Some vanilla and dried fruit tones on the tongue. Over the 30-40 minutes I took getting through this one, the heat gradually grew in the back of the mouth, while the to tongue kept the sweet tones of milk & chocolate. Damn fine beer indeed.","MikeWard","Aug 25, 2014"

It really does taste like you're drinking some sort of spicy cake. Also, I am not a fan of spicy food, but I loved this beer, so anyone who likewise prefers mild food should not be turned away simply by the habanero peppers. Great Divide's Chocolate Oak-Aged Yeti is somewhat similar, but this is far spicier and more explosive. I would highly, highly recommend this to anyone.","DanielMB","Jul 07, 2014"

4.53,3.4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"2014 bomber in trade from Homer321. Thanks buddy! Pours pitch black and viscous with a super creamy one finger mocha head that sticks around a good bit. Aroma of chocolate and roast with light spices and a definite cinnamon note. Flavor is big chocolate notes, more roast than others in the style, with beautiful use of cinnamon and vanilla. Chili pepper heat is subtle just like it should be. Nice heavy mouthfeel but not near syrupy, with medium to lower carbonation (right on for the style). Man this is good. Better than Bomb, not as good as Hunahpu 2014, and maybe better than Abraxas. Now to get my hands on the Apple Brandy version!","BMMillsy","Jul 04, 2014"

Lovely aromas of chiles, vanilla and cinnamon with some roasty notes in the background. Really excellent taste- enough spice to heat things up and give you a constant tingle, but not enough to hit you over the head and make things unpleasant (like Stone's Crime and Punishment). Also, since the heat comes from habaneros , you get a nice fruitiness from the peppers that blends well with the cinammon, vanilla, coffee, and chocolate notes. Really nice. Not as deeply flavored as Huanapu, nor as much body, but there is a silkiness in the finish that's nice. Very well done.","Georgiabeer","Beers"

The vanilla and cocoa nibs tones it down completely, so all you're left with is just a hint of the peppers. Very unique. Almost had the taste and aftertaste of a milk stout. Thoroughly enjoyable beer - too bad it's only once a year. What a fantastic beer!!","BrianJohnson","May 28, 2014"

Nose of bitter chocolate, chili heat, tobacco, vanilla, and spicy wood. Flavors are bitter dark chocolate and cocoa nib, with a subtle pepper build of spice and heat, with vanilla highlights. Smooth, dry body that supports the dry and spicy palate perfectly. Bittersweet chocolate and subtle pepper aftertaste, with a dry, smooth finish. Awesome beer!","GarthDanielson","May 28, 2014"

Moderate carbonation level that is smooth with a nice dry, earthy, bitter and slightly hot finish. The heat from the habenaros almost provide a bourbon barrel like heat, but not quite. Crazy drinkablility, I expected to be sipping on this all night, but I'm about 2/3's of the way through and haven't even started dinner yet. I know I should have shared this, but it really can be consumed by one's self if they are a beer/stout lover. Love to try this one again, great beer.

The smell gave away the roast, vanilla, cocoa nibs and even a hint of spice. The taste was fantastic though. All previous smells that I stated were prevolent in the taste, plus a huge amount of habanero peppers. Overall it's one of the best beers I've ever had and would trade for it again in a heart beat!","ScaryHairy44","Nov 02, 2013"

Third time this year cracking open a bomber of the best milk stout on the market! The spice at the end is almost superfluous, but it's the thought that counts. Right? It can actually generate some heat after a few pints. Definitely more heat than the Great Divide's excellent Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti. Overall, excellent appearance, taste, mouth feel, nose, if it were a year-round release it would definitely usurp my favorite offerings by Founders and Great Divide.","common_dissent","Oct 09, 2013"

3.96,-9.6,3.75,4,4,3.75,4,"22oz bottle. 2013 Edition. Big thanks go to Stakem for the share on this. Pours black with a frothy dark mocha head. Retains well, leaving rich and robust ringing along the sides of the glass. The aroma smells like chocolate cake, coffee, cinnamon sticks and chilies, with a smidge of green citrus and vanilla sweetness thrown in. I’m liking this. The taste is pretty similar. Baker’s chocolate, dense roasted coffee, a firm citric bitterness, slight alcohol sweetness, a touch of vanilla which bonds to the chocolate and finally, spices throughout, which really heat up the finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a lively and sharp feel to the carbonation. The alcohol here does a little stinging in spots and it working with the peppers comes on a bit strong at times on the palate. While I found the first release of this to be an overall smoother beer, this latest go-around still has a lot to offer with plenty of rich flavors and a spicy kick! This is well worth seeking out.","Kegatron","Jul 31, 2013"

The heat from the habanero peppers was perfect on this creating a complex tasting stout that couldn't be mistaken for anything else. You don't feel the heat from the peppers until a few seconds after it washes down and your mouth has already been coated with those classic imperial stout characteristics. I highly recommend trying this beer and I hope to pick up some of the barrel aged versions of this as well. Cheers!","Apom","Jul 18, 2013"

Thick and viscous, opaque black, with a well-retaining half-inch cap of mocha head that left a few streaks of lacing on the glass when swirled. That's what I like to see. Aroma was a bit muted at first, but came out more as the beer warmed a bit, as expected. Dark roasty malts, cocoa, coffee, not much of the other elements of the beer, though again, the peppery spice was more apparent as the beer warmed. In the taste, earthy cocoa, dark chocolate and roasty dark malts up front, with the habaneros making themselves quite obvious mid-palate, a strong, spicy sensation prickling the taste buds, roasty aftertaste with a bit of coffee, and just a hint of vegetal vanilla bean; didn't get any cinnamon whatsoever. About halfway through the beer, the palate adjusted and the pepper heat mellowed quite a bit, turning this into quite a nice sipper. I'd say the body was nearly full, mouthfeel was pretty smooth for a habanero beer. Overall quite good. Cheers!","Rifugium","Jun 28, 2013"

Enjoyed from a westbrook snifter. brew poured a rather stunning rich thick black. generous phone meet and head that was gone relatively quick leaving patches of mocha bubbles and its wake. smells like a Mexican cake chocolate vanilla Peppers great sweetness on the nose is perfectly complemented with cinnamon. taste is complex. this beer can easily hang with hunah. everything is in its right place. body is fairly full but you would expect that from a stout this size. the peppers make it feel lighter and the cinnamon tames down the peppers. make no mistake though there is some spicey heat on the finish. definitely worth a shot for any fans of hunah.","cosmicevan","0"

The vanilla is hidden and the peppers come out subtly in the finish. The mouthfeel is oily, very thick and smooth. There is a light carbonation to it this also.

Rich chocolate nearly on par with ST Chocolat, but with a perfect pepper heat. This beer changes so much depending on the temperature it is served at. Peppers come out once it warms to mid/high 50's. All around wonderfully complex beer that is surprisingly drinkable; I used this as a test ground for observing how temperature can transform a beer.","icehawk","May 16, 2013"

4.25,-3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a dark black with a nice tan head and pretty solid lacing. Smell is pretty interesting, an interesting combo of chocolate, roast and chilis. Taste is really impressive, the chilis and the roast of the stout come together quite nicely, very chocolatey and tasty. Mouthfeel is full bodied with nice carbonatiom. Overall this is a great beer, but drinking it next to Hunahpu's it just isn't quite on the same level. A well done beer.","starrdogg","Mar 02, 2012"

4.26,-2.7,5,4,4.5,4,4,"Decadent flavor profile. Licorice comes up first then the peppers. Sweet rich milk chocolate and sweet malt. This is like a sweet non ashy/tar version of hunahpu's. The chile heat comes out more as it warms. Thick-ish mouthfeel. Really nice beer. I would like to see some -bals in this.","BearsOnAcid","Mar 01, 2012"

This is my first experience with Westbrook Brewing- I'll have to keep an eye on them to see what their future brings. If you like big stouts, this one is worth a try. I'm really looking forward to seeing how this developes over the next 12-18 months. ","ThickNStout","Feb 15, 2012"

3.84,-12.3,4.5,3,4,4.5,4,"The habaneros somewhat overwhelm the spices and chocolate in the nose (although a healthy roastiness is quite pleasant). Tasty stuff, though. The habaneros kick into high gear in the finish; before that, the cinnamon, vanilla and cocoa nibs are quite potent. Velvety, chocolatey and plenty roasty. Espresso shows up in the aftertaste after the peppers finally calm down. I'm digging this stuff. I'm curious about how it would age, but it's pretty damned good now, and I suspect drinking it fresh may be the best way to enjoy the the pepper presence. Kinda reminds me of a Mexican twist on a pecan pie I made a while back.","PDXHops","Beers"
