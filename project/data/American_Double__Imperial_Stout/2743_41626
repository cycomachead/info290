Wonderful taste of slightly sweet coffee, very roasty; finishes with a balanced degree of bitterness. Mouthfeel is unexpectedly thick, a bit grainy, but it's incredibly drinkable for 8+% abv. Fantastic beer, definitely on the sweeter side though.","jfugeman","Apr 01, 2015"

On the pour this brew is motor oil black with a huge dark tan head that really holds up.  On the taste this brew is richly heavy and very viscous with a nice balance of roasted malts with a tinge of a hop bite.  The taste stays more prominently malty throughout with a sweet kick at the end followed by a flat bitter aftertaste.  No where at all is the 8.8% ABV detectable.  This is a fine brew but the ABV must be sneaky to say the least.","mooseisloose","Dec 12, 2014"

The head disappears into a tan halo with a light cloudy cover over the top. The head and legs are slick and fine. The micro/fine bubbles seem to melt off of the sides as I move the beer around in the glass. The smell is rich and smells faintly of fresh baked sourdough bread, some raisins, some coffee, and a distant dark/bitter chocolate smell. The taste is complex in a way and not disappointing. There is a balanced mix of roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate, sweet raisins, and coffee. This stout has a medium body and a drier finish. I don't understand why they call it Double Stout...","mabermud","Jun 06, 2014"

3.41,-16.8,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours very black and opaque with a lot of dark tan head. Leaves a solid lacing all around the glass. The taste is more hops that malt which leaves a slight lingering bitterness. Overall it is smooth and refreshing but definitely has more characteristics of a Black Ale than a Double Stout.","gerite","May 22, 2014"

This one pours a jet black hue with a thick lasting ta n head and creamy lacing. The aroma is a sweet rich blend of chocolate, coffee, caramel, vanilla, and a little smokiness. The body is creamy and luscious. Flavor follows the nose only even more rich and complex. Reminds me of some of the special stouts from Southern Tier.

3.55,-13.4,4.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer, but when it comes to the style it's not too memorable and I would say it's just barley an above average example of the style, but with so many high quality Double and Imperial Stouts this one gets lost. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't the smoothest, it was a little rich and creamy and it was a little filling, the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, but I think the alcohol flavor would start to wear one me if I have more than one so I think one would be my limit. What I like the most about this beer was the appearance and that it was still fairly true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was that the alcohol wasn't hidden as well as I would have liked, I've had 12% beers that didn't taste as boozy. I wouldn't buy this beer again and I don't think I would recommend it, it's pretty forgettable when it comes to the style and it's not hard to find a better Imperial Stout. All in all I thought this beer was fairly solid, but it's nowhere near my favorite of the style but it is one of the better Green Flash beers that I've had, but I still can't say I'm a fan of this brewery. This was a solid attempt at the style, but with a little work this could be a better beer, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Mar 03, 2014"

Well worth a try if you enjoy stouts or porters.","CardiacNP","Beers"

4.22,2.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.25,"Enjoyed a bottle poured into an English pub glass. Let's do this. A dark reddish brown to black brew, with a solid brown head. Smells roasted, dark, and rich ... Yet surprisingly vibrant and fruity at the same time. Brace yourself, this one's got layers and layers of flavor. Initial blast is a malt bomb, cacao and dark molasses, accompanied by a nice deep smoky note. Once the palate acclimatizes to this, you might get some sweet brown flavors like toffee and whiskey, with the rich sweetness revealing itself over time. Some fruity grape juice peaks at you and then disappears. A search reveals some floral tobacco notes and a tinge of licorice, even as the overall vibe remains quite sweet rather than super dry and chalky like an Irish stout. Is that some gooseberry-type American hops?? Veers towards chocolate milk for a moment and then darts away; as I try to re-focus I get some red berry and watermelon, I swear to God. This one is fruity 'till the (fairly) bitter end. Not a ton of coffee roasted notes but oh wait, there's a little light roast and a subtle floral rosewater and crabapple effect. Holy shit, what a great complex stout. Bright and fruity for an ""imperial"" and one can plumb the deep, dark depths for all kinds of fresh flavors. One can taste the hops but not in a way that clashes with the dark malts. Dare I say the body is on the light side for the style, creamy, smooth, with more carbonation that many dark brews? Almost could pass for an ""Imperial dark IPA"" if the hops delivered more citrus and pine character. Magic.","CalgaryFMC","Feb 07, 2014"

4.1,0,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 8/30/2014. Pours dense pitch black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, char, toast, caramel, oats, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt notes with a fair amount of hop presence; and good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, char, caramel, oats, floral, light pine, and floral/roasted earthiness. Fair amount of pine/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, char, roasted malt, toast, oats, caramel, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt flavors; with a moderate hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, chalky, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial stout. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt and moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 20, 2013"

I try to like limburger cheese; no can do. I digress. Poured this beer at a slightly warm temperature with a large, foamy, frothy, light tan head that pretty much lasted all the way down and a ton of lace. Color is an opaque brown black. Aroma is sweaty leather, funk, dirt, hop, malt. Flavor's like nose, but much more friendly. The aromatic qualities are muted and the oral attributes of sweetness, bitter, tang come out along with a bit o' smoke and dirty love. Body is exotically poifect. Finish is like all of the above, actually pleasant, and leaves me looking for more. Fantastic beer.","drpimento","Jul 22, 2013"

This is one great looking stout, dark and imposing in the glass with a massive head for the style. The aroma is very smooth and roasty. After a bit of aging, Green Flash Double Stout has become a gentle giant. Creamy chocolate and roasted malts fully carry things, with a bit of sweetness peeking through at the end. Extremely drinkable. Overall, a really good, readily available, and cheap imperial stout. Pick up a four-pack and hide it for a year.","shand","Jul 21, 2013"

Those flavors really start to expand once the beer warms up a bit, too, allowing the more subtle, cocoa notes and a great dryness to come through.

4.18,2,4.5,4,4.25,4,4.25,"This is a very solid stout. Pours thickly with a nice medium brown head. So much so the last dribbles lie on the head like caramel on a latte. Looks very appealing. Smell is sweet and malty. Taste is full and deep with expected coffee bitterness, leaves a mild bitter chocolate on the finish. Very nice for a stout. I'm not sure why we've gone to double stout as a class. This is what a stout should be in my humble opinion. Lesser stouts should be re-classed as sorta stout maybe. Not overly complex to my palate although the label says ""Big, Bold, Complex"". I'll go with Big and Bold. I think it nails it quite nicely for its class and I like Green Flash. Here I'll digress momentarily to a deferential nod to their Palate Wrecker DIPA, it lives up to its name. Overall I like it and would readily recommend it to anyone looking for a very solid stout that hasn't already explored more avant-garde offerings.","FinerThings","0"
3.77,-8,4,3.25,4,4,3.75,"solid entry in this category. thick head dies down to thin ring around glass edge. lacing is a bit weak, i'd expect more from this. nose is not very prominent, not bad, just not much there. taste when chilled is bitter-ish chocolate and hint of coffee, but has sweetness as well. nicely balanced. as it warms, coffee is more pronounced. mouthfeel starts out very nice, a bit chewy, i like it. thins a bit when warm, a bit of booziness becomes apparent. too bad, it hides its abv well at first. would purchase again, though a bit pricey at $11 for 4, i'd say still a solid buy.","lighthabit","Apr 07, 2013"

Smell is roasted malt dominated and a lot of booze with a hint of coffee . Taste is of roasted malt, coffee, and a hint of cocoa with a surprising hoppy kick. Alcohol is noticeable but is well hidden by the rich flavors. Mouth feel is quite smooth with good carbonation, maybe a bit too much. Overall this is another great brew from Green Flash. I love how drinkable, yet boozy it is. I just wish it had more of a noticeable coffee taste to it. On par with, or maybe even better than Stone Smoked Porter.","MisSigsFan","Mar 27, 2013"

4.41,7.6,4.75,4.25,4.5,4,4.5,"Purchased by the bottle (4pack) at Colonial on 3/10/13 and poured into a tulip. Pours the deepest of black with absolutely no light penetration, topped unceremoniously with a dark brown head the color of brown sugar and just the finest of lacing throughout the glass. The smell is all medium roast coffee and sweet milk chocolate with a touch of char to it. Hops are buried almost completely in the malt bill; maybe the faintest of citrus San Diego in there. The taste is a wonderful example of the natural form of a stout, full of that roasty coffee and milk chocolate on the nose, with just a hint of sweet citrus hops and alcohol heat on the back end. Full mouthfeel and maybe a little flat as far as carbonation goes. This is an overall great Imperial Stout, something I really want to try on tap and especially on NITRO; I think it would remarkably improve the beer for a whole new experience.","estlinska","Mar 15, 2013"

The nose is predominantly roasted malts, even at warmer temperatures, along with a bitter (not very descriptive to say ""bitter""...I know) aroma, which I'm attributing to the hops, and a pinch of ethanol. The taste is of salted milk chocolate and coffee upfront with a lingering roastiness and bitterness that coat the palate. This beer drinks smoothly with a cascade of stouty flavors in the forefront followed by a relatively dry, roasty, bitter finish. You're not aware of the beer's near 9% abv, even at warmer serving temperatures. I enjoy this beer and will almost certainly recommend it to others.","ThePorterSorter","Mar 04, 2013"

Molasses, cocoa, licorice, coffee and a bit of milk chocolate are all very strong. Flavor is sweet, coffee grounds and bitter all at once; not sure I like the juxtaposition versus a well integrated profile. Some molasses, dark figs and a little hershey syrup in there. When this beer first entered my lips, I noticed the body - it seemed thin and flat, then I gave it a light swish and some carb came out. Overall the body was poorly constructed with a lower than anticipated (even for a stout) and no body to back it up with a dry finish. Meh, has stuff going for it, but not that all impressed.","harrymel","Dec 30, 2012"

The aroma is sweet chocolate malt, with a little bit of roastiness. The body is Thick & Heavy, with capitals T & H, respectively. The mouthfeel is so full and flavourful that you can tell this isn't your regular ordinary run-of-the-mill stout, it is obviously a Double, and a well-crafted one at that. As soon as this brew hits your tongue, cue the silky chocolate overload, followed by a sweet roasted coffee/cocoa finish. And don't forget the booze, that mild dry alcohol flavor balances the sweetness nicely, and leaves your tastebuds wondering ""What the hell just happened?"". Not for the faint of heart, or anyone who is New-to-the-Brew. Take it from me, you'd better work your way up to this one.","Cookeeman","Oct 23, 2012"

Aroma is full of roasted coffee and malt, light sweetness and chocolate. Taste is similar, but tons of roasted flavor is most present -- coffee and malt. There is a certain degree of hop bitterness that I enjoy here as well. This beer is definitely ""chewy"" for an imperial stout. Mouthfeel is smooth, and dangerously drinkable, no noticeable ABV.

Plenty of sticky lacing is left behind on the glass. There are aromas of dark roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee. It has the typical imperial stout smell that really opens up as it warms. The alcohol can also be picked up in the smell. The dark roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee flavors blend very well together in the mouth. The roasted malts leave a light aftertaste. There are also some hops in the back end, which balance some of those big flavors. The alcohol is well-hidden, but becomes more apparent as it warms up. The flavors become bolder as the beer warms. The body is medium to full with some carbonation. The finish is dry. The beer is creamy, though a bit on the thinner side of creamy. This helps the drinkability, but this is still a sipper. This is an excellent beer. While it's not quite as good as Old Rasputin, this is still a solid imperial stout.","acevenom","Jul 24, 2012"

Green Flash has never disappointed me!","GONZALOYANNA","May 19, 2012"

This was a really nice stout though. It was jet black and lacking a thick head but delicious, refreshing, and very full flavored. Something more than a chocolate malt ale that a lot of people brew as a stout.","TSJ4000","May 15, 2012"

Nothing complemented the head then the rich lacing it left behind after the creamy head settled. Strong hints of chocolate immediately caught my attention, folloeed by a touch of used coffee and a hint of booze. The taste is very similar to the smell. Chocolate and once again, used coffee. Alcohol barely makes its presence in the finish but it finishes nice and would consider it a lip smacker. Mouthfeel? Well typical for a stout. Low carbonation and a medium to thich body.

Although it is an Imperial Stout, its aroma in not unlike that of a Sweet Stout, with a clean, creamy nose containing chocolate and coffee as well. The flavor itself unique containing the best of both worlds, so to speak, in regards to the two aforementioned styles. It begins rather sweet before giving way to a tinge of hops followed by a wallop of bitter coffee bean. As another reviewer mentions, the mouth feel and body is a little thin. Again though, this is one of the more unique stouts I've personally had. A win.","Neorebel","Feb 10, 2012"

Clings to the glass as the head slowly recedes, and the beer has strong coffee aromas. The coffee smells are blended with a dark chocolate aroma, as well as a roasty character. Flavors are very rich, with a good blast of bitter dark chocolate and dark roasted coffee, evenly blended and overly bitter, with a slight char and dark fruit sweetness (currant) at the end of the palate. The aftertaste is more of the roasty qualities, with a kiss of the dark cocoa. Smooth body, but remaining somewhat light to allow more ease of drinking. The finish is bitter and slightly boozey, giving a somewhat drying, astringent feel, albeit for a fuller beer such as a stout. Good beer.","GarthDanielson","Jan 14, 2012"

4.2,2.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams glass. Caramel colored tightly bubbled two finger head, pours an opaque black. Aroma of roasted coffee, dark chocolate and caramel. Tastes of coffee, burnt toffee, mild alcohol, and chocolate - a little smokey as well. Creamy and oily but slightly raspy (like a smoked porter) mouthfeel, well balanced. A great beer from Green Flash and one of the few imperial stouts available in this area in 12 oz bottles (at a decent price!). Nicely done.","coldriver","Beers"

Big dose of roasted malt, more coffee than chocolate in the nose, faint citrus and floral hop aromas. Taste mirrors the nose, really roasty goodness, a bit of sweetness on back end for balance.

Smell is chocolate, coffee, molasses, and some piny hops. Taste is all of those things, but way way more chocolate and coffee then the smell would have you expect. Fairly large body, for it's easy drinkability. Nice amount carbonation and not very dry. This is a very good stout and the price is right.","SawDog505","Nov 29, 2011"

Richly layered and dense with plenty of roast (but no burnt malt notes), fresh brewed French Roast coffee, a moderately bitter dark chocolate, a mild spice note ( anise?), and a little herbal bitterness with a touch of mint. Marvelously balanced, the beer finishes long with a lingering grainy bitterness, a little licorice and coffee. A touch fruity, even? Also, there's a little bit of sweetness on the finish that tempers the bitterness and enhancing the drinkability. Medium-full in body with a smooth feel (rather oatmeal stout like in this regard IMO), this beer has a soft carbonation level, allowing the grainy flavors to do the talking. A wonderful stout, I can't think of too many other imperial stouts that are this impressive and this balanced fresh. Lip smacking good.","DefenCorps","Beers"

The beer itself is more of the same as it real smooth and creamy and easy to drink (and dangerous considering the ABV hides itself well). Yet despite this smoothness there's a great dryness from the roasted and coffee malts balanced in this beer w/ the sweetness (dark chocolate, toffee...that black cherry vibe again).

It is hoppier than most American stouts, but fits the double stout moniker and has a gentle amount of caramel in the taste to lessen the impact of the hops and dark grain. Overall I really enjoyed this I consider it a decent example of the style without going overboard with hops or roasted malts a very clean and enjoyable brew.","Slatetank","Jun 08, 2011"

The nose comprises roasted malts, chocolate, molasses, and a hint of a combination of pine and menthol in the background. The taste holds notes of roasted malts (in spades, baby), dark chocolate, light coffee, light molasses, and black pepper. The body is a heavy-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a very dry finish. Overall, a tasty stout, though a bit on the bitter and dry sides for my tastes.","TMoney2591","Beers"

4.21,2.7,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Picked up a 12 oz bottle for $3 in Monterey, CA. Heck of a nightcap beer. It poured pitch black with a thick, light brown head and lacing. It's a big, rich (not too heavy) chocolate-y stout, that when cold, reminded me of cocoa and chocolate milk. As it warmed, cleaner, roasty and dark bread crust notes came forward with hints of espresso and dark, dry, smoky chocolate. The finish comes out dry after an initially sweet and creamy cocoa note. My only knock is that the alcohol quickly becomes apparent in the nose. I'd be happy to pick up a few more bottles and try aging them.","tempest","Apr 18, 2011"

A nice smokey initial taste followed by bitter chocolate and some expresso hints. Awesome stuff. Full bodied with a slight bit of carbonation on the swallow but nothing to detract from the taste. Overall I think this beer is great! I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. Rich, chocolatey and creamy with a nice bitterness to it.

The nose brings a good dosing of chocolate along with some mild roast and coffee. Touch of vanilla in there as well. Some sweetness opens the taste up, followed by a mellow chocolate character and a bit of coffee and roast in the finish, creating a bit of a roasty bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy with low levels of carbonation. Finish is a bit too roasty and dry for my taste. Drinks pretty well and this is certainly something I'd order again.","Thorpe429","Jan 31, 2011"

Herbal earthy hop finish, creamy textures round out the dark malt flavors but it does of a bit of an acrid tartness through the middle kind of like sourdough bread. Mouthfeel is big nice and chewy silky textured flows easy with natural carbonation, a bit dry in the finish. Drinkability is nice, one of the most easy going poundable big dark beers I've ever had. Impy stouts although a bid higher in abv are usually more boozey this is dangerous due to the drinkability level. This bottle may have a little bit of age considering it's a big bottle.

After cracking it I took a whif straight from the bottle and it smelled awesome, bottom line it spoke its name. After pouring the look of it was exactly as I would expect, black. It was already dark in the room but it did seem to me to be a somehow impossibly miniscule lighter amount of black than some other imperial stouts I've had. The head was off-tan reddish which I love to see, it always seems to be one of the trademarks of a solid cappuccino flavored stout. After tasting, the smell and the look of the beer had already defined the flavor of this brew, no surprises in that. Roasted malt and whatever hops they threw in give it a SOLID coffee flavoring, like the dark roasted kind of coffee that I love to drink, bold and in your face. This is balanced with a sweetness that comes in very smoothly and to me remains very camouflaged and in the background of the flavoring. The finish has a little carbonation which brings out the initial flavors even more which again is balanced well with the sweetness in the beer. Definitely a recommendable beer, I mean there are others out there which are better so I can't say this is a must have but seriously if you get a chance try this bad boy!","dwilson01","Jan 23, 2010"

Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, dark fruit (cherries) and some coffee and hops. It's a nice smelling brew, however the aroma is light. Taste is similar to the aroma (but much stronger), it tastes like coffee, roasted malt, bittersweet and milk chocolate, cherries, charred/burnt malt, and a bit of vanilla and hops. There's also a nice bitter coffee and hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's rich, and also a bit coating, silky and dry. Drinkability is very good, it's smooth and easy to drink.

The smell right off it chocolate, it pretty much dominated over any other smell. A bit of roasted malts comes out of the smell and if you really try looking for it some coffee, not much, is somewhat apparent. The taste was a bit lighter than I was expecting. Chocolate up front, followed by coffee in the aftertaste. I guess when I say light I mean it's not as flavorful as I was hoping, though there is plenty of flavor. Really it's like a mild chocolate. Typical mouthfeel for the style though may be a little thin. This one's got a higher alcohol content but really it's not noticeable at all in the taste. Very easily drinkable and that chocolate that stands out makes it that way. I enjoy most if not all I've had from Green Flash so it was no surprise I'd like this one especially since I love the style. I'd pick this one up again no problem and probably will.

Gargantuan melted chocolate and cappuccino coffee driven nose, after that very similar toffee and butterscotch accents, hint of cherry or blackberry fruit, no hops discerned, you'll either say it has purity of purpose or is monochrome. Very full-bodied, grips the tongue like a vise, while slow to move you sense it's a choice, not because it's not capable. Tastes like three slices of German chocolate cake washed down with cafe con leche. Grape, cherry, apricot, plum fruit, much variety in this department. Roasty and toasty more than bitter, you pucker nonetheless. Consistently becomes drier through the mid-palate, suggesting the hops having more textural effect than flavor-wise.

4.1,0,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"The first time I had this, it was totally in the wrong conditions. Really hot, sticky weather, and far too many other beers under my belt to truly appreciate it. A hard pour results in a pitch black beer, with a rocky two fingers worth of tan heading. Smell is very earthy, with bits of roasted black coffee bean, soil and bitter unsweetened chocolate. Roasted chocolate and coffee begin the ride with this one, and then leads in to some great blackberry and blueberry notes. Flavors get more fruity and juicy as the beer warms up. Body is very thick, pretty much a meal in a bottle. Heat from the alcohol is not apparent in the flavor, and has not hit me yet after drinking half the bomber, although I expect it will after a few more pulls. It might be difficult to drink an entire bottle to yourself, but still very drinkable and enjoyable....one to sip and enjoy with a pipe or cigar. I am glad I gave this brew another shot, as it is quite a bit better than the first bottle I had of it. I believe I will purchase another bottle of this in the very near future.

Sturdy bitterness with hop notes appearing towards the end. Caramel up front with some chocolate and roast throughout, anise in the finish. Overly phenolic though, a little out of balance.

Also a noticeable hop presence, though it's not overwhelming by any means. A creamy smooth mouthfeel with a light tingle on the tongue. Very good body. Overall it's a solid and drinkable brew.

Needs to warm up pretty good, but the smell will get your attention. Initially an almost pungent roasted character, but upon further 'consideration' complexities are revealed like the rings of an onion. A dark fruit thing comes through and something that comes across with some bitterness takes on a licorice-like character with a cocoa accompaniment. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied, smooth and coating. Full flavored, the taste is also complex. Scoring points for imagination and creativity! A classic Double Stout; molasses, cocoa, java, licorice and a cherry/vanilla barrel-aged character. Too cool! A ton of stuff to consider. 22oz is definitely not enough of a sample to dignify this one. A real easy drinker...the 8.8% ABV may 'kick in' at some point.

Nose is all chocolatey goodness. Sweet, sugary and roasty with the slightest hint of alcohol detectable at the back. Taste consistent with nose all the way with the addition of a touch of oats and a kiss of hops. Mouthfeel was smooth; not quite velvety as there was a mild effervescence, but no carbonation burn. Alcohol is present, but more in terms of a warming sensation rather than being overly hot. My first Green Flash, and I was not disappointed.

Overall, there was a nice complexity to this Double Stout, which isn't too surprising.
