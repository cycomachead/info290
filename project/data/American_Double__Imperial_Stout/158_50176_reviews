"Excellent chocolate flavor with hints of the oak aging. Hides the abv well with a nice smooth after taste. Highly recommend."

"2009 vintage.  Pours slightly darker than cola with a loose, khaki-colored head that slowly dissipates into a swirl.  Nose expresses some chocolate notes and a slight char.  Taste expresses cocoa, baker's chocolate and some notes of oxidation.  Amazingly, this beer is still carbed.  Body is light-medium in body with an even carbonation, but still a bit too assertive for the style.  There's also a light acidity.  Overall, a little past its prime; however, still solid after all these years."

"Nice dark color and good smell.  Full body taste."

"O - 5 - What a stellar imperial stout. This stuff is kick ass and ages beautifully (pulled mine from the cellar after one year). If I see this again, I will buy a few to set back for special occasions and I highly recommend you to do the same!"

"Overall- Beer highlighted by big and bold flavors, nothing soft about this one. Intense bitterness from cocoa, roasted malts, and hops. The oak aging creates some more intense bitter flavors, very woody and earthy, dry oak. There is almost a saltiness on the aftertaste, perhaps from the cayenne, can definetly feel and taste the heat on the end. Overall, bold but enjoyable."

"On tap at Sie Door, Chicago.  Awesome, except for a cork, leather flavor."

"Was excited to finally see this sitting on the shelf.  I poured into a snifter after chilling in my fridge.  S/Roasted malts, chocolate, and hops.  The chocolate was slight.  T/It was very thick for a great mouthfeel.  Where is the chocolate?  I only got a slight chocolate flavor.  All I tasted was roasted malts and hops.  The start was nice but the chocolate never really came.  The finish was hops and bitterness.  I let the stout warm thinking it may help develop the flavor but alas it did not happen.  The stout was relatively young bottled in 04/14.  Maybe age would help this mature?  IDK....I would be willing to purchase this again and give it another go maybe with some age.  If I could do this all over again I would have passed this up and not the expresso Yeti sitting right next to it."

"One of my all time Favs, this is the beer that got me hooked on dark stouts. Cant go wrong with any of the beers in the Yeti series"
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The depth of this beer is endless.  Superior thickness and feel give way to a nice black licorice, dark chocolate, and oaky profile.  Thick and chewy, this beer is all about the feel as it drains down your gullet.  Sure, other stouts may absolutely nail all the flavors, yet this beer is feel first and taste later.  My first of the Yeti family, I look forward to trying the other members..."

"Pitch black with a 1 finger brown head, aromas of chocolate, coffee and roasted malt, more chocolate and roasted malt in the flavor and a thick, almost viscous body with light carbonation well hidden alcohol and long legs. This is one of the best of its class and a moderately priced option if one is looking for a big stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark thick brew with a great brown head with good carbonation and lacing.  Moderate head retention.  Aroma is of malt and chocolate with a bit of toffee.  First sip is chocolate shake goodness.  Huge mouthfeel, almost syrupy in nature.  Bread, toffee, caramel and dark chocolate malt dominate.   Just a hint of bitterness at the finish.  High alcohol content guarantees a crisp slightly bitter finish.  Could drink all night if it didn't put me to sleep so damn fast!"

"O: solid stout"

"Overall: I really like the regular yeti but this is a step down. too much espresso and bitterness, whereas the regular has a lot of char to it, which I prefer. overall fairly good but with yeti being easy to get and better (and in 12 oz) I don't see myself returning to this."

"O: The oak was way overdone in this one. The cayenne pepper was strange and did not go well at all with the rest. At 9.50% ABV, this did not need any more heat. The chocolate base was good, but was barely there. This was completely unbalanced, so it went down the drain. I couldn't get the awful taste out of my mouth."

"O - It's a good version of the YETI, but some of the oak/chocolate flavors are a little harsh and the alcohol / pepper finish is a bit hot/overpowering.  If I get this one again I'm going to age it longer to see if it mellows.  Prost!"

"More Oak than Chocolate, but definitely a solid beer.  Barely any of the chili.  Dry finish, like eating a really dark chocolate bar."

"Wow. Really disappointed in this one. High hopes going in and just a cliff dive from smell to taste. I wanted to love this one and was expecting this to outdue the original but it fell well short. If i had this blindly you could never convince me that this was the chocolate variant. Tasted exactly like the original. ""Hops toned down", exactly as hoppy as the original. No real chocolate nose or taste. Smoother in taste than the regular but less Roasty. Same killer creamy mouthfeel. That's the only thing saving this beer. I'd easily chose a evil twin or westbrook stout over this one. I will definitely try again and i would recommend because I am certain they mixed up the labels on this one."

"Saved a good one for my 1000th review, but I knew that Great Divide would deliver!"

"Midnight black in color and impenetrable to light. A half inch mahogany head is sitting on top. Brussels lacing. Aroma of bitter roasted barley is intense but there's also a light sweetness from the chocolate and a light plum note. There is an intense bitterness from roasted barley. The back of the palate is evened out with a hint of sweetness from the chocolate and in the finish the bitterness appears again. The mouth is creamy and moderately carbonated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very tasty dessert-style stout, but it's dark and roasty enough - and the chocolate blended so well - that it could just as easily serve as a breakfast stout. Very tasty and well-crafted stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Yeti and Oak Aged Yeti are two of my favorite beers on Earth, but this one just didn't quite live up in my humble opinion. Don't get me wrong, it was very good, just not mind blowing. There was a noticeable lack of tropical hops and depth in comparison to the others, and the bitter chocolate seemed to dominate the other flavors. I would never turn it down, but I would choose many more above it."
""
""
""
""
"Edit: And holy ABV batman! I may be a cheap date but after the entire bomber I am feeling somewhat ineh-inxot-polluted."
"O: another really good Yeti; well done"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Ultimately disappointing. Not a horrible beer, but not one that is particularly well balance or well incorporated, especially with regards to the oak and chocolate. Entirely too aggressive and harsh for what should be a decadent and comforting beverage."
""
""
""
"O: the feel and smoothness, combined with a neutral sweetness worked well for me. I could have used maybe just a tad more sweetness, but I am really splitting hairs at this point. I didn't care too much for the regular Oak Aged Yeti (too much bitterness), but the addition of some sweetness for this version did the trick for me. This could easily be a new one to add to my must-have list when I can find it."

"O - Not sure what happened to the aged version of this beer, but the fresh bottles are drinking beautifully."
"presentation: Packaged in a twenty-two ounce brown glass bomber with a pry-off crown, served ina Samuel Adams Boston Lager Sensory glass."
"I bought a bomber of this at Total Wine, because they had a sale on all single beers. I paid almost $9 for it, so I had high hopes for this beer. They were all met, and then some! I started by pouring a little into a pint glass. It poured nearly black, as a RIS should, without much of a head. It tasted of cocoa, dark chocolate, spices, and coffee. It was absolutely delicious. It got even more complex-tasting and slightly spicier as it warmed up. The spices really brought out the deep, rich, dark flavor. This is a very high-quality offering, well worth the price."

"O-Overall a decent chocolate imperial stout was expecting more a chocolate smell and taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a decent beer, but in the end, the interplay between the various elements is a little too chaotic for a continued enjoyable experience of the life of the bottle. I had to break this bottle into two sittings to finish it off. The booze and mouthfeel were just a little too much of an assault on my palate. There are other ""Mexican"" imperial stouts that I would reach for before this one, although it's relative availability is a definite plus."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle dated 4-2-14. Poured darker than I was expecting but not quite like motor oil. Nice chocolate brown head that left lacing throughout the glass. Aroma was great with some coffee, chocolate present. Mouthfeel was really smooth and did not feel like a thick or watered down stout at all. Taste was enjoyable at first with vanilla and oak characteristics throughout, but the cayenne definitely made its presence known in the aftertaste and very soon overwhelmed any other flavor profiles I was getting in the glass. The cayenne aftertaste became stronger after multiple tastings. A very complex and well crafted beer but unfortunately for me, I was expecting the chocolate to be more apparent and wasn't prepared for the spices to take over."
""
""
"Sure, this was strong and I felt a slight warming as I made my way through the bottle. The vanilla was subtly present from start to finish as it melded well with the chocolate bitterness that eventually shone through. Had this been brewed with oatmeal, this could have been a truly fabulous beer. As it was, this turned out to be a solid take on the style that was light enough to be enjoyed during the non-winter months. A great beer of this style should make the imbiber feel like royalty and that was the case here, as Great Divide has another winner on its hands. Take some time out and enjoy it for all its worth."

"Great Divide Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti ---4/5."
""
""
"Pours a super dark black thick and viscous. Small head with a lazy hazing afterwards. Smell is slightly chocolate with a surprising light fresh scent. Taste is very good. Hides the ABV well. Not sweet at all and the hint of chocolate is there. A very good beer."
""
""

"I love this beer. So much. The bottle has a bottled on date of 1 April 2014. It poured out of the bottle a deep rich black, completely opaque and no light gets through. Poured into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass, it gets about a finger of dark creamy mocha head. The head has minimal retention, but hangs on around the circumference and leaves sticky lacing. The aroma is rich and complex, with hints of Yeti Stout (coffee, molasses), oak, and cocoa with a nice earthy undertone. The taste is equally complex and delicious, closely mirroring the aroma but just that much more flavor. The body is thick and oily and there's a little bite of spice. Despite it's large ABV, there isn't any alcohol esters. This is a world-class stout."
""
""
"Saw this in @garuda s review: "" Massive beer with a lot going on. Chocolate up front, then roasted malts, transitioning to a dry oakiness. Cayenne pepper in the finish that starts out as complimentary, then builds through the end of the bottle. The spice really sticks around and becomes a little overpowering for my liking, especially for a ""chocolate stout"". Full body at first, then thins out a bit as it warms."" Couldn't have said it better, or as well. Really get a peppery kick toward the end. I usually love a good stout at 50 degrees and up to room temp, but this one got worse the more it warmed. I smell some tobacco in there as well. This one came across very bitter to me also. Maybe if you are really into dark chocolate you wouldn't notice. Reminds me of Southern Tier's Chokolat in that regard. Not terrible, but just too much. Fairly disappointed. One and done for me."
""
""
""

"With this stouts availability and goodness, I will have this again, again, and again."
"O- A great I. Stout by any measure. Try it!"

"22oz bottle with a Bottled On Date of May 28 2010. Pours a viscous black color with an inch of brown head. Fair amount of lacing. The aroma is chocolate, vanilla, roasted malts, espresso, and chocolate. The taste is roasted malts, chocolate syrup, espresso, earth and booze. Some of the oak comes out towards the end along with more chocolate syrup and espresso. Heavy, velvety mouthfeel. This one has held up very well over time and the chocolate is still very present. I was surprised to see I never got around to reviewing this one so I had to pull out an old bottle since they no longer distribute to CT. Overall, great Yeti variant that ages very well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I plan to buy another and age it for at least a year to let it mellow out. Tastes like a poor mans prairie bomb, hopefully age will complement."
"taste is very much chocolate-y, moreso than the typical stout flavors and very rich. kind of earthy and bitter, a little like having the grind in your mouth after chewing on espresso beans, but there is very little in the way of coffee taste in this one. I really like this. a little heavy on the tongue. very nice brew...."
""
"O. I loved this beer when I first tried it. I'm Glad I know what it tastes like fresh, But I'll prolly put a year on each bottle before I consume it. Maybe six months. It satisfies my craving for chocolate AND my desire for a very alcoholic brew, especially wintertime blues but fresh it's just too much pepper and hops for me. I other than that its everything I could want in a chocolate imperial stout. I can't wait till I can try another one that's cellared for a bit."
""

""
""
""
""
""

"This beer pours thick and dark with a sweet chocolate nose. The mouthfeel on this beer is thick and the vanilla notes from the oak pair nicely with the bitter chocolate. My favorite part of the beer is the finish with the heat from the Cayenne. Overall a great addition to the Yeti series. It is definitely a dessert beer, but it does it's job very well."
""
"Awesome beer far better than the expression aged beer I am running out of battery so I will make this short.  Pour a dark chocolate almost molasses hue with thick chocolate head.  Heave milk chocolate aroma with a hint if oak and sweetness.  Taste is super balanced with oak and chocolate blended effortlessly with thick viscosity and mild bitterness.  Damn good beer"
"O - Another awesome Yeti. For fans of chocolate heavy stouts this is highly recommended."
""
""
""
"O - Glad I had it, but slightly disappointed, mostly because of the pepper inclusion. Not intrigued enough to get it again."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Aged this one a bit long. More oak comes through and chocolate is more bitter."
"Too smoky, over-hopped and lacking in any chocolate presence. This is by far the most disappointing of all the Yeti variants (and, I've been disappointed by them all). SO MANY Imperial Stouts with SO MANY variants that not only surpass the Yeti franchise, but completely obliterate it."
"O: I am a big fan of Yeti. One of the best easily accessible imperial stouts out there. This is my first foray into the variants and it's a nice one. Definitely heavy on the bitter dark chocolate and I happen to enjoy both the style and dark chocolate so I especially enjoyed this one. The little bit of chile pepper heat is a nice addition as well, can't go wrong with hot peppers and dark chocolate. YUM. (4.5)"
""
""
""
""
"O: Sad to say I was not too happy with this beer as it was more of a chocolate beer than oak or any other balanced flavor profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - spectacular. Reminiscent of a KBS type beer. I would not be at all surprised if this improves more with age as the chocolate fades just a little and the oak evens out more than its already fairly smooth texture. I couldn't keep myself from trying what is now one of my favorite beers of the year, but I certainly look forward to cracking another bottle some months from now and seeing what has happened to this masterpiece. Overall this is one of my favorite styles of beer, and they nailed it."
""
""
"Overall - Great brew, I love that they don't ruin it by overdoing the pepper. This is a carefully crafted and tasty as hell brew."
""
""
""
"O: Great beer. Oak and chocolate are definite players, but are nowhere near as prominent as I expected. Despite that fact, the base beer itself is great, and the bits of complementary flavor the oak and cocoa nibs round out the flavor nicely."
""
"O: This is a really good imperial stout and it is enjoyable to drink. It has a great deal of bitterness but doesn't make it too difficult to drink. The focus of the flavor profile is on the beer itself and less on the supplementary ingredients like chocolate. The earthy flavors, whether from the oak alone, or in conjunction with the hops, overpowers the chocolate. If you enjoy regular or oak aged imperial stouts, this will be up your alley and I recommend it. If you are looking for a chocolate beer, this one is sure to bring you enjoyment, but will likely leave you wanting more chocolate. It is only a tease. I leave that to be your choice. I enjoyed the beer and while I do find it to be outstanding, I would probably seek out a different version of Yeti. The chocolate just wasn't present enough to warrant a name on the marquis, so to speak."

"This rendition, as with all the yetis I have sampled, has an introspective quality that is best sipped over a long session."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a tasty beer. It is complex and changes in your hand as it warms. It is a bit rustic on the palate and it lacks the creaminess of the best examples of this style, so I don't know that it compares to some of my favorite chili-choco-stouts (like Bomb!), but it certainly paired up with the vanilla ice cream I had for desert tonight."

"Overall/Comments: Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti is just a decadent brew with an extremely complex flavor profile. The alcohol is very well hidden making this brew dangerously drinkable. Try it if you can find it. Classified as an American Double/Imperial Stout @ 9.5% ABV. Consumed 11/9/2013."

"O: World class oak aged stout. There's something about this stout that makes this very big stout extremely drinkable. I can't put my finger on it exactly. It is the only stout that makes me want to have chicken wings instead of dessert. I usually like Pilsners or AAL with them. Strange pairing possibilities?"

"22oz into a pint glass"

"this was good, but certainly not my favorite in the yeti bunch from this year. out of the oak aged yeti's, I actually preferred both the straight oak and the espresso to the chocolate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer appears black with a dense inch of tan foam on top. The aroma does indeed bring a prominent dose of chocolate, along with roast, alcohol. Oak presence is there but mild. A really delicious beer. The chocolate component is well done and does not overpower the beer. A slight alcohol warmth in the finish. Medium to full-bodied with moderate carbonation. A delightful beer to sip and savor over the course of an evening."

""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Doesn't change the way I think about my palate; it's just a good beer. There are better stouts out there but of the chocolate variety, I can only think of Choklat or Sam Smith's. Worth at try and seems worth the 10 bucks a bomber. I will probably buy this again."
""
"Bottle dated 3.19.12. Decided to drink in honor of this beer winning gold at GABF 2013. Poured into large tulip glass. Appears black with tan head. Great lacing on the glass. Smells of cocoa with supporting roast, spicy hops, and chocolate. Tastes velevery with layers of chocolate, roast, coffee, dark cake icing, and powdered doughnuts. Excellent mouthfeel with slight alcohol burn aim the throat. I love this beer. Yeti is great and this version simply kicks ass."

"O: Very delicious beer. I can't say I can differentiate too much between this and the espresso yeti, but who the hell cares. Both are phenomenal beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Fantastic overall. Alcohol has been tempered and not overbearing, likely due to aging process."
""
"O - A very solid stout, I don't hate, don't love it - worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer is phenomenal. If you're a fan of sweet stouts or chocolate beers, this is a must-try. Two thumbs up for sure."
"I love my Bears, particularly when they're winning... Anyway, this stuff pours a lovely onyx topped by a finger or so of toasted tan foam. Honestly, the Yeti line must be the goddamn best-looking beers out there, man. The nose comprises cocoa, oak, roasted malts, light coffee, a hint of anise, and the vaguest possible sense of leather. The taste brings in more of the same, with the anise and leather contributing a surprisingly healthy bitterness to the proceedings, and with the oak taking a stronger precedence than I anticipated. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mostly smooth feel. Overall, a solid offering, to be expected from this line, but the oak is a bit much for me here, especially compared with the other Yetis. Still, a damn fine drink."
"Not going to be very critical, but this is an outstanding brew from Great Divide. It pours black, with a darker head. The smell is of chocolate and some toasted malts. The taste is very smooth, which masks the alcohol very well. Taste of chocolate, some coffee, and the oak aging sneaks in but is well paired. Mouthfeel is smooth, almost light, but it lingers a little after, but it makes you want more."

"Overall, this beer is perfect for that chilly snowy night and right now, it's become one of my favorites."
"Not possible without my good mate MrKennedy and tonight is prob about as dark as this pours a midnight black hue with a chocolate laced three finger head and lacing everywhere as far as looks go I'd be asking for her number,the smell is pretty much what is presumed its strong oak with an underlining of chocolate,cherries and booze,the mouthfeel is full,moderately carbonated and dry with tastes of oak,dark old gold chocolate,cherries,coffee and finished with a subtle dry heat from the cayenne and overall a top drop that I feel was best drunk this fresh and would drink again cheers."

"This is a very nice beer. But has some limitations the chocolate aroma is strong but it is drier than I would've anticipated. There is a lot of oak flavor as well as a good deal of bitterness. There is there a little head and only a small amount of lacing. Gets better as it warms up. I'm using this beer as a base for a chocolate stout cake. It should be epic. The gold standard for the Yeti beers is still the espresso but this is a nice change of pace"

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 3/29/2013. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense dark tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Dense soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, oak, vanilla, coffee, light cayenne, light char, light fruits, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of chocolate and roasted notes with some moderate fruitiness; and good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, cocoa, light char, toast, oak, vanilla, toffee, light cayenne, and roasted earthiness. Light amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light coffee, toast, light char, oak, vanilla, toffee, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome balance and complexity of dark chocolate, roasted malt, and oak notes; with big robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and silky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic imperial stout as expected. All around awesome balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roasted malt flavors with cocoa nibs and oak aging; and very smooth and lush to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
"O: A solid chocolate stout with nice wood and chocolate notes. Capable but lacking the complexity needed to enter the upper echelon of barrel aged stouts."
""
"Regardless- a very good beer and worth trying."

""

"ADDENDUM.... - all these notes taken before either reading bottle label, or these reviews. Seems as tho my bottle had a lot more cayenne heat than anyone else's .. lots more ah well, it kinda detracted from the overall. Would have been mainly 5s without the heat."

"O-tasty and very smooth could of had another pour"
""

"o: this is a sweeter stout for sure. the oak balances out the chocolate sweetness, but its so smooth that everything comes together nicely. there is no alcohol in the flavor. its warm, inviting - but make sure you sip. its a really solid chocolate stout that focuses on the sweetness of chocolate rather than the bitter that can be. again - really smooth, which is helped by a nice oak component."
"Poured a motor oil thick black with one-finger brown head that died at moderate pace with touches of brown lace on top of a mostly chocolate aroma, although some oak and toasted malts are in there as well. Beer is full-bodied, hearty and sometimes sticky, like there's touches of syrup or molasses in there, but mostly the taste is smooth dark chocolate (the smoothness probably from the oak aging which helps). There is some balance as the beer finishes dry thanks to not only a touch of the booze but some bread/toasted malts as well. Still, overall I'd say this is a sweet beer so stay away if you do not have a sweet tooth and prefer a dryer (coffeesque) stout."

"Overall- Best chocolate stout I've had and one of the best stouts I've had in general. Try it if you see it and you will be pleased."

"Nice dark caramel lacing coming out of the bottle. Dark rich black color with no light coming through. Oaky rich chocolate smell. Strong roasty flavor with a strong finish. Flavor holds on your tongue for quite a bit. Not my favorite Yeti, but still delicious. Hard to beat the Yeti series with regards to stouts."

"Overall (5/5): Well this one was a total home run for Great Divide. I like sweeter Imperial Stouts, and this one is one of the best of the type I've ever had, if not the absolute best. All the components work well together. You can taste the chocolate, the oak, and the traditional coffee and dark fruit notes of an imperial stout, but none of these flavors dominates the others to such an extent that the balance of the beer is thrown out of whack. An amazing beer."

"O: It's been about 3 months since my last Yeti, and in that review I said stouts were falling out of favor with me, but that isn't the case anymore. This is good stuff and variations on the normal yeti nuances. Some flavors are hard to detect but it is good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is certainly a chocolate malt forward stout as the name would indicate, but while I don't always enjoy aggressive, bitter chocolate stouts, there's enough of a sweet balance to make this one palatable to me....and the lack of a real aftertaste helps as well. In fact, as I drink this I become more and more impressed with it. Tasty."

"O: Nicely done integrating the cocoa, oak, and cayenne. The cayenne really adds another dimension to an oak-aged chocolate stout. Instead of being overly sweet, it really keeps things in check and allows a good amount of bitterness through from the hops and cocoa nibs. Highly recommended if you enjoy any of the Yeti variants or imperial stouts in general"

"O: My over all impression of this beer is that it is good, but not great. The flavors and look are really good but they do not blow me away and my feeling are the same about the smell and feel but on a lower level. I have like the other yeti series better, but this is certainly not the worst. I doubt it will do better with age as I fear the chocolate will dramatically fade with time."

"In the end, I I wouldn't go into this beer looking for chocolate, but you will get an fantastically balanced beer. For some reason though, this has the least amount of this chalky strange aftertaste that I do not like the about the Oak Aged series. Having regular Oak Aged, Espresso, and this, this still might be my favorite."

"Overall: this is definitely one of the best imperial chocolate stouts I've ever had. I place it a little above the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout.

The taste of the beer has a nice toasted note with the dark chocolate and spice. The mouthfeel is thick and nicely carbonated. Overall this beer is awesome, really hits each note they strike on the label. Really worth trying."

"A little disappointed, perhaps because I love the regular non-chocolate, non-oak-aged Yeti. Chocolate (in the form of cocoa nibs) was subtle, so it can stand alone (i.e., you don't have to drink it as a dessert beer). Didn't really appreciate the oak at all- chocolate, coffee, and other flavors kind of overwhelmed it. But drinkable. Alcohol was well-hidden. And fresh."
""
""
"Poured very dark brown, almost black into a snifter. Left a 1 finger dark brown head, looked amazing. The smell was awesome. I immediately got dark chocolate, whipped cream, then light coffee notes. Absolutely the best smelling beer ive had. It made my mouth water. Taste was immediate dark chocolate much like the nose, then I got lingering ash, a lot of it. There was a milk cream taste built in between so definitely a 3 part taste for me of dark chocolate-milk cream-ash. The booze presence was more noticeable then I expected. It wasn't off putting but it let you know it was there. Overall, this a very good post dinner beer to sip, relax and enjoy. The smell is outstanding and the flavors jive pretty well. It's a fine chocolate stout for sure and one you should try and have once, if not just for the aroma.."
""
"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours a very dark brown, appearing black in the glass. Half finger light brown head with good retention and lacing. Great aroma of lightly toasted malt, chocolate, hints of coffee and oak. Flavor follows with toasted malt, chocolate, charred coffee. Finishes somewhat dry with a nice long residual taste of hop bitterness and toasted malt. Medium bodied with light creaminess. All the yeti varieties are very nice stouts and I'm surprised I waited so long to review this one. The chocolate nicely integrated and the whole stout is well balanced. Close in profile to a well made Russian Imperial stout, but a bit hoppier on the finish. Tasty."
"Peace!"
"Overall, this is quite an amazing feat for an Imperial Stout, the dark, ashy, black malt notes in here stronger than seems possible, and fans of this style of stout should definitely put this on their must-try list. The sheer potency of these notes does, however, push the beer out of balance, and the result would likely be severely off-putting to many drinkers. Still, it’s hard to fault Great Divide for what is obviously an impressive amount of labor and savoir faire."

"O-Great Divide did it again. Absolutely exceptional. I like this brew more than KBS and it's in a tie with original Yeti and Founders Breakfast Stout as my favorite beers available. Complex and well layered with a nice, thick body, this brew could be appreciated by anyone."
""
""
"O: fanboy status confirmed, this is probably my least favorite in the Yeti line. An excellent drink, but I really loved the Espresso Oak, (regular) Yeti, and Belgian Yeti better. I'm probably just more for those flavor profiles, so I tried not to let my preferences overly affect my scores. This is an excellent drink."

"O: Overall this beer is a touch too sweet and without enough bitterness to stand up to some of the suggested food pairings on the bottle (like the NY Strip Steak or the Blue Cheese). As the beer warms up, it rounds out a bit and tastes like some of the other Yeti stouts with a bit more chocolate. Feels more like a dessert beer to me."

"From notes, 10/26/10. Pretty good stout, though something of a disappointment. I’m a big fan of chocolate imperial stouts and was very much looking forward to trying this one. Unfortunately, this beer is held back by a fairly rough boozy/acetone quality. The chocolate flavor is a little bit Hershey’s syrup-esque and not nearly strong enough against the other flavors. The nose seems to have some bland citrus pith/pine resin hoppiness, along with strong notes of vanilla and rum. Not much roast in this one. Mouthfeel is kinda up and down - good thickness but fairly harsh and hot. On the other hand, the appearance is superb - wall-to-wall black with a big brown head of creamy bubbles. One more quick disappointment - very little oak character. Can’t say that I totally get GDBC."

"I now the label says ""Oak Aged," but I was surprised at how the smokiness of said oak permeated the chocolate (of course, I was drinking this one after I had Rogue's Double Chocolate Stout). But I must say the ""surprise"" was a good one. This is a very creative beer, in my opinion. I like the juxtaposition of a dark, bitter chocolate with the smoky oak hit at the top of my mouth. The pour was a rich, smooth black, and the head was a gorgeous and enticing tan. The smell, sadly for me, was a tad ""soapy."" Does that make sense? Overall, this was one one of the better beers I have tasted over the past six months or so."

"Amazingly delicious and complex stout. This beer is really fantastic and is a perfect example of why I like to try as many beers as I can, because every now and then you stumble onto something special like this."
"Pours pitch black capped by a medium brown two and half finger fluffy head. Exceptional retention and bunches of splotchy lacing. Big, robust roasted malt, dark chocolate, charred oak, and chewy dark fruit on the nose. Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, juicy black cherries, prunes, big toasty vanilla oak accents, and roasted chocolate malt. Finishes with more charred oak, cocoa powder, warming alcohol and just a touch of cayenne pepper spice that tickles the tongue. Huge full body, that is abundantly creamy and silky. Low to moderate carbonation. As far as imperial stouts that utilize cocoa nibs, this is one of the very best. Incredibly balanced between the roastiness and bitterness of the base beer, the sweet cocoa, the oak accents and the perfect amount of cayenne. This beer is a very complex masterpiece."
""
""
""
""
"Too bitter for my liking, but most others seem to like it, so decide for yourself."
""
"Wow, I'm glad I finally got to try this one. On tap, nonetheless. And the 2010 version. Good night for me, I suppose. I think I prefer the Espresso counterpart to the Yeti series over this one, although it's been a while since I've had it. This one was no slouch, however. I have a feeling the entire Yeti series is worthwhile. Now I must seek out the rest."

"I let this beer age 6 months. First thing you should do is let this beer sit out and warm for at least 30 min. The warmer it gets, the better it is. It is black as old engine oil and has a nice smell. Taste is real creamy coffee, chocolate, and slight alcohol. No hop presence. This is a great dessert beer that will get you feeling good if you drink the whole bomber!"
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Just keeps getting better as it warms. A great Imperial Stout. Would I drink it again? Yes, looking forward to the second half of the bomber as well."
""
"One more note: If you prefer chocolate, drink this beer cold. If you prefer a woody flavor let it warm a bit befor you drink it. The chocolate fades and the aged oak flavor gets more intense as it warms."

"This is the second bottle from the March 27, 2012 batch that I’ve had within the last month and this bottle for the review was much hotter than the other bottle; that one had more chocolate presence and went down easier, but both bottles were incredibly tasty and enjoyable. Oddly enough, burping after drinking from this bottle produced a hoppy taste which just added a positive aspect to the overall experience of this brew. Well done Great Divide, I highly recommend trying this beer as it was a lot of fun to drink and full of flavor."

"22oz bottle poured into a 25oz snifter, is black with a foamy, brown head, good head retention, decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted barley, booze; not much complexity but a nice full nose of chocolate/cocoa. Tastes are rich, rich dark chocolate, coffee, roasted barley, cocoa, oak, vanilla, sweet but not overly, boozy but not overly, nice balance. Mouth-feel is full and creamy. I love all the Oaked Yeti variations, this being a close favorite, but it's difficult to pick just one."

"Overall this is another excellent Yeti worth seeking out and drinking. The coca nibs pairs well with the base beer and the addition of cayenne pepper is well executed as it doesn't overpower any of the other flavors. Possibly my favorite Yeti so far."

"The finish was slightly thin for me but otherwise a top notch stout."

"Straight black pour with big brown two finger head. The chocolate aroma is noticed immediately without even getting your nose way in it, some roast as well, but this focuses on the chocolate. Flavor is chocolate, chocolate, more chocolate, and a little roasted cocoa. Less bitterness than regular Yeti, but really good. The light roast and Yeti hops give this enough balance to keep it from being straight chocolate syrup. Near the top of my favorite stouts. Yum!"
"This is delicious! I love the chocolate additions. The oak is noticeable with vanilla and woody, earthy notes. The cayenne is less noticeable though there is a hint of spicy warmth to the back end. The body is smooth and velvety, and the ABV is relatively well hidden. This is a must try."

Alcohol is well hidden, but I did notice it so one tall glass was enough. A definite sipping beer and one worth savoring. Probably one of the best American Imperial Stouts I've had and just south of perfection."

"O: A stout for me. Very well done for sure."

"Overall: This beer is great. I really enjoyed the strong chocolate flavor and aroma. Some beers with chocolate in the name are way too sweet or overdone. this beer was well balanced, and just a pleasent drink."
"O:  Holy crap!  This is simply amazing in all facets. I can't find any flaws in this decadent delicious brew. The nitro really brings out the creamy deliciousness and is probably  the best beer I have ever had.  I'm overly impressed with Great Divides masterpiece. "

"O: A nice beer in small quantities. Why breweries inset on having a big beer like this in such a large serving astounds me. Smaller bottles can be sold individually and shared too!"
""

"Taste is quite a bit different from fresh...which I wasn’t a huge fan of. The best part of the aging for me is the complete loss of cayenne pepper, I hated that part of the beer when this first came out. This aged one displays a rich smoothness with a mellowing of the alcohol and hops; a big improvement, IMO. The oak is noticeable, but not dominant. This is the best Yeti I have ever had and has convinced me to buy a couple of these next time I see them. It has been at least a couple years since I last bought a Yeti of any variety; I kind of gave up on them after multiple disappointments. I had a 2005 regular Yeti that just didn’t hold up well and the unpaged Espresso and Belgian members did not impress. I really enjoyed it and so did the wife, I’d definitely recommend aging this one."
"This made the perfect compliment to a night of Tom Waits tunes."

"O: Another great brew from Great Divide, thoroughly enjoyed this beer, nice warm feeling with every sip."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter, bottled on Mar 28, 2012. This pours a thickish pitch black with a decent mocha tight bubbled head which leaves a glass coating lacing. The smells are of dark chocolate, of dark roasted malts, a little alcohol. The feel is thick and creamy. The taste is great, lots of dark and milk chocolate, nice sweetness milk sugar type of taste, some bitter dark roasted malts. Love it."

"O: Heavy fragrance, flavor, and smooth as well, awesome complexity, a must try"
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is an extremely dark, opaque, brown-to-black coloring with a chocolatey brown colored head that looks slick, sits low, and clings to everything it touches. Aromas are deeply sweet and darkly roasted, with a touch of Mexican drinking chocolate and roasted coffee, with a hint of booze. Flavors are rich and smooth, with a roasted, dark coffee backbone that has bittersweet cocoa highlights. Woody and earthy highlights throughout, it truly feels like you are eating a big, fat chunk of dark chocolate. The aftertaste is bittersweet, with a dark roasting that lasts through to the finish, which lingers behind with a coating along the palate. Strong, solid brew with heavy flavors, a creamy body, and a good, potent punch."

"Chocolate and oak fairly subtle, love the heat in this beer. Just a great beer."

"O- A really nice chocolate beer, very drinkable, the huge chocolate flavors and subtle spice are really nice."
"Overall I was lucky enough to find this albeit out of my own state. This monster was all that I expected and more. The only slight negative was the thin mouthfeel but that is really stretching for a negative. Worth the effort to find this elusive creature."
"A terrific chocolate stout, heartily recommended."
""
"O: Besides Ten Fidy I can not think of many stouts that can compare. Perfect after a salmon dinner and some cherries on top of the glass."
"Pours a very dark black that is entirely impenetrable to light. The gorgeous mocha head attenuates with average speed, but does leave some lovely contrasting brown swirls of bubbles on the black surface of the beer. The aroma is characterized by smoke and coffee, but it can't prepare you for how big the flavor is. This beer is aptly named because it is a monster. Peat smoke dominates as it seems you're drinking a very dark roast barley purée with a magnum hop chaser.  Very resiny hop finish that lingers in the palate. I'm not sure I like it. I respect it. "
""
"A rich and complex brew."
"Overall – An excellent beer, good representation of the American Double/Imperial Stout style. Probably one of the smoothest beers I’ve had in a while, deserved its reputation and everything I had heard about it before hand. Highly recommended, I would buy it and drink it again."
"Overall definitely a treat of a beer much more balanced than the ST Chocolat with smooth and creamy texture that keeps you sipping yet strong anise and coffee notes. It's a tie up between this and espresso yeti both are great beers."

"O: Clean, crisp. Another great offering from the Yeti series. As one of our tasters remarked, ""I could get hurt on this one."""

"O- This was a fantastic beer. Nice chocolate taste that was just the right sweetness. Not too sweet but sweet enough that the taste was great and the abv was well hidden. Not too syrupy which I hate with some imperials. The oak adds nice character to the beer adding a vanilla taste that blends well with the chocolate taste. After having the Espresso Yeti, I would have to say the Chocolate is just as good."
"O: Just an all-around great beer the flavor is intense but very delicious. Not very beers have the flavor profile this beer does. Well done Great Divide!"
""

"Pours a pitch black color with a thin cocoa head a really nice looking imperial stout. Smell is definitely of dark, rich chocolate and the alcohol % is evident in the nose but not overwhelming. Roasty, smooth chocolate flavors mouth feel is creamy and delicious. Alcohol booziness isn't really there could easily put this whole bottle back quicker then most Imperial Stouts... Definitely want to try the other versions of this beer."

"Overall: Drinks phenomenal, but the chocolate part of this chocolate brew is a little lost on me. I thought I would be obliterated by cocoa and instead I was left wondering just how much of those ""cocoa nibs"" they threw in the kettle. A great beer indeed, but not that much better than the other Yeti versions."
"Looks like the other Yeti variations - black, menacing, thick, delicious. High quality dark chocolate comes from all angles and actually seems to outshine the intense dark roasted malt characteristics. Coffee and char, toffee, caramel, and a big hit of cayenne on the back of the tongue. All the Yetis are great, but I think chocolate may be my least favorite. The cayenne accentuates the chocolate in the first few ounces, but detracts from the rest of the bomber and even begins to build up a bit of burn at the end. 4-6 oz with dessert or an authentic birrieria would be perfect."
""
"Very good beer to try, though the cocoa nib bitterness and cayenne pepper are too much for me. Chocolate so prominent in the name threw me for a loop. I was thinking that I was getting a big chocolaty version of Yeti that would suit my wife to a tee, but got much more in the bargain. I can imagine a neophyte grabbing this beer with similar reasoning and not liking it. I wouldn't buy this one again but glad I tried it. Great Divide is a great brewery and this is a well done beer that I'm sure if perfect for someone. Back to just plain and spectacular Yeti for me."
""
""
"O - Overall a very good impy stout. The cayenne plays off the chocolate nicely and really gives this some extra dimension, character and balance. Peppery to the point where it is easily noticed but doesn't leave you scrambling for something to take the heat away either...just about perfect balance there. Sweet, chocolatey, vanilla and peppers combine to make this a really good stout."

"Poured into a 20 oz Duvel tulip glass, bottled on 3/29/12. Pours a slick pitch black with a 3 inch mocha head, plenty of webby lacing. Smell is loads of roasted dark chocolate, some coffee, molasses, and vanilla. Taste is huge roasted dark chocolate and it lingers, some may say one dimensional, but I think it is crazy good, like every other Yeti I have had. Body is large, kind of dry, plenty of life, and oh it goes down easy. I have been saying it for too long, but if I could have only one Brewery make stouts it would probably be Great Divide or maybe Founders, top notch again."
"Overall a FANTASTIC stout with an interesting pepper blast on the back of your tongue."

"DELICIOUS, TREAT YOURSELF!"

"Pours a jet black with a beautiful mocha crown that's 2-3 fingers. Left a few ounces in the bottle. The nose is a BEAUTIFUL dark chocolate scent. A tad of sweetness makes it like...a liquid Special Dark. There's some lovely vanilla roasted in. Great nose. The taste is roasty, but the sweetness tempers it considerably. I hate the burnt taste of a stout that's roasty and nothing more. However, the chocolate really shapes this up nicely. The mouthfeel is thick, rich, and smooth. Straight butter. The finish is bitter, even a bit hoppy. The aftertaste lingers for a considerable period of time. Overall...this is right up there with the Espresso Yeti as my favorite of the Yeti's...and represents one of the finer stouts out there in general. Very nice."
""
"Overall, an exceptional, delicious beer that is worth the price. A great beer to sip and enjoy, and like I said, this goes down smooth."
""
"O: A excellent cocolate quality, I would say a dessert beer to be enjoyed by the fire."
"O: Very good. Maybe the best Yeti I've had. I love chocolate so maybe I'm biased. Need to do a Yeti side by side."
""
"Pours dark black with a big mocha head and nice lacing. Smells rich and sweet of melted dark chocolate and roasted malts and just a touch woody. Flavor matches the aroma quite well with the dark, bittersweet chocolate in the forefront, some roastiness there, some oak, and some alchohol showing itself as well. A nice full, creamy mouthfeel to this. Overall, not usually a chocolate stout fan but this one is a definite winnier. Best of the Yeti series that I have so far tried."
""
""
""
"Glad I aged this for a year (okay, fine...364 days. Give me a break, I couldn't wait.). Wish I would of done a side-by-side pour with a fresh Choco Yeti, but this beer is good enough to remember next time I step back into the Yeti's playground."
""
"Rich thick and creamy like other yetis but the flavor seems kind of off. Well blended flavors of big roasted malts dark bitter chocolate and minty and piney hops that resonate throughout the sip. For being aged the hops are still quite present and unfortunately don't play off the oak, dark chocolate, and malt all so well. The oak covers up some of the sweeter bits I was expecting more of out of the beer. Layered yet blended in an odd way. The lack of chocolate and the abundance of oak really throw the beer through a loop. It's not bad, but it is a strange sensation. More time to age may make this one of the best beers ever though letting some of the oak and hops mellow out letting some of that chocolate really shine through. Some burnt characteristics work well but overall the oak is the star rather than the chocolate. The hops work nicely though as a big bitter finish reminding you that this is a Russian Imperial Stout. I'll see how laying one down goes. Unfortunately this yeti didn't meet the standard 5 star rating. Still very good as a standard RIS though."
"O: not quite my style of stout, but it's delicious still. Tobacco is rampant in this with the mixture of the hops and roasted malts. Would be a fantastic beer for a cigar."
"Taste is thick and heavy, sweet ,finishes dry kinda spicy sorta crazy for me but a very nice beer ."
""
"O: A bit heavy on the oak, but a great balance of sweet milk chocolate, oak, bitter dark chocolate, and roastiness. I'm a fan."
"Pours a very dark brown color bordering on black with a thin mocha head and a bit of light lace on the edges of the glass. The nose is really nice with quite a bit of chocolate as well as some light booze. There’s a bit of vanilla there as well as a slight bit of oak. The flavor is really chocolate forward, with a tiny oak presence, though that makes its way known more in the mouth feel. Really full body. A bit heavy viscous and oily. Some smooth vanilla is there in the finish. The finish also brings a touch of the pepper and I can’t say that it really adds to the beer, but it's interesting."
"one of my favorites in the yeti series. this one pours very thick and oil colored, with a wild lacey mocha colored head that has good retention. smells like an imperial stout, strong and roasty to burnt. the chocolate doesnt make a huge appearance in the nose, but there is some subtle bittersweetness there. flavor has an almost hersey's syrup chocolate flavor to it, which is reduced in potency by the oak flavors that come into play. it ends up tasting quite nice, but its not as chocolately as i would have expected. all the robust flavors of the yeti remain intact. mouthfeel is nice, but this is a sipper and a bomber to share. huge body and alcohol burn remind you that its a monster. overall an excellent beer, and one to be enjoyed with close friends."
"O: This Yeti is good but the base beer just isn't my favorite...still a nice stout overall."
"Overall this is so good, little much on the cayenne but a great balance nonetheless. Will definitely drink again. Recommended."

"Poured from bomber bottled Mar 21, 2012 to pint glass April 3, 2012 the beer arrives an opaque deep black with black edges. It's like light is absorbed by the beer. A nice 2.5 finger slightly tan khaki head, excellent retention and lacing, this looks great. The nose is that of roasted malts, sweet malt, a hint of alcohol, a hint of chocolate, and a hint of booze. Oak takes a back seat. Similarly the flavor is full bodied and rich and dominated by roast with a subtle yet satisfying smooth malt sweetness coupled with chocolate. If I didn't know this was oak aged I wouldn't guess as there isn't much oak character. It's good though in flavor, though the heat is a bit forthcoming. Finishes so creamy and smooth with a lingering mild bitter chocolate sweetness. Overall, not my favorite version of Yeti though still a tremendous beer."
""
""
"O: Good drinkability, just like the rest of the Yeti's I've had, it hides the abv really well. I think this is my favorite of the Yeti family. I could probably do without the cayenne, but it does keep it interesting and adds a nice twist."
"O- A magically robust yet drinkable stout. Balanced between bitter chocolate; hops; and a touch of coffee. The oak and vanilla (along with that hint of cayenne) add extra layers of complexity that take this beer to another level. I love GD's Yeti in all its various forms, but this one just might be the best.... This year's version, anyway."
""
""
"There is noticeable burn from the pepper and alcohol. Some of that goes to help balance the sweetness, but fresh I find this a bit too all over the place. Still, big, complex, and tasty. Beers like this make me wonder why I even bother hunting down the rarer releases."

"overall great bear better than average very intense"
"Okay, this was the last of the Yeti series (minus Barrel Aged) that I had yet to try. Wish I had reviewed them all to determine my favorites. The Chocolate Oak Aged is an incredible beer. Hard to say if I like it more than Espresso Oak Aged. If you see it, you pick it up. End of story."

"We had this one after the Belgian style Yeti and this Chocolate version is WAY BETTER! The chocolate brings this beer on a higher level, simple but good beer."

"Flavor wise the oak starts to come out. The chocolate is in there too but its really well blended in with the rest of the flavors that are going on. Its a very well balanced imperial stout, not too boozy and the oak isn't overpowering. It finishes on an oaky, licoricey note that lingers on your tongue. Just wish it had a little more chocolate in it. Its pretty thick, but also has a kind of slick quality too it."

"When stouts like this are so accessible anywhere anytime, why is it we behave like jackasses trying to get our hands on limited release stouts?"
"O- my least favorite of the yeti varieties, but still a good impy stout. Fairly one dimensional."
"Really nice brew. I had this (coincidentally) alongside Mikkeller's Beer Geek Brunch Islay Edition, which was also an excellent beer, for very different reasons. While it had smoke and interest, and craziness, this has a gorgeous smoothness and a wonderful integration. I find it difficult to split the two. These are both phenomenal beers."
"This was great. It was so smooth and deep that all you could do was savor it."
"I love Yeti, period. And while the Espresso version is still my favorite this one comes in at a close second."
"Absolutely fantastic brew. Great Divide never disappoints."
"Overall - A great brew overall. Great Divide hits the nail on the head yet again. One of my favorite breweries out there. I must admit I've passed this and all the other Yeti variations many a time in the stores and thought about getting them, but I've been more focused on more limited beers and specialty releases. All this time, look at what's been right below my nose. With a recent scare that Great Divide would be pulling out of my area, I think I'm learning to appreciate them more and more while they are still around. Bottom line is that if you've got a taste for a big bold stout that's a bit different from the rest, give this baby a try. Hell, give all the Yetis a try and give all the Great Divide beers a try. I think the majority of them are stupendous and all of them are at least worth a try once!"
"Poured out like a nice thick ale, it’s a black color with strong brown hues, a thin dark tan head that quickly dissipates into a thin ring around the glass. It has some decent lacing looks like an ale fit for a king. The aroma is nice and sweet with caramel undertones mixed in with tootsie rolls, I also picked up a slight soy sauce aroma coming from it(this kind of scared me for a bit). Its taste is just wonderful, its got lots of sweet chocolate flavors mixed in with some dark fruits and is a bit tart on the tongue. It has a nice semi sweet and chocolaty after taste with just a mild hint of alcohol."
"Pours an oily black. Brown and fluffy head that does not quit. Aromas are a blast of chocolate. Like sticking your face in a Valentine's day chocolate box. Dark brownie batter and sweet milk chocolate blend well. Subtle notes of oak and vanilla. A smooth transition of flavors across the palette. Rich dark chocolate, coffee and vanilla then creamy smooth milk chocolate. The finish is burnt oak and bakers chocolate bitterness. I'm may eat too much spicy food but the peppers were not apparent for me."
"O: A little too much carbonation for me, but the flavors were nice and I like the different chocolates I was able to taste."
"Pours a dark black with a medium-large espresso-colored head. Scent is very woody with a lot of chocolate, espresso, and molasses. A hint of vanilla. Taste is just as it smell, but with a ton of oak/wooden characteristics and vanilla. A hint of toffee and burnt malt as well. Mouthfeel is full bodied with a creamy finish. Drinkability is scary-high (as with all the Yetis). Overall, it's a Yeti...what do you expect?"
"O: Would have been a 4.5 for me if not for the pepper. Don't know if it was the age on the bottle that made the cayenne a bit too potent for me or not. Would be excellent w/o so much peppery bite."
"Note: It isn't that I don't like pepper and chcolate as a combination. One of my favorite chocolate bars is the Lindt Chili and Dark Chocolate. But somehow the Cayenne and Dark Chcolate flavors in this beer just don't quite mesh well for me."
"I need more Great Divide Beers!"
"A good beer that I had been saving for review 400. While enjoyable, the bitter, burnt roasted barley character is very strong that I feel that this beer MUST be paired with either meat or creamy dessert to break up the harsh dark chocolate character."
"Wow very mellow in the mouth and delicious. Light oak with some wood tannins, bitter bakers chocolate, milk chocolate, cocoa, vanilla, burnt caramel, roasted yams, mollasses, burnt sugar, alcohol, a mocha like creaminess, thick viscous, complex and a long finish. Delicious."
"Overall this is a pretty good variation of Yeti, definitely fun to try."
"Overall: Wasn't expecting the cayenne, but love the impact it has on this beer"
"Cheers!"
"cheers"
"Decent, but nothing really overwhelmed me. However if you're a fan of chocolate stouts, still worth trying."
"Overall, this is a cash money beer. Glad I picked this one up on a whim regardless of some of the criticism this beer has been getting from the cayenne. This was one hell of a rich, decadent, chewy, viscous motha fuckin stout. Cheers bitches!"
"O: This has lots of delicious bitter wood/chocolate/coffee flavors, balanced nicely by a round, smooth, texture that feels soft on the tongue, not harsh or boozy at all. Very delicious!"
"O: As I said before, I was pleasantly surprised by this beer and will definitely be drinking again in the future."
"This tastes very good overall, but the cayenne is a bit overdone."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer, more then the espresso oak aged version. I like the complexity that was added to the beer."
"OVERALL: This was a good beer, but given how outstanding the Yeti series is, when lined up against the other variants, this one stood out as the definite weak link. Not as chocolaty as it could have been, and it is much hotter than the other variants. While the score is definitely respectable, all things considered, this one was actually a disappointment."
"O- Very well done. An excellent balance of everything the drinker was supposed to taste. Though I must say I was glad to be sharing the 22oz bottle with someone. I don' think I would have been able to drink it all on my own."
"O: This is a truly fantastic beer. I have no caveats. It is the perfectly complex balance of roasted and sweet. If you don't like deep, dark roasted flavors, steer clear, but for everyone else, there is nothing bad to say."
"O - Not a great beer, kind of a mess, a hot, not in a good way. Not a beer I'd have again."
"This is a nice big-bodied beer, and really it does burn the mouth. Can't say much about mouthfeel when you are lit up like this. Interesting blend of flavors though and I do find this beer complex in the end."
"This brew pours black with a tiny head that doesn't stick around for long. The aroma is big on roastiness and chocolate, with a bit of a chili spice. The taste is good, it's got a solid roasty presence along with some 70% dark chocolate (not dark as night, but not quite sweet either.) The chili comes in on the backend and isn't quite as cohesive as it could be. It's still good tasting though. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than the other Yetis, and the drinkability is pretty good. Not my favourite Yeti treatment, but not bad by any means."
"Overall, a delicious, complex, and sweet delicacy."
"overall: a very enjoyable imperial stout. not the best i've ever tasted, but it certainly got the job done. nice chocolate and coffee notes made it a slightly different take on the style, but the cayenne pepper gets to be a little much towards the end of the bottle. Still I am happy to give some more props to the brewery that makes one of my favorite amercian beers, old ruffian."
"O - Its strange that I find the boozy quality both to be a bit off putting and at the same time add some quality to the feel. Otherwise this is clearly a well crafted and tasty brew. I would happily revisit."
"Overall- This is a solid beer. The flavor is well-balanced with the chocolate not overpowering the other flavors."
"over all, nice stout would buy again"
"Overall Impression- The top beer I've had this month so far! Awesome body to it, huge amounts of chocolate I've never had before in a beer and is intense all the way through the drink. When John said this was their best beer on-tap, he wasn't kidding! I recommend this even to the non-stout people out there even though it is very viscous. I passed this around a table of all Belgian White/Hefeweizen fans and they all were impressed with my beer!"
"Pours black with a fairly developed tan head. Not too bad considering the wood and abv. Smells of rich dark chocolate with underlying notes of oak and lots of malt. Clean and slightly nutty as well. The taste is good, but slightly less creamy or intense than one would think after the aromas. A bit more oak appears on the finish, lending a spicy note, but otherwise the taste is just a slightly more muted version of the aroma. The beer does have a big mouthfeel, with the alcohol detectable, but there is also a late creaminess to mellow things out a bit. Certainly a solid beer."
"O- Although this was my least favorite of the five Yeti’s it was still enjoyable, would be a much better beer without the cayenne addition, but other than that not bad."
"O: Good, might be better with some age. For me the cayenne was off putting. A straight coffee & chocolate RIS would be great w/out the pepper, so for me, I hope this element fades more. I like chili beers, say Habanero Sculpin, but not in this case, at least fresh. The rest of the elements in the beer are great."
"O- Really similar to the standard Oak Aged Yeti, but being the chocolate fan I am, this edges it out. It also seems a bit more balanced than the original OAY. Extremely tasty beer. Big fan."
"Dr: Tough to drink, even though it's one of me favourite styles. It's just so damn high in alcohol, and that alcohol comes through. It's got a high price tag. It's certainly a sipper, best paired with oysters or strong fish and chips. I do like it, but the drinkability is its lowest factor."
"This is a fantastic beer; one of my favorite stouts of all time."
"Overall a good beer from Great Divide once again. A serious beer for sure, becomes really chewy and sticky on the palate as you work your weigh through the 22 oz bomber, much more so than the original Yeti or the Oak aged Yeti which I can ""easily"" consume 22 oz of. Still good and worth a try especially because it is readily available to most and at a reasonable price point."
"D: this ranks among the best of the yeti expressions, as well as among the best stouts in the market. Absolutely stunning."
"It pours with a wildly dark brown head and a notably thick body. The aroma doesn't give everything away about the taste, which is a sock in the jaw of chile pepper heat and dark chocolate, with some oaky sweetness tying everything together. The chile isn't overwhelming, but it is a great compliment to the chocolate flavor and the beer is helped along by its thick body and milkshake-ish mouthfeel. Better than a lot of extremely hyped, limited imperial stouts out there. Give me this and Ten FIDY and I'll be happy to leave the Dark Lord for you."
"Overall: This is a typical presentation of an imperial chocolate stout. Not recommended for a beginner. The espresso stout is much tamer. Nevertheless, this beer will pair well with cheesecake, homemade brownies, and yes candied bacon ice cream!"
"Overall: Very good beer overall. While the cayenne may not be everyone's cup of tea, I really liked that Great Divide was willing to try it. I would put this up there with the rest of the Yeti stouts. Definitely worth giving a shot."
"D: It's hard to go wrong with any of the yeti. The year and a half in bottle did this one some good of making it more of a chocolate show than a roasted malt performance. Balanced, and delicious."
"O- Great for its style, a little more intense then the regular yeti imperial stout, not super my taste, however I can definitely appreciate it"
"Overall I really enjoyed this. I loved the pepper in this. If you don't like spiciness then you are probably not going to like this. But for those of us that love this in a brew, buy this at will!!"
"Edit: I looked in my kitchen for a sweet dessert to have with this most excellent brew. It warmed in my snifter as I spread an insanely thick layer of peanut butter on a slice of bread. Then a decadent layer of blackberry jam on another slice. Really good with the sweet, creamy sandwich. The cayenne comes alive as this beer warms. I will have this again soon with a nice creamy strawberry cheesecake."
"O: A very enjoyable brew. I may like the original and the other variations better, but there is certainly nothing wrong with this. Recommended."
"Pours a deep, deep mahogany with a two-finger, coffee brown head with a bit of reddish hue. Great head retention and lacing throughout. Aroma of roasted chocolate and a bit of hops... not too strong. Flavor begins with a nice roasted chocolate flavor, not too sweet or syrupy, but the coco is definitely present. Hints of oak before the hops and spice take over. The cayenne is very noticeable and works well to counterbalance the chocolate notes in the beer. Gives it a bit of a hot finish, but the chocolate is not done as it lingers well into the aftertaste."
"Sexy black pour, tan head, and nose rich with dark chocolates and espresso. Wow, what an appetizing appearance and nose! Palate offers huge BITTER chocolate/darkchocolate, cocoa, espresso bitterness, and some detectable hops too in all of this rich, desert-like goodness. Finish is incredibly chocolate bitter. Wow, bitter oh boy, bitter."
"looking to cellar a few of each variety."
"Incidentally, I love that food pairings are listed on the bottle."
"Notes: ""Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti is another revered incarnation of our legendary imperial stout. We toned down the hops a bit to allow cocoa nibs to contribute some pleasing bitterness, while vanilla notes from the oak combine with the cacao to create an aroma and flavor akin to a gourmet chocolate bar. A dash of cayenne keeps things lively, adding just a bit of heat to the finish. Another great Yeti? Hell yes."""
"This is a superb imperial stout though scores low on the value scale."
"Was not expecting this to be such a wild brew, but it certainly threw me for a loop. Chocolate was definitively delivered as promised, but the peppery cayenne stole the show. Great Divide certainly knows how to make their different Yeti incarnations unique and this one lives up to that reputation. A good, solid beer by all accounts, though they should definitely add the cayenne part to the name as it is a major component of this flavorful and surprising brew."
"O - Easily my favorite of the Yeti clan."
"This beer pours a very viscous and oily midnight black in color with a one finger, perfectly even, dark mocha colored head that is both spongy and thick. It is almost sudsy. It looks as good as any good imperial stout could. The beer smells of smooth milk chocolate, lactose, lightly roasted malts, coffee with cream, with an ever so soft bitter finish. It tastes of rich milk chocolate, roasted coffee, cream, has a light bitter bite and finish with a light chile like tingle. The chile aspect lingers in the aftertaste but is really pretty subtle. I'd say it's barely even noticeable. If I hadn't been told to look for it I may have never noticed it. It drinks thick and full in body with a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The chile is an interesting addition but I wish the spice was a little more prevalant. Overall this is a very high quality brew and well worth a try. I recommend it."
"o-first time trying this variant of Yeti. I enjoyed this a lot. The spice was good, and added some intresting finishing flavors to the beer. I think this would do well with some aging. I'll have to find a few more bottles to set in the cellar."
"The spiciness was really surprising here. The oak comes through in a way which is dissimilar from other oak aged beer that I have had."
"A delicious chocolate stout. For my money, this is better than the standard Yeti...and even more chocolatey!"
"O - Very very nice, could use a little cellaring to calm down the hotness, but overall a great beer."
"Overall bitter, but not dry nor particularly rich. Not quite my style, but Russian Imperial Stout means different things for different people. Cellaring is probably a must, but this is quite nice and worth a try if you come across it."
"Overall: This was my favorite beer on tap during barrel aged week. The beer has an amazing flavor profile and wonderful notes of chocolate. Im glad I have one of these I have been again about 5 months now and I would say it is about time to crack it open and have it again. Very nice beer"
"Overall I have to believe something made it into this cask that wasn’t intended. Not nearly as good as on-tap but somehow still drinkable, hopefully I’ll have the chance to try it again uninfected."
"Overall this just a delicious beer. Great balance. Great depth in flavor. I could drink this for breakfast."
"O: Goes well with chocolates and sweet desserts."
"D: Surprisingly good drinkability due to solid mouthfeel."
"Enjoy!"
"#AllYeti'sDay"
"A real flavorful oak aged Double Stout, but extremely young and alcohol heavy. This would do really well after having been laid down for a few years."
"O: Easily the best of the Yeti. I am sad to know GD won't be in MI for much longer."
"Overall this is a great version of the Yeti we've all come to love. If you're a trader outside the Great Divide boundaries, add this one to your wants list, 'cuz she'z a good'n."
"2011 bottle. Dark as night with a medium tan head, which fades to a thin film. This must be had at the right temp. Served just a little too cold will cause to miss complex smell & taste. Smells and tastes of oak and sweet, dark chocolate. Thick bodied and a sipper. Totally worth seeking out."
"O - A step up from the normal Yeti. The extra chocolate was nice but it was the significant oak flavor that really woke this beer up and made it dance. Worth seeking out."
"Overall - Excellent. A sweeter version of the yeti, man the chocolate works so well. Easy to drink, a little to easy being 9.5 %. Might be my favorite yeti so far. Stout fans must try this."
"This can definitely stand its ground with all the other aged imperial stouts in its category (Founders, Shorts, I'm talking to you). The only thing that saddens me about this is the fact that Great Divide will soon be leaving Michigan altogether. Still, this beer will be an excellent reminder what I'll be missing in-state."
"Overall I was expecting more. It is very good, but the bar is very high. Slightly boozy, but that is fine in this style. I think the chocolate will come out as it warms."
"Got this as a fathers day present from my mom. Thanks mom! Pours dark black, 2 inch head. Nose is malt and loads of chocolate, then even more chocolate. The taste, nice sweet choc...holy shit! Wayyy too much cayenne pepper. Lost me totally. I was feelin this beer until that. Nice try on the experimentation, but IMO, swing and a miss. 2 ounces of this would be plenty for me. Mouthfeel would be nice, but the longer it is in my mouth, the more pepper I get. I'm stoked I got to try this, and happy for the gesture from my mom (who when I got into beers, swore she'd never buy me one), but I'm really glad I didn't pay for this one. If you like peppery beers, really peppery beers, then this will be right up your ally. This just isn't for me."
"Great beer all around and a nice oak aged example in that the oak is complimentary versus being dominant. The flavors and aromas come together very nicely in this beer."
"I would definitely be happy to drink a few more of these, and hopefully sooner than later."
"Well this was very full and to be honest it would be hard to drink alot of them simply for that reason however, there was really no hint what so ever of the abv"
"Drinkability is good. This is on the thick side of thick and burnt side of burnt, a little extreme. Can't see drinking this one more than once in a while."
"O- This sure kicks the shit out of normal yeti. I love it."
"Kept it in the fridge. Let it sit out for a minute or two before pouring into the 'Ol Pint Glass."
"Overall: Again, a very nice example of a chocolate stout. I would buy again."
"Honestly in the categories of appearance, smell and taste I preferred the regular oak aged yeti over the chocolate. Espresso is to be reviewed in the near future."
"Overall: This yeti is a true beast! An intense experience but not something I'm going back for."
"O - I was very impressed with this beer and happy to have tried it. Everything balanced well. I definately recommend trying this beer."
"O - Wish I had another bottle at this age so I could try it with 2 years on it and see how much more it mellows. Its still a spicey stout with some good heat, but it delivers exactly what it promises as far as chocolate and barrel goes, but this cayenne is a definate wake up. Really, really delicious."
"D: Delicious paired with chocolate chip cookies. I'd love to have more."
"O: I was very impressed by this beer. I thought the chocolate, peppers, roast, and oak were all balanced extremely well. Just an outstanding brew and one I will be picking up more often. Skal."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew were some of the unexpected highlights through the flavoring. For such a dark stout, and one that is barrel aged, we were not really expecting the bright hop components here and there. Above all, what was most surprising in this regard was the cayenne pepper. While other beers will utilize such intense ingredients it is hard to find a brew with this so masterfully integrated, yet starkly independent throughout the tasting. This is truly a unique beer, standing way out from the rest of the style."
"Poured into my DFH snifter, pours a pitch black color, with solid tan head that fills the top of the glass then recedes slowly. Smell- milk chocolate, cayenne, dark chocolate, coffee, roasty bitterness. Taste- roasty bitterness, dark chocolate, faint hint of cayenne, followed by an ending of roasty bitterness. Mouthfeel- this one is perfect. Nice thickness, nice carbonation, goes down perfectly. Drinkability- this is the best Yeti I have tasted so far. Incredibly impressive."
"O-> Pulled this one out of the cellar on a whim and although I'm glad to have tried it, it needed more time to mellow out. As mentioned this is a bit harsh right now yet I was worried that the Chocolate and other flavors might begin to fade so I decided to try this reasonably ""fresh."" (for a big stout anyway) Not sure if it is the cayenne or what but there is an itchy, spicy tingle in the back of the throat and I'm still not done with this beer. Taste was really interesting and reminded me ever so slightly of Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout, for what it's worth. Needed more time in the cellar in my humble eyes...."
"All the while, keeping all of the previously mentioned flavors present, and somehow getting more bitter. The ABV% is constantly in the background throughout, be ready and enjoy."
"Nose is rich, dark chocolate, roast, molasses and a hint of an earthy spiciness. Flavor follows suits with more prominence given to the dry, spicy character of the cayenne. A real earthy dryness with a slight hint of metallic character, the pleasant taste of the actual cayenne with an ever so slight warming in the finish. Body is sweet and smooth, more bakers chocolate than milk, molasses, light roast. A really different Yeti version. I enjoyed it and would drink it again but it didn't wow me. Thanks Rob!"
"With the exception of the barrel aged ""Yeti"" which I've had the rare privilege to sample different vintages on a couple of different occasions, my favorite off-the-shelf version continues to be the regular oaked-aged ""Yeti."" That said, I'm glad they make this one. Interesting experiment for sure!"
"O - after the first sip, i immediately thought this brew needs some time to round itself out and try and come together for a more smooth transition of flavors and feel. not bad at all though ill put two away and see what a year does because this one is about a month old and needs to grow the fuck up"
"o- A very good chocolate stout, and the oak aging helps it to be more complex than other chocolate beers. However, I think the oak is slightly overdone in this beer. The 9.5% comes out in the beer as it warms, combined with the cayenne , making it less drinkable than i would like in an ideal chocolate stout."
"O: A good brew for someone who loves a bunch of chocolate in a beer that has the consistency of motor oil. That person would be me. Cheers to that!"
"D-Like all of the Yeti's, this is excellent. This is a bit young and hot, but will no doubt mellow into excellence with age. Actually, I think its a real testament to the quality of this stout that it is so drinkable when it is so young. While not terribly complex, the pepper is what makes this a standout. It reminds me of the high quality chocolates sold in the checkout line at my local wine store that feature various spices. It works, and its all good."
"O - Another, unsurprisingly, winner in the line of Yeti variants. Consistent and delicious, like most GD beers."
"Blackness fills the glass topped by a dark brown, creamy chocolate head. Good retention and pretty decent lace. The nose is mostly roasted malt mixed with bitter chocolate, and a touch of caramel. The taste follows but adds a good amount of chocolate and a bit of coffee, vanilla, and wood. There is a nice touch of heat either from booze or cayenne- it's good either way. Full body, medium carbonation, thick mouthfeel, and slightly dry. Great beer! I would love to see how the flavors develop in the cellar as this was fairly fresh."
"This is nearly undrinkable beer. I really hope age helps this (this beer isn’t 30 days old) beer a LOT because right now this is awful. Unless I’m told age resolves this heat, I cannot recommend avoiding this mess enough!"
"O: I've definitely fallen in love with this beer. I might even say it's one of the best stout's I have ever had. I already plan to buy a lot more."
"This excellent beer appears as dark and dense as a black hole. It has an excellent chocolate- like head. The aroma on the nose reminds me of a chocolate milk shake. The taste does not disappoint with a strong chocolate taste that finishes with a mild spicy kick from the added cayenne pepper. Bought it at the Ithaca Coffee Roasters in Ithaca, NY"
"Great example of the style. Incredible at room temperature."
"overall this an awesome imperial stout. not up there with the best of the best (probably not even my favorite from the yeti series) but still a first-rate beer."
"O: Great Divide's Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti is a slightly above-average take on the style. It falls well short of the best of class: CCB Hunaphu's and FFF Dark Lord De Muerte. Still, it is a reasonably enjoyable and widely available spicy imperial stout. "
"This stuff was only like $6.50. Gotta love that."
"O: This is one hell of an imperial stout. I think I prefer the Espresso Oak Aged Yeti by a small margin, but this is certainly a head-turner in its own right. This thing paired with a sumptuous raspberry chocolate tart or cheesecake, or even a nice thick marbled porterhouse would be out of this world."
"O: Overall, I enjoyed but I have thought more of the Espresso and Oak based a bit better. The Chocolate does not come through as much as I would have expected or liked. With that said, a really nice sipping,coco nibbed stout."
"Incredible beer. Easily top 5 all-time for the imperial stout category."
"D - Wow, great drink; I love this stuff; right balance of roasted malt and chocolate flavors; love the deep blast of unique flavors; I've have many more"
"Overall: My experience with this one was a let-down. The bitterness lasted throughout the finish without enough sweetness to offset it. And I would have liked more heat presence from the cayenne."
"GRRR....I was wrong, I never reviewed the bretty yeti although I did have it. I leave reviews like that to a real hardcore tickers out there...you know who you are."
"Overall, chocolate sweetness is nice, tasty, and drinkable. A dessert sipper perfect for any occasion"
"I gave this one a couple of months to mellow; it's good the way it is, but I suspect it will be much better with a year or more on it. Good thing I stashed away another bottle..."
"Pours deep and dark with a great coloring of head. The smell is a great mixture of chocolate, espresso, and something very earthy as well. The oak ageness really shines through on the first taste. Vanilla and oak mixes with the chocolate and espresso flavors of the beer. The alcohol kicks really well at the end of your swig. Taste is a little to espresso driven but still very good. I'm sure it would be better with more age. This beer goes done super smooth and feels great. Great Divide has done it again!"
"My third of the Yeti series (still need regular Yeti and BA Yeti), and definitely one of the best"
"Overall this is a great try. It is definitely worth grabbing one to enjoy."
"O - I really don't know how anybody could not love the Yeti series. These are just great beers and wonderful variations."
"This was a great stout. Pitch black with a dark brown head. Got a lot of mocha and chardness on smell didn't get much oak or vanilla though. taste is of dark chocolate, dark malt, woodiness, and some vanilla at the back which really made it smooth. Really easy drinker for 9.5% and such a complex flavor, I could drink a couple of these and not be sick of it."
"Picked this up at a great beer store, Majestic Liquor, in Dallas. Pours as thick and black as motor oil with a creamy, caramel-colored one finger head with great lacing and decent retention. Roasted malt and dark chocolate dominate the awesome nose with hints of vanilla, oak, burnt espresso, and alcohol. The taste is much the same. Roasty malt, dark chocolate, vanilla from the oak, and an awesome bite from the cayenne. It doesn't get much better! I'm a huge fan of chocolate and hot peppers so this is right up my alley. Had no idea when I bought it that it had the cayenne pepper in it. Although lots of reviewers have criticized it, I find it a welcome and unique twist. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy with a nice bitter finish. The cayenne is subtle at first, but really stands out as it warms. A very surprising and unique beer that I will definitely seek out again."
"This is a wonderful, luscious, and full flavoured RIS that could have been so much more had the cayenne peppers been toned down. I do like how they further the roasty and dry characteristics of the beer but it becomes a bit too much as I continue sipping it. Although it is detectable, the chocolatey sweetness struggles to take center stage throughout with the spiciness demanding attention almost from start to finish. This is still a great RIS nonetheless and I would love to see how this ages."
"O – A very interesting beer, but I'm not fond enough of it to seek this $10 bomber out again. And yet makes me want to try the espresso yeti. Drinkability is taken back by all the character in this beer, a very slow sipping brew for me. 3.5"
"Full body, decent carbonation, silky smooth and really pleasurable on the palate. Drinks fantastic, a bit sweet but if you like chocolate, it's tough to miss here."
"Enjoyable and drinkable offering from Great Divide. Loved it."
"Poured opaque black with a nice finger of tan head that receded to a tiny film. Roasted malts and chocolate in the aroma mostly. Very roasty malts on the tongue, with dark chocolate and some bitter coffee, vanilla and oak in the background. Alcohol is moderately noticeable and there's a slightly bitter aftertaste. Medium-heavy mouthfeel, and very drinkable as a session ender."
"Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti pours an impenetrable black. About two fingers of caramel head come together to top the beer, which seems to be a lot for this glass. Retention is good, the last bit of foam never quite fades, but lacing is underdeveloped. The nose is a bit straightforward, gobs of milk chocolate with a hint of roasted grain. A lack of complexity can at least in part be made up for by potency, but the aroma isn't anywhere near pungent enough to pull that off. Once the beer warms though, a bit of the cayenne pepper becomes a welcome addition. The rich chocolaty flavors almost completely override the bitter roasted grain on my palate. Oak aging is barely appreciable, aside from maybe some vanilla contributing to the milk chocolate notes. Due to the initially muted aroma, I had forgotten about the cayenne added to the beer, but it's present from the start. It's barely noticeable up front, but slowly builds to a fairly peppery close. The heat is a bit intense at first, but as the beer finishes warming the rich milk chocolate extinguishes some of the burn and the cayenne settles down to a perfectly mild complementary note. I'd say the first half of the bottle rates about a 3.5 for taste and the second a 4.5, just from the variation in prominence of the cayenne, and so the beer as a whole ends up in the middle. The body, while creamy and smooth, is not as rich as I might have expected. That may be for the better though, as it seems the carbonation struggles at times to cut through the beer's maltiness. The end result though is a mouthfeel that's decent, but not as decadent as I might have anticipated. Overall Chocoloate Oak Aged Yeti was a solidly enjoyable drinking experience, especially once I got to the second half of the bottle. Between this and Hunahpu's, chillies are becoming one of my favorite additions to a stout."
"O: I had this beer with a meal and it was complementary to the appetizer and entree. While I appreciate the addition it made to the meal experience, I certainly wouldn't continue to drink it post meal."
"Full bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is surprisingly drinkable. It is creamy but not sticky with decent mouth-coating."
"Cheers..."
"1/29/2011"
"overall - great RIS, looks great, tastes better."
"You want thickness? You got it. This iteration of Yeti boasts a sizable, er, size. I find it a touch overcarbonated on-tap, however. Overall, this beer is on par for me with the Espresso Oak Aged Yeti. Both editions are an improvement for me over the disjointed, too hoppy, standard version of Yeti. Don't hesitate to try this beer if you see it at a bar or store shelf near you."
"Overall this is a great beer, and glad I got the chance to enjoy it. I would love to get a bottle or two to sit on and see how the flavors blend together."
"D- Overall, the beer is a little unbalanced with cayenne, but that's acceptable given it was bottled only one month ago. Seriously, your lips burn after a bomber. Get a few of these for the cellar because it is going to be phenomenal once the heat dies down and the flavors blend together with time."
"O: A doozy sipper - that’s for sure. Good stuff, and hard to tell its 9.5% from the taste. This one’s a bit too oaky for me - I prefer the regular Yeti."
"O: This is a wonderful beer that I might actually like as much or more than Sexual Chocolate (gasp). Probably my overall favorite chocolate stout, and is worlds ahead of Southern Tier's offering. Glad I had a whole bomber to enjoy."
"Overall: I like that Great Divide really tweaked the Yeti recipe for this one, by adding oak chips, cocoa nibs and cayenne, while lowering the hops. However, while I admire the ambition, the cayenne ultimately prevents this from being a world class Imperial Stout for me."
"O- A good beer, but not world class, and not my favorite Yeti. Still, this one is worth picking up if you like the style. Glad I got to try it..."
"O - Overall this is a brilliant beer, but perhaps a step below the standard Oak Aged Yeti. The chocolate is wonderful, but it drowns out some of the other flavors a little, resulting in a somewhat less balanced beer. A touch too hot, due to the inclusion of the cayenne. While the cayenne is a big detractor, I still find this beer just as irresistible as every other version of Yeti. A fascinating take on one of my all-time favorites."
"Overall is a god beer but I'm not sure I'll buy this one again."
"Overall this is a very nice addition to the Yeti lineup and I would certainly recommend it to anyone that enjoys these Imperial Stouts, you won't be disappointed. Enjoy!!!"
"A good beer, and a very interesting take on chocolate imperial stouts. I must say, I was more than a little worried when I found out that there was cayenne pepper in this beer, but it's pretty subtle compared to the other flavors in the beer. I now know why they don't advertise this as ""Chocolate-Cayenne Oak Aged Yeti"" - because I think it would be a turn-off for a lot of people, especially considering the cayenne is just a small percentage of the overall flavor. I'd definitely drink this again!"
"Dark black body and a bubbly brown 1 inch of head. Some of the chocolate and cayenne comes through in the aroma but it's nothing real impressive. Tastes better than it smells. The taste isn't really different, just stronger. This is a pretty boring stout without the cayenne. Perhaps I'm just expecting too much."
"Overall its good, nothing too great. Seek out, but don't expect the world."
"Still, smooth and silky in the mouthfeel. Very little notice of the alcohol. Decent overall, but I would prefer less cayenne. I'd like to try this with some age on it and see if the flavors blend a little better."
"T: There's a pretty big roasted characteristic in here along with a slightly burnt flavor and some dark chocolate. The finish brings some hop bitterness and a slight bit of heat from the cayenne. This was my first Yeti and I'll definitely be seeking out some of the others very soon."
"Pours a thick motor oil black with a huge 3 inch dark chocolate colored head. Lots and lots of ring lacing around the glass on the drink down. Smells of dark cocoa powder, roasted coffee beans, oak chips, and vanilla extract. The taste is dark chocolate, chocolate covered espresso beans, earthy wood, and spicy chili powder. It's interesting to see that they added cayenne to this beer as I think that it would be great even without it. Mouthfeel is super thick and creamy with low carbonation. There is a burn in the throat that could either be from the alcohol or the cayenne. Overall, this is an extremely good stout and another great Yeti variant. I am glad I have a few extra bottles in the cellar."
"Overall this is excellent. It's bitter but not too dry and the creamy mouthfeel really fits it well. Very full flavored and enjoyable, but it's a sipper."
"Finished up a tasting recently with this brew. Ended up splitting the bottle three ways into snifters. The brew had a finger worth of dark coco colored head sitting on top of a black bodied brew. The head laced perfectly in the glass, it’s a beautiful stout. You get a great amount of coco nibs coming at you in the nose. I didn’t get much in the way of wood or barrel at all I even asked another Geek with me and he couldn’t pull any either I think the coco is just that strong. The flavor was perfect for a chocolate stout. This one is done right. The brew wasn’t sweet milk chocolaty but reminded me of a good piece of dark chocolate with a little pepper spice thrown in. It had a great mouthfeel to it thick and coating on the tongue. I enjoyed this brew and after a few sips I sparked a good cigar (JDN Antano dark Corojo) to go with it and this brew just worked perfectly with it."
"There are a lot of things to like about this beer. The cayenne is a really interesting touch. And I think folks who appreciate more highly hopped stouts might like it a lot. It's still good. But for me, it would be more enjoyable if the flavors were in better balance."
"Overall, I love Mayan chocolate blends when it comes to just about anything. I feel the chocolate should be the star with a supporting cast of pepper just to provide a little kick and keep things interesting. This brew was the opposite though, especially as you drink more of it, the pepper just dominates everything."
"Overall this is great. A bit more chocolate and this is an A plus in my book."
" O- Not my kind of imperial stout, but a very well crafted one, there are not random tangents and I can respect the brewery, being its my first. Overall, didn't like the whole beer."
"A wonderful combination of flavors that are balanced extremely well. Wonderful chocolate character that isn't too overbearing, and the cayenne adds so much to the overall flavor. Liked this more than the espresso Yeti; next up, the ""regular"" oak aged."
"This beer pours a thick black with a finger of tan head that retains and laces well. The aroma has notes of roasted barley and bitter chocolate. The taste begins with cayenne pepper and then moves to bitter chocolate and coffe grounds. The mouthfeel is nice and balanced with a velvety ending. This beer is amazing and should be tried."
"I still love you little brother Yeti."
"overall: a little disappointed. I bought this and put it back for a year. What could possibly be wrong with a chocolate oak aged imp stout? Nothing wrong, but after KBS and Southern Tier, the bar is higher."
"Overall - I still think the espresso aged yeti is my favorite in the series thus far. I still need to try the vanilla."
"D: definitely one of the best out of the yeti series and was pretty strong on the oak how I like it. IMO the espresso is the best."
"Overall a tasty beer but regular oak aged yeti is the best IMO"
"O: Hope this gets more complex over time, this bottle was from the newest batch. Will celler my others and taste them over time."
"O: A big beer for sure, I just wish the flavour had some more nuance. While it tastes good, it's one-dimensional. Frankly when I found out this beer had cayenne pepper in it, I was shocked since it's nowhere to be found in the actual flavour. Hopefully, some more nuance will come out with some age. Nevertheless, you certainly get what's advertised, and it's a good beer even if I seem like I'm harping on it; I quite enjoyed it."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. Overall I'd say this was my favorite of the Oak Aged Yetis as the sawdust feeling of oak in the flavor is minimized here. Unfortunate, as normally I like the flavors that oak and barrels impart, but this series just took to a new, uncomfortable level."
"O: Not as good overall as the coffee or fresh yeti, but better than oak aged. A bit of a miss here for more. I loved the fresh Yeti, and was expecting these to take it to another level, none of which did. Perhaps the barrel aged Yeti will change my mind."
"Overall - Very good! The beer is very complex but every flavor shines through well. It's smooth and frankly delicious. Definitely worthy of the Yeti banner. If you like heavy stouts with chocolate notes, this beer is totally for you."
"I wish life were like a box of Chocolate Oak Aged Yetis. When I first had this beer fresh I was dazzled; while the beer seems to have lost some luster aging since then it is still nothing short of what I'd consider a truly special stout. I've a standing order to always buy whatever Great Divide I can find and that's doubly applied to any Yeti spin-offs."
"O - a not strong in flavor and alcohol feel for more than one."
"We lined this up against a 3 year old Yeti. There was no comparison this bad boy was king. Very drinkable and wonderful."
"After the first pour, I think the highlight of this beer is the cayenne! Its a very good chocolate stout, but I enjoyed the heat!"
"Much enjoyed Christmas present from a good friend. Curious, I'd like to get it again at some point and age it for another year to see if it mellows out even more."
"The feel of the beer is smooth. I know a lot of people really like these Yetis but they don't seem to be my...cup of tea. I know they're good but I prefer other stouts to the Yeti."
"Matt"
"D-definately want more. Well balanced, smooth, excellet."
"D: Great drinking imperial stout that is pretty sweet and very hard to put down. Will be coming back for more and more of this."
"This is good overall, but not really the best example of a barrel-aged chocolate double stout. I probably wouldn't buy it again."
"Drink- A really nice flavorful stout variation. The three yeti's I have had were very good. I think I should have gotten the oak aged 1st as to not be let down on flavor."
"Pours jet black with a very small tan head. Medium lacing on the glass. Smell is of faint chocolate and molasses. The taste is of rich chocolate and cream with a little licorice at the end. This tastes like alcoholic chocolate milk. There is definitely some alcoholic burn in the mouthfeel, but in a good way. If it wasn't there I would of downed this beer in 2 seconds and at nearly 10% that would be dangerous. My favorite version of Yeti without a doubt."
"O: Not bad. Love the balance with a great level of bitterness. Sweet and full of complex espresso and dark chocolate."
"Very good but also very sweet."
"Body is medium to heavy. Moderate amount of carbonation help the drinkability but the combination of flavor profile and alcohol content make it difficult to finish this bottle alone. The peppery finish takes away from the overall drinkability and in the end hurts the score on this one. Overall a nice brew and I'm glad to have tried it. I would like to see what some age did to this one."
"M/D: Full-bodied, very dense. Pretty easy to drink, but it fills you up, and even though you want to drink more, your stomach says no. I had this paired with a triple chocolate cake and the pairing was unbelievable. They complemented each other so well. I look forward to having this one again."
"D: A nice Imperial Stout - you would probably like this one. For my taste; a little to much smoke and oak."
"Finishes without any lingering aftertaste and exceedingly drinkable."
"For this being such a big and crazy beer, it is pretty darn drinkable. It is definitely not a chugging beer, but it goes down much easier than I expected. I really dig the spice and find that this is an excellent chocolate stout. Once again Great Divide does a fantastic job."
"This is nicely drinkable beer considering the addition of cayenne and the alcohol content. In fact, the component ingredients do a nice job covering said alcohol amount. The journey from about 50 degrees to room temperature is a fun one, as the character of the beer changes a lot in that range. This is a brew that I will look for again and is a complex and enjoyable sipper."
"Very drinkable but heavy. Good, complex stout."
"The chocolate aspect on this is quite good although I'm not the biggest fan of the cayenne addition. At the very least it makes for an interesting brew."
"Pours like a lightweight motor oil, with a thin, very dark tan head. Very dark almost black. Chocolate, and a little malt and alcohol on the nose. Drinking it, I didn't get as much chocolate as I expected, and the cayenne wasn't as present as I expected either. The oak was there, and it was quite pleasant."
"This one pours a dark chocolate brown with not much head. I dumped it in fairly hard to get a half inch. Smells lightly of chocolate and malt, and tastes like a middle of the road imperial stout with a slight hint of chocolate. Not bad, no flaws, not great, but pretty good. Wouldn't turn down a free one, but wouldn't go out of my way for another."
"Really well blended, the high alcohol content is not even noticed. Smooth and creamy texture, a real pleasure to drink. Definately worth the price. One for special occassions, and would undoubtedly age well."
"Overall: I really enjoy beers that have chocolate and spicy flavors together, so i was excited to try this beer. The drinkability was hurt by the overabundant spicyiness from cayenne. Could have used more chocolate flavor. It was still enjoyable and i will buy more when it is released in 2011. i liked espresso oaked yeti better!"
"D - I like drinking this, but it's a little too powerful to be exceptionally drinkable. The heat from the cayenne that sticks in your mouth does make you want another sip, and the combined heat with the alcohol does have a pleasant warming effect as it goes down."
"Another decadent take on the Yet Imperial Stout here, with plenty of rich sweetness that was well balanced by a sturdy wall of roasted malt and hops plus the cayenne pepper addition was a welcome surprise that I didn't expect. I picked up plenty of vanilla and wood as well in the profile, so I was happy to see that the oak chips didn't get shortchanged either. This had a great all around balance to it and would make a great dessert beer. I didn't expect to like this one as much as I did but it really won me over."
"all in all I would highly recommend this beer to anyone who is a fan of imperial stouts."
"Yeah, really bad beer here. Ive had all the other Yeti's too and loved them. This one not so good. Seems to be a spicy hoppy bitter chocolate mess. Was way too hoppy for any of the other flavors to shine through. Maybe some age would do it good, but really not an enjoyable beer the way I had it."
"Overall impression: An odd brew fresh; perhaps it would benefit from some aging. Then again, a base for a marinade might be the best use of this stuff."
"I was afraid this Oak Aged Yeti would have an over-powering chocolate presence; however the chocolate is subtle, natural, and only one of multiple layers of flavor. With the smooth feel, and alcohol-warmth, the flavor is well suited to a dessert beer, a late night relaxer, or a winter warmer."
"Salud!!"
"D - Another excellent drinking beer. Take it slow. Enjoy."
"D: Drinkability is low, but not because this is a bad beer, it is actually quite delicious. It is low because it is a relatively heavy beer and you will prob fill up with the bomber and due to how rich the flavor is, this beer should be enjoyed with others."
"D- This beer is a nice drinker flavorwise. The ABV and heavy feel to this limits it overall sadly though. One of my favorites in the Yeti series. I would love to split this with a fellow beer drinker."
"Drinkability is high, for a while, then you just get full. The flavors are so rich that one bomber was way too much. I would liken it to an ice cream sundae... a single scoop is nice, but a five-scoop sundae just makes you feel gross by the end. I should have shared this with a couple others."
"Not sure I could drink too many of these. While the alcohol is well-masked by the mole, this beer is a bit overwhelming. Maybe it would be better shared?"
"Drinkability -- This was a pleasant surprise, actually. The cayenne was a nice addition. There's just enough spicy heat to cut the mild chocolate sweetness and elevate the beer out of the realm of 'just another chocolate stout.'"
"22oz bottle poured into my 22oz glass. For this beer I made sure my palate was clean since I haven't eaten in a while. Poured black with dark brown head. I can definitely smell some chocolate. When I took my first sip I noticed the cayenne immediately. It took a while for me to pick up the chocolate taste but I noticed it. I think the cayenne is a nice touch and that's what sets it apart from other chocolate stouts or oak aged stouts. As others said it's good for sipping since the pepper will eventually overload you if you gulp unless you like spicy stuff."
"Overall a great stout. Not my favorite of the yeti series but still great like the other yeti's."
"Poured 22 ounce bottle: Nice aroma with the chocolate and really sets up the flavor. A deep dark brown almost black color very opaque with a tall milk chocolate head and good retention. Obviously chocolate taste but the spicy cayanne finish is amazing. Lightened hop bitter taste with some alcohol presence. Nice full body sits well on the tongue with an oily texture but a little abrubt on the finish with the cayanne. Really nice stout and one you want to sip and enjoy or the spicy finish can overwhelm. Great after dinner."
"The flavor is really chocolate-centric with a tiny oak presence, though that makes its way known more in the mouthfeel. Really nice and thick body. A bit heavy for all that much of. Some smooth vanilla is there in the finish. The finish also brings a touch of the pepper and I can't say that it really adds to the beer; in fact, it might detract a bit."
"I really don't know what to think, at first I wasn't very impressed, then the cayenne picked up and I really enjoyed it but as I progress through the bottle the cayenne has become over bearing and distracting. While the chocolate is there, I feel this should be advertised as spiced chocolate stout."
"D: This is a sipping beer for me, Not something I would drink on a regular basis. As the beer warms up.. the chocolate taste becomes less bitter and more sweet."
"pitch black, dark brown head, excellent lacing. the bottom of the glass shows hints of carbonation. smell is overwhelmingly of really dark chocolate and the dark fruit notes that it brings. the taste is probably one of the strongest yet pleasant chocolate note I've had in a beer. slight hint of spice from the cayenne, but not as much as I thought i would get (and I'm thankful for that). It adds just a touch of heat I find pleasant. think in the mouthfeel, yet not syrupy and some slight coating. Extremely drinkable especially for the ABV. this is right up there with every yeti offering i've tried yet. just a fantastic job."
"d - good sipper. i love oak aged yeti but overall this disappointed me."
"Drinkability: I think this beer would be much better without the cayenne. I'll take the regular Yeti instead. Yeah, I'm grading down the taste and the mouthfeel because the more I drink, the more I dislike the burn."
"I'll stick with the regular Yeti over this one."
"D: Not something I would drink everyday, but man is this an interesting beer. As it warms a the chocolate comes out a bit more. Very interesting. Touche."
"D = The drinkability on this one suffers somewhat from its big, bold flavors. Though it has a lot going for it, it also is somewhat difficult to take sip after sip. It is a good beer, and it does not have bad drinkability by any stretch, but it is not just an easy, dessert type beer."
"D: Not so well with this one. It's just too big, thick, and spicy to down this one. I had trouble finishing my portion."
"This one was incredible from start to finish. This thick jet black color has a strong aroma of bitter chocolate, vanilla, spice, and hints of wood from the oak. I didn't even realize it was 9% abv until it was nearly gone. A great balance. I just wanted to keep drinking this one."
"Appropriate for the style and ABV."
"P.S. I'd like to see more stouts of this style brewed with small amounts of peppers. Nothing overbearing, just a nice tingle."
"Golly, this is amazing. Although not the flavor at the front of the taste profile, it's the presence of the cayenne that makes this shine, or at least stand out from the many other oak-aged, big-ass, double-chocolate, crazy-ass stouts out there right now. Would have been just as good without its addition, too. Held onto this for months, which is a record for me, maybe even too early to pop it open, being in the bottle for just under six months. No regrets at all, but I'll bet it will hold up for another several years, easily."
"D - Sharing this was the way to go. It's too good to keep to one's self. Definitely a sipping beer though. So well balanced. I need to get some more of this asap."
"D- Booze and pepper flavor get to me after a little bit. The complexity of it is more than enough to make me want more, but in the end it was a little too much. Good beer overall though!"
"A very enjoyable drinkable beer with or without food, although I cringe at some of their food pairing suggestions oysters... no..."
"Definitely recomended, but I'd prefer to share a bomber of this and not dirnk it all myself due to the intense flavor. (The cayenne pepper really takes over your mouth after a pint)."
"I enjoy the way the flavors play together. If this was a bit silkier, it could warrant a lot more attention. Still a well-crafted stout with big, robust flavors that should see the inside of everyone's fridge a couple of times."
"Don't get me wrong - It's a very well made and solid Great Divide line of Yeti. But something about that extra fingerprint of added peppery heat just doesn't quite pull it together enough for me."
"D: This mythological beast is really a bit too big and harsh to be enjoyable as a drinkable beer. Medium."
"Bottled on May 28 2010. Pours very thick jet black with a nice big dark tan head. The head has decent retention, and leaves a little bit of lacing on the glass. The smell at first is over powering of chocolate but smells awesome. Once you get around the chocolate there is roasted malt, some coffee and just a little bit of vanilla behind all of that. Pretty typical of a big imperial stout except with loads more chocolate in the smell. Despite all the chocolate in the smell the taste kind of threw me off. Still quite chocolately obviously, and the chocolate is right up front. There seems to be a bit more coffee in the the taste that comes out after the chocolate. The vanilla is a bit more apparent as well rather than hiding in the back like I had in the smell. A little burn from the alcohol but nothing that throws the flavor off. The mouthfeel is semi thick and a little chewy. As for drinkability, it's pretty easy to drink even with a ABV of 9.5 (which isn't to bad for me) and with a little burn of alcohol. Probably wouldn't do two of these in a night but I wouldn't put it past me. Overall really good, another good Yeti from Great Divide. I've got another I've been sitting on for a year already so I wanted to try one that was kind of fresh to compare it to. I think this one will do good with a bit of age on it."
"Notes: Mixed feelings about this brew, but while I like what Great Divide does with their stouts I confess that I've never been blown away by any of them. This one could almost work with that spicy touch, but there is something that does not quite do it for me."
"I'm going to keep the other one for a couple years to see how it ages. It should cut down on the Bitterness, Alcohol, and Spice that hurts this beer."
"This is an excellent beer that obviously had a lot of care put into the balance and structure. Great. I'd like to let one age and see it come together even better over the years. This is a home run by Great Divide."
"M/D: Full bodied, carbonation is just right, silky smooth body overall. Drinkability is excellent. Pretty much if it says Yeti on the bottle and GD puts it out, it's probably a good beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Very full bodied with just a touch of carbonation. Very smooth in the mouth. The taste lingers a long time in the mouth after each swallow. Even with the amount of chocolate taste in this beer, it is still very complex and I can taste all the other flavors. I liked this beer quite a bit, and look forward to trying the other Yetis."
"**Another BA has just informed me that cayenne pepper is added to this offering. Not a good idea GD. Not a good idea at all."
"I had this on tap at Angler's on Mass street in downtown Lawrence. Served in a tulip glass. I loved every minute of it. The head was a dark tan shade about a quarter inch thick. The finish was so strong I went to the bathroom and was still tasting it when I got back to the table. I could drink this every day and be a happy man."
"Overall, a very good Impy Stout. I respect that they didn't use the chocolate in a gimmicky way and opted to make it known without detracting from everything else."
"Drinkability, it's a good beer, but I could not push passed one."
"D- This is a nice stout, but not as good as I was hoping. I was hoping for a sweeter chocolate taste and more complexity. I feel that it could have been silkier and creamier too. This is my first Yeti I will buy this again and I am still can't wait to try the others."
"Drinkability- It's hard to call this drinkable. Delicious yes, drinkable maybe. The cayenne-y spiciness and the high alcohol content may keep me from drinking more than one or two bottles but it's certainly tasty."
"D: This is a big bold Imperial Stout. The alcohol is well hidden which makes this easy to drink."
"Great. Yeti, in it's many forms, is as good as any big stout around. I feel like a broken record saying this, but if this were more difficult to obtain it would be rated higher. Get yourself some Chocolate Yeti."
"D - this is a solid RIS. There isn't as much chocolate in this as I would have hoped, given its name, however the flavors that are present are nice. I didn't realize there was cayenne in this until I started drinking it. It works well in this beer. I don't know if I would buy this one again given the price point and the regular Yeti being superior. Worth a try, though."
"Mmmm, mmm. Love it."
"D: Cayenne and heaviness of this beer make this a sipper. Glad I tried this beer but never again this beer was destroyed by the cayenne."
"Overall, glad I got to try it. Interesting I did not notice much of any oak in this beer. A decent beer at first, but becomes overwhelmed by spice and falls apart for me. Will not have again."
"M/D - Lighter body than expected, low on carbonation in a good way. Finishes dry on the palate with lingering wood and mocha flavors. High ABV is moderately present so it makes to be a nice sipper and warmer beer."
"coffee. Nice hints from the oak, makes this a really great after dinner sipper. It warms nicely from the ABV but it doesn't hinder. Great flavors of vanilla, toffee, and mocha end with nia nice malt background. The entire Yeti series is a great tribute to the Stout."
"Mouthfeel is full with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Drinkability is average. I've had other cocoa/pepper stouts in the past, but this one doesn't really pull it off. The flavor is fairly disjointed and seems to be a bit off. Maybe it's the year of age, but I think in general this beer is not one of the better Yetis Great Divide offers. Worth checking out if you've tried the others in this series, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has an aggressive oak character that compliments a subtle dark chocolate aroma. The taste is good. It has a sharp black malt bitterness that really hits you up front and carries through to the finish. The chocolate character isn't too pronounced, but it's noticeable. The oak aging adds excellent flavors that are quite complimentary to the black and chocolate malts. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking double stout. The chocolate character could be better. The oak aging seems to squash the chocolate theme."
"Looks like motor oil the way it swirls in the glass. Pours a nice dark roasty caramel color. The nose is boozy and milk chocolate. Some coffee there but muted. The taste.. Mmmm, nice. Flavor is more milk and some dark chocolate. Coffee in there as well, almost like a warm mocha. Not much booz in the taste. Dark malts. A nice balance of sweetness and bitterness from the malts. A little cayenne pepper in there on the back end that gives this a nice full circle finish. Very full bodied RIS. Drinkability is probably medium. It took me a while to put a bomber of this one back... Good stuff though."
"A tasty treat. Vey dark brown body, with a bit of off-white head. Above average mouthfeel. Chocolate, ginger, and oaky wood.Aroma is a little boozy, roasty, chocolate. Well balanced stout, and chocolate works well here, less coffee is nice.Very good drinkability."
"I like this beer for the same reason I love dark chocolate (and hate milk chocolate). It harnesses the great chocolate flavor without overpowering the yeti. Also, the spicy finish (I believe a hint of cayenne is responsible) is absolutely fantastic"
"Overall this is a terrific beer, very well crafted"
"Body seems just a bit thin, not the chewy monster I expected. Some heat from the alcohol. Nice lower amount of carbonation. Very nice, although I think I enjoyed the espresso better. Still, nice beer."
"D: this is a sipper for sure, it gets a bit hot about halfway through my first glass, also very thick. Overall, the flavors are complex and interesting. The spiciness from the peppers nicely offsets the sweetness."
"D - Awesome flavor, body, and aroma. I expected a little more chocolate flavor, as the roasted malts and coffee overpowered the chocolate. There is also not much of an oak presence, but the pepper presence is definitely there. Very interesting flavor combination!"
"D- Drinkability is hindered by the overwhelming bitterness and astringency. This is definitely a beer worth tasting... but not worth drinking 22oz. of..."
"Can't believe I'm drain pouring this after the amount of money I spent. This was the ONE beer I was going to have tonight. Pissed."
"I prefer the standard Yeti so far, but I've heard that the Espresso version is the best. I'll have to put that to the test one of these days."
"D: Heat makes me slow down a bit -- heat from both the 9.5% ABV and the cayenne. It's still a solid drinker, but I can't help but wonder what some time in the cellar would do to this."
"Drinkability is very good for a beer of this style, I could down a couple of bombers of this no problem (though I would be broke and drunk afterwards). Very highly recommended for fans of imperial stouts."
"pours an opaque black color with extra large light brown head and good lacing that receded slowly. soft carbonation and strong chocolate smell. taste was the same with caramel and vanilla hints. woody oak flavor and spiciness were very potent. some bitter harsh hop flavor as well. finish was very harsh bitter, chalky and spicy. full bodied and long flavor duration. creamy sticky texture. very complex flavor, this beer is definitely not for the untrained palate. the plethora of flavors in this brew bite hard."
"Notes: This is my first Great Divide beer and I was thoroughly impressed with it. I will definitely be buying more before its gone and I plan on saving them till the winter months. Its a good thing its nice and cool in my basement :)"
"Opaque in body with bubbly milk chocolate head. Sweet aroma of dark chocolate mousse, chocolate shavings, hint of vanilla and wood, slight maple in the finish along with cinnamon. Strong in flavors of dark chocolate and oak characteristics, side notes of bourbon, cinnamon, and hop bitterness as an aftertaste. The oak rushes in towards the end of the drink and finishes dry. A bit of a woody, charcoal aftertaste settles in reminiscent of cigarettes. Thick in mouthfeel and sits heavily on the belly but not uncomfortably. A good yin yang going on here between the sweet and the ash."
"Drinkability: The re-taste went better than the inital bottle, I think there was less of the cayenne or whatever pepper they use. It seems better balanced that I remember previously."
"If it weren't for the clashing of the pepper and the alcohol heat, I think this beer would be awesome. As it is, though, it is just a decent imperial stout."
"D: Definitely drinkable, quite enjoyable, I'd definitely buy another, though unfortunately I had to go on quite a trip for this, not local to me."
"Drinks: like a less-favorite child. I'd place this Yeti several notches below the espresso-aged version. While the cayenne adds something interesting to the drink, there's just not enough chocolate there to balance it all out."
"Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti is a solid black beer with a thick, smooth brown head that has incredible retention and lacing. It has a warm, rich chocolate and vanilla aroma with resiny oak tones. It's full bodied and very smooth with a light, clean finish. The flavor starts with oak: first resin, then vanilla. Then it's on to chocolate: first candy bar, then baker's chocolate. The chocolate bitterness fades in a spicy cayenne rumble. It's very tasty, very complex and very satisfying. The oak is a little heavy, but this is outstanding."
"This is a beer for the cold. I'd love to try this one again in January vice July."
"This is deffinitly a quality beer, it's just a bit too much for me right now, and I prefer the original Yeti. If it ain't broke don't fix it!"
"Very nice 1.5 finger creamy dark tan head sitting on top of a dense black beautiful beer which left some very decent lacing. I got the aromas of Chocolate, wood, coffee and bready dark maltiness. . . and then a little more chocolate. At first taste I got more hop pressence than i expected but I really liked that. Cocoa, coffee, and a bit of spiceyness rounded ou thte flavor. It was quite dry and balanced wonderfully with a clean aftertaste. A bit lighter on the palate than I had expected as well, still full bodied and beautiful, just lighter than I expected. very drinkable for the style and alc% as well. Very nicely done"
"F: Bitter is the key word here. More earthy bitter hops, and some bitter charred malts lingering, with more spicy lingering pepper on the back on the throat. Lots of malts and syrups as it coats the entire mouth for hours after the beer.Some roast and even a little coffee at this point. Some vanilla shines through with the chocolate as it all lingers, as well as some oak here and there. A little syrupy sweetness but somehow not sticky."
"A very solid beer. The chocolate is certainly noticeable but thankfully, it isnt that syrupy sweet chocolate that is prevalent in the majority of the chocolate subgenre. Borderline drinkable with this one weighing in at 9.5%, but solid overall. Alcohol is very warming and a bit hot but not too distasteful."
"D: This was a very nice imperial stout, but I'm not sure if it was noticeably different or better than the standard Yeti or Oak-Aged Yeti. The alcohol was pretty hot, so this needed to be sipped. It seemed to highlight the citrus hops more than the chocolate flavorings, which was unexpected. But it's already quite tasty fresh, and I'm sure it will improve with age."
"- Overall a solid stout... like the different offerings... but must say... I think I like the oak aged Yeti the best... the one that is not espresso or chocolate. But this is a close second."
"I like this beer, but it doesn't quite live up to other Yeti's. The bitterness and spicy quality are a bit too much."
"Drinking this beer is a real chore. I choked down about 6 ounces and then I just gave up. I had to drainpour the rest. It is overly roasted, bitter, too hoppy, and too spicy. I taste the base beer but I don't taste any oak or chocolate. The spiciness and all the hops along with the alcohol completely mask all of the intended flavors of this beer. Its also overly roasted and astringent leading to lots of bitter, acrid, unpleasant flavors. Maybe with another year of aging this beer might be drinkable but, it's definitely not right now. I wasted $12 on this beer. Vile stuff."
"D- definitely a sipper. The chocolate flavors are so strong that this beer is destined to be a dessert beer...but dear christ is it good. Can just be a little much at times."
"The pepper's contribution of heat is a little more evident than I was expecting but it works. I made it a point recently to try more and more stouts that had different types of peppers included and they always seem to have a similar yet unique citrus scent and flavor not found in other stouts. That might sound dumb but I don't know if it is just coincidence that the same hops are used or maybe the cayenne brings out a differnet level of citrus character but I like it."
"D= I was hoping this beer would be a good substitue for Hunahpu. I found this to be a little too harsh for a Huna substitue. This leads me to wonder weather or not it would age well. Worth seeking out and I will be drinking it again but it's no Huna."
"A tremendous beer if I must say so. Some of the best stuff I've had to date."
" Poured a beautiful black into my pint glass. Lots of coffee colored head that hung around for a good while. Good lacing with every sip. The smell was slightly startling not because I disliked it but because I hadn't read the bottle and didn't know it was seasoned with cayenne. I definitely picked up a nice chocolate and roasted malt aroma. Not much hops in the nose. What there is a lot of, though, is cayenne. I'm not complaining because I enjoyed it but I'm not sure why they would have added this to the beer. The taste was much like the smell. Nice chocolate and roasted malt up front. Then the cayenne kicks in. Its not horrible by anymeans...mainly because I really enjoy the taste of cayenne but it seems very out of place in this brew. A slight alcohol warmth comes in as the cayenne fades out. It definitely feels full in your mouth. Drinkability is good and I would definitely recommend this beer to a friend but give them a warning about the cayenne."
"D - Here's where it all goes south. At the start of my 11oz. pour, the drinkability was good. However, the initial pleasant chili ""heat"" gradually built up in the back of the throat, sip after sip, until it got unpleasant and borderline painful. I've used the term 'pepper-sprayed the back of my throat"" before and I can think of no more accurate term. Perhaps if I paired with some food, perhaps some smoked BBQ or the like, this would be a winner, but for now keep it far away from me."
"D- I'm not really feeling this one like I thought I would. The alcohol is just a bit too much for me. I can definitely sip this one for awhile, but more than one in any given night would be a lot for me... Edit- bumping score from a 3 for overall to style and not drinkability now"
"RESPECT"
"Bottle: Poured a deep pitch-black color stout with a heavy brown color foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of bitter back chocolate malt with light roasted malt notes. Taste is a very fine mix between some bitter black chocolate with notes of roasted malt and light dry roasted coffee. I couldn't really detect the oak to be honest though. Body had a creamy texture which I quite enjoyed with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well done and with some complexity and some great drinkability factor. Definitely something I would wish to have access to."
"Overall I'm not too pleased with the pepper in here. Love the oak aged version, like the espresso and the regular yeti. But this one is a bit frustrating. I just can't get over the pepper! Now that I have a Hunaphu I'm glad to hear they taste nothing alike!!"
"Surprisingly big head of close to finger's worth of dark brown foam, mix of all bubble sizes, not much lacing but good head retention in general. Pure black liquid, if black could be blacker, this would be it. In the nose the sweetness of the milk chocolate triumphs over the otherwise formidable roast, coffee beans, grilled nuts, toffee, comes on with oatmeal, wheat and raw grains, more hoppy kick apparent as it warms, little to no presence of fruit or citrus, seems to want to make sure they were not kidding with the word ""chocolate"" on the label. Full-bodied, here you find that missing kick, a first tastes like chili pepper infused chocolate. Sweetens some as you acclimate, but not much, more cocoa to mocha than chocolate, dusty texture. Roasty coffee takes down any caramel or toffee notes. Carbonation is demure, not absent but there are periods of inactivity. Maybe, just maybe, some orange peel otherwise, again, no fruit nor citrus. The hops add more punctuation than narrative and, really, with all that spiciness it is very hard to gauge the hop nuances, your mouth is kinda, err, on fire. Very pleasing to try and has personality, one bottle is more than enough pour moi."
"D: While delicious, I wouldn't want more than one snifter of this. Definitely a sipper."
"D: very good to the last drop, but is strong. smooth but enough to drink a ton of it"
"Poured super dark, and had little to no nose. Well I am not going to lie I dug right into this beer. The taste hit me upfront with some Dark Chocolate and hints of coffee. The body on this is ""on-point", great balance of thickness and carbonation, the mouth feel is perfect. The flavors blend so well together, and they get better with a bit of warmth. DAMN THIS IS GOOD. It is rare that a beer comes out with such a large distribution area that is soo damn good. Honestly to style it is up there with Choklat....I will hunt this Yeti down again and savor it again!"
"I do believe this is now my favorite Yeti release. As delicious and it is interesting. A summer stout, indeed."
"D- its a big brew and it does rock the tongue. Abv is a factor but not the end all be all. Its good just not the best."
"Very smooth and well-balanced, many tasty, complex flavors to savor. ""Hot"" chocolate indeed!"
"D: I wouldnt pay $4 for this and never drink again"
"Mouthfeel is thick & rich & creamy. Nice character. I'm not completely sure I'm crazy about the cayenne in here, but everything else about this beer is awesome, and the tingly cayenne sensation is certainly interesting in here."
"i would have to say this beer is much like dogfish heads theobroma just much more chocolate taste and more spice (i do suggest you try that beer as well if you havent)"
"I am going to save a bomber of this for a while and see what age does for it."
"Vintage: 2009 Served from tap into an imperial pint. Pours a deep black with a tan one finger head that subsides to minimal. Maintains excellent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt and chocolate. The flavor was of malt, coffee, and a chocolate followthrough. It had a medium feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this is by far the best Yeti I have had. I will compare it to a 2010 bottle I have in the fridge right now in the near future for a comparison. This one will be hard to top though..."
"Pretty stoked to get my hands on this. First time I have seen the COAY in the Buffalo area, we have had many Great Divide beers for some time but never this one. Pours dark as night with about one finger of mocha colored head. No visible carbonation to speak of and a small amount of light lace. The smell is somewhat vague but as it warms a bit it gets pretty interesting. BURNT dark chocolate is heavy on the nose, and I can't think of any other way to put it but it smells like weed to me. Very sure of it. Very complex scent. Tastes somewhat like it smells with a bit more hop presence and some nice hints from the pepper, adds some complexity, but once again there is a hint of marijuana in the taste as well. Strangest flavor combination I may have ever encountered in a beer. Mouthfeel is pleasant and smooth. Good amount of carbonation but the flavors leave some bitterness on the palate. Overall I am glad I got to try this but I can say I will not be revisiting. Not that it was unpleasant it was just so uniq and not what I look for in a stout. The flavor and scent of this beer is reason enough to pick it up and try it."
"O:Negatives first: The aromatics are very subdued minus the fresh oak. I would have liked to see more of the chocolate/ smokyness in the aroma. Positives: The appearance and aromas are magnificent. This beer drinks smooth as silk and great mouthfeel."
"This is a good one to share as the intense flavors can be a little overpowering. I can't imagine doing the whole bomber myself."
"M- Full bodied. The best part about the feel is the spicy warmth the peppers leave. That is a really nice sensation in a stout."
"Well, I only wish I had an endless supply of Great Divide beers today, as I had planned, but this Yeti sure does hit the spot."
"D: An excellent RIS but not an improvement over the original."
"D - I'm gonna have a problem finishing the bomber. It's good, but there are definitely better Imperial Stouts out there."
"With it's increased bitter dark chocolate flavors, the mild heatfrom the cayenne and the wonderful mouthfeel this Yeti is a fine addition to the OA lineup. May not be my favorite Yeti but we are splitting hairs here, definitely recomended!"
"Pours a deep opaque sable that is just a whisker above black with a thick, persistent tan head. Rich mocha aroma is smoky and slightly sweet with a hint of toffee. Mouth-filling flavor is rich and smoky with tones of unsweet chocolate, fine coffee, molasses and toffee; it is sweet but not cloying and - WHOA! - has a little kick from the cayenne pepper that gets your attention without overwhelming the rest of the flavor. Lively, restless texture is sharp and strongly tingly. It leaves a nice chocolate and molasses finish, while the pepper nips at the tongue. Strongly recommended to stout lovers - and those who like beer that is different."
"Chocolate is detectable immediately in the taste before even swallowing. Has a little spice (as mentioned in it's description) in the finish that does add a little complexity. The alcohol keeps the mouth warm and is not totally disguised. Oak flavors seem to stay around the longest reminding me of a scotch. Awesome texture and the carbonation is just right for my preference. A bomber of this goes down without struggle, enjoyable and easy to drink. Certainly worth a try and I'd take it over a regular yeti."
"Drinkablity is wonderful! Quite tasty and goes down easy for me. There is a bit of a burn to it that lingers which gives it a interesting and pleasing character. Out of all the versions of this brew I'd have to say this is the one I like the most. A very good double stout that's certainly worth a try and I will have it again!"
"thanks to kstrickler for this trade experience"
"D: Drinkable for the style, but a definite sipper."
"Of all the Yeti's, this one was the one I wanted to try the most since I love Chocolate Stouts. But I much prefer the other varieties over this one. Its an interesting beer and certainly not a bad one at all, but it didn't knock my socks off."
"Flavor is good, but not as good as I was hoping for. In my oppinion, the Espresso Oak Aged is better. With that said, this is still a very good beer. Mouthfeel is semi-thick but with a medium body...not a ton of consistency. Carbonation is middle of the road. Flavors range from roasted coffee to bitter and sweet chocolates. Roasted malts and dark sugars. The second wave of flavor is interesting, more of a milky and creamy taste to the chocolate. Overall though, a good stout from Great Divide!"
"Extremely dark ruby-brown in color. Milk & dark chocolate in the nose, along with a bit of the bourbon barrel as well. Creamy dark chocolate and roasty malt in flavor. Mega bitter finish. I know there is some pepper in there, but finding it hard to pick out with all the chocolate domination. Low drinkability due to the bitterness of the finish. I liked it, but it was honestly difficult to even finish the 10 oz pour I had."
"*note: Goes REALLY well with a rocky road brownie that I grabbed after I finished reviewing."
"Cheers!"
"I have not cracked my Barrel aged Yeti yet. With that in mind, I think this is my favorite Yeti release. That Cayenne just puts it over the top."
"D - This one is really easy to drink considering the ABV and the style. I really like the uniqueness that the pepper bring's to the plate. I really enjoy this beer, I will definitely going to pick this up every year and will have to cellar a few as well."
"Overall tasty, but still pretty strong on hops and dry bitterness. does well if you let it breath for a bit. might age in the short term nicely, mellowing slightly. I'm kind of annoyed how much I have to drink for the flavors to develop more fully. It definitely improves after a glass, but doesn't wow up front. After a couple glasses, I really don't want much more."
"Mouthfeel is thick with lower carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it has some great flavors to it. The oak and vanilla flavors really came through pretty well and were a welcome addition to the Yeti base. It was very chocolaty as well and one of the better chocolate labeled beers out there."
"Oh man, just typing this out has reminded me of that sensation... I'm done reviewing this one."
"I think I'll grab a couple of bottles to age, hopefully some of the heat and oak will fade."
"D: The spicy finish limits the drinkability of this one"
"drinkability: standard yeti gold."
"Pours a nice opaque black color, with some good tan head floating on top. Aromas of chocolate, oak, roasted malt and coffee. On the palate, I get more chocolate, both milk and dark, along with oak, vanilla and a just the barest hint of crushed red pepper. This one gets a little hot on the finish, with too much cayenne. An interesting experience, but not up to the level of the original oak aged version."
"I even shared it with a few friends. The general consensus was that there really wasn't much chocolate flavor, despite what the label said. It was just rather bitter, and that's about it. I wouldn't really recommend this beer. I doubt I'll be buying it again, when there are so many better options in the stout category."
"I liked this beer a lot ( except for the initial explosion)"
"D-This is a nice unpretentious dark drinking beer and I think the Yeti suggestion for a crème brulee hit it just right.... but save room for that 2n'd helping of beer!"
"Overall - Decadent and luscious are very accurate descriptors; this is a great stout, but definitely one to share."
"Overall, I liked this one quite a lot... Right up there with the regular Oak Aged Yeti and miles ahead of the Espresso Oak Aged Yeti... Not overly complex but doesn't have to be... It is what it is and I like it...a real treat..."
"A really nice beer, but doesn't quite reach the heights of the original or oaked version. Even still, get your hands on some if you can."
"D- It is a unique brew. The chocolate, oak, and coffee notes all blend together for a great tasting beverage and the cayenne finishes it off making it very distinct. I would definitely have another."
"d - Overall I thought this was a pretty good stout. I enjoyed the chocolate/dark fruit smell quite a lot. I'm more of a fan of sweet chocolate as opposed to bittersweet chocolate, but this still taste great none the less. I would definitely try this beer again."
"D. Drinkability is very high. This is a delicous beer. For chocolate lovers this might be the best Imperial Stout out there."
"At this point, it's readily apparent that it's difficult to screw up a beer when you're starting with Yeti. Great Divide is not lost on that point. I really like what they've done with these Yeti releases. Each one is a little different, but is strong enough to stand on its own. Personally, I think Chocolate Yeti could use a little more muscle on the nose and a little more body. That's about all I'd change. Very strong release all-around otherwise. Highly recommended."
"D - had no problem with the 9.5% abv. not a sipper - but a drinker"
"drinkability: Yeti's are an a plus beer. This is the best of them. IMO"
"D - quite impressive. I would gladly finish a bomber or two in an evening (and promptly fall asleep) 4.5"
"Overall an awesome variation of one of my favorite russian imperial stouts. Long live the yeti."
"Drinkability: This was such a delicious and unique beer! The chocolate and cayenne worked together so beautifully, and while the oak barrel didn't seem to have much effect, this beer was already interesting enough. Would love to land a bottle of this for myself!"
"Despite my complaints of one-dimensionality, I am actually enjoying this; especially as the beer warms the oak character is held much more in check and in balance with the other flavor components; the aroma never really gets all that interesting though. The spicy cayenne adds a nice touch to the finish that this spice-freak enjoys; even if it is somewhat subtle; it lingers on the palate and lips quite nicely though. The beer is actually quite nice and definitely enjoyable over all. The aggressiveness of the oak, hops and cayenne in the finish really helps to tame the big sticky malt character that would otherwise dominate this beer. Chocolate flavors, while noticeable, are not anything out of the ordinary here, and could even be attributed to malt character (even though this beer does have chocolate in it)."
"Overall, a smooth, balanced and flavorful imperial stout. The oak adds nice balance and a spice note that really adds depth. Certainly lived up to my expectations. A great brew."
"I would love to have more of this one; amazingly, the chocolate and cayenne blended very well in this stout."
"drinkability is great - i just wish i i could find this beer closer to home and didnt have to drive 100+ miles to try it"
"The flavor notes are strong and full: cocoa, rum, dark fruit, coffee, alcohol; not necessarily in that order. Big and smooth, almost creamy but a little high on the carbonation. Finish is long and bittersweet. Great mixture of coffee and chocolate, pretty great beer."
"Out of a bomber this beer was a genuinely opaque black color with a thin tan head. The retention was good and the lacing off the collar consistent. Commanding and, dare I say, even menacing. The aroma was of chocolate, wood, alcohol and roasted malt; big but simple. The flavors were similar with the addition of dark fruits and herbal hops that added some bitterness to offset the sweet elements. Chocolate dominated the beer, but as one who has enjoys such sweetness in my beers (and candy, and women...), I enjoyed it. The mouthfeel was rich and creamy, the body full and the carbonation medium/low."
"22oz bottle into Duvel snifter pours a deep opaque black with a nice frothy light tan head. Aroma is a nice blend of roasty malts and Hershey bar-like milk chocolate. The taste is a wonderful blend of rich chocolate, oak and smooth roasted malts. There is even a nice hint of Bourbon in there as well. The beer is medium bodied with its alcohol well hidden by smooth carbonation and a hint of dryness. This one is a truly special beer, one I'll certainly have again."
"D: great sipper, goes fast though found myself picking up my empty glass a few times."
"D - This was one weird brew. It has some of the things I like about regular Yeti (appearance, feel), but the addition of more elements (cocoa nibs, cayenne, oak, etc.) makes this kind of a mess. I'll eventually finish my pour (split it with my wife), but I won't be buying this one again."
"D-wow, this is awesome! very straight forward and drinks as advertised; but huge flavors and done right."
"Pours an opaque black with one finger tan head with pretty good retention, spotty but thick lacing. Smell: sort of a powdery milk chocolate, baker's chocolate, a bit oak/wood, leafy and slightly citric hop note, a little peppery (edit: noticed it says cayenne on the label... got something between white pepper and paprika). It's all a little understated though. Taste: syrupy dark chocolate, dark brown sugar, a little roast, notes of vanilla and pepper. Dry peppery finish with a touch of alcohol. A little more interesting than oaked Yeti, but the regular Yeti is where it's at. July 16 2009 bottling."
"But I must, the big booze is listed on the label, even though it's nowhere to be found in this brew - another classic from GD. Darn fine brew."
"This is definitely a sipping beer. The high alcohol is subtle, and the spicy end was a bit of a surprise."
"D: A very, very interesting brew and one that will improve with cellaring. Although the strong hop notes were a pleasant surprise, a bit of mellowing in that regard will only help this already strong concoction. I doff my hat to Great Divide. Seek this out and make sure to cellar some too. For full enjoyment, make sure to allow this to warm."
"The mouth was very smooth with a silky warm texture, you could feel alcohol warmth as well. This is a great stout almost the feel of a milkshake and not a beer. Very pleasant."
"Edit: Ok as this beer warms the spices come out in droves!! OMG what an interesting and complex beer. Delicious! My mouth is on fire! i love it!"
"I quite enjoyed this one. This has everything I want in a stout and the subtle pepper certainly added a nice touch. I only wish I could afford to indulge myself with this one more often. Bring the price down and I'll buy lots of this!"
"The choco yeti pours a deep brown color with a pretty tan creamy head. No lacing to note. Smell is pretty subtle with hints of chocolate, vanilla, and alcohol. Taste is delicious with lots of chocolate coming out on the palate. Hints of espresso beans and vanilla also pop out in the flavor profile. Pretty complex tasting, but great nonetheless. Mouthfeel is thick/full bodied. Overall a really good beer, but the espresso aged yeti gets my vote for the best of the group."
"Overall this was another wonderful version of the Yeti and another solid offering from Great Divide. Certainly one of the best chocolate in-fuzzed Imperial Stouts on the market. Highly Recommended."
"Recommended."
"Big delicious brew. Not the most complex, but very nice nonetheless."
"Creamy, nice body. Overall, drinkability suffers from the strong heat from the pepper, but this was nice."
"An excellent dessert beer, though the primary ingredients are subsumed by the additives. A festive brew that I would pick up every once in a while if it were in my distribution network..."
"D- This is a tasty stout just like it's brothers, however I really could have done without the cayenne it really takes the drinkability down quite a bit for me. After trying several spicy pepper beers I've decided that I just plain don't want it in my beer."
"This beer is outstanding with the rich chocolate and the heat. Another great winter sipper."
"OVERALL kinda hot, and the chocolate is not prominent. Some cellar time will likely do it some good. Not as smooth as the Espresso Oaked Yeti. Yet, still a really good and interesting example of the style."
"A black opaque color, with a dark tan, three inch high head, that laces and clings to the glass. The scent of oak comes through with the woodsy fragrances of caramel and vanilla. Dark roasted malt comes along for the ride, bringing a slight twang of alcohol at the end. The taste of chocolate comes out right at the front, followed by wood and vanilla esters. There are dark bread flavors brought by the malt, bringing raisons and dried fruit flavors as well. The finish is surprising, with a grassy and citrus bitterness, that lingers for some time. A rich and smooth texture, coats the palate, the warm feeling of alcohol hits the throat. The palate is left with dry and arid feel. This beer has a deep rich color, strong and complex aroma. The plethora of flavors, with the heavy and rich texture makes this a must try beer. This beer is would be mostly served with desert, but try it some spicy Mexican or some hot wings."
"Tried this at J. Clyde's the other day on cask. Presented with a thin brown head and dark as night. Very smooth with medium mouthfeel. Little hops in flavor but chocolate flavor is very evident. Also has chocolate aroma. Very drinkable, would like to try it on tap or bottled."
"4.5/4/4.5/4.5/4"
"O: Another excellent offering in the Yeti series. It's much more drinkable than the Espresso Oak Aged offering in that it's a bit lighter doesn't pack the coffee wallop. Still, I couldn't drink more than one of these in a night. Split with a friend and enjoy!"
"I think I rate this 3rd among the Oak Yeti's. The Espresso first, the regular 2nd and then this. All in all, a very good line-up"
"This beer is quite the accomplishment for Great Divide. Most chocolate stouts I've tried either end up with too much or too little chocolate. The ones that find the balance usually have no complexities to it. This brew has none of those issues."
"D - Unique... The focus of this brew is certainly the addition of cayenne pepper... It dominates the taste and mouthfeel components... It's not bad, but I'm not sure this is a brew I would seek out in the future..."
"This is definitely a solid imperial stout. Very unique as well. If the chocolate was a bit more prominent I may have liked it more. Recommended."
"Pours an extremely dark brown colored body with an average tan color body, lasting. Bitter hoppy aroma, some sweet chocolateliness too. Something else inthe aroma, maybe the cayenne. Some cocoa. Really strong aroma. Cocoa taste, a little dry. Dry peppery cayenne finish. Creamy mouthfeel. Spiciness in the mouth. Dry, dusty mouthfeel."
"The chocolate yeti has perfect color in both the body of the beer and the frothy dark brown head. The aromo combines chocolate and a touch of vanilla. The impression of bourbon comes from the oak age. The initial flavor impression is reminisent of the smell and the alcohol adds a certain sweetness. The cayenne makes for a hot mouthfeet that initially reminded me of the impression of fussel alcohol... The mouth feel was initially very rich, but as the caspicum from the chili pepper accumulated the hot impression became bothersome. Overall a good beer that I would like to try without the cayenne."
"22 ounce bottle, bottled on July 16, 2009. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch frothy brown head. Head retention is good, lacing is excellent. It smells like roasted malt, dark and milk chocolate, oak and vanilla. The taste is similar to the aroma, with the addition of a burnt/charred malt and smoky flavor. There's also some hot spice in the finish that gets a bit stronger the longer I drink the beer, I assume that's from the cayenne. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's rich and creamy with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's easy to drink but I don't think I could drink any more than a bomber of this at a time. I think this is a pretty good overall brew, I liked it a lot."
"Drinkability - a great brew. At length, the oak tends to dominate, likely assisted by the cayenne. I would have liked to picked up a little more of the chocolate, but still, this one's a keeper."
" D- This beer has a nice rich chocolate flavor with an interesting pepper heat that is just enough to add character but then grows a bit to much as the beer warms. The oak is nice but becomes overpowered by the chile peppers as does the malt."
"Medium-full body, moderate carbonation. Somewhat thick, but silky and smooth. Reminiscent of a Hershey's Dark Chocolate with Cocoa Nibs square, if they added some heat to the mix. Probably like something you would get in an offering from Vosqes-Haut. The heat is surprising and stays with you for a while, but gives this a unique twist. If I were to tweak it, I would turn down the heat just a little, and let the chocolate come out more. Certainly worth sampling again."
"Notes: Biggest let down of the year, especially since I liked plain old yeti quite a bit. I am depressed that I had to drain pour such an expensive beer. I am not even sure what was going on in this beer. Guess it could be the chips versus barrel age, I have no idea I am too new to the world of beer to be certain. All I know is that oak flavor was way too overpowering for me."
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely."
"My favorite of the Yeti crew and my personal favorite RIS. Great job GD."
"Solid finish brew for dessert, BGBBD final course at sierra. This dinner had everything including great brews, but the chocolate yetit had something to prove in the final course and it showed up great. Great hop characteristic that I expected in a dessert style brew, not cloying or sweet. It wasn't the best of the night, but it was the best choice for dessert, and in reality is the best variation of Yeti to date. Marvelous."
"D: Very nice, but I was glad I was able to share this with Heather. This guy is pretty boozy!"
"D - combination of the sweetness, alcohol, and heaviness keep this going down at a snails pace. very enjoyable, but the last few ounces of this bomber are putting up a good fight. perfect to share for dessert."
"Possibly my favorite of the Yeti family, though all are exception. Drinks incredibly well, goes down easy. One to savor and enjoy, overall very impressed."
"A bomber I had back in June of 2009. The colour was black with a very thick mocha coloured head. The aroma was quite chocolate and cocoa like with hints of coffee. On the palate, a delightful creaminess, lightly oaky, sweet, bitter chocolate, hoppy, vanilla, creme brulee, a hint of cayenne and one helluva long finish, Liked it so much I ordered a case from a local purveyor. I'll be interested to see what this is like in a year or so."
"J"
"D: This is a solid all around beer. I love chocolate beers, and this one did not disappoint. The cayenne provides something different and it was a welcome addition."
"Notes: I could not help but compare this with the Oak Aged Yeti, a fair comparison I think. All by itself this beer really delivers on its promised bigness but has that bitter sting, too obvious alcohol and is ultimately too thin for my tastes. It remains interesting, something that could be considered by anyone who is a fan of the style. Lastly, it is a bit expensive."
"Drinkability: This is a good chocolate beer where the chocolate flavors don't make the beer overly sweet. It was an enjoyable beer, and one I'll have no problem finishing or picking up again. I would be interested to try this one on tap, as the Espresso Yeti definitely had more of an espresso flavor on tap than it did in the bottle, so I'm curious if the same is true of the Chocolate Yeti."
"(D)- Call me crazy, but this is deceptively drinkable. Goes down easy & smooth; the alcohol just catches up with you later on. Rich & dense, yet wonderfully complex and balanced. A superb stout; and I thought that the regular Yeti was good!"
"Plenty drinkable for style, and a fair treat on a cold night in England."
"Similiar to Southern Tier's Choklat but less Willy Wonka, more Chocolate Pebbles. Not bad by any means, but doesn't live up to the Yeti standard."
"HV"
"Tasty, unique, the bottle goes down well, but not sure I could have multiples in one sitting. The last 2 oz. are the toughest - still tasty, but filling."
"D- Not something i'll drink often but quite tasty and i'll surely committ a couple to the cellar with the rest of my Yeti's."
"D: a fascinating and rewarding brew, though the heat becomes somewhat tiring"
"Suggested food pairings of steak and chocolate mousse make sense, but the coffee aspect--even more than a typical stout--makes this an excellent beer with spaghetti carbonara or even bacon and eggs."
"Jet black color with a small, tight cocoa head on top. Some killer lacing going on as the beer goes down the glass. Deep, black inky aroma-notes of dried fruit, vanilla and oak. Huge flavor! A great blend of oak, vanilla and dark chocolate. Plums and port wine come thru in the finish. Long, lingering roasted quality to it. Nice dry grainy taste. Dry cocoa flavor. Great body-a spoon would seemingly stand up in this one. Just a great beer-very drinkable and enjoyable. I could do several of these no problem. Oaked Yeti was NOT my thing-this is a whole other ball game. Well worth trying/cellaring/hoarding!"
"D - Rated it high, but honestly, I probably would tire even though I like it so much."
"Conclusion: Had been thinking about cellaring this a bit longer, but the wife and I got antsy on the first really cold night of fall. Paired this with some dusty dark chocolate and it was pretty tasty. This was not the chocolate bomb I was expecting it to be, but rather has just a touch of chocolate and is dominated by the woodsy/earthy flavors of the oak. The cayenne spice is really interesting, and I do mean REALLY interesting...I can't decide whether I love it but I sure don't hate it...Not something I'd drink all the time, and IMHO not quite as good as the regular YETI, but far better than the regular OAY and definitely something to try if you get a chance."
"D - I think this beer is superb & very drinkable, though it gets rather spicy by the end - which I am more than happy with. Worth a try if you come across it."
"The beer pours black, with no highlights when it is held up to the light. The head is not very large, but what head is there is brown in color. The smell is roasted malt, with chocolate in the aroma as well. The taste is of milk chocolate with some hints of vanilla which I am assuming come from the oak. As dark as this beer is, it is not near as thick as other stouts like Ten Fidy, which adds to its drinkability. There is no alcohol detectable in the flavor, but you do get an alcohol warming sensation even though you cannot taste the alcohol. This stout goes down so easy that I could see the alcohol sneaking up on you in a bad way if you weren't careful. I need to buy some more of this because it is one of the best stouts I have ever tried."
"Solid complex sweet stout beer."
"D - Good for what this beer is. This is a phenomenal -bal aged (or at least chip/nib-aged) imperial stout overall."
"Bomber poured into Unibroue tulip. Bottled on 7/16/09. Totally black body with light brown, long lasting head, consisting of thousands of tiny, tiny tiny bubbles...lovely. Hops are present in the nose but so is strong alcohol, roasted/toasted malts and chocolate. Almost a brownie type chocolate smell. Taste is beyond what I expected based on the smell and ABV. What I am tasting should only be 5% ABV...amazing. Smooth, smooth, smooth. Can this actually get better with age? Can't wait to see. Bring on vanilla yeti!!! This offering is simply spectacular in every way, shape and form."
"Easy to drink but something that you actually want to take the time to sip and enjoy."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy. Would be a good desert beer for sure! Another tasty Great Divide brew. I'm looking forward to the Espresso Yeti in my cellar."
"MF&D - the body was too light for the style, but having the cayenne added to the mix changes the game:I wouldnt want to be drinking an incredibly thick brew if it was this spicy. that would be too concentrated. the drinkability is also going to suffer because of the cayenne: this is not a brew of which I would want ot have more than one glass or bottle."
"This was good, but I liked the Espresso version better."
"D: To be respected at 9.5%, a sip-n-savor kind of stout. Beyond that, an absolute wonder; rich and savory, plenty of flavor, warming. That 'alcohol' in the nose/flavor was a little off-putting, so a slight downgrade. Very slight. Still a terrific beer; highly recommended."
"Drinkability all depends on the drinker, but the spicy kick could be a bit much for some."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice semi-thick black color, very nice carbonation, with an very nice thick creamy tan head, lots of nice sticky lacing and small islands left behind. The nose is malty, with some chocolate, coffee, toffee, nice little oak note. The taste is very nice, malty, with lots of chocolate/coffee/toffee notes, nice hint of vanilla, and oak notes. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is an amazing brew, way to go GD. Thanks Chuck!"
"D - Drinkability is good. The alcohol is easy to pick up but it doesn't hinder drinking the beer in any way. The limit is probably one bottle thanks to the 22 ounce bottle format. This is a very nice brew overall that I'll be having again. There is no doubt about that. This one could be in the running for my favorite Yeti version to date. Another great brew from Great Divide. Good job guys."
"You can drink this pretty well for a stout."
"The flavor is rich dark and mild milk chocolate with spicy cayenne notes. It's very interesting. The spicy burn lingers and it builds on itself and becomes pretty damn spicy. I imagine it was pretty intense when it was first released. While the cayenne was interesting, I eventually grew weary of it."
"Overall, an excellent beer. I like what the chocolate and cayenne adds to an already fine stout. I like this a lot better than the oak aged yeti. A little better in the nose and mouthfeel and this could be a perfect beer."
"Drinkability: I love this beer! Great Divide has topped the already wonderful Oak Aged Yeti with this excellent Imperiel Stout. Bravo!"
"Want was neat was that as we got to the bottom the hints of chocolate became a lot more pronounced and the flavors really started to kick in."
"D: Not a bad beer by any means. It is a bit too sweet for my liking though. It just seems to have gone a bit too far in the sweetness direction. This puts it more into the dessert beer realm that should be shared with friends (a la Southern Tier). Sadly, I am all alone on this one but I will survive. This will be slowly sipped and savored though, you have no choice. I just feel that out of the Oak Aged series I have had so far, this is the weakest. The Espresso was just a better crafted beer in my opinion. That may be why this didn't live up to expectations for me since the Espresso version was so damned good. Ah well, can't knock em all out of the park. Still a good beer and I would definitely have this again in group setting."
"The drink is fullish-medium in body with very fine carbonation. A sipper best enjoyed not-cold."
"The drinking experience of this one is interesting, it starts out sweet chocolate and excellent imperial stout, just before and through the swallow I notice a heavy whiskey alcohol, some of that bite might be the cayenne, but there's no lingering heat to suggest that. This beer does pair wonderfully with a salted chocolate bar that I ate while enjoying my pseudo-documentary blaxploitation film."
"D - Wow. I have now had four different versions of Yeti, and this is the best. The chocolate really ups the complexity, adding depth to both flavor and aroma while also lending a silky fullness to the mouthfeel. The lowered hop profile allows the malt to shine through better than in previous versions while still managing to keep this huge beer balanced. The chilis are an interesting touch as well, they amp up the spiciness of the alcohol and hops while also giving the finish a satisfying bite. Not only is this the best version of Yeti, it is as good an Imperial stout as I have ever had. I really liked this beer, and if I find more of it I am going to stock up."
"D-- Not that big body wise until the end. I expected a bigger, chewy beer. Maybe a little too much pepper for me. Excellent balance of chocolate though. One 750 is enough for me. I much rather have the regular imperial stout over this, other Yeti is much more drinkable over this. Like I said it may be the pepper that I am not keen on. That being said I like this beer. Very interesting."
"Drinkability: this beer is tasty but very thick and very huge."
"The absolute best chocolate beer I've had. It's like drinking a cold mayan hot chocolate (mayan hot chocolate is dark chocolate with cayenne). So much going on and it's unlike any other chocolate beer because of the cayenne. Not a trace of the 9.5% ABV. Outstanding beer!"
"Drinkability: this beer went down smooth and rather quickly despite the style. Everyone should give this a try."
"Drinkability is very much dependent on how you feel about the cayenne. If you love the heat, and can tolerate the alcohol, this one is for you. But while this is a very tasty beer, I really feel like the cayenne could be toned down significantly to let the chocolate really shine through."
"Drinkability: Another amazing yeti. This may be my favorite of them. I love imperial stouts and pepper beers and this combines them with a great oak taste that is common in the oak aged yetis. This was an awesome beer worthy of saving for a big occasion. One per sitting cause of ABV but I want another."
"D- The cayenne killed it for me. After the first few sips my throat just burned from it and took away all of the taste. It does simmer down after a bit, but I'd be happy without it."
"Very smooth and quite drinkable, with a nicely hidden 9.5%abv. The cayenne would, honestly, keep me from downing too many of this in a session, though. It's very nice, but I'd love to try this without it."
"D - After drinking this I actually felt a little sick to my stomach, but in fairness that could have been something I ate. Overall I think they went way too heavy on the cocoa... and the cayenne pepper? To the extent they were evident, they just made me sweat, and did not add much flavor."
"Taste is awesome, mouthfeel is amazinf. It's very velvety and heavy with some awesome chocolate and oak notes. Nice and smooth and for such a high abv it isn't very strong. An awesome sipper."
"Overall, I'm very disappointed with this one. Somehow Great Divide took one of the greatest imperial stouts on the market and managed to ruin it. This is a prime example of the fact that you shouldn't mess with a good thing. In fact, Yeti and Oaked Yeti are excellent beers, and should not be meddled with. I never, EVER thought that I'd be pouring out half a bomber of Yeti, but I think tonight might be the night..."
"I have had the Espresso Oak Aged several times, and I would rate it perfect in every category, however, this beer, I was less impressed with. Don't get me wrong, it is a decent imperial stout, but it falls short in several areas. One, not intense chocolate. If you would have told me it was a coffee stout I would believe you, but it just didn't smell or taste, like chocolate. Two, it was way too strong, the taste of alcohol stood out like a sore thumb - like someone had poured a half shot of grain alchy in it. 3, the mouthful fell short - it wasn't creamy or full-bodied enough to stay with the Imperial Stout pack. Dissapointing, but acceptable."
"D: I thought the spices in this would be overpowering, but it ended up being a nice touch. Not the best version of Yeti, but still very good, and very drinkable."
"Bomber- pours inky black and given a vigorous pour into a Duvel glass- a thick three finger mocha head. Lacing is quite good. Nose- milk chocolate, nuts, and anise. Taste- chocolate forward- mix of dark and milk chocolate. Not a ton of roast. Vanilla and hops come through towards the finish. Finish is fairly bitter from the hops and oak and some alcohol heat."
"Good beer, but I think I prefer regular Oaked Yeti. That one is a drinker, this one is a sipper."
"D - This is a great brew, very complex and delicious. It was very spicy with a great chocolate taste."
"D: Nicely done and worth seeking out. For me, this one is all about the pepper."
"Tried this beer on 09-10. Really like Great Divide beers. This beer has great color. Dirty motor oil. Great head retention. The aromas are nice. Choclate, Vanilla, mocha, and expresso are blended together nicely. I did find the cayenne to be a bit annoying though. I felt this slight burn in the back of my throat and wasn't sure what it was. Read the label and saw that cayenne was added. Never had that before. Less cayenne would be nice. Other than that a solid beer."
"Note: I finished the bomber by pairing it with a bowl of French vanilla ice cream. An awesome match that is definitely worth trying."
"Opinion: This is a really good beer. Kudos to GDBC. I like the balance and complexity in here, and the aroma is getting more complex as it warms up. I think that overall this beer is well crafted and I would certainly try it again. The wife likes it too, so that makes it truly a winner!"
"the cayenne heat lingers, making subsequent pulls from the glass less chocolate and more spice. a disappointing end to something that started off tremendously."
"D: Not bad, but a bit disappointing. The elements of an out-of-this-world beer are definitely there. But they got too cute with the addition of pepper, and it's only decent as a result."
"drinkability is nice. i think the pepper detracts from the drinkability a little. it adds a new dimension, but i don't think it is all that complimentary. it's neat though, and another interesting twist on the yeti."
"D - Quite a complex, decadent Imperial Stout to say the least. The cayene pepper really stands out and adds a spicy kick, thus adding a whole other dimension to this chocolatey treat."
"22 ounce bottle purchased online for around ten dollars, drank a few nights ago from my Dogfish Head snifter, reviewed from notes, very dark brown color, one inch creamy light brown head that lasted a few minutes, good retention and some lacing, aroma consists of strong cocoa nibs, milk chocolate, roasted malts, sweet toffee, vanilla, burnt sugar, mild oak, and various spices oddly, flavor starts off with tons of chocolate, roasted malts and mild sweetness mix in the middle, finish is slightly dry with some light spice that seemed more along the lines of nutmeg and vanilla extract, malts become even sweeter as the beer continues to warm, good amount of cocoa by the end and a nice roastiness carries its way through to the end, sweet, slightly spicy, and roasty mouthfeel, medium to full bodied, light to moderate level of carbonation, taste lingers for a good amount of time with sweetness, just feels like part of the body is lacking, drank about half of this bottle and could not have done much more, a bit heavy, sweet at times, alcohol is hidden pretty well though, I liked this better than the Oak Aged Yeti I tried recently again, not as big of a chocolate component as I was hoping for but a very good beer otherwise, would drink again, recommended"
"M + D: Big and creamy, with carbonation giving life on the tip of the tongue and then smoothing out for a softer finish. As mentioned on the flavour notes, the heat of the cayenne leaves a bit of a burning sensation on the way down which lingers for a while. That shouldn't play TOO much into the drinkability of it, though, considering it's probably for the better it is consumed well-paced. A decent representation of Yeti, but I would probably lean towards one of the others."
"Drinkability- Fuller mouthfeel makes this a sipper, but overall besides the nose, we have a winner."
"There are subtle notes of the chocolate that hint to what this could have been, but alas they ruined it by unbalancing everything terribly by making this a strange pepper brew."
"Drinkability overall is pretty killer for the flavors and additives in this brew, not something I would have guessed I enjoyed this much. As for their Oak aged DIPA, that's another story. This builds on something they've done great to improve it a couple notches, while I feel the 15th Anniversary downgrades their past efforts in brewing the Imperial pales."
"Mouthfeel is medium full bodied, chewy, and a nit different."
"I can't find much to fault with this beer, except to ask how many variations are necessary? Not sure what variation GD will try next, they've hit all the majors by now. Maybe bourbon barrel?"
"The beer pours a blackish brown color with good head retention and lacing. On the nose, I get bittersweet dark chocolate, fudge brownies, espresso and licorice. This really smells pretty good. Flavors on the palate genearlly replicate the nose, but with more licorice and some serious hoppy bitterness in the finish. This beer has a huge presence on the palate, with a very full and intense mouthfeel. Also, while the beer starts out with some moderate sweetness, the hoppy bitterness balances that sweetness very nicely, giving the beer something of a dry, bitter finish. Drinkability is OK, but there is no way I could see myself having more then a single glass at a sitting. Nevertheless, this is another impressive offering from Great Divide."
"This beer let me down. I was expecting a chocolate stout superior to Southern Tiers, but this just doesn't reach that height. I am being a tad harsh on the beer, but the other three Yetis easily make it in my favorite Imperial Stouts of all time. This is a very good beer, and I highly recommend it. Just don't expect this to knock your socks off. If you go into the beer with lower expectations, you might like it more than I did."
"This is an excellent beer but the sweet and thickness makes it difficult to drink more then one. One of the best I've had despite my lower numbers on the mouthfeel and drinkabiliy. In fact the sweetness is the only thing that kept me from giving a 5 on the taste. If you see it buy it, let it warm and sip it. Chocolate oak aged Yeti is going to be a guilty pleasure of mine."
"Overall, my favorite Yeti so far, though I have yet to try the Espresso Oak Aged. Come with my recommendation, though I could imagine some finding the cayenne a bit offputting, so drinker beware."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: This is a very smooth full bodied beer. I like the peppery mouthfeel from the cayenne. The alcohol is really restrained. This is a very easy to drink Double Stout. I was hoping for more roasted and toasted characteristics. I guess I was wanting a bit more over the top. Thanks for trying."
"Chocolate yeti is a black stout, i saw that one coming a mile away. Not pitch black, but a dark beer with some brown highlights on the edges. Poured with a mocha colored head that faded leaving minimal lace. The smell was that of chocolate backed by dark malts and a splash of vanilla. The taste pretty much is equal with the chocolate up front and the malt addition a bit larger than in smell. Some roast and just a small hint of weak coffee. The vanilla did not come through much. The feel is above medium, smooth and rich. The chocolate coats the mouth and sticks for a bit. Carb is low. The drinkability is O.K. as the alc is high and the taste is big and one sided towards sweetness. A few more hops would of been welcome. A nice addition to the family."
"D: As stated above this is easy going down. This is a very complex beer and very enjoyable. So far I love the whole Yeti line. I really recommend this to people who enjoy the dark stuff."
"Could only drink one of this in a sitting. Very heavy but deliscious!"
"An interesting beer, as it has the sweetness of chocolate with the contrasting spice of the pepper. Either bottle or on-tap, I still like the espresso version the best, but this is definitely an interesting brew that anyone can enjoy. Recommended."
"Pours an appropriate dark color with a light ring of bubbly head which persists to the end. Aroma is more subdued than expected. There's a bit of cocoa, but a stronger note of wood in the nose (especially when it warms). The taste is richer with stronger semi-sweet cocoa up front, but then the wood kicks in. Once the wood kicks in, it doesn't let up and eventually becomes the dominating flavor in the finish. This brew is not as chocolaty as I was expecting, but it might be that the wood is just overpowering the chocolate. I'm not enjoying the wood in this brew. It's very obvious, and I find it an odd addition. I really wish GD would make beers like this chocolate Yeti and the espresso Yeti, but without the wood."
"D - Excellent beer. There was a lot of hype and it didnt disapoint. Would have liked a little more chocolate and oak flavors, but the way it was constructed was fantastic."
"Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, with a nice alcohol bite. Honestly, as this warmed to room temperature, I found the alcohol came out more and more, so I would serve this at slightly below room temperature to maximize the flavor and aroma without drowning it in alcohol. Drinkability is great, I had no problem finishing the bomber by myself."
"M/D: Smooth and creamy with only a touch of tingly carbonation. Extremely pleasing. The cayenne is a very compelling flavor and it adds a lot to the beer."
"Pour is super dark.. black and quite viscous with a tan head. The only way it could be better would be with a darker head. Aroma is certainly a bit chocolatey and oak but sort of reserved.. Some floral hops in there as well. Flavor has a sort of milk chocolate presence, like chocolate milk (more so than just blatant bitter dark chocolate).. There is some bitterness.. surprisingly not that sweet overall. The addition of the cayenne pepper is present in the end of the sip and the aftertaste and adds an interesting little flare. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with a good level of carbonation but it is missing a little bit of something. Its on the border of greatness and a really full, silky feel that you want in an impy stout but at the same time has a certain lightness that could be improved upon. Overall its certainly nice but a bit letting down. Definitely deserves a high score, but the let down is that I was hoping to be blown away with an A+. Towards the end of the bottle you may not be relishing every sip."
"Poured into a 20 oz imperial pint glass. Dark brown with no penetrating light. Light to moderate lacing. First sniff is very intense, coffee, cocoa, vanilla, dark fruit. The taste is amazing. So much going on at once. The cocoa is very prominent, the alcohol is almost burning at times. Bittersweet chocolate is the strongest flavor i'm sensing at first but as it crosses the palate, coffee and dried fruit, molasses, burnt sugar are all present. This beer is perfectly carbonated and is very enjoyable."
"A decent beer, perhaps a little overrated and bordering on novelty."
"mouthfeel is smooth but a bit thin.this beer kinda reminds me of new holland dragon's milk.overally pretty good,probably wouldnt get it again though."
"I'm a big fan of the Espresso Oak Aged Yeti which had a HUGE espresso taste. So, naturally, with Chocolate oak Aged Yeti, I was expecting a HUGE Chocolate taste only to find that the Chocolate was much overpowered by a peppery spice. I suggest, for what that's worth, that this bottle be shared by 3 people at minimum. I also suggest that this beer be renamed ""Pepper Oak Aged Yeti"". One of the more eccentric beers I've had."
"The flavors seem to be competing for dominance, with the booze and spice really overcompensating. The aftertaste was very potent and strong, making this a definite sipper. Perhaps this would mellow out with some aging?"
"D: A very drinkable Imperial Stout. Another fantastic beer from Great Divide."
"Roasted malts and some coffee bitterness up front give way to dark chocolate and charred, yet sweetish fruits. Slight metallic twang follows, along with solid bourbon, oak, and vanilla notes. Coconut and some fruit sweetness in the finish, along with woody hop bitterness and bourbon-y warmth. Full-bodied, with an a somewhat oily, yet creamy feel. Pretty good!"
"Pours opaque with better than a full finger foamy brown head that resists fading and sets to stringy patterns of Belgian lacing. The smell through the collar is subtle but sweet with hints of chocolate and lightly roasted malt. The free surface thing is aggressive and suggests a total richness to follow. Nicely carbonated, the mouth feel has a touch of heat from the 9.5% ABV that lingers somewhat. Full bodied and creamy smooth the texture coats really well and enhances the overall experience. Full flavored, milk chocolate, licorice with a malty sweetness and vanilla cherry from the oak treatment. The alcohol is present but not distracting. There are TONS of quality ingredients and a whole lotta TLC in this one!! HIGHLY recommended!! Get yo hands on this bubbas. I'm enjoying this on many more level than the Espresso product. Is there a stock option with the purchase? Great Minds do think a like!!!"
"D - A fantastic stout, not everything I hoped for, but pretty decent in the chocolate flavor dept. I wished it was a little more oaky with cayenne in the taste, but not disappointing in the least - another version of Yeti that hits the mark."
"Drinks a tad slow, the spicyness hotness is dragging an otherwise stellar offering down a bit. If you only have one bottle, save it until winter, or maybe even the next...First time I've really noticed this much hotness in any yeti iteration I've had. Still pretty damn tasty..."
"22 Oz. bomber shared with a friend at the bar. Chocolate Yeti pours an opaque black body with a strong tan head that sticks around a while, then slowly sifting down to a smaller layer. The aromas are strong dark coffee, dark chocolate, some hop character, vanilla, and deep dark malts. The flavor matches with a noticeable burn from cayenne peppers. Or perhaps that was the abv. Either way, there is some heat to this bad boy. The mouthfeel was exactly I imagined a 10% RIS. This type of beer is not typically up my alley, but it was enjoyable nonetheless--especially since it was offered free at my local beer bar."
"Thanks jyounger30!"
"D: Not gonna lie, I was a little disappointed by this one since OAY was so good. I wouldn't have this again. The mouthfeel really keeps me from going back for more. Though perhaps with age, more subtle flavors will take over the strong alcoholic taste."
"D - I'd have to classify this as a sipper, given its richness and potency."
"D: Oak Aged Yeti is still my favorite member of this family, but this chocolate one is a strong effort. I'm glad I tried it."
"M - Thick side of medium bodied, decent carbonation, extremely smooth."
"Great beer. Decent drinkability. Alcohol is fairly well hidden."
"Pour is a motor-oil brownish-black, completely opaque. It creates a rich deep tan head that rings the glass in lace. The aroma is of liquorish and chocolate, with some alcohol present. Much more subdued in flavor than I expected.The bourbon like characteristics found in many barrel aged brews is subtle. Some alcohol in the middle and finish with a noticeable heat at the end. Good, but I don't get the bittersweet chocolate taste and slight smokiness that I was expecting. Worth trying again if it were on nitro, otherwise, I'd pass."
"D: Very complex and flavorful. ABV will slow you down a bit."
"D- good sipper, cayenne is an interesting addition to the imperial stout, u start sweating from this spicy especially on a hot day...gets almost too spicy...1 of these is plenty"
"Yum. And I do mean YUM! Starts off quiet and chocolaty, like a snack of chocolate milk and cookies in the dark of midnight. Then, slowly, the hops creep in. Earthy, musty, dank. They sit heavy on the back of the tongue and open the gates for the booze to rush in. And rush in it does, as spicy, dark chocolate liquor kisses the back of the throat with a delicious hint of oak. The pepper is a decidedly amazing touch, adding a slow, succulent burn to the roof of the mouth with each sip. Luxurious mouthfeel, creamy velvet with a tight, prickly carbonation level and boozy finish. My only qualm is that the mouthfeel and drinkability degrade slightly as this beer warms, a phenomenon which should be the reverse for a beer of this caliber. A sipper for sure, but this is dangerously easy to drink. Damn you, Great Divide, for making such an amazing lineup of Imperial Stouts!"
"D- There's alot going on in this beer and I'm glad I have a full 650ml bottle to enjoy"
"Wow there is more to this version of the Yeti than I thought,cayenne...hmmm.Poured a jet black with a fluffy mocha colored head that left a creamy mass after leaving multiple sheets of lace as it settled very slowly.Aromas of vaniila/oak and bitter chocolate and some roastiness.Flavors start out with hefty roast and bitter chocolate with cayenne hitting in the finish wich is very noticeable by me,not sure how others have felt about the cayenne presence.Not sure if that cayenne presence is welcomed by me,its a bit annoying.I like the complexity and the uniquness but not my thing so much,although its not bad just for the record."
"Drinkability- Overall I really enjoyed this brew. It's still sort of chocolaty with out any crazy sweetness. I vaguely reminds me of Southern Tiers Choklot the first year they made it (when it was still good) minus the sweetness. Not that it has that big of a kick of chocolate, it just has the sort of big bold flavors. Great beer that I'd definitely recommend."
"Overall i am really impressed with this actually. When i saw it on shelves i though, oh great here goes great divide going crazy with yeti adjuncts, this is probably gonna suck. Shit, was i wrong. This isn't some out of this world uber beer, but its a great beer that i would drink any time and will definitely revisit. A fine and decadent concoction. Good work."
"taste is creamy, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, a roastiness, vanilla bean, and a little woody, end is dry and a little bitter."
"Poured into tulip glass black with thick brown head. Great lacing all over the glass. Smells strong like a bourbon and oak scents. The front of the palatte has a actual hop bite, that smooths into a sweet carmel taste. Then the aftertaste is a dark chocolate taste. The mouthfeel is a little dry and high in alcohol."
"I had this after trying the oaked version and the espresso version as well. This beer is on par with the other versions. A good solid beer along with the other brews that Great Divide puts out. Not something that I would particularly have again but nonetheless a good beer."
"Poured a dark black color with brown edges and a large sized off white head. Aromas of chocolate, roasty, woody, some vanilla, and smoke. Tastes of chocolate, vanilla, dark fruits, caramel, oakiness, and I was wondering what that mild burn was in the finish...cayenne. Medium alcohol in the finish."
"A fun and creative take on Yeti, though probably my least favorite version. It doesn't quite pack the punch overall like the others, and I'm not too into the spicy finish, though to be fair it is a light touch and not overbearing by any means. In all, though, it's a big tasty beer and one I'd drink again and recommend to others."
"Pours a dark and opaque blackish brown, touch of very dark orange in the corners up to the light, insanely thick tan head forms, very slowly drops down to a thick layer and ring, some lace chunks on the glass. Smell is neat, a bit funky, some wood, chocolate milk, roast, toffee, more chocolate, dark fruit, quite sweet, brown sugar, vanilla, pretty neat. Taste is nice, sweet and fruity, some chocolate nibs, roast, vanilla, caramel and brown sugar, chocolate milk, bit of lactose sweetness, some floral hopping, raisin, real solid hop and dark chocolate bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with medium carbonation, a bit of warmth going down but well balanced and a pretty solid chocolate character. Nice beer! Didn't know until after that they put some cayenne in here, real pleasant heat that lingers in the back of the mouth."
"I like this,"
"When first poured you get the malty cerial smell but that disappears quickley leaving a roasted bitter chocolate smell. The taste is malty, sweet, bitter, and fruity. It starts with the roasted malt and fruity taste moves to sweet and then the bitter chocolate hits. Smooth mouth feel with a bitter after taste."
"An excellent example of a RIS. Very similar to Ten Fidy or Stone's RIS. Can't wait to see what a year or so does to this."
"This is a pretty darn good imperial stout. I love the peppery after taste!"
"D - This is definitely a sipper, but overall, I really thought it was great, with a very nice complexity. Nice balance of flavors, and different than anything I've tried to this point. I wasn't sure how the cayenne would fit in, but it really just adds to the beer. I would not mind trying this one again at all."
"Pours black with a thick, dense brown colored head. The aromas were initially mostly citrus hop with some roasted malts in the background, but as the beer sat and warmed a little, the coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt aromas started to become more apparent and alongside the hop aroma. The initial flavor is a nice mellow citrus hop with some roasted malt and then there is a good oaky flavor with some warm alcohol feel and flavor. The oak and alcohol carry into the finish where it meets up with the smooth chocolate in the aftertaste. For me the flavors are just about the best I've had. I like oaked beers, I like hops, I love stouts, and I like chocolate (but in small doses like in this beer). The mouthfeel is full and creamy smooth with a bit of peppery spiciness that accentuates the flavors. This beer is awesome!"
"A good stout and certainly adventurous but unfortunately my least favorite Yeti."
"The taste is of bitter chocolate, and a very sweet vanilla note. The flavors were good but the mouthfeel was lighter than I expected. It is a little chalky as well. There was no perceived heat which was good, but I guess I was expecting a bit more roastiness to balance with the sweetness. I enjoyed this side by side with a peche mortel which was great, but this beer got a bit overshadowed."
"One of the oakiest beers I've had. A joyous beer for an oak-head such as myself. My only complaint is that I would like it thicker - it feels a little thin for a RIS. Other than that Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti is beautiful."
"Another quality Impy Stout from Great Divide. Not my favorite, but still highly recommended."
"Overall, a really interesting brew and pretty fun. I have to say that I prefer all other versions of Yeti to this one, but it's still a fine brew."
"D: easy to drink, but probably my least favorite yeti. Still a great imperial stout but the thin mouthfeel knocks it. Won't seek out again."
"Great beer. I didn't really notice much additional chocolate here relative to the other Yetis but the cayenne adds something different. I prefer the more balanced and smoother Oak-aged Espresso, but this not short on big flavors."
"D- The cayenne actually hurts this a little. Overall, a very complex and interesting beer. Worth trying."
"Mouthfeel is fairly light, slightly gritty. Pretty drinkable, especially for an imperial stout."
"Also the bottle says 9.5%, not the 10.5% listed."
"Definitely a winner."
"This beer pours an opaque black color. The head is a massive two inches in height, and recedes slowly into nice sticky lacing. The is a very nice looking beer. The aroma is similar to what I would thing it would smell like if one were to smear good chocolate all over an oak tree, and for how weird that sounds it is oddly compelling. It is certainly unique. There is also some roasted malt, and alcohol. The taste similar to the aroma. The is a very nice balance of oak, chocolate, and stout. The mouthfeel is full bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very well crafted beer. To put together all the elements found in this beer without having any of them clash is a true feat in brewing."
"Drink ability was above average, full bodied and rich. The pepper was more apparent than the chocolate which was kinda disappointing. Over all it was definitely a one of a kind beer but i still prefer the Espresso Yeti"
"Bottle. Pours black with a pretty, thick tan head that fades. Aroma of wood and roasted malt. Perhaps a touch of cocoa, but I think my nose is straining to find it. Flavor is completely dominated by the oak/woodsy notes. I don't get how they can call this ""Chocolate Yeti."" Just the same as with Espresso Yeti, they should just as well have called this ""Super Oaky Yeti"" and drawn a bunch of wood on the label. Blech, this is really too oaky and sorta burns your insides when you drink it..."
"Pours a very deep coffee black with a dark tan head. Leaves some good lacing down the entire glass as it should. Smells of roasted malts and chocolate, yummy. Taste is of lots of chocolate, malts, some alcohol and cayenne. The addition of cayenne really makes this beer for me compared to regular oak aged yeti. Not too much cayenne, not too spicy, just perfect. Mouthfeel is pretty much spot on for an imperial, thick and creamy. Drinkability in this case is all about taste (imperial stout), and this one was very tasty so its definitely one I will try again. The cayenne and alcohol might get to you after a while though."
"Notes: For the price of $9.00 or so I think it is a great buy to share as an end of summer brew with some BBQ. Buy it up if you can and lay one down for a few months. I would assume the chocolate would come through more and you'd get a great aperitif affect out of this."
"Probably my least favorite Yeti but that's kind of like saying my least favorite Ferrari."
"Drinking from a 650ml bottled secured from the Foodery and defintiely a unique taste. Apearnace, mouthfeel and smell all good but the drinkbility and taste are awesome. Had Oak Aged Yeit two days ago off tap and this bottle of Choclate Oak Aged is so much better. So much less sweet and and lighter than reagular oak aged and the cayenne heat at the end of each taste just puts it over the top. Enjoy!"
"Poured into a half-liter mug, this latest offering from Great Divide features a dark, completely opaque body and a thick creamy layer of tan foam on top. The aroma is very malty, with a rich milk-chocolate scent, but also surprisingly hoppy. Excellent flavor, with a lot of dark chocolate, fortunately not too sweet. There's a lot of oak through the entire experience, but it's never overpowering. High bitterness dries things out a bit at the finish. Alcohol is modestly apparent in the finish, though not unpleasant."
"Overall, a good beer, but not as good as the Espresso Oak-Aged."
"Quite dark and opaque with a velvet head of mocha pours up and sticks around for a bit. Smell is cocoa, some woody notes, lots of coffee aroma. tastes like roasted coffee beans, cocoa, espresso, slightly sweet, with a nice hint of cayenne coming through at the end. i absolutely loved the cayenne touch and feel that it really set this beer apart from many others. I didn't get an overwhelming chocolateliness from it, but it was definately there. Mouthfeel was thick and delicious. almost perfect for a stout. drinkability, despite being almost 11%, was pretty high."
"After the disappointing Espresso Yeti, this is a return to form. It's not as good as the normal Yetis (which I feel are nearly perfect in their own way), but it's at least in the same league. The newer Yetis add some new flavors, but they're still muting some at the same time. Depending on what you like - that could be great, or not-so great. In this case, I still like this one a lot. Cheers to another great beer from Great Divide."
"Split a bottle of this between me and my better half last night. Poured into my La Chouffe chalice. Pours a deep brown nearly black color. STRONG HEAD. Almost overflowed from the glass. Was not expecting that from a stout. Smell is cocoa, chocolate syrup and a hint of bourbon. Lots of chocolate, as the name would imply. The chocolate nearl overpowers any benefits of aging process. Not that it's bad, but it might need to age a little bit longer. Silky smooth mouthfeel. Overall, a good brew. Might need to age just a little bit longer, but still very tasty."
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/2"" light brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head shrinks slowly but surely, but lasts better than expected for the style, with very sticky lace and lasting legs. Aroma is vanilla, bourbon, and rich sweetness. Taste exhibits definite sections. Sweet dark malts to start, peek of hoppiness int he middle, and closes with chocolate, vanilla and other barrel character, warmth lasts and lasts. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, with drinkability good for the style. Excellent."
"D- Great flavor, I was surprised it packed that much alcohol. Would love another!"
"The entire time I was drinking this, the South Park song ""Balls, Balls... Chocolate Salty Balls"" was running through my head. It amused me, and made me more generous with the scoring."
"uhh, yeah.. another winner. looks like yeti, laces like yeti. aroma is a fresh, clean melange of herbal hops and cocoa. none of that tootsie roll southern tier shit. flavor of chocolate is muted but present, more malt-related and partially covered by the citrusy hop finish. orange chocolate? regardless, the choco-portion harkens back to the SA chocolate bock flavors, thankfully bypassing the past couple years of tootsie dominance. a sipper, yeah, but it's an imp. stout. it finishes caramelly with some earthy nutshell tones. damn this is a real winner.. a big notch above the wood aged ipa, and a beer i would certainly purchase again.. definitely over the oak and regular yeti. they've managed to find a balance of flavors here which the espresso yeti strived for but did not achieve."
"Lots of bittersweet chocolate flavor along with some underlying bourbon, and vanilla with a spicy cayenne finsh. Lots of roasted malt bitterness, though I am sure some of that comes from the chocolate too. Some barely noticeable grassy hops are in the background too. Not a very sweet stout which is fine. Nice smooth and thick mouthfeel. Slightly dry finish. This may be my least favorite of the four versions of Yeti I have had, but it is still a good beer."
"mouthfeel is thick, maybe a little grainy."
"Drinkability: There are some chocolate beers utilizing chocolate, cocoa nibs, cocoa powder, etc, that just don't cut it, but this one does! Thankfully, Great Divide's COAY is really well done, very drinkable, and great fun."
"Very interesting and worth trying. All this being said, I love American imp stouts that arent sweet, and I love high cacao content chocolate and cayenne; so I will likely adore this more than most. I will be getting more..."
"This beer pours a deep dark brown, almost black with a one finger light brown fluffy head. Nice head retention and plenty of thick lacing left the whole way down. Nose is of ...chocolate! Also, roasted malts have a decent presence with touches of vanilla. Taste is of bitter dark chocolates up front, blending nicely in to roastes malts and a bit of toffee, vanilla mixed more with milk chocolate comes in towards the finish. This beer was slightly lighter bodied, fairly carbonated, big beer that hides the alcohol extrodinarily well, goes down very smooth. This was a nice beer to enjoy through dinner."
"My guess is that on tap this is a whole different product. I am a huge fan of Yeti and OA Yeti...and Espresso OA Yeti as well. But in a bottle, this one misses worse than the October version of A-Roid. Next..."
"22oz bottle purchased at the brewery for $9. This looks like teh other Yeti's I have had in the past, black. The smell is oddly coffee grinds at the bottom of a filter but then segues into cocoa and dark unsweetened chocolate. The taste is more unsweetened chocolate, dusty cocoa, a little coffee which I get from the regular yeti and the cayenne is all in the finish, peppery. This reminded me of Viking brewing's Hot Chocolate but Great Divide executed the cayenne much, much better."
"Overall - loved this brew. Loved that it was not overly sweet, and enjoyed the spice kick at the end. It went great with the super sweet chocolate bar I ate it with. Highly recommend!"
"Full, creamy body is very well carbonated. The chocolate and chili pepper go really well together. Great stuff from Great Divide, my second favorite Yeti next to the BA version."
"D: Pretty strong and rich, so can't have too much of this."
"Very drinkable. Went well with brownies..imagine that."
"Overall, I had mixed feelings on the addition of the cayenne. It was almost like a double edged sword. On one hand it accentuated the chocolate flavor, but on other it was a tad bit too spicey and left a subtle burn on the palate."
