"Just as decadent and delicious as Black Tuesday, but with the added ingredients slightly more drinkable."
""
""
"L: opaque blackish brown with mocha lacing. S: vanilla, cacao nibs, roasted malts, fruity coffee. T: vanilla and cacao dominate, fruity and bright coffee; implied sweetness from the vanilla and cacao; vanilla and oaky bourbon finish. F: on the lighter side of heavy. Not syrupy or oily. Warm finish from the bourbon barrels and alcohol; not otherwise hot. Excellent! Big fan of vanilla and cacao blend."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A well-rounded, stunningly delicious and decadent world-class barrel aged imperial stout. The addition of the vanilla beans really thicken it up and improve the aroma and flavor. An improvement on Black Tuesday is a pretty big achievement."
""
"I have looked forward to trying this beer for some time and it sure didn't disappoint me.  The smell is amazing, the chocolate is the first thing that hits your nose, followed by the bourbon.  The taste follows the smell, with the chocolate up front along with bourbon and finishes with a subtle vanilla finish.  I'm not sure how they hid the 19 percent, you will need help, because it is sweet."
"Very rich and sweet. Smell is absolutely amazing, one if the best smelling beers I've had. Chocolate, rum, graham crackers, cherries. Taste is  good but not extraordinary. Like I said, super sweet. Tons of rich dark chocolate. Figs. Port wine. Feel is heavy but not syrupy, fantastic warming from the impressive abv. Overall very good, but not one of bruerys greats."

"Chocolate is the dominant flavor, but its balanced enough to allow other aspects of the beer to be appreciated."

"The taste is like a raisinette -mostly raisin with some chocolate in the taste  which is more on the dark cocoa side with a slight yeast flavor  and sweet dark sugar and vinous elements with a slight alcohol flavor that lasts after the swallow with so much residual sugar it leaves my lips sweet and I can taste the intensity as I lick them. This is one of the most intensely rich beers I have ever had -so much sweet qualities with strong alcohol in the taste which is the only drawback for me."
""
""
""
"one of the best beers I have tried"
""
""
""
"Had 13 and 15 back to back. Both are awesome, but aging definitely added some flavor."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just sublime...the alcohol character is well-presented and it tastes like a fudge brownie and the way your Granny made them, with just enough vanilla and wow, it just is almost indescribable...a challenge to hold this much flavor in a bottle with this much alcohol and to have it be so balanced without residual sweetness or booziness...a triumph..."
""
""
"I'm glad this also lived up to the hype.  I've been dying to try this one for years and was not disappointed."

"This beer had big expectations for me. Then it blew every single one of them away. I had the 2013 vintage. It instantly became a favorite of mine. Strong chocolate and slight vanilla give this brew the taste of a chocolate bar. The 18% abv(2013) wasn't that noticeable. This is serious perfection in a bottle!"

"Overall, I liked this beer a lot. Mocha Wednesday still edged it slightly, but it just goes to show how proper aging can vault a beer up in quality."
"Bottle: Poured a dark brown/black color ale with a small foamy head with minimal retention and some light lacing. Aroma of black chocolates with quite a bit of residual sugar notes. Taste is also dominated by black chocolate notes with loads of residual sugar and a spicy finish. Vanilla notes are more subtle but kind of help smooth some of the rough edges of this beer. Body is about average for style with medium carbonation and warming alcohol can be detected. Big beer or sure that need to be split up between a couple of people, but very enjoyable beer nonetheless."

"thin, hot. left an incredible coating on the tongue..... absolutely delicious."
""

"O- this beer was well worth the wait. Definite sipper and oh so tasty."
"Such a great brew. Tastes like a huge chunk of dark chocolate was dropped into my glass. Great strong beer."
""

""
""
""
""
"Way too sweet for me."
""
""
""
""
"Pour seemed thin for such a big stout. Smell was boozy straight bourbon. Taste was same and chocolate while present seemed lacking. Nice beer for ba lovers but too overwhelming for my taste."
""
""
""
"...as already mentioned, too sweet for its own good."
""

"Such an amazing beer that hides its alcohol very well."

"Picked this up in a great trade with Mike!  2013 vintage.  Pitch black pour with a quickly fading one finger caramel-colored head with minimal lacing.  The nose is huge chocolate fudge and booze, along with hints of vanilla, dark fruit, dark chocolate, and did I mention booze.  The taste is bold and super rich with once again, lots of booze.  Hints of vanilla, oak, dark fruit, maple, molasses, espresso, caramel, leather, tobacco, and milk chocolate.  The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with low carbonation and a great warming finish.  It approaches cloying, and it's definitely a sipper, but still incredibly drinkable for such a big beer.  Overall, yes, it's hot and boozey, but it's so good!  Much more upside than down.  Highly recommended!"

"This is one of those beers that I've been waiting years to try, and I'm glad I got to try it. Not an everyday beer, definitely a dessert beer and definitely a beer to split. Not for those who don't like sweet beers."
"2012 Vintage consumed November 2014."

"Chocolate and vanilla blend together well in this beer. Definitely improves as beer warms. Smooth taste with some mild sweetness. Delicious!"

"One of the best beers I have ever had. Poured black and smelled like bourbon with a little chocolate. The flavor was like taking a drink of bourbon but with a milk chocolate finish. So chocolately it was almost like I had a piece of chocolate in my mouth."

"Quite an extreme beer. Tastes great, but not without its problems."

"Definitely let this one sit a few years to mellow out. Would be curious to taste an older vintage to see the difference, not likely to happen though :)"
"Jet black with just a ring of tan head and no lace. Smell is full of chocolate and bourbon, rich roast, vanilla and a bit of liquorice, this beer smells absolutely incredible. Taste follows the nose and is even more of a treat than suggested, chocolate and roast, bourbon and vanilla, sweet but not near cloying, just a bit of alcohol heat but the 18% goes largely unnoticed. Lightly carbonated, full substantial body. Outstanding, I enjoyed this more than Black Tuesday by quite a bit and I really enjoyed BT, would welcome this again anytime."

"pouring it I was expecting it to have a thin mouthfeel, because that's the way it appeared as I poured. the smell was of vanilla and chocolate, and when tasted the mouthfeel was actually thicker than I had expected. right away tastes of chocolate and vanilla oak so good, and then a peculiar mapley finish as the liquid fades. This was truly a treat last night love this stuff would drink it all the time if I could."

"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 12/4/2013. Pours nearly opaque dark brown color with a small foamy tan head with poor retention, that reduces to a thin ring of lace. Some slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk chocolate, fudge, vanilla, caramel, toffee, toast, coconut, bourbon, oak, and oak/toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, vanilla/cocoa spice, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge milk chocolate, fudge, cocoa, vanilla, caramel, toast, toffee, coconut, bourbon, oak, and oak/toasted earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, fudge, cocoa, vanilla, caramel, toast, toffee, coconut, bourbon, oak, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Absolutely insane complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt, bourbon barrel, and vanilla/cocoa flavors; with perfect balance of malt/barrel/spice flavors with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is incredible. Alcohol is insanely well hidden with only a light-moderate warming present after the finish. Overall this is a world class imperial stout. Perfect balance and incredible complexity of dark/roasted malt, bourbon barrel, and vanilla/cocoa spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. An absolutely stunning beer all around."

"Lots of surprises with beer, especially with the mouth feel. The only flaw I found was the lack of head, which is a fairly minor one. For me this beer is nearly perfect, mature, and -excuse the language- fucking EPIC."
""
""
""
""
""

"An 18.5% ABV sweet bourbon bomb. The chocolate, vanilla and molasses accents are pushing this one toward the 'too sweet' realm."
""
""
"Oh man, I just don't get this. Beers like Bourbon County are so much more well rounded and incorporated to me. This is the newest release, so hopefully this mellows with time. Though as is, just over barring and not something I really enjoyed."

"2014 bottle poured into snifter. Chocolate brown in appearance. Was expecting black motor oil I guess. Huge bourbon barrel characteristics with some some slight chocolate on the nose. Medium mouthfeel with more bourbon and some sweetness in the taste and aftertaste which helps cut the alcohol content. Not an overwhelming 18.5% abv at all and believe the cacao nibs and subtle sweetness help. Very little vanilla present if at all. Outstanding brew. Hoping I can move from PS to RS to stock up even more. Curious to see how this would taste with a bit of age on it."

"Well lookie, they aged Black Tuesday with cacao and vanilla! What a great idea. This totally improves Black Tuesday in every way. The vanilla is very natural tasting, and the chocolate plays well. If I ran The Bruery I would find a way to make this a regular...at an astounding price. If only they could find a way to can it. Love that April Fools joke."
"O - One of the better ""big beers"" out there. Huge bourbon notes and the cocoa nibs give this a sweeter smell and taste over Black Tuesday. I wish the vanilla was more present, but overall this is one worth seeking out and sharing with friends."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown beer. Some bubbles form at the top. Smells like ale, chocolate, porter, coffee, cognac. Tastes like an old ale too, mixed with imp. stout. It is somewhat heady, and it will go to your head quickly. Body is a bit thick."

"LOVE THIS BEER! It has a very dark brown/black pour with a brown head. Aromas are very rich including hints of vanilla and chocolate. This beer is highly carbonated with a thick texture. The taste follows the aromas with a sugary and caramel aftertaste!"

"Phenomenal beer, the adjuncts add flavor and some sweetness but do not cover up the base whiskey stout.  The vanilla and marshmallow integrate naturally with the existing bourbon sweetness.  Best BT variation."
""
"O - Here I sit, reviewing The Bruery's Chocolate Rain in my Bruery hat, feeling kind of silly about that. ...And the fact that I just absently dropped a rhyme. Moving right along... Chocolate Rain shows some serious promise but like Bourbon County Stout, I couldn't possibly see myself truly enjoying this beer fresh ever again. If I crave hard alcohol (which I almost never do) I'll pour myself hard alcohol. Chocolate Rain's Tripel Bock-like soy sauce nose is immediately off-putting but slowly opens up to richer nuances, transitioning into a fuller, more rich flavor of chocolate, vanilla tannins, and some trace of actual beer instead of solvent alcohol. I never age a beer I haven't had fresh but I'll count this as a learning experience; The Bruery's Chocolate Rain will probably be exceptional with 2-3 years of sitting in a cool, dark room on it which is the only way I'll have a bottle of my own next time."

"Beautiful brown ale poured into a Firestone taster. The smell is intoxicating. Lots of dark chocolate. Lots of booze. Loads of oak. This is a whiskey lovers desert. The taste is like a whiskey white russian. Very amazing chocolate, whiskey, coffee flavors in there. The best stout I have ever tasted. Lots of boozy bite on the tongue and very warming, but very smooth for 18.5%. Bravo Bruery, bravo! Can't wait to age on of these bad boys. 2013 series."

"O- I think?? a well crafted beer by The Bruery. It seems their most popular beers have to have a sweet factor."
"D: A nice sipper and definitely a great feat in craft beer but didn’t quite meet expectations. It is chocolate and booze with some timid barrel character. I feel there are just other beers with more developed chocolate and better bourbon character. Would really like to spend some more time with this one though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Very good, but most certainly not worth the $40 price tag they're asking for on this. TCHO is one of my favorites and their chocolate really accentuates the base beer overall. Perhaps improves it, but I will only find that out as soon as I get to crack open my first BT. I'll be honest, though - it's going to be hard to find a beer of this type again that is as decadent and as complex as this one is!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a liquid dessert, much like a port or brandy. Would be fantastic with a flour-less chocolate cake with rich vanilla icing. This is a fantastic beer, for sure, but it's so rich is a ""this is my only beer tonight"" kind of beer"

""

"Feel is thick and sweet but not disgusting like DL"
""

"The front of its label reads, ""contains alcohol"" - ya think!? Chocolate Rain is a most decadent ale-sipping experience- especially for chocoholics like me. I'm sold!"
""

""
"overall this didnt dissapoint as so many of the whales have been for me. glad I was able to get this."

""
""

"One of the best beers I have ever had. Thick , rich and insane in the complexity dept. Lots of ABV but really noticeable, the chocolate notes are abounding but melded with a lot of dark fruits and thick darkness. So good that it made me verbally say damn and stop to savour the finish. Lots of things are said about Bruery but this is a good indication of the level they are playing at."

"Real good. Nothing spectacular. Would be better paired with a dessert in a nice setting. Would like to age a bottle for a few years to see how it mellows..."
""
""
"No head and very minimal scattered lace marks on a very deep brown but light getting through body. Aroma is dominated by milk chocolate and oak barrels and bourbon. Hint of vanilla. Flavor as my good friend describes it is more chocolate like than actual chocolate almost like a chocolate typhoon more than a chocolate rain. Obviously dark and milk chocolate dominate with large amounts if vanilla, coconut and brown sugar. The sweetness is really too much. Even as you drink this one it doesn't get any easier to bare the sweetness with the alcohol and bourbon taking a back seat even to how sweet it is. Full body and light carbonation, very smooth. Good but way too sweet for me. Glad I tired it."

"I could have sat there smelling this all night but I kept drinking it and before I knew it my glass was empty. I was expecting much more heat from this 2013 bottle, I'd love another crack at this one with a few years on it."

"very sweet with the heavy cacao quickly following. Notes of cream, coconut, and vanilla come through as the sweetness subsides with one last wave of dark chocolate at the end. The mouthfeel is thick with mild carbonation. Overall, a nice feature of cocoa, very sweet, strong, but well balanced considering its monstrous 18% abv."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an awesome imperial stout. Much better than Black Tuesday for sure.. the adjuncts do a great job of taming down BT's ridiculous sugar bomb aspect, and there is no heat in this. None at all. This is a treat, but I would agree that you have to open this bottle with 4-5 other people to be able to fully enjoy this."

"Some delectable flavours but lack of drinkability is a big problem. Going to sit on my other bottle for a good few years."
""
""
""
"Amazing beer but still needs a year or two longer on that vintage for the vanilla to mellow, I was bummed the coco nibs didnt shine through as much, but still, this is liquid gold, eould love to try older years!"
""

""
""
""
""
""

"The beer was poured from a bottle into the glass. It looks really dark and nice. It also smells good: very complex. However, I did not like the taste. Not balanced, too sweet and it also did not taste like 'beer' at all. The beer is also very heavy, a very dominant alcohol and sweet chocolate taste. Overall, the first impression of the beer was good but the taste is disappointing."

"For whatever reason, I still feel a decent amount of pride in the fact that I still have not seen the ""Chocolate Rain"" video in its entirety. Regardless, this stuff pours a very dark black-brown topped by a half-finger of wan sandstone foam. The nose comprises cheap boozy whiskey, wood, and a twinge of chocolate syrup. The taste holds notes of overly-sweet chocolate syrup, vanilla bean, toasted caramel, and bourbon. I don't ever say this, considering my sweet tooth is as long as an average femur, but this stuff was just way the hell too sweet for its own good. It's cloying, o'erwhelming, and wrong. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a semi-chewy feel. Overall, I don't get the praise this beer receives. I like incredibly sweet things, and it was too sweet for me. The bourbon is only there to color things in a drunken manner and provide an extra jolt of booziness, which itself is completely unnecessary, given the general booziness already pervading the proceedings. It was hard to finish my glass of this, and that worries me a bit. Not a fan."

"O- Ok, The Bruery. I understand you guys like your big bottles and fancy wax, but please make the beer taste better. This whole badass, high alcohol, wax dipping thing appeals to high school lacrosse players, but the beer inside doesn't deliver a level of sophistication that I expect from a $40 bottle of beer. This was a total mess and a huge disappointment. I really don't understand the hype."

"750mL gold wax shared at Woodshop 7. Pours a full haze mahogany, muddy. Tepid to zero carbonation. Nose is sweet tomato paste, big milk chocolate, sweet bourbon, dark cherry juice. Taste is very sweet, bourbon heavy, loads of brown sugar. Very sticky and cloying. More like an American Strong Ale, no imperial stout character (bitter, roast, hops). More akin to the Firestone Walker anniversary series. Somehow a lighter SRM than Black Tuesday. 7/3/7/3/13=3.3"
""
"All in all, this was an amazingly interesting and complex beer. Although I wanted to compare it to Black Tuesday (which is my favorite beer of all time), this was a completely different beast. With its lighter appearance and mouthfeel and its sweeter, boozier and more fruit-forward aroma and flavor profile, I found more similarities between this and Melange No. 3 than with Black Tuesday."

"Was a bit concerned given the chocolate content, but was pleasantly surprised. Noticeable chocolate on the nose, but on the palate it seemed to meld together almost perfectly. Rich and full-bodied, with a pleasant creaminess. Coffee, black fruit notes, chocolate (duh!). The alcohol is noticeable, but considering it is 18% it is surprisingly contained. Really good stuff!"

"Bottle from dak. Thanks! 2013 bottle (I think) shared with beastmaster. Pours dark brown (thin looking) with no head whatsoever. Big vanilla chocolate nose with huge sweet bourbon and a bit of licorice and woody oak. Big thick mouthfeel, velvety, with low carbonation but not flat. Big burnt sugar and molasses up front, with sweet chocolate syrup on the back end. Bourbon booze burns on the time. Packs quite a flavor punch. Serious sipper with a lingering sweetness that is rather pleasant. Starts great, harsh going down and waaaay sweet, then the linger is fantastic after dinner treat. Age might do this well for that middle portion which makes it tough to deal with more than a small pour (5 oz here). Only two of us, so recapping the rest for tomorrow."

"D/O: Impossibly extreme, though focused, stout that effortlessly overwhelms the palate with booze. While remarkable in some respects, it proves extremely fatiguing upon the palate. To paraphrase another drinker present at this tasting, it is easier to drink straight bourbon than this beer. Let's not be hasty--although the sentiment is not completely unfounded. This legendary project beer is best taken in small doses, or with a decadent dessert to help cut the alcohol."

"Like drinking chocolate frosting. Thick, rich, highly inebriating. It is, however, a one-trick pony. There's not a ton of complexity, but you don't really need it. Chocolate? Good. Stout? Good. Bourbon? Gooood."

"O- This was a fantastic high abv stout that was incredibly easy to drink and extremely flavorful. I was expecting this to be overly boozey but the abv was well hidden and was surprisingly easy to drink with all the flavors coming out very nicely. I highly recommend seeking this out, just be careful with how dangerously smooth it is."

"Leftovers of a bottle saved from the previous night, poured in a Bruery tulip. Dark brown, delicious and cohesive aroma of bourbon, raisins, a moderate dose of dark chocolate, and something herbaceous, almost minty. Sweet and moderately boozy on the palate, with rich dark fruit like raisins and figs, dark brown sugar, bourbon, super smooth and tasty. Long bourbon barrel finish, finally going dry at the very end with just a touch of bitterness. Good stuff."

"beer pours a heavy 30 weight consistancy, lacing decipates immediately, smells of straight bourbon with a hint of vanilla, taste like a dark expresso bean chocolate stout with hints of marshmellow and vanilla, the bourbon profile is extreme but pretty much what i expected from a 19.5% beverage. This beer is awesome, much better than black tuesday in my opinion and definately worth its hype. Might even be my new favorite, the only negative for me is that can be a little hot and its limited availability."

"Super glad I got to try this one - my 6 oz. pour was perfect - I would imagine that any more than this would be too much. The flavors were awesome, but there were two main things holding this one back from being a top 10 beer for me: it was a bit too sweet, and it was a touch too boozy and hot, especially as the beer warmed up. I guess that's to be expected from a 19.5% ABV beer, right? So maybe I'm being too harsh. But the beer was still damn good and the flavors were on point. Overall, if this were taken down on the ABV level and the sweetness was controlled a little better, it would easily be a top 10 contender."

"O - This is really a good beer that I liked more than BT and Grey Monday. It has such a great flavor profile that is balanced between the dark chocolate and the sweetness of BT. Plus, it was super creamy and smooth when drinking. This one was definitely worth the hype"

"Major thanks to F2brewers for sending me this one. This beer poured out as a big black color with a light brown head that quickly fades. The smell is huge, loads of chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, booze and roasted malts. The taste is just as big as the nose. Huge chocolate flavors and lots of vanilla too and a boozy finish. The mouthfeel is slick moderately carbonated and smooth. Oily texture very nice brew. Overall what a powerful brew. Really glad I finally got to take try this. Very rich and very enjoyable."

"Overall: Good beer, which is quite a bit better closer to room temperature. My memory may not be accurate but I feel the cask version I had in 2010 and Batch 1 were a bit better than the batch 2 bottle being reviewed. Nonetheless, it's a big beer that's a stellar sipper."
"Pours an inky black without much of a head that musters but dissipates quickly. The aroma from this glass is heavenly. Deep rich caramel and chocolate with hints of brownie batter, roast, vanilla and a fair amount of alcohol. You can tell this is high in abv from the aroma, but it never seems harsh. The flavor follows the aroma but the alcohol is a bit more evident but it really never harsh. Rich chocolate, vanilla, roast, caramel, and molasses flavors melded into a high abv sipper. This would be an excellent brew to sip with a few friends on a cold night with some cigars or brownies. Thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. I/we enjoyed the hell out of this beer tonight, too bad I may never see another bottle of this!"

"O: Overall, another big hit from the Bruery in my book. Its literally one of the best smelling beers I have ever had, and the taste is excellent (but not quite to the degree of the nose). Im very glad I was able to try this one, and will definitely seek it out again. As far as in comparison to Black Tuesday, I like CR more. Better aroma and greater balance in the flavor profile (less of the straight up diabetes-inducing sweetness bomb that BT is). I'd drink both any chance I got, but BT is great, and CR is excellent."
""
""
""
"O: I like this beer more than Black Tuesday; but I liked the small handbottle of Cherry Chocolate Rain (from cask) even more. I hope that comes around again. I don't think this is really worth $35 or whatever the cost was, but it's a tasty beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"(O)- Definitely a fun and successful spin on the regular Black Tuesday. To me it is a bit hotter, but still not as massively crazy going into it. Extremely rich though. I daresay I almost like the regular BT version over this actually."
"Overall a nice beer, and drinkable enough for 19% ABV. It's certainly not worth the hype though, and considering many in the group I shared this with said it was better than Black Tuesday (which I've not tried), that doesn't bode well for Black Tuesday. Worth a try if you get the chance, but don't trade away your gold for it."
""
"Poured from 2012 bomber into snifter glass. Poured dark brown with a mild mannered khaki head; the retention was light, with a non-existant lacing. The nose picked up some cocoa, vanilla, molasses, caramel, and paramount bourbon. The flavor profile was really impressive out of the gate. It wasn’t initially boozy, but it was very heavy on the cocoa nibs and vanilla. However, the booze hit quite hard in the back finish which pretty much dominated the rest of my drinking session. The malt profile was dominant throughout – more caramel, molasses, cocoa nibs, vanilla, dark fruits, biscuits, and some more booziness. Sticky mouthfeel with a thin to medium presence. Unfortunately, the booze took over the pleasant aromas and flavors which were much appreciated initially."
""
"O: Very glad to try this. Was very intense, but I feel like it could benefit from some more body and less chocolate. And this is coming from someone who's a bit of a choco-nut."
""
"This is martha stewarts double fudge brownies meets yoohoo spikes with pappys. unbeliveable when paired with some nice aged cheese and salami. had it right after a sour and it is one of those that your imediately mad you dont have another in the cooler or cellar. delivers a fudgy aftertaste that is not soon forgot. supreme stout"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Though the maturation on cocoa nibs is sadly a bit lost to me, I preferred this over its base beer. Where the alcohol in Black Tuesday came out just a touch more aggressively because of the sweetness in it, the added maturation on this seems to have mellowed out some of that hotness. Since there are currently no Choccy Rains older than a year and a half and the first batch is very hard to get, this beer will take some time before it reaches its peak. When the time comes, I'll be sure to give it another shot."
"o - FAR superior to batch 2. FAR FAR FAR superior. this beer is unreal. the entire group was floored by it and i don't think one of us didn't peg this as the top beer of the evening (and it was in good company with rare, black note, pappy eclipse, and other big guns). we even gave some sips to a table of ladies next to us and they too were blown away that ""a dark beer"" could taste so good. when we told them the ABV, they thought we were lying."
""
""
"O- This is good, but not great. It's on par with Black Tuesday if you enjoyed that, but it's different. I feel like both of them are constantly rated high because they're great for having such a high ABV, but that doesn't impress me. I'd rather drink a stout that's 12% and tastes better, but that's just me. There are some exceptionally complex flavors in this that made me happy that I tried it, but I wouldn't seek it out again. It's not very smooth at all and just too sweet for my taste."

"Bottle shared at Woodshop 7 at Beachwood BBQ in Long Beach. Thanks to whoever busted this one out. Pours dark brown with a filmy tan head. Heavy sweet boozy and creamy throughout, chocolate liqueur and See’s caramels. Rich and luxurious, ultra-sweet but quite delicious."
"Overall... gggmmmsssshhhgggguguuuaaahhhgggrrrlllggguuh."
"Overall ~ This is a quality brew. I think if I have another, i'll hang on to it for a minimum of 3 years before I drink the next one so the hardcore booze calms down. CR is Black Tuesday with cocoa nibs. It's good, but I would have just saved the cocoa and put out more Black Tuesday, BT is much better at hiding the heat. BT is just much better period."
""
"Pours a bit darker than Black Tuesday, very dark brown, some sediment, razor thin head around the perimeter. The nose had a potently aromatic vanilla, some deeper chocolate notes, prune as it warms, caramel sweetness, hints of alcohol. The taste has a big chocolatey sweetness and burning ethanol in the finish. The mouthfeel is sweet, but has a vanilla and chocolate presence that cuts through the ethanol (especially compared to Black Tuesday). It's not as thick and full bodied as expected, but the alcohol is well masked, even when it warms. This beer is noticeably better than the base, really drinkable considering the abv and heavy flavors"
""
""
"A bit light in the body, with an almost oily feel. Alcohol is quite warming, but not overwhelming. Quite the experience."
"Mmmmm!"
""
""
""
"Had 2 bottles. Finally just couldn't wait anymore and had to crack one open. Pours dark black, with zero head, zero bubbles at all. The smell is way too hot. Loads of alcohol, as well as chocolate, roasts, vanilla, and a bit of bourbon. Taste is sweet from the vanilla. Not as much chocolate flavor as Black Tuesday, and also extremely hot. Just too much booze. However, once you get pass the booziness, it is blended nicely. Mellow chocolate, sweet vanilla, and balanced bourbon make the flavor have a lot to look forward to. Mouthfeel, once again, just overrun with booziness. Full, and creamy, but the booze is just too much. Overall, I gave this a 4.5 based on how I think this will develop. I'm going to wait at least 2 years to open my 2nd bottle, and I think this will be amazing once the booziness fades. At the moment, I prefer Black Tuesday over Chocolate Rain, but that could change with some age."
"Shared this bottle with the girlfriend and some friends at Eureka! Burger last night. Pours a thick black color with little to no head. Some tiny brown bubbles. Scent is very sweet and boozy. The booze is very up front in the nose, which quickly switches to sweet chocolate and vanilla. Subtle sweet bourbon aroma with more intensified vanilla. Taste is not nearly as boozy as the nose made it seem. Very sweet though. Intense sweet chocolate and vanilla flavors...like literally eating some rich chocolate cake. I feel like there could have been more barrel flavor to this beer...and possibly a little overly sweet. Mouthfeel is full bodied and syrupy. Drinkability is fair, as long as you are sharing it with a good amount of people. Overall, I enjoyed Black Tuesday a bit more. This is a well-crafted beer that most breweries could not pull off (a 19.5 ABV stout that is drinkable!)...just good in small doses. Glad I tried it. I have one more bottle and need to decide whether to age it longer or trade it."
"2.5 D: This is undoubtably tough to drink and no one in my 'burgh tasting group cared for it."
"Overall - It's so over the top. Better than BT, but only because of the chocolate flavor. There's barely a stout back there behind the barrel and chocolate."
""
""
""
"I love it, but I think I loved Black Tuesday even more. And quite frankly, I feel like World Wide Stout scratches the same itch pretty well...and WWS is way more readily available."
""
"O: This is a sweet boozy unrefined milk chocolate bomb. It's certainly not bad, but it's certainly not world class."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A truly decadent beer. I haven't had an imperial stout over 14% ABV that was as drinkable as this one. Remarkable."
""
""
""
"O: I was not as impressed with BT when I had it as I thought I would but this definitely lived up to the hype. I could drink this all the time in small quantities. It does get cloyingly sweet as you get to the end of your glass but it's so tasty."
"OVERALL: This is a huge beer for sure. The nose and flavor are quite decadent, thought it suffers from being wholly too hot right now. This and the '11 Black Tuesday were way hotter than I remember the 2010 and 2009 vintages of the base beer. Moreover, the look was sad and the feel simply too light and harsh to really be an enjoyable drink. While the appearance is a lost cause I'm afraid, some time will hopefully let the booze mellow and the feel smoothen out a bit, which will move this in the right direction. There is a lot of potential here, but there's too much ""big"" in the way. Thanks again for the bottles boys. I look forward to seeing how this one develops with a couple years on it."
"This is a full bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is thick and chewy yet a smooth sipper. This is an impressively bold brew with a shocking amount of cocoa and vanilla inclusion (moreso than I expected.) As far as drinkability goes, this one is a brute and is not something to be drank glass after glass of. It is rich and inviting and something I would like to be able to take in small samples on multiple occasions, not try and tackle an entire 750ml of. Fans of Black Tuesday will love this but in my opinion this is really hot right now. I wish I would have waited a year or more to open this."
"O- Crazy beer! The vanilla is amazing and the chocolate ain't to bad either."
"D/O- Coco Rain, a real pleasure to sip. only BCBVS competes on the vanilla scale. Thanks 4DAloveofSTOUT!"
"O: I loved this beer and would love to seek out some again. It's Amazingly smooth, Tastes incredible. Chocolate/Vanilla/Bourbon Barrel Perfection! For it's 19.5% it's even more amazing to be so well integrated. Sip and enjoy this one! Thanks to 4DaLoveOfSTOUT for sharing this with us."

"A fantastic beer, especially for chocolate lovers."
"O: Well, I had a BT last week and I wanted to compare to CR within a reasonable time frame. They are 90% alike. The biggest difference I noted was the lesser molasses and fruit element in this compared to BT, and the much larger chocolate and vanilla factor in this as well. This tastes more like a stout whereas BT tastes like a barleywine/stout blend aged in bourbon barrels. Regardless of the differences, this is one big, complex and sweet beast of a beer. It's extremely rare to get a beer that is almost 20% that comes out this well. This might be the only one, in fact. Hence the 5."
"The mouthfeel is a little oily with low carbonation. The mouthfeel is a little thin for the style, but I like the low carbonation. Overall, very good but short of great. It's very rich, with some great flavors but the boozy alcohol heat hurts it for me. The bourbon barrel flavors just doesn't seem as complimenting, integrated and smooth as they could have been."
""
"O. Well, what a disappointment. Goodness gracious the hype train has gone off the rails on this one. If you gave me 4 more of these, I would trade very single one for some freakin' KBS. Just massively overrated, and quite literally diabetes in a bottle. One (maybe two) note and lacking in imagination, Chocolate Rain is admirably mediocre, but mediocre all the same."
"O: Certainly a good beer, but it's an aquired taste, I suspect. I found more pleasure in this then the rest of my tasting group, yet I do firmly believe that this never reaches the upper echelon of the ADIS style. I'm not quite sure how this got to the lofty status it currently holds, as I assume the hype train just got a rollin' and never let go. Do yourself a favor and hold onto your cellar's best bottles, as 'll bet they're better then this."
"Cost: $40 for a 750 ml bottle."
"Had this side by side with 2011 Black Tuesday! Gotta say that Chocolate Rain is much smoother and more mellow than Black Tuesday."
"Tasty enough. Worth a try? Sure. Worth the hype? No. And I'm not going to give a super-high rating just because it's rarity. Easily the best Bruery beer I've had so far, but just further convinced me that all Bruery beers are overrated. I have other Bruery beers in the cellar, but I'm pretty much done going out of my way for them."
"O: This is one of the beers that have made it into my personally acclaimed ""best things i have ever put into my mouth"" list. I took one sip of this beer, looked at BackFat and said, ""I feel like I just cheated on my girlfriend"" Others have reviewed this beer and said it has too much chocolate, but thats why this is a forum - lots of this goes on personal taste and preference. Chocolate Rain hits just about every thing I want in a beer. Cheers!"

"O: This is very much a novelty beer like 120IPA. While its tasty as can be I find this to be one superbly overhyped beer. Its not practical for drinking nor is it worth the sticker price. Glad I was able to try this."
"Simply put, this beer was incredible. It delivered on so many different levels and took Black Tuesday which is an amazing beer on its own to the next level. The fresh chocolate and vanilla flavors were incredible additions. Absolutely one beer everyone must try. Amazing stuff right here!"
"Could pair well with ice cream, or something else too sweet...like cotton candy."

"pour is dark chestnut brown with very little thin light tan head. The nose is huge, faint notes of chocolate, cloying sweetness, light ash note, tons of booze and a complete mess. The taste is almost as bad. The booze is overpowering, the sweetness is insanely high, it is completely unintegrated, the faint notes of actual malt body are completely blanketed by the huge abv and under attenuation. The body is thick and heavy, high carbonation. The burn and finish are similar to straight liquor mixed with pure sugar."

"O: This beer definitely needs some time. I enjoyed the sweetness from the vanilla but it couldn't quite cut the big boozy bourbon. I'm glad I still have one in the cellar that I can revisit in a year or two."
"Overall this beer is fantastic and will be amazing with about two years age IMO. Can't wait to revisit."

"O - I love the aroma, I love the flavor, but it is still too hot. I'm not sure how long this needs to mellow out, but I'd say at least another 6 months. The only reason my score is so high on the flavor is because there is a lot of great stuff going on. However, the underlying heat brings the beer down overall."
"D - Pure indulgence in liquid form. CR better serves as a dessert beer. BT seems more fitting for individual beer exploration - I think it has a bit more complexity. CR blows your mind off in flavor robustness and depth."

"Pours a murky dark brown with a khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, wood, and bourbon. Taste is of dark roasted malt, cocoa nibs, vanilla, bourbon, and wood flavors on the aftertaste. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good stout with some excellent barrel aging going on. I am thrilled I was finally able to try this one."

"Overall: Amazing. That's all you need to know."
"Overall, this is one of the best beers I've ever consumed. Glad I got to share it with a great group of BAs too! Met or exceeded all of my expectations, minus the body. Cannot wait to sample it on draft this weekend at the Bruery Reserve Society event, and I'm excited about the bottles I'm getting from this year's batch!"
"Overall, a delicious improvement from BT 11, I guess it has to do with the cocoa, vanilla, and aging. A decadent dessert beer that isn't overly sweet. Looking forward to trying my 2012 vintages."

"Incredible, though I prefer Black Tuesday."

"Overall this was stupendous and a great treat to sample. There is no feasible way I could finish this by myself or probably even with another person just because of its luscious flavor profile. Highly recommended for all beer geeks and absolutely a must try; definitely one to trade for and share with a couple beer geek buddies."

"Pours a dark brown with a few bubbles - no head to speak of. It's pretty clear, not as opaque as I'd expected. The smell is heavy on the bourbon, with some sweet notes of cocoa and vanilla. The taste is big sweet chocolate upfront, some notes of oak and vanilla in the middle, with big bourbon burn at the end. The vanilla became more prominent as it warmed. It's fairly thin, moderately carbonated, easy on the tongue. A nice beer."

"o - Overall I thought this is a fantastic beer; I think I actually like it a bit better than the normal BT as it had more sweet chocolate, especially in the taste. I love chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon in beers, and this blends all three in a great way. A top notch RIS; very glad I'll get another bottle in the Reserve Society next year."
""
"The beer is dark brown with a thin, beige head. The aroma brings roast, booze, chocolate, vanilla. Smells great. The flavor takes it up a notch. A huge dose of vanilla, followed by chocolate, oak, and light roast with a warming alcoholic finish. Just superb. A beer to savor. Highly recommended."

"Overall: This is a good beer, but didn't quite live up to the hype for me. I would love to try it again with some age on it, but we'll have to see if that happens."

"O: This is crazy good for a beer so bold and with such a high ABV as this one. Very rich and flavorful, yet wonderfully smooth and integrated. Thanks for the ounces, Jeff."
""
""
"Chocolate flavor present throughout. Might have been the best beer I've tasted."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. As much as I was surprised at the flavors in this, the fact of the matter is that this is to epitome of a sipper. The alcohol isn't offensively hot, but it really creeps up on you (especially when you are drinking it side-by-side with Black Tuesday and drinking it during a large tasting) and the flavors are special, robust, and long-lasting enough that several sips are enough to last you a good amount of time before reaching that glass again. It certainly lives up to the hype and is one of the most unique and flavorful stout's I've ever had, but you need to split this since it is too much for one mere mortal to drink alone."
"O: Overall this was the best beer I've ever had. I'm aware it might not be the highest rated beer on this site, but this was simply the cream of the crop. Blew me away. The drinkability is not terribly high, as the sweetness and extreme ABV are not easy to deal with, but this category is now considered 'Overall,' and overall it is a 5."

"Big thanks to heyohhh and mcdiddypop for sharing many fantastic brews. The elusive Chocolate Rain pours with a fairly standard appearance: near-black, with a very slight collar of deep umber froth; the only surpise is that it has relatively thinner viscosity. The nose is pure chocolate deliciousness with a surprisingly lowbrow reference: it is highly evocative of Nestle Quik powder. There is almost no booze to be found in either aroma or flavor, which is truly a feat, given the ABV. And it is quite delicious, flavor-wise, with chocolate-coffee-candy-liqueur notes akin to Black Russians or Espresso Martinis. The body is fairly light for a Stout, and in this case, it serves the brew very well. I am not sure if I prefer this to Black Tuesday, but I am sure that they are both phenomenal."

"O- Wow huge beer, not the greatest BA stout, but very satisfying, not really balanced, really hot as it goes down, still a great experience and very grateful to Lenny for bringing this beer."
"Overall: A great beer. I probably prefer more Black Tuesday for longer drinks or bigger pours, but it's a stellar beer that must be tried!"
"I liked this better than Black Tuesday but less than S'More Tuesday."
"Overall: delicious. Very drinkable. Alcoholic chocolate milk."
"O - Overall, a crazy experience. I like it more than I probably should, but I don't totally mind burning. Absolutely ecstatic to get to try it!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"O: Just awful. I hate to say this, but I was really excited for this beer and it is simply overrated. Too boozy, not thick enough for the style, and a complete disaster start-to-finish. I can’t help but think this beer is overhyped after trying it. I would never trade for it going forward, but it is possible this bottle could have been off. I’m thinking not, but maybe so. I will not go out of my way to try this again in the future, but if it happens to land in front of me, I’d be willing to give it another shot."
"O: This beer tastes as if someone took Nesquick, mixed it with water instead of milk, then dropped in a couple of shots of vodka. There is absolutely no depth or complexity to this beer and it is oddly thin for a Imp Stout as well. Drinkable, but certainly doesn't live up to hype."
"O- This was a pretty disappointing beer. Really boozy and not too complex. The aroma was the best attribute. Am I glad I got to try it? Absolutely. Would I trade my cellar for it? No."
"Overall: Of the stouts we had on this night, this ranked third in my book behind BA Speedway and Hunaphu's. However, all three of those beers were close, and the fact that this one outweighs each of those by ~7% really says something: given the ABV, this is unbelievably tasty and drinkable. As good as Black Tuesday? I don't think so. But it's certainly close."
"O - I think I like BT better than CR. This is a lot more boozy than I thought it would be and the chocolate seems to have died down a bit on my bottle. This would probably be better fresh. Still a good beer."
"As it stands, I would definitely take a year-old bottle of Black Tuesday over Chocolate Rain. However, I'm curious to see what future batches of Rain will be like."
"thanks to Mike for a perfect beer to end the night with... pours a medium brown, shocked how much lighter than black tuesday this is, medium tan head is gone right away... smells like a chocolate brownie, super decadent, no alcohol or vanilla... tastes just like it smells, tons of chocolate, cocoa nibs all over this, no vanilla again, a bit rich to drink a ton of but still enjoyable and very drinkable for the abv"
"Overall - I think with a year or more on it might calm down the alcohol bite, but with that said I would love to get my hands on a bottle."
"O- Incredible. Given the hefty ABV this is a masterpiece of a beer. Extremely well integrated flavors make for an exceptional chocolate/ bourbon experience. A sipper for sure, but as big, chocolate Impy stouts go, this has no equal. Highly recommended!"
"Had this at the Indy Summer Brewfest HUGE thanks to Bob for letting me try this! This poured black with a light brown head. This smelled of chocoalte heaven. You can smell the chocolate and hints of bourbon with vanilla. The taste matches the smell and hides the alcohol well. You can tell that it is 18% but it does hide it well. Nice and thick chocolatey goodness that coats the mouth well. Overall this beer lived up to the hype and I'm fortunate to have met Bob and was able to try this great beer."
"Batch 1. First off, oh my god. Eternal thanks to Bob for this one. It pours a dark molasses esque brown in color and poured very thick and syrupy. It smells like sweet chocolate syrup with a touch of roasted malts. It's awesome and very well integrated. It tastes of sweet yet not cloyingly sweet milky chocolate with a touch of coffee. The bitterness at the end is light and compliments the sweetness quite well. It drinkable thick and syrupy but drinks well for the size of this monster. Great beer. I almost hate when beers live up to the hype like this one does. Phenomenal beer, and actually a nice upgrade of Black Tuesday."
"Huge thanks to Dstructo for sharing a cooler full of Bruery gems. Dark brown/black pour with a small brown head. Wonderful chocolate, malt, vanilla, and bourbon aromas. The taste is wild and totally reminds me of Coco Puffs. Very smooth for a 19.5%. Just an outstanding stout from the guys in Placentia.."
"Carbonation is on the low side, still adequate though. This was a treat, and was the beer I was looking forward to most at the tasting. I'd definitely try it again any time it might be offered."
"O: This needs some time to mellow out. Maybe a year or longer for the flavors meld."
"overall this had to be the thickest, smoothest and creamiest beer I have ever had. I crave a good stout that has the consistency and feel of a chocolate shake, this almost one upped that,"
"O- very pleased with it, i love chocolate tho, if you don't you'll hate this beer.. chocolate is very present in smell and taste."
"O: Overall, this beer was simply incredible and lived up to it's name. Definitely felt the abv, but enjoyed every drop of it! Hope to come across another bottle of this in the future."
"Overall a fantastic beer glad I had it and with their up in production of these beers hopefully I can get some of this next year."
"O: A great smelling beer that just has too much alcohol taste for my palate. I prefer smooth beers, and this is far from smooth."
"Pours a nice dark brown with a reddish hue. No real head on this one. Smells chocolate heavy and incredibly boozy. Tastes sweet and harsh. The booziness is overpowering. Needs more time i think. Lots of sweet maltiness but the booziness kills it. Overall interesting but too much!"
"O- great beer. Lives up to the hype"
"Thanks again Wim, a real treat..."
"Cheers!"
" The flavor is more of the same and is also great. I get a lot of boozy chocolate as well as a lot of bourbon, oak, vanilla and maple. Even though the beer is pretty boozy, it is still very easy to drink. The barrel aging has done great things to the base stout, imparting several different flavors that all meld very well together. Low carbonation and thick, creamy mouthfeel."
"Overall: Special beer, huge complexity and long finish even after our normal Monday 10+ beer tasting, great bourbon/vanilla/chocolate stout, and not cloying/sweet/too malty. ABV is high, and it's there in the glass, but not a hot mess for sure, I really enjoyed it."
"Bottle from our RS membership. Dark black pour, almost no carbonation and an aroma of vanilla and ethanol. Flavor is a combination of vodka, vanilla beans(picture a vanilla vodka black russian) a little bit of chocolate and finishes thin and very hot. I loved Black Tuesday(and really expected to love this one even more), but this was a bit of a let down. Out of all the beers we’ve received from our membership so far, this was the worst."
"Pours a sugar-shimmering black with a small ring of whitish-tan head. This is obviously a big one and it looks great. The nose is big vanilla, fudgy brownie chocolate, a touch of oak and booze, maybe a hint of coffee. Really, what stands out is the vanilla and the fudge. Could probably sit and sniff this for days. The taste is outstanding - big dessert fudge, chocolate, vanilla, some present booziness, a bit of bitterness like baker's chocolate. Really decadent and quite good. Rich, but in a totally different way than Bourbon County Rare. That flavor was deeper and smoother. This is a bit rough around the edges. The mouthfeel is fantastic, big, sticky with low carbonation. Overall, this is quite the fantastic beer. There is a touch too much heat and cocoa bitterness in the taste to give that a 5, but regardless, this is a fantastic beer and totally worth the hype."
"Silky and creamy, the high abv comes along with a surprisingly low final gravity, as this variant of Black Tuesday feels a bit thinner on the palate. Very complex, though less so than its non-chocolate laced brother, this is a phenomenal beer."
"Overall, I am glad I tried this one. A little too sweet for me (and I am a big fan of sweeter beers), and not as complex as Black Tuesday. Still, very, very solid!"
"Pours deep oily black with white head. Aroma is like vanilla extract, with slight notes of chocolate, alcohol, and slight wood. Taste is boozy vanilla, some chocolate, lots of alcoholic boozy sweet, not a good finish with harsh booze. Wow, did not expect this,but really not well done, boozy mess."
"Bomber shared with the MN crew! Thanks! Cloudy pitch black pour into a small snifter, no head, only a spare light brown ring. Smells like a bottle of vanilla extract, slight bit of chocolate coco powder coming through after the taste is in the mouth. Huge, messy and sweet smelling, cut by a nose burning alcohol. Wow, huge boozy flavor. Almost thin tasting. Flavor is booze, vanilla, and slight chocolate, messy ash. Odd carbonation level, feels like almost harsh bubbles and thin. I really like BT, but this beer does not live up to the hype at all. Just a thin, boozy mess, that burns the throat and nose. Don't buy into the hype."
"[Bottle] shared by Armin, Caleb and Greg. Thanks guys! Pours cloudy black with almost no head. Aroma is sickening vanilla extract, massively sweet, quite boozy, some chocolate. Holy shit this is hot. Lots of booze - man, this has got some massive burn, vanilla, can’t really drink much of this. Not awfully sweet on the flavor - the vanilla really thins out the mouthfeel. Retronasal is straight burn. WTF, this isn’t even enjoyable. Anyone who claims to perceive any complexity in this beer is either drinking hard alcohol daily or kidding themselves."
"O - The alcohol is a bit too much right now. I found 2009 Black Tuesday to be much the same upon release, but after a year, it really mellowed out and came into it's own. For what it is, it's not bad, just not outstanding and a little too much hype. My 3oz pour was more then enough."
"D - I prefer the base beer to be completely honest. This is a bit too sweet and hot at this stage for me to want more than a couple ounces. I suspect it will improve over then next 12-18 months, but I long for a bit more roast to my stouts and that is definitely not happening here. Still, as a decadent dessert of a beer, this is quite good - perhaps it should be renamed Chocolate Panty Dropper, as chocolate-crazed wives and significant others will go wild for this one."
"The flavor mixes the flavors pretty well, though nothing really pops all that much. From the start, I'm thinking that some age will definitely do this well. Some flavors could probably be blended a bit better. The chocolate is the dominant character. Beyond that, there's light bourbon and hints of oak plus a bit of roast and creamy, milked-up coffee. Mouthfeel is really thick and there's some residual sweetness. Along with that, there is a bit of booze in the finish. Nicely done. I look forward to revisiting this one in the future, hopefully after the flavors integrate together just a bit more."
"Black pour with little head but fine for the ABV. Aroma is a tad boozy with lots of chocolate and vanilla. Taste is amazing. Waayyy more vanilla than expected. Smooth as hell considering the ABV. I wish I could be more descriptive but honestly it is hard to put into words. The body is medium/full and carbonation is a bit too high. Some alcohol burn in the finish. Overall this is definitely a top shelf imperial stout."
"750ml bottle courtesy of Dak and Dionysus!!). Pours dark brown with red hue and tan head. Aroma has caramel, vanille and dark chocolate. Taste is sweet with the noticeable chocolate as well as alcohol. Full bodied with alcohol burn, but still subdued given the abv. This is a really good beer, but its hard to live up to the hype"
"Like BT, this is dark brown with a dense, brown head that recedes to a ring leaving nothing but gorgeous legs. The nose has chocolate, chocolate, vanilla and more chocolate. Intensely decadent, this has brown sugar, vanilla and bourbon. Like BT, it displays an abject lack of roast or coffee aromas, this has plenty of caramel to go with the chocolate. The palate is what you'd expect - chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, brown sugar, no tannins and intensely dessert-like. It's good for what it is, sweet and boozy on the finish, a decadent treat. Full in body with medium-light carbonation, the mouthfeel is rather tremendous. Not as good as the cask version I had, but still, very, very good."
"Overall/Drinkability: One of the best-smelling non-sour beers I have encountered, but the high ABV and hugeness of it really detracts. We split this five ways next to a Black Tuesday (which tasted not so good next to the chocolate rain) and we ended up having to take ""break"" beers (two times actually) before we could finish this one."
"O: Very good, stronger coffee quality than i expected/remember in Black Tuesday, strong complex and rich, reminds me of KBS and to some extent BCBCS."
"A gnarly beer, but so delicious. I want more bottles(haha)!"
"D - Finally a beer that lives up to its own hype. I made sure I got a pour as soon as I walked into the party and I was glad I did. I enjoyed the overall mix of sweet chocolate and warm bourbon. One of the best stouts I have ever had. Glad I have a bottle of this in my cellar."
"Drinkability:This was an amazing beer, and I'm glad I was able to share it with a bunch of people at Stoutfest's birthday."
"D: With such a silky smooth feel and amazing taste I could easily drink a second bottle of this by myself."
"D: For anyone asking if there's a big difference between Black Tuesday and this beer, the answer is a resounding YES. More complex and even more importantly, much less boozy so I can actually enjoy the subtlety that lies within this dark mystery of a beer. I wanted to hate this one, given my feeling on Black Tuesday but in the end, I just can't. Very well done."
"Drinkability: This is just a phenomenal beer. The booziness creates a tingling sensation on the tongue and warms the throat and stomach, but is hidden from the taste. Chocolate Rain has a great aroma and great taste; it is up there as an ultimate sipper."
"Very glad I got to try this one and hope I get to try it again."
"D - The drinkability of Chocolate Rain is just silly for a beer weighing in at 18.5% ABV! This is, simply put, amazingly delicious. I am honored to have had the chance to sample this exquisite brew. Thanks Tanger!"
"You want a beer that has a good chance to RUIN a style for you this is as close as it gets. to me this is perfection in a glass and ill tell you it infuriates me to say that because i didn't want it to be so. must try this again! hype well deserved."
"I would guess there might be multiple sources of high end chocolate going into a high end beer here (cocoa, dark chocolate, white chocolate etc. . . ). Can't think of any beer that is bottled that rivals it. Really, I've come to the conclusion that the greatest beers in the world are just all the different varieties of Pliny and Black Tuesday."
"Review #500!!! Had at the Bruery Reserve Society Party. Served from tap into a Bruery sampler imperial pint. Poured pitch black with a slight brown hue with a half finger tan head that subside to a minimal amount quickly (I blame the ABV). Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass (which was surprising). The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, chocolate, and vanilla. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, vanilla, and alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall impression: Good God this thing is good! It was truly excellent in all aspects. I can honestly see why so many people have been looking for the bottles that were released now. Glad I have one for myself. It hides the massive alcohol present in this one really really well. Kind of scary if I'm honest. This is an absolute must try, whether it be going to the RS Event or pulling out all of your trading ammo to land a bottle. It is TOTALLY worth it. But it is a sipper, so be warned."
"On tap at the Bruery Reserve Initiation party 2011. Pours a dark black/brown non see through color with a slight dark tan head that collars around the glass. HUGE aromas wafting out of this one with notes of dark chocolate, vanilla, cream, barrel, and a slight warming booze aroma. The first sip yields a nice medium/heavy mouthfeel. The flavors are well blended but the chocolate is very noticeable and pleasant. Other flavors include vanilla, roast, and booze. For being 18.5% this beer drinks very well albeit still a sipper. Probably would be best as a dessert beer. This one was great!"
"D - Slight burn, but for the amount of octane this beer has, the burn is every so slight. Dangerously drinkable."
"MAKE IT RAIN!!!"
"Chocolate Rain is not just a novelty, it really is an exceptional example of an upcoming style."
"Poured a very dark brown with maroon brown highlights when held up to the light that had a half finger of brown head and left some good frothy lacing sticking to the glass. Very nice bourbon vanilla and chocolate aromas pop out on the nose with cocoa, caramel, and toffee notes but with some booziness as well. The taste was also very chocolatey like the name says with bourbon, vanilla, and cocoa accents roasty character but did have a touch of caramel toffee plus there was definitely lots of booze but it didn't overpower the overall flavor. The brew was medium in body with a nice amount of carbonation which had a roasty, chocolatey, bourbon, sweet, creamy, and chewy finish. Definitely an amazing tasting black Tuesday hybrid that will knock everyone socks off. I'm glad I got to try it and was a sipper faux show."
"Drink- I wanted it all day long. It's potent, viscous and big. Very tasty and very pleasant. Patrick and the team knocked it out of the park with this one."
"I have gone back for repeated tasters of this every time it has been available for me to taste. They shouldn't mess with this recipe (i.e. Cherry Chocolate Rain). Patrick, please just make more of this and sell me cases of it."
"D: Heaviness and high ABV make this one to be shared. This would be an excellent nightcap. I enjoyed this more than Black Tuesday and wish it were bottled."
"Pours a dark, dark brown, almost black. Virtually no head, just a giant slick of oil. The smell is chocolaty sweetness. The taste is the familiar Black Tuesday, intensely flavorful and sweet but the chocolate adds another level of complexity without really adding to the sweetness of an already very sweet beer. The chocolate is very evident but not overwhelmingly so and is a wonderful compliment to this beer."
"Drinkability - For such a high abv beer (the highest I've ever had) it is ""easy"" to drink. I had no problems putting my pour down in a relatively short time (okay, perhaps there was a bit of a fire lit under me to try the other beers in the remaining hour I had). Nonetheless, worth the hype. Damn good."
"Beer has this creamy mouthfeel from the cask, its sweet and has some minimal bitterness on the back from the chocolate. The forward flavors are like a hershey bar dipped in bourbon, its great, its not cloying or overpowering its just really solid. The finish is nice and not too dry, a little dryer than the regular Black Tuesday but overall its a great beer. I would definitely have it again, only if they would bottle this."
"D: Enjoyable drink in small amounts, especially on a cold night. I wish I could have a few bottles of this and let it sit for a bit, opening it every winter and seeing how it changes."
"D- This is such a delicious beer but its so rich and at 18+% it is one heady beer. I could drink a lot of this though. Oh so good."
"Overall, this is awesome, and I'm not just saying that because I enjoy sucking down rare DONGs so much. Drinkable for the amount you should be drinking."
"On cask at Black Tuesday. Chocolate Rain rests a near lifeless opaque brown in my glass, only a few wispy bubbles floating on top show signs of carbonation. It smells like chocolate cake and booze-soaked vanilla beans - the complexity of Black Tuesday's aroma has largely been stripped away and replaced by layers of chocolate, bourbon and vanilla. The palate is equally decadent, and offers a touch more complexity in the form of subtle oak and roast buried beneath the rich dark chocolate and vanilla. This ended up being every bit as enjoyable as I was expecting, hopefully more of it is made next year."
"D-for its alcohol content, I'm damn impressed."
"D: A very nice stout. I was a bit underwhelmed as I missed it last year and have been waiting for this moment. Not as good as regular Black Tuesday for me, but in the whole scheme of things it is well made in its style."
"Delicious to sip, but I wouldn't want more than the 4oz I consumed on any given evening. A bit blended with Black Tuesday produced a spectacular brew... returning some carbonation and just a touch more roast balanced the sweetness and deepened the mouthfeel to produce something truly sublime."
"i had to move away from the glass to breathe in"
"All in all, this was grand. I would have given it all fives, but I just do not like bourbon. If you love bourbon I expect you'd rate this flawless. I would have given the taste portion six if I could have."
"The deliciousness of the beer is unquestionable to me, but the balance of the original BT gets lost a bit. A beer of this magnitude is usually either incredibly boozy or balanced with things such as malt sweetness, bourbon, or espresso. What Black Tuesday did so well was deliver the oak, bourbon, and malt qualities all at the same time to create a beer where everything is married together in near perfection. The addition of vanilla bean and cocoa nibs (not to mention the factor of lack of carbonation) amps up the sweetness to overpower the oak/bourbon. If you dig syrup, this might be your preferred brew. The feel is thick and despite being still was quite refreshing and very easy to drink. I finished my first pour of this before I even knew what had happened. The alcohol is just about nonexistent in this, which is absolutely preposterous. I had to go straight back for another pour. Then another... then... let's not get too much into details."
"Serving type: on-tap"
"The beer has lost balance and become more of a desert beer, but I can't argue with the final product. Alcohol is well hidden. I notice oak, barrel tannins, toffee, plums, dark cherries, and grapes. The sweetness reminds me of brown sugar. Blackstrap molasses is well integrated, and I again detect subtle black licorice notes. The finish is a satisfying recapitulation of all the aforementioned flavors with lingering notes of bourbon, vanilla, and dark chocolate. Full bodied with a silky, sticky, and viscous mouthfeel. The carbonation is low but fitting. This beer is decadent and delicious."
"Drinkability - I could moderately sip on 8-12 ounces of Chocolate Rain all night, as this beer should elevate it's qualities at higher temperatures. The 19.5% ABV is nearly indiscernible, respectively, thus permitting the drinkability at a whole new level."
"D - For a 19.5% beer, this is incredibly drinkable, dangerously so...very low presence of alcohol in the flavor (the other beers on tap had way more alcohol presence - Autumn Maple, for one). Should be a slow sipper, but tastes so good, it is hard to drink this slow. This makes a perfect desert beer all by itself."
"D - One sip can last a few minutes with all of the lingering notes in there. I don't think it's as drinkable as it's counterpart, Black Tuesday. I wouldn't want to have more than 8-10 oz of this at a time. It's a perfect dessert beer that'll cap your night off with a big smile. But I think it also loses something with 0 carbonation."
"D: As I mentioned in the taste portion of the review, the alcohol component is quite prevalent on the palate, and nobody should be surprised by this at nearly 20% ABV. But, it does detract from the drinkability, despite the awesome flavors and aromas. An amazing concoction."
"Bravo. What a beer. My heart breaks a little every time I've thought of the fact that I may never have this beer again. Makes me want to buy cocoa nibs and vanilla beans and try and make my own out of my Black Tuesday. It's THAT good."
"Amazing, but a brutal monster of a beer that really needs some carbonation. Fortunately, regular Black Tuesday is carbonated and much better because of it."
"hands down one of the BEST beers I have ever had the chance to drink. I read a while back that someone compared vanilla bean dark lord to ""gods cum"" well if thats the case then this is what god was drinking for a few weeks before releasing the vbdl. well worth the hype. in fact I dont believe this beer is getting enough hype. GREAT JOB BRUERY CREW!"
"Overall: I think I prefer regular BT over this, but this is a close second. A must try. Cheers!"
"Just like Black Tuesday, insanely drinkable for the ABV. Now, it's not getting as high of a score from me, as I like to be consistent in my preference for beers with some level of carbonation. While the thick mouthfeel is pleasant enough, I must admit that the pancake flat cask effect could have been enlivened by some bubbles."
"I preferred this over Black Tuesday. I heard some people say the opposite though. Black Tuesday was really really good, but this was even better for me. The chocolate and vanilla and on cask really took BT to a new heights. Wish they would bottle CR! I found myself struggling to actually order black tuesday over chocolate rain. But I did it anyway, and then got some more chocolate rain taste from a friend."
