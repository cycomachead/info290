What you smell will not determine how this beer is. The first sip it blasts you with flavors: chocolate, coffee, vanilla, a little fruity taste. I didn't pick up on the spice so much because I myself can tolerate spicy stuff. The mouth feel is silky and full I like it a lot.

4.04,4.1,4.25,4,4,4.25,4,"Color is black with a tan head.  Produces pretty much no head even on a aggressive pour.  Aroma has lots of roasted malt and sweet chocolate.  The taste has roasted malts upfront followed by vanilla and sweet chocolate in the middle.  Very mild cinnamon and pepper show up in the finish with roasted malt for a somewhat bitter finish.  Full bodied, creamy texture to this, no booze at 9%, and very little carbonation.  Overall, a very well balanced stout with the roastiness/pepper/cinnamon evenly matched with chocolate/vanilla flavors.  Only complaint is I wish the peppers were more prominent, but this is still a great, flavorful stout at a great price too.","CTbrew32","Dec 21, 2014"

Roasty, chocolaty nose with hints of cinnamon, cocoa, licorice, espresso, and vanilla.  The taste follows suit with big roasty chocolate fudge notes with hints of cinnamon, espresso, cocoa, licorice, and as it warms, the chilies finally emerge but don't overpower.  The mouthfeel is maybe a little thin for a stout, with a mouth-coating finish and a subtle burn from the chilies.  Overall, this is a really flavorful and extremely drinkable chocolate stout.","beerdrifter","Dec 21, 2014"

Poured a deep, dark, dank brown no head to speak of (expected though). Aromas of roasted coffee, chocolate, deep malty goodness, and a hint of chile (which became more pronounced as the warming progressed). Nice roasted malt on the palate, hint of chocolate... things were a bit muddled together... and some mild chile on the aftertaste (again picking up some steam, and a bit of the promised cinnamon, as the glass warmed up). Slightly watery mouthfeel for a big 9% stout, but a good aftertaste. Nothing exceptional, but it was good. I definitely have more preferred go-to stouts... however, I am glad I tried this if only for the exceptional label on the bottle, and creativity of Clown Shoes.","Mikus","Sep 30, 2014"

The cinnamon was all but nonexistent and the vanilla was barely detectible, making it a decent, but not particularly remarkable chocolate stout. I'd drink it again if it were readily available in my area, but as it stands I have to get all my Clown Shoes through the mail, so I'm not likely to drink this one again.","LambicPentameter","Sep 16, 2014"

Aroma is roasted yet quite sweet, chocolate sauce, light roast coffee, ample vanilla bean, mellow brown spice, and a hint of earthy hops. Palate is similarly sweet, spicy, and earthy, chocolate cake, coffee, cola, and strong vanilla with a slight bell pepper fruitiness, dried raisins and currants, wood char, black licorice, caramel, and a noticeably (for the style) assertive hop bite in the finish. Quite thick and the carbonation is on the low side, although something in the brew prevents things from being disturbingly sweet and syrupy even if this is on the sweet side for my liking. Quite smooth on the palate. Very slight detectable spicy heat either from the chillies or the hops (probably the former). Alcohol is very well-concealed. A rather solid dessert beer that doesn't taste gimmicky.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 03, 2014"

First taste strikes me as very complex and not necessarily in a good way. The tastes of cinnamon, dark chocolate, and bitter roastyness are all there, but they run together to give a cardboard-like taste and there's really no order to what's going on. The aftertaste is lingering and by far the highlight of the beer for me, this is where the BS goes away and a nice lingering bitter chocolate dominates. Nice mouthfeel, just a little carbonation which is good. Not a stellar offering from Clown Shoes. To be fair as the beer warmed it was considerably more palatable and at room temperature was not unlike chocolate milk.","slackattack","Jul 02, 2014"

Full bodied with rich carbonation and a chewy feel up front and a tangy bite in the middle. Chocolate and roasted malt flavors up front followed by hop bitterness into the middle.

An intimate combination of black patent, chocolate malts with mole' esque experience serving the vanilla/cinnamon/ancho chile experience in a glass. This beer is new to Ohio and Pittsburgh markets, I'm blessed to have options of good beer. These Clown Shoes folks are dark beer specialists, thus far if it's dark and it's from Ipswich, MA the beer can do no wrong for me. Dark bountiful body with a tan head forming froth fully above the rim of my chalice, leaving behind layered intricate lacing patterns. Aromatics offer up dark chocolate notes, hints of vanilla and smoked chiles, cinnamon spice combo that works so well together. Flavors bring the dark chocolate and adjuncts together to form somewhat of a liquid mole' suauce, I'm in love. Mouthfeel is amazing silky smooth even flowing carbonation big medium to full bodied perfect finish.

Very easy to drink, drinks closer to a American stout then a ris. Good stuff, worth a drink.","wvsabbath","Oct 24, 2013"

3.79,-2.3,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and a good example of the style, it does a good job of showcasing the added complexity that some of these Mexican styled stouts have with none of the aspects being too overpowering. It was very chocolaty and the spices and peppers took a back seat. This beer had decent drinkability, it was fairly smooth, creamy, a little filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention but I couldn't see myself wanting anymore after drinking a bomber of this and I think it's a nice bottle to share. I liked how chocolaty this beer was the most. What I liked the least about this beer was how light the spice and pepper flavor and aromas were, I think this beer could have handled more of both. I might get this again when I want a very chocolaty beer, but I think if I'm in the mood for a Mexican style Stout I'll grab Mayan Mocha Stout instead. I would recommend this to anybody who likes this style of beer. All in all I thought this was a pretty nice beer, it wasn't as unique as I thought it would be but it still turned out to be pretty nice. When comparing this to Mayan Mocha Stout I prefer the chocolate and malt base of this beer, but I think Mayan Mocha Stout does a better job at showcasing the spices and peppers, so overall I think I prefer Mayan Mocha Stout. Good job clown shoes, this was a nice beer and I appreciate the effort, Keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","Oct 17, 2013"

Certainly better than 90% of the chocolate stouts out there, but really, really suffers in the style and drinkability departments. Actually, I'm considering snagging another of these to sit for a few months- I've got a feeling it'd be spectacular. As it is, though, it's worth trying but not worth revisiting.","Lawl3ss","Beers"

4.09,5.4,4.25,4,4.25,3.75,4,"Medium bodied but not as thick/viscous as expected with a prominent spicy chili pepper presence up front that lingers over the roast and sweeter malt notes into a dry finish. Unfortunately, it's not as complex as the nose suggests, but the chili presence is more prominent with lingering spicy heat. Cinnamon and peppery spice compliment the ancho chilies and adds another layer of flavor to the already complex malt bill. There's a nice roasted malt character providing some dry bitterness but its not acrid or over the top. Hints of burnt toast, oatmeal, robust coffee/espresso bean and bittersweet chocolate. Again, I'm not getting much vanilla. It must be pretty faded at this point but there is plenty of dessert like chocolate malt sweetness to balance things out. Silky milk chocolate with lactose and baker's chocolate rounding things out in the finish. The high ABV is very well masked with little to no alcohol flavor, huts some warmth in the chest. Overall, this is a really solid beer. I'm not a big fan of Clown Shoes but they did a really good job with this beer. Complex and easy to drink with great flavor. Recommended.","corby112","Sep 29, 2013"

4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Got in a trade with icetrauma. 22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 10/22/2012. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, coffee, vanilla, dark bread, light cinnamon/chile, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roasted and chocolate, notes; with good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, vanilla, dark bread, light coffee, light cinnamon/chile, and roasted earthiness. Slight touch of chile heat on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, vanilla, dark bread, light coffee, light cinnamon, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of roasted/dark malt and vanilla flavors; cinnamon/chile notes must have diminished over age. Great flavor robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and moderately slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial stout. All around good balance and complexity of roasted/dark malt and vanilla flavors; and very smooth to sip on. May have to pick up a fresh bottle to see if the chile/cinnamon is more pronounced; but it was still very enjoyable offering otherwise.","superspak","0"

The nose comprises roasted malts, cocoa, cinnamon, brown sugar, and a hint of vanilla bean. The taste brings in more of the same, though here the spices take a back seat to the stronger contingents of cocoa and roast. There ain't any peppers to be seen, though... The body is a hefty-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a very nice spiced stout, but the lack of any chile character leaves me wanting a bit.

Sweet smell - for me, lots of vanilla and malt, no chocolate whatsoever; some booze on the nose, which is kind of expected but becomes too noticeable as it warms. Very sweet-tasting; again, more vanilla than chocolate, some banana, and there's a slight sourness in the aftertaste that I associate with vanilla extract. I am not sure what makes this beer a ""Mexican"" chocolate stout. I was expecting some cinnamon - either its scent or its taste - as it is almost always present in Mexican chocolate or hot chocolate, and the cinnamon's just not there. Very fine carbonation, which works well for me, but the syrupy sweetness just coats everything initially, and the sour after-taste gets a little unpleasant.","kaufmaal","Feb 16, 2013"

The aroma is purely roasted malts, coffee and chocolate, maybe a slight hint of caramel and butter. The lacing is as tight as virgin’s ass and covers every inch of the glass. The mouth feel is thick and creamy, and the beer simply envelopes your tongue with roasted malt flavors, mild chocolate comes through in the aftertaste.

The brew smells like roasted malt, chocolate, and some chilies and vanilla. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but the chilies are more noticeable now, along with the addition of a bit of cinnamon. The chilies aren't hot at all, but the mild chile flavor works well with this brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit creamy and slick with moderate carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, although I do wish the chilies would have been hotter. But with that being said, it's worth trying and I would buy this again in the future.","bluejacket74","Dec 25, 2012"

Semi sweet chocolate and cinnamon with a touch of acidity and some detectable vanilla and mild chile heat. The flavors work well together overall. Medium bodied and slightly chalky with a little more carbonation than I prefer in an Impy Stout but I'm nit picking, this is a fine beer. A fine ""Mexican-style"" stout if that's what you're looking for.","biggred1","Dec 17, 2012"

It's relatively easy to drink, and the alcohol,is well hidden, but it may be a tad too light- a little more body and sweetness would help the heat and chocolate to shine more. I do like the ancho flavor- it's mild enough not to dominate and just add an accent, but not so light you can't notice it for what it is, and it marries very well with the chocolate. Some cinnamon and vanilla flavors round it out a bit, but those could be deeper. All in all I definitely enjoyed it.","Georgiabeer","Dec 15, 2012"

It could have benefited from a slightly stronger chocolate nose IMO. However, there is lots more chocolate to be found in the flavor than the nose promises. The chile heat is only presented as a faintly rising warmth in the finish accented by cinnamon dust. The cinnamon and chile heat needs to be amplified by about 20% to help counterbalance the chocolate sweetness of the malt better. The ABV is rather well hidden, though.

There's some roasted malts in the back of everything. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, and fairly highly carbonated, and the drinkability is good.

I also get some nice cinnamon notes in the aroma. The flavor is a little more complex. The chocolate notes go very well with some nice heat and flavor from the peppers. There is also a little cinnamon, but it is stronger in the aroma than the flavor. Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice beer, glad I got to try it.","Mora2000","Apr 07, 2012"

3.88,0,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This beer pours a medium bodied dark brown that turns to black as it pools. It had a nice one finger beige head that turns to a sticky lacing around the glass. The nose is pretty simple, yet effective. It's comprised of milk chocolates with a touch of coffee. The flavors too are simple yet smooth. It's milk chocolate, milk chocolate, milk chocolate, with a light roast. I don't get any spice or pepper, and I believe it was supposed to? It's fine regardless. It's nice and chocolaty. It drinks medium in body and is very smoooth and light. It's a pretty nice stout, and one I wouldn't mind having again.","aasher","Apr 04, 2012"

3.55,-8.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Served in a snifter, a dark brown-black color with a thin chocolate brown head that receded to a ringlet within a minute or two. Mostly roasty dark malts in the aroma, and not much of anything else. Taste was roasty as predicted, dark malts, coffee bitterness and cocoa up front, with an underlying sweetness. I didn't like this very much at first, but with time and a bit of warming, the bitterness faded, and the mouthfeel became much smoother, some semi-sweet chocolate came out, though the flavor actually seemed to wane quite a bit. Still a decent brew overall and quite drinkable, but I probably won't revisit it any time soon.","Rifugium","Mar 30, 2012"
3.96,2.1,4,3,4.5,4,4,"Overall, I was really pleasantly surprised by this beer. The chocolate isn't as strong as I thought it might be, but the chiles work really well and are present but not dominating. The vanilla is a bit on the sweet side, but it works against the spice. I would definitely try this again.","Gosox8787","Mar 30, 2012"

Smells like chocolate, lots and lots of syrupy milk chocolate. There's some roasty grains and earthy hops in there as well but the nose is lots of chocolate. Taste is roasty with a hint of coffee and earth and again lots of sweet milk chocolate. I get a hint of chile heat in the finish but it is really subtle. The cinnamon I can't find but I don't really miss either. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a creamy velvety and slightly ashy mouthfeel. I liked this one a lot. Lots of chocolate, creamy and very tasty.","johnnnniee","Mar 16, 2012"

3.65,-5.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Both the body and flavor of Chocolate Sombrero are sadly much thinner than expected. Lots of chocolate, for sure, but the other ingredients get pushed aside. Slightly vegetal flavor in the middle and lots of dusty cocoa in the finish. The heat I was so looking forward to results more from the booze than the chilies, unfortunately. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and low in carbonation. I really want to like Clown Shoes, but I've slowly come to the conclusion that their exciting-sounding releases are just, well, slightly disappointing. Chocolate Sombrero is another 'hat' which fits that bill.","wagenvolks","Mar 01, 2012"

Taste mirrors the smell with the addition of a faint bite and a subtle tickle in the throat. Upon reading the label I see that this beer was made with ancho chiles, cinnamon and vanilla. Some nice notes that have ruined other beers with a more heavy-handed use. Body feels a bit thin for a 9% abv stout, but this also adds to the drinkability. Overall worth picking up.","rab53","0"
