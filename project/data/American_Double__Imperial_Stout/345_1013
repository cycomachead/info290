No matter how you classify this beer, it's truly excellent on all levels and in every category.

4.1,1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, best before 12/11/2017. Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, toast, dark bread, citrus zest, pine, floral, grass, light smoke/char, and floral/roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and moderate citrus/pine hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, toast, dark bread, citrus zest, pine, floral, grass, light smoke/char and floral/roasted earthiness. Fair amount of pine/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, toast, dark bread, citrus, pine, light smoke/char, and floral/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt and moderate citrus/pine hop flavors; with a great bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, creamy, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Russian imperial stout style. All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/roasted malt and moderate citrus/pine hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 09, 2015"
3.68,-9.4,3.75,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,"Black color with a thin tan head that fades and leaves minimal spotty lacing. Espresso, roared malt, citrus, and charcoal.  It's roasty up front, espresso, char and burnt toffee flavors up front.  Citrus hop bite mid palate finishes too bitter with an astringent burnt coffee flavor and strong hop finish.  Feel is medium and a bit thin for a stout.  Nicely carbonated and a dry finish.  Overall it's dedent, it drinks more like a black IPA, but it's far from the best no matter which way you classify it.  Probably will finish the 4 pack but won't seek it out again.","HopBomb515","Jan 09, 2015"

3.9,-3.9,,,,,,"Tastes of chocolate, followed by coffee and metallic hints, due to a surprisingly high carbonation, which reveals tobacco and earth in the finish. Smooth, slightly fizzy, creamy mouthfeel, medium-bodied beer. Taste converts from warm chocolate notes to a bitter, slightly aggressive coffee bitterness with bitter, floral hops. A bready malt-backbone adds complexity and saves the balance of this beer. The aftertaste is slick coffee bitterness with a hot stinging peak on the tongue and throat, which stays remarkably long. Well balanced, with an intriguing complexity, still pretty straight-forward heading towards the bitterness.","aleigator","Nov 04, 2014"

There's a bit of stout aftertaste but the bitterness come through more. I'll buy this again but if I'm in the mood for a stout, I'll look elsewhere.

Taste leads with dark fruits, and a bit of booze. One of the hoppier Stouts I’ve had. Chocolate and coffee malts aren’t quite as strong as in the aroma. Not the strongest Stout you’ll find, but a pleasant taste and easy to drink. This is an easy drinking Stout. Strongly recommended.","majorbase2","Aug 21, 2014"

According to the brews that I had listed, I was advised I would appreciate this suggestion. Watching the wonderfully viscus, onyx in appearance, liquid flow into my glass, I felt that I was in for a real treat. I watched in anticipation as the head developed into a beautiful caramel in color froth. Next, I brought my glass to my lips, fully expecting the chocolate/coffee notes that the brewery assured me of on the label, and that's where things went south. I chalk up what happened next to my inexperience with stouts because I was overwhelmed with one taste... espresso, BLACK ESPRESSO! The next thing I could taste was alcohol, which left me with a rather sour experience. If high grav stouts are your thing, then I guess this might be right up your ally, but for this "Aspirant," I will have to go back to the drawing board. I might come back to this beer at a later date to give it another shot as my palate evolves, but at this stage... I think I will move on.","BaalDagon","Aug 05, 2014"

The pour is a light sucking black with a tan head that leaves beautiful silky lacing. Aromas are a subtle blend of coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malt, and a touch of vanilla. The mouthfeel is creamy, rich, and smooth. Quite spectacular. The flavor is; thankfully, not as subtle as the nose. It is a rich blend of coffee, smokiness, vanilla, leather, alcohol heat, and a pleasant sweet caramel undertone. This is a well made stout that I can't wait to see how it ages. Glad a bought a four and not a single.","lochef81","May 15, 2014"

Plus, I am a big sucker for coffee chocolate notes in my stouts, and their absence is something missed for me.

Right away I'm hit with the smell of charred wood, then when I lean in closer I get citrus hops, subtle chocolate, sweet malted grains, and coffee. It tastes surprisingly hop-forward for an imperial stout: very bitter up front with that grapefruit hop flavor melding into the more characteristic flavors of dark malt, char, and chocolate. Again, though, the chocolate is subtle. The beer has a silky, medium body with a bitter coffee finish.","itsscience","Apr 13, 2014"

I've never had one that was so hoppy--and it's hoppy to the point that if someone had told me this was the beer that inspired the oxymoronic term "black IPA", I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest. I personally prefer this style to be much more easygoing with the hops--especially of the citric variety--but I can't in good conscience write this beer off due to my personal preferences. It is very well crafted.","LambicPentameter","Mar 11, 2014"

I read that imperial stouts were originally exported to Russia. That may account for the rumors of Russian women being overly hairy and their success as weight lifters. I'll settle for a good dry Irish stout or oatmeal stout any day. They are just so smooth when compared to imperials. Kind of like filing your fingernails with a fine emery board rather than a wood rasp.","lechap","Mar 03, 2014"

The smell is very complex, with coffee, char and chocolate fighting some strong hops. This may be the strongest hops precense that I've ever encountered in a Stout. The taste is intense as well, the hops forward and fighting the deep roasted coffee and chocolate charecteristics, oddly enough to a draw. This could have been a bitter disaster like many Black IPA's that I have tried, but been totally underwhelmed by. One could say this is well balanced for all the competing flavors creating a tumultous harmony. It's silky too, a bitter aftertaste, but pleasantly bitter like you expect from a good Stout. Overall, a very strong Imperial Stout, Victory can be proud off this complex, but very enjoyable beverage.","SFNC","Feb 04, 2014"

Yeah, it has a nice body to it, and the roastiness is pleasant, but I guess it's just not as... pungent? As I was hoping it would be. I'd have it again, as it's a very good beer, but there are definitely better options. Still, try it for yourself to experience an unusually hoppy tasting RIS.","Alextricity","Dec 03, 2013"

Amazing.","Shawn_Sins","Oct 07, 2013"

It's not the most chocolaty of stouts I've had, and although chocolatiness is pretty much my number one desire when I'm drinking an imperial stout, this one has other attributes. The best thing it has going for it is how unique and distinctive it is, whereas some other awesome craft beers might not blaze much new territory and just follow established guidelines (often REALLY WELL, though). Anyway, I can appreciate both approaches. And I gotta say again... the smell, what with that nearly exact rendition of a chai aroma, is someting pretty special.","Kuaff","Aug 04, 2013"

4.09,0.7,4,4.25,4,4.25,4,"Overall: This is a nice beer by Victory. I think this beer would be really nice after about 2 years of cellar time to allow those aggressive hops to settle down. I think this beers' hop profile just wipes out the malts of the beer and this beer has a complex malt flavor profile that deserves more attention. I would say that this beer would taste best after the hops are faded with aging and it would allow the malts show themselves off more. I think this beer has a niche as a beer that has great "cellarability" and its an easy shelf beer to aquire. I will probably cellar a few bottles to see what happens.","4DAloveofSTOUT","Mar 12, 2013"

The smell (for me) was mainly alcohol. I'm sure there are many more subtle aromas present, but the alchol just seemed to overpower them. Taste is toffe, molasses, caramel, licorice, dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, and a warm finish with a little bit of alcohol present. That's the part that throws me. The alcohol is very up front in the smell, but well hidden in the taste. Mouthfeel is pretty good. It's thick but not syrupy and not a lot of carbonation. It's not a bad beer at all, but difficult to adequately describe.","Mojo","Nov 08, 2012"

Aroma of roasted malt, with hints of chocolate, hops and smoke. Rich flavor of toasted and sweet malt, dark dried fruit, chocolate, burnt coffee, faint earthy and smoky elements. Medium bodied. The great flavor covers the ABV very well. A very nice, well made stout that I revisit every year.","LiquidAmber","Sep 10, 2012"

There are strong dark roasted malts with chocolate and coffee. I can definitely taste the alcohol here. There are some hops in the back end as well.

The alcohol is well hidden but you know its there, just noticeable to tap you on the shoulder and remind you its a strong beer, but not so strong that it knocks you on your ass later. Sip and savor is what this one is - and it gets better as it warms up when the flavors become even more robust. So overall good but I find one is enough.","damndirtyape","Jun 10, 2012"

You can smell the toasted and roasted malts as well as the hop bitterness. The taste is sweet at first then followed by the hop flavor. Drinking water while enjoying this beer helps to clean the taste buds to taste the sweet flavor of the first sip. My brother calls this beer liquid bread, I agree it has a chewy mouthfeel. This beer is not a creamy sweet stout; as a hop head I enjoy this beer. It is a stout that any hop head can enjoy or a transition for malty lovers to leave the dark side and switch to the diverse world of hoppy goodness.","notalagerlugger","Apr 11, 2012"

At the very edge of my glass I can see rising carbonation. The rad is tan, almost brown and stands a half inch tall. The aroma is sweet and with bits of toast smell as I open the bottle. My nose was truly fooled into believing it was breakfast and my toast was ready. I get more of a chocolate smell after the beer is in the glass though. In the taste I first get a quick punch of bitterness right in the front of the tongue, followed by a smooth bittersweet chocolate. I also get soem roasted malts. The initial pop on the tongue confuses me, not sure if I like that or not. As the beer leaves the tongue I am left with a lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick, but has enough carbonation to prevent it from being too heavy.","gkunkle","Feb 07, 2012"

The palate is boldly flavored with thick bourbon and coffee, underlying alcohol cutting through thick chewy layers of malt. Flavor opens up nicely to a lovely hoppy pine taste that adds an herbal quality. Chewy without being too heavy, it's a challenge for novice beer drinkers, but not the best imperial stout on the market. Still, a very good beer with a taste with some dessert.","ManuelHerrera","Feb 02, 2012"

Nose features roasted malts, coffeeish, some chocolate and a wee bit of smoke, with citrus and floral hops for balance. Taste mirrors nose, I thought this was pretty roasty upfront and became more hoppy as it warmed. Mouthfeel a bit on heavy side of medium, not sticky, good effervescence. A bit flat on the pour, may have been a capping issue. Really drinkable, the ABV is well hidden. A solid RIS, good interplay of citrus and roast, worth a try.","jdense","Dec 13, 2011"

I get a ton of pine from the hops, which is accompanied by the chocolate and roasted malt notes. There is also a little bit of alcohol in the flavor. Low bitterness. Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Definitely one of the hoppiest Imperial Stouts out there.","Mora2000","Nov 06, 2011"

4.41,8.6,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into 13 oz tulip. Pours a slick pitch black with a two inch sticky mocha head, that hangs around, with tons of lacing. Smell is citrusy grassy hops, some roasted malts, and a hint of tobacco. Taste is all of those things with some expresso and a hint of grapefruit and pine, and it really works some how. Mouthfeel is on the thicker side, but not the chewiest. Plenty of carbonation and very easy drinking for it's abv. A really nice imperial stout and the best bang for the Buck around, $11.59 a six in tax free N.H.

4.2,3.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a solid black with a quarter-inch tan head that settles in fast with moderate lacing in the chalice. A hoppy and roasty scent along with aromas of coffee. A lot going on here with a plethora of complex flavors. Specifically the roasted dark malts that blend nicely with citrusy hops. This is a rich and outspoken imperial stout and the tangy hop profile blasts away any trace of alcohol. A somewhat dry aftertaste of roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee. Medium heaviness and medium carbonation. A strong-armed stout from Victory with an interesting character. I think a storm's a rollin in now.","mindlucent2007","Oct 19, 2011"

Tastes incredibel - rich, dark coffee and chocolate, with a touch of brandy. Tasty. The moutnfeel is perfect - good measure of carbonation to offset the thick, syrupy character of the stout. This is a first class russian imperial stout!","kingjames1","Oct 09, 2011"
3.93,-3.2,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"D/O- It's sufficient to say this has held up well at just about 2 years of age. Hops aren't are pronounced as fresh but if that's what you want then get yourself a black IPA.

3.28,-19.2,4.5,4,3,3.5,2.5,"Overall: The beer isn't as unappealing as I'm making out perhaps, but it definitely commits the cardinal sin of smelling *way* better than it tastes. It also takes a style often ridiculed for its boldness and rather than marrying those extreme flavors and making them sing, just blasts you with bitterness. While there's some decent flavor underneath, I can't handle the imbalance.","Pahn","Oct 07, 2011"
4.95,21.9,5,5,5,4.5,5,"What I like the most about this beer is definitely its hoppy character for a stout but not only that but how they meld the dry bitterness from the dark roasted coffee chocolate malts with the whole flower hops so well. The whole flower hops definitely give it that more hoppy flavor than you'd find in a stout but it really is quite a beer.","thebrood1987","Oct 05, 2011"
4.18,3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"T: The roasted malt and espresso make up the majority of the taste, but there are some nice hints of bittersweet chocolate, hop resin and blackberry as well. The alcohol isn't detectable at all. Pretty solid.","notchucknorris","Oct 05, 2011"

The taste of the beer is a rich with chocolaty malts and roasted grains. The mouthfeel is a little thinner than I was hoping for but still had enough body to keep in within reason.

Medium bodied, with enough carbonation to provide an effervescent mouth feel. It finished with roasted malts and a strong earthy hop bitterness.

4,-1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall: This is a smooth and tasty stout. The smell immediately after pouring from the bottle was kind of strong and boozy which had me a little worried. However, as the beer warmed up the smell and flavor mellowed out which was a good thing.","agomega","Sep 06, 2011"

Smells of dark fruits, roasted malts, and come caramel; most emphasis is on the fruit, which I find surprising (well, unexpected). Tastes of dry, roasted malt before a burst of dark fruits (raisin, date, plum, touch of dark cherry) takes over. Ends with some caramel and toffee. Mouth is very dry and sticky, and feels slightly under carbonated. Ultimately, it reminds me of a toned-down, much fruitier Old Rasputin; that said, I’d probably prefer an Old Raspy if given the choice.","eclipse54","Aug 28, 2011"

3.93,-3.2,5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"O: When it comes to this beer, I like where Victory’s head is at. Lots of hops, some dark, natural malts, and a handful of British character should be a winning combination for a Russian Imperial Stout. However, it feels a little rough around the edges. You can taste that it has character, but the hop profile just comes off too big. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, though – I mean, if you’re going to brew beer, you’d probably rather have the problem of too much taste instead of not enough. And between those two choices, Victory clearly has the upper hand.","BarryMFBurton","Aug 24, 2011"

Alcohol presence is minimal, especially for the style. I'm really enjoying the lingering flavors between drinks. Roast, chocolate, hops...well done.

Not quite what I remembered, or what I expected from an American brewed RIS. More sweet than bitter, for sure. This brew only gets better as it warms up, all the way to room temperature. The sweet flavor and silky smooth mouthfeel go a long way here. Very low astringency for the style. Could drink this one ALL DAY, even on a hot summer day, if only it wasn't 9.1% ABV.","soulfly1492","Aug 09, 2011"

It's a solid RIS, but to me it lacks the balance and complexity of some of the better RIS's. This beer was going in the right direction but I feel like those dark roasted malts could have been more robust and the bitterness was just too much for this brew and that threw it off balance. It went down fairly smooth but that excess bitterness would prevent me from grabbing another one, the over the top bitterness of this beer doesn't make for good drinkability. I don't think I would buy this again, even though it is pretty much available year round to me I would much rather have an Old Rasputin. If you like hop heavy RIS's this may be your thing, but it wasn't my cup of tea. This beer just wasn't on the same level as their other beers that I have tried, maybe since it is one of my favorite style I am being a little to critical but compared to all the other RIS's on the market this one fall shorts. From my experience Victory has a heavy hand with their hops and in this case it didn't make for a great beer.","StoutHunter","Jun 30, 2011"

4.37,7.6,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Pretty much black, totally opaque, a nice dense 1.5 finger creamy beige head that lasts for a few minutes and leaves some lacing in its wake. Aroma is surprisingly full of floral hops with some roasted malt and alcohol warmth, also picking up faint hints of root beer (?). My kind of RIS. On the sharp and bitter side, with dark roasted coffee and cocoa up front, hints of vanilla and tobacco in the middle and finishing with a crisp bitter kick from the slightly floral and spicy hops. Full-bodied with moderate yet slightly prickly carbonation which accents the hoppiness of the brew, but may detract from some of it malty complexity. This may be my favourite interpretation of the style thus far. Far from the richest RIS, it still delivers a fair degree of complexity and considerable flavour with an absurdly high drinkability.","MattyV","Jun 12, 2011"

4,-1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a dark black with nice tan head. Aromas of spicy, piney and citrus hops first appear. Then, some roasty & chocolate malt make themselves evident. Even some dark fruit, maybe dark figs, and molasses, oak, and brown sugar seem to make an appearance. As it warms, lots of high alcohol & tarry rum-like aromas. Lots of roastiness in the flavor with some burnt character. Dark cocoa & chocolate flavor also persist. There are some hops in the flavor but they're layered underneath all that dark malt character. Mouthfeel is good. Appears like a medium-full beer that doesn't really show its ABV. A little acidic, maybe acrid tasting. A decent brew overall. In typical Victory fashion, this one is an above par RIS with an extra dose of hops thrown in.","jwhancher","Jun 09, 2011"
4.32,6.4,4,4.5,4,5,4.5,"Appearance - Despite the slow, tipped glass pour, the head exploded into fluffy thunderclouds 4+ fingers and overflowed my Sam Adams pint glass (with 1oz still in bottle). Waited 5 minutes before head. All aspects of the Imperial Stout are classic and very similiar with other great IS's I've sampled (Old Raspy, and Yeti) and this one is really fabulous. The taste has a tad off balance with hop bite but smokey and chocolately flavors help balance it out quite well. For IS lovers this one is great as well.

4.1,1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Man, it's been a while since I last sampled the King's wares. I trust they're just as good as before. The pour results in a solid obsidian topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, molasses, maple syrup, cocoa, light smoke, and a touch of cedar. The taste brings in more of the same, but with a more pronounced hop character: pine and balsa provide a hoppy foil to the darkness surrounding them. The body is a stolid, heavy-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a relatively smooth feel. Overall, a very nice stout, one that deviates from the completely roasty and chocolatey path, but not entirely, opting instead for a best-of-both-worlds kinda thing.","TMoney2591","May 05, 2011"

Still, it has enough force behind it to punch a hole through the remaining shell of a New England winter. Good color; the dull-sheen blackness here is on a scale with a fistful of black Twizzlers. Its weighty, malty stoutness is nicely offset by a light-handed hoppy edge, bitter enough to dry things out but not enough to offend. For a 9%+ beer, it's very easy to drink which also means it hits pretty hard by the end of the glass, even when consumed slowly. No tall ladders or circular saws, please.","gfreed","Mar 08, 2011"
3.95,-2.7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, this beer has an amazing cascade on a center pour. Giving me a good vibe early on! The beer is an opaque brown-almost-black coloring with a chocolate milk colored head that appears to be light, airy, and bubbly. The head condenses down to around a 2 finger mark by the time I start drinking, and the retention is very decent. Also, this beer is leaving an impressive lacing on the glass as it goes down into my belly. The nose is a tad bit boozey, which is fine by me, as well as a little chocolatey and a lot of molasses. Further smells give off a mocha-type aroma. The beer is light and dry in mouth, carrying strong coffee flavors immediately onto the tastebuds. That bitterness of dark roast is counteracted by a slight choco-molasses sweetness that is extremely subtle. The alcohol is present in the taste as well, but again, very subtle. There are also some brown sugar/vanilla hints buried in there. The beer is quick on the tongue, and the finish is crisp and sharp with the bitter coffee aftertaste. This is a tasty stout, and I would imagine would be great in the northeast winters. Very tasty!","GarthDanielson","Mar 07, 2011"

4.17,2.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4," Pours deep brown with small off-white head that lingers, moderate lacing. Smell is real nice with a pronounced hop aroma, followed by a fruity, specifically blackberry precence. Taste is fresh-like, dark burnt malt, a bit of alcohol, with a bitter finish.

Absolutely beautiful. Smell is of dark fruits, sweetened coffee, and cocoa powder. Taste is of burnt espresso/coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and slightly sweet cherry/plum. A lingering bitterness on the back of the tongue after each sip that stays with you for a while. Carbonation is good and does not take away from the thick, creamy feel of this beer. Overall, this is an absolutely delicious RIS that I will be revisiting again. I am glad this comes in 12 oz. bottles as the 9.1% ABV can sneak up on you.","UCLABrewN84","Feb 24, 2011"

Pours an impenetrable black with two fingers of brown head with excellent retention and an attractive frumpiness. Aromas are roasty and sweet, like a bunch of dark fruits that have been charred in a fire. Maybe a whiff of coffee grounds and dark chocolate if I use my imagination, but not to the extent of other members of its style. The complex flavors and weighty body redeem the simplicity of the nose. Flavors of intermingling roastiness, burnt sugar, dark chocolate, and bitter smoke amount to a winning combination. All in all, Storm King lives up to its name by offering a tasty and (given the high abv) efficient way to withstand the winter chill.","droomyster","Feb 24, 2011"

4.4,8.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"D- For the fact that this is an Imperial Stout, it is remarkably drinkable.

2.98,-26.6,4,3.5,2.5,4,2.5,"Pours a pitch black color that lets no light through whatsoever. There is a small tannish/off-white head that disappears quickly. Scent is chocolatey and VERY hoppy. I have never had a stout smell this hoppy before. I also get aromas of citrus and roasted coffee. Taste is...WOW...This has to be the most citrusy/hoppy stout I've ever had in my life! I've heard of hoppy stouts before, but this one is overwhelmingly hoppy. I definitely get more orange, grapefruit, and bitterness than I get chocolate or coffee. I don't know if it is because this bottle is super fresh or what, but it's just not what I'm used to or what I enjoy in a typical RIS. Maybe hoppy/citrusy stouts take some getting used to. It's a real bummer, because I've heard such great things about this stout. Mouthfeel is full bodied and not overly thick or viscous. Drinkability would be a lot higher if it weren't for the off-putting citrus and hoppiness in what I was expecting to be rich with chocolate and coffee flavors.

Aromas of dark chocolate, raisins, roasted malts, and hint of mocha. Taste is mostly dark chocolate along with some mocha flavor. Fair amount of roasted malt flavor. ABV is hidden nicely. Only a very minimal alcohol burn. Overall its a really good Russian Imperial Stout. Good amount of flavor and nicely balanced.","PicoPapa","Jan 22, 2011"

The roasted malts and hops are just in full effect here, to the point that they get to be a bit much towards the bottom of the glass. Yeah, this ones a bit of a rager but still damn tasty if you like aggressive beers and that cask body does help smooth things out a bit.

The initial taste is pretty solid, like coffee with a chocolate creamer but I really don't like the after taste. It's like straight soap, almost bitter. Very sudsy and unappealing.

Taste is again roasty and has a heavy presence of black licorice, which I usually dislike but found rather pleasant here. A hint of hops as well. Overall while it is good it's not as complex as I expected, there's a bit of a harshness to it so I wonder what some aging would do. Full bodied and the carbonation is right one.

Some dark dried fruits in the aroma along with bitter chocolate, but these are overpowered by a strong grapefruit that fades to a bit of coffee. Really bitter up front with a strong hops presence. You get the coffee and bitter chocolate with just a hint of sweetness in the middle. The bitter grapefruit lingers on the back. Velvety smooth carbonation and a fairly viscous feel. All around silky feel to this one. If it wasn't listed on the bottle, you'd have no idea this thing was over 9%...it's absurdly drinkable. I like the hop appeal here and it's a good beer.

Big roasty malts right up front with dark fruits (dried plumbs come to mind) and a kind of grassy aroma probably from the hops and a bitter espresso undertone. Really nice flavors to follow the aroma. Big and roasty, kind of a semi sweet bakers chocolate flavor. Dried fruit, leather and espresso round out the flavors on this. All what I really want in an imperial stout. Solid mouthfeel, decent carbonation, smooth robust full body. Enjoyable all around.

Slight citrus sweetness up front. Then the bitters hit with the carbonation. The carb level is quite high. Immediately after, the coffee pinch kicks in and then a velvety malty, chocolate finish. Very complex brew. Very tasty. The timing of the carbonation and the coffee spice don't hit at the exact right moments.

This might pour one of the most gorgeous, busty heads I've laid eyes on - uber-full, chocolate(-colored) mousse-creamy, filthy-thick stains of lacing spattering the middle-man (pint glass) - stark-dark onyx. Ultra-smooth, lightly bitter cocoa/roasty, blue-green fresh-pungent hop aroma - pounds the sinuses with sultry loveliness. Other notes in the scent - black licorice and booze - carry over into and explode in the taste, which, with all said descriptors combined, plus a soft coffee undertone and a silken cream liqueur feel and Irish dry finish...(pause)...make quite possibly the most all-quality-encompassing strong stout in existence.

I was quite pleased to visit this old friend as the wind howled outside my window, a great stout for these chilly autumn nights. Storm King is pitch black in the glass with frothy light brown head that coats the glass with spotted lacing. Surprisingly, there is some sweetness on the nose but I mainly smelled lots of roasted coffee. As an imperial stout, the prominent hops also come as a bit of a shock. Really nice roasted malts flavors upfront that wash the tongue with a pleasing creaminess. I got lots of bitter flavors, both hops and then bitter chocolates. After a few sips the alcohol starts to warm the back of the tongue and throat. I also get some burnt coffee notes which sounds unpleasant but it works here. A really nice balance between hops and malts which is a unique take on the style. Deceivingly drinkable given the ABV, wish I had more hiding away somewhere.","biggerboat88","Oct 28, 2010"

The flavor is a fantastic balance of bitter grapefruit and citrus with roasted chocolate. In the finish there is almost an element of burn grains. Traditionally those burnt grains might sound off-putting, but they help build the character of this beast. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy with subtle carbonation.

4.68,15.3,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"Served cask'd, in a tulip glass, at the Great Lost Bear. It's an opaque dark brown liquid, with a big tan foam head. There is lots of rising carbonation in the glass, that slowed and finally disappeared. Some clinging carbonation remains on the sides of the glass. The aroma isn't as strong as I expected it to be. It can detect some roasted malts and some chocolate. Perhaps the cask format has limited it's aroma? Wow, what a stout! I can see why this used to the top ranked beer here. It starts out creamy and slightly sweet, with a kiss of chocolate. I swallow, and the bitter malt flavors come out. It's not a coffee bitterness, per se, but more of a roasted whole grain flavor. After swallowing, there is a coat that has a dark chocolate combination of sweet and bitter that lingers on for a long time. This is a very smooth medium bodied beer. Not too much carbonation; at least it isn't overbearing. There is a lot of coat left behind, which can sometimes be a problem if it is sticky or too sweet, but this really works well. Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. The high ABV is completely hidden, as is the sweetness put off but the amount of malt in this beer. This really is a great beer, and I'm very glad I could try it on cask. I've passed over the Storm King bottles for other stouts a number of times, but no longer.

The nose is a complex mix of malty base flavors in the form of burnt coffee, chocolate, anise and toffee as well as citrusy, resinous. The taste is equally complex and maybe more so. Lots of upfront malty sweetness of the flavors previously described, transitions to a slight acridness coming from the burnt chocolate/coffee taste and a strong alcohol finish. The hops are present in a citrusy way but seem to be more for balance than anything. The mouthfeel is full bodied and chewy, the carbonation is thick and pillowy. The finish is acrid and dry.

But the thing I like about this, is for being a big hophead and not a big stout drinker, it is like a perfect halfway point. This is like a super big hoppy Imperial Stout. Definately hoppy and I'm not talking bitter hops I mean floral aroma of hops coming through the dark malts. It does have a nice bitterness as well but the floral hops definately come through this beer. Like they used some strong high alpha acid finishing hops in this.

Of all the Stouts I have had this was my least favorite.

Makes me feel like I was too hard on the Ten Fidy. A while back I had the pils from victory which I really enjoyed, so this was a bit of a disappointment, for that and because the rating is high (A- very respectable to me). I'm just doing my part in smoothing the bell curve to bring it down to what I consider its rightful position in the B/B+ area.. yes 87% from me. Something about that A- caused me to expect more, a 92% perhaps, and therefore led to my disappointment.

Seems to have a big roasty coffee profile. Mouthfeel is good but I prefer a little more thickness. One of the most drinkable RIS's, maybe even sessionable.

4.33,6.7,5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"I know I like aged Storm King more than fresh stuff. Got this bottle in July so the bottle is somewhere between 5-7 months old I'm assuming. The last bottle I had at 6 months was great. Beer starts out great with a very nice pitch black pour and a nice tan head between two and three fingers. The retention is very good and the beer leaves behind a very thick coat of lacing as the head dies down. The head was creamy and a nice cloud is left on top of the opaque beer. This is the looks any stout should be aiming for. Smell has a ton of roasted malts right up front. Cocoa is also picked up from the malts along with some earthy hops. The nose has good strength and a decent balance. The taste is different from the nose. The hugely roasty malt backbone is still in tact and is almost smoky. There are some cocoa notes from the malt. The hops are much bigger in the taste than the nose. A good amount of flavor and bitterness comes from the hops. They are mostly earthy but a tiny bit of pine seems to be present. Even after around half a year the hops are still a bit harsh for me, the bitterness lingers and is strong after the beer is swallowed. The best thing that comes with age in this beer is the loss of the harsh alcohol. Any fresh Storm King I have had has been very aggressive in hops and alcohol. I would say this would be perfect after about a year. Right now it is an excellent roast malt flavor with a bit too much hops (they feel unbalanced). Mouthfeel is nice. The beer has a thick body, nice creaminess and goes down very smoothly. It leaves behind a roasty cocoa and hoppy aftertaste on the tongue. The carbonation is moderate and suits the thickness and flavors well. A bit less bitterness would be nice and is the only thing keeping this from a perfect MF. Drinkability is nice for an imperial stout. The 9%ABV is hidden dangerously well. The price is very, very good. The taste and quality is great and is worth the money. The only thing keeping this from being highly sessionable is the harsh hops. I would still consider this one of the only sessionable imperial stouts. Hooray for cheap imperial stouts and hooray for a beer that ages very well. Very nice roast malt backbone also.","cbutova","Jan 31, 2010"

Fairly full-bodied and ultra smooth, there is a TON of flavor that leaps out immediately with this brew. Plenty of espresso is backed by very dark chocolate with a very faint fruity complexity. Again, quite smooth and a bit slick, there's an astringency and lingering bitterness that balances all the big malts. This is definitely one of my favorite beers regardless of style.

First aromas were of roasted coffee and a hint of molasses. Unfortunately the taste didn't really live up to the nose. I was almost floored by the bitterness of the beer at first sip, the hops completely overwhelming everything else (A Vctory trademark I hear)! I like a nice bitter bite, but this was a punch and lingered for quite a while after. I did let this one rest and took my time with it, however (9.1% will do that, though why the ABV needs to be that high is beyond me). the hop bitterness DID mellow over the time, allowing more of the subtle coffee and some chocolaty notes come through with the hops in their desired place -- giving that ending small bite.","crhensel","Jan 09, 2010"

Floral hops really jump out from the aroma and there is little in the way of chocolate malts as you might expect in a stout. The body is full and decent. Hops are the leading element in the taste with a background of chocolate malts but you have to wait for those to kick in. It leaves sour aftertaste in my mouth.

Taste: hop forward... grassy, leafy, lemon rind... that seems to be the Victory hop profile no matter what the style is... milk and baker's chocolate, slightly astringent roasted character. Soft carbonation, astringent finish. This really comes off more like a black IPA than an RIS... maybe aging will change that.

Hints of caramel, toffee and subtle roasted coffee bean accompany the luscious lactic creamy darrk chocolate flavor and the subtle hops up front provide a nice balance without providing too much bitterness. A lot of Imperial Stouts I've had lately have been way too aggressively hopped taking away from the creamy sweet maltiness that I like so much but this one is balanced perfectly. The cask conditioning gives this body an incredible quaffale smoothness that takes the roughness off of the bottled version. Dangerously drinkable with an almost undetectable high ABV.

This leads into a dark fruitiness like a dark chocolate covered cherry. Finally, closes with a nice clean hop flavor with a bitter grapefruit and orange peel combo. A nice medium body about it and the complex flavor palate works to hit all of my taste buds simultaneously and lingers for a while on the finish.

The light brown head seems to last forever and looks like it could sustain the weight of the bottle cap placed upside down upon it. I'm unwilling to risk sinking the cap to the bottom so I don't attempt this. Smokey and sweet malty, almost like molasses, kind of aroma. Second sniff reminds me of a tub of prunes, also. Remarkably smooth at first sip. Great creamy texture. Almost lactic. light carbonation. Alcohol warmth hits you after several seconds. Light bitterness. Heavy lacing left on the glass as I sip it down. Well roasted malted barley with hints of smokeyness, coffee, and bourbon barrel. Maybe the heavy warmth of alcohol is tricking me into detecting bourbon barrel but I swear it's there. Wow... Lots of warmth. That's what I like about Imperial Stouts.

It's honestly a bit of a disappointment given the beer's big reputation, but that's common with the more popular beers and it's still quite good. Storm King pours black and opaque with a thick, creamy beige head. I don't really know what Imperial Stout would garner a perfect appearance score, much less a 1 or 2. Anyway, the aroma is quite hoppy with a mix of floral and grassy/citric notes. There's a touch of roasted, chocolate/coffee malt in there, but it's a bit weak. The flavor is more satisfying. It's clean and relatively dryly sweet, err... not sticky or cloying anyway. Again, the flavor is a bit dominated by hops, but there's a decent malt backbone lurking in there. I've heard that the malt comes forward with age, which would probably push this beer above a four for me. The feel is slightly thin. I think that I've cracked this beer too early. It's only about nine months to a year old and could probably use another year or three.","popery","Sep 19, 2009"

The balance between this makes this a warming spicy kind of IS. As the hop taste begins to settle, the sweetness becomes a bit stronger providing the already complex brew with another dynamic. The booze is noticeable in this but certainly not over powering and definitely adds to the overall complexity. Pretty good, not as deep and smooth and sweet as the Old Ras but different, which is nice to see, less fruity and a bit more heat, while still somehow being less complex.

Mouth-feel is excellent - full bodied, creamy, smooth and slightly oily. Finishes dry and bitter with a definite astringency - I'm not certain if it's from the hops or the bitter roasted malts - probably both. The high ABV is very well concealed.

The beer is full-bodied and smooth and silky, with just the right carbonation. You'd swear there were oats in this beer, to account for the creaminess. The drinkability is excellent, especially for a RIS, as they tend to get pretty robust and hard to handle much of.

4.26,4.9,3,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours out a very dark color, black, with a bit of ruby/brown highlights on the edges. A cm thick brown head sits on top, looks fairly dense, but falls away kind of quickly, leaving only a little bit of lacing. The smell is filled with roasted malts - chocolate, coffee, even a bit of smoky meat or burnt toast. There is also a note of dark, overripe fruit - plums, blueberries, and a very nice caramelly sweetness. A tiny bit of earthy hops still remain in this one. The smell is pretty strong and pleasant, exactly how I like it. The taste delivers as well. I can't tell whether I want to give it a 4.5 or a 4, but very solid. A huge roasted note hits first, with heavily roasted coffee, roasted and burnt so much that it starts to remind me of the black ends of BBQ or maybe even charcoal. Backed up with a mildly hoppy body, though it lacks heavy bitterness and without too much aroma or flavor. There's a nice finishing sweetness, that makes keeps it from being too dry and acrid. Very good in my opinion, not really estery or too dried out like many other impy stouts. The body is nice and full, with a hint of a burn - either alcohol or extra roastiness. Nice. And this one doesn't hit you over the head or pound you into submission. It's pretty easy drinking, and I would recommend it to all who might be interested into a widely available RIS.","taylorhamrick","May 28, 2009"

Smelled like espresso or high octane coffee. First thing you notice with the first sip is the alcohol. It really seems to attack you. The flavor is also quite powerful. Chocolate, coffee, and malt dominate. But the alcohol certain leaves its mark on the flavor and the throat. Slight bit more than I prefer in a stout.

I really like the malty, thick, coffee taste it has goin. Something to note - poured from a bottle into frosty mug - as i drink it, i can look at the side of my glass and count the "head lines" to see how many drinks it took for me to finish my beer.

It becomes sweeter, with dark caramelized sugars, vanilla, light coffee, and a bitter piney finish. The mouthfeel is definitely light for the style, and in the medium range overall. This is honestly not quite like any imperial stout that I have had before. It drinks small, but has a good balance of flavors. There are more flavor and aroma hops than maybe any stout that I've had, but they work well to balance the typical malt sweetness of the style and make this really drinkable.

There is such a hop presence in the tasting of this, if it was a blind tasting, I would've said black IPA. Brilliant balance of malt and hops, it adds a punch of bitterness on the palette.

I wasn't paying attention and poured a little too fast and had to let the head settle for a long time - good retention. You can clearly smell the hops and roasted malts. When I got around to drinking it the initial flavor was all hops followed by burnt coffee that lingered long after swallowing. Only a faint hint of the alcohol, but it's not surprising given how overwhelming the hops and burnt coffee is. I wish I could say I tasted something else in this brew, but I really didn't. There's little to no balance in it. It's sort of cross between a DIPA and stout/RIS, but I think fails at both, because the hops are really strong for a stout/RIS, and the malts aren't sweet enough to underpin hops like a good DIPA.

The smooth, creamy mouthfeel and pleasing flavors make this easy-to-drink stout a must-have every winter. Sipping on one of these is a perfect way to spend a snowy winter's evening.

So I bought a couple of these famous bad boys and dragged 'em home. Out of a bottle this RIS was a dark, dark brown color that approached but did not quite make it to opaque black. The one-finger head was mocha-colored, displayed decent retention and lacing that was quite good, starting in sheets at first that broke up as the sample continued. The aroma was of roasted malt, chocolate, brown sugar, a little dark fruit and coffee with cream. The flavors were not quite as sweet as the aroma, starting with roasted malt it then proceeded into chocolate malt, wood and a pleasant bitterness from the hops. The finish was lingering and coffee-like. It leaned more to the espresso-like side of the spectrum as far as RIS's go, compared to the more chocolaty side that Kate the Great or The Abyss leans towards. Still, the complexity of the malt was impressive and it was very well balanced by the acidity of the hops. It also hid its 9.1% marvelously well. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body full and the carbonation soft yet not understated thereby helping the body feel flush. Though not my favorite beer of this style I enjoyed it and found it dangerously sessionable.","thekevlarkid","Feb 19, 2009"

A mild maltiness hits the palate at the front of each taste, with touches of coffee, chocolate, and raisons. Then a strong bitterness hits the palate, bring the flavors of grapefruit and a dry earthiness. A medium heavy feel, not as rich and as a oily as one would expect.

Pure black in color, virtually no lightening anywhere. The nose displays a measure of restraint and slowly offers up the milk chocolate, creamed coffee, toffee scents which are not keen on stealing the spotlight, allows the grape, plum, cherry fruit to step forward, same for the soda bread, barley and quieter orange peel accents. Full-bodied, close to heavy through the attack but sheds excess weight admirably as it moves forward. The carbonation level is high yet does not prevent the dark bitter chocolate, Vienna roast coffee bean, toffee and heavy cream from accreting. Adds in a spring water freshness and higher orange peel presence. The hops do not coalesce into distinct flavors but do add a general dryness and structure. High degree of drinkability.","farrago","Jan 27, 2009"

Caramel, chocolate, burnt malt, hints of citrussy hops all comprise the flavor, with a dry burnt astringency dominating the finish and aftertaste. Rich full mouth-feel with moderate carbonation. While this one is more of a sipper (as it should be), it goes down quite easily and quickly. In my opinion, the burnt character could afford to be scaled back a bit.

Taste begins with strong roasted coffee beans and cocoa powder followed by molasses and caramel. Booze and sappy hops midway with a dry spicy wood finish on the tongue. Bitter feel with a medium to full body. I like my big stouts with a low carbonation, Storm King had a few too many bubbles for my liking.

Has a definite hop bitterness that enhances the flavor rather than detracting from the balance and drinkability. Chocolate is hinted at but doesn't come right out, it's a layer below the toffee flavor. This is a pretty easy drink for this kind of beer, all things considered. A pretty smooth yet full mouthfeel.

4.33,6.7,4.5,4,4.5,5,4,"A beautiful creamy tan head that fades very slowly to a ring, leaving sticky lacing that clings to the glass throughout. The nose is enormous on the hops, even up front. It masks the malt just a bit much but still adds another level to it. There is some chocolate and a dose of coffee along with the peppery citrus hop character. Taste is of bittersweet chocolate, cooca, a touch of toasted caramel and coffee. A light nutty flavor as well. All of this is complimented by a spicy hop character that adds a certain bitterness to the finish. Very nice. Extremely creamy mouthfeel that is silky as can be on the tongue and going down, despite the big hop presence which does give it a slight bittering dryness in the finish, also keeping the brew from being too full. I get hop burps like crazy from this brew. This is in the black IPA territory almost. Certainly not overwhelming in terms of hops but moreso than other RIS tend to have. It does detract a bit from how drinkable this one is. If there had been a bit more malt and a little less hop I'd boost it a notch. All in all, an interesting experience and I found some differences in this and the bottled version. The hops were definitely more raw and gritty here...I'm a hop head, though, so I won't complain.","ncvbc","Sep 29, 2008"

Missing the dark-fruit type flavors I find in other examples of the style. Clean fermentation, appropriate level of bitterness and coffee-chocolate character.

As I sip on this marvelous stout it's full bodied flavor starts to impress my senses. The malts are roasted beyond reason and this leads way to a wonderful flavor that is unlike any other Stout that I have sampled. Tremendously smooth on the palate, this strong dark beer is easily consumed. The alcohol is hidden extremely well. Good seasonal brew, great Imperial Stout. 5/13/06 well I had the last one from my cellar and I have to add that this is the most hopped Imperial Stout I have ever had, that's what makes this one special.

The smell was nothing too exciting. At 9% there was the tiniest hint of alcohol but to the extent that it added some flavor to the aroma. Other hints were chocolate, coffee, and a bit of malts. None of these were hugely evident though. The tasting was where this beer really started to shine. The feel was just thick enough that it allowed each flavor (chocolate, malts, alchohol, my friend said "toast") to slightly linger before being washed away. This beer got better as I kept drinking it. This might be related to the 9% alcohol content. Overall, this was a very drinkable beer.

I picked up some good malt smells in the roast and coffee department, but not much else in malt or anything like hops or sweetness. Rather bland smell. A very smooth beer is the first thing that strikes me, but it also contains a heavy coffee taste mixed with roasted malts, chocolate and some caramel and/or honey, as there is some smoothness and sweetness tucked in there. Also hints of cherry or some tart fruit and spices, although the malt is dominate. Thick and heavy-bodied but not too syrupy, this has a dry backbite due more to the malt characteristics and spices than the ABV, which I didn't even realize was anywhere near that until I did this review (i would've guessed 6% or something).

Taste follows with some dry chocolate blending with the dark sweet fruitiness, grapes and raisins, dry bitter roastiness is almost smoky and chocolatey, a grassy bite in the finish along with a warmth of alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium in body, tingling carbonation, and fairly dry mid taste to the finish. Decent bitter bite. Very good, I had never reviewed this particular beer as when I first tried it fresh (from this same six pack in 05/06) I wasn't crazy about it and just decided I'd tuck it back in the cabinet and see waht happened.

The taste is excellent for an imperial stout. It tastes of very deep roasted malts followed by some caramel, chocoloate, and then a hop bitterness at the end that rounds out the beer really well.

The taste brings intricate flavors of biscotti, toasted almond, bread crust, dried red fruit and bittersweet chocolate.

The feel in the mouth is full bodied and coats the palate. The taste of chocolate and espresso manage to make an appearance through the dominating hoppy bitterness. The beer signs off with more lasting bitterness. This is a complex beer. The strong bitterness is nicely complemented by the roasted malt flavors and the mouthfeel of the beer.

Smells of dark chocolate, roasted malt, dark fruits like raisins, coffee, and milk chocolate. Taste starts out with some licorice, followed by a creamy milk chocolate, raisins and other dark fruits, and a bitter coffee finish. Medium in body with good carbonation, smooth, but with a nice bite in the finish. Very drinkable for a RIS, presents with a fairly nice balance and would be a good brew to try to venture into the world of Imperial Stouts.","HopDerek","Jan 31, 2008"

Smells of a typical RIS, dark roasted malt, chocolate, molasses, bread, etc. Taste is superb with smoky hints of everything I smelled and more. Mouthfeel is also very similar to many other RIS I have tasted, full body and sense of alcohol but not too dominant. Drinkability is very high for an RIS in my opinion.

The smell of this beer was very strong, and consisted of roasted malts, with a hearty helping of coffee and just a touch of dark chocolate. The taste was as strong as the smell, Coffee hit first, then roasted malts, but it ended with a slight aftertaste of chocolate. The mouthfeel on this beer is thick, but not so thick that it makes it chewey. Just thick enough to really feel it. All in all this beer was very easy to drink, But as you reach the bottom of the glass, you really start to feel that 9% abv. I couldn't drink an entire 6 pack in one sitting, but one or two of these beers and I'm going to be happy. This is a great winter beer to keep me warm during the cold winter months.

Pours mahogany with a slight and quickly dissipating head after a light pour. Molasses, caramel, roasted malts and dark chocolate float up to the nose. Tastes of strong coffee, burnt wood, big malts and some bubblegum in the back, with the alcohol heat almost covered up by syrupy sweetness. The hop presence is nice and perfectly matched. Carbonation is decent. Mouth-feel is more on the crisp side as opposed to other brews of the genre. A bit drier than I'm used to, and not as full-bodied as expected, but that's not to say this isn't a drinkable and sharply presented RIS.","stephens101","Jan 25, 2008"

4.37,7.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"An old favorite. Pours an opaque dark brown color with big foamy dark tan head that fades to sheets of Belgian lacing. Some of which is 3D. Pools of tiny bubbles augment the creamy looking surface. The smell is aggressive. A surprising hoppy character blasts through the soft roast malt and chocolate aromas. The mouth feel has a whole bunch of complexity to it. Lightly carbonated, a tangy hop and alcohol note over the smooth and creamy textures. Full flavored, I experience a warming barrel-aged like cherry-vanilla character from the hop. The roasted malt aspect of the taste is right on target. A creamy mocha caramel flavor dominates and lingers appropriately. It is really a wonderful drinker, but you better not have to wander far after a couple of these bad boys because the 9.1%ABV is REAL.","jjayjaye","Jan 24, 2008"

4.47,10.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Inky black, no light comes through. Small amount of bubbly froth on top but not so as Id call it much of a head. Tan ring around the top. Coffee toasted malt aroma with some dark fruit along for the ride. First taste is of the roast coffee malt but the ripe dark fruit flavor comes in soon after. The finish is dryly bitter, plenty of hops for the style. Feels full and chewy in the mouth and is very nicely carbonated, a surprise considering there was no head. Has a dense rich complex flavor that keeps evolving. This is a beer to enjoy again and again.","CDBeerDisappear","Dec 30, 2007"

Still looks great with dense 1-2 finger cocoa colored head. Nose is more tame and less boozy but still plenty hoppy with a wallop of espresso and dark chocolate too. Flavor reflects the nose with a pleasant berry fruitiness that is matched nicely with strong but not acrid roasted maltiness cut with solid leafy hoppiness and a big dose of espresso and bitter dark chocolate. The hoppiness is decreased from the fresh I've tried, but still pretty large for the style. Smooth feel with a light tickle of alcohol and char. A great beer -- I'm going to get more to put away and try some younger and older than this one. But it's pretty hard to beat, especially for the equivalent bomber price of $3.85. Stellar brew.","argock","Dec 27, 2007"

There seems to be just the right amount of carbonation and the 9.1% abv is barely perceptible. Aftertaste continues to please with the roasted feeling staying with.

Aromas are full of toffee, chocolate, roasted grain, and some slight caramel; with little to no hop presence. Body does not come across as heavy as most with this beer, moderate to high carbonation for style. Very bright and intense flavors, quite fruity, reminds me of a good high cocoa chocolate bar. Almost gives off a flavor of lactose but I doubt any is used, just has a very smooth sweetness in the finish. Roasty or hop bitterness is nowhere in this beer putting it a little out of "balance" for an American version. Still, a top notch RIS, one to certainly compete with Brooklyn's and Bell's, my two favorites.","dreadnatty08","Nov 04, 2007"

4.43,9.1,4.5,4,5,4,4,"Pours black like Newgate's knocker, amber tints barely perceptible against its shroud of opaque midnight, topped with a dark taupe head one finger tall. It subsides, leaving spots of lacing down the walls of the glass. Roasted malt in the nose, with an undercurrent of dark fruits, and a healthy floral hop note offsetting it just enough to remind you that you are not in Siberia. When cold, the astringency is more prominent, with a healthy carbonation anchored by the roasted chocolate and coffee base, a touch of figs, and an earthy bitterness that lightens the mouthfeel. Clean, and thin, but when warm, gets more complex, with notes of vanilla and stronger fruit, the hops fully emerging yet subordinate to the malt. Finishes very crisp for a stout, with coffee lingering like a halcyon memory. I paired this particular session with a Morbier AOC, its objectionably good aroma and rich flavor with wood ash a good match for the flavor profile.","ism","Oct 29, 2007"

Pours a dense, light free black/dark brown color with a medium sized head....big head on a hard pour. The head retention is pretty good...goes down very slowly. Thick lacing on the glass. Very prominent and distinct nose. Smells like a Belgian...dark fruits (plum and dark cherries) and raisins. First taste is like a Belgian, astringent, dark fruits...but mouthfeel is thin and watery. Second sip corrects all this. Taste starts out the same, but the coating on the tongue and tastebuds show this to be a rich and flavorful beer. As you drink, the malt characteristics come out and the beer seems less astringent and more crisp and malty. Drinkability is good for this high level abv.

The toffee, and chocolate are present but they seem to be overpowered by the dried fruit taste that leaves almost a chewy presence in this thick brew.

There just doesn't seem to be much of that robust character that I love so much about my favorite Imperial Stouts. Rising above any chocolate or coffee flavors, is just an off-putting aspirin like bitterness. It just dominates.

Nose attacks with the cocoa, some burnt sugar, a bit of port wine, and some very strong berry. So far so good. Big hit of chocolate (bittersweet) that fades into a a quick hoppy burst. Hang on, that hoppy bitterness sort transfers, as if by magic, into a roasted malt bitterness. Crazy. Mouthfeel is wonderfully full and creamy, though I might like a tad more velvet-like quality.

The taste is a bit mellower than I remember, but pretty much echoes the smell. It's fairly sweet too, and invites another sip. Not overly complex, but it works.

The head left an excellent amount of sticky lace all over the glass. The strong scent of coffee comes screaming at you with a nice blend of dark bread and roasted caramel in the middle. I could also make out vanilla, molasses and alcohol. The initial taste was malty sweet with a long dark chocolate and espresso coffee bitter aftertaste.

With the taste, again, big hops up front but it works better than with the smell because the chocolate flavors mix well with it. Finish is all hop oiliness and astringent burnt malts.

Alcohol is well hidden to me. A nice froth on the palate livens up the hops and releases some tannin flavors. Quite quaffable for an RIS.

Taste was very similar with the chocolate flavors going off the charts. Despite the sweetness of the chocolate though, it did have a certain bitterness in the back of it. Mouthfeel was on the heavy side, but for some reason, I can drink this beer like it is nothing. I usually can down a sixer of this and feel fine. Oh well, either way an awesome beer to have around. It seems like on of those offerings that they would normally have in a bomber as a special release. Nevertheless, I think I like the fact that it is in six packs much better.

But almost unnoticeable. Mouthfeel is very full and expansive.

There is sticky tan lacing all over the glass. Scents of black patent malt, subtle toasted character supported with easygoing hop aroma. No real fruit qualities to this, maybe some bread from the yeast, but a nice mix of aroma all the same, especially as it warms up. The flavor has just the right amount of chocolate malt balanced with hop bitterness. The toasted character and black malts are definitely the showcase, supported then by tasty hops. This is so far one of my favorite R.I.S, however I am new-ish to the variety, but I stand by my evaluation. Its a strong tasty brew with medium body (nothing thats going to weigh you down, but its surely got body and strength).

Also some cherry, tiny bit of bitter chocolate, and happy funness. Seriously, it smells like a fun time. Has a mellow flavor that develops and builds to a crscendo, then slowly melts away on the palate. Had great bitterness and sweetness, balance like crazy yo. On a side note, how does Jake Bussey keep getting acting jobs? Sorry, back to business.

4.51,11.1,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Poured into a Troeg's pint glass. The cellar it was stored in was 49 degrees at the time of the pour. Drips a thick, and deep opaque hue, reminiscent of used motor oil. Leaves a 1/8 inch of dirty foam with light lacing that hugs the sides throughout the session. Immediate smells of molasses are apparent with a light alcohol-splashed, roasted-coffee scent. I detect very subtle hints of a slightly tart and sweet, yet earthy fruit - perhaps a mild berry of some sort. First swig brings an immediate rush of a stinging, bittering hop flavor, followed by noticeable waves of roasted malt. Not as much chocolate presence as the tint and scent would suggest. Not as thick as Stone's offering - lighter than expected from the consistency. The carbonation is very noticeable, with lots of fizzy pop dancing on my tongue. I get a mild range of alcohol burn, more present in the back of the throat. The finish is bitter, like a shot of espresso. Delicious and suprisingly drinkable, the complexities in the taste definitely hides the high alcohol content. Not so sweet that you get sickened by the end of the serving. I could most definitely enjoy more than one of these in a single sitting. Overall, I find it very warm and inviting - seems like it wold be the perfect beer for me to relax with after a cold day snowboarding. Definitely Victory's best offering.","kmudrick","Oct 15, 2006"

Pours a very dark brown color (not translucent) with a minimal head. Smell is intentionally sweet, but then the alcohol overpowers and takes control. The taste is huge, and surprisingly cohesive for such a big beer. The first taste is of toasted malts and grains which also have a bit of nut to them. There is also a touch of sweetness to it, like brown sugar or cinnamon. About 3/4 of the way through the alcohol takes hold and mixes with the other tastes of the beer nicely. The finish is again sweet, mostly consisting of the brown sugar-alcohol mixture. It goes down surprisingly easy for such a big beer.","Toddv29424","Aug 06, 2006"

3.68,-9.4,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Aha I finally found a bottle of Victory's Storm King Imperial Stout. As I pop the cap I pour with great anticipation, I have heard so much good things about this beer I was very excited. As this Beer pours out into the glass it pours a pitch black body that seemed like a black hole in a glass. On top layed a lovely Brown head that stood long and proud. I plunged my nose into the glass and inhale deeply. At first I pick up the basic bittersweet and espresso aromas that are signature in this style then I pick up something different. It was an aroma of apples, it reminded me a great deal of British styles, such as Saumuel Smith's Taddy Porter. The taste was such a treat. It had everything the smell was but at first a slight smack of hops that woke up the tounge. It was thick but not syrupy more like a froathy explosion in my mouth. After I finished that first beer I wanted another. It did not disappoint me and I will definitely be getting this one again.","cproioi","Jul 24, 2006"

Taste is super roast chocolate and coffee, very rich, some caramel/toffee through the middle, more chocolate in the finish and some pine and floral hops, little bit of alcohol in the finish.

It smells like roasted malt, some hops and a slight alcohol smell. The smell isn't very strong at all. It tastes like roasted malt, chocolate and coffee, with a slightly sour, hoppy bitter aftertaste. The aftertaste sticks around a while! As it warms, the taste gets better. It's very smooth and creamy, and even with the bitter aftertaste it's still pretty drinkable. Just the right amount of carbonation too. Even with the high ABV content, you can't tell it too much when you're drinking it but it does hit you after a while. Overall this is a pretty good stout, I'd definitely recommend it to others.","bluejacket74","Jul 15, 2006"

Taste begins sweet with chocolate and brandy perhaps, then comes the espresso and a bittering from just enough hops and almost too agressively roasty malt. Also, there is some dark fruit, like a brown sugared apple or something. Basically, the mouth is the greatest feeling under heaven, smooth, creamy and the slightest carbonation and pleasantly warm down the throat. This is one of those rare, wonderful beers that you take a sip, swallow, then continue to 'drink' it as you swallow the residue in your happily salivating mouth.

The aroma is subtle coffee and chocolate. The subtleness disappears with your first sip. Roasted! The flavors are solid roasted coffee and chocolate there is a hint of sweet malt. These flavors fade to the Hops that clean things up a bit and stop your tounge from being roasted as well. There is a slight burnt bitterness that lingers in the aftertaste and although it has a fairly high ABV it does not interfere with the taste of this Beer. The medium to thick body contributes to the success and the drinkability is high for an Imperial Stout. Storm King has just become one of my favorites.","nyjets1248","Jul 03, 2006"

The taste was much of the same, I was however impressed with the use of hops in the brew, they brought some zest to an average, creamy stout flavor. Mouthfeel was average for an imperial stout, which I feel is naturally a little tough to palate with the lack of carbonation, and a lot of booze.

If I had to smell this blind folded I would have guessed it was some sort of coffee/chocolate (mocha) style ice cream soda. The beer poured thick and black with a very dark head. The first sip of this brew floored me. It did not taste like I had anticipated. My long description would be a Hopped Chocolate malted coffee espresso deluxe with the essence of roasted almonds served in a chestnut wooden mug!! WOW!! The finish is smooth with a hint of bitterness that disappears very quickly from the tip of your tongue to the back of the throat. Carbonation is perfectly balanced because of the initial hoppyness experienced upon contact. I think this beer would even be enjoyed by those who typically don't drink this style. If you ever see this, try it. I could drink this every day if it wasn't so potent at 9.2% abvr. I Love this one and will try out the remaining four bottles during this years Holiday season.

Also, I dislike the alcohol burn and roast byproduct acridness- but I also realize that this is probably one that improves with time, and all the components will work in harmony after aging as opposed to some of the still raw characteristics doing their own thing as a young brew (just like wine oftentimes- ready to drink when you buy it, but it's much better if you let it sit for while before enjoying.) - really good stuff nonetheless.","ultralarry2006","Mar 31, 2006"

Transforms into a very biting citrus hop bitterness. The bitterness clings to the back of the tongue as all the flavors mellow. However, the aftertaste is gone fast and leaves a charcoal bitterness leaving you wanting more. Full-bodied with light-medium carbonation. Very excellent beer!

Moderate nose of dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, charred wood and hops. Palate was creamy and smooth, without being slick or oily. Attractive taste of espresso coffee and lots of charcoal notes with a minerally dryness mid-palate. The hops certainly make a strong play here keeping any cloying sweeetness at bay and providing a notable crisp and pleasant hop bitterness to the long finish.

At first, it appears nutty/chocolatey. Then a wave of IPA flavors hit. But its not overwhelming, it is complimentary in the rudimentary essence of the word. The citrus and grapefruit flavors do such justice. The finish is almost like an IPA as well, with a bitterly dry puckering aspect. The grapefruit sits at the back of the palate for good.

Floral, piney hops sting the nostrils right away. There is a roasty chocolate and coffee scent down there somewhere, too, but I think it's drowning in hop oil. Brazen hoppiness dominates the flavor throughout and throttles a newborn roasted espresso malt bill, leaving it twitching in death throes on the sticky floor. Assertive alcohol notes. Spicy with so much hoppiness. Prickly carbonation and hop spiciness cover over what I'm certain with time will become a beautifully slick and oily mouthfeel.

The smell of this beer is fantastic, there is a sweetness to it with some hop floural overtones that just makes your mouth water. As this beer sits on your palate the hoppy bitterness takes over then your hit with a honey sweetness followed by a toasted espresso blast that just leaves the palate exhausted yet wanting more. This is fantastic the 9% abv is nil and you can really sit down and enjoy this beer but watch out cause it does sneek up on you.","Franchise","Dec 26, 2005"

Nose is a combination of roasted malt, chocolate, caramel and big floral and piney hops, very appetizing. Taste is more of the same hoppy roasted goodness, espresso, dark chocolate, roasted malt, chocolate covered cherries, lots of great stout flavors, all infused with wonderful resinous bitter hops. I've just gotten into hoppier dark roasted beers, and this is the best balanced of the lot I've tried (Alpha Klaus, Black Sun, Yeti), really showcasing the hop flavors, but still allowing the dark roasted stout tastes to showcase. Excellent beer, can't believe I haven't tried this local stuff before, need to stock up immediately.","cubedbee","Dec 25, 2005"

The flavor was bold and roasty, but relatively dry for this style - malty, yes, but not on the sweet side compared to many Russian imperial stouts like North Coast's Rasputin and Avery's The Czar. Maybe that's why it's been categorized in the "American Double Stout" category. It really doesn't have that British yeastiness that many Russian imperial stouts have. Although the hops are somewhat there in the aroma, they really dominate in the finish. This is an intense beer, but if you like "mad flava," it's one for you. Think of it as analagous to an American Double IPA.","SacoDeToro","Dec 12, 2005"

Palate is rich, complex, and well-balanced between the boatloads of spicy aromatic hops and the rich, assertive chocolate malt. A slightly sweet biscuit character emerges right up front, but fades quickly. Notes of coffee and dried plums linger on the finish. Body is rich and creamy, yet leaves a relatively dry finish.

The mouthfeel is full-bodied and luscious. Introductory flavors of sinful dark chocolate and burnt malt. Expresso coffee and cocoa follow. Assertive (but balanced) hop bitterness towards the back sets this apart from most other Imperial stouts. The 9.1% alcohol is barely detectable which makes this an even more dubious offering.

The taste begins with some big roasted malt notes (expresso and dark chocolate), big hop character (floral, grassy, citrus), some blackstrap molasses, dark fruits, mild alcohol and chicory.

I have to admit, this lives up to its rating. This is one of the finest examples of an Imperial I have ever had. it was smooth, warming and had a complexity of flavor I rarely find.

So, I let it sit while'st I played a few rounds of Call of Duty 2. After about 45 mins I tried again and wow what a difference letting your stout warm up makes. Now I could easily taste the malts, smell the bit of floral hops and could detect espresso, dark chocolate and carmel.

Oh you're still finishing that. Ok never mind." Anyway, I'm glad they didn't throw the hamburger in, though if you've ever had the hamburger at Victory it is DAMN good. To this day I have not had a better burger. But anyway, I think the alcohol might be getting to me a bit in this one as I'm almost finished. 9.1%? I can't taste it at all.

A penetrating chocolate malt, with hints of caramel coats the back of the nostrils. While some floral hops dance among those little hairs inside your nose. The flavor is excellent. An abrupt punch of roasted yet tarty malts, phased out by the hops. The hops are perfectly executed; they have just the right bitterness to phase out the initial malts. The hops pick up right at the same level that the malts drop off, and allow the flavor to gently subside. The palate slowly dries out as the flavor seems to burrow down into your tongue. Just as I thought it was over, a sweet but dry molasses and walnut aftertaste crept back up on me, just amazing. Damn this beer packs a punch, I am really feeling it by the end of the glass. As I search for further means of description I end up with the "sophisticated beast."

Smells of licorice, tobacco, chocolate, and smoke. Taste is more of the same, but with a more noticeable dark chocolate presence. Age has not withered this strong stout.

This is the first beer I've cellared for an extended period after taking notes on the fresh version, so it'll be interesting to see what the age has done to it. It still has a surprising amount of carbonation and even keeps a head on it for the first half. The hops have smoothed out in both the aroma and taste and the dark malts are taking center stage. Much fruitier now... near the end it almost smelled like I had Chambord in the snifter. Lots of juicy blackberries and currants with a big backbone of roasted malts and coffee/espresso with the same citric/pine hop flavors, but with less bitterness. Definitely more drinkable, and I might say it deserves a 5 for aroma, even though I didn't indicate as such in the score. Even better than when fresh. I paired this one with a slice of rich chocolate cake and it complemented it perfectly. I have one more bottle left, let's see if I can make it last another year.","mmmbeer","Apr 06, 2005"

Taste, wow, so much going on. Roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, long finish. The chocolate got quite strong as it warmed, but it was never overpowering. Mouthfeel was velvetty smooth and the high ABV was so well hidden, it warmed your throat, but you couldn't taste a scrap of it.

This beer is a little over carbonated, I believe. But not so much that it detracts much form the greatness of the beer. It is robust. It is a full bodied beer that goes down surprisingly smoothly. The alcohol is well hidden, so this beer might sneak up on you. Because of that, it might not bee the best beer to drink all night. Unless you can dring high alcohol beers. Then drink away.

Otherwise, the color of the beer was near total darkness, with light struggling to make its way through. Aromas are dominated by the choclate, with sweet caramel and roasted-toasted malt supporting. Flavor is again wonderful, but not quite as enjoyable as from the bottle, which, to me, is surprising. Perhaps I like the overwhelming mixture of flavors unattenuated by the conditioning. There's a whole lot of chocolate, coffee, and caramel here, don't get me wrong, and it tasted great...just not as good as I remember. Much smoother in this version.

However, it does dissipate rather quickly. Smell is of dark rich baker's chocolate and some raisins (raisons), a bit of caramel malts w/ tones of slight hops throughout. As it warmed to room temp, the chocolate came through more, and I even thought of fresh brewed coffee from this one. Taking a sip, it solidified my ideas about the coffee; sweet coffee and caramels coming through with the dark roast malts. Again, as it warmed to room temp, the chocolate came through more and more along with teh raisins (chocolate covered raisins!) Great mouthfeel...smooth, smooth, smooth!!! Carbonation up front is enjoyable and lighter than expected, the alcohol burn on the swallow is a great addition to this one in that it was NOT overpowering at all as I had expected before. Very chewy, creamy, rich Imperial Stout! Wow! Victory, can you do it any better?","Fish113d","Jan 23, 2005"

I dont often detect coffee/espresso aromas in anything except a coffee stout, but I do find it here, with just a hint of hops on the back. Wow! Surprising hop flavor up front. This really is a hoppy stout. Nice fruity accent to the beer. More roast malt with the coffee flavor I detected on the nose along with some chocolate. Good rich velvet mouth feel. No alcohol heat.

Served from the engine directly in front of me, the glass is an opaque obsidian the likes of which is to be feared. A foamy tan head tops it off, and leaves incredible lacing behind as I work my way through this masterpiece. This is an exceptional beer out of the bottle, and it is something to be honored and cherished on cask. Nothing touches it, stout or otherwise. Without hesitation, I would order a Storm King on cask before I'd order anything else (that I've already had).","altctrlsdelete","Jan 08, 2005"
4.83,19,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"As soon as I pop the top my nose is greeted by deep, ripe berry esters. The beer looks viscous as I pour it into my goblet, seeming almost reluctant to leave its bottle. A large foamy head the color of creamed-coffee rises rapidly and seems to retain rather well for a beer of this girth leaving a lace-like sheet on its way down. The bodyblacker than the night time sky in bed-sty in july; blacker than the seed in the blackberry pie, blacker than the middle of my eye. This beer eclipses even direct lights feeble attempts to penetrate its depths. Upon further inspection the nose reveals a flambé dish made of plums, ripe cherries and fire-consumed rum; deeply charred malt, dark roast coffee and juicy ripe blackberries. The taste is a perfect reflection of the beautiful nose. Storm King introduces itself to my palate by squeezing a handful of ripe juicy blackberries across my tongue and then soaks it up with a blasting combination of hop bitterness and deep charred roastiness. The bitter and charred flavors are awesome and roll over some other complexities of flavor (ripe apples, plum skin, toffee) and coagulate into a resinous, coating pine-sap in the finish. Very small hints of rum like alcohol flavors in the finish, but I consider it very well masked for the large ABV contained in this beer. Warmth instantly rides down my throat and pools slowly in my belly from the first drink. The mouthfeel is robust; creamy and almost a little oily at timestill falls short of the thickest Imperial Stout Ive had to date but its no sucker in this category either. An amazing beer that is a great example of one of my favorite styles. You can really take your time with this one, making it a perfect beer for a night where youre only having one. Im so glad I have more of these!","FormatKid","Jan 07, 2005"
4.08,0.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Huge aroma of hops and dark malts. Black in color. Lots of hops for this style of beer, but I like that. The espresso flavor of roasted malt still comes through the spicy, citrusy hops. The malt and hops blend quite well, better than you'd think. A very bitter finish seems to be made up of both hops and malt flavors. This is a very intense, hoppy stout. The hops can actually deceive and get you thinking that you're not drinking a heavy beer. Very well-attenuated, which combined with the high hopping rate, actually makes this beer a little bit two-dimensional -- but still a very tasty stout.","marcobrau","Jan 05, 2005"
4.66,14.8,5,4,5,5,4.5,"This beer pours a jet black color with a 2 finger tan head that falls to a quarter inch cover over the beer. The nose is deep chocolate and dark figgy fruit with a really apparetn alcohol. The flavor is very chocolatey and roasty, finishing strong on coffee tones. There is also a creamieness in the flavor as well that make it so smooth. The feel is as smooth as a can be, almost velvety. There is a little bit of syrupy feel that keeps the beer on my tongue. Fantastic beer. For a beer above 9%, this one doesn't let me know anything about it except in the nose. Victory, you do very good work.","kmpitz2","Jan 02, 2005"
4.16,2.5,5,4,4,5,4,"Draught. I picked up this keg at Vecenies Distributing Company in Millvale. It has a roasted aroma with some very faint undertones that I cannot describe. This stout is very dark and opaque with a very tight frothy head, which is brownish in color (tan to light brown). The head is somewhat lasting, but it dissipates faster than expected. The taste is complex yet balanced; it starts out slightly bitter, but the mild sweetness catches up, leaving you with a long bittersweet finish. I mostly notice a roasted flavor, but it does not seem like chocolate or coffee; maybe its molasses. If you sip the frothy head when you first pour it, it tastes pretty much the same as the beer itself, which is not true of other stouts that I have imbibed. It has an oily full-bodied feel on the palate with lively carbonation. Storm King warms your stomach and is not a stout that can be consumed quickly as you will eventually feel the effect of its high alcohol content; Victory Brewings website lists the beer at 9.1% ABV. If thats correct, Victory goes down on my list as another quality brewer that knows how to mask the smell and taste of alcohol.","wbickerton","Jan 01, 2005"

The taste is thick smooth and buttery fresh, the dark chocolate malts are on the forefront with a nice espresso finish, floral hops are incredibly efeective.

The underlying bittersweet chocolate maltiness blends nicely in a wonderful medly. This tastes almost like a big old black IIPA. Lots of flavor and bittering hops dominate and linger. Underneath is a smooth chocolate pudding like malt. I almost picture Hop Wallop underneath everything going on here. This may not be a good multi-brew night beer, but a good satisfying one tonite brew, for you can sit and enjoy the hops for quite a while after drinking, for they sure do linger!","vladtheimpaler","Nov 23, 2004"

Its too heavy for a session but a flavor I could see getting it on a regular basis (if it was local: this is another trade that Ive lost my contact person for). This is a good example of the American Double Stout, dark and hoppy. Does it belong in the Top 10 (as it currently is)? A great beer, but I think Ive tasted 10 better beers in the world.

I actually smell hops first, wonder if anyone else did... and then the roasted malts come into play. Taste is very solid. Nice fruity and malty kick up front with a bit of alcohol warmth and also a nice back-up of piney hops. This is definately the most well balanced stout I've had. Not over-powering at all, as many people sometimes say of stouts. Mouthfeel is definately a bit lighter than I expected. Definately a more medium body than full. Definatelty very drinkable for a stout, not too thick or chunky, and certainly not bland or boring.

Dark roasted malts hit first, but the middle is roasty with some nice chocolate and coffee flavor notes as well. The finish is dry and oily with some leafy green hop flavors in the mix as well. The mouthfeel is a bit too carbonated for an imperial stout when this brew is served on tap, and as such the cask version of this brew is definately more 'easy-drinking'.

In the middle it lingers into rummy raisiny alcohol notes with some balancing hoppyness. The finish is less bitter than I expected, with sweet malts producing a balance.

The finish is bittersweet maltiness which lingers at the back of the palate. Very full body, thick and viscous, medium carbonation. Smooth texture with some alcohol flavour and warming present.

Taste is sweet chocolate, raisens, and coffee, countered by pine and citrus from the hops. Hoppier and less sweet than some Imperial Stouts. Medium bodied with a soft palate.

This one smells of roasted coffee, dark chocolate with a hint of citrus hops thrown in. The taste starts with the chocolate and coffee flavors before the balancing bitter hops come in to even things out. No sign of the 10% in the nose or the taste of this beer. This has a good mouthfeel being creamy and smooth with decent carbonation. The drinkability on this one is amazing, I could drink this all day if it was 10%.

The head diminishes to nothing more than a ring around the glass (which leaves behind some lacing on the glass) and a discontinuos skim of bubbles over the top of the beer. A strong smell of coffee and chocolate issues forth from the glass even when held at some distance. An inviting hint of hops also comes forth in the aroma. Tastes quite strongly and very nicely of coffee and espresso like flavors. Chocolate flavors and the bitterness of hops also come through nicely, particularly in the finish. Smooth and full-bodied, this very tasting beer is highly drinkable despite the rather high alcohol content.

It mellows, more black currant, prunes, and raisins are found in both the nose and the flavor. It does seem smoother and silkier as it ages, but personally, I much prefer this beer young.

Pours black as midnight, and seemingly thicker than normal beer into a nonick pint with virtually no head. Still, the color is dead on for an imperial stout, and the blackness just makes me want to drink it now. Aroma is of roasted barley with hints of belgian sweetness. I'd say plums, but it's only what I imagine plums to smell like. The smell is thick, is the best way to describe it. Taste is overwhelmingly roasted mixed in with some slight fruity sweetness that finishes into this slight sourness that that is holy on the palate. Though I may not agree with the fruityness in the beer, it is amazing. The coffeelike textures of the flavor, and the portlike sweetness. It's to die for. Carbonation is a moot point. I mean, it's there, but the full richness in the mouth. It's too delicious to be quaffed all night, but if I find this on tap. I'm going to be a rider on the storm. An excellent offering from Victory, and an addition to my trinity of Imperial Stouts (this, Samuel Smith and Rogue) so far.

Strong coffee-like flavor with what I thought was a hint of vanilla. Good amount of hop bitterness at the end. Tastes even better as it warms. This is a beer you want to sip for a while. I have found that the higher alcohol content is somewhat hidden. Good mudium-full body. This, despite being high in alcohol is a fairly drinkable beer, as imperial stouts go. I have had this beer in a bottle, and on draft, and so far I actually prefer the bottle version. I look forward to Storm King every year, and this year is no exception.

Strong coffee and burnt malt tastes, which quickly are well balanced by a hop bite like most stouts are missing.

Taste is strongly hoppy (cascade is the only hop i can pick out,) especially on the forefront, and settles into a nice, creamy roasted chocolate presence. A very bold beer, even for the style.

4.6,13.3,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Storm King was served from a 12 oz bottle, with a bottle date of May, 2003. It was poured into an imperial pint glass, with a small rough brown head rising and quickly falling to become a ring and scattered continents of foam, set upon a bottomless black ocean...no Valdez in sight, just waves of fine blanketing lacing. This world of a beer was richly aromatic, with massive notes of dark sharp cocoa, oak, molasses, and cola. The nose had an incredible depth and power, but was not offensive in the least. The taste was equally powerfully, and balanced with a masterful touch. The smooth semi-sweet malt body was rich with flavors of dark choolate, espresso beans, and perhaps licorice. This is followed by an excellent lively pop of zippy bitter chocolate and cola flavor that melts off the back and sides of the palate. The perky yet balanced quality of this sensation is what sets this stout apart from the rest. The finish is perfectly bitter and semi-dry, with the delightful flavors lingering on and on after each sip. It was extremely rich, yet superbly balanced and quite drinkable, a combination that many of the big stouts fail to pull off. Nowhere did I detect any alcohol. Bravo, Victory!

A very smooth-thick body packed with taste. The chocolate/coffee flavor is quite distinguishable. This is a very rich beer that only gets better as it warms.

This beer is great, with a big espresso-like character and beautiful mouthfeel. The large hop flavor meshes pretty darn well with the deep, dark malts. The only real fault I find with this beer is a certain lack of depth in the flavor. What is in the flavor from the start lasts a long time, but it doesn't really evolve much, which is something I look for in a complex brew. I would like to taste this same beer with a different yeast that might lend it a more complex and evolving character.

The aroma was slight and had to discern any real flavors. The taste was extremely smooth and balanced. Unlike most imperials no strong flavors really came out, this one was definitely lighter in body and mouthfeel. The dominant malt flavor was espresso but it wasn't sweet at all. This beer was also hoppier than what I'd imagined it would be. The finish provides and acidic bitterness that lingered for a long time.

The head is tan and lasts for the entire pint. The beer is great by smell and appearance alone. The taste is phenomenal. The Victory crew does a great job of masking the alcohol. There are a lot of roasty, chocolatey flavors that are prevelant at the front of this beer. The hops are definitely American and make this stout a nice treat. The malt is great in that it doesn't ever give up. The body holds for the entire beer. Drinkability is great being that the flavors are so good and the alcohol is masked.

4.37,7.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours an engine oil black out of the bottle. No light penetrates this liquid, save for the slightest red tint around the edges. There is a marginal tan head that recedes into a ring of foam with patches of bubbles lingering for a while. The smell of this brew is incredible. It hits you with a thick meaty smell, with a sharp twinge of hops behind, smoothed out by a backdrop of malt. Some raisiny fruit smells are hidden behind. The taste is nearly as impressive as the smell. It is a surprisingly sharp taste of hops and definaly a typical coffee flavor evident of its style. Earthy tones of burnt and soil hint themselves through the taste as it mellows out into a slow meaty malt taste. At 9.5% ABV, this brew will certainly at least make you think that you;re warmer on a cold winter evening.","FranklinPCombs","Dec 14, 2003"
4,-1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Taste was very milk chocolately with a very bitter end. Really unique profile for me. Very roasted flavors yet really almost sweet on the front end. Hop fairly really is aggressive but then dominated on the back by heavy roasted coffee flavors. This is the first beer in a long time that I got three disticnt flavor profiles from. A good beer to me produces at least 2 distinct points of taste, great beers produce 3 or more. This beer is great, but unless you are prepared and appreciate maybe more than one, I think you might not get the full flavor profile and all the uniqueness of this beer.","CRJMellor","Dec 13, 2003"
4.68,15.3,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"Absolute blackness, there is no hue to it, opaque and dense. The brunette head reached a quick finger in height before shrinking to a loose soapy collar, which clung well. As I quaffed it slowly it laced decently. Magnificent looking, if for no other reason that the black body it possesses. A shallow whiff produced a pleasant roasted maltiness, I knew there had to be more, I went in for seconds, this time I noticed strong piney hops behind the malts. Imperial Stout no doubt, Americanized as well. The potency was strong enough to be tempting, so why wait to sip? The palate on Storm King surprised me, I wasnt expected such a well-blended beverage. The roasted malts were far deeper and long lasted that I anticipated and when the hops were introduced to the tongue there wasnt this epic battle for bragging right, but a sensuous dance that awoken my tastebuds. The roasted malts, with its own coffee-like bitterness, led the tango but the piney, bitter hops had its own moves. It was scrumptious and magical with an aftertaste of complex maltiness with a splash of hoppy bitterness that seamlessly allowed for a smidge of alcohol to round off the ale. Ive witnessed Storm King reign on BA for over a year and now that Ive finally tried it, thanks to sulldaddy, I understand why. The taste is aggressive and welcoming, powerful and yielding, stylish and blunt. I am impressed. Full bodied, thick in fact, with moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel is dead-on and truly lovely. Im not gushing folks, this beer is awesome and I hate every one of you who can drink this on a regular basis. No seriously, I do.

4.38,7.9,5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Sweetwater Happy Ending was released in 12 oz. bottles a little while back, and since Victory Storm King Stout of the same age just showed up in Georgia, I decided to do a side by side. I was expecting the Storm King Stout to easily surpass the Happy Ending, but I found the end products much closer than I initially anticipated. The Storm King was clearly the better looking beer of the two, as the head on it was larger, and the color was solid back when compared to the shades of brown in Happy Ending. The smell of the beers was different, but none was better than the other. The Happy Ending was sweet with a lot of chocolate notes, while the Storm King Stout was roasted and hoppy. The taste of the Happy Ending was sweet, soft, and full of chocolate, while the Storm King Stout was much more bittersweet, and had a citric tang of hops to it. Happy Ending didn't have the thickness in the mouth to justify a RIS style label, while Storm King Stout was just thick and creamy enough to squeak by. Both were easy enough top drink, but Storm King Stout was clearly the more complex beer of the two. I think a comparison of a few aged bottles is needed to see how things change over time.","rajendra82","Dec 11, 2003"

Forms a dense, clumpy head with muddy-colored bubbles of varying size that almost seem to roil around, crackling audibly! Head dissipates slowly and clings well as it dries out into crusts of bubbles. Huge aroma: burnt malt and toffee up front, then BIG roasty bread crusts, smoldering wood. Waxing poetic: piles of autumn leaves and timber, huge dryness and dusty yeast, then a big, thumping belt of hops. Flavors everywhere: raisin skins, extremely bitter chocolate in front palate, and then... BIG bitter wall of hop flavor bowls through a wall of malt and mingles with tobacco, leather, peat. Even through a smooth, glowing alcohol finish, something of a plummy, curranty sweetness... Mouthfeel: did I mention that this beer is BIG? Slick, oily and with a stickiness that lasts for minutes. Alcohol warms and puckers inside of mouth with an astringent finish. This beer needs to be savored and digested. Let it slowly coat your insides.

Hops are prevalent and delicious, but there's a definite malty couterpart with peaks of chocolate, molasses, coffee and a perfectly balanced roastiness.

The smell did not offer a big, robust burnt (roasted barley) smell, yet was a complex amalgam of sweet (malt & fruity like alcohol-marinated raisins), chocolate, hoppy alcohol. Taste also showed not immense roastiness, but rather more of a toasted malt background against the "imperial" sweetness, but with notable hop-bitterness too. A very warming glass full.","Hobbz","Dec 06, 2003"

The nose is nice, with a major hop influence, as well as the usual suspects for the style ie. bitter chocolate,coffee etc. The flavor is amazing, and certainly attributed greatly to the skillfull use of hops. The taste is like a tootsie roll sauteed in pine needle oil, (if there is such a thing) or perhaps a chocolate flavored bud from Humbolt county.(not that that means any thing to any body) The mouthfeel is lush, creamy, and the finish is long and wonderfully bitter in a hoppy sort of way.

Subtle carbonation, but than again, those tiny bubbles have a lot of work to do to rise through thick thick brew. Grainy, roasty, and scorched organic goodness all come through in the nose. Surprisingly, I picked up on a fair amount of hops, too; something strange, though, maybe Challenger. Black strap molasses meets baker's chocolate with an extreme dosage of dark malts, mixed with a sweetness that plays on the tongue for minutes afterwards. Throw some quality espresso in there, too. I've had a fair share of Imperial Stouts in my day, and there are many variations on the style, but this one's been one of my favorites by a long shot and will be for years to come.","crookedhalo","Nov 20, 2003"

Nice hit of hops up front with a very roasted malty backbone. Bitter chocolate and espresso fill in nicely. Alcohol warms the body nicely, though it's hidden well in the flavor profile.

4.57,12.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"The aroma of this one hit me right away. The bitter roasted smell was pleasure to my nostrils. The appearance is an opague black and the head has a dark-ish brownish sort of tinge to it. The taste is just amazing. Imperial Stout all the way. There is a hefty amount of sweetness to this beer, so it is by no means a dry stout. In fact I picked up an interesting hint of mint in the taste. Just a hint, by no means an overpowering flavor. My assumption is that this minty taste is derived from the use of black roasted barley of some variety -- the flavor being a wonderful hint of bitterness from a very dark or black malt. My biggest complaint about this beer is that it is hard to find where I live.","andyj","Nov 14, 2003"
4.75,17,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"2002 bottling on this sucker. This has been in the cellar since last winter, and tonight it joined it's former six-packmates by being consumed by me. Pours a thick black with a medium-sized brown head. Good lacing on the glass too. Smells of whiskey-soaked fruitcake, raisins, soy sauce, roasted mocha coffee, and alcohol. The taste is WOW. Rich, oaky, malty sweetness with plums, overripe bananas, chocolated, all tempered by a rush of bitter dark chocolate hops. Finish is roasty, bitter, with lingering sweetness and warming alcohol. Fantastic. Mouthfeel is big and syrupy. Victory can do no wrong","alexgash","Nov 12, 2003"
4.7,15.8,4,4,5,5,5,"It takes a fairly aggressive pour to create medium sized frothy tan head, but once its there, its not going anywhere soon. The lace is sticky, and holds on to the sides of the glass all the way until the end. The color is pitch black and cannot be seen through at all. However, lots of tiny white floaties can be seen through out the brew, slowly making their way to the bottom of the glass. The aroma is not very strong, but roasted malts with hints of coffee and a slight fruitiness is apparent. The mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth, creamy, and full. Theres a moderate carbonation that gives a slight fluffy mouthfeel. The flavor profile is bliss - sweet rich molasses, chocolate notes, and maybe a touch of currant fruitiness. The finish is lots of hops and coffee flavored bitterness. The bitterness along with lots of roasted notes linger unabated until the next sip. I doubt anything can be said about this brew that hasnt already been said. Wonderfully balanced  the bitterness is never overdone, and the sweetness is never cloying. Its simply an amazingly wonderful imperial stout that cannot be any more drinkable. One six pack was most certainly not enough!","byrd","Nov 12, 2003"
4.58,12.8,5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Poured the jet black color that you expect it to with a two finger dirty capachino head. As I drank it, it left the sweetest long laceing down the sides of the glass. The aroma was the usuall coffee & chocolate, but there was a roasted earthy hint with a touch of alcohol. The mouthfill was nice and smooth, but not as thick or viscous as Stone Imperial. The taste was roasted and almost burnt or bitter chocolate. Great hop presence that I thought may have matured a little better. I love the warmth from the alcohol presence, but it's not too much or over powering. Very drinkable, with a nice clean dry finish. Great stout....one of the best.","irishmoss","Nov 11, 2003"

On the nose was all of your usual suspects - coffee, molasses, figs and raisins and a some nice herbal hop aroma. Lots of nice fruit as well. Taste was very rich, creamy and mouth-filling. Quite heavy dark malt, pumpernickel bread, tons of ale fruit esters, moderate roasted flavor and a huge kick of burnt brown sugar. Keeping all of this monster malt sweetness under control was a healthy dose of hop bitterness that really cut the malt sweetness perfectly, creating a very balanced imperial stout. At almost 10% alcohol, this boy was still very drinkable and smooth. Victory shows time and again why they are considered a top 5 craft brewery. Awesome stuff.","bmills1608","Nov 11, 2003"

Poured a dark black with a tan head. It tasted of raisins an plums actually. It did have a VERY profound hops taste. I am a hophead so I didn't mind, but others might.

4.65,14.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"This beer is a deep black color, when held up to the light it is seen to be quite clear. When roused a thick dark brown head appears. Notes of burnt raisin waft from the glass. Roasted malt is quite evident in the nose as well. The taste is very good, it is all over the place, not one dimensional at all. Not over the top in its roast character (like some Imp-Stouts), this is wonderful as it allows lots of the other flavors to come through. There are notes of a rich port, and a slight bit of sherry in the finish. The Storm King is fairly light bodied for this style of beer. It is fruity tasting, which is accentuated by the hop flavor that has been put into this beer. Quite novel to me to pack an Imperial-Stout with flavor hop additions, I really like this idea, especially in this relatively 'light' bodied example. One could easily drink a couple of pints of this, and regret it later. The more I drink the more I like this beer, I wish that I had more. I can't wait to get a fresh sample of this beer.","Gueuzedude","Oct 27, 2003"

The body was uncarbonated, opaque and it had a dark hue to it. The nose was malty, chocolate, and some coffee notes. The flavor was bitter, hoppy, coffee notes, acidic and it left a lingering aftertaste. The mouthfee was tingly, smooth, thin textured and medium bodied.

5,23.2,5,5,5,5,5,"Upon the first drink of this delectable brew, there was only one phrase that came to my mindYabba-Dabba-Doo, Yoo-Hoo, Scooby Doo! This is one absolutely amazing beer. It pours a thick, black color topped off by a fluffy tan, almost brown head. For an Imperial Stout, the head retention was very impressive. It faded down slowly and remained fully intact until the last drink. The aromas of sweet malts and dark roasted coffee beans forces its way straight up your nose directly into your brainI have honestly never smelled something all the way up in my brain! It was amazing! The alcohol was totally masked by that sweet, sweet aroma. Then came the tastingahh, theres that masked alcohol forcing itself on the taste buds. The sweet, maltiness of the aroma represents itself very well in the taste. I also detected a hint of nuttiness in the finish. This brew is exceptionally balance, very smooth and easy to drink. I think I could drink this all day and night, or at least until the 9.1% ABV knocks me on my ass. This is the only beer that I have every given a total rating of 5 on and it is very well deserved.

Smells strongly of heavily roasted barley malts, black malts, burntness with sweet BBQ sauce or soy sauce, very dark and earthy and has some coffee, molasses, and licorice notes. The taste is quite good, lots of dark malts, black, chocolate, coffee, molasses with a bittering finish of strong fresh green hops.

I described the taste to another patron as imagining the deepest chocolate stout you've ever had and then adding a punchy hop finish to that. He tried one immediately, and I must say that, though my friend had been at Monk's for a few hours by that time, he was immediately impressed. I like this one better on tap than from the bottle though its a beer to get whenever you see it. The pinnacle of the Victory collection and a tribute to American Brewing.","EmoBeerGuy","Mar 25, 2003"

Pours pitch black in color with what appears to be only an average sized tan colored head at first that continues to grow long after youve finished pouring and develops into a mountainous thick and creamy head. Several minutes after the head was fully formed, it still showed almost no signs of receding, and it coats the walls of the glass with heavy sheets of lace as you drink. The presence of hops is very apparent in the aroma along with notes of fresh espresso and chocolate liqueur. Very full-bodied with a thick and creamy mouthfeel. Flavors of roasted malts and bitter-sweet chocolate are present up front followed by notes of buttery toffee, dark coffee, and a bit of liquorish. Some tastes of dark fruits also come along towards the end along with some bitter hop leaf flavors. The bitter hop oils and tannins remain in a lasting aftertaste. Very delicious.

The aroma is filled of hops and a dark roasted fullness of slightly burnt grain. Coffee like in flavor and aroma this beer blends perfectly in the mouth with the high ABV sending ripples through the espresso dark roasted barley with chocolate tones. This beer is amazing, from the appearance right down to drinkability!!!! The mouthfeel is full to medium in body with a creamy overall sensation to it. I could literally drink this stuff all the time, it's addicting!!!

The rather dark chocolate head settles very slowly, and there always remains a nice subtle rim that contrasts nicely to the deep, dark brew, which is about how I'd describe the smell--deep, with not too much overwhelming alcohol in spite of the 9.1% ABV. There is very little carbonation; the feel is soft in the mouth initially, and the immediate taste is understated, but as this stout settled in my mouth, many wonderful and complex tastes emerged. First, I noticed the woodpile taste (I like). Then a subtle mossy after flavor. Through it all, never did I get the sense I was drinking a highly-charged brew. The best thing about this is how much the feel and taste improve with each sip--maybe that's the alcohol content kicking in. A very good stout.","longpondbeerman","Mar 10, 2003"

While I haven't been a fan of imperials, this stout left me impressed. The beer is as black as they come, with an attractive thick brown head. Aroma was scarce at first but picked up as the beer warmed, mostly roasty dark malts featuring chocolate, licorice, smoke, and coffee aromas - half way I think I even dicovered a strong vanilla presence. The extra alcohol is always welcome, and is blended very well. I could drink this all night, or all day for that matter.","nixhecks","Feb 26, 2003"

All sorts of flavors, lots of hops, dark malt, bitter chocolate, Turkish coffee, cherry notes, citrus and alcohol tangs, all fighting the battle for supremacy on my happy tongue. Just like dinner with the Italian side of the family... Thicker mouthfeel than some other stouts I've tried, very luxurious, like rich Corinthian Leather. The finish goes on and on, like bitter chocolate and expresso, and some tanginess in there, too. Wow, this is definitely one of the most complex beers I've ever had!

The flavor starts with a fruitiness that flows quickly to a roasty malt flavor. From there this full-bodied beer goes to a dry, hoppy, bitter finish. The bitter finish in this brew is intensified by the burnt malt flavors. It also has an alcoholic flavor in the finish. I really wasn’t expecting the fruitiness in this beer.

4.68,15.3,5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"First of all, a big thanks to fellow BA francisweizen for this sample, my first Victory beer, which I've been looking forward to for ages. This is a beautiful beer, I have to give it a perfect 5 in the looks department. The mocha brown head stays exceptionally and impressively well, which seems to be a tough thing for many imperial stouts to pull off. The aromas I'm getting are delicate, sweet chocolate, smooth and quite creamy mocha, toffee chips, and a hint of hop leaves, maybe some floral hop character. Very subtle and delicate aroma, but certainly complex and pleasing. On to the actual tasting. This is by far the smoothest imperial stout I've ever tasted. A subtle yet ever-present leafy hop character is the only thing that really stays the same character-wise all the way through this beer. In the front, there's dark chocolate and coffee, in the middle, sweeter chocolate and more intense hop character, very leafy with a good amount of bitterness. excellent contrasting of flavors. In the back, hop bitterness subsides a bit in favor of more chocolate sweetness. It has a mocha feel to it overall, but this characteristic is not always so noticeable. This beer is just mellow and smooth all the way through. It's rather relaxing. No tremendous assault to the taste buds, but complexity is still in profusion. Magnificently crafted. I really wish Victory would start distributing here in Arizona, but for now I'll treasure and savor every last drop of what I can get of this masterpiece. To those of you who can grab this at your local store, count yourselves lucky and appreciate what you have!","hyuga","Feb 19, 2003"
3.8,-6.4,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Occasionally, I know we all try a beer that is very highly rated, with much hype - and come away disappointed. This is certainly the case here. Upon first taste, I immediately found this beer to be thin and overly hopped. It's definitely a quality brew, and the overall effect is nice. Unfortunately, the hops are too dominant, and the body is too thin for the style, The second time I had this, I drank it "head to head" with a Sammy Smith Imperial. No contest, IMHO. The Sammy was smooth, thick, and creamy - further emphasizing the overall lightness of this beer. On a positive note, the alcohol is very well hidden, and it goes down pretty easy. Pours dark, but not as dark as the Samuel Smith. More of a deep burgundy. Decent head, but thinner and somewhat carbonated. Some lacing, but nothing significant. Ultimately, bitter and dry. I know there are thousands of hopheads that will groan in disgust with this review, but try the same head to head test - see what you think.","JohnnyDuvel","Feb 18, 2003"

The only thing light about it was the tan head that was about a finger width, but that quickly receded into sticky lace on the outside of the glass with some bubbles in the middle. The smell was very earthy with some roasted scents. The taste was thick bordering on chewy and very hoppy at the outset balanced with some rich coffee and bitter chocolate undertones. At the end it was a little more subtle with some exquisitely mellow malt with just a hint of the alcohol. The last taste was pure chocolate.

What could he do? He watched the sun race behind the horizon and felt the cold air moving through the valleys. It sent chills through his blood, He could only imagine how the villagers handled this cold season every year. Then an idea struck him. A drink to keep the chill off, some elixer to warm the blood. Brew a special beer for the people, maybe this could bring happiness back to his kingdom. It would be black as night, topped with a dark brown head. It would warm the drinker with its complex aroma of raisins,coffee,dark chocolate and fruit. The smooth, full bodied texture would go down very creamy and mellow, with its alcoholic tones hidden deep beneath layers of coffee and bitter chocolate, but a nice herbal hop flavor and bitterness would add even more complexity. It would finish both slightly sweet and bitter to raise the spirits. This would be the drink to break the spell of the Stormking, the dark cloud that has covered his valley for too long.

The taste is like a very light chocolatey coffee mixed with a peppery stouty taste. The finish is so smooth, it's like butter. It just slides down your throat and coats it.

Elements of anise and raisins with an oily, silky, full-bodied mouthfeel. On the palate the complexity of this beer is immediately recognizable and impressive indeed. (More than any other, this beer represents, for the American brewing tradition, the very opposite of beers like Bud and Miller, etc.) The combination of high abv and heavy hop presence leave a bitter bite on the back of the throat. This gets back to my distinction regarding being charmed and being impressed. The intensity of this beer is just a little much for my tastes but, nevertheless, I understand its respect on this site and think it is well-deserved.

The aroma is pleasant, no bitter undertones, chocolatey and inviting. Mouth feel is spot on with a pleasant creaminess. Coffee, chocolate, hops, maltiness, they're all there in the taste. Afterwards, the taste lingers for a long time on the palate. I didn't think the alchohol was that pronounced. It will most definitely sneak up on you however, this is a potent, tasty brew.","LarryV","Dec 08, 2002"

Being a Stout lover I was really looking forward to this one and I was not let down. I was reminded of a cold cup of coffee as I poured, it was that color. Aroma of coffee, dried fruit and chocolate. Wood-burned flavor of malt, alcohol and espresso kept my interest throughout. I'd like to try a bottle that has aged a bit next time, because I have the feeling it would be even better. Thanks to Victory for living up to their name again!","Dogbrick","Dec 04, 2002"

5,23.2,5,5,5,5,5,"First I would like to say that I bought this keg on the recommendation of the BA. When poured into the glass it is BLACK, no light gets through. The head is thick, rich and a creamy mocha tan. It lasted. The lace was beautiful, the same color as the head, and it draped the inside to the last sip. The aroma was amazing and complex and intense. I nosed coffee, chocolate, berries (as it warmed), floral, malt and hops. The taste was amazing, full and smooth. I tasted chocolate, coffee, milk, fruit (berries), roasted malt and hops. Temperature plays a role in this beer. The warmer it got the more intense and distinct the flavors became. It starts off alittle sweet then all the flavors jump at you and then it has a dry long lasting finish. GREAT BEER","Jarod","Nov 27, 2002"
4.85,19.5,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"This is one truley amazing and unforgetable beer. I did not expect it to be this good. It poured jet black with a creamy tan head- laces all the way down the glass. Wonderful presence of aromas- chocolate, coffee and even sweet plumbs. The taste was great- strong bitterness chocolate and dark roasted malty tones. Vigorous and strong, the flavor never faded. Silky and smooth, yet powerful, this brew is among the best beer I have ever tasted.","AaronRed","Nov 26, 2002"
4.79,18,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"What can I say that hasn't been said already? A great imperial stout all around. Is it the absolute best? I'm not sure. I will come back to this one time and time again because memorable it IS. The characteriastic that sets this stout apart from others such as Sam Smith, Brooklyn Chocolate, and every other that I've ever had is the hopping of the beer. Many imperials rely on toasted malts and blackened grains for a majority of thier flavors. Doing this they achieve great things in terms of depth of flavor and complexity. Victory is the only brewer that really gives hops a chance to shine through in an important way. Most will provide hop flavor and bitterness for balancing these normally weighty brews, but Victory somwhow manages to make their hops the centerpeice of their brew. Very, very well done.","yen157","Nov 25, 2002"

4.16,2.5,5,4,4,4,4.5,"It seems that the trip in the mail may have done a little harm to the beers in the package this beer came in because it and 2 others seemed a little light on the head. Still, this slight defect did little to detract from the quality of the beer. Huge roasty, burnt malt hits the nose strongly hinting of coffee with lighter hints of caramel. The flavor pops your taste buds with more coffee, and caramel. Very rich and a bit sweet. The palate is a bit grainy, but still creamy without being to heavy. My first experience with the imperial stout has been a good one.","aracauna","Nov 19, 2002"

4.78,17.7,5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"I tried this great beer at the Victory Brewery facility, which is another rating in itself. (great place). This stuff came to me in a pint glass with a small head, which was leather brown in color. I held it up to the light and saw it was black as coal. Great smell-like malty, with a chocolate, coffee aroma. Needless to say, the alcohol was quite evident. That being said, it was time to taste. Great malt, chocolate, and alcohol hit right away-with the hops kicking in after a couple minutes. This stuff felt great, almost like a meal in itself. Fabulous stuff. I had the waiter set a case out for me when I left. Can't get enough Victory brews.","thefireman","Nov 17, 2002"
4.7,15.8,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Bottled on Sept-26-02. Pours blacker than a cloudy, moonless night for a sailor lost at sea in the middle of the Pacific. When held to the light only thin glints of deep brown are seen along the rims of the glass. The opaque body is topped by a solid and creamy head that is at first quite brown, but shortly thins and becomes more of a deep tan. Really interesting! The head holds quite well but eventually drops to a good collar and a thin surface covering (probably due in part to the high alcohol content). It does, however, leave an intersting "spider web" lace throughout the glass. The body is medium/full with a median level of carbonation that softens as it warms and leaves a very silky mouthfeel. The aroma is bold and fresh; full of rich, very deep bittersweet chocolate and roasted malts as well as some apple-like fruitiness and sharp grassy & floral hops. Quite hoppy when young! The freshness and high level of hop character are quite unique in the world of Imperial stouts (I'm guessing Goldings). The flavor starts with some light fruit and a rich chocolatey note, reveals some lightly acidic character (probably from the low pH of the deeply roasted malts) and then some more sweetly malty notes as it warms in the mouth, finally finishing dry with a firm bitterness and lingering espresso-like roastiness. Exceptionally well balanced between malty sweetness, acidity, deeply roasted character and bitterness... with some hop flavor thrown in to spice things up a bit! It's not too acidic or thin bodied (as many Imperial stouts can be) and the alcohol is very well cloaked. An exceptional beer that's well worth seeking out. Additionally, although the fresh character is really interesting and engaging, it ages very well and becomes quite another beer. I like to enjoy it both ways. If cellared, it will round within 6 months but really smooths at about a year. Beyond that it will probably not improve greatly, but should hold without defect for at least another 6 months, and probably well over another year! Buy a case and put away half to cellar!","NeroFiddled","Nov 16, 2002"
4.85,19.5,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Storm King Stout:  Bottled on October 15, 2002.  Dense head, ocher colored, long lasting.  The head leaves a thick lace on the side of the glass.  The aroma is very nice, dark chocolate and fruits.  This Imperial is as dark as night, no light penetrates this beer, even when held up to a strong light.  Wow, this is fantastic beer, with a wonderful roasted malt taste, that is nicely balanced with hops.  Double mocha espresso, with a long lasting aftertaste.  Substantial alcohol warmth.

4.58,12.8,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Mouthfeel is absolutely as smooth as silk, sliding across the tongue and down...ohhhh. A delicious bitter hoppy aftertaste follows the taste of chocolate, coffee, and burnt toast. Alcohol flavor is present, but certainly not overpowering, and does not seem at all to be 9.1%. There is a nice warming feeling in the stomach though, which I am thoroughly enjoying. By far one of the greats...","IrishRedRock","Nov 09, 2002"
4.82,18.7,4,4.5,5,5,5,"Bottled 9-26-02.  An essentially black beer with dark ruby edges that pours with a light coffee colored head.  The head is modest and fades quickly, leaving a slight lace.   The nose is very sweet and fruity.   The mouthfeel is heavenly.  Very silky, it just coats your tongue and feels like it slides down so easily.   The taste is very complex, with roastiness up front, followed by a little sweetness and bitter mocha-coffee notes.  The aftertaste brings dark chocolate covered cherries to mind.   The balance of roasted bitterness and malty/fruity sweetness is amazing.   Although this is a big beer, the alcohol is primarily noticable as it warms the esophagus.  I could enjoy these all night long, simply because of the seemingly endless flavors this beer throws at me.  I honestly did not expect this much pleasure from such a young beer.  Where has this beer been all my life?  Thanks to Nero for hooking me up with this beer.","aaronh","Nov 08, 2002"

4.83,19,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"at 9.1% you don't taste all that much alcohol. just a roasted coffee flavor that just tickles all your taste buds. smooth all the way down with a little bitter finish. This is an in your face stout to start with. Dark and roasty malts and coffe are all over you as you are engulfed in this brew. Then... you get hit with a mass of hops that gives the hoppiest stouts a run for their money.

5,23.2,5,5,5,5,5,"Most stouts are good, really good. But some are great. Storm King is one of the greats. There are several mysteries lurking in the darkness of this brew.

Too much alcohol on the  palatte and the malts hadn't smoothed out enough.  Time has been kind and this is now an exceptional beer.  The blending of malt and hops are incredible, if anything the hop is more pronounced.  Unfortunately this is quickly becoming a session beer.  Victory consistantly puts out a quality product and their attention to detail is great.","rosebud","Aug 06, 2002"
4.25,4.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,3,4,"Jet black & opaque topped by a rocky, dense & well - retained beige head that leaves attractive lace.  Sweet dark caramel, buttery malt, bittersweet chocolate, black licorice, & smooth roasted grain aroma, with a lightly floral hop nose.  This brew exhibits excellent balance all around.  Residual sweetness is superbly offset by both roasted grain & clean hop bitterness.  This balance allows the deep, bittersweet chocolate flavors to coat the palette, while subtle dark fruity notes inculding raisin and caramelized dates pleasantly eek their way into the flavor profile.  The body is unfortunately a bit thin and doesn't deliver on the malt profile and could use more dextrins and / or proteins.  The finish is surprisingly light, and is comprised of more roasted unmalted barley & mild hop bitterness that lingers enjoyably on the back of the tongue. Storm King is a delicious imperial.  With more body this would be phenomenal.","marc77","Aug 02, 2002"

You can't taste the alcohol but you feel the numbing in your mouth and in your gut. Quite thick and cloying, tarry with a vague milky sourness. Reminds me of Cuban coffee.
