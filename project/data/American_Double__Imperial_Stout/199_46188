4,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4,"enormous beer, great this time of year. dense malt layers in this one, like an under cooked fudge brownie. it ranges from day old drip coffee to sweet milk chocolate and oatmeal in the aroma, and hides its booze well. real dark look, but not shiny, its muted in luster, looking less exciting than it is, but the head is rocky peaky and tall, tan in color, and lasting for days. first sip shows a ton of viscosity, with flavors of bakers chocolate and licorice and burning bread. its great, its complex, its got depth like the sea itself, and it has an almost smoked note for a second in the finish. cocoa powder and a note of dried cherry there for a second, even coconut too. full bodied is an understatement, and this is a filling slow slipper, but the alcohol isnt all that aggressive and the beer on the whole is both very unique and very delicious. bold and intense, one heck of a stout.","StonedTrippin","Feb 10, 2015"

The texture is excellent, very smooth but not like drinking motor oil as can tend to be the case with some stouts.  Once you swallow you get hit with some dark malt and are left with hops on the finish.  I was surprised that even after 4+ years the hop taste is still strong (not a bad thing!).  Balance is usually a word I reserve to describe my favorite IPA's, but this is truly one of the most balanced imperial stouts I have ever had the pleasure of drinking.

Some toasty malts and alcohol. Please don't disappoint me beloved Ballast Point. First taste is alcohol in your face. Actually tastes like much more than the 10% that it is. There's dark chocolate and toasted malts that are definitely there, but the alcohol is way more there. Good hop bitterness, but the alcohol, did I say the alcohol. Damn. Letting this warm....

The taste of dates, dried fruit, roasted malt, bitter dark chocolate, and port are what hit my tongue with a aftertaste of some alcohol. Overall this beer isn't bad but compared to other Imperial Stouts this isn't my favorite. Actually reminds me of a Belgium Strong Ale rather than a Imperial due to the heavy fruit and port taste.

Flavors very close to supreme, but a tad sweet for me. Really good balance, if it weren't for the slightly oversweet. Tang does help to make up for the sweet, but the sweet clashes slightly with the bitter giving odd sharpness in the mouth. Body/carbonation is good but for that odd bitter/sweet thing. Finish is like flavor and the odd bitter/sweet thing ends up dominant. I would have another tho at the end the alcohol does rattle my noggin.","drpimento","Oct 08, 2013"

Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, raisin, toast, dark bread, light char, brown sugar, floral, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roasted malt notes with light fruitiness; and good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, toast, dark bread, coffee, light char, light raisin, floral, and roasted earthiness. Slight coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, toast, coffee, light char, dark bread, floral, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors with some light hop balance; with great robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial stout. All around great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt flavors with slight hop/fruitiness balance; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 06, 2013"

Surprised by the amount of hops in this guy and it's definitely deep and complex. It was a little much having the bomber to myself and there are just too many other great versions of this style.

I'll let this warm a little/ a burger dinner is almost finished for pairing this. With this brew it's odd, i really enjoy the immediate taste, and pick up more of a creamy, milk-chocolatey fruit-like presence to the tune of raspberries & cherries...however this all quickly turns into the astringent back-end, dominated by a dry, roasted alcohol burn.

This exhibited a nice blend of chocolates, vanillas, booze, and fruit, going both with and atop a hearty, roasty, sweeter malt base. The aroma begins things in a similar fashion, with evenness that betrays the inherent abv hidden within. The flavoring does the same, with much of the aforementioned flavors masking anything offensive. This feel lends general softness and slurpability, aiding drinkability, as if it needed it in the first place. This is a hearty brew, and it would definitely be best to find a companion to share it with. Yet another impressive, and varied offering from Ballast Point, who seem to be able to execute any style with their own unique flair and ease.","TheBrewo","Jun 07, 2013"

The taste brings in more of the same, with a bit more roast than before and a hint of bitter coffee near the finish, lingering on momentarily. The body is a lithe medium, with a light carbonation and a fluid feel.

Tastes are complex with roasted malt, anise, currant, molasses, earthy roasty bitterness, bittersweet chocolate, french roast coffee, mild tobacco leaf, and that fig is making an appearance again. Earthy piny hops begin to build and linger with each additional sip. As it warms, booze becomes more apparent, but not hot.

Numerous shades of black, a moderate tan head, and an understated aroma of chocolate, coffee grounds, and shelled nuts give way to a beguiling flavor. The brewery's skill bursts across the palate; swirls of chocolate, in an array of flavors, are complemented and boosted by mild hints of coffee, nuts, and hop bitterness. The lack of alcohol is what allows all these flavors to succeed, a statement of quality.

Id love to get my hands on a few more bottles at some point, this one seems to age much better than Victory at Sea.","twiggamortis420","Jul 22, 2012"

3.88,-3.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a very dark, nearly black color. The liquid is opaque and the head is cola-colored. The head forms nicely, but fades quickly, leaving sticky, spider-web lacing around the edge of the glass. The nose was a little disappointing. Not much there; some notes of coffee and even lighter notes of raw coco. Some plastic notes that are often present when hops and dark roasted malt are combined were detected as well. There is a nice, viscous mouthfeel that a beer with this appearance should deliver. I originally scored the taste a four, but I'm going to change it to a 4.5. I wish I could give it a 4.25; it deserves more than a 4, but not quite a 4.5. The taste is very well-balanced. Ripe fruit up front with smooth transitions to creamy vanilla. Some bitterness at the finish. There's also that unfortunate plastic flavor that is so common to this style. This is a pretty good beer. I chose this over Napa Smith's Hopageddon. I think I made the right choice. Perhaps I'll change my mind once I've had the Hopageddon. Based on my experience with Napa Smith's, I have a sneaking suspicion I won't.","DocJitsu","Jul 10, 2012"

The flavors consist of sweet roasted malts, like a Baltic Porter really, with a strange almost bitter chocolate aspect. It's just an interesting presentation of the aforementioned traits. It's unique. It drinks full in body and is call the flavors to he expected and up to par. It drinks well and is appealing. I say its solid and worth trying hut it won't wow you.","aasher","Beers"

Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted/burnt malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee and some dark fruit.

Fully opaque black liquid with barely a touch or orange at the glass bottom, not much more can be said. The nose is rich and powerful while unassuming and quite content to let you come to it than assault you, cocoa, mocha, licorice, Brazil nuts, vanilla powder, orange zest, oat cereal and granola, some cherry, plum to black grape fruit, not getting any real booziness here, sinks in without a thud. Full-bodied, likewise here it is clear it could make more of an “impression” than it does, the coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla bean brown sugar, licorice never that sweet while the hops bring pine, orange citrus and a non-bitter herbal component. The same cherry, plum, currant fruit evident and maybe a touch bolder. The carbonation is not absent but is no doubt simmering very slowly on the back burner. Those hops give it spring through the finish. Again, it is not too sweet but, by the same token, it would be difficult to call it a dry stout. You can call it highly enjoyable though.","farrago","Jul 14, 2011"

The taste of the beer is sweet and full of chocolatey notes upfront that finish with a bitter sweet vanilla coffee flavor. The mouthfeel is nice and thick here, really fits the style well.

He had a sweet core and a lighthearted personality, but no one would give him the benefit of the doubt. Skip burned with the rage of a Patagonia summer.

Pours a deep clear brown with a finger of tan head that dissipates to a ring around the side of the glass which that lacing lasted nicely throughout the session. Aroma is caramelly, roasted malts, coffee, a touch of chocolate, and more roasted malts. Flavor initially is roast forward with a bit of bittersweetness but is never astringent. It’s almost as there’s coffee in it. Moderate sweetness, caramel. This beer is a little bit odd. Lacks the depth of malts and the mouthfeel is sort of thin. The hop character is barely detectable but lightly grassy. There isn’t too much color saturation - you can see through the beer without much difficulty, which is odd considering the strong roast character.

It pours with a viscous look to it, coming out a dark amber-brown color that compounds into a deep almost-black when the glass is full. Pours with a healthy 1.5 inch head of chocolate milk coloring that slowly settles into a film as you consume. Great body, as almost the entire glass is laced. Nose is roast coffee and smoke, with dark molasses and meaty characteristics, as well. Smokiness throughtout the taste characteristics, which is fantastic! Dark flavors of coffee bean and cocoa nib also lend themselves to the flavor. Booze not overly present despite the higher ABV. Body is full, rich, and round, but tails off into a crisp, dry, and slightly bitter finish. Very pleasant darkly sweet aftertaste makes this an easy drinker for a bigger beer. I could easily get in trouble with this one!","GarthDanielson","Apr 09, 2011"

With the first taste I can pick up rich roasted grains, currants, and a beautiful sweetness. In the finish there is a fantastic robust coffee flavor that finishes dry, which is the perfect invitation to take another drink. The body of this one is thick and creamy with a very subtle carbonation. This is a fantastic beer, and I'm glad that I finally had the opportunity to try this one.

It tasted more mellow than expected like coffee and chocolate and oranges, with some caramel and maybe a bit of pineapple. It was fairly thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this beer was confusing at first, but I think I ended up enjoying it. It seemed to blend a stout's traditional mocha flavors with tropical hops. Once I deciphered that mix, the beer started to grow on me. It had nice body and hid the alcohol very well, so it wasn't difficult to drink.

It tasted *much* creamier and more robust than out of the bottle, it really tasted a lot more like a chocolately milk stout, with an amazing mouth feel.

3.95,-2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This about as close as you can get to black without actually being black. Half a finger of tan head forms when poured vigorously--not the foamiest of beers. Smells of coffee and chocolate. Tastes moderately of chocolate, coffee, caramel, malt, licorice. A nice balanced combination of flavors, but they really were a bit weaker than they should have been. If the flavors had been bumped up a notch, then it would have been first rate.","PhxHorn","Jan 16, 2009"

The funny thing was that to say it is an IMP stout to me it's a stretch. It was almost Quaffable in some ways I could not detect any of the 10% in this at all.

3.7,-8.2,4,4,3.5,3,4,"Little did I know that there were two Sea Monsters. Pours jet black with brown edges. Small, thick tan head only one finger high. Minimal lacing, though it could have been the glass. Roasty, grainy aroma with burnt coffee, sour mash, leather, and wood. Acerbic taste initially, more of a black coffee bite when the beer warmed. Lots of coffee in this one. Baker's chocolate and cocoa, along with hints of vanilla, caramel, and cream. Periodicaly, there was a sour/metallic tang. Kind of like a Goldings hop bite with a twist of sour milk. It wasn't necessarily unpleasant, but I could have done without it. Like the non-Imperial version, this was a bit loose and watery in the mouthfeel, more so in this version given the style. Despite its warts, this was easily drinkable and I'll be sure to revisit it.","magictrokini","Jan 04, 2009"
3.48,-13.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a body that is as dark as night. Small tan-colored creamy colored head. Coffee aroma, some alcohol. Some sweetness, molasses and some oatmeal.

4.03,0,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Tastes great and offers a lingering slightly chewy chocolate flavor on the finish. Fuller bodied than prior years in my opinion, likely to balance the higher ABV of the brew. (The label calls this an Imperial Oatmeal Stout, not sure if prior releases were Oatmeal Stouts but I would assume so.) Quite tasty and quite drinkable as the occasional alcohol on the nose never translates to the taste buds. Carbonation is just about perfect. A nice, and hoppy, stout.","HalfFull","0"

Nose has a distinct smell of alchol soaked raisens and dark fruits with some biscuity malt as well. With first sip your mouth is flooded by smokey almost ashy malt tones that are very dark. Raw metalic minerals and tones of woodsy tree bark stick to the back of the tongue. The flavors that are initialy abrubt but quickly mellow and grew on you. Mouthfeel is thick rich and enjoyable. This is a wonderfully drinkable stout with a well hidden 8% alchol.","SPLITGRIN","Jun 09, 2008"
3.95,-2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours an opaque darkness with a big stiff dark tan head that resists fading and leaves sheets of lacing in its wake. The smell is aggressive. Highly roasted malts coffee, chocolate and molasses. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is tangy, rich and full bodied. Unlike my favorite Double stouts, the mouth lacks that lingering coating texture. Full flavored, the highly roasted coffee character is showcased, slightly over powering the oat. A ton of high quality ingredients in this one. Best enjoyed on the wintry months. Darn glad that i had the opportunity to try this one!","jjayjaye","Jun 04, 2008"

4,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Light in body and depth. Not one of those "monster" stouts but a good roasted, chocolatey, malty stout that is easy drinking. Some coffee flavor and coffee tannins really show through on the finish. Raisin, black currant and mollasses are noticeable albeit somewhat masked by the roasted malts. A nice hop bitterness mixees with the coffee tannin nicely.","mcallister","Apr 17, 2008"
4.05,0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Bottle says 8% abv, but whatever, it seems much lighter in alcohol. This beer pours black with a nice creamy tight beige head and some spotty lacing. Smells particularly creamy, and not like a RIS at all, but rather like a dry stout- if a little on the creamy side. Some nice light roastiness as well in the aroma. The taste confirms this. Slightly sweet, very creamy, lightly roasty, and with some licorice on the finish. Tasty. The mouthfeel is uber smooth and creamy. Nice, even on a relatively warm day.","Georgiabeer","Apr 01, 2008"

3.85,-4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours black with a decent sized medium tan head that slowly fades to a faint covering. Aroma is strong roastiness with a little chocolate behind it, some lactose milkiness as well. Somewhat smokey aroma when agitated with a little nuttiness and chocolate in the background. Taste follows the aroma, roastiness being the dominant aspect. Fairly dry and smokey roastiness, a little like smoking a pipe, some cola sweetness as well and an acidic roasty twanginess. Mouthfeel is medium but is cut by a spicy, active carbonation and finishes fairly dry with some alcohol warmth showing. A good beer, the level of smokey dryness caught me off guard the first sip or few, but really drinks fairly easily and is even somewhat refreshing, light, from the lighter feel.","hoppymeal","Mar 19, 2008"
4,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4,"This is lighter and hoppier than I expected, but it's pretty solid and tasty. It's finally starting to warm up outside so I'm not sure I wanted a big, heavy stout today anyway.

Now don't get me wrong there are much better double stouts out there, but this does have a bit of a charm to it, a little bit extra that the others perhaps just did not have. I would have liked to have seen this one be a little fuller as I feel that the thinness in the profile really hurt it a bit, however other then that I would say to go out and give this one a try, and it would be worth it.","mikesgroove","Feb 17, 2008"

Stickiness is amazing, lots of thick webbing on the sides. Smell is a very light wood scent with a hint of citric hops. A faint floral aroma makes an unwanted appearence. Chocolate, caramel, and toasted oat are pretty weak in the nose but there. A good Folger's presence all over. I just don't understand the smell of this one. Wow, taste is very coffee-ish. Fresh french roast flavor that is quickly taken over by a dusty hop bite. Smokey roasted barley with dark chocolate in the mix as well. Just not enough sweetness to call this an oatmeal stout. Medium body with a slick and smooth feel. Subdued carbonation throughout. This beer is all over the place, not enough balance IMO.","BeerTruth","0"

The head was a tan mocha color that was full and thick for a minute and then was gone with a slight residue left over. Smell is coffee, roasted malt, and a hint of coco. Taste is coffee, chocolate, small amount of alcohol but hiden very well. Mouthfeel is dry full body with not as much thickness as other imperial stouts.
