"Bomber from Sadie for my birthday.  Sat in the fridge for six months before I drank it.  It was very mellow and smooth...I wonder if the cellaring of this smoothed it out...I'll need to try a fresh one next year to see the difference."

"O-  The aroma grows and is interesting but the flavor is odd with a lot of strange flavors mixed together and they don't really compliment each other."
""
"This was a decent beer. The pie crust smell/taste is intriguing at first, but it gets old quick. Perhaps I'll get another next Fall, but not something I would drink regularly."
""
"I do not get this one. I like the look and mouth feel but; I could not get past the medicine with all spice taste."
"Is that... cardamom? Reads like a stout, and a refreshing break from the usual coffee or chocolate or vanilla overload. And/but can be a little potpourri-ish."

"Sorry, but this beer is simply revolting.  Beyond cloyingly sweet.  So sugary my teeth actually felt gritty after a few sips.  Stacked high with the sweetness, there is a chemical, artificial-flavor flavor.  Nauseating. Poured it down the sink, and that's hard for me to do. This is a beer for people who drink 3L bottles of soda every day."

"Hands down my favorite pumpkin beer."

"The beer is black, but with scarlet shades when held to a light.  It is topped with a thick cream-colored foam.  The smell is of ripe pumpkin...mixed with bread-pudding and dark chocolate.  You can almost smell the sweetness.  There is spice as well.  The dark stout flavor reveals itself in the taste...rostedness is underneath the sweetness, and there is a solid hop bitterness as well.  Thick and intense.  This is a substantial beer."
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is another of Southern Tier’s Blackwater Series that I really, really, like!  It’s a delicious beer!"
"Thin, too much alcohol burn on the palate and has a buttery/nutty taste that deters from the brew. Would not buy again."
"One of my favorite stouts period. One of my favorite beers throughout the fall season. I think Southern Tier brews their best beers in the fall (pumpking, harvest, warlock)"
"o: i like this.   its a nice take on a pumpkin-esqe beer.  blending it with a nice roasty flavor is an enjoyable aspect.  the mix of sweet, caramel, pumpkin, and spice works nicely in here"
""
""
""
""
""
"Awesome beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's like a pumpkin infused with Guiness"
""
""
""
"The combination of the pumpkin, spices, and dark roasted malt doesn't work for me. I figured I'd love this one, but I was disapponted."
""
""
"Very good stout beer. Really enjoyed it. We'll have again"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: can't drink more than one, but went great with BBQ salmon.  Best shared with a few friends."
""
""
"O - I actually kept going back and forth as to whether this was a drinking or a sipping beer.  The appearance and smell tell you sipping, but you didn't get that high ABV warming when drinking.  This was a really interesting beer that I'd like to try again."
""
""
""
""
"Very different spices.  Smell and taste of a lot of crystal malts.  Not sweet at all.  Really good taste but different."
""
""

"Poured in to a Westbrook snifter, the espresso-like liquid settles with virtually no head, trapping most light, and lending an umber tone when well illuminated. There is no lacing, and the relative fluidity of the beer reveals it's lack of viscosity. Immediately, memories of tootsie rolls come to mind as I take a deep dive in to the bouquet. Fall spices and classic pumpkin pie aromas also greet the nose. This is very intriguing. Absent are many of the typical scents of an imperial stout... coffee, roast, smoke, alcohol.... and I think that suits this beer perfectly. It's like a fine confection, brimming with desert-like appeal. The flavor follows suit, delivering chocolate sweetness and an assortment of holiday cheer. The underlying alcohol is fairly well-hidden, and the brew achieves a nice balance with minimal bitterness. The hop profile is obscured, but like any great supporting actor, it puts in a worthy performance. This really has all of the charm of Pumking, with an added dimension that makes the beer imminently drinkable. I really appreciate the balance. Pumking was like a revelation for me, but quickly became too intense to drink much more than a single pour. With Warlock, I have refilled my glass from the Blackwater bomber, and could easily go back for more. The flavors of this seasonal treat remind me a little of Allagash Black, but where that one veered off course, this one stays right on track. The only ""complaint"" that I might add, is that the mouth-feel is a little underwhelming. Perhaps that's what gives Warlock it's supreme drinkability, but I must admit that the medium-thin body makes me yearn for a little more. Overall, this is a new addition to my must-have holiday rotation.   I am enchanted by Warlock's wizardry."

"O:  A decent pumpkin-themed stout, but the spices dominate at the expense of the underlying stout.  I was really hoping that more of the nice chocolate/coffee/roasted qualities that I've come to expect from ST's Blackwater Series stouts would show through, blending perfectly with the creamy pumpkin pie flavors and added spices.  Still, worth a try, especially if you enjoy pumpkin beers at this time of the year."

"This is my first mobile review so I'll be brief. Southern tier has not been good to me and this beer is no exception. It tastes like a pumpkin ale but instead of pumpkin it's been replaced by Coal. The strong nice smell of cinnamon and nutmeg Is the best part of the Beer and you can really taste it. However quickly turned lame carbonation, burnt malt, plastic aftertaste and very heavy body is why this beer is getting a low rating. I got this one as a gift because I have yet to have a good beer from these guys. Hope it's the last one I have."

"I have never enjoyed Pumking, and this is not much better.  A sickly sweet, allspice bomb that is not enjoyable for me to drink.  Enough said."

"halloween is my least favorite time of year for beer. I think martzens are two malty and I dislike pumpkin beers. However this beer makes the pumpkin palatable to me.  I think it's well done. Kudos to Southern Tier."

"  With that being said dare I say that I like this better than Pumking?  The malts balance very nicely against the normally aggressive pumpkin and make for a very enjoyable brew"
""
"Just as good as the Pumking in terms of a fine seasonal pumkin brew, but even better as a dessert beer."
""
"Thin black pour with a small head. Spicy cinnamon aroma. Sweet caramel toffee aroma. Slight candy corn smell. Definitely better better than Pumking. Tastes sort of like a candy corn dipped in chocolate. Minor corn taste."
""
"Bottle: Poured a black color stout with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of cinnamon is quite powerful and hides every other flavours. Taste is also dominated by loads of cinnamon and other spices leaving little spices to roasted malt and/or black chocolate notes or even pumpkins. Body is below average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. I get the concept of this beer but this just lack overall balances."

"For those who enjoy spiced beers, like christmas ales, and other pumpkin flavored beers, I think this will be right up your alley."

"Overall - a wonderful beer whatever you want to characterize this as whether it's a pumpkin beer, a pumpkin stout and American imperial stout it doesn't matter. Just a great delicious beer all around. Within two sips I realized this is one of my favourite 10 beers ever. Just great stuff."
"It seems to me that in creating Warlock Southern Tier did nothing but add a spot of black malt for colour to their Pumking recipe. I may be wrong, but tell that to my senses. I love Pumking so I won't sit here and tell you that the nearly identical Warlock is anything other than delicious, but I demand more from a beer labeled an ""imperial stout"". Overall, this was a huge disappointment."

""

"Awesome, almost as good as Pumking."

"An exquisite melding of stout and pumpkin ales. Dark and seductive with rich, robust flavors rolled into one delicious package. A prime example of what depth and complexity really mean regarding taste and feel. A must try..."

"Awesome beer. Belgian dubbel style. Reminds me of a local Darwin's beer called Ayawaska but better."
""
""

"Incredible blend of aroma and flavors, but overall sweet and spicy without obvious over-presence of pumpkin. There's no other beer I've tried that tastes quite like this one, and I won't hesitate to try it again."

"Final Grade: 4.02, a solid A-. Southern Tier's Warlock makes for a pretty tasty dessert beer, but I must admit that I'm a little disappointed - this is very Pumking-esque, but the 'stout' aspect of the beer is a little lacking. Any semblance of chocolate, coffee, roastiness or anything else you'd expect from an imperial stout is too subtle to come to the fore; simply buried underneath a dump truck load's-worth of pumpkin pie spice. This is not a bad beer, but it's not as good as Pumking and there is still plenty of room for improvement. Worth a shot I suppose, but big stout fans will be left wanting."
"3.98/5.00"

"Pours dark black with a good light tan head that retains nicely. Smell has aromas of pumpkin chocolate and a large sweet ginger bread and malt aroma. Taste is much less sweet then the smell with similar flavors of pumpkin,chocolate, nutmeg ginger bread and a slight roasted char bitterness in the finish. Medium to heavy mouthfeel, semi bittersweet, nicely balanced."
"Pours a cola like brown that isn't quite black and produces a thin beige head and not much lacing.  Pumpkin pie aromas of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, pumpkin, vanilla and graham cracker.  Underneath Warlock brings roasted melt aromas of smoke, chocolate and coffee.  The taste delivers bringing the pumpkin pie flavor, spices, burnt graham cracker, chocolate and coffee.  A wonderful array of flavors.  A bit thin on mouthfeel being on the lower end of medium.  Opens creamy and finishes dry.  This is a fantastic beer that brings roasted flavors to the familiar Pumking profile."

"Great stout.   Lots of complexity and great taste.  Deep roast pumpkin, cinnamon, and gingerbread.   It will kick your butt if you drink more than one."

"Overall, this is an interesting concept that doesn’t quite come off in execution as good as it sounds on paper.  There are too many peculiar, distracting flavors that keep it from gaining traction as a cohesive drinking experience. It’s not bad, and I’m glad to have tried it, but it wasn’t as good as I remember on tap."

"The beer pours a decent and slightly brown creamy head that dissipates very quickly. The beer itself is a very dark brown that borders on black. The smell has strong roasted pumpkin notes and spices as well as more roasted and chocolate notes on the side. The spice is much more pronounced than Pumking. The spices tend to be more of a roasted cinnamon with vanilla. The pumpkin is pretty sweet. The chocolate and roasted malts aren't very pronounced but are detectable when it warms up a bit. The taste is a bit different. Essentially, the pumpkin and vanilla notes are stronger with a side of the spice and those flavors mix well the chocolate and roasted malt notes. The taste is reminiscent of a chocolate carrot cake. The mouthfeel is full bodied but surprisingly smooth compare to most other imperial stouts. The carbonation is medium and adds a little texture to the beer. Overall, this is a surprisingly good beer. Personally, I think this beer is what Pumking should have been and a much better choice. I'll be getting this one again next year for sure."

"It's funny they say to drink this at 42 degrees, because it's a million times better warm when the stout shows up. The perfume takes a back seat and this becomes more enjoyable. As things stand, this beer was okay but almost a workout to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Very lazy review. Smells and tastes like Pumking with some chocolate and light coffee. Tastes good. I'm happy."
""
""
""
"(3.75) D: This was tasty and the aroma was outstanding, however the bold sweet flavour is such that half a bomber bottle would be enough for me. Very unique and something I'm glad I tried."

"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into Pumking chalice.  Pours a deep brown with little to no head retention.  The smell is wonderful, very pumpkin pie like with nutmeg and slight cinnamon overtones.  The taste is similar to the smell until the end, at the finish I get a very strong nutmeg/bitter taste that is quite unappealing.  The beer goes down smooth with a slightly thicker mouth feel.  Overall an average pumpkin flavored beer, but nothing I would seek out again.  The bitter over the top spice notes on the finish are too much for me."
""

"If I had to choose between Warlock and Pumking for the rest of my life, I'd go with Pumking. But this is a very tasty change of pace."

"O - Just can't do pumpkin beers.  There's just too much ""pumpkin"" flavoring, so heavy handed.  It comes off artificial and undrinkable to me.  I'd love this to be a great stout first, then a pumpkin beer, rather than the other way around."
"I'd try this again, but I'm disenchanted to know this has added flavors. Maybe that explains some more f the off character. Also a bit disillusioned about calling this an imperial stout."
""
""
""
""

"This will be a staple in my fall brews for years to come.  What a great pumpkin stout that lives up to it's name."

"All in all, this was a balanced and very tasty beer.  Nice!"
""
""
""
"Well, it says this beer is retired and I say that's for the best.  You can tell the base stout to this beer is solid, great black appearance, hop balance, and mouthfeel.  Where this beer disappointed was the spice boutique, way too much Potpourri taste, harsh and pungent on the taste buds.  While I found Pumking to be a classic pumpkin beer Warlock can be skipped."

"O: interesting take on a pumpkin beer and an improvement over most; a little thin for a stout;"

"22oz bomber: This one pours a clear, very dark brown color. There was a thin tan head that didn’t linger long or leave any lacing. Definitely pumpkin to the nose. Also a sweetness to the pumpkin. Perhaps some cinnamon. The taste is good, but there is a slick sweetness that isn’t necessarily appealing. Cinnamon, chocolate, pumpkin flavors are predominate. Like the Pumpking, the sweetness turns me off. I won’t be having another."

"Pours dark almost black in color. Smells of Gingerbread with molasses.  taste like it smells. decent pumpkin beer"

"pours black, still...not much carbonation, little head. no lacing. smells just like pumpkin pie-no kidding. actually, very reminicent of Pumking...a little roasted malt, but mostly big spice, pumpkin pie. big full bodied creamy mouthfeel. tastes like pumpkin pie, with big roasted malt in the finish. I actually like this better than Pumking, a lot less cloying sweetness, just as much spice. big pumpkin taste, i cant say pumpkin pie enough. but the roasted malt adds a bit of smokiness in the finish, not so much as others i've had where it can taste like burnt pumpkin pie...adds a good balance to the sweetness. and it is still very sweet."

"Reminded me more of a Old Ale/Winter Warmer than an Imperial stout. Very malty of course, molasses and chocolate dominate the palate. Lots ofadded flavoring. I got cinnamon, ginger, and vanilla, maybe some nutmeg too. Some pumpkin and squash notes though not alot. I enjoyed drinking this, too me its more of a winter beer, than a fall. Worth checking out."

"9/24....pours dark black, full light block, but little foam. Sits still and quiet. Rich fruity forward nose, raisins, coffee, chocolate, licorice. Very faint pumpkin too. Astringent taste, all over the place. Really boozy. Interesting, but not quite sure."
""
""

"22oz bottle into a goblet.  Pours very dark, with a strong head and lots of lace on the side.  Pumpkin and spice (nutmeg and ginger(?)) aroma, with some must and a bit of funk as well.  Sharp and bitter in the front, which fades to sweet maltiness.  Mouthfeel is almost whiskey-like, which is surprising as it is not a particularly high alcohol beer.  Medium carbonation and a long finish."

"O: A very solid beer. Imperial stouts are by far my favorite style. However, though this is labeled as one, I couldn't really tell from the taste. I would have no problem drinking this again, but I wouldn't seek it out as I did this year. I've been meaning to try this since I got into craft beer last fall and I am not too disappointed."

"Not a particularly notable Imperial Stout, from the colour, to the weight, to the outright flavour, which I don't believe can justifiably be pinned on the guest ingredients, as neither the pumpkin nor the seasonal spices are the reason for this one's lacking.  More of a jacked-up brown ale at the base, before the Thanksgiving goodness takes its turn - I don't think Pumking has much to fear in terms of sibling rivalry here."
""
""
"You can actually smell the roasted pumpkin in this one. The taste is sweet caramelized pumpkin with notes of aged rum, coconut, brown sugar and subtle spices. A medium mouthfeel that feels more like a lighter porter than a stout. Overall the the best imperial pumpkin stout I've had so far."
""
"Even though this is black as the night it somehow doesn't deliver a lot of roasty, stout like flavors for me. The pumpkin pie spice dominates it entirely and I find it feels just like Pumking. Less spice and more roast would make this a good to great beer."

"Pours dark brown, slightly Amber with very little head that faded quickly. Aroma is of pumpkin pie and spices. Taste is also pumpkin pie with some sweet dark roasty flavors. Mouthfeel was pretty thin for an imperial stout, lacking a good hardy finish normally in an imperial stout. Overall this was a little disappointing, I guess I was just expecting more from an imperial stout. Not a bad beer at all though, probably will stick to Pumking in the future."
""
"Starts off with the sweetness of Pumking, then finishes with a nicely balanced roasted malt and chocolate flavor."
""

"BOD 6/26/14.  Black pour with a normal head, but poor lacing and retention.  Nice nose of ginger, clove, cinnamon and maybe nutmeg.  Underneath is a bit of pumpkin and subtle notes of roast and chocolate coupled with an airy light sweetness.  As it warms, chocolate becomes much more noticeable.  Medium bodied with a light smooth texture.  Lower than normal carbonation with no effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is where this one shines - intense, complex and balanced.  It begins with a rush of spice, with ginger and clove the most abundant,  over a light sweetness with pumpkin and roast deep in the background.  In the middle, chocolate notes yield to a hop/roast background with an expertly balanced bitterness.  The finish is a blend of the aforementioned flavors fading away into a nice mild alcohol burn at the back of the throat.  Lingering is a bit of roast, bitterness and pumpkin."

"Very good tasting for a imperial stout. Nice color and smell, stouts are usually not my cup of tea but this one impressed me. Definitely a must buy if wanting a dark pumpkin stout."
""
""
""
"This one does an outstanding job of being everything an imperial stout should be while also fully embracing the whole seasonal thing. It's a fantastic beer which I wouldn't crave year-round but which I really hope to find again next year. I would really like to find enough of it to do the rumored delicious mixing of this with Pumpking."
""
""
"Overall - The use of pumpkin is fantastic; it's a great complement without being overwhelming. This is my ideal fall beer. My only qualm is with the carbonation and gravity, as the bite slightly detracts from the flavor and the lower gravity just seems out of place."

"O-a nice spin on pumpkin beers. a good change from the average pumpkin beer"
"Immediately after pouring I get a roasted almonds nougat smell identical to a roaster ferrara torrone. The mouth feel is thick and silky and when held the tingling of the hops show their power. Then when swallowing I get a strong roasted flavor followed by the exact taste of a roasted ferrara torrone I smelt earlier and a complexly layered chocolate malt I smelt earlier. I've been drinking this every day and I remember tasting pumpkin and possibly cinnamon  the first few times I had it.  I don't taste the pumpkin/cinnamon anymore so maybe I suck at reviewing beer. At the moment this is my favorite beer. The only points it loses is in the look. Labeled an imperial stout I expect it to be blacker then black and its a brown/black but not disappointing. I plan on aging a few of these if I can stop drinking them."

The taste is very creamy pumpkin pie flavors, slightly smokey, some chocolate flavors.  Good flavors, nice body.  Overall its a pumpkin ale with good pumpkin pie flavors, and a strong malty backbone with some chocolate."

""
"Wow, this one hits you like... well, a pumpkin in the face, bit in a good way.  Taste is extreme in all regards,  the nutmeg,  the cinnamon,  the clove, and yes the pumpkin.  Warning: do not drink this unless you like pumpkin pie!!"

"As dark as Mischief Night, expect this Warlock to be wearing a top hat of pillowy foam. The nose is very similar to Pumking, with sweet aromas of vanilla and baking spices. Smooth and medium-bodied, it presents a fairly soft level of carbonation upon pouring. Chicory, birch beer, molasses, and pumpkin pie spices tempt your taste buds into dancing with the devil, while a suggestion of herbal, woodsy hops in the finish complete the spell. A welcome twist on a seasonal style."

"Overall, an interesting spiced pumpkin stout."

"I like pumpkin beer and I like stouts...so I should love this right? Well I sort of did...It had good spice to it, almost like the pumking does...I found them quite similar EXCEPT, the mouthfeel on this was super thin....and also there wasn't much nose to this beer....so no nose and no mouthfeel definately took away from this beer...Not a must try"

"On the pumpkin beer spectrum that ranges from pumpkin pie to gourd in flavor, Warlock is certainly more toward the pie side. However, unlike many pumpkin pie beers the crust taste really stands out. There are also lots of roasty, nutty, and cola notes that keep this beer interesting."

"A touch lighter in color than pure black and a cautious pour left very little in the way of head on top.  The smell is rather dramatic if not a bit weird.  With the glass several inches away the toasted biscuit aromas become apparent, below that there is a great deal of spice as well, mostly those typical in pumpkin beers like nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon.  This being a stout there is also some roasted malt and chocolate maltiness as well.  Those darker malts make there presence known in the taste as they follow closely behind the spices and end up playing a more assertive role.  There is a little bit of bitterness that is likely due to both the dark roasted malt and hops but hop flavor is very restrained.  The body is medium with a dry finish and lingering spiciness that takes a long time to fade.  Overall I'm going to rate this a bit below average, the spice is just too overpowering and the therefore the balance seems off.  An interesting beer but not the best I've had of the style."

"I am good for one, maybe two, pumpkin beers a year. If you're in the same camp, Warlock (and its brethren Pumking) will be for you. Flavor wise, the pie spices let you know what this beer's intentions are. The flavor is cloves first, followed by a little bit of cinnamon, with a decent malt backbone. This combination starts out pie like and finishes earthy. Leans a bit toward the dry side, but only slightly. While there is some noticeable alcohol in the aroma, it doesn't show up in the taste. As AIS go, this is low ABV and thinner mouthfeel/body then you might expect. Carbonation is medium-light. There is little to no head or lace."
"Imperial STOUT though? I don't know, it doesn't have the mouthfeel or flavor that really makes me think of that style at all. It's more like a porter or a brown ale, I think. The best thing about Warlock? The aroma. I'd recommend trying it out -- especially when it's warmed up. Cold? Forget about it. Eh..."

"A little different but just as good as Pumking.  I really like how ST brings the pumpkin flavor forward yet manages to deliver an otherwise delicious beer.  There is a mild roasted flavor which probably also explains the darker color.  Of course there's pumpkin, but taste is nicely balanced.  One thing for sure the aroma screams pumpkin!"

"Black pour with a small beige head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is light pumpkin and nutmeg. Flavor is sweet with a pumpkin pie like taste upfront that has elements of pumpkin, nutmeg, vanilla, brown sugar and a really nice pie crust flavor. Medium to full body also has a distinct bitter flavor of roasted malt and burnt chocolate. Finishes with an almost candy like pumpkin flavor that is balanced by a hint of the bitter roasted malt."

"Poured a rich, translucent black body with reddish brown highlights and no real head to speak of. A very nice stout body, but more head would be nice. Scents of pumpkin, rich, buttery pie crust, notes of nutmeg and other pumpkin pie spices and a hint of roast malt, dark chocolate and black coffee faintly in the background. Overall impression is of a pumpkin beer aimed towards the pumpkin pie side of the style, with a slight bit of a stout aroma in the background adding some depth. Rather nice, though the stout character could be a bit more assertive. Flavor begins medium-sweet with notes of pumpkin, buttery pie crust and pumpkin pie spices. This moves into a middle that is medium-dry with notes of buttery pie crust, pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices continuing, but mingling nicely with moderate notes of roasted malt, black coffee and cocoa. Finish is medium-dry with notes of roast malt, black coffee and cocoa evident, but with a nice flavor of buttery pie crust, pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices providing background flavors. Faint traces of alcohol are present in the middle and finish. Aftertaste is roasted malt and buttery pie crust mingling about equally. Overall impression is of a series of pumpkin pie flavors combined with a nice balance of stout flavors that increase in intensity through the sip. Quite nice and a good change from many other pumpkin beers. Mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth and slick with moderate carbonation. Overall impression is of a good smooth stout that drinks easily. Overall this is the best pumpkin beer I have tried. It combines the basic flavors of Pumking with a very nice stout to create a rich, deep flavor profile that is simply wonderful. This is aided by a wonderfully smooth mouthfeel. The aroma, which is too similar to Pumking, is the only downside of this beer. Otherwise it is an excellent example of what can be done with pumpkin beers."

"I am  BIG FAN OF Pumking and could not wait  to try this since i  also love stouts and Porters. OK first off, if you get a chance (since i just bought a case of bombers of Warlock  and a case of 12  bomber Yeti oak aged Imperial Stouts) , try blending these two together . Outstanding !!! but back to Warlock on its own , I have to say it is basikly pumpking with a small amount of bitter malt aftertaste. My guess is SOuthern teir did there own blending of Pumking and maybe there 2X stout ???"

Tons of flavor, great balance, especially with its pumpkin and spice qualities which are refreshingly understated for a ""pumpkin beer"". As the bottle indicates, likely an outstanding pairing with food like carrot cake- so much so that I'm sad I didn't have any available!"

"Pretty nice beer. Smells of pumpkin and banana. Some toffee notes in the nose as well. The head is nice for about 30 seconds and then leaves entirely. Mouthful is a bit thin and the flavors in the nose shine through in the beer. There is definitely some alcohol present as well. Overall not a bad brew but I think it would definitely benefit from some aging."

"I ain't waitin' for VDubb: this shit's goin' down my gullet right now. It pours a deep black-brown topped by a finger of sandstone foam. The nose comprises mild roasted malts and even milder treacle adrift in a sea of the usual pumpkin pie spice blend (nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar, clove, vanilla bean, graham cracker, allspice, und so weiter). The taste brings in more of the same with the roast and treacle taking larger roles, particularly the latter, and clashing with the spices a bit. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mostly smooth feel. Overall, an okay stout, but the spices and roast don't meld perfectly together. This clashing doesn't completely derail the situation, but it doesn't help all that much, either."

"O: Overall I thought it was an okay beer, but I don't feel the pumpkin flavor or the stout flavor do much to complement each other. It's like drinking a pumpkin beer and chasing it down with a stout in the same bottle. The stout quickly overwhelms the pumpkin flavor and makes it hard to enjoy. At the end of the drink I'm left with no pumpkin on the palate, just bitterness. The best elements of this beer are the scent and how artfully the alcohol is hidden. I wouldn't dissuade anyone from drinking this beer, but I wouldn't argue that they should seek it out if it is not readily available."

"O: This beer hides its alcohol rather well so it is relatively easy to drink, although my personal preference would be to have a little more pumpkins to balance with the spices."
"Although this beer is definitely on the sweet side (like so many of the big offerings from Southern Tier), I have to say that I enjoyed this very much. I treated this like dessert, so the sweetness didn't bother me in the least- a time and a place for everything. I like the blending of roasty stout with the pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices. You get chocolate and vanilla notes as well as some roasted notes from the stout, some silkiness from the pumpkin, and a nice sweet/spicy note from the additions. Definitely hit the spot for me."
""
""
""

"Warlock is a great beer! It wobbles a little on the palate, but only because the spicing is so strong, and loses some of the decadent quality of the nose. If the flavors drew back a little on the spicing and up'd that vanilla and graham crackery base more, I would be all in on this Southern Tier offering."

"This. This is just a little bit gross. Not a lot. Not a drain pour. But just not where I want my stout to go. Imagine you took your nice, tasty, standard stout. It's good, but not great. Then you make it a little creamy. Kinda like a milk stout, but much more of a cream flavor. Then you pour a crap ton of nutmeg and pumpkin spice in to make it smell like cream nutmeg and pumpkin spice. You realize this was a bad idea. So you put in some pumpkin and some ginger to balance out your abuse of spice. you taste it. You have made it worse. You have now created a creamy, pumpkiny, spicey, stouty, unbalanced mess of a beer. You put a fun picture on the bottle and sell it for halloween. People buy it because of this, and because you usually make good beers. The picture on the bottle really is kinda fun. Best part of the beer."

"Beerwolf77 and I are avid pumpkin beer (and general pumpkin) fanatics so the first of our two outrageously large pumpkin beer tastings this year required Warlock's inclusion. Upon taking our first sip, we simultaneously looked at each other with disgust and went to the sink with our glasses and bottle. Unfortunately for Todd, he purchased two bottles at the same time giving me the pleasure of revisiting it for this review. In closing, I hate to just shit all over a beer, especially when my reviews are generally higher than the average so, I'll make it clear I like Southern Tier. They make some fantastic beers but, Warlock is not one of them."

"The mouthfeel is medium-to-heavy with average carbonation, and is not sticky on the finish. Overall, this is a decent beer, with a wonderful nose, but lacking in taste. Something just seems a little off in the flavor combinations in the taste, and it doesn't work for me."

"Picked this up at the brewery. Deep dark mahogany-black pour with a two finger beige head with minimal retention and decent lacing. The nose is pretty much a roasty version of Pumking, which is my favorite pumpkin beer. Spicy and roasty with hints of cinnamon, licorice, nutmeg, cloves, dark chocolate, vanilla, and brown sugar. The taste mirrors the nose and reminds me of chocolate pumpkin fudge. Lots of cinnamon and nutmeg along with bitter dark chocolate, cloves, vanilla, molasses, and some subtle pine on the finish. The mouthfeel is rich, thick and syrupy with medium carbonation and a nice bittersweet finish. Overall, this was pretty much exactly what I expected and had hoped for...a big roasty version of Pumking! Not overly sweet, highly drinkable, and a perfect Thanksgiving or Christmas beer. Another great offering from my hometown brewery!"

"Pours a dark amber that is actually totally opaque, a light ecru head that is quite voluminous forms atop; great retention. Aroma is amazing! Pure dessert. Fleshy, creamy pumpkin pie abounds with notes of maple fudge and chocolate. Flavor is more spice oriented with some cinnamon thrown in there but there's still a good mix of chocolate and pumpkin with some slight coffee flavor. Very creamy and low carbonation. A winner in my book!"
"O: I still think the pumpking is better way to get the pumpkin flavor, but warlock is a nice holiday treat, best served fairly warm."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 9/20/2013. Pours nearly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big pumpkin, pumpkin seed, gingerbread, nutmeg, brown sugar, cinnamon, toast, pie crust, caramel, cocoa, roasted malt, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of pumpkin, spice, and malt notes with moderate roast presence; with great strength. Smells almost the same as pumking, but that’s not a bad thing. Taste of big pumpkin, pumpkin seed, cocoa, roasted malt, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, gingerbread, pie crust, toast, caramel, herbal, pine, and roasted earthiness. Good amount of roasted/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pumpkin, cocoa, roasted malt, cinnamon, nutmeg, toast, caramel, gingerbread, pie crust, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of pumpkin, spice, and dark/roasted malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent pumpkin spiced imperial stout. All around great balance of pumpkin, spice, dark/roasted malt and moderate hop bitterness; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
"Generally speaking, I'm not a big fan of stout. But this sh*t freakin' rocks! Poured from a growler, I didn't waste a lot of time oogling the appearance (although I will say that the head was ample, full, and clung to the glass for a long time), but instead buried my schnoz into the tulip glass and enjoyed the cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, coffee, vanilla nose and then satiated my curious thirst desperately inspired by an afternoon spent wrapping presents for my mother-in-laws' autre grand-rug-rats. And WOW, was I rewarded (""thank you, God""). Anyone who enjoys good beer made well will appreciate this palate pleaser. Smooth malty taste, with great balance between the alcohol and the creamy texture, and the root-beer-like taste of this charmer. Throw another log on the fire and peel off your panties, honey -- this one's a keeper!"
""
"Try it-- maybe you'll like it."
"O-Unique concept. Great flavor. If you like Pumking, you will like this even more."
"Overall: This beer hits the spot for a balanced stout with upfront sweet characteristics and a moderately bitter finish. The pumpkin provides a refreshing variation from the typical chocolate and coffee malt flavors of a stout. The pumpkin flavor is more subdued than in Pumking, but still the star of the show. So far, Pumking is my favorite pumpkin ale because of the strong pumpkin flavor and color. This beer is a nice variation for someone seeking a milder flavor."

"Overall: A very interesting beer, getting higher marks than expected due to its uniqueness. I don't get as much of the dark malt and roasty notes that I expect in an Imperial stout and was a bit disappointed in that. It seemed like a regular pumpkin beer brewed with a little debittered black malt to add color without flavor...like a schwartzbier. The lemon and ginger really made this taste more like a gingerbread cookie than a true pumpkin beer. Worth a try."

" The Warlock flavor is unique however it does seem like it is influenced by Pumking with the spice being the dominant flavor and the vanilla especially present with some nutmeg floral elements coming through and some mild caramel backing with mild roast and and mild hint of floral with perhaps a woody cinnamon and light toffee elements with a mild roasted note coming in near the finish when it reaches cellar temp. I was surprised with this condsidering it is a pumpking beer and stout hybrid. I think it gets labeled as a stout based on color, but not taste. I think if you expect a spiced/pumpkin ale you might be pleasantly surprised I was happy with the taste and it is highly drinkable regardless of style."

"O: Not exactly stout-like to me. Good, with mild pumpkin pie flavors. Expecting a bit more."

"Pours a very large head, very airy and comprised of larger bubbles, appears to have minimal density to it, basic tan color, not that dark, uneven surface, while the lacing streaks are thin they are numerous. Close to opaque but not quite, the color is a deep chocolate brown, the orange tint evident at the outer reaches, hard to see any bubbles at all, looks like a “tweener” would not guess stout per se. Oodles of ginger snaps, cinnamon, honey, pumpkin and milk chocolate to the nose, minimal roast or toast, all sunny sweetness, mild pie dough to yeast accents, extremely pungent and longlasting, like standing next to an exhaust pipe. Medium-bodied, lighter than might be expected, creamy texture even with average carbonation at best. On the sweet side, the pumpkin and accompanying baking spices are dominant and are smeared in vanilla frosting. Cola accents, sometimes tastes like RC cola. More roast here, teases out mild coffee to dark chocolate. Turns hollow at the finish, loses its initial intensity. At the same time becomes more like a “normal” stout. Needs an extra gear to really impress."
""
""
""

"Overall: I liked this beer a lot more before it warmed up, which is usually opposite for my tastes. My first glass was great, but the second was a little harder to drink. Overall an awesome brew to crack for thanksgiving, now on to PumKing!!"

"While this beer has some interesting traits, they don't harmonize all that well. It's suspiciously similar to Pumking, and doesn't possess very many imperial stout qualities. Kind of seems like a beer with an identity crisis. However, it's still relatively enjoyable."
"Just a delicious and unique stout. With lots of chocolate and plenty of pumpkin flavors that blend, not compete with the traditional stout flavors. So perfect for before dinner or dessert. Hints of spices and maybe black cherries. A superb and full creamy, milky mouth. I really enjoy this."
"9/13/2014, I got this in a growler and it is tastier and less expensive. The after taste on this is to die for. It lingers forever with a lovely bitterness."
"Overall a good pie like brew, though to me it's as if you left the pie in the oven to long."
""
"Finishes rather clean for such a complexity of flavor. Roasted grain holds back the spicing enough to keep it from getting overwhelming on your palate. This is one of the better pumpkin stouts I have had and the brewer has found a way to marry the flavors of pumpkin bie and roasted grains without muddling them or overpowering my taste buds. Surprisingly drinkable!"
""

""

"Has a lighter body than Pumking, or than most Imperial Stouts. Seems much more like a Porter, with a light to medium body, and average carbonation. Overall a nice beer. I just wish it wasn't as light bodied as it is."

""
""
"*from notes 10.31.13"

"O – Very nice brew here. It does not overwhelm you with huge pumpkin flavor and the other spices mix well. I get no traces of the ABV at all and it drinks well and goes down easy."
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with carbonation of medium-high intensity, resulting in a beer that is at first lightly fizzy, calming to a smooth (1/3) and foamy (2/3) mouthfeel. Ethanol is lightly noticeable on the back of the throat and in the nostrils, but not so on the palate. Closes dry, with moderate stickiness clinging to the palate."
""
""
""
"Good dessert stout but seems to be missing the pumpkin. Seems all graham cracker to me."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is actually pretty good, still too spicy, but there's an improvement here. Body is a hard medium. Starts sweet then fades away, but there's a hard gritty bitterness from the nutmeg that lingers forever. Could be a little more carbonated, but it doesn't drink like a 8.6% beer. Drinkability is there, again it would be better if it weren't so spicy. I didn't have Pumpking this year, but I remember liking it better than this, I normally like a pumpkin stout, and this one isn't bad, it's just not the caliber I'd expect out of Southern Tier. Worth trying, but you gotta share this one, you're making a mistake drinking it on your own."

"D/O Drinkability is decent despite an elevated ABV since it still does carry that great Pumking smell and taste. Overall this is an above average Imperial Stout but, of course, I do which that it was not so thin in the feel. 4.0"

"Poured into a Reuben's Brew snifter. Pours a very dark brown, appearing black in the glass, with a one finger light brown head with great retention and lacing. Very intriguing aroma of dark toasty malt, pie crust, baked pumpkin, peanut butter nuttiness and hints of pumpkin pie spices. Never smelled anything like it, but it's tempting. Flavor is sweet pumpkin and pie spices, big vanilla, chocolate. Finish is toasted, nearly charred malt and grassy hop bitterness that is not noticeable until the end. Medium bodied with some creaminess. Flavors very reminiscent of Pumking with an emphasis on stout's toasty malt. It's a nice combination. More pumpkin forward than my normal favorite Elysian's Dark of the Moon. DotM is more a stout with pumpkin flavor, this is closer to Pumking with some stout blended in. I like both combinations and will add this to my Autumn regulars. Anyother winner from Southern Tier."
"Overall: Definitely comes off as a blend of Pumking and a stout as opposed to a stout with pumpkin. Thus, your enjoyment of this beer will likely depend on your opinion of Pumking. I just so happen to love Pumking, so I'm a fan of Warlock."
""
""
"Overall: This beer brings a nice blend of stout and pumpkin flavors; I have a tough time saying that is dominated by one vs the other as every time I reach a conclusion; the flavors move in the other direction"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Honestly, if you blindfolded someone who knew what Pumking tasted like and gave them this beer to drink, they would say ""That's Pumking."" Really, the color is the only thing that makes this majorly different from Pumking which is pretty disappointing because I was at least looking forward to it having a creamy mouthfeel but it doesn't even have that."
""
"I love the Southern Tier Pumpking and I love Stout so I thought'd I'd have a no doubt winner here especially after reading all the reviews. I'm up to my 63rd pumpkin beer of the season and this one would NOT make my top 10 list vice the Pumpking. The smell was similar to the Pumpking but more rich/caramel/toffee. It poured dark with a strong head. The taste was more sweet and toffee flavored with caramel. would recommend you try it for yourself but i'm saying the pumpking has my vote."
""
""
"O. Absolutely phenomenonal. Is a good rich stout with pumpkin flavor. Doesn't kick you in the face with the pumpkin like Pumpking. I love the mixtures of flavor that compliment each other well. This could become one of my favorite seasonals."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: would drink again!"
""
"Overall: This is actually what I expected from the standard Pumpking that Southern Tier offers. I don't know why, but all the talk, and a bit of the hype made me think it was on this level. When afterall, it was this brew that I was after. I much prefer this over Pumpking, and hope it has a nice long life. And better distributed in the future!"
"22 oz bottle serving. Does pour to a thin, opaque black with a tan head of about 2 fingers. Aroma is very similar to Pumking - traditional pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, etc. I did taste vanilla and maybe a hint of malt. Taste was not overpowering of the same aromas but you do taste the pumpkin, nutmeg and cinnamon more than others. Fades much better than Pumking if you ask me. Solid stout. More mild and easy to go down than Pumking but seemed to have more a kick after 16 oz of it had passed my lips. I think it is very similar to Pumking but better and more refined. I still prefer Alewerks Pumkin over Pumking if you want a pumpkin beer. However, this one is pretty good. This is more balanced than Pumking. Definitely a little more sweet than Pumking. I'll pass on the Pumking the next go around and purchase a Warlock instead. Finding it on tap will be a miracle though. Very limited quantities."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Like Pumking blended with a stout. In fact....I think the aroma and parts of the taste IS Pumking. Not that I mind though. Very much dessert in a glass, but great with food. I had this with meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and vanilla pudding pie and it complemented everything nicely. That being said, I think I could finish one of these off myself without food, but I would probably regret it later. Very drinkable and dangerously so. Tasty brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had higher hopes, to be honest. This is very much like Pumking, and I hate to admit but I'm just not a huge fan of pumking. I think this could've been more balanced between spice and and roasted malt flavors, perhaps higher abv could've brought out a little more sweetness and richness, but who knows I'm not the expert"
"Mouthfeel is right on par with a stout. Wonderful beer!"
""
""
""
""
"O: If you've had Pumking, you've basically had this beer. Still, it was damn tasty."
""
""
"O: Lots of pumpkin spice. One of the better pumpkin/fall offerings."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is pretty good stuff. It's what should be anticipated but successfully crafted better than I expected. Basically ""Pumpking"" mixed with a charred bitter stout profile added to the mix. The only negative I would point out is the floral hop bitterness that throws off the marriage of flavors. Glad I picked this up."
""
"Note: Just had a taste of some on draft and its a totally different -- and better -- beer that way. Will be trying a full glass next week if they still have it in."
""
""
""
"Overall - awesome brew, ST. Awesome good beer at the Halloween beer tasting, but tonight me and the missus enjoyed a bomber just for us."
""
""
"Really tasty rich stout, could stand to have a fuller body, but otherwise not much to complain about if you like rich dessert stouts. Well worth trying."
""

"o - another stellar blackwater beer from ST. pumking is my favorite of that style and this beer did not disappoint."
""
""
""
"Low B-"
"Smells just like Pumking. Nose has that vanilla-nutmeg as their famous pumpkin ale. If I was blind, just by scent I’d assume it was Pumking. Thinner bodied than expected. Flavor has a large amount of vanilla notes under the Pumking flavor. Huge nutmeg, pumpkin pie spice, squash, and graham."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very good experimental style."
"O) Pretty good... I like regular Pumking a little better, but this is a nice seasonal offering in it's own right. Glad to recommend..."

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was a winner for me. Will definitely buy this again."
""
"4.0 D: I love pumpkin beers, but there are so few really tasty ones out there. Fortunately, this is one of them. Wish I had some Pumking to chase this with."
""
"Pours thick, black as night, two fingers of brown head. Looks stout, heavy, perfect for a cool fall evening. Scents of nutmeg, pumpkin pie, baked pie crust, and chocolate malt. Taste is heavy on spices and fresh pumpkin, extremely malty. Chocolate, roasted pecans and finally, pretty boozy. Surprisingly light bodied and thin. The alcohol lingers. Overall a flavorful beer that's similar in taste to Pumking. A little heavy on the spice but not a deal breaker."
""
""
""
"O- Won't be getting again. Would much rather have Pumpking."
""
""
""
"Dark black in color with ruby red highlights when held up to light. A thin off white head of foam rests on top. I get a bit of pumpkin with lots of nutmeg and cinnamon with roasted barley in the aroma. I get intense bitterness of roasted barley, hops mingling with sweet pumpkin at the front of the palate. It fades into a sweetness filled with cinnamon, nutmeg, raisins, and fig. The aftertaste is roasted barley out dueling hops. This is a bit thicker and with plenty of flavor so it is meant for slow contemplation. This is truly a unique brew and if you like pumpkin beers, but want a twist this is worth trying. If you like subtlety with spices, this is not your brew."
""
""
"D - A very nice brew... The similarities to Pumpking are undeniable, but this beer does stand on its own... Decent appearance and a very familiar aroma... Nice depth and complexity does emerge on the palate... While both are excellent brews, I think I prefer this to Pumpking by a slim margin... That being said, it's a solidly above average but somewhat unremarkable offering... Certainly worth trying, but not something I would need to invest in each and every autumn..."
""
""
"The boozy taste holds a tinny metallic feel, though it's just a small knock on an overall well constructed ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a great beer and one that only confirms that while I do enjoy a good pumpkin beer, I like them better when they aren't just a bottle of pie. The roasted characteristics provide a nice bitter counterpoint to the traditional flavor profiles. There is another pumpkin stout I like better, but this one is a solid and easier-to-find option that I'm likely to buy each year."
"Poured a somewhat blackish body with one finger head that left lace. A bready, pumpkin pie with crust type aroma along with cinnamon and nutmeg and some roasted malts as well in the aroma. Smooth and creamy are the first words that come to mind, and as I delve into this beer I'm getting a good balance of pumpkin flavors, sweet malts like caramel and dark chocolate and a good bit of roasted malts as well. Finish is a little heated and spicy and complements the more smoother and sweeter aspects of the beer. Not necessarily stout-like for those who prefer dryer stouts, but a really good sipper that is worth trying by anyone who likes their beers even slightly heavy."

"O- A great pumpkin beer that seems basically the Pumking recipe with some black malt thrown in the boil. Missing the orange luminescent glow that you get with Pumking. Wish would be a bit more stouty with a bit more viscosity, still a great beer though."
""
"O - Had on tap and it tastes almost exactly the same. As advertised, it's a roasty version of pumpking."
"pours a clear dark brown with thin tan head.  smell:  pumpkin pie with whipped cream,  full on pie just like pumpking.  Not much else... taste:  coffee,  toasted  brown bread,  caramel,  pie  spices.  bodyis   lighter than expected.  seems like a style variation that would work well,  but this one is just ok."
""
""
"O - They should just call this Pumpking dark or some variation of that. That's really all it is. I was disappointed with the mouthfeel. I think more chocolate would make this better and more like the dessert beers that the Black Water Series is known. I like this beer, but it needs to differentiate from Pumking more."

"i am a big fan of southern tier's pumking. i was pretty happy to see that the beer store still had a bit- and as i was leaving this warlock imperial stout caught my eye, so i grabbed it too. the color is black with a dark caramel brown when held up to the light. the smell is similar to pumking- pumpkin spices and vanilla. the smell is heavy and rich. the taste is thick with dark malts, vanilla and spices. @8.9%abv this one leaves a warm feeling in my belly. do i dare say i like this better than its lighter twin? my only regret is that i didnt buy more."

"This is definitely in my top 5 beers I have ever had. I don't like flavored stuff except for the fall season. This is the best tasting pumpkin beer I have ever had. It tastes like you're eating a mountain of heaven. Literally the only thing I would do to improve it would be to maybe make it a little ""thicker"" to coat the mouth a little bitter. But hot damn this is a gem."

"O: a nice dark take on a pumpkin ale - I'm probably not that partial to pumpkin stouts, but this one's as approachable and enjoyable as any. I'm also probably not a big ST fan (as their very popular double stouts, Choklat, Crème Brulee, Jahva, and Mokah aren't much to my liking :eek: (I know, I know...); but I really enjoy getting a Pumking every year and really dug their Oak-Aged Unearthly). So I get people saying this beer is ""unbalanced"" or ""too sweet"" - and, I guess it is rather like Pumking made with dark malts. I found it drier than most seem to have, and rather porter-like, as opposed to the Imperial stouts mentioned above, and basically enjoyable. I would probably buy one a year just like I do with Pumking, but I wouldn't miss it like I would Pumking (if it weren't around)."
""
""

"A solid beer, just as good as pumking IMO, nice to see southern tier coming out with a bunch of new beers."

"Overall a very nice combination of pumpkin and Imperial stout. Really enjoyed it."
""
""
"O: With a $9-$10 price tag I hesitated at first but once I gave it a try went back for more. This is one of the rare beers that hits high in almost all categories for me and worth the price if you can find some this season."
""
""
"O-definitely the best dark pumpkin beer I've had, even better than my pumking/choklat mix. One of the best pumpkin beers I've had in general, maybe even better than pumking itself. It truly has more pumpkin aspect than stout aspect, but the roasted flavors are there for sure."
""
"O - This was much better than I expected, love the flavor, the smell is good, just rather generic, especially against pumking, but I love the complex flavors in the taste, I look forward to having this again, and around this time each year."
"O: I could drink this every day, although is likely only available seasonally, I would recommend grabbing a couple on your way to a party with friends, several complex flavors make this beer easy to drink, smooth, and a great discussion piece."

"This is a nice seasonal offering, I prefer the tried and true Pumking but the roasted malts in this add a nice touch."

"Had this to put an end to the pumpkin beer craze this year, I was expecting a very boozy flavor but apparently the pumpkin and spices used in this imperial stout evened that all out. I was a big fan of Pumking and this one definitely ranks up there. Very smooth, very spicy. If you didn't like Pumking you will more than likely not like this."

"This is one of the more enjoyable pumpkin beers I can remember having tried. It just hits all the right notes for me. I hope there's more left at the store when I go back: this is what I get for refusing to engage pumpkin/fall beers until at least October, even though they start showing up on the shelves in August or September."

""

""
"It is way overpriced"
""
""
""
"As Imperial Stouts go, a style that lacks appeal to me and, thus, a style of which I have little knowledge, this is a good one. I would pack a couple bottles of this and take it to the mountains for a mountain weekend. It’s currently 77 degrees outside my Jacksonville abode so conditions aren’t just perfect for this one but maybe by Halloween I’ll be able to enjoy this one out on the porch in a light jacket. I’d buy this beer again, but next time it’ll be to share."

"Poured from a 750ml into a tulip glass. Ink black with a one finger head. Nose is pumpkin and spices. Taste of heavy spice up front, mixing beautifully into the malty flavor of the imperial stout. Light body for an imperial stout, but a lingering finish. Very good beer all around."
""

""
""
""

"Chocolate, coffee, vanilla, pumpkin pie, cinnamon and spice all contribute to a decadent flavor. Medium bodied and perfect carbonation with a dry spice bite. Overall, this is a great pumpkin stout / dark pumpkin ale. Worth the wait."

"Very good for a pumpkin ale. Better than most/any pumpkin stouts I've tried."
"O- Overall, my expectations were exceeded. This is a great pumpkin beer that is highly recommended. Time to go back and pick up a few more bottles."

""
""
"Overall, I’m unimpressed, really sick of Southern Tier cashing in on the Pumpking craze, I saw whole sale displays of this in Pittsburgh at 7.58 a bottle, Ohio I saw it from 8.99 to 10.99, and in the great state of WV I saw bottles for 6.49 a piece.  How can the retail fluctuate so much from state to state."
""
""
"Overall, this is a sweet and unique treat. More fun than good, but still good."
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark brown-to-black, with mahogany highlights and a creamy, dense, cream colored head that settles in to a solid quarter inch. Aromas of fresh baked pumpkin bread, with all of the highlights. Roasty notes, cinnamon and nutmeg spice, and a touch of bready character. Wow, this smells amazing. Flavors are roast forward, with a light, somewhat loose blending of chocolate, pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, bread, cream, and vanilla. Very sweet, and once again, just like fresh baked pumpkin bread, although the flavor profiles come across a little bit more subtle than the aromas. Thin, dry bodied, with a roasted, bitter profile blending with a creamy sweetness into the aftertaste. Dry, slightly lingering spice character into a slow settling finish. Easy drinker with true pumpkin flavors. This is a good beer. Might be picking up more to do a ""pumpkin keg"" for an upcoming Halloween party."
""
"Overall definetly would rather have a Pumking over this. With muted spices and a not very thick stout it was worth a try. Kind of glad I picked a $4.50 pint at Allegheny six packs over a bomber which runs around 12-14 bucks around here."

"Long-time fan of the Pumking, I did not think Southern Tier could make a better pumpkin ale. Boy was I wrong. Warlock is dark deliciousness. I have had both draft Warlock and bottled, I prefer draft. Perfectly spiced with a very satisfying mouth feel, this beer just makes you want to order another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: There are some light hints of the alcohol that makes this beer more of a sipper but it has some of the most intense pumpkin flavors of any of the fall beers that I have gotten this year (nice rich flavors and aromas of roasted pumpkin are upfront in this beer). Definitely enjoyable but feels more like a porter than a stout. I would get another of these."
""
"O: This was pretty good for anything with the word ""pumpkin"" in the description. It would definitely be in my top five pumpkin-containing beers."
"This offering is very drinkable for such a high ABV beer and VERY tasty. Rating this baby is a bit of a head scratcher, however. As a pumpkin ale, I actually prefer it to Pumking (which I rate very highly) because it has all the PK flavors with a more hearty body. However, as a stout (especially as an imperial stout), it falls short."
"Final Thoughts: I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the biggest fan of Pumking, but I have the utmost respect for Southern Tier when it comes to imperial stouts and their Black Water series. I don't know what the recipe for Warlock is but it tastes like a post-fermentation mix of pumpkin and a milk stout. That just so happens to be recipe for success in this brew. This would pair well with most fall season fair, hearty meat dishes, or dessert. Hell, it could replace a dessert course. Would I drink it again? Yes, looking forward to its next release."
""
""

""

""
""
"O- If you are lucky enough to stumble upon this, pick it up!"
""
""

"Overall: A good experiment, and one that I really enjoy (and I imagine folks who enjoy Pumking as much as I do will probably say the same thing), though if this experiment with Pumking keeps happening, I'd go bigger, darker, and experiment more with it. I may buy another bottle or two if it's still around in the upcoming weeks. Not groundbreaking, but again, a pretty cool experiment, and though it doesn't change this into an entirely different beer, it brings out some different qualities and nuances that are always welcomed when you try and tweak a very solid beer in any respect, more often than not, that is."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle from Tipples. Pours a dark brown with creamy off white head. Aroma is big nutmeg, cinnamon, roast, some nutty aroma. Pretty much smells like Pumking. Flavor is heavy spice with the nutmeg and cinnamon, but really nicely finished with a creamy sweet whipped cream pumpkin flavor. Creamy medium-heavy mouthfeel with medium highish carbonation. Lingering vanilla cream and nutmeg on the palate. I love the creamy mouthfeel and whipped cream flavor going on, but the nutmeg just cuts through this way too hard. I have the same issue with Pumking--who wants to drink liquid nutmeg? I don't get it."

"Overall/Comments: Simply one of the most tasty better overall beers that I have ever had and the best pumpkin beer I have had. Get this and then get more if you can find it! Classified as an American Double/Imperial Stout @ 8.6% ABV. Consumed 10/3/2013."
""
"It's Pumking with some dark malts. It doesn't work quite as well, but it's good."
"This is interesting. Pumpkin stouts are challenging. The roast and chocolate notes are nice here, but they don't quite meld with the pumpkin and spice flavors. This basically tastes like Pumking with some chocolate malts thrown in. It almost works very well though, better than some other pumpkin stouts."

"VERY GOOD; GRAB A BOTTLE!"

"I like it. The roasty bitterness is a welcome addition to that familiar sweet imperial pumpkin base. Not the best stout I've had from Southern Tier but it's a few steps in the right direction for the Blackwater Series after Plum Noir. I'll be certain to enjoy this more while it's available."
"Got a growler poured from draft. Poured into a duvel tulip. Dark black and opaque with a decent white head that fades to nothing. Aroma is toffee and butter with mild pumpkin pie spice in the background. A sip starts off sweet, fills out to a very caramel sweet flavor with background cinnamon and ginger. Finishes sweet with a decent kick of bitterness and roastiness. Medium full in body with subdued carbonation. Overall a nice dessert beer. A bit on the sweet side for me, as are most of Southern Tier's beers, but the roast in this one makes it more drinkable for me than the rest of their lineup."

"O: This beer is remarkably similar to Pumking, except for the dark malt base. Unfortunately it also suffers from the same shortcomings as Pumking. The sharp hop bitterness is out of place and the body leaves something to be desired. Spicing is far over the top. These issues make the drinkability suffer as a result. The nose is great, but the rest of the drinking experience falls a little short for me. This will still sell just as well as Pumking does though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the taste is rich but misses the mark for me. It does taste like pumpkin mixed with a cream stout, but it's not fantastic. I don't think I could make a night of this beer. I could make a night of the Créme Brûlée Stout, however, but not this one."
"A worthy sequel to Pumking for the winter months."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One hell of a spicy pumpkin stout. A bit unbalanced, it's like a mix of pumking and choklat but they used 80% pumking by accident. Super, super heavy pumpkin pie spices. Even get a bit of creaminess like whipped cream I swear. Pretty good."

"Pours dark brown with a single foam white head. Smells a lot like pumpkin. Vanilla, some coffee, cinnamon. Taste is a lot like the smell, tons of creamy pumpkin, vanilla, coffee, cinnamon, spices, some sweetness, slightly bitter finish. Like a creamy roasty pumpking. Great desert beer for fall. Wish it was a little thicker but a nice new beer"

"Conclusion: Warlock..it's pumking's sinister brother. It's ephemeral stuff for those that love a delicious pumpkin ale. It shares DNA but somewhere got toasted and roasted, and a bit angry. Good stuff."
"Overall – A rather nice take of a dark pumpkin beer, with a decent blend of pumpkin and stout tastes. It’s good, but not quite as enjoyable as the original pumking as it lacks some balance with the roasted flavors never really melding well with the spiced pumpkin."
""
""
""
"O - A delicious beer that is very rich. One bomber is plenty, anything beyond that is going to get cloying but that is to be expected with a beer like this. If you like Pumpking and you like stouts, you will love this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I have been anticipating this beer for a while. I really enjoyed the balance between the typical sweet pumpkin flavors and the roasty stout qualities. It smells absolutely delicious. This is now among my favorite pumpkin beers. Southern Tier knows its way around a pumpkin brew."
""
""
"Pours a cola brown with some light passage at the edges, minimal head. The nose is very similar to pumking. Heavy graham cracker, pumpkin spice, some chocolate, not a whole lot of roast or stout quality to speak of. Taste is very pumpkin and spice forward with some sweet chocolate at the back. Not nearly as much stout quality as I was hoping for, a touch of bitterness towards the end. Mouthfeel is thin for style with mellow carbonation. Overall, quite tasty but I was hoping for more robust chocolatey flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is now one of my favorite pumpkin beers. Really packs in the flavor with the result of a very nicely balanced beer. Sure there is lots of spice, so if you thats your thing certainly check this one out"
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-I really enjoyed this beer. It's a cool take on the Pumpkin style. We'll worth a try. I loved Pumking and this one is damn good too."
""
""

"O - I've always been a fanboy of Southern Tier's stouts, and this one is no different. Incredible flavor and texture, the chocolate and pumpkin make for a great experience, and anybody who loves dark beers, or stouts, or pumpkin beers, or beer in general should definitely try this. Southern Tier has done it again!"
""
""
"Creamed corn brew. This does not sit well with me. Too much going on. Pumpkin, roast, spice, smoke, malt and corn sweetness. Reminds me of when I begged my wife to bake a chocolate flan. She always baked the most outstanding custard flan, but I wanted chocolate. It was horrible to say the least. So with this Warlock, I thought, I would love an Imperial stout pumpkin and it ain't working. I'm going to stick with Pumpking. This Warlock is a pass for me."

"Pours black with a light, almost purplish head that slowly slides down the glass. It smells heavily of pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices, particularly nutmeg, with a touch of cream cheese frosting. The taste is fantastic, featuring dark malt and a solid pumpkin flavor. The spices are less prominent in the taste, though there is a touch of spice in the finish. Feel is medium-heavy with light carbonation and just a bit of bite. The alcohol is present and warming, but it doesn't feel hot or boozy."

"O - A stout that has all the flavors and smells of Pumking.  I prefer this to Pumking, because I find the stout offers a subtle roast bite in the taste.  That said, I find the effect of creating a pie in a glass is not enough to sustain me through a whole bottle happily.  Nevertheless, the beer decent, and the trick of melding the beer to a mild stout offers a nice feel and a decent taste.  Very good, but just shy of great."

"WARLOCK... when I saw this in my local store I was ecstatic. I am a big fan of Pumking, Creme Brulee, 2x Stout, and so forth. Could this be a the best blend of imperial stout and premium pumpkin beer bottled? The answer is... sort of. As a spoiler for this entire review I will come right out and say, like many others have, that this tastes a lot like standard Pumking. I'd love to do a side-by-side next time. But anyway, on with the review. The color is a dark, oily brown, with an initial bubbly tan head, that subsides somewhat quickly. The aroma is incredible, with warm oatmeal, cookies, pumpkin pie and vanilla icing, and notable spices. The taste is very very similar to the aroma. It's a tad more roasty than the scents let on, but not as much as say, if you floated some pumpkin ale on top of Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. The feel is moderate and somewhat warming. The finish actually has more hops wrapped up in it than the original Pumking. It's pleasantly bitter, having traces of dark chocolates and complex hop flavors. This is precisely the part that makes it an exceptional beer in it's own right. Don't hesitate to grab it off the shelf."
"Borderline an imperial stout, but not as bad as I was expecting. Worth a try at least once."

"I was surprised how similar to Pumking this beer was, especially considering how dark it poured. Stout qualities came out a little more so in the nose than taste with chocolatey roast on the back end with a touch of cinnamon. Add that to the standard Pumking, with a richer, more substantial mouthfeel and you get Warlock."

"The big body is here, and it's robust. It's got just a little carbonation, right for a big beer, and a solid smoothness."
"Seems a bit gimmicky. Would like more imperial stout and less vanilla, spice, and sweetness. The combination didn't work as well as I had hoped. Could not get through the entire bottle."

"Overall, I'm not a fan of pumpkin beers or flavored beers in general, but it is nice that this one uses real pumpkin, and it's not bad. Probably because it's a stout first, and a pumpkin beer second."

"This thing just made me sick to my stomach. I'm really glad I shared half of this bomber with my friend because I wouldn't have made it through it otherwise. This may sound harsh but it tasted like they brewed a generic and uninteresting imperial stout and sprayed pumpkin perfume into it. I really don't think a dark and roasty beer pairs well with a sweet, almost pumpkin pie taste. Just a little too many flavors battling against each other in this one. I know a lot of people will enjoy this, but it's just not for me. Personally, I would stick with Pumpking."

"No? Ok imagine drinking a slice of pumpkin pie with just a Little bit of chocolate syrup drizzled on top. Yeah, it's like that."

"O: A very nice blend of Pumking and stout. It gives Pumking another depth of flavor and complexity and isn't nearly as (possibly) cloying as Pumking can get. Quite easy to drink for an 8.6% stout. Definitely get some if you enjoy Pumking and stouts"

"Overall- Maybe the best pumpkin beer I've had, and I'm usually not a big pumpkin fan. Even though its sweet the roast really helps to balance it out. Worth trying."

"Thankfully the flavor is more of a mix of pumkin and stout notes. Dry and roasted with a robust dark malt presence that's countered by sweeter malts and strong pumkin pie flavors on the back end. Slightly smokey with burnt sugar and deeply roasted malt but its not acrid or harsh at all. Hints of gourmet coffee, burnt toast, bittersweet dark chocolate and oatmeal followed by sweeter chocolate flavor, toffee and nut before a strong pumpkin ale flavor in the finish. Spicy and sweet with ginger, clove, cinnamon and nutmeg along with pumpkin purée/pie filling, toasted pumpkin seeds and vanilla. Nicely balanced and whereas the aroma felt like a pumpkin beer with subtle stout character, the flavor is more stout-like with lingering pumpkin pie sweetness. ABV is excellently masked, resulting in another dangerously drinkable entry in the Backwater series."

"I dunno. To me this beer is mis-labeled. Instead of Imperial Stout with Pumpkins & Natural Flavor, it should be the other way around; Imperial Pumpkin Beer with Natural Flavor brewed with Strong Stout. The spicy pumpkin totally dominates the stout. Poured this at a good temperature with a smallish light tan, creamy head that quickly settled and a little lace. Color is a very dark, clear garnet brown with a few bubble trails. Aroma is full on spicy pumpkin, with some chocolate chip cookie in the background. Flavor's like nose; the stout is barely discernible, mostly sweet with a hint of bitter and tang. Body reflects the dominate sweetness which slightly clashes with the bitter leaving some high points that aren't entirely pleasant. Finish is like flavor, slight medicine in the aftertaste and longish. My rating for would have been much higher but for the difference in label and experience. It's really a tasty dessert beer. But even in the good chocolate stouts, the stout is the strong backbone."

"Pours into a goblet a deep cola color with a half finger light beige head that left a broken ring of lace as it settled quickly.Wow the most aromatic pumpkin infused beer I have come across,roasted pumpkin,cardamom,and raw leafy hops stand out most,add vanilla and graham crackers and you have a big complex nose.Flavor of roasted pumpkin and vanilla/spices with some roast,like a pumpkin latte,the raw hops are still playing a big role.What a cool beer,it's a brash pumpkin stout with a real hop profile with alot of malty richness.Top notch."

"A Pumking Stout? It seems so obvious, yet where has it been? This is a wonderful beer (if you like Pumking). If you don't like Pumking, I don't believe you should even bother with this. If you do like Pumking and buy at least one bottle of it every year (as I do), then this is not one you want to pass up."
"Warlock is a delicious beer that showcases well the taste of Pumking but also introduces the dryness of dark grain and the dessert-like presence of chocolate. Though the intent is spot-on, its deliver is slightly lacking of ideal- but not by far!"

"If you love Pumking, chances are that you will love this. If you don't like Pumking, then you might not like this. My only beef is that I wish there was more chocolate notes, but they're still there. It's almost too close to Pumking, but is that really a bad thing? I'd rather just grab a Pumking instead, but this is still an awesome beer. Extremely enjoyable brew. Great fall beer."
