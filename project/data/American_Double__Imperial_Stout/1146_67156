4.2,2.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 12/7/2012. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, toast, molasses, dark bread, light coffee, raisin, plum, fig, light licorice, and roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, cocoa nib, and dark fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of big milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, toast, molasses, dark bread, light coffee, raisin, plum, fig, light licorice, and roast/toasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, toast, molasses, dark bread, light coffee, raisin, plum, fig, light licorice, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, cocoa nib, and dark fruit flavors; with a solid roasted bitterness/sweetness balance. Flavor leans much more towards sweet malt notes, but never gets cloying. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome imperial stout. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, cocoa nib, and dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 21, 2015"

Aroma is a nice blend of roasty and earthy malts, and bitter sweet chocolate.  Taste is much like the aroma: dark malts and chocolate; rich and quite delicious.  This beer coats your mouth and is a little silty.  A little bit of alcohol burn though.","mverity","Jan 09, 2015"

Aroma is sweet with a bit of mild chocolate. A little booze. Taste is nice -- sweet & chocolatey up front. A bit boozy on the sides. Dark fruit flavors prominent. There's a bit of an unfortunate tootsie-roll flavor, which I've found to be common with chocolate beers. The finish is surprisingly bitter, perhaps from a mixture of chocolate, roasted malt, and booze. But it isn't overpowering. Mouthfeel is rather full. Carbonation still present after 3+ years in the bottle. Overall a yummy stout and the addition of chocolate complements the roasted malt nicely, making it a bit more complex. I've been told the original release of Big John was particularly amazing, though I came away slightly underwhelmed.","foobula","Beers"

Smell is cocoa dominant with coffee and some jammy fruits as the beer begins to warm. Taste follows the nose fairly well and lots of cocoa, some sweet fruits and bitter espresso towards the end. Overall a very good imperial stout from the makers of BCBS.","hops202","0"

4.21,3.2,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Pours black and viscous with no head; some clumpy lacing on the glass. Smells of raw tangy, sweet cocao bean fresh from the pod, vanilla, dark jammy fruit like cherry and fig, molasses, roasty malts and even a little coffee. Quite nice. The flavor is jammy fruit which is a bit tangy and bright, just a touch of cocao, vanilla, brown sugar, sweet, roasty malt and a balanced bitterness on the finish. The booze is a bit imposing from start to finish but doesn't take away too much from the flavor. The mouthfeel is chewy and syrupy with a tingly effervescent carbonation. There is more carbonation than bourbon county stout. Overall this is rather delicious. I think the jammy fruit flavors are a bit excessive and the booze is a little much. But otherwise very well done as a sweet dessert stout.","brianmandell","Mar 05, 2014"

Gathered a nice 1/2 inch brown head which dissipated quickly into a small bit of foam around the edge - which subsequently left nice delicate sexy lacing with each sip. Taste is rich strong black. The cacao nibs definitely come through in a 75% dark chocolate taste - not overpowering and not too dark - which is good. 14.5% ABV is taste-able and appropriate for this this big of a beer. Overall, a frigging great beer that gets better as it approaches room temperature, but also tastes great right out of the 'frig.","hopley","Feb 28, 2014"

4.14,1.5,5,3.5,4.25,4,4.5,"Overall - Good stuff! It's as it says an Imperial Stout with Cacao Nibs. With the exception of glumatic flavors (which are probably shaved off by the cacao addition), it tastes like what it says. It's a combination of dark roast coffee, cacao, and malty sweetness. Powerfully sweet upfront with bitterness from the roasty/char of the dark roast coffee flavors, dark chocolate dryness, and a pretty swift alcohol kick at the end. Aftertaste is predominantly the coffee. If you like Ten Fidy or Chocolate Yeti, I think its one of the sweeter examples, but definitely right in that neighborhood.","MudDrinker","Jan 26, 2014"

Aroma of chocolate and licorice, maybe some sweet vanilla notes and hints of roast. Flavor is big sweet dark fruits, black currants, light anise, molasses, and with an extra kick of milk chocolate. Finishes with a nice bitter and lingering bittersweet chocolate. Feel a bit of heat on this too. Mouthfeel is perfect, thick and velvety but with a bit a carbonation to balance. Nice beer!","BMMillsy","Aug 29, 2013"

Taste is similar, with a heavy sticky sweetness (with an emphasis on those chocolate flavors) that is tempered a bit by the burnt feel of the roast and whatever hop bitterness is left over. Alcohol flavors amp that sweetness up even more. Mouthfeel is full and chewy with a bit of a prickle to it. While the the alcohol is heavy flavorwise, the heat is at least mostly kept in check. This was good for a big Stout, with thick chewy flavors and a warming alcohol presence. This is a big beer indeed.","Kegatron","Jun 02, 2013"

Smell immediately reminds me of a strong dark belgian - dark fruits, prune, raisin, fig. Not much roast at all but a little bit of dark, bitter chocolate on the nose. Taste follows the nose very closely. Very flavorful with the same dark fruits but really not too much chocolate. Perhaps a little bit of that dark bitter chocolate, but it kind of gets lost in the mix. A bit of ashen taste way back on the finish. Hop bitterness on the finish and just a bit of alcohol, but its very well hidden for 11.5% Feels moderately heavy on the tongue with very low to medium carbonation. I enjoyed this beer, but it was really not what I was expecting as an "Imperial Stout with Cacao Nibs." Not in a hurry to get it again.","Thurgoft","Apr 01, 2013"

It got really close to chocolate beer milkshake status. I wasn't entirely sure when I smelled the dark fruit, but it worked alright and wasn't overpowering.

A solid 1-1/2-finger mocha head sits on top. Dark fruity chocolate malt aroma pours out from the head as you inhale. Definite chocolate notes peek through. First sip, tons of chocolate with some roastiness backing it up. Delicious. No sign of the 11.5% ABV whatsoever. Creamy mouthfeel that's off the charts. Overall, one of the best Impy Stouts I've ever had. Deserves all the praise it gets, and then some. A bit pricey, but worthy nonetheless. To me, this is an extremely similar recipe to their Bourbon County Stout, except without the bourbon aging and vanilla flavors. Still a ridiculously solid brew.","DrewV","Feb 24, 2013"

What is surprising, however, is the relative lack of chocolate notes; in fact, for a beer with cacao nibs, there’s almost no chocolate in here at all; instead, it seems to simply blend with the molasses, fig, and bourbon notes, disappearing largely into the background. Did the label not say “with cacao nibs added,” I would have assumed I was drinking a standard Imperial Stout. The alcoholic kick is also a bit heavy, filling the nasal cavities with whiskey vapors. Still, it’s worth a try for fans of the style.","jondeelee","0"

Not sweet but more of a bitter dark chocolate. Earthy with hints of smoke. The taste is of hot cocoa mix and chocolate syrup. Nice alcohol presence. Earth and bitter dark chocolate at the finish. Very chocolatey. Heavy, syrupy mouthfeel that goes well with the flavors. Pretty drinkable considering the high Abv and the amount of chocolate flavor but I did down a bottle of water with this one. I think I may like this one better than Night Stalker. Overall, solid beer worth grabbing again.","PicoPapa","Jan 29, 2013"

Big malt nose with the requisite Imperial Stout aromas of roasted chocolatey/burnt coffee. Plummy dark fruits on the tongue with roasted malts, some not-over-the-top hoppiness and an alcohol burn at the end. Not a bit of the cocoa nibs talked about on the label but good all the same. Finishes long and strong, more dark fruit ending on a bitter note. Bottled on 12/07/12 and would benefit from some careful cellaring but I can't fault it for being sampled in its younger state.

With Big John, the flavors I love were present with a fairly fresh bottle (only a few months old). I didn't pick up much cocoa in the taste or smell like the marketing tells me that I should. But as I just said, all of the other flavors that I love were there and this beer was damn smooth as it went down pretty easy. It essentially tasted like a Bourbon County Stout without the bourbon.

Overall I enjoyed this beer however I think the abv should have been dulled down a bit. Otherwise it was very good.","jaasen64","Aug 13, 2012"

Some nice scents in there, but they just seem out of whack and don't compliment each other as much as I would hope. Flavor brings out some dried cherry, syrupy sugars (marshmallow?), apple, caramel, and cocoa nibs. Strange and unassuming, but not too shabby. Mouthfeel is overly sticky and sweet, with a syrupy texture and dry finish. Overall, I was a bit disappointed in this one; perhaps a case of high-hopes induced by the attention this one received, but I'm not positive that's the case.

Slightly bitter with some piny hops and deeply roasted dark malts. Hints of dark chocolate, coffee bean, oatmeal and burnt toast but it never becomes to acrid because the sweet cocoa comes in and balances things out. The cocoa flavor is prominent and without it this beer could have been an overly roasted booze bomb. As it is, this is a well balanced, flavorful beer that is dangerously drinkable.

I like chocolate/cocoa nibs in brews, I really do. But what I don't like is an overpowering amount of sweetness and chocolate and a beer that literally takes me forever to finish and that's only the first half of the bomber...Yikes.

4.2,2.9,4,4,4.5,4,4," This stout has some big cocoa and herbal hop flavors with slight spice nuance. The taste of hops and dark malt with mild burnt note and mildly bitter cocoa nib gives some complexity with a mild coffee-like roastiness with gentle peppery heat of alcohol with some mild sweetness from the caramel malt. Overall this is a very high quality stout, I really like the bitter cocoa essence of the nibs, yet the heat of the high alcohol holds its drinkability back a tinge. I found it to be stellar with just an intense amount of roastiness.","Slatetank","Nov 05, 2011"
4.05,-0.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours super black and oily with almost zero head. Smells of dark roast and chocolate. The taste is great - I think if I never had BCBS or if it wasn't from Goose Island (with such great expectations) this thing would generally get top reviews. The first drink just coats the mouth with intense bitter chocolate, vanilla and roast flavors, just like the nose. The chocolate fades as the mouth gets used to it after a few swigs. At this point the boozy sweet roast takes the lead. Here is where it most tastes like BCBS and if it weren't for the finish leaving me hanging looking for a bourbon kick to end the flavor, I'd swear I was drinking that. However, I'm left wanting that kick since it's what rounds out BCBS so much and takes it to the next level. If I hadn't ever had BCBS I'd be raving over this beer - as it is - it's great, not mind-blowing, but I want the bourbon.","plumcrazyfx","Nov 04, 2011"
3.93,-3.7,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"O: This wasn't a particularly expensive beer, so overall, I enjoyed my session with this one. Lighten up people.... this isn't BCBS and doesn't claim to be...","Chaney","Oct 30, 2011"
4.13,1.2,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"O - This has really good drinkability. It goes down smooth and the flavor is really nice. It is a sipper of course, but it is still hard to put down. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer, and I think it is a really good imperial stout. If you like a lot of chocolate flavor in your stouts, try it. If you aren't the biggest fan of chocolate in your stouts, just give it a shot anyways.","JizackFH","Oct 23, 2011"
3.9,-4.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"This is a full bodied brew with a light amount of carbonation. Very bold and aggressive with the alcohol heat but it makes for a solid sipper on a cold night. I found the licorice incorporation to be more bold than the listed cocao nib inclusion. The chocolate really only makes itself known lightly in the background of the aftertaste. Regardless, this was an interesting experience and worth a try if you have the chance. My vote goes to bourbon county as being my favorite offering they put out.","stakem","Oct 17, 2011"

The cough-syrup-like flavor at the end was also a bit of a let-down. I'd be curious to see what a bottle of this would taste like after a bit of time in the cellar...","mdvatab","Sep 16, 2011"
4.02,-1.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"A bomber on hand for the 2011 Brass Hat Brew Fest in Watertown, CT yielded an ominously dark brown colored brew, semi-opaque with a modest ring of tan bubbles on top and minimal signs of lacing. The aroma brings sweet bourbon malt with almost flowery-perfume-like chocolate hints. The mouth finds a cloying malt sweetness with dark chocolate syrup that suggests some fermenting cherries and figs. There is also a bit of an herbal hop brightness over the top and finish. It's a definite heavy bodied brew in my book, with a medium-light velvety smoothness. Not a great candidate for sessioning but tasty and a worthwhile venture for the sweet tooth that enjoys a touch of booziness with his chocolate.","Durge","Beers"

There is a sweet sticky feeling in the moth after each sip, and the aftertaste is sweet with a bit of bitterness from the roasted malt. Definitely a chewy Imperial Stout. A good beer overall. I'm just glad it wasn't any sweeter, or it would have been too much for me.","hardy008","Sep 07, 2011"
4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a rich, deep and dark brown with thin cap of dense brown bubbles, gone quickly but leaving a ring of active bubbles. Scent is huge... notes of chocolate, roast and booze dominate with notes of dark fruit and anise like spice. Taste starts out big and bold with heavy roast, chocolate, booze and touches of sweet cream and dark fruit, but the finish becomes somewhat lifeless with dry and powdery cacao nibs taking over. Full bodied, coating with a touch too high carbonation, overall lightly dry on the palate. Overall this beer was a good, strong Imperial Stout but it seemed like it wanted to be big for the sake of being being, without too much effort put into complexity, layers or subtle touches found in some other big stouts.","rfgetz","Sep 06, 2011"

I don't know what I think of them as a company now that they're owned by Anheuser Busch, nor do I know if they'll be able to keep their quality up in the coming years... but at present, these guys are some of the best at crafting big, complex, malty beers.

2.33,-42.9,4.5,1.5,2.5,3,2,"Thankfully, the flavor profile turns out to be pretty decent. Most thankworthy is the absence of the catsup (where the hell did that smell come from?). A fair amount of artificial grape remains, but a host of chocolate flavors join forces to suppress it. Semisweet, milk, Yoohoo, we seem to have all the chocolate bases covered. Very light notes of espresso and burnt malt; a bigger dose of the dark stuff would go a long way toward improving this brew. The thick, smooth mouthfeel would be more impressive if it wasn't helping the near-overwhelming sweetness and booziness to linger way past the worn-out-their-welcome point. Not something I'd care to revisit.","PDXHops","Aug 29, 2011"

It's a sipper with loads of malt character. The cocoa nibs really enhance the experience. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very good double stout.

The nose offers more general roast character than any specific nuance of chocolate or cocoa. The aroma is not off-putting, but it is quite one-dimensional, even if that dimension is pleasant. The flavor, on the other hand, is bordering on acrid in its roastiness; even less nuance is to be found here. The beer is silky and rich-feeling on the palate, which covers up for a lot of the overly burnt flavor. Overall this is an underwhelming brew.","ktrillionaire","Jul 10, 2011"

People complain about the booze in this beer, but to be honest, the booze added to this beer. It gave it multiple layers, added depth, and it wasn't hot at all.

Has a LOT of burnt, roasty characters in the flavor. Very bitter coffee on the end. Sweetness is downplayed a lot except for the first taste. On the second drink I really do get a lot of creamy dark chocolate that ventures closer to milk chocolate territory. Twist in some dark fruit and there you have it. Mouthfeel is creamy and chewy as anything I ever had. It is very smooth and rich. But yikes this beer is HOT on the throat! Almost feels like a shot of whiskey was dropped in it. Pretty good brew that most likely needs some time to lay down and chill a bit. I say hold off for now.","generalnotsew","Jul 05, 2011"

The nose is a straight up dark chocolate bomb. For the life of me I can't find a suggestion of any aroma that doesn't scream chocolate. The nose is good, but it's a one trick pony, and that keeps it from being truly great. There's a mild bit of roast that shows up in the flavor, and that keeps things interesting, but overall the beer is just about as chocolate heavy on my palate as it is in the nose. That roast does liven things up a little bit, which is only to the beer's credit, but god damn if it still isn't easily the most chocolaty beer I've ever had. The body is full and quite rich, though restrained enough that that and the quiet, yet present carbonation keep the beer from turning into chocolate syrup in my glass. I'm surprised that I will have scored Nightstalker higher than Big John, as I definitely prefer the cocoa nib treatment of the BCS base beer, but I guess I have to chalk that up to refining my palate and becoming more particular in my scoring over time. Bottom line is that Big John is a great beer, and one that I hope becomes a regular part of Goose Island's lineup.","axeman9182","Jun 26, 2011"

Complex smell, with aroma of chocolate, vanilla, caramel, wimpy coffee, banana, and oatmeal. The taste is much like the smell reveals, with flavors of semi sweet chocolate, molasses, vanilla, caramel, watered down French roast coffee, banana, and something close to whole wheat bread. Good mouthfeel, it is full, and creamy, but lacks just a little in zing, with a bit of drying in the back of my throat, will I guess that would be expected with the amount of alcohol. This beer has a good taste and a wonderful warming effect from the massive amount of alcohol in this bomber. I would have another, but I can't find my butt with both hands.

Flavor is muted by the alcohol, but I am getting some dark chocolate, roasted malt, sweet dark fruits (raisins ands figs), and molasses. Salty soy-sauce comes through in the finish in a slightly off-putting fashion. Alcohol creates a warming sensation as it goes down. Sliky, creamy mouthfeel with little carbonation. This stout is really on the edge of being too cloyingly sweet. Average stout at best. Maybe another few months would have done this beer some good.","muttyd","May 12, 2011"

I was looking to see if I could taste a touch of Augustus Gloop because there is seriously a chocolate river in my glass.

Aroma is plenty of chocolate gentle roastiness, and a slight sting of alcohol in the nostrils, but I like boozy beers. The taste is a bit a hot, but it's not overwhelming. Booziness is front and center along with bitter baker's chocolate, and lots of graininess. Roast isn't as in-depth as I would typically like from an imperial stout, but I think this was done on purpose to let the chocolate really come out, which is definitely there in good supply. Mouthfeel is nearly full with an above average carbonation for the style, but plenty of swirling in the Duvel tulip toned it down a bit and it became nice and creamy, although the alcohol is definitely noticeable. This is definitely a tasty beer, but I think it needs about 6 months on it to mellow out the rough edges from the cocoa nibs, and I'll look forward to trying my other bottle in the fall.","KeefD","Apr 26, 2011"

Chocolate is the most prevalent, definitely notice the cocoa. Flavor is a bit of a letdown. There's a bit too much booze and the chocolate doesn't come through as well. Mild roast and also some dark fruit aspects that I didn't particularly care for. Body is medium to full with good carbonation. Pretty good overall, but doesn't live up to their other stouts.","Thorpe429","Apr 19, 2011"
4.2,2.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall this exceeded expectations. Im not the biggest stout guy but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Glad I have a bottle of this to lay down to smooth out the edges.","BARFLYB","Beers"
4.3,5.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O- I'm all about this brew. Huge flavors that blend perfectly and make for a superb ride. Big enough to cure what ales you but easy enough to down a big ole glass. Well done GI hope you can keep it up with the new owners.","oglmcdgl","0"
3.33,-18.4,4.5,4,3,4,2.5,"D- too sweet for me. im glad i wasnt a glutton with this and left a couple on the shelf. i wouldnt enjoy having them. i liked nightstalker and the classic bourbon county much more than this. the bottle was much too large for just me.","jwinship83","Apr 18, 2011"
4.42,8.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"(O) Really good. I love it. I think that since its fresh, the taste is still really sweet and chocolaty, but with some time on it I think the flavors will blend and mellow a bit more and will turn out to be still a great beer.","cjacobsen","Apr 18, 2011"
4.38,7.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Smooth, thick mouthfeel that goes down easy. Only the smallest notice of the alcohol. I think this will age very well. Another superior stout from Goose Island.","FanofHefe","Apr 17, 2011"
4.53,11,4.5,4,5,4,4.5,"D-An amazing beer. The alcohol is not present, a sipper but a great sipper at that. I love this beer, one the best I've ever had.","rlee1390","Apr 17, 2011"
4.87,19.4,4.5,5,5,4,5,"Drinkability:This is a fantastic brew when fresh, and I really hope that the hot alcohol bite lessens as the beer ages. The chocolate flavors make this a great sipping dessert beer.","fear025","Apr 17, 2011"
4.35,6.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O) What surprised me here is the overall drinkability of this which I thought was pretty easy given the ABV. Not sure what aging would do to this (but hopefully I'll find out!). Really enjoyed this....this would have been a great holiday release!","jimmy82063","Apr 17, 2011"
4.23,3.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"O- It's a good brew, I just wish it were more available. I have yet to try a BCBS of any kind, and I have not cracked open the bottle of night stalker I have in my fridge, but if the quality goes up from here, then I can't wait to try them all!","CMB2012","Apr 16, 2011"
4.33,6.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall this is another hit by GI. While its a little on the sweet side and I wish it started with some more bourbon flavor its a great beer. I hope I can get this for awhile longer because I would like to age some.","UMNbeerhunter","Apr 16, 2011"
4.55,11.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"O: This beer is great. It reminded me of Ten Fidy, but this one has a great bourbon twist on it.","BrewCrew2010","Apr 16, 2011"
3.96,-2.9,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"A very pleasant chocolate stout, but lacking somewhat in cohesion, Big John is worth a go. However, I'd place it behind Night Stalker and all members of the BCBS family in the Goose imperial stout sweepstakes.","AJacob81","Apr 15, 2011"
4.45,9.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours thick with light toffee colored head. Strong aromas of chocolate and coffee. Smooth and sweet at first, then settles into a subtle, pleasing bitterness. You can taste the malt, not at all boozy, and ends with a subtle linger of flavor at the back of the palate. In my opinion an excellent beer.","1noa","Apr 15, 2011"
3.58,-12.3,5,2,4,4,4,"Otherwise, an exceptional imperial stout.","flocculate","Apr 15, 2011"
4.62,13.2,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"O: Delicious and potent. Definitely a sipper, it’s very strong in both flavor and alcohol content.","WankelEngine","Apr 14, 2011"
3.8,-6.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"A solid effort that comes up a bit short when compared with some of Goose Island's other epic big stouts. Solid, but a bit flawed flavors and construction with a bit of alcohol heat.","pdoran10","Apr 14, 2011"
4.28,4.9,5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"O: Yet another fine rendition on the Bourbon County theme, minus the bourbon and plus the chocolate. It's a fine alternative if you ever get sick of whiskey beers but still want an excellent all around imperial stout with more than simple malt complexity. Give this some age, though, perhaps a year, and it'll be even better.","wschmit","Apr 13, 2011"
4.3,5.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Of the cocoa nibbed beers that I have had, this is thicker than any of them. Similar in taste to Teddy Bear kisses which was great, this has a much thicker body and many more roasted / smoked flavors in it. Neither are overdone and this is another great job by GI. Light Carbonation which is about right for the style","alpinebryant","Apr 13, 2011"
4.07,-0.2,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"O: Well this is yet another delicious variant of the BCS base beer. This one doesn't have as much character as the rest, but is still incredibly delicious.","homebrew311","Apr 08, 2011"
4.89,19.9,4,5,5,4.5,5,"Overall im a huge fan, have 4 bottles left, ill drink two and save two. I hope this will get better with age, im sure it will","Davidpgibbons","Apr 08, 2011"
3.75,-8.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"EDIT: It's about an hour later and the beer was warmed up to room temperature. I'm enjoying it much more this way. The sweetness seems a bit cut down and the individual chocolate flavor seems to pop. This is as much as a sipper as fresh BCS but I'm enjoying the second half of the bomber MUCH more than the first. I've bumped up a few of the scores to match.","weatherdog","Apr 07, 2011"
4.2,2.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"O- A pretty damn good stout, considerably better than Night Stalker in my opinion. Definitely worth drinking again.","WillCarrera","Apr 07, 2011"
3.33,-18.4,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Good beer, worth getting some bottles of, one of the better chocolate forward beers i've had.","ChadQuest","Apr 05, 2011"
4.37,7.1,4.5,5,4,4,4.5,"O- Overall thought it was a very good beer and think it would only get better with age lettin more cacao come through on the palate... will definitely be gettin a couple more to put away for a year or two to see if it improves.","wesside89","Mar 28, 2011"
4.35,6.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, very interesting and tasty to say the least. However, this Imperial Stout demands age on it. The heat should tone down and bring out more of those chocolate nib flavors with some time on it. I'm glad I have another bottle in the cellar :)","ChugginOil","Mar 13, 2011"
4.38,7.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I'm quite happy with this latest GI offering. I look forward to buying myself a couple bottles of this fantastic brew that's right up there with BC Stout.","MowryJC","Beers"
4.22,3.4,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"I was lucky enough to try this on tap at Goose Island's Stout Fest. It poured a viscous and lifeless black with a dark khaki head. It looks a lot like the Night Stalker. The aromas are full of milk chocolate and dark roasted malts. I expected it to be a little more bitter and it was sweeter than I anticipated. The flavors too were of sweet milk chocolate, coffee, and dark roasted malts. I expected some bitterness from the Columbus hops but it remained to be a sweeter milk chocolate throughout. I was also glad it didn't have any lasting char. It drank very smooth for the style and the 11.5% wasn't noticeable at all. It was thick and coated the palate, leaving a sweet but not too sweet aftertaste. I'll definitely pick up a couple bottles of this when it comes out next month.","aasher","0"
