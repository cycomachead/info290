4.49,2.7,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"I don't like coffee to dominate the flavor of my beers and this is probably the best representation of coffee I've ever tasted.  Velvety smooth chocolate with a little bit of back-end coffee bitterness that feels authentic. I didn't really taste any almonds though. I bought one to age but it's so perfectly balanced I don't think there's any sense in letting it sit. I hope I can get my hands on the bourbon barrel aged version soon.","StinkyFishBoys","Apr 04, 2015"

4.17,-4.6,4.75,4.5,4,4,4,"Bottle.  Started at 57 degrees.  Label said "Best before 2015".  What's that about?  A cheap shot at Deschutes?  Anyways, this does pour very black and exciting.  Aroma is sweet, maybe some oak but don't think is barrel aged?  Maybe it's the cookie.  As it warmed in the glass I got a sweet molasses-like smell, very nice.  First flavor impression is bitterness; it gives way to smooth flavor, but that bitterness is always there with each drink from start to finish.  I did not get distinct coffee or chocolate, but rather roasted malt and some kind of welcomed melded sweetness.  Sorry, my palate just can't pick out 7 kinds of distinct fruits and grains like some of our more insightful members!  Mouthfeel was nice medium, but I wish a little creamier, say more like Founders Breakfast Stout or Goose Island Bourbon County or Prairie Bomb!  Overall a very well crafted stout, but that front end bitterness is a bit of an issue for me.","marieli","Apr 02, 2015"

No off characteristics at all. Everything is very smooth and balanced. Later more sweetness comes out. Aesthetics are key here. Beautiful body. I want so much more.","drpimento","Mar 21, 2015"

I held on to it and got a sudden craving for something like this on this cool snowy late fall night. The night before Thanksgiving. Like I said, the coffee taste came through on the finish and really started creeping and staying on the palette the more I drank it. I had the whole 22 oz. bottle but would have been much more satisfied with just an 8 oz. pour. The first few sips were actually very pleasant. I rated this a bit higher as it was very good, minus the coffee...I guess I was hoping for something different but really, that coffee taste was inevitable... it was brewed with it!","mitch3114","Nov 28, 2014"

Aromas of roasty caramel, chocolate, and hints of vanilla. Roasted heavy malts smell as well. I taste a boozy, roasted dark chocolate at the front, hints of vanilla and coffee are in there too. Overall, it tastes just like what i would think dunking a biscotti stick in coffe would taste like.  Malty and caramel slight hints as well. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous. Its fairly boozy. Mice smooth finish with a good lingering taste that's not too overpowering.","sanzenapocalypz","0"

3.75,-14.2,,,,,,"Main smell is woody with a bit of coffee roast. Later it opens up a bit to include a sweet chocolate liquor. Surprisingly thin compared to what I was expecting from a big Imperial Stout. First taste is that woody note from the aroma, a little green. Flavors that come after are more typical of an imperial stout, ending with a sort of char and chocolate aftertaste, though the midpalate on the way there is curiously empty and clean. If there is supposed to be any of the namesake biscotti flavour in this, I'm not getting any of it at all. No baked goods or bready toasty anything at all, no almond anything. I had heard this was a real standout stout so this is very surprising and disappointing. If I had never heard anything about it at all I would say it is an OK imperial with a bit of odd green wood flavor.","BrownNut","Sep 23, 2014"

The taste is pretty similar with the coffee even more prominent but not overwhelming To me, many coffee stouts have too much coffee and not enough beer, but this is among the most balanced I've had. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, though a bit thinner than many imperials. Oddly, I enjoyed this beer more when it was really cold and felt it didn't improve with warming.","Qbdoo","Jul 31, 2014"

4.13,-5.5,4,4,4.25,4.25,4,"Poured a black body with one finger light brown head that left a little bit of lace ring. Mostly a roasted and coffee malt aroma along with dark chocolate. Smooth and light which is how I prefer my stouts. Plenty of roast and coffee to go around but well-balanced from some sweet dark chocolate (not really any vanilla) and possibly some nuts. Probably a little more sweet than roasted/coffeeish so it hit my sweet tongue.","clayrock81","Jun 05, 2014"

4.32,-1.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, best before 2015. Pours dense pitch black color with a 2 finger dense dark brown head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, fudge, espresso beans, roasted malt, dark bread, caramel, vanilla, light nuttiness, and roasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and vanilla notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, espresso beans, roasted malt, fudge, toast, dark bread, caramel, vanilla, light nuttiness, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roast/coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, espresso, roast, fudge, toast, dark bread, caramel, vanilla, light nuttiness, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and vanilla flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, smooth, moderately slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding imperial coffee stout. All around awesome complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and vanilla flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 27, 2014"

I know it messes with your head retention, and makes your mouthfeel slippery and eel-like. But--given how those additions make a beer taste--a brew that had those flavor/aroma components and had great retention and a perfect mouthfeel would be a contender for most badass brew of all time.

Aroma of sweet toasted malt, quality coffee and sweet cookie dough notes. Flavor is dense sweet dark malt, coffee, vanilla and a bit of cookie dough, very well melded into a rich coffee chocolate flavor. A nice hop bitterness with mild char in the finish. Great creamy body. More like a liqueur enhanced chocolate coffee shake than a beer, slightly on the sweet side, but flavorful enough that it was not a detractor. Dangerously drinkable. The high ABV was totally covered and this invited repeated tastes requiring pacing. A classic.","LiquidAmber","Feb 06, 2014"

Sweetness initially on the palate, but not cloyingly so. Loads of chocolate up front that gives way to dark fruit with hints of coffee. Finishes dry. Full bodied with very little carbonation.

Nose expresses dark cocoa, a bit of char and perhaps coffee and hazelnuts. Taste consistent with nose - the flavor profile is very much reminiscent of a confection. The coffee presence and hazelnuts are much more intensified here. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a pleasant, even carbonation and a slight chalkiness to the texture. Overall, an excellent American Double Imperial Stout that just falls a little short in the mouthfeel department.","Jwale73","Nov 24, 2013"

4.75,8.7,4.25,4.75,4.75,5,4.75,"Overall (4.75): This is one of those epic stouts that has to had to be believed. It packs tons of chocolate and coffee goodness with unique almond/vanilla biscotti bar undertones. It isn't the most aggressive stout; nor is it the most coffee-forward stout. But it might be the most well-balanced sweet stout I've ever had. A great stout that I think cracks my top 5–behind Founders KBS and Mikkeller Beer Geek Brunch Weasel, but ahead of Founders Breakfast Stout and Southern Tier Creme Brulee. Great stuff. See it, buy it. It's worth the $15-plus you'll likely have to pay for a 22 ounce bottle.","hagbergl","Beers"

4.3,-1.6,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,"A rather pleasantly innocuous imperial stout, with slight Italian dessert qualities, everything kind of muddled, but in a very engaging manner. The coffee just adds to the Etruscan essence, while the alcohol does a hell of a job of keeping its head down, that point can't be stressed enough. Not a drinker, more of a slow sipper, but without any barrel or overt booze astringency, I can see how the former might seem foolishly appealing here.","biboergosum","Beers"

Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, coffee, chocolate, almonds, brown bread, light pitted fruit, toffee, molasses, and a touch of alcohol. Really great nose on this one! The flavor is diabetes inducing sweetness. Lots of smokey syrupy molasses caramel and brown sugar up front. The coffee cuts through the sweetness as does the tart fruitiness and a touch of alcohol. Thick body with a minimal amount of carbonation and a sweet sticky syrupy mouthfeel. This is a huge sweet sticky beer, but it really does work for me. The nose is incredible here and Id love if we could shave about 10 points of gravity.","johnnnniee","Jul 11, 2013"

Aroma of chocolate malt notes with some light caramel with some vanilla and Italian cookie notes.

Heavy, dark aromas of espresso, chocolate cake, candied nuts, maple, mild charcoal, and roasted barley. Increased cookie-like aromas as it warms up along with a whiff of alcohol. Sweet, roasty dark chocolate initially, joined by lots of coffee, vanilla, dark fruit, berries, and a little breadiness. Very, very rich, yet the bold coffee presence keeps the sweetness down a bit. Full, creamy body, oily in texture. Bordering on too-sweet territory, it manages to stay deliciously dessert-like and not a chore to drink.

The aroma has a strong sweetened coffee flavor jumping out, along with some nutty flavors and a bit of roasted malts and dark fruits. The taste brings out the flavor I got as "sweetened coffee" - there's a very solid amount of milk chocolate backing up the coffee, along with some sweet almond. Despite all the sweet flavors, Imperial Biscotti Break somehow manages to not be cloying - in fact, this is one of the most drinkable imperial stouts I've had in a while. The mouthfeel is very luxurious, it's very velvety feeling, with a perfect level of carbonation and a lighter body than most imperial stouts of the ABV.

If the booze wasn't so strong on the nose, then I'd really enjoy the smell of the beer overall. Flavor is alcohol, then dark fruits, more alcohol and some bitterness.

A candy dessert beer here, but plenty drinkable. The bomber is a bit much, so probably want to share this one. Not really any alcohol notes, which is impressive at 11.5%.

3.56,-18.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Decanted into a Surly Darkness goblet, this beer was an impenetrable obsidian color, though brown edges became apparent towards the end; a small cap of tannish-mocha head on top retained as a ringlet, yielding minimal lacing, more oily streaking. Appropriate for the style / ABV. Aroma was fairly roasty, notes of chocolate, vanilla, caramel. Taste was quite disappointing compared to the regular BB, roasty malts, semi-sweet chocolate, light notes of vanilla and almond, with quite a bit of intrusive booze that really thinned out the body quite a bit. I tried letting this come down closer to room temperature, but even with that, things didn't improve much. About medium-bodied, watered-down booze-like mouthfeel, not at all rich and creamy. Still decent overall, but lacking in many ways. This was a mess compared to its porter counterpart which was much more balanced and tasty.","Rifugium","Nov 21, 2012"

4.07,-6.9,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Imperial Biscotti Break pours solid black, with almost three fingers of milk chocolate colored foam crowning the beer. Head retention is very good, but lacing is pretty much nonexistent. The nose is fantastic, with aromas of chocolate covered almonds and a slightly spicy coffee wafting up out of the glass. The great balance present between the two in the aroma is lost a bit in the flavor profile though. The chocolate and almond notes fade way to the background, and the coffee becomes noticeably more prominent. The peppery quality to the coffee is also a bit more apparent here. A subtle vanilla sweetness does make itself known in the finish though. The body is nice and full and creamy, befitting a decadent stout. The minimal support needed from some carbonation just isn't there though and so the beer ends up coming across as fairly syrupy. Imperial Biscotti Break is a fairly tasty stout, and a very nice dessert beer. While I'm only trying a bottle from this second wave, and didn't have any from the first batch, I have to say I don't quite get the hype though.","axeman9182","Oct 07, 2012"

Nose at first was a little salty moving as it warms to heavy salted caramels and sea salted chocolate. Taste is rich, silky, luscious with sweet chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, and big cookie dough and baked crunchy cookie. Very rich and dessert heavy and definitely delivering on all the aesthetics and fundamentals. Palate is mildly lactic, easy to drink, nice balancing bitterness though this beer is still on the sweet dessert side. But no cloying.

When I pour this variation of motor oil it's pitch black and forms a thicket of mocha tan head with even fine lacing. Aroma, nutty fresh baked biscotti, it's crazy that's what I'm smelling. Cookie dough, chocolate chip, caramel drizzled on it, with a hint of cream/powdered sugar notes. Excellent combination of flavors this is the beer of all beers, this needs to be brought back to the masses. Nutty, coffee, broken biscotti dunked in a coffee that is this beer, it's amazing. With caramelized malt sugars, slight hints of cream, basically a beautiful marriage of liquid flavors that I can't fully describe it must be experienced. This beer is a perfect coffee, chocolate, imperial stout as there ever has been, this is creative across the pond brew that I want to be part of. Send us more, this drinks smooth, big booze, big alcohol, flavor...it's interesting. Mouthfeel is full bodied carbonation is flowing full and independently of all other forces this is perfect beer.

The taste is mostly like the aroma, there's coffee, roasted malt, bittersweet and milk chocolate, burnt/charred malt, caramel, vanilla, molasses, dark fruit, nuts, and a little bit of licorice is noticeable. Nice mix with the sweet and bitter flavors in this brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit slick and creamy with moderate carbonation.

Thick, chewy dark chocolate brownies blend perfectly with a rich espresso note, vanilla beans, and a hint of almond and booze in the finish. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and lightly carbonated. Chewy, but drinkable, and the 11.5% is hardly detected on the palate. Overall, a superb example of a flavored imperial stout. So glad I happened to run across this bottle!","wagenvolks","May 25, 2012"

4.35,-0.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"D - A definite sipper, and probably too rich to have more than one in an evening, perhaps two. Just as good as Biscotti Break and delivers exactly as promised - it's a bigger version of the original.","MasterSki","0"

4.85,11,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Notes: A really good "flavored" Imperial Stout. Coffee and chocolate dominated as expected, but the vainilla and to a lesser extent the almonds had their time to shine. All the flavors complimented each other wonderfully (the vainilla and chocolate together especially). I would love to have this in the morning or for dessert any day in lieu of coffee. Delicious.","FreshHawk","May 17, 2012"

4.58,4.8,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"A pleasantly different angle on a favorite style of mine- the coffee stout. There is something reminiscent of Westbrook's Mexican Cake- perhaps that great chocolatey background. This is well worth the fairly hefty price and I really must find another of these to try again in 12-18 months when the flavors will be blended even better and the feel will be even creamier. I highly recommend buying this if you find it- and then sending it to me!","ThickNStout","May 13, 2012"

Taste is quite nice - it's very roasty, but there is a great mix of flavors going on here. It's a little sweet, and the coffee and chocolate come through very nicely here. It's quite drinkable for as big and bold of a stout as this is. Mouthfeel is thick and a bit oily, but quite nice. Overall, this is pretty impressive - best beer I've had from Evil Twin and the first one I'd go out of my way to seek out.","starrdogg","May 08, 2012"

4.7,7.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the flavoring. The mix of the most robust bitter char, with sweeter malts, great coffee, and great chocolate makes for an amazing drink. It seems simple at first, but the malts show great complexity, with the mixing sweetness and bitter so expertly blended. Another remarkable fact is that the alcohol is almost never apparent, despite the big tag. The flavors are just that good. If there was one complaint it would have to be that the nose was a little light in comparison to how robust everything else was. This beer is truly a must have.","TheBrewo","May 05, 2012"

Having had only one other beer from Evil Twin (to my recollection), this was wonderful. Big coffee notes played extremely well with the aggressive roasted malt backbone this beer had. Tone down the alcohol notes a bit, but still this is one to try.","ShanePB","Apr 30, 2012"

4.7,7.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a deep, dark, near black with thick and dense creamy brown head. Good retention and lacing. Powerful scent evokes brownies and fudge, cream cheese frosting, dark roasted espresso with cream and sugar, brown sugar and spiced cookies, fresh scraped vanilla bean, tart dark fruit and a a kiss of almond paste. Taste brings all of these fantastic components and blends them together into a bold, flavorful brew with a distinct touch of port like alcohol. Full bodied, creamy with a faint powdery texture. All around fantastic beer, best from this brewer yet.","rfgetz","Apr 26, 2012"
4.7,7.6,5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"Sweeet! It's definitely dessert time when you're about to drink this one and I definitely couldn't drink it every day but I think it deserves such a high score for it's boldness and layering of flavors. I was also able to just sip on this for about an hour or so at the bar so it was great for a casual drinking beer. THis one is worth every penny though and I'm glad I picked up a bottle in the city last weekend.","Ohiovania","Apr 24, 2012"
4.31,-1.4,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"it feels sticky sweet, but the bitterness from the stout base balances that out. But lets be honest here, the biscotti flavors take over.","VncentLIFE","Apr 23, 2012"
5,14.4,5,5,5,5,5,"WOW! I love this beer. The look of this beer is awesome. Had a nice head for a high abv. beer, nice lacing, And black as night. The smell is of Dark chocolate, vanilla, almond, and sweet malt. The taste is of dark chocolate, almond, espresso, coffee liquor, creme, caramel and the hops give it a dark chocolate bitterness. The feel is creamy, silky, and has nice carbonation. VELVET! Pure Heaven in beer form. I love This beer. It is expensive but worth every cent! This is the best imperial stout i have had! Only the Founders KBS and CBS come close in my opinion. Nice Work Evil Twin!!!! Says limited brewed once... Please God make them brew it again!","KingEdward","Apr 20, 2012"
4.42,1.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Served from bottle into a Green Man snifter. Poured a massively dark brown (almost black) with a half finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, milk chocolate, bread, wood, and subtle sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, vanilla, dark chocolate, bread, coffee, cream, and milk chocolate. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The aroma and flavor were really nice on this one if I’m honest. The flavor was the star though as it was very well balanced and coated your palate, leaving it wanting more after each sip. The aroma was very pleasant as well and very inviting. I could see non-craft beer drinkers enjoying the aroma on this one. Probably one of the best brews I’ve had from Evil Twin to-date. Great job on this one guys!","thagr81us","Apr 13, 2012"

There was a lot going on but it wasn’t necessarily well-layered or balanced. This had far too much sweetness and not enough roasted bitterness for my liking in an imperial stout. This beer does hide the alcohol pretty well. Overall, it's a decent imperial stout, but I'm not sure I would get it again.","BlackBelt5112203","0"
