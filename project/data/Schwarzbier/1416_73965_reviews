"Great look with a huge fluffy head that clings to the glass and has great retention. Smokey and sweet malt with earthy hops and a light lingering bitterness with some charred wood and bittersweet chocolate lingering. Crisp feel and very smooth With a drying finish. Terrific flavor for such a light beer. Nicely done and cool to see it is organically made as there are not many options in the category."

"O: closer to a stout than any black lager I've had, this also may be the best."
"Pours pitch black with a lingering head. Smell is of wonderfully charred malts. Taste is full of roasted malt with hints of coffee and chocolate. Hops provide just enough bitterness. Feel is absolutely velvety smooth. Light and very easy to drink. Tons of flavor for 4% ABV. One of the best black lagers currently out there IMO."
"Very good. Appearance is a thick light tan, long lasting head with lots of lace and an almost opaque, but clear black brown color. Aroma is roast up front then dark leather, meat, coffee, malt. cocoa. Flavor's like nose, dryish at first, then with the other qualities including tang, there's a bit of sweet in the finish. Body is good, tho perhaps a bit thin. Very quaff-able. I'd like to have another right away."
"3/19/15 (Can) - Dark black pour, roasted malt and coffee scents were very strong and desirable. Taste was even better, excellent roasted malt and chocolate. Very smooth to drink, minimal carbonation, light in both texture and ABV. Nice paring with desert. Overall very good offering!"

"Roasty dark malts, some bitter grassy hops. Looks great, tastes not too shabs."

"A very mild, relaxing black lager. Easy on the bite and alcohol content, BABA goes down smooth.  One minor drawback is a lack of confirmed character- nothing stands out.  Black as coal, refreshing, non-bitter, and surprisingly light on the palette.  Nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Excellent taste profile, easy drinking. I'll be revisiting this one I believe."
"12 oz. bottle from Whole Foods. Nose of faint toast and yeast. Flavors of roasted coffee, smoke and bittersweet cocoa. Slight malt influence. Mildly bitter, yet mouth feel remains light and slightly watery with good carbonation. Dry, not sweet. Outstanding flavor for a light beer. Well done."

"Planning to enjoy for the next few weeks: just put a keg in the Keggerator.  It'll be gone soon after my friends find out I have it!"

"Serving type: can"
"Pours a dark brown with tan head. Has a dark chocolate,  coffee and roast nose with a light peat note in the aroma. The roast or peat comes through in the flavor with a almost coffee like bitterness. The coffee and roasted flavors remain in the aftertaste. Finishes dry almost tart. Some light astringency That's not unpleasant maybe from tartness? Reminds more of a robust porter with roast character."
"awesome in my opinion. just my style"

"This is a session beer if ever there were one. Low in ABV but big on flavor. I love it."

"O: [4.00] I am really pleasantly surprised.  This is a really delicious and complex beer for being only 4% ABV.  The label says ""Black Lager"" but if I was blind folded I would call it a stout.  This is really sessionable."

"I really enjoy this.  Maybe a bit to much buttery malt to make this exceptional for me, though it is not over barring.  Still very good, and one I will be getting more off."
"Pours a black color.  5/4 inch head of an off-white color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of sweet malt, pale malt, hops, hint of roasted malt, hint of wheat, and slight pine.  Fits the style of a  Schwarzbier.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of sweet malt, pale malt, hops, hint of roasted malt, hint of wheat, and slight pine.  Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend."

"T: Good malt sweetness and cocoa nibs. Low Munich malt notes. Graham cracker sweetness. Slight char on the back. Good and soft undergirding bitterness."

"12 oz bottle. Hints of chocolate and french roast coffee in the smell. Not much head, moderate carbonation, nice lacing on the glass. The taste was chocolate, coffee, bready, and pleasantly balanced with light hops. Much lighter and crisper than I was expecting frpm the pitch black appearance. Very drinkable lager."

"This black lager is delicious and smooth.  It has great flavor and texture - it is not velvety like some other black lagers.  Baba is a  great session beer and my favorite black lager."
""
""
""
"Overall - Wow, did Uinta ever fit a ton of roasty flavor into this very light beer! Unfortunately, it's body comes off as quite watery, which is probably to be expected at just 4% ABV. Also, I found the roasty charcoal aspect to be a bit much, which negatively affects the drinkability/ sessionability for me. Still, I respect what Uinta has done with this: it seems like a no-brainer session beer for a porter/stout lover."

"Poured on tap at the brass tap in Tallahassee into a pint glass. Pours jet black with extremely low clarity, when held up to the light you get slight reddish brown flecks on the side but still holds an extremely dark complexion. The thick tightly woven desert sand colored microbubble head sits firmly on top of the beer holding very firmly for a number of minutes. It was about half an inch at the pour and has deflated down to a quarter and still holding strong. As the beer goes down it leaves large sheets of webby lace. This is an amazing looking beer. Aroma consists of dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee , sweet fresh bread , milk chocolate and roasted malt. Lots going on here and all of it very pleasing. The aroma isn't overpowering but complex and enjoyable, I find myself smelling it over and over looking for new subtleties. Taste is sweet on pallet entry with a touch of citrus that quickly fades directly into roasted notes, next comes dark chocolate which leads to a finish of sweet milk chocolate and finally a touch of dry roasted flavors and a touch of hop bitterness. All and all a good flavor profile. Some may find this a bit too bitter or astringent but this would be a delight for black coffee drinkers and anyone who drinks IPA's would most likely never notice its bitterness level. I wish there was a little more oomph from the malt here but that's nitpicking as I feel the drink ability is higher this way, especially if consumed by the liter. The mouthfeel is good its almost perfectly full but it does have a little fizz to it. I feel this keeps the beer interesting where the flavors fall flat a bit but I would prefer a beer that has both full flavor and a full mouthfeel. All and all a great beer. Drinkability is high and flavor is complex and tame at the same time. I cant decide if I want more out of it or less really but I will say its one of the best looking schwarzbiers I have ever seen. Looking forward to trying more options from these guys, lots of good stuff coming from Utah it seems."

"O: 3.25 This beer is pretty meh. Even if the yeast had backed off a bit the underlying characteristics are uninteresting. At least itâ€™s fairly easy drinking and somewhat refreshing."
""

"Overall: Average to above average black lager, good alternative to a stout or porter if your looking to pick up those flavors."

"And as the flavors conclude with coffee-type roast and a broad woodish bitterness, mildly burnt embers add to the hops for a consensus bitter finish with spice and pep. Medium-bodied, its refined lager-like influence complements its rugged roastiness nearly ideally."
""
""
""
"It's an outstanding beer."
"Black lager but really more like a stout in aroma and body, the lager yeast must really not play nice with the roasted malt since there are some off flavors coming through the veil of chocolate and dark flavors. I think I could pass this off to my stout lovers buddies when they need to session something."

"very good beer. all the stout flavors I love without the heavy body which makes it perfect for a hot spring night like tonight. dark chocolate and a little coffee but not as much as a typical stout, which is balanced with a bit more creamy doughiness."

"T: Refreshing, mild hops well balanced with the malt. Little aftertaste. Could drink several."
""
""
""
"A wonderful showing for this style with allot of flavor hat finishes out clean and dry. In the nose you get allot of roasted malt, charred vegetal ash, and somewhat sweeter Munich malt undertones. The roast carries through to the palate with hints of the ash working together with the maltier notes and finishing with a pleasing dryness."

"i was surprised at how much i enjoyed this one. black as night, with a off white creamy head. the nose was full of chocolates, roasted malts, a little coffee, cocoa, and some smoke. the taste followed the nose well but heavy on the roasted malts and smoke while minor on the chocolate and coffee - not much by way of the hops. went down quite easily, like a aqueous porter. all in all i was really happy with this beer and would definitely have again."

"Bottom line: If you, like me, have a wee bit of trouble with the concept of ""moderation"" and are looking to downgrade your ABVs without sacrificing taste, this is certainly worthy of your consideration."
"O- The aroma of this beer is a big teaser. You get all sorts of good roast notes and then the rest of the beer is a letdown. Such a shame."

"The taste recovered things a bit with a more forward dark sweet malt and licorice character. The butter was not as obvious in the flavor. It ended mildly bitter and pleasant."
"Home tasting, 12oz can into Snifter. 1/11/14."
""
""
"Pours a deep dark brown with a smallish off white head that dissipates quickly. Aromas of burnt caramel toffee and butter with a hint of chocolate with a touch of ash and sulfur. Flavor is rich caramel and chocolate with hints of butter. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick sweet mouthfeel. Decent brew, but the buttery aspect of it turned me off a bit."

"D/O- The definition of sessionable, Uinta's Baba Black Lager packs as much flavor into it's (relatively) tiny low ABV frame as possible. A solid schwarz. I (really) could drink this all day."

"O: Great if not one of my favorite lagers! Really impressive just how much flavor they packed into this neat little package. Great for a time you want that porter/stout taste but not the ""i just ate a meal"" feeling! Really enjoyed it and would get it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Medium bodied. Leaves a slight residue on the back of the tongue."
"o: Sure to surprise anyone expecting a mild dark-colored lager, because it's so much like an easy drinking light porter. At 4% highly sessionable as well, and would be very good as such in cool weather, or as an accompaniment with a good steak dinner. Wasn't so bad with a German hot dog and some au gratin potatoes either. Have yet to have anything I did not like from Uinta."
"O - This is one of the best lagers I have ever had. The balance and VARIETY in the flavor profile are simply outstanding. Outstanding session brew."
""
""
""
""

"Pours dark brown with a khaki head. Aroma is crisp, showing itself as a lager, with a clean roastiness that gives off some coffee and dark chocolate components, and a little bready. Flavor lacks the punch of the aroma a bit but definitely grew on me the more I drank it; sharp roastiness that is more coffee grind than chocolatey, a touch of some bread, and a nice charred and slightly bitter finish. Both the aroma and flavor comes out big time as it warms up. A crisp, light active mouthfeel. Overall, a very nice sessionable beer here. Uinta with a winner."
"O: Tasty, session lager. One of 3 great black lagers I've tried this year. (Rogue, Port are also a must try). Like this low alcohol version."

"I'm usually not a fan of black lagers, but then again I was not a fan of imperial black IPAs. This brewery has won me over on both. The head was a nice malt color. The pour left a small amount of head, but definitely left lacing on my 16 oz non chilled pint glass. The taste does not overpower which is a big plus in my book. Black anything tends to have a very powerful taste which removes any chance for enjoyment. This tastes very smooth. Goes down like a nice chocolate malt. The mouth feel is sooth, and yet has nice texture. Reminds me of the mouth feel of a good British ale. It ha the same light carbonation too. The flavors are subtle but present. Rich coffee, malt, maybe a hint of hazelnut. All and all a must try."
""
"Overall: Pretty solid black lager/Schwarzbier. Lots of character with that light feeling. Love it."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, very mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while if youâ€™re in the mood for the style."
"Overall, not my favorite black lager or even close to it, but not a bad choice. If you are in the mood to try something new or into organic beers, this might be the one for you."
""
"Excellent brew among its style. More flavorful than regular Schwarzbier, but still refreshing and with good drinkability."
""
""

"Poured into a sam adams glass, nice tan heas, mild lacing lasted a bit. Black in color with a burnt malt and coffee aroma. Taste had stong coffee noted with hints of spice and vanilla. Medium body mouth feel with a dry aftertaste. All in all a nice beer, may be my first organic version,"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Baba Black Lager from Uinta is another solid offering. The beer pours a nearly opaque dark with slightly off-white head that is leaving a lace. The scent is malty and I get a touch of hazelnut. The taste is more of a roasty maize with a touch of peat. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a good winter session brew."
""
"O- this is really good, and very affordable. Uinta keeps rolling out good stuff!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would not quite call this offering hearty, but it is certainly tasty and its designation as an organic ale is a definite bonus."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice mix of regular lager tones and dark malt. Reminds me of an easy going porter. A much more solid brew then I expected."
""
""
""
""
"The taste is a nice blend of dark malt flavors with some sweetend black coffee and roasted nutty woody essence with subtle sweet note with gentle spice in the finish and mild fruity toffee tinge with perhaps a hint of raisin. The overall impression is this a great session lager and I welcome the opportunity to have it anytime."
"Uinta Baba Black Lager ---4/5."

"Overall: This is my first time enjoying this style and I love it. It is refreshing, light, and interesting with a powerful flavour."
"Overall: this is a tasty beer that is eminently quaffable. I could enjoy this brew all day."
""
""
"This was a very neutral tasting beer. Clean an had plenty of character. It dries out slowly in the finish with a nice lingering bitter after all and was subtle and roasty on the palate. It's all about the grain and was not harsh but smooth and balanced."
""
""
""
""
"O: I thought this beer was pretty easy to drink and the 4% ABV makes this one quite sessionable. Really nice flavors."
"overall - a nice easy drinking everyday beer that is still very flavorful."
""
"Because the alcohol was light but the body was fully, this had the feel of a light Ale. Like a Vienna Lager, this makes me mistake for styles that I think are similar but really aren't. On its own, this was a very good example of the style that would also double as a session beer It's not anything that would wow anyone but there's something to like here for everyone, even during the Summer months when dark beers aren't in the forefront."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Let me just start by saying its the best Black Lager I have ever drank. Super smooth and super tasty. Low in alcohol but High in taste. Have bought multiple six packs of CANS and its one of my favorites. I used to be a bottle only guy until I tried this beer. You can't beat a good beer in a can. Definitely would recommend this to anyone who likes dark beers, whether you like stouts or porters this one is one to try."
"Definitely a tasty beer and one I would like to have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really nice beer."
""

"NATURALLY, it doesn't say, which is smart marketing, as mysterious sells...."
"Another good beer from Uinta. Iâ€™m pretty sure everything they make is above average. Iâ€™d try this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall dark and roasty fresh, but softly delicate in delivery. A schwarz with some roasty depth, texture and character."
""
""
""
"O: A pretty good session beer, but when you are paying top dollar from microbreweries, it is hard to justify buying a beer that is lacking a fuller flavor profile."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts, some notes of coffee. Taste is coffee, smokey, roasted malts, smooth, flavorful, and easy drinking. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
"O- Balanced, full flavored, and very drinkable. This is a strong and low alcohol black lager."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great dark lager. It has the lightness and freshness of a lager, with some genuinely well-delivered roasted characters from the malt. It's a delicate balancing act, and it's performed very well here."
""
""
"O- Really nothing going on with this beer, no unpleasant flavors but also pretty much no flavor to this beer at all."
"O - Solid beer, love the good roasted flavors in this."
""
""
"Well made and interesting. This is a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice. Drinkable, tasty, no harsh edges or horrible flaws."
""
"Yeah, I get that it is an allusion to the nursery rhyme, but how would any self-respecting rocker not default to The Who's Baba O'reily? Dunno. I did. I also utilized an aggro pour which resulted in a cascade-like action, finishing with a massive two-plus fingers of thick, dense, deep-tan head with great retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown with garnet highlights. Nose had a pleasant smokiness accompanying a dark chocolate semi-sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, not quite creamy, but approaching. The flavor was smoky, slightly bitter with an underlying chocolatiness. Finish was semi-dry and the flavor of chocolate lingered well pat the swallow. The lacing that remained in the glass was remarkable. Good stuff! I would drink this again."
""
""
""
"Overall â€“ A really enjoyable beer. Light enough to session, but flavourful enough to stay interesting. Also well balanced and a nice appearance. I have yet to have a bad beer from this brewer."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, mahogany coloring that is almost black, with ruby highlights under light. A light, sparse, filmy, light tan surface coating of head. Aromas of toasted grains with a hint of sweet molasses and some dark, old world fruit sweetness. Flavors are sharp initially, with a date and fig sweetness quickly overridden by a bitter and roasty coffee character. The bitter and sweet work into a balance, with a touch of sharpness at the end of the palate. The sharp feel is amplified by the light body. A roasty, darkly sweet aftertaste, with a clean, very crisp finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste-Black patent malts, dark toasted malt,chocolate and black licorice note. Subtle hop kiss in a soft dry finish. More substance than a lager. Almost porter-like in mouthfeel. Very tasty and quite sessionable at only 4.0ABV. A great match for burgers or brats. My first beer from this brewery and I am impressed by this offering. More please!"
""
""
""
""
"O-This is my first Uinta review and I'll say again that this beer punches above its alcohol weight. I think it is sort of rare to find a good winter session-type beer like this. That being said, the flavor is a touch earthy and dull when compared against the best examples of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Uinta delivers a great package in this black lager, coming in at just 4% ABV. This would put me in a good mood while barbecuing."
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the aroma with its rich malty base, and nice blend with the phenolic, boozy, and spicy notes throughout. The flavor translates this interplay nicely, giving equal strength to the malt base and the complementary sweetness of the other included sugars. To this point no flavoring is explicitly overwhelmed, but the ultimate taste is a bit basic. This is a nice, standard beer, but, again, deviates little from the stylistic guidelines, leaving you with little to think about."
""
""
""
""
"Decent example of the style, with the expected slightly smoky aroma and taste. But no more than that; everything about it is kind of run-of-the-mill. (I rated a few qualities higher than average just because I like the style.) I probably wouldn't buy it again."
"Overall- well this one needs to settle down a bit, the black lager is a popular one now and i think the reason you do a black lager is to have the drinkability of the lager with the subtle roastedness of a dark grain. this has it, if you a patient enough. Pair with Charcuterie, and a early spring morning."
""
"O= I really like dark beers, but there are times when a heavy dark beer is not appropriate like after a hard skiing. I want a dark beer, but not one that's heavy. This fits the bill perfectly."
""
"A good tasting, light-bodied dark lager. The body is almost featherweight, but I suppose that goes with the lager style. If a porter or stout seems like too much at the time, but you want a dark beer flavor, this one is a good choice."
""
""
"O: another one of these domestic dark German lagers that goes a bit overboard with the hops...let this one ""expire"" and then give it a shot"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- this one isn't balanced enough for me. Too grainy with not enough chocolatey sweetness but it's very drinkable and not offensive in any way."
"Black with a nice light tan quilt. Smells malty, some coffee, some soil, some leather - all components come together nicely. I like the nose. Robust flavor with leather, cocoa, dark chocolates, coffee (espresso tradiitional), a slight earthy character. well fucking done. Medium on full bodied with moderate, but prickly carb. This is a sincerely well done beer. Absolute delight for the style. Really recommend this."
""
""
""
""
""
"The aftertaste is weak as well but nice and creamy. This is the third beer I have tried from this brewery and none of them were very impressive."
""
"A decent black lager, though the taste was heavy on the burnt wood."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I like Baba Black Lager and wouldn't mind having it again. It's the sort of beer that lends itself to drinking and not so much reviewing."
""
"Heavy-hitting roasted chocolate flavors present. Sweet mellow flavors meld with a dry cracker finish. Cereal grains on the back end. This little beer packs on the flavor. This is organic too? Nice. A nice little beer here. This is a style that is underrated in my mind, and one I need to revisit more and more. Cool label art to boot."

"OVERALL: A nice dark lager, really easy drinking. One of the better session ales Ive had. I could recommend this to anyone."
""
"D - Quaffable and rather enjoyable... It depends how you're viewing this beer... If you look at it compared to all of beerdom, it's a fairly pedestrian average at best offering... If you look at it solely as a session brew, it's a very nice offering from Uinta... Lots of flavor and pretty decent character for a 4% ABV offering, especially for one of such dark coloring... I'm quite happy with and would seriously consider pick-up a sixer when I'm looking for an enjoyable session beer..."
""
"Overall, very easy drinking, great tasting brew, great flavor and mouthfeel from such a low strength brew."

"Great session beer and would seem to go great with a meat pizza or a nicely charred black n' blue burger. As for a schwarzbier, it strikes me as a bit non-traditional but seems to capture enough of the categorical essence. And it is Baba (Black Sheep) -- so I guess that name fits!"

"If you like light beers, this is a good one with more flavor than most."

"Black on color with a reddish-brown hue when held up to a bright light. Poured with a huge bubbly beige foam that drapes the glass with sticky lacings. Earthy dark roasted and burnt malt aromas with hints of coffee and dark chocolate in the background. Medium bodied and smooth through the middle despite the lively, aggressive carbonation up front. Bitter burnt malt flavor up front that that tapers through the middle to dark roasted malt and coffee flavors to the end. Finishes with a slightly bitter dark roasted malt aftertaste."

"Overall, very refreshing for such a dark, roasty beer. Not much malt character."
"I poured this weak brew into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was black as specified and poured a very chocolaty head. The beer also had good lacing. I thought this beer was going to be a hit, but like with other organic brews it was not. The beer was pretty tasteless and watery. It had a weak smokey character but without any ass end it just could not make the cut. I will not buy again."

"Mouthfeel is creamy and slick, with very light carbonation, a medium body and a chewy feel that runs off bitter. Overall a very tasty black lager that I'd definitely recommend."
""
""
"Roasted barley and coffee notes up front. Slight cardboard flavor as well. Singed caramel and more roasted malts fill up the palate. Tobacco and earthy, peaty notes into the finish. Roasted coffee bitterness in the end, with lingering semi-sweet chocolate. Moderate body, with medium carbonation. A nice session beer with good flavor and complexity."

"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, bottled on 5/7/2012. Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some good soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, coffee, toast, char, caramel, roasted malt, and light earthiness. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, char, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, toast, herbal, and earthiness. Lingering notes of roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, herbal, and earth on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and robustness of flavors. Fairly dry on the finish with no cloying at all. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a lightly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming as expected of 4%. Overall this is a very nice schwarzbier. Very nice balanced and robust flavors for a 4% beer; very smooth to drink. Very enjoyable stuff. If I could get this around here, this would definitely be a nice session beer choice."

"this is a heavy duty beer for a lager. pours midnight black and dense as anything, with a one inch light brown head. the nose is roasty dark malts and bready yeast. It so far is much more of a porter than a black lager i think. the flavor is very robust. burnt malt dominates the mouth, while some bitterness rises u in the finish, more from the darkness of the malt then from the hops. mouthfeel is pretty heavy again for a lager, lots of body in this one, and good carbonation. a nice bitter roasted flavor is left in the mouth for awhile, which is nice this time of year. overall a good fall session beer. super low abv makes it an all day beer."

"Deep black in color with a nice sized coffee colored head on top. Very nice roasted and grainy aroma. Trace of malty sweetness. Mellow roasted and dark grain flavors. Touch of burnt caramel going on. Quick hop bite at the end. Nice mouthfeel-higher level of CO2 gives it a slight zing on the tongue. A lot of flavor for such a low abv. Very sessionable and enjoyable."
""
"Again, I find myself appreciating this beer more as it warms. Nice malty roasted tone to it, but not so heavy or thorough that it's out of the style range. Fairly easy to drink. Oddly, more easy to drink than the lager I had just a bit earlier than this."
""
""
"Poured black, with a relatively thin tan head and good lacing. Smell is chocolatey and earthy. Taste is malt focused, with roasted coffee/chocolate notes which are pretty damn tasty. I feel like the taste is a lot like porters or even brown ales that focus on the roasted notes. . . the fact that this is a lager comes out most dominantly by the thinner mouthfeel, which makes for a much more drinkable brew, so I can dig it."
""
""
"Not bad, a decent clean black lager."

"Overall one of the better black lagers I had. In fact I believe this beer might have the most flavor I seen in a black lager with an equally lower ABV perfect for session ability. Recommended!"

" good beers have arrived drink it tonight drink it pour it enjoy it"

"I really enjoyed this Schwarzbier, as it was nicely flavored, balanced, and mostly importantly, drinkable! I ripped through this glass a lot faster than I expected. This was another solid beer from these guys."
""
""
"O-it's definitely an okay beer. It's easy drinking and tastes fine, though I wish it tasted more how it smelled. The flavors were a bit of a letdown. It'll be easy to finish though I don't see a need to get it again ever. It's forgettable."

"O - an exceptional black larger in my opinion. Well balanced wiith nice roasted malts and very little hop presence. Would certainly putrchase this again."
""
"O- Solid overall, pretty enjoyable"

"I cannot be sure if I like this beer or not, I certainly wasn't expecting a tartness to the roasted malts, but that sure makes it unique. Since it wasn't a boring, tasteless lager, I have to say it's worth a try."
"O: One of the best lagers I've ever had, but that's not saying much. The style is just isn't that great to my palate. This was like Steinlager Pure with cocoa added. The high point of the brew would be the presentation. It's better than domestic beer, but doesn't stand out among the craft. I don't recommend and wouldn't buy."
""
"Overall pretty decent considering the beer, the scent is great but the taste seems much weaker. Definitely dig the light+sessionable dark lagers but there are others I'd prefer."
""
""
"Overall, I would buy this brew again. It could go well with heavier foods. It is a little watery, but the overall flavors were ok. I was surprised because Utah has its strange 4% ABV laws, so I was not expecting this beer to be as good as it was. Buy this brew and eat a reubon."
""
"I love that this one isn't dry, but it is definitely a heavy beer! Would go great with certain foods I imagine! :)"

"O: A pretty good black lager; crisp and roast; easy drinking; good, but not overly flavorful."
"o: pleasantly surprised by this one."
"O- Not a bad brew from Uinta and this is from first and i have heard all good things and this confirms it. An abover average beer."

"Strong, smoky aroma has tones of licorice and charred wood. It pours a deep sable a whisker above black with a decent tan head. Flavor is woody and smoky, with hints of licorice and coffee. Texture is smooth and fizzy but body is average. Overall it's so-so, but worth sampling."
"An enjoyable dark lager. Easy drinking, but without becoming boring."
"Overall, this is a pretty solid beer, but could definitely use some refinement."
""
"Poured into nonic pint glass. Pours dark brown with light brown head. 1 Finger of head present initially, dissipates to a thin layer quickly. Nice lacing is left around glass. There are some ruby highlights at the edge of the glass. The smell features roasty chocolate notes along with noticeable lager yeast character. There are subtle hints of smoke present. The taste has a much heavier presence of smoke, almost a campfire like woodiness. Bitter waves of roast come through. Minimal hop presence noted. This beer feel very light with somewhat high carbonation. There is certainly a lot of flavor packed into this small beer with smoke being the main note. This is a great example of the style."
""
"Overall: It is what it is and what it is works for me."
""
""
"Medium body with a lively fine carbonation."
"D - A good beer. Very drinkable. I would get this again."
"Close to two fingers of dark tan foam, presents a few islands of larger bubbles which dissipate back into an even surface, the retention is very good and the lacing shows above average stickiness. While pure black in color, not fully opaque, the liquid has great clarity despite the hue, a metallic orange cast shows up at the glass bottom. The nose gives up lots of roast, chocolate powder, cafÃ© au lait as well as a nice spine of herbal matter, no real fruitiness, same for broad hop based scents, there is some country style bread, barley and oats, leans heavily on malts for effect. Medium-bodied, acts like it is trying to develop some bitterness, light grassiness and pine then yields to all that roast and toast, coffee beans, dark chocolate, malted milk balls and sweet bread dough. Comes up with some dried orange peel and licorice notes, adds welcome variety. The carbonation is unobtrusive yet present. Maybe some dark fruits at the end. Itâ€™s competent and consistent, pleases you for how it maintains a high energy level from first to last sip."
"This a fine black lager, though, I just don't generally find the sulfur aspects of lager yeast to work that well with darker malts."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, received in a beer of the month mix six pack from Vintage Cellar in Blacksburg, Virginia, into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. The name does not lie, pours a nice black with a nice one finger brownish white head. Smells of roasted malt, definitely a little hint of coffee. Tastes of a heavily roasted malt, with little hop presence, but enough to balance it. The malt has a bit of a coffee taste. This beer is light to medium bodied (in between) and carbonation seems correct. Overall, a very good beer and a very good black lager."
"This isn't a bad beer. The others in this style that I've tried have been imports and had that traditional euro yeasty mildew funk to them. This didn't. It was mellow, drinkable, and refreshing. I didn't mind it, but there isn't really anything here that will keep me coming back."
""
"A nice offering from Uinta, very drinkable. Although it's labeled as a black lager it really brings porter to mind. It's low 4.0% ABV makes it a good candidate for a dark session brew."
""

""
""
""
""
"O - a damn fine brew."
"O: For 4% it's got a considerable flavour, very drinkable, a well made beer. Uinta keeps coming out with good stuff."
""
"It's a worthy competitor to Session Dark, though it does lean a little more Euro. It's a slightly sweet lager, with an earthy caramel and mildly roasted barley character. It's quite nice. The body is light, but not thin. This all makes for a pleasant, drinkable session beer. Worth a try."
"Overall a nice flavorful lager, just right for mass consumption or a tasty lawnmower beer."
""
""
""
""
"O The crisp clean lagered beer has full fresh dark malt and a nice support of hops. Very drinkable and tasty."
""
"Pours black with reddish edges and an off-white head. Aroma of cinnamon, maple, slight roast and cola. Mild flavors of cola, light roast, cocoa, bready, some hop character lies in the middle. Light in body with medium carbonation. Flavors are balanced and laid back. Better than expected actually."
"Overall not a bad beer(good in fact). Just a little downside."
""
"Overall- My first black lager/schwarzbier so I don't have much to compare it to, but it seems true to the style. I liked it quite a bit, and I'm not big on lagers. I'll keep an eye out for similar beers to try, and I'll definitely pick up a six pack of this one if I find it again."
"D-This one is really not my thing and I'm about to drain-pour it; did not enjoy this one after I got past the nose."
""
""
""
"Notes: The smokiness and the dryness makes this one a solid beer and a little bit hearty. Cheers."
""
"Overall, nothing wrong with this beer, but it doesn't really excite me, and probably not a style I have that often. But it's a pretty solid brew just not for me."
"I was expecting more of a roasty schwarzbier type flavor profile, but this leans more towards a nut brown. It actually drinks pretty well and I could see myself downing a few of these in a social setting. It's tasty, but you don't have to think about it."
""
"O- Probably wouldn't pick up again. The negatives are too strong over the positives."
""
""
"Overall: a wonderfully crafted beer that smells awful and doesn't taste like much. In no rush to try this again."
""
"Solid black lager that drinks smoothly and has a pretty nice mix of flavors."
"Overall pretty nice, very drinkable, soft brown malts, light cocoa and vanilla even, caramel, light bitterness and hops, juicy lager, very much like a brown ale but lagered."
"Very similar to a thin porter. Good bittering hop presence and the malt is also bitter. Surprisingly short aftertaste. Thin bodied with a high level of carbonation."
""
""
""
"O: The flavors up front are very nice. The flavors that linger aren't as nice, but they don't ruin the beer. Just a slight bitter tang that seems out of place."
"Overall I approve. A good sessionable alternative to many dark beers which I can't handle too many of in a night. Fits a lot into such a small beer."
""
""
"O/D-Interesting. I love the label art. $10.50 a six pack is too pricey for a %4 ABV beer that can be imbibed incredibly quick. I had a beer by Notch Brewing of the same style and enjoyed that a bit more. Also, Full Sail's Session Black lager is this beer equivalent but comes in a twelve pack, which I think makes more sense. Enjoyable, but I desire a bit more muscle to my $10-11 dollar six pack."
"This beer is a dark brown colored liquid, with a slightly read hue. Moderate tan head. The aroma is malty, with a notable smoke, roast, and earthy quality. The smoke note continues through the taste, which has a touch of astringency. It's a thinner-than-necessary beer, with some sweetness and a background of under-ripe fruit. The smoky aroma is the most intriguing thing about this brew. All in all, this one is just okay."
"Austere without being very hoppy, dry with a hint of cardboard. It's not actually bad, but seems to be a cleanly-made example of a ""why bother"" style. Label claims ""organic," and I am still looking for a drinkable ""organic"" beer. Thanks to Harmon's supermarket for selling singles."
""
""
"O - Delicious. Smooth and dark. Not deep enough in flavor. But very drinkable. Might drink again."
"Uinta Brewery BABA Black Lager: The brew comes in a fine looking bottle and pours looking like a perfect stout in the glass: black in color with a brown and ample head on top. The aroma is subtle roasted grain. But that is where the stout comparison ends. The flavor is muted, and ends with at mildly bitter finish. I guess you expect a bold flavor from a beer that looks like the BABA Black Lager, but it is very easy going. By the end of the glass, I had a better appreciation for the fact that this brew is a nice lager and not a big bad ale."
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson brown with a 1 inch puffy beige head that settles to a film. Blotchy patterns of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is pretty much solely dark roasted malt and maybe some slight campfire/smoke aromas. Taste pretty much follows suit with roasted dark malt as really the only flavor. There is a slight metallic flavor on the aftertaste too. This beer has a pretty thin body with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average lager that is one dimensional in both smell and flavor."
"Overall this is like a three chord rock song. Not complex at all, but it is likeable for what it is. Just a straight meat and potatoes dark lager."
"Smooth with higher carbonation like a lager, but with a a taste that is reminiscent of the stout that it looks like. Refreshingly light in body, but it still manages to support a nice combination of dark malts and some crisp and clean hops, bringing about an even-keeled balance. A small nuttiness is present in the aftertaste and linger. Some nice complexities come through this very light ABV beer, and all aspects work very well together. Maybe its because this is the first euro dark lager I've had, but I'm pleasantly surprised by this one. No off flavors at all and an excellent refreshing mouthfeel that might just be the best part of this beer. After trying three of their beers, I like Uinta so far!"
"On tap at the Mellow in G-boro.Poured a deep dark chocolate color with a tinge of ruby,a thinner off white head atop.Earth and bitter chocolate in the nose,not much sweetness other than slight molasses sweetness.Earthy with a light bitter chocolate notes on the palate,a little brown sugar/molasses sweetness in the finish.Not complex but tasty,light and easier to drink."
"Picked this up recently for $1.50 for a 120z bottle. Dark black with brown accents at the edges. Smells like burnt toast but in a good way as well as a honeyed cereal that I can't quite put my finger on, good smell. Taste is more like a standard black lager, a tiny bit of roasty malt, not nearly as good as the smell."
"Overall it seems like the marketing males this beer more than the beer itself. Cute labeling, special bottle, and USDA Organic slapped on it make it stick out yet it yields something akin to Canadian made Guinness."
"Really enjoying this one, and at 4% Abv. I bet I'd be full before this one toppled me."
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, with a nice fizzy tan head, which leaves some sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, slight hop note, with some nice little chocolate notes. The taste is sweet, malty, very slight hop note, and caramel. Medium body, with a nice crisp feel. This is a pretty nice brew, one of the best Uinta makes at 4% ABV."
