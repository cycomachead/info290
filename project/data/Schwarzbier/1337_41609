Flavor starts with sweet chocolate, a hint of lactic sugars, turns quickly to bitter, burnt toast, and dark, slightly chalky chocolate. If there are hops in this, they are well hidden. I'm guessing earthy English hops, since I don't get any nectar you find in noble hops. Feel is creamy with a slight chalk to even it out. Finish is slightly dry.

Its` nose has coffee, over cooked malts, some caramel. The taste is roasted malts, smoky, while a tad watery. Mouthfeel is very nice, it is creamy and finishes clean. All things considered, this is an enjoyable beer and while I was on the fence when I see it in the aisle (for the 10th time or something), I am glad that I finally picked it up on one of my infrequent visits to a bottle shop in my neighboring state to the north.","mltobin","Dec 15, 2012"

Pours pitch black color with a nice 1-2 finger foamy tan head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing on the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of chocolate, roasted malt, toffee, caramel, coffee, light char, grass, and herbal. Very nice aromas with nice balance and complexity. Taste of cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, caramel, toffee, toast, herbal, grass, and earth. Lingering notes of cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, herbal, and grass on the finish for a bit. Nice flavor balance, complexity, and robustness; no cloying flavors at all on the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a fairly creamy, chalky, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish.

Roasted malt, hops aroma. Strong stout-like coffee, chocolate and roasted malts up front. The middle and end are not as robust, but still pleasant. Flavor rapidly tapers off, probably because of the low ABV. As it warmed, the finish got a little bitter and sour. A tasty schwartzbier. An above average low ABV dark beer.","LiquidAmber","Aug 01, 2012"

When I saw this was a lager, I was not expecting it to pour black, nor was I expecting it to smell and taste like a porter. I get tons of chocolate cocoa flavors with light hoppiness. The burnt malts flavors complement the coffee and chocolate flavors quite well. Flavors all blend together great! Mouthfeel is very light and refreshing.

Oh well, on to the review. Pours completely black and quite opaque, very stout like, with a tan head that slowly fades and leaves just a ring around the glass. It has okay lacing, but nothing to write home about. The aroma is full on roasty goodness with plenty of coffee and cocoa notes. Not really much else showing in the nose. The taste is also very roasty and full of coffee like flavors from the dark malts as well tons of bitter chocolate and a bit of licorice. The malt character is that of brown sugar with a nice toffee edge to it. Exceedingly clean with just a hint of herbal hoppiness and a very firm bitterness. This is definitely one of the more flavorful schwarzbiers I have had. It could easily be mistaken for a stout, even with its smooth clean character. The mouthfeel is medium and the finish is a bit astringent, but not at all unpleasant. It lingers long on the palate with some nice residual sweetness. Pretty drinkable, but not as much as some other dark lagers I have had. A surprising beer and one that I am glad I partook of.","zoso1967","Jun 25, 2010"

The color was off ivory with small tannish colors. Loose lace. Nice dark looking beer. Smells consist of cocco and roasted malts with a touch of peat/smoke and some caramel A small bit of grain, but i could be reaching there. Taste is slight toffee/ caramel, roast, slight coffee. Cocco powder and a little peat in taste. There's a little of everything here, even some earthy, floral hops hanging out back. Body is a bit thin although it looks bigger, Id say way less than medium. Carb comes through the lightish body quite easy. More smooth than crisp though. This is easy, I drank it quick and did not feel it in the least, 5% beer is alright with me. Will drink again.

Pours a dark char color with a cream head; nominal lacing. Lots of roasted malt character for the style with some pretty nice smoke notes as well. Just a hint of hop bitterness that balances the malt notes nicely. A bit less crispness than I was expecting, but the nose was still pretty pleasant. The body is pretty dense for the style with a nice smoke and roast quality to the malt. Although the hop qualities were not as pronounced to me as some other posts, enough bitterness was present to balance out the malt.

Roasted malt aroma, grains, sweetened coffee, brownie mix. Flavor is not as good, one-dimensionally roasty and a little ashy at the end. Some extremely dark chocolate creeps into the aftertaste as well. Body is too thin for sure.

Roasty aroma, black body with permanent off-white little head, with a great drinkability, and this is 10 minutes in the fridge on a warm day.

Very roasty aroma, almost coffee-like. This surprised me, not your average dark lager. The taste is also quite roasty, and there is a fairly earthy/hoppy presence as well. Add in some light bubblegum flavors, some more coffee notes, and a light chewy graininess and you have a pretty interesting beer. There is a bit of a fade on the finish. Grainy and medium-bodied in the mouth, I altogether found this to be a pleasant surprise.","Georgiabeer","Jun 15, 2009"

They share and compromise where they have to. The porter gets the appearance; it pours a dark, impenetrable brown with a red hue. Light, fluffy and wispy mocha head sits atop and stays for a short while. It shies away to a modest covering... like the morning dew on the grass, it is beautiful and noticeable and also delicate. Its aroma is dominated by roasted malts and coffee tones. The crispness and smooth lager qualities combine with the coffee and roastiness in the taste. It's an alliance, unlike China the the USSR in the 1950s, there is no ego war here. No ambivalence, just harmony. The mouthfeel is like listening to Bob Marley. Peaceful, jovial, pensive, mellow... but not Jamaican. The drinkability is superb...","ajr24","Apr 12, 2009"

Blacker than black and visibly thick as it generates a fat, dense, dark brown head when poured into the glass. Extreme roasted aromas are evident at a distance of three feet, and a balanced dose of roasted malt along with a hoppy bite as it goes down. Dense body but still quite drinkable, especially with the 5% ABV. As black lagers go, this one isn't-- at least, not compared with the others I've had. Stack this one up against Berkshire's Drayman's porter or even a good bottle from the UK. Definitely worth a try.","gfreed","Mar 31, 2009"

This is an extremely drinkable dark beer. I knew Port wouldn't let me down with this one. Grab one or two if ya see it around. Cheers","jamie2dope","May 06, 2008"
4.12,6.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"A well-made effort of an entirely underrated style shows considerably more complexity than a traditionally light-bodied lager. Its smoky nature lends itself to savoring only 1 or 2, but an enjoyable 1 or 2.","IBUnit63","Beers"
4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Served in my Oberon weizen glass. Poured an opaque black with ruby red highlights around the edges. One inch tan colored head eventually settled into a thin consistent skim of foam. Scents of chocolate and roasted malt. Some thin lacing with decent consistency present during the session. Nose consistent with flavors, as well as the presence of coffee and some lingering hops bitterness at the finish. Not quite medium-bodied, with a lively mouthfeel and a mild carbonation burn. Consistency is somewhat similar to a stout, but light enough to be sessionable. I've been drinking quite a few schwarzbiers lately, and this one is quite good; however, not the best I've had. A little to much lingering bitterness makes this less of a go to for me relative to the style.","Jwale73","0"

4.1,5.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I like this beer, and while I could drink several pints in a sitting, it might be wise to change it up as the flavor gets a bit one dimensional after while. Overall: Recommended...","bennetj17","Apr 26, 2008"
3.75,-3.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D: Pretty good, light alcohol and light feel make this sessionable, for sure. Flavor is pretty basic but solid. Don't have anything to compare this to, the closest I can get is a basic porter, and this is probably as good as any of those I've had. Doubt I would rush out to get this again (not that I'd be able to find it anyway), but a decent brew.","rxdrewthejew","Apr 23, 2008"
3.85,-0.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall, a nice take on the style. At 5.0%ABV, it's definitely got the makings of a good session beer.","Boilermaker88","Apr 16, 2008"
4.33,11.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall, I thought this one was outstanding. One of the lighter of the brews for LA and it still works very well. I could easily see myself drinking this on more then one occasion and I ma glad I bought a few more to enjoy. A quality ale here for sure that I would have to recommend you to pick up.","mikesgroove","Apr 15, 2008"
4.08,5.2,4,3.5,4,4,5,"Glad to see Port took a break from making all the strong beers and thought about some light stuff for once, not that anything they have ever done has been bad, will be drinking this again, good beer at a great price, recommended","Floydster","Apr 14, 2008"

4.3,10.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a full black with a creamy one finger tan head that quickly dies down to a thin layer of bubbles. Stickiness is very minimal, but some is there. Smell is of roasted grains, smoked barley, and some burnt popcorn. There are weak chocolate and caramel malt aromas in the nose as well. Taste is bitter coffee grinds and charred grains. Bitter earthy hops and scorched marshmallows on the tongue as well. Such a flavorful lager, perfect for this time of year. Somewhat dry and smokey in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light and soft with a steady carbonation. What a perfect session beer. Lots of flavor which leaves the taste buds begging for more. I wish I had more lower abv. beers like this in my fridge.","BeerTruth","Apr 13, 2008"
3.85,-0.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel and drinkability of this one are the strongest points. They call this one a session beer, and that's a great name for it.","Dukeofearl","Apr 12, 2008"

3.9,0.5,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Well carbonated, and thin mouthfeel. This wouldnt work for a stout or porter, but for a session lager it has a great mouthfeel. I think because it is a dark beer with a lot of the same flavors associated with stouts and porters people forget it isnt one and doc the mouthfeel for being too thin.. but that is why i like this one. A true 5% abv session beer that is full of flavor with out the alcohol to limit me to one. I could easily session this one all night, and at $3.99 a bomber it gets a good drinkability mark for me.","tayner","Apr 11, 2008"

4.05,4.4,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"22oz bomber bought at Walnut Liquorette, poured into a pint glass. Dark, opaque black with an ample brown head. Good chocolate and coffee aroma and flavors. Medium-light bodied, and very drinkable. Went through the whole bomber before I knew it! I wish I had more!","srroos","Apr 08, 2008"
3.99,2.8,3.5,4.5,3.5,3,5,"Bought from South Bay Liquor. Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Dark with a small brown head. Smells of chocolate and coffee. But in a soft way, not like a stout. Tastes exactly like it smells. Chocolate at first, then coffee, finishing with a slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is unfortunately on the thin side. Not a complex beer by any means, but extremely pleasant and very easy to drink.","throwitallaway","Apr 05, 2008"
4.35,12.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Recommended. I need to find out if this is a true schwarzbier (instincts say no), but at 5% this makes for a really flavorful session beer. This is most definitely worth a try.","rallison","Apr 02, 2008"
