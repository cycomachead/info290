"Overall: I'll admit, a lot (all) of why I got this was for the name, but it didn't disappoint. If Rick Moranis ever drops by, I'd gladly share this with him. Even measures, of course, after all: Your Schwarz is as big as mine!"

"Got a bottle of this in Charleston, SC at the brewery. Wasn't a huge fan of this, though not bad. Lots of rye and spices, some bread, grains, wheat, and toasted malts. Wouldn't seek it out again with their other offerings."

"Overall: overall this a well brewed and worthwhile schwarz, but it fails to stand out to much. the flavors are just a little lacking to really stand out. the mouthfeel and drinkability are the real highlight of th ebeer."
"Really tasty, enjoyable dark (light) lager!"

"Pours what looks to be an ebony black but is actually a clear deep brown with garnet hints when held to the light producing 1.5 fingers of frothy but mostly tightly bubbled, somewhat lasting, dark tan head that recedes to a solid cap leaving only a 1/2 inch of collar lace. Aroma is chocolate, dark roasted malts, fresh cut pumpernickel, toffee, caramel & a hint of smoke. Only a faint hint of dark fruit & rye is weak. Taste is similar with the addition of smoke, a burnt note & more & darker chocolate among the bread, dark malt, caramel & toffee. Slightly bitter, with only a little rye spice from mid-sip into the finish. Bitterness declines in the aftertaste which is rich with burnt/roast notes.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low-moderate carbonation, tongue coating creamy, silky & smooth."
"Solid beer, light bodied dark beer.  On a side note, may be the best bottle label ever.  May the Schwartz be with you!"

"Received a 22oz bottle (dated Sep 2014) in a recent trade. Really enjoyed this roasty and malty lager from Westbrook."

"Near black body, appearing mahogany at the edges. Small tan collar that leaves a touch of lacing in its wake. Aromas of chocolate, char, smoke - though not on the level of a rauchbier.  Dark toast, a hint of dark fruit. Lager yeast and rye bread come in mid to late palate. Solid."

"O: Good easy drinking brew, one I would suggest for people that need a gateway to dark beer drinking, very smooth and silky."

"I enjiyed this beer quite a bit. Lots of choc and smoky notes and dark color with a medium body that imply this will be a much boozier affair than it is. Almost a session. I would grab one or two of these each fall or winter assuming they dont jack the price."

"Been digging most of Westbrook's stuff, but the combination of flavors here just doesn't fit my foot right. Weird & average."

"An excellent Schwarzbier with lots of character. Well done, a lovely beer that I would highly recommend."

"Pours almost black with a thick head and long lasting lacing. Nose is of chocolate against a slightly sweet background with a hint of smoke. I could not detect any rye or hops in the nose. Light medium bodied and a smooth mouthfeel. Balanced carbonation typical of a lager. The taste is a fine balance of chocolate against a slightly sweet background with a tick of rye and smoke. An undertone of coffee is also present. Smooth finish of chocolate with a light rye spiciness and smoke that lingers. The lingering finish is where the coffee flavor is most evident. Very impressive."
""
"Pours a deep, warm coffee brown with a thick and rather persistent fine-bubbled tan head. Woody aroma has notes of coffee, semi-sweet chocolate, hay and caramel. Robust flavor has bold coffee, caramel, woody hop, and subtle licorice and horehound notes. Texture is smooth and fairly fizzy. Get your dark helmet on!"

"Overall: Being notably fuller in all its regards it is not exactly a classic, traditional schwartz. Still, it's a reasonably nice beer. Can't we just like nice beers?"

"O: Well, not being much of a lager fan - this could be my favorite lager ever! Quite enjoyable. I wish some German restaurants around me would have this one on tap."
""
""

"Thanks Doug, I style I like. This one somewhat coffeeish and dry, like an Irish stout. Some smoke. Black with reddish highlights and lacy"
""

"O â€“ This is a very tasty beer and another good one from Westbrook. This is my first schwarzbier but it fits the mold precisely. It amazes me how a beer can have such roasted malt character but still absolutely taste and feel like a lager. Charleston breweries are killing it right now."
"O: Very true to form Schwarzbier. Glad to have got my hands on this at Whole Foods in Columbia, SC while traveling through. Would like to try more by Westbrook."
""
""
""
"Overall, well worth a try."
"O: Quite enjoyable. I don't drink many in the style, but this one is just really easy drinking. The rye gives it a nice hint of spice that combined with the chocolate was tasty."
"(D)- Overall, a nice beer. Not positive if an infection is slowly showing its face or not but its so subtle it is not completely taking away full enjoyment from the beer just yet, but still annoying enough to bother me a bit."

"Overall: A really interesting take on the style; enjoyed the hops, the rye, the sweetness and the smoky elements"

"ark, rich looking dark brown with a small one inch head of off white that capped the top of the glass very, very nicely before it settled down leaving with it some nice lacing up and down the sides of the glass that seemed to really thicken up and push through as the time went on. Aroma is smoked malts right off the top. Dark, evil, with hints of campfire, peat, dark roasted chocolate and a good bit of almost a licorice touch to it. As I take the first sip a rich and creamy feel overloads the senses. Wonderful and rich, dark and foreboding, it seems that it is just meant to be evil and dark. Loads of roasted and smoked malts just rolling across the tongue. Lightly dry finish leaves just enough room for a small amount of smoky flavor to pop its head in and really give it a nice solid finish. great job"

"Why is Dark Helmet good? Schwarzbier is one of those rather obscure styles that never seems to get any attention, so it is a great thing for me that one is being made 2 hours from my house. This is an excellent twist on a classic style and one you should try. I wouldn't change a thing."

"Big thanks goes out to my boy caSSino for bringing this one to share with me! Served from bottle into a NoDa snifter. Poured a massively dark brown (almost black) with a one and a half finger tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, coffee, toffee, caramel, cream, dark chocolate, smoke, and dark fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, oatmeal, dark chocolate, coffee, smoke and subtle caramel. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The aroma on this one was quite inviting and pleasant. The flavor on this was a little surprising as the smoke comes through a lot more on the followthrough than it does in the aroma. A definite must try for fans of the style or the curious alike."

"Easily one of my favorite styles, a good Schwarzbier is hard to find, this one is good but tends toward the heavier end of the style, almost approaching porter territory."
""
"Growler fill from GBX in Greenville. Jet black with a nice 2 finger tan head. Spotty lacing. Smell is of coffee and figs. Not a lot to the smell. Taste is more in line with a porter than a schwartz, but that is not a bad thing. Different for the style, but has a touch of dull aftertaste that is distracting. Perhaps it's a growler thing, but I do like the ease of this beer and would consider it a session beer. Notes of coffee and some mild figs with some roasted malts on the end with a hop kick. Feel is more porter like as well, but a good bit of carbonation on this one. Overall- A pretty good effort and one I would hit again. It falls more in line with a porter/stout than a schwartz. Easy to drink and perhaps a bit too much hop on the end."
""
"O: A very well made beer that might not please fans of the classic schwarzbier style, but is definitely a worthy beer."
""
"I grabbed a can of their ipa just to contrast a 2nd style for Westbrook, if it's half as good I'll be satisfied."

"O: tried at boone's in charleston sc. Best draft ive had under 5$ in South Carolina. Definitely recommend valuewise and brand new keg on 11/20/11."
