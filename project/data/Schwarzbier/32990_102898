Pours into my SAPP a light root beer color with a multi-size bubble head that recedes quickly but doesn't lace.  On the taste this brew has a nice cocoa and roasted malt up front on the palate followed by an ever so slightly bitter metallic like middle and a sweet yet slightly chaulky bitter aftertaste.  A very easy drinker with albeit more flavor in my opinion than your run-of-the-mill lager.  A good sessioner, I would pick up again.","mooseisloose","Mar 03, 2015"

Nose of chocolate malts, light coffee, and roasted grains.  Flavors are chocolate malts to the front and sides, light coffee bitterness to the rear, with some roasted grain flavors following through on the aftertaste leaving a lightly bitter aftertaste blending with roasted coffee.

3.8,12.8,4,4,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 4/23/2014. Pours crystal clear reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light nuttiness, herbal, light fruits, and roast/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roast/bready malt and light hop/yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light nuttiness, herbal, light fruits, and roast/yeast earthiness. Slight earthy/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light nuttiness, and roast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of roast/bready malt and light hop/yeast ester flavors; with solid robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly bready/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good schwarzbier style. Nice complexity/balance and solid robustness of roast/bready malt and light hop/yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 06, 2014"

Anyway, this stuff pours a clear midnight garnet topped by a finger of glowing wan khaki foam. The nose comprises mildly roasted malts, cocoa powder, light coffee powder, toasted rye bread, and a touch of grass. The taste brings in more of the same, though the rye (now slightly less toasted, the underlying bread clearly visible) is now more potent and more upfront and self-confident. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a nice little schwarz, nothing truly special, but something I wouldn't mind occasionally indulging in.","TMoney2591","Jun 25, 2014"

I was just expecting a regular lager that happened to have a dark color. I was greatly surprised and pleased. On a hot day like today, it’s refreshing to get such flavor from a light-feeling beer.","StirbUndWerde","Jun 16, 2014"

The first one I tried seemed to be overly toasted, to the point of tasting like coffee that's been on the burner too long. I don't know if there's some variety between bottles, but this particular beer lacked the over-toasted, charred flavor, or perhaps the biscuit just balanced out the toastiness better.

This one is not a porter not a stout, but is trying to be both. However it's lower ABV and IBU's so its highly session-able, which is good. But at 10 bucks a sixer not so good. I would rather have my go to porter (Edmund Fitzgerald) which is a buck cheaper and worlds better. This was a good beer, but this black lager just makes me want a porter or stout.","Ohiolager","Apr 20, 2014"

Not bad at all. Seems to taste even better when wearing my BFM shirt and looking at FLBP. Smells and tastes kind of roasty. Has a nice drunkness effect after 4 or 5. Much better than any macro, but still perfectly drinkable. Dare I say it has ""drinkability""? Pick up a 6 and keep 5 for yourself, or fewer if you have more friends than me.

3,-11,3,3,3,3,3,"a collaboration with red hook, make your own judgments on their direction. a beer for the chive, which is apparently some college kid website, I don't know. what I do know, is that this brew is hopelessly average. its a dark amber color, not black, and has about an inch of caramel colored head, but it fades fast. light and easy drinking, the lager characteristics are quite pronounced, with just a medium roast on the malt, and a bit of a watered down vibe. easy enough to drink and not off in any way, but boring in terms of flavor. a little sweet, quick finish. one thing I will say for it though is that at least its a dark beer. I mean, there are enough crappy low budget college guy beers out there, I am glad they went a different direction with this, but it offers just a few of the elements of a truly craft black lager, or a german schwarzbier. this doesn't have any of the richness or the grain character, but it gets a passing low C grade from me.","StonedTrippin","Nov 16, 2013"

3.21,-4.7,3.75,3.25,3,3.5,3.25,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a deep mahogany amber with a fine, one finger very light tan head with good retention and lacing. Mild aroma of biscuit malt with bare hints of toastiness, similar to an average lager. Flavor also mild, light toasted biscuit malt, slightly sweet, finishes with a suggestion of grassy hops. Surprisingly medium body with hints of creaminess. A very subdued and bland schwarzbier, touching on but not grasping the elements of the style. An odd, mild astringency in the finish that would not have been a problem with a bit more robust flavor. Contract brewed by Redhook and the kind of safe, bland beer I've come to expect from them days. Since there were no reviews of this, I did some internet searching to try to find out more about this odd beer that someone at a craft beer store just gave me (I think it was a review bottle). Everything about it seems to be a sea of red flags. It is apparently a brewery launched as part a ""branding"" exercise for a website (The Chive) that specializes in boob photography (but in a ironic way, understand). I have nothing against boobs nor their photography, but it does not necessarily bode well that a ""craft"" beer was chosen as a adjunct to the project unless there is some brewing vision. They named themselves Resignation Brewery although there is no brewery and this is produced by Redhook. The choice of Redhook, which once, but no longer really has much craft beer following and has become rather pedestrian, is not promising. Then the website is simply a graphic of a running ostrich, that's it (branding!). NO text or information. Further internet research finds lots of news releases on the Chive group starting brewing, but virtually nothing beyond boilerplate about the beer or why they were motivated to start brewing beyond expanding the brand. Sorry, but brands without content or purpose are not of interest to me. So I guess if you are a Chive fan and appreciate the ironic premise of the site, this may well be an excellent brew to quaff while perusing the site. Otherwise treat it like any other Redhook beer or branding exercise. Not too bad for a mild intro level schwarzbier, no major flaws (as I would expect from Redhook). Otherwise, only Chive fans and sad ass tickers like me should apply here. It's worth checking the website right now for a great example of vacuous information.","LiquidAmber","0"
