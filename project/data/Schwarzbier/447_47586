The nose comprises cocoa powder and a kiss of roasted malts, both thoroughly intertwined (as much as they can be, given the mass discrepancy) and fairly faint. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a strong contingent of cola. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a nice little schwarz, though it's Irish-ness doesn't really come through (whatever that would mean, anyway).","TMoney2591","Nov 16, 2012"

Sure, I would prefer Kostritzer on tap but in the US this is not a real possibility. I actually prefer this beer to the original Kostritzer in the can or bottle and I can afford it as a retired beer lover. At a price point lower than most American adjunct lagers, this flavorful brew is affordable and readily available. Kudos to Pabst for making it available and affordable.","wattoclone","Sep 03, 2012"

4.29,22.6,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"It almost looks as if I have Coca-Cola in my mug rather than beer, with its similar , almost translucent deep brown color and thin fizzy head. The aroma is like that of a sweet stout - giving my nose the pleasure of milk chocolate, roasty malts, and a hint of grapefruit hops as well. The light bodied beer coats my mouth nicely with its oily mouthfeel, and as the beer traverses my palate, I begin to again notice a nice mix of sweet stout flavorings, and this time in the taste itself there is a definite pronounced hop bitterness, especially in the finish. This is an excellent everyday beer - very straightforward and mild. I am particularly fond of Schwartzbier, although this is no Kostritzer. Ultimately you really need to take a trip to McSorley's Old Ale House in NYC, get a table, and knock back a bunch of these with some rowdy friends!","Neorebel","Jul 06, 2012"

2.97,-15.1,2.5,3,3,3,3,"Guinness is my de facto standard beer for Irish drinking, but it casts its shadows on other up and coming Irish brews - similar in their dark and malty flavor delivered on a light palate, these beers sacrifice tradition and history for flavor and innovation. McSorley’s Irish Black Lager is the newest beer in this category. Like any other dark lager, it promises some of that dark maltiness in a refreshing beer - perfect for easy drinking with strong ale-like flavors. The smell resembles coke, with touches of raisins. The biggest difference between this and any kind of dark ale is the notable absence of fig aromas. That textured sweet smell is gone, leaving a dark yet simpler aroma, clear and clean through the nostrils, and inspiring clear headedness. This straightforward cleanliness paired with flavor is duplicated in the taste, where a nice, dark, roasted malty sweetness hovers along the palate, off-set by a kind of alkaline baseness. Complexity is shunted to the side in this easy drinking beer, itself a fine rival for my attention against Guinness. Guinness, however, continues to be my favorite beer for recipes that call for something dark and sudsy to enrich a dish.","GarrettB","Aug 22, 2011"

It wasn't as simple as was described to me, as just being a brew with the taste and smell of lager that just happened to be black. Naw, doesn't work like that, but McSorley's did manage to throw all of my senses together in an array of confusion. The color was indeed black, with little to no head or lace. The smell came up and grabbed my nostrils with a clean and crisp, simple oat-like malt, with a very plain and simple hop note. The taste echoed the smell with very little residual. I was on the fence with how I liked the feel of it, telling myself that maybe the black color of the brew was biasing my opinion of what the feel should be like, but it was that of a medium body, with a few harsh bubbles here and there draining down the sides of the palate, the refreshment hits in the middle-back of the tongue. I'd like to try McSorley's again, I think it has potential. Probably need more time and concentration to really get a feel for it.","mjw06","Jun 19, 2010"

Smelled a bit like cola syrup. Tasted was interesting. Reminded me of a combination of pumpernickel bread and black licorice. Very thin mouthfeel, with a weird fizz and an acrid aftertaste, like burnt coffee.

4,14.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a dark black with ruby highlights when held toward the light, head is light tan forms nicely with a sturdy pour into a tulip chalice from the dollar store. Aroma slight milk chocolate with roasted dark malts and light coffee characteristics. Flavor hits me with a wicked lactic sour note that I wasn't expecting, still has roasted malt dark chocolate with a hint of coffee but there's this wild ripe fruit note with the souring effect I didn't care for in a black lager, but it honestly reminds me of a lighter Stegmaier Porter in a weird way. I think they mixed this recipe with the Penn Dark recipe, because this looks moore like the Penn Dark of old than the newly bottled stuff from the Lion does. Really solid dark lager when said and done and after the slightly sour twang goes away it gets better with each sip. Mouthfeel is creamy with sturdy carbonation a very velvety feel to it all. Drinkability overall is quality impressed to see a decent beer coming from a McSorley's label I remember an Irish Red that was pretty shitty at one point in my drinking career.","WVbeergeek","Jul 18, 2009"

3.55,1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Flavor is nice. Not fantastic or full-bodied, but enough character with the roastiness, peaty malt and potent tanginess to keep me interested for the drink. Not too bitter, but definitely dry rather than sweet and malty. Tart hops. Carbonation was a little high for me, and the mouthfeel wasn't too persuasive. Overall, pretty good and very drinkable for the flavors it packs. Though, I could do without the hoaky McSorley's Ale House history and other gimmickry suggested by the label. Come on, it's a contract brew. But a good beer nonetheless.","dasenebler","May 19, 2009"
4.25,21.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"I think this is an exceptional find for any Irish stout lover. The overall characteristics are very similar to the Guinness 250 Anniversary edition brew. This has the same sourness that Guinness is synonymous with (especially the foreign or extra stout strains). While not as complex as Guinness foreign stout, it seems very similar to Guinness 250 edition. It has slightly more mouthfeel and slightly less maltiness (due to it being a black lager to be sure). If you find it cheaper then Guinness at your market, then this is a definite buy. I'm comparing this to Guinness simply because it seems to emulate it so much: it has the same basic acidity and maltiness of the recent 250 variety (IE it has more flavor then the Guinness draught versions but it's not as heavy as the ""foreign stout"" versions). The main thing that I like about this beer over other Irish ales is it seems to have the same Brettanomyces strains of sourness that I like in Guinness. This is the first time I've had a McSorley's, and from what I've gleened, this is a relatively new contract from Lion brewery. Will be interesting to see if this keeps going: I think it's good for what it is: a lighter Guinness foriegn stout.","dsr0116","May 17, 2009"

Head is moderate and drops quickly to a thin covering sheet. Nose isn't strong - coffee and some tobacco. Flavour is fairly smooth, somewhat acidic, a little bit fruity with a decent hop. Takes a while but burnt and coffee flavours appear as well. Dry with a moderate mouthfeel and a medium carbonation. Pretty smooth and NOT toasty for such a dark beer. FWIW though, easy drinking with some good balanced flavours and pretty accessible for beginners.","allergictomacros","Beers"

Smoky ""stout-like"" scent in the nose and in the initial taste, with a fairly rich dark malt flavor, though somewhat smoother (obviously, a lager) than a stout. Not quite as much of the rich, roasted flavor of a Schwarzbier, but very much like a quality Dunkel. A bit of astringent alcohol flavor emerges as the beer warms, reducing the ""drinkability"" rating a bit. Great offering, however. And thanks to ""N" for bringing it by.","tugdriver7","Mar 22, 2009"
