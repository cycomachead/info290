"This is a very average lager"

"smelled and tasted bad. Drain pour."
"I don’t quite know what’s going on here, but this is not the Blackened Voodoo I remember from 5-6 years ago, and it’s definitely not a schwarzbier.  The beer I remember was much darker and had a roastier profile (though still sweet), while this is paler and more one-dimensional (more like a marzen, really).  It’s not bad, but not what I was expecting."

"Pours a dark amber color. You would think with a name like Blackened it would be darker, was disappointed in this. smell and taste is your typical lager...a tad on the sweet side especially compared to what I'm used to."
"Wanted to revisit this one (Remember BEERS OF THE WORLD?) Kinda reminds me of Newcastle. I like the constant bubbly. Right on the edge of being too much but doesn't cross it ( you can keep all that Belgian or IPA swill). Me likes."

"Pours clear and on the lighter side for the style. Deep amber. Brilliant with clarity and a fat head of tan creamy foam that lasts a surprisingly long time and leaves lace.  Nose is rich with toasty malt. Nothing burnt, nothing roasted. No coffee, or chocolate. There is a luscious caramel and a bit of brown sugar.  Faintly on the nose is a tad, and I do mean just a tad of green apple.  It's perfect for the style and that hint of apple really adds brightness. There is also the modest whiff of noble hops but nothing really to  even talk about.  The taste is surprisingly sweet.  There is a richness and depth to the malt that is very pleasant. Bready with a bit of the crust, deep and complex sweetness. Caramel and brown sugar.  The green apple is so faint in the drink but provides a bit of crispness. The hops lean on to the palate a bit in the finish with a low amount of bitterness. This finishes with a little residual sweetness. My only complaint about this beer is that it finished with brown sugar and caramel to the point of being a bit too sweet, rather than the breadier , toastier sweetness to linger."

"Pours a transparent tan with good head and nice lacing. Smells of sweet malt and tastes the same WITH plenty of malt and bread. Sugar residual seems to be a little heavy on this one and causes the balance to be off with this lager.."

"Nice dark lager with a pinch of spice."
""

"The base is smooth, slightly sweet lager with a strong roasted overtone. The color it more red than black, with little to no head and light carbonation. I enjoyed it quite a bit."

"O: All malt dark lager is not my thing, but this was O.K. despite the smell."

"Pours a pretty cinnamon amber in color in color with a small off-white head. Some spotty lacing is seen which each sip. The aroma is very nice with roasted malts, caramel and toffee with brown sugar sweetness. The taste is actually pretty smooth with the above flavors mixing well together then followed by the brown sugar sweetness finish. Perfect carbonation. This is a different brew but tasty and has no harsh or bitter aftertaste. Really liked this one."

"BeerAdvocate lists this beer as a Schwarzbier. But considering the lack of roasted flavors (e.g., coffee, chocolate) that are associated with Schwarzbiers, I think it makes more sense to consider Blackened Voodoo Lager as a sweet, all-malt Munich Dunkel. Enjoy it with jerk chicken or creole shrimp."
"The waiter at Hwy 99 Blues Club suggested this one to me, drank straight out of the bottle so was not able to see the color. Boy was I surprised when I got home and found out it was from Louisiana. Ales are my Norm but I enjoyed this interesting Voodoo. Perhaps it was the setting of the Blues Club but I enjoyed this Brew and will look for it again."

"Overall I wasn't a big fan of this beer and I didn't think it was a good example of the style, it wasn't a bad beer, but it wasn't what I expected from the style and to me it tasted more like a brown ale or a bock, I think it missed the mark for the style. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was smooth and not too filling, but the taste didn't do a good job at holding my attention and I think one would be enough for me, I have no urge to drink another one in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel and appearance, they weren't the greatest but they still wound up being the highlights of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was how off it was for the style, this beer doesn't even compare to the last two Schwarzbier's I had and I don't think I would guess the correct style if I tried it blindly. I wouldn't buy this beer again and I wouldn't recommend it as a good Schwarzbier since I don't feel like it does a good job representing the style. All in all I wasn't impressed with this beer and it didn't make for a good first impression for Dixie Brewing company, it was pretty a forgettable especially for the style. Better luck next time guys, this beer need some major work. Of the the three Schwarzbier's I've tried this week this one was the worst and it wasn't even close."

"O: Not as complex or as good as some of the other schwarzbiers that I have tried in the past. Easy enough to drink and the alcohol is well hidden but I would not have more than one of these."

"This beer has the most unique taste I have tasted and it has a lovely smooth taste. The label is a great representation for the name of the beer and New Orleans."

"O- pretty easy drinking, unique flavor, worth a try. Better than drinking natty"

"Poured this Schwarzbier from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, poured a clear brownish color, produced an average white head, left some lacing on the glass. Decent retention. The aroma of the ale contains malted grain, carmel and pepper. Medium bodied, the foundation of the brew contained, malted grain, carmel and herbal hops. Overall, average example of the style."

"I'm not real fond of this one."
""
"There's enough here to recommend this an adequate training bra for novice schwarzbier drinkers, but for those with the practiced Minhas 'flavour' hunting senses, the alarms are more subtle here than usual, but they're still going off. We have the MCBSW Sales Company to thank for bringing this north of the border, closer to the corporate headquarters that has likely marred an otherwise traditionally enjoyable American standard."
""
"Poured from a 12oz (twistoff?) bottle into a pilsener glass. A darker red-orange; considerably lighter than other schwarzbiers I've seen, with a fluffy off-white head that dissipated over time leaving some slimy lacing. Smell is toasted malts, almost cracker-like. I'm no food scientist, but I'd guess that's a lot of the Maillard reaction I'm smelling. Taste followed the nose; sweet and toasted malts, rounding off with that smooth, crisp finish of a schwarzbier. Overall I was apprehensive at how different it looked for its style, but it satisfied just fine."
""
""
"O- First of this style that I have tried and I would try it again. Hard to distinguish from a Maerzen."
"I have to wonder if Dixie's beers were better once upon a time, as this one is really disappointing."

"Pours a clear dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt and some slight caramel notes. Taste is mainly of roasted malt with a caramel sweetness on the finish. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty decent beer flavor wise but I think the smell is better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours up a deep reddish-brown color with a one finger taupe head and some residual lacing. The smell is mainly roasted nuts and apples. Mouthfeel is okay, but nothing spectacular. Taste is very sweet and malty and the front end. The finish though, just doesn't overcome the malt. I'd like this one to be a little better balanced. Not too bad overall, just didn't expect it to be as sweet as it is."
""
""
""
""
"O - An excellent dark american-style lager. Easy to approach and good for most any occasion. Proof that ""dark"" is not a flavor."
"Taste is nice toasty-woody grain, rich toffee elements, bread crust sweetness, woody-herbal (almost minty) zesty bitterness in finish. It is complex, lively, engaging. Some elements are hard to pin down."
"Overall – Good tasting and very easy drinking. This makes for one tasty session beer."
""
""
""
"a better than average black lager. pours actually much more brown than black, surprisingly see through for the style, with a medium sized off white head. the smell is chocolate malts and brown sugar, very sweet smell, without any hops unfortunately. the flavor is a little sweet, but mostly just the dark complexion of well roasted malts and semisweet chocolate. there is a soda like carbonation and a very creamy feel, which do a lot for this beer i think. it takes some of the sweetness down, and lets the flavors of the malt expand a bit. there seems to be something missing though in this beer, and for me it was hops. even just a bit to bitter up the finish would have been a great addition. i wasnt at all in love with this, but its a tolerable brew."

"Overall - This beer wasn't bad tasting like I expected. The problem is that it tasted like nothing at all. I feel like I am drinking uncarbonated flavored water."
"Overall, a lot sweeter than anticipated. It lacks the typically dominant dark malt character of most schwarzbier examples. Possibly a bit of diacetyl is present. Not a bad brew, but not to style."

"Poured into a pint glass. The beer is clear dark caramel brown with a tall, biege head. There are a few bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass and the head dissipates slowly, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is of roasted malts and bready yeast. It smells slightly sweet, but also clean. There's a malty sweetness to this beer that is typical for Dixie. It's malty with some flavors of chocolate and the yeast. There are some bitter hops in the finish, but the flavor is rather mild. The aftertaste is mildly astringent. This is a light to medium bodied beer and the carbonation is fairly mild. The drinkability is very good. Overall, this is a very good beer. This is one of the first craft beers I ever tried and it helped get me started down the road towards better beer. Even though the old brewery is no longer in operation in New Orleans, I still raise my glass to Dixie."
"Decent beer, thought it would have some interesting character. This seemed to come up short."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep brown color, mostly clear, small fizzy head forms and recedes. Aroma of roasted slightly smokey malts, hops, cereal grains and a hint of alcohol. In the taste, roasted malt, sweet toffee and a light tang. Confused, lemony hop profile, and finishes with spritzy carbonation. Mouthfeel is light bodied and highly carbonated. Overall, a mainstream lager all the way, with some nice malt notes. Could be cleaner but not altogether bad."
""
"O- This is a very good beer! Light enough as to not be too cloying, yet with lots of flavor and well balanced at that! The alcohol is hidden well and this makes a good brew on it's own or with food. I highly recommend this one, and say this is another great job by the Dixie Brewing Co."

"O - I expected more black from this ""blackened"" lager. Tastes were hard to define. Seems like a beer stuck between styles."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium coppery amber. Thin fine off-white head dissipates to a thin film, decent lacing. Mild aroma of caramel and toasted malt, faint chocolate. Flavor is also mild; sweet and toasted malt, charred coffee, hint of chocolate. Finishes a bit abruptly with some astringency. Very subdued flavors, but what's there is sweet, well integrated and pleasant. Light bodied. I'm pleasantly surprised by this as I wasn't expecting much. I wish the flavor was more robust and had a better finish, but I'd try this again if it is available and I want a decent low ABV beer that is a bit on the sweet side."
""
""
"Overall very tasty and satisfying brew, one which had a nice bold roasty taste to it. Although I am not a big fan of this style, this one was quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Poured out a coppery amber in color with partial haziness and a short collar of sand colored head. Smells like partially burnt stale coffee mixed with a roasted porter-like malt profile, no real hopping detected in the nose. I really wish the coffee aroma (and flavor) was fresher. Flavor has the aforementioned stale burnt coffee with a squeeze of prune puree and a strange sort of off-putting acidity that rises up with the strangely-sweet for the style finish. Body is relatively watery and thin. I'm not really a big fan of this one. Seems as though it could use more hopping or at least a lower acridity level."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This used to be my go-to beer whenever I was in New Orleans. Blackened Voodoo turned me on to craft beer. It's even better now than I remembered. Could it be brewing in Wisconsin while the brewery is being rebuilt? Whatever, I love that malty taste and long for more strolls down those French Quarter streets. This one definately goes into my rotation!"

"O - A pretty tasty, sweet bread flavored ale. Not really dark enough to be a Schwarzbier in my book, but definitely unique and well balanced. This would make a great session beer for malt fans."
"O - I really like this beer. Complex enough to keep you from getting bored, and drinkable enough to down a sixer. One of my ""hey I'll just grab a sixer"" beers. I'll be probably be drinking this every so often until the day they stop making it."
""
""
""
"Light in body with medium carbonation. Good alternative from winter warmers as the style description indicates."
""
""
""
""
""

"Drink- I didnt remember having this one but I know I did. Came home and checked the speadsheet. Its gotta be the style. Just not a fan of smoke beers."
"Overall: a decent, if not outstanding, schwarzbier. I don't see myself seeking this one out again anytime soon, but it isn't bad at all."
""

"Pours a solid dark brown with ruby highlights when held to light, tightly bubbled white head displays moderate retention and lacing. Smells of caramel and toffee with a hint of chocolate and smoke. Little to no hop presence. Taste is mostly sweet dark sugars with maybe a hint of chocolate. Little to no hop flavor. Medium body and level of carbonation with a bubbly sweet mouthfeel. I remember trying this 15 years ago in Texas and hating it, basically my palette wasn't ready for this. Now that it is ready I'm basically bored by this mediocre brew, not much has changed."

"O: Really interesting and unique, but not for those afraid of the strange, or afraid to do a little voodoo."
"O - Not sure if this is fitting of the style or not, but it was a good beer, I would get it again. just not sure if I would appreciate it if I were expecting something to style."
"Reviewed from notes. Bottle poured into pint glass, not much smell save for the malt. Pours a nice dark caramel color with little head that dissipates fairly quickly. Nice malty mouth feel with a kiss of hops and a decent smack of alcohol for a 5% alcohol by volume beer. Of the Schwarzbier style that I've had this is another good one though nothing to make me search it out specifically. Good stuff, easy drinking with a meal or as a session."
"This beer from a bottle poured dark and somewhat dirty , nice lace and head. I could instantly smell a nice robust malty fruity odor and little hop. The taste hearty,almost like nut brown ale. Zesty flavor,and still clean even though my eyes are telling me different. I would highly recommnend this beer to anyone! The only thing I would change is the label."
"Overall this beer has met and exceeded any expectations I had of it. Quite a decent dark lager I wouldn't turn down if offered one and I would even buy a six pack occasionally. I suspect this beer would be great with some spicy Cajun dishes!"
"Overall – Definitely a decent beer that was quite drinkable, however it just wasn't very exciting or memorable. The taste is well balanced and I wouldn't turn one away if offered."
"Poured from the bottle into a plastic cup. Despite the name it’s not dark at all. It reminds me of a light lager: light straw colored, light body, light aromas, really light all around but with this sweet finish to it. Not cloyingly sweet but definitely noticeable, dominating even. I could picture sucking down three or four of these on a steamy, seamy night. But for now I’ll stick to just one."
"Notes: I was surprised to discover I'd never reviewed this beer before, as about 14, maybe 15 years ago, MRMOJORISIN used to show up at my apartment in Guilderland, NY, with loads of this beer. It was one of my earlier craft beers, and we used to drink plenty of it while listening to tunes, grilling and hanging out. Good times. Good beer."
"A pretty good beer overall, but not as good as the other kind I had (Abita Turbodog)."
"Surprised by this highly drinkable, light-yet-malty beer. Very similar to a brown ale in my opinion. I am an instant fan of this brew."
"Overall: It is a good lager, and took me wholly by surprise. I still feel like Voodoo has missed an opportunity to make a a truly fantastic brew. The flavors should be just a bit big bigger, and so should the mouth feel. A little less wimp, and this would have been a, AHEM, magical beer."
"The CPJ"
"It has a roasted malt aroma. There is a nice off-white head over a brown body. The flavor is strong with roasted malt with a chocolaty bitterness and sweet toffee tones. The aftertaste is somewhat metallic. There is a bit of carbonation burn to the body but not much. For the most part the mouthfeel is thin. I think this is one of their better beers."
"Even the alcohol barely seemed noticeable here. I'm sure it could be felt after a few of these were downed but as for one bottle, the flavors and attempt at spice are pretty mellow, as well as all that one will feel from this. While this isn't anything outstanding, it's crafted well enough that even the novice beer drinker will enjoy this, as this beer is a textbook example of the style."
"Overall Drinkability - Great light body, but still strong and flavorful beer with some balance of hop and malt characters."
"Good, easy drinkin light body dark beer"
"O My buddy who is not a big craft brew guy wanted me to try this because it's one of his favorite beers. I laughed and said sure, why not. I really wasn't expecting much from this beer, but I was actually surprised on how much I liked it. It's not a bad beer. Probably would not seek it out, but it's not bad."
"Beer is a little more buttery than I remember. It is medium in body and sweet slightly. The finish is mild and not too bitter. I guess I'm bored, not too interesting overall. Oh well."
"Toss up between C+ and B-. Is there a B-+? Like a 2.75?"
"I really enjoyed this offering and would recommend to anyone to try. Very tasty and flavorful."
"Poured from a standard bottle into a glass. Beer was just average. Not much smell or notable flavor profile, actually quite bland although a little spicy. Small head after pour, but not much lacing. Color was a dark reddish-brown with smooth mouth-feel. Maybe its because I prefer ales to lagers, but I was not impressed."
"Overall: Great! Not entirely sure it should be a Schwarzbier (I'd call it a spiced beer) but hey, it's good."
"O: Decent. 3.5"
"This brew pours out at a dark brown similar to a cola color. The head is a tan color that fades quickly. The smell of the beer is roasted with some grassy lager aromas lingering in the background. The taste reminds me or a Beck's Dark a little bit, it's bitter in the aftertaste but kind of sweet upfront with a toasted caramel flavor. The mouthfeel isn't heavy, it's actually on the lighter side. Overall it's an interesting brew but not something I'd buy a case of."
"I think that this is mislabeled as a schwarzbier, cause it makes a mighty fine dunkel. Not too bad for the price, either."
"O- Overall, not too bad, and great as a session beer, but with a name like Blackened Voodoo, I was expecting something more."
"(12oz bottle). Pours a clear dark amber color with off-white head. Decent carbonation. Aroma has some caramel, syrup, and corn. Taste is sweet like caramel with a bit of a metallic note and some light bittering hops on the end. Medium bodied with a creamy texture. Finish is slightly bitter. The caramel sweetness makes this one work for me although the metallic aspect loses it some points. Really, not a bad beer and very easy to drink. Tastes much better than it smells. Yeah, I would drink it again."
"Overall, I would rate above average, good dark beer."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the malty, somewhat roasty aroma. It had the nice beginnings of a Schwarzbier in the nose, but became underwhelming once the drinker got to the taste. It was “loose”, and none of the flavors really broke out to give any boldness of flavor."
"O: A nice beer. Very drinkable. Balanced. i would buy it again."
"Overall: Very approachable, if you don't mind the sweetness; a Schwarzbier??? - I don't think so"
"O: Overall, this is a tasty beer, but it's not particularly memorable. The alcohol is hidden well, but it's has a little bit of watery-ness to it that's a little bit disappointing."
"There's really not much else to write."
"Beer has strong toffee smells and tastes. It can be, and I have made it into a great session beer."
"Pours a medium brown color that is dark enough you can't see through the glass. Slight carbonation but ends rather quickly. Has a rather decent scent of some roasted malts. The roasted malt taste hits your tongue right away for an overall mild taste. A little too light in texture considering the taste. Drinks rather fast with not much of an aftertaste. Certainly worthy."
"D: It's not really my style, but it's fine, I don't think it's necessarily something that's worth it's price, when a yeungling black and tan is cheaper, and about the same."
"I'm not entirely sure what the point of this beer is. It is named like a 40oz malt beverage, tastes like a weak black lager and has a historical significance behind it but I really do not know what it is telling me and I would recommend you skip it."
"Of the beers that come from the New Orleans area, this is about one of my favorites. Had plenty of these walking down Canal Street. Not some ""must have"" beer but a fun brew."
"All in all, not a bad beer, but nothing like what I expected and looked forward to."
"T: A lot of malt and that's pretty much it. Slight caramel sweetness, a bit of coffee and some creaminess. A bit too much carbonation in here for me. I felt like there were more flavors in here but they couldn't escape the carbonation."
" Finally, drinking wise, the beer has a java stout taste that one asks Dear Starbucks: May I recommend adding this drink to your menu! Our group wasn't sure of the ""lager"" label given to the beer."
"Personally I found the combination of smell and flavor to be the real killers here. I'm sure this beer has fans, but I am not one and I can't believe the average beer enthusiast would be one either. Overall, it strikes me as a session beer when it doesn't need to be."
"MF/D- A lighter body on this one, which is on par with the style, as well as the carbonation levels and how well the flavors linger. As for drinkability, it's an OK beer, but not up there with the better examples of the style. Picked this up for my wife cause she remembered drinking it in New Orleans in the mid-90's, but don't think we'll pick it up again. Wouldn't turn it down if offered, but wouldn't have another."
"Pours a dark, mahogany-red. A creamy, tan head laces the glass sides with microbubbles. Plenty of carbonation coming up as well. Smell is a delightful toasted malt, with equal parts coffee/ toffee. Taste is refined, sort of minerally and of darkish fruit. A tinge of alcohol. A bit of bitterness at the end, but mostly this is a sweet beer. Feel is active and carbonated. Drinks good; I like it."
"D: The beer is easy to drink, although I'm not sure if I would have more than one of these in a night because the taste lacks complexity."
"Drinkability - I would only have one and then swithch to something a little more robust. There is an astrigent flavor that lingers on the tongue."
"From notes at Old Chicago (2002): Pours thinly to burnt caramel color. Bready honey and maple syrup aroma; lightly pungent with cloying sugar and high fructose corn syrup. A bit of cinnamon toward the back. Flavors of wet old wood and flat lemon and lime soda; lightly tart, softly bitter, and very bored. Tacky, sticky, and thin in the mouth; mild, sugary berries in the dry finish. Altogether, unpleasant."
"Not recommended."
"Overall an interesting brew. Probably won't be a regular in my 'fridge but I'm sure I'll be in the mood for it occasionally."
"D- Not the best, but drinakable. Average."
"That being said I always favored the company's beer Crimson Voodoo, going to try to see if thats still being brewed."
"Sweet to the taste for a lager. Dark and rich but not overly heavy. Moderate alcohol content in a german dunkel lager fashion."
"Summary - Not a go to beer, but a little above average."
"drinkability- fairly nice, good after taste. Its smoothe enough to just keep drinking while relaxing"
"As I twisted off the cap I had low expectations, but I am proud to say that this brew is all right. The taste is a little week compared to other Dunkels like Haufbrau and the like, but for the price of an average american six pack this one is pretty quaffable."
"D: On the lighter side for a roasty beer. Not a fan of the raisin-like sweetness in beers, and this one has it. Was able to enjoy thoroughly enjoy it though."
"It's mild and drinkable enough, but I'm not getting a lot of character from it, and it feels very lacking on the mid where the excitement is supposed to happen."
"A surprisingly heavy beer on the palate, and overall. It's not bad to sip, and surprisingly easy to drink for all its gravity, but it's a beer that needs to be mulled over, chewed and sampled in small doses."
"Note the brewery may be Louisiana in origin but the label says it actually was brewed in Joseph Huber Brewing in Wisconsin due to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. So cool in several ways."
"Poured a clear dark amber with a nice creamy tan head with desent lacing. Aromas of sweet malts, carmel, coffee with a hint of citrus. Strong malty sweetness on the palate with coffee notes. One of the better tasting brews from the deep south with a fair amount of carbonation. Good Job! Two thumbs up."
"Try it, you'll like it!!!"
"I wasn't extremely impressed with this beer. By all means it was an above average beer here in Lawrenceburg, IN! Our local selection is growing but it still isn't as large and accessible as I'd like it to be. I had this one about 2 nights ago while watching some old episodes of Dexter... it was good but I found myself wanting to reach in the fridge and get something like an Edmund Fitzgerald or Sierra Nevada Stout... both which aren't in this line but still all the same this beer just lacked in taste compared to what I have been drinking."
"Kind of like the lager version of Abitas Turbodog but with a lighter body and even sweeter finish. Not a bad beer and very food friendly but not really up the standards of todays craft beers. Seems a little weak and simple but still a very drinkable beer"
"A quite drinkable beer that doesn't excite in any way."
"D - very drinkable if you don't get tired of the flavor"
"The beer pours a hazy chocolate-brown color with a tan colored head. The aroma is tea, earthy hops and toffee. The flavor is toffee, chocolate, earthy hops and dirt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not a bad beer, but nothing too terribly exciting."
"I didnt even know we could get this in Columbus, really I dont care too much. I wont be having this much anymore that I dont have to go to Huntington so much nowadays."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with no lot code or expiration date. The pour is a good looking amber-brown with almost no head. The aroma tends to be sweeter with an emphasis on the malts. The taste is also more malty than anything else with a notable sweetness as well as a few raisins in the mix. Not bad and it seems to be true to the style."
"D - not unless I become a fan of the genre, whatever that may be."
"Taste, thinner than it looks. Light on palate, yet fuller taste profile, resonates on the tongue without beating it up. Has a very thin porter taste to it. Would never guess it was a lager. A little bit of sweetness with it. Cool artwork, but the impression the beer leaves makes me think this is more of a gimmick or touristy thing."
"D - like whoa. Could have another right now. If you're in New Orleans, try it out!"
"D - High. I enjoyed this one. Have a few."
"I was suggested this beer by a friend's brother, and by a Manager at my local grocery. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was so I'm glad I picked up a 6-pack."
"what tasted like a lager with added sweet syrup. looked exactly like coca cola. even down to the dissipating head. taste of sugar and roasted sugar cane. had a added after brewing quality to it. actually even tasted like coca cola. some fruit but mostly apple earth being drown out by syrup."
"Drinkability: The butter and nut flavors seem to dominate the beer for me, and make it fairly unpleasant to drink very much of."
"Mouthfeel is light with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"I've had black lagers but this is a black hole, perhaps technically a lager in how it was made but more like a light porter in taste. Smells of chocolate, toffee, tastes exactly the same. Meh, maybe it's unique but I don't get what this beer is trying to be."
"Translucent dark cherry with a good layer of foam. The smell was not very strong but had a good aroma of malts and toffee. The taste was surprisingly good. It had a solid malty foundation with hints of caramel. It was on the lighter side of the ""dunkel"" spectrum. It was very easy to drink and I would encourage people to try it. This is a beer I would buy again."
"D: Very, Very drinkable a nice brew which even though ABV is 5% still a bit high for a session for me but could enjoy it many times over. Would be really great on cold winter night, sitting around the fire in the fall."
"Another fine product of Dixieland."
"I like this beer. I think it is very drinkable. I wish it were a bit softer than it is in the mouthfeel and taste, but I do like it."
"Given a choice, I'd pick Negra Modelo (from Mexico) over it, but at least now I've tried this one and urge you to do the same."
"Medium-bodied with a syrupy thick sensation after the swallow. An overall very good Dunkeles."
"Pint glass pour and I am met with a flat cola brown ale with a white foamy head which starts strong but dissipates rather quickly. The aroma is a malt bomb explosion. Very malty with some hints of roastiness and some faint citrus. Very surprised by the clean, crisp, malty taste. I was expecting something rather drab but this has some pretty nice flavor. The malt is there and there is some leather and black coffee characteristics. Mild carbonation. At 5% this could be rather enjoyable session beer with some spicy foods or a nice big pretzel and schnitzel. Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. Not the greatest beer out there, but worthy of an individual try."
"M/D: Bubbly & thin, but quaffable."
"It's not hard to drink at all, I just wish it tasted better."
"Overall, it's a fairly pleasant beer with caramel, cocoa powder, mocha, hazelnut, marshmallow notes, and chocolate tea cookie. A lot of sweet malt flavors without being too sweet."
"::I wake up in the morning, quite hungover, stumble to the coffee machine. Damnit there is coffee from yesterday...oh well, pour the coffee toss some ice on top and take a sip....I place the glass down and forget about it for about an hour. Come back it is not sort-a brownish since it is watered down, take a sip....and ahhh it taste just like Dixie Blackend Voodoo Lager.:: I Expected bigger and blacker (Warren Sapp like qualities)....but didn't get it (Steve Urkel like qualities). Ohh well. Safe to say that this will also be the last Dixie we try. If someone was to rebottle this with an Abita (another New Orleans brewery) bottle I don't think I would ever second guess where it came from. Weak try....nothing special here."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. The beer pours a small head, that is, although small, long sustaining. There's some nice lacing around the edge. It pours a dark amber color. The appearance is, unfortunately, my favorite part of this beer. It has a bit of a smoky odor to it, with just a bit of an alcohol scent underneath. Not a whole lot of taste here, maybe a slight bit of nut somewhere in here. It has a light mouthfeel, which adds to a pretty high drinkabililty. I could drink these all day and if this style is your thing (obviously, it's not really mine), this would make a pretty great session beer."
"Can't hold a candle to the better versions of the style, but I wouldn't go so far to say that it is mediocre - a decent casual lager, perfect for ""watching the game"" or whatever..."
"Over all I was initially disappointed in this beer. This was mainly due to my craving for Victory though. This beer is very drinkable and makes a good session beer. It's actually kind of refreshing, but I'm always disappointed when the flavor doesn't linger. I did drink it during the Super Bowl and the Saints won, so maybe there's something to the Voodoo..."
"Taste is a bit odd, got some smokiness and light boozy, it also has that home brew wheaty twang too it. Not super drinkable because of this."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of chocolate malts. Taste is good, chocolate, malts, some notes of coffee, very flavorful. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a fine quality beer."
"D: I'd get this again. It's pretty unique, in my opinion."
"RJT"
"D - I enjoyed it but its nothing special."
"Drinkability - This is an excellent-drinking Munich. Of the few American efforts I've had of the dunkles lager I think only Penn's tops this one. Nicely done."
"Medium body and medium carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good here, very easy to go through. Better than I had expected but not special. I won't be seeking these out, but I wouldn't turn one down."
"Pretty drinkable, overall its good beer, but nothing special. If you happen upon it, give it a shot, but other than that I wouldn't search too hard for it."
"Thanks to BigBry for a taste of the south!"
"The flavor is predominantly malty with hints of caramel at first. It does wash over the palate a little quickly, which makes you realize that this is actually a lager. There's also a nice fizzy carbonation to go with the deep flavors. The hops and dryness come into play more around the finish, and the beer rounds out a little coffee-like."
"Drinks easily, a nice one to try and I will have to get it on tap at my local southern eateries. Doesn't knock off any socks, but will pair nicely with some okra."
"You can drink these all night. Its not world class by far, but its definitely good enough to satisfy."
"Dark amber body. The beer pours with a flask of off-white foam that quickly fades to just about nothing. Aroma has a caramel and molasses note. Actually very nice. Flavor is pretty mild and balanced at first. The carbonation attacks the back of the throat but is very smooth on the tongue. Some black patent flavor and astringency, a hint of sweetness on the finish, then a lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is ok - feels somewhat coarse due to the aggressive carbonation. Drinkability- also OK. Much better than many beers, but not something I'd pick on a regular basis."
"D- Really exceeded expectations with enough complexity to enjoy"
"This beer has a great feel as it goes down. Voodoo is very enjoyable with fried tortillas and home made salsa..."
"D: Very drinkable, great balance of full flavor and light body."
"T- Very smokey with a licorice taste to it, but it very carbonated rather than smooth, as most smokey beers that I've had have been accustomed to. Has a nice little bite to it."
"Poured a deep amber/brown with a modest head that quickly dissipated to a thin collar. The aroma was lightly malty, not much else. The taste was watery, sweet and bitter, but not enough of either to make a statement. The feel was just plain weak, but with adequate carbonation. Drinkability was good. I wouldn't be ashamed to say I liked this beer, it's just way down the list. Reminded me of some of the lesser porters I have had."
"overall okay for a munich dunkel or schwarzbier."
"Anyway if you like beer thats sweeter and more malty, give Blackened Voodoo A try, it may surprise you to."
"Deep amber/garnet in color, clear, with a cream/tan head that quickly dissipated. Aroma has notes of cherry, plum, and caramel malt. Oddly reminds me of a cherry slurpy from 7-eleven. Flavor is sweet up front with fruit (cherry, plum) followed by caramel malt, with little to no discernible hop character. Taste is not unlike a bock beer. Also tastes a bit like a black-cherry soda. Body is light to medium with medium-high carbonation that tickles the tongue. Again, somewhat like soda. Overall, a very tasty offering, but too much like soda for my taste. Probably a good beer for non-craft drinkers to begin with."
"A clear dark brown pour with a small light tan head , some jagged lacing left . Aroma is slightly metallic with some caramel malt and a hint of nuttyness . Flavor is of roasted malt , light caramel , grass and grain, very light on the hops. Light body with a slightly prickly mouthfeel from the crabonation . A fairly good offering that is quite sessionable ."
"Pours a dark amber color almost a dark brown with a tan colored head. The smell is of malts, sweet bread and fruit notes, maybe raisin in smell. The taste is of a sweet malts, breads, and some fruit with raisins and a little bit of a floral hop taste. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and a little bit slick. Overall it is a very drinkable beer, it goes down smooth and is a slightly complex beer."
"Drinkability - very drinkable...."
"This is one of the beers I got started with when first trying microbrews in college. I remember the Old Chicago in Coralville, IA used to have it on the menu. I haven't drank one in several years, and I was under the assumption that I wouldn't think much of it anymore. However, it suprised me. I think the malty complexity is pretty good for a 5% ABV lager. Try it with an open mind..."
"Notes: It's a nice overall dark lager with a good balance of hops and malt. It reminded me of a light bodied, thinner Oktoberfest beer."
"Don't drink and review."
"Flavor is a bit watered down, but if they are going for a lager style I don't mind so much. Crisp clean finish. Could drink any time of year and could drink several. Very easy to drink and would probably be a good gateway beer for people. Cool bottle by the way. I would drink again when I get the chance."
"Finishes slightly sweet with just a hint of herbal hops. Medium bodied, smooth and easily drinkable."
"It pours an orange amber with an inch or so of head. It looks like most munich lagers I've seen. The aroma is tough to pick up since they poured it into a frosty mug but I'm getting a bit of roast malt and caramel. The taste is malty with hints of chocolate and tang of fruit. It seems to wash down the amazing crab cakes I'm eating so the mouthfeel is getting a decent grade from me. I could see drinking this beer again although I'm not going to seek it out."
"Rich malt in the aroma, and it tastes toasted with grain in the quaff. Lots of doughy bread notes remind me of an amber ale more than any lager. But that's just me. This is one robust and rich tasting brew, very tasty - although I don't know if I could plow through a sixer at a sitting."
"Blackened Voodoo is a crystal clear, deep reddish brown lager with a dense tan head that has nice retention and lacing. It has a clean, fresh malt aroma with roasty chocolate notes. It is medium-light bodied and smooth; pretty creamy with a dry finish. It's a simple, well balanced flavor with notes of burnt sugar and spice. This is an awesome session beer."
"The beer poured with a nice head which quickly flattened, the color was a dark reddish brown and nice lacing was left on the glass. I enjoyed the slightly sweet caramel nose which matched its flavor along with a slight roastiness. Its mouthfeel was light and carbonated and overall for a lager I found this beer enjoyable and very drinkable."
"My second review with the same score across the board. Poured a deep brown color with some red tinting and almost no head that left no lacing. Smelled very malty with caramel, toffee, and fruit notes and just a hint of coffee. Tasted the same with some roastiness to it. Smooth, though just slightly oily. Could session this pretty easily."
"This is an okay beer. It tastes reasonable and is palatable but does not seem to hit the spot overall. It could be more intense in several realms but is still worth the try."
"Color is dark brown with some slight cherry hues. The two-finger tan head sticks nicely to the pilsner glass, recedes slowly, and leaves some fat fingers of lacing behind. Smells of some roasted and caramel malts. Subtle hops exist later on. The smell was promising, but the taste is weak. Not much at all going on except perhaps some more toasted malts and an underlying sweetness. There is a slight hop bite at the very end. Light bodied as expected and highly drinkable, so much as to leave you wanting more. It's just missing some much needed work in the taste department."
"Drinkability: This beer has some drinkability, but not much. I don't expect I'll be looking for this beer in the future."
"This Southern brew pours an old brick red with a fizzy and thin white head on it. Aroma is very sweet, some brown sugar and cookies mixed with some dark fruit. Taste is malty but proves to be more balanced, not much sweetness there. There's no real bitterness, but the sweetness is certainly curtailed by something. Some light hints of vanilla before it hits a roasted malty end. Proves very refreshing, but this brew doesn't carry a lot of body and is a tad thin. All in all a solid brew, but there's not much outstanding here. May be better on tap."
"D - Average at best. There may be some traces of fusels in this beer. Very medicinal."
"d: Sweeter than I like, this just wasn't for me."
"Drinkability is average. This isn't bad, just really average."
"I was suprised to find Dixie beers in Maryland. I picked up a sample of Dixie Beer and this one. Poured a one and a half finger head. Caramel brown color. Foamy head with some lacing on the glass. Sweet malty smell and taste. A regional brewer tries something a little different. A solid effort. This reminds me a little of Yuengling Black and Tan."
"Nice crisp begining and middle, with a smooth almost cloying sweet aftertaste. Getting some metallic and chewiness that really just turns me away. It's drinkable enough, but not something I would get again."
"Nice medium body, good viscous feel, really and all around nice, nice beer. Glad to have the chance to try it."
"All of that said, it's certainly sessionable. Tastier than Michelob."
"T/M: Definatly has some malt in it but not as roastedness as either the name or smell would suggest. Has a bit of a watery middle and mouthfeel does suffer sum as a result of its lower than average carbonation. Has a very nice citrus/acidic end. Except for the watery middle this tastes and feels like a very high quality brew. It does lack some of the yeasty breadyness of the dunkel catagory. I think it should be more of a dark rich lager. Very good no matter the catagory its in"
"A nice and somewhat unique-tasting lager. Personally if I want a black lager I'd go for something more like a Schwarzbier, but I wouldn't mind getting this again."
"D = Even with the mouthfeel giving a little too much this one does go down easily, and is quite flavorful for its body and strength. This would be a really good beer to have a couple of while hanging out talking to friends."
"Not a bad beer, would drink another."
"Pours a nice dark brown color with amber/copper sparkles, some nice head, and some good lacing. Sweet scent, very malty, nice but unbalanced. Great taste, good malt flavors going in, with a nice little hint of caramal, and a nice spike of German hops at the end to even things out. Goes down fine, if a little overcarbonated."
"Drinkability: I am not a seasonal drinker, but this beer screamed autumn to me. I sort of see it like a fizzier slightly less strong version of Leinenkugel's fireside nut brown. A good beer, not great, that I could session--if the time was right."
"drinkability - Not a bad beer, thought it was going to be a chocolate beer/lager. Worth a try.Easy drinking."
"Decent drinkability. Nothing special."
"A good take on a Munich Dunkel. One of the better ones I've had in the states."
"I've not had many beers in this style, but I'm willing to venture that they all don't taste this strongly of coffee. Don't get me wrong, I like me some good coffee beers, but seeing as this was not advertised as such, I was sort of expecting a bit more depth of flavor. That said, it makes a decent session beer and is quite enjoyable once you adjust your expectations. The jury's still out on whether I'll buy this again."
"Pours a nice clear mahogany brown, and doesn't have much of a head - the foam dissipates fairly quickly. Aroma is fairly strong, smoky with undertones of malt and yeast. Flavor is typically lagerish, but has a firm smoky component, and hints of yeast. Texture is smooth and fizzy, a little on the thin side but not a downer. Not a great beer, but worth giving a try."
"Drinkability: Decent beer. This one needs some more complexity and has a weird finish that falls flat. Not bad."
"Pours a nice mahogany color with a tiny little head to it and minimal lacing. Smell is very European-like.. almost a Beck's Dark sort of smell to it. Taste is very nutty and bready, again the German-ness of the beer really shines through. Beer is a tad bit watery in the mouth, but has a decent amount of flavor and is easy enough to drink. Nothing great, but pretty good."
"Toasty malts and hop bitterness really carry this beer. Does not exactly fit into what I normally think of as a dunkel, seems more like an American amber to me. Whatever it is, it's quite a flavorful and complex little lager Dixie's got going on. Some mild hints of light berries, maybe raspberries and strawberries, along with a bit of tobacco keeps things interesting. Not bad, not bad at all."
"Dark brown with red highlights. One finger of light tan head. Fair lacings. Aroma is caramel, smokey malts. Taste is dark malts, some light smoke, a little molasses, and a fair amount of hop bitterness. Easy drinking beer. Impressive flavor after having a Dixie lager."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0902-Geoff"
"Had a bottle this past Sunday with lunch at Sunset Cantina on Comm Ave. Poured into a standard pint glass. Medium brown color. Decent sized head at first, then gone quickly. Good amount of carbonation noticeable. Smelled a bit like dried fruits, such as grapes and figs. Taste was interesting for a lager from Louisiana. A little bit fruity, but very malty. A bit on the thin side, a tad watery. Lowers my score for mouthfeel, but doesn't affect drinkability too much as this was a smooth drinking beer. I could see this as a nice change-of-pace beer in the oppressive heat of the Deep South. Light, smooth, but with some flavor."
"D- A decent session beer but the flavors dont make for a 6 or more pound back. Nice for a change of pace."
"Although this brew is the first Dixie beer that I've tried, I dont think Ill be coming back to this brewery. It is an appealing label and has a unique name, but there is really NO body to this brew..."
"all in all, neither horrible nor pleasurable. The carbonation issue detracts from something that would otherwise be fairly average with few bright points. Not far from the style, but not exactly a shining example. wouldn't really want to drink this one again... just a bit lackluster and unforgettable."
"I guess you can drink alot of these, but I would just buy a single to try it. Great marketing and packaging. Bee a good 10-15 years since I had this (and its bastard cousin, Reddened Voodoo). Was a unique brew back then, not so much now. At this pace, the next time I have this I'll be in my 60's."
"M/D - overall not a very good tasting beer in my opinion. The overwhelming cooked vegetable smell and taste just kind of ruined it for me."
"Drinkability: Much better than their flagship ""Dixie"" beer. Easy drinking."
"Reddish brown body, thin cap of off-white foam. Some slow carbonation is visible. Faintly sweet and caramel-tinged malt aroma. Taste is more caramel, brown sugar, buttery diacetyl, faintly herbal. Sort of playing it safe in the flavor deparment. Mild carbonation, lighter feel, dry and lightly sweet finish. Easy enough to have one to pair with cajun cuisine, but I didn't really feel the need for another."
"An okay MDL, but not up to par with what they make in Germany. Worth a try, but not the model."
"The taste is a definite let down. The beer is much less sweet, more drying, more metallic, and more musty than I ever remembered it. I recalled a rather pronounced molasses and roasted notes to this beer. Now, the beer is just musty, dry metallic, arid caramel. This is an okay beer, but nothing I would go back to. One trip down memory lane is enough, unless of course the old recipe comes back. The mouthfeel on this beer is like a parched desert."
"The flavor is a bit of a letdown after that amazing smell. It's malty and little dry...average. The chocolate/caramel flavors do appear as the beer warms, but they vanish quickly...almost like magic. Larger drinks can reveal some added complexity."
"Pass."
"D: It's drinkable, but you could find dozens (if not hundreds) of better beers out there. Always tastes better in New Orleans for some reason. ;)"
"This pours a very dark cherry red with a nice light brown cap that leaves some thin,spotty lace. The nose is malty with some extremely subtle floral notes,not a big nose here. The flavors are medium roasted malts that taste like nearly burnt oat bread. Caramel and hints of candy and licorice are nice and unassuming,yet give this a nice flavor and complexity. A dry cocoa powder finish rounds off a decent attempt at a Dark Lager. The carbonation mellows rapidly and helps drinkability. This is a step in the right direction and is better than Dixie Lager, good to see they can brew outside of the transparent yellow box."
"Good stuff. Pours dark brown with red highlights and a short off-white head. Subtle malty aroma, kind of roasty. Sweet, hoppy lager with plenty of malt. Nice finish. Always had this with bbq chicken while in Virginia. Haven't tried it since moving. May have been the atmosphere, but I remember this as being a nice, easy beer."
"D: This is an underdone beer. It didn't strike me as being very inspired."
"Notes - Overall, not too complex and a little thin, however, what is present works pretty well together. A nice change from my usual style of choice for a session (APA). Glad I got the chance to try it and a nice alternative."
"Not bad of a beer, I tried this one It has a bit of a chocolate flavor to it. I am pretty impressed with this one. I have never had any beer from Dixie brewing co. I think I may actually try more beer from this company. This beer would go good with a nice thanksgiving dinner or maybe a hearty soup."
"This beer poured a dark reddish-tinted amber with a single-finger tan head. The nose is pretty tight, all I'm getting is malt and maybe a little nuttiness. The taste is almost all malt, as well. There's a little bit of smokey and nuttiness in there, too. The mouthfeel slightly thick with some fine carbonation. A very drinkable beer, not exactly going to blow anyone's socks off but not a horrible brew to try if you're interested in the style."
"D - Very drinkable beer, the best dixie"
"D- This is a pretty malty beer, but very smooth and clean. It's not terribly complex but definitely a nice kickback beer. I can see this pairing well with certain foods."
"D - No. Not for me. Will I drink the rest of my 6 pack.... of course but I will never purchase this again."
"pours a dark reddish/brown color with lots of carbonation and a head that lasts seconds. Aroma is malty and some caramel. Taste is not what I remember this beer to be. Taste like a watered down malt bomb. It's crisp and is drinkable. I remember this beer having bite, was a tad darker and actually looked like the name stated back in the mid/late-90's (1996-1999). Not sure what happened but I heard an outside brewery was brewing this stuff under the Dixie name. This beer and along with the Crimson was my choice at Oddfellows in Hoboken. I miss this beer. Just disappointed. Still drinkable."
"Taste: Taste is alot like the smell. Very light and refreshing but it's still something that makes you want to slow down and savor it."
"Pours a nice semi-clear mahogany color, smallish off-white head fades rapidly into a collar around the glass, some lacing hanging on, and lots and lots of bubbles rising up to the surface. I'm getting a good amount of chocolate on the nose, roasty/nutty qualities. Pretty sweet overall, some faint dark fruits, cocoa, but also a slightly ""green"" hop presence. On the thin side of medium-bodied, some nice lingering flavors/bitterness, pretty quenching brew. Yeah, you could drink a few."
"Rich and sweet but refreshing and drinkable at the same time. Falls nicely into the Münchner Dunkel style, but in a blind tasting I would probably have called it a superb Altbier offering without having known that it was a lager. Overall a great offering from a true Katrina survivor."
"I love the look of this bottle. Pours a mahogany light brown with some red hues and a minimal layer of white foam head with minimal lacing. Smells of roasted malts, sugar and spice and everything nice. Tastes sweet up front with roasted malts the dominant flavor. Sugars and spices meld nicely with the other flavors in this one. ""There is a party in my mouth and everyone is invited!"" Nice medium carbonation with lingering sweetness. Great with spicy food but that makes sense since it is from New Orleans. I remember this having a stronger chocolate taste from many years ago when I had this last, but this is nice and will buy it again."
"Poured from a bottle into pint glass. Color is dark brown with about 1"" of fluffy off white head, which did not stay around very long. Smells sweet and malty with some spices. Tastes of roasted malt. Sweet with some hops. Mouthfeel is medium with not much carbonation. Easy to drink."
"The aroma reminds me of a candied apple and molasses and the flavor holds that along with a mellow roasted caramel note. The taste also finishes with a mild herbal hop note for balance. This beer is pretty low-key, but it'd be good BBQ beer."
"I like it enough to think about it later--it's a novelty label which helps the cause a little."
"Poured a dark amber color with slightly off-white head that didnt last too long. Aroma is of caramel and toffee with burnt notes. The flavor is roasted malt that is a bit sweet. This beer is very smooth and easy to drink. Nothing spectacular, but a decent session beer."
"Pours a deep golden brown color with a dense khaki colored head that left a sparse cap. The aroma is of doughy malt, some toasted malt with hints of butter. The taste is of a lightly toasted malt, some honey and caramel. Some grainy notes are found towards the end. The feel is light with pronounced but not overly strong carbonation, finishes fairly crisp and slightly tart. A decent tasting lager, with some nice toasted qualities. Doesn't really remind me of a munich dunkel, though. Its an ok beer to have lying around."
"Pours a dark brown with some ruby highlights and a two finger light khaki colored head that remains. A fair amount of stick left on the sides of the glass. Smell is nutty, smokey, and malty. Some sugary sweetness in the nose with a touch of earthy hops and grains. Very watered down flavor from start to finish. The smell really lead me to believe it would be more. Some roasted malts, grains, and caramel malt, but not much else. Aftertaste is semi-sweet and pretty clean with an interesting pepper like taste. Light body with a soft creamy feel to it and a strong carbonation. Not a terrible beer, just not one I would go out and buy again down the road. Glad to hear the brewery is overcoming the Katrina disaster."
"Not bad..."
"Pours a four finger light tan head that fades slowly, leaving some lace. Nice clear mahogany color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Balanced nose. Flavor is slightly sweet malt, nothing special, some what watery bitter finish and not a five like I rated it back in my youth (early 90's). Very disappointing maybe its because its contract brewed now and not the original. We can only hope that Dixie Brewing will rise from Katrina's destruction. $1.85 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"The folks at Dixie have an interesting take on the lager style. This is considerably darker and more ""flavorful"" than a standard lager, but it finishes just as smooth and crisply. I'm quite happy with this brew and would definately try other ones from this brewery in the future."
"D - This was interesting. Not like a traditional Dunkel Lager, but still drinkable."
"D. A little flat but plsent, with an anticipation of your next sip."
"D- This isn't too filling and it is pretty tasty. I'll probably drink the rest that were in the fridge! (hey, you can't leave beer like that)"
"D: I used to love this beer when I was younger. Definately a gateway beer in my case. Simple good beer. I wish Dixie continued luck in rebuilding."
"Pours a watery-looking but dark brown/black with a very tiny head of tan/light brown foam that disappears quickly. A very thin film of tan remains on top of the beer. It smells very elegant, chocolates and caramels abound, with a touch of lemon in the nose. The beer is really quite watery; not much in the mouthfeel department. Very malty and bitter in taste, with roasted malts and chocolate emerging midswallow. The lingering taste is that of dark chocolate and bread. A decent beer, but if you want a good schwarzbier, I recommend Sprecher's Black Bavarian over this one."
"Found this one at the local Publix. Had never seen it before so I thought I'd give it a try. Served it chilled in my Unibroue Maudite bubbler. Poured virtually no head even after a had pour. Looked dark iced tea brown but in the light a nice ruby color. Smelled faintly of candied sugar and malt with a hint of brewed coffee. Taste wasn't over powering, a slight smokiness, malt, very sweet with a little coffee in the finish. Carbonation was fierce and stung my tongue with every sip, I prefer a little smoother quaff. All in all not a bad beer, better for desert though."
"I believe I got this bottle at 3 Cellars in Franklin, WI."
"This is defitely a more malt heavy Lager but I still found it to be quite tasty, drinkable, and an overall decent drinking experience."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a dark ruby with a 3 cm off-white foamy head that is mostly diminishing. Aroma of toasted malts and a hint of chocolate. Initial flavor is much of the same, mostly the toasted malt, some coffee and chocolate. Flavor is balanced by these flavors throughout. Light body, light carbonation, moderate lacing, and alcohol well hidden. Overall, very drinkable and flavor was better than expected."
"Pours a lightly hazed dark orange, almost muddy, thin off white head forms, leaves behind some lacing on the glass, thin layer. Smell is sweet, some caramel, bread, light floral, some old vegetables, bit of a sharp citrus element. Taste is decent, some caramel, honey, some iron, citrus/floral, bit of strawberry in the finish, balanced. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Nothing spectacular but an easy drinking lager, thanks Mike!"
"The appearance is dark brown with a slight orangy tint. The head is thick & beige. It smells of toasted malts and a hint of cocoa. The taste is toasty malts, and there are undertones of caramel and cocoa. Mouthfeel is a little strange--very little carbonation, similar to a flat soft drink. This is a drinkable lager, and, as a side note, it goes very well with barbeque pork."
" Toss on some Dr. John on the turntable and visualize a night on Bourbon St."
"The beer is brilliantly clear, mohagoney with a thick white head. The aroma is highly malty, very nutty and slightly roasty. The flavor is very malty, mainly roasty, nutty and bittersweet in the background. The finish is crisp with a nice lingering maltiness. Body is medium-thin and carbonation moderate. Overall a tasty, easy to drink, malty beer."
"D: This beer surprised me! I was thinking that I would try a beer that was not world class or anything like that, but I was treated by this delicious dark lager that was a pleasure to drink. I could easily have a six-pack of these any day. Definitely something to try out."
"D: I really dig this beer. Had it a while back when I was in New Orleans and picked it up to bring back some old memories. Absolutely drinkable."
"Blackened Voodoo Lager is better than your average lager just don't expect anything too great or you may be dissapointed. Cool name and bottle though. Definitely a sessionable bayou beer."
"D - I think this brew is balanced and easy to drink. I'd like more body, but this might make a good introduction for novices into darker brews."
"Watery feel like a lager, but not in a bad way. Leaves a good film on the tongue. It's a nice caramel-laden drink. Light in body and drinkable. Sweet and good."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark copper colored brown color with a thin fizzy head that quickly disappears. The aroma is sweet malt, roasted coffee, caramel. The taste is dominated by the caramel malt with a faint hoppiness in the finish. The mouthfeel is thin and on the watery side with a moderate level of carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty subpar brew that really doesn't possess anything that makes me what to purchase again."
"Drinkability is nice, I'd have a second if there was one here."
"Balanced carbonation level with no unpleasant aftertaste. Definately a drinkable beer, I could easily see myself purchasing and drinking this again."
"not as heavy or deep as I expected . I would drink this one again."
"This beer was given to me by a friend. It poured an amber/reddish color. The head didn't last very long and kept a thing layer on the top. There was slight carbonation to the beer. I expected a heavier body to it. Overall, not a beer that I would necessarily seek out, but it definitely a drinkable beer."
"Dixie Blackened Voodoo Lager pours a dark ruby color with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma smells like caramel malt. Caramel malt dominates, but there is a noble hop twang backing it up. I like it. Definitely worth a try."
"This is a very drinkable lager. I could see myself drinking five or six in the course of an afternoon or evening."
"This beer has a really odd mouthfeel. Some good flavors start in quickly but then fizzes out too soon. Would be better if the flavors stayed around for just a little while longer."
"Verdict: Mildly drinkable and inoffensive. I can't understand the negative reviews. Definitely more drinkable than Dixie Jazz. Gotta be average at least."
"good carbonation. medium bodied. no lace. i like the feel. good session beer. goes down smooth. i will try this again when it is being brewed in new orleans again. nice example of a dunkel."
"Pours amber brown. Thin tan head,with minimal retention,and decent lacing.Smell is of carmel malts,and brown sugar. Body is thin,with a bit of carbonation. Taste is of sweet dark fruits and,a hint of roasted malts. Not awful,but don't go out of your way."
"From a 12 oz bottle this poured an odd amber color with an off-white head and big lacing rings. Nose was of caramel malts and citrus hops. Medium mouthfeel. Flavor of malts and hops. Good drinkable beer. I am glad I got a six-pack so I can try i again."
"This beer pours a clear dark amber color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into thin lacing. The aroma is of chocolate malt, toffee, and caramel. The taste is nothing like the aroma. In fact it is more like nothing than anything. There are faint hints of caramel and chocolate malt, but they disappear quickly. The mouthfeel is light bodied with annoyingly high carbonation. Overall, this would be a nice beer if the taste were more like the aroma, and the body were a little fuller. As it is this is a beer I will not be drinking again."
"Drinkability: A pleasant enough, sessionable beer with just enough flavor to hold your attention, but not nearly enough to make you think, ""Gee, I sure could go for a Dixie Blackened Voodoo right about now!"""
"This one is definitely a session beer for a hot summer day in dixie. I dont think i would seek it out, but if i was a guest at someones house and the offered me one i would not decline."
"M/D: Carbonation is about right, a little slick on the tongue, body is light to medium. Drinkability is fine as well. As someone who doesn't drink many lagers, this was a bit of a surprise with the hop character. The hoppiness actually reminds me of a local pale ale's hop profile. This brew also deserves bonus points due the determination of the brewery to rebuild and rebrew after Hurricane Katrina."
"Thinner texture with a low/moderate carbonation, especially for a lager. Dull and somewhat creamy with a slightly metallic and semidry finish. Not impressive with little character and somewhat bland throughout."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a good beer to drink for a whole evening as its flavorful, wont knock you over and has some substance to it."
"Pours beautifully, but, dudethis smells like dirty socks. Flavor is decently roasted, but it just seems a bit odd to me. It tastes dirty as well, in a way. As it warms it seems to be a bit more even, though. Still though a bit too live and leafy. Feel is nice. Just overall it seems to lack balance. Decent, but not a mind blower. Might be interesting on cask."
"This alright, I remember it darker back in the day, but I could be mistaken. Some more malt guts & this wouldn't be bad. Otherwise I'd only recommend in a pinch, better yet find Sam Adams Black lager or hell even Shiners Bohemian Black"
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a chalice. Poured a hazy clear dark amber with a large 2 inch head that left a small amount of lacing down the chalice. The aroma was of ashtrays. That musty, old ash smell. It also had hints of chocolate and roasted malts. Taste was of roasted malts. A very gently sweetness. Mouthfeel was very average. I dont think it would make a good session beer, but 1 isnt bad."
"This is a unique - and tasty - dunkel lager."
"D - A tasty American dark lager that is very drinkable w/ a standard 5%abv that makes it quaffable and just as appealing as the first time I tasted it about 11 years ago. A basic beer and a good example of the style, I enjoy Blackened Voodoo for its simplicity."
"Wow this is one foamy beer! Amber colored beer with aroma of faint toffee.Taste is average with vanilla and faint caramel.This is not a beer I would try again unless it was given to me.I guess I would recommend to try it at least once!! Just to note ABV is listed on bottle as 5%."
"FYI-according to the label, this brewery was almost wiped out by Katrina but with a lot of friends, they are coming back to life as quick as possible. It's nice to help support a true success story and get a nice reward with the taste."
"Overall impression: This one used to be available in the CO market, disappeared for a while, and seems to have made a comeback. The label mentions that the brewery was almost destroyed by Katrina, so I assume that is why it was missing for a while. Beer is decidely average -not horrible, but certainly nothing to draw me back."
"D-Not very complex but decent enough. A good choice in LA."
"Drinkability- This was one of my favorites from Dixie. I really enjoyed this beer. It's hard to find now and since Dixie doesn't brew it anymore that blows."
"M&D: fizzy and light, showing not much of a body rather than sugar-packed thickness... the flavour profile shows the features of a Schwartzbier more than of a Munich Dunkel to me, as the bready-malty theme is absent. Overall, a lacklustre beer in need of a balance and more hops, while what's too much here is the sugary flat sweetness. Maybe this clone is not brewed quite faithfully after all?"
"Nothing special in the feel of this beer, but it does drink well."
"Tasty, worth the £1.25 i spent"
"Overall - A pretty average brew... the best Dixie beer i've tried... probably worth a try..."
"12oz. bottle. Dark brown, almost opaque. From what I can see around the edges, I think it is clear. Ruby highlights present as well. Very small light tan head. Aroma was surprising, port wine (mild), vinous and sweet. Taste was quite different - roasted malt leading to a coffee flavor, maybe some burnt toast. Hop bittering was light, and showed up mainly in the finish. All told, the beer was mainly bitter, with only a little sweetness, which was not what the aroma led me to expect at all. Mouthfeel was a light body, with very low carbonation (could have used more). Overall, the beer was OK, easy to drink, but not very complex. Given the issues down in New Orleans, I will have to try this again sometime down the road."
"Head quickly emancipated. Deep colour, can hardly see my finger through the other side. Odd aroma, which is distinct. Some malt but in accompaniment to a weird liquor taste. Sweet and candy like. Clearly a lager with extract that keep you guessing. No finish, body/texture is fine. Taste has syrupy makeup. Full of extract in the aftertaste. Not very flavorful. I could drink again though. Thanks CrWills."
"Thanks crwills. It was past due, the brewery is shut down owing to recovery. Some oily additive to a weak lager, walnut extract? Thought it was a shwartzbier. Some roast, cheap booze aroma, carmel, lighter mouthfeel, but quaffable. Won't be sampling the rest of the brewery line."
"drinkability is ok. not that exciting, so one may be enough for me."
"Pleasantly surprised by this one - really didn't have high hopes. Picked this up as a $1.50 single about a year ago and never got around to trying it. I don't have a lot of experience with this beer's style but I will say that after tasting this one, I am looking forward to experimenting with other examples."
"Overall, this beer didn't live up to the hype if apperance and smell that it produces. Try it if you see it, but don't get to excited. Would co decent with a thick stew, but there are better alternatives."
"Poured a deep reddish-brown color with sparse tannish head. Monimum lacing as the head rapidly fell to a thin ring. Smell is an extremely nice combination of toasted malt and caramel. Taste matches the smell with the roasted malt and caramel, and adds some dark fruitiness (plums) to the mixture. Mothfeel is a bit thin but acceptable. Very drinkable. Could be a nice session beer."
"Mouth feel is medium in body and is actively carbonated."
"I'm not generally a big lager fan, but this one is decent. There's no head. It actually looks more like a cola sitting in the glass. I would've thought maybe they'd given me a coke or pepsi if I hadn't poured it out of the bottle myself. Like I said, I generally don't like lagers, but if you take just minute sips of this one it vaguely reminds you of a weak, carbonated stout. The only reason I got it was cuz we were eating at this great cajun restaurant called the Palace just off State Street in Santa Barbara, which i highly recommend."
"Pours very dark with a slight off-white head. The head disappears fast and never comes back. Aroma is decent with a roasted malt overtone and mild hops. Slightly roasted flavor as well, but way too thin-bodied. Even for a lager, this tasted slightly watered down. Not painful to drink, but not enjoyable either. Seemed like something was missing from this brew."
"A six pack of Dixie is one of the pricier ones out on the west coast. Should this really be a trend, I'm aftaid I will have to begin passing on this wonderful beer."
"Overall Impression: A fairly easy drinking beer. This is a good cross over for folks weaning off BMC. Lets try to support Gulf Coast breweries for a while; we dont want to lose any. Recommended"
"Lower grade for drinkability, as I'm not sure how much of this I could actually take at once time. However, much more interesting than I had expected, and definitely worth grabbing if you happen to come upon it."
"After admiring the appearance and enjoying the nose, I had reasonably high hopes that Dixie Blackened Voodoo would be my favorite of the three Dixie beers that I've tried so far. I'll have to give the nod to Dixie Lager though. I love the name and the 'spooky bayou' label. The least the brewery can do is to give us a beer that is equal to its theme."
"from the bottle got this in a trade but cannot remember who. but thanks to the one that sent this to me. poured black with a tan head. aroma caramel, brown sugar, raisins,root beer, sweet, toast. flavor, metallic, caramel, cola, toast. not to bad of a beer."
"Still, it will be sad to see the variety of American craft beer diminished if Dixie is gone forever..."
"I decided to try this beer for the same reason as sopor did; I may never be able to have it again. I hate when the little guys go under or get devistated by an act of God. Nonetheless, on to the beer: Poured out to a dark red/brown color with a respectable quarter inch head of cream colored foam. Medium low carbonation. Smell was somewhat caramel like with some faint malt overtones. Taste is straightforward and rather one dementional. Flavors of slighty smoked malt and some dark chocolate towards the finish. Nothing amazing. Mediocre mouthfeel was a bit on the watery and weak side. this brew is miles beyond most macros and has a place in the beer world. Even though it isn't the best beer in the world, lets hope that Dixie, along with those hit by Katrina recover from the devistation. Worth a try, if you can find it."
"I picked this sixer up purely becauase I don't know if I will be able to buy this beer ever again. I'm glad I tried it, but I did give the last five bottles and the case away to a friend who collects six-packs. They weren't worth drinking by my standards and I'm pretty sure four of these bottles will make it into his collection with the top on. I'm glad to have this bottle in my collection, but I won't drink this beer again."
"Pours a dark amber brown with a nice fluffy head. This may be my last chance to review a beer from Dixie since they were having financial troubles even before Katrina. Sweet, malty aroma with just a little faint coffee notes in the background. Tastes just like it smells, sweet & malty with nice chocolate and caramel notes. Good beer, I hope Dixie can make a come back."
"Pours a dark black with ruby highlights and an off-white head. Nose is big and malty up front with some coffee and chocolate notes. Taste was surprisingly complex for a lager - grainy malts, bitter coffee grounds, sweet chocolate and dark fruity notes. All the flavors are subtle, but there's a nice balance of toasty/bready notes and bittersweet coffee/chocolate. Mouthfeel is nice and velvety smooth, with a rich body for a lager. Supremely drinkable, reminds me of a cross between an American porter and a schwarzbier. I really enjoyed this one, sad to think that it's probably the last time I'll ever have it."
"Light and easy drinking. Drinkable like, well, BMC brew. Very dark color, dark tiny head, way under carbonated, thin body. You can taste the caramel malts, maybe some chocolate or coffee. Very light on the citrus hops, but you know they're there. Nothing to write home about, but I can see how you could pick up a six pack if the price was right."
"Sampled bottle while bottling my IPA homebrew. Poured a midnight black color with a healthy brown fluffy head. Some lacing of the head. Sweet malty smell. First taste has a slight hint of chocolate taste, then finishes with malt flavor. Overall a good beer."
"Basically an ordinary American micro solution to an ordinary German Beer. I usually like the finess and quality of German Lagers but the Munich Dunkels usually don't contain the maltiness and robustness to significantly stand out. Blackened Voodoo is even less so. Weak, thin appearance with a dainty white head that falls quickly. Overcarbonated and everso sligh malty sweet scent. No hops in the nose and less toasty or caramel aromas than desired. Taste is too subtle to be appreciated. Thin and watery to the palate. Hopped only to offset sweetness. Minor sweetness remains for only seconds into the aftertaste. In my opinion, a sub-par beer for the flavors and consistency that I like in a German Dunkel, but an easy drinking beer."
"Amongst the crowds of BMC drinkers last night in Uptown Charlotte, a haven of hope was found at the Fox and the Hound, with their 40+ bottle selection. I went with the Blackened Voodoo as a final brew for the evening, thinking this would take me a while to finish and feel full. Almost too easy to drink, maybe because I thought this was a porter or possibly a stout while pouring. Nice head and lacing, hints of caramel and nuts. Better name and label than drink itself, though."
"Taste begins with a faint toffee note paired with a subtle hop background and finishes with dry leather. There really isn't much to this beer. Finishes a bit thin and watery for my tastes. Quite a drinkable beer, but definitely not worth the price of admission."
"Not particularly memorable a brew."
"I would probably only want one or two of these in a sitting, they're kind of hard to work through because of the dominating sweetness."
"Appears deep deep black with ruby highlights. Very impressive head for this beer. Aroma is that of caramel. Taste is rich for a lager, some chocolate notes there as well. I really enjoy this beer. Perhaps it's due to the fact that I first found it off of Bourbon Street, after a few days of drinking American Adjunct Lager, and it was a welcome break. Very non-offensive. Very clean, and good. I'm glad it's finally distributed into Michigan."
"Mouthfeel is thin but pleasant, very drinkable. Not an incredible beer but not bad. I'd call it a schwartzbier, only a touch lighter."
"Well, this little number turned out to be a waste of money. Tastes like a fruitcake, only less complicated."
"The image of some bizarre, haunted lagoon on the lable makes me think that it was designed by some goth kid or a Uriah Heep fan who had too many bad trips. It poured black--black like my soul--with waning redness. There was no head retention to speak of. The smell was rather sweet, though. Swiss cheese (slightly smokey) and light cinnamon were evident. The subsequent cheese taste was *almost* overpowering. This took some getting used to, for me, but I began to enjoy it about a third of the way through. This is a very solid choice if you're looking for something different, but not risky."
"The taste was of roasted dark malt, but it was not overpowering. It seemed a bit thin. Still drinkable though, and I'd go for another if it were available."
"Medium body with mild, yet powerful carbonation. Smooth and clean. Easy to drink, refreshing. Nice dark lager."
"Pours a nice redish brown color, but with little head, maybe 1/4 a finger. Smell is not pleasant - oversweet with some aroma I couldnt place at first. Offputting. The taste is better than the smell, but now I know what the aroma is. Caramelization. Lots and lots. Way too much in fact. This beer isnt malty, its caramelly. Despite the taste, the mouthfeel is about right, and the beer isnt completely undrinkable. I didnt have a 2nd though. At one time, I liked this beer a lot more than I do now."
"Too damn sweet and that tartness is very offputting. Definitely won't have two."
"Light to medium bodied."
"This beer has a strong coffee like appearance with some burgundy hues and the same could be said for the taste. A bitter, hoppy burn contributes well to the rich , smokey flavor. Hints of caramel, chocolate and espresso collide in my mouth. The flavor is stout-like, while the mouthful is distinctly lager. The aftertaste is sweet and very smokey, but particularly faint compared to what you'd expect from a beer this dark. I probably couldn't drink this stuff every day, but the uniqueness of this brew is definitely worth a try or two."
"edit: about the ABV. it's not posted so it's hard to assume. from smell and taste i would guess it's above the 5% mark making it above average in that department and that's a conservative estimate.. to add to that assumption; i've had two and i'm a touch light headed. very abnormal for me for only having two."
"While I'm not normally a lager drinker, to me, this is a very good beer, probably because it is so different from most lagers. The hops was nicely restrained while still present, making for a well-balanced and easily quaffable brew. I will definitely have this again and am looking forward to having it on tap."
"This is some pretty good stuff. Appearance is almost pitch black, head is medium height and tan. Nose is very malty, with a smell that reminds me of molasses. Taste is all malt, with a strong molasses taste. Taste was slightly cloying the first time I tried Blackened Voodoo, but tonight it seems fine. Maltheads should really enjoy this beer. I found this to be a very good brew, but not something I would go crazy over."
"Pours a deep brown with a hint of ruby red and a nice one-finger tan head. Nice aroma of roasted malt with hints of coffee and molasses. Sweet malt dominates the pleasant palate, which is accented by toffee and a little bit of oak. Nice, creamy mouthfeel precedes a dry finish. Today was maybe a little too hot to properly enjoy a darker beer, but I liked it just fine."
"The beer pours a deep dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, yet very malty scent that boasts of crystal and pale malts; slightly creamy. The taste is decent. It has a creamy, rich malty flavor, but with a dry metallic finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent Dunkel. It has good aroma and mouthfeel. The metallic finish turns me off."
"Kind of boring."
"Pours out as black as coal... just the way I like it! Developed a small head, but had excellent retention. Settles to a thin collar with good lacing down the glass. The smell could only be described as odd...and somewhat unpleasant at that. My brother-in-law described it as an ""old foot," and I find it hard to argue with that assessment. Taste is a nice balance of sweet malts and bittering hops. Some nutty flavors also seem to linger underneath the complexity of it all. Mouthfeel was very thin considering how dark and malty this offering is. Overall it is a solid beer that is very drinkable (if you don't smell it too much). However, it does fall just slightly below my expectations. Tasty, but definitely not on my ""A" list of beers."
"An easy drinking lager, but I was expecting more body and taste from a dark lager."
"Dark brown beer. Even dark brown than a porter I just had. I don't think I should have read an earlier review. There is definitely something unpleasant in the smell. The auto suggestion ( from the other review ) of vomit was impossible for me to get by. There might be something else there but I could not get to it. The first mouthful was awful It tasted of week old dish water. Insueing tastes brought forward more of the sweet and roasted malt flavors that I remembered from years past. But either my tastes have changed, which is highly likely, or this is a pale version of the beer I once loved. I think their water filtering and softening set up has gone bye bye. I drank half a bottle while doing this review and threw the rest out."
"It carried great refreshment and drinkablility but I was just expecting more body. Maybe I got an old or bad bottle. I'll have to try this one again and see if the next bottle is the same way."
"This beer poured a very dark brown with an average tan head that left a nice lacing along the glass. The smell was full of a dark chocolate malt aroma, as well as some dark fruits. This is a medium bodied beer and the taste was fairly well dominated by the roasted malts although there were some earthy hops to give it some balance. There was a distinctively chocolate aftertaste, although it was not overwhelming. The mouthfeel was fairly creamy and it drinks down quite easily. My biggest complaint about this beer is that, on the whole, the flavors are good but they lack the strength that I was expecting from this beer."
"Drinkability- If you don't mind the hops, this one is downable for sure. Not much wrong with this one and it leaves little to be desired."
"got this at coops and a few other local bars in new orleans... poured a nice dark almost ruddy ruby color slightly sweet nose with hint of malt...not much of a head...had a really week mouth feel very watery and thin...but the taste wasn't bad...slight bite...not too sweet...notes of chicory and coffee...it's drinkable...i'd chug a few of these in new orleans with gator bites again...but it's nothing i'd crave...still when the options are the normal tap options...i'd definitely opt for this over coors light or bud when i'm nawlins"
"Small 1 finger head, dissapates quickly. Dark brown color, reddish-brown up to light. Strong malt scent, fairly sweet. Mouthfeel is almost watery, somewhat surprising. Definite coffe notes, almost acidic taste. Slight bitter coffee aftertaste. I would drink again but this isn't anything specia."
"Drinkable. Those who know what a Dunkel is will not be satisfied, but it's not a bad beer."
"This poured a dark red color with very little head. It looked like a cherry coke! There is a malty taste at first but I was left with a flavor that I couldn't quite put my finger on. My mouth became very very dry. I felt as though I needed another beer just to moisten up my mouth. This may have convinced me not to try anything else from Dixie Brewing. I have yet to see anything that constitutes real beer from them!"
"Small, grayish-tan head. Fast death. Black liquid is brown/red before a light. Smell is malty, tangy toffee. There's plenty of dark toffee in the front, but it thins in the middle: a sourish, watery maltiness. Some bitter chocolate in the light finish. Not bad. A light black."
"This brewery got a bad rep from having the worst ranked beer, which I remembered at the time of consumption. This one was a surprise, though. It did have a deeper taste that was quite intriguing. Chocolate and coffee flavors, medium body. I'd have this stuff again, probably."
"The beer poured a dark mahogany color. There was a small tan head. Very minimal lacing. There is a decent malt sweetness to the nose. Fairly sweet taste. A hint of roastiness to it also. A good compliment to many of the New Orleans sytle dishes. A good beer."
"Poured a deep mahogany and created a minimal light caramel colored head that stayed a few minutes.Lacing was nice and lined the glass to the bottom. Aroma was of nice malty notes and a strange sweetness almost like toffee. Taste was smooth with malts leading the way and staying throughout. Unfortunately, a metallic taste arose at the end, but faded as the beer warmed. Carbonation etched the throat a bit as it went down. Could be a good session brew, but drink them slowly or you'll fill up."
"Who do the Voodoo? I do! And maybe you should, too!"
"I thought the Voodoo was really good, but maybe not quite worth the high price."
"Drinkability - A little much for heavy quaffing, but tasty enough to down 2 or 3."
"Hmmm...I've had this beer before and I remember a little more roasted malt character and I forgot how thin it seems for the style. Starts out with a fairly neutral aroma with some chocolate and roasted malt aroma. These aromas are also the predominant flavors found in this beer. Hops are in check and the beer if fairly dry. A bit acidic and thin for the style. Nice appearance, but more of scharzbier/black lager, than a dunkel. The bottle I had was mostly near black with a bit of ruby color at bottom of the glass. I still like this beer, as I seem to recall having better bottles of it, but perhaps I'm just infatuated with the spooky label."
"Overall: Much better than the Dixie-Dixie that I just tried, in fact this was a very pleasant offering and I rather enjoyed this dark Lager. I just wish they would filter out those shrunken heads and chickens feet before bottling."
"Very dark amber color, small beige foamy head. Aroma is malty and slightly sweet. Roasted malts, slightly sweet. Slight hoppyness. Lighter bodied, full flavored beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean. Smooth taste. Aftertaste is slightly bitter"
"Pours black with a tan head. The head stay a few and give way to a sticky lace. The aroma is sweet roasted malt with a slight hint of caramel. The taste started on the roasted malt side and hints of the caramel giving it a semi-sweet flavor that had a very slight bitter aftertaste. With a nice mouth feel and a medium body, this beer is very easy to drink. Enjoy!"
"Poured a very dark brown with a tannish-colored head that leaves a patchy lacing on the glass. Aromas consist of some dark chocolate, nuts, and dark fruit. Flavor was rather strange, with a smoky, chocolaty, almost....spoiled fruit-type flavor. There is a solid hop backbone to this beer and the bittering flavor at the end lends testament to this. Mouthfeel was above average, with a high-medium body and smoothness. I was surprised at how quickly I drank this one. I'm still not sure what I think about this beer. I was intrigued by it due to fellow BA PhantomVoDoo (note the intentional mis-spelling of the name...), but I'll need to wait for a few weeks and try this again and see if my opinion has changed."
"Devilishly dark, clear, pour with ruby highlights. Average tan head and good lacing. Smell is sweet but rather dull. Taste is better--a bit crisp at the start, giving way to sweet malts and molasses early on. From that point, the taste fades in intensity more than it changes in character. Mouthfeel is not nearly as syrupy as one might fear, and this is reasonably drinkable as well. Pleasant but less than bold."
"Cheers to budgood for the sample!"
"Pours a dark brown with amber hues. Head is light brown with chunky lacing. The aroma consists of hops, chocolate malt, dark fruit (raisins & dates) and there's a feint hint of molasses. Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied. Taste is rather uninspiring. Hop bitterness comes through in the middle with the finish having an odd sweetness to it. Everything about the flavor seems set back a bit with nothing really standing out in particular. Not bad, but pretty middle of the road overall."
"a little beige head forms to a half inch and dies down but never dieing completely. leaves light brown, sparce lace in the glass. it's a dark ruby color. the aroma is faint and of malt, nuts, and a wild cherry type hop.the flavor is malty and slightly smokey with a bitter after hop developing. there is some coffee and moss. the mouthfeel is crisp but without objecting the darker swampy feelings of this beer. i used to like these alot but i found it to be merely decent this time around. there seems to be some body missing here and also it's sort of uni-dimentional. i will say this though, it's damn drinkable since it leaves minute after taste and comes off crisp."
"Overall, a solid dark lager, despite my dislike for the aroma. Does it get extra points for the cool name?"
"This beer confused me quite a bit. In the end, I've decided that this is what you would get if you mixed a smoked porter or stout and an IPA together. It's got the coffee, caramel and chocolate overtones of the stout, but the hops of the IPA. Both flavors are fairly mild so they don't war with one another, but there is a lot going on flavor-wise in this beer. The color is a dark reddish brown with light lacing and moderate carbonation. It smells like a decent quality porter, with caramel dominating. The body is very light overall, with the aforementioned flavors. An intriguing beer. I'm still not quite sure what I think about it, but it's definitely worth a try."
"I was somewhat confused by this one. Its a dark lager, but the taste is very light. It pours a dark brown color with ruby highlights, topped off by an average sized tan head that dissipates slowly, leaving a sticky lace. The aroma has a mixture of malts, caramel, and dark chocolate. The taste was moderately sweet and malty. For the style of beer this was much lighter than most other dunkels that Ive tried. Still, it was a decent beer."
"Color was an unexpecting deep,dark brown with some reddish tones, great tan head that was frothy and two fingers high and lasted through most of the glass. Smells of roasted barley, very earthy and light, kinda musty, with some floral hop notes. Taste is good with a smooth caramel roastyness and has a hop presence. Has a light, medium body feel, smooth with a little twing of coffee sense along with the a roasty dryness. Could be bolder, but is damn drinkable. I was expecting something else more like a Beck's dark or something, but was a nice surprise to taste its own uniqueness. Overall this is a light earthly delight."

"Note: This beer was banned in Texas due to the name translating to evil and Louisiana retaliated by banning Lone Star. Although this beer isnt great, compared to Lone Star, I think Texas at the time came out the big loser."
"Looked very much like a porter,mine did have some head to it but faded quickly.Had some chocolatyaromas and flavors to it,was pretty thin compared to what I thought it to be.Very easy to drink for the color,can drink many of these without filling up."
"This is a nice brewing effort. This beer is naturally dark like a porter, and has a delicious chocolatey flavor, but it's a lager. A damn good lager at that. You definitely can drink more than a few of these on a hot summer day."
"This is a nice little ""secret"" down south. This beer is dark like a porter and tastes a little like a porter, but it's a lager. It has a good little head to it that lasts for a little while. The taste is thick and rich of malty chocolate. Has a little bite in the beginning, but goes down easy and smooth. You have got to try it! Long live Dixie... brewing company!"
"The color on the pour a pleasing ruby red and the head modest in size with a frothy texture and the lace sufficient to coat the glass as required, at least by me. Largely malt aromas with hints of sweet caramel, clean and pleasant enough. Start is sweet, the top skinny, and the finish passably hopped and meaningful in its acidity, dry aftertaste and a drinkable average beer."
"pours a lovely dark cranberry color, with some ruby hues. frothy, tan and cherry colored head...leaves a nice lace. nose of honey, black liqorice, prunes, raisins, with some roasted chocolate notes. medium body, crisp on the tongue. i don't think i've tasted a dark lager with any similar flavors before. as it warms a bit, it gets a bit harsh. drink it cold and enjoy the flavor profile. an interesting lager to say the least."
"Pours a very dark brownish amber color with a medium-foamy and sticky off-white head. Nose is dark chocolate and caramel with some floral notes. Roasted malts really come through in the flavor with notes of coffee and vanilla. Fairly light in the mouth and a bit of a dry finish."
" One good beer nice aroma and color very drinkably!"
"Pours a dark ruby-brown color with a tan head, and nice lace that goes all the way down the glass. Floral hop aroma with some malt and a slight roast smell. Medium body and a light mouthfeel. Rich malt flavor with hints of fruit, toast, and caramel. Hops are not nearly as present in taste as they are in aroma. Very drinkable."
"Nice dark ruby color that had moderate, long-lasting head with nice lacing.  The smell was big hops, which smelled nice, but overpowered the malt.  The flavor was fairly simple---roasted/coffee like.  The malt was almost non-existent and the hops were not as prominent as they were in the aroma, but still there.  So, the taste was good, but the mouthfeel was a bit thin, yet the flavor lingered.  A not outstanding beer, but a welcome change from the macros and very drinkable due to the lightness and good flavor."
"Very dark brownish in color with brilliant ruby highlights and a creamy tan head that drops quickly but leaves a very good lace. The aroma is surprisingly hoppy (quite floral) with some light, toasty maltiness beneath. The body is medium, and the carbonation level is moderate. The mouthfeel is lightly zesty. The flavor is fairly rich with some limited dark fruitiness and a toasty, and gently caramel maltiness; however, the hop flavor is much more limited than the aroma suggests. It finishes quick and dry. Towards the end of the glass it develops a slight bittersweet chocolate quality. An interesting beer that is well worth trying. IMHO, Dixie's best beer. It would also make a great crossover beer at summer BBQ's or holiday get togethers!"
"Dark and malty, but very carbonated. It didn't exaclty fit with the look and flavor of the beer. Being a fan of dark beers, it was kind of a letdown. As a Schwarzbier however it had a nice flavor."

"Thanks to Johnny-Boy for providing this sample via a friend's visit to the Big Easy."
"Deep blackish color, nice, almost-hoppy aroma. Tastes awful, it has a chemical taste like when you've been at the cleaners too long.  Oily, clinging flavor that is not a pleasant hops-oil, but more of a sticky bad taste that just will not go away. As it warms up, it does not get any better.  Pass it by."
"This beer poured a very dark amber color.  It formed a light tan head that left some lace.  The aroma was of herb and malt.  The flavor was of malt and some herb.  The overall finish was a touch bitter.  I found the body to be a bit weak.  Really not a lot that impressed me with this one."
"Dark deep brown and clear, off white head lasts for a decnet time. Small lace traces down the glass. Smells lightly roasted with a hint of spice. Tasts somewhat sweet and rich, chewey almost. Slight smoke flavor contradicts the clove/cinamon spice.  Hard to make this a session beer, but worth a try."
"A clear deep amber, head is about 1/2 of an inch but pretty fleeting.  Sweet aroma, a little like honey.  Flavor is very sweet, too sweet, phenolic with some notes of vanilla.  Hops seem to impart a cinnamon-like zest, but not enough to balance the brew.  Finishes light.  Interesting, but not a favorite of mine."
"Head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is dark brown, but when light hits it the color turns into an interesting dark ruby color. Pleasant on the nose with aromas containing moderate notes caramel, toasted light bread, herbs, and notes of vanilla. Flavor is moderately sweet, vanilla and caramel tones, a little acidic. Overall this was very interesting, and an enjoyable brew"
"The attractive tan head tops a deep garnet and very clear brew. An attractive lace is left down the glass.  There's a sweet caramel malt as well as mild coffee - like chocolate malt in aroma, but there's a mild herbal hop nose as well.  It's definitely got a more complex aroma compared to other examples of the style.  The smooth, easy - going mouthfeel and light body provide for good drinkability.  Flavorwise, this is more assertive than the typical boring American Dark Lager.  Hop bitterness is above the norm and roasted grain flavors are mellow, but aren't hidden. Although not a particularly complex brew, this is much better than average for style.  Pretty tasty."
"I'd say it was ink colored but it's not that bad.  ;-)  It has a good toaster mollases taste to it but a bit thin. I had it in New Orleans during a nice hot day. It was served overly cold which probably took away from my enjoyment of the beer but helped me through the day. It smells like a hersey bar."
"A light bodied dark lager. Probably has more of a ""cult"" following rather than being sustained on it's own merit. Attractive color, however it's lack of depth is a bit misleading."
"A black beer which is lighter in taste than color.  Mildly hopped with caramel notes.  Despite its color, this lager is actually fairly light and pretty good as a hot weather beer."
