"Dark brown, near black, body with a half inch of khaki head. Chocolate, nutty, earthy, aroma. Chocolate and caramel malt with a hint of yeast and afterthoughts of coffee. Dark and rich. Light to medium bodied with soft carbonation and a mild hop note in the back end. Solid."
"Really good schwarzbier that is better than most domestic attempts at this style that I have had.  Flavor is a nice mix of coffee, roasted malt, and a bit of cream.  Stout like, but much lighter in body.  I would reach for this if I was looking for this style."

"I had never had a black lager before, but was pleasantly surprised. This was poured into a half pint glass from the tap at Devil's Backbone Outpost. Very nice dark brown to black color, with very little head. Aroma was nice and toasty, with slight coffee and chocolate hints. Mouthfeel was light. Excellent stout-like flavor, without being overly powerful. A great drinkable beer with good flavor and balance."

"Pours an almost black dark brown. Moderate light tan head melts away quickly. The aroma is dark caramel sweetness, a light roasted malt note and a little earthy hops. It's also very light. The taste is very similar with an interesting vanilla note in the middle. The body is lighter and there is a little carbonation on the finish."

"O: This is the first beer from these guys that I didn't find utterly average. It's very easy to drink, yet with a decent coffee flavor. I'd definitely drink this again."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours reddish black with a small off white head. Smells of coffee. Tastes of dark roasted grain and coffee. Beer is light bodied and good carbonation, nice finish. Overall a very good beer."

"Picked this up as part of a mixed 6 from Ye Ole. I have only had one Devils Backbone beer to date so did not really have any expectations. Also have not had much of this style so not sure what to expect or compare it to. Love the look of the beer, dark and clean. Very easy to drink with some nice flavor. Very interesting style and beer. A lot of the aspects of a stout but very drinkable which would make it a session beer. Overall a very good beer that I enjoyed very much and would not mind having again. No idea what a six goes for but an interesting beer to keep in the fridge to share with others."
"my first beer from these guys is a bit of a let down. it tastes a bit stale, like a crummy euro dark lager all extracty and weird. dark in color, more like a porter in looks than a dark ale, rather dense and not super heady after the initial gush fades down. a nose of tale dark roasted grain and lager yeast, nothing seems alive or fresh about it, flavors are all muted, and the yeast is just weird. i have heard these guys make some great stuff, but this is a pretty uninspiring introduction to this brewery. lacking the nice carbonation and quick finish of the better schwarz types, and not really giving me much grain character at all. it makes me thirsty for a good one. it also seems a bit thick and under carbonated, not the feel i am really after in the style. all up, there is nothing particularly bad about it, but it just never really comes together, something with the yeast i think, but this one is forgettable for me."

"This beer went do very easy, almost too easy. I could see why sitting around a table it would be very easy to drink a number of these"
""
""
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was really black and it poured a nice head. The beer smelled like beer, sorry! The beer had a malty taste and was very pleasant to drink. I would certainly buy this beer again. This seems to be a good beer company."

"Pours into my schwarbier glass a deep cola color with a light beige head sitting perfectly atop,just a great pour.Aromas of chocolate and earth with light roast...not overpowering,smells like a great dessert beer.Chocolaty sweet flavors but not overly so,some more brown sugar comes into play giving more sweetness but a big earthy backbone keeps the sweetness from taking over,roast is bigger as I drink more but the lager smoothness holds thr to the finish.I like this rendition of the style,it's alot better than most American versions in my opinion."

"Overall this is a well done Schwartz style. This must be very good when fresh. Give it a shot if you come across it!"
""
"Overall: Not sure if the metallic cola taste is an undesired element or not, but the end result is a brackish lager that has limited appeal."

"Very interesting. Very savory beer while being rather light bodied. Toasted grain, some burnt coffee and chocolate, savory on the mid-palate, Faint bitterness cleans up remaining flavors. Beer finishes clean and balanced. Subtle but with some great flavors that go together really well. Faint burnt ends that add to the flavor rather then take away from it. A really nice schwarzbier."
""

"O: Excellent brew – solid flavors and aromas."
""
"Nice dark pour, very little head. Smell is good has a nice coffee flavor. Tastes exactly what I expected it to after the smell but the strong bitter after taste got me. To me it has an almost coffee taste. I can't pinpoint the mix with coffee it has but overall I can't complain and would probably buy again."
"Although I would have preferred a little more sweetness, this is nonetheless a fine alternative beer for summers, especially if you like to spend yours eating charred meats and sitting around campfires until all hours of the night."

"O- Certainly quaffable, but doesn't have much character."
""
""
"D: a really awesome example of a Schwarz. brewed and packaged as intended. well-done guys. pick some up if given the opportunity."
"Overall: This is a great beer! A great example of what an American version of a little known and often ignored German style of beer, the Schwarzbier. I’m going to have to keep some more of this on hand."

"O- dry and smoky with some nice chocolate notes, refreshing brew and a solid example of the style"
""
"I'm a big fan of schwarzbier, especially on cooler evenings in the spring and fall. Would make for a good BBQ beverage."
""
""
""
"o: greatly enjoyed this scwarzbier - maybe it was the mood of a warm late summer evening in the mountains, but it's one of my favorites of the style, as this one seemed to have more character than most schwarzbiers I've had - and maybe blurred what I expected from the style a little bit"
""
"A solid and satisfying, easy drinking beer. It probably could use just a bit more body or fruits to give it more oomph, but it still is pretty tasty. Probably my favorite beer from this brewery so far. A good sessionable beer to go with food, since it won't fill you too much."
""
"Overall it's a pretty solid Schwarz but nothing mind blowing or something I would desperately pickup again. I would drink this again with no problem if I had a choice."
"This beer is okay. Maybe DB is targeting mass appeal, but to me this is on the B list. It's very drinkable and would make for an easy session. Definitely better than the macros. but a bit of a let down for those with a more adventurous taste."
"On tap @ the brewpub. Pours black with a sturdy light mocha head that rings the sides with rich swathes of lace. Smells floral and green with citric hops. This blends in with a combo of cocoa powder and some sweeter toffee flavors, while a firm roastiness shores up the back. The taste is similar, with a smooth blend of cocoa, caramel, dark malts and a crisp citric bite that leaves a touch of bitterness and roast in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a clean and tight feel all around. Flavorful and very drinkable, this is one of the better Schwartzbiers I’ve had lately."
"Poured a blackish body with two finger offwhite head that took forever to die and left sticky lace. Hearty, roasted malt aroma with good notes of dark chocolate and some caramel and I don't pick up too much of a hop presence but it's there. Light to medium bodied and easily passes the tongue but not watery, a touch of fluffy yeast for that fuller bodied sensation but mostly an easy passer. Taste is mostly the malts, a good balance of roasted malts and bready dark chocolate with some caramel, and a nice if not equal job done by the hops for balance and a little citric hop flavors in there. Not the most flavorful or exotic beer one is going to find but this hits all the basic attributes just fine and is an easy to drink beer that one can relax with."
""
"O: I was actually a bit thirsty before taking my first few sips and this actually quenched my thirst. I'm hoping this one sticks around during the fall. This would make a nice addition to my annual Halloween party."
""
""
"Overall – A pretty nice brew overall with a good roasty flavor and nice drinkability."
""
"Nice complex flavors. One to seek out."
""
"O: This is not the most robust beer, but I believe it works as a nice session beer. It's warm and refreshing, with a grainy profile that is nice to sip."
""
"Drinkability: this beer was extremely quaffable and very flavorful. One of the better beers during my visits to the brewpub."
"Drinkability: Just not a very flavorful beer, which is a big knock in my book. However, given that this generally is not considered to be a very ""flavorful"" style - in my opinion, at least, and I know there are likely many who disagree (perhaps my palette is simply not ""refined"" enough) - I can't necessarily knock it too much. At 4.9% abv, it's also not terribly unquaffable, regardless of the flavor-quotient. It's worth a try once, but like with so many DBB brews, I'm not sure if I'd come back for a second glass."
