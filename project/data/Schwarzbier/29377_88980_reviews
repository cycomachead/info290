"Very good Baltimore based beer"
"This one is a bit light in mouth feel.  There is really nothing here to excite at all."

"The Crack! unleashed a squirt from the brimful CAN and I could only smile. I upturned the CAN and began an inverted Glug, producing a finger of dense, light-tan head with decent retention. Color was Dark Brown to Very Dark Brown (SRM = > 27, "

"A Swartzbeir - a good beer. But just a bit too light. Very drinkable. Could use a bit more spice IMHO. 3.75"

"It's a pretty solid schwarzbier but is a little fleeting with a light body, almost too light. Still enjoyable."

"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a cola color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of smoke, coffee, roasted malts. Taste is coffee up front, some smoke and roasted malts, touch of hops, mild bitterness. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."

"Pours out a deep, almost black, brown with a pale tan head. No retention or lacing left. The aroma is pleasant, with nice deep roasted malt, slight coffee and maybe some hints of anise or liquorice. The taste is really phenomenal, with the roasted flavors up front and center and a nice earthy hops in the background. There is a pleasant silky mouthfeel and and little bite from the hops. This is a really good dark lager, full of flavor but not too heavy."

"O: Ok. I had to get this because it was $3 for a pint and it is Union's new addition to their canning line. This was decent but a bit bland."

"Pours a finer of off-white head over a clear very dark brown liquid. Smells dry coffee roast with a little bit of cherry sour to the roast. Newspaper and mild earthy noble hops. Tastes dry roast with a mild sweet chocolate playing underneath. Very light alcohol and absent of esters. Earthy hop bitter carries into the aftertaste with the lingering dry roast. Medium light in the mouth with moderate carbonation. I'm not a fan of this style, but this beer is a pretty decent drinking for a Schwarzbier."

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours with a nice one finger head with a reddish black body. Smells of coffee, small bit of chocolate, very inviting. Tastes of coffee with a good dark roasted malt body. Beer is very light extremely drinkable and carbonated well. Overall a very good beer."

"It pours a cloudy brown that sort of belies the black title. It's easy to forgive though as aromas of roasty malt drift up to your nose. The taste is even better: roasted caramel and chocolate with crisp and gentle hops for a clean ending. Fantastic amount of flavor for such a light beer."
