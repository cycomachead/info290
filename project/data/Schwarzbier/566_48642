The nose comprises mild maple syrup, roasted malts, and a hint of greenery.  The taste brings in more of the same, along with some grass and a twinge of cola near the finish.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp-ish finish.  Overall, a pretty nice schwarz.  'Nuff said.","TMoney2591","Feb 27, 2015"

Small streaks of beer form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is mainly of malt and caramel-like aromas. Taste is much the same with dark roasted malt and burnt toast flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an pretty good beer that is easy to drink but the flavors are better on the aftertaste than at first sip.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 12, 2013"
