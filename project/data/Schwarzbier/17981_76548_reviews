"Pours a dark brown color with off-white head. Dark malts, cereal grains, and some bread and biscuit on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with roasted malt."

"The beer is dark brown with a small tan head. The aroma is roasty, with notes of coffee and chocolate. Nice tasting beer. Light and simple. Easy drinking. A touch of hop bitterness in the finish. Well balanced. This is a nice brew that I wouldn't mind drinking again."

"O: A decent stab at a Schwarzbier. I can't say it's one I'll spout off about at my next tasting, but I'd probably have a couple if offered."

"Overall enjoyable malty treat that's light but favorable a good brew for sunny afternoon on the porch in Florida."
"Overall, this was a treat! If I would have had a cigar on me I would have been all set. I wish this was bottled because I would be soaking it all up. I have been around Germany and stayed in dusseldorf for a while and I wish their schwarzbiers were this good."
"O: very rich, almost porter-like doppelbock"
"O - Pretty easy to get down, solid flavors, could do more than a couple. Wouldn't mind this one again."

"Overall: Good beer overall. Not Cigar City's best beer by far, but it's still worth a shot."
"Overall this beer is very drinkable and smooth with just the right amount of roast and coffee flavor to be flavorful and appealing to even those who aren't coffee lovers."
"A nice schwarzbier and a good choice for session drinking."
""
"O: This was definitely memorable and will probably grab another pint before I leave town."
"Smooth, light effervescence, medium-full body. Faint drying aspect. A fine brew. Make it again."
""
"Overall a little out of style and sweet. OK though."
"O- Only the second Schwarzbier I've had that I remember liking. I'm beginning to have more respect for CC's lower ABV offerings."

"Overall: A fine black lager but I wasn't blown away by any means. A nice thick body and balanced well. Did have a nice rich coffee taste. A sipper for me. Cheers."
