"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 2/2/2015. Pours slightly hazy very dark brown color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, dark bread, light smoke/char, herbal, and roast/smoke earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity of dark/roasted malt and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, dark bread, light smoke/char, herbal, and roast/smoke earthiness. Fair amount of herbal hop and roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, light smoke/char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt and earthy hop flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean in lager flavors with zero yeast notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, fairly creamy, and slightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent schwarzbier style. All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/roasted malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Another tasty brew from Short's. I'm not too sure I like this more than their Black Diamond, which is a pretty similar beer, but it's still one that I'd like to have again when I want a dark beer that's not quite a stout or a porter."

"Decent enough. I think they tried to do too much with this one. Instead of the acidity/acrid notes, I'd like to see a little more sweetness, maybe honey added to this one to give it a little better presence."
"O- I like this brew. Especially the fruity character I get out of it. A nice thumbs up here, from me."

"As a schwarzbier, this is pretty decent. Probably a bit too heavy for the style though. The delivery is consistent and thorough. But in the end, like I said, it's a bit too heavy for me, as far as judging to style. This is a style that breweries rarely try out, so nice to see someone trying. Still a nice beer."
"A nice beer, recommended."

"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a very solid dark lager worth drinking for a long time if you’re in the mood for the style."
""

"D - Very drinkable. Very nicely balanced with a nice kick at the finish. Maybe a bit too roasted for the style, but I am really enjoying it."

"O: A good beer. Nice light flavor, nothing overpowering yet there are a bunch of good flavors in it to enjoy. This one was an easy drinking, good beer. Although I'm still hungry."
""

"O: This is a light Schwarzbier ; a style I have hardly visited and it is not bad but not great. Glad to have tried it and it is refreshing. Having this off tap if even an option I am sure would be slightly fresher with some more flavor."
"330ml bottle served in a Lager glass.Enjoyed on sep´11.Medium mahogany in color.Light beige froth, pretty good retention, some lacing rings.Yeast,cinnamon & tobacco to the nose,hints of chocolate too.Coffee at first sip followed by intense toasted malt flavor.Slightly peppery on palate.Medium body.Medium carbonation.Dry bitter finish & aftertaste with subtle smoky notes & hints of licorice.Good drinkability."
"O - the aroma was decent, but the tastes is just off, and not good. i will say my next beer is going to be amazing no matter want, thanks short's."
"Overall: This is all right at best. In terms of barrel aged beers, it does not stack up well, though."
"This was nice. A well balanced and flavorful Schwarzbier here that I would consider pretty darn drinkable for a 6% ABV dark beer. Short’s did right by the style with this one."
"Thanks hurfer for the opportunity!"
"o: surprised by how good this was. A tremendous flavor profile. i wouldn't need many of these, but I would search this out again to have occasionally. strikes me as a great one to have int he fall."
"This is a pretty decent offering...nothing fancy but very easy to drink. Refreshing, not heavy as the name would suggest..."
"O: overall pretty good, not bad for a beer that was only 2.75. An interesting style with characteristic especially in the mouthfeel category that I’m not used to."
"4/4/4/4/4"
"That aside, it tastes good, but will probably be forgotten."
"The flavor is malt forward with a light roast character. Each sip brings a subtle sweetness, with hints of dark fruit. A decent beer, and one I'd try again."
"Overall I though this was a pretty damn good Schwarzbier, I haven't had a ton of this style but I would have to say that this was my favorite Schwarzbier I have had to date. I find most Schwarzbiers to have a good amount of hops in them and this one wasn't hoppy at all, it was focused on the roasted and smokey malts and I liked that. It had a very rich and roasty flavor that was somewhat similar to a porter but every thing else was pretty true to it's style especially the mouthfeel. I could see how this beer would make a great choice to drink with dinner, the flavor is roasted and robust while the body is light enough to not be too filling to go with dinner, I will have to try and pair this beer up with a nice dinner next time I have it. I would for sure buy this beer again, it would represent it's style nicely in my fridge, I hope there is some more left at the store so I don't have to wait till next year to enjoy this fine brew. If you like roasty and robust beers then this beer is for you, it has great drinkability while retaining all those great flavors. Short's comes through with another great beer, I like the fact they can take an often overlooked style and add their own personal touch to it to make it a truly unique and great tasting beer, lets see what you guys can do with a Hefeweizen, yes that is a challenge."
"Pours a very dark brown with a single-finger tan head that sticks around for a bit before fading and leaving a bit of light lacing. The nose has a bit of light roast and a bit of dark fruit as well. Mild anise character. The flavor has a moderate amount of roast along with some sweet malt. Dark fruit and cherry come through a bit, along with some slight black licorice. There is a bit of a cardboard character in the finish as it warms, however. Medium body and lightly sweet throughout. Pretty decent."
"The beer is medium to light in body with a wet finish. No bitterness to speak of in the back, just a nice simple beer with a nice malt profile. I'd have it again."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a drak cola black with a brown khaki fingers worth of head. Nose has a slight metallic scent with coffe rum barrel and really only an earthy funky note i can find. Light notes of smoky roasted malts when tasting along with some turkish cofee and maybe some dark red fruits. Easy to drink and refreshing but really quite average."
"overall a good drinkable dark beer that is not too filling but still has flavor and is relatively complex for a lower abv beer"
"overall - nice chocolatey, true to style."
"The CPJ"
"Overall – Pretty damn impressed with this. While more along the lines of a stout, this is extremely quaffable and the flavors meld perfectly. I would certainly pick this up in the future if I saw it."
"black pour. little tan head. some lacing. nose is roasted and milky and chocolate cocoa with sticky bun glaze. the flavor is delicious and makes for an easy to quaff drank. chocolate and some chalky tones with a modest hop bitterness and light roasted quality are the main notables. mouthfeel is around medium. overall this is a nice little dance across my face. it does go well with food and i feel as though i lived the label being totally stuffed on alton brown's artichoke dip recipe and this here schwarzbier from short's. this is a semi sessionable dark bier toward the heavy end of the spectrum that remains true to style as it circles the stout and porter realm but never goes inside. thanks."
"Pours dark- definitely a black bier. The head is off-white, dissipates quickly, and leaves little lace. The nose is full of caramel, dark fruit, a few dabs of maltiness scattered about. The taste offers up some coffee, vanilla, slight roast, and chocolate. Medium body and medium carbonation. Overall I like this offering from Shorts. Very drinkable."
"This is one serious schwarzbier in that it smells and tastes a lot more like a stout than anything else. Sustenance is a good name because it is much more filling than most of this style. That is unfortunately my main problem with this beer. It is a bit too robust for a schwarz, but not quite robust enough to be a stout or porter. I think if I wanted something sessionable I would pass this up and if I wanted something roasty I would go with a big stout. It is still a quality beer though and is yet another fine offering from Short's."
"Overall, this is a good beer, though not a great beer. I'm glad I got a sixer and I'll enjoy the rest of it."
"One of the stronger examples of what a schwartzbier can be, this one is really worth your while."
"Pretty drinkable with no overpowering flavors. Alcohol is very well hidden."
"Overall I thought this was a solid beer for the style but was nothing to write home about. Still, worth a shot if you see it around."
"Reviewed on 6/29/2010. On tap at Shorts. Pours black with a small light tan head. Aroma of lots of roasted malt and grains, creamy bitter chocolate, and a hint of lactose. Flavor of toffee, lots of bitter chocolate, roasted malts. A light mouthfeel with a creamy texture. Very nice and quite a tasty schwarzbier."
"is very pleasnat and comes together well. I'm very much looking forward to trying the barrel-aged version."
"one of my favorite styles and this one certainly did not dissapoint in any way. would do this again in a heartbeat."
"D: Much better. Not as chewy as they'd lead you to believe but a warming schwarzbier nonetheless."
"Mouthfeel is lacking for me due to the ""shock"" every drink has on my tastebuds. Drinkability is average. I had no problem finishing the beer. I was just left wanting more."
"Appearance is black, really black with a thin tan head. Smell is roasted malts, dark fruits, anise, and some pine thats kind of burie. Taste is roasted malts, coffee and maybe some molasses. Mouthfeel is okay, astringent, and drinkabilty is pretty low, one is enough, still glad I had a chance to try this one."
"Absolutely jet black in color with a slight tan head-more stout like then a schwazbier but that's ok! Average aroma-somewhat spicy with a slight coppery/metallic note. Wonderful flavor-nice mix of roasted grains and a caramel like toffee flavor. Slight trace of licorice as well. Just enough hop bite to balance the whole thing out. Lingering sweetness. Velvety smooth mouthfeel. While it lacks the overall clean crispness of a lager and is far more stout like to me, this is one damn fine beer and very, very drinkable. Almost gone in 3 large ""sips""."
"Drinks like a thinner, lighter stout. Exactly what you want in a schwarzbier. Darker richer flavors delivered in a more sessionable method."
"Draft. Dark brown/black pour with a tan head. Good lace left on the glass. Teh aroma is very clean and crisp with slight coffee. Smooth tasting with coffee and dark raosted malt notes. Slight bitterness in the backend. Medium mouthfeel. Tasty but not something I would search out for myself."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with red highlights and a white head. The aroma is roasted malt, coffee, burnt malt, dark fruit and smoke. The flavor is heavy on the smoke and roasted malt along with some caramel malt and dark fruit notes in the background. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D - pretty easy drinking. I don't tend to like smokey beers but this one has just a enough of it to make this enjoyable. Only real negative for me is the mouthfeel but that might be because I'm used to the body a stout offers. I would drink this beer again."
"D: It goes down easy enough, but is not very exciting or noteworthy. Not one that I'd really be excited to find again, but not that bad either."
"Decent beer, but pretty unmemorable overall. Worth a try if you see it on the shelf or you're looking for a schwarzbier, but not one of the brewery's best offering, in my opinion."
"A black color pour with a small off white head, medium carbonation , spotty and jagged lacing . Aroma is caramel and roasty grain , coffee ,black licorice, and spicy hops . Flavor is very roasty , lightly sweet , lightly bitter with some roasty malt,caramel, black licorice, and earthy spicy hops . medium body , smooth creamy mouthfeel , very sessionable and very good , Nice work Shorts ."
"This is a solid drink but the aftertaste sits heavy on my tongue minimizing the want for more. I could have another, but one is fine."
"Overall, they don't mince word when they say this beer is like a meal. It's rich, bold, dark et al. It's not necessarily a hot summer day brew, yet its light body allows for easy drinking. It's full of dark flavors that would be great for a BBQ. Think of it similar to a nice, black stout, but with a sweeter profile. And since the ABV wasn't readily available, I'm guessing it has a fairly low %, since I'm getting much more flavor than I am buzz. Very tasty brew."
"The first sip gave me roasted malts again, but cleanly so, balanced by hop bitters, and suggestions of burnt caramel that fade to sweet. The hops have a nice, well played presence here, balanced with the sweet and the bitter of the malts themselves. Nothing is heavy handed. There is a medium body, with decent carbonation, but just a tad runny. The drinkability of this beer is great."
"Overall, rather medium to light bodied, with a dry finish. Pretty tasty and very drinkable."
"mouthfeel is thin but creamy, very sessionable for me, i could drink a ton of them"
"D- This is yet another beer from Short's that is very drinkable. The flavors blended well overall. This would be a couple pints and then move onto something else personally. A great beer nevertheless."
"D-This beer got better as it warmed. I started out with it from the fridge and didn't think much of it at first, but by the end it had a respectable taste and feel and turned out quite tasty."
"Nice beer. Really glad I got to try it and hopefully there will be some more Short's in my future. I wouldn't seek this one out, but if it were readily available I would pick it up from time to time."
"Deep black with moderate to light carbonation that forms a head that falls to a ring of foam. No lace. Fairly complex aroma of dark chocolate, burnt caramel and smoke. Tastes of dark chocolate, dark molasses, a touch of burnt caramel. Finishes with roasted chicory and espresso. Tastes moderately to lightly hopped; most of the bitterness tastes like it's coming from the malts with no real hop flavor. Fairly complex yet highly drinkable."
"Overall I was fearing this beer would very sweet upon smelling it. The flavors really went into the opposite direction once it hit my mouth. So it's really the best of both worlds...Sweet, lush and thick aroma with clean, dry/bitter and flavors and textures. I don't know how Short's did it, but I will definitely buy it again when I see it. Hat's off to the Short's crew once again!"
"Overall, one of the better black lagers I've had."
"I drank from a 12oz bottle into my Orval glass...The beer pours a light black with a ligh tan head, good retention and lacing...The aroma is totally dead, shows off only light chocolate, really boring...The taste is also light, gives a little smoke and chocolate. Usually i want more taste, but for some reason I like this, a light roasty porterish type beer that is really easy to drink. Nothing special here, but if you're in the mood for a roasty dark beer that's easy to drink, not a bad call."
"very drinkable and a great dark beer for the hot summer months. short's definitely did good with this one. added to my shopping list."
"Conclusion: Tasty beer, but doesn't really live up to the way it's packaged. Up in Kalamazoo, I had no internet so I wasn't sure what style this was supposed to be. From the title and description, I was thinking stout or porter. On here, it's listed as a Schwartz and, quite honestly, it makes a lot more sense and probably deserves to score a B+ but, as I didn't know that at the time, I still have to rate it at a B."
"Drinkability: Compared to other dark beers, I'd say this one fairs pretty well. Enough malt and bitterness to keep you interested, but not enough to prevent this from being a decent session beer."
"D: Very good, but only because it is so damn light. I wouldn't have another."
"Drinkability- Not too shabby, really enjoyed this one. It's got a great mouthfeel that's top of the line and big bold flavors. The beer 'for when you're hungry and thirsty' rings spot on. Thanks much Jeff!"
"D - Definitely happy with trying this and you should too. Great effort from Short's here."
"Unique dark beer. Very much black, and very much good."
"D- An interesting beer that I am glad to have the please of enjoying. Something worth trying."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. Dark black, fizzy with half an inch of creamy head. Smells of chocolate, coffee, and cigar smoke. Taste is mostly sweet with hints of raisins, nuts, and toffee. Mouthfeel is thin and fizzy. Easy to drink with minimal alcohol presence. Very solid session beer."
"Pours a black color. 1/3 inch head of a tan color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, hops, roasted malt, and slight coffee. Fits the style of a Schwarzbier. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. There is a noticeable bitterness level. Tastes of coffee, roasted malt, slight sweet malt, hops, and yeast. Overall, a little strong on the roasted malt / coffee flavors, but still good."
"D-A fairly spicy hop infused schwarzbier. Just enough citrus pressence to keep things in check and a light malty sweetness that creates a near perect balance. Very nicely done."
"Pours a hazy dark brown, some orange highlights, looks black away from the light, thick off white head forms, settles to a thick ring, some lace drops on the glass. Smell is neat, toasty, some roast, licorice, very bready, touch of citrus, some caramel sweetness, very malty, but not a whole lot going on in the nose. Taste is similar, light bit of roast, some biscuit, dark fruit/raisins, light citrus, toast and a bit of fruity sourness in the finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, goes down easy. Decent enough beer, but didn't really impress me as a Shwarz, something just wasn't right, and could use a touch more roast."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. neat overall. bit of complexity, but overall not much smoke for a schwarz."
"perhaps a bit unconventional for a schwarzbier, but quite flavorful overall."
"The bottom line: Surprisingly average take on the style by Short's. Perhaps worthwhile for big fans of the style, but I didn't think there was anything remarkable here."
"I had this on tap at Hopcat in Grand Rapids. The beer was black color with a thin head. The aroma was light and malty, a little roasty. The taste was dominated by roasted malts but stayed easy drinking with a light body. Very good schwarzbier, but honestly I'd made a mistake and thought I was ordering a rauchbier. Good though."
